    <right>consumption estimates, prey species abundance and biomass, lake productivity). patterns observed in this study may be a consequence of diet shifts associated with colonisation by nonnative lake_trout. for example, lake_trout shifted from a largely littoral, fish-based diet to a largely pelagic, zooplankton-based diet following invasions by non- native smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu) and rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) in canadian lakes (vander zanden et al. 1999). this conclusion was based on a comparison between stable isotope anal- yses of invaded (bass present)</right>
