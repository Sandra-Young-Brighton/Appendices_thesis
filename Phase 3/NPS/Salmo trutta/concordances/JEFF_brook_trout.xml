    <left>juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) (henceforth referred to simply as 'salmon') inhabit a wide range of freshwater habitats, their fundamental niche including both lotic and lentic waters, their distribution influ- enced by the associated fish community. however, the rhithron of fluvial habitat is generally considered to provide the primary spawning and rearing areas for salmon (gibson 1993, 2002; heggenes et al. 1999; armstrong et al. 2003). young salmon occur frequently in shallow open areas of the stream, compared with co-habiting trout species (</left>
