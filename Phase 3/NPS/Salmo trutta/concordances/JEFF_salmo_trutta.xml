    <left>, while in natura there is little evidence to support this idea (raeymaekers et al. 2010). this question is equally crucial for the management of biodiversity at both inter- and intraspecific levels (crandall et al. 2000), where lack of reproductive isolation can lead to dramatic loss of diversity following human medi- ated introductions or population reinforcements. salmonids species are largely impacted by these prac- tices (hansen et al. 2009) and they often show high levels of local adaptation (fraser et al. 2011). the brown_trout (</left>

    <right>l.) with stream-resident, lake-dwelling and sea- migrating life-history in two river systems in northern sweden. using regression tree analysis including ecological and landscape characteristics, we show that life history is the most important variable explaining genetic diversity and population differentiation. sea-migrating populations show high diversity and low differentiation, and lake- and stream-resident populations show low diversity and high population differentiation, among all samples. no overall genetic correlation with geographical distance was noted;</right>

(alexander 1977; heggenes &amp; borgstrøm 1988; kruuk et al. 1993). the main fish-eating mammal in north european fresh waters is the european otter (lutra lutra l.) in its area of distribution. mink (mustela vison schreber) also feed upon fish, but to a smaller extent and of smaller sizes than otters (wise et al. 1981; dunstone 1993). otters are opportunistic feeders in that they feed upon whatever available prey (mason &amp; macdonald 1986</right>
