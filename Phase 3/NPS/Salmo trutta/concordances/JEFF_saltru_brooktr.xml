    <left>relatively stable flows throughout the year. within a given branch, physical habitat variables including water depth, stream width and substrate size vary by channel unit habitat types (table 2; thompson 2004). across the watershed, pool habitat units averaged 16.5 m, riffles 19.1 m and runs 22.0 m in length. the pine river contains at least 40 species of fish (thomas 2001). the stream network upstream of the confluence of the south and main branches is dominated by cold- water species including naturalised juvenile steelhead and brown_trout</left>
