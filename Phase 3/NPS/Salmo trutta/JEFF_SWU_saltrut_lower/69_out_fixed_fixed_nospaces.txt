(wild celery) is a dominant species of aquatic plant in the littoral zone of many north american lakes and rivers (wiener et al. 1995). region-wide declines of val- lisneriu in the early 1980s (and recent recoloniza- tion), particularly in the upper mississippi river basin, have focused much research on determining the role played by vullisneria in the basin's food web. the loss of vallisneriu is believed to have con- tributed to a shift of migratory patterns of water- fowl with a trophic dependence on vallisneriu tubers (particularly canvasbacks) away from the 1 richardson et al. upper mississippi basin towards the great lakes (personal communication: carl korschgen, upper mississippi science center, u.s. geological sur- vey, la crosse, wisconsin, wi, usa). little is known, however, about the trophic “value” of val- lisneria for fish. potentially, the loss of large ex- panses of vallisneria could have a detrimental ef- fect on fish production. although vallisneria may harbor fewer invertebrate prey than more structur- ally complex plants (myriophyllum, ceratophyllurn and potamogeton spp.: chilton 1990), habitats with vallisneria probably contain more invert- ebrate prey than habitats without aquatic veg- etation. also, invertebrates on structurally simple vegetation, such as vallisneria, are more vulnerable to predation by fish than are invertebrates on more structurally complex plants (dionne & folt 1991). little is known about the trophic relations between the very common and abundant aquatic macro- phyte vallisneria and common littoral fishes such as bluegill sunfish lepomis macrochirus rafi- nesque. to address these general questions we combined an experimental enclosure manipulation (juvenile bluegills lepomis macrochirus in combination with vallisneria arnericana) with an energetics analysis. our specific goal was to test the hypotheses that 1) invertebrate prey occur at higher densities and mass in habitats with vallisneria than those with- out; 2) fish in habitats with vallisneria will grow faster than those in nonvegetated habitats because of greater access to abundant calorie-rich prey, and 3 ) depletion of prey by fish is reduced in habitats containing vallisneria compared to the nonveg- etated habitats. the experimental manipulation was conducted in the absence of piscivores to avoid the confounding effects of predators on prey-fish foraging behavior (werner et al. 1983). materials and methods the experiment was conducted in two 0.04-hectare earthen ponds at the upper mississippi river science center in la crosse, wisconsin. four treatments (bluegill alone, vallisneria alone, bluegill + vallisneria, no bluegill or vallisneria) were assigned randomly to enclosures within each of two blocks (ponds) with six replicates in each treatment. each pond contained a block of twelve experimental units (enclosures). each enclosure (1.5 m on each side x 1.2 m tall; 2.7 m3) had a frame constructed of 5-cm diameter pvc tubing supporting two layers of mesh material, a fine- mesh (1.5-mm bar), fiberglass screen on the inside and a heavy-duty plastic mesh (6-mm bar) on the outside. in addition, each enclosure had an 8-mm, bar-mesh screen on the bottom to prevent the im- 2 migration or emigration of fish. to stimulate the growth of rooted vegetation 8 to 12 cm of locally obtained bottomland topsoil was added to the bot- tom of each enclosure. large-mesh netting was placed over the enclosures to exclude piscivorous birds. in may 1993, enclosures were placed into the ponds and 75 vallisneria americana tubers (33.3 tubers/m2) were placed into each of the vallisneria and [bluegill+ vallisneria] treatment enclosures. this density of tubers approximated that found in vallisneria beds in backwater lakes of the upper mississippi river (personal communication, carl korschgen, upper mississippi science center, la crosse, wi, usa). water depths in each pond were maintained at about 1 m. the enclosures were inoculated with non- aerial invertebrates (e.g., am- phipods, gastropods, oligochaetes, and zooplank- ton) from a nearby backwater lake (lake onalas- ka) of the upper mississippi river. invertebrates samples from the lake were collected from aquatic vegetation, and combined into a single, large con- tainer from which 1 -liter aliquots were dispensed into each enclosure. twenty-five juvenile bluegills (range: 45-55 mm total length) were placed into each of the bluegill and [bluegill + vallisneria] enclosures in mid-july when the vallisneria had grown to about 20 cm in height. the lag time between placement of wild cel- ery tubers and fish into the enclosures (about 80 days) allowed the benthic invertebrate community to develop from aerial oviposition (e.g., ephemer- optera, diptera and hemiptera) and from the in- itial inoculation of non-aerial macroinvertebrates. the density of juvenile bluegills used in the experi- ment (11/m2) was within the range of those found in natural vallisneria beds in backwater lakes of the upper mississippi river (dewey et al. 1997). the experimental retention of bluegill in a patch of vegetation may appear artificial because many studies show bluegill tend to move between littoral and open water areas diurnally or between patches (e.g., baumann & kitchell 1974, werner et al. 1981, werner et al. 1983, keast & fox 1992). how- ever, diet and distribution data from a previous study (dewey et al. 1997) showed that bluegill of all size ranges foraged with equal effectiveness, day or night (from july into october), in vegetated lit- toral zones in a backwater lake of the upper mis- sissippi river. this study suggested that bluegill did not move out of the vegetated littoral zone, or if they did, the prey captured outside the littoral was identical to that found in the open water (a condition we doubt). based on this pattern of blue- gill site fidelity, we feel our experimental design did not create artifically constrained foraging con- ditions and elevated rates of invertebrate cropping. each fish was uniquely marked via subdermal elastomer injections (dewey & zigler 1996) and measured for total length and weight. individual marking allowed us to examine individual growth rates during the experiment. fish that died during the first week of the study were replaced with marked fish of similar size. five fish were removed from each enclosure by electrofishing near the middle (week 6) and end (week 10) of the experi- ment for analyses of stomach contents. fish re- moved in week 6 were replaced with marked fish of similar size. all fish were removed from the en- closures after 70 days. the mortality of the initially stocked bluegill was 0.6%. at the end of the experiment, the ponds were drained, the fish and enclosures removed, and all vegetation above the surface of the substrate was collected for determination of biomass. vegetation samples were dried at 60°c and weighed at 1-day intervals until there was less than a 1% change in dry weight between weighings. dry plant mass (14.7t3.4 [l se] g/m2 in vallisneria alone; 11.822.1 g/m2 in vallisneria+bluegill) did not dif- fer between the treatments or ponds. benthic invertebrates were sampled from each en- closure at the beginning (week l), middle (week 6) and final week of the study (week 10 before removal of plants and fish). macroinvertebrates were sampled from two randomly selected quadrat points inside each enclosure with a vacuum sampler (brown et al. 1987). the sampler removed invert- ebrates from the water column (about 10 liters in volume), sediment, and plant stems. hereafter in this paper, we refer to these invertebrates as “ben- thos” although they contained taxa not strictly in- habiting bottom sediments. these samples were pre- served in 5% neutral-buffered formalin, sorted, identified to the lowest practical taxon (merritt & cummins 1984, pennak 1989, thorpe & covich 1991), and counted. on the same dates, zooplank- ton were sampled in each enclosure with two vertical hauls of a wisconsin net (60-pm mesh), one haul in the center of the enclosure and the second near the wall. zooplankton samples were preserved in 4% su- crose-formalin (haney & hall 1973), identified to the lowest practical taxon (brooks 1959, yeatman 1959, pennak 1989), and counted. stomachs were dissected from fish at the time of sampling and preserved in a 5% formalin solution. to analyze fish diet, stomachs were first wet-weigh- ed after blotting off excess water. then the stom- ach contents were removed and prey were identified and counted. mass of each prey taxon was esti- mated by regressing the numbers of each prey taxon on the stomach weight with a multiple-re- gression model (hayes & taylor 1991). the gener- alized regression equation was: bioenergetic relations in submerged aquatic vegetation where swi is the stomach weight (weight of con- tents) of fish i; is the mean weight per individual of prey taxonj; xij is the number of preyj in stom- ach i; and ej is the random error for stomach i. individual prey weights, by taxon, in each stom- ach were determined by multiplying the number of each prey taxon found in each stomach by the regression coefficient for that taxon: pw.=p.z. j j j’ where pwj is the mean prey weight for prey taxonj and .fj is the mean number of prey taxonj per stomach. prey taxa included in the multiple-regression model were selected with the optimum r2 method, as tested by the c(p) statistic (sas institute 1991). for prey taxa, such as cladocera and copepods, whose weights were not well estimated with this technique due to high variability in weight, average weights were obtained from the literature (dumont et al. 1975, bottrell et al. 1976, hambright & frid- man 1994). we converted the invertebrate biomass to caloric equivalents with the relations reported in cummins & wuycheck (1971). water temperature was measured weekly at mid- depth in each enclosure with a yellow springs in- corporated model 57 water quality probe. tem- perature ranged from 24 to 26°c during the first half of the experiment but declined to about 10°c by week 10 (fig. 1). turbidity was measured week- ly in each enclosure with a hach model 2100p turbidimeter. pond 1 was slightly more turbid than pond 2 during much of the first 7 weeks (mean of 5 ntu in pond 2 vs 6 ntu in pond 1) of the experiment; turbidity declined to about 2 ntu in both ponds by the end of the experiment. response variables sampled repeatedly through time (e.g., benthic invertebrate and zooplankton abundance, and density of prey taxa in stomachs) were analyzed with two-factor anova with re- peated measures (winer et al. 1991) with the stat- istical analysis system, general linear model pro- cedure (glm: sas institute 1991). response vari- ables quantified at the end of the experiment (fish survival and plant biomass) were analyzed with two-factor analysis of variance (anova). the fac- torial anova tested for both main effects and in- teraction effects. the test for a main effect (e.g., bluegill effect) compared the average response of all enclosures containing a particular treatment level (e.g., mean of all enclosures with bluegills) to all those lacking that treatment level (e.g., mean of all enclosures without bluegills), not the average of each treatment combination to the average control response. the interaction effect tested for re- 3 richardson et al. sponses that depended on the presence of com- bined treatments (i.e., both bluegills and vullisner- iu). differences between specific treatments were tested with the bonferroni t-test, which controls maximum experimentwise error rates (miller 1981). a type i error (a) of 0.1 was used to judge the significance of all statistical tests because we anticipated high variation in most responses in- volving invertebrate density and mass (elliott 1983). response variables were normalized and variance stablized as necessary with a log,, (x+l) transformation after testing with the shapiro- wilkes test (shapiro & wilkes 1965). the energetics of fish growth were analyzed with the bioenergetics model i1 (hewett & johnson 1992), which estimates the energy needed to pro- duce fish of a given mass based on water tempera- ture, prey mass, and duration of growth. the model accounts for energetic expenditures includ- ing metabolic, handling, and specific dynamic ac- tion costs, and converts prey masses to caloric in- take. growth occurs if caloric intake is greater than the caloric costs of prey capture, prey han- dling, and digestion (specific dynamic action). en- ergetic costs of movement, prey handling, and me- tabolism were supplied in the standard data files included with the model. results fish growth and energetics bluegill in enclosures with vallisneria grew sig- nificantly (p=o.oos) more in weight (about 10% more) and length (about 5% more) than those from ,-. 2 - 25 p e *o 15 0 0 10 !k i cn 5 - 25  0 1 10 20 30 40 day 50 60 10 70 fig. 1. specific growth (caloriedg dry wuday) of individual bluegills (solid line=enclosures with vallisneria, dashed line= enclosures without vullisneria) and water temperature (“c;

p= 0.0007) densities declined in the presence of bluegill regardless of the presence of vegetation. conversely, chydoridae densities increased in the presence of bluegill (p= 0.026). daphnia (mainly d. pulex leydig, but in- cluding d. obtusa kurz, d. catawba coker, d. par- vula fordyce) had relatively high densities (250- 300 ind./l) at the start of the experiment but de- clined to near zero by week 10. the treatments had no significant effect on daphnia or ostracod densi- ties. the decline of daphnia over an 10-week period (july-september) was presumably the result of natural succession and declines of water tem- perature and day length (e.g., stross 1987, threlk- eld 1987). copepods (tropocyclops, mesocyclops, diaptomus, eurytemora) were the most abundant zooplankters, attaining densities of more than 2000 ind./l in control enclosures, and did not re- spond to any treatment. ostracods also were com- mon in the benthos samples. however, we feel that sample processing was inadequate to accurately es- timate ostracod density and we will discuss them no further. effects of vallisneria on macroinvertebrates total mass and densities of most macroinvertebr- ate taxa were greater in the vallisneria enclosures than in enclosures without vallisneria (fig. 2). in particular, densities of amphipods were greater in vallisneria enclosures (p=o.oool) than other treat- ments, reaching densities up to 236 ind/m2 by week - v p=o.o001 late p=0.005 t benthos i week1 0 t 1400 1050 700 350 n 1 [15 w a 0 0 - w u 9 < 0 60 -  v peooo4 - date p=0074 f p=0102 fxv p=o 057 zooplankton 40 20 0 i h veg conlrol fish f+v fig. 4. caloric content (mean calories/m2? 1 se) of (a) benthos and (b) zooplankton by treatment. “control”=enclosures wit- hout vu’allisneriu or bluegills, “veg”=enclosures with only vu- ilisneriu, “fish”=enclosures with only bluegills, “f+v”=en- closures with both bluegills and vullisneriu. probability state- ments are the result of 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures;

benthos in the treatment contain- ing both vallisneriu and fish contained about 600 cal/m2. by the end of the experiment benthic calor- ies in the control enclosures increased slightly to approximately 300 cal/m2 and those in the fish- only treatments remained near 225 cal/m2. benthic calories in the vallisneria treatment declined sig- nificantly (p=o.oool) to less than 225 cal/m2, 7 richardson et al. whereas those in the fish+ vullisneriu treatment de- clined only slightly (to 530 cal/m2) from the levels during week 6. bluegill, therefore, cropped about 26% of the available benthic calories in vegetation and 17% of those in non-vullisneria treatments over the duration of the experiment. amphipod and gastropod densities were cropped significantly by bluegills in the enclosures without vullisneriu; amphipods were reduced by 41% and gastropods were reduced by 84% relative to the control enclos- ures. in the vullisneriu + bluegill enclosures am- phipods were cropped by 720/0 relative to enclos- ures with vallisneriu only, whereas gastropod den- sities were reduced only by 3%. zooplankton contributed a relatively minor pro- portion of the total calories available for growth of bluegills (fig. 4). the majority of calories were contained in duphniu whose densities were greater than other zooplankton during the first week. in week 6 the composition of zooplankton had shifted from large cladocerans to cyclopoid cope- pods and chydorid cladocerans. consequently, mean caloric density of the zooplankton was re- duced significantly to less than 5 cal/m2 in all but the fish + vullisneriu enclosures. the significant in- teraction (p=0.057) indicated that the effect of fish on zooplankton caloric concentration was depend- ent on the presence of vullisneriu. discussion invertebrate abundance and cropping of invertebrates by fish the presence of vegetation in our experiment sig- nificantly increased the potential available calories in benthic prey relative to controls (containing nei- ther fish or vegetation). this effect is nearly univer- sal for both freshwater and marine habitats (stoner 1980, dvorak & best 1982, virnstein et al. 1983, beckett et al. 1992). in our experiment, fish significantly reduced the total calories in enclos- ures containing vullisneria during the warm water period (week 6), but not at the end of the experi- ment when the water was 10-15°c cooler. this suggests that the predation effect on benthic prey was largely dependent on feeding rates of the fish, which in turn was driven by water temperatures. we estimate that the vullisneriu enclosures pro- vided nearly 64% more potential benthic calories for growth of bluegills than non- vullisneria treat- ments. the effect of bluegills, in the presence of vullis- neria, on amphipod standing stock was not paral- leled in the diets, i.e., significant reductions in the standing stock of amphipods in enclosures con- taining both bluegill and vallisneriu did not result in greater mass or numbers of amphipods in stom- 8 achs of these bluegills. clearly, the relatively long- term and cumulative effects of fish predation on standing stocks were more easily detected and less variable than the effects reflected in the relatively instantaneous effects of prey consumption and di- gestion. chilton & margraf (1990) conducted the only other enclosure experiment to use bluegills and vullisneriu. they reported increased densities of many bluegill prey, including amphipods, in the presence of bluegill compared with no-fish treat- ments; they did not, however, have a no- vullisneriu treatment. it is likely that the small size of their enclosures (0.37 m2), large mesh size (0.8 cm), and single bluegill per enclosure allowed immigration of amphipods and other prey into the enclosures at rates greater than the depletion by bluegill crop- ping. amphipods and gastropods in our experi- ment comprised the greatest caloric resources for bluegills in vullisneriu enclosures. amphipods were, however, more vulnerable to fish predation than gastropods, probably because of their con- spicuous rapid movements and lack of cryptic coloration. amphipod densities also were reduced rapidly in the presence of bluegills in an experi- ment by crowder & cooper (1982). gastropods (physa and helisoma) were unaffected by fish in crowder and cooper's (1982) experiment, al- though physu only occurred in their high macro- phyte density treatment. savino et al. (1992) and schramm & jirka (1989) also found bluegills had little effect on gastropods (physidae) in vegetated habitats. these authors speculate that the lack of molariform pharyngeal teeth limit bluegill's ability to ingest gastropods. however, dewey et al. (1997) found that juvenile bluegill frequently consumed gastropods in a backwater lake of the upper mis- sissippi river. our findings 'of significant reduction in the density of gastropods in the non-vullisneriu enclosure with bluegills, as well as gastropod re- mains in the guts of bluegill, suggest that gastro- pods can be a significant food source for bluegills when other prey are scarce, the presence of bluegill, without vallisneriu, had little effect on the mass of most benthic invert- ebrates (i.e., no significant cropping effect). throughout the experiment there was a low den- sity of benthic prey available in the enclosures without vullisneviu that was never entirely depleted by fish predation. the remaining benthos in these enclosures were either inaccessible to fish or pro- duced in situ at a rate that out-paced predation. immigration of prey was unlikely because of the small mesh size on the enclosure walls. because we do not have estimates of invertebrate production, we were unable to relate fish production directly to invertebrate prey production. the lack of signifi- cant fish effects on benthic invertebrate abundance in the absence of vullisneria suggests, however, some factor other than bluegill predation may be limiting invertebrate production (e.g., trophic re- sources). fish growth and related environmental factors the pattern of bluegill growth during this experi- ment was the result of an interaction between tem- perature-dependent growth (and ingestion) rate and vegetation-dependent prey availability. at the start of the experiment, bluegills grew rapidly in both vallisneria and non- vallisneria enclosures. water temperatures were high (20-25°c) and struc- tural complexity was similar in all enclosures be- cause the stems of vullisneria were relatively short (median stem height was about 20 cm). zooplank- ton, which initially dominated bluegill diets, were abundant and of similar composition (high densi- ties of duphnia and copepods) in all enclosures. benthic macroinvertebrate populations developed rapidly in the presence of vallisneria and were not subjected to significant predation pressure because bluegill foraging focused on zooplankton and small-bodied epiphytic invertebrates. as the experiment progressed (i.e., by week 6), zooplankton declined, water temperatures re- mained high, vallisneria stems grew to heights that obstructed about half of the free space in the veg- etated enclosures, and benthic macroinvertebrate densities increased. gerking (1962) considered the late summer decline of cladocerans in a lake in in- diana a “disastrous” loss of a major component of the total bluegill food supply. we have shown (de- wey et al. 1997), however, large cladocerans do not make up a large portion of diets of juvenile and adult bluegill in local backwater lakes. the decline of zooplankton in the experiment (and probably in local backwater lakes) was likely of little energetic consequence because of the availability of epi- phytic and benthic prey of a wide range of sizes. also, large-bodied benthic prey were still relatively accessible because the vullisneria stems had not yet grown tall enough to severely inhibit foraging be- havior. moreover, increased bluegill size (larger gape) enabled them to consume larger prey. the combination of high water temperature, increased bluegill gape, and increased macroinvertebrate prey availability resulted in the highest observed growth rates of bluegills during the experiment. during the last third of the experiment, bluegill growth rates in all enclosures were similar and de- clined precipitously as water temperatures de- clined. the density of most macroinvertebrates in the fish enclosures either increased or remained constant compared to the middle of the experi- bioenergetic relations in submerged aquatic vegetation ment (week 6), indicating reduced cropping by fish. only densities of zooplankton (e.g., ceriodaphniu, duphnia, and copepods) and chironomid larvae declined, but they were not major diet components by mass. despite the relatively high density of large prey (e.g., amphipods and gastropods), bluegill growth declined as the water cooled (dropping from over 20°c to less than 10°c in about 14 days), indicating that water temperature was an over-rid- ing control of growth. by the end of the experiment, the number of vallisneria stems had multiplied and the length of individual stems exceeded the depth of the water leaving little open water in the vallisneria enclos- ures. we estimate that stem densities ranged from 260-330/m2 (assuming 8-1 0 stems develop from each tuber; droust & laporte 1991), and as the stems lengthened the foraging area was likely re- duced beyond that allowing effective foraging by bluegills. crowder & cooper (1982) hypothesized that bluegill should be able to forage most ef- ficiently in “intermediate” stem densities (1 1 1 stems/m2) as a result of the inverse relationship be- tween stem density and forage efficiency, and the direct relationship between stem density and in- vertebrate production. their experiment sup- ported this hypothesis and wiley et al. (1984) also demonstrated a parabolic growth curve with highest fish growth at intermediate vegetation den- sities. despite evidence for the importance of stem density as a determinant of forage efficiency and growth of fish in some systems, the relation be- tween variation in stem density and fish growth is still debated. for example, savino et al. (1992) found that bluegill growth was significantly greater in vegetation when compared with nonvegetated habitats; additional macrophyte density did not re- sult in significant increases in fish growth. crowd- er & cooper’s (1982) lack of a “no plant” treat- ment make it difficult to evaluate the absolute role of plants (versus no plants) in determining fish growth. diehl (1993) showed that perch (perca fluviarilis l.) growth rates increased with increas- ing macrophyte stem densities (480-1500 stems/ m2); fish in enclosures without vegetation quickly depleted prey, resulting in decreased growth rates. diehl (1993) suggested that aquatic macrophytes tend to moderate the prey depletion effects (due to less efficient foraging in macrophytes than open water), resulting in overall greater fish growth in vegetated than in unvegetated littoral habitats. fi- nally, pardue (1973) showed that increasing the surface area available for colonization by invert- ebrates increased the production of invertebrate prey for bluegill, resulting in increased fish growth. this phenomenon has been exploited for decades 9 richardson et al. in aquaculture and fisheries management to pro- mote high fish production (rodeheffer 1940, swingle 1968). importance of increased bluegill growth in vallisneria increased growth of bluegills in response to the presence of vallisneria could lead to increased overwinter survival. because bluegill feed little during the winter (keast 1968), size-specific meta- bolic rates and energy storage may be critical to their survival to spring. in temperate regions, large individuals of a given age cohort of fish tend to survive winter conditions in greater numbers than small individuals (hunt 1969, oliver et al. 1979, cargnelli & gross 1996). post & evans (1989) documented increased recruitment of the larger age 0+ yellow perch (perca flavescens [mitchill]) due to decreased winter mortality. smaller individ- ual fish tend to use energy reserves at faster rates than large individuals, placing them at proportion- ately greater starvation risk during long winters (paloheirno & dickie 1966). gutreuter & ander- son (1985) showed experimentally that larger indi- viduals of age-0 largemouth bass micropterus sal- moides (lacepede) are significantly more likely to be recruited to the population in the following year than smaller individuals. larger fish often possess greater energy reserves than small fish, buffering them from the stress of cold water temperatures and periods of non-feeding (toneys & coble 1979, miranda & hubbard 1994). stressful, rapid in- creases in water temperature can also have detri- mental effects on fish in poor condition. saiki & tash (1978) showed that largemouth bass in poor condition (small size) were more susceptible than those in good condition to mortality from in- creased metabolic stress following unusual and rapid rates of increasing air temperatures during spring. increased growth rates of bluegills in aquatic vegetation relative to those in unvegetated habitats also may result in increased first-year survival due to reduced predation pressure. dewey et al. (1997) showed that rapid increases in sizes of juvenile bluegills can lead to reduced predation by age-0 largemouth bass due to gape limitation. we hy- pothesize that bluegills in vegetated habitats may be vulnerable to predation by age-0 bass for a shorter period of time than bluegill with less access to vegetation because of faster growth rates in veg- etated habitats. resumen 1. comprobamos, experimentalmente, la siguiente hipotesis: debido a que 10s habitats con vegetacion contienen mayor den- 10 sidad calorica y son menos susceptibles a disminucion o perdida energetica, lepomis macrochirus cerce mas rapidamente en me- dios con vegetacion que en 10s que carecen de ella. 2. durante 10 semanas colocamos, en distintas jaulas, combina- ciones factoriales de presencialausencia de vallisneria america- nu con juveniles de lepomis. despues de 6 semanas, 10s trata- mientos con vallisneria contuvieron una media de 1048 cavm2 (bentos), mientras que 10s tratamientos con vallisneria y lepo- mis solamente 610 cal/m2. 3. comprobamos, ademas, que hyalella azteca preferida por lepomis, practicamente desaparecio de las jaulas sin vegeta- cion, mientras que en las jaulas con vallisneria se vio menos afectada por la presencia de 10s peces. 4.lepomis crecio mas en las jaulas con vallisneria, pero, a pesar de la abundacia de la presa, el posterior descenso de la tempera- tura despues de la sexta semana provoc6 un crecimiento menor. la razon ultima del crecimiento de lepomis es el resultado de la interaccion entre la disponibilidad y el consumo de presas, y la temperatura del agua.
