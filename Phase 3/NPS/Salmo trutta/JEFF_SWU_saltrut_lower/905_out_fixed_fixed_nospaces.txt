these ponds could thus serve as important non-native source areas and negatively impact co-occurring native fish populations. key words: castor canadensis; desert fishes; assemblage structure; impoundments; microhabitat use; dryland stream introduction management of freshwater ecosystems takes place at the intersection of numerous ecological and social trends, which can create novel challenges for natural resource conservation and policy. recent decades have witnessed growing interest in employing or mimicking the remarkable engineering abilities of beaver (castor canadensis and c. fiber) in stream restoration efforts (pollock et al. 2007; devries et al. 2012). after widespread extirpations of north ameri- can beaver during several centuries of intense fur trade, hunting restrictions combined with deliberate reintroductions contributed to successful beaver recovery (pollock et al. 2003). however, restoration of beaver populations also raises new questions for ecosystem management, especially within arid and semi-arid environments (gibson & olden 2014). for example, the introduction and continuing spread of invasive fishes pose a substantial threat to freshwater ecosystems (cucherousset & olden 2011), and it is unclear how native and non-native fish species are using beaver pond habitat, and thus how contempo- rary fish assemblages might respond to changes in the abundance of beaver ponds as beaver return to more of their historical range. beavers are widely recognised as ecosystem engi- neers with major influence on the structure of aquatic ecosystems. beaver dams create distinct lentic habitat patches within the lotic stream corridor;

(salvelinus_fontinalis) (salmo_trutta) community dynamics between native and non- in arid and native fishes are particularly relevant semi-arid rivers of the american southwest. the native fish fauna of the lower colorado river basin (lcrb) is both highly endemic and highly endan- gered (olden & poff 2005): two-thirds of the extant native fish species in arizona, for example, are feder- ally listed under the us endangered species act (turner & list 2007). non-native fishes pose a pri- mary threat to the persistence of the native fish fauna. numerous species have been introduced to the lcrb, and spread of non-native fish has been 356 accompanied by dramatic declines of native fish pop- ulations (olden & poff 2005; rinne & miller 2006). predation by non-native fish on native species, accompanied by competition and indirect effects of predation risk, is considered the primary mechanism for the widespread replacement of native fish (minck- ley et al. 2003). numerous studies have documented direct predation, agonistic interactions and shifts in resource use by native fishes in response to non- natives, including both large-bodied predators and abundant small insectivores (cucherousset & olden 2011). non-native crayfishes (primarily orconectes virilis and procambarus clarkii) have also been intro- duced and spread throughout the lcrb, although historically crayfish were absent from the entire col- orado river basin (martinez 2012; moody & taylor 2012). effective management for conservation of native fish requires understanding how habitat and environmental features can influence their coexis- tence with non-native fish and crayfish. very little is known of the influence of beaver dams on fish assemblages in the lcrb. historically, beaver dams were abundant in parts of the basin (gibson & olden 2014), and presumably beaver ponds would have been occupied by native fishes. current reintroductions of extirpated beaver popula- tions are usually motivated by growing recognition of the potential value of beaver engineering for achiev- ing conservation goals (e.g., fredlake 1997). how- ever, within the contemporary landscape, promotion of beaver dams may also have unexpected conse- quences: natural history and previous studies suggest that the habitat conditions created by beaver ponds are likely to benefit some non-native fishes in the lcrb. many of the common non-native species are associated with pool habitat or slow current velocities (olden et al. 2006; rinne & miller 2006). in a long- term study of fish assemblages in the gila river sys- tem (new mexico), higher densities of non-native fish were associated with low flows and greater abun- dance of pools (propst et al. 2008). rinne and miller (2006) conclude that deep (>2 m) pools provide opti- mum habitat for large non-native predatory fishes such as bass and catfishes, while lack of pools reduces their abundance. additionally, beaver ponds may increase success of non-native fishes by mitigat- ing the effects of extreme high and low flows. deep pools behind beaver dams could promote survival – especially of large-bodied species – through harsh drought conditions, while the physical beaver dam structure from floods. although these hydrological effects of beaver dams would apply to native and non-native fishes alike, non-native fishes lack an evolutionary history with the region’s highly variable streamflow (olden et al. 2006), and thus non-native species might bene- could provide immediate refuge fit disproportionately from mitigation of these hydro- logical disturbances. the strong impacts of non-native fishes on native populations and the potential for beaver ponds to pro- mote non-native species suggest the general hypothe- sis that beaver dams in the lcrb may lead to fish assemblages dominated by non-native species, with potential negative effects on native fishes. in this study, we investigate how beaver ponds influence the structure of mixed native and non-native fish assem- blages in the verde river system in arizona. specifi- cally, we address the following questions: (i) does fish assemblage structure differ between beaver pond and lotic habitat types? (ii) how do native and non- native species differentially occupy these habitats? (iii) do fish assemblage structure and the influence of beaver ponds differ between the mainstem river and its tributary streams? methods study area the verde river, a semi-arid tributary of the lcrb, drains over 17,000 km2 of central arizona (fig. 1). the perennial mainstem river runs approximately 300 km from its headwaters in the big chino wash (elevation = 1325 m) to its confluence with the salt river north of phoenix, az (elevation = 402 m), while numerous perennial tributaries contribute run- off from the southwestern edge of the colorado pla- teau (rinne 2005; blasch et al. 2006). our study region included stream reaches in the upper verde river mainstem and in five major tributaries (fig. 1). the upper verde river is largely free-flow- ing, a rarity for perennial rivers in the desert south- west. however, several diversion dams and small impoundments are present in the watershed, primar- ily on tributaries. development is limited within the verde system, and primary anthropogenic distur- bances are livestock grazing and reduction in base flows as a result of groundwater withdrawals. hydrology in the upper verde river mainstem is characterised by relatively steady, spring-fed base flow, with high-flow events that vary in magnitude and timing among years in response to storm run- off. tributary hydrology, relative to the mainstem, is more variable and includes more snowmelt run-off. mean annual streamflow in the upper mainstem was 1.2 m3s  1 for the period 1963–2004; streamflow in the four perennial and one ephemeral (dry beaver creek) tributaries examined in this study ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 m3s  1 during a similar period of record (1961–2013 and 1981–2013, respectively) (blasch et al. 2006). beavers are common but bea- ver dams are spatially clustered throughout the beaver dams shift desert fish assemblages system (j. agyagos, pers. unpublished data). comm.; p. gibson, the verde river system, especially the headwaters of the mainstem, is an important site for conservation of native fish in arizona (turner & list 2007; pool et al. 2013). at least twelve fish species were native to the system, but the fish assemblage is changing rapidly, and only five native species have been observed since 1997 (rinne 2005). many of the ori- ginal native species have been absent from the verde river system for decades, but federally endangered spikedace (meda fulgida) was last documented in the verde river in 1997, and its current status in the verde system is uncertain. two other small-bodied native species, longfin dace (agosia chrysogaster) and speckled dace (rhinichthys osculus), have become rare in the verde river mainstem, and native roundtail chub (gila robusta) has been proposed for federal listing. numerous non-native fishes are pres- ent in the verde system, including several species of centrarchids, and minnows (table 1; rinne 2005). fish community composition of the verde river varies widely among years, but non-native fish have generally outnumbered natives for the past two decades. management goals for fish assemblages of the upper verde river include main- tenance of current native populations and reintroduc- tion of extirpated species, including spikedace (rinne 2005, 2012). catfishes ictalurid site selection we surveyed fish assemblages in two different habi- tat types within the verde river mainstem and five tributaries: (i) beaver ponds formed by dams across the main stream channel (representing the most com- mon position of dams in this system); and (ii) stream reaches without beaver dams (lotic sites). focusing on stream segments with a high probability of beaver dam presence (as suggested by regional managers), continuous longitudinal census of 64 km of streams in the verde river system located 37 functional (i.e., impounding water) beaver dams in april 2012 (data available http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare. 867703). the highest density of beaver dams and the largest and most complex ponds were located on the mainstem (23 dams in 24.0 km of stream), while dams on the tributaries were less common (14 dams in 40.4 km) and usually smaller than mainstem dams. pond sampling sites (mainstem n = 6; each tribu- tary n = 0–3) were designated proportionally to pond abundance within a given stream (fig. 1); fish sam- pling occurred in the first 100 m upstream of each dam. with one exception, all ponds extended beyond the sampled 100 m: on average, ponds were 180 m at 357 gibson et al. mainstem sites v e r d e r i v e r lotic sites pond sites stream length searched for beaver dams sycamore creek tributary sites k e k c r e a o k e e r c r e v a y b e d r b e a v e r w e t c r e e k west clear creek fig. 1. map of the study area in the verde river system and fish sampling sites, distributed among the mainstem and five tributaries. gray shading indicates stream segments that were searched for beaver dams. long (range = 90–250 m) with a maximum depth of 1.5 m (range = 1.1–2.2 m). lotic sampling sites (mainstem n = 10; each tributary n = 3–4) were dis- tributed throughout the stream segments that had been searched for beaver dams, at distances ranging from 40 to 2650 m to the nearest dam (when dams were present). at each lotic site, we designated a sampling 100 m long (range = 80–115 m), which typically contained 1–2 pool-riffle-run sequences. approximately reach sampling methods we sampled 26 lotic and 12 pond sites during late spring (may–june) 2012. we isolated the ~100 m lotic reaches with block nets (4 mm bar mesh) and sampled with double-pass removal backpack electro- 180–320 v, fishing 30 hz), where 90% of fish and 100% of species were caught after two passes relative to three-pass removal of selected sites (data not shown). a standard effort level of 1200 total seconds (st. dev. = 162 s) was (smith-root model l-24, 358 adjusted as needed to account for length and variable habitat complexity within the reach. all fish captured were identified, enumerated and released alive after electrofishing was complete. in rare instances, fish observed but not captured (i.e., misses or large schools of small fish) were included in counts when the fish could be confidently identified. although electrofishing is somewhat size-selective for larger individuals, this sampling approach is one of the least selective of all active fish capture methods (barbour et al. 1999). additionally, in our study, groups of small fish were often readily visible during sampling, increasing our confidence in the effectiveness of this method for characterising lotic fish communities. for use of too and remote pond sites were typically too large, deep and com- plex to be effectively sampled with backpacking elec- trofishing, boat electrofishing; instead, we followed previous studies (e.g., smith & mather 2013) in using a standardised combination of baited minnow traps (12 minnow traps and 12 crayfish traps set for 12 h at 0.2–1.5 m trammel nets (3 nets, 9.1 9 1.8 m, 0.3 m depth), table 1. our study recorded four native fish species, nine non-native fish species and one non-native crayfish species in the upper verde river mainstem and tributaries. beaver dams shift desert fish assemblages family species† common name native catostomidae cyprinidae non-native centrarchidae cyprinidae ictaluridae poeciliidae salmonidae non-native crayfish cambaridae catostomus clarkii catostomus insignis gila robusta rhinichthys osculus micropterus dolomieu lepomis cyanellus ambloplites rupestris cyprinella lutrensis cyprinus carpio pimephales promelas ameiurus natalis gambusia affinis oncorhynchus_mykiss desert sucker sonora sucker roundtail chub speckled dace smallmouth bass green sunfish rock bass red shiner common carp fathead minnow yellow bullhead western mosquitofish rainbow trout orconectes virilis northern crayfish code‡ cacl cain giro rhos mido lecy amru cylu cyca pipr amna gaaf onmy orvi proportion of sites where species was present all sites n = 38 pond sites n = 12 lotic sites n = 26 0.45 0.42 0.29 0.05 0.89 0.61 0.05 0.37 0.16 0.08 0.29 0.37 0.11 1.00 0.00 0.58 0.25 0.00 0.92 0.83 0.00 0.42 0.33 0.25 0.25 0.50 0.08 1.00 0.65 0.35 0.31 0.08 0.88 0.50 0.08 0.35 0.08 0.00 0.31 0.31 0.12 1.00 †within each family, species are listed in order of commonness. ‡combination of first two letters of genus and first two letters of species. used to indicate species on ordination plots. wall size, 51 mm mesh size, set for 3 h), seine hauls (4 mm mesh, 5 hauls sampling approximately 60 m2 total) and snorkel survey (one person snorkelled full pond perimeter plus one transect down pond centre line; visibility was generally excellent in tributary sites but limited in mainstem sites) to achieve an accurate representation of species occurrence and rel- ative abundance. most of these sampling methods would have been ineffective in our lotic sites: water depth was often too shallow for snorkelling or for effective capture using trammel nets. therefore, we selected sampling methods that maximised efficiency and minimised error in the characterisation of fish assemblages within each habitat type. crayfish were also sampled at all sites. in pond sites, all crayfish captured in seine hauls, minnow traps and crayfish traps were counted; we calculated crayfish catch per unit effort (cpue) for each gear type, as well as the sum total of crayfish caught across all gears at each site. in lotic sites, we used timed d-net (0.5 mm mesh) sweeps to sample cray- fish density along with other benthic macroinverte- brates. the crayfish sample for each lotic site consisted of 10 point samples, covering a total sur- face area of 4 m2 and total sampling effort time of 150 s, in standardised microhabitats from both the upstream and downstream ends of the sampling reach. all crayfish with carapace length ≥3 mm and ≤30 mm (larger crayfish were not sampled effectively with this methodology) were sorted from the sample and counted. statistical analysis sampling effort was constant among all pond sites and among all lotic sites; thus, species abundance for each site was calculated as the total number of indi- viduals of that species captured at the site across all gear types. raw abundances were log-transformed to reduce the influence of highly abundant species and then standardised to relative abundance at each site. using relative rather than raw abundances allowed us to make comparisons between pond and lotic sam- pling sites despite different sampling methods. to examine differences in relative abundance of individ- ual species between pond and lotic sites, we calcu- lated the mean of pond-lotic pairwise differences in relative abundance for each species (separately for mainstem and tributary sites). within pond sites and within lotic sites, we also tested for correlations between abundance of crayfish and abundance of smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu) and of all (abundances non-native log-transformed). combined fishes patterns in multivariate fish assemblage structure were examined using principal coordinate analysis (pcoa; legendre & legendre 1998) of species rela- tive abundances at each site. notably, ordinations using presence–absence data produced qualitatively similar results. pcoa is similar to principal compo- nent analysis (pca), but generalised to allow the use of any ecologically relevant dissimilarity measure. this analysis, we used bray–curtis distance for 359 gibson et al. (which excludes double absences and which is widely used for community abundance data) and corrected for negative eigenvalues. rare species (present in ≤2 sites), which can have a disproportionate effect on multivariate results (gauch 1982), were removed from this analysis. statistical significance of the pcoa axes was determined according to the broken stick rule (p < 0.05; legendre & legendre 1998). raw species correlations with the axes were overlaid as vectors on the ordination plots to examine the con- tribution of individual species to observed patterns in community data. we formally assessed differences between pond and lotic fish assemblage using permutational multi- variate analysis of variance (permanova; anderson 2001). a significant difference identified by this approach may indicate a difference in group mean (i.e., location in pcoa ordination space) or in group variability (i.e., spread in ordination space) or a com- bination of the two. therefore, we also tested for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions between groups (anderson 2006), a multivariate analogue to the univariate levene’s test, to locate the source of any significant differences identified by the perma- nova. this dispersion test computes an f-statistic to compare the average distance between an individ- ual sample and the group centroid defined in the pcoa space of a chosen dissimilarity measure (in our case, bray–curtis dissimilarity). both of these multi- variate tests estimate statistical significance (p value) by permuting the appropriate least-squares residuals. all analyses were performed in r version 2.13.1 (r development core team 2011), using the vegan package 2.0–2 for multivariate community analysis (oksanen et al. 2011). results species occurrence and abundance during our study, we recorded >12,500 individual fish from four native and nine non-native species (table 1). smallmouth bass was the most frequent non-native fish, followed by green sunfish (lepomis cyanellus), western mosquitofish (gambusia affinis) and red shiner (cyprinella lutrensis). desert sucker (catostomus clarkii) was the most frequent native species, found in 45% of sites (table 1). species richness per site varied from 1 to 8 species, with a considerably larger species pool in the verde river mainstem (mean spp. richness  se = 6.1  0.35, range 4–8) than in tributaries (2.7  0.20, range 1– 4). several species were found only in the mainstem: native roundtail chub and non-native western mosqui- tofish, common carp (cyprinus carpio) and fathead minnow (pimephales promelas). additionally, native 360 sonora sucker (catostomus insignis) and non-native red shiner were found primarily in the mainstem but also in one tributary. desert sucker, speckled dace and rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) were present only in lotic samples, while fathead minnow was only found in pond sites. sonora sucker was the only native species frequently found in ponds. speckled dace and rock bass were found only in two lotic sites; these rare species were excluded from multivariate analyses. exception, non-native almost without fishes outnumbered natives in samples (mean = 85% non- native; range = 14–100%), and the non-native frac- tion of the assemblage was consistently greater in pond than in lotic sites, in both mainstem and tribu- tary locations (fig. 2). this difference primarily reflect large numbers of small non-native fish in most pond samples. the greater dominance of non-native fish in ponds was also apparent across individual spe- cies, with the non-native species displaying generally higher relative abundances in ponds, whereas native species were relatively more abundant in lotic sites (fig. 3). the difference abundance between habitat types was especially strong for desert sucker and green sunfish in tributaries. smallmouth bass and, to a lesser extent, yellow bullhead (ameiurus natalis) were the only non-native species whose mean relative abundance was greater in lotic sites than in pond sites at both mainstem and tribu- tary locations. in relative northern crayfish (orconectes virilis) were present at all sites, although density varied widely among both lotic sites (range = 0.3–28.3 individuals per m2) and pond sites (range = 0–37 individuals per minnow trap) (table 2). within pond sites, there was a mar- ginally significant positive relationship between abundance of crayfish and abundance of smallmouth bass (r = 0.55, p = 0.07), but not between crayfish (r = 0.14, and p = 0.66). by contrast, in lotic sites, there was no evidence of a relationship between abundance of crayfish and either smallmouth bass (r =  0.01, combined p = 0.97) (r =  0.24, p = 0.23). non-native non-native combined fish fish all or all fish assemblages multivariate ordination revealed strong differences in fish assemblage structure between mainstem and trib- utary sites (fig. 4a), reflecting the different species pools in the two locations. the first three principal component axes were statistically significant, and col- lectively explained 52% the total variation in fish assemblage. a two-way permanova analysis indi- cated that fish assemblage differed significantly by both location (mainstem vs. tributary) and habitat beaver dams shift desert fish assemblages fig. 2. boxplots showing the distributions of the proportion native fish (lighter shades) and its converse, the proportion non-native fish (darker shades), across lotic sites (left panel) and across pond sites (right panel). distributions are calculated separately for mainstem sites (solid fill) and for tributary sites (hatched fill). fig. 3. mean difference in relative abundance between lotic and pond sites (averaged for all pond site-lotic site pairwise comparisons, within mainstem sites and within tributary sites), for each species recorded in this study (with the exception of speckled dace and rock bass). positive values (i.e., bars above the midline) indicate higher relative abundance in lotic sites than in pond sites, while negative values indicate higher relative abundance in pond sites. error bars show standard error of the mean. type (pond vs. lotic), although location contributed the greater component of variation (table 3). there was no evidence of an interaction effect, nor of any differences in within-group variability. to focus on differences between habitat types, subsequent analy- ses were conducted separately for mainstem and for tributary sites. an ordination of mainstem sites showed modest differentiation between pond and lotic habitat types (fig. 4b);

(2009) found abundant non-native fish (primarily fathead minnow and white sucker, catostomus commersonii) within and downstream of an artificial wetland cre- ated by a small dam on an upper colorado river basin stream (wyoming), while native fishes were restricted to upstream of the wetland and to tributar- ies without impoundments. dominance of non-native fishes within large reservoirs of the lcrb is well established (mueller & marsh 2002), and reservoirs can promote proliferation of non-native species downstream, even without major changes to down- stream flow or regimes (martinez et al. 1994). however, beaver dams are typically smaller, more permeable and much less permanent than artifi- cial analogues, which may affect the direction or mechanism of influences on fish. thermal fish assemblage responses we found that responses to beaver pond habitat var- ied by species. here we focus on the native fishes and the four most common non-native species in our study: smallmouth bass, green sunfish, western mos- quitofish and northern crayfish. smallmouth bass were the most common fish in our study (present in 87% of sites) and often the most abundant large-bodied fish, in both lotic and pond habitat types. in lotic samples, especially, bass often dominated the total fish assemblage. the high num- bers of bass found in both habitat types in our study confirm the habitat flexibility of this species. from a conservation perspective, smallmouth bass are of par- ticular interest because this widespread species is believed to pose a substantial threat to native fishes in the lcrb. a bioenergetics model for the upper verde river identified smallmouth bass as the great- 364 est source of potential piscivory and suggested that non-native control efforts should target this species (bonar et al. 2004). similarly, a bioenergetics model of non-native fishes in the yampa river (upper colo- rado river basin) indicated that the total potential pi- scivory of abundant smallmouth bass exceeded that of two larger but less numerous non-native predators (northern pike, esox lucius, and channel catfish, ict- alurus punctatus) (johnson et al. 2008). green sunfish were frequently present in both lotic and pond habitats, but in lotic sites they were usually present only at low numbers, whereas in ponds they were often highly abundant. this pattern was true for both mainstem and tributary sites. the association of green sunfish with pond habitats is consistent with other studies which report that species of the genus lepomis were common in beaver pond fish assem- blages (snodgrass & meffe 1999; pollock et al. 2003), and with the species’ known habitat prefer- ence for slow current velocity (dudley & matter 2000; olden et al. 2006). presence of green sunfish has been implicated in steep declines of native fish populations in the lcrb (e.g., clarkson et al. 2010). although gut content analysis of green sunfish from the upper verde river found a very low incidence of piscivory (mean 0.61% of stomach content by vol- ume, n = 754; bonar et al. 2004), laboratory and field evidence shows that this species can be an effective predator of larval and juvenile native fishes in the lcrb (dudley & matter 2000; carpenter & increased d15n isotope signatures mueller 2008). from green sunfish relative to native fishes in another arizona river system, the gila river, also demon- strate a strong propensity towards piscivory (pilger et al. 2010). additionally, highly aggressive behav- iour by green sunfish indicates a probable advantage over native fishes in competition for space or food (karp & tyus 1990). these lines of evidence suggest that there is potential for green sunfish to have sub- stantial impacts on native fishes in the verde river system, especially given the high densities of green sunfish that we observed in beaver ponds. western mosquitofish showed a strong association with beaver pond habitat, although high mosquitofish abundances were also observed in some mainstem lotic sites. consistent with our results, preferred mos- quitofish habitat features include shallow water, slow current and dense vegetation (pyke 2008), all typical features of beaver ponds (rosell et al. 2005). mos- quitofish have been widely introduced worldwide (pyke 2008), and, in the lcrb, spread of mosquito- fish is closely associated with declines of the ecologi- cally similar native gila topminnow (poeciliopsis occidentalis) (meffe 1985). laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that agonistic interactions with aggressive mosquitofish can lead to injury, changes in behaviour and reduced growth for native fishes (particularly small-bodied species), and mos- quitofish also prey directly on eggs and larvae of native fish (meffe 1985; mills et al. 2004; ayala et al. 2007). in isolated backwater habitats otherwise free of non-native fish, presence of mosquitofish is believed to be responsible for failed recruitment by stocked native razorback suckers (xyrauchen tex- anus) (ley et al. 2012); we suggest that abundant mosquitofish may similarly impede attempts to restore populations of spikedace in the verde river. in addition to non-native fishes, we observed high densities of non-native northern crayfish within both lotic and beaver pond habitats of the verde river system. this study is one of the first to report abun- dance metrics for crayfish in arizona. in pools of a gila river system tributary stream (arizona), carpen- ter (2005) reported crayfish densities between 3 and 11 large individuals (>25 mm carapace length [cl]) per m2, comparable to our mean densities of 9.3 and 7.4 small individuals (mean cl = 8.4 mm) per m2 in mainstem and tributary sites, respectively. martinez (2012) reported somewhat higher densities (10.9 indi- viduals per m2 in 2005; mean cl = 16.1 mm) in the yampa river (upper colorado river basin), where the total estimated river-wide biomass of crayfish exceeded that of all fish and other invertebrates com- bined. invasive crayfish can have strong impacts on multiple levels of aquatic food webs (twardochleb et al. 2013), and laboratory and field evidence indi- cate that crayfish can compete with and prey on native lcrb fishes directly (carpenter 2005). many non-native fishes consume crayfish (johnson et al. 2008), while the native fishes sampled in this study are more exclusively invertivores/herbivores (olden et al. 2006; pilger et al. 2010), and therefore more likely to compete with crayfish than to prey on them (carpenter 2005; arena et al. 2012). the greatest impact of crayfish on native fishes may be indirect, via apparent competition: abundant crayfish may pro- vide an alternative prey source when small fish have been depleted, thus stabilising large populations of non-native predators. our finding of a positive rela- tionship between crayfish and smallmouth bass abun- dances in ponds is consistent with this hypothesis. in the yampa river, martinez (2012) documented simultaneous large increases in northern crayfish and smallmouth bass populations (along with steep declines in small-bodied native fish). by creating rel- atively stable hydrology and deep pools, beaver ponds may provide favourable habitat for crayfish (e.g., light 2003); the influence of beaver ponds on crayfish populations in the lcrb requires additional investigation. native fishes showed a tendency towards higher abundance in lotic habitats: all four of in general beaver dams shift desert fish assemblages the native species recorded in this study were present in lotic sites, but only sonora sucker and roundtail chub were found in ponds. the two native suckers in our species pool differ in modes of feeding and use of habitat. desert suckers are herbivorous and inhabit predominantly swift-flowing streams with hard-bot- tom substrate, whereas sonora suckers feed on inver- tebrates and detritus and are abundant in deep pools with restricted flow and fine substrate (minckley & marsh 2009). these differences were reflected in findings of our study. desert suckers showed a strong association with lotic habitat: they were frequently present and often relatively abundant in lotic sites, but never found within ponds. sonora suckers, by contrast, were present and occasionally abundant in both habitat types. native roundtail chub, much like sonora suckers, are omnivorous feeders associated with deep pool habitat. however, we rarely found this species in ponds. it is possible that roundtail chub presence or abundance was underestimated in ponds due to size selectivity of sampling methodol- ogy: size frequency data from pond samples (data not shown) suggest that mid-sized fish (approximately 150–300 mm total length) may have been consis- tently under-sampled in ponds. we believe that this is the most important influence of a gear effect in our results. species most likely to have been underesti- mated in this way are roundtail chub, desert sucker, and, to a lesser extent, smallmouth bass. alterna- tively, the rarity of roundtail chub in beaver ponds could reflect unfavourable habitat conditions for these fish, whether due to unique abiotic properties of bea- ver ponds or to the abundant non-native fish. the three small-bodied fish present in the upper verde river within recent decades (longfin dace, speckled dace and spikedace) were not recorded in our study, with the exception of two tributary sites where speckled dace were present. these three spe- cies are generally associated with riffle habitat (minckley & marsh 2009); therefore, it is unlikely that adults would be found in beaver pond habitat, although they might occupy fast tailwaters immedi- ately downstream of dams (smith & mather 2013). extensive conversion of lotic habitat to lentic beaver ponds, as has been documented on the regulated bill williams river, arizona (shafroth et al. 2010), could limit the potential for restoration of these native riffle specialists. this situation occurred on bonita creek, az, where extensive beaver dam activity has resulted in the cessation of stocking efforts for spikedace and loach minnow (rhinichthys cobitis), due in part to a lack of lotic habitat and an increase in abundance of green sunfish (h. blasius, pers. comm.). however, the greatest importance of beaver ponds for native and non-native fish communities in the verde river system may be their function as spawn- 365 gibson et al. ing or rearing habitat for juvenile fish. previous stud- ies have found ontogenetic shifts in fish use of beaver pond habitat, with some species moving into ponds to spawn (schlosser 1998; snodgrass & meffe 1999). schlosser (1995, 1998) further suggests that beaver ponds may function as reproductive ‘sources’ for some species, while adjacent stream reaches are ‘sinks’ with little successful recruitment. beaver ponds often include extensive shallow, vegetated areas with slow current, many of the same features that characterise typical rearing habitat for juvenile lcrb native fishes (childs et al. 1998). backwaters and other off-channel rearing habitats have been the target of restoration activities (minckley et al. 2003), and given the importance of backwaters for success- ful recruitment of native fish, the possibility that bea- ver ponds could provide equivalent rearing habitat conditions is worthy of investigation. however, the abundant non-native fish that we documented within margins and backwaters of beaver ponds may make these areas unsuitable for juvenile native fish (minck- ley et al. 2003; carpenter & mueller 2008). size selectivity of different sampling gears prevents formal analysis of differences in habitat use by life stage in our data. however, we did record young-of-the-year individuals of several native and non-native species (native sonora sucker and non-native smallmouth bass, green sunfish, common carp and yellow bull- these species head) within ponds, suggesting that may sometimes utilise beaver ponds for rearing habitat. variation over time this study provides a snapshot view of fish assem- blage at a single point in time, focusing on the dis- tinction between pond and lotic habitat types. long- term studies of fish assemblage in the verde river and similar systems document substantial interannual variation in absolute and relative abundance of native fishes, especially in response to stream discharge (e.g., rinne 2005; propst et al. 2008). similarly, the response of fish assemblage to beaver pond habitats is likely to vary with time and discharge; therefore, caution should be used in extrapolating results of the present study to different environmental conditions. sampling for this study occurred during may and june, typically the driest months of the year (blasch et al. 2006), and during a drought year; the upper verde river mainstem had not experienced a signifi- cant high-flow event since 2010 (usgs 2013). low flow conditions are of particular importance from the perspective of native fish conservation. numerous studies have correlations between discharge and lcrb native fish abundance (rinne & miller 2006; stefferud et al. 2011). native found strong positive 366 fishes as a group tend to increase in absolute and rel- ative abundance following large peak flows or years with high discharge; conversely, during dry years, non-native species are more likely to become estab- lished and to dominate assemblages, and drought conditions are associated with extirpations of native species (propst et al. 2008; gido et al. 2013). drought and low discharge likely represent critical periods for persistence of native fishes and therefore the most important time to understand the influence of beaver dams and other habitat features on native and non-native assemblage structure. contrasting mainstem and tributary habitats in species pool, habitat features our finding of a strong distinction between fish assemblages of the upper verde river mainstem and its tributaries is consistent with other observed differ- ences between the two locations, including differ- ences and distribution of beaver dams. we found that beaver dams were generally larger and more abundant in the upper mainstem than in the tributaries, and mainstem ponds appeared older and more complex. this may reflect the more stable hydrology in the upper main- stem relative to the tributaries: the number of beaver dams in the upper mainstem tends to increase steadily over several years during periods of moderate dis- charge, until occasional large floods destroy most or all dams (d. campbell, pers. comm.). in verde river tributaries, by contrast, dams are more likely to wash out annually in snowmelt or monsoon floods (k. schonek, pers. comm.), thus preventing enlarge- ment and succession of the beaver pond habitat over multiple years. it seems likely that longevity of bea- ver ponds may affect their ecological function, and several studies have demonstrated that fish assem- blage in beaver pond habitats varies with pond age (snodgrass & meffe 1998; schlosser & kallemeyn 2000). however, despite differences in hydrology and pond stability, we observed some consistent pat- terns in individual species’ response to pond habitat in both the mainstem and tributaries. net effects of beaver ponds on fish communities in this study, we documented patterns of presence and abundance for native and non-native fish within beaver ponds as compared to unimpounded lotic stream reaches. our results point to further questions about the consequences of these patterns (also see gibson & olden 2014): what will be the net effect of beaver dams on fish populations in the verde river system and similar desert rivers? beaver dams and ponds are complex landscape features that alter numerous different aspects of aquatic ecosystems at beaver dams shift

(pollock et al. 2003; rosell et al. 2005). some of these beaver dam effects may be ben- eficial to fishes while others are detrimental; some effects may influence native fishes differently than they do non-native fishes; and the overall effect of dams on native fishes may vary depending on whether non-natives are present. this complexity makes it difficult to distinguish the mechanisms by which beaver dams produce observed responses in fish communities. in table 4, we address this com- plexity separate hypotheses about how each type of beaver dam effect is likely to influence native and non-native fish popu- lations in the lcrb. our intention is that this chart will help to guide and organise thinking about how and why beaver dams influence fish communities; additionally, these hypotheses may suggest profitable directions for future research. in the following discus- sion, we expand on some of the particularly impor- tant or interesting hypotheses. systematically formulating by at the scale of individual beaver ponds (table 4, ‘direct habitat effects’), a better understanding is needed of how fish use of pond habitat varies with season, environmental conditions and life stage; iden- tifying which species may be employing beaver ponds for spawning or rearing habitat would be par- ticularly valuable. fish use of beaver pond habitat likely also varies with physical habitat features of ponds, such as pond size or location within the river system (e.g., snodgrass & meffe 1998). however, the net effect of utilising beaver pond habitat will depend on the degree of biotic interactions occurring in these habitats, and whether beaver ponds tend to increase or decrease negative interactions between native and non-native fishes. beaver ponds generally increase habitat complexity relative to unimpounded stream, in terms of both channel morphology (e.g., secondary channels, overbank flooding; kemp et al. 2012; smith & mather 2013) and habitat structure (e.g., aquatic vegetation, large wood; pollock et al. 2003). habitat complexity may provide refuge from predation and increase spatial segregation between native and non-native fishes, thus reducing negative interactions (crowder & cooper 1982; meffe 1985; billman et al. 2012). however, if beaver pond habi- tats also support significantly higher densities of non- native fish than do unimpounded stream reaches, then this could override any advantages of habitat struc- ture for native fish (table 4, point b). in particular, use of beaver pond margins by native fishes as rear- ing habitat could increase predation on vulnerable native fish larvae when, as in our results, these areas also support abundant small non-native fishes. some habitat features of beaver ponds are also found in natural stream pools: fish preferring deep water and reduced current velocity will likely make beaver dams shift desert fish assemblages use of both habitat types (table 4, point a). how- ever, the complexity and habitat structure of beaver ponds are not associated with natural pools, and flooding behind beaver dams increases channel width and often includes abundant shallow grassy area (table 4, point b; rosell et al. 2005). beaver dams can greatly increase retention of sediment and organic matter (table 4, point c). this retentiveness, together with the more open canopy and addition of woody debris due to beaver foraging, affects nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes within ponds, which in turn influences the biotic communities (table 4, points f-g; naiman et al. 1986; rosell et al. 2005). the beaver dam itself provides a potential barrier to movement of fish and other organisms, creating a more closed system than a natural pool (table 4, point j). finally, although an individual beaver pond may be no bigger than an average stream pool, often multiple beaver dams are constructed within a small area, forming a very large complex of continuous beaver pond habitat (rosell et al. 2005). future research should seek to clarify which, if any, of these unique habitat features are most influential for fish species of interest. (table 4, stream network the influence of beaver dams on fish assemblages can also extend beyond the pond itself to the rest of the ‘drainage-level effects’). fish from beaver pond assemblages may spill over into neighbouring stream reaches (schlosser 1998; snodgrass & meffe 1999). beaver ponds can provide source habitat for some species, as discussed earlier. in general, beaver ponds promote fish species richness at the drainage level by supporting species that otherwise might not persist in unmodified habitat (e.g., hanson & campbell 1963; snodgrass & meffe 1998; smith & mather 2013), but this effect may be undesirable if it is the richness of non-native species that is increased (table 4, point k). beatty et al. (2009), who documented abundant non-native fish within and downstream of an artificial impoundment on a wyoming stream, suggest that this impoundment provided source habitat for the non-native fish, noting that tributary streams lacking any impoundments were instead dominated by native fishes. the abundant green sunfish and western mosquitofish recorded within ponds in our study suggest that beaver ponds could similarly provide source habitat for these small lentic fishes in the verde river system. however, we found no evidence for a correlation between distance from a pond and abundance of these or any other spe- cies (unpublished results); additionally, thriving popu- lations of non-native species streams without beaver activity (e.g., fossil creek, arizona; m. o’neill, pers. obs.; marks et al. 2010) indicate that beaver pond habitats are not essential to their life his- tory. nonetheless, beaver ponds could promote higher in similar 369 gibson et al. abundances of these fish or increase their resistance or resilience to disturbance. finally, the degree to which beaver ponds influence fish populations will also depend on the abundance and distribution of ponds and other pool habitat within a river system. pond habitat in systems where beaver ponds are abundant or where ponds pro- vide a unique habitat type (table 4, point k), espe- cially when other pool habitat is scarce. is likely to be more influential within desert river systems like the verde river, the influence of beaver ponds on fish assemblage response to large-scale disturbance by drought and floods is of particular interest. previous studies have suggested that beaver ponds can provide refuge habi- tat for fish during drought and seasonal low flows (table 4, point i; hanson & campbell 1963; magou- lick & kobza 2003; white & rahel 2008). this func- tion may be particularly important in intermittent tributary streams, especially with projected decreases in perennial surface flow due to water withdrawals and climate change (marshall et al. 2010). in ephem- eral dry beaver creek in our study, we observed large native sonora suckers within deep pools that had been expanded by beaver dams. however, con- centrating fish within small refuge habitats typically increases the intensity of biotic interactions (magou- lick & kobza 2003): enforced habitat overlap between non-native predators and vulnerable native fishes within ponds could lead to extensive predation and other negative interactions, such that native fishes would derive no net benefit from the refuge habitat. beaver dams may also provide fish some protection from floods or peak flows (kemp et al. 2012), poten- tially speeding recolonisation of a drainage by non- native species following the flood (table 4, point h; pool & olden 2014). future research should address the ability of beaver ponds to provide refuge from these disturbances, and the relative impact of that ref- uge on native and non-native fishes. ultimately, the consequences of beaver dam-building activity for native fish populations will depend on the extent to which a dam’s influence extends beyond the pond: if beaver ponds support a high density of non-native fish only within the pond itself, then the net impact on native fish populations at the drainage level may be negligible. however, if abundant non- native fish spill over into adjacent stream reaches, or if beaver ponds promote reproduction and maintain source populations of non-native species, then beaver dams could have far-reaching consequences for the overall composition of the fish assemblage. acknowledgements we thank l. kuehne and j. walters for essential field assis- tance. we also thank k. schonek of the nature conservancy 370 for providing useful
