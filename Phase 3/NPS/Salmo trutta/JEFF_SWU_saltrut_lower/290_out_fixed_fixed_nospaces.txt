knowledge of maturation state of eels (anguilla anguilla, l.) based on ocular index (oi) serves management and research functions, such as estimating how much silver eel actually could escape from a particular basin or determining more precisely the developmental biology of a particular eels. oi implies the measurements of ﬁve variables (total length and eyes diameters) in a formula which can be sensitive to measurement error. to investigate this issue, we carried out a comparative study using 13 european eels harvested in camargue (rhoˆne delta, france) and three replicated measurements by three different observers. the estimated amplitude of oi imprecision at a 95% conﬁdence level was 1.8 whatever eel and observer. such error may lead to classiﬁcation problems particularly when oi values are close to the threshold values used to discriminate between yellow and silver stages. this study not only raised the problem of the oi imprecision but also brought up the need to develop standardised protocol for identifying silver eels. to reach this goal, two different ways are proposed in conclusion. key words: anguilla anguilla; ocular index; measurement error; silvering a. acou,

anthony.acou@univ-rennes1.fr accepted for publication may 2, 2006 introduction in the context of a drastic decline of eel population anguilla anguilla (l.) throughout its distribution range, from iceland to morocco, it seems fundamental to characterise the continental stock of eel and the maturation dynamics (i) with the long-term aim of estimating how much silver eel actually escape from a particular basin (moriarty & dekker 1997) (ii) and the ﬁnal goal to predict the escapement while looking at the yellow eel population and the silvering fraction (feunteun et al. 2000; acou et al. in press). the study of maturation dynamics implies the assessment of maturation state of the eels between the growth phase (yellow eel) and the seaward migration phase (silver eel). silver eels are characterised by a very contrasting colour pattern with a blackish brown back and a silvery white belly (fontaine 1994), and there is a general increase in the size of sensory organs like the eyes (pankhurst 1982; fontaine 1994). ocular index (oi) which reﬂects changes in eye diameter during the metamorphosis has proved to be a useful criterion for assessing quantitatively the degree of transformation of the eel (durif et al. 2000). furthermore, the relation- ship between eye size and gonad development in female anguilla provides a reliable method of asses- sing sexual maturity in female eels (pankhurst 1982). to discriminate between yellow and silver states, threshold values of oi have been calculated and varied between 6.5 (pankhurst 1982) and 8.0 (marchelidon et al. 1999; acou et al. 2003). oi implies the meas- urements of ﬁve variables (total length, vertical and horizontal ocular diameters of both eyes) in a formula which can be sensitive to measurement errors. meas- urement error includes two components: bias and imprecision (grubbs 1973). bias corresponds to consistent differences among observers. imprecision corresponds to variability in repeated measures. yet, an underlying assumption of classiﬁcation methods based on morphological measurements is that such measurements are repeatable. in the present paper, we aim to test this assumption by answering the 578 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00189.x two following questions: how measurements of one eel vary among different observers (observer bias)? how successive measurements of one eel may vary within one observer (imprecision)? materials and methods data collection the experiment involved three observers having experience with ﬁsh measurements and referred to as x, y and z. measures were made on 13 individuals randomly sampled from eels collected in the fume- morte drainage basin (south france, rhoˆne delta, acou et al. 2003) using fyke nets in february 2002. each eel had been previously individually marked with a passive integrated transponder (pit) tag. three rounds of measurements corresponding to the three replicates were successively organised. in each round, each observer measured every eel once. for each measurement, the experiment manager randomly chose an eel among the eels to be measured, identiﬁed it and gave it to an observer for measurements. before each round of measurement, eels were anaesthetised with )1. to ensure benzocaine at a concentration of 0.15 gæl independence of measurements, measurements from the previous sessions were not available to observers during the next one. moreover, observers did not communicate with each other, and they were visually isolated from each other while taking measurements. the marked increase of eye size during metamor- phosis was expressed using an oi that relates the external surface area of the eye to total body length (pankhurst 1982). it was calculated using the follow- ing formula: oi ¼ 25p=8ltfðdrv þ drhþ2 þ ðdlv þ dlhþ2g; the vertical and horizontal where lt is the total length, drv and drh are, right eye respectively, diameters, dlv and dlh are, respectively, the vertical and horizontal left eye diameters. measurements of lt (snout to the tip of tail) were made with the same ichthyometer (i.e., a ruler ﬁxed in the bottom of a gutter), at the nearest millimetre. measurement of the eye diameters were made with a standard manual calliper, at the nearest 0.02 mm. measurement of horizontal and vertical eye diameters are made from the margins formed by the pigmented area adjacent to the unpigmented conjunctiva (see acou et al. 2005 for more details). data analysis as recommended by bailey & byrnes (1990), model ii anova (statsoft inc. 2001) was used to partition the measurement error in eel ocular index variance into three components: among-eel, among- observer and error. the among-eel component corre- sponds to actual morphological differences among eels. the among-observer component corresponds to observer bias. the error term corresponds to within- observer variance, which estimates the overall imprecision (rasmussen et al. 2001). additional tests were needed to determine if the imprecision varied among eels (for instance, imprecision could be related to eel size) and among observers (one observer could be more precise than another). levene’s test of homogeneity of variances was computed on residuals from the anova model to compare residual variance among eels and among observers. if residual variance was neither signiﬁcantly different among eels nor among observers, imprecision was estimated by residual variance of the anova model with a 95% conﬁdence interval (sokal & rohlf 1989). after checking that residual variables had normal distribu- tions (kolmogorov–smirnov test), the residual vari- ance estimate was used to estimate the amplitude of ﬂuctuation (at a 95% conﬁdence level) of a measure- ment value (for a given observer and a given eel) due to imprecision. this amplitude (a) was estimated as follows: a ¼ 2  1:96  sr; where sr is the square root of the estimated residual variance (sokal & rohlf 1989). considering the conﬁdence limits of the residual variance estimate, a conﬁdence interval could be calculated for the estimation of the amplitude of measurement ﬂuctua- tion. results mean eel body length ranged from 364 to 680 mm. mean eel oi ranged from 4.4 to 11.9 (mean values over the 3 observers ·3 replicates ¼ 9 measurements). for each morphological variable, the observer and eel effects were signiﬁcant, revealing both signiﬁcant observer bias and differences among eels (table 1). compared to the others, observer z systematically overestimated each morphological variable, while observer y tended to underestimate them (table 2). among the three observers, the maximum difference in mean oi was 1.6. however, because of the limited number of observers (n ¼ 3), the magnitude of observer bias could not be estimated. distributions of residual variables were not signiﬁ- cantly different from normal distributions (kolmogo- rov–smirnov tests, p > 0.05). residual variance was signiﬁcantly different neither among eels, nor among observers (table 3). therefore, a unique residual variance could be estimated for each morphological variable. the estimated amplitude of imprecision was 579

use, been given in the literature to skew caused by the use of quantitative criteria of silvering (oi) in eels. our study is the ﬁrst one that aims to estimate overall measurement error (bias and imprecision) linked to the use of oi (pankhurst 1982), the most commonly used quantitative criterion. measurement conditions in this study could be considered as optimal as measurements were made in the laboratory (not in the ﬁeld) on fully anaesthetised eels with standard measuring devices. moreover, the three observers involved in the experiment had a great experience in ﬁsh measurements. as a consequence, the measurement error (bias and imprecision) observed could be considered as minimal. in some research situations, it may be possible to eliminate observer bias if a single investigator makes all measurements (eason et al. 1996). however, this may not be always possible in large-scale studies. in our experiment, observer bias tended to be consistent in rank over morphological variables. we assumed that such consistency does not come from differences in variables deﬁnitions according to observers, as they were clearly mentioned before the experimentation, but rather in the way they perform their measurements. for example, observer z systematically overestimated each morphological variable (eyes measurements and lt) compared to the others. while observers x and y made their measurements on eels placed on a horizontal surface, observer z held eels to perform them (calliper in one hand and eel in the other one). before the study, we expected signiﬁcant observer effect for ocular measurements as they are time-expensive and rather tedious to make in routine. on the contrary, the observed results concerning the lt are slightly puzzling because measurement of body length is simple. once again, observer z did not perform length measurements with the ichthyometer set horizontally on the board but held it leaning downwards so as to easily proceed with the measurements. moreover, observer z always measured the eyes and lt faster than observers x and y to simulate ﬁeld conditions (i.e., with a limited time to handle each individual). thus, this skew was certainly caused by the short time and the particular way observer z performed the measurements. to minimise oi bias, we consequently suggest performing measurements (lt and eyes diameters) on horizontally lying eels and taking time to achieve them. because of the limited number of observers (n ¼ 3), the magnitude of observer bias could not be estimated. amplitude of imprecision at 95% conﬁdence level in oi measurement was estimated about 1.8, whatever the eel and the observer. a similar observer bias and imprecision is expected from inexperienced team. therefore, the amplitude of oi imprecision estimated in this study could be considered as a low value comparing to other places where this method is used. such a measurement error may lead to classiﬁcation problems when oi threshold values, considered as the only quantitative method for identifying silvering, are used for eel stock assessment. moreover, errors should have more consequences when oi measurements are close to the threshold values used to discriminate between yellow and silver stages. as the increase of oi is a gradual phenomenon that starts at the yellow stage (marchelidon et al. 1999), important overlaps occur between eels (yellow and silver) around the oi threshold values during sampling of sedentary population fraction in late summer or in autumn (cottrill et al. 2002). finally, our study not only raised the problem of the oi imprecision. it also brought up the need to establish and test a standardised protocol for identifying candi- date silver eels that will undergo catadromous migra- tion in the following year, among the sedentary fraction of a subpopulation (feunteun et al. 2000). if the oi criterion is used alone, standardisation consists of minimising the oi measurement error particularly around the ‘sensitive’ boundaries of the oi threshold values. for that, further large-scale investigations on eel population (i.e., with more numerous observers and eels) must be led in order to precisely assess error measurement according to observer experimentation level and/or characteristics of eels (sex, size and stage). however, such a study seems from our opinion not very ‘cost-effective’ because it must take into account besides what we mentioned other numerous factors that may inﬂuence error measurements too: work places (on the ﬁeld or in laboratory), ﬁeld conditions (rainy or cold weather), number of eels for measurements (the imprecision may increase with time), etc. another alternative way to proceed is to develop a multicriteria method that aims to reduce the inﬂuence of oi measurement and its related error for eel stage classiﬁcation by the use of additional qualitative criteria of silvering. of course, basic precautions such as presented in this study (e.g., well-anaesthetised and horizontally held eels, use of standard measurement measurement error in eel ocular index devices, time for non-experimented observers, etc.) must be taken in order to limit oi error measurements. likewise, additional qualitative criteria of silvering must be clearly deﬁned in order to limit subjectivity between investigators. such a multicriteria method that combines one quantitative (oi measurement) and precise description of two qualitative criteria (state of differentiation of the lateral line and colour contrast) variables was developed and validated (see acou et al. 2005 for further details). acknowledgements we thank ce´line arzel, abdelhamid azeroual and pascal contournet for their help and gae¨tan lefevre for his helpful comments.
