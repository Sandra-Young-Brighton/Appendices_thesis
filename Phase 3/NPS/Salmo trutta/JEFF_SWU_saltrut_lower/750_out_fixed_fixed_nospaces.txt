(2003) for the widespread salmonids atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta). successful recruitment in such species requires their access to in contrast, spawning grounds in appropriate condition, for which an absence of excessive fine sediments is a critical requirement. the lacustrine spawning grounds of these and other lithophiles have received much less attention. although a few studies have investigated aspects of the lake spawning habitats of the salmonids arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) (jonsson & hindar 1982), (salvelinus_namaycush) (gunn & sein 2000) and brook_trout lake_trout correspondence: h. miller, school of ocean and earth science, university of southampton, national oceanography centre southampton, southampton, so14 3zh, uk. e-mail: helen.miller@noc.soton.ac.uk. 32 doi: 10.1111/eff.12122 distribution, characteristics and condition of arctic charr spawning grounds fontinalis) (salvelinus (blanchfield & ridgway 2005), such detailed lacustrine investigations remain sparse for salmonids in general (klemetsen et al. 2003; winfield 2004). have (2011) recently, low et al. partially addressed this lack of information for lacustrine litho- philic spawners by describing the littoral spawning habitats of the holarctic arctic charr in three lakes in ireland. using a combination of fyke netting and snorkelling, the physical characteristics of 23 discrete spawning sites were described as narrow strips of hard substrates with clean interstitial spaces running parallel to the shore at a maximum depth of 1.2 m. the lacustrine spawning ecology of arctic charr pop- ulations is further complicated by the fact that although many populations spawn in the littoral zone, some spawn at greater depths (klemetsen et al. 2003). furthermore, some lakes support both shal- low- and deep-spawning populations, making this species of great interest for studies of evolutionary biology (e.g., adams et al. 2006; corrigan et al. 2011a). within-lake diversity in arctic charr spawn- ing depth has been reported for a number of lakes in europe and north america, including within the fax€alven water system in sweden where shallow- water spawning (8–10 m) and deep-water spawning (up to c. 100 m depth) on a stony bottom were first described by m€a€ar (1949). in the twin-basin lake of windermere, uk, the first detailed observations of arctic charr spawning in shallow and deep areas were made by frost (1965). on the basis of netting, observations by divers and local knowledge, frost (1965) concluded that win- dermere’s shallow spawning grounds ranged from 1 to 3 m depth and were used during the autumn (mainly november), while the deeper spawning grounds ranged from 15 to 20 m depth and were used during the spring (mainly february to march). the spawning substrate for shallow-water sites was described as always hard with a range of particle sizes from sand through to large stones or small boul- ders up to 0.25 m in diameter, with some locations also having a little silt or a few macrophytes in the form of littorella sp. deep-water sites, based only on detailed descriptions spawning ground of holbeck point, were characterised by frost (1965) as having a stony bottom. from the single an improved understanding of arctic charr spawn- ing grounds is critical for the better management of this species, whether it be for fisheries purposes or biodiversity conservation. at a global level, the status and conservation of this widespread species have given concern for some time (maitland 1995). more specifically within the british isles, several arctic charr populations have already been lost and many more are threatened (igoe et al. 2003; maitland et al. 2007; winfield et al. 2010), including that of win- dermere (winfield et al. 2008). notably, igoe et al. (2003) emphasised the susceptibility of this species’ shallow littoral spawning grounds to exposure due to falling lake levels or siltation by fine sediments. in particular, eutrophication has the potential to produce major impacts on littoral spawning fish due to associ- ated increases in fine sediments of algal origin depos- ited on stones, gravels and other substrates (winfield 2004). moreover, such sedimentation is likely to be even greater on deeper spawning grounds due to sed- iment accumulation processes (mackay et al. 2012). in the face of this lack of fundamental knowledge and widespread conservation concerns, low et al. (2011) understandably called for long-term monitor- ing and comparisons of arctic charr spawning site habitats amongst lakes of differing conditions such as nutrient loading. the objectives of this study were to assess the cur- rent conditions of the demonstrated or putative arctic charr spawning grounds of windermere initially described by frost (1965) but subsequently largely unstudied for approximately 50 years. during this period, the lake has undergone significant eutrophica- tion, particularly in its south basin (jones et al. 2008; winfield et al. 2008), and its arctic charr population has declined (winfield et al. 2010). this assessment was accomplished using multibeam bathymetry, underwater video observations and the collation of historical and contemporary netting information on spawning arctic charr. materials and methods study site windermere is situated (54°22′n, 2°56′w; altitude 39 m) in the english lake district, uk. it comprises a mesotrophic north basin (area 8.1 km2, maximum depth 64 m) and a eutrophic south basin (area 6.7 km2, maximum depth 44 m). the cultural eutro- phication of the latter basin accelerated markedly in the mid-1960s due to nutrient enrichment attributed to a combination of growing human population in the catchment, changes in agricultural practice and increased sewage discharge (parker & maberly 2000). in recent years, the south basin has shown some response to the introduction in 1992 of tertiary chemical stripping of phosphate at the lake’s sewage treatment plants (winfield et al. 2008). the fish com- munity is relatively simple with arctic charr, atlantic salmon, brown_trout, european eel (anguilla anguilla), perch (perca fluviatilis), pike (esox lucius) and in recent years roach (rutilus rutilus) dominating it, although a number of minor species are also present (winfield et al. 2011). 33 miller et al. hydroacoustic survey of the lake bottom a multibeam bathymetry of the lake bottom was pro- duced in september 2010 using a simrad kongs- berg em3002d dual head system operating at 300 khz on the british geological survey vessel r/ v white ribbon, providing 100% coverage of both the north and south basins in areas where water depth exceeded 5 m (miller et al. 2013). coverage of shal- lower areas was limited by technical constraints. the resulting hydroacoustic data were gridded at a resolu- tion of 1 m and corrected to ordnance datum new- lyn using lake-level data from an electronic gauge operated by the environment agency. processed data were exported as xyz coordinates for subsequent analysis in arcgis version 10, where slope, aspect, curvature and hillshade were derived using the spa- tial analyst extension, and subsequently used to cal- culate the area and depth range of each of the demonstrated or putative spawning grounds described by frost (1965) by digitising them from the latter’s fig. 1. physical survey of the lake bottom sixty-nine sediment samples from the lake bed (33 in the north basin and 36 in the south basin) were collected in june 2011 using a 2 l van veen f42a grab as described in detail in miller et al. (2013). visual descriptions and grain size analysis were used to identify a number of distinct lake bed facies, that is, gyttja (composed of fine to very coarse organic- rich, olive-green silt), fine sand and gravel. gyttja is the most prevalent lake bed sediment and covers more than 95% of the lake bed (miller et al. 2013). outcrops of bedrock were also identified through underwater video observations (see below). finely laminated mud, visual survey of the lake bottom images of two remotely operated vehicles (rovs) were used on visual survey in june 2011, april 2012 and may 2013 to record visual the lake bed (fig. 1). the rovs were a seabotix lbv 150-4 minirov using a usbl system for precise posi- tioning information, deployed primarily on offshore transects and a videoray pro 3 xegto deployed primarily on inshore transects. the two rovs sur- veyed a total of 53 transects (33 in the north basin and 20 in the south basin) typically running from shallower to deeper water (fig. 1) to facilitate the examination of areas of less than 5 m depth which had not been covered by the hydroacoustic survey. video outputs from both rovs, including their operating depths, were recorded and subsequently 34 used to produce series of representative still images for each transect. within the rov survey, single transects each of approximately 100 m in horizontal extent running out perpendicularly from the shore at the demon- strated or putative spawning grounds of frost (1965) at holbeck point, low wray bay and north thompson holme in the north basin and baswicks, blake holme, bellman landing, stewardson nab, south rawlinson nab and tower wood in the south basin undertaken in may 2013 were subjected to a further systematic examination. following the procedure described by coyle and adams (2011) for vendace (coregonus_albula) spawning habitat requirements, which are similar to those of arctic images were produced charr, depth-stratified still and classified as optimal, sub-optimal or poor spawning habitat. this assessment procedure is based on the presence of hard substrate types such as gravels, pebbles, cobbles and boulders, but also takes into account the presence of fine sediments which are unsuitable for spawning by lithophilic species. such assessments of a total of 92 depth- stratified specific sites along the transects were pooled by basin into 0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20 and 21–25 m depth bands. collation of information on use of demonstrated or putative spawning grounds and other areas information on the historic and contemporary use by arctic charr of the demonstrated or putative spawning grounds described by frost (1965) and other potential spawning grounds was collated from published and unpublished studies, primarily by gill netting, under- taken during the autumn and spring-spawning peri- ods. published sources comprised frost (1965), kipling and le cren (1975), kipling (1984), parting- ton and mills (1988), winfield et al. (2008), corrigan (2009) and corrigan et al. (2011a), with most of these studies involving sampling in both the north and south basins. these observations were aug- mented by further and generally more recent informa- tion from a total of 60 netting events undertaken by some of the present authors between 1993 and 2012 (ijw, unpublished data). together, the above collated information covered all of the six north basin and six south basin demon- strated or putative spawning grounds described by frost (1965) together with an additional two north basin and seven south basin locations containing potential spawning grounds, making a total of 21 locations. given differing gill net designs and sam- pling effort, these data are interpreted here simply as the local presence or absence of spawning arctic charr. distribution,

demonstrated or putative spawning grounds areas of the demonstrated or putative spawning grounds ranged from 28,150 m2 (autumn-spawning ground of blake holme) to 186,800 m2 (autumn- spawning ground of

ground of balla wray) (table 1). gravels, stones and/or cobbles were present at all the north basin demonstrated or putative spawning grounds with the exception of the spring-spawning ground of meregarth, which lies at a depth of 17.4– 40.8 m and at which only gyttja was observed (table 2, fig. 2). even when present, with one exception, such hard substrates were always restricted to <5.0 m

sites, and gravels and cobbles were either absent or restricted to a maximum of 2.4 m depth (table 3, fig. 3). the exception to this was the autumn-spawn- ing ground of stewardson nab, where scattered cob- bles and boulders were found up to 15.0 m depth. observations of substrate characteristics were made only at north tower wood among the further seven locations in the south basin investigated as potential spawning grounds, where gravels and cobbles were found at up to 1.2 m depth. specific spawning requirements, appropriate contemporary spawning habitat was rel- atively limited within the demonstrated or putative spawning grounds of both basins but particularly so in the south basin (fig. 4). in the north basin, optimal and sub-optimal spawning habitats together comprised 42% of observations from the 0 to 5 m depth band and were recorded only at the autumn- spawning grounds of low wray bay and north thompson holme. sub-optimal spawning habitat in the 21–25 m this basin also occupied 86% of depth observations were restricted to the spring-spawning ground of hol- beck point. in the south basin, optimal and sub-op- timal spawning habitats were restricted to the 0– 5 m depth band where they comprised 12% of observations and were restricted to the autumn- band, although such 36 spawning grounds of baswicks, blake holme, stewardson nab and tower wood. note that tran- sects in the south basin did not encounter any depths beyond 20 m. historic and contemporary use of demonstrated or putative spawning grounds and other areas in the north basin, of the six demonstrated or putative spawning grounds described by frost (1965), autumn spawning has only been observed at three sites (low wray bay, north thompson holme and red nab) since the 1980s, and spring spawning at one site (holbeck point) as recently as 2006. in addition, two sites have been newly described (high wray bay and south rough holme) since 2004. in the south basin, of the six demonstrated or puta- tive spawning grounds described by frost (1965), autumn spawning has only been observed at two sites (baswicks and tower wood) in 2006, and spring spawning at one site (south rawlinson nab) in 2006. in addition, seven autumn-spawning sites have been newly described (beech hill sheds, east grass holme, north grass holme, north tower wood, north-west grass holme, south grass holme and west grass holme) since 1993, while spring-spawners have been found at one site (east grass holme). discussion the present study assessed the current condition of 12 arctic charr spawning grounds in windermere first described by frost (1965) after a period of approximately 50 years of eutrophication. in particu- lar, the extent of arctic charr investigations at this lake and the differential impact of eutrophication in its north and south basins together provide a unique opportunity to address the call of low et al. (2011) for long-term comparisons of this species’ spawning habitats under contrasting conditions of nutrient load- ing. furthermore, population monitoring has shown that arctic charr abundance has fallen markedly in the lake’s two basins in recent years and particularly so in its more eutrophicated south basin (winfield et al. 2010). in this basin, since the early 2000s, the catch-per-unit-effort of recreational anglers has been consistently and considerably below that recorded at the time of frost (1965), but in the north basin it has remained at a similar level. previous studies of this decline have considered the potential effects of reduced oxygen availability (jones et al. 2008), a recent increase in the potential competitor roach (ru- tilus rutilus) (winfield et al. 2008; corrigan et al. 2011b), climate change (winfield et al. 2010) and changing predation pressure from pike (winfield et al. 2012). however, the present investigation is the distribution, characteristics and condition of arctic charr spawning grounds table 2. substrate characteristics in the north basin of windermere (from physical and visual surveys) and evidence of historic and contemporary use (from published sources and additional netting information) of six demonstrated or putative arctic charr spawning grounds described by frost (1965) and (where available) a further two locations containing potential spawning grounds (in italics). substrate characteristics evidence of use from published sources evidence of use from additional netting described as a probable autumn-spawning ground on basis of local knowledge (frost 1965);

(2013). in terms of the requirement of spawning arctic charr for clean hard substrate largely devoid of fine sediments, the present observations give considerable cause for concern for parts of windermere. the results suggest suitable spawning habitat within the demonstrated or putative spawning areas is limited. in the north basin, sub-optimal and optimal condi- tions were together widespread in areas of up to 5 m depth. sub-optimal conditions were also evident at depths of 21–25 m in this basin’s deep-water spawn- ing ground of holbeck point. however, in the south basin, both sub-optimal and optimal conditions com- prised only a small proportion of observations and were never recorded at depths beyond 5 m. certainly, in the early 2010s, no demonstrated or putative arc- tic charr spawning sites in the south basin could be described as having at most ‘a little silt’ as was the case 50 years ago (frost 1965). the present observations and local knowledge from over 50 years ago presented by frost (1965) 40 distribution, characteristics and condition of arctic charr spawning grounds have resulted in the increase in fine sediments observed in the south basin. increased fluvial deposi- tion, for example, arising from riverine erosion or landslides in the catchment, may greatly increase the amount of fine sediments on spawning grounds in lakes. although a recent extensive fluvial audit of the windermere catchment found relatively little fine sediment currently originating from such sources (barlow et al. 2009a), local sediment sourcing, transfer and storage processes have been altered by the historical modification of river reaches in the middle and lower catchment and that future management of rivers and riparian land should aim to allow and embrace natural processes (barlow et al. 2009b). it was concluded that in contrast spawning grounds to the limited anthropogenic impacts arising from the above factors, the effects of eutrophi- cation are more likely to have been responsible for the general deterioration inferred in the condition of arctic charr in windermere. as noted by maitland (1995), igoe et al. (2003), maitland et al. (2007), low et al. (2011) and many others, increased algal production generated by eutro- phication frequently manifests itself as increased fine sediments of algal origin deposited on stones, gravels and other substrates. for windermere, the local pat- tern of eutrophication matches the observed deteriora- tion in the condition of spawning grounds both temporally and spatially. in terms of timing, the initial description of demonstrated or putative spawning grounds by frost (1965) was made in the early 1960s before the lake underwent marked eutrophication and while its limited effects were still similar in the two basins. for example, at this time, the mean concentra- tions of soluble reactive phosphorus during the first 4 weeks of the year varied between 2 and 5 mgm  3 in both basins (winfield et al. 2008). in contrast, the present observations were made after a 30-year period of significant eutrophication such that by the early 2000s, levels in the north basin had increased to 4– 10 mgm  3 but in the south basin they had reached 10–20 mgm  3 and had been higher (winfield et al. 2008). in terms of spatial differences between the two basins, we infer that a deterioration in the condition of demonstrated or putative spawning grounds is more marked in the more eutrophicated south basin (winfield et al. 2008), which now exhibits a bottom covering of fine sediments even in large parts of its shallowest areas. although the problem of eutrophica- tion has been addressed by phosphate stripping of wastewater discharges since 1992, this action has only been partially successful and neither basin of windermere has yet been returned to the conditions of the 1960s or earlier (winfield et al. 2008). the present study also assembled published and unpublished information from a considerable body of 41 fig. 4. the relative occurrence (expressed as percentage of all still image observations assessed within a depth zone) of optimal, sub-optimal and poor spawning habitat by 5 m depth zones in the north and south basins of windermere. demonstrated or putative spawning grounds examined in the north basin comprised hol- beck point, low wray bay and north thompson holme assessed by a total of 36 still images. demonstrated or putative spawning grounds examined in the south basin comprised baswicks, blake holme, bellman landing, stewardson nab, south rawlinson nab and tower wood assessed by a total of 56 still images. note that transects in the south basin did not encounter any depths beyond 20 m. changes in water level, mineral suggest that siltation by fine sediments has occurred in the south basin. this may potentially have been brought about by four types of human impacts, that is, extraction, increased fluvial deposition and eutrophication. the level of windermere is influenced by the operation of a sluice on its outflow for flood alleviation purposes and by the periodic limited abstraction of potable water (pickering 2001). however, the environmental impact of each operation is strictly controlled and is unlikely to have a major impact on shallow-water spawning grounds. furthermore, it is also highly unli- kely to have had a differential impact on the two basins. substantial sand and gravel deposits were commercially exploited up to the early 1970s (picker- ing 2001), and extensive traces of such extraction activities remain clearly visible on the bed of the lake (miller et al. 2013), including on or near demon- strated or putative spawning grounds. while such past mineral extraction may have had some localised impacts on arctic charr spawning grounds, they are unlikely to be widespread and are also unlikely to miller et al. netting activities for spawning arctic charr in win- dermere undertaken since the time of frost (1965). in recent years, spawning arctic charr have been recorded in the north basin at four of the original six demonstrated or putative spawning grounds described by frost (1965) plus two newly described areas. in the south basin, where more extensive sampling has been undertaken in attempts to find spawning fish, they have been reported from only three of the origi- nal six demonstrated or putative spawning grounds. in addition, spawning fish have never been recorded at three south basin sites, and it is possible that these sites were rarely used as spawning grounds. spawn- ing fish have also been reported at seven newly described areas in the south basin, although five of these are closely clustered around the island of grass holme and this area could arguably be better classi- fied as a single site. although spawning is not direct evidence of suc- cessful subsequent egg incubation and arctic charr are known to move between the north and south basins of windermere (elliott et al. 1996), their high fidelity to their natal spawning grounds (frost 1963) means that spawning is indicative of at least some recent successful hatching at the locations where fish currently return to spawn. nevertheless, an overall population decline of arctic charr in windermere is evident and concerning (winfield et al. 2010). finally, the production by miller et al. (2013) of a detailed map of the geomorphological features and sedimentary processes shaping windermere and its catchment allow the current observations of arctic charr demonstrated or putative spawning grounds to be considered in the context of the lake’s glacial history. the retreat of the british and irish ice sheet approximately 15,000 years ago resulted in nine sub- basins separated by steps, ridges and isolated topo- graphic highs. these features have been interpreted as the surface expression of recessional moraines and ridge complexes formed during ice retreat (pinson et al. 2013). gravels and other coarse substrates have been transported to the lake through fluvial action, resulting in their distribution in the lake’s shallow inshore waters, and thus, only a small fraction of the great physical diversity of the bottom of windermere meets the spawning requirements of arctic charr. in their mapping of this species’ spawning grounds in three irish lakes, low et al. (2011) noted that such habitats comprised only 0.4–0.7% of the available lit- toral habitat. the majority of them were located adja- cent to steeply shelving areas that low et al. (2011) considered might have been selected because of their proximity to deep-water, non-spawning habitat that may minimise migratory energy costs or predation risk. in addition, low et al. (2011) considered that the long and narrow shapes of these spawning 42 grounds resulted from historical hydraulic sorting by wave action producing a localised hard substrate free of fine particles. similar processes are likely to have occurred in windermere where many of the spawning grounds are also adjacent to or even enclose steeply shelving areas (see again fig. 1), particularly on the western shore which was strongly shaped by the retreat of the british and irish ice sheet (miller et al. 2013). further consideration of such issues at windermere would require a higher-resolution map- ping of the spawning grounds, for example, through surveys for deposited eggs as performed by low et al. (2011) combined with hydroacoustic bathymet- ric surveys focussed on inshore areas of <5 m depth. acknowledgements we are grateful to the crew and hydrographic surveyors of the r/v white ribbon and bgs marine operations. we also thank ben bayliss of the environment agency, john davis and justin dix of the university of southampton and the win- dermere lake wardens for their support and help throughout this project. we also thank the environment agency for allowing us free use of their lake-level data. this work was primarily funded by the university of southampton and a brit- ish geological survey bufi phd studentship to hm, sup- ported by a financial contribution from the environment agency. jvr was funded in part through the erasmus pro- gramme of the european union. cc publishes with the per- mission of the executive director, bgs (nerc). references adams, c.e., hamilton, d.j., mccarthy, i., wilson, a.j., grant, a., alexander, g., waldron, s., snorasson, s.s., ferguson, m.m. & skulason, s. 2006. does breeding site fidelity drive phenotypic and genetic sub-structuring of a population of arctic charr? evolutionary ecology 20: 11– 26. barlow, j., harris, e. & mcfarlane, a. 2009a. windermere fluvial audit. report a: catchment scale geomorphology - technical report. report to environment agency north west region prepared by jacobs engineering, uk ltd.
