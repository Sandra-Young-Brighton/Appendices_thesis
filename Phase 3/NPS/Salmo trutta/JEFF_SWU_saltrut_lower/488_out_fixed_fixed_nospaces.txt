(frankham 2010). the closely related mosquitoﬁsh species gambusia holbrooki and gambusia afﬁnis are live-bearing ﬁshes in 1905, that are native to north america, but since the ﬁrst introduction in hawaii they have been introduced to more than 50 countries to control populations of malaria vectors (pyke 2005). however, today, the global invasive species programme (gisp, http://www.issg.org/database) lists mosquitoﬁsh as one of the world’s 100 worst invasive species. the invasion of g. holbrooki to europe began with the introduction of 12 individuals to the iberian peninsula in 1921. the following year, 200 descendants of these ﬁsh were transferred to italy. subsequent transloca- tions have resulted in this species becoming highly abundant in most mediterranean countries (reviewed in garcı´a-berthou et al. 2005). genetic studies based on allozyme and mtdna var- iation have distinguished g. holbrooki from g. afﬁnis, resulting in the description of two north american types of g. holbrooki reﬂecting northward and south- ward allele distributions relative to the savannah and altama drainages in the atlantic coast of the usa (wooten et al. 1988; scribner & avise 1993). esti- mates of genetic distances suggest a high degree of correspondence: j.-l. garcı´a-marı´n, lig, departament de biologia, facultat de cie`ncies, universitat de girona, campus montilivi, 17071 girona, spain. e-mail: joseluis.garcia@udg.edu 100 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00527.x spatial structuring throughout the g. holbrooki range in original american habitats (wooten et al. 1988; hernandez-martich & smith 1990). local samples within drainages are consistent with single breeding units (mcclenaghan et al. 1985). large transects within a river basin may be occupied by a single metapopulation that has ephemeral local subpopula- tions, with size and permanence being a function of self-recruitment and the level of gene ﬂow (smith et al. 1989). founder events and population bottlenecks are prevalent in the early stages of introductions and are considered responsible for the loss of diversity in many invasive species (allendorf & lundquist 2003). however, multiple introductions may contribute to the recovery of intrapopulation diversity (dlugosch & parker 2008; facon et al. 2008). european studies have identiﬁed a signiﬁcantly lower genetic diversity of mosquitoﬁsh in europe than in america. an rapd-pcr study indicated a strong reduction in nuclear genetic diversity in the four european collec- tions that have been analysed, which was interpreted as reﬂecting the founder event associated with a small number of initial colonists (grapputo et al. 2006). the reduced level of diversity in europe was also evident from a large survey (23 european collections from spain to greece) based on mtdna sequence variation. all european populations, except one, had the haplo- type hol1, and only a few individuals that had been collected in france and greece corresponded to a different haplotype (vidal et al. 2010). the current study is based on a panel of ﬁve targeted snp loci from g. holbrooki gene sequences that are available from the genbank. we used the snp loci to identify differences in the patterns of diversity within and among european populations of g. hol- brooki, as well as american collections of g. holbro- oki and g. afﬁnis. based on our ﬁndings, we discuss the possible reasons for these patterns and the value of using snp loci in studies of invasive populations. material and methods snp markers for mosquitoﬁsh a targeted gene approach was used to detect the snps in a panel of 24 mosquitoﬁsh specimens from four european collections. the screening of 12 primer pairs allowed the identiﬁcation of seven silent polymorphic sites belonging to ﬁve different genes. primer pairs were designed either by using previously sequenced gambusia genes (vitellogenin, ab181836.1; b-actin, ab182330.1; androgen receptor beta, ab182329) or by comparing orthologous ﬁsh genes (malate dehy- drogenase b-1, ay161293, ay161295; alpha subunit of major complex, x95433, histocompatibility snp diversity in invasive mosquitoﬁsh bt028061; prolactin, ay135149; pyruvate carboxi- lase, bx465183.9, ab081832.1; ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 1, ay197500, ab259120.1; growth hormone, ay286447.1, aj640135.1; protein 53, bc095597.1; and uracil-dna glycosylase, nm_ 200974.1). universal primers from chow & hazama (1998) were used to detect the sequence variation at the ribosomal protein subunit 7 gene. blast results indicated that the primer set for malate dehydrogenase b-1 ampliﬁed a dna fragment related to the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa b of oncorhynchus_mykiss (aj317969), and the primers for pyruvate carboxilase ampliﬁed a fragment related to the cathepsin d gene of o. mykiss (u90321). we designed a multiplex geno- typing protocol for ﬁve of these seven snps using the snapshotò multiplex kit (applied biosystems, foster city, california), a method based on single-base extension (table 1). this approach ﬁrst requires pcr ampliﬁcation of a short dna fragment, including the polymorphic position, for subsequent use as the template for a second genotyping pcr. the snap- shotò multiplex kit has the opportunity to detect triallelic site variation. primers, amplicon sizes and primer concentration at the two multiplex pcr are detailed in table 1. the initial ampliﬁcation reaction was performed in a ﬁnal volume of 30 ll with 1.5 mm mgcl2, 200 lm dntps, 25 ng of genomic dna and 0.3 u taq dna polymerase (ecogen s.r.l). the second pcr for genotyping was carried out by following the kit manufacturer’s instructions. diversity within and among wild mosquitoﬁsh populations a total of 1160 g. holbrooki, representing 23 collec- tions from different european river basins, were screened for variation at the ﬁve snps (s7, cat, vit, bact and ikba) described in table 1. euro- pean mosquitoﬁsh samples corresponded to introduced populations in spain (n = 7 samples), portugal italy (n = 1), hungary (n = 4), france (n = 5), (n = 1) and greece (n = 1) in addition, american reference collections included each of the main groups of g. holbrooki from the atlantic (20-brunswick and 21-florence) and gulf (22-gaines- ville and 23-everglades) drainages (wooten et al. 1988). two collections of g. afﬁnis (24-big black river in the mississippi drainage, 25-lanoka, new jersey) were also included in our study. (table 2, fig. 1). genetic variability within samples was expressed as the average expected heterozygosity (he). the exact probability test of guo & thompson (1992) imple- mented in genepop 3.4 software (raymond & rousset 1995) was applied to check the conformation of genotype frequencies to hardy–weinberg expecta- tions. composite linkage disequilibrium between pairs 101 vidal et al. i . ) g n p y t o n e g d n a l a i t i n i ( r c p l x e p i t l u m e v i t u c e s n o c o w t y b i g n p y t o n e g r i e h t r o f s e r u d e c o r p l l r a u c e o m d n a i k o o r b o h l i a s u b m a g n i d e ﬁ i t n e d i ) s p n s ( i s m s h p r o m y o p l l e d i t o e c u n - e g n s i l . 1 l e b a t 102 c g a c c t a a a g g t t g t t t g t c t a a t t a t a t t a a t a t a t a t a t a t a m n 8 c g t t g t a c c a t t t t g g t t a c t a g a t t g c g t c c a c t t c t g g g r 8 2 t i v i 1 p n s t i v 1 2 3 m n 8 f 7 2 e t i v a ⁄ g 8 2 n o x e 3 1 4 9 8 2 1 7 5 f e a c t t c a c t c t g c t t g a g a a a g a a t t a t a a a t t a t a t t m n 1 1 t t g a c c c a g c c c a g t c t t g c a g g a c a g c g a c a t g c g g r 4 e t c a b 1 p n s t c a b 8 1 1 m n 1 1 i f 3 t c a b g ⁄ c 3 n o r t n i 7 9 3 0 9 2 1 7 5 f e i n n e g o l l e t i v ) t i v ( n i t c a a t e b ) t c a b ( 1 p n s a b k i 3 5 1 m n 1 1 i f 5 a b k i t ⁄ c 5 n o r t n i 4 8 3 1 9 2 1 7 5 f e b a p p a k r o t c a f l r a e c u n f o r o t i b h n i i a c t c t a t t g t g a a g a g t a t a t c a t c a a t a t t t t a a a t t a a a t t a t a t a t a m n 1 1 c c t a g a a g g t t t c a t t t c g t c c c c t a g a g c a g c a a g a c g g r 5 e a b k i ) a b k i ( a h p a l c t c c c g c t t t a c a a t t g c g a t a t a t a t a t a m n 5 . 5 g t g t t t t g t a c g a g t a a t g t a g a a a g a a g t a c c g c a a c c t g t a g 2 r 9 e t a c c a c t g g a c c a g a g t c a a c a t a t m n 8 a c a t c a a g t c t c t c a a c c c t a a t a c c t g g a c t t g a g g g g c a t t t g r 1 7 s i 1 p n s 7 s 4 0 1 m n 8 i f 1 7 s t ⁄ c 1 n o r t n i 7 1 3 2 9 2 1 7 5 f e ) 7 s ( 7 s i n e t o r p l a m o s o b r i 1 p n s t a c 9 7 m n 5 . 5 i 1 f 8 t a c t ⁄ c 8 n o r t n i 4 5 8 3 9 2 1 7 5 f e ) t a c ( d i n s p e h t a c r e m i r p i g n p y t o n e g p n s h t g n e l r c p . c n o c r c p n o i t a c ﬁ i l p m a r c p l a i t i n i p n s k n a b n e g n i e t i s s p n s s r e m i r p p n s n o i t a c o l e c n e u q e s d i k n a b n e g e n e g d e ﬁ i l p m a table 2. allele frequencies and diversity within wild populations of gambusia holbrooki for visible nucleotide (allele) variants from direct genotype counts. nucleotide variants below locus name (less frequent nucleotide variant within parentheses). snp diversity in invasive mosquitoﬁsh locality g. holbrooki 1-river ter (sp) 2-altea (sp) 3-river millars (sp) 4-river ju´car (sp) 5-river ebre (sp) 6-river segura (sp) 7-river fluvia` (sp) 8-tapada. tagus basin (p) 9-ribeira da lena. lis basin (p) 10-figueira da foz. mondego basin (p) 11-ribeira de alca´c¸ovas. sado basin (p) 12-river orb (f) 13-vistre. rhoˆne basin (f) 14-river bourdigou (f) 15-brie`re. loire estuary (f) 16-lacroix falgarde. garonne basin (f) 17-catania. sicily (i) 18-lake pamvotis (g) 19-lake he´viz (h) 20-brunswick (nc) 21-florence (sc) 22-gainesville (fl) 23-everglades (fl) gambusia afﬁnis 24-big black river (ms) 25-lanoka (nj) n 80 75 70 79 59 59 64 47 45 24 28 29 15 65 45 40 27 19 44 16 50 86 94 31 58 loci ⁄ allele s7 c (t) cat c (t) vit g (a) bact g (c) ikba g (a) 0.627 (1) 0.727  0.294 (2)  0.487 (3) 0.649 (2)   0.672 (4) 0.226 (2) 1.000 0.878 0.750 (2) 0.833 (4) 0.875 (5) 0.800 0.675 (2)   0.514 (8) 0.443 (2) 0.955 (16) 0.895 0.875 1.000 1.000 (1) 1.000 (1) 1.000 (1) 0.775 0.924 (3) 0.871 (4) 0.994 0.553 (2)   0.714 (1)   0.594 0.585 0.678 0.646 0.661 0.466 0.300 0.338 0.811 0.262 0.833 0.842 0.807 0.750 0.950 1.000 (5) 1.000 0.937 (1) 0.911 (2) 0.917 (22) 0.601 0.931 (1) 0.859 (2) 0.791 (8) 0.793 (1) 0.878 0.789 (5) 0.833 (4) 0.776 0.667 0.777  0.989 0.112 0.851 0.921 0.932 1.000 1.000 1.000 0.995 (2) 0.456 (1) 0.211 (4)  0.454 (4)  0.893 (9)   0.629 (1)   0.969 (11)   0.322 (5)   0.798 0.534 (1)   0.729 0.821 0.793 1.000 (2) 0.808 0.689 0.811 (3) 0.957 (4)   0.500 0.534 1.000 0.640  0.320 0.661 (1) 0.725 1.000 1.000 (6) 0.993 (3) 0.811 (6)   0.991 (2) 0.772 (7) 1.000 0.909 (1) 0.974 (5) 0.962 (2) 0.914  0.933 0.962 1.000 1.000 0.696 (4) 0.632  0.988 (1) 1.000 0.960 1.000 1.000 he 0.366 0.207 0.258 0.239 0.370 0.232 0.390 0.227 0.306 0.322 0.274 0.310 0.262 0.324 0.251 0.279 0.224 0.313 0.236 0.075 0.127 0.087 0.092 1.000 (23) 0.860 (8) 1.000 0.914 1.000 0.944 (4) 0.919 1.000 (2) 1.000 (10) 0.789 (20)   0.030 0.167 k 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 n, sample size;

(1977) by using the freena program (chapuis & estoup 2007). each collection was also checked for the optimal number of genetically homogenous groups (k) by the bayesian markov chain monte carlo approach method of structure 2.2 software (pritchard et al. 2000). each structure run consisted of analyses for k = 1, 2 and 3 with a burn-in period of 20,000 steps followed by 100,000 monte carlo replicates. we used a model of independent allele frequencies, with the remaining parameters set to default. after ﬁve replicates of each run, the optimal number of homogenous units (k) for a particular population was selected according to the k value, with the reduced set of )lnp(d) values among the ﬁve replicate runs being indicated in the structure outputs. when )lnp(d) value ranks of two consecutive k values overlapped, a second structure job of ﬁve replicates for these two k values was run, and the optimal value was selected as the k that had signiﬁcant reduced rank for )lnp(d) values according to the mann–whitney u-test. we tested for recent population bottlenecks in the introduced european populations using bottleneck 1.2.02 program (piry et al. 1999). using a wilcoxon sign rank test, the program checked for a majority of loci with signiﬁcant heterozygosity excess, which arises as a consequence of a genetic bottleneck relative 103 vidal et al. fig. 1. geographical location of european collections of gambu- sia holbrooki and results of the barrier analyses indicating groups of populations. groups are separated by dotted lines. lowercase letters are used to indicate the order in which the program detected barriers. location numbers refer to table 2. to a population having the same number of alleles in mutation–drift equilibrium. allele frequency differences among samples were evaluated by the exact probability test of genepop. differentiation among collections was estimated from weir’s fst (weir & cockerham 1984), with and without correcting for null alleles, as implemented in the freena software. in this latter approach, the correction for null alleles involved the ena method described by chapuis & estoup (2007). the popula- tion structure among collections was inferred by estimating the number of homogenous genetic units (k) over sampled individuals, according to the markov chain monte carlo method implemented in the structure software (e.g., sanz et al. 2008). in addition, group-level bayesian analysis in baps 5.4 (corander et al. 2004, 2008) was used to obtain the best population clustering among the whole data set of groups of individuals. finally, an fst matrix (weir & cockerham 1984; provided by fstat, goudet 2001) was used to estimate genetic distances between all pairs of european samples. using the latitudinal and longitudinal geographical coordinates of our samples expressed in decimal form, we identiﬁed the european areas where the estimated fst values showed an abrupt rate of change on the basis of the monmonier’s (1973) algorithm, as identiﬁed with the software barrier vs 2.4 (manni et al. 2004). this approach allows the identiﬁcation of different groups of popu- lations and the genetic discontinuities that exist between them (gagnon & angers 2006). the robust- ness of the boundaries was assessed by means of bootstrap matrices analysis, as implemented in the 104 barrier software (manni et al. 2004). bootstrap was performed over the set of ﬁve pairwise-fst matrices obtained by jackknife living out a single snp locus at each time. we selected boundaries that were con- ﬁrmed by at least four of these ﬁve replicates. results gene diversity within wild mosquitoﬁsh collections at individual loci, signiﬁcant hardy–weinberg devi- ations were observed in 19 of 99 comparisons within the sampled collections of mosquitoﬁsh (table 2). all but three of these (s7 locus at 2-altea and 14-bour- digou; cat locus at 5-ebre) were attributed to heterozygote deﬁcits. however, structure suggested a single homogeneous unit (k = 1) in all collections except 5-ebre. micro-checker suggested that the single deviation detected at the vit locus and two of four deviations at the s7 locus were generated by null alleles, as were all observed deviations at the bact and ikba loci. in these two latter loci, null alleles were detected in nine and four collections respectively, and their frequencies ranked from 0.036 to 0.144 at the bact locus and from 0.106 to 0.322 at the ikba locus. among collections of g. holbrooki, genotyping failures were only abundant at the s7 locus for the 17-catania collection (60% missed genotypes), at the vit locus for the 3-millar collection (31%), and at the bact locus for the 6-segura collection (19%). these failures may be related to speciﬁc null alleles for the involved locus and location. the absence of the null allele for the ikba locus in american g. holbrooki, which is otherwise abundant in some european collections, was also noteworthy. a large proportion of missed genotypes was observed at the loci s7 (24- big black river 74%) and ikba (24-big black river 32%; 25-lanoka 34%), suggesting the occurrence of nucleotide changes in g. afﬁnis resulting in the reduced performance of the pcr primers. only two of 170 adjusted tests for linkage disequilibrium were signiﬁcant (5-ebre s7 and ikba; 25-lanoka s7 and cat). diversity was higher in european (he > 0.200) than in american collections for both g. holbrooki (he < 0.130) and g. afﬁnis (he < 0.170) (table 2). bottleneck analyses suggested heterozygosity ex- cess relative to population in mutation–drift equilib- rium for six of 19 european mosquitoﬁsh collections (1-ter, 5-ebre, 7-fluvia`, 9-lena, 14-bourdigau and 16-lacroix). population structure among mosquitoﬁsh populations large divergences were observed among the sampled european collections, the applied irrespective of estimation approach (fst  0.2, table 3). according to the permutation test in genepop, allele frequency differences were statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) at the ﬁve loci among the european g. holbrooki collections. lower divergence was detected among sampled american g. holbrooki, with signiﬁcant differentiation at cat, bact and ikba loci. structure clustering of all sampled ﬁsh suggested three genetically homogenous units, but individuals and samples could not be assigned unequivocally to inferred clusters (fig. 2). american samples of either g. holbrooki or g. afﬁnis mostly predominated in cluster 1, while clusters 2 and 3 contained primarily european samples. the most likely population parti- tioning that was obtained by baps indicated 19 clusters, basically as a reﬂection of the unique genetic composition of each sample (fig. 2). baps clustering detected population relationships regardless of their geographical distance or degree of drainage connec- tion. for the portuguese 9-figueira and 10-alca´çovas samples, and the french 16-orb sample, were assigned to the same group. baps partitions joined the 17-catania (italy) and the 26-lanoka (new jersey) g. afﬁnis collection into a single group. population relationships among european collections, which were inferred from genetic and geographical proximities with monmonier’s algorithm, revealed four robust barriers separating ﬁve groups of popula- tions isolated the french sample 16-lacroix from the rest of the european locations. apart from this distinction, the other barriers were fairly geographically consistent. the second barrier separated the southern iberian populations. this barrier received weaker support on the atlantic portuguese side than on the mediterranean coast of spain. a third barrier isolated eastern european populations, including the 17-catania col- lection in italy, while the fourth barrier separated the french mediterranean populations.

corhynchus keta to 1 ⁄ 586 bp in salmo_salar (smith et al. 2005). on average, in the studied snp loci, the european collections showed a higher amount of diversity than the american collections of either g. holbrooki or g. afﬁnis. previous genetic studies have reported that mosquitoﬁsh populations of invaded territories have a reduced diversity (grapputo et al. 2006; ayres et al. 2010; vidal et al. 2010). only the introduced hawai- ian populations of g. afﬁnis displayed some alleles that were undetected in source populations, because of the much larger sample size of the hawaiian collec- tions (scribner et al. 1992). certainly, our sampling effort in america was small, but reﬂected the main differentiation between the atlantic and gulf popula- tions of g. holbrooki (wooten et al. 1988). analyses on mitochondrial sequence variation conﬁrmed the divergence among our american samples, with dis- tinct haplotypes typifying locations from north car- olina, south carolina and florida (vidal et al. 2010). reduced american diversity may reﬂect ascertain- ment bias, because the probability of an snp being identiﬁed is a function of the allele frequencies in the panel used for their detection. a homogenous genetic composition of the discovery panel, using just euro- pean ﬁsh, may contribute to the loss of snps that were otherwise widely distributed, as described in human populations (clark et al. 2005). in its american range, the mosquitoﬁsh showed strong geographical structur- ing (wooten et al. 1988); hence, the ascertainment bias underestimated this heterogeneity. in a study on the lizard sceloporus undulatus, rosenblum & no- vembre (2007) noted that a discovery panel generated from the random selection of samples across the original range might improve the detection of snp variants in species with signiﬁcant levels of population structure. however, these snp variants may be inadequate for studying diversity within recently invaded territories, when limited numbers of individ- uals are involved in colonisation. for example, historical records indicate that only 12 specimens of g. holbrooki founded the ﬁrst european population (reviewed in garcı´a-berthou et al. 2005). population structure of european mosquitoﬁsh populations despite the reduced number of snps that were detected in mosquitoﬁsh, they were suitable for the genetic study of the european populations, because of the high amount of within population diversity (he > 0.200) and the large differentiation observed among these popula- tions (fst  0.2). for instance, usually 5–7 loci 106 generate the allozyme diversity that is used to analyse divergence among american g. holbrooki populations (e.g.,wooten et al. 1988). in addition, we observed larger population divergences among european mos- quitoﬁsh collections through our use of snp loci than in previous work using mtdna sequencing (vidal et al. 2010). high levels of diversity should be expected from populous mosquitoﬁsh populations, which are sus- tained by the huge reproductive capacity of this species, involving multiple inseminations and the facility for sperm storage (zane et al. 1999; pearse & anderson 2009). however, while this reproductive strategy con- tributes towards retaining several nuclear male genomes in a pregnant female, only the female mitochondrial haplotype will be transmitted to the whole offspring. hence, pregnant mosquitoﬁsh females that survive during bottlenecks mitigate genetic drift on nuclear variation. in addition, the retention of nuclear variation in introduced populations may be favoured by high amounts of connectivity between local populations, as has been observed along rivers and marshlands in america (smith et al. 1989). this variation may facilitate the response to natural selection in colonised territories and the invasive success of the species (lee 2002; chapman et al. 2009). several despite the high divergence observed among euro- pean populations that were introduced less than a century ago, their phylogenetic relationships were difﬁcult to analyse here because no fully concordant results were obtained by the different approaches that we used. while structure suggested three genetic units as the more probable structure involving all samples, baps results proposed a unique genetic composition for almost every european sample. this latter pattern ﬁts with the expectations of founder events (allendorf & lundquist 2003; dlugosch & parker 2008) and may be potentially intensiﬁed by bottlenecks. baps only reliably detects different gene pools under very restricted migration, which may be our case, because each sample was collected from a different river basin. structure appears to perform weakly when the number of loci is reduced (waples & gaggiotti 2006). however, the clustering of popula- tions observed by structure concurs with the proposal of in europe, as suggested by mtdna studies. cluster 3 in structure was rare within the reference american samples, but predominated in some european collections, such as 16-lacroix. the ﬁxation of the hol5 mtdna haplo- type in this french locality was considered to be evidence for multiple introductions of g. holbrooki in europe from geographically close american sources (vidal et al. 2010). monmonier’s algorithm imple- mented in the software barrier, which incorporates genetic and geographical criteria, also indicated that the 16-lacroix population was clearly isolated from introductions other european populations. it is possible that this population in central france is the result of a recent founder effect, which is still reﬂected in its gene pool, as suggested by bottleneck results. the remaining populations show a clear pattern of isolation from west to east (fig. 1). this pattern may reﬂect both different introductions and successive stages in the colonisation of europe. the historical record indicates that the ﬁrst introduction of mosquitoﬁsh in europe was in 1921 in southern spain, and descendants of these specimens were subsequently transferred via italy to eastern europe (reviewed by garcı´a-berthou et al. 2005). it is also noteworthy that the population structure described among mediterranean rivers, from southern spain to southern france, is relatively consistent with latitudi- nal variation in some of the life-history traits described for these populations (benejam et al. 2009). in summary, we have added ﬁve markers for the genetic analysis of g. holbrooki. the results obtained in the snp-based analysis of european populations improve those obtained in previous studies using mitochondrial dna. five major populations groups were identiﬁed: central france, southern iberia, north- ern iberia, eastern europe and mediterranean french rivers. the barriers separating these groups are relatively consistent with historical records on the introduction of this species to europe. acknowledgements (mec) the work was
