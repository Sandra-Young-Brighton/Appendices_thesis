i. j. winﬁeld, j. m. fletcher, j. b. james centre for ecology & hydrology, lancaster environment centre, lancaster, uk abstract – hydroacoustic surveys are an important tool for assessing the abundance of arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus (l.)) in lakes, the requirement for which is increasing because of new environmental legislation. consequently, survey demand is now such that assessments must be undertaken with the minimum of effort compatible with scientiﬁc validity. one major complication is seasonal variability in abundance, with which surveyors have attempted to deal by deﬁning somewhat arbitrary seasonal sampling windows. the deﬁnition of more objective windows was pursued by analysing variations in the seasonal abundance of arctic charr in windermere, uk, recorded using day and night hydroacoustic surveys at monthly intervals from 1991 to 2001. two alternative sampling windows for night surveys free of signiﬁcant internal seasonal effects were revealed, i.e., december to september and september to december. it was also found that day surveys gave a useful, although lower, estimate of abundance as compared with night surveys. key words: arctic charr;

4ap, uk; e-mail: ijw@ ceh.ac.uk accepted for publication march 07, 2006 introduction the conservation and management of arctic charr (s. alpinus) populations frequently rely on hydro- acoustic surveys as a rapid and nondestructive means of assessing abundance of this species in a variety of standing waterbodies across northern latitudes (e.g., snorrason et al. 1992; bean et al. 1996; jensen et al. 1997). in europe, such hydroacoustic surveys are becoming more frequent in response to a variety of monitoring requirements including those of the euro- pean union habitats directive (e.g., bean 2003) and water framework directive (e.g., winﬁeld 2002). given limited resources, such assessments must in consequence be undertaken with the minimum of effort, particularly ﬁeld time, compatible with scien- tiﬁc validity. it is likely that many lakes will have to be assessed only by single visit surveys, with intervals of years between successive surveys. one major complication directly relevant to this need to minimise survey effort at any particular waterbody, is diel and seasonal variability in estimates of population abundance, the existence of which has been appreciated for some time (e.g., elliott & baroudy 1992). surveyors have attempted to deal with the latter by recommending seasonal sampling windows for single visit surveys (e.g., hillary et al. 1999; bean 2003). however, in the face of a lack of guiding data and analysis, such windows have so far had to be deﬁned somewhat arbitrarily and, as a result, are inconsistent between organisations. to a lesser extent, diel variations in arctic charr abundance in 64 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00170.x seasonal variability in hydroacoustic surveys of arctic charr open water have also been both recorded (e.g., elliott & baroudy op. cit.) and taken into account in assessment protocols. there is a preference for night surveys (e.g., hillary et al. 1999; bean 2003), when higher abundance is usually recorded. the most extensive hydroacoustic study of arctic charr is that undertaken on windermere, uk, which began with exclusively day surveys in mid-1989 to which night surveys were added in late 1990 (baroudy 1993). subsequently, the programme has been main- tained continuously and unchanged, with the excep- tion of a system upgrade at the start of 2002, to the present with only brief interruptions due to technical problems or adverse weather conditions (winﬁeld et al. 2004). the resulting data set, comprising night and day surveys at monthly intervals of the lake’s north and south basins now covers more than 14 years, with earlier components of it already having been used in analyses of population dynamics (elliott & baroudy 1992, 1995; elliott et al. 1996) and the effects of spatial variation on abundance estimates (baroudy & elliott 1993). in the context of hydroacoustic survey design, the present study addressed the problem of seasonal variation in arctic charr abundance in an analysis of a subset of the windermere data set. the speciﬁc objectives were to describe seasonal and diel patterns of abundance, to determine a sampling window or windows free of signiﬁcant internal seasonal effects and to determine if night surveys are indeed essential or if day surveys are adequate for survey purposes. materials and methods study site windermere is situated (54°22¢n, 2°56¢w; altitude 39 m) in the english lake district, uk. it comprises a mesotrophic north basin (area 8.1 km2, maximum depth 64 m) and a eutrophic south basin (area 6.7 km2, maximum depth 44 m). the ﬁsh community is relat- ively simple and in addition to arctic charr contains brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.), eel (anguilla anguilla (l.)), minnow (phoxinus phoxinus (l.)), perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.), pike (esox lucius l.), roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)) and three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus l.), while salmon (salmo_salar l.) pass through the lake during their life cycle. arctic charr have historically dominated offshore habitats (e.g., frost 1977) and winﬁeld & durie (2004) conﬁrmed by survey gill netting in 2001 that this continues to be the case in the north basin, where the species comprises 96% by numbers of the community with brown_trout being the only other species recorded. the situation in the lake’s south basin is more complicated due in part to a recent marked increase of roach in the near-surface habitat of the open water (winﬁeld & durie 2004; i.j. winﬁeld, j.m. fletcher & j.b. james, unpublished data). hydroacoustic surveys full methodological details of the hydroacoustic surveys, which are conducted from a boat with the acoustic beam orientated vertically, are given by baroudy & elliott (1993). from the start of the programme to the end of 2001, the system used comprised a simrad ey-m single-beam echo sounder, operating at 70 khz with a beam angle of 11° and a pulse duration of 0.6 ms, coupled with postprocessing by hadas (hydro acoustic data acquisition sys- tem; lindem data acquisition systems, university of oslo, norway) using a threshold of )56 db. at the beginning of 2002, the echo sounder was upgraded to a split-beam system but, as resulting data are not analysed here (see below), this is not described further. data selection and analysis the entire windermere data set includes surveys for each of the lake’s two basins from july 1989 to the present. however, the open-water ﬁsh community of the south basin has included signiﬁcant numbers of ﬁsh other than arctic charr since at least 2001, and possibly a number of years earlier (winﬁeld & durie 2004). in addition, the echo sounder used in both basins was changed in 2002 as part of an upgrade to a split-beam system. although an intercalibration has been derived between the two systems (i.j. winﬁeld, j.m. fletcher & j.b. james, unpublished data), this introduces additional analytical error. given these considerations and the objectives of the present study, the data selected for analysis comprise the night and day surveys of the north basin from january 1991 to december 2001, inclusive. furthermore, although estimates are available for both small and large ﬁsh in the upper and lower water column (see elliott et al. 1996), the present analysis is concerned only with total ﬁsh numbers. such data were successfully collected on 235 of a possible 264 sampling occasions (i.e., 89% coverage). all analysis of abundance estimates is based on geometric means following jurvelius (1991) and baroudy & elliott (1993), while that of percentage data (see below) follows arcsine transformations. results between january 1991 and december 2001, arctic charr abundance during the night varied from 27.6 to 65 winﬁeld et al. 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200  ) 1

details of the statistical analysis are given in the text. seasonal variation in arctic charr abundance during the night and day in the form of monthly means also showed the above patterns in seasonal and diel abun- dance (fig. 2). however, in addition to seasonal and diel inﬂuences, data summarised in this way also incorporate long-term changes in arctic charr abun- dance over the study period. to remove this confound- ing factor, monthly means of abundances rescaled as a percentage of each year’s peak were calculated and displayed signiﬁcant variation both at night (anova f11,101 ¼ 6.99, and day (anova f11,101 ¼ 5.92, r2 ¼ 0.309, p < 0.001) (fig. 3). among the night surveys, monthly mean values did not differ signiﬁcantly within the two periods r2 ¼ 0.370, p < 0.001) from december to

monthly means did not differ signiﬁcantly within the two periods from november to august and from august to december (post hoc analysis by tukey’s multiple comparisons, all p > 0.05), i.e., the months of august and december ﬁt within either period. finally, the relationship between day and night abundance of arctic charr for each month (where data are available) between january 1991 and december

an objective hydro- acoustic survey protocol for arctic charr populations. consequently, fundamental aspects of arctic charr ecology which underlie the observed patterns of seasonal and diel variability in abundance in the open-water habitat will not be discussed here. for such issues, the reader is directed instead to the extensive review of this species by klemetsen et al. (2003). sampling windows a clear and persistent seasonality in abundance was evident both night and day throughout the study period with typical peaks during autumn and troughs during late winter presumably reﬂecting population recruit- ment and mortality. nevertheless, the analysis identi- ﬁed two seasonal for each component of the 24 h period within which observa- tions were free of signiﬁcant internal seasonal effects. for night surveys, these periods comprised december to september and september to december. these periods may be compared with a june to october sampling window speciﬁed by hillary et al. (1999) and a july to august window speciﬁed by bean (2003), both of which also recommended exclusively night surveys. the present results suggest that the window of hillary et al. (1999), which was derived for use with single visit surveys for a variety of species, is inappropriate for arctic charr because abundance during october is signiﬁcantly higher than during the preceding months. in contrast, that of bean (2003) which was derived speciﬁcally for single visit surveys for arctic charr is unnecessarily restrictive and could be widened to ease logistical issues with no loss of scientiﬁc integrity. for day surveys, the corresponding periods differed only slightly and ran from november to august and from august to december. in addition, day abundance proved to be a signiﬁcant predictor of the following night abundance, although it consistently gave an underestimate which became more marked at lower population abundances. given the complexity of this relationship, it is prudent to conclude that day surveys alone, although they are logistically much easier to undertake, do not give an adequate assessment of arctic charr abundance. this is particularly so when absolute abundance is of interest, although they do give a general indication of the relative situation. the above conclusions may, however, only be applicable to lakes similar to windermere in which the water column is deep and of low transparency such that although the arctic charr population descends during the day. consequently, at least a component of it persists above the lake bottom and so remains detectable by hydroacoustics. a further restriction to 68 the present analysis is that the echo sounder used had a lower target detection threshold of )56 db, which equates to a ﬁsh length of c. 30 mm (love 1971). many hydroacoustic systems currently in use to monitor arctic charr and other ﬁsh populations are able to detect smaller ﬁsh. given the above considerations, it is recommended on the basis of the windermere data set that single visit hydroacoustic surveys for the assessment of arctic charr abundance should be carried out at night within the period between december and september, inclusive. however, we also strongly recommend that further studies at, and analyses of, existing data from a range of lake types should be undertaken as a matter of urgency to reﬁne hydroacoustic survey protocols to the level already reached for other sampling techniques, such as survey gill netting (e.g. appelberg 2000). such development is essential for the effective implemen- tation of the european union water framework directive and other national and international monit- oring programmes. acknowledgements we thank many colleagues past and present, too numerous
