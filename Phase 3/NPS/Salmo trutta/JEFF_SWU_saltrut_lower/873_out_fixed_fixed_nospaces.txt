october 6, 2011 abstract – high-head dams in oregon’s willamette river basin inhibit seaward migration and present signiﬁcant mortality risks to esa-listed juvenile chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha). over 7 years, we passively collected 13,365 downstream-migrating juvenile salmon in rivers above and below willamette dams. most salmon emigrated from upstream sites in february–june, but passed dams in november–february when reservoirs were drawn down near annual lows, and access to deep-water passage routes improved. samples collected above reservoirs were dominated by subyearlings, whereas below-dam samples were a phenotypically diverse mix of subyearling, yearling and older salmon. the life history data indicated that willamette reservoirs seasonally entrap many salmon and some sea-ready smolts probably residualise. annual dam-passage mortality estimates were 8–59% (mean = 26%). individual salmon mortality risk increased signiﬁcantly with body length and varied with reservoir elevation and discharge. operational changes that allow timely volitional emigration and development of less hazardous passage routes would beneﬁt this threatened population. key words: high-head dam; oncorhynchus; reservoir entrapment; residualism; turbine mortality introduction construction and operation of hydropower dams have contributed to major population declines and local extirpations of anadromous salmonids (oncorhynchus spp.) along the western paciﬁc rim (raymond 1988; nehlsen et al. 1991; national research council 1996). decades of ﬁsh passage research have improved juvenile and adult salmonid survival at many dams, mainly through structural and operational changes (williams et al. 2005; ferguson et al. 2008). much of this research has been at columbia and snake river dams in oregon and washington and has focused on reducing juvenile salmonid mortality in turbines (coutant & whitney 2000; cˇ ada 2001), and guiding outmigrating ﬁsh towards surface spillways and ﬁsh bypass routes (ferguson et al. 1998; muir et al. 2001; johnson et al. 2005; zabel et al. 2008). main stem columbia and snake river dams are run-of-river projects, where reservoir elevations remain relatively constant, and surface spill or ﬁsh bypass facilities are available for most downstream migrants (williams et al. 2005). high-head, ﬂood control dams in oregon’s willamette river basin are operated much differently than the run-of-river projects on the columbia and snake rivers. willamette basin dams are in tributaries rather than on the main stem, and many have no upstream or downstream ﬁsh passage facilities (myers et al. 2006; nmfs 2008). flood control reservoirs are drawn down by late fall to provide winter and spring ﬂood storage and then reﬁll from winter to late spring. correspondence: m. l. keefer, department of fish and wildlife resources, university of idaho, moscow, id 83844-1136, usa. e-mail: mkeefer@uidaho.edu 222 doi:

options like spillways are limited because most willamette reservoirs fall below spillway control gates for months at a time. consequently, downstream migrants pass the dams primarily via turbines or deep- water regulating outlets, each of which present signif- icant ﬁsh injury and mortality risks. the u.s. endangered species act willamette river dams have blocked adult chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) from reaching much of their historic spawning habitat for several decades, and the spring run was listed as threatened under in 1999 (nmfs 1999). overharvest, habitat degradation and hatchery effects contributed to the population decline. population recovery efforts in the basin currently include a program that outplants surplus adult hatchery chinook salmon (and some naturally produced adults) into formerly productive habitats above dams (nmfs 2008; keefer et al. 2010). sites include the north santiam, south santiam, mckenzie and middle fork willamette river sub-basins. the adult outplant program has produced increasing numbers of juve- niles, but little is known about the life history of these juveniles or their behaviour and fate as they migrate seaward. such information is needed as managers design and deploy ﬁsh passage facilities at dams throughout the basin (i.e., nmfs 2008). seasonal operations of the willamette projects are poorly matched to the life history phenology and behaviours of outmigrating juvenile salmon. most yearling chinook salmon, for example, are physiolog- ically ready for seaward migration in late winter or spring (groot & margolis 1991) when willamette reservoirs are rapidly ﬁlling, surface spill is rare and depth to turbines and regulating outlets can be prohibitively deep for passage. surface-oriented year- lings often have difﬁculty ﬁnding and using deep- water passage routes (e.g., venditti et al. 2000; johnson & dauble 2006) and consequently may fail to pass the willamette projects during their smoltiﬁ- cation window. subyearling spring chinook salmon also actively migrate in the willamette system (friesen et al. 2007) and many move downstream into reservoir and main stem habitats from winter through fall. some early migrating subyearlings enter reservoirs when they are near winter lows and deep-water passage routes are relatively accessible. however, access to passage routes is increasingly restricted for subyear- lings that enter reservoirs in spring through fall. reservoirs created by dams with low passage opportunity can entrap yearling and subyearling chinook salmon, with unknown effects on their life history or life-cycle survival. potential negative effects include disrupted smoltiﬁcation (e.g., mccormick chinook salmon entrapment and mortality et al. 1998), increased predation risk (e.g., poe et al. 1991) and eventual downstream migration that is poorly synchronised with optimal river passage con- ditions (e.g., achord et al. 2007). some of these effects may be partially offset by accelerated salmon growth in the reservoirs, which are often productive relative to historic riverine habitats. larger size at age generally provides survival advantages during rearing and migration and upon ocean entry (zabel & achord 2004; connor et al. 2005), but it remains unknown as to whether the net effect of reservoir residualism is positive or negative. in this study, we collected juvenile spring chinook salmon near spawning areas above reservoirs and below three dams in the middle fork willamette river (fig. 1). the study population was primarily the offspring of adults outplanted in the middle fork willamette river (hereafter, ‘middle fork’) plus some juvenile hatchery salmon that were released in separate studies. our primary objectives were to: (i) describe basic juvenile life history characteristics of the study population; (ii) assess evidence for reservoir entrap- ment of juvenile migrants; and (iii) estimate salmon mortality associated with dam passage, and evaluate potential causative factors. we hypothesised that downstream emigration timing would differ among sites, with predominant spring emigration from areas above reservoirs and wintertime dam passage when reservoirs were drawn down near annual lows. we further expected that samples collected below dams would include reservoir-entrapped salmon that were older and larger than typical yearling smolts. lastly, we hypothesised that salmon dam passage mortality would vary among salmon size classes and among dams given probable size-, timing- and route-related differences in dam passage hazards. methods salmon collection juvenile chinook salmon were collected in rotary screw traps at ﬁve middle fork sites (fig. 1). traps were deployed downstream from fall creek dam (2006–2009), hills creek dam (2003–2004) and lookout point dam (2007–2010), in unimpounded reaches above fall creek reservoir (2005–2008) and in the north fork middle fork willamette river (2007– 2008; hereafter ‘north fork’). each study site had a single 2.44 m trap, except two traps that were operated below lookout point dam starting in fall of 2009. emergence timing of middle fork juvenile chinook salmon varies with incubation water temperatures, but most fry hatch from november through march (myers et al. 2006). the timing of screw trap operations was selected to maximise collection of juvenile spring 223 keefer et al. fall creek dam fall creek north dexter dam lookout point dam mid dle fork hills creek dam wa or willamette basin id north fork mf salmon creek salt creek 46on

oregon. chinook salmon, but was somewhat haphazard among sites and years. deployments were restricted by trap and personnel availability, low summer discharge and some ﬂood events. traps were also removed when salmon catch rates approached zero. given these constraints, direct comparisons among sites and years were necessarily qualitative. we checked traps daily or on alternate days. chinook salmon were placed in a 19-l bucket ﬁlled with 15 l of river water and 2–3 ml of an anaesthetic solution of nine parts ethanol to one part clove leaf oil (glorybee foods, inc., eugene, or, usa). other species were enumerated and released. fork lengths of all unmarked (presumed wild-origin) salmon were measured, except on days when large numbers of similarly sized salmon were collected. in these cases, size was estimated to the nearest 1 cm. salmon with hatchery marks (i.e., ﬁn clips, brands, dyes) were not measured and were excluded from most analyses because these ﬁsh were not produced by outplanted adults. the exceptions were that marked salmon were used in screw trap efﬁciency tests (see below) and were included in the sample collected below hills creek dam in 2003–2004. the size distribution and migration timing of the hills creek hatchery group were similar to those for unmarked ﬁsh (i.e., mean fork length = 20.9 cm for hatchery ﬁsh and 19.3 cm for 224 unmarked ﬁsh), and the two groups were pooled unless otherwise noted. all chinook salmon recovered in a 19-l bucket ﬁlled with fresh river water and were then released near the capture sites. screw trap efﬁciency tests trap capture efﬁciency downstream from dams was estimated using juvenile chinook salmon from wil- lamette hatchery. at lookout point dam, tests were conducted using 8892 live and 8800 dead juvenile hatchery salmon on 7 days in november–january, 2009–2010. live salmon were released above the dam into turbine outwashes, and dead salmon were released into a single operating turbine outlet or distributed evenly across turbines when multiple units were operated. similar tests at fall creek dam were conducted in the same months using 7500 live and 6250 dead hatchery salmon released into the regulat- ing outlet channel. a third, small-scale test at fall creek dam in 2006 used 200–400 live hatchery salmon released into the primary stilling basin in february and march. all test salmon at the dams were 9–15 cm, and all were marked using caudal ﬁn clipping or coloured dyes. efﬁciency tests above reservoirs in february–march included 528 and 830 live chinook salmon fry released upstream from the fall creek (2005) and north fork (2007) respectively. traps, data analyses life history summaries for the chinook salmon sampled at each trap site were inferred from fork length and migration timing data. these evaluations were qualitative because no scale or otolith data were collected and because information about chinook salmon growth rates in middle fork reservoirs is only available from historic studies (e.g., odfw 1976). recent unpublished age data derived from scales of juvenile chinook salmon collected in willamette basin reservoirs [oregon department of fish and wildlife (odfw), corvallis, or, usa] were used with salmon length data to help infer life history designations. as trapping effort was inconsistent among sites and years, capture rates (chinook salmon per trap per day) were used to evaluate migration timing patterns and effects of river environment and dam operations. in the samples collected below dams, we used weighted linear regression (zar 1999) to test for associations between salmon catch rates and both reservoir eleva- tion and total in these models, elevation was binned by 1.5 m intervals, and river discharge was binned by 10 m3æs)1 intervals. days of trap operations in each bin was used as the weighting term. river discharge. chinook salmon mortality was deﬁned as the percentage of salmon collected in screw traps that were dead. this almost certainly underestimated the proportion of dead ﬁsh that passed the trap sites, because trap efﬁciency was lower for dead than live hatchery chinook salmon in tests conducted down- stream from lookout point and fall creek dams (see results). the magnitude of this bias was unknown and presumably varied with discharge volume, velocity and conﬁguration at each site and with salmon size (e.g., thedinga et al. 1994). we therefore consider the reported estimates to be indices of juvenile salmon mortality; more rigorous experimental designs will be needed to reﬁne estimates, identify passage route- speciﬁc effects and quantify extraneous effects (e.g., temperature, predator, dissolved gas and trap effects). we evaluated salmon mortality downstream from the three dams using weighted linear regression models similar to those described above for trapping rates, but weighted by numbers of salmon collected in each elevation, discharge or fork length bin. we also used a series of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to estimate mortality probabilities using individual salmon data (allison 1999). predictor variables in the logistic models included salmon fork length, reservoir elevation, river discharge and several interaction terms that were identiﬁed as potentially chinook salmon entrapment and mortality inﬂuential in exploratory analyses (see results). we used an information theoretic approach to compare 15 logistic regression models for each of the three below- dam trap samples. the models were ranked using akaike’s information criteria (aic) and were evalu- ated with respect to daic, the change in aic relative to the most parsimonious model (burnham & ander- son 2002). regulating outlet spill occurred at lookout point and hills creek dams in most years, primarily during peak winter discharge events. we did not include regulating outlet spill in the logistic model comparisons because of the lack of independence between spill and total discharge and because the hills creek trap was located below the turbines, but upstream from the regulating outlet discharge site. we emphasise that this modelling exercise was not intended to be predictive, but rather was conducted to identify broad-scale patterns and generate hypotheses to test in future controlled experiments. results capture efﬁciency from 0.00% to at all sites, almost all recapture events occurred on the release day. live salmon capture efﬁciencies ranged from 0.00% to 2.40% (mean = 1.08%) below fall creek dam and 1.87% (mean = 0.84%) below lookout point dam. mean dead ﬁsh capture efﬁciencies were 0.00% below fall creek dam and 0.08 (mean = 0.02) below lookout point dam. above reservoirs, capture efﬁciencies for live salmon fry ranged from 3.91% to 12.50% (mean = 7.64%) in fall creek and from 0.69% to 0.75% (mean = 0.72%) in the north fork middle fork. from 0.00 ranged to chinook salmon catch screw traps were operated for 2950 days, including 521 days at the upstream fall creek site, 889 days below fall creek dam, 357 days in the north fork, 469 days below hills creek dam, and 715 days below lookout point dam. the total at lookout point included 136 days when two traps were operated in 2009–2010. effort was reduced in july–august below fall creek and lookout point dams and at the upper fall creek and north fork sites in late summer and fall due to low catch rates and shallow water (fig. 2). a total of 13,365 juvenile chinook salmon were trapped and measured across all sites and years, with the majority (69%) collected in fall creek above the reservoir (table 1). trapping rates were 17.9 salmon per day in fall creek, 1.2 salmon per day below fall creek dam, 4.5 salmon per day in the north fork, 2.0 salmon per day below hills creek dam and 0.7 225 keefer et al. fc fcd e t i s nf hcd lpd 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 month 8 9 10 11 12 timing at ﬁve middle fork fig. 2. screw trap deployment willamette river study sites. fc, fall

collected varied among years by an order of magnitude in fall creek and below lookout point dam and by a factor of 2–4 at the north fork, fall creek dam and hills creek dam sites due to differences in salmon abundance and in the timing and duration of trap operations. emigration timing salmon were collected primarily from february to june in traps above reservoirs and from november to january in traps below dams (fig. 3). catch rates were highest in february (49 salmon per day) and march (74 salmon per day) in fall creek and in march–may (9–13 salmon per day) in the north fork. below dams, november–january catch rates were 2–4 salmon per day (fall creek dam), 2–12 salmon per day (hills creek dam) and 1–4 salmon per day (lookout point dam). trapped at higher trapping rates below dams signiﬁcantly increased as reservoir elevation decreased (0.19 £ r2 £ 0.48, p < 0.05, weighted regressions). below fall creek dam, some salmon were trapped at most reservoir elevations, but the highest rates were 5–6 salmon per day at elevations near the minimum operating eleva- tion between 220 and 230 m (full reservoir = 254 m). below hills creek dam, the highest rates were 4–11 salmon per day (443–447 m) and very few salmon were reser- voir = 470 m). below lookout point dam, the highest rate (2.3 salmon per day) was at 255 m, and almost no salmon were trapped at elevations >260 m except during reser- voir = 285 m). trapping rates signiﬁcantly increased as total discharge increased below fall creek and lookout point dams (0.73 £ r2 £ 0.81, p £ 0.006) dams, but not below hills creek dam (r2 = 0.55, p = 0.260). in most cases, high discharge coincided with low reservoir elevation in winter. a may elevations (full (full 2008 spill event size classes salmon trapped upstream from reservoirs were pre- dominantly subyearlings plus small numbers of year- ling ﬁsh, whereas those trapped below dams included a variety of size and age classes including ﬁsh older than age 1 that were presumably entrapped in reservoirs (figs. 4 and 5). across sites and years, chinook salmon fork lengths ranged from 2 to 38 cm (grand mean = 6.1, sd = 6.1 cm). on average, sal- mon were smallest in fall creek (mean = 3.4, sd = 1.1, median = 3 cm) and the north fork (mean = 4.8, sd = 2.3, median = 4 cm). salmon table 1. annual and total numbers of juvenile chinook salmon collected in rotary screw

hills creek dam, 15.6 (sd = 6.0, median = 14 cm) below look- out point dam, and 14.6 (sd = 8.2, median = 19 cm) below fall creek dam. subyearlings in the 3–5 cm range made up 96% of the fall creek sample and 78% of the north fork sample. salmon in this size class were ﬁrst trapped in december or january and some were present through early summer at both sites (fig. 5). a group of 8–12 cm salmon trapped in late fall at both above-reservoir sites indicated that some spent additional months rearing near spawning areas before emigrating. in addition, small percentages of the fall creek (1%) and north fork (6%) salmon collected in winter and early spring were 9–15 cm and were presumed yearlings. the fall creek dam sample was more complex, with three modes in the fork length distribution (fig. 4). about 31% were 3–5 cm subyearlings and trapped during december–february (fig. 5) 10% were 9–15 cm and trapped during novem- ber–february (presumed yearlings). the remaining 59% of the sample was 16–29 cm (ages uncertain). no small (3–5 cm) subyearlings were collected below hills creek dam, and the size distribution there was bimodal, with 10% presumed yearlings (8– 15 cm) and 90% of unknown age (16–32 cm). both size classes were collected primarily during novem- ber–february (fig. 5), and hatchery-marked and unmarked salmon had similar characteristics. the salmon size

that passed lookout point dam during the may 2008 spill event spanned size classes and included several of the largest salmon collected. dam passage mortality the percentage of chinook salmon that was dead inside screw traps was low above reservoirs (annual rates = 0.0–1.9%) and relatively high below dams (annual rates = 7.8–58.8%; table 2). across years, total mortality estimates below dams were 53.2% (hills creek), 25.2% (lookout point) and 13.8% (fall creek). chinook salmon mortality had a signiﬁcant, positive linear relationship with salmon size at all trap sites except fall creek (fig. 6). in weighted linear regression models, fork length explained 23–63% of the variability in mortality at sites above reservoirs and 228 35–80% of (p < 0.005 except fall creek p = 0.079). the variability at sites below dams below dams, chinook salmon mortality was asso- ciated with reservoir elevation and river discharge in addition to ﬁsh size. univariate logistic regression models using the environmental variables were sig- niﬁcant (p < 0.05) in most cases, but the direction of the effects differed among sites. for example, mor- tality increased with increasing reservoir elevation above hills creek and lookout point dams, but decreased as elevation increased above fall creek dam. similarly, mortality decreased as discharge increased below fall creek and hills creek dams, but the opposite was true below lookout point dam. in exploratory multivariate analyses, there were interactive effects among reservoir elevation, river discharge and salmon size, presumably related to among-year environmental variability, to salmon of different size classes passing at different seasons (see fall creek fall creek dam chinook salmon entrapment and mortality north fork hills creek

linear (p < 0.0001) and fork length · reservoir elevation (p < 0.0001) was most parsimonious (table 3). in this model the lowest mortality probability was for the smallest ﬁsh and when reservoir elevation was lowest. at lookout point dam, the full model was most parsimonious, and no other models had statistical support (all daic ‡ 9.2; table 3). each term was signiﬁcant: fork length (p = 0.0037), reservoir eleva- tion (p = 0.0005), river discharge (p = 0.0116), fork length · reservoir elevation (p = 0.0043) and fork length · river discharge (p = 0.0012). there was a relatively strong salmon size effect, with much higher probability of mortality for larger ﬁsh, increasing mortality at higher reservoir elevation and modest increases in mortality with increasing river discharge. thirteen percent the lookout point sample was collected during a may 2008 regulating outlet spill event when reservoir elevation was 281 m. the most parsimonious model with these ﬁsh excluded had fork length (p = 0.777), river discharge (p = 0.028) and fork length · river dis- charge (p = 0.003). mortality probability was highest for large salmon during high discharge, whereas mortality

passage mortality risks. some salmon almost certainly residualised in reservoirs for a year or more, and mortality was high when these larger ﬁsh eventually passed dams. the migration timing and size data collected upstream from reservoirs represented likely normative migration behaviour for the study populations, where volitional downstream movements were in response to biological or physiological cues. in contrast, movements through reservoirs and past dams appeared to be constrained by operational conditions, and passage was probably more opportu- nistic than volitional. the vast majority of the salmon passed dams in late fall and winter when reservoirs were drawn down near annual lows. this reservoir elevation effect was also observed for more than a dozen other species collected in the below-dam screw traps, including 10s of thousands of nonnative juvenile centrarchids (keefer et al., in press). the salmon size data provided evidence for at least two – and possibly as many as four – chinook salmon age classes in the aggregate sample. salmon collected above reservoirs were predominately small subyear- lings (3–5 cm) that emigrated from spawning areas within weeks to several months after emergence. this subyearling behaviour is relatively common among willamette river spring chinook salmon (friesen 2005; friesen et al. 2007) and in other populations where growth opportunities improve downstream from spawning sites (e.g., bjornn 1971; connor et al. 2001). much smaller percentages of the above-reser- voir samples were presumed yearlings that had probably begun smoltiﬁcation in preparation for rapid emigration to the ocean. residency. samples collected below dams were more pheno- typically diverse. there were some small subyearlings (3–5 cm) and 10–50% of the annual samples were probably yearlings (10–15 cm). the latter group either reared in reservoirs as subyearlings or entered reser- voirs as yearlings and passed through with limited reservoir in previous studies, hatchery salmon reared in fall creek reservoir averaged 11–17 cm by december (odfw 1976), and yearlings in other columbia river populations are typically 10–16 cm by late winter (giorgi et al. 1997; beckman et al. 2003; copeland & venditti 2009). we were therefore large (20–38 cm) middle fork juveniles collected below dams. some may have been yearlings (or even subyearlings) that grew very rapidly in reservoirs (e.g., connor & burge 2003). others were probably 2- and possibly 3-year-old salmon that residualised after failing to pass downstream. the largest juveniles were collected below lookout point dam, and we certain about age of less the chinook salmon entrapment and mortality hypothesise that these ﬁsh spent up to a year each in the hills creek and lookout point reservoirs. reservoir that several the combined migration timing and fork length data suggest life history strategies may be expressed by middle fork salmon. these include: (i) subyearling emigration (e.g., friesen et al. 2007); (ii) stream resident rearing followed by yearling emigration (e.g., groot & margolis 1991); (iii) reser- voir rearing with yearling emigration (e.g., connor et al. 2005); and (iv) residualising with emigration after age 1 (e.g., usfws 1993). quanti- fying the incidence of these strategies will require tagging studies or age estimates from otolith or scale samples (e.g., fisher & pearcy 2005; volk et al. 2010). in a preliminary analysis, scales from salmon collected in lookout point reservoir and other wil- lamette basin reservoirs support the above life history designations (l. borgersen, odfw, personal commu- nication). some scales had two annuli, clearly dem- onstrating residualisation; some indicated extended reservoir rearing followed by winter outmigration, and others indicated more typical subyearling and yearling migrations. the survival costs and beneﬁts of these various strategies and the contribution of the various phenotypes to adult returns currently remain unknown. time spent in reservoirs may confer some competitive advantages, including larger size during outmigration (e.g., zabel & achord 2004; monzyk et al. 2009) and increased survival to adulthood (connor et al. 2005). however, such beneﬁts must be weighed against increased dam passage mortality for larger ﬁsh, migration delay and asynchrony between physiologi- cal readiness and migration opportunity. our index of annual chinook salmon mortality downstream from dams ranged from 8% to 59% and varied considerably among sites and years. at all sites, mortality was almost certainly underestimated, given lower capture efﬁciency for dead versus live salmon. we also did not attempt to measure whether trap- related mortality differed among sites or to differen- tiate between direct (i.e., acute) versus delayed effects. the latter have accounted for a large portion of total dam-related mortality in several studies (e.g., kostecki et al. 1987; dubois & gloss 1993; ferguson et al. 2006). for the above reasons, we expect that total chinook salmon mortality associated with dam pas- sage in the middle fork was higher than the estimates presented. biases associated with low dead-salmon capture efﬁciency and delayed mortality were proba- bly higher than any estimate inﬂation due to trap- related mortality, particularly given the low mortality above reservoirs (<2%) and in other screw trap studies (e.g., scace et al. 2007; music et al. 2010). salmon size was a consistent mortality predictor across sites, but especially below dams. in all cases, mortality signiﬁcantly increased with salmon size. 231 keefer et al. this suggests that large salmon were more susceptible than small salmon to lethal or sub-lethal injuries from shear stress, cavitation, turbine blade strikes, rapid pressure changes, or blunt force trauma. many of the dead salmon below dams had injuries consistent with one or several of these mechanisms (i.e., decapitation, swim bladder ruptures, contusions, descaling), and it is likely that the types of injuries varied with dam passage route and operational criteria (e.g., coutant & whitney 2000; cˇ ada 2001; ferguson et al. 2008; deng et al. 2010). we assumed that trap efﬁciencies were not grossly different for large and small size classes, but experiments that could conﬁrm or reject this assumption would increase conﬁdence in the estimates. turbine vs. although salmon size was clearly important, envi- ronmental and operational effects were also predictive in the multi-model comparison. the tested models included signiﬁcant size by environment interaction effects, in part because salmon size varied nonran- domly through each year. for example, different size classes passed each dam in different months and years and therefore encountered different conditions. this exploratory portion of our analysis was somewhat confounded by uncertainty about which passage routes (i.e., regulating outlet) salmon used. however, after accounting for size effects, mortality below lookout point dam was clearly higher when discharge and reservoir elevation were high and when the regulating outlet was open. mortality below hills creek dam was also higher when elevation was high, and it is possible that greater depth to turbines or regulating outlet intakes increased pressure- or shear- related mortality at these dams. in contrast, mortality at fall creek dam decreased as discharge increased and was mixed in relation to reservoir elevation. possible explanations include wider opening of the regulating outlets during high discharge (reducing blunt force traumas) and the potentially confounding interaction effects associated with salmon size and passage timing (i.e., far more subyearlings passed fall creek dam than the other dams). the apparently contradictory mortality patterns among dams and differences in annual and total mortality estimates highlight a need for route-speciﬁc juvenile survival studies at the willamette projects. if juvenile production becomes a priority in the adult outplant programs, partitioning route-speciﬁc and operation-speciﬁc injury and mortality rates at the dams (e.g., bickford & skalski 2000; mathur et al. 2000; budy et al. 2002) should be a high priority. our results suggest there may be among-dam and seasonal differences in the proportions of salmon using each route, among-route differences in passage hazards and size-related effects that are dam or route speciﬁc. that 232 in conclusion, we demonstrated that adult chinook salmon outplanted above middle fork dams can produce thousands of viable juveniles. these juve- niles volitionally moved downstream in large num- bers from early spring through early summer and entered reservoirs as they were rapidly ﬁlling. increasing depth to turbine and regulating outlet intakes during this time probably prevented continued downstream passage for many ﬁsh, and the entrap- ment delays may be especially consequential for yearling smolts that have started the physiological transformation needed for ocean entry. mitigating for reservoir entrapment and dam passage mortality will require a substantial investment in ﬁsh collection or bypass systems (e.g., ward et al. 1997; ferguson et al. 1998; nmfs 2008), ﬁsh-friendly modiﬁcations of existing passage routes (i.e., reducing sharp turns and abrasive surfaces inside regulating outlet chan- nels) and potentially reservoir drawdown during periods of peak salmon emigration. acknowledgements this
