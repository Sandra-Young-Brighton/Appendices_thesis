(2004) revealed that brown_trout dominated white-spotted charr in interference competition at 12 °c. however, we have no information about temperature-mediated competition between white-spotted charr and brown_trout. understanding of interspeciﬁc competition between these species must contribute to conservation of white-spotted charr which distribute in only north- eastern asia (watson 1999) from brown_trout inva- sion. the current longitudinal distribution patterns in the stream thus provide an opportunity to examine the doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00254.x 189 hasegawa & maekawa possibility of competition between both species. the effect of temperature-mediated study area monbetsu stream is a mountainous stream about 17 km long and a branch of chitose river (42º49¢n, 141º27¢e). as a hydroelectric dam constructed in the chitose river blocks migration between monbetsu stream and the sea, the native white-spotted charr are land locked. the weir (1 m height), which was constructed in 1976, is located 12 km upstream from the conﬂuence with the chitose river. except for the weir, there are no waterfalls that restrict ﬁsh movement in the stream. brown_trout have been introduced into the stream below the weir by anglers in the 1980s and currently are progressively replacing white-spotted charr as the dominant salmonid, while white-spotted charr had inhabited allopatry above the weir because the weir had prevented trout from invading upstream (takami et al. 2002). however, there is no information about how they were introduced, how many, etc. so that the situation probably still is very unstable. the weir ruptured during the winter in 2004–2005, so that mostly adult trout, which have better mobility than fry, have been able to invade upstream since then (k. hasegawa, personal observation). we conducted a ﬁeld survey below the weir because we were not sure that whether the distribution pattern of above the weir was caused by temperature-mediated competition or temporal restriction for brown_trout dispersion. sculpin cottus nozawae, roach noemacheilus barbat- ulus, dace tribolodon ezoe and brook lamprey lethenteron reissneri were rare in monbetsu stream (takami et al. 2002). materials and methods a ﬁeld survey was conducted in summer (june to august) 2006. summer water temperature condition maximises charr foraging activity (takami et al. 1997), so that effect of competition may clearly appear in summer. the survey was conducted in the season when both species do not migrate for spawning, so that we could examine the effect of interspeciﬁc competition on longitudinal distribution patterns of both species. we established 200-m-long study sections for every 1 km below the weir (12 sections). all sections are located at an altitude of 50–210 m above sea level. sections were numbered through downstream to upstream. water temperature was measured every 30 min from 14 june to 31 august by a stowaway tidbit temperature logger (onset computer corpora- tion, pocasset, ma, usa). loggers were set at the downstream end of each section. mean water tempera- ture fell from downstream to upstream (fig. 1). 190 c ° ( e r u t

mean water temperature or mean gradient. generally, the gradient of streams is higher in upstream areas (bisson & montogomery 1996). gradient positively correlated to current velocity, which is an important environmental factor for salmonid habitat selection (newbury 1996). current velocity varies even within a study section, thus we used gradient as a surrogate of over all current velocities. we measured gradient of sections by inclinometer. the gradient of each section was deﬁned as the mean gradient of 30 m reaches measured at every 50 m. however, the mean gradients apparently did not relate to stream longitude (fig. 1). to estimate brown_trout ratio, which is the proportion of brown_trout in the catch of salmonids in each section, we conducted a three-pass removal sampling using an electroﬁsher inc., vancouver, wa, usa). all captured ﬁsh were anaes- thetised using phenoxyethanol and their fork length was measured to the nearest 1 mm. for white-spotted charr and brown_trout, we could easily distinguish young-of-the-year fry and other ages (adult) by the difference in fork length (see hasegawa & maekawa 2006). interspeciﬁc competition in the adult stage may hold the key to the replacement, because adult density is related more strongly to population persistence than is juvenile density (morita & yokota 2002). thus, we used the total number of adult ﬁsh caught by three-pass removal to calculate brown_trout ratio. if the number of captured ﬁsh was less than 10 in a section, the section was excluded from the brown_trout ratio analysis because of too small a sample size. then, we analysed relationships between mean water temperature or gradient and brown_trout ratio by using kendall’s correlation test. the alpha level was set at p = 0æ05. (smith-root results in total, 131 charr and 173 trout were caught during the survey. only 15 charr (<65 mm) and six trout (<42 mm) were judged as fry from their fork length. mean fork length ± sd of adult charr (>92 mm) and 173æ3 ± 60æ7 mm and trout (>110 mm) were effect of temperature on salmonid distribution patterns table 1. number of captured adult white-spotted charr and brown_trout, and total number of captured ﬁsh in each study section were shown.

(2004) the presence of temperature-mediated competition between both species. as brown_trout ratio signiﬁ- cantly correlated with water temperature, the signiﬁ- cant negative correlation between brown_trout ratio and stream longitude might be due to water temperature. in this study, brown_trout were abundant in lower sections where water temperature is relat- ively high. hasegawa et al. revealed that brown_trout dominated white-spotted charr in inter- ference competition at 12 °c. however, our ﬁeld results show that brown_trout ratio was 0æ5 at a water temperature of about 11æ2 °c (fig. 3a). this could mean that there is a turning point of dominancy that occurs around 11 °c. takami et al. (2002) suggested dramatic replacement of white-spotted charr by brown_trout through interspeciﬁc competition below the weir. this interspeciﬁc competition is probably temperature-mediated competition, in which brown_trout dominate white-spotted charr at higher water 191 hasegawa & maekawa temperature. body size of white-spotted charr tended to be large in downstream. as competitive ability of salmonid species depends on body size (nakano 1995), large white-spotted charr may be able to endure negative effect of interspeciﬁc competition. in addition, hasegawa & maekawa (2006) found that brown_trout ratio negatively correlated with abun- dance of woody debris. they speculated that white- spotted charr might be able to inhabit in woody debris abundant area because woody debris mitigated interference competition between both species by visual isolation. however, there was plenty of woody debris from place to place in monbetsu stream (takami et al. 2002) so that abundance of woody debris might not relate to stream longitude in the stream. thus, the number of woody debris may not relate to longitudinal distribution patterns of white- spotted charr and brown_trout. above the ruptured weir, several brown_trout were caught (k. hasegawa, personal observation), which shows that the weir is passable for brown_trout. elso & giller (2001) reported that brown_trout occurred in a colder area than our study area, which shows that water temperature may not prevent brown_trout invasion into the upstream area of the stream. however, if temperature-mediated interspeciﬁc com- petition existed between white-spotted charr and brown_trout, there should be a limit for brown_trout to disperse upstream. to fully evaluate temperature- mediated competition, an understanding of tempera- ture-speciﬁc effects of competition on foraging rate, which determines growth and survival rate through interference competition, is required (see taniguchi & nakano 2000) because those rates connect to individ- ual ﬁtness. in addition, the difference of temperature tolerance for each competing species should be considered. moreover, this study was conducted at a site where the start point and period of trout invasion were clear. to examine non-native species invasion, information about where and when invasion began is necessary to avoid the possible scenario that there has been a recent invasion only around the study sites. we will be able to evaluate brown_trout invasion accurately in monbetsu stream. acknowledgements we thank r. adams, y. umatani, s. takamura and y. kanbe
