e-mail: a.d.nunn@hull.ac.uk accepted for publication october 28, 2009 introduction the population behaviours associated with the migra- tions of ﬁshes in lowland rivers are amongst the most poorly-understood dispersal mechanisms in temperate freshwater ecosystems. this contrasts with upland systems, which are invariably dominated by salmonid ﬁshes, and for which knowledge is far superior compared with cyprinid-dominated lowland rivers. it is only relatively recently that the prevalence and magnitude of migrations by non-salmonid ﬁshes have begun to become appreciated. a number of sturgeon species (acipenseridae), for example, may migrate more than 3000 km in unobstructed rivers, and considerable distances can be covered by a range of ﬁsh species, including some previously considered to be sedentary, even in comparatively small water- courses (see baras & lucas 2001). the increase in understanding of migrations in recent years has led to concerns over the possible impacts of barriers on the distribution, population structures, spawning success and recruitment of many species (ponton et al. 2000; nunn et al. 2008). indeed, migration barriers are now recognised as one of the key threats to freshwater ﬁshes world-wide (baras & lucas 2001), particularly for the recovery of impacted populations (albanese et al. 2009). although the importance of longitudinal, and lateral, migrations of ﬁshes for spawning purposes is becoming increasingly recognised, much less is known about non-spawning migrations and the sig- niﬁcance of tributaries to riverine ﬁsh populations. a number of studies have reported migrations of ﬁsh between rivers and their tributaries, such as doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00399.x 153 nunn et al. for movements of rifﬂe minnow leuciscus soufﬁa agas- sizii between the river argen (germany) and a tributary (wocher & ro¨sch 2006), and those of barbel barbus barbus between the rivers ouse and nidd, england (lucas & batley 1996). moreover, tributaries and ﬂoodplain annexes can be important the recruitment of ﬁsh populations in the main channel, particularly in regulated river systems (cattane´o et al. 2001; pollux et al. 2006; nunn et al. 2007a), yet few studies have examined the intensity (hohausova´ et al. 2003) and ⁄ or probability of ﬁshes moving into off- channel habitats. indeed, literature concerning sea- sonal and diel non-spawning migrations is relatively scarce, and little is known of the year-round move- ments of multiple ﬁsh species between lowland rivers and their tributaries. the aim of the study was thus to examine the timing, intensity and direction of ﬁsh movements during day and night between the main stem and a tributary of the river avon (hampshire, england). the speciﬁc objectives were to: (i) deter- mine the probability of diel ﬁsh movements in different seasons and (ii) identify the explanatory variables of diel and seasonal migration patterns. given that hydrology and seasonal variability form a complex driver of ﬁsh recruitment success in river systems (cattane´o et al. 2001; nunn et al. 2003, 2007b), it was predicted that species-speciﬁc differ- ences in diel and seasonal migration patterns (i.e., in the probabilities of movement) between the river avon and its tributary are triggered by speciﬁc combinations of environmental conditions. study area, material and methods the river avon is a groundwater-dominated river that originates from chalk springs near burbage, wiltshire, and ﬂows south for 100 km before discharging into the english channel at christchurch. the majority of the avon is designated a site of special scientiﬁc interest, as well as a special area of conservation, a special protection area and a ramsar site, but the system is nonetheless impacted by a variety of factors (wheeldon 2003). the present study focuses on the conﬂuence of a small tributary, ibsley brook, with the middle reaches of the river avon. the brook (also known locally as northend stream) is a narrow (1– 5 m), relatively short (about 1.5 km) water course that drains a small tributary catchment (49 ha) that lies almost entirely within the ﬂood plain of the river avon (50:54:13:n, 01:47:17:w). near its conﬂuence with the avon, is generally trapezoidal (mean width = 4 m, mean depth = 0.6 m) with predominantly silt, sand and gravel substratum and variable water velocities, to fast )1). the brook’s discharge is variable, (10–15 cmæs depending upon season and the discharge of the avon the brook’s channel from null 154 fig. 1. discharge regime of the river avon (hampshire, england). fish traps were exposed over 24-h on dates indicated by large black dots. (fig. 1), which inﬂuences subterranean ﬂows that feed the brook. fish species in ibsley brook and the river avon are mainly native species (carter et al. 2004), including european bullhead cottus gobio, stone loach barbatula barbatula, threespine stickleback gasteros- teus aculeatus, gudgeon gobio gobio, dace leuciscus leuciscus, chub l. cephalus, roach rutilus rutilus, common bream abramis brama, atlantic salmon salmo_salar, brown_trout s. trutta, european eel anguilla anguilla, northern pike esox lucius, eurasian perch perca ﬂuviatilis, barbel, tench tinca tinca, european minnow phoxinus phoxinus, rudd scardi- nius erythrophthalmus, ninespine stickleback pungi- tius pungitius and introduced common carp cyprinus carpio. brook lamprey lampetra planeri are also present in both the river and brook. field sampling fish migrations between the river avon and ibsley brook were assessed over forty-seven 24-h periods fish migrations between a river and tributary correspondence (samples-by-species, probabilities of diel ﬁsh movement (i.e., day ⁄ night, immigration ⁄ emigration) were estimated according to both season and age class using bayesian inference (gelman et al. 2004). the use of bayesian inference over classical ⁄ frequentist techniques has been dis- cussed extensively on the grounds of both philosophy and pragmatism (clark 2005). in this study, it was considered that analysing ﬁsh movements in terms of probabilities, rather than null hypotheses, improved the presentation and interpretation of the results, thereby facilitating comparisons by future studies. for seasonal movements, due to the presence of zero values in the sample · species data matrix, ﬁshes were grouped a priori by subjecting the data for all dates combined to canonical analysis (cca), as per ter braak (1986), using the ade software library (thioulouse et al. 1997; chessel & thioulouse 1998). analysis of the data matri- ces samples-by-environmental trends) was used to reveal the best synthetic gradients that maximise species ⁄ age-class separation (ter braak & verdonschot 1995). triplots were produced (ter braak 1986) that combined the ordina- tions of samples, species ⁄ age classes and environmen- tal vectors relevant ordination axes (dimensions), and which revealed associations be- tween species ⁄ age groups for axis 1 versus axis 2 and versus axis 3 (fig. 2). the groups were (table 1 for codes): cyprinids (ab0, ab1, cc0, gg0, gg1, lc0, lc1, ll0, ll1, pp0, rr0, rr1), benthic non-cyprinids (cg0, cg1, nb0, nb1), sticklebacks (ga0, pu0) or potential piscivores (‘predators’: an0, an1, el0, el1, pf0, pf1) (‘0’ = 0+ age class, ‘1’ = 1+ age class). for eel (an0, an1), the sufﬁx indicates the number of years spent in fresh water, rather than the age of the ﬁsh per se. seasons were deﬁned as spring (march– may), summer (june–august), autumn (september– november) or winter (december–february). for both seasonal and age-class movements, the number of individuals of each group ⁄ species immigrating and emigrating was then summed over all sampling events. this resulted, for each group · season · time of day (seasonal movements) and species · age · time of day (age-class movements) combination, in the simple binomial mode: in addition, (trends) for from november 1999 to october 2000 using traps of a design similar to fyke nets, whereby a square opening (51 cm · 51 cm) led into a conical ‘fyke’ section that itself led to a 7-cm diameter entrance. the overall length of the traps was 92 cm, and two traps were deployed at the river–brook conﬂuence. the leader net (210 · 100 cm, 5 mm mesh) of the entrance trap (immigration: river to brook) was set ﬂush with the avon’s banks and the exit trap (emigration: brook to river) spanned the entire width of the conﬂuence. setting the traps in this way, as opposed to in the river and tributary, ensured that migrating, than resident, ﬁshes were captured. the traps were exposed in a manner similar to bunt et al. (2002), with the nets emptied in the morning (as soon after dawn as possible) and in the evening (at dusk). as the traps spanned the entire width of the small conﬂuence, their efﬁciency was assumed to be high. all ﬁshes were measured (nearest mm) for either fork length (fl) or total length (tl), depending upon the species’ caudal- ﬁn morphology, and scale samples were collected for ageing purposes. immigrating ﬁshes were released in the brook 5 m upstream of the exit trap, and emigrat- ing ﬁshes were released in the river 5 m downstream of the entrance trap. rather each time the traps were set and emptied, four variables were recorded: time of day; water temperature (to nearest 0.5 °c); brook water level (in cm) at 10 and 100 m from its conﬂuence with the avon; and brook water velocity, which was categorised using a wooden pole positioned in the water column perpendicular to the brook bed (as described in carter et al. 2004): 1 = absent (no movement of water past pole), 2 = neg- ligible (minimal movement of water past pole: >0 but )1), 3 = slow (water movement but no rippled <5 cmæs )1), 4 = moderate (rip- effect around pole: 5–10 cmæs )1), )1 but £15 cmæs pled effect around pole: >10 cmæs )1). 5 = fast (pressure wave upstream of pole: >15 cmæs a preliminary study (copp et al. 2000) revealed a linear relationship between the water level (stage) in ibsley )1) of the avon brook and the discharge (q, in m3æs r2 = 0.893, f = 349.19, (stage = 2.534q + 34.01, d.f. = 42, p = 0.0001), so brook stage was used as a surrogate of river discharge (fig. 1). data analyses p yjhð þ ¼ bin yjn; h ð þ fishes were aged by scale reading and with reference to published information on lengths-at-age (e.g., britton 2007). analyses were restricted to 0+ and 1+ ﬁshes as these dominated the catches. numbers of ﬁshes captured were standardised as numbers per 10 h of trapping (i.e., catch per unit effort) to remove bias length. the due to differences in day and night samples collected overnight from 31 august to 1 september were grouped with the august samples. where y is the number of ﬁsh immigrating, n the total number of ﬁsh captured, and h the proportion of ﬁsh immigrating. to perform bayesian inference a uniform prior distribution for h in the interval [0, 1] (i.e., with individual ﬁsh having the same probability of either immigrating or emigrating) was deemed reasonable, in which case the posterior distribution is beta(h|a + y, b + n ) y). as per gelman et al.

results a total of 1770 specimens of 17 ﬁsh species was captured during the study (table 1), the majority of which were 0+ individuals (i.e., <1-year-old). the most abundant species were european bullhead, bream, chub, dace, european minnow, roach, stone loach and threespine stickleback. other species cap- tured in smaller numbers were european eel, gudgeon, eurasian perch, northern pike, ninespine stickleback, and single specimens of common carp (64 mm fl), rudd (87 mm fl), atlantic salmon (86 mm fl) and tench (425 mm fl). the cca triplots, of all sampling dates combined, revealed a relatively clear distinction between day (lower left half of plots a and b in fig. 2) and night-time samples (upper right half of plots a and b in fig. 2). simultaneous interpretation of the 1 · 2 (fig. 2a) and 1 · 3 (fig. 2b) plots revealed that cyprinid age classes were associated with each other during both day and night, as were those of benthic non-cyprinids and potential predators (most notably in fig. 2b). similarly, all stickleback movement occurred during the daytime except the movements of ninespine stickleback into ibsley brook, which occurred at night. the intensity and direction of ﬁsh movements between the river avon and ibsley brook varied temporally, both on a diel and seasonal basis, and there were species- and age-speciﬁc differences in behav- iour (tables 2 and 3). the movements of bullhead, stone loach, gudgeon and eel were mostly nocturnal, whereas pike, perch, minnow and threespine stickle- back were mainly diurnal; dace, bream, chub and roach showed less diel variation in behaviour (table 2). the direction of movements also differed between ﬁsh species (fig. 3). regardless of time of day ⁄ night, 0+ bream, dace and minnow always had a higher probability of moving into the brook than the river, whereas bullhead, pike, threespine stickleback and stone loach always had a higher probability of moving into the river. by contrast, 0+ chub and ninespine stickleback generally moved into the river in daylight and into the brook at night, whereas the opposite behaviour was observed in perch. amongst 1+ ﬁshes, bullhead and pike always had higher probabilities of emigrating (similar to 0+ individuals), and chub of immigrating, whereas different day–night behaviours were displayed by eel (immigration in fish migrations between a river

ﬁshes, cyprinids displayed the most diverse seasonal behaviours (figs 4 and 5). in spring and winter they emigrated (brook to river) in daylight and immigrated (river to brook) at night, whereas in summer the opposite behaviour was observed; autumn movements were 157 nunn et al. always into the brook. by contrast, benthic non- cyprinids always migrated out of the brook, regardless of season and time of day, except during daylight in summer when no migration was observed. stickle- backs always emigrated during daylight, regardless of season, and showed a preference for immigration at night (summer, autumn and winter), except in spring. finally, potential piscivores (predators) always emi- grated, except during daylight in summer when they immigrated (figs 4 and 5). the environmental factors affecting the direction of ﬁsh movements differed across groups (fig. 5). thus, immigrations of cyprinids were inﬂuenced by increas- ing river stage and brook water velocity, whereas benthic non-cyprinids emigrated with increasing velocity. by contrast, sticklebacks always emigrated during daylight and immigrated at night with increas- ing temperature, whereas potential piscivores emi- grated according to stage and time of day (fig. 5). discussion hydrological connectivity between rivers and their tributaries and ﬂood plains is essential for the natural functioning of river ecosystems (amoros & bravard 1985; amoros & roux 1988; copp 1989; junk et al. 1989; ward & stanford 1995). for ﬁshes, the signif- icance of connectivity between rivers and their ﬂood plains as spawning and nursery habitats is well known (e.g., welcomme 1985; hohausova´ et al. 2003). in some river systems, tributaries can serve similar functions as refuge and spawning or nursery habitats. for example, a range of ﬁsh species have been observed to use a tributary of the river meuse, the netherlands, as spawning, nursery and adult habitats (pollux et al. 2006). similarly, a number of tributaries of the river ouse (yorkshire, england) are important spawning lampreys (petromyzontidae), with little if any spawning occur- habitats for and nursery 158 fig. 3. bayesian posterior medians

river). ring in the ouse itself (nunn et al. 2008). notwith- standing, the migratory behaviour of ﬁshes in lowland river ecosystems, particularly of non-spawning migra- tions between rivers and tributaries, remains poorly understood. the most extensive migrations in the majority of temperate riverine ﬁshes occur in late spring and early summer, when most species congregate to spawn, and a number of studies have demonstrated that water temperature and photoperiod are inﬂuential factors (see baras & lucas 2001). by contrast, surprisingly few studies have identiﬁed the key environmental correlates for non-spawning migrations, which appear to vary between seasons as a function of a combina- tion of variables. knowledge of how riverine ﬁshes respond to environmental stimuli in dynamic ecosys- tems is fundamental to understanding the small-scale migrations often associated with foraging or predator evasion. the present study revealed diel and seasonal variations in the composition of ﬁshes migrating between a main river channel and a small tributary. cyprinids displayed the most diverse behaviours. in spring and winter, they emigrated (brook to river) in daylight and immigrated (river to brook) at night, whereas in summer the opposite behaviour was observed; autumn movements were always into the brook. seasonal movements were mostly driven by changes in river discharge and water temperature, particularly those associated with ﬂoods. speciﬁcally, cyprinids migrated from river to tributary with increasing river discharge and tributary water velocity, whereas bullhead and stone loach moved into the river. similar to the use of ﬂoodplain water bodies by ﬁshes during ﬂoods (e.g., hohausova´ et al. 2003), is possible that increasing river discharge and water velocity stimulated the ﬁshes to seek shelter, either in the tributary or the margins of the avon. this may be particularly the case for young or small ﬁshes, as studied here, due to their poor swimming

discharge and water velocity may have stimulated mid-water species, such as most of the cyprinids, to move upstream to compensate for downstream displacement, whereas benthic species, such bullhead and stone loach, may have moved downstream in response to increased bed load. changes in water temperature have also been corre- lated with shifts in the behaviour and habitat use of ﬁshes (alabaster & robertson 1961; hohausova´ et al. 2003; heermann & borcherding 2006). movements of ﬁshes may occur with or without changes in river level or temperature (hohausova et al. 2003), indicating that other factors can have an inﬂuence on migration behaviours. for example, habitat shifts in stream ﬁshes are often elevated at dusk and night in small streams (copp & jurajda 1993; bischoff & scholten 1996), irrespective of discharge conditions (copp et al. 2005a,b). in larger european water courses, such as the danube, ﬁsh tend to peak during densities daylight in water in side-channels (copp et al. 2005b), whereas 159 nunn et al. in some species and during daylight courses of small-to-medium width (e.g., rivers lee, morava and sieg) ﬁsh densities generally peak at night (copp & jurajda 1993, 1999; bischoff & scholten 1996; copp 2004; g.h. copp unpublished data). this general pattern appears to apply to the river garonne (mastrorillo & copp 2005), a rela- tively large river in southwestern france, where peak numbers of 0+ ﬁshes would be expected during daylight. in the river avon, a medium-sized river, diel movements appeared to be triggered by changes in light intensity and brook water velocity, with the numbers of migrating ﬁshes generally being greatest at night in others. notably, the movements of bullhead, stone loach, gudgeon and eel were mostly nocturnal, whereas pike, perch, minnow and threespine stickle- back were mainly diurnal; dace, bream, chub and roach showed less diel variation in behaviour. furthermore, although some species consistently moved from river to brook, others migrated from brook to river. in the migration of adult ﬁshes has been observed in the river derwent (yorkshire, england), with chub migrating at night, whereas other species migrated over a wide range of light conditions (lucas 2000). by contrast, stocked juvenile cyprinids migrated mostly during daylight. the decline in daytime movement between early winter and early spring inter-speciﬁc differences 160 fig. 5. canonical correspondence analysis triplot of movements (sufﬁx ‘i’ = from the river avon to ibsley brook; sufﬁx ‘o’ = from ibsley brook to the river

for details and explana- tion. samples by season are represented by 90% conﬁdence ellipses (green 1971). observed in this study has also been reported in the river rhine, with light the most important stimulus for the migration of most ﬁshes into backwaters and ﬂoodplain lakes at twilight (borcherding et al. 2002). suggested as other factors that may inﬂuence ﬁsh movements include the risk of predation. diurnal species seek refuge from predation at night and move to proﬁtable foraging habitats during daylight, while the opposite behaviour is characteristic of nocturnal species. in the present study, bullhead, stone loach and gudgeon were mostly nocturnal, whereas minnow and threespine stickleback were mainly diurnal, and it is possible that this was associated with directed movements to foraging habitats. explorative behaviour, which is often undirected and stochastic, will also contribute to observed ﬁsh distributions (vilizzi & copp 2005). however, inter-speciﬁc differences in the timing, intensity and direction of movements suggests that explorative movements were relatively unimportant at the population level. the activity of predators can also vary on a diel basis (copp & jurajda 1993, 1999). as anticipated, perch and pike, which are principally sight predators, were most active during daylight, whereas the eel, a mainly noctural predator, was most active at night. notwith- standing, the patterns in the probabilities of predator migration did not closely follow those of the prey there were consistent that species, and there was no evidence that predators adjusted their behaviour according to the movements of particular prey species. the impacts of habitat fragmentation on biodiver- sity have become increasingly recognised in recent years (saunders et al. 1991; fahrig 2003). in rivers, reduced hydrological connectivity may impede or eliminate access by ﬁshes to key habitats, and modiﬁcations to sediment dynamics may alter the quality of potential spawning areas. furthermore, tributary conﬂuences represent one of the most heterogeneous and biologically diverse freshwater habitats (benda et al. 2004). maintaining connectivity between rivers and their tributaries is essential given the importance of tributaries in the diel and seasonal cycles of ﬁshes, as well as a corridor for nutrient exchange (junk et al. 1989; ward & stanford 1995). any modiﬁcation to hydrological regimes may, tem- porarily or permanently, reduce or eliminate the connectivity between rivers and tributaries, with inherent implications for both resident and migratory biota. this study emphasises the importance of connectivity in river systems, as ﬁshes migrated in all ﬂow conditions, but especially during rapidly rising discharge.
