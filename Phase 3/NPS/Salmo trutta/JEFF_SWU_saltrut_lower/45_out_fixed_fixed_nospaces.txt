relationships between water temperatures and upstream migration, cold water refuge use, and spawning of adult bull trout from the lostine river, oregon, usa. ecology of freshwater fish 2010: 19: 96–106. published 2009. this article is a us government work and is in the public domain in the usa abstract – understanding thermal habitat use by migratory ﬁsh has been limited by difﬁculties in matching ﬁsh locations with water temperatures. to describe spatial and temporal patterns of thermal habitat use by migratory adult bull trout, salvelinus conﬂuentus, that spawn in the lostine river, oregon, we employed a combination of archival temperature tags, radio tags, and thermographs. we also compared temperatures of the tagged ﬁsh to ambient water temperatures to determine if the ﬁsh were using thermal refuges. the timing and temperatures at which ﬁsh moved upstream from overwintering areas to spawning locations varied considerably among individuals. the annual maximum 7-day average daily maximum (7dadm) temperatures of tagged ﬁsh were 16–18 °c and potentially as high as 21 °c. maximum 7dadm ambient water temperatures within the range of tagged ﬁsh during summer were 18–25 °c. however, there was no evidence of the tagged ﬁsh using localized cold water refuges. tagged ﬁsh appeared to spawn at 7dadm temperatures of 7–14 °c. maximum 7dadm temperatures of tagged ﬁsh and ambient temperatures at the onset of the spawning period in late august were 11–18 °c. water temperatures in most of the upper lostine river used for spawning and rearing appear to be largely natural since there has been little development, whereas downstream reaches used by migratory bull trout are heavily diverted for irrigation. although the population effects of these temperatures are unknown, summer temperatures and the higher temperatures observed for spawning ﬁsh appear to be at or above the upper range of suitability reported for the species. p. j. howell1, j. b. dunham2, p. m.

temperature on ﬁshes is an important management concern, especially for cold water species (poole et al. 2004), and a major challenge to deﬁne under ﬁeld conditions (eaton et al. 1995). among stream ﬁshes in north america, trout, salvelinus conﬂuentus, is noted for its association with cold water (selong et al. 2001; dunham et al. the bull 2003). temperature has been identiﬁed as an important limiting factor for this species, which is listed as threatened under the us endangered species act (usfws 1999). migratory adult bull trout spawn in late summer and fall in the cold upper reaches of stream networks, where juvenile rearing also occurs (pratt 1992). resident adults can also reside in those reaches throughout the year. after spawning, most migratory 96 doi:

migratory juveniles or subadults also move to downstream habitats before they mature. available data on temperature requirements for bull trout life stages include spawning, egg incubation, and early juvenile rearing (mccullough et al. 2001; selong et al. 2001; dunham et al. 2003). information on temperatures experienced during migration is very limited (e.g., swanberg 1997). habitats used for migration are frequently subject to more development and human inﬂuences, including elevated temperatures (poole & berman 2001; nelson et al. 2002). due to their increased size, fecundity, and reproductive potential and the connectivity they provide among local populations, migratory bull trout have been viewed as key to population persistence (rieman & mcintyre 1995; dunham & rieman 1999). downstream mortality factors, such as high temperatures, have been suggested as possible causes for the decline of migratory bull trout warranting further investigation (nelson et al. 2002). because bull trout can travel hundreds of kilometers during migration, the problem of matching observa- tions of ﬁsh locations to temperatures in the ﬁeld becomes especially difﬁcult. a potential solution is offered by miniature thermographs that can be directly attached to or implanted in the ﬁsh (rikardsen et al. 2007). these so-called ‘‘archival’’ tags can collect continuous information on thermal habitat use by individual ﬁsh with high temporal resolution (e.g., seconds to hours), which is important for species, such as bull trout, that inhabit thermally variable environ- ments and move extensively. in this study, we used archival tags attached to large migratory bull trout to better understand temperatures used by these ﬁsh over space and time. the archival tags were used in combination with radio tags and an array of digital thermographs deployed at ﬁxed loca- tions in streams used by the tagged ﬁsh. this allowed us to track the temperatures and locations of the ﬁsh and the ambient water temperatures throughout a large stream network used by migratory bull trout. our objectives were: (i) to describe temperatures experi- enced by migratory bull trout during upstream migra- tion from wintering areas through spawning and (ii) to compare ambient stream temperatures to temperatures of individual ﬁsh to look for evidence of ﬁsh using cold water refuges [i.e., habitats with cooler temperatures than adjacent stream areas (torgersen et al. 1999; ebersole et al. 2003)]. study area in 2001–2002 and 2004–2005 we studied bull trout that spawn and initially rear in the lostine river in thermal habitat of migratory bull trout northeastern oregon (fig. 1). the lostine river ﬂows into the wallowa river 42 km upstream from the mouth, and the wallowa river enters the grande ronde river, a tributary of the snake river, 132 km upstream from the mouth. the lostine and wallowa rivers originate from the north slopes of the wallowa mountains. elevations extend from about 2,700 m in the upper lostine river watershed to about 700 m at the mouth of the wallowa river. annual precipitation ranges from 1.3 m (water equivalent) primarily in the form of snow at higher elevations to 0.5 m at lower elevations (oregon department of environmental quality, unpublished data). peak ﬂows typically occur in late spring as the mountain snowpack melts. flows during 2002 and 2004 were similar to the long-term average, whereas in 2005 and particularly 2001, ﬂows were lower than average (table 1). flows in 2001 were the second lowest recorded. air temperatures in 2001 were also above normal, as they were in the other years of the study. in the wallowa mountains glaciation and faulting 11,000–500,000 years ago carved u-shaped valleys, cirque lakes, moraines, glacial

1976). as a result, there are few tributaries to the lostine river, and those are short with very high gradients. bull trout distribution is limited to the main stem lostine river up to a barrier falls near river kilometre (rkm) 82. spring chinook salmon, oncorhynchus_tshawytscha, and steelhead trout, oncorhynchus_mykiss, both listed as threatened under the endangered species act, also spawn and rear in the lostine river. about 75% of the lostine river watershed (18,010 ha) is public land, most of which is forested and managed by the us forest service (usfs) under wilderness designation (usfs 1997). the lower 18% of the watershed is privately owned and used primarily for agriculture. the bull trout population in the lostine river was selected for study because of uncertainty about its migratory distribution and potential temperature lim- itations in reaches affected by ﬂow diversion for irrigation. flows are extensively diverted from the lower lostine and upper wallowa rivers (fig. 1) from late spring through early fall when bull trout could be migrating through those reaches. the volume of water diverted is unknown. however, if all of the water rights granted for lostine and upper wallowa rivers were fully used, they would exceed the available ﬂow during lower ﬂow periods (s. hattan, oregon water resources department). a weir and upstream trap in the lostine river at rkm 44 are operated by the nez perce tribal ﬁsheries staff primarily to capture adult spring chinook salmon, but migratory bull trout are also intercepted. the trap provided an opportunity to capture, tag and recapture adults. methods field data collection in 2001 we radio- and archival-tagged 15 bull trout. four of these ﬁsh were captured at the lostine river trap on 11–27 june, and the remainder were captured by angling in the lostine river at rkm 69–81, 16–19 july. in 2004 we similarly tagged 24 98 and 2001 bull trout captured at the lostine river trap during mid-may through mid-july. three additional bull trout were captured by angling and tagged at rkm 66 and 81 during mid- to late august. the mean fork length (fl) of the ﬁsh tagged was 457 mm (range = 360–600 mm) 478 mm (range = in 363–575 mm) in 2004. a radio tag (advanced telemetry systems inc., isanti, mn, usa in 2001 and lotek inc., newmarket, ontario canada in 2004) was surgically implanted in the abdominal cavity of the ﬁsh. we used tag models 2-357 (6.8 g in air, 13 mm · 42 mm) and 10-28 (8 g, 46 mm · 12 mm) with 300-day and 450-day expected tag lives in 2001 and tag model ntc-6-2 (4.5 g, 30.1 mm · 9.1 mm) with a daily 12 h duty cycle (12 h on, 12 h off) and 588-day expected tag life in 2004. the tags and all surgical instruments were soaked in a 0.1% argentyne solution and rinsed in sterile 0.9% saline solution before each surgery. after the ﬁsh was anesthetized )1), an with tricaine methosulfonate (ms 222, 60 mgæl incision long enough to accommodate the cross- section of the radio tag was made anterior and dorsal to the pelvic girdle. a 152-mm, 16-gauge hypodermic needle inside a plastic sheath was used to internally puncture the abdominal cavity posterior and dorsal to the pelvic girdle and feed the tag antenna to the exterior of the ﬁsh. the radio tag was then inserted through the incision. the incision was closed with three to four sutures of non-absorbable polyamide. the incision and the exit hole for the antenna were then sealed with nexaband liquid topical adhesive (abbott laboratories, north chicago, il, usa). an archival temperature tag (ltd 1100, 5 g in air, 8 mm · 16 mm · 27 mm, lotek inc., newmarket, ontario, canada) was attached through the muscula- ture below the dorsal ﬁn using primarily nickel (peterson disk) pins (fig. 2). each pin was inserted through a round plastic backing plate (approximately 1 cm diameter, 1 mm thick) on the side of the ﬁsh opposite the archival tag. the end of the pin was then bent and twisted to form a t-shaped knot to secure the tag. the combined radio and archival tag weight was fig. 2. photograph of bull temperature tag below dorsal ﬁn and antenna of radio tag trailing behind pelvic ﬁn. trout with archival limited to no more than 3% of the ﬁsh’s body weight. most of the archival tags had a ﬁxed memory (32k or 64k) and variable recording interval for temperature )1. data with an initial maximum of 256 samplesæh each time the memory ﬁlled, the tag continued to record temperatures at twice the previous interval, rewriting over every other previous record. sampling intervals for the recovered tags were 15 min–1 h depending on the period between tagging and recapture. twelve of the archival tags used in 2004 had ﬁxed hourly recording intervals. accuracy reported by the manufacturer was ±0.3 °c. the mouth of stowaway or tidbit thermographs (onset computer inc., pocasset, ma, usa) programmed with hourly recording intervals were placed in well-mixed zones at six locations in the lostine river, ﬁve locations in the wallowa river downstream of the lostine river, and two locations in the grande ronde river to measure ambient water temperatures in the suspected range of the distribution of the tagged ﬁsh (fig. 1). accuracy reported by the manufacturer was ±0.2 °c. to ensure accurate measurements, thermo- graph and archival temperature readings were cali- brated against a national institute of standards and technology thermometer prior to and after deployment (dunham et al. 2005). locations of the tagged ﬁsh in the lostine and upper wallowa rivers were primarily tracked by vehicle and on foot using a yagi or h antenna and a lotek model srx 400 receiver. in the wallowa river below the conﬂuence of the minam river (rkm 16) and in the grande ronde river, the tagged ﬁsh were tracked from a plane. tracking generally occurred once per week from may to november, when the ﬁsh were likely migrating, and about once per month from december to april, when bull trout remain in their overwintering areas and move little (swanberg 1997). locations were determined using global positioning system (gps) coordinates where the tag signal strength was the highest, transferred to topographic maps using terrain navigator software (maptech inc., arnesbury, ma usa), and moved to the closest stream channel position adjacent to the gps coordi- nates. the error of the tracking locations was assumed to vary in relation to the distance from radio tag and in the case of aerial tracking, the speed of the plane. the mean error of aerial tracking in a related telemetry study was 1.7 km (n = 15, range = 0.2–3.1 km) from known tag locations (s. starcevich, odfw, unpub- lished data), and the error of tracking locations determined from vehicles and particularly on foot in or near the stream would likely be considerably less (e.g., £50 m, watry & scarnecchia 2008). tagged ﬁsh needed to be recaptured to recover data from the archival tags. tagged ﬁsh were recaptured in 2002 and 2004 by angling, dipnetting them in pools thermal habitat of migratory bull trout blocked off with seines, or herding them into small- mesh gillnets. in 2005 ﬁsh were recaptured at the trap on their upstream migration. data analysis seasonal distribution and movement to describe seasonal distribution and movements of radio-tagged individuals, we plotted the locations of each ﬁsh determined through telemetry over time. locations of ﬁsh and some landmarks were referenced by rkm beginning at the mouth of the wallowa river and continuing upstream into the lostine river (rkm 0 = mouth of wallowa river, rkm 42 = mouth of lostine river, rkm >42 = lostine river). temperature and upstream migration for recaptured archival-tagged ﬁsh, we summarized temperatures using the 7-day average daily maximum (7dadm) as the temperature metric. it was calculated as the running average of the daily maximum temper- atures during 7 consecutive days. thus, for each date there was an average daily maximum temperature for the week in which it occurred. this metric also provides a basis for comparison with federal and state of oregon water quality criteria, which are similarly expressed. the annual maximum 7dadm (i.e., warmest week of the year) is used in water quality criteria to reﬂect both the acute and chronic effects of the maximum temperatures ﬁsh are exposed to (usepa 2003). use of cold water refuges to compare ambient water temperatures to those of archival-tagged ﬁsh and to test for evidence of use of cold water refuges, we plotted mean daily ﬁsh temperature as recorded by the archival tags versus mean daily ambient water temperature based on the nearest thermographs on the dates when the ﬁsh were located with telemetry. use of cold water refuges would be evidenced where the temperatures of the archival-tagged ﬁsh were lower than ambient temper- atures. for this analysis, we reported daily means rather than daily maxima or ﬁner temporal measure- ments (e.g., hourly) to indicate potentially longer, )1) of likely more continuous use (i.e., multiple hæd greater biological signiﬁcance rather than brief excur- sions of less effect. temperatures from 12:00 to 24:00 were used for calculating the means since this includes the period when maximum daily temperatures occur, particularly during summer, when ﬁsh would be most likely to seek locations with cooler temperatures. the mean ambient temperatures on those same dates and times were estimated based on linear interpolation between temperatures recorded at the nearest upstream and downstream thermographs and the location of the 99 howell et al. ﬁsh relative to those thermographs. for comparison, we also analyzed the data using hourly values during the same 12-h daily period rather than daily means, but the results were similar and not reported here. temperature and spawning since we were generally unable to directly observe the tagged ﬁsh on redds, we used the highest upstream location within the known spawning area and spawn- ing period in the lostine river (usfs and oregon department of fish and wildlife (odfw), unpub- lished spawning survey data) during the week prior to consistent downstream movement to estimate the location and time of spawning. these criteria are similar to those used by swanberg (1997). we assumed most bull trout migrated downstream shortly after spawning (oliver 1979; watry & scarnecchia 2008). thus, although we were not able conclusively associate most of the tagged ﬁsh with a speciﬁc redd, all of the suspected spawning of tagged ﬁsh that we reported occurred in areas and at times that other bull trout spawning and redds in the lostine river have been documented. results recapture of tagged ﬁsh and duration of data three ﬁsh that were tagged in 2001 were recaptured during the spawning period the following year. in 2004 four ﬁsh tagged at the trap in the spring were recaptured upstream in late august that same year. archival tags were recovered in 2005 from three ﬁsh tagged the previous year, including two ﬁsh that had also been recaptured the preceding august. in sum- mary, we recovered temperature data spanning 12– 14 months from ﬁve ﬁsh, two to three months during late spring and summer from two ﬁsh, and four months during late summer through fall from one ﬁsh whose archival tag failed prematurely. temperature and upstream migration tagged bull trout overwintered from the grande ronde river near the mouth of the wallowa river (rkm 0) upstream to near the mouth of the lostine river (rkm 38–42; fig. 1). they did not begin moving upstream until may. however, the timing of migration and temperatures associated with migration during may and june were quite variable. in 2002 the tagged ﬁsh overwintering in the grande ronde river moved into the lower wallowa river by mid-may following an increase in its 7dadm from 11 °c to 12 °c. it continued to move upstream through june when its maximum 7dadm for that month reached 13 °c on 27 june. this contrasted with two other 100 tagged ﬁsh that remained at their wintering locations in the wallowa river (rkm 23 and 41) during april through june that same year despite 7dadm temper- ature increases from 12 °c to 14 °c prior to initially moving upstream. in 2005 two tagged ﬁsh overwin- tered in the wallowa river near the mouth of the lostine river and experienced similar temperatures in april (monthly maximum 7dadm of 12 °c); one migrated past the weir on 22 may following temper- ature declines to 9–10 °c, whereas the other did not pass the weir until 17 june when temperatures were 11–12 °c. although the timing of initial migration of these two ﬁsh in relation to temperature differed, for each individual the time of capture and tagging at the weir in 2004 and recapture at the weir in 2005 were similar in both years (17 may 2004 and 22 may 2005; 23 june 2004 and 17 june 2005). tagged ﬁsh were widely distributed in the wallowa and lostine rivers during late june through july (rkm 23–rkm 76). ambient 7dadm temperatures in those reaches peaked in late july through mid-august at 18– 25 °c in areas used only by migratory ﬁsh (i.e., thermographs at rkm 18.5–54) and at 14–18 °c upstream of that point in habitat used for spawning and juvenile rearing (table 2). annual maximum 7dadm temperatures (16–18 °c) of tagged ﬁsh were similar in 2001 and 2002 (fig. 3); however, there were differences between years in the locations and the table 2. annual maximum 7-day average daily maximum (dadm) temper- ature (°c) and corresponding dates from thermographs

likely spawned (rkm 61–65), whereas similar peak temperatures for those same ﬁsh the following year occurred in the lower lostine river during mid-july as they ascended the river. in 2004 tagged ﬁsh were distributed from the lower to upper lostine river when peak ﬁsh temperatures of 16 °c occurred during mid-late july. in 2005 a tagged ﬁsh was recaptured at the trap on 31 may and was passed below the trap after remaining just upstream of the weir for several days. it remained between rkm 38 downstream of the mouth of the lostine river and the trap (rkm 44) until it reentered the trap on 27 august. although its archival tag began to malfunction during the previous winter, thermographs in close proximity to the ﬁsh’s locations below the trap indicated that ﬁsh encountered a maximum 7dadm of 21 °c and 16 days when it was 20–21 °c. this was not an anomaly since odfw snorkelling crews observed 12 bull trout >300 mm (17% of the total trap count in 2005) in the lostine river below the trap during august 2005 (odfw, unpublished data). however, we do not know whether this behaviour was inﬂu- enced by the presence of the weir. thermal habitat of migratory bull trout all tagged ﬁsh entered the lostine river by july. based on the timing of tagged and untagged bull trout at the trap during 1998–2005 (nez perce tribe, unpublished data), it appears that most of the migra- tory adults avoided higher temperatures below the trap. during the study, temperatures at the trap did not exceed 16 °c until mid-july. by that time 98% of the ﬁsh captured have entered the trap. this pattern was also generally reﬂected by our tagged ﬁsh. however, in 2005 when the large bull trout were observed by snorkelers below the trap in august, only one other bull trout besides the archival-tagged ﬁsh entered the trap after 25 july. this indicates trap counts do not account for some adults in the population downstream that are exposed to high temperatures in the lower lostine river and potentially the wallowa river for extended periods during the summer. use of cold water refuges the temperatures of bull trout with recovered archival tags and the ambient stream temperatures when the tagged ﬁsh were located were nearly identical (fig. 4). there were no samples where the archival tag indicated the ﬁsh was in water >1 °c cooler than the estimated ambient temperature, even at higher tem- peratures. these results indicate the tagged ﬁsh were not using local cold water refuges. temperature and spawning most of the tagged ﬁsh likely spawned from the last week of august through september.

°c cooler. discussion temperature and upstream migration we found little evidence for a common thermal cue for upstream migration of adult bull trout. increasing temperature appeared to be generally associated with the initiation of upstream migration, but the response 102 of individual ﬁsh to temperature increases was quite variable. these observations paralleled those of swanberg (1997), who found the temperature at which bull trout in the blackfoot river initiated migration ranged from 12 to 20 °c. a potential inﬂuence on the relationship between upstream movement and temper- ature is the proximity of the ﬁsh to the spawning area. as suggested by the tagged ﬁsh that overwintered in the grande ronde river, bull trout that are farther downstream from spawning locations may initiate migration at lower temperatures and in response to smaller increases in temperature. however, we did not have enough observations of individual ﬁsh in this study to evaluate this hypothesis. as they continued upstream, many of the tagged ﬁsh moved more rapidly through the lower lostine river as temperatures increased in july and then moved little as they approached spawning areas despite increasing tem- peratures in the upper river. the maximum 7dadm temperatures of tagged ﬁsh in migratory habitat downstream of reaches used for trout habitat spawning and early rearing were up to 5 °c higher than the 16 °c upper limit considered tolerable for bull trout (poole et al. 2001) and the current water quality criterion for migratory bull [oregon administrative rules (oar) 340-041-0028 and 340- 041-0151; usepa 2003]. maximum 7dadm ambi- ent water temperatures in those reaches over the course of the study were 18–25 °c. tagged ﬁsh moving up into habitat used for juvenile rearing encountered 7dadm temperatures 4–6 °c warmer than the 12 °c maximum for optimal juvenile growth and summer habitat use where food is limited (poole et al. 2001) and the water quality criterion for rearing habitat (oar 340-041-0028 and 340-041-0151; usepa 2003). exposure of migratory bull to similar high temperatures has been noted in other systems (swanberg 1997; baxter 2002). in laboratory studies chronic exposure to the temperatures at which bull trout were observed in the lostine and wallowa rivers resulted in reduced growth of juvenile bull trout and at >20 °c led to substantial mortality (selong et al. 2001). exposure over a natural diel cycle and effects on older life stages have not been examined for bull trout (e.g., meeuwig et al. 2004), although older juveniles were less tolerant of constant higher tem- peratures than younger juveniles (selong et al. 2001). in spite of potential physiological consequences, bull trout in the lostine and wallowa rivers sometimes used relatively warm waters even when cooler water was available upstream. trout use of cold water refuges where ﬁsh encounter higher temperatures, such as those observed in the lower lostine and wallowa rivers in this study, they may use localized habitats with colder water to avoid thermal stress (e.g., swanberg 1997). these areas may form from subsur- face groundwater sources, particularly in alluvial ﬂoodplains (poole & berman 2001), and from inputs from tributaries. use of temperature refuges by other species of salmonids has been documented in river systems in the region (li et al. 1994; torgersen et al. 1999) and in the lostine river and other tributaries of the grande ronde river (ebersole et al. 2003). cold water patches can provide important thermal refuges, especially for ﬁshes at the southern end of their range, inhabiting marginally suitable habitat, and undertaking extensive migrations (sauter et al. 2001). these characteristics can all be ascribed to some degree to the lostine river bull trout population. because of their stronger linkage with cold water than other species, bull trout could be expected to have a stronger association with cold water patches. however, ﬁsh in this study showed no evidence of using thermal refuges. temperature comparisons in some cases, thermal habitat of migratory bull trout indicated the temperature of the ﬁsh from the archival tag was higher than the ambient temperature. these differences may have resulted from ﬁsh moving at a rapid rate from warmer downstream reaches, but we observed too few instances where the differences were ‡1 °c to draw ﬁrm conclusions. lack of availability of cold water patches could explain why ﬁsh and ambient temperatures tracked so closely. however, forward looking infrared videogra- phy (watershed sciences 2000) and ﬁeld measure- ments (ebersole et al. 2003) have identiﬁed patches of cold water along the lostine river, where most of the bull trout were when water temperatures peaked. no cold water patches were found along the wallowa river downstream from the lostine river (watershed sciences 2000). it is possible that some bull trout actually use these refuges but that we did not sample enough individuals to detect this behaviour, especially if it was not common. due to concerns over impacting large numbers of individuals of a federally listed species and ﬁnancial and logistical constraints associated with telemetry and archival tags, we were able to study only a limited number of individuals. thus, the range of behaviours we were able to observe might have been similarly constrained. alternatively, other factors may have limited use of cold water refuges by our sample, such as shallow water depth or lack of connectivity to the river main stem. within the context of a larger landscape, thermal refuges in a stream system may occur higher in the watershed where overall ambient temperatures are cooler. use of habitat by bull trout across the species’ range is strongly tied to cold headwaters (dunham et al. 2003). more localized coldwater refuges downstream, while potentially important to some individuals, may be less important to populations than are cold headwaters. temperature and spawning previous temperature data and the extent of diverted ﬂows in the lower lostine and wallowa rivers suggested bull trout could experience elevated tem- peratures in those reaches during summer. however, we did not expect that adults would also spawn at relatively high temperatures. tagged ﬁsh spawned in 2001–2002 at temperatures 4–5 °c higher than previ- ously reported spawning temperatures for bull trout (£9 °c) (pratt 1992; mccullough et al. 2001; watry & scarnecchia 2008), which is also the criterion in state and federal water quality standards (oar, 340-041- 0028 and 340-041-0151; usepa 2003). maximum 7dadm temperatures for all tagged ﬁsh from the beginning of the spawning period of the population in late august until the spawning of tagged ﬁsh was completed exceeded this threshold by 2–8 °c, as did 103 howell et al. the upper end of maximum ambient 7dadm temperatures throughout the spawning area during the spawning period. except for the spawning distribution, ambient temperatures did not consistently reach £9 °c until october, when spawning by tagged ﬁsh was completed. the spawning temperatures were not generally inﬂuenced by local habitat alterations since most of the spawning area is not affected by ﬂow diversions and drains designated wilderness. except for areas along the road that parallels the upper river, which is used primarily for camping and trail access, local human inﬂuences on spawning temperatures are largely limited to the lower quarter of the spawning distribution. for example, diversion return water elevates temperatures at the lower end of the spawning and rearing habitat in the lostine river by about 2 °c (watershed sciences 2000). if high temperatures were affecting selection of spawning timing or location, one might expect later spawning or concentration of spawning at the upper end of the distribution to be favored since tempera- tures would be cooler. however, spawning in the lostine river appears to occur at the same time or earlier than in many other systems in northeastern oregon and southeastern washington (usfs, odfw, unpublished data). concentration of redds in the upper spawning reaches of the lostine river provides some evidence of selective use of colder locations. redd count data for 1999–2005 (usfws, unpublished data) indicates that 89% of redds were found in the upper 20% of the spawning distribution, although some middle reaches were not consistently surveyed. in contrast, more of the tagged ﬁsh in this study spawned lower where temperatures were warmer. clearly additional work is needed to resolve the importance of temperature versus other factors in the selection of spawning habitat by bull trout. conclusions and management implications trout the lostine river and other tributaries draining the wallowa mountains are among the coldest streams in the grande ronde subbasin (watershed sciences 2000). yet, adult bull in the lostine river experience temperatures above reported optimal max- ima, except in the uppermost reaches. in most of the habitat used for spawning and rearing, temperatures have likely not been substantially altered by ﬂow diversions or human-caused habitat changes. however, the highest water temperatures encountered by bull trout occur in downstream reaches used by migratory ﬁsh where potential increases in water temperatures from natural or historical levels resulting from ﬂow diversion and habitat alteration have been the greatest. some of the discrepancies between the temperatures observed in bull trout habitat in the lostine river, 104 especially in upper reaches where human-caused temperature changes have been minor, and those reported elsewhere may be related to latitude. the lostine river population is located in the southern portion of bull trout distribution. consequently, tem- peratures could be expected to be somewhat higher than for more northerly populations at similar eleva- tions (rieman et al. 2007). in considering management of water temperatures, bull trout populations in systems like the lostine river that have natural or climatically inﬂuenced temperature regimes near the upper end of suitability for bull trout likely have less margin for human-induced increases in temperature, especially in light of potential further temperature increases result- ing from climate changes (rieman et al. 2007). trout the population effects of the relatively warm water temperatures experienced by bull from the lostine river remain unknown. some adults survived these conditions as evidenced by the tagged ﬁsh that survived through recapture. on the other hand, redd counts and trap counts, although not complete, suggest the lostine river population is relatively small. for example, redd counts during 1999–2005 averaged 37 redds (range = 22–70) (usfws, unpublished data), and trap counts during 2001–2005 averaged 62 adults (range = 14–94) (nez perce tribe, unpublished data). it is possible that constraints imposed by warm water temperatures contribute to the small overall size of this population, but other factors cannot be ruled out. besides the potential direct physiological effects of high temperatures on spawning, incubation, growth and survival, elevated temperatures in lower reaches resulting from anthropogenic effects, such as ﬂow diversion and reduction of riparian vegetation, could inﬂuence the health of the population in several other ways. for example, migratory habitat could be con- tracted in space and time, thereby reducing habitat availability. migratory bull trout are noted for their predatory behaviour (pratt 1992). reduced habitat suitability for prey species, including other salmonid juveniles, could reduce the prey base in those reaches. the migratory habitat of bull trout in the lower lostine and wallowa rivers was designated to be managed as core cold-water habitat because of its use for juvenile salmon and steelhead rearing and bull trout foraging (oar 340-041-0028 and 340-041-0151). in this study we observed a diversity of behaviours with respect to temperature even though we were able to tag and recapture limited numbers of ﬁsh large enough to accommodate larger radio tags and archival temperature tags. because of the limitations due to tag weight, our sample did not include smaller migratory bull trout (ca. <300 mm) that can exhibit different patterns of habitat use compared to larger adults (muhlfeld & marotz 2005; monnot et al. 2008). since subadults in the untagged size range spend up to several years in habitat downstream of natal areas prior to returning as adults to spawn (rieman & mcintyre 1993), they could experience prolonged exposure to high temperatures they seasonally move upstream like adults to habitat with cooler temperatures or ﬁnd cold water refuges. in those reaches unless although temperature thresholds for some ﬁsh species like bull trout are frequently used for regula- tory purposes to meet thermal habitat requirements, the variable nature of thermal habitat use by individ- uals and natural environmental variability suggest much greater complexity. understanding the extent of that variability, the factors inﬂuencing it, and develop- ing approaches for protecting water quality and imperiled ﬁshes, such as bull trout, represents an important challenge for improved management of both (poole et al. 2004). whereas cold water appears to be a consistent predictor of habitat use by bull trout across the species range, the relationship is not precise (dunham et al. 2003). understanding factors that inﬂuence the variable use of coldwater habitats by bull the species. our understanding of thermal habitat use will no doubt be improved by technological advances, such as availability of smaller, longer duration radio tags and archival temperature tags, but also by formulation and explicit tests of more complex hypotheses about thermal habitat selection and factors that may interact with temperature to inﬂuence individual bull trout and ultimately populations (mccullough et al. 2009). remains an important question for trout acknowledgements support for this research was provided by the bonneville power administration and the usfs. john brunzell, ian
