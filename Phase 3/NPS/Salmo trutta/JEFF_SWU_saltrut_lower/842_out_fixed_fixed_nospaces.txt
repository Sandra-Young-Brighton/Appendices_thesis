1970s collections were museum records from approx- imately 1971–1976 taken from auburn university museum (aum) records. the historical collections from the 1970s selected for comparison were routine samples taken to document ﬁsh diversity; all samples were made may - september. collecting methodology from wasler (1996) was identical to our collections. historical collections from the 1970s were made using 3 m · 1.5 m seines. if comparison of collection data was biased, the presumably more efﬁcient 1995 and 2005 ⁄ 06 collections would be expected to produce greater number of species (perhaps resulting in greater assemblage similarity) than earlier collections made without electroﬁshing gear. the morista and jaccard’s similarity indices were computed using ecological methodology software (kenney & krebs 2000) and interpreted as outlined in matthews et al. (1988) and spellerberg (1991). values <0.40 are considered to have low similarity, while measurements >0.80 are considered highly similar (matthews et al. 1988). two indices were used because while the morista index is considered the most conservative index, it is abundance-based and could be affected by population ﬂuctuations (phillips & johnston 2004). the jaccard index is based on presence-absence data. together the two indices provided a robust analysis of assemblage change. the index of species turnover (1996), p = 1 ) t, where t is: follows wasler t = (c + e)/(s1 + s2); c and e are the number of species colonizations and extinctions between the number of species in sample periods s1 and s2. t is species turnover, and p is persistence. spearman’s rank correlations of ﬁsh species abundances were computed using spss (ver. 11, chicago, il). we used correspondence analysis, ca as an exploratory tool to visualize the changes in ﬁsh assemblage composition over the three time periods (1970s, 1995, 2005–06). data from all three streams were pooled and to reduce the inﬂuence of less common species, correspondence analysis only included species comprising ‡5.0% of the assemblage at any given stream for at least one of the sampling fish assemblage shifts and species declines intervals. we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nmds) to determine the magnitude of temporal differences in ﬁsh community structure for each stream from morisita values (table 1) using the software provided in sas (2003). the morisita index was chosen as this index is sensitive to both changes in species occurrence and abundance. land cover changes in land use were assessed for each watershed. we compared the land cover in wasler in the 2001 1996) with more recent national land cover dataset http:// www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k_nlcd.asp). for the comparison, the nlcd classiﬁcation was matched to the earlier classiﬁcation, watershed boundaries were obtained from the national hydrography dataset (nhd, http:// nhd.usgs.gov/), and land cover was summarized within each watershed. (nlcd, daily ﬂow data from 1 january 1949 to 31 december 2006 was obtained from the united states geological survey (usgs site number 02342500) on uchee creek near fort mitchell, alabama. these data include all available data for this watershed. this site was not within the stream reaches we sampled, but is within the little uchee creek watershed. we assumed these data were indicative of temporal patterns of ﬂow within all three study watersheds. data were summed for each month and year and time-series analysis was conducted following the procedures outlined by maceina & pereira (2007) to determine if long- term changes in ﬂow occurred in lower uchee creek. in addition, we obtained monthly rainfall data from 1 january 1949 (the ﬁrst year data were available) through 31 december 2006, from eight and 10 weather monitoring stations in lee and russell counties, alabama (southeast regional climate center; (http:// www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/stationlocator) that encompassed the uchee creek watershed. among stations, these data were averaged for each month and year and similar to ﬂow data, time-series analysis were conducted to determine if rainfall variation was associated with any changes in long-term ﬂow at uchee creek. table 1. morista similarity between historic samples and 2005 ⁄ 06 samples for chattahoochee river tributaries in alabama. numbers in bold indicate

to rainfall data, above) and 2006 (http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts) to assess the change in human habitation in these watersheds. results a total of 42 sites were sampled to assess stream scale ﬁsh assemblage persistence, and yielded 44 species (fig. 1). eight of these contemporary sites had histor- ical data from collections made in both 1970s and 1995 and were therefore available for comparative analysis (appendices). all sites were used to for the assessment of individual species declines. examination of current collections relative to historical ones revealed patterns of compositional change and species decline (appendix 1). four of the eight sites in this analysis shifted from cyprinid species as the most abundant ﬁsh in the assemblage to a darter, percina nigrofasciata (black- banded darter) (halawakee sites 8 and 14, little uchee site2, wacoochee site 12). this shift occurred during both time intervals. the sites that did not shift to a blackbanded darter dominated assemblage shifted to lepomis auritus (redbreast sunﬁsh, a centrarchid; wacoochee site 2 and 13) or cyprinella venuta (blacktail shiner, a cyprinid; wacoochee site 16) (one site, little uchee site 1, was dominated by blackbanded darter throughout the study period). both morista and jaccard’s similarity indices revealed very low similarity among ﬁsh assemblages at several sites and time intervals (tables 1 and 2). using the morista index, more sites (four) show low similarity for the longest time interval comparison, realative to the shorter time interval (two), which was expected. the longer the time interval between two samples, the higher the probability of dissimilarity. little uchee site 2 and wacoochee site 13 had ﬁsh assemblage shifts from 1995 to 2005 ⁄ 06, as evidenced by low morista similarity values for those compari- table 2. jaccard similarity between historic samples and 2005 ⁄ 06 samples for chattahoochee river tributaries in alabama. number in bold

0.37 sons. high scores for little uchee site 1 and wacoochee site 16 suggested ﬁsh assemblages that have not changed at these sites over time. the results for similarity using jaccard’s index, which does not take abundance into account, were less conservative than those using the morista index, with seven of eight sites having low similarity scores for the 1970s and 2005 ⁄ 06 comparison. four of these changed during the 1995 to 2005 ⁄ 06 time period, and two changed during the 1970s to 1995 time period. the jaccard index is useful for determining ecological gradients, but can be negatively biased with undersampling of rare species, while the morisita index, which matches abundances of species may be used to account for compositional changes in assemblages and is less affected by sample size (spellerberg 1991; chao et al. 2005). in addition to assemblage shifts, there was a decrease in overall ﬁsh abundance at several sites (uchee site 1, halawakee sites 8 and 14, wacoochee sites 2 and 13; appendix 1). this decrease in the number of ﬁshes is most likely due to habitat degradation. the decrease in numbers of individuals could have biased the similarity indices, in particular the jaccard index. the analysis of assemblage correlation provided more evidence of ﬁsh assemblage shifts (table 3). very few of the assemblage samples were correlated (three of 24) over time. those that were correlated were all from the 1995–2005 time period, and relatively low similarity values (moristia and jaccard) suggested that the assemblage had already shifted composition. most sites showed high species turnover (0 = no species turnover, 1 = complete turnover), with the highest turnover observed between samples taken from 1970s to 2005, as would be expected. table 3. values for ﬁsh

multidimensional scaling was used to visualize temporal shifts in assemblage similarity within each stream (fig. 2). points for halawakee creek (h), are farther apart and show the most assemblage change over time, while little uchee creek (l) sites are closer together and therefore remained similar over time. sites in wacoochee creek (w) showed relatively moderate change over time. a plot of ca ordination of ﬁsh assemblage data for all eight study sites (little uchee, wacoochee and halawakee) illustrates a shift through time away from species found in the 1970s (fig. 3). the rate of change in the major (‡5.0) taxa composition between 1970s and 1995, and 1995 and 2005–06 was similar based on the similar distances apart for correspondence analysis for each year ﬁsh were sampled (fig. 3). in support of this, 61% and 39% of dimension 1 and dimension 2, respectively, of the total chi-square was accounted for by variation in relative abundances of species. greater chi-square percentage differences would imply a greater shift in species abundances occurred between a particular time period. cyprinids dominated the fauna in these three streams in 1970s (including c. venusta), but declined after this time and were replaced as dominant species by percina nigrofasci- ata, lepomis auritus and cyprinella venusta. by 2005 ⁄ 06, cyprinids (excluding c. venusta) made up less than 3% of the dominant taxa. species had several individual distributional declines relative to historic collections. the most alarming declines were species that are now absent at both the site (known from historical collection) and including stream scale (42 sites in three streams), fig. 2. multidimensional scaling representation of morisita simi- larity among three streams (h = halawakee,

historical comparisons) for one or more study streams, including lythrurus atracpiculus, micropterus cateractae, and notropis hypsilepis. four species have been lost from the site scale but are

decrease in hardwoods. the percentage of the hala- wakee watershed in pine-hardwood decreased over time from 56% to 38%, while the amount of land devoted to pine monoculture increased from 6% to 24%. the percentage of land used as agriculture (28% to 28%) and urban (9% to 10%) remained unchanged. this was not true for the little uchee watershed; however, urbanization in the watershed almost dou-

assemblage change and species declines at both the site and stream scale. at all but one site examined, the dominant ﬁsh species changed during the approxi- mately 35-year time span of our investigation. in most of these cases the dominant ﬁsh species in current collections was blackbanded darter. additionally, many species suffered declines in the number of sites where they were currently found relative to historical distribution records. in particular, once widespread and abundant cyprinids were replaced with cosmopol- itan species (scott 2006) such as blackbanded darter, redbreast sunﬁsh and blacktail shiner, resulting in homogenization of these streams. the changes in these ﬁsh assemblages would be missed without historical comparisons. furthermore, if an index of biotic integrity had been inappropriately used for assessment of these sites, many might be ranked as relatively pristine, as percina nigrofasciata, a darter, would be used in this metric as an indicator of high quality streams (karr 1981; schleiger 2000). this suggests that caution should be used in species classiﬁcation for this index. all metrics employed in this study indicated that ﬁsh assemblage structure changed in the study streams, and species replacements were examined to assess the impact of these faunal shifts (scott & helfman 2001). the jaccard index found less similar- ity among ﬁsh assemblages over time than the moristia index, and could have been inﬂuenced by low numbers of individuals at some sites. this ﬁnding suggests that the samples included some rare species not shared by paired samples. the moristia index was less sensitive to potential undersampling of rare species. the dominant species by 2005 ⁄ 06 in all samples used for analysis are considered cosmopolitan and tolerant species. when combined with data on which species declined, it is evident that cosmopolitan species replaced endemic cyprinids. this is similar to the ﬁndings of scott & helfman (2001), who found the highland endemic species are rapidly declining and being replaced with cosmopolitan species in the southern appalachians. alternatively, these results could have been due to sampling artifacts associated with gear or with the use of similarity indices. by using similar gear and multiple analyses, we believe such artifacts are minimized, however. also, the trends in ﬁsh assem- blage change are repeated among sites. these trends could also represent species or population ﬂuctuations. other studies have found low ﬁsh assemblage simi- larity with even very short time intervals, and these results are considered temporary shifts (matthews 1990; meador & matthews 1992). our comparisons allowed association of a timeline to changes in the ﬁsh assemblages. at least four sites had ﬁsh assemblages that changed from 1995 to 2005 ⁄ 06, but ﬁsh assemblage structure had already changed by 1995. these changes roughly correlate to changes in land use and a reduction in water ﬂow during these time periods, but this is speculative. changes in ﬁsh faunal composition as a probable result of land use changes have been well documented, however (sutherland et al. 2002; walters et al. 2003; maz˘eika et al. 2006). the results of the mds suggest that assemblage changes through time occurred at different rates in the three streams. fish assemblages in little uchee creek group together, suggesting little change during the study period, while other streams had ﬁsh assemblage shifts during different time periods. in sediment reasons for species loss and assemblage change are difﬁcult to deﬁne, in part because multiple causes are usually responsible. changes in land-use are often cited as catalysts of alteration of stream channel morphology, changes load and the cascading biotic consequences of these factors (suth- erland et al. 2002). our brief examination of land use change over just a 35 year period showed an increase in pine monoculture in halawakee and wacoochee creeks. although the accelerated water run off attrib- uted to pine monoculture systems is well known, the multiple effects of shifting from hardwood forest cover to pine monoculture are not often mentioned (swank & miner 1968). increased water run off may lead to channel incision, which in turn lowers the water table in the surrounding riparian zone. pine monoculture systems also reduce the amount of water available to streams over time by reducing water holding capacity of the soil, and increasing evapotranspiration (swank & miner 1968; bens et al. 2007). also, we documented a decline in stream ﬂow and an increase fish assemblage shifts and species declines in the human population in the area of the study streams. in combination, these factors can lead to an elevation in stream temperature, a factor which may favor one group of ﬁshes over another. further evidence for habitat degradation at some of the study streams is the decrease in numbers of individuals seen at several sites, including two in halawakee creek and two in wacoochee creek. protection and restoration of stream habitat should stabilize the declines in native ﬁsh distributions that were demonstrated in this study. although it is not possible to prevent changes in land use, measures can be taken to reduce the impact of these practices on watersheds. regulation of water withdrawal may help reduce the impact of stream level reduction. working with land owners to implement riparian corridor establishment would lessen the impact of rapid water run off and reduce sediment inputs. such measures will lessen the homogenization of the aquatic fauna that is occurring at a rapid pace in these watersheds. acknowledgements a state wildlife grant from alabama department of conser- vation and natural
