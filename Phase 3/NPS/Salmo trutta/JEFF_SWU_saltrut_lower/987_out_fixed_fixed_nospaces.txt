however, the relative inﬂuence of the different scale-related factor groups is poorly known. we evaluated the importance of catchment-scale and site-scale environmental variables, as well as the spatial context of the sampling sites, in shaping stream ﬁsh assemblages in an agriculture-dominated landscape in hungary. beside the variables describing spatial context (principal coordinates of a truncated distance matrix among sites), altogether 60 environmental variables were used to predict variability using a variance-partitioning procedure in redundancy analysis. presence–absence- and relative abundance-based data were examined at two assemblage levels (entire assemblage and native assemblage) at 54 stream sites. incorporation of spatial variables increased largely the total explained variability in case of relative abundance, but not for presence–absence data. of the environmentally explained variance, catchment-scale variables (e.g., land cover types, patch density) were relatively more inﬂuential for the native assemblage-level analyses, than for analyses at the entire assemblage level, where site-scale variables (e.g., altitude, depth) proved to be more inﬂuential. in addition, pure catchment- and pure site-scale variables have the primary role in determining ﬁsh assemblage patterns, whereas the inﬂuence of shared variance and that of site-scale riparian variables proved to be less important. our ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of incorporating the spatial context of the sampling sites in predicting ﬁsh assemblage patterns and the effects of channelisation (dikes) in shaping assemblage–environment relationships in this human-inﬂuenced landscape. key words: land cover; dispersal; nonnative species; variance partitioning; dikes introduction one of the central interests in community ecology is to understand and explain spatial and temporal variability of communities. in riverine systems, numerous studies illustrate that environmental factors act at multiple spatial scales in a hierarchical manner to shape the organisation of the biota (e.g., richards et al. 1996; wang et al. 1997, 2001, 2003; harding et al. 1998; brazner et al. 2005; compin & ce´re´ghino 2007; stephenson & morin 2009). there is a general consensus that beside site-scale factors (e.g., instream habitat characteristics), catchment-scale (e.g., land use) properties and regional context govern patterns in aquatic assemblages (wiens 2002; allan 2004; wang et al. 2006). for example, changes in land use characteristics owing to deforestation and ⁄ or urbani- sation negatively affect the diversity of stream ﬁsh assemblages (wang et al. 1997; sutherland et al. 2002). in addition, the alteration of catchment land cover may result in delayed and long-term effects, so land use history also has a signiﬁcant impact on stream biodiversity (harding et al. 1998; van sickle et al. 2004; brown et al. 2009). however, most studies that correspondence: t. er}os, balaton limnological research institute of the hungarian academy of sciences, klebelsberg k. u. 3., h-8237 tihany, hungary. e-mail: ertib@tres.blki.hu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00490.x 251 sa´ly et al. examined the importance of catchment versus site- scale variables focused primarily on the effect of land cover types or considered only a few, but doubtlessly inﬂuential instream physical or chemical variables as potential drivers of assemblage structure (but see marsh-matthews & matthews 2000; wang et al. 2003; esselman & allan 2010). turbidity, water chemistry) the hierarchical structure and functioning of stream ecosystems suggest that processes that are expressed at the catchment scale (e.g., geomorphology, land cover) deﬁne lower-level, instream properties (e.g., ﬂow regime, (frissell et al. 1986; tonn 1990; poff et al. 1997; wiens 2002; allan 2004; allan & castillo 2007). as a result, environ- mental factors affecting species distributions are spa- tially structured, which can induce spatial dependence in community-level properties (dray et al. 2006). furthermore, simple ecological processes (e.g., dis- persal, spawning migration, reproduction) can lead to strong distance–decay relationships, where the similar- ity of assemblages decreases with increasing spatial distance of the sampling sites (legendre 1993; dray et al. 2006). therefore, the importance of environmen- tal factors driving species distributions are overesti- mated in statistical models when spatial variation is not taken into account (legendre & legendre 1998). although the importance of partitioning the spatial and environmental components of variation has been increasingly recognised (e.g., borcard et al. 1992; me´ot et al. 1998; borcard & legendre 2002; dray et al. 2006), relatively few studies incorporated spatial context (i.e., the spatial conﬁguration of the sites) in ﬁsh assemblage studies. existing studies suggest that variability attributable to pure spatial variables (e.g., geocoordinates of the sites, among-site distances) depends on spatial extent, geographical location and assemblage type (magalha˜es et al. 2002; beisner et al. 2006; mesquita et al. 2006; stewart-koster et al. 2007; er}os et al. 2009; heino et al. 2010a; pires et al. 2010). nevertheless, it is largely unknown how spatial variables increase the variance explained, compared with a diverse array of environmental factors. one would predict that the relative importance of spatial variables in structuring assemblages may increase over environmental ones with the extension of the studied area because of historical effects (i.e., differences in species pool) and dispersal limitation (cottenie 2005; mykra¨ et al. 2007). such effects are evident at large spatial extents, for example in among ecoregion comparisons (mccormick et al. 2000; van sickle & hughes 2000). however, spatial variables may also have relevance at smaller spatial extents, especially in fragmented and human-altered land- scapes where differences in land use history make prediction with simple environmental variables difﬁ- cult. in fact, both spatial and catchment-scale variables can have increasing importance over site-scale factors in human-altered areas (allan et al. 1997; esselman & allan 2010), and as such should be more intensively incorporated in ﬁsh assemblage studies. in this study, we examined the relative inﬂuence of spatial context, catchment-scale, and site-scale vari- ables (fig. 1) in determining stream ﬁsh assemblage patterns in the drainage of lake balaton, hungary. this basin contains a wide range of land use types and as a result differentially altered assemblages within a relatively small spatial extent (see methods). we were especially interested in answering the following ques- tions: (i) how does the incorporation of spatial variables (spatial conﬁguration of the sampling sites) affect the amount of variance explained when com- pared to that explained by environmental variables alone? (ii) what is the role of different spatial extent– related (i.e., catchment vs. site scale) environmental factors in explaining ﬁsh assemblage structure? (iii) how does assemblage-level resolution inﬂuence the robustness of these questions, we examined ﬁsh assemblages at two levels of data resolution: (i) presence–absence and (ii) relative abundance data (i.e., numerical percentage composition of ﬁshes). both data types were analysed at two assemblage levels: (i) entire assemblage, where both native and nonnative species were included in the analyses and (ii) native assemblage, where nonnative species were excluded from the analyses. the relative the analyses? to answer 252 fig. 1. the variable groups examined in this study. for details on speciﬁc variables in each group, see material and methods and table 1. effects of environmental and spatial factors on stream ﬁsh assemblages role of nonnative species was quantiﬁed to examine their contribution to ﬁsh assemblage patterns in this human-inﬂuenced, agriculture-dominated landscape (er}os 2007). material and methods study area lake balaton is one of the largest shallow lakes in central europe (area: 594 km2, mean depth: 3.2 m) with a catchment area of 5775 km2. the dominant land use type in the catchment is agricultural (mainly arable lands, vineyards and orchards to a smaller extent), comprising approximately 40% of the total area. deciduous forests (28%), pastures and grasslands (12%) are also characteristic land cover types. the proportion of freshwater habitats (lentic and lotic water bodies and wetlands) comprises 14%, while that of the inhabited area is 6%. most of the settlements are small villages, and there are only ﬁve towns with a population exceeding ten thousand people. the water- courses of the catchment area are usually fairly modiﬁed with dikes along the banks. ponds used for aquaculture and recreational ﬁshing can be found in many streams. some of these ponds maintain dense populations of nonnative species, which regularly escape into the streams. fish sampling we sampled ﬁsh assemblages in all major wadable the streams in the catchment. within a stream, sampling sites were randomly selected from potential candidate sites. we selected the candidate sites after preliminary reconnaissance to ensure representative- ness based on land use and instream habitat charac- teristics, and accessibility constraints. our team surveyed a total of 60 sites altogether in the low- ﬂowing summer–autumn period of 2007. we omitted six sites later from data analysis because of the low number of ﬁsh captured (<10 individuals) and evi- dence of unrepresentative sampling because of heavy vegetation coverage. at each of the remaining 54 sites (fig. 2), we sampled a 150-m-long reach by wading, single-pass electroﬁshing using a backpack electro- ﬁshing pdc, 50–100 hz, 350–650 v, max. 10 kw). this amount of sampling effort is generally consistent with the sug- gestion of the european committee for standardiza- tion (cen 2003) and was found to yield representative samples of ﬁsh assemblages in this study area for between-site comparisons (sa´ly et al. 2009). fish were identiﬁed to species level, counted and released back to the stream. ig200 ⁄ 2b, gear (hans-grassl environmental variables we used altogether 60 variables to characterise the environmental features of the sampling sites and for modelling ﬁsh assemblage patterns. we grouped environmental variables into two groups as follows: catchment-scale variables that integrated conditions in the landscape upstream of the sampling site and site- scale variables that characterised local abiotic condi- tions of the sampling site (fig. 1; table 1). following fig. 2. map of the drainage of lake bal- aton, hungary, showing the location of the 54 sampling sites (empty circles). 253 sa´ly et al. the completion of ﬁsh sampling, we recorded the values of site-scale variables in the ﬁeld. we deter- mined the catchment-scale variables in a geographical information system environment using the arcview gis version 3.1 software (environmental systems research institute, inc., redlands, ca, usa). altitude was measured in the ﬁeld with a garmin 76cx gps unit. at each sampling site, we placed 6–15 transects perpendicular to the main axis of the stream with the actual number of transects depending on habitat diversity. we measured wet width of the channel with a tape measure, depth and current velocity with a meter stick and a water velocity meter (fp101 global flow probe, global water instrumentation inc., gold river, ca, usa), respectively, at 3–6 equally spaced points along each transect. we recorded aquatic vegetation type (see table 1), substrate type and presence–absence of detritus (macrophytic and ⁄ or ﬁne woody debris) at every transect point, as well as the occurrence of undercut banks, and the type of bank vegetation at both ends of the transect. we also counted the number of logs (diameter >10 cm and length >1 m) along the sampling reach. we calculated the mean values of the aforementioned environmental variables and the per cent occurrence of the categorical variables (i.e., substrate type, aquatic vegetation type, detritus, undercut bank, bank vegetation) to characte- rise site-scale habitat features. a standardised principal component sampling sites. first, we we measured water temperature, ph, conductivity, total dissolved solids (tds), oxygen content and saturation with an oakton waterproof pcd 650 (oakton instruments, vernon hills, il, usa) portable handheld meter before ﬁsh sampling. the concentrations of nitrogenous forms (nitrite, nitrate and ammonium) and phosphate were measured ana- lytically in the laboratory. we also used three additional variables to characterise habitat variability within the expressed hydromorphological variability as the ﬁrst-axis scores of analysis (pc1 = 86.7%) using the following variables in the ordination: (i) the coefﬁcient of variation (cv) of wet stream width, (ii) the cv of water depth and (iii) the cv of current velocity (see beisner et al. 2006 for a similar procedure). second, we calculated substrate diversity as the shannon diversity of the proportion of the different substrate types (er}os & grossman 2005). third, we calculated aquatic vegetation as the shan- non diversity of the different macrophyte types. per cent hard substrate was simply expressed as the sum of the sand, gravel, stone, rock and concrete proportions, just as instream vegetation cover, which totalled the proportions of all aquatic vegetation types. one and the same person estimated the proportion (%) of the site-scale riparian land cover the proportion of 254 types (see table 1) visually within a 200-m-wide strip along both sides of the sampling reach. riparian land cover diversity was calculated as the shannon diver- sity of the proportion of the riparian land cover types. we also visually estimated the type of the bank vegetation (% woody and % herbaceous vegetation) both within a 1- and a 10-m-wide strip along both sides of the study section. the catchment-scale (i.e., land cover) variables were expressed as their percentage proportion in the catchment area above a given sampling site. we determined the boundary of the catchment area above each sampling site using a digital elevation model developed from shuttle radar topography mission data (http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm). we obtained digital land cover information from the corine land cover 2000 database (clc2000; european environmental agency, http://www.eea.europa.eu) with some modiﬁcations made by merging certain land cover classes (see table 1 for the three-digit identifying numbers of the original land cover classes). further, we quantiﬁed landscape complexity with the shannon diversity of the proportions of the land cover variables and with patch density (i.e., the number of the original clc2000 patches per catchment area of a given sampling site). we measured the number and area of settlements within the catchment area and the distance of the sampling reaches from (i) lake balaton, the the nearest settlements and (iii) (ii) nearest pond upstream on a 1:80,000 scale map using the national gis database of hungary (institute of geodesy, cartography and remote sensing, hungary). spatial variables institute) we used the principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (pcnm) (borcard & legendre 2002) to quantify the spatial arrangement of the sampling sites. for this purpose, we ﬁrst determined the pairwise curvilinear stream line distances of the sampling sites along the stream network using arcview 3.1 software (environmental systems research at 1:80,000 resolution. the created between-site distance matrix was then modiﬁed by replacing the largest distance values, i.e., the ones that exceeded a threshold, with a value that is four times greater than this threshold value (borcard & legendre 2002; borcard et al. 2004). to ﬁnd an appropriate threshold value, we constructed the minimum spanning tree of the between-site distance matrix, and then chose the longest edge as the threshold (see dray et al. 2006). finally, we ran a principal coordinate analysis based on this modiﬁed distance matrix and retained the principal coordinates with positive eigenvalues as spatial descriptor variables in the procedure of varia- effects of environmental and spatial factors on stream ﬁsh assemblages table 1. median, minimum and maximum values of the environmental variables. environmental variables median min. max. discarded i ii iii iv explanatory variable landscape-level variables catchment area above the sampling site (km2) land cover descriptors (clc2000)  % inhabited area (111, 112) % artiﬁcial surface (121, 122, 124, 131, 132, 133, 141, 142) % agricultural area (211, 212, 221, 222, 231, 241, 242, 243) % forest (311, 312, 313) % nonforest vegetation (321, 324, 333) % wetlands (411, 412) % ponds (512) land cover diversity patch density (number of patch per km2) total area of settlements above the sampling site (km2) total number of settlements above the sampling site straight-line distance from the closest settlement (km) stream distance from the closest upstream settlement (km) stream distance from the upstream pond (km) stream distance from lake balaton (km) site-level variables altitude (m) riparian land cover descriptors 73.6 6.9 1520.0 1.3 0.9 50.1 18.3 10.8 1.3 0.0 1.126 0.9 3.3 6 0.3 0.2 14.2 21.5 0.0 0.0 13.3 2.3 0.0 0.0 0. 0.337 0.6 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 53.4 15.8 92.1 58.8 56.2 7.5 6.0 1.449 2.0 39.4 66 2.4 20.3 18.4 109.3 128.0 107.0 221.0 % forest % meadow % arable land % settlement % wetlands 17.5 30.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 riparian land cover diversity 0.612 bank vegetation types within a 1 m strip along both sides of the study reach % woody vegetation % herbaceous vegetation 9.0 91.0 bank vegetation types within a 10 m strip along both sides of the study reach % woody vegetation % herbaceous vegetation wet width (m) depth (cm) current velocity (cmæs hydromorphological variability detritus (%) substrate types )1) % silt (diameter 0–0.02 mm) % silty sand (diameter 0.02–0.2 mm) % sand (diameter 0.2–2 mm) % gravel (diameter 2–60 mm) % stone (diameter 60–300 mm) % rock (diameter >300 mm) % concrete substrate diversity % hard substrate aquatic vegetation types % reed % filament algae % emers macrophyte % submerse macrophyte % other plant aquatic vegetation diversity % instream vegetation cover % undercut bank number of logs water temperature (°c) ph conductivity (lsæcm)1) total dissolved solids (mgæl)1) dissolved oxygen (mgæl)1) oxygen saturation (%) 5.0 95.0 2.8 32.0 6.6 0.2 0.0 1.9 30.0 0.0 9.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.915 40.9 19.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.8 0.534 56.0 0.0 0 19.0 7.81 788.20 329.50 6.30 71.35 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.9 4.0 0.0 )6.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 13.0 6.08 161.3 56.6 0.3 3.7 100.0 97.0 100.0 100.0 90.0 1.353 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 10.8 89.5 40.8 4.6 100.0 100.0 100.0 89.0 76.9 83.3 41.7 72.8 1.756 100.0 95.0 15.0 18.6 77.8 90.0 1.191 98.0 30.8 13 27.6 8.81 1282.0 665.0 12.8 137.0 no no no yes no no no no yes no yes yes yes no no no no no no yes no no no yes yes no yes no no no no no no yes no no no no no no yes no no no no no yes yes no no no no no yes no yes yes no yes no no no no yes no yes no no no no yes yes yes no yes no no no yes no no no no yes yes no no no no no no no no no yes no no no no no no no no no no no yes no no no yes no yes no yes no no no no yes no yes no no no no no yes yes no yes no no no yes no no no no yes yes no no no no no no no no no yes no no no no no no no no no no no yes no no no yes no yes yes yes no yes no yes no no yes no no no no yes yes yes no no no no no no no no no no no yes yes no yes no no yes no no no no no no no yes no yes no no no no no no no yes no yes no yes yes yes no yes no yes no no yes no no no no yes yes yes no no no no no no no no no no no yes yes no yes no no yes no no no no no no no yes no yes no no no no no no no yes no yes no 255 sa´ly et al. table 1.

advantage of pcnm method is that it is able to model both the ﬁne- and broad-scale spatial structures of the data by creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set (see borcard & legendre 2002; borcard et al. 2004; dray et al. 2006). statistical analyses before data analyses, we transformed the environ- mental variables to improve their normality. variables expressing proportions were arcsine-square root trans- formed. ph was exp(x) ⁄ 100, and conductivity and tds variables were transformed, whereas the remaining variables measured on ratio scale were natural logarithmic transformed. exp(x ⁄ 1000) prior to the main analyses, we discarded highly collinear variables from each set of the environmental variables (i.e., catchment and site scale) to reduce the redundant information of the highly correlated descrip- tor variables (blanchet et al. 2008). collinearity was detected by computing the variance inﬂation factor (vif) and pairwise pearson correlation coefﬁcients of the variables (quinn & keough 2002). we excluded variables with a vif > 10 (quinn & keough 2002) and also selected one of those variables that showed a correlation value above 0.7 in the pairwise correlation analyses. in the latter case, we retained those variables that showed lower overall mean correlation values with the other environmental variables. we also excluded species that occurred only in three or fewer sites (i.e., a maximum of 5% of all the sites) from the analyses (godinho et al. 2000; wang et al. 2003). we conducted the analyses using both presence– absence and relative abundance data, and both at the entire and the native assemblage levels (i.e., four analyses) using a hierarchical variance-partitioning design in partial redundancy analysis (prda). we used rda because preliminary detrended correspon- dence analysis (dca) indicated the somewhat linear response of the ﬁsh assemblages to the underlying 256 gradient (i.e., the gradient length of the ﬁrst dca axis was below 2 sd units, see legendre & legendre 1998). before starting the analyses, we hellinger transformed our ﬁsh abundance data, which converted the data into relative abundances (legendre & galla- gher 2001). variance partitioning made it possible to evaluate the unique and shared contributions of different groups of explanatory variables to the explained variability of the assemblage matrix (bor- card et al. 1992). we adjusted the explained fractions of the variance to both the number of the explanatory variables and the sample size to obtain an adjusted redundancy statistics (r2 a) that provides an unbiased estimate of the explained fraction of variance (peres- neto et al. 2006). we selected the relevant spatial and environmental variables from the set of spatial vari- ables and from the two sets of environmental variables using a forward selection procedure (blanchet et al. 2008). signiﬁcance level of the forward selection was set to 0.1 to avoid skipping any potentially important variables (godinho et al. 2000; wang et al. 2003; mykra¨ et al. 2007). prior to forward selection, we performed a global test (i.e., a redundancy analysis including all the variables in a variable group) to make sure that the variable group has an effect on the response variables. we excluded the variable group from the forward selection and from the further partitioning procedure if the test showed insigniﬁcant effect (blanchet et al. 2008). after variable selection, we determined the relative inﬂuence of the two main variable groups (i.e., spatial and environmental). this variance partitioning yielded four fractions of the total variance as follows: the fraction of variance explained by pure spatial variables [spa]; the shared fraction of variance explained jointly by both spatial and environmental variables [spa + env]; the fraction of variance explained by pure environmental variables (i.e., the catchment- and site- scale environmental variables together) [env]; and the unexplained or residual fraction of variance [resid]. the fractions of variance were expressed as per cent of the total variability. we tested the signiﬁcance of the fractions [spa] and [env] with permutation tests effects of environmental and spatial factors on stream ﬁsh assemblages performing 4999 permutations at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 (legendre & legendre 1998). next, we partitioned the fraction of variance explained by pure environmental variables [env], using the group of spatial explanatory variables (i.e., principal coordinates selected in the forward selection procedure) as covariables. this yielded the following four fractions of variance: the fraction of variance explained by pure catchment-scale environmental variables [catchm]; the fraction of variance explained by pure site-scale environmental variables [site]; and the shared fraction of variance explained jointly by catchment- and site-scale environmental variables [catchm + site]. these fractions of variance were expressed as per cent of the variance fraction [env]. we tested the signiﬁcance of the fractions [catchm] and [site] with permutation tests performing 4999 permutations at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 (legendre & legendre 1998). we used the r statistical environment to conduct the analyses (r development core team 2009). forward selection procedure was conducted with the r package ‘packfor’ (dray et al. 2009) and variance partitioning is implemented in the r package ‘vegan’ as it (oksanen et al. 2009). similar evaluation methods have been applied recently on ﬁsh assemblages in other biogeographical regions and spatial scales (er}os et al. 2009; esselman & allan 2010; pires et al. 2010). results we captured a total of 11667 specimens of 34 ﬁsh species in the 54 sampling sites (table 2). eleven species occurred in three or fewer sites. of the 23 species retained for the study, 18 were native and ﬁve were nonnative. the most frequent native species were rutilus rutilus, rhodeus sericeus, squalius cephalus and gobio gobio, which occurred at 23–29 sampling sites. carassius gibelio, lepomis gibbosus and pseu- dorasbora parva were the most widespread nonnative species, occurring at 3–20 sampling sites. we discarded altogether 15 environmental variables from the two groups of environmental descriptors during the preliminary data analyses (table 1). of the remaining 45 environmental variables, 15 and 14 descriptors were selected by the forward selection procedure in the entire and native assemblage-level analyses, respectively, for the presence–absence-based data sets. these selected variables were the same in both cases, with the only exception that one variable (distance from the upstream pond) was selected only for the entire assemblage. similarly, the selected 18 environmental variables were actually the same in relative abundance-based data analyses for the entire and the native assemblage level (table 1). therefore, the exclusion of nonnative ﬁsh species did not table 2. the ﬁsh species, frequency of occurrence (fro%) and number of individuals

(2004) who found difﬁculties in projecting clear changes to 259 sa´ly et al. alternative scenarios of human land use in the willamete river basin, or, usa. the most inﬂuential environmental variables (i.e., the ones selected in each of the four analyses) were generally similar to those found in other studies on ﬁsh–environment relationships (e.g., godinho et al. 2000; wang et al. 2003; ferreira et al. 2007; hoeing- haus et al. 2007), but subtle differences could also be observed. for example, we found altitude and depth to be key variables, and these factors are also among the most common ones in ﬁsh assemblage studies (e.g., matthews 1998; godinho et al. 2000; wang et al. for example, 2003). however, we did not ﬁnd, substratum type among the most important eight variables, whereas relatively seldom measured vari- ables such as patch density were found to be especially important. a possible explanation of this result is that no strong gradient can be found in the substrate composition of these highland–lowland type streams with the predominance of silty sand, sand and a smaller proportion of gravel (in the majority of streams). overall, these results highlight the impor- tance of incorporating both spatial and environmental variables in modelling the distribution patterns of ﬁsh assemblages at a regional extent and of incorporating other, less commonly used catchment- and site-scale variables in the analyses, because these have the potential the amount of explained variance. to increase, albeit not substantially, relative inﬂuential role of catchment- and site-scale environmental variables the relative inﬂuence of site-scale variables was greater than that of catchment-scale ones in case of both presence–absence and abundance data in the entire assemblage-level analyses, whereas the shared variance remained relatively low, at least compared with a similar study in a relatively little impacted landscape in north-eastern mesoamerica (see essel- man & allan 2010). these ﬁndings may be attribut- able to the remarkable prevalence of channelisation, dikes and channel incision in the studied lowland streams (and partly also to the presence of nonnative species). as a result of channelisation, streams became shorter, and ﬂow regime changes dramatically (see e.g., shields et al. 2010). dikes and incisions separate streams from their ﬂood plains, and hence, connection between the riparian zones and streams breaks off (allan & castillo 2007). as watershed-level variables inﬂuence the stream channel and the biota mostly indirectly through the riparian environment (wiens 2002; allan 2004; wang et al. 2006), effects of landscape variables may be weakened as well in stream sections with dikes and channel incision. this argument is in concordance with our ﬁndings about 260 the relatively low inﬂuence of site-scale riparian variables in determining ﬁsh assemblage patterns. inﬂuences nevertheless, catchment-scale variables can still have prevalence in affecting ﬁsh assemblage patterns both directly (e.g., the proportion of forested area, which, e.g., sedimentation and water regime) and indirectly (e.g., the amount of particulate organic matter, which inﬂuences the amount of macroinvertebrates, the primary food resource of ﬁsh). the importance of some catchment-scale variables (i.e., catchment area above the sampling site, per cent artiﬁcial surface and land cover diversity) may indicate the importance of such accumulated, watershed-level effects. inﬂuence of the nonnative species exclusion of nonnative species from the analyses inﬂuenced the presence–absence-based analyses more than those based on relative assemblage data. for example, the spatial- and environment-related vari- abilities were virtually the same in the entire and native assemblage-level analyses in case of the relative abundance data, but spatial-related variability disap- peared from the presence–absence data when the native assemblage was analysed exclusively. this result indicates some spatial constraints in the occur- rence of nonnative species. in fact, southern inﬂows contain relatively more ﬁsh ponds than other sub- basins in the catchment, and these ponds are potential sources of nonnative species. the exclusion of nonnative species from the analyses did not increase or decrease substantially the variance explained by pure environmental factors (fig. 3), but the relative role of the different factor groups changed (fig. 4). catchment-scale variables were relatively more inﬂuential for the native assem- blage-level analyses than for analyses at the entire assemblage level, where site-scale variables proved to be more inﬂuential. it seems logical that these higher- scale factors less affect the distribution of nonnative species, which still have a relatively young history in the speciﬁc role of the balaton basin. however, individual really be disentangled in this pattern owing to strong collinearity among many of the measured variables (see e.g., table 3), which is rather inherent in ecolog- ical data sets. although experimental approaches may be unfeasible at such spatial scales, the planned long- reveal and term monitoring may help to further understand the role of factors in the organisation of ﬁsh assemblages in this drainage basin. in conclusion, our results indicate that stream ﬁsh assemblages are inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by spatial-, catchment- and site-scale variables even at this moderate spatial extent (5000 km2) of the drainage individual environmental variables cannot effects of environmental and spatial factors on stream ﬁsh assemblages of lake balaton, hungary. spatial variables and the associated dispersal mechanisms were important in shaping abundance-based ﬁsh assemblage patterns. however, our results also call attention to the sensi- tivity of the analyses to data coding (presence–absence vs. relative abundance) and assemblage-level consid- erations (inclusion or exclusion of nonnatives), which should not be forgotten when making generalisations about ﬁsh–environment relationships. our results also suggest the relatively good separation of pure catchment-scale and pure site-scale effects on ﬁsh assemblages, which has not been emphasised in other studies. the low contribution of the shared fraction and the relatively little effect of site-scale riparian variables may indicate the importance of channelisa- tion (i.e., dikes) in shaping ﬁsh assemblage–environ- ment relationships in this human-inﬂuenced landscape. acknowledgements the authors thank m. pre´sing and his colleagues for the chemical analysis of the water samples; a´ .i. gyo¨rgy, a´ . va´ry, cs. bereczki and a. speczia´r for their help in
