e-mail: claralord@mnhn.fr accepted for publication august 30, 2009 introduction freshwaters of the paciﬁc region are inhabited by gobiidae (sicydiinae) species with a speciﬁc life cycle adapted to the insular environment. this life cycle is called amphidromous (keith 2003; mcdowall 2007). the adults grow, feed and reproduce in rivers. after hatching the larvae, drift downstream towards the sea where they spend a variable amount of time, ranging from 3 to 6 months (hoareau 2005; hoareau et al. 2007). after this marine stage, the postlarvae come back to rivers; they recruit in estuaries and undergo a metamorphosis (keith et al. 2008) while migrating upstream to settle in the higher reaches. at certain times of the year, the biomass of ﬁsh larvae recruiting and migrating upstream is so great that they become a major source of food for local human populations in the indo-paciﬁc area (re´union island, vanuatu, french polynesia, philippines, etc.) (manacop 1953; hoareau et al. 2007). in vanuatu, adult gobiidae are also targeted as a food resource (d. kalfatak, personal communication). however, harvesting this food resource is highly unsustainable, on account of the complexity of the species’ life cycle, which is not yet fully understood. the adult phase, the larval down- stream migration and the recruiting phase are only 26 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00386.x larval duration for three sicyopterus species estimated by otolith analysis starting to be understood in detail (keith et al. 2006). however, the processes undergone during the marine larval phase remain poorly known (bell et al. 1995; radtke & kinzie 1996; shen et al. 1998; radtke et al. 2001; hoareau et al. 2007), as no larva has ever been caught at sea. it is nevertheless one of the most important phases to elucidate in order to understand how these species disperse and are distributed, and to implement conservation measures to protect them (lord & keith 2008). the sicyopterus genus, with 25 species, is the most diverse genus among sicydiine gobies (keith et al. 2004). three species are represented in new caledo- nia and vanuatu. sicyopterus lagocephalus (pallas, 1767) is a cosmopolitan species; its distribution area extends from the comoros islands in the indian ocean to the austral islands in the paciﬁc ocean (watson et al. 2000; keith et al. 2005a). sicyopterus sarasini weber & de beaufort, 1915 is endemic to new caledonia and more speciﬁcally to the south of the main island, occurring only in rivers with peridotite rich substrate. finally, sicyopterus beds, a nickel aiensis keith et al., 2004 is endemic to vanuatu. both endemic species are sympatric with s. lagocephalus. it is quite surprising to ﬁnd two endemic species in two rather close regions (the distance between new caledonia and vanuatu is only about 230 km) while the third, closely related species, has the capacity to colonise islands over 18,000 km (keith et al. 2005a). one of the hypotheses put forward to explain this discrepancy is that the duration of the marine larval stage could be one of the factors controlling these species’ distribution by favouring or limiting their dispersion; this larval duration may be one of the factors explaining endemism. fish otoliths are calciﬁed structures found in the inner ear of the ﬁsh; they show a series of growth structures that are formed on a regular basis. they are acellular and metabolically inert structures (campana 1999) and do not undergo any mineral resorption (mugiya & ushimura 1989). they have therefore long been used for age estimation in many ﬁsh species, and more speciﬁcally for sicydiinae species (radtke et al. 1988, 2001; shen & tzeng 2002, 2008; hoareau 2005; hoareau et al. 2007; yamasaki et al. 2007). it has been shown in several studies on sicydiinae species that a check mark is deposited at metamorphosis on the otolith (shen & tzeng 2002; yamasaki et al. 2007; keith et al. 2008). for sicyopterus species, the check mark is deposited during the recruitment when postlarvae enter the estuaries and start colonising the higher reaches of the stream, while undergoing an extensive metamorphosis (keith et al. 2008). the recruiting postlarvae have a pelagic feeding mode with a terminal mouth, and shift to a benthic herbivorous feeding mode, scraping diatoms and algae off the rocky substrate. this shift in feeding mode induces a signif- icant cranium reorganisation and the setting of specia- lised teeth, monopolising all the calcium available in the ﬁsh’s body, to the detriment of its growth (shen & tzeng 2002). the check mark in the otolith corresponds to very tight daily increments, reﬂecting the decrease of the ﬁsh’s growth during metamorphosis. the purpose of the present study is to estimate the duration of the marine larval phase of those three sicyopterus species by counting the daily increments on the otoliths, from the core to the metamorphosis check mark. the larval duration is compared between the three species. the correlation of the growth of the otoliths to the larval growth is explored to understand the processes undergone in the marine environment during the larval phase, in order to characterise the life cycle of these species and identify the differences between endemic and cosmopolitan species. materials and methods study sites vanuatu is a melanesian archipelago comprising 83 islands (fig. 1). the various surveys were carried out in november 2006 on santo island, and in november 2007 on maewo island. santo is the largest and also the oldest island (22 ma) of the archipelago. it is a volcanic island although it also shows calcareous areas of coralline origin. rivers on santo are short and fast ﬂowing, a perfect biotope for sicydiinae gobies (keith 2003). maewo island is younger (5 ma), with a high mountainous chain in its centre. this island receives the highest amount of rain in vanuatu, favouring the presence of large waterfalls, which are favourable habitats to sicydiinae gobies, and especially sicyopte- rus species (keith et al. 2006). the endemic species of vanuatu, s. aiensis, was found in the two catchment areas surveyed on santo, penaorou and peavot, respectively, on the western and on the eastern sides of the cumberland cape. it has also been found in maewo (naravorovo river) (fig. 1). this past new caledonia is located 230 km southwest from vanuatu (keith et al. in press). new caledonia, unlike vanuatu, is of continental origin and sepa- rated from gondwana 65 ma. it has preserved many vestiges of through a high level of endemism (audley-charles et al. 1981; grandcolas et al. 2008). new caledonia is composed of differ- ent geological units; either metamorphic units (in the northeastern part of the island) or peridotite nappes, in the southern part of the island, from which nickel is endangered new caledonian endemic species, s. sarasini, is exclusively found in rivers on peridotite beds that are in the southern part of the island (lord & keith 2008). we have extracted. the 27 lord et al. fig. 1. sampling sites in vanuatu. sampled several catchment areas on the main island of new caledonia, both in the southern and in the northern parts (fig. 2). the cosmopolitan species, s. lagocephalus is found in all the rivers of the two countries, living in sympatry with the endemics. specimen collection a total of 94 sicyopterus postlarvae and 33 adults were caught in santo and maewo (vanuatu) over the two sampling periods (table 1). postlarvae were caught in the river mouth while recruiting; adults were caught at an altitude of about 100 m. a total of 57 adult specimens was sampled in new caledonia (table 2). all specimens were sampled by electro-ﬁshing (portable dekka 3000 electric device, dekka ltd, germany), using a large hand net. they were ﬁxed and preserved in 95% alcohol. fish measurements the standard length (sl) and total length (tl) of each postlarvae and adult ﬁsh were measured to the nearest tenth of millimetre (mm) using a digital mitutoyo dial calliper. otolith extraction and preparation we extracted the sagitta, the largest otolith of the three pairs present in the inner ear. due to the small size of the ﬁsh studied, especially the postlarvae, ﬁsh were dissected under a binocular magniﬁer (olympus vmz, 40x, olympus vmz ltd, paris). the otoliths were placed in distilled water just after the extraction in order to clean them. we eliminated remaining tissues 28 from the macula and the vestibule with ﬁne tweezers (secor et al. 1992). once cleaned, the otoliths were dried and kept in eppendorff tubes. right otoliths of adult ﬁsh were embedded in araldite 2020 resin. they were then mounted on a slide and ground to the core on each side of the otolith to obtain a thin section. the otolith was then polished with 0.3 lm alumina paste. otoliths extracted from postlarvae were observed whole. ageing the right otolith of adults was observed after polish- ing; right otoliths of postlarvae were observed in their integrity in a droplet of parafﬁn oil on a glass slide. all observations were made under an olympus bx51 light microscope equipped with an olympus dp20 digital camera (200x magniﬁcation). each otolith was photographed. many studies have validated that the accretionary growth of the otolith occurs on a daily basis (pannela 1971), including for sicydiinae gobies, and for s. lagocephalus (radtke et al. 1988; bell et al. 1995; hoareau 2005; yamasaki et al. 2007). in the present study, it will therefore be assumed that the increments for the three sicyopterus species are formed on a daily basis. the ﬁrst increment is assumed to occur at hatching (bell et al. 1995). the formation of the ﬁrst daily increments generally starts when the larva’s mouth opens and it is able to ingest exogenous food (panﬁli et al. 2002). the number of daily increments on each otolith was independently counted by two readers, from the nucleus to the metamorphosis check (for adults and juveniles) and from the nucleus to the edge of the otolith for postlarvae showing an unﬁnished metamorphosis (fig. 3). larval duration for three sicyopterus species estimated by otolith analysis fig. 2. sampling sites in new caledonia. 1: barendeu river, ultramaﬁc substrate;

peavot and maewo, w = 1042, p-value = 9e-3). postlarvae caught in maewo in november 2007 are signiﬁcantly longer than postlarvae caught in santo in november 2006. estimation of the age at recruitment for all otoliths, the daily increments were counted from the nucleus to the metamorphosis check mark, or to the otolith’s border when the check mark was not yet deposited (newly recruited postlarvae) (fig. 3). results are summarised in table 3. the data are normal and the homoscedasticity is respected. there was no signiﬁcant difference detected by an anova, in the age at recruitment for s. lagocephalus postlarvae according to the sampling location. for these post-larval samples, there is also no relationship between the age and the length at recruitment (pearson’s correlation test: t = )0.1228, p-value = 0.90), showing a difference in the growth pattern rather than in the time spent at sea.

as we only had ﬁve postlarvae, the results are therefore not entirely reliable for these ﬁve individuals. )13). we we compared the mean durations of the marine larval stage between the cosmopolitan species and the two endemic species. we performed a kruskal–wallis test. the species factor had a signiﬁcant effect on the marine phase (v2 = 56.2854, the duration of p-value < 10 then performed post hoc wilcoxon–mann–whitney tests in order to compare between species. there is a signiﬁcant difference between the s. lagocephalus specimens caught in vanuatu and the s. aiensis (w = 33, p-value = 0.0025); there is a signiﬁcant difference between the s. lagocephalus caught in vanuatu and the s. sarasini specimens (w = 18, p-value = 5.84 )05); e there is a signiﬁcant difference between the s. lagocephalus specimens caught in new caledonia (w = 0, p-va- and there is a signiﬁcant difference lue = 2.06e-10); between the s. lagocephalus specimens caught in specimens specimens the s. aiensis new caledonia and the s. sarasini specimens (w = 0, p-value = 4.34e-09). but we have found no signiﬁcant difference between the mean marine larval durations of s. aiensis and s. sarasini, the two endemic species (w = 519.5, p-value = 0.079). we also performed the same wilcoxon–mann– whitney to test the data for the pooled s. lagocephalus data against that for the two endemic species, and we again found a signiﬁcant difference between the larval s. aiensis duration (w = 2849.5, p-value = 1.048e-13) as well as with s. sarasini (w = 4081, p-value < 2.2e-16). s. lagocephalus and of in other terms, the mean duration of the marine phase of s. lagocephalus, the cosmopolitan species, is signiﬁcantly longer than that of the two endemic species, whereas the latter show similar marine larval phase duration. table 3. mean age at recruitment for the three sicyopterus species sampled in vanuatu and new caledonia. mean age at recruitment (days) penaorou (vanuatu) peavot (vanuatu) maewo (vanuatu) new caledonia sicyopterus lagocephalus postlarvae adults sicyopterus aiensis postlarvae adults sicyopterus sarasini adults 139.5 ± 5.1 119.0 ± 21.6 133.8 ± 4.1 128.5 ± 4.4 132.2 ± 7.2 79.2 ± 4.6 96.8 ± 9.8 76.5 ± 3.9 31 lord et al. otolith growth the the length standard pearson’s correlation test showed that there is a relationship between the longest radius of the otolith of and postlarvae (t = 6.0201, p-value = 4e-08). it has been shown that the growth of the otolith reﬂects the metabolism of the ﬁsh and therefore its growth (pannela 1971; robinet et al. 2008). this leads us to the conclusion that the growth pattern of the otolith is the same for the individual. therefore, we also assumed that the otolith growth rate of adults from the nucleus to the check mark reﬂects the larval growth of the individual. figure 5 represents the individuals’ otolith growth rate as a function of age. the curve starts at hatching (nucleus) and ends at the metamorphosis check mark. we have measured the otolith growth rate for the 32 s. lagocephalus adults from new caledonia and vanuatu (fig. 5a), the 34 s. sarasini (fig. 5b) and the 24 s. aiensis (fig. 5c). for all three species, the same pattern occurs: the beginning of the larval life is high (s. lagocephalus: 5.71 ± 0.65 lmæday 6.76 ± 0.81 )1); it then lmæday decreases drastically during the ﬁrst 20 days spent at sea, and then it gradually decreases to about 1 to 2 lmæday )1; s. sarasini: 7.02 ± 0.6 lmæday )1 for all three species. the otolith growth at s. aiensis: )1; hatching date back-calculation lagocephalus for the s. lagocephalus and the s. aiensis postlar- vae, we have back-calculated the hatching date. sicyopterus in november mainly hatched in june and july, whereas s. aiensis postlarvae caught at the same period hatched in august. we were unable to back- calculate hatching dates for s. sarasini, as we had no newly recruiting larvae. postlarvae caught discussion length at recruitment sl = 26.53 ± 0.56 mm for the standard lengths observed for s. lagocephalus (sl = 26.17 ± 0.45 mm for recruiting postlarvae penaorou; peavot; sl = 27.38 ± 0.72 mm for maewo) are similar to the standard lengths observed by keith et al. (2006) in tahiti for the sicyopterus genus (sl = 23–25 mm), and their total length also does not differ much with hoareau’s (2005) measurements for s. lagocephalus from re´union island (tl = 29.96 ± 0.46 mm for penaorou; tl = 30.98 ± 0.33 mm for peavot; tl = 32.30 ± 0.51 mm for maewo; tl = 32.7 ± 1.1 mm for re´union island). however, although the data are 32 similar, we have found a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the length at recruitment of penaorou and peavot samples (santo island, novem- ber 2006) and maewo island samples (november 2007). the average standard length of several goby species at recruitment changes cyclically with the sampling date, as is the case for sicyopterus japonicus (shen & tzeng 2008). for gobiids of the genus sicydium, there is also a seasonal variability in the size at recruitment. this variation in the size at recruitment can be the result of a variation in the age at recruitment (variation in the time spent at sea before the ﬁsh ﬁnd freshwater) (bell et al. 1995) or can be due to a variation of the growth rate because of a variation in the conditions in the marine environ- ment (i.e., variation in food resources). however, in the present case, the absence of correlation between the age and the length at recruitment in our (a) (b) (c) )1) from the nucleus to the fig. 5. otolith growth rate (lmæday check mark as a function of age (days) for adults: (a) sicyopterus lagocephalus, (b) sicyopterus sarasini, (c) sicyopterus aiensis. larval duration for three sicyopterus species estimated by otolith analysis study implies a difference in the larvae’s growth patterns while at sea rather than a difference in the time spent at sea. age at recruitment the recruitment of sicyopterus postlarvae seems to be size and not age-dependent. indeed, for both s. lago- cephalus and s. aiensis, we found no correlation between the age at recruitment and the standard length of the postlarvae. shen & tzeng (2008) found the same results for sicyopterus japonicus. in our study, the estimation of the age at recruitment from post-larval and adult otoliths of s. lagocephalus did not differ signiﬁcantly. the recruiting period of the adults we caught is unknown; they might even not have recruited in november like the postlarvae but during a totally different period of the year. yet, we ﬁnd similar larval phase duration for adults and postlarvae. in re´union island, the age at recruitment of s. lagocephalus varies annually; the oldest being caught between january and march (average of 200 days), and the youngest between may and september (average of 150 days) (association re´u- nionaise de de´veloppement de l’aquaculture arda, personal communication). in the paciﬁc area, consid- ering that we have found an average of 130 days for both adults and postlarvae, there may not be such an annual variation in the age-at-recruitment. the mean larval duration is signiﬁcantly longer for the cosmopolitan species than for the two endemic ones: s. lagocephalus postlarvae and adults (caught either in vanuatu or new caledonia) had a mean marine larval duration of 131 ± 3.4 days whereas s. aiensis showed a marine larval life duration of 79.2 ± 4.6 days and s. sarasini of 76.5 ± 3.9 days. for the three species studied, the mean marine larval to that of many other duration is quite similar (table 4). for sicyopterus amphidromous gobies japonicus (tanaka, 1909), a species that ranges from taiwan to southern japan, the larval duration has been estimated to be 163.72 ± 12.79 days (shen & tzeng 2008). even though this species is endemic, the duration of the marine larval its distribution is probably controlled by the distribution of temperate temperatures (watanabe et al. 2006; iida et al. 2008). life is long, but they are all signiﬁcantly longer than the 30–50 days usually reported for reef ﬁsh (brothers et al. 1983; victor 1986b; wellington & victor 1989; wilson & mccormick 1999), and the 20–50 days typically reported for marine gobies (brothers et al. 1983; sponaugle & cowen 1994; shafer 1998). the longer marine larval duration for amphidromous species may be a developmental adaptation to their special and complex life cycle that requires them to complete the two migrations to and from marine environments. in fact, the long duration might be used to locate isolated freshwater settlement sites (radtke et al. 2001; murphy & cowan 2007) and colonise new islands. the difference observed in our study in the length of the duration of the marine phase between the two endemic and the cosmopolitan species could be one of the elements explaining these species’ distribution by favouring or limiting larval dispersion, and therefore partly explaining endemism. the shorter marine phase would suggest limited dispersion capacities for the endemic species, hence their restricted distribution range. the cosmopolitan species, having a longer marine phase, would be able to colonise distant geographical islands, spreading their geographic dis- tribution to all islands in the indo-paciﬁc area, colonising them gradually (keith et al. 2005a,b). in this study, we analysed the life history of two endemic species found in a rather restricted geograph- ical area (new caledonia and vanuatu are geograph- ically close), in which there are other species that are endemic to the whole area (keith et al. in press). this suggests that a shorter marine phase is not sufﬁcient to explain endemism. there are undoubtedly other factors of a biogeographical, physical, physiological, ecological and historical nature that weigh on such a distribution. for instance, s. sarasini is exclusively found in rivers on ultramaﬁc substrate in new caledonia, from which nickel is extracted (lord & keith 2008). these table 4. mean marine larval durations for other amphidromous species, both for endemic and for more widespread species. species locality stiphodon percopterygionus watson & chen, 1998 lentipes concolor (gill, 1860) cotylopus acutipinnis guichenot, 1863 stenogobius genivittatus (valenciennes, 1937) awaous guamensis (valenciennes, 1937) sicyopterus japonicus (tanaka, 1909) endemic to ryuku islands – taiwan endemic to hawaii endemic to the mascarene islands widespread in the eastern paciﬁc widespread – west paciﬁc to hawaii endemic – taiwan to southern japan mean marine larval duration (days) references 99 ± 16 yamasaki et al.

(2005a) have shown that s. lago- cephalus is the most recent sicyopterus species and that it might have acquired speciﬁc abilities allowing it to colonise environments over great distances. otolith growth the otolith’s mean growth can be used to assess the growth pattern of postlarvae at sea. we show that there is a relationship between the longest radius of the otolith and the standard length of the postlarvae, therefore linking the otolith’s growth trend to the larvae’s growth trend while at sea. the variation observed for the ﬁrst 10 increments is due to differences in individual early life history (iguchi & mizuno 1990). but, for all three species, we have found a similar growth pattern: the mean otolith growth at the beginning of the larval life is high, decreasing drastically during the ﬁrst 20 days spent at sea, and decreasing even more when the individual starts metamorphosis. the newly hatched s. lagocephalus larvae have 3–4 days to drift downstream towards the sea (bell & brown 1995; valade et al., unpublished data). during their downstream migration in freshwater, larvae do not undergo any development. it in is the arrival larval duration for three sicyopterus species estimated by otolith analysis saltwater that triggers the transformations in the larvae (lindstrom & brown 1994; lindstrom 1998; valade 2001; yokoi & hosoya 2005). the mouth opens and the yolk sac is absorbed. it takes 3–7 days for these transformations to occur (hirashima & tachihara 2000; yamasaki & tachihara 2006, 2007; valade et al., unpublished data). this would explain why the growth rate is high during the early life stages of the newly hatched larvae, as they are able to use yolk sac’s energy. the rate then decreases rapidly as the larvae undergo major transformations corresponding to the opening of the mouth and the setting of all internal organs (depeche & billard 1994). after the down- stream migration, one of the hypotheses is that the larvae are passively transported to the open sea (murphy & cowan 2007). there, larvae supposedly live a planktonic life, feeding off plankton, which is not as rich as the yolk sac reserves, although they are in a state of high energy demand, which would explain why their growth decreases drastically. this decreasing trend would seem to last until the larval development is complete or until larvae reach coastal waters. sorensen & hobson (2005) used stable isotope analysis to evaluate the sources of nutrients used by amphidrom- ous gobiid ﬁsh (lentipes concolor, sicyopterus stimp- soni gill, 1860, awaous guamensis) caught migrating into and living in hakalau stream, hawaii. stable isotope values of recruiting gobies were consistently closer to those of both inshore plankton and freshwater adults than those of offshore plankton, suggesting that the larvae of these species derive much of their nutrition from inshore environments inﬂuenced by freshwater (sorensen & hobson 2005). this suggests that larvae of amphidromous gobiids are liable to spend a certain amount of time in front of the river mouth to wait for appropriate recruiting conditions, ﬁnding in the process appropriate food and preparing for metamorphosis. then, the larvae will start meta- morphosing to become competent (able to colonise freshwater streams, keith et al. 2008). this marine post-larval stage would hold all the morphological transformations necessary to recruit, namely the acquisition of the sucker and the transformation of ﬁns. the beginning of the metamorphosis would explain why the growth rate does not increase although coastal food is available, as all the energy would be allocated to the transformations rather than growth. these results are supported by those found by keith et al. (2008) for s. lagocephalus in re´union island. this growth strategy at sea is quite different from that observed for eels (anguilla spp.). after hatching at sea, leptocephalus larvae show a slight increase in growth during the ﬁrst 15 days of life (around 1 )1), then a continuous decrease until the end of lmæday the leptocephalus stage followed by a drastic increase )1) corresponding to the metamorphosis (2–3 lmæday of leptocephalus into glass eels (kuroki et al. 2007; robinet et al. 2008). leptocephalus larvae lack yolk sac and feed directly on the available food in the environment, explaining the slight increase in growth, and why the growth rate is much lower than for sicyopterus species. moreover, leptocephalus larvae have special molecules, glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to store energy for metamorphosis, explaining the high growth rate during metamorphosis. these strate- gies are quite different in sicyopterus, as their growth rate decreases during metamorphosis, none of their energy being allocated to growth; individuals stop growing during metamorphosis and their total and standard lengths decrease (keith et al. 2008). these differences were robinet et al. (2008) found differences in the mean otolith growth rates for different eel species and noted related to speciﬁc that migration routes. in our study, we found that the otolith growth rate after hatching is lower for the cosmopolitan (5.71 ± )1) than for the two endemic species 0.65 lmæday )1; s. sarasini: 7.02 ± (s. aiensis: 6.76 ± 0.81 lmæday 0.6 lmæday indicating that these species might use different migratory routes when they arrive at sea; this result may be an additional explanation for endemism. )1) species s. lagocephalus hatching date back-calculation than a week, we have determined that s. lagocephalus postlarvae caught in november in vanuatu hatched between may and august, whereas s. aiensis caught at the same time mainly hatched in august. keith (2003) indicates that the incubation period lasts between 24 and 70 h for sicydiinae species. the embryonic development being shorter the hatching date is practically the same as the spawning date. spawning of sicyopterus species in vanuatu therefore took place after the rainy season, which occurs between novem- ber and april in vanuatu (bonnemaison 1973). the rainy season was supposed to be favourable to spawning as larvae are more easily transferred to sea (radtke et al. 1988). but it has also been shown that the downstream migration is also favoured by shallow waters, rather than too deep a river as it is too energy demanding for the larvae to swim in too great a depth (valade et al., unpublished data). during this period, from may to november, there is less water in the rivers than in the main rainy months, favouring downstream migration. nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that s. lago- cephalus is a cosmopolitan species (keith et al. 2005a), and that the postlarvae recruiting in november in vanuatu might come from another country where the dry and wet seasons may be different. it would thus be interesting to monitor monthly in order to 35 lord et al. determine the spawning and recruitment peak periods for these species. the results of this type of work would be problematic to interpret for the cosmopolitan species on account of its possible diverse origins, but it would be of great interest for the endemic species, especially in terms of species management. conclusion limiting their dispersion, the age at recruitment, and therefore the duration of the marine larval phase of two amphidromous endemic species, s. aiensis (vanuatu) and s. sarasini (new caledonia) is considerably shorter than that of the cosmopolitan species, s. lagocephalus. the var- iability of the duration of the marine larval phase between these different species could be one factor explaining these species’ distribution by favouring or therefore partially explaining endemism, and this is the opposite of what has been found for reef ﬁsh (wellington & victor 1989; victor & wellington 2000). there are, however, probably many other factors to explore (i.e., behaviour at sea, environment, biogeography, swimming depths and currents used, substrate pref- erences, etc.) in order to understand the persistence of geographically close endemic species and a cosmopolitan species despite their all having sup- posedly the same type of life cycle. amphidromy is an adaptation to the colonisation of insular and isolated environments and to the dispersion to and from such environments. moreover, the lengthy duration of the marine larval phase might be an adaptation to delay metamorphosis in order to reach favourable rivers to colonise, to disperse over long distances and colonise distant and isolated islands. our study improves our understanding on how these species disperse and are distributed. the otolith growth is correlated to the ﬁsh’s standard length, allowing us to extrapolate which events take place at sea during larval and post-larval life, like pinpointing the decrease in the growth after the absorption of the yolk sac and the beginning of metamorphosis at sea. the growth study allowed us to gain a better understanding of the processes undergone during the marine life, and we have shown that there are probably different migratory routes taken by the endemic and the cosmopolitan species. all these results need to be completed by catching larvae at sea, which has not yet been achieved. this work has also allowed us to improve our knowledge on the spawning and recruitment periods, although regular monitoring, particularly of the en- demic species, would give us access to a lot more information; this is needed to provide a basis for managing the larval ﬁsheries, and banning adult ﬁshing during the peak reproduction period (keith 2003). 36 on the whole, this study has enabled us to improve our knowledge of the dispersion processes undergone by amphidromous sicydiinae, and espe- cially the difference between endemic and cosmopol- itan species. these new insights will help implement conservation measures for these species and their habitat, as well as for ﬁsheries management. some of the species studied are endangered, particularly s. sarasini, which is only present in a few rivers in the south of new caledonia, and is threatened by nickel mining activities. the presence of these species in any river is a good indicator of water and environment quality. these species’ life cycle is complicated and needs an ocean-river corridor free of any impassable obstacles to let them undertake their downstream and upstream migrations (lord & keith 2008). acknowledgements first, we would like to thank all the partners that have
