territorial behaviour; body size; subtropical stream; plecoglossidae introduction conspeciﬁcs generally occupy the same food niche, which results in intraspeciﬁc food competition (ward et al. 2006). however, the intensity of food competi- tion varies on the basis of several environmental factors such as food abundance and competitor density (hixon 1980; schoener 1983; tricas 1989; keeley & grant 1995; grant 1997; keeley & mcphail 1998); consequently, foraging strategies may differ among correspondence: s. awata, sado marine biological station, faculty of science, niigata university, 87 tassha, sado 952-2135, japan. e-mails: sa-awata@ cc.niigata-u.ac.jp;

grant 1997; morrell & kokko 2005; tanaka et al. 2011). even within populations, behavioural modes are diverse among individuals, and intraspeciﬁc variation in behavioural modes such as territorial, schooling and ﬂoating has been reported for many ﬁsh species (e.g., greenling: gomelyuk & leunov 1999; parrotﬁsh: ogden & buckman 1973; salmon: puckett & dill 1985; surgeonﬁsh: morgan & kramer 2004, 2005 and references therein). rockﬁsh: larson 1980; it plecoglossus altivelis, with its two subspecies (ayu p. a. altivelis temmink & schlegel and ryukyu-ayu p. a. ryukyuensis nishida; nishida 1988), is an amphidromous ﬁsh having an annual life history. sexually mature ﬁsh spawn in the lower reach of rivers in autumn, with the newly hatched larvae drifting into the sea. young ﬁsh migrate upstream in spring, after which they grow and mature in the middle reach of rivers. most plecoglossus individuals live for 1 year and die after spawning. plecoglossus is widely distributed in the japanese archipelago occurring from the temperate to the subtropical region; is also sparsely found in the korean peninsula and along the chinese coast (nishida 1986; iguchi & nishida 2000; xiujuan et al. 2005). during growth periods in summer, the ﬁsh forage predom- inantly on algae growing on riverbed substrates by using their comb-like teeth specialised for algae grazing. plecoglossus ﬁshes are characterised by their keeping of territory exclusively for food and not for reproduction (e.g., kawanabe 1957; mizuno & kawanabe 1957; iguchi & hino 1996). however, the level of territoriality varies greatly depending on environmental variation. for instance, when ﬁsh density is extremely high, they forage in aggregations instead of establishing their own feeding territories (kawanabe 1957, 1970). additionally, intraspeciﬁc variation in behavioural modes has been reported for this genus (kawanabe 1957, 1972; tachihara & kimura 1988a). as individual competitive ability in ﬁsh generally increases with body size, larger ﬁsh have an advantage in acquiring territories (e.g., kohda 1991; castro & caballero 1998; szabo 2002; whiteman & coˆte´ 2004). furthermore, in plecoglossus species, larger ﬁsh establish feeding territories to monopolise algae, whereas smaller ﬁsh are solitary or form schools (iguchi & hino 1996; katano et al. 2004). following territory acquisition, they develop morphological traits probably related to territorial display, including elongated dorsal ﬁn and bright colouration (kawanabe 1957; tachihara & kimura 1988a, 1992; iguchi & hino 1999), and 2 the that to the glacial period of ryukyu-ayu is a critically endangered ﬁsh found only in amami-oshima island and okinawa island in southern japan (nishida 1988; nishida et al. 1992; shinomiya 2003; tsuruta et al. 2009) and belongs to one of the groups that occupy the lowest latitudinal region among salmonoidei (nelson 2006). several genetic analyses suggest the two subspecies ryukyu-ayu and ayu diverged about 1 ma, which corresponds late pleistocene (nishida 1985, 1986, 1988). since then, ryukyu-ayu may have adapted to the environment of subtropical island streams. indeed, ryukyu-ayu differs from ayu in several morphological traits (nishida 1986, 1988). differences in the reproductive and life history characteristics have also been found between subspecies: compared with ayu, ryukyu-ayu spawn larger but fewer eggs (nishida 1986; iguchi 1993), have a longer reproductive season and have shorter stay periods in the sea during the early developmental stage (kishino & shinomiya 2003, 2004). addition- ally, a number of ﬁsh are known to overwinter and live for more than 1 year, although most ryukyu-ayu individuals have a lifespan of only 1 year (shinomiya 1997, 2003). considering together this evidence and that algal productivity is considerably lower in the streams of amami-oshima island than in temperate rivers where the ayu lives (abe et al. 2008), it is assumed that the feeding ecology of ryukyu-ayu should differ from that of the inhabitants of the japanese main islands. however, to date, only one study has investigated the feeding ecology of ryukyu- ayu. kawanabe (1972) found that like ayu, ryukyu- ayu of okinawa island exhibit various behavioural modes: territorial, schooling and solitary. however, kawanabe also found that unlike ayu of the japanese main islands, ryukyu-ayu had larger and widely overlapping home ranges. additionally, individuals did not maintain their territories for long periods (often <2 days), and territory owners often allowed intrusion by other conspeciﬁcs. therefore, kawanabe (1972) concluded that ryukyu-ayu territoriality is unstable. however, this study showed only qualitative data; thus, little information is available about ryukyu-ayu social structure and feeding behaviour. consequently attain higher growth rates than nonter- ritorial ﬁsh (iguchi & hino 1996). here, to assess whether behavioural modes of ryukyu-ayu vary between individuals of different sizes and whether its feeding ecology differs from that of its subspecies ayu, we investigated social structure and territorial behaviour of ryukyu-ayu in a subtrop- ical island stream. first, we studied the variations in behavioural modes and examined whether body size, feeding and aggression are related to the behavioural mode. second, we investigated territory-defence behaviour, territory size and territory stability. if the feeding territory and behavioural variations in ryukyu-ayu social structure of ryukyu-ayu is similar to that described in a previous study by kawanabe (1972), feeding territories should widely overlap, and individ- uals should frequently shift their territories within short periods. finally, we discuss feeding strategies of ryukyu-ayu, comparing the feeding frequency, terri- tory size and body size of the territory owners with those of ayu inhabiting the temperate regions. accord- ing to models of optimal territory size (hixon 1980; schoener 1983), we predict the ryukyu-ayu territory size is larger than the ayu territory size in the japanese main islands because of lower algal produc- tivity of streams in amami-oshima island. that materials and methods in catchment area) field study was conducted from 28 to 30 august 2009 in the middle reaches of yakugachi river of amami- oshima island, kagoshima, japan (fig. 1). yakugachi river is one of the largest streams of the island (16 km in length and 45 km2 that discharges into the paciﬁc ocean. ryukyu-ayu is relatively abundant here as compared to its abundance in other streams of the island (nishida et al. 1992). in summer, the density of ryukyu-ayu is much higher in the middle reach than in upper and lower reaches, and many territory holders are found in the middle reach (nishida et al. 1992; s. awata, s. abe, t. tsuruta, k. iguchi, unpublished data). therefore, our study site is considered to represent the natural habitats of ryukyu-ayu. the water temperature mea- amami-oshima island 28˚30´n east china sea 28˚20´ 28˚10´ 28˚00´ yakugachi river pacific ocean 129˚00´ 129˚30´ 129˚45´e fig. 1. map showing the study site location (shown as an open circle) in yakugachi river, amami-oshima island, southern japan. the study site is located approximately 8 km upstream from the stream mouth. sured between 12:00 and 17:00 during the study period was in the range of 26.4–27.4 °c. we conducted two ﬁeld survey series by using snorkels and included census and behavioural obser- vations of individual ﬁsh. first, to investigate social structure, ﬁsh density and frequency distribution of body size, we established a census area of a 202-m reach of a stream with a mean channel width of 11.6 m (range = 6.3–20.0 m) and a mean water depth of 0.6 m (1.4 m maximum). the substrate within the census area consisted of boulders, cobble, gravel and some sand. water velocity measured with a current meter (cr-11; cosmo riken, kashiwara, japan) was 0.05–0.45 mæs)1. the area was divided into six sections of 14.5–54.5 m each, based on water velocity, depth and substrate. in each section, one or two observers (depending on the channel width) slowly snorkelled in an upstream direction along the line of maximum depth. during this period, all ﬁsh species seen within 2 m of each observer were counted, and their estimated size was recorded to the nearest 5 mm. ryukyu-ayu individuals were classiﬁed into four behavioural modes, as described by kawanabe (1957), tachihara & kimura (1988a) and iguchi & hino (1999): (i) schooling ﬁsh, deﬁned as two or more individuals swimming together in the same direction and foraging in groups without any aggressions towards each other; (ii) solitary ﬁsh, those that fed alone within a certain area; (iii) territorial ﬁsh, those that protected a certain area from conspeciﬁcs and foraged exclusively in the area, with most ﬁsh having elongated dorsal ﬁns and markedly bright body colours; and (iv) ﬂoaters, those without a territory and roaming around other ﬁsh territories. note that there was a high possibility that some territorial ﬁsh that did not exhibit aggression and individuals that parted from the school for short periods were recorded as solitary. second, to investigate territoriality, the behaviour of 42 haphazardly selected territorial ﬁsh in the census area was observed for 10-min focal observation periods in the daytime (0900–1600 h). prior to the initiation of detailed observations, we recorded the estimated body sizes of the focal ﬁsh [standard length (sl), to the nearest 5 mm] and their swimming paths and made a simple topographical map based on the position of large boulders. note that ryukyu-ayu is critically endangered, so capture is not permitted. during the focal observations, we recorded the number of feeding acts (in the ﬁrst 3 min), the feeding positions, and the number of ﬁsh encounters and aggressive acts against conspeciﬁcs and heterospecif- ics (noting body size and species name). ryukyu-ayu quickly approached the riverbed substrate and stripped algae off the substrate by using its comb-like teeth while taking a single bite. thus, feeding rates were 3 awata et al. deﬁned as the number of bites per minute. this deﬁnition is identical to that used in previous studies on ayu (e.g., iguchi & hino 1996). a few territorial ﬁsh also consumed drifting materials. therefore, we also recorded the number of bites in the water column. when territorial ﬁsh encountered conspeciﬁcs and heterospeciﬁcs, they often, but not always, exhibited territorial behaviours, including attacks (attacking and chasing intruders), threats (approaching but not chas- ing intruders) and lateral displays (approaching intrud- ers and showing their own lateral side with all ﬁns spread). after observing the focal ﬁsh, we measured distances between landmarks (i.e., large boulders) to the nearest 0.01 m in or around the feeding areas of territory owners for the measurements of feeding area size. borders of feeding areas were determined by feeding positions. the owners of the feeding areas repelled the intruders from this area; thus, these areas were considered ‘feeding territories’ (following the criteria by kohda 1991). finally, a plastic plate (110 · 70 mm) with a unique number was put on a cobble in the centre of the territory with an elastic band to allow us to relocate the same territory on different days. all behaviours were recorded in 40 of 42 ﬁsh, as feeding was not counted for two individ- uals. of these 42 individuals, eight neighbouring individuals that occupied territory on and around a gentle concrete slope were observed from the land through polarising sunglasses, and the other 34 were observed underwater via the snorkelling equipment. to increase sample sizes, we observed feeding behaviours for 3 min and measured territory size of 12 ﬁsh, but aggressive behaviours were not noted. while observations were conducted two or three times for each territorial ﬁsh on different days in many cases, all analyses were performed using data of the ﬁrst observation of each individual to prevent pseudo- replication. preliminary observations suggested that ﬁsh showed two foraging modes: foraging on benthic algae and on drifting materials. in addition, ﬁsh with different behavioural modes appeared to adopt different forag- ing modes. to assess these differences among behavioural modes, the number of feeding bites in the water column was recorded in 13 schooling, 14 solitary and 11 territorial ﬁsh, and the number of feeding bites of benthic algae was recorded in 15 schooling and 11 solitary ﬁsh during the 1- to 3-min observation periods (mean = 1.9 min). aggressive behaviour of the latter 15 schooling and 11 solitary ﬁsh was also recorded. note that because it was difﬁcult to observe schooling ﬁsh continuously, their observation periods were <3 min in many cases. we observed 16 and 14 territories on 2 and 3 consecutive days, respectively. using these data, we assessed whether ryukyu-ayu feeding territories were 4 established at the same place for more than 1 day and whether the probability of territory loss (or territory takeover) was related to the body size of the territory owner. if the same individual (assumed based on body size, feeding position and swimming routes) guarded the territory during all observation periods, it was regarded to have not lost its territory. however, if the territorial ﬁsh was not seen at the same place on the next day or the body size and behaviour of the territory owner differed from that of the earlier one, the original territory owner was considered to have disappeared. respectively), as we did not obtain all data from all individuals, sample size varied between analyses: frequency of feeding on benthic algae (territorial ⁄ solitary ⁄ school, n = 52 ⁄ 11 ⁄ 15, feeding on drifting materials (n = 63 ⁄ 14 ⁄ 13), number of interactions (n = 42 ⁄ 11 ⁄ 15) and territory size (n = 54 territorial ﬁsh). statistical analyses were performed using the software spss 16.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). parametric or nonparametric tests were used according to the distribution of the data to be analysed. all reported p-values are two-tailed. results school during the census, we found a total of 546 ryukyu- ayu and 419 other ﬁsh, including 236 grazing gobies (sicyopterus japonicus), 100 nongrazing gobies (tridentiger kuroiwae and rhinogobius spp.), 48 ﬂagtails (kuhlia marginata and kuhlia rupestris), 31 young bigeye trevallies (caranx sexfasciatus), two giant mottled eels (anguilla marmorata) and two young mullets (mugil sp.) in the total area surveyed (712 m2). the mean (sd) ryukyu-ayu density in this area was 0.74 (0.48) ﬁshæm)2 (n = 10 censuses in six sections). the occurrence frequencies of ryukyu-ayu differed among the four behavioural modes (fig. 2): schooling ﬁsh (mean [sd] size = 6 [6], range = 2–32, mode = 2, n = 51 schools) were the most abundant (mean [sd] density = 0.39 [0.47] ﬁshæm)2), followed by solitary ﬁsh (0.23 [0.17] ﬁshæm)2), territorial ﬁsh (0.10 [0.14] ﬁshæm)2) and the rarely observed ﬂoaters (0.02 [0.03] ﬁshæm)2). body sizes were signiﬁcantly associated with behavio- (fig. 2; anova, f3,542 = 65.2, p < ural modes 0.0001). multiple comparisons revealed that schooling ﬁsh were the smallest of all behavioural modes (tukey hsd post hoc all p < 0.0001) and that ﬂoaters were the largest (ﬂoater vs. others, all p < 0.02). body size of the solitary ﬁsh did not differ from that of the territorial ﬁsh (p = 0.8). the feeding rate of benthic algae did not differ among ﬁsh in any behavioural modes (fig. 3a; anova, f2,75 = 1.1, p = 0.3), although territorial ﬁsh foraged on algae on boulders while schooling ﬁsh often grazed on the sandy bottom. however, schooling schooling vs. others, test, feeding territory and behavioural variations in ryukyu-ayu 90 60 30 0 60 30 0 30 0 20 schooling (n = 325) solitary (n = 160) territorial (n = 50) floating (n = 11) i i l s a u d v d n i f o r e b m u n 0 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 sl (mm) fig. 2. size-frequency histograms of ryukyu-ayu observed during the census. i ) 1 – n m · s e t i b ( e t i a r g n d e e f 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 40 30 20 10 0 (a) n = 15 11 52 (b) n = 13 a 14 b 63 c schooling solitary territorial fig. 3. differences in the feeding rate among ﬁsh with different behavioural modes.

ﬁsh, most (79%) of which never showed such a feeding behaviour (fig. 3b; kruskal–wallis 2 = 57.3, p < 0.0001). all territorial ﬁsh showed aggressive behav- iours against conspeciﬁcs, such as attacks, threats and lateral displays (mean ± se number of aggressive behaviours per 10 min = 9.2 ± 0.8, range = 1.0–24.0, n = 42), whereas schooling (n = 15) and solitary ﬁsh (n = 11) did not show any aggressive behaviours (kruskal–wallis test, v2 2 = 50.4, p < 0.0001). territo- rial and solitary ﬁsh were attacked by conspeciﬁcs at the rate of 0.5 ± 0.2 (mean ± se, per 10 min, range = 0.0–5.0, n = 42) and 4.7 ± 2.6 (0.0–21.0, n = 11), and their frequencies tended to be higher than those of schooling ﬁsh (n = 15) that were not observed being attacked by other ryukyu-ayu (krus- kal–wallis test, v2 2 = 5.1, p = 0.08). schooling ﬁsh were not observed to enter or feed in the defended areas of territorial individuals. observations of territorial behaviour revealed that territory owners exhibited an aggressive behaviour whenever they encountered conspeciﬁcs (table 1). in contrast, territorial ﬁsh did not show any acts towards nongrazing gobies, ﬂagtails or bigeye trevallies. ryukyu-ayu occasionally (but not always) exhibited attacking behaviour against the grazing goby s. japo- nicus (table 1). the body size of the grazing gobies seemed to inﬂuence the attacks by ryukyu-ayu; attacked gobies (mean [sd] sl = 69.4 [10.6] mm, n = 16) were signiﬁcantly larger than nonattacked gobies (60.0 [10.0] mm, n = 15; unpaired t-test, t = 2.5, p = 0.02). attacks by the grazing gobies on the ryukyu-ayu individuals were observed only once during the 416-min total observation time. most of the 385 and 27 aggressive behaviours given and received by the 42 territory owners, respectively, were attacks and threats (table 2). however, territorial ﬁsh chan- ged their aggressive behaviour depending on the characteristics of their opponents. territorial ﬁsh more frequently performed lateral displays than attacks and threats when encountering larger ﬁsh or schooling ﬁsh (fisher’s exact test, d.f. = 2, p < 0.0001). territorial ﬁsh received lateral displays only from smaller ﬁsh or ﬁsh of similar body size, whereas they often received attacks or threats from larger ﬁsh (table 2; fisher’s exact test, d.f. = 1, p = 0.002). an example of feeding territories is shown in fig. 4. feeding territories abutted or overlapped one another, especially between individuals with different body sizes (b and c, c and d, and e and f). however, larger territorial ﬁsh apparently did not allow smaller neighbours to enter their territory. when a larger territorial ﬁsh foraged in a place far from the overlapping area, a smaller neighbouring territory holder fed on the attached algae in the

arrow denotes the direction of water ﬂow. we did not conduct behavioural observations in the dark grey area consisting of boulders, cobble and gravel in which several territorial ﬁsh were seen. the larger ﬁsh foraged in the area, whereas if overlapping area, the smaller ﬁsh foraged outside the area. if a larger territorial ﬁsh noticed a smaller neighbour intruding upon its territory, it drove the smaller ﬁsh away. feeding territory size correlated signiﬁcantly with body size (spearman’s rank corre- lation, rs = 0.36, n = 54, p = 0.008), although it varied widely among individuals, even among the ﬁsh with the same body size (fig. 5). in most cases (21 ⁄ 30 territorial ﬁsh, 70%), the presumed same individuals were found to have their feeding territories at the same place on the next day. however, territory stability depended on the body size of territory owners, and smaller ﬁsh (<105 mm) were more likely territory than larger ﬁsh to disappear (logistic coefﬁ- cient ± se of

additionally, we detected four cases in which territory owners were presumably displaced (probably from being taken over) by other ﬁsh, all of which were larger than the previous territorial owners (previous owner: mean [sd] sl = 92.5 [9.6] mm; new owner: all 120 mm sl; paired t-test, t = )5.7, p = 0.01). discussion variation in behavioural modes and their characteristics we found that ryukyu-ayu in amami-oshima island exhibit four different behavioural modes: schooling, solitary, territorial and ﬂoating. these behavioural modes, excluding those of large ﬂoaters, were observed in a previous study on ryukyu-ayu in okinawa island (kawanabe 1972). these suggest that behavioural mode variations may be widespread in the natural habitats of ryukyu-ayu. in this study, because many territorial and several schooling ﬁsh may have been counted as solitary ﬁsh, the densities of schooling and territorial individuals were possibly underesti- mated. nevertheless, the density of schooling ﬁsh was much higher than that of territorial ﬁsh at this study site, which we will discuss later via comparisons with ayu. body sizes were associated with behavioural modes in the following order: ﬂoating > territo- rial = solitary > schooling, ranged widely from 60 to 160 mm. there are two possible reasons for this variation. first, the long upstream migration season lasting 4 months from winter to spring, which is because of the long spawning season, produces size variations during the early growth period (kishino & shinomiya 2003, 2004). second, differences in the growth rate among behavioural modes may explain the wide variation in body size. an experimental study on ayu revealed that territorial ﬁsh generally grow faster than nonterritorial ﬁsh (iguchi & hino 1996). success in feeding territory acquisition can be determined by relative body size at settlement; simultaneously, territorial status accelerates the growth rates of the owners, which may produce high variation in the body size of ryukyu-ayu. and the sizes while no difference in the feeding rate of benthic algae was found among behavioural modes, territorial ﬁsh foraged on algae on boulders and schooling ﬁsh often grazed on the sandy bottom. although we do not have data regarding the energy intake by grazing from boulders and sand for this ﬁsh, is known that consuming the sediment by foraging imposes ener- getic costs in grazing catﬁsh (power 1984). further- more, small (probably schooling) ayu had more sand in their stomachs than did large territory owners (ueda & okada 1934). thus, schooling ryukyu-ayu may gain energy intake by grazing much lower than it territory holders. schooling and solitary ryukyu-ayu frequently foraged on drifting materials as well as grazed on algae, whereas territorial owners predomi- nantly foraged on benthic algae. an experimental study using ayu showed that nonterritorial ﬁsh follow close behind territory holders and feed on drifting algae that were released by the grazing of territorial ﬁsh (d. hoshino, s. abe, k. iguchi, i. akagawa, n. suzuki, unpublished data). schooling and solitary ryukyu-ayu may also forage on such drifting algae. taken together, schooling and solitary individuals frequently feed on drifting materials probably because the energy intake by grazing is not enough. unlike territory holders, schooling ﬁsh did not attack conspeciﬁcs and rarely received aggression from other individuals. schooling ﬁsh have low competitive ability to take over the feeding territories of other territory owners owing to their small body size (fig. 2). other species of algae-grazing ﬁsh use schooling to over- whelm the territorial defences of conspeciﬁc or hetero- speciﬁc competitors (e.g., foster 1985; kohda & takemon 1996; morgan & kramer 2004). we did not observe invasions of territories by schools of ryuku- ayu. thus, schooling appears to serve a different function in this species, and aggression between school- ing ﬁsh and other individuals was rare. when schooling ﬁsh approached a territory, the territory owners did not always show intensive attacks towards them, exhibiting lateral displays instead. in contrast, although attacks against territorial ﬁsh by solitary individuals were not observed, territory holders frequently attacked solitary ﬁsh. the lack of difference in the body size between solitary and territorial ﬁsh suggests that solitary individ- uals are probably potential territorial ﬁsh and thus were frequently attacked by territory owners. individuals, in this study, we found that many ﬂoaters were among the largest individuals in the observed popu- lations. unlike territorial these ﬂoaters were not brightly coloured and did not have elongated dorsal ﬁns. such types of ﬂoaters were not found in a previous study on ryukyu-ayu (kawanabe 1972). it is known that ryukyu-ayu and ayu sometimes over- winter in the subtropical streams and rivers connected to the hot springs because of the warm water temperature (tachihara & kimura 1988b; shinomiya 1997, 2003). the body sizes of the large ﬂoaters found in this study did not overlap with those of territorial ﬁsh, suggesting that the ﬂoaters are highly likely to be yearling ﬁsh (1+). although quantitative data are lacking, we observed that large ﬂoater ﬁsh frequently intruded feeding territories and fed on bottom algae regardless of territory owner aggression. territory holders appeared unable to drive out the ﬂoater because of their body size differences (s. awata, personal observation). similar behaviours of presum- ably yearling ryukyu-ayu have also been observed by 7 awata et al. other researchers (k. tachihara, t. yonezawa, per- sonal communications). these ﬁndings suggest that yearling ﬁsh should have differing feeding tactics from those of territorial ﬁsh, wherein they take advantage of their body size. territoriality and territory stability territorial ryukyu-ayu showed aggressive behaviour against conspeciﬁcs but never attacked nongrazing gobies, ﬂagtails or bigeye trevallies whose food niches did not overlap with theirs. however, ryukyu-ayu occasionally (but not always) exhibited attacking behaviours against grazing gobies s. japonicus. we also noted only a single case when a grazing goby attacked a ryukyu-ayu. these behaviour patterns between the two species are generally consistent with the results of previous studies (kawanabe 1972; nishida et al. 1992). both ayu and grazing gobies mainly feed on benthic diatoms and cyanobacteria (doˆtu & mito 1955; tachihara & kimura 1992). we do not yet know how these two species with apparently highly overlapping niches are able to coexist without severe food competition. one possi- bility is that the large differences in body size between the two species rarely lead to conﬂicts over food resources. in fact, territorial ryukyu-ayu attacked only large gobies. there is evidence that the upstream movements of large (mature) s. japonicus individuals would mitigate food and habitat competition with ayu and contribute to their coexistence in temperate streams (abe et al. 2007). further studies on the distribution patterns of the two species within sub- tropical the feeding and aggressive behaviours of s. japonicus, and rigorous examinations of their food items may determine their coexistence patterns with highly overlapping foraging niches. island streams, unlike a previous study that reported that territory owners shifted their feeding area even within 1 day (kawanabe 1972), in this study, 70% of the ﬁsh maintained their feeding territories at the same place on the next day. although we did not individually mark ﬁsh for identiﬁcation, feeding positions and swimming routes were quite similar among the individuals observed on different days, on the basis of which we judged the nonreplacement of one individual with the other. thus, it appears unlikely that we missed replacements by similar-sized individ- uals. shinomiya (1997) has also reported that 5 of 6 territorial ryukyu-ayu maintained their territories for at least 18 days. more importantly, territory stability signiﬁcantly depended on the body size of individual territory owner; territory owners larger than 105 mm sl never lost their territory, whereas the ﬁsh in the sl range of 80–100 mm frequently disappeared from their territory. this size range (80–100 mm) is in good 8 agreement with those where the schooling ﬁsh frequency declined and where the number of solitary and territorial ﬁsh increased (fig. 2). furthermore, when a ryukyu-ayu displaced the original territory owner, the new owner was always larger than the earlier. these ﬁndings in behavioural modes (schooling to solitary to territorial, and vice versa) may frequently occur for the ﬁsh that were 80–100 mm in sl. we conclude that territori- ality is stable in ryukyu-ayu at amami-oshima island and that territory holding periods are strongly affected by body size, as has been demonstrated in ﬁshes and frogs (wells 1977; robertson 1995; katano et al. 2004; lindstro¨m & pampoulie 2004). switches suggest that comparisons of feeding and territorial behaviours between subspecies of genus plecoglossus we found that ryukyu-ayu shows several differences in social structure and feeding and territorial behaviour compared with ayu. first, ryukyu-ayu ate benthic algae on the bottom substrate at an average frequency of 39 bitesæmin)1, which was much higher than that observed in ayu (in the ﬁeld, ca. 20 bitesæmin)1, miyadi 1960; in experimental ponds, 5.5 bitesæmin)1, iguchi & hino 1996; 4.6 bitesæmin)1, katano & iguchi 1996, 8.0 bitesæmin)1, iguchi & abe 2002). second, ryukyu-ayu had larger feeding territories than ayu: 0.4–4.3 m2 (this study), 3–5 m2 (kawanabe 1972) and 2.8 ± 1.9 (sd) m2 (shinomiya 1997) in ryukyu-ayu versus ca. 1 m2 (kawanabe 1957), 1–3 m2 (mizuno & kawanabe 1957; miyadi 1960) and <1 m2 (tachihara & kimura 1988a) in ayu. third, body sizes of ryukyu-ayu territory owners were much smaller than those of ayu: ryukyu-ayu, 70–140 mm; ayu, 150– 230 mm (kawanabe 1957) and 120–160 mm (tachi- hara & kimura 1988a). fourth, the proportion of schooling ﬁsh at a similar ﬁsh density in case of ryukyu-ayu was higher than in case of ayu: 87% [schooling ⁄ (schooling + territory); fig. 2; note this may be overestimated as already mentioned] at a ﬁsh density of 0.7æm)2 for ryukyu-ayu, and 55–62% at a density of 0.3–0.9æm)2 for ayu (kawanabe 1970). a plausible explanation for these differences between subspecies is the difference in algal produc- tivity between streams in amami-oshima island and rivers in the japanese main islands. as the productiv- ity of benthic algae is considerably lower in the subtropical island streams compared with other rivers inhabiting ayu (abe et al. 2008), a high feeding frequency and large feeding area are indispensable for ryukyu-ayu territory holders to compensate for lower algal productivity. karino (1998) has also suggested in an herbivorous cichlid ﬁsh that lower algal productiv- ity probably accounts for the larger territory size seen in deeper sites. while ryukyu-ayu territory holders feeding territory and behavioural variations in ryukyu-ayu have higher feeding rates and larger territory sizes, their body sizes are signiﬁcantly smaller than those of ayu, suggesting that the territory holders would maintain their territory when the net beneﬁt of foraging is low. in addition, given the fact that the proportion of schooling ﬁsh is higher even at lower densities, only larger ﬁsh in the population can acquire sufﬁcient net beneﬁts by holding territories, and many smaller individuals are unable to maintain territories partly due to the low algal productivity. an alternative explanation for the high feeding frequency of ryukyu- ayu may be the high water the subtropical streams. in fact, higher feeding rates at higher water temperatures are widely known in marine herbivorous ﬁshes (ferreira et al. 1998; floeter et al. 2005; smith 2008). however, because ryukyu-ayu feeding rates at 14 °c (measured in ayu at 16–24 °c in the studies above) in winter were also higher than ayu (ca. 19 bitesæmin)1, n = 15 ﬁsh; those of s. awata, t. tsuruta, s. abe, k. iguchi, unpublished data), low algal productivity is probably a major factor affecting the high feeding frequency. temperature of as has been previously reported (kawanabe 1972), we found that the feeding territories of ryukyu-ayu frequently overlapped with those of adjacent territorial individuals, which was rarely observed in ayu (e.g., mizuno & kawanabe 1957). the body size variation of the territorial ﬁsh was large (70–140 mm, see figs 2 and 5), and territory overlaps generally occurred between different-sized individuals (fig. 4). ryukyu-ayu maintains larger feeding territories than ayu in the japanese main islands despite having smaller body sizes. hence, intrusion into adjacent territories may readily occur. considering this evi- dence, high variations in the body sizes of territory holders and a large territory size may account for the territory overlap in this species. conclusion in summary, we have provided clear evidence of the social structure and territoriality of ryukyu-ayu. first, ryukyu-ayu show great variations in behavioural modes within a population: territorial ﬁsh guard their feeding territory against conspeciﬁcs and grazing gobies and predominantly feed on algae attached to the bottom substrates, whereas schooling and solitary ﬁsh frequently forage on drifting materials as well as benthic algae and rarely exhibit aggressive behaviours. body size is closely related to these behavioural modes. second, larger territory owners have larger feeding territories and are more likely to maintain the territories for longer periods than smaller ﬁsh. finally, considerable differences in social structure and feeding and territorial behaviour were detected between ryukyu-ayu and ayu. this implies that not only morphological and genetic traits but also feeding and social behaviour of ryukyu-ayu might have been evolved to adapt island streams where water temperatures are higher and algal pro- ductivity is lower compared with the temperate regions in which ayu live. to
