(1980) found that juv- enile white crappie primarily fed near the bottom, whereas juvenile black crappie fed near the surface in rough river lake, kentucky. the food of adult black crappie is primarily composed of zooplank- ton and insects, whereas white crappie are more likely to be piscivorous (unkenholz 1971; ball & kilambi 1972; li et al. 1976; ellison 1984). how- ever, black crappie were piscivorous in other studies (seaburg & moyle 1964; busiahn 1977). when sympatric, one species of crappie is usually dominant; white crappie typically outnum- ber black crappie in turbid waters, while black crappie are usually dominant in clear waters (goodson 1966). barefield (1984) speculated that this difference was not due to differential feeding ability of the two species, as their feeding rates were similar in turbid waters. however, pope (1996) found that physical turbidity reduced growth and survival of juvenile black crappie. differences in population dynamics between water types also exist within a species. for ex- ample, recruitment of black crappie in south dak- ota natural lakes was more variable than recruit- ment of black crappie in south dakota im- poundments. missing year classes of black crappie were more common in natural lakes (guy & willis 1995b). to better understand recruitment processes of black crappie, we compared the early life history of black crappie in richmond (an impoundment) and brant (a natural lake) lakes over a three-year period. pope & willis (1997) evaluated nest site selection by black crappie in these two water bodies. our objectives were 1) to document early life history of black crappie in systems without white crappie, and 2) to further investigate the finding by guy & willis (1 99 5b) that missing year table 1. physicochemical variables (stueven & stewart 1996) and black crap- pie population characteristics (guy & willis 1993, 1995a, 1995b) for rich- mond and brant lakes, south dakota. parameter richmmd density growth recruitment high slow relatively consistent low fast inconsistent table 2. calculation of s, variable in the recruitment variability index (rvi;

devries & stein 1991). samples were filtered through a 80-pm mesh net and pre- served in 4% sucrose-formalin (haney & hall 1973). water temperature (=20 cm below surface) was also measured once on each sampling trip. laboratory analysis adultjsh. the cpue of adult black crappie was defined as the number of crappie 2130 mm tl 58 caught per trap-net night. the cpue was used as an index to adult black crappie density (hub- ert 1996). fish population size structure was quantified using proportional stock density (psd) and relative stock density (rsd) (ander- son & neumann 1996). the formulae for these indices are: psd = number of fishrquality length number of fish2stock length x 100; rsd = number of fishzspecified length number of fishzstock length x 100 for black crappie, minimum stock, quality, pre- ferred, and memorable lengths are 130, 200, 250, and 300 mm, respectively (gabelhouse 1984a). scales from adult black crappie were pressed into cellulose acetate using a non-heat scale press (smith 1954). scale impressions were projected with a microfiche reader, annuli (kruse et al. 1993) were recorded on strips of paper, and mean back- calculated length at age was determined using a digitizing pad and disbcal software (frie 1982). back-calculated length at age was determined using the fraser-lee modification of the direct proportion method (busacker et al. 1990). the for- mula for the fraser-lee modification is: li = a+(l,-a) (s,/s,) where li is the calculated tl of fish at age i, l, is the tl of fish at capture, s, is the radius of scale at capture, and si is the measurement at annulus i. the “a” value (i.e., intercept for the body length- scale radius relation) used for black crappie was 35 mm (carlander 1982). recruitment patterns for adult black crappie populations were quantified using the recruitment variability index (rvi; guy & willis 1995b). the formula for this index is: rvi = sn -~ n m n m + n p n p where sn is the summation of the cumulative rela- tive frequency distribution based on the number of fish in each year class (see example in table 2)’ nm is the number of year classes missing from the sample that should be present (not including ages early life history of black crappie past last age captured) and n p is the number of year classes present in the sample. the rvi was calculated only for fish fully recruited to the sam- pling gear (i.e., age 2 and older black crappie). theoretically, rvi ranges from -1 to 1; as rvi increases, recruitment is more consistent. zooplankton. zooplankton samples were adjusted to a known volume, and measured subsamples were counted until at least 200 individuals from the most abundant taxon were counted. organisms were identified (to genus for cladocerans, and as nauplii, calanoid, or cyclopoid for copepods) and counted under a dissecting microscope. the first 10 individuals encountered from each taxon were measured (nearest 0.01 mm) using an ocular mi- crometer. age-ojish. stomachs from up to 20 age-0 black crappie collected in each sample (i.e.’ ichthyo- plankton trawl, 1.6-mm mesh trawl, or trap net) were removed to quantify diets after tl was re- corded for each fish. prey items were removed under a dissecting microscope, identified, and enu- merated. prey selection by age-0 black crappie in both water bodies was quantified using chesson’s table 4. age structure (number of fish per age group), recruitment variability index (rvi;

values greater than this indicate posi- tive selection, and values less than this indicate negative selection. to assess daily growth, sagittal otoliths from a subsample @=up to 20 fish per trap net) of age-0 black crappie collected during fall trap netting were removed after recording tl for each fish. ac- curacy of daily growth ring counts has not been validated for black crappie; however, this aging 60 technique has been validated for white crappie (sweatman & kohler 1991), a closely related spe- cies. this technique has also been used by other researchers (muoneke 1982; travnichek et al. 1996). otoliths were air dried and mounted (con- vex side up) on glass slides using thermoplastic ce- ment, ground with wet 600-grit sandpaper, and polished on a polishing cloth with alumina powder until center rings were visible. a droplet of low- viscosity (type a) immersion oil was placed on the otolith to improve the optical quality of the rings (sweatman & kohler 1991). daily ring counts by two independent readers were compared for pre- cision; counts that differed by 2 10% were re-exam- ined by both readers until agreement within 10% was reached. the counts of the two readers were then averaged to obtain an age estimate for each fish. using daily ring counts, we estimated hatch dates (capture date - fish age) and average daily growth rates (mm/day) for age-0 black crappie col- lected during fall. statistics differences in larval black crappie abundance, zooplankton abundance, and mean zooplankton size between the two water bodies were analyzed using a split-plot repeated-measures analysis of variance (maceina et al. 1994). each sample col- lected was used as a replicate observation for analyses. differences in fall age-0 catches from trap nets were assessed by ranking the catch data because data were not normally distributed (con- over & iman 1981). a general linear model (glm; sas 1992) was then used to test for differences in ranked catches. a glm was also used to test for differences in growth rates determined from oto- liths of fall age-0 black crappie between water bodies and among years. statistical significance was set at 95% (a=0.05). when the glm assess- ment indicated significant differences among treat- ments, tukey’s multiple range test was used to de- termine which means were different at a=0.05. results adult fish the cpue for black crappie 2130 mm tl varied from year to year and between seasons (table 3). however, cpue of adult black crappie in rich- mond lake was always at least an order of magni- early life history of black crappie tude higher than cpue in brant lake. the size structure of adult black crappie in both waters also varied among years and between seasons (table 3). however, the black crappie population in brant lake always had higher stock density index values than the population in richmond lake. for ex- ample, few fish exceeded minimum preferred length (25 cm) in richmond lake, while substantial pro- portions exceeded this length in brant. in fact, memorable-length (i.e., 1 3 0 cm) black crappie were collected in brant lake during the final year of this study. the age structures for both black crappie populations shifted toward older fish from 1993 to 1996; the richmond lake black crappie population always had older individuals than the brant lake population (table 4). growth rates of black crappie were faster in brant lake than in richmond lake (table 4). during spring 1996, a 5-year-old black crappie in brant lake was the same length as an 8- year-old crappie in richmond lake. larval fish abundance during 1994-1996, larval black crappie abun- dances in richmond lake peaked on 1-8 june 1994 (day of the year 152-159), 22 june-6 july 1995 (173-187), and 18-25 june 1996 (170-177;

fig. 1). within each year, larval black crappie abundances differed between water bodies (p<0.04; table 5). the water body x date inteactions were also significant all three years (p=o.oool). larval black crappie abun- dances were always higher in richmond lake than in brant lake, and larval black crappie abun- dances in brant lake peaked several times during 1994 and 1995. when comparing among years within each water body, no significant difference in larval abundance was found in richmond lake (p=0.214), whereas a significant difference was ob- served in brant lake (p=0.0002). however, the year x date interactions for both waters were sig- nificant (p~0.001). larval black crappie were col- lected earlier in 1994 than in 1995 or 1996 in both waters. this likely was a result of water tempera- tures warming earlier in 1994 (fig. 1). 62 zooplankton during 1994 and 1995, zooplankton abundance in richmond lake was highest at the time of first sampling and then declined (fig. 2). zooplankton abundance began to increase toward the end of the sampling period during 1994, while little increase in zooplankton abundance occurred during 1995. during 1996, the zooplankton abundance in rich- mond lake was more consistent throughout the sampling period. in brant lake, the zooplankton abundances for 1994-1996 (fig. 2) resembled abundances found in richmond lake during 1996. within each year, zooplankton abundances dif- fered between water bodies (y50.002; table 5). the water body x date interactions were also sig- nificant for 1994 and 1995 (p=o.oool), but not for 1996 (p=0.178). not only did zooplankton abun- dances differ between water bodies each year, they also differed across years within each wajer body (p=o.oool); the year x date interactions were also significant (p50.007). in richmond lake, the zooplankton com- munity was dominated by daphnia, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, and copepod nauplii (fig. 3). the brant lake zooplankton community contained the same four groups plus bosmina during 1994 and 1995 and chydorus during 1994 and 1996 (fig. 3). qualitatively, dif- ferences in zooplankton composition occurred between waters within each year. brant lake al- ways contained one more common (i.e., com- posed more than 2% of zooplankton community composition) zooplankton taxon than richmond lake. also qualitatively, differences in zooplank- ton composition occurred between years within each water body. in richmond lake, daphnia constituted a larger percentage of zooplankton early life history of black crappie composition during 1994 than in 1995 or 1996, while calanoid copepods had a larger percentage during 1996 than in 1994 or 1995. in addition, cyclopoid copepods were present only for a short time during 1996 in richmond lake. in brant lake, bosmina was not a common zooplankton taxon during 1996, while bosmina occurred in late june-early july 1994 and in late july 1995. mean zooplankton size in richmond lake tended to increase through the sampling seasons, while no pattern was evident during the sampling seasons at brant lake (fig. 2). mean zooplankton size was similar in both water bodies during 1994 and 1996 (p>0.5; table 5), but different during 1995 (p=o.ool). the water body x date interac- tions were significant all three years (p=o.oool). differences in zooplankton sizes between waters were likely a function of differences in zooplank- 1 richmond 994 1 \ brant 1  80 80 - 60 - 0 .- .ci .- 40 - v) 0 20 - q 8 100 f l l o ] 1995 0 r’ 60 s - a 40 q 0 20 0 n o c 8 80 60 n 40 100 1 i i + ca /-  1 -1 20 o ! 135 ca i 150 i 165 180 i i i 210 150 195 day of the year 135 165 180 i 195 210 fig. 3. crustacean zooplankton percent composition by number in richmond and brant lakes, south dakota, during 1994-1996. bo=bosmina sp.;

the year x date interactions were also significant (p=o.oool). similarly, differences in zooplankton sizes between years were likely a function of differ- ences in zooplankton compositions. age-0 black crappie diets in general, the percent of larval black crappie with empty stomachs declined as the summer pro- gressed in both water bodies during all 3 years (fig. 4). qualitatively, it appeared that the percen- tage of empty larval stomachs was less during 1995 than during either 1994 or 1996 for both waters. calanoid copepods were positively selected for by small (<lo mm tl) larval black crappie during 1994 and 1996 in richmond lake, and during 1994 in brant lake (fig. 5). medium-sized (10-29 mm tl) age-0 black crappie also positively se- lected for calanoid copepods in richmond lake during all three years. medium and large sized (1 0-59 mm tl) age-0 black crappie in brant lake positively selected daphnia during 1994 and 1995. the medium and large sized (1 0-59 mm tl) age-0 black crappie also exhibited negative selection for smaller sized zooplankton (ie., copepod nauplii, 64 v) 1.0 v) 0.8 1 5 a, 0.6 tj 0.0 1 11994 brant l ilzj4 * - 1 l 1 1 1 1996 0.2 0.0 1 .o 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 - 0 o.o zooplankton taxon fig. 5. prey selection (chesson's alpha;

fig. 6). mean growth rates? 1 se for age-0 black crappie in richmond lake were 0.95?0.02, 1.08?0.01, and 0.96?0.01 mddayduring 1994, 1995, and 1996, re- spectively. in brant lake, mean growth rates were 1.03?0.02, 1.18?0.02, and 1.06?0.02 mdday dur- ing 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively. the glm analysis revealed significant differences between water bodies (f=28.9, df= 1,179, p=o.oool) and years (f=34.97, df=2,179, p=o.oool) with no water body x year interaction (f=0.19, df=2,179, p=0.83). based on tukey’s multiple range test (a=0.05), growth rates were faster in brant lake (mean= 1.1 1 mdday) than in richmond lake (1.03 d d a y ) . growth rates in both waters combined were faster during 1995 (1.1 1 mm/day) than in 1994 (0.99 mdday) or 1996 (0.99 mdday), with no dif- ference in growth rates between 1994 and 1996. discussion the adult black crappie population in richmond lake was characterized by higher catches of slower growing fish, while the brant lake population was characterized by lower catches of faster growing individuals. we expected consistent recruitment of black crappie in richmond lake and inconsistent recruitment (i.e., one or more years with little or no recruitment) in brant lake, based on previous work by guy & willis (1995b). however, no com- plete recruitment failure occurred in brant lake 65 pope & willis during 1994-1996, although larval abundance was extremely low in two of the three years. the ichthyoplankton trawl and trap nets had similar trends in age-0 black crappie cpue for both water bodies (i.e., ranked peak larval abun- dance in ichthyoplankton trawl and ranked mean catches in trap nets were the same for both waters) during 1994-1996; peak larval abundance was highest in 1994 in both waters, and fall age-0 cpue was highest in 1995 in both waters. we speculate that broad environmental factors may have similarly affected black crappie reproduction and recruitment in the natural lake and im- poundment. climatological conditions varied across the three years of this study (pope 1996). we found evidence that the rate of spring water warming influences larval black crappie abun- dance, with abundance being greater in years where waters warm earlier (such as occurred dur- ing 1994). however, nesting success and resulting larval abundance apparently was not related to black crappie recruitment in our study waters. in- stead, the year with the highest fall age-0 catches in both waters (i.e., 1995) was characterized by de- layed black crappie spawning and low larval catch- es. the presence of age-0 black crappie during fall does not necessarily indicate recruitment to the adult population; however, these fish are closer to being recruited than are the larvae. we found the lowest percentage of empty larval stomachs and the fastest growth rates of age-0 black crappie dur- ing 1995, suggesting that decreased intraspecific competition may have resulted in faster growth and a stronger year class. in addition, precipitation was highest during 1995 (pope 1996), and larger year classes of crappies have been associated with increased water levels (mitzner 1981; beam 1983). in richmond lake during 1994 and 1995, larval black crappie abundance peaked after overall zoo- plankton abundance had already declined. during 1996, overall zooplankton abundance did not de- cline as in the two previous years in richmond lake and provided the highest numbers of total zooplankton per liter when larval black crappie abundance peaked. in brant lake, larval black crappie abundance peaked when overall zooplank- ton abundance was high during 1994 and 1996. during 1995, overall zooplankton abundance re- mained low in brant lake. however, 1995 was the year that produced highest catches of age-0 black crappie in the fall trap netting. thus, timing of lar- val black crappie abundance and overall zooplank- ton abundance did not appear important for re- cruitment of black crappie in these two south dakota waters. these results are in contrast to the matchlmismatch hypothesis proposed by cushing (1975; i.e., synchrony between hatching and first 66 feeding of larval fish and the occurrence of favor- able foraging conditions is an important regulating mechanism of larval survival and year-class strength). furthermore, to our surprise, nothing was unique about the cladoceran, calanoid cope- pod, cyclopoid copepod, or copepod nauplii abun- dance or mean size during 1994 or 1995 that could be related to either the high larval black crappie abundance during 1994 or the high fall age-0 crap- pie abundance during 1995 (pope 1996). the food habits of age-0 black crappie in combi- nation with zooplankton availability and vulner- ability may partially determine year-class strength in south dakota waters. the highest cpue of age-0 black crappie in fall trap nets occurred dur- ing 1995 in both study waters. during 1995, small (< 10 mm tl) age-0 black crappie consumed bus- minu in equal proportion to their occurrence in richmond lake but negatively selected them dur- ing 1994 and 1996. similarly, small black crappie consumed duphniu in equal proportion to their oc- currence in brant lake during 1995 but negatively selected them during 1994 and 1996. this study occurred during three relatively wet years with temporal differences in precipitation among years. pope et al. (1996b) found that fall age-0 black crappie cpue in a bottom trawl was negatively correlated with precipitation in brant lake over an 8-year period (1988-1995). however, pope (1996) speculated that this relationship might be caused by a biological interaction between age- 0 yellow perch perca jkzvescens and black crappie, as pope et al. (1996b) documented an inverse re- lation between cpue of age-0 yellow perch and black crappie. thus, fall age-0 trap net cpue would likely be higher during drier years than oc- curred during our study, at least in brant lake. unfortunately, we were unable to determine the cause of black crappie year-class failure (or near- failure) in brant lake. a combination of harsh cli- matic conditions during spawning (pope & willis, 1997) and again during a time period when juven- ile black crappie are especially vulnerable (some- time between when larvae were collected and fall trap netting) may be the cause, although larval yel- low perch abundance could also be a contributing factor. spawning date is important because successful nesting is a prerequisite to black crappie recruit- ment. siefert (1968) suggested that low water tem- peratures before and during white crappie spawning could reduce year-class strength. our study, however, suggests that low water tempera- ture during spring is not detrimental to black crap- pie year-class strength. the year with the highest cpue of age-0 black crappie during fall trap net- ting (1 995) was characterized by low spring water temperatures and delayed black crappie spawning. black crappie may be able to adjust to unfavorable spawning conditions. for example, some adult fe- male black crappie in richmond lake demon- strated the potential to spawn more than once dur- ing a single spawning season (pope et al. 1996a). based on our otolith age assessment of age-0 black crappie, the population in brant lake had two dis- tinct spawning times during 1994 and 1995 and there is a hint of a similar occurrence in richmond lake. this is not evidence that individuals spawn- ed more than once in either of these waters; how- ever, the otoliths provide evidence that the popula- tion as a whole did not invest all of its spawning potential at one time. there may be a critical period for black crappie recruitment between the larval stage in early sum- mer and the fall when trap netting was conducted. large numbers of larvae were collected in 1994, but few age-0 fish were captured in the trap nets. future research should concentrate on this mid- to late-summer period; we had difficulty collecting age-0 black crappie during this time. we believe that the bottom trawl discussed by pope et al. (1 996b) would effectively sample age-0 black crap- pie in most eastern south dakota natural lakes; however, we are unsure of its utility in steep-sided impoundments such as richmond lake. the results of this study initially appear contrary to the findings of guy & willis (1995b) that im- poundments had more consistent black crappie re- cruitment (i.e., missing year classes were not com- mon), while natural lakes had more inconsistent re- cruitment. however, we suspect that so-called missing year classes in eastern south dakota natu- ral lakes reflect very low abundance, simply corre- spond with weak but apparent year classes in south dakota impoundments, and are largely a result of environmental factors. thus, one possible differ- ence in black crappie recruitment processes between these two water bodies is the degree to which en- vironmental factors influence black crappie year- class strength. recruitment of black crappie in brant lake is more variable than in richmond lake likely because climatological influences on brant lake are more extreme due to its shallow nature and bowl-shaped basin. in addition, yellow perch (which are well established in south dakota natural lakes but sparse in south dakota impoundments) could also increase variability of black crappie year-class strength in natural lakes [see pope (1996) for a dis- cussion of this possible phenomenon].

la biologia de 10s primeros estadios de pomoxis nigrornuculatus. en principio, esperamos un reclutamiento variable en el algo natural y m8s consistente en el de inundacion. 2. los juveniles de edad 0 fueron colectados con tres tipos dis- tintos de redes: redes de arrastre de ictioplancton de 500 prn; redes de arrastre de 1.6 mm de luz, y trampas de 13 mm de luz. el zooplancton fuk colectado con un muestreador de tub0 de 2 m de longitud y, posteriormente filtrado en zedazo de 80 pm de luz de malla. la dieta de 10s juveniles fue tambikn analizada y, ademas, utilizamos otolitos de juveniles capturados en las trampas para determinar la fecha de eclosion. 3. la abundancia de larvas fue siempre mayor en el lago rich- mond. en ambos lagos, el pic0 de abundancia se produjo en 1994. sin embargo, este pic0 no se correspondio con las cpue de 10s individuos de edad 0, que, por el contrario, alcanzo un maximo en 1995. esto indica que el reclutamiento en p. nigro- maculutus no se debio solo a1 numero de larvas eclosionadas. los estudios sobre el zooplancton y la dieta no pusieron de manifiesto ningun hecho que explicase la maxima abundancia de 1995. 4. tendencias similares observadas en las capturas realizadas con redes de ictioplancton y con trarnpas, indicaron que amp- lios factores ambientales actuaron de forma similar sobre la reproduccion y el reclutamiento de la especie en ambos lagos. acknowledgments we thank christopher guy and dennis devries for their input in planning this research. michael brown and zen0 wicks, i11 provided statistical advice. we thank
