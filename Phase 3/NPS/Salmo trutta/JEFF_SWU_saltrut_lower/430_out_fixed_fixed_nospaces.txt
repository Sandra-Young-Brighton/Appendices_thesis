hall et al. 1979; helfman 1981); however, studies illustrating these differences have largely been descriptive. observations via scuba surveys indicate that age-0 largemouth bass, micropterus salmoides, exhibit diel patterns in habitat use and movement patterns (e.g., resting at night in veg- etation; helfman 1981), yet quantiﬁcation of these differences has not ensued. using telemetry, wood- ward (1996) found that adult and sub-adult largemouth bass moved offshore during daylight hours and to shoreline habitats at night in b. e. jordan lake, north carolina. largemouth bass is an economically valuable sportﬁsh in many coun- tries (robins & maccrimmon 1974); knowledge regarding changes in diel distribution, especially in relation to habitat, could enhance understanding of behavior and recruitment processes in this spe- cies. the diel movement patterns of juvenile ﬁshes usually involve shifts in habitat use (helfman 1981, 1993; costley 1998) related to foraging, predator avoidance and resting strategies (helfman 1993). the amount of cover may mediate speciﬁc behav- ior of juvenile ﬁshes, such as how rapidly ﬁsh ex- hibit a ﬂight response in the presence of potential predators 1987). age-0 largemouth bass are found in association with aquatic macrophytes in vegetated reservoirs and lakes (strange et al. 1982), but utilize gravel sub- stratum and steep shoreline slopes when vegetation is not present (irwin et al. 1997). cover may pro- vide age-0 largemouth bass protection from pre- dation (strange et al. 1982; miranda & hubbard 1994), yet association with cover is not pronounced (grant & noakes 229 irwin & noble at night (emery 1973; irwin 1994). the inﬂuence of cover on diel distribution in unvegetated reser- voirs should be addressed because many of these systems support important largemouth bass ﬁsh- eries (noble et al. 1994). diel shifts in habitat use of age-0 largemouth bass in littoral areas could inﬂuence population dynamics (e.g., growth, survival or recruitment rates). for example, the amount of refuge habitat and its proximity to foraging habitat may inﬂuence survival rates (walters & juanes 1993). in addition, researchers and managers require ability to collect representative samples of a population; therefore, quantiﬁcation of diel differences in distribution is needed. however, evaluations of diel differences in ﬁsh abundance and habitat use are hampered when techniques exhibit bias associated with time of day. prepositioned area electroﬁshers (paes) have been used in streams and rivers for quantitative com- parison of ﬁsh distribution and community struc- ture among habitats, and they can be used during both day and night (bain et al. 1985; costley 1998). prepositioned area electroﬁshers are effec- tive for sampling shallow-water habitats (,1 m deep) from remote locations (i.e., ambush tech- nique) and collect variable sizes of ﬁsh (e.g., from ,10 to 500 mm total length; bain et al. 1985; costley 1998). we utilized this method to address three objectives: 1) to quantify diel differences in littoral distribution of age-0 largemouth bass; 2) to quantify diel differences in ﬁsh size; and 3) to determine whether the amount of cover affected diel distribution along the shoreline of an unveg- etated reservoir. methods we collected age-0 largemouth bass using paes in b. e. jordan reservoir (jordan lake), a 5720-ha impoundment in the piedmont region of north carolina. the dam, completed in 1981, is located on the haw river below its conﬂuence with new hope creek. the primary use of the reservoir is ﬂood control, but other designated uses include ﬁsh and wildlife habitat, recreation and water sup- ply. jordan lake is shallow (mean depth‰5 m), turbid (secchi depth•0.5 m) and classiﬁed as eu- trophic (ncdnrcd 1989). conductivity in the reservoir ranges from 118 to 233 ms/cm2 during summer (jackson & noble 1995). seasonal vari- ations in water level (usually”2 m) have prevented the establishment of aquatic macrophytes. little beaver creek embayment, located at the south end of the new hope basin of the reservoir, has been a study site for long-term age-0 largemouth bass research in jordan lake; consequently, our sam- pling was conﬁned to this bay. habitats within the 230 bay are representative of those found in other em- bayments (irwin & noble 1996). little beaver creek embayment supports high densities of age-0 largemouth bass relative to other bays in jordan lake (phillips et al. 1997). surface area of the bay is 64 ha and shoreline length is 8 km. we used paes similar to those described by bain et al. (1985) in summer (3–7 august 1992 and 4– 10 august 1993) to quantitatively assess diel distri- butions of age-0 largemouth bass in the littoral zone of little beaver creek embayment. our hypo- thesis was that mean difference (d¯) in catch per unit effort (cpue‰number of age-0 largemouth bass/pae) between different time periods would be greater than zero in each year (one-tailed paired t- test, a‰0.05). we used a paired-comparison test because each observation of one treatment (i.e., day) was paired with an observation from the other (i.e., night; sokal and rohlf 1981). in ad- dition the test was one-tailed, because our hypo- thesis was that we would capture more age-0 largemouth bass in paes at night and record posi- tive mean differences. our preliminary data indicated no difference in cpue between two daytime periods, morning (0700–1200 edt) and afternoon (1200–1800 edt; n‰7 pairs; d¯‰0; p‰0.5). therefore, we compared difference in cpue between night (2100–0400 edt) and day (0700–1800 edt) periods in august 1992 and 1993. sampling was conducted over ,6-day periods during both years, resulting in 18 pairs of observations in 1992 and 28 in 1993. we systematically placed paes parallel to shore- line in nearshore 10(cid:192)1.5 m sites using a temporally distinct paired-sampling approach (i.e., one day and one night sample ‰ pair). the placement of a pae depended on the location of an adjacent site with similar habitat characters in the event that the pae had to be moved (see methods below). paes consisted of a cathode and an anode (10 m long) located 1.5 m apart and submerged. depending on the slope of a site, the nearshore electrode was in water ,0.2 m deep and the offshore electrode was never deeper than 0.7 m. to ensure adequate recol- onization of areas disturbed when paes were set, paes remained in place for 1–2 hours before they were electriﬁed from a remote area using 260 v dc. we considered this length of time before sam- pling to be conservative based on ﬁndings by bain et al. (1985) that indicated no increase in numbers of ﬁsh captured in paes after 11 minutes. the paes were electriﬁed from a remote area (.15 m away) for • 20 s while two collectors used dip nets to capture ﬁshes. all ﬁsh captured by each pae were identiﬁed to species, enumerated, and meas- ured. all age-0 largemouth bass were killed in ms- 222, placed on ice and returned to the laboratory where total length (tl) was measured to the near- est mm. day and night procedures were identical, except at night, boat-mounted and hand-held lights were used to facilitate collection of ﬁsh from paes. lights were employed only after paes were electri- ﬁed to minimize disturbance. our protocol was to leave paes undisturbed at a site for both day and night samples (i.e., paes were not moved). how- ever, to avoid depletion bias, if age-0 largemouth bass were collected in the ﬁrst sample, paes were moved to similar and usually adjacent habitat for the second sample of the pair. to adequately match site pairs, sites were chosen based on slope, cover and substratum type (see below), and exist- ence of a similar adjacent site (to serve as the sec- ond sample in the case of capture in the ﬁrst sample). habitat was characterized at each pae site in both years to ensure similarity in habitats sampled for each pair. each 10(cid:192)1.5 m site was divided into three equal areas; substratum composition (using a modiﬁed wentworth scale based on particle size; bovee 1982) and total cover (% area covered by components described below) were visually esti- mated in each third. cover types sampled were shrubs (inundated salix sp. and cephalanthus sp.), complex areas (combinations of grass hummocks, tree roots and other cover types), and inundated standing timber. areas that were cover-poor (,15% pae area covered) included shoreline areas of any substratum type; however, similar sub- stratum characters were sampled for each pair. av- erage substratum and cover characteristics were calculated for each site. depths were measured in 0.5 m intervals along three perpendicular transects located at the beginning, middle, and end of each pae site. depths were used to calculate mean slope, in percent, for each site. to determine diel differences in distribution we analyzed cpue data of age-0 largemouth bass across habitats. a paired t-test (a‰0.05) was used to investigate whether diel differences in distri- bution occurred. therefore, if distributions were different (i.e., greater cpue at night), the average difference (d¯) in cpue (night cpue minus day cpue) between pae pairs would be greater than zero. to further illustrate diel differences in distri- bution we calculated mean cpue for both day and night time periods in both years. to determine whether diel differences in distri- bution were related to ﬁsh size in both years, mean tl of age-0 largemouth bass captured in night paes was compared with mean tl of age-0 largemouth bass captured in day paes using a stu- dent’s t-test assuming unequal variances (a‰0.05). diel distribution of age-0 largemouth bass to assess potential effects of cover on diel distri- butions, eight pairs of sites with similar slope and substratum characteristics were identiﬁed and sampled with paes in august of each year. the eight pairs were selected (e.g., using visual esti- mation) based on amount of cover; four high and four low cover sites were sampled each year. stu- dent’s t-tests were used to test for signiﬁcant differ- ences in mean cover, slope and substratum charac- ters among cover-treatment pairs for each year. in this case, we used a two-tailed paired-t test (i.e., no a priori hypothesis of direction of difference; a‰ 0.05) to determine whether the difference in cpue was equal to zero in the two cover treatments in both years. results differences in cpue between day and night periods were apparent for both years. in 1992, only 41 of 197 age-0 largemouth bass were captured in the day and cpue was greater at night (n‰18, d¯‰ 6.39, se‰1.50, p‰0.0003). daytime and nighttime fig. 1. comparisons of cover, slope and gravel characteristics of high cover (n‰4) and low-cover (n‰4) treatments in 1992 and 1993. no differences in the percentage of gravel or slope were found between treatments in either year. high-cover treat- ments had signiﬁcantly more cover than low-cover treatments both years (p,0.01). 231 irwin & noble cpue was 2.28 and 8.67 age-0 largemouth bass per pae, respectively. likewise in 1993, we cap- tured a total of only 23 of 133 age-0 largemouth bass in daytime, and cpue was greater at night (n‰28, d¯‰3.11, se‰0.70, p,0.00006). because daytime cpue of age-0 largemouth bass was low in daytime, we included total length data from ﬁsh captured in the 1992 preliminary daytime paes (morning versus afternoon; n‰30 ﬁsh) to increase sample size. fish collected in night paes were larger than those captured in day paes in both years. in 1992, ﬁsh captured at night were on average 2.7 mm larger (mean‰50.5 mm tl, n‰ 159) than those captured in the day (mean‰47.8 mm tl, n‰71; p,0.03). in 1993, ﬁsh captured at night were on average 5.1 mm larger (mean‰51.4 mm tl, n‰108) than those captured in the day (mean‰46.3 mm tl, n‰22; p,0.03). slope (range‰15–53.3%) was in 1992, total cover was greater (student’s t-test; p,0.01; fig. 1) in four high-cover sites (mean‰ 31.5%; se‰2.42; range‰25–55%) than four low cover sites (mean‰11.2%; se‰2.67; range‰0– (range‰12.0–18.5%) and 15%). percent gravel similar between treatments in 1992 (student’s t-test; p.0.42; fig. 1). similar results were obtained in 1993 and high- cover sites (mean‰37.7%; se‰6.13) had more total cover than low cover sites (mean‰3.3%; se‰ 1.18; student’s t-test; p,0.02; fig. 1). slope (range‰13–23%) and gravel (range‰2.5–56.7%) did not differ between treatments in 1993 (stu- dent’s t-test; p.0.42; fig. 1). the difference (d¯) in mean cpue in night versus day was compared for the two levels of cover (high, low) using a paired t- test (a‰0.05). cover inﬂuenced diel patterns in catch of age-0 largemouth bass. in both years, cpue differed between night and day in sites with low cover (1992 d¯‰10.0, se‰2.1, p,0.02; 1993 d¯‰6.2, se‰1.9, p,0.04). in contrast, cpue was not different from zero between night and day in sites with high cover (1992 d¯‰5.7, se‰2.0, p‰ 0.06; 1993 d¯‰3.0, se‰3.0, p‰0.39). discussion our results indicate that age-0 largemouth bass, in general, exhibited diel onshore-offshore move- ments utilizing shallow, nearshore water in the littoral zone at night. although we sampled multiple habitat types and applied equal effort between night and day, less than 20% of ﬁsh we captured in the study were captured in the day. in addition, habitat mediated degree of move- ment; whereas, in the presence of cover, age-0 largemouth bass exhibited less movement. these ﬁndings may explain the presence of some age- 232 0 largemouth bass in nearshore areas during day. another related phenomenon was that we cap- tured smaller ﬁsh in the daytime, indicating that smaller ﬁsh were less likely to exhibit movement behavior. although ﬁsh captured at night were only an average of 3.9 mm longer than ﬁsh cap- tured in daytime, the size comparison included individuals captured in all habitats. unfortu- nately, sample sizes of ﬁsh captured in daytime paes set in cover-poor sites (i.e., 1992 n‰4; 1993 n‰1) were too small to analyze habitat-speciﬁc diel in length frequency. future work should address the speciﬁc inﬂuence of habitat (e.g., amount of cover) on size related move- ments. shifts nursery habitat has been deﬁned as a combi- nation of areas used for foraging and resting, and availability of both habitat types may regulate fac- tors that inﬂuence recruitment (aggus & elliot 1975; walters & juanes 1993; irwin et al. 1997). offshore migrations have been related to foraging; whereas, onshore migrations are related to pred- ator avoidance behaviors (helfman 1993; sempes- ki & gaudin 1995). we did not characterize forag- ing habitats in this study, and the exact offshore location of age-0 largemouth bass during daylight hours in turbid, cover-poor jordan lake is not known. however, jackson & noble (1995) and phillips et al. readily collected age-0 largemouth bass during day in small seines at depths less than 1.5 m until ﬁsh were able to avoid the nets (mean•60 mm tl). therefore, although we believe the majority of age-0 largemouth bass migrate out of shallow shoreline areas, they likely remain associated with littoral habitats in the study system. bluegill, lepomis macrochirus, are important piscine prey for age-0 largemouth bass and they also migrate offshore during daylight hours (baumann & kitchell 1974; irwin & noble, unpublished data). (1997) cover inﬂuenced the degree of movement of age- 0 largemouth bass in jordan lake. onshore-off- shore movement decreased with increased cover. aparicio & de sostoa (1999) reported reduced movement of barbus haasi with increased cover in a small mediterranean stream (spain). other be- haviors of ﬁsh (e.g., depth selection or reactive dis- tance) can be inﬂuenced by amounts of cover (sale 1968; grant & noakes 1987). in the absence of vegetative cover, turbidity may provide cover for ﬁsh in reservoirs (hayes et al. 1992). in addition, low light or shady areas may be utilized as cover. dibble (1993) reported a negative relationship be- tween age-0 largemouth bass and light intensity in habitat patches in a clear arkansas reservoir. the exact inﬂuence of these two parameters on move- ment patterns of age-0 largemouth bass in jordan lake is not known, yet low light intensities and turbidity likely simulate cover. of inﬂuence temperature can also affect the distribution of littoral ﬁshes (hall & werner 1977). temperature may age-0 largemouth bass in jordan lake, however we did observe some age-0 largemouth bass in shallow (,10 cm deep), very warm (30(cid:190)c) nearshore habi- tats during day. distribution diel tree roots, water level ﬂuctuations affect habitat, especially amounts of cover (beauchamp et al. 1994). results from a concurrent study (irwin & noble 1996) in- dicate that drawdown (i.e., decrease in water level) affected availability and complexity of speciﬁc habitat types for age-0 largemouth bass. in little beaver creek embayment, a 0.5 m decrease in water level signiﬁcantly decreased available cover (e.g., grass hummocks, inundated shrubs), leading to a low proportion of age-0 largemouth bass associating with cover (irwin & noble 1996). when cover is limited, intraspeciﬁc interactions (e.g., competition for food and canni- balism) may increase. if changes in movement be- havior occur with decreasing amounts of cover, mortality from predation may increase. drawdown of reservoirs as a management tool to force prey ﬁshes from their cover and concentrate prey for predators is based on this concept (ploskey 1986). predation pressure on age-0 largemouth bass has not been quantiﬁed in jordan lake, but inshore movements to shallow water refuge in response to predators is well documented (see mittlebach & chesson, 1987 for review). cope & jurajda (1993) described a system where small riverine ﬁshes mi- grated from steep rocky shelf habitats (day) to ad- jacent shallow sandy habitats at night in response to predation pressure. other studies report similar results, and all implicate predation as the causal factor for inshore migration (hanych et al. 1983; sempeski & gaudin 1995). an alternative hypo- thesis explaining offshore movements by age-0 largemouth bass may be avian predator avoidance. great blue herons, ardia herodia, were observed in the study embayment and these birds can impact populations of small ﬁsh (britton & moser 1982). smaller age-0 largemouth bass in jordan lake may be less vulnerable to avian predators and more vul- nerable to piscine predators explaining the occur- rence of smaller ﬁsh in daytime samples. power (1987) hypothesized that this phenomenon dic- tated the distribution of small grazing ﬁshes in panama and oklahoma (usa) stream systems. although predator-prey interactions are poorly understood in reservoirs (noble 1986), the shift to piscivory in largemouth bass occurs at smaller sizes when habitat complexity, as measured by per- cent cover, allows efﬁcient foraging (bettoli et al. diel distribution of age-0 largemouth bass 1992). complexity of habitat is also related to predator avoidance (miranda & hubbard 1994) and intermediate levels of complexity potentially increase survival of juvenile ﬁshes (crowder & cooper 1979). in general, jordan lake littoral habitats are characterized by low amounts of cover; consequently, increasing cover in the littoral zone may provide a better foraging arena while providing protection from predation. shoreline en- hancement programs, in conjunction with experi- ments to monitor movements and effects on sur- vival and growth, are needed. although we did not monitor the diel move- ments of individual ﬁsh, our data, along with evi- dence that age-0 largemouth bass exhibit strong site ﬁdelity (copeland & noble 1994), imply that age-0 largemouth bass migrate to and from the same foraging and resting habitats daily. cover and degree of predation pressure likely mediate movement, which appears to be size-speciﬁc. again, the smallest age-0 largemouth bass in our study remained inshore during day. quantiﬁcation of diel habitat shifts is needed for other ﬁshes to better understand species interac- tions at the community level. prepositioned area electroﬁshers were a discrete, quantitative method for assessing diel movement patterns of age-0 largemouth bass in speciﬁc habitats and have since been used in other systems to conduct similar ex- periments (costley 1998). knowledge of daily movement of ﬁshes will increase our ability to monitor populations through modiﬁcation of as- sessment techniques. for example, although some studies suggest that night electroﬁshing for black basses is more effective (paragamian 1989; jack- son & noble 1995); gear efﬁciency may be related to size of individual ﬁsh and speciﬁc diel behavior patterns. dumont & dennis (1997) captured fewer largemouth bass ,200 mm in nighttime versus daytime electroﬁshing samples with a boom- mounted electroﬁshing boat. these ﬁndings are ex- pected based on our results indicating nighttime movement by age-0 largemouth bass to shallow, shoreline areas. although dumont & dennis (1997) report sampling shoreline habitats, use of a boom-mounted electroﬁshing boat limits sampling shallow, nearshore habitats. our age-0 largemouth bass movement data in combination with woodward’s (1996) data on diel movements of adults and sub-adult individuals ac- centuate the need to incorporate ﬁsh ecology and behavior into assessment and management re- gimes. in addition, largemouth bass management could be greatly enhanced by a better understand- ing of how juxtaposition and amounts of foraging and resting habitat may inﬂuence aspects of popu- lation dynamics. 233 irwin & noble resumen 1. en el mes agosto de los an˜os 1992 y 1993, evaluamos diferen- cias circadianas en la distribucio´n de individuos de edad 0 de micropterus salmoides, utilizando un pescador electrico de a´ rea pre-posicionada (paes, 10(cid:192)1.5 m), en un disen˜o de mues- treo emparejado. estos paes fueron posicionados en paralelo a la orilla de una bahı´a sin vegetacio´n del embalse b. e. jordan (north carolina, usa). 2. en los dos an˜os estudiados, las capturas por unidad de es- fuerzo (cpue‰peces/pae) fueron signiﬁcativamente mayores por la noche que por el dı´a, indicando que estos juveniles hacen movimientos nocturnos hacia la orilla. los juveniles captura- dos en la orilla durante el dı´a fueron mas pequen˜os que los capturados por la noche, indicando tambien que los patrones de movimientos pueden cambiar a lo largo de la ontogenia. los movimientos de estos juveniles hacia y desde la orilla se reduje- ron signiﬁcativamente en presencia de cubierta vegetal, lo que sugiere que los movimientos circadianos pueden estar inﬂuen- ciados por componentes especı´ﬁcos del habitat. 3. probablemente, los movimientos circadianos este´n relaciona- dos con el forrageo, el descanso, o con comportamientos de rechazo a la predacio´n y, por ello, puedan afectar a la dina´mica de la poblacio´n e introducir errores en programas de evalua- cio´n. acknowledgments this research was supported by a federal aid
