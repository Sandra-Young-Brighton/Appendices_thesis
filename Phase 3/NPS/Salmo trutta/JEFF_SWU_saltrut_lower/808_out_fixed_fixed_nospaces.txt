(yaragina et al. 2009), perch (perca fluviatilis l.) (persson et al. 2000), pike (esox lucius l.) (craig 2008), (osmerus mordax mitchill) (shaw & curry 2011), lake_trout (salvelinus namay- cush walbaum) and arctic char [salvelinus_alpinus (l.)] (finstad & berg 2004). predator-prey interactions rainbow smelt correspondence: ole k. berg, department of biology, norwegian university of science and technology (ntnu), 7491 trondheim, norway. e-mail: ole.berg@bio.ntnu.no *present address: veterinary institute, tungasletta 2, 7485, trondheim, norway doi: 10.1111/eff.12202 203 florø-larsen et al. are frequently size-dependent, especially in fishes who ingest their prey whole (vucic-pestic et al. 2010). in char, observed prey body length is typically lim- ited up to around 40% of cannibal length (often called the predation window), whereas larger potential prey usually escapes (bystr€om 2006; finstad et al. 2006). is arctic char often form polymorphic populations, with at least four distinct morphs described in, for example thingvallavatn, iceland. char polymorphism often occurs with combinations of littoral and benthic morphs (johnson 1980; smalas et al. 2013). a partic- ular arctic char dimorphic system found in both arc- tic and high altitude lakes and ponds, the occurrence of dwarf char, where females and males reproduce at body length well below 150 mm. dwarfs remain small due to restricted feeding oppor- tunities in nutrient poor lakes, where often (small) chironomidae are the only aquatic insects available (e.g. bystr€om 2006; finstad et al. 2006; berg et al. 2010). once the dwarfs attain sexual maturity, they invest most of their energy surplus into gonads so their body growth is halted (e.g. finstad et al. 2006) the accumulated stock of small-sized dwarfs gives the feed for the second morph in these lakes, the can- nibal char, which can grow to large length on nutrient rich, dwarf chars. the transition into a cannibal is a specific challenge where the cannibalistic char have to outgrow the dwarfs in their common environment. by sacrificing sexual maturation and stored fat resources, the cannibals can attain the minimum length for positive energy gain as a cannibal. the energy intake for cannibals has been modelled to fol- low a hump-shaped curve with increasingly positive energy gain with increasing size above 230 mm (finstad et al. 2006). the dwarf-cannibal morphs in high altitude or polar lakes and ponds are so frequent that they have been called bimodal populations (fins- tad & berg 2004). the governing mechanism underpinning each indi- vidual’s life history and thus shaping the population structure is not known, but it may lie anywhere on a spectrum between complete genetic determination and environmentally, randomly induced phenotypic variation (hindar et al.1986; gislason et al. 1999; woods et al. 2013) or internal population dynamic cycles (bystr€om 2006; svanb€ack et al. 2009; roos & persson 2013). a high degree of genetic determina- tion in life history choice is suggested by some authors, but the evidence is still inconclusive (gisla- son et al. 1999; janhunen et al. 2010; sinnatamby et al. 2013). the purpose of this study was to determine length at hatching and early growth for dwarf and cannibal char from different locations to test whether different morphs of char have similar life history as young. materials and methods sampling arctic char were sampled from 11 locations in alpine areas in central norway (63.5°n, 12.5°e) (altitude 1000 m) in 1997 and 1998, and on the arctic bear island (74.5°n, 19.0°e) in 2002 and 2009 (fig. 1). the locations were chosen because two arctic char morphs typically occur in these locations, dwarfs and cannibals, but also char of intermediate sizes were 204 fig. 1. samples of dwarf and cannibal char originate from nine different lakes on bear island (arctic sea) and mid-norway mountain area (two lakes). present (finstad & berg 2004; berg et al. 2010). char were the only fish species (allopatric) occurring in the investigated locations and in all the sampled locations both morphs were found. the sampling locations were relatively shallow, clear-water lakes or ponds with an ice-free season restricted to only about 4–5 months. there was no higher vegetation visible in any of the investigated lakes. from the initial material (n = 1554), we selected specimens that could be assigned to either the dwarf or cannibal life history group based on maturation stage and size. sexually mature individuals with body lengths <15 cm were assigned as dwarfs, and imma- ture and mature individuals with body length >20 cm were assigned as cannibals. fish between 15 and 20 cm, and immature char <15 cm were excluded due to uncertainty in life history choice. only indi- viduals with clear and readable otoliths were included in the study (see below). the material for the final analyses consisted of 457 char, where 304 were assigned as dwarfs and 153 as cannibals (table 1). there was only one maturing fish in the length inter- val 15–20 cm in the original material; this was an about 14-year-old female which was 18 cm long, so this is an insignificant group in the investigated lakes and ponds; and this corresponds well with the bimo- dal population theory (e.g. finstad & berg 2004). fish were captured using gill nets and electric fish- ing gear (table 1). due to restricted movement, dwarfs have low catchability on gill nets (finstad & berg 2004; berg et al. 2010), and a large proportion of the dwarf char were therefore captured with elec- tric fishing gear (backpack, pulsed maximum voltage output 650 v) between rocks in the wave-washed upper metre of the littoral zone. in some localities, all char were sampled with gill nets. for the capture of dimorphic arctic char cannibals, a slightly modified multimesh ‘nordic’ gill net series was used (30 m 9 1.5 m; appelberg et al. 1995) with mesh sizes (mm): 8, 10, 12.5, 15.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29, 35 and 45. usually 15 nets were set in each locality. both electrofishing and nets are selec- tive gears, with a higher probability of catching rap- idly growing or actively moving individuals (e.g. finstad & berg 2004), and this must be kept in mind when the results are interpreted. the captured char were processed fresh, total length (mm) and mass (g) were measured. the fish were dissected, sex and maturity determined and otoliths sampled. otolith processing otoliths were stored in dry individually paper enve- lopes. otoliths of old char, with a long rostrum (‘spear’), were stored in eppendorf tubes to avoid breaking. otoliths may not provide accurate back cal- culations of size at age if there is a decoupling between fish and otolith growth (mosegaard et al. 1988; francis 1990; schaalje et al. 2002). with minor deviation in otolith and fish size relationship due to, for example temperature effects, otoliths may still provide a valuable tool to characterise and test for differences in relative growth patterns among and within populations (finstad 2003; murdoch & power 2013; sinnatamby et al. 2013). most small char for this investigation were captured in the littoral zone, whereas gill net captures of small char were limited. this indicates that the bulk of small char were living in the littoral zone, where rocks provided protection from the cannibals but also some cannibals were caught in the same littoral areas in summertime. it should be noted, however, that sinnatamby et al. (2013) reported differences in dwarf/cannibal ratio table 1. number of fish sampled with different sampling methods for different groups (dwarf of cannibals), different localities and different sampling gear (electrofishing, el or gill nets). for cannibals and dwarfs, the number (n) and mean hatching ring size (sd) in lm are given for the different localities. name of localities sampled: location no. 1–11 is from bear island and no.12–13 is from sylane in central norway (fig. 1). two localities (trestikkelen and spælvatnet) were repeatedly sampled in 2002 and 2009. total catch cannibals dwarfs loc.nr. locality el. fishing gill net fishing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 trestikkelen 2002 spælvatnet 2002 trestikkelen 2009 spælvatnet 2009 lygna 2009 nordre steinsjø 2009 søndre steinsjø 2009 torstjønna 2009 stevatnet 2009 dam 7 2009 dam x 2009 store skardørsjø 1998 øvre skardørsjø 1997 16 0 0 60 39 29 30 35 49 32 36 0 0 39 43 77 30 70 47 15 26 34 0 0 49 21 n 23 11 9 15 25 8 1 12 27 1 1 12 8 mean (lm) 185 (17) 198 (14) 197 (33) 180 (20) 179 (26) 191 (21) 197 188 (22) 182 (28) 162 213 196 (24) 205 (12) n 30 32 7 48 19 43 16 8 31 16 8 37 9 mean (lm) 162 (22) 162 (19) 144 (29) 171 (19) 176 (24) 169 (25) 182 (13) 167 (18) 167 (18) 142 (23) 154 (23) 173 (22) 184 (22) 205 florø-larsen et al. among young char recaptured along different creek/ littoral sites in lake hazen, canada, which may indi- cate a possible difference in habitat use between young dwarfs and cannibals. otolith size measure- ments (distance in lm from the centre of the otolith to each consecutive growth zones as well as the size of the hatch ring; fig. 2) were performed with a microscope (leica mz16-a) with an integrated cam- era (dfc 420 leica systems). otoliths were read in a black dish to enhance contrast, and size consecutive growth zones measured on digital pictures (leica application suite version 3.2.0; leica microsystems, heerbrugg, switzerland). relative annual historical size of each individual was interpreted as the size of the otolith at each annual growth zone (see fig. 2; bagenal & tesch 1978). the central zone in the otolith is the hatching zone of the individual (fig. 2). the width of the hatching zone was used uncorrected to compare fry length of cannibals and dwarfs at hatching (radke et al. 1989). one year growth was defined as the length from the start of the winter zone (opaque zones) to the start of next winter zone. otolith egg size relationship a significant relationship between egg size and the size of hatching ring in the otolith is commonly assumed (e.g. bell et al. 1995; lord et al. 2010). however, any empirical test of this is lacking. we therefore conducted an additional investigation to fig. 2. picture of arctic char otolith with transect for otolith mea- surements included. pictures of an otolith from arctic char sam- pled from stevatnet on bear island with total length 477 mm, mass 868 g and age determined to 14+ winters. hatching ring (hr) is indicated. 206 ascertain the relationship between egg size and hatch- ing ring. arctic char were not available, and we instead used hatchery reared brown_trout (salmo tru- tta l.) originating from the norwegian genebank facility herje hatchery. a basic otolith structure like hatching ring is probably quite similar for different salmonid species, and as char were unavailable for the experiments, we therefore suggest that the rela- tionship between otolith and fish size can be similar for near-related species such as brown_trout and arc- tic char. families (offspring of a specific female) of brown_trout were reared in separate units. egg diame- ter (mean size of 15 eggs) was measured for 14 fami- lies. after hatching, but just before first exogenous feeding, otoliths of alevins of the same 14 families were collected and measured by the same methods as described above. there was a significant positive relationship (p < 0.05, r = 0.68) between egg size and size of hatching ring. statistical analysis we tested for early life history growth variation using otolith radius at a given age as proxy for size. two sets of analyses were run, firstly for the whole mate- rial, and secondly, for back calculated age classes younger than first recorded maturation (<5 years). as a proxy model for growth variation in early life his- tory, we modelled otolith radius at each age as dependent variable, age as covariate and life history (cannibals or dwarf classification) as factor. we used a linear mixed effect model using the lme function within the nlme package (pinheiro et al. 2013) from the statistical software r, v.2.11.1. (anon. 2009). individuals nested within lake were used as a random factor. otolith radius and age were log transformed initially, visual screening of before the analyses. residuals indicated that there still was nonlinearity present in the response, and age was therefore entered as a second order polynomial. to test for difference between cannibals and dwarfs, otolith size at hatching was compared using lake as random variable. incor- poration of variables in the full model was tested by sequential removal and comparing the aic differ- ences between alternative models to infer which one was best in describing the data. results char classified as dwarfs had a mean total length (sd) of 105  21 mm whereas that of cannibals was 38  77 mm. individuals classified as dwarfs had significantly (p < 0.001) smaller otoliths at the time of hatching than individuals classified as canni- bals size otolith (lm  sd) 168.6  22.00 (table 2). mean hatching for dwarfs was table 2. summary of mixed effect model explaining otolith size at hatching as function of cannibal/dwarf group, with lake included as a random factor. estimated parameters for random effects are the sd of random intercepts in the models, with sd of residual variation given in brackets. parameter  se t-value p-value random effects individual within lake fixed effects intercept cannibal 4.425 168.72 19.25 (22.27) 1.90 2.30 88.60  8.36 <0.000 <0.000 for and cannibals 187.1  23.6 (n = 304) (n = 153). the growth pattern throughout ontogeny also differed between individuals assigned as canni- bals or dwarfs (fig. 3, table 3a). this is indicated by the significant (p < 0.001) interaction between age and dwarf/cannibal group categorical variable (table 3). however, there were only minor differ- ences in otolith size between cannibals and dwarfs during the first (three) years (fig 4) in spite of the initial difference in size of hatching ring. growth differentiation appeared to increase at the point of which the dwarfs approached maturation (minimum 2–3 years of age), after which cannibals apparently grew much faster. discussion several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the initiation of different life histories and population ) m u ( e z i s h t i l t o o 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 (a) 0 (b) 0 5 10 15 20 25 10 5 20 otolith age (years) 15 25 fig. 3. relationship between mean age specific body size for each location (mm  sd) and otolith size for individuals charac- terised as (a) cannibalistic and (b) dwarfs. dimorphic arctic char regulation of the dwarf and cannibal polymorphism in arctic char: first hypothesis is that recruitment pulses influence the nutrition availability to cannibals and competition for food varies in high- and low- recruitment pulses. higher food availability increases the fraction of cannibals within a locality (bystr€om 2006). if this hypothesis is to be supported, variation in growth conditions should be expected to occur between years and localities. second hypothesis is that all individuals have the potential to be cannibal- istic and where environmental conditions connected with biotic parameters such as density or alternate preys determine the life history (dwarf/cannibalistic) strategy (svenning & borgstrøm 2005). third hypothesis is that cannibals delay maturation, giving the future cannibal the possibility to grow through the ‘size bottleneck’ and be cannibalistic (finstad et al. 2006). fourth hypothesis is that a bimodal dis- tribution within a specific year-class is frequently demonstrated in salmonid fishes (thorpe 1977; budy & luecke 2014). final hypothesis is that genetic dif- ferences determine either dwarf or cannibal strategy (skulason et al. 1996; power et al. 2009). the last hypothesis can be combined with any of the previous three in form of genetic 9 environment interactions. the dwarf and cannibal otolith size difference at hatching and the similarity of body growth during the table 3. summary of best mixed effect model explaining otolith size as a function of age and cannibal/dwarf group, as well as a quadratic term for age.

(2013) distinguished between yoy arctic char offspring from arctic lake hazen, canada, based on stable isotopes as the trophic level of the mother dwarf and cannibal char is different. they could determine the maternal origin for yoy with 56 offspring from nonpiscivorous (dwarf char) and 32 from piscivorous. the two yoy groups were identical in length (31.0 mm). this is thus a possible method to investigate life history of dwarfs and can- nibals in sympatry. our results indicate that maternal size is a factor determining offspring size (hatching size). as canni- bals attain a considerably larger adult size than dwarfs, we can therefore speculate that cannibals are more likely to be offspring of cannibals. the canni- bals in the present investigation were larger during the young stages, contrary to what was reported by sinnatamby et al. (2013) from lake hazen, northern canada. this may indicate genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation of morphs (skulason et al. 1996; power et al. 2009). maternal effects on egg size and resulting life history variation may also be a factor initiating genetic differentiation, eventually through mating preferences through prezygotic barri- ers by mate choice (power et al. 2009). sympatric speciation has been rendered possible for a number of species, especially salmonids such as char and whitefish (coregonus_lavaretus l.) (thomassen et al. 2011; gowell et al. 2012; praebel et al. 2013), and parallel divergence of forms diverging in body size should therefore be probable (fraser et al. 2008; woods et al. 2013). furthermore, recent investiga- tions show that piscivorous char are more efficient as a cannibal than as an interspecific predator and that this may mediate coexistence of dwarf and cannibal morphs in intraguild predation systems (bystr€om et al. 2013; roos & persson 2013). the unequal dis- tribution of dwarf and cannibal offspring along the shore and creeks in lake hazen, ellesmere island, northern canada, is suggesting for the evolution of trophic specialists within a single population based on assortative mating (sinnatamby et al. 2013). based on these novel studies, there is an increasing amount of knowledge supporting genetic differentia- tion and assortative mating as important mechanisms behind the dwarf/cannibal system in arctic char. the dwarf-cannibal system in arctic char occurs in barren environments where growth conditions for the young char are restricted by both temperature and food availability (finstad et al. 2006; berg et al. 2010). these systems harbour an apparent abundance of large sized char, easy to exploit (e.g. finstad & berg 2004; berg et al. 2010). if genetic factors fully or partially are determining the dwarf-cannibal sys- tem, the effects of exploitation of large sized cannibals of char in arctic or high mountain areas will have a significant impact on the populations structure, com- pared to systems with more complicated environmen- tal or population dynamic control mechanisms. acknowledgements we thank the staff at bjørnøya meterological station, at the norwegian coast guard, at the norwegian genebank facility herje, and the museum,
