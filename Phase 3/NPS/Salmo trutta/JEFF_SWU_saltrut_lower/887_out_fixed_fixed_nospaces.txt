however, slimy sculpins are also a common benthic species in deep lakes. in streams, sculpins are considered to be a relatively inactive species, moving only small distances, and characteristically have high levels of genetic structure. we examined population genetic structure of slimy sculpin (cottus cognatus) across multiple barriers and over distances up to 227 km in lake champlain (usa, canada) and lake ontario (usa, canada) to determine whether lake populations of sculpin are also highly struc- tured. we predicted that slimy sculpin populations in lake champlain would be struc- tured by six causeways as well as by distance, lake ontario populations would be structured only by distance, and differences between the lakes would be large relative to within- lake differences. we examined microsatellite variation among 200 slimy sculpins from lake champlain and 48 slimy sculpins from lake ontario to evaluate patterns of population connectivity and structure. there was no indication of popula- tion substructuring within either lake but sculpin were genetically distinct between lakes. we conclude that there is a single, panmictic population of sculpin present in lake champlain and another potentially panmictic population in lake ontario, with no indication of genetic isolation by distance. our results contrast with data from sculpin in streams, suggesting distance and habitat fragmentation exert little influence on population connectivity of benthic fish in lakes. k e y w o r d s barriers, gene flow, genetics, habitat fragmentation, microsatellites 1 |  introduction patterns of genetic variation across a species’ range generally result from historic, extrinsic factors such as physical isolation due to glaci- ation or changes in climate (hewitt, 1996; petit et al., 2003), whereas genetic structure of populations across smaller spatial scales are often the result of contemporary environmental conditions like hab- itat availability or fragmentation. among freshwater aquatic habitats, lotic waters are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic change (e.g., channelising, siltation, dewatering) and fragmentation (e.g., construc- tion of dams, weirs and roads with poorly placed culverts; dynesius & nilsson, 1994; ligon, dietrich, & trush, 1995; graf, 1999; templeton, shaw, routman, & davis, 1990). the combination of the naturally complex structure of lotic systems with high amounts of anthropo- genic disturbance often leads to high levels of population isolation and genetic structure of species living in streams and rivers (e.g., bessert & orti, 2008; gouskov & vorburger, 2016). in contrast, large lentic systems often have less habitat complexity, especially offshore lake regions, and little habitat fragmentation. understanding how envi- ronmental heterogeneity in lakes may influence population genetic structure is nonetheless central to understanding recent evolutionary change and species’ vulnerability to anthropogenic alterations. ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:699–709. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  699 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd 700  |     determining relationships between environmental and genetic variation is particularly important for fish species that inhabit both len- tic and lotic habitats, despite differences in flow, habitat complexity, connectivity and habitat predictability (ryder & pesendorfer, 1989). lentic and lotic populations of the same fish species can differ in dis- persal and genetic structure and are often genetically distinct from one another. for example, home ranges of 21 fish species in lakes were found to be 19–23 times larger than 25 fish species in rivers by minns (1995), indicating movement patterns differ between lotic and lentic habitats. additionally, patterns of genetic differentiation have been found between lentic and lotic populations of sticklebacks and cyprinids (collin & fumagalli, 2011; mckinnon & rundle, 2002). sculpins (cottidae) are widely distributed in lakes and streams, but little is known about their genetic structure in lentic systems. based primarily on lotic research, sculpin are generally considered to be sed- entary and disperse only short distances. for example, mottled sculpins (cottus bairdi) in a small tributary in north carolina showed patterns of genetic isolation by distance across 5.6 km, and the estimated migra- tion rates between sites separated by <300 m were small (lamphere & blum, 2012). mottled sculpin sampled in tributaries of eastern lake michigan also showed strong patterns of genetic structure even across short distances (homola, ruetz, kohler, & thum, 2016). assessment of sculpin behaviour and ecology also suggests that sculpin do not move long distances. mottled sculpin implanted with pit tags had a maximum displacement distance from the tagging location of about 511 m over 1 year, and more than 74% of individuals moved <100 m from where they were tagged during a 1- year study (breen, ruetz, thompson, & kohler, 2009). similarly, slimy sculpins (cottus cognatus) in little river, new brunswick, had detectable differences in stable isotope composition among sites separated by <10 km, suggesting slimy sculpin have small home ranges (gray, cunjak, & munkittrick, 2004). otolith microchemistry of slimy sculpin also indicated that in- dividuals generally move <10 km from their natal location throughout their lifetime (clarke, telmer, & shrimpton, 2015). few studies, how- ever, have examined sculpin movement or genetic structure in lentic systems. behavioural studies of slimy sculpin in lakes are challenging because they prefer depths >25 m and cold water (<15°c; otto & rice, 1977; brandt, 1986). lakes generally have lower habitat complexity and have few or no barriers akin to dams to limit dispersal, and thus, we predict that population connectivity and genetic structure of scul- pin may be different in lakes than in streams. to better understand sculpin ecology and population connectivity in lentic systems, we examined the genetic structure of slimy sculpins in two large lakes. lake champlain served as our focal system. lake champlain is a partially fragmented lake divided into three basins by causeways that may restrict slimy sculpin dispersal, providing a lentic equivalent to a fragmented lotic system (marsden & langdon, 2012). we also examined two slimy sculpin populations from lake ontario as an out- group to assess consistency of trends in population structure among lakes, and between lake and stream populations. the two lakes have a similar fish community and trophic status, but lake ontario is much larger than lake champlain (longest axis is 311 km relative to 193 km in lake champlain), lacks habitat fragmentation, and due to its size is more likely to have higher isolation by distance among fish populations. the two lakes have been isolated for approximately 10,000 years, providing a context for genetic differences resulting from isolation. examining sculpin in lake champlain and lake ontario allowed us to assess potential genetic differences resulting from isola- tion between lakes, isolation by distance within lakes and isolation by fragmentation in two systems with similar environments. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study sites lake champlain is a long (193 km) and narrow (20 km at the widest point) lake spanning the border of new york and vermont, usa, and quebec, canada. the portion of the lake with deep water suitable for slimy sculpin is approximately 110 km long. the lake has a maxi- mum depth of 122 m and an average depth of 19.5 m. three large islands naturally divide the northern portion of lake champlain into eastern and western arms (figure 1). the construction of six cause- ways built between 1850 and 1900 has linked the islands to the mainland and have isolated the lake further into three major basins: the main lake, malletts bay and the inland sea (figure 1; marsden & langdon, 2012). all the causeways have at least one shallow (1–7 m figure 1 sample sites indicated by open crossed dots for slimy sculpin in lake champlain and lake ontario (inset map), and location of nine causeways (red bars) hypothesised to pose barriers to fish movement euclide et al.    |  701 deep) opening that allows some flow of water and passage of boats and fish; carry bay and the island line causeways each have an ad- ditional non- navigable opening. lake ontario is 311 km long, with a maximum depth of 244 m; apart from a series of islands in the north- eastern portion (bay of quinte), the lake lacks physical isolat- ing structures. slimy sculpin prefer water temperatures <10°c and rarely inhabit temperatures >15°c; to assess whether causeways would be expected to act as a substantial barrier to sculpin, we measured seasonal changes in water temperature in causeway openings. hobo® temperature probes were placed on the bottom of all causeways openings except the north western opening to carry bay (figure 1). temperature was recorded at openings once per hour for 12 months. slimy sculpin are generally only found in water >25 m deep; therefore, depth profiles of all but the island line causeway (figure 1) openings were measured using a weighted line from a small boat and depth of the remaining two island line causeway openings was estimated using chart data. 2.2 | fish sampling and genetic analysis two hundred slimy sculpin were sampled during august and september 2014 and may, june and july 2015 using benthic trawls at seven sites throughout lake champlain (figure 1). forty- eight slimy sculpin were sampled in october 2016 from two locations approximately 230 km apart in lake ontario, ny, one near fairhaven, new york (43°29.231′n, −76°38.053′w), and one near hamilton, ontario (43°20.462′n, 79°27.736′w). individuals were euthanised by cooling directly on ice, measured to the nearest millimetre (total length), and caudal fins were collected following protocols outlined in lahood, miller, apland & ford (2008) or frozen. dna was extracted from fin clips using standard procedures from a dneasy blood and tissue kit (qiagen). the concentration of dna template was verified on a nanodrop and ranged from 6–100 ng/μl of dna, though most samples contained between 30 and 50 ng/μl. following extraction, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) am- plification was conducted for 10 microsatellite loci previously identi- fied for sculpin (table 1). markers were multiplexed when possible in 25 μl reactions using 2x q5 high fidelity dna polymerase master mix (new england biolabs inc.), and 20 pmol of a fluorescently la- belled forward primer and unlabelled reverse primer, and 6–100 ng of the dna template. the general pcr program used was 98°c for 2 min, 30 cycles at 98°c for 30 s at marker- specific annealing tem- perature (table 1), 72°c for 45 s, followed by a final extension of 72°c for 10 min. fragment analysis of pcr products was conducted in the university of vermont advanced genome technologies core using an applied biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer and a rox 500 size standard and scored using genemapper software (applied biosystems). table 1 characteristics of 10 microsatellites amplified in slimy sculpin. shown are the genbank marker name, repeat motif, forward and reverse primer sequence, fluorophore tail, amplified size range, annealing temperature (ta) and citation for the source of the marker marker primer (5′–3′) repeat dye size range source cco02 cco08 cco13 cco17 cco11 tri tri tri tri di cco14 tetra cott105 cott128 cott113 cott213 di di di di ta 59 f: ttcttgttctccgtcttgagc hex 227—254 r: cccatcttctcctcctgtcc f: ttgcaaacttcagacagtaaagc r: gctgagaatccaggaaggag f: cctggaatttcaccaaggtc r: tcacaacaaagccagaggac f: tcgtcttggaaatggaaagc r: catgtcagcaggatatcacgtc f: gcaggaggaacacgaagatg r: ctcaaggaactacacacacatgc f: cataaaacctgtggctttgg r: gacgctctgctggagagatg f: tcctacagggtgcgatcgtg r: tgcaggagtcaggactctgc f: tctgtgggtgtttggtcgtg r: tgaactctgcacatgactgc f: agcgccagaatgcagcatcc r: agtgtggcgagcccaagatc f: ttgccatggatttgaggcag r: agcattgctattatcaggctgc fam ned hex ned hex fam hex fam ned 87–111 221–248 69–142 198–230 na 322–346 314–350 132–142 331–333 55 55 55 60 60 60 60 60 60 fujishin, barker, huff, and miller (2009) fujishin et al.

however, we expected the fst between sites in lake ontario to be similar to fst between the two furthest sites in lake champlain if the effect of isolation by distance is similar in both lakes. to further examine how slimy sculpin populations were struc- tured among and within lakes, discriminate analysis of principle com- ponents (dapcs) and bayesian structure analysis were used to table 2 site- specific summary statistics of slimy sculpin genotypes taken from nine microsatellite loci grouped by lake, basin and site site lake champlain main lake grand isle sunset isle shelburne bay barber pt. inland sea inland sea n. inland sea s. malletts bay malletts bay lake ontario fairhaven hamilton n na ho he ne npa ar 30 30 30 30 31 31 18 24 24 6.9 6.7 7.2 7.2 7.4 7.1 6.1 6.1 5.8 0.651 0.628 0.618 0.609 0.640 0.562 0.601 0.600 0.593 0.612 0.631 0.595 223.1 ∞ ∞ ∞ 139.4 433.1 0.617 0.586 226.3 0.534 0.486 0.509 0.480 101.5 140.1 1 3 2 4 5 4 1 3 4 5.79 5.59 5.94 5.86 6.17 5.81 5.92 5.40 5.09 n, number of individuals genotyped;

jombart, devillard, & balloux, 2010; pritchard, stephens, & donnelly, 2000). dapc is a multivariate analysis that maximises ge- netic differentiation between groups while minimising within- group variation. the relationship between sample sites was evaluated hier- archically; dapc was first run using the complete data set to visu- alise the relationship between all samples sites in lake ontario and lake champlain, then using only individuals from lake champlain. all dapcs were conducted in r version 3.3.0 using the adegenet ver- sion 2.0.1 (jombart, 2008; r core team, 2015). bayesian structure analysis was also run hierarchically, first on the total data set and sub- sequently on only lake champlain individuals. structure was run 10 times for each value of k = 1–10 with settings of 500,000 replicates and an initial burn- in of 100,000 replicates. the most likely number of clusters (k) was then assessed using ∆k estimated in structure harvester (earl & vonholdt, 2012; evanno, regnaut, & goudet, 2005) and the most likely estimates of k were consolidated into a sin- gle best estimate using clumpp (jakobsson & rosenberg, 2007). average depth of each causeway opening at mean lake level (29.1 m above sea level) varied among causeways, ranging from <1.0 m at the sandbar causeway to just over 7.0 m at the alburg passage causeway. however, even when adjusted to the maximum reported lake level of 31.6 m, the depth of all openings was <10.0 m. temperature in cause- way openings ranged from near 0.0°c january and february when sensors became frozen in ice to 22–25°c during july and august. for causeway openings with at least 365 days of available temperature data (n = 4), temperature was above the adult sculpin avoidance tem- perature of 15°c for 37 ± 2% of the year and above the preferred temperature of 9°c for 53 ± 3% of the year (otto & rice, 1977). 1 0 0 0 . 5 1 1 0 . 1 4 1 0 . * 3 |  results 3.1 | habitat suitability .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  7 1 0 0 ± 0 1 9 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  7 5 0 0 ± 9 8 1 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  9 2 0 0 ± 0 1 9 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 2 0 0 ± 5 5 9 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  4 2 0 0 ± 7 4 8 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  0 0 0 ± 0 0 0  . .  9 3 0 0 ± 4 9 6 0  . * 4 0 0 0 − . * .  7 4 0 0 ± 3 2 4 0  . 5 6 0 0 . 1 9 0 0 . * .  2 3 0 0 ± 2 0 8 0  . .  1 3 0 0 ± 3 5 1 0  . .  2 4 0 0 ± 2 3 5 0  . .  7 5 0 0 ± 8 8 2 0  . .  4 1 0 0 ± 4 6 9 0  . 4 0 0 0 − . 6 0 0 0 − . 6 0 1 0 . 0 3 1 0 . * .  8 3 0 0 ± 9 2 8 0  . 7 0 0 0 − . 2 0 0 0 . 1 1 0 0 − . 6 9 0 0 . 9 1 1 0 . *  e k a l n  i s e t i s o w t l m o r f d e p m a s n p u c s y m i l i l s r o f i n u q e l r a n  i l l d e t a u c a c ) l a n o g a d e h t e v o b a (  i l i  n o i t a v e d d r a d n a t s ± s e u a v - p g n d n o p s e r r o c d n a ) l a n o g a d e h t  i i w o e b l (  ,  y a b e n r u b e h s l , e l s i t e s n u s , e l s i d n a r g i  ( e k a l n a m e h t e r e w s n i s a b e e r h t e h t  . s y a w e s u a c y b r e h t o n a e n o m o r f d e t a o s i  l l i n a p m a h c e k a l n  j i s n i s a b r o a m e e r h t d n a )  n o t l i  m a h d n a n e v a h r i a f ( o i r a t n o n o t l i m a h n e v a h r i a f y a b s t t e l l a m .  s a e s d n a n i l .  n a e s d n a n i l t p r e b r a b  y a b e n r u b e h s l . s i t e s n u s . s i d n a r g y a b s t t e l l  a m d n a ) s e t i s h t u o s d n a h t r o n l  ( a e s d n a n i e h t , ) t n o p r e b r a b i  t s f e s i w r i a p   3   e l b a t .  4 5 0 0 ± 3 3 3 0  . .  4 3 0 0 ± 7 4 8 0  . .  4 2 0 0 ± 4 7 8 0  . .  8 1 0 0 ± 3 7 9 0  . .  9 0 0 0 ± 9 0 0 0  . .  0 3 0 0 ± 8 9 1 0  . .  1 4 0 0 ± 6 7 6 0  . .  3 5 0 0 ± 4 0 6 0  . 5 0 0 0 − . 0 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 0 . 9 0 0 0 − . 3 8 0 0 . 8 0 1 0 . * 3.2 | genetic data .  4 2 0 0 ± 5 4 0 0  . 3 0 0 0 − . 4 0 0 0 − . * 3 0 0 0 . 6 1 0 0 . 5 0 0 0 . 8 9 0 0 . 8 1 1 0 . 9 0 0 0 . 8 0 0 0 − . 7 0 0 0 − . 6 0 0 0 − . 1 0 0 0 . 9 0 0 0 − . 1 9 0 0 . 1 1 1 0 . *  y a b e n r u b e h s l t p r e b r a b . s i d n a r g . s i t e s n u s .  n a e s d n a n i l .  s a e s d n a n i l y a b s t t e l l a m n e v a h r i a f n o t l i m a h genetic diversity differed slightly between lakes but was consistent within lakes. locus cco14 exhibited inconsistencies in allele scoring and was therefore removed from analysis. no loci showed signs of null alleles. all loci except locus cott213 were polymorphic at all sites with 5 to 25 alleles per locus. all loci at all sites were in hwe following a sequential bonferroni correction. observed (ho) and expected (he) heterozygosity was moderate for all sites (average = 0.59 and 0.58 re- spectively;

p = .82; figure 3), indicating that populations of slimy sculpin were not isolated by distance. additionally, pairwise fst was zero between fairhaven and hamilton in lake ontario, similar to pairwise fst among sites in lake champlain. however, fairhaven and hamilton are separated by more than 220 km, about four times the maximum distance between sites in lake champlain, indicating a lack of isolation by distance in lake ontario. 4 |  discussion our findings indicate that although slimy sculpin in lake champlain and lake ontario have comparable genetic diversity to slimy and mot- tled sculpin in streams and rivers (huff, miller, & vondracek, 2010; lamphere & blum, 2012), they exhibit little to no within- lake genetic structure even across numerous barriers and distances up to 227 km (breen et al., 2009; lamphere & blum, 2012). the lack of any observed genetic structure indicates that sculpins in lake champlain and lake ontario represent single panmictic populations. the relatively large genetic differences observed between lakes ontario and champlain were expected, considering that the lakes have been isolated since the last glacial retreat approximately 10,000 years ago (rayburn, franzi, & knuepfer, 2007). although lake ontario and lake champlain remain connected by the st. lawrence river, it is unlikely this route provides enough connectivity to maintain a genetically homogeneous popula- tion; transit between the lakes would entail a 360 km downstream trip in the st. lawrence river, followed by 130 km of upstream dispersal through the richelieu river, or vice versa. low genetic structure is usually a feature of highly connected pop- ulations with high mobility and capacity for dispersal (muths, le couls, evano, grewe, & bourjea, 2013; thompson, patel, baker, constantine, & millar, 2015). however, adult slimy sculpin are not considered highly mobile. adult sculpin in streams have patchy distributions and tend to maintain home ranges of 1–5 river km (galloway et al., 2003; gray et al., 2004). however, there is little information about movement of slimy sculpin in lakes. nonetheless, the lack of any genetic structure among sculpin populations in lake champlain is particularly surprising given the fragmentation of the lake by causeways. several of our sample sites were separated by large areas of shallow habitat not usually inhabited by slimy sculpins. for example, malletts bay and sunset island are only 3 km apart, but separated by a 5- km causeway built on top of a shallow (1–3 m deep) 1- km- wide sandbar. to maintain the level of population connectivity we observed, sculpin would need to disperse across at least 1 km of unsuitable habitat. to migrate from the inland sea to the main lake, slimy sculpin must pass through at least two causeways via 2–5 km of shallow (1–10 m) water. for these deep- water fish, the depth and temperature of the causeway openings should be a substan- tial barrier to movement (otto & rice, 1977; scott & crossman, 1973). causeway openings were, however, within an acceptable temperature range for slimy sculpin (<10°c) during the early spring, late fall and win- ter (50%–70% of the year). thus, adult slimy sculpins might disperse through the openings during these times. given the moderate level of differentiation between lake champlain and lake ontario populations, it is possible that insufficient time has passed to detect the effects of isolation by causeways. although we cannot conclusively refute the hypothesis that not enough time has passed to see the effects of isola- tion, there was little evidence of genetic structure or a wahlund effect indicative of early stage isolation found in our study (wahlund, 1928). therefore, we suggest time since isolation is not the most important factor limiting population differentiation. genetic panmixia in the absence of adult movement could be the re- sult of larval dispersal. in marine systems, larval fish commonly disperse substantial distances by advection (pineda, hare, & sponaugle, 2007). in the great lakes, models of yellow perch larval drift suggest individ- uals could drift from southern to northern lake michigan, a distance of 200–300 km, before settling to the bottom (beletsky et al., 2007). deep- water sculpin myoxocephalus thompsonii larvae are known to be pelagic (geffen & nash, 1992), but slimy sculpin larvae are generally assumed to be benthic, which would limit their likelihood of dispersal (e.g., lantry et al., 2007). nevertheless, slimy sculpin larvae have been found in the water column during spring ichthyoplankton tows in lake huron (martin, czesny, & wahl, 2011; roseman & o’brien, 2013) and throughout the summer in lake michigan, suggesting that larvae may re- main pelagic long enough to disperse long distances by advection before settling to the bottom (geffen & nash, 1992). summer surface current velocities in lake champlain and lake ontario are comparable to lake michigan (mccormick, manley, beletsky, foley, & fahnenstiel, 2008; rao & murthy, 2001), so larval sculpins could disperse long distances through advection. larval advection could also explain why lake causeways have little to no effect on slimy sculpin populations. the flow of water through causeway openings can be substantial (34,000–325,000 m3/hr) and thus may facilitate larval drift among basins (myer & gruendling, 1979). however, flow direction varies among openings and can be al- most entirely unidirectional; for example, water through the carry bay and grand isle–north hero causeways flows predominately west into the main lake, flowing in the opposite direction from the main lake into the inland sea only 15% of the time (myer & gruendling, 1979). therefore, currents in causeway openings could facilitate asymmetric movement among basins. alternatively, lack of genetic structure in slimy sculpin in lakes could be explained by extremely large populations. the effective population size of sculpin in three of the seven sites sampled in lake champlain was estimated to be infinity, and the upper confidence interval from all sites included infinity. however, the lower confidence interval for ef- fective population size for all sites was <450, similar to effective pop- ulation sizes observed in stream populations of sculpin that showed significant levels of structure (dennenmoser, rogers, & vamosi, 2014). given that population structure has been identified in species with very large population sizes (e.g., foley et al., 2013), we suggest that it is unlikely that large population size alone explains the lack of genetic structure observed in lake champlain and lake ontario. euclide et al.the lack of genetic structure and isolation by distance of slimy scul- pin in our study contrasts with the high genetic structure observed in stream populations collected only a few kilometres apart (junker et al., 2012; dennenmoser et al., 2014; table 4). in 12 other microsatellite- based studies of sculpins, we identified similar observed heterozygos- ity and allelic richness but substantially lower fst than any other study (table 4). all but one of the 12 other microsatellite studies of sculpin focused on rivers or river systems and the remaining study focused on coastal populations. therefore, the higher population structure seen these studies could be partially explained by the higher degree of physical fragmentation in rivers than in our lake systems. however, even when compared to pairwise estimates in relatively unfragmented systems, our pairwise fst estimates were often an order of magnitude smaller than the minimum pairwise fst in other studies. our findings highlight how little is known about the life history and dispersal of sculpin in lakes and suggest that there may be signifi- cant differences in behaviour and life history between lotic and lentic populations. other studies have also indicated that the ecology and evolution of lentic and lotic fish populations can differ substantially (istead, yavno, & fox, 2015; minns, 1995; swain & holtby, 1989). we recommend that future research should focus on determining whether low genetic structure in lakes is a general trait for the cottidae family by expanding research to other common lentic and lotic species such as mottled sculpin. additionally, we propose that direct assessment of adult and larval movement of sculpin in streams and in lakes would be an important next step in determining how sculpin populations remain connected. finally, our results emphasise the importance of examining ecology and population structure in a variety of habitats to accurately characterise family- and species- wide trends. acknowledgements we thank captain steve cluett and deckhand krista hoffsis of the rv melosira for their expertise in the field and help collecting samples. additionally, we thank brian weidel and the usgs at the lake ontario biological station for collection of all lake ontario samples. we also thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. co- author natalie flores participation was funded by the national science foundation research experiences for undergraduates (reu) program (dbi- 1358838). finally, we would like to thank senator patrick leahy and the great lakes fishery commission for supporting this project.
