anguilla anguilla; transitional waters; growth; habitat use; mediterranean region introduction coastal lagoons are coastal water bodies character- ised by being shallow and separated by coastal barri- ers from the adjacent sea, but still in communication with it by means of tidal channels. these ecosystems are thus characterised by the presence of boundaries and transitions between land and water, between lagoon and sea and, frequently, between the waters in the lagoon and fw inputs. each boundary involves strong physical and ecological gradients that make them dynamic systems. because of these characteristics, coastal lagoons, and transitional waters (tw) generally, are among the aquatic habitats showing the highest biological productivity (carrada & fresi 1988; alonghi 1998; tett et al. 2003). they play an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing an assortment of habitat types for many species. they function as essential habitats for many organisms, providing important nursery grounds for juveniles of many mar- ine, estuarine and fw fishes, conduits for species that move between the sea and rivers, and feeding and staging sites for significant populations of migratory correspondence: e. ciccotti, dipartimento di biologia, universita degli studi di roma “tor vergata”, via della ricerca scientifica snc, 00133 roma, italy. e-mail: ciccotti@uniroma2.it doi: 10.1111/eff.12049 65 capoccioni et al. lagoons species (franco et al. 2006). these environments hence also house a high biodiversity. more than 621 species of macrophytes and 199 species of fishes are present in the atlanto-mediterranean in coastal region (perez-ruzafa et al. 2011). the fact that coastal lagoons provide a refuge for many species, and function as nursery areas and feeding grounds for marine species suggests that these organisms have developed physiological adaptations to survive in changing environments. such adaptations these involve a high energetic cost is reflected in growth and reproduction rates. that and moronidae lagoons have historically been of great interest to humans exactly because they offer high biological productivity. fisheries represent a highly intensive exploitation of coastal lagoons resources. they target a number of commercial fish from the sparidae, mugilidae, anguillidae families (kapetsky & lasserre 1984), which are present in more than the 75% of mediterranean lagoons (perez- ruzafa et al. 2007, 2011). fish communities of tws have peculiar features displaying high abundances of few r-strategist species, with wide ecological ampli- tude, generally low diversity and high biological pro- ductivity (odum 1969, 1985). in numerous lagoons, fish production has been found to be significantly cor- related with fluvial inputs, due to the high load of both nutrients and detritus carried downstream, which stim- ulate planktonic food webs (hilmer & bate 1991; whitfield & wooldridge 1994; franco et al. 2006). in addition, the organic substance-rich sediments that are found near fw inputs sustain a rich benthic commu- nity that constitutes the feeding ground for many ben- thophagous fishes including anguilla anguilla. this species is exploited by fisheries across its dis- tribution area, in continental waters such as rivers, lakes and coastal lagoons. for more than 10 years, the general picture on the status of eel stocks and fisheries has exhibited declining recruitment and reduced yields, apparent both from capture fisheries and from scientific indices throughout europe (ices 2006). in recent years, the anguillid eel has been demon- strated to be a facultative catadromous species, because part of its population has no fw experience (daverat et al. 2006; tabouret et al. 2010). this observation relies on the description of migratory pat- terns of the eel in its growth phase on the basis of otolith microchemistry analysis, that allows discrimi- nation between fresh, brackish and sea water contin- gents in many aquatic habitats at different latitudes (tzeng et al. 1997, 2000; tsukamoto et al. 1998; shiao et al. 2006). the otolith strontium/calcium (sr:ca) ratio is widely used to describe eel habitat shifts in tw because this is a chemical tag widely accepted to describe fish movements across different environments (campana 1999; elsdon et al. 2008). 66 the positive and predictable relationship that has been established by numerous experimental studies (thorrold et al. 1997; kraus & secor 2004; zimmer- man 2005) between salinity, temperature and element concentration of ambient water and molar ratio of sr to ca in the fish otoliths, also confirmed by field studies, is the fundamental assumption that makes the otolith sr:ca ratio such a powerful tool to distinguish the migratory life histories of fishes moving between fw and saltwater habitats (campana 1999; elsdon & gillanders 2002; elsdon et al. 2008). in fish that traverse estuarine salinity gradients during their life history, such as diadromous fishes, measurements of the sr:ca ratios in otoliths have been widely used to infer life-history periods spent in fresh, brackish and marine environments (brown & severin 2009). this approach has also been found to be reliable for the european eel (tzeng et al. 2000; arai et al. 2006; daverat & tomas 2006; shiao et al. 2006; lin et al. 2009) because sr:ca ratios in their otoliths are strongly correlated with the salinity of the water and its chemistry but is little affected by other factors such as water temperature, food and physiological factors (kawakami et al. 1998). in marine species, on the other hand, factors influencing otolith sr:ca vari- ations are more likely to be physiological in nature (campana 1999; secor & rooker 2000) because water chemistry has a more homogeneous sr:ca ratio in the marine environment, as recently pointed out by brown & severin (2009). the general pattern of habitat use described for the eel accounts for a preferential residence in brackish and marine habitats at higher latitudes, as shown by the higher proportion of individuals in the salt water (i.e., brackish and sea waters) contingents, (daverat et al. 2006). in contrast, eels at low latitudes are believed to inhabit preferentially fw (daverat et al. 2006). this phenomenon is attributed to the latitudinal difference in the aquatic productivity between fw and seawater (sw), that is, productivity at the lower lati- tudes is higher in fw than in salt water, contrary to the higher latitudes where productivity is higher in salt water than in fw (gross 1987). nevertheless, this observation does not take into account the fact that tw in the mediterranean, and coastal lagoons in par- ticular, are notably the most productive habitats, with respect to both sw and fw (acou et al. 2003). wherever they occur, eel inter-habitat shifts are short range (approximately 10 km) when compared with the migrations of silver eels and leptocephalus larvae, but, nevertheless, they are of considerable importance because they occur during the prolonged growth (yellow eel) stage and involve switching between environments that are completely different in terms of salinity, temperature, substrate, depth, as well as a large number of other environmental conditions (thibault et al. 2007). as a consequence of these con- siderations, the mechanism of facultative behaviour for eels at different latitudes is still controversial, and cannot be directly predicted by the environmental con- ditions (e.g., aquatic productivity) alone. this aspect requires more sampling and analyses of eel local stocks from southern regions, and this work aims at filling this gap. the aims of this study were to assess the migratory pattern of the european eel in tw at lower latitudes and to validate growth differ- ences among eels with different strategies of habitat use. the wider purpose of the work is to add insight into the understanding of the factors affecting the hab- itat use by eels in lagoons to ascertain the role and the relevance of mediterranean coastal lagoon environ- ments as growing habitats for the european eel. materials and methods environmental characteristics of sampling sites sampling has been carried out at three mediterranean locations (fig. 1), two coastal lagoons and the low eel habitat use in the mediterranean course of a river, characterised by different environ- mental features and different ranges of salinity. the tiber river (tr) basin drains an area of about 17,000 km2 in central italy and, with a length of 409 km, flows through the tuscany, umbria and laz- io regions. it runs through the city of rome (2.7 mil- lion residents) with a plain estuary that divides in two branches before flowing into the tyrrhenian sea (annual mean flow is 232 m3s  1; patrolecco et al. 2010). the salinity front in the estuary extends about 7 km upstream from the river mouth, although its amplitude depends on tide and river discharge. the sampling area is the lower river course, downstream of the city of rome, situated 20 km from the mouth. this stretch can be considered a fw habitat because salinity is 0 psu in all seasons. during the year, the mean water temperature is 17.2 °c (min 10 °c, max 23.7 °c). annual mean precipitation is about 737.7 mm, with 74.6 rainy days (istituto idrografico 2010). the brackish coastal lagoon of lesina (ll), located on the southern adriatic coast of italy (fig. 1), covers a surface area of 51.4 km2, mean water depth is 1 m. ll displays a mean salinity of 15.8 psu (max 28.4 psu fig. 1. location of the three study sites (lower tiber river, lesina lagoon and caprolace lagoon). 67 capoccioni et al. and min 10.3 psu). lesina lagoon is connected to the sea through two inlets and has several fw inputs, such as two perennial tributaries and several domestic and agricultural canals (nonnis marzano et al. 2003). sea- sonal salinity fluctuations are not severe due to the fw inputs that mitigate the effect of evaporation in summer months. on the other hand, an east–west spa- tial salinity gradient exists all over the year between different areas of the lagoon due to the reduced water circulation and the considerable contribution of fw inputs concentrated on the south-eastern side of the lagoon (manzo 2010). water temperature ranges from 10.3 to 27.6 °c (mean value: 18.4 °c; roselli et al. 2009). annual mean rainfall is about 635 mm (http:// www.meteoam.it). caprolace lagoon (cl), within the circeo national park (latina, latium), is part of the coastal pontine lagoons system, central italy (fig. 1). its surface area is 2.26 km2 with an average depth of 1.3 m (maxi- mum 2.9 m). water exchange with the sea is by two inlets. in order to reduce pollutant load, fw inputs draining the surrounding cultivated land were diverted in the late 1970s (prato et al. 2009). as a conse- quence, salinity has increased in the last two decades, up to the present with a mean of 38.1 psu (min 34.6 psu, max 41.4 psu). annual salinity fluctuations are a direct consequence of air temperature and rainfall (about 688.9 mm per year, with 76.6 of rainy days; is- tituto idrografico di roma 2010). both factors, in addition to the shallow depth of the lagoon, influence salinity that decreases in the winter months due to the rains, and exceeds sea values in summer due to evapo- ration and to the strong thermal winds also characteris- tic of this season. annual average water temperature is 18.5 °c (min 8.7 °c, max 29.1 °c). fish collection all individuals were measured for a total of 180 eels were collected, 60 from each sam- pling site, using fyke nets, during 2007/2008. total length (l, cm) and weight (w, g). sex was assessed macro- scopically whenever possible, otherwise by histo- logical examination of gonad tissue following the guidelines of colombo & grandi (1996). age reading the two largest otoliths (sagittae) were extracted from all adults, oven-dried and stored. the left sagitta was embedded in epoxy resin then ground on the convex side (grinding and polishing method; ices 2009) and then stained with 3% toluidine blue. con- ventionally (ices 2009), age for eel is evaluated by counting from the first ring after the central core of the otolith that accounts for the marine larval and 68 postlarval period of the eel. assigned age corre- sponds, therefore, to the years of the animal starting from its colonisation of the continental water body. microchemistry analysis of the otolith the sr:ca ratios of the right polished otoliths from 56 individuals (15, 20 and 21, respectively, from tr, ll and cl) were measured by a jeol jxa-8900r (tokyo, japan) electron probe micro analyzer (epma), from the primordium to the edge, with an interval of 10 lm, as detailed in lin et al. (2009). the reliability of this technique to assess the habitat use of a. anguilla in peculiar ecological conditions has been recently validated (panfili et al. 2012). the time resolution of epma was approximately 1–2 points per month in the otolith. the migratory pattern of the eel was classified into fw type, sw type (sw), brackish water type (bw) as well as inter-habitat shifter type (his), based on the correlation between sr:ca ratio registered at the otolith edge (corresponding to the last month of growth) and the water salinity values measured dur- ing the month before the eel capture. moreover, 25 otoliths were randomly selected and additionally analysed along the edge for approximately 20 points from the three study sites (i.e., five from tr, 11 from ll and nine from cl) to understand the variability of sr:ca ratios in otolith of the eel and the accuracy and precision of the sr:ca measurements. the crite- rion of fw was defined from mean sr:ca ratios at the edge of nine eel otoliths from tr (range = 1.9– 3.9; mean  sd = 2.8  0.8 9 10  3), while the criterion of sw was defined from mean sr:ca ratios of 21 otoliths from cl eels (range = 7.5–13.5; mean  sd = 10.3  1.7 9 10  3). the two criteria were used to test the annual change in sr:ca ratio of each otolith from the zero band (i.e., elver check) to the edge. the classification of migratory patterns was tested using the one-tailed unpaired t-test under 95% confidence level. the test hypotheses are as follows: 1. the sr:ca ratio measured in each point along the otolith transect is continually significantly higher than the fw criterion. 2. the sr:ca ratio measured in each point along the otolith transect is continually significantly lower than the sw criterion. the eel if the test results reject the hypothesis (1) but accept (2), the eel is classified as fw resident (rfw). if the test results reject the hypothesis (2) but accept (1), resident (rsw). if the test results accept the two hypotheses, the eel is classified as bw resident (rbw), while if the test reject both hypotheses, the eel is classified as habitat inter-shifter (his). only the ratios, calculated is classified as saline water along the otolith transect, from a distance >200 lm, (generally corresponding to the start of the continen- tal growth) were used to compute the classification. female eels (two-way anova, p = 0.014). however, no significant correlation between site and sex was found in the eels’ growth rate (two-way anova, p > 0.05). eel habitat use in the mediterranean back-calculation of fish length-at-age individual growth in length was reconstructed by back-calculation through otolith reading for 56 speci- mens, as successfully done in a. anguilla (lin et al. 2007; pujolar et al. 2009b) and other eel species (jes- sop et al. 2004). size-at-age was back-calculated according to the ‘body-proportional hypothesis’ (francis 1990). for each site, maximal otolith radius was regressed from core to edge (r) on total body length (l) after log-transformation of both variables: log l ¼ a þ b log r then, the scaling coefficient b of the l–r relation- ships (b = 1.02, 1.01 and 0.95 in tr, cl and lesina lagoon, respectively) was used to compute the back- calculated body length li at age i, namely: li ¼ ðri=rþb l where ri is the otolith radius at annulus i. results comparison of biological information among habitats  1),  1) and cl (4.4  1.0 cmyear table 1 compares the biological information and the growth rates among samples: eels are older in cl (8  2.4 years old), followed by tr (5.4  2.5 years old) and youngest in ll (4.6  1.8 years old; anova, p < 0.05). the mean (sd) growth rate was highest in ll (8.5  2.9 cmyear followed by tr (5.1  1.7 cmyear  1; anova; all pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05). this indi- cates that eels in ll are youngest and grow fastest, fol- lowed by eels in tr, eels in cl are oldest and grow slowest. the correlation coefficient (r) between mean annual growth rate and age also indicates that growth rate decreases with increasing age, irrespective of sex or habitat (anova, p < 0.01). the mean annual growth rate was statistically compared among sites and sexes by two-way anova. the results reveal that the growth rate was significantly different among the three sites (two-way anova, p = 0.000) and between male and relationship between otolith sr:ca ratio and habitat salinity a positive and significant relationship between sr:ca ratio measured at the edge of the otolith and the correspondent salinity values (s) recorded in the last month in the three different habitats is showed in fig. 2 (sr:ca ratio = 0.17 9 s + 4.35; r2 = 0.63; anova, p < 0.01). in addition, to test the accuracy and precision of the otolith sr:ca analysis, 20 mea- surements of sr:ca ratio were made along the otolith edge of 25 eels, randomly selected from the whole sample (i.e., five from tr, 11 from ll and nine from cl), and salinity (s). also in this case, a simple linear regression was fitted showing a positive and significant correlation between these parameters (sr:ca ratio = 0.18 9 s + 4.77; r2 = 0.49; anova, p < 0.01). comparing these two linear regressions of the otolith sr:ca ratio with salinity, no significant dif- ferences were found (ancova, p = 0.15) revealing that sr:ca analysis is reliable, irrespective of the different measuring sites in the otolith. patterns of habitat use of the eel as indicated by its otolith sr:ca ratios in tr, 60% of the otoliths accounted for a rfw strat- egy (fw resident, otoliths with sr:ca ratio values continually below 2.8  0.8 9 10  3), while the fig. 2. the correlation of sr:ca ratio with salinity in the last month for the eels collected from the three different habitat: tiber river, lesina lagoon and caprolace lagoon. table 1. biological data of eels sampled in the three study sites. mean  sd (range) location samples (n) tiber river lesina lagoon caprolace lagoon 60 60 60 sex ratio (f:m:und) 6:21:33 50:0:8 35:9:16 length (cm) 34.1  11.6 (20.0–81.0) 43.2  11.1 (27.0–71.0) 41.0  10.2 (27.0–72.0) weight (g) 99.5  146.1 (12.6–960.0) 164.2  149.9 (25.5–693.0) 121.7  111.8 (23.2–655.3) age (year) 5.4  2.5 (2–15) 4.6  1.8 (1–12) 8.0  2.4 (4–16) growth rate (cmyear  1) 5.1  1.7 (1.9–10.8) 8.5  2.9 (4.7–22.9) 4.4  1.0 (2.9–7.8) 69 capoccioni et al. other 40% were classified as his. in ll, sr:ca ratios from the elver check to the otolith edge of 13 eels (65%) accounted for a continue residence in bw (rbw), since the elver stage, whereas 35% account for the his strategy, because fluctuating between the ranges of brackish and sw criteria. in cl, all sam- ples have been classified as his, because no otoliths showed an sr:ca pattern continually over or under the saline water and fw criterion, respectively. eight profile patterns were found in the three sam- pling sites, tr, ll and cl and they were shown respectively in the fig. 3, 4 and 5. two patterns (figs 3a and 4a) account for a typology of resident eels, either in fw, bw or saline water, and six of the observed patterns account for a typology of his eels (figs 3b,c, 4b,c and 5a,b). among tr shifter eels, most (60%) lingered in fw for more than a year after metamorphosis after first entry in continental waters, but moved between fw and bw habitats in the following period (hisfw-bw).

(2008) point out, an important but overlooked scenario, when interpreting otolith chemi- cal tags, is that a change in the otolith chemistry could reflect a change in the environment surrounding a stationary fish. such could be the case of this contin- gent, which therefore might be more correctly defined as a rbw-sw contingent. the sr:ca ratio of three eels (14.3%) of the cl sample showed values in the bw range for the few eel habitat use in the mediterranean then moving over the sw threshold first years, (hisbw-fw). in addition, all sr:ca ratios of eels grown in cl were higher than the fw threshold, and this accounts for the fact that these eels never ven- tured in fw habitats. back-calculated fish length-at-age the linear regression was fitted to logarithmically (base 10) transformed total length (log lt) against logarithmically (base 10) transformed otolith radius (log ot) by the back-calculation equation of scale proportional hypothesis (sph; francis 1990; francis 1995) for eels among the three sites. results indicate that otolith radius-at-length for ll eels (the slope of regression = 0.95) was than radius of eels either from tr (the slope of regres- sion = 1.02) and cl eels (the slope of regres- sion = 1.01; ancova; ll vs. tr or ll vs. cl, p = 0.000). no significant differences were observed between tr and cl otolith radius (ancova, p = 0.068). this that eels with faster somatic growth have smaller otoliths. this regression provided the coefficients for the sph back-calcula- tion model used to estimate lengths at ages for eels that underwent sr:ca analysis. significantly smaller suggests difference in growth rate among habitat use patterns the mean (sd) annual growth rates have been compared among eels with different habitat use strat- egies (i.e., resident eels vs. inter-habitat shifter eels;

jessop et al. 2002; tzeng et al. 2002, 2003; morrison et al. 2003; kotake et al. 2004). because of these faculta- tive movements between salinity zones, the habitat where an eel has been sampled does not reliably indicate where previous growth has occurred. pro- posed explanations for facultative migration between habitats of different salinities were the relative avail- ability of food (gross 1987), looking for a faster growth environment, avoidance of competition, ago- nistic interactions and cannibalism (daverat et al. 2006; shiao et al. 2006; edeline et al. 2007). how- ever, in evolutionary terms, the existence of different migratory patterns in diadromous fishes, including anguillid eels, can be viewed as a mechanism that 72 promotes population resiliency by hedging against unforeseen adverse circumstances in any habitat (secor & rooker 2005). transitional waters have always been acknowl- edged as important environments for many fish spe- cies because they represent suitable colonisation habitats for both marine and fw species. on the other hand, the extreme variability of these habitats influences the occurrence and distribution of fishes differently. transitional habitats in the mediterranean area, such as lagoons and estuaries, are characterised by abiotic and biotic forces completely different from those involved in atlantic and north european coastal environments. on the other hand, within each geographical range and latitude, an extreme variabil- ity is the rule, and no two coastal lagoons or two estuaries are identical in terms of both biotic and abi- otic (including morphology, hydrology, climate, local boundary conditions) characteristics. habitat use in mediterranean region our results highlight differences in habitat use, as well as in biological characteristics, of three mediter- ranean local stocks situated at the same latitude. the otolith sr:ca ratio analysis shows that eels in tw such as coastal lagoons and estuaries display remark- able flexibility in habitat use (i.e., from fw riverine to brackish and sw sectors in lagoons), as shown by the that have been observed: fw, sw and bw residents and inter- habitat shifter eels (figs 3–5). the fraction of eels adopting a resident habit varies between the three several migratory patterns environments: 60% in the river tiber, 65% in lesina lagoon and 85.7% in cl. these results contrast with those of other studies where residency in estuaries and coastal sites is a less common life-history trait than nomadic movements between water masses of different salinity (daverat et al. 2006). in accordance with this author, laffaille et al. (2005) and panfili et al. (2012) found that european eels may preferably adopt a sedentary lifestyle preferentially in fw habi- tats. our results in contrast highlight that in coastal lagoons in the mediterranean area as well as in estu- aries, residency, irrespective of salinity, is the prevail- ing habit, and nomadic behaviour is less frequent. possible explanations of nomadic behaviour habitat inter-shifter eels in the tr, which showed an experience in bw (35%), probably moved in zones where the saline wedge is permanent during the whole year (approximately 10 km far the sampling site in the direction of the river mouth). as no differ- ences in growth rate were found between his and resident fw eels from the tr, the main cause for the choice of migratory behaviour could be accidental. the ecological characteristics and consequently the productivity and food availability of the bw zone (all along the saline wedge range of the estuary) are quite similar to those of adjacent zones with salinity close to 0. in this river, the final stretch is approxi- mately 50 km long because it is barred by the castel giubileo dam, which hampers eel colonisation in the upper stretches of the river. it could be hypothesised that most eels remain in fw habitats with a limited home range (laffaille et al. 2005; tabouret et al. 2010), while others move between different salinity zones that are only few km from each other when searching for food. the ll is a wider and complex water body (20 km long and 3 km wide) typically characterised by both fw and sw inputs that shape a stable spatial pattern on the eastern–western axis of the basin. here, shifter eels, experiencing both sw and bw, probably move between the central area of the lagoon and sectors near the tidal channel where salinity levels are higher over the whole year. in ll, eels with a resident behaviour (rbw) show faster growth compared with his. because lesina is considered an hypertrophic lagoon (manzo 2010), as reflected also by eels mean annual growth increments (8.5  2.9 cmyear  1), the significant slower growth of individuals moving between different salinity zones could be due to the years spent in sw zones where food availability is lower in comparison with the bw zones close to the fw inputs. moreover, as ll is a very wide lagoon, the cost of migration involved during shifts could have played an important role. eel habitat use in the mediterranean in cl, a relatively small environment (3.7 km length and 0.8 km large), only 14.3% of eels (hisbw-sw) experienced a residence in bw for more than 1 year. most eels (85.7%) yielded a sr:ca pat- tern accounting for shifts between bw and sw with a time frame of these movements being very short (i.e., 6 months), that have been interpreted as salinity fluctuations of than as movements of the fish. the absence of fw inlets and the small size of the lagoon probably account for an alternative hypothesis that these eels might also be resident in the lagoon and that the sr:ca ratio pattern observed in their otoliths is due to seasonal variations of salinity in the lagoon. the environment rather the interpretation of our results could be affected by confounding factors as temperature and growth rates because several studies had shown that, as well as the water salinity, these parameters could affect the incorporation of trace elements into otolith matrix (campana 1999). these effects, as well as the origin of the ions deposited in the otolith aragonite, have been seldom investigated. it is supposed that they enter the plasma via intestinal absorption or by the gill epithelium, and from the plasma they pass in the endolymph of the inner ear (campana 1999). the otolith composition will then depend on the relative contribution of ambient water and diet, as well as the otolith shape (capoccioni et al. 2011), but it has been acknowledged that water is the primary source of ions in fish otoliths (milton & chenery 2001; walter & thorrold 2006). temperature is thought to be posi- tively correlated with sr:ca ratio in the otoliths (els- don & gillanders 2002), but in this study, this factor is probably not relevant because all three study sites display similar temperature regimes over the whole year as well as the same mean annual values (approx- imately 18 °c). the 2007). accordingly, otolith sr:ca ratios are negatively correlated with growth rate in many fish species (sadovy & severin 1992) and also in the european eel (tzeng et al. 2000), but the mechanisms are still not clear (lin et al. pattern observed in figs 4 and 5, where lesina eels display sr:ca ratios lower than those of caprolace, could cor- to respond (ll, 8.5 cmyear  1; cl 4.4 cmyear see table 1). therefore, morrison et al. (2003) and thibault et al. (2007) suggested that the growth rate observed in an- guillid eels was a consequence rather than a cause of variable migratory patterns. growth  1, differences general in rates advantages and cost of inter-habitat movements these results support the hypothesis that habitat selection of eel during the growth phase may be opportunistic, not obligatory. because choice of the 73 capoccioni et al. growth habitat may depend on the food availability and carrying capacity of the habitat, the migration choice could be explained in relation to the balance between the advantages obtained from migration and the costs involved. advantages include such aspects as increased food supply, avoidance of potentially harmful environmental conditions and/or a movement to more favourable ones and the availability of more living space. costs of migration include mortalities resulting from migration itself as well as changed environmental conditions that may be intolerable, specifically osmoregulatory stress in euryhaline spe- cies (mcdowall 1988; tzeng et al. 2003). in diadro- mous facultative movements between zones at different salinity may occur when the gain in fitness from using a second habitat minus the migration costs of moving between habitats exceeds the fitness of remaining in a single habitat (gross 1987). specific patterns of movements and habitat use are probably triggered by biotic and abiotic factors associated with local habitats, particu- larly productivity gradients. such as a. anguilla, species, the present study confirms the phenotypic plas- ticity hypothesis of habitat use of the eel. because european eel is assumed to be a panmictic popula- tion, and this is confirmed also for local stocks in the mediterranean area (pujolar et al. 2009a,b) and as this precludes segregation of genotypes, local dif- ferences in life-history patterns are likely to be of phenotypic origin (jessop et al. 2004). the present findings confirm in fact that in tw in this region, growth rates and habitat use show typical patterns that are different from those observed in rivers and coastal habitats at more northern latitudes. the pre- vailing habitat use behaviour in mediterranean tws is the residency, while nomadic behaviour is less frequent. moreover, with respect to northern euro- pean environments, these productive ecosystems provide a more favourable condition for growth, is, higher growth rates (melia et al. 2006; that yalcßõn- €ozdilek et al. 2006; bevacqua et al. 2012), because phenotypic growth is positively correlated with latitude and temperature (vøllestad 1992). once again, the knowledge of how fish use their habitat in space and time throughout their life his- tory appears to be fundamental for the understand- ing of the ecology and population dynamics, and to determine habitats functions, also to allow for the development of conservation measures (gillanders 2002). effective acknowledgements this work was
