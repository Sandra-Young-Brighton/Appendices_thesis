(2004). both of these extremes have been observed in sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka) within the snake river basin (winans et al. 1996; waples et al. 1997). similarly, previous studies of sympatric resident and anadromous (steelhead) rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) have detected both extensive gene ﬂow (seamons et al. 2004; olsen et al. 2006; pearsons et al. 2007) and apparent genetic isolation (narum et al. 2004) between forms (although cross-basin transfers might have affected ﬁndings of genetic isolation; narum et al. 2004). the rainbow trout is an excellent candidate for applying insights from pristine salmonid populations towards managing and protecting disturbed ones. highly regarded as sport ﬁsh, rainbow trout have been widely harvested, cultured and introduced throughout doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00248.x 539 mcphee et al. temperate waters of the world (maccrimmon 1971). along with habitat loss and migratory issues, these activities have contributed to conservation problems for indigenous populations (busby et al. 1996). intro- duced rainbow trout have adversely affected other ﬁsh species in temperate waters around the world (crowl et al. 1992; leary et al. 1995). remedial actions, such as through the u.s. endangered species act (esa) of 1978, have been instigated in response to these overall concerns (mcelhany et al. 2000). rainbow trout populations of the kamchatka penin- sula (russian federation) at the north-western edge of the species’ range provide contrast to those at the south- eastern limit. despite a growing interest in many this region (savvaitova et al. 2003), resources of kamchatka resident and steelhead populations persist in an essentially undisturbed condition. their close kinship to degraded coastal populations of south-eastern paciﬁc drainages (okazaki 1984; pavlov & kuzishchin 1999; mccusker et al. 2000) suggests that they would make appropriate comparative models for understand- ing patterns of gene ﬂow among populations and life histories prior to habitat degradation and barriers to migration. this knowledge is important in russia as well because o. mykiss is listed in the russian red data book of endangered species (savvaitova et al. 2003). the objectives of this paper were twofold. first, we used patterns of genotypic (microsatellite) variability of o. mykiss sampled from rivers of the kamchatka peninsula to estimate gene ﬂow within and among sampled populations and rivers and between life-history types within a river. second, we reviewed existing studies about genetic differentiation between sympatric resident and anadromous o. mykiss. in combination with our kamchatka data, we then used this information as a basis for evaluating current and alternate manage- ment strategies of populations around the paciﬁc rim. methods adult o. mykiss were sampled using hook and line or in rare cases with gill nets (80 mm · 80 mm mesh) from seven rivers across the kamchatkan peninsula in 2002–2004 (fig. 1, table 1). fin clips were taken 540 fig. 1. rivers of the kamchatka peninsula from which genetic samples were collected. table 1. sample size by river and life history. river year sample code sample size resident anadromous half-pounder snatolvayam 2002 sna 2002 kva kvachina utkholok 2003 utk sopochnaya 2002 sop 2004 kek kekhta 2003 kol kol zhupanova 2002 zhu 39 94 81 81 12 46 29 0 0 0 35 0 46 29 sample code refers to table 3 and fig. 3. 39 94 45 46 12 0 0 0 0 36 0 0 0 0 from the anal or pectoral ﬁns and preserved in 95% ethanol. scales were collected from the fourth row above the lateral line between the dorsal and adipose ﬁns and used to assign individuals as resident or anadromous following kuzishchin et al.

(1993) population structure of o. mykiss from kamchatka samples from each river were tested for deviation from hardy–weinberg proportions (hwp) at each locus using guo & thompson’s (1992) exact test, implemented in arlequin v. 2.000 (schneider et al. 2000). we corrected signiﬁcance levels for multiple tests within each population using the false discovery rate (fdr) method, which is less stringent than the sequential bonferonni correction (benjamini & hoch- berg 1995). expected heterozygosity was calculated over all loci in arlequin. pairwise genetic divergence between samples was calculated as fst and rst (based on the square of the size difference between alleles in repeat number; slatkin 1995) and permutation of genotypes between populations was used to test the null hypothesis of no divergence between sample pairs. isolation by distance (slatkin 1993) was examined by regressing pairwise geographic distance (distance between river mouths, km) against pairwise genetic divergence, expressed as fst/(1)fst) after rousset (1997). the correlation between genetic and geographic distances was evalu- ated using the mantel test (mantel 1967), implemented in f-stat (goudet 2001). clustering of samples based on variance in allele frequencies was determined using a principal component analysis (pca) implemented in pcagen 1.2 (goudet 1999). we tested for genic and genotypic differentiation between life-history types within the sopochnaya and utkholok rivers using fisher’s exact test for homo- geneity of allelic and genotypic distributions, respect- ively (raymond & rousset 1995). these tests were performed in genepop, using 100 batches, at 1000 iterations per batch, following a burn-in period of 1000 iterations. results and discussion genotypic data and analyses all 10 microsatellite loci were polymorphic across the region, with the total number of alleles per locus ranging from two to 19, and the mean number of alleles per locus per sample ranging from 1.9 to 9.8 (table 2). most samples exhibited hardy–weinberg proportions at all loci. however, conformation to hwp was rejected after controlling for multiple tests in sopochnaya residents at omm1050 and in utk- str60–2 holok (appendix i). in these three cases, an excess of homozygotes was observed, but we did not remove these loci from the analysis because overall there was no reason to suspect the presence of null alleles. expected heterozygosity over all loci ranged from 0.24 in utkholok river half-pounders to 0.54 in anadromous individuals from the sopochnaya river (table 3). half-pounders and at ssa20.19 541 mcphee et al. table 3. pairwise fst (below diagonal), rst (above diagonal) and overall expected heterozygosity along diagonal in italics. sna kva utk-a utk-hp sop-a sop-r kek sna kva utk-a utk-hp sop-a sop-r kek kol zhu a ¼ anadromous, hp ¼ half-pounder, r ¼ resident. f-statistics in bold are signiﬁcantly greater than zero. 0.004 )0.012 )0.026 0.24 0.037 0.045 0.123 0.091 0.199 0.44 0.003 )0.001 )0.009 0.049 0.052 0.103 0.103 0.191 0.005 0.45 0.002 )0.010 0.047 0.044 0.084 0.095 0.180 0.010 )0.003 0.42 )0.016 0.053 0.060 0.107 0.106 0.187 0.072 0.105 0.085 0.073 0.54 )0.003 0.012 0.019 0.074 0.047 0.063 0.048 0.051 )0.007 0.51 0.015 0.024 0.090 0.117 0.132 0.109 0.137 )0.005 0.006 0.51 )0.005 0.045 kol 0.199 0.203 0.179 0.172 0.045 0.059 )0.020 0.51 0.065 zhu 0.390 0.352 0.360 0.451 0.189 0.237 0.202 0.088 0.45 fig. 2. pairwise genetic differentiation as a function of pairwise geographic distance (between river mouths). genetic divergence, reﬂected in pairwise fst and rst (table 3), was consistent with geographic separation. divergence followed an isolation-by-distance pattern (fig. 2), ranging from negligible values between neigh- bouring rivers to fst ¼ 0.19 between the snatolvayam and zhupanova rivers. pairwise genetic (fst) and geographic distances were signiﬁcantly and strongly correlated (mantel test, r ¼ 0.87, p < 0.0005). a principal component analysis (fig. 3) suggested three genetically distinct groups: (1) snatolvayam, kvachina and utkholok; (2) sopochnaya, kekhta and kol and (3) zhupanova. this grouping was based predominantly on the ﬁrst principal component (pc1), which explained 72.8 % of the variance in allele frequencies among samples, and was augmented by pc2 (11.6 %). overall fst was 0.11 and signiﬁcantly greater than zero (p < 0.0001). in the sopochnaya river, anadromous and resident individuals did not differ signiﬁcantly according to allele frequencies (d.f. ¼ 20, p ¼ 0.35) or multi-locus genotypes (d.f. ¼ 20, p ¼ 0.35). similarly, no signi- ﬁcant differentiation in allele frequencies (d.f. ¼ 20, p ¼ 0.68) or multi-locus genotypes (d.f. ¼ 20, p ¼ 0.73) was detected between half-pounders and mature anadromous individuals from the uthkolok river. these results are supported by an otolith 542 fig. 3. results of principal components analysis of genetic variation among samples. pc1 explained 73.0% of the variation and pc2 explained 11.6%. sample codes are described in table 1. microchemistry study of o. mykiss from the saichek river of western kamchatka (zimmerman et al. 2003). anadromous females gave rise to both anadr- omous and resident offspring, in accordance with our ﬁnding of gene ﬂow between both forms in kam- chatka. comparability of kamchatka and eastern paciﬁc o. mykiss populations although once considered a separate species (behnke 1966), conspeciﬁcity of kamchatka populations with o. mykiss in north america is now well established (behnke 1992). molecular data from nuclear (okazaki 1984; pavlov & kuzishchin 1999) and mitochondrial (mccusker et al. 2000) loci suggest a closer relation- ship of kamchatka populations to coastal groups extending through oregon and california, and separate from sublineages putatively descended from queen charlotte (mtdna) and north american interior (nuc- lear loci) refuges. a phylogeographic analysis (mccus- ker et al. 2000) suggests that kamchatka was the last region of the paciﬁc rim to be colonised by o. mykiss, via the bering strait. previous studies have reported reduced allozyme and mitochondrial dna variability in kamchatkan popula- tions (the north-western edge of the species’ range) compared with north america (osinov & pavlov 1994; pavlov 2000; pavlov et al. 2004). we also found evidence for reduced microsatellite diversity in popu- lations from kamchatka. expected heterozygosity in our study populations (0.24–0.54) was low compared with microsatellite studies of o. mykiss from other regions. for example, expected heterozygosity based on previous microsatellite studies ranged from 0.55–0.59 in alaska (olsen et al. 2006), 0.51–0.87 in british columbia (heath et al. 2001; hendry et al. 2002; heggenes et al. 2006), 0.68–0.86 in washington (ardren & kapuscinski 2003; narum et al. 2006) and 0.62–0.79 in california (aguilar & garza 2006). we were able to compare single-locus measures of observed heterozygosity from these studies for ﬁve of our 10 loci. three of the ﬁve loci showed reduced heterozygosity in kamchatka compared with north american popula- tions, while one (ogo4) showed greater heterozygosity and the other was within the range found in north america (data not shown). thus, although reduced overall heterozygosity could be due simply to differ- ences between loci across studies, lower genetic diversity might also reﬂect the later colonisation and isolation of kamchatkan populations compared with those in north america. however, we found consider- able divergence across the peninsula and isolation by distance was on a scale similar to that reported by aguilar & garza (2006) for steelhead populations from california (the oldest o. mykiss lineages, mccusker et al. 2000), suggesting that the genetic structure of these populations has approached equilibrium. despite apparently reduced genetic diversity, kam- chatka o. mykiss populations express the full spectrum of life-history variability found throughout the species’ range (pavlov et al. 1999; savvaitova et al. 2003). the presence of all-anadromous, all-resident or mixed life histories in kamchatka rivers is similar to western alaska streams that support o. mykiss populations at similar latitudes. for instance, only all-resident pop- ulations occur on the alaska mainland north of the alaska peninsula, while steelhead predominate on much of the alaska peninsula and both forms coexist to the southeast in the copper river (olsen et al. 2006). such a geographical pattern is expected if the difference between freshwater and marine productiv- ity, thought ultimately to drive the evolution of diadromy, varies broadly with latitude (gross et al. 1988). while latitude is apparently a major factor in the level of anadromy versus residency in o. mykiss populations at the range-wide scale, at the regional scale life history diversity is likely also a function of the biophysical complexity of rivers (stanford et al. 2002). population structure of o. mykiss from kamchatka gene ﬂow in sympatry our results, indicating a lack of reproductive isolation between sympatric life-history forms in kamchatka, generally support those of other studies seeking evidence for gene ﬂow between sympatric resident and anadromous o. mykiss over a broad geographic range in north america (table 4). no genetic diver- gence between forms was found in 11 of 12 streams where nuclear data were collected, and divergence in the aberrant stream (walla walla river) may reﬂect out-of-basin stocking of steelhead (narum et al. 2004). the other two instances indicating nonrandom mating were based on female-restricted data where breeding with male parents could not be excluded (zimmerman & reeves 2002; docker & heath 2003). such one-way gene ﬂow from small ‘satellite’ males is common in salmonids (e.g., quinn 2005) and may explain these results. thus, from this review we conclude that gene ﬂow commonly, perhaps predom- inantly, occurs in o. mykiss when resident and steel- head populations spawn in sympatry. relevance of present observations and current management directives settings based on the results presented and reviewed in this paper, we suggest that in many (if not most) rivers, sympatric rainbow trout and steelhead should be considered members of a common population. fur- thermore, expression of such life-history diversity in a single population probably has adaptive signiﬁcance. atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) populations, evolving in parallel north atlantic ecological to o. mykiss, have complex and dynamic age and maturity structures, and this retention of divergent life histories within common taxonomic units is inter- preted as an evolutionary strategy that promotes adaptive ﬂexibility in streams that are subject to unstable temperatures and stream ﬂows and reduces inbreeding through matings of predominantly younger males with predominantly older females (valiente et al. 2005; juanes et al., in press). however, it is worth pointing out that the presence of younger males in the breeding population would also increase the rate of loss of heterozygosity due to ﬁnite population size by decreasing generation time (r. waples, personal communication). the capability to balance life-history options ﬁts understandings of anadromy as ‘…a suite of life history traits…expressed as points along continua for each species and population.’ (quinn & myers 2005) as ‘…a function of variation in costs and beneﬁts…’ (hendry et al. 2004) in speciﬁc situations. an alternate response in more stable lake environments is exem- pliﬁed in the sympatric divergence of resident sockeye 543 mcphee et al. table 4. summary of studies comparing reproductive isolation between sympatric anadromous and resident o. mykiss. location description kamchatka peninsula russia copper river alaska british columbia canada yakima river washington deschutes river oregon quileute river washington walla walla river washington no within-drainage divergence detected between resident and anadromous ﬁsh. isolation by distance evident among populations sampled over a 1200 km range. spawning resident and anadromous ﬁsh sampled at two adjacent upstream tributaries were indistinguishable within locations (fst ¼ 0.000–0.003) but differed signiﬁcantly between locations (fst ¼ 0.019–0.028). comparison with downstream steelhead populations highly signiﬁcant (fst ¼ 0.170–0.202) sympatric steelhead and resident ﬁsh from ﬁve rivers diverged signiﬁcantly for mtdna in one river (meziadin). remaining mtdna and all nuclear comparisons were nonsigniﬁcant. visual evidence of anadromous and resident interbreeding consistent with allele frequencies of progeny subsequently collected in the same reaches. resident female parentage (low ratios) dominated in mainstem progeny while steelhead (high ratios) dominated below falls and in tributaries. mating behaviour observed during late spawning season between wild resident males and steelhead females in all reaches studied. genetic divergence of resident and anadromous populations in mainstem, but not in touchet r. tributary. mainstem differences may reﬂect out-of-basin stocking. data type microsatellite (10 loci) microsatellite (13 loci) reproductive isolation no no reference this study olsen et al.

tative mating and distinct spawning locations (wood & foote 1996). we ﬁnd no evidence to suggest that such a ﬁxed and genotypically determined life history is common in o. mykiss. the biological signiﬁcance of gene ﬂow among life-history variants has important conservation and management implications. given their reproductive independence, regulations promoting separate protec- tion, restoration and harvest of coexisting kokanee and sockeye populations are biologically appropriate. despite their overlapping distributions, each entity is affected independently by hydrological, habitat and harvest issues. conversely, in species like steelhead and atlantic salmon where interbreeding among life- history classes prevails in sympatry, these issues in the interest of sound become interdependent. management and conservation, the expression of multiple life histories within a common gene pool mandates parallel protection of each component and their interaction. the lack of simple genetic determination of life history in o. mykiss has implications for restoration, as well. on the one hand, it suggests that genetic variation for life history will not be lost rapidly from a population even under strong selection against a particular form (e.g., thrower et al. 2004). such retention provides hope that, for example, populations 544 that have lost the anadromous form due to artiﬁcial barriers to migration might be restored from local resident individuals on time scales relevant to most management schemes. however, given how poorly we understand the interaction between environment and genome in the determination of salmonid life history, this idea remains a hypothesis and should not be a basis for management actions. yet more challenging is the implication that proper restoration must focus on identifying and restoring habitat features that promote expression of life-history diversity as opposed to managing numbers of adults through artiﬁcial propa- gation. recently, the national marine fisheries service ruled that distinct population segments (dpss) of steelhead subject to protection under the u.s. esa would be considered separately from resident o. mykiss (national marine fisheries service, nmfs 2005). this ruling noted ‘…despite the apparent reproductive exchange between resident and anadr- omous o. mykiss, the two life forms remain markedly separated physically, physiologically, ecologically, and behaviorally. given the marked separation between the anadromous and resident life history forms in physical, physiological, ecological, and behavioural factors, we may conclude that the anadr- omous steelhead populations are discrete from the resident rainbow trout populations within the dpss under consideration…’. it while this ruling is in keeping with the history of separate management by nmfs and usfws of the dpss in question, is biologically unsound for reasons discussed above. for instance, the biological reality is that resident and anadromous populations interbreed in the yakima river, a tributary to the middle columbia river (pearsons et al. 2007) where steelhead are presently listed as threatened under the esa (mcclure et al. 2003). exclusion of the resident life history in the protection and recovery of middle columbia river steelhead prevents adequate assess- ments of current and future population dynamics, and precludes full awareness of the status of o. mykiss in this large area. management recommendations lack of isolation reproductive the between anadromous and resident forms suggests a strong role for environment in determining the expression of life history in o. mykiss. thus, conservation of o. mykiss requires knowledge of how the many components of habitat (freshwater spawning and rearing habitat, marine feeding conditions and migration pathways) interact to inﬂuence life history and population size. furthermore, demographic and evolutionary independ- ence of spawning populations, in addition to underly- ing geomorphologic differences between neighbouring streams, indicates that the exact nature of genotypic and environmental effects is likely to vary at a ﬁne spatial scale. currently, we lack an understanding of the mechanistic determination of life history in o. mykiss, and detailed information on both forms from a single river is scarce. we suggest that a ﬁrst step in understanding and conserving the true com- plexity of o. mykiss life history would be to abandon thinking (‘steelhead’ and ‘rainbow the typological trout’ as biologically independent units) that has pervaded the biology and management of this species in north america and around the paciﬁc rim. acknowledgements kathy knudsen and patty mcintyre provided laborat- ory assistance, and
