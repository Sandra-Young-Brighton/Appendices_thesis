(grifﬁths 1994). doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00362.x 445 power et al. the documented occurrence of sympatric forms of arctic charr in europe has been extensive, particularly in iceland, norway, scotland and sweden (e.g., jonsson & jonsson 2001), and to a lesser extent in russia (e.g., pavlov 1997; alekseyev et al. 2002). to date, only four cases of lacustrine sympatric forms have been documented in canada. in matamek lake (50°n), reports on the ecology of arctic charr distinguishable on the basis of colour, body depth, head morphology and feeding ecology suggested sympatric forms (saunders & power 1969). similarly, in lakes in the borup fjord area of northern ellesmere island (80°n), a size polymorphism was described, with modal size-groupings differing in appearance and habitat use (parker & johnson 1991). in lake hazen, ellesmere island (82°n), morphological and ecologi- cal differences between two forms have been docu- mented and studied (reist et al. 1995; guiguer et al. 2002), and in gander lake, newfoundland (49°n), a size polymorphism associated with both genetic and habitat segregation has been identiﬁed and veriﬁed (o’connell & dempson 2002; power et al. 2005; gomez-uchida et al. 2008). documentation of sympatric forms in canada, therefore, has been limited to the northern and southern margins of the range. however, studies of intervening populations along the latitudinal gradient separating ellesmere island and insular newfoundland have been largely conﬁned to anadromous stocks in labrador (e.g., andrews & lear 1956; dempson & green 1985; dempson 1995), bafﬁn island (e.g., grainger 1953; moore 1975) or the ungava bay area (e.g., lejeune 1967; jessop et al. 1970; gillis et al. 1982; cunjak et al. 1986; power & barton 1987; boivin & power 1990). in contrast, the postglacial lakes of mainland sub-arctic que´bec and labrador most likely to be associated with the occurrence of morphological divergence in resident ﬁsh (robinson & parsons 2002) have received little attention (benoit & power 1981), with some exceptions (martin 1955; berube´ & curtis 1986; fraser & power 1989; boivin & power 1990; curtis et al. 1995). previous investigations of arctic charr and their competitive interactions in upland lakes to the north and west of the koksoak river, northern que´bec (fraser & power 1989), noted bimodal length distri- butions and variations in growth rates and trophic status dependent on the presence or absence of sympatric lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush). such differences are suggestive of the phenotypic plasticity associated with morphological variation in arctic charr in other locales. limited investigations of the area to the south and east of the koksoak river completed in the 1950s (g. power, unpublished data) noted the presence of arctic charr in many lakes, but did not examine possible size or morphological 446 variation. more recent investigations in the area aimed at examining salmonid interactions yielded evidence of size and morphological variation (g. power, in lake aigneau (57°14¢n, unpublished data) 70°07¢w) that was unexpected given the moderate size of the lake (54 km2) and complexity of the ﬁsh community (10 species). in single-species lakes, size bimodalities can arise as a result of cannibalism (svenning & borgstrøm 1995), through the active suppression of smaller-sized ﬁsh by larger conspeciﬁcs that preclude their recruit- ment to the dominant size-classes (johnson 1976), or via the interaction of mortality and growth schedules over long lifespan that produces a population contain- ing many small and large ﬁsh, but few medium-sized ﬁsh (power 1978). alternatively, size bimodality can arise because of phenotypic divergences associated with differential niche use (e.g., fraser et al. 2008). the number of available niches, however, is thought to be important for phenotypic divergence (e.g., hindar & jonsson 1982; sandlund et al. 1992), with the number of available niches being related to lake morphometry (riget et al. 2000). thus, the established occurrences of sympatric forms of arctic charr in canada have been limited to single-species lakes (parker & johnson 1991), large, deep, oligotrophic lakes (reist et al. 1995; o’connell & dempson 2002) or multi-basin lakes with complex habitat (saunders & power 1969). here, we summarise the available biological data on a size bimodal sample of arctic charr from lake aigneau, a moderately deep lake that lacks complex habitat, but which is characterised by a more diverse multi-species ﬁsh community than reported for the other canadian lakes where sympatric forms have been described. we use the data to test the prerequisite conditions for the maintenance of a population bimo- dality as described by power (1978), e.g., a single asymptotic growth curve and a survivorship schedule dominated by high juvenile mortality declining rapidly to low adult mortality. in addition, archived dorsal muscle-tissue samples are used to test the hypotheses that the differences in size are related to (i) genetic differences between the observed size-groupings and ⁄ or (ii) underpinned by a trophic polymorphism. material and methods study area and sampling information lake aigneau is located 235 m.a.s.l. on the ungava plateau of northern que´bec and encompasses an area of 54 km2. bathymetric maps (fig. 1) indicate a maximum depth in the range of 20 m, with only a small portion of lake volume below 15 m (approxi- mately 5%). the lake bottom is dominated by bedrock ecological and genetic differentiation in arctic charr fig. 1. location and bathymetric map of lake aigneau showing the position of the lake in the koksoak river drainage relative to ungava bay. areas of the lake at, or below, 10 m are shaded black. and varying boulder ⁄ cobble substrates in the northern end to a point where the lake is traversed by a series of moraine islands. in the southern end, where depths are typically <4 m, open sand substrates dominate. the lake is oligotrophic, with a mean summer ph of 6.5 )1. and a mean summer conductivity of 16.3 ls cm the lake supports a ﬁsh community composed of 10 species dominated by the salmonids (arctic charr, brook charr, salvelinus_fontinalis, and landlocked atlantic salmon, salmo_salar) that also includes two other terminal predators (burbot, lota lota; northern pike, esox lucius), a benthic specialist (longnose sucker, catostomus catostomus) and an assortment of littoral and pelagic forage ﬁshes (lake chub, couesius plumbeus; longnose dace, rhinichthys cataractae; slimy sculpin, cottus cognatus; and three-spine stick- leback, gasterosteus aculeatus). the lake lies just south of the 5 °c mean annual isotherm and records average july surface tempera- tures of 13.4 °c. the lake also lies on the border of the forest tundra and taiga vegetation zones (oliver 1960) dominated by black spruce, picea mariana; tamarack, larix laricina; and willow, salix spp., growing in low, damp habitats along the lake and tributary margins and lichens and low shrubs (e.g., cladonia, vaccinium) growing in higher, drier areas. underlying bedrock in the region consists of foliated granitic rocks and grantic gneiss with migmatites, undifferentiated gran- ites and pyroxene granitic rock in lesser abundance (gouvernment du que´bec 1984). the lake empties to the north-east via the aigneau river, a tributary of the larch river that ﬂows into southern ungava bay via the koksoak river. several steep gorge areas and high (>10 m) waterfalls prevent access to the lake by anadromous atlantic salmon and brook charr known to use the downstream koksoak–larch system (e.g., power 1969). fish sampling was completed 25 june–23 july 1996 in the lake at multiple littoral, profundal and pelagic sampling sites using gangs of multi-mesh gillnets (38– 89 mm bar mesh). littoral zone nets were generally set out in 0–5 m depths from a point on the shore as 12 h overnight sets. profundal nets were set at depths of 5–20 m, with effort expended in approximate proportion to the availability of those depths in the lake. pelagic nets (3 m panel depth) were set mid-lake at the surface in areas with depths >10 m. gillnets, seines (6 mm mesh) and minnow traps (6 mm) were also used to obtain representative forage ﬁsh samples from all littoral and profundal habitats. all ﬁsh were measured (cm), weighed (g), sexed, assessed for sexual maturity and dissected for stomach contents. otoliths were removed and retained for ageing by grinding and polishing for reading at magniﬁcation under reﬂected light. independent ageing analysis was completed at the ontario ministry of natural re- sources ﬁsh ageing facility in glenora, ontario. length and weight data were used to compute fulton’s condition factor (diana 2004). examination of stom- ach contents obtained from all ﬁsh was completed in 447 power et al. the ﬁeld, where fullness was assessed on the basis of volume and prey items were identiﬁed to the lowest practical level, usually order. samples of dorsal muscle tissue were obtained and preserved in a dmso ⁄ nacl solution for genetic analysis. owing to preservative limitations imposed by remote ﬁeld conditions, only a randomly selected subsample of apparent arctic charr groupings (n = 20) and forage ﬁsh (n = 4) had dorsal muscle tissue removed and preserved for stable isotope analysis. isotope methods dorsal muscle-tissue samples for stable isotope anal- ysis (sia) were dried at constant temperature, pulver- ised to a ﬁne powder using a retsch mm 2000 ball mill grinder (f. kurt retsch gmbh co., haan, germany) and weighed on a mettler ultra micro balance (readability 0.1 lg, mettler-toledo gmbh, greifensee, switzerland). all samples were analysed using a carlo erba elemental analyser (carlo erba, milan, italy) connected to a micromass vg isochrom continuous-ﬂow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (gv instruments ⁄ micromass, manchester, u.k.). machine analytical precision, respectively, for d13c and d15n was 0.2& and 0.3& and was determined by repeat analysis (n = 25) of laboratory working standards cross-calibrated to international atomic energy agency standards ch6 for d13c and n1 and n2 for d15n. all resulting measurements are expressed using standard delta notation as parts per thousand differ- ences (&) with respect to the international reference standards, carbonate rock from the peedee belemnite formation d13c (craig 1957) and nitrogen gas in the atmosphere for d15n (mariotti 1983). percent c and n composition of all samples measured coincident with the completion of sia are reported as obtained from the elemental analyser. genetic methods dorsal muscle-tissue samples for genetic analysis were stored in a 20% dmso ⁄ nacl solution and kept frozen until dna extraction. total genomic dna was extracted from muscle tissue using the commercial kit, geneluteô mammalian genomic dna miniprep kit (sigma-aldrich co., st louis, mo, usa). for mitochondrial dna (mtdna) analysis, a total of 941 bases in the mtdna control region (d-loop) were pcr ampliﬁed and sequenced following methods detailed in brown gladden et al. (1995), with the following modiﬁcations. the entire mtdna control region was ampliﬁed with primers tpro2 (brunner et al. 2001) and salpcrr (5¢-ggg tcc atc tta aca gct tca-3¢), also used as the sequencing primer for the right domain. the left domain was sequenced with primer 448 char3 (5¢-ccc tat gca tat aag aga acg c-3¢). direct sequencing of the d-loop pcr product was accomplished using the applied biosystems big dyeò terminator v3.1 terminator cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). the resulting sequence reaction products were then run on an applied biosystems 3100 genetic analyser (applied biosystems, usa). sequences were aligned to a reference sample with seqscapeò v2.5 (applied biosystems, usa) software and haplotypes assigned. one representative of each haplotype was veriﬁed by sequencing the complement dna strand with tpro2 for the left domain and primer salint (5¢-cct ttc agc ttg cat ata caa g-3¢) for the right domain. dna samples were further assayed for allelic variation at 12 microsatellite loci (table 1). one primer for each ‘tailed’ primer pair (brownstein et al. 1996) was end labelled with one of three ﬂuorescent dyes: 6-fam (sco19, salf56sfu, mst85, sfo8, sfo23), vic (sale38sfu, sald39sfu, ssa422, sal5, salf81sfu) and ned (sa72zim and ssa85). pcr ampliﬁcations were carried out in 10-ll reaction volumes containing approximately 50 ng genomic dna, 10x pcr gold buffer (applied biosystems, usa), 1.5 mm mgcl2, 200 lm each dntp, 0.5 lm each primer and 1 u taq polymerase (applied bio- systems, usa), using cycling parameters as outlined in valsecchi & amos (1996) and lundrigan et al. (2005). all loci were ampliﬁed separately but run on an applied biosystems 3100 genetic analyzer as pairs (sale38sfu with sfo23, sfo8 and sal5, sco19 and salf81sfu, mst85 and ssa422, ssa85 and sal- f56sfu, and sa72zim with sald39sfu). gene- mapperò software version 3.7 (applied biosystems, usa) was then used to score microsatellite alleles. statistical methods maximal type-i error rates in all statistical analyses were set at a = 0.05. the normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions required of statistical methods were checked using the shapiro–wilk w and f statistics before the completion of all analyses (draper & smith 1981). to establish the prerequisites for the emergence of a size bimodality in population structure as described in power (1978), length and age data were used to estimate length–weight and von berta- lanffy growth models for each modal size-group of arctic charr, using linear and nonlinear regression techniques (draper & smith 1981; bates & watts 1988). procedures for testing for signiﬁcant differ- ences between linear and nonlinear regression lines were applied as described in draper & smith (1981) and haddon (2001). associations between sex, size, age and maturity in each modal size-group were tested table 1. microsatellite primers used in this study. ecological and genetic differentiation in arctic charr locus mst85 sal5 sale38sfu sald39sfu salf56sfu salf81sfu sal72zim sco19 sfo8 sfo23 ssa85 ssa422 primer sequence (5¢–3¢) f: ggaaggaagggagaaaggt* r: ggaaaatcaatactaacaa f: tttgcattgagcctctgttg* r: tgtttcagctgctattaggaaat f: cgccttgtcatacattacacc* r: acgctacagaaacaggagaaag f: ggggagtctgtgttaagttgg* r: tgaatggacgttcctctgac f: tgcagttccacaatatatccc* r: aagggcacactcagattttg f: cagcataatcactcccgc* r: gaaagctaccttgcgtgc f: aacttcaagatatatgatgt* r: attcgtttagtctgagaa f: cttgaaattagttaaacagc* r: ccaaactacccaataatc f: caacgagcacagaacagg* r: cttcccctggagaggaaa f: gtgttcttttctcagccc r: aatgagcgttacgagagg* f: aggtgggtcctccaagctac r: gtttcttacccgctcctcacttaatc* f: ttatgggcgtccacctct r: caccccagcctcctcaaccttc* annealing temperature (°c) reference 50 48 ⁄ 53 50 48 ⁄ 53 50 48 ⁄ 53 45 ⁄ 53 50 55 55 48 ⁄ 53 55 presa & guyomard (1996) r. danzmann (pers. comm.) mcgowan et al.

fisher’s exact test was used to establish the signiﬁcance of observed differences in modal size-group sex ratios (zar 1999). mortality estimates obtained from age-grouped data for each modal size-group were estimated and tested for signiﬁcant differences following robson & chap- man (1961). the genetic differences hypothesis was tested by treating modal size-groups as separate populations. mitochondrial dna sequence variation between the two modal size-groups was estimated by haplotype diversity (nei & tajima 1981) and nucleotide diversity (nei 1987) calculated with arlequin version 2.0 (schneider et al. 2000). pairwise population differenti- ation based on haplotype frequencies between popula- tions was completed using genepop version 3.4 (raymond & rousset 1995). the genetic variation within the modal size-groups was determined with an analysis of molecular variance (amova) calculated with arlequin version 2.0. the software program struc- ture2.2 (pritchard et al. 2000; falush et al. 2007) was used to evaluate subpopulation structure and for assignment analysis, using a burn-in length of 50,000 iterations, a run length of 50,000 and replicated 20 times using k values of 1–5. analysis was based on examining sample genotypes without speciﬁc prior knowledge of structure. evaluation of the microsatellite loci for null alleles, allele stutter and allele dropout were performed with micro-checker (van oosterhout et al. 2004). evidence of linkage disequilibrium for all pairs of loci and deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium for each locus and population combination were examined using genepop. the number of alleles per locus, observed heterozygosity (ho), gene diversity (he) and inbreeding co-efﬁcient (f) were computed using fstat version 2.9.3.2 (goudet 1995) and arlequin version 2.0. estimates of allelic richness, corrected for minimal sampling size (kalinowski 2004), were measured using hp-rare 1.0 (kalinowski 2005). population differen- tiation was assessed by testing genotypic differentiation between each microsatellite locus and across all loci. the probability test was calculated with fisher’s exact test through 1000 iterations using the markov-chain method in genepop. population pairwise fst values (conner & hartl 2004) across all loci were also calculated with genepop. partitioning of genetic vari- ance was accomplished using the hierarchical amova routine in arlequin version 2.0. the trophic polymorphism hypothesis was tested using two-sample t-tests, adjusted for equality of variances as judged by an f-test, to determine signiﬁcant differences between the sia signatures of individuals from each of the modal size-groups. differences in sia–length relationships were further described and tested using linear regression tech- niques. diet overlap between modal size-groupings and other resident salmonids was assessed using horn’s index (horn 1966). mean modal size-group percentage c and n muscle-tissue composition was assessed and compared with other canadian arctic for which data existed (lake charr populations hazen, guiguer et al. 2002; lakes tasiapik and 449 power et al. franc¸oys-malherbe, g. power, unpublished data) using tukey’s hsd test (zar 1999). finally, the program isosource (phillips & gregg 2003) was used to estimate the likely importance of prey ﬁshes in the diet of ﬁsh from the larger-sized modal group. the program uses mass balance-mixing models to provide ranges of possible prey isotope contributions to the isotopic mixture represented by the consumer isotope signature when the number of prey sources is larger than the number of unique isotope measures available (phillips & gregg 2003). source increments and mass balance tolerance set- tings, respectively, of 1% and ±0.05% and trophic fractionation assumptions as described in post (2002) were used in completing the analysis. results habitat choice and phenotypic differences most ﬁsh species were captured in the littoral zone at depths £5 m. some atlantic salmon were captured in the pelagic zone, but direct occupancy of the pelagic zone appeared to be low on the basis of net captures. only arctic charr and burbot were captured at depth (>15 m). a total of 76 arctic charr were captured and were distinguishable on the basis of the location of capture, size and body form (table 2). within the length–frequency distribution, there were modes, respectively, in the 21–22 and 60–64 cm ranges (fig. 2a). fish from the smaller-sized modal group were captured exclusively in littoral zone nets in £5 m of water, whereas ﬁsh from the larger-sized modal group were largely (18 of 20) captured in profundal nets in >15 m of water, with the remaining two individuals captured at approximately 10 m. accordingly, there was no habitat overlap between the modal size groups, hereafter referred to as littoral for individuals from the smaller modal size group and profundal for individuals from the larger modal size group. there was a signiﬁcant difference between littoral and profundal mean lengths (t = )17.38, d.f. = 19.6, p < 0.001) d.f. = 19.5, p < 0.001). catches of

exact, p = 0.489) and no association between group mem- bership and maturity (v2 = 0.11, d.f. = 1, p = 0.732), with 50% of all individuals examined in either modal size group being sexually mature, maturing or spent. among the littoral ﬁsh, 50% of all individuals were mature by age 4, whereas among profundal ﬁsh 50% maturation was not observed until age 11. independent age assignments agreed in 99% of all cases and yielded modal that overlapped only at age 6 (fig. 2b). the maximal age for littoral ﬁsh was 6 years and the maximal age for profundal ﬁsh was 21 years. size group age distributions littoral and profundal individuals were distinctively different in terms of body form and colouration and, therefore, were kept separate in all subsequent genetic and stable isotope analyses. littoral individuals were exclusively <26 mm in size with terete body forms and dark grey dorsal and white, or slightly reddish– pink ventral colouration. blue–red lateral spotting and prominent residual parr markings further distinguished littoral individuals. profundal individuals exhibited a more robust, deep-bodied form dominated by a large head, dorsal hump and light green dorsal and white ventral colouration. yellow- and⁄ or pink-coloured lateral spotting and prominent white leading edge anal ﬁns were also evident on most specimens. apparent differences in body form were reﬂected in signiﬁcant differences in condition factor (t = )7.82, d.f. = 22, p < 0.001), with the mean condition factor of littoral and profundal ﬁsh, respectively, equalling 0.816 and 1.090. intercepts littoral and profundal length–weight relationships had similar slopes (t = )0.97, d.f. = 72, p = 0.335) but (t = )2.94, in differed signiﬁcantly d.f. = 72, p = 0.004). isometric growth (wootton 1998) predominated in both littoral and profundal ﬁsh, with p > 0.286 for all tests of signiﬁcant differences between the regression estimated length–weight slope coefﬁcient and the theoretical value of three indicative of isometric growth. estimated von bertalanffy growth models were statistically signiﬁcant (all regression p < 0.001) and differed signiﬁcantly (f = 9.46, d.f.1 =

char (19 littoral and 20 profundal ﬁsh). of the 507 bases sequenced, no variation was seen between individuals or between littoral and profundal ﬁsh and no further analysis was completed on the sequence data from the region. the sequence was deposited with genbank under acces- sion number eu310899. the right domain of the control region was sequenced for 56 samples (39 littoral, 17

deposited in genbank under accession numbers fj664397–fj664404. littoral ﬁsh exhibited greater variation (seven haplotypes) than profundal ﬁsh (two haplotypes). haplotype arch01 occurred in both forms of arctic charr but at substantially different frequencies. for the littoral ﬁsh six additional haplo- types were observed, with arch03 occurring in 50% of examined individuals. the remaining ﬁve haplo- types were found only in a single individual. profundal ﬁsh yielded only a single additional haplotype found in two individuals. pairwise differentiation tests based on haplotype frequency indicated that the littoral and profundal ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly different from one another (p < 0.05). amova indicated that 66.6% of the genetic variation occurred within the identiﬁed groups. microsatellite loci for littoral arctic charr generally exhibited higher heterozygosity and allelic richness compared with profundal ﬁsh (table 4). no deviations from hardy–weinberg expectations were observed and there was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium between any of the studied loci. pairwise tests based on genotypic differentiation indicated signiﬁcant table 3. alignment of the

supported the initial separation of the arctic charr by size and habitat occupancy and suggested the presence of two populations. littoral and profundal samples assigned correctly to their respective

is repre- sented by a vertical line partitioned into coloured segments identifying assignment probability estimates to each cluster. most individuals were estimated to have almost all of their ancestry from a single population. molecular variation occurred within the littoral and profundal groupings and 15.9% between the group- ings. to determine whether genetic variance between the littoral and profundal samples was due to the inﬂuence of samples exhibiting haplotypes other than the single- shared haplotype (arch01), analysis of those sam- ples exhibiting haplotype arch01 was performed. estimates of allelic richness, observed and expected heterozygosity and inbreeding coefﬁcient were gener- ally similar to those of the complete littoral group (data not shown). pairwise genotypic differentiation across all loci (p < 0.001) and fst estimates (0.188) further indicated divergence between the two groups as above. ecological differences stomach content analysis provided evidence of differ- ential feeding patterns between littoral and profundal ﬁsh. chironomid larvae and pupae dominated in the diet of littoral ﬁsh and were found in 73.2% of all examined stomachs. coleoptera (21.4%), trichoptera (21.4%) and diptera, largely adult simuliidae, (17.9%) were also commonly found. ephemeroptera (7.1%), hemiptera (7.1%), plecoptera (3.6%) and molluscs, other insects and sticklebacks (1.8%) accounted for the remaining dietary items. among the profundal ﬁsh, 18 of 20 examined stomachs were empty and showed no evidence of recent feeding. the proximal and distal limbs of the stomachs were constricted and tightly knotted. there was no trace of gastric secretions and all examined intestines were completely evacuated. ecological and genetic differentiation in arctic charr the two smallest profundal ﬁsh captured at approx- imately 10 m showed evidence of incidental feeding, having consumed between them a total of three molluscs (gastropods), a single stickleback, a few adult simuliidae and an ephemeroptera. the predominance of empty stomachs in large profundal individuals precluded computation of a dietary overlap index to compare littoral and profundal ﬁsh. comparison of littoral arctic charr diets with those of lake resident brook charr and atlantic salmon indicated low dietary overlap with brook charr (horn’s index = 0.267) and moderate overlap with atlantic salmon (horn’s index = 0.559). stable isotope signatures, d13c and d15n, were signiﬁcantly higher in profundal arctic charr than in littoral conspeciﬁcs (fig. 4). there was overlap in the range of d13c values, but no overlap in d15n values. the mean littoral and profundal isotope signatures t = )2.87, (table 6) differed signiﬁcantly (d13c: t = )22.71, d.f. = 38, d.f. = 38, p = 0.007; d15n: p < 0.001). littoral arctic charr recorded the broadest range of carbon values (2.1& vs. 1.6&), whereas profundal ﬁsh recorded the broadest range of nitrogen values (1.9& vs. 1.3&). isotope signature variances (d13c: f = 1.72, within each group were similar d.f.1 = 20, d.f.2 = 20, p = 0.248; d15n: f = 2.29, d.f.1 = 20, d.f.2 = 20, p = 0.079). in both littoral and profundal

differed signiﬁcantly between littoral and profundal arctic charr (t = )3.45, d.f. = 38, p = 0.001). comparison of mean %n values obtained from littoral and profundal arctic charr in lake aigneau to

(t-test, p £ 0.001) and from the lake chub, longnose dace and longnose sucker group in d15n (t-test, p = 0.002), but not from the slimy sculpin and stickleback group in d15n (t-test, p = 0.144). tests also indicated that profundal arctic char differed signiﬁcantly from both forage ﬁsh groups on the d13c and d15n axes (t-test p £ 0.002). in combination with the program isosource (phillips & gregg 2003), prey ﬁsh signatures implied heavy reliance by profundal arctic charr on littoral arctic charr as a prey source (table 7), with moderate reliance on sticklebacks and little, or no, reliance on other available prey forage ﬁshes. discussion data presented here do not corroborate the prerequisite conditions for the maintenance of a single population size-bimodality as described by power (1978), with differential mortality and asymptotic growth curves prevailing for each of the identiﬁed modal size-groups (littoral and profundal). in addition, littoral longevity is restricted to approximately 6 years, too short a period for the interplay of growth and mortality schedules to yield an accumulation of individuals within a larger modal size-class as described in power (1978). tests of tissues, however, yielded evidence supporting the hypotheses of genetic and ecological bases for observed differences, with higher overall genetic diversity and less inbreeding observed in littoral arctic charr than in profundal ﬁsh. stable isotope data indicated distinctive feeding strategies, with a mean separation of approximately one trophic level indicative of the use of littoral arctic charr as a prey resource by profundal conspeciﬁcs. further corroboration of ecological differences between the observed modal size groups was provided by the large differences in adult mortality, asymptotic body size and noted differences in habitat occupancy. signiﬁcant within lake differences in arctic charr have been described elsewhere in canada (parker & johnson 1991; reist et al. 1995), but only one lake has provided the detailed weight of evidence for differ- ences in identiﬁed size-groupings found in lake aigneau. in gander lake, both ecological and genetic evidence exists for the separation of identiﬁed ‘‘pale’’ and ‘‘dark’’ forms (o’connell & dempson (2002); gomez-uchida et al. 2008) that differentially use littoral and profundal habitats and for which there is evidence of form divergence having occurred prior to the last glaciation (gomez-uchida et al. 2008). in contrast to gander lake, and the typical pattern observed elsewhere, where the small form is an energetically limited inhabitant of deep water and the larger form is an occupant of littoral or pelagic habitats (hindar & jonsson 1982; jonsson & jonsson 2001), the profundal ﬁsh in lake aigneau are the larger of the identiﬁed sympatric size-groupings. genetic differences between the littoral and profun- dal arctic charr in lake aigneau may have arisen through various mechanisms. the ﬁsh community within the lake is complex, including representatives of preferentially anadromous species, such as atlantic salmon, and species that could only have been included in the lake community via headwater recapture, such as northern pike and lake chub (legendre & legendre 1984). community composi- tions, therefore, suggests two possible routes of entry into the lake for arctic charr, with colonisation from proto-glacial lakes having possibly occurred from the south via headwater capture during the retreat of the laurentian icecap (legendre & legendre 1984) or via upstream migration from the koksoak–larch river system prior to the isolation of lake aigneau via isostatic rebound. observed genetic differences accord with the possibility of different allopatric origins for littoral and profundal ﬁsh, with lower observed levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the individ- uals analysed indicating the possibility of a more recent colonisation history in the lake by the profundal ﬁsh. some evidence also exists for the creation of a genetic bottleneck through the founder effect, as suggested by the loss of genetic diversity, lower estimates of allelic richness, and generally lower heterozygosity and haplotype diversity found in the profundal ﬁsh. differences in inbreeding between the littoral and profundal ﬁsh also suggest the possibility of a single colonisation event, with the development of different but stable feeding niches under conditions of intense intraspeciﬁc competition (jonsson & jonsson 2001) in the early postglacial history of the lake. differential maturation schedules may also have reinforced ecological and genetic differentiation in arctic charr tendencies to size-assortment by habitat and increased propensities for size-selective mating that led to the accumulation of genetic differences over time. the extent and pattern of the genetic separation found here does not allow distinguishing between the alternative explanations of allopatric diversiﬁcation prior to colonisation or common origin followed by ecologi- cally driven sympatric diversiﬁcation, but does indi- cate a clear difference between the littoral and profundal arctic charr that may be the prelude to speciation. although the prevalence of empty stomachs in the profundal ﬁsh was surprising (90%) and did not provide direct observation of profundal feeding habits, the availability of potential prey ﬁsh stable isotope signatures permitted the use of multi-source isotope mass balance approaches (phillips & gregg 2003) for inferring % dietary combinations that were consistent with the measured mean stable isotope values of profundal arctic charr. competing piscivores (burbot, northern pike) were not considered as likely prey, having never been recorded as prey items in canadian waters (e.g., scott & crossman 1973; johnson 1980). atlantic salmon, which only occur in the adult form in the lake, were ruled out as potential prey on the basis of size (minimum 27 cm) and preferential habitat use, with the majority of lake captured salmon being taken in the upper pelagic zone and the majority of all juvenile salmon being captured in the rifﬂe and rapid areas of the inlet and outlet river. co-occurring brook charr were found in low abundance in the size range likely to be target prey (<25 cm), with most of the smaller brook charr being captured in the immediate vicinity of the outlet river. brook charr juveniles occurred in large number in the main exit and entry rivers in proximity to suitable spawning sites and ⁄ or deep pools where over-wintering is possible (e.g., power 1980). lake chub, longnose dace, longnose sucker, slimy sculpin and three-spine stickleback, however, were all considered potential prey on the basis of size and ⁄ or probable use of the lake for over-wintering. isotopic separation patterns are strongly suggestive of a predator–prey relationship of profundal on littoral arctic charr. within the bounds of fractionation in isotopic signatures considered likely as a result of prey consumption (d13c = 0.04&, d15n = 3.2&; post 2002), mass balance computations also suggest littoral arctic charr form the largest single contribution to the diet of profundal ﬁsh, with three-spine stickleback as a second signiﬁcant contributory source (table 7). although small contributions from lake chub, long- nose dace, longnose sucker and slimy sculpin are considered feasible in the mass balance computations, in a large number of isosource feasible solutions (36– 77%), the dietary contribution from these prey was 455 power et al. longnose dace, very low (<5%). when combined with literature- reported predation patterns, modelled isosource stable isotope results suggest only incidental use of lake chub, longnose sucker and slimy sculpin as prey. stomach contents found in the other lacustrine piscivores also accorded with the suggested separation in resource use, with burbot and northern pike having consumed lake chub, longnose dace, longnose sucker, slimy sculpin and a single brook charr. the importance of cannibalism and three-spine stickleback consumption have been reported else- where, with three-spine sticklebacks having been implicated as important in determining ﬂuctuations in arctic charr abundance (gudbergsson 2004), vari- ations in arctic charr growth rates (klemetsen et al. 2002) and of increasing dietary importance as arctic charr increase in size (o’connell and dempson 2002). cannibalism is widespread in ﬁshes (smith & reay 1991) and commonly reported among arctic charr (e.g., skreslet 1973; sparholt 1985; riget et al. 1986; svenning & borgstrøm 1995). cannibalism has been postulated as the mechanism responsible for main- taining size bimodalities in lacustrine allopatric pop- ulations (e.g., johnson 1983; svenning & borgstrøm 1995). in high arctic lentic systems, seasonal prey shortages and slow juvenile growth in association with ﬁtness components (e.g., fecundity) that favour large body size have been implicated in inducing cannibal- ism (svenning & borgstrøm 1995; hammar 2000). in lake aigneau, there is little evidence of the food shortages characteristic of high arctic systems. although the lake is oligotrophic, and does not support a large amount of autochthonous production (oliver 1960), there is a varied ﬁsh community (10 species) that includes two other species relying heavily on piscivory in adult life stages (burbot and northern pike). the presence of multiple piscivorous ﬁshes does not point to a lake ecosystem with a low resource base, a fact substantiated by an average stomach fullness of 27.9% in the 164 ﬁsh stomachs sampled from all species. to the allopatric populations studied on svalbard (svenning & borgstrøm 1995; hammar 2000), cannibalism in lake aigneau proba- bly reinforces rather than causes the observed size bimodality. in contrast stomach condition, high condition factor and evi- dence of lower muscle tissue %n levels in profundal arctic charr, however, point to a differential pattern of prey resource use dominated by winter cannibalism followed by summer fasting. constricted stomachs, empty intestinal tracts and the lack of evidence of digestive secretions indicate a substantive period of fasting in profundal ﬁsh prior to capture. although piscivorous ﬁshes have a high incidence of empty stomachs when sampled, stomachs are typically ﬂacid 456 with visible evidence of digestive secretions. summer sampling in the ungava territory coincides with the intensive feeding period for ﬁsh and evidence of feeding activity and condition recovering from a period of winter fasting is normally expected. even without evidence of recent feeding the condition factor of profundal arctic charr (1.09) was signiﬁcantly higher than for littoral ﬁsh and differed signiﬁcantly from the average condition factor of other represen- tative salmonids in the lake (atlantic salmon, 0.92; brook charr, 1.02). the evidence of feeding patterns from gut examination does not accord with measured condition unless profundal arctic charr captured in july had fed extensively during the winter and were entering a period of summer fast. additional evidence of summer fasting is provided by noted differences in muscle tissue %n in profundal arctic charr when compared with other northern lacustrine populations of arctic charr for which data were available (fig. 5). continuous loss of n associ- ated with maintenance metabolism in fasting ﬁsh would lower tissue %n over time. patterns of n loss through ammonia and urea excretion in starved ﬁsh have shown rapid declines to a constant rate and an increase in the per cent of n lost as urea (elliott 1976; guerin-ancey 1976). when compared with the rate of n loss in continuously fed ﬁsh, the rate of n loss in fasting ﬁsh is substantive. for example, in fasting rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), average daily production (nh4, no2 + no3) from fasting ﬁsh have been estimated to equal 30% of the level recorded for continuously fed ﬁsh (van weerd et al. 1995). n excretion in starved ﬁsh is also positively related to body weight and temperature in phoxinus phoxinus (cui & wootton 1988) and salmo_trutta (elliott 1976) and associated with an overall decline in energy content (kj ⁄ g) in whole-body tissue (van weerd et al. 1995). nitrogenous of compounds fasting ﬁsh will meet maintenance metabolic demands through the catabolism of stored lipid and protein reserves. in salmonids, the proportion of daily energy ration available for metabolism and growth increases at combinations of reduced maximal ration and temperature (elliott 1976). occupancy of the cold profundal zone (<5 °c) during summer fasting would reduce body temperature and associated metabolic demands. occupancy of the profundal zone in winter offers similar metabolic advantages, but increased prey availability. much of the lake aigneau basin is shallow (<5 m) and not suitable for over-wintering. deep-water refugia within the lake basin are limited (fig. 1) and winter freeze-up would have the effect of concentrating potential prey at depth in the habitats occupied by profundal arctic charr. as a foraging strategy, therefore, winter-feeding promises reduced search and capture costs and associated increases in surplus energy for somatic growth likely to result in larger bodied ﬁsh, as has been found for northern pike (hart & connellan 1984). the exact nature of the causal mechanism that gave rise to the noted differences in body size and seasonal- feeding preferences remains unknown. size variation may result from documented genetic differences leading to differential growth rates and the require- ment for profundal arctic charr to exploit ontogenetic niche shift as a means of counteracting the diminishing energy surpluses associated with occupancy of the littoral zone (e.g., forseth et al. 1994). genetically determined differences in maturation may also have induced higher growth rates and resulted in the larger profundal body size, as has been found for atlantic salmon (e.g., thorpe 1986). the energetic costs of higher growth would require continued use of cooler, deeper-waters as a means of reducing metabolic costs and increasing feeding efﬁciency. size-dependent habitat ontogenetic niche shifts have been shown to successfully counteract size-dependent diminishing energy surpluses, thereby sustaining growth rate possibilities for faster growing individuals. for exam- ple, segregation has been documented for lake høysjøen, norway, and inter- preted to partially arise from the effect of diminishing energy surpluses with size (forseth et al. 1994). on the basis of the evidence available here, we believe a similar mechanism may have resulted in the emer- gence of the size and habitat differences found in lake aigneau. genetically different, fast-growing ﬁsh driven to depth to offset reductions in available energy with size would face foraging restrictions as a result of the sparse benthic community in the deeper parts of the lake. in contrast to lake høysjøen, where arctic charr are able to exploit available zoobenthos, resource scarcity at depth in lake aigneau would result in the low adult densities found in the lake. the resulting resource bottleneck would force a scramble competi- tion for available summer resources, the intensity of which would be reduced by the adoption of winter- feeding strategies when resource availability at depth rises in connection with prey ﬁsh seeking winter refugia. in this context, it is signiﬁcant to note that the smallest of the profundal ﬁsh do not appear to be able to fast all summer and are forced to feed incidentally. although we were unable to capture juveniles at depth, one suspects towards summer feeding. similar propensities acknowledgements support for the work was provided by
