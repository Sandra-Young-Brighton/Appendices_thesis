agostinho et al. 2004) and temperate (e.g., copp 1989; sparks et al. 1998; king et al. 2003) river systems. floodplain water bodies play an essential role in these systems. both parapotamic backwaters (connected permanently with the main channel) and plesiopotamic oxbows (connected with the main channel only during inun- dation periods) are important nursery areas (e.g., sheaffer & nickum 1986; scott & nielsen 1989; grift et al. 2001; penczak et al. 2003), primarily for ﬁsh that spawn on vegetation (i.e., phytophilic species sensu balon 1975). the channelisation and diking of ﬂoodplain rivers has decreased the physical diversity of these river systems, with much of the surrounding ﬂood plain and water bodies separated from the main channel and its ﬂood (neumann et al. 1996; cowx & welcomme 1998). loss of lateral connectivity adversely affects the reproduction of many (primarily phytophilic) ﬁshes (nunn et al. 2007b). artiﬁcial ﬂoodplain water bodies are suggested as convenient substitute biotopes, performing the same ecological role as natural water bodies that have been lost following river regulation (e.g., staas & neumann 1994; nunn et al. 2007b). floodplain borrow pits excavated during dike construction could serve as such surrogates for natural plesiopotamic oxbows (sabo & kelso 1991). these permanent plesiopotamic water bodies in the ﬂood- plain may play a crucial role for 0+ ﬁsh survival after ﬂood waters have receded (halyk & balon 1983). former research has demonstrated the importance of borrow pits for the presence (halacˇka et al. 1998) and reproduction (bartosˇova´ et al. 2001) of phytophilic and phyto-lithophilic ﬁsh. however, ﬁsh reproduction can be signiﬁcantly restricted in some borrow pits that 644 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00449.x lack shelters and shallow littoral zone (jurajda et al. 2004; rysˇava´-nova´kova´ et al. 2009). flooded terres- trial vegetation seems to be particularly important for the reproductive success at these sites (jurajda et al. 2004). the degree to which the ﬂood regime and other mechanisms affect ﬁsh assemblage dynamics is still unknown at these sites. deeper knowledge of these mechanisms is necessary for the proper assessment of importance of borrow pits. here, we evaluated the importance of several factors supposed to inﬂuence ﬁsh reproduction in borrow pits in the ﬂoodplain of a dyje river (czech republic, danube basin). we considered factors that were reported to inﬂuence 0+ ﬁsh assemblages in rivers and natural ﬂoodplains: ﬂood regime (ﬂood duration, ﬂood timing, ﬂood coincidence with high water temperatures; e.g., king et al. 2003; schramm & eggleton 2006), physical characteristics of water bodies (sabo & kelso 1991; tales & berrebi 2007) and density of spawners and predators (e.g., copp 1989; bailly et al. 2008). the main aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of the ﬂood regime (mainly ﬂood dura- tion) and the inﬂuence of site physical characteristics on 0+ ﬁsh density and diversity. flood at the studied sites was important mainly because ﬂooded terrestrial vegetation provided spawning substrate for phyto- philic and phyto-lithophilic ﬁsh and shelters for 0+ to habitat conditions within the ﬁsh, borrow pits. therefore, we hypothesised that the density and diversity of 0+ ﬁshes from june to october and the density and diversity of 1+ ﬁshes the following year (recruitment effect) would be posi- tively correlated with ﬂood duration and the number of spawners and negatively correlated with the number of predators. in contrast material and methods study area the construction of study sites were situated in the lowest section of the ﬂoodplain of the river dyje in the czech republic (0.0–10.0 river km; fig. 1). most water bodies available to ﬁsh as nursery areas were lost after channelisation of the river dyje during the 1970s, and natural ﬂoods in the study area were eliminated because of reservoirs 45 km upstream of the study sites during the 1980s. all six borrow pits under study were created in 1983–1985 when ﬂood protective dikes were built from excavated ﬂoodplain material. the sites are 320–930 m away from the river bank, ﬁve of them in the active ﬂoodplain (in front of protective dikes) and one (sˇ picmaus) in the passive ﬂoodplain (behind the protective dikes) (fig. 1;

barusˇ & oliva 1995). consequently, we estimated the number of ﬂooded days having a temperature ‡16 °c, subsequently referred to as ‘ﬂood duration’. non-0+ (1 year and older) ﬁsh were sampled once a year in october 2001–2004 using a beach seine (40 m length, 10 mm mesh size) at 2–12 locations (according to site size) in each borrow pit (table 2). the area covered by each seine was estimated, and non-0+ ﬁsh density was expressed as number of ﬁsh per hectare. fish were identiﬁed to species, measured to the nearest 1 mm (standard length, sl) and released back into the borrow pit from which they were taken. the 0+ ﬁsh were sampled in june, july, august and october 2001–2004 and 2006 (table 2). a small beach seine (5 m long, 1 mm mesh size) was primarily used for 0+ ﬁsh sampling. two larger beach seines (10 m long, 1 mm mesh size and 15 m long, 4 mm mesh size) were used in july–october in response to possible movement of older 0+ ﬁsh to deeper water (table 2). the number of hauls conducted with each seine net in a particular month did not differ among years and was similar among the sites. data for semi- quantitative comparisons (number of 0+ specimens per 1 m seine) were treated as catch per unit effort (cpue). the 0+ juvenile ﬁsh were euthanized with anaesthetics (clove oil), preserved in 4% formaldehyde and identiﬁed and measured to the nearest 1 mm (sl) in the laboratory. fishes were classiﬁed according to the reproductive guild as suggested by balon (1975). data analysis length–frequency distributions (combined with litera- ture comparisons, barusˇ & oliva 1995) were used to separate 0+, 1+ and ‡2+ age groups of ﬁsh in seine samples. the reproductive potential of most of the sampling year seine net length age month 2001 2002 2003 2004 2006 5 m 10 m 15 m 40 m 0+ 0+ 0+ 0+ non-0+ june july august october october 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5  4à 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 8–12 4–8 4–8 4–8 0 0 2–6 0 0 0 0 0 2–6 2–6 0 0 0 0 0 2–12 table 2. sampling schedule and nets used for sampling of ﬁsh assemblages at the six sites during 2001–2006. for each sampling, the table presents the number of sites sampled in individual year (2001–2006) and number hauls conducted by each type of seine net. age – targeted age group of ﬁsh sampled.  missing site: melanbon. àmissing sites: melanbon, sˇ trosﬂek. 646 sampled 1+ ﬁsh was questionable. we therefore primarily considered 2+ and older ﬁsh (depending on the size and species, according to the literature sources; barusˇ & oliva 1995) as spawners in this study. length– frequency distributions and literature comparisons (pinder 2001) were also used to identify newly hatched ﬁsh, referring to individuals that are small (<15–20 mm sl, depending on the species) and that belong to the same or lower size group as did the smallest individuals of the species in the previous month. separate analyses were conducted for the most abundant cyprinid species: phytophilic rudd scardi- nius erythrophthalmus, white bream abramis bjoerkna and prussian carp carassius gibelio, and phyto- lithophilic roach rutilus rutilus and bream abramis brama. no 0+ species occurred regularly at all sites in all years, and therefore these ﬁve species were pooled together to strengthen the analyses, hereafter referred as the ‘c-phyt’ group. separate analyses were also conducted for ostracophilic bitterling rhodeus amarus (cyprinidae) and phyto-lithophilic perch perca ﬂuvia- tilis (percidae). dunn-sˇ ida´k corrections of signiﬁcance levels were used to decrease the probability of com- mitting a type i error (sokal & rohlf 1995) in multiple testing (critical p-value for eight repeats = 0.0064). varying ﬂood regime, habitat conditions and ﬁsh assemblages created unique environment for ﬁsh reproduction in every year at each site. therefore, we considered the samples from each site in each year as independent (see also ondracˇkova´ et al. 2004). the density of 0+ ﬁsh was log-transformed (ln[x + 1]) to reach normality and comply with requirements of the tests. multiple linear forward stepwise model) were used to determine the inﬂuence of several predictors on the following ﬁsh assemblage parameters: density of 0+ ﬁsh (in june, july, august and october), number of 0+ ﬁsh species (in october), shannon diversity index and evenness (h¢ and e, respectively; krebs 1989; both in october), number of ﬁsh species spawned during the season (calculated as number of 0+ ﬁsh species caught during the season) and density of 1+ ﬁsh in the following year (table 3). regressions (mlr, table 3. variables entering the multiple regres- sion analyses. predictors assigned x were con- explaining particular sidered in the models response variable. in analyses explaining ﬁsh densities (catch per unit effort [cpue]), separate models were conducted for each of seven species and the c-phyt group of species (results are shown in table 5). other response variables: number of 0+ species (0+ s), 0+ ﬁsh shannon diversity index and evenness (0+ h¢ and e, respectively) and number of 0+ species spawned during the season (spec. spawned). response variable 0+ cpue 0+ cpue 0+ cpue 0+ cpue 1+ cpue 0+ s 0+ h¢ 0+ e spec. spawned date june july august october following season october october october june–october fish reproduction in ﬂoodplain water bodies the following factors were considered as possible predictors: the density of spawners and spawner species richness, the density of predators and ﬂood duration (table 3, see further). non-0+ perch, pike- perch stizostedion lucioperca, pike esox lucius and asp aspius aspius were considered as possible ﬁsh predators (pooled together, hereafter referred as ‘non- 0+ predators’). despite the small size, 0+ perch and 0+ pikeperch are also reported to be potential predators of 0+ ﬁsh (van densen et al. 1996; beeck et al. 2002). therefore, the density of 0+ ﬁsh of these two species (pooled together, hereafter referred as ‘0+ predators’) was considered to inﬂuence the density of 0+ ﬁsh in months following july. for each monthly sample, the ﬂood duration was calculated as the number of days with ﬂood and water temperature ‡16 °c from the ﬁrst day when water temperature was 16 °c up to the day of sampling (e.g., up to the july sampling date when analysing july 0+ ﬁsh densities). from the overall 30 samples, 22 samples had adequate information to be included as predictors based on non-0+ ﬁsh data (density of spawners, spawner species richness and density of non-0+ predators) because of the incompleteness of non-0+ ﬁsh sampling (table 2). multiple regressions were conducted on the 22 samples that were available for all predictors. however, when ﬂood duration was the only signiﬁcant predictor in the model (see results), we conducted simple linear regression (lr) on all 30 samples using ﬂood duration as the predictor. in that case, the model obtained by lr is presented in the results. the predictor variables considered were not signiﬁcantly correlated with one another (pearson correlation, all p > 0.05). the inﬂuence of the ‘site’ and the physical descriptors of the sites (maximal depth, site area and shore length) to ﬁsh assemblage parameters (listed in table 3) were tested using mixed model analyses of variance and covariance. all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistica 8.0 (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa) and r 2.7.1.

wolda 1981). both coefﬁcients range from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical samples). similarly, these indices were calculated to investigate the similarity between the 0+ ﬁsh assemblage at the end of the season in october and the 1+ ﬁsh assemblage in the following year. model analyse of variance, p > 0.05), and the ﬁsh assemblage parameters were not inﬂuenced by phys- ical descriptors (maximal depth, site area, shore length;

mlr, p > 0.05). therefore, the ﬁnal model always, if at all, consisted of simple lr describing the inﬂuence of ﬂood duration on a particular dependent variable. results none of the analysed ﬁsh assemblage parameters (listed in table 3) differed among sites (mixed assemblage composition during the ﬁve sampling seasons, a total of 70,537 individual ﬁsh in the 0+ age class were caught, belonging to 24 species of ﬁve families (table 4). the table 4. relative abundances (in %) and frequencies (f;

perch and pikeperch in percidae). despite the overall similarity between the non-0+ and 0+ ﬁsh assemblages (table 4), the composition of spawner assemblage did relate well with the composition of 0+ ﬁsh not assemblage at the start of the season (mean ja 0.38 ± 0.18 sd; mean renkonen¢s ps 0.24 ± 0.21 sd). similar values of ja and higher values of ps were calculated between the 0+ ﬁsh assemblage at the end of the season and the 1+ ﬁsh assemblage in the following season (mean ja 0.38 ± 0.17 sd; mean renkonen¢s ps 0.52 ± 0.25 sd). there was a positive relationship between the number of species spawned during the season and ﬂood duration (lr, p < 0.001, r2 = 0.71, b = 2.2935, d.f. = 1,27; ﬂood duration was log-transformed to achieve linearity as the trend was asymptotic, reaching asymptote in approximately 90-day ﬂood;

though, most species lacked newly hatched individuals. two sites, white bream at 650 discussion factors inﬂuencing the 0+ ﬁsh assemblage density of 0+ ﬁsh can be potentially inﬂuenced by various biotic and abiotic variables. however, ﬂood duration was the only signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing density and diversity of 0+ ﬁsh in our study. the signiﬁcance of ﬂood duration was linked with almost a total absence of spawning and nursery areas in the water bodies themselves (bare steep banks and lack of aquatic vegetation). instead, spawning and nursery areas were provided by ﬂooded terrestrial vegetation. the suitability of the borrow pits as nursery habitats per se is therefore questioned (see conclusions). similarly to the main channel, the availability and quality of nurseries seem to be correlated with the morphology of the artiﬁcial borrow pits (kurmayer et al. 1996); the function and quality of the inshore habitats seem to be essential. thus, we assume that the suitability of studied borrow pits as nursery habitats . p u o r g h s ﬁ t y h p - c e h t d n a i s e c e p s t n a d n u b a t s o m n e v e s f o l ] y e v i t c e p s e r , h s ﬁ + 1 d n a + 0 r o f 2 m 0 0 1 r e p s d n i d n a ) 1 + m ⁄ s d n i ( n l [ ) e u p c ( t r o f f e t i n u r e p h c t a c i i g n n a p x e l s e s y a n a l i n o s s e r g e r l e p i t l u m f o s t l u s e r . 5 l e b a t l s e d o m , ’ . s . n ‘ s a d e k r a m e r a l s e d o m i t n a c ﬁ n g s n o n i . n w o h s e r a i ) s s e h t n e r a p n i , b ( i s t n e c ﬁ f e o c i n o s s e r g e r w a r d n a ) 2 r ( i n o i t a n m r e t e d f o i s t n e c ﬁ f e o c , ) e t o n t o o f e e s , s k s i r e t s a y b d e s s e r p x e p ( l e d o m e h t f o e c n a c ﬁ n g s i i . s c i l a t i n i n w o h s e r a n o i t c e r r o c i k a´ d sˇ - n n u d r e t f a i t n a c ﬁ n g s n o n i h c r e p g n i l r e t t i b p r a c i n a s s u r p m a e r b h c a o r m a e r b e t i h w d d u r t y h p - c . f . d i r o t c d e r p t n a c ﬁ n g s i i . s . n . s . n . s . n . s . n . s . n ) 8 7 0 0 0 ( . . 7 3 0 * * * ) 9 5 0 0 0 ( . . 0 5 0 * * * ) 8 2 0 0 0 ( . 2 4 . 0 * * *   ) 8 2 0 0 0 ( . 3 2 0 * . ) 9 0 0 0 0 ( . 3 2 0 * . . s . n . s . n ) 3 8 0 2 0 ( . 7 2 0 * . ) 2 3 0 0 . 0 ( 8 2 . 0 * * . s . n ) 0 7 0 0 . 0 ( 5 5 . 0 * * * . s . n ) 4 9 1 0 0 ( . . 2 3 0 * * ) 1 9 3 0 . 0 ( . 4 2 0 * * ) 8 5 3 0 . 0 ( 6 3 . 0 * * * ) 0 8 1 0 . 0 ( . 7 6 0 * * * ) 2 5 1 0 . 0 ( . 2 5 0 * * * ) 4 0 1 0 . 0 ( . 2 5 0 * * * ) 4 2 6 4 0 ( . . 0 5 0 * * ) 0 8 2 0 . 0 ( 8 4 . 0 * * * ) 3 4 1 0 0 ( . 7 5 . 0 * * * ) 7 6 1 0 . 0 ( 6 6 . 0 * * * ) 3 2 2 4 . 0 ( 9 5 . 0 * * * . s . n ) 3 1 2 0 . 0 ( . 1 6 0 * * * ) 4 9 1 0 . 0 ( 4 6 . 0 * * * ) 0 4 1 0 . 0 ( . 1 8 0 * * * ) 4 0 2 1 0 ( . 7 3 0 * . . s . n ) 4 4 5 0 0 ( . . 1 4 0 * * * ) 4 8 3 0 0 ( . . 6 6 0 * * * ) 3 6 2 0 . 0 ( 2 7 . 0 * * * ) 6 3 2 0 . 0 ( 3 8 . 0 * * * ) 6 5 4 2 . 1 ( 8 6 . 0 * * * 8 2 8 2 8 2 7 2 4 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 n o i t a r u d d o o f l n o i t a r u d d o o f l n o i t a r u d d o o f l n o i t a r u d d o o f l n o i t a r u d d o o f l l e b a i r a v e s n o p s e r e u p c + 0 t s u g u a e u p c + 0 r e b o t c o e u p c + 0 e n u j e u p c + 0 l y u j e u p c + 1 r a e y i g n w o l l o f fish reproduction in ﬂoodplain water bodies (a) (b) (c) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 flood duration (days) 8 6 4 2 ) ] 1 + m / s d n i [ n l ( e u p c t y h p - c + 0  e n u 0j 4 3 2 1 0 ) ] 1 + m / s d n i [ n l ( e u p c t y h p - c + 0  r e b o t c o 300 200 100 0 ) 2  m 0 0 1 / s d n i ( e u p c t y h p - c + 1  n o s a e s g n i w o l l o f fig. 4. dependence of (a) the density of 0+ c-phyt in june, (b) the density 0+ c-phyt in october and (c) the density of 1+ c-phyt in the following season on the ﬂood duration. plotted lines represent the best ﬁtting curves. fitted functions: (a) y = 0.5761 + 0.0544x;

bailly et al. 2008) and coupling of the thermal and ﬂooding regimes (e.g., schramm & eggleton 2006). in addition, some factors not measured in our study could inﬂuence the density of 0+ ﬁsh, for example density of zooplankton (nunn et al. 2007b), water bird predation or parasites (ondracˇkova´ et al. 2004; cucherousset et al. 2007). spawners of the most abundant species were always present at the sites that diminished the inﬂuence of density of spawners to the density of 0+ ﬁsh. moreover, the potential spawners assemblage compo- sition did not ﬁt well with the 0+ ﬁsh composition at the start of the season (mean ja 38%, mean ps 24%). this disproportion could be caused by the lack of suitable spawning substrate on some sites (no spring ﬂood for phytophilic species; lack of gravel substrate and ﬂowing water for some rheophilic species that also rarely occurred in non-0+ assemblage), by occasional migration of non-0+ ﬁsh among the ﬂooded borrow pits and probably also by the later spawning of some species (eggs of some species might not be hatched in june sampling yet). our analyses did not demonstrate a signiﬁcant, direct relationship between the density of ﬁsh preda- tors and the density of 0+ ﬁsh. however, predation by ﬁsh predators was the most probable cause of decreasing 0+ ﬁsh density on nonﬂooded (i.e., shel- ter-lacking) localities. decreased water level has been documented to threaten ﬁsh by increasing the preda- tion risk (halyk & balon 1983). the 0+ ﬁsh mortality caused by decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations (humphries et al. 1999; lusk et al. 2004) was improbable in our study, as always at least 1 m of water remained at the sites, and we did not observe any dead ﬁsh. the connection with the main channel in our study was quite rare and appeared mostly during late march, when the water was still cold for a massive spawning migrations (hladı´k & kubecˇka 2003; cucherousset et al. 2007), and therefore most ﬁsh probably origi- nated from the borrow pits. only during the brief intensive overspill of the river in august 2002, several older 0+ individuals probably immigrated from the main channel to the four sites connected with the river, increasing 0+ species richness there (see results). drift phenomenon during this ﬂood also participated on the overall higher number of 0+ species than non- 0+ species at some sites (table 4). flood provides spawning substrate flooded terrestrial vegetation provided suitable spawning substrate for phytophilic and phyto-litho- philic cyprinids in accordance with other studies (grift et al. 2003; king et al. 2003; bailly et al. 2008). 652 roach, bream and prussian carp utilised mostly the may ﬂood, and rudd and white bream utilised mostly the june ﬂood. only batch spawners (prussian carp and partly white bream and bleak) were able to utilise a sudden late (august, 2002) ﬂood for spawning, and only non-native prussian carp increased its 0+ density comparably to spring ﬂoods (see also rysˇava´-nova´- kova´ et al. 2009). however, even in batch spawners, spawning in later months (august–october) was notably suppressed in years when the ﬂood stayed at the site for entire growing season. thus, the batch spawners took advantage of the spawning ﬂexibility and ability to delay the spawning but did not use the possibility of increasing their numbers gradually during the long-term ﬂoods. ostracophilic bitterling did not use the ﬂooded vegetation for spawning, and therefore its 0+ june density was not dependent on the spring ﬂood duration. the dependence on the ﬂood duration in later months (july–october) rather reﬂected the pro- tective role of ﬂooded vegetation, a ﬁnding that was also documented by smith et al. (2000). perch repro- duction was not inﬂuenced by the ﬂood duration at all. perch lays egg strands on aquatic vegetation or branches, preferably in deeper areas (gillet & dubois 1995), and 0+ perch are reported to prefer deeper areas with submerged vegetation (fischer & eckmann 1997). at the 0+ perch was distributed evenly along the littoral zone with no preference for the ﬂooded vegetation (rysˇava´-nova´- kova´ et al. 2009). the shallow zone of ﬂooded emergent vegetation thus did not seem to be a convenient area for perch spawning and nursery. the studied sites, flood duration and ﬂood regime strongly inﬂuenced 0+ species richness and the diversity of 0+ ﬁsh (h¢), in accordance with agostinho et al. (2001), but not the equitability (evenness) of 0+ ﬁsh assemblage, contrary to agostinho et al. (2001). long-term ﬂoods increased 0+ species richness and diversity mostly because of the protective function of ﬂooding (see further) and also by allowing more species to spawn (asymptoti- cally). an asymptotic trend was supported by the fact that phytophilic ﬁshes in the study area are adapted to regular spring ﬂooding events, and therefore a limited number of ﬁshes were able to spawn in later months. flood inﬂuences 0+ ﬁsh survival flooded vegetation provides an efﬁcient and extensive refuge against predators (staas & neumann 1994; grift et al. 2003). moreover, high food availability and higher temperature in ﬂooded areas support the rapid growth of many juvenile ﬁsh (e.g., balcombe et al. 2007) and henceforth increase their survival (halyk & balon 1983; nunn et al. 2007a). the presence of shelter-providing ﬂooded vegetation was crucial for the survival of 0+ cyprinids (mostly c-phyt and bitterling) also in the studied borrow pits. shortly after the ﬂood had receded, the density of 0+ cyprinids decreased sharply, and a longer period without ﬂood led to the complete disappearance of 0+ cyprinids, probably because of the predation. such dramatic consequences of predation on 0+ cyprinids (bream) were detected also by beeck et al. (2002). long-term ﬂoods increased the density of 0+ c- phyt exponentially, with 90-day long ﬂood as a threshold for highly extensive ﬂoodplain utilisation by c-phyt ﬁshes. similarly, ﬂood duration of 6 or more weeks is reported to be necessary for ﬁsh to successfully use the inundated ﬂoodplain for recruit- ment (sparks et al. 1998; king et al. 2003). at the sites where ﬂoods occurred with longer duration, 0+ ﬁsh also seemed to survive the winter and strength- ened the non-0+ assemblage in next year as 1+ ﬁsh. compositions of 1+ ﬁsh assemblages in individual years were more similar to 0+ ﬁsh assemblages at the end of previous year than were spawner assemblages to their progeny. overall, the non-0+ assemblage consisted mostly of young age classes (see also jurajda et al. 2004), with 88–99% of c-phyt estimated as 0+ ﬁsh from 1 and 2 years earlier. the connection with the river once per 2 or 3 years could serve as a liberation of ﬁsh to the river system (nunn et al. 2007b), participating thus in the rejuvenation of the non-0+ assemblage. conclusions floodplain man-made water bodies are suggested to substitute natural backwaters and oxbows in providing suitable spawning substrate and shelter for 0+ ﬁsh (sabo & kelso 1991; nunn et al. 2007b). however, ﬂooded terrestrial vegetation carried out this function instead in the steep-banked, shelter-lacking borrow pits. we assume that artiﬁcial water bodies with similar features can act as useful nurseries only when long periods of raised water level inundate nearby terrestrial vegetation. contrarily, water bodies that possess more aquatic vegetation and other natural shelters should act as suitable nurseries themselves. generally, the density and diversity of 0+ ﬁsh in plesiopotamic water bodies is dependent on the number and permanence of shelters and spawning substrates (shallow littoral zone; aquatic, or ﬂooded terrestrial, vegetation). this study was conducted in a partly disrupted ﬂoodplain system, where the ﬂooding of terrestrial vegetation (whether it is caused by an ephemeral connection with the channelised main channel or overbanking the borrow pits because of the rise in ground water level) shapes its production to the isolated borrow pits. even in this disrupted system, fish reproduction in ﬂoodplain water bodies ﬁsh reproduction was driven by the duration, timing and predictability of ﬂood in a similar manner as natural ﬂoodplain rivers (sparks et al. 1998; king et al. 2003; bailly et al. 2008) – a ﬁnding that adheres to the ﬂood pulse concept (junk et al. 1989). the hydrological regime in the studied area still inﬂuences the phytophilic and phyto-lithophilic ﬁsh reproduction in the separated ﬂoodplain water bodies because of the ground water levels. modiﬁcation of the river dyje is the probable cause of reduced reproduction of phyt- ophilic species in the river stretch adjacent to the studied borrow pits (valova´ et al. 2006). the borrow pits, together with the remaining backwaters, are potential sources of the older (‡2+) phytophilic ﬁsh that recruit into the main channel, a ﬁnding also observed in bream by molls (1999). thus, if the occasional connectivity provides a migration route for the ﬁsh to the river, river channelisation on the non-0+ assemblage of phyto- philic ﬁsh could be mitigated. the adverse affect of acknowledgements this study was supported by the
