(2011) for yoy carp. the type ii functional response was used to identify differences in the feeding rates of infected and uninfected ﬁsh. the functional response is a funda- mental component of many predator–prey and forag- ing models (goss-custard et al. 2006). the type ii functional response is characterised by a feeding rate increasing at a decelerating rate with prey density and eventually reaching a maximum feeding rate (the asymptote) at high prey densities. the age 1+ carp were collected from a lake in southern england in june 2010 (different population than britton et al. 2011); all were 75–95 mm in length least 1 year old. to ensure that data were and at comparable with the yoy carp, identical aquaria conditions were used: light ⁄ dark period of 14:10 h and constant 20 °c. after acclimatisation, ﬁsh were iden- tiﬁed as infected (n = 15) and uninfected (n = 15) according to the presence of parasite eggs in faeces, then measured, weighed and placed in pairs where the individual ﬁsh were recognisable from their scale patterns. these combinations were used to facilitate normal foraging behaviour. the pairs were then transferred to individual 45-l tanks for an experimental period of 60 days; at the conclusion, ﬁsh were measured, weighed, and then euthanized using an overdose of anaesthetic (ms-222). they were then dissected, and their b. acheilognathi infection status was conﬁrmed. only very light infections of common monogenea and protist parasites were recorded; they were considered normal and insigniﬁcant (i.e., not confounding). cyprinus carpio was expected to show a type ii functional response (oyugi et al. 2012). the maxi- mum feeding rate in this functional response was the asymptotic constant, a;

oyugi et al. 2012), where f = feeding rate and d = food density. to determine a and b, the paired ﬁsh were used in foraging trials where the food source was sinking ﬁshmeal pellets (2 mm diameter; oyugi et al. 2012) at release densities of between 12 and 160 items. during each trial, ﬁsh responses were ﬁlmed for 5 min after all the food items were released. feeding rates were calculated as the time between a ﬁsh ingesting its ﬁrst and ﬁfth item (items s)1). the relationship between d and f in equation 1 was determined for the infected and uninfected carp at age 1+ and yoy, respectively, through least-squares linear regression following log- arithmic transformation. general linear models were then used to identify differences in the feeding rates of infected and uninfected ﬁsh by age ⁄ origin using the number of released food items as the covariate. if these initial analyses suggested signiﬁcant differences in feeding rates between groups, further models were used to test the effects of infection status, ﬁsh origin (i.e., location), body length and food density across all the data. the results of these statistical tests were considered valid if there were equal variances between the groups (levene’s test; p > 0.05). signiﬁcant interaction effects (p < 0.05) between the feeding rate and the independent variables were tested through homogeneity of the regression slopes. during the 60-day experimental period, ﬁsh growth was quantiﬁed using incremental length (il) and speciﬁc growth rate (sgr); il was calculated by il = (lf end–lf start) ⁄ t, where lf start and lf end were individual fork lengths at the start and at the end, and t the duration of the experiment. sgr (% day)1) was calculated by sgr = (wend–wstart) ⁄ t x100, where wstart and wend were individual weights at the start and at the end, and t the duration. differences in growth rates between groups were determined using ancova where starting length ⁄ weight was the covar- iate. signiﬁcant differences were detected using pair- wise comparisons with bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons. in this test, and all anova tests, results were considered valid if variances were equal and regressions slopes were homogenous (p > 0.05). at the start of the experimental period, the mean length of the 1+ carp was 85.1 ± 8.55 mm, with no difference between infected and uninfected ﬁsh (anova, f1,28 = 0.47, p > 0.05). the mean length of the yoy carp was 29.4 ± 4.1 mm (britton et al. 2011). the age 1+ infected and uninfected carp had relatively low half-asymptotic constants and similar maximum feeding rates (table 1; fig. 1a,b). the general the effect of infection by b. acheilognathi on the feeding rate was not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05), with food density the only revealed that linear model infection impacts of bothriocephalus acheilognathi table 1. values of the asymptotic constant (a) and half-saturation constant (b) for infected and uninfected cyprinus carpio ⁄ bothriocephalus acheilo- gnathi, where the feeding rate (f) = (ad) ⁄ (b+d), where d = food density. location ⁄ size of ﬁsh location 1 age 1+ location 2 young-of-the-year status of ﬁsh infected uninfected infected uninfected data were collected at 20 °c. asymptotic constant (a) half-saturation constant (b) 1.65 1.51 1.65 2.44 5.07 4.30 39.97 22.19 signiﬁcant parameter (p < 0.01). by contrast, the yoy carp all had larger half-asymptote constants than the age 1+ carp (table 1). the infected yoy ﬁsh had a similar asymptotic constant to the age 1+ carp, but the uninfected ﬁsh had a larger asymptotic constant (table 1, fig. 1c,d). for the yoy carp, the effect of infection on feeding rate was also signiﬁcant (glm, p < 0.02), as was food density (p < 0.01) (britton et al. 2011). thus, infection by b. acheilognathi only signiﬁcantly reduced the feeding rate of the yoy carp, not the age 1+ carp. the effects of infection on feeding rate were then tested using all of the data in a glm that incorporated the covariates of ﬁsh size, origin and food density, and their interaction terms. whilst food density, origin and ﬁsh size all were signiﬁcant factors in this combined glm, infection status was not (table 2). as the interaction term of parasite status and ﬁsh size was also signiﬁcant on feeding rate (table 2), then in combination with the results of the age-speciﬁc glms, this suggests that it is the effect of infection according to ﬁsh length that determines the impact of b. achei- lognathi on carp feeding rate, with only the smaller ﬁsh signiﬁcantly impacted. there was a similar pattern in the growth rates between the two age groups of ﬁsh. for age 1+ c. carpio, there were no signiﬁcant differences between infected and uninfected ﬁsh for age 1+ c. carpio (mean adjusted differences: sgr 0.05 ± 0.13, p > 0.05, il 0.02 ± 0.04, p > 0.05). the difference in their ﬁnal body lengths were not signiﬁcant infected: 96.7 ± 8.3 mm; anova f1,28 = 0.62, p > 0.05). by contrast, in yoy carp, infected ﬁsh had signiﬁcantly lower growth rates (mean adjusted differences: sgr 0.64 ± 0.29, p < 0.05, il 0.11 ± 0.04, p < 0.02; britton et al. 2011), resulting in signiﬁcant differences in ﬁnal body lengths (infected: 50.9 ± 9.2 mm, not infected: f1,28 = 51.1, p < 0.01). in all cases, the interaction between initial ﬁsh length and weight on sgr and il was not signiﬁcant (anova, p > 0.05), i.e., growth was inde- pendent of starting length and weight.

bean & bonner 2009). reduced host growth associated with 174 fig. 1. resource–density curves for (a, b) age 1+ and (c, d) young-of-the-year cypri- nus carpio that are infected with bothrio- (a, c) and not cephalus acheilognathi infected (b, d). clear circles are the observed mean feeding rate by food density for infected ﬁsh, and ﬁlled circles are the mean feeding rate by food density for uni- nfected ﬁsh. error bars are 95% conﬁdence limits. b. acheilognathi infection is often attributed to diver- sion of energy to the parasite (hansen et al. 2006), with other potential causes including mechanical obstruction of the intestine, haematological changes and overall host behavioural changes (e.g., liao & shih 1956; bauer et al. 1973; scott & grizzle 1979). here, infection-induced changes in feeding rates are also a potential mechanism for reducing host growth in yoy carp. this does not, however, explain why feeding rate slows. the yoy ﬁsh had an increased relative parasite biomass compared to the 1+ ﬁsh (0.6– 12.0 and 0.1–1.8% of body weight respectively), which may have lead to intestinal blockage (scott & grizzle 1979), and reduced feeding motivation, feed- ing rate, food intake and the energy for somatic growth. acknowledgements funding for the study was provided by bournemouth university, the fisheries society of the british isles and the environment agency. references bauer, o.n., musselius, v.a. & strelkov, y.a. 1973. diseases of pond fishes. izdatel’stove kolos moskva (in russian: english translation). jerusalem: israel program for scientiﬁc translations, pp. 220. bean, m.g. & bonner, t.h. 2009. impact of bothriocephalus (cestode: pseudophyllidea) on cyprinella acheilognathi lutrensis condition and reproduction. journal of freshwater ecology 24: 381–391. britton, j.r., pegg, j. & williams, c. 2011. pathological and ecological host consequences of infection by an introduced ﬁsh parasite. plos one 6: e26365. edwards, s.v. & hedrick, p.w. 1998. evolution and ecology of mhc molecules: from genomics to sexual selection. trends in ecology and evolution 13: 305–311. goss-custard, j.d., west, a.d., yates, m.g., caldow, r.w.g., stillman, r.a., bardsley, l., castilla, j., castro, m., dierschke, v., dit durell, s.e., eichhorn, g., ens, b.j., exo, k.m., udayangani-fernando, p.u., ferns, p.n., hockey, p.a.r., gill, j.a., johnstone, i., kalejta-summers, b., masero, j.a., moreira, f., nagarajan, r., owens, i.p.f., pacheco, c., perez-hurtado, a., rogers, d., scheiffarth, g., sitters, h., sutherland, w.j., triplet, p., worrall, d.h., zharikov, y., zwarts, l. & pettifor, r.a. 2006. intake rates and the functional response on shorebirds (charadriiformes) eating macro-invertebrates. biological reviews 81: 501–529. gozlan, r.e., britton, j.r., cowx, i.g. & copp, g.h. 2010. current understanding on non-native freshwater ﬁsh intro- ductions. journal of fish biology 76: 751–786. hansen, s.p., choudhury, a., heisey, d.m., ahumada, j.a., hoffnagle, t.l. & cole, r.a. 2006. experimental infection of the endangered bonytail chub (gila elegans) with the infection impacts of bothriocephalus acheilognathi asian ﬁsh tapeworm (bothriocephalus acheilognathi): impacts on survival, growth, and condition. canadian journal of zoology 84: 1383–1394. heins, d.c. & baker, j.a. 2011. do heavy burdens of schistocephalus solidus in juvenile threespine stickleback result in disaster for the parasite? journal of parasitology 97: 775–778. liao, x.h. 2007. on the diversity of bothriocephalus achei- lognathi parasitizing common carp and grass carp in china. acta zoologica sinica 53: 470–480. liao, h. & shih, l. 1956. contribution to the biology and control of bothriocephalus gowkongensis yea, a tapeworm parasitic in young grass carp, (ctenopharyngodon idellus). acta hydrobiologica sinica 2: 129–185. oyugi, d., cucherousset, j., baker, d. & britton, j.r. 2012. temperature effects on the growth and foraging of juvenile common carp cyprinus carpio. journal of thermal biology 37: 89–94. peeler, e.j., oidtmann, b.c., midtlyng, p.j., miossec, l. & gozlan, r.e. 2011. non-native aquatic animals introductions have driven disease emergence in europe. biological inva- sions 13: 1291–1303. scott, a.l. & grizzle, j.m. 1979. pathology of cyprinid ﬁshes caused by bothriocephalus gowkongensis yea, 1955 (ces- toda: pseudophyllidea). journal of fish diseases 2: 69–73. 175
