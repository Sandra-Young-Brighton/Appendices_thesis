these analyses suggested higher mean growth rates were evident in rivers of higher biological water quality (expressed as british monitoring working party score) and higher mean air temperatures (used as a surrogate of water temperature). that growth of b. barbus was signiﬁcantly and positively enhanced by increased biological water quality was in contrast to cyprinid ﬁshes such as roach rutilus rutilus and suggests that as river water quality continues to improve through reduced nutrient inputs, further ecological changes are likely in riverine ﬁsh communities. key words: somatic growth rates; biological water quality; biological monitoring working party score; nonindigenous introduction assessments of the somatic growth rates of ﬁsh growth rates provide ecological insights into how populations are responding to abiotic and biotic fac- tors in their environment (lappalainen et al. 2008; beardsley & britton 2012). considerable intraspeciﬁc plasticity is often observed in ﬁsh growth between populations, with growth rates being inﬂuenced by a range of density-dependent and density-independent factors that include population abundance (via com- petitive interactions and processes), biological pro- ductivity and water temperature (lappalainen et al. 2008; oyugi et al. 2011; beardsley & britton 2012). the adaptive nature of ﬁsh growth is also important in, for example, the consideration of over-winter sur- vival of young-of-the-year ﬁsh, whereby environmen- tal variables in temperate climates can strongly inﬂuence whether threshold lengths are attained at the end of the ﬁrst growth year (arendt 1997; baras & philippart 1999). temperatures analysis of the variation in somatic growth rates within ranges of species has primarily focused on the environmental inﬂuences that inﬂuence these spatial patterns. for example, roach rutilus rutilus show considerable plasticity in life history traits across their range, with much of this resulting from temperature shifts that occur with latitude; increased growth rates (and associated life history traits) are observed in lower are warmer (lappalainen et al. 2008). in ﬁsh introduced outside of their native range, patterns of invasion success are latitudes where correspondence: j. r. britton, centre for conservation ecology and environmental change, school of applied sciences, bournemouth university, dorset, uk. e-mail: rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00588.x 21 britton et al. often explained by the expression of their life history traits (including growth) that is strongly inﬂuenced by temperature and latitude, where the latter is often used as a surrogate of temperature (benejam et al. 2009; cucherousset et al. 2009; britton et al. 2010a). the inﬂuence of nutrient inputs into freshwaters caus- ing eutrophication and impacting the growth and recruitment of cyprinid ﬁshes has been well estab- lished within lacustrine environments (willemsen 1980; winﬁeld 1992) and more recently on the growth of riverine cyprinids (beardsley & britton 2012). for species such as r. rutilus, growth rates increase as eutrophication increases, with patterns less clear for other species (beardsley & britton 2012). similar patterns have also been observed in tropical systems (e.g., winemiller & jepsen 1998), such as in the red bellied piranha pygocentrus natter- eri (duponchelle et al. 2007). the european barbel barbus barbus is a cyprinid ﬁsh generally found in rivers in the ‘barbel zone’, i.e., habitats generally encountered in the middle reaches of rivers (britton & pegg 2011). their populations tend to have considerable ecological, social and eco- nomic importance, and b. barbus is often considered as a ‘ﬂag’ species, important for conservation purposes because of their negative responses to anthropogenic disturbances (cf. review of britton & pegg 2011). they are also a desirable target species of many recre- ational anglers (wheeler & jordan 1990; taylor et al. 2004). in the uk, they are indigenous to eight east- ﬂowing river catchments between the yorkshire ouse and river thames (wheeler & jordan 1990), with nonindigenous populations now also present in a num- ber of other rivers as range expansion has occurred as a result of introductions for angling (wheeler & jordan 1990). across their european range, most stud- ies have been completed on their movements and behaviour (e.g., baras 1992; baras & nindaba 1999). whilst there have been some studies completed on their life history traits, such as somatic growth rates (e.g., hunt & jones 1975; lobón-cerviá & fernán- dez-delgado 1984; przybylski et al. 2004), this tends to be restricted to single river systems with scant information available on how their growth varies over larger spatial areas and the factors that inﬂuence this variability. notwithstanding, baras & philippart (1999) did note that temperature was a key component regulating barbel growth, reproduction and recruit- ment in the river ourthe, belgium. to overcome this deﬁciency in understanding the spatial variation in somatic growth rates of b. barbus, the aim of this study was to use data from ﬁsh stock assessment exercises completed by the environment agency of england and wales between 2002 and 2010 to determine the growth rates of b. barbus in 20 rivers from across a latitudinal and longitudinal gradient and 22 test the inﬂuence on barbel growth of a range of abiotic factors for which data were available. it was predicted that temperature would have a signiﬁcant and positive inﬂuence on b. barbus growth, and as the species tends to be a strong indicator of undisturbed habitats, their growth rates would increase as values of water quality indicators increased. materials and methods fish population sampling and initial growth data analysis data on the age and growth of barbel populations were available from ﬁsh stock assessment exercises completed by the environment agency of england and wales between 2002 and 2010. during these assessments, a total of 2358 sites of 100 m length were ﬁshed in 202 rivers across a 3-year cycle (i.e., each site was ﬁshed, on average, three times in the study period) using dc electric ﬁshing (hand-held or boat-mounted) and seine netting (as appropriate for the habitat). all ﬁsh captured were netted and processed before being returned to the river. this processing involved ﬁsh identiﬁcation to species, measuring fork length (nearest mm) and removing 3–5 nonregenerated scales for later analysis. in these surveys, sexual differentiation of barbel was not com- pleted; thus, subsequent growth analyses were for combined sexes. it should be noted that growth rates and lengths in females can be greater than in males (hunt & jones 1975). these surveys provided b. barbus scales from 20 rivers where more than 20 individuals were captured on a single occasion (table 1). these scales were then aged on a projecting microscope; to minimise errors in age estimation, a quality control procedure was utilised as described by musk et al. (2006), and all scales were viewed for an individual ﬁsh prior to its age determination. agreement in ages during the quality control procedure was always above 90% for ﬁsh up to the age of 12 years but was reduced there- after, with values for each age varying between 65% and 88%. as these data were the basis of the subse- quent analysis of the variation in growth rates across the 20 rivers, only ﬁsh aged 12 were used subse- quently as the estimated ages for ﬁsh above that age were deemed to be unreliable. it was also the case that at ages above 12, annual growth increments were much reduced (cf. results). following ageing of the scales, they were measured to allow lengths at age to be derived by back-calculation using the scale pro- portional method (francis 1990). where b. barbus length-at-age data were available for a river from more than one sampling period, these data were tested for differences in their lengths at ages between the samples. in all cases, there was

within a sample than between sampling years, with no signiﬁcant differ- ences (anova p > 0.05). thus, the length-at-age data from across the sampling time period were able to be combined for each river. the growth analysis was then com- pleted by determining the mean standardised growth residuals for each river (jones 2000; benstead et al. 2007; storm & angilletta 2007). to avoid statistical complications from using repeated measurements from individual ﬁsh in the same test (i.e., pseudore- plication), only the back-calculated length at the last annulus was used from each ﬁsh in the test (britton et al. 2010b; beardsley & britton 2012). the analysis required the length-at-age data for all rivers (age 1–12, rationale described previously), with the mean length at each age determined using the log–log quadratic function of vilizzi & walker (1999), who identiﬁed this as the most precise and biologically meaningful growth model of ﬁve quadratic functions and the von bertalanffy growth model. these values then enabled the standardised residual of the length at age of each ﬁsh to be calculated (britton et al. 2010b; beardsley & britton 2012), with these compared between rivers using anova with tukey’s post hoc tests. this test produced mean standardised residuals per river that were used to subsequently test the effects of the abi- otic factors on b. barbus growth. inﬂuence of abiotic factors on ﬁsh growth the availability of abiotic data for testing against the growth data was limited and reliant on sourcing data in the postsampling period. consequently, surrogate data sets had to be used for some parameters. for the majority of rivers, accurate water temperature data were not available and so the surrogates of air temper- ature, latitude (britton et al. 2010c) and longitude were used; this latter parameter was used as it was determined that it had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on air temperature (cf. results) and so on water temperature. the air temperature data that were used were available as the annual mean temperature (2000–2010) for the 10-km2 grid square in which the site in the middle of the reach was located (worldclim 2011). river ﬂow data were obtained from the national river flow archive (centre for ecology & hydrology 2011), with values of mean daily ﬂow, 95% exceedance (q95) and 10% exceedance (q10) available for the nearest recording site in the vicinity of the sampling sites in each river where b. barbus was sampled. however, owing to signiﬁcant colinearity between these vari- ables, only mean ﬂow was used in subsequent tests. more precise data on daily ﬂow rates were not avail- able for all the rivers. for water chemistry, the data generally available were mean concentrations of ammonia and phosphate (as orthophosphate) over the study period, and biological water quality was expressed as mean values of the biological monitoring working party score (bmwp) where higher values indicate higher biological water quality (hawkes 1998). these data were available as means from data collected by the environment agency between 2002 and 2010 from the study reaches (environment agency 2011). for some of these parameters (e.g., bmwp, phosphate), data were only available for a 23 britton et al. fig. 1. river catchments in england and wales in which barbus barbus were recorded during ﬁsh stock assessment surveys completed by the environment agency between 2002 and 2010; note that the individual sites where the ﬁsh were captured are not marked. the numbers refer to rivers used in the growth analysis (cf. table 1). proportion of the rivers, but in all cases, the minimum number of rivers used in subsequent statistical tests was 13. there were no other parameters relating to organic loading available for testing. as it had already been determined that there were no temporal effects in the data that required correcting for, univariate regression was able to be used initially to identify the relationships between the growth and abiotic data. then, to identify the abiotic variables that explained most of the variation in b. barbus growth, stepwise multiple linear regression was used where the dependent variable was the mean standardised residu- als for each river and the independent variables input- ted into the model were mean air temperature (latitude and longitude were omitted because of signiﬁcant colinearity with air temperature), ﬂow, ammonia, orthophosphate and bmwp. the ﬁnal model provided the signiﬁcant predictor variables and their standar- dised beta coefﬁcients (b), where the variable with the largest b value having the strongest singular contribu- tion to the ﬁnal model. owing to the structure of the data, this multiple linear regression model was based 24 on a relatively high number of predictor variables when compared to the number of growth observa- this is against best practice – for tions. whilst example, harrell (2001) suggested that the number of candidate predictor variables should be <10% of the total sample size – it is unavoidable in a study such as the present one where there are limited data available. all statistical tests were performed using spss version 16.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa), all data were tested for normality prior to parametric tests, anova tests were used only when levene’s test indicated equal variances between the groups (indicated by p > 0.05), and where error is shown, it represents 95% conﬁdence limits. results the location of the 20 rivers used in the study is shown in fig. 1; in most cases, the sampled popula- tions were located in the middle and/or lower reaches of these rivers. in the samples, b. barbus was present between 1 and 21 years of age (table 1), with con- 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 ) m m ( s u l

= 0.19; p > 0.05). there was no signiﬁcant dif- ference in the mean standardised residuals between the indigenous and nonindigenous range of the barbel (anova f1,18 = 0.06, p > 0.05). compared with b. barbus across their european range, their mean growth rate in the uk appeared to be relatively fast (fig. 3). signiﬁcant across rivers the across the geographical range of the 20 rivers, mean annual air temperature signiﬁcantly decreased as latitude and longitude both increased (latitude: r2 = 0.90; f1,18 = 151.33, p < 0.01; longitude: r2 = 0.91; f1,20 = 94.77, p < 0.01). whilst there was no signiﬁcant effect of latitude on barbel growth (r2 = 0.02; f1,18 = 0.41, p > 0.05; fig. 4), there was a signiﬁcant effect on barbel growth with longi- (r2 = 0.40; tude, with faster growth in the east

released into rivers outside of their natural range were sufﬁciently adaptive to grow within the limits of the species in their new environments. stepwise multiple regression revealed that biological water quality was the most important variable in explaining the growth variation (as per the prediction), with higher values of bmwp and lower mean concentra- tions of phosphate coincident with higher mean growth rates of b. barbus. the shift in air tempera- ture with longitude (a likely consequence of the inﬂu- ence of atlantic weather systems that determine much of the weather patterns in the western parts of the uk) did have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on growth, but a similar pattern was not apparent with latitude 26 (contrary to the prediction), despite a similar signiﬁ- cant decrease in air temperature with distance north. the reasons for this lack of relationship with latitude were not clear. indeed, temperature has been shown to be a key determinant of barbel population dynamics and juvenile growth in other studies (e.g., baras & philippart 1999), and so its signiﬁcant inﬂu- ence in the regression model was expected. given the predicted ecological responses by some non-native ﬁshes in england and wales to warming temperatures expected under climate change scenarios (britton et al. 2010c), some future changes to the b. barbus temperature–growth relationships may be expected. nonetheless, as water temperatures are likely to remain <24 °c for most summer periods even under more extreme scenarios, it is unlikely that the new temperature regime will inhabit growth rates and indeed may even accelerate them. moreover, given the inﬂuence of phosphate loading on barbel, it could be hypothesised that b. barbus growth rates may decrease in the vicinity of urban areas with increased human population densities where increased loading is likely to occur through sewage efﬂuents and associated discharges, although it was beyond the scope of this study to test this. spatial variation in growth rates is a common fea- ture of cyprinid ﬁsh populations. some studies have revealed that growth rates vary across longitudinal river gradients (przybylski 1996) with, for example leuciscus cephalus, growth rates tending to increase with distance downstream because of the positive inﬂuences of increased temperature and river size (tedesco et al. 2009). the inﬂuence of biological water quality on the growth of species of the barbus genus in europe is less clear; for barbus sclateri, growth rates increase as organic loading decreases (oliva-paterna et al. 2003), whereas in barbus boca- gei, fast growth rates are coincident with high organic enrichment (oliveira et al. 2002). in this study, whilst the actual ecological mechanism that enabled the faster growth of b. barbus as organic enrichment decreased was not clear, a likely consequence of the limited organic data available and the large spatial scale of the growth meta-analysis that prevented precise and detailed investigations at a site and reach level, this incidence of faster growth with increased water quality is in contrast to other cyprinid ﬁshes in the uk. for example, r. rutilus grow faster and tend to be more numerically dominant (e.g., willemsen 1980; winﬁeld 1992; kennedy 1996; lappalainen et al. 2001; beardsley & britton 2012). their abundance in eutrophic waters is adversely impacted when water quality improvements occur (cowx & broughton 1986). moreover, in this study, only the growth of b. barbus above age 1 was studied, whereas there may be differential effects during early in eutrophic waters growth of barbus barbus in the uk 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 –2 –1.5 –1 –0.5 0.0 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 –2 –1.5 –1 –0.5 0.0 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 –0.5 –1.0 –0.5 –1.0 bmwp standardised residual

sequently increased growth rates of larvae and juve- niles (e.g., wood & armitage 1997). thus, the response of cyprinid ﬁshes to their environment tends to be species speciﬁc, with some species tolerant and others sensitive to organic loadings, even in species of the same genus. these responses may also be more complex than described and also inﬂuenced by aspects such as ﬁsh community structure, which will indirectly inﬂuence the response of species to their changing environments through, for example, shifts in their competitive strengths (britton & pegg 2011). in addition to the spatial growth analyses enabled by the ﬁsh stock assessment exercises of the environ- ment agency, they also enable a comparison of b. barbus distribution with the study of wheeler & jordan (1990), who ﬁrst described their indigenous and nonindigenous ranges in the uk. comparison of their distribution data with those of this study reveals that b. barbus was recorded in six more catchments here and all were outside of their indigenous range. consequently, this range expansion was not through any natural colonisation but entirely through ﬁsh stocking exercises for catch-and-release recreational angling. this does mean that the ﬁsh sampled in these six rivers may have been stocked ﬁsh that had grown in the river or may be the result of recruitment arising from the reproduction of the stocked ﬁsh. this is difﬁ- cult to prove deﬁnitely because of the absence of 27 britton et al. stocking records and dates for these ﬁsh. nevertheless, for the 20 rivers used in the growth data analysis, all were reported as supporting wild b. barbus popula- tions in wheeler & jordan (1990), i.e., their popula- tions were well established, although subsequent stock enhancement using small numbers (<1000) of cultured ﬁsh of age 1+ and 2+ may have occurred in some of these rivers (taylor et al. 2004; pegg & britton 2011). within the growth analysis, sample sizes per river were generally small, with some analysis being com- pleted on samples of <30 ﬁsh. similarly, for the 20 rivers, abiotic data were only available for a propor- tion of the rivers. consequently, the study was reliant on relatively small samples, and so some caution may have to be adopted in the interpretation. it was most likely that sample sizes were low because of the difﬁculty of sampling adult b. barbus in their natural habitats of relatively large rivers of at least medium ﬂow, which makes their capture difﬁcult by methods such as electric ﬁshing (britton & pegg 2011). for in river severn in western england, example, b. barbus is frequently captured by anglers yet is rarely encountered in ﬁsh stock assessment surveys (j. r. britton, personal observation). supplementing ﬁsh stock assessment data with angler catch data may help problem (e.g., cowx & broughton 1986). irrespective of these issues, b. bar- bus populations are sensitive to a range of anthropo- genic disturbances (britton & pegg 2011) and there have been reports of major population regressions in europe owing to habitat disruption and water quality issues (e.g., penczak & kruk 2000). thus, the out- puts of this study should be considered as important from an ecological and conservation perspective as it provided, for the ﬁrst time, insights into b. barbus growth such as a positive association between growth rates and biological water quality. overcome this acknowledgements we thank colleagues in the environment agency for their assistance in collating the distribution and age data. we thank the barbel society and
