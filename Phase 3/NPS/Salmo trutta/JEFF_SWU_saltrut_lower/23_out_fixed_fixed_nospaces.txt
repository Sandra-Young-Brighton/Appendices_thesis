le cren, 1965), and it can reduce competition for resources (claessen, de roos, & persson, 2000). in situations where the energy gain from cannibalism exceeds an individual’s energetic needs, it may allow cannibals to escape competition altogether (claessen et al., 2000). in fact, it has been sug- gested that the occurrence of cannibalistic giants in piscivorous fishes can be understood as an emergent phenomenon resulting from interac- tions between size- dependent cannibalism and competition (andersson, byström, claessen, persson, & de roos, 2007; claessen et al., 2000). in contrast to many other temperate- zone fish species (e.g. andersson et al., 2007; smith & skúlason, 1996; svanbäck, eklöv, 686  |   wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:686–694. © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdin ponds (reviewed fransson, & holmgren, 2008), including the three- spined stickle- back (gasterosteus aculeatus; e.g. mcphail, 1984, 1993), the nine- spined stickleback (pungitius pungitius) is a species not known to exhibit resource polymorphism. however, giant individuals (total length >80 mm; cf. herczeg, gonda, & merilä, 2009) have been encountered in multiple fennoscandian pond populations (herczeg et al., 2009; kuusela, 2006; mobley, lussetti, johansson, englund, & bokma, 2011). common garden experiments and interpopulational crosses have verified that the attainment of large body size is geneti- cally based (ab ghani, herczeg, & merilä, 2012; herczeg et al., 2009; shimada et al., 2011), and likely driven by lack of piscine predators that typically select for early maturation at small size, and/or increased intraspecific competition in merilä, 2013). however, in addition to these factors, the direct effect of reduced mortality rate due to lack of piscine predators probably facilitates attainment of older ages (herczeg, gonda, kuparinen, & merilä, 2012; herczeg et al., 2009) and thereby contributes to the large size of the pond fish. furthermore, herczeg et al. (2009) noted that pond individ- uals in the oldest age classes appeared to be larger than expected if they followed the growth trajectory of fish in the younger age classes. it was hypothesised that this could come about if the largest individ- uals become cannibals and start to exploit younger conspecifics as a food source (herczeg et al., 2009). this type of growth pattern has been demonstrated earlier in several european perch (perca fluviatilis) populations where the largest individuals are cannibalistic (claessen et al., 2000). however, gigantism could also be facilitated by other factors, such as parasitic infections. by diverting energy away from reproduction, parasites can promote gigantism either by increasing the energy available for supporting growth or by prolonging individuals’ life expectancy (hall, becker, & cáceres, 2007; heins, baker, toups, & birden, 2010; schultz, topper, & heins, 2006). sticklebacks are popular models of ecology and evolutionary biol- ogy (reviews in: bell & foster, 1994; merilä, 2013; östlund- nilsson, mayer, & huntingford, 2007; wootton, 1976, 1984), and there are numerous reports on intercohort cannibalism in both three- spined (e.g. fitzgerald, 1991; hyatt & ringler, 1989; kynard, 1978; smith & reay, 1991) and nine- spined (hynes, 1950; smith & reay, 1991) stick- lebacks, directed towards eggs or early larval stages. as large juveniles and small adults can be energetically profitable prey for large canni- balistic fish, it is reasonable to hypothesise that cannibalism on such individuals could occur in populations where sticklebacks reach giant sizes. however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of intra- or intercohort cannibalism on nine- spined sticklebacks directed towards large juveniles or adults. likewise, the possibility of parasitic infections as a factor explaining or contributing to gigantism in nine- spined sticklebacks has not been investigated to date. the aims of this study were threefold. first, by utilising stomach content analyses, we aimed to empirically test the hypothesis that gigantism in nine- spined sticklebacks is associated with an ontoge- netic niche shift from an invertebrate diet to cannibalism on large juve- niles or adult conspecifics. second, we aimed to verify the results from stomach content analyses by studying individual variation in long- term dietary niche with the aid of stable nitrogen (δ15n) and carbon (δ13c)     |  687 isotope analyses. third, we tested the hypothesis that reaching a large size could be explained by parasitic infection (i.e. castration) by the cestode schistocephalus pungitii. 2 |  material and methods 2.1 | field sampling nine- spined sticklebacks and their putative prey items were sampled during 7–10 august 2012 from an isolated pond (rytilampi; surface area ca. 5 ha, maximum depth 5.2 m) situated in north- eastern finland (66º23′07′′n, 29º18′42′′e). the pond is surrounded by coniferous forest and bogs, but has clear and oligotrophic water due to upwelling of spring water. no other fish species than nine- spined sticklebacks are known to inhabit the lake. the fish were captured using two bottom nets (9- mm mesh, 30 m long, 1.5 m high) and 14 funnel- shaped (gee- type) minnow traps set overnight at different depth zones (see merilä, lakka, & eloranta, 2013 for specific details). additional qualitative samples of small ≤30 mm and large>100 mm fish, as well as benthic invertebrate prey, were col- lected from shallow and deep littoral areas by snorkelling with a 500- μm mesh kick- net. zooplankton prey were collected by taking several vertical hauls with a 100- μm plankton net throughout the water col- umn. all invertebrates were sorted, cleaned from detritus and other unwanted material and identified mainly to genus level. in the case of molluscs, only soft body tissue was dissected. all fish and invertebrate samples were stored frozen at −20°c until further preparation for sta- ble isotope analysis. 2.2 | measurements each fish (n = 92) was measured (total length, ± 1.0 mm) and weighed (wet mass, ± 0.1 g) prior to dissection. the number and wet mass of s. pungitii cestode in fish body cavity was recorded, and the residual mass of the fish was estimated by subtracting the total parasite mass (±0.01 g) from the host mass. sex and maturity status of all individuals were identified with gonadal inspection, classifying individuals either as immature (n = 37) or mature (n = 55). for the immature individuals that could not be reliably sexed by gonadal inspection (n = 24), sex was identified molecularly using a sex- specific microsatellite marker (stn19) following the procedures outlined in shikano, herczeg, and merilä (2011). the dna extractions and genotyping were performed in the molecular ecology and systematics laboratory (university of helsinki) as explained in shikano et al. (2011). the stomach and a piece of white dorsal muscle tissue were dis- sected for stomach content (sca) and stable isotope analyses (sia), respectively. stomach fullness was visually estimated with a scale from 0 (empty) to 10 (fullest extent), and the relative contribution of each prey taxon to the total stomach fullness was estimated accord- ing to hynes (1950). for graphical illustration, the observed prey taxa were further grouped into: (i) zooplankton (cladocera and copepoda), (ii) molluscs (valvata sp. and lymnaea sp. snails and sphaerium sp. clams), (iii) benthic crustaceans (gammarus sp., asellus sp., eurycercus merilä and eloranta688  |     sp. and ostracoda), (iv) insects (chironomidae larvae and pupae and ephemeroptera nymphs) and (v) fish. moreover, the nine- spined stick- lebacks were divided into four size groups according to their total length: (i) <40 mm, (ii) 40–59 mm, (iii) 60–79 mm and (iv) >80 mm. the dietary overlap between the four size groups was estimated using schoener’s (1989) similarity index (α): α = 1 − 0.5 nࢣi=1pxi − pyi , where pxi is the proportion of prey group i used by size group x, pyi is the proportion of prey group i used by size group y and n is the num- ber of prey categories. the dietary overlap is considered biologically significant when the index value exceeds 60% (wallace, 1981). finally, the dietary niche width was calculated for each size group using levins’ (1968) index (b): b = , 1 i ∑ p2 where pi is the proportion of each prey group i in the diet expressed as fraction rather than percentage. the index b ranges from one (when individuals feed on a single prey group) to n (when individuals feed on all prey groups in equal proportions). 2.3 | isotope analyses all frozen sia samples were freeze- dried (alpha 1- 4 ld plus; martin christ gefriertrocknungsanlagen gmbh, osterode, germany) for 48 h, homogenised using a metallic pestle and weighed (0.5– 0.6 ± 0.001 mg) in tin cups. the sia samples were subsequently ana- lysed with a flashea 1112 elemental analyser connected to a thermo finnigan deltaplus advantage mass spectrometer at the university of jyväskylä, finland. analysis precision (i.e. sd of an internal stand- ard) was <0.15‰ for both δ13c and δ15n in each run. the siar package (stable isotope analysis in r; parnell, inger, bearhop, & jackson, 2010) was used in r 3.1.1 (r core team 2014) to estimate relative contributions of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish to the long- term diets of sticklebacks belonging to each size group. the siar input data included individual δ13c and δ15n values from fish muscle tissue, mean ± sd δ13c and δ15n values of putative zooplankton (calanoid sp. copepods), benthos (algae- feeding snails, insects and crustaceans) and fish (<30 mm nine- spined sticklebacks) prey sources, and the commonly used trophic fractionation corrections of 0.4 ± 1.3% for δ13c and 3.4 ± 1.0‰ for δ15n (after post, 2002). finally, the potential ontogenetic shift to cannibalism was examined by estimating trophic position of nine- spined sticklebacks according to the two- source isotopic mixing model described by karlsson and byström (2005). the same littoral and pelagic baselines and trophic fractionation factors were used as for the siar model. to study whether dietary niche and attainment of giant size might be influenced by parasitism by s. pungitii cestode, we also recorded the prevalence, abundance and wet mass of s. pungitii plerocercoids in the stickleback’s body cavity. schistocephalus parasites can have deleteri- ous effects on reproduction and/or growth of both male and female sticklebacks, for example via nutrient theft (heins, ulinski, johnson, & baker, 2004). however, parasitemia by schistocephalus may also—at least in theory—lead to castration of the host and hence facilitate its growth, as part of the resources normally allocated towards reproduc- tion might be allocable to growth. following heins and baker (2010), the high host specificity of schistocephalus parasites in sticklebacks (bråten, 1966; nishimura, heins, andersen, barber, & cresko, 2011; orr, hopkins, & charles, 1969) indicates that all the observed parasites were likely s. pungitii. 2.4 | statistical analyses chi- square test was used to test whether the parasite prevalence dif- fered between sexes as well as between immature and mature stick- lebacks. mann–whitney u test was used to test whether the parasite infection affected stomach fullness of sticklebacks, potentially indicat- ing host starvation. a general linear model was used to test whether the size (i.e. total length, body mass and residual mass) of the individu- als was explainable by sex, maturation status and parasite prevalence. all the three terms were fitted as fixed factors. we also fitted all inter- actions with explanatory variables, but if they were nonsignificant, they were removed from the final models. in the analyses of body mass and residual mass, the mass of the parasites in host body cavity was first removed from the host mass. residual mass is here defined as the mass of the fish (minus the mass of its schistocephalus parasites) corrected for their structural size by including total length as a covari- ate in the models (e.g. ab ghani, herczeg, & merilä, 2016). to test whether the individuals’ δ13c and δ15n values, reflecting the littoral versus pelagic resource use and trophic position of a con- sumer respectively (karlsson & byström, 2005), was influenced by their size, sex and parasite infection status, a set of linear models was compared using the latter three factors as explanatory variables. the initial full models included all main effects and two- way interactions between them. model selection was performed by stepwise (back- ward) removal of terms to minimise aic and by selecting the simplest model with fewest terms when two models were equally supported (δaic < 2). all aforementioned statistical analyses were performed with jmp pro (v. 11.0.0; sas institute, inc.), except the aic model selection which was performed in r 3.1.1 (r core team, 2014). 3 |  results 3.1 | body size and parasite prevalence ranged from 18 length of sticklebacks total to 110 mm (mean ± sd = 61 ± 25 mm), and wet mass ranged from 0.04 to 7.9 g (2.2 ± 2.0 g). twenty one per cent (n = 19) of the fish were infected with s. pungitii, but there was no significant difference in parasite prevalence between sexes (χ2 = 0.27, p = 0.60), with 24% (n = 11) of males and 19% (n = 8) of females being infected. however, immature sticklebacks were parasitised more often than mature individuals (χ2 = 5.16, p = .023), with 32% (n = 12) of immature and 13% (n = 7) of mature fish being infected. the number of s. pungitii plerocercoids merilä and elorantatable 1 results of general linear models testing for effects of sex, maturation status and incidence of parasitism on nine- spined stickleback total length, body mass and residual body mass source sex maturation parasitism total length model dfs (model, error) total length f body mass f residual mass f 7.42** 169.10*** 1.09 – 67.58*** 3,88 4.22* 72.28*** 0.40 – 31.70*** 3,88 0.41 14.29*** 10.98** 316.82*** 7.49*** 4,87 asterisks denote level of statistical significance: *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001. per fish (mean ± sd intensity = 1.8 ± 1.3) ranged from one (63% of parasitised individuals) to five (5.2%). there was no significant differ- ence in the mean stomach fullness of unparasitised and parasitised sticklebacks (u = 753.5, n = 92, p = .56), although a relatively lower proportion of unparasitised fish had empty stomachs (16%) as com- pared to parasitised fish (26%). linear models revealed that sex and maturation status had inde- pendent effects on total length and body mass (table 1), with females being longer and heavier (body mass) than males regardless of maturity status (table s1). the parasite prevalence did not explain any variation in total length or body mass in these models (table 1). in the case of resid- ual mass (i.e. body condition), sex and maturation- status effects were significant and similar to that in body mass, but unparasitised individ- uals had significantly higher residual mass (mean ± se = 2.43 ± 0.08 g) than parasitised individuals (1.86 ± 0.15 g) when accounting for other effects in model, including total length (table 1). 3.2 | stomach content analyses the stomach content data (fig. 1a) indicated predominantly ben- thivorous diet for most individuals and a clear ontogenetic shift from small benthic invertebrates (e.g. eurycercus sp., ostracoda and chironomidae) to large molluscs (e.g. sphaerium sp., lymnaea sp. and valvata sp.) and finally to cannibalism (conspecifics of 14–21 mm total length; fig. 1c). the schoener indices (α = 14–48%) indicated no sig- nificant dietary overlap between the size groups, whereas the levins’ indices suggested a narrower dietary niche for large (>80 mm) can- nibalistic nine- spined sticklebacks (b = 3.6) as compared to smaller conspecifics (b = 4.4–5.4). 3.3 | isotope analyses the δ13c and δ15n values differed significantly between the pelagic (i.e. zooplankton) and littoral (i.e. benthic macroinvertebrate) isotopic baselines (δ13c: t19.74 = 6.00, p < .001; δ15n: t12.98 = –6.15, p < .001; fig. 2a, table s2). zooplankton, filter- feeding bivalves (sphaerium sp.) and sublittoral benthic macroinvertebrates had markedly lower δ13c values than most benthic macroinvertebrates sampled from     |  689 figure 1 short- and long- term diets of different size (total length) groups of nine- spined sticklebacks based on (a) stomach contents and (b) stable isotope analyses.

foster, garcia, & town, 1988; mcphail, 1984, 1993) and icelandic (kimmel et al., 2012; kristjánsson, skúlason, & noakes, 2002) three- spined stickleback populations, but not from the nine- spined stickleback. the size distri- butions in fennoscandian ponds harbouring giant nine- spined stickle- backs are neither distinctively bimodal (herczeg et al., 2009; herczeg, gonda, & merilä, 2010; this study), nor is there any clear- cut evidence for the occurrence of distinct trophic morphs. our stomach content and stable isotope analyses support this view because the differences in diets of small and large fish seem to reflect a gradual ontogenetic niche shift rather than existence of distinct trophic morphs. the stron- gest evidence for the gradual ontogenetic niche shift towards can- nibalism in our data comes from the stomach content analyses, but occurrence of this shift is also supported by the gradual increase in trophic position of the fish with increasing size. however, in spite of the marked female- biased sexual size dimorphism in nine- spined stick- leback populations hosting giants (herczeg et al., 2010), we found no evidence to suggest sexual differences in trophic position. this goes against the results of gallagher and dick (2011) whose stable isotope data from north american nine- spined sticklebacks indicated a higher trophic position for males than for females. in contrast, in some popu- lations, cannibalistic female three- spined sticklebacks use courting to gain access to nests and eggs guarded by males (foster & baker, 1995), potentially leading to sexual differences in trophic position. in our data, the trophic position was associated with individuals’ infection status because individuals infected by s. pungitii cestode gen- erally occupied a higher trophic position than uninfected individuals. several nonmutually exclusive possibilities can be evoked to explain the generally higher trophic position of parasitised fish: (i) parasitism may induce fish to shift their foraging niche towards higher trophic levels, and even to become cannibalistic. the unexpectedly high tro- phic position of intermediate- sized individuals—of which many were parasitised—could be explainable if parasitised individuals prey heav- ily on eggs and larvae to compensate the nutrition theft by parasites. however, the fact that the unparasitised individuals showed a similar concave relationship between trophic position and size as observed for all, including parasitised individuals, does not give unequivocal sup- port for this interpretation. (ii) parasitism may also influence fraction- ation of isotopes in their hosts. for instance, parasites might be able to selectively extract nutrients from their hosts or influence the host metabolism in a way that leads to 15n- enrichment (reitsema, 2013 and references therein). in fact, bowes, lafferty, and thorp (2014)     |  691 demonstrated that starvation in guppies (poecilia reticulata) led to sig- nificantly higher δ15n values. as energy drainage by schistocephalus spp. parasites is well documented in sticklebacks (barber, wright, arnott, & wootton, 2008; heins & baker, 2014; milinski, 1990), the higher trophic position (i.e. higher δ15n values) of the parasitised fish might be attributable to starvation caused by parasitism. still, we found no significant differences in the stomach fullness of parasitised and unparasitised fish, but parasitised individuals had lower residual mass than unparasitised individuals suggesting the latter to be in bet- ter body condition than the former (see heins et al., 2004 for contrast- ing results). (iii) finally, parasitised individuals may feed selectively on 15n- enriched prey, such as carnivorous copepods (see byström et al., 2007; karlsson & byström, 2005; table s2). in fact, planktivory would also increase the probability of becoming infected because s. pun- gitii is transmitted to sticklebacks through pelagic copepods (barber et al., 2008). however, the explanation that high δ15n values of par- asitised individuals would result from specialised foraging on cope- pods seems to be refutable because if this was the case, one would have expected these individuals to also have lower (i.e. more pelagic) δ13c values than were observed. however, no such differences in δ13c values were observed between unparasitised and parasitised fish (mean ± sd = –31.5 ± 1.3‰ versus –31.2 ± 1.2‰; t31.1 = −0.80, p = .43). hence, the available data suggests that the high trophic position of intermediate- sized and parasitised nine- spined stickle- backs is most parsimoniously explained by temporary egg and larval cannibalism, as well as by direct effect of nutrition theft by p. pungitii on 15n- enrichment in host muscle tissue. however, further stomach content analyses of individuals collected during early breeding season would be needed to document the possible occurrence of egg and larval cannibalism and their impact on 15n- enrichment. as noted by hall et al. (2007), diversion of energy away from host reproduction by parasites such as p. pungitii may result in gigantism. however, in our data, there were no differences in mean sizes of parasitised versus unparasitised individuals, suggesting that parasitic infections did not lead to improved growth of fish host. furthermore, none of the largest (>100 mm) individuals in our data were parasitised, showing that even if parasitic infection (e.g. through castration) might facilitate growth, it is clearly not a prerequisite for attaining a large size. in fact, if the immature individuals are excluded from the analysis, the parasitised individuals were significantly smaller than unparasit- ised individuals (f1,36 = 18.99, p < .001) as also observed in a north american study (heins & baker, 2010). moreover, experimental stud- ies have indicated that parasitised fish do not grow faster than their healthy conspecifics (barber et al., 2008). one reason for the absence of large parasitised fish could be that they are highly susceptible to bird predation and hence quickly removed from the population (cf. brown, loot, grenfell, & guégan, 2001; quinn, kendall, rich, & chasco, 2012). nevertheless, we can confidentially reject the hypothesis that para- sitic infection (e.g. through castration) would be the sole explanation for gigantism in rytilampi nine- spined sticklebacks. as expected, the nitrogen stable isotopes revealed that the nine- spined sticklebacks in rytilampi occupied a higher trophic posi- tion as compared to both littoral and pelagic invertebrates in the merilä and eloranta692  |     pond. furthermore, large-  and intermediate- sized fish were more 15n- enriched than juveniles, but the horseleeches seemed to occupy a trophic position similar to sticklebacks. this is not surprising given that the horseleeches can feed on invertebrates and dead nine- spined sticklebacks (j. merilä, personal observations). regarding littoral ver- sus pelagic resource use, the δ13c values of nine- spined sticklebacks were more similar to those of littoral benthos than sublittoral ben- thos or pelagic zooplankton (i.e. calanoid copepods), suggesting that their diet is mainly composed of benthic prey from the shallow areas. these results are largely in agreement with data from lakes in northern sweden (byström et al., 2007; karlsson & byström, 2005), as well as from lake iqalugaajuruluit in arctic canada (gallagher & dick, 2011) where nine- spined sticklebacks are reported to rely mostly on litto- ral benthic prey, but to some extent also on pelagic zooplankton. in swedish populations, large nine- spined sticklebacks are commonly more planktivorous than smaller conspecifics due to their reduced predation risk in the pelagic open- water areas (karlsson & byström, 2005). correspondingly, in some canadian three- spined stickleback populations, small fry are restricted to feed among vegetation that provides predation shelter, whereas larger conspecifics can more freely exploit the open- water zooplankton resources (foster et al., 1988). our siar results suggest a similar ontogenetic shift towards a slightly more planktivorous diet with increasing fish size. despite being a highly nutritious food resource (eloranta, mariash, rautio, & power, 2013), zooplankton also acts as the intermediate host for s. pungitii cestode. hence, zooplanktivory likely contributes to the observed high parasite prevalence among intermediate- sized fish in rytilampi. however, as suggested by the sca data and the high δ13c values, it is possible that the siar model overestimates the long- term dietary contribution of 15n- enriched but 13c- depleted zooplankton, and  concurrently underestimates the contribution of fish prey, especially for large nine- spined sticklebacks. gigantism in nine- spined sticklebacks has been the subject of many recent investigations (e.g. ab ghani, herczeg, leinonen, & merilä, 2013; ab ghani et al., 2012; herczeg et al., 2009; kuusela, 2006; mobley et al., 2011), but the possible role of cannibalism and parasitism in explaining its occurrence have not been explicitly con- sidered. the lack of focus on the possible role of cannibalism is under- standable as, aside from occasional egg or larval cannibalism, there are no reports of cannibalism directed towards larger conspecifics in the nine- spined stickleback (griswold & smith, 1972; hynes, 1950; smith & reay, 1991). to this end, our results provide novel evidence for the occurrence of juvenile cannibalism in nine- spined sticklebacks. however, most giant individuals had corresponding or only slightly higher tropic position than their putative prey fish and thus were likely facultative rather than obligate cannibals. only one 89- mm- long, unparasitised male occupied an exceptionally high trophic position indicating specialisation to cannibalism. while cannibalism is likely to facilitate the occurrence of gigantism in rytilampi population—by pro- viding nutritional resource to sustain the elevated metabolic demands of large fish (waser, sahoo, herczeg, merilä, & nikinmaa, 2009)— it is unlikely to provide the ultimate explanation for its occurrence. for instance, when reared in “common garden” settings under an ad libitum diet, giant sticklebacks from certain ponds attain larger sizes than their marine conspecifics (herczeg et al., 2009; shimada et al., 2011), and these differences are genetically based (ab ghani et al., 2012). moreover, as our study was restricted to a single pond and sea- son, a more comprehensive study across several locations and seasons would provide stronger evidence of the prevalence and importance of cannibalism in nine- spined stickleback populations. trapping may also increase the prevalence and success of cannibalistic predation among giant nine- spined sticklebacks if the trap hinders the escape of small, confined conspecifics. this possible trapping effect could be avoided using alternative sampling methods, such as electro fishing or short- term netting. in our study, however, trapping effects seem negligible as the 14–21- mm prey fish found in giants’ stomachs were generally small enough to escape rapidly through the trap mesh, and in most cases, the prey fish were highly digested indicating ingestion prior to trapping of the predator. in conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate a clear onto- genetic niche shift towards cannibalism in nine- spined sticklebacks, and that this cannibalism is directed not only presumably towards eggs and larvae but also towards immature fish by “giant” sticklebacks. the isotope data aligns with the results of stomach content analyses, but reveal that the trophic position peaks among intermediate- sized individuals. the latter indicates that the intermediate- sized individuals may cannibalize heavily on eggs and/or larvae, and that most giants are likely facultative cannibals. an alternative and nonmutually exclu- sive explanation is that 15n- enrichment among intermediate- sized individuals is partly caused by starvation and high incidence of parasit- ism by s. pungitii cestode. while further studies are needed to differ- entiate between these alternatives, it seems implausible that parasitic castration by p. pungitii would explain the occurrence of gigantism in rytilampi nine- spined sticklebacks. acknowledgements we thank hanna- kaisa lakka for help in fieldwork, sami karja for help in the laboratory work and oulanka research station (university of oulu) for continued logistic support. jacquelin de faveri, susan foster, the editor david heins and the two anonymous referees are thanked for comments and linguistic corrections that improved ear- lier versions of this manuscript. this research was supported by the academy of finland (grant #:s 200940, 108601 and 118673 to jm). the fish were collected with the permission from metsähallitus (# 3087/41/2011). references ab ghani, i. n., herczeg, g., leinonen, t., & merilä, j.
