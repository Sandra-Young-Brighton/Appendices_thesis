mercer et al. 1999; mayer et al. 2000; idrisi et al. 2001). zebra mussels were ﬁrst collected in lake st. clair, michigan in 1986 (ram & mcmahon 1996), spread rapidly through the great lakes by the early 1990s (mills et al. 1993), and then southward through the illinois, mississippi, ohio, cumberland, tennessee, arkansas, and atchafalaya rivers by the mid-1990s (allen et al. 1999). the physicochemical limits of dreissena are some combi- nation of water temperature, salinity, current velocity, and substrate size and stability (thorp et al. 2002). strayer (1991) projects that zebra mussels will even- tually inhabit most north american waters, being excluded only from the extreme southern and northern sections of the continent and from low-alkaline systems. zebra mussels distribute patchily in most systems, with the greatest densities occurring on harder, exposed substrates, particularly around man- made structures. in systems where zebra mussels have invaded, areal densities commonly range from 2000 to )2 (nalepa & schloesser 1993), 100 000 mussels æ m although localized densities up to 340 000 mus- )2 have been reported from western lake erie sels æ m (leach 1993). at the southern end of their range in the lower mississippi river valley, densities are more )2 modest, typically in the order of 100 mussels æ m (d. miller, u.s. army corps of engineers, personal 85 eggleton et al. communication). previous evaluations (e.g., strayer 1991; aldridge et al. 1995; mcmahon 1996) have suggested that warmer thermal conditions in most rivers and lakes in the southern united states (u.s.) would severely compromise zebra mussel survival and invasive capacities. however, southern u.s. zebra mussel populations are ﬁrmly established despite initial predictions that summertime temperature max- ima would preclude even their survival (allen et al. 1999), although their rates of invasion have been slower than those in other areas. another factor affecting and possibly inhibiting zebra mussel expansion into southern u.s. waters may be predation by native ﬁshes. eggleton & schramm (2003) reported extensive (up to 26% of the annual food consumption) use of zebra mussels by blue catﬁsh (ictalurus furcatus) in the main channel of the lower mississippi river. other reports from the region have also indicated feeding on zebra mussels by blue catﬁsh and freshwater drum (aplodinotus grunniens) in the arkansas river (magoulick & lewis 2002), and by blue catﬁsh in the ohio river (thorp et al. 1998b). similar reports also exist from northern u.s. waters (e.g., french & bur 1993; tucker et al. 1996; morrison et al. 1997), principally with common carp (cyprinus carpio) and freshwater drum. however, most studies concur that ﬁsh predation impacts on zebra mussel populations are insigniﬁcant, although some studies (e.g., thorp et al. 1998b) have specula- ted that the increased forage provided by high-density populations might lead to greater secondary produc- tion by ﬁshes. the potential for ﬁsh predation to impact invasive molluscs has been previously investigated in experi- mental settings. thorp et al. (1998b) conducted a series of enclosure–exclosure experiments in the upper mississippi and ohio rivers. they indicated that ﬁshes had a greater impact when zebra mussels occurred at low densities, but that ﬁsh predation was insufﬁcient to regulate mussels as a result of their great reproduc- tive capacity. conversely, robinson & wellborn (1988) concluded that resident ﬁshes in a texas reservoir had great capacity to control the invading asiatic clam (corbicula ﬂuminea), exhibiting as much as a 29-fold effect on clam abundance in cages where predatory ﬁshes had access. thus, the few ﬁeld studies available suggest the potential of ﬁshes to limit exotic mussels in u.s. waters may vary among systems, and be related to latitude. water temperature as it relates to the level and duration of active feeding and growth of ﬁshes is the primary factor in aquatic systems that varies with latitude. as water temperature drives most physiolo- gical processes in ﬁshes (brett & groves 1979), including feeding (adams & breck 1990), an inverse relationship between latitude and rates of food 86 consumption for most ﬁsh species would be anticipa- ted. hence, we hypothesized that for ﬁshes to provide equivalent impact on zebra mussels across a latitudinal (i.e., thermal) gradient, the biomass of potential zebra mussel predators must increase proportionately with latitude to compensate for the net decrease in consumption. to test this hypothesis, we used a bioenergetic-based approach to investigate how annual rates of food consumption by ﬁshes vary relative to differences in latitude and water temperature regimes of representative aquatic systems where zebra mussels are abundant. additionally, we compiled existing estimates of ﬁsh biomass to examine relationships between biomass of potential zebra mussel predators and latitude. we used the basic relationships among latitude, water temperature, food consumption, and ﬁsh biomass to infer the relative potential for ﬁshes to impact zebra mussel populations. this approach dif- fers from previous in situ approaches (e.g., robinson & wellborn 1988; thorp et al. 1998b), but may be useful to resource managers involved with forecasting future zebra mussel impacts on aquatic ecosystems. materials and methods study areas eight u.s. rivers and lakes with high abundance of zebra mussels were identiﬁed from the u.s. geologi- cal survey zebra mussel website and used for this evaluation. selected study systems were located along a 13° latitudinal gradient (32.3–45.3°n) and 13° longitudinal gradient ()78.9 to )92.1°w) that encom- passed nearly the extent of zebra mussel invasions into u.s. waters (fig. 1). sufﬁcient thermal data were available for each system to develop average annual thermographs needed for food consumption modeling. in most cases, daily thermal data were acquired; in cases where less frequent measures were available (e.g., two to four times per month or irregular intervals throughout the year), daily temperatures were inter- polated from the nearest two values in time. the number of years used for development of annual thermographs ranged from 4 (ohio river) to 72 (eastern lake erie), and averaged 10 years. study species molloy et al. (1997) reported that up to 38 species of ﬁshes eat attached (nonveliger or adult) zebra mussels. however, relatively widespread omnivorous species that attain large sizes would be the best candidates for impacting zebra mussel populations over the geo- graphical area in question. in addition, there must be documentation that the species will eat zebra mussels or other molluscs when available. given these criteria, modeling ﬁsh predation impacts on zebra mussels upper mississippi river pool 4 (minnesota-wisconsin) fox river (wisconsin) northern lake michigan (wisconsin) eastern lake erie (new york) ohio river (ohio-west virginia) the eight fig. 1. geographic location of study areas used for food consumption modeling simulations. shaded states repre- sent the approximate distributional range of zebra mussels as of september 2002. upper mississippi river pool 13 (iowa-illinois) upper mississippi river pool 26 (illinois-missouri) lower mississippi river (mississippi-arkansas) (minytrema melanops), we judged the best candidates were common carp, spotted sucker river carp- sucker (c. carpio), buffalos (ictiobus spp.), redhorse suckers (moxostoma spp.), channel catﬁsh (i. puncta- tus), blue catﬁsh, and freshwater drum. all of these species have been documented as zebra mussel predators (molloy et al. 1997), have the potential to consume zebra mussels based on mouthpart morphol- ogy (french & bur 1993), or have been reported as molluscivorous (lee et al. 1980; etnier & starnes 1993). as groupings of buffalos and redhorse suckers contained several species of similar morphology and distributions, collective analysis at the genus level was performed in lieu of assessing each species individu- ally. food consumption total weight. as we needed generalized estimates of ﬁsh size and growth, we used species-speciﬁc length- at-age data reported for a broad geographical area in the handbook of freshwater fishery biology series (carlander 1969, 1977, 1997). length-at-age curves were converted to weight-at-age curves using weight– length regression equations also reported in carlander (1969, 1977, 1997) (table 1). mean weight-at-age curves were then used to depict generalized annual growth curves for each species. in addition, given that ﬁsh growth can be highly system-speciﬁc (devries & frie 1996), fast-growth (mean + 20%) and slow- growth (mean ) 20%) scenarios also were modeled to provide robustness to predictions and generality to results. simulations were conducted for three growth intervals for each species including ages 3–4, 5–6, and 7–8 years. approximation of age-speciﬁc ﬁsh size and growth. age- speciﬁc estimates of ﬁsh size and growth were needed to predict annual food consumption. modeling of daily food consumption incorporated estimates of stomach fullness, which were expressed as a proportion of ﬁsh model parameterization. our goal was to estimate mean daily food consumption separately for each study species throughout an average 1-year period for each of river and lake systems. each simulation covered a 365-day period beginning july the eight table 1. generalized weight–length regression equations and weight-at-age estimates used for each species in this evaluation. species generalized weight–length equations weight interval age 3–4 (weight gain, g) weight interval age 5–6 (weight gain, g) weight interval age 7–8 (weight gain, g) weight data were used to generate estimates of stomach fullness for each species during simulations. tl ¼ total length in mm;

demauro & miranda 1990; keast & fox 1992; driscoll & miranda 1999). (i.e., weight of the generalized evacuation model of he & wurtsbaugh (1993) was based on 121 published gastric evacuation estimates that included 22 species of freshwater ﬁshes (weights 10–1300 g wet weight) temperatures ranging from 2 to 27 °c. at water however, none of our study species were inclu- ded in the development of equation 2, and tempera- ture study systems approximated the thermal minima and maxima used by he and wurtsbaugh. thus, to add robustness to our some of our ranges for 88 predictions, we generated 1000 estimates of food consumption for each day of each simulation using random estimates of the evacuation model coefﬁcients and meal size. random estimates of the evacuation model coefﬁcients were generated within triangular constraints of the 90% conﬁdence intervals for each model coefﬁcient (miranda et al. 2001). likewise, random estimates of meal size were generated within triangular constraints of a mean stomach fullness of 1% and a range of 0–4%. the actual meal size in wet weight was based on projected ﬁsh weight during a given day of the simulation. as daily water temper- atures for each system were daily means from several years of data, estimates were believed to be reason- ably precise and therefore ﬁxed for each day simula- ted. sensitivity analyses. sensitivity analyses were used to assess reliability of predicted food consumption and the relative importance of selected model parameters. variability of model output was simulated with probabilistic (monte carlo) assessment methodology wherein values of model parameters were randomly selected from statistical distributions. sensitivity ana- lyses of the food consumption model were generated by altering the ﬁve primary model parameters (water temperature, stomach fullness, and the intercept and slope coefﬁcients from the gastric evacuation model) by ±5, 10, 20, and 30%. each parameter was varied individually with the others held to their original values. random values of each adjusted parameter were drawn from within triangular constraints of each, as described earlier. following each simulation, the resulting percent change in annual food consumption was used as an index of the model’s sensitivity to that parameter. biomass models model parameterization. our goal was to determine if biomass of eight ﬁsh species changed substantially according to a latitudinal gradient. biomass data were obtained from a data set containing estimates for ﬁsh species in 396 u.s. reservoirs. reservoir estimates were compiled primarily from state ﬁsh and game agencies from florida north to maryland and the ohio river and west to kansas and texas. thirty-two additional river biomass estimates were obtained for the upper and lower mississippi river (cobb et al. 1984; pitlo 1987). biomass data were compiled from over a large geographic area that spanned nearly 16° latitude (26.6–42.2°n) to )107.2°w). using these data, we constructed least- squares linear regression models of loge ﬁsh biomass versus latitude, longitude, and latitude–longitude inter- action for each study species, and used these models to ()72.4 longitude and 35° estimate the expected biomass for each study system, such that: expected logc ðfish biomass + 1þ ¼ b0 þ b1ðlatitudeþ þ b2 ðlongitudeþ þ b3 ðinteractionþ ð3þ where b0–b3 were estimated parameters. all eight of the species ⁄ groups were modeled using the biomass approach. zero biomass observations for each species were excluded from modeling. results food consumption models (table 2). the average length of thermal differences existed among study areas. in northern lake michigan, water temperatures did not exceed 20 °c at any time of the year, and were >15 °c only from mid-july through mid-september (table 2). the approximate growing season for warmwater ﬁshes (period with temperatures p15 °c) was estimated to )1 (21% of the year). at other be about 75 days æ year end of the spectrum, the lower mississippi river contained water temperatures exceeding 20 °c during 41% of the year; overall, 55% of the days were 15 °c or warmer the growing season in the lower mississippi river was )1. the rank order of estimated to be 200 days æ year warmest to coolest systems did not strictly correspond with latitude. the ohio river, which ﬂows approxi- mately east to west and drains the mid-atlantic highlands region, was, on average, warmer than the upper mississippi river pool 26 despite higher latitude. similarly, the fox river and upper missis- sippi river pool 4 were warmer than lake erie. in spite of its latitude, lake erie was the second coolest system and had the second shortest growing season for warmwater ﬁshes—only 34% of the year (table 2). latitudinal variation in annual food consumption temperature. for common carp, paralleled water modeling ﬁsh predation impacts on zebra mussels annual food consumption decreased 0.74 kg per degree latitude for age 3–4 years, 1.45 kg for age 5–6 years, and 2.07 kg for age 7–8 years (fig. 2). similarly, respective decreases per degree latitude at ages 3–4, 5–6, and 7–8 years were 0.47, 0.97, and 1.72 kg for freshwater drum (fig. 2), and 0.23, 0.79, and 1.66 kg for channel catﬁsh (fig. 2). these decreases translated into approximately 50% reduc- tions in annual food consumption between the lower mississippi river (warmest southernmost system) and northern lake

was high and varied in magnitude among cohorts. differences in food con- sumption were directly attributable to size differences incorporated into modeling from stomach fullness values. for instance,

exceeded that of freshwater drum by 55% for age 3–4 years, 48% for age 5–6 years, and 22% for age 7–8 years. similarly, common carp consumption exceeded channel catﬁsh by 207% for age 3–4 years, 84% for age 5–6 years, and 24% for age 7–8 years; freshwater drum consumption exceeded that of chan- nel catﬁsh by 99% for age 3–4, 24% for age 5–6, and 2% for age 7–8 cohorts. results suggested that among- species variation in food consumption became smaller as size increased. thus, ﬁsh species size structure may be important in assessing a population’s ability to impact zebra mussels. biomass models the database used to generate biomass-based food consumption contained few estimates from latitudes higher than 39°n (approximately kansas, missouri, and the ohio river) and many from the

by increasing latitude. roughly the longitudinal position of southern united states, especially between )83°w and )98°w longitude (tennessee and alabama west to kansas and texas). multiple linear regression models of biomass as a function of latitude, longitude, and latitude–longitude interaction were highly variable (table 3). models indicated the predicted biomass of the eight study species combined increased an average of 24% from 32 to 42°n (longitude held constant at )90°w, the mississippi river). whereas six of eight models were signiﬁcant, r2-values were generally low, ranging only from 0.03 to 0.21 for the signiﬁcant models. the low r2-values suggested substantial variability in the biomass relationships, likely because other variables besides latitude and longitude inﬂuence biomass, and biomass estimates derived from cove-rotenone surveys frequently contain some error (bettoli & maceina 1996). the models suggested no signiﬁcant relation- ships between biomass and latitude for common carp, freshwater drum, channel catﬁsh, and blue catﬁsh. however, signiﬁcant relationships were detected for redhorses, river carpsucker, and spotted sucker. for 90 these species, each of the relationship between biomass and latitude was positive, meaning that biomasses generally increased with latitude. models indicated that biomass increased an average of 78% for redhorses, 426% for river carpsucker, and 55% for spotted sucker between latitudes 32 and 42°n at )90°w (table 3). decreases (20–60%) and increases (15–41%) observed for other study species were not statistically signiﬁcant. the 32 and 42°n latitude and )90°w longitude coordinates were arbitrarily selected for demonstration purposes; predictions would be different at other combinations of latitude and longi- tude because of latitude–longitude interaction in each model. the signiﬁcant sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis of the parameters used in the food consumption model

decreased by 30%. differences in stomach fullness were intermediate between these two parameters (table 4). discussion modeling indicated that food consumption by indi- vidual ﬁshes was inversely related to latitude. results were mainly related to the differing thermal regimes of the selected study systems, which differed not only in annual minima and maxima but also in the lengths of growing seasons for warmwater ﬁshes. this observa- tion was consistent with three representative species likely to consume zebra mussels, namely common carp, freshwater drum, and channel catﬁsh. although we can only speculate, results likely would have been similar with all of the other study species. further- more, although rates of food consumption differed greatly among species, the proportional differences in annual consumption across latitudes were approxi- mately the same for each species, with consumption in the lower mississippi river, the warmest and south- ernmost system, being over 100% greater than that predicted for northern lake michigan, the coolest and northernmost system (assuming average growth). thus, if ﬁsh biomass were assumed constant, ﬁshes in northern u.s. waters appeared to have less inherent potential to impact zebra mussel populations by direct predation than those in southern waters. 91 eggleton et al. latitudinal differences in food consumption dem- onstrated here actually might be more pronounced than indicated by modeling. growth scenarios repre- sented averages from numerous studies from northern and southern systems. given the inherent thermal differences among systems and regional differences in the lengths of growing seasons, it is likely that most northern ﬁsh populations would tend towards the slow-growth scenario (i.e., lower annual con- sumption) whereas more southern populations would fall somewhere between the average- and fast-growth scenarios (i.e., greater annual consumption). in the case of age 3–4 common carp, fast-growth annual consumption in the lower mississippi river exceeded slow-growth annual consumption in northern lake michigan by over 600%. similar proportional differ- ences were observed with the other species and cohorts. exceptions would likely exist in some northern rivers and lakes whereby ﬁsh growth and metabolic demands would be more similar to that observed in southern systems. however, generally speaking, it is likely that food consumption by ﬁshes in many southern systems would exceed most northern waters by more than 100% during typical years. simulations depicted food consumption the amounts that individual ﬁshes would likely consume given average growth and thermal conditions. we also assume that the relative impact on zebra mussel populations by ﬁshes (e.g., proportion of the diet, rates of feeding) is constant across different aquatic sys- tems. however, the biomass of a species in a particular system dictates the potential to impact zebra mussels. analyses indicated that the biomass of ﬁve ﬁsh species did not change signiﬁcantly within the latitudes considered, but biomass of three ﬁsh species ⁄ groups increased with latitude. the lack of comparable biomass data from extreme northern u.s. systems that contain high densities of zebra mussels (e.g., wiscon- sin, michigan, ohio, new york, and the great lakes) restricted our analysis. however, although warmwater ﬁsh faunas are certainly present in northern systems, aquatic systems in these regions generally support greater biomasses of percids, esocids, and salmonids and lower biomasses of warmwater species like common carp, freshwater drum, catﬁshes, and cato- stomid suckers than comparable systems in the central and southern u.s. (loftus & regier 1972; lee et al. 1980; jude & leach 1999; sanders et al. 1999). lake erie may be an exception to this generalization as it presently contains healthy populations of common carp, freshwater drum, and channel catﬁsh (leach & nepszy 1976). nevertheless, between 32 and 42°n (at )90°w), predicted biomass of the eight study species combined increased by only 24%. given that within this range of latitudes consumption decreased by 50%, 92 our results strongly support that northern ﬁsh com- munities have less inherent potential to impact zebra mussel populations by direct predation than their southern u.s. counterparts, presumably because of lack of biomass and bioenergetic constraints imposed by regional water temperatures. although we acknowledge that there is uncertainty in our predictions, previous studies lend support to our suggestions. the role of predators in regulating or suppressing prey in freshwater communities is com- plex and controversial (e.g., thorp 1986), but previous studies have indicated that predators may have a signiﬁcant impact on dreissenid populations. evidence from european rivers and lakes (e.g., daoulas & economidis 1984; de nie 1982; smit et al. 1993) suggested that vertebrate predators may be responsible for keeping dreissenid densities below 3000 mus- )2 compared to densities in the hudson sels æ m )2) and ohio (approximately 30 000 mussels æ m )2) rivers (thorp et al. 1998b). (40 000 mussels æ m thorp et al. (1998b) also indicated that resident ﬁshes impacted zebra mussels but that impacts were greater among lower density populations. given the 100% or greater increase in food consumption in the lower mississippi river compared to northern lake mich- igan (depending on the growth scenario used), the lower densities of zebra mussels in southern u.s. waters may be consistent with the increased preda- tion impacts of ﬁsh communities in those waters. signiﬁcant ﬁsh use of zebra mussels already docu- mented from the region (magoulick & lewis 2002; eggleton & schramm 2003) provides support for this contention. thus, native ﬁshes in southern u.s. waters may have a competitive edge in controlling or restricting zebra mussel populations because of bioenergetic advantages not possible in northern rivers and lakes. our results were also consistent with those of previous in situ studies despite the different approach and scales of the evaluations. thorp et al. (1998b) reported from enclosure–exclosure experiments that ﬁshes had a stronger effect on zebra mussels in the upper mississippi river than those in the ohio river. some evidence of size-selective predation existed in the upper mississippi river, presumably because ﬁshes were able to more easily select larger mussels from less lower density populations. although they reported that zebra mussels were collected from the guts of several resident species (e.g., smallmouth buffalo, channel and ﬂathead cat- ﬁshes pylodictis olivaris, and river carpsucker), they did not discuss the possibility that differing ﬁsh faunas between regions might have played a role in their results. similarly, robinson & wellborn (1988) did not discuss the role that ﬁsh faunas might have played in their results with ﬁsh predation impacts on asiatic clumped, clams, although their study contained only one study system. other factors unrelated to ﬁsh predation are also important in regulating zebra mussel abundance in southern u.s. waters. zebra mussel invasions through- out north america have occurred more rapidly through interconnected waterways than in more isola- ted natural lakes (kraft & johnson 2000). given that most southern reservoirs are located on large rivers and are interconnected through the mississippi river and its tributary rivers (e.g., ohio, missouri, arkansas, tennessee, and cumberland), most waterbodies in the southern u.s. are easily susceptible to invasion by zebra mussels. however, southern river and lake systems in the u.s. are warmer and more turbid than more northern systems, which may compromise the survival and invasive capacities of zebra mussels and other invasive molluscs (e.g., quagga mussel d. bu- gensis) into some systems (mackie & schloesser 1996; allen et al. 1999; thorp et al. 1998a, 2002). zebra mussels have thrived in temperate northern u.s. waters where summertime water temperatures usually do not exceed 27–28 °c (mcmahon 1996). aldridge et al. (1995) further indicated from laboratory experi- ments that survival without extensive mortality could temperatures up to 32 °c in laboratory occur at experiments. however, allen et al. (1999) reported from ﬁeld studies in the lower mississippi river that although annual growth was similar to that in northern regions, the pattern of growth was not, with shell growth ceasing and tissue condition declining during july and august when water temperatures approached 29–30 °c. during these mid-summer periods, mussel mortality individuals >15 mm. they concluded that summer mortality events were probable with zebra mussels in the lower mississippi river, and that the extent of annual mortality would depend on the duration of extreme summertime water temperatures, population size structure, and condition of mussels during the pre- ceding spring. increased, especially for additional research has indicated that zebra mussels are also less tolerant to anoxia than most north american bivalves, and that mussels may be restricted to well-oxygenated rivers and epilimnetic zones of reservoirs and lakes (mihuc et al. 1999; burks et al. 2002). furthermore, zebra mussels have been shown to be more sensitive to aerial exposure via drawdown practices than either asiatic clams (another exotic) or other unionids (tucker et al. 1997). thus, it is highly improbable that zebra mussel populations would remain static across the river and lake systems we modeled. physicochemical conditions and ﬁsh preda- tion mechanisms likely work in concert to limit zebra mussel abundance and expansion throughout most southern u.s. waters. modeling ﬁsh predation impacts on zebra mussels resumen 1. modelamos la tasa de consumo anual de alimento y biomasa para varias especies de peces en una muestra representativa de rı´os y lagos del este de norte ame´rica. combinamos los resultados para evaluar el potencial relativo que estas especies de peces pueden ejercer sobre la abundancia del mejillo´ n asia´tico dreissena polymorpha. las predicciones sobre con- sumo para peces en lagos y rı´os del sur fueron ma´s del 100% comparadas con sistemas septentrionales. esto se puede deber a las temperaturas anuales ma´s altas y aumentos en la demanda metabo´ lica de peces en rı´os y lagos del sur de norte ame´rica. 2. la biomasa de varias especies claves de peces que consumen d. polymorpha no cambio´ apreciablemente con latitud. la biomasa de algunos peces que consumen d. poly- morpha aumento´ signiﬁcativamente con latitud, pero este aumento no era de una magnitud suﬁciente para compensar la disminucio´ n en el consumo de alimento. 3. nuestros resultados apoyan generalmente la premisa de que los peces en rı´os y lagos del sur de los estados unidos (ee.uu.) tienen un potencial inherente mayor para poder controlar d. polymorpha. nuestras simulaciones proporcionan una explicacio´ n parcial de por que´ las invasiones de d. pol- ymorpha no han sido tan
