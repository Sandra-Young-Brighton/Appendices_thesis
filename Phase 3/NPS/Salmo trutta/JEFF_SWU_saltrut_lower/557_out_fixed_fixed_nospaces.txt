grossman et al. 1982, 1990; schlosser 1982; freeman et al. 1988; przybyl- ski 1994; poff & allan 1995; grossman et al. 1998; matthews 1998), and research on these assemblages they are affected by both strong has shown that variability the environment (grossman et al. 1998; and references therein) and by biotic interactions such as competition (gorman 1988; greenberg 1988) and predation (lemly 1985; physicochemical in power et al. 1985; harvey & stewart 1991; gilliam et al. 1993). much of the inference regarding the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in structuring stream ﬁsh assemblages has focused on whether a variety of assemblage properties (e.g., species richness, ﬁsh density, absolute or relative abundances) are stable or highly variable over ecologically signiﬁcant temporal and spatial scales (grossman et al. 1998). disagreement is present among researchers, because both variable and stable stream ﬁsh assemblages exist, although the former have been recorded from at least four continents (grossman et al. 1990; przybylski 1994; hugueny et al. 1995; grossman et al. 1998; matthews 1998; oberdorff et al. 1998, 2001; merigoux et al. 1999). 256 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00102.x the fact that previous studies have shown that stream ﬁsh assemblages display different levels of variation may be the result of several factors. first, it is likely that many of these differences are real – that mechanisms such as resource limitation or predation that can produce relatively stable assemblages may be very important in some systems and unimportant in others (harvey & stewart 1991; grossman et al. 1998). second, it also is possible that different analytical tools may produce different results, and stream ﬁsh ecologists have not settled on a common methodology for addressing questions of assemblage variation (grossman et al. 1990; matthews 1998; jackson et al. 2001). finally, it also is clear that research conducted using different levels of spatial (e.g., drainage, stream, reach, patch), temporal (sea- son, year, multi-year) and assemblage (species rich- ness, diversity, relative abundance, etc.) resolution may produce different results, and that studies must be linked to the level of variability deemed ecologically signiﬁcant (rahel 1990; grossman et al. 1995; lohr & fausch 1997; syms & jones 1999). at present, most studies of assemblage variation in stream ﬁshes have been conducted at the reach scale (e.g., 30–100 m long stream segments, but see schlosser 1982; bart 1989; lohr & fausch 1997; taylor 2000; peterson & rabeni 2001), although this spatial scale is sufﬁciently coarse that many inhabitants may not encounter each other (hill & grossman 1987; petty & grossman 2004; matthews & marsh-matthews 2005). quantiﬁcation of assemblage variability also is important because, both thompson (1998, 1999) and w.j. matthews & e. marsh-matthews (unpublished data) posit that studies of assemblage variation may yield insights into the level of coevolution potentially present within assemblages. in brief, if species do not consistently co-occur over at time scales, then it is unlikely that coevolutionary relation- ships (e.g., competitive niche shifts) will evolve because of a lack of signiﬁcant contact. hence, an assessment of whether ﬁsh assemblages are stable or variable may yield insights into the level of coevolu- tion that may be present within these assemblages. least ecological one of the early attempts to synthesise relationships between assemblage variability and habitat structure at a level at which ﬁshes clearly had the potential to interact (i.e., habitat patches – individual rifﬂes and pools) was conducted by schlosser (1982) on small warm-water streams in the mid-western united states. schlosser (1987) proposed that small streams repre- sented an ecological gradient along which upstream ﬁsh assemblages were relatively variable and down- stream assemblages relatively stable. the causal factors producing this pattern involve stability of the physical complexity, with upstream reaches being physically variable environment and habitat stream ﬁsh assemblage variability (temperature, ﬂow, etc.) and structurally simple, whereas downstream reaches have the opposite char- acteristics. thus, upstream assemblages are affected primarily by variations in physical habitat, whereas, downstream assemblages are relatively stable and regulated mainly through biotic interactions such as competition and predation (schlosser 1982, 1987). within a reach these predictions can be extended to rifﬂe and pool patches; hence, assemblages within rifﬂe patches should be more variable than those in pool patches (schlosser 1982, 1987). the rifﬂe-pool level predictions of the habitat stability–assemblage structure hypothesis have been tested almost exclu- sively in mid-western streams of the united states (schlosser 1982, 1987; bart 1989; gelwick 1990; taylor & warren 2001) and as a consequence, their generality is unknown. characteristics within-patches over in previous work (er}os et al. 2003) we demonstra- ted that a relatively undisturbed hungarian stream displayed a continuum in the physical structure of habitat patches ranging from rifﬂes to pools. we also showed that ﬁsh assemblage structure varied in a continuous rather than discrete manner along this gradient, although patches at the end points of the continuum clearly contained distinct assemblages. in this paper, we evaluate temporal variation in ﬁsh assemblage a 36-month period and test several predictions regarding habitat stability and assemblage stability. speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst describe temporal variation (i.e., change within a patch over time) in the physical habitat structure of patches and then compare this variation to variation in species richness, ﬁsh density and assem- blage composition (i.e., relative abundances) of ﬁshes inhabiting individual patches. in addition, we examine the possible effects of a broader scale environmental disturbance (i.e., a 100-year ﬂood) on the abundance and length frequency patterns of ﬁshes and its role in within-patch assemblage organisation. materials and methods detailed descriptions of the study site including general chemical and physical site characteristics can be found in er}os et al. (2003), schmera & er}os (2004) and er}os & grossman (2005), hence, they will not be described in detail in this paper. we studied the bernecei stream (bo¨rzso¨ny mountains, hungary), a second order, headwater tributary of the danube river. the bernecei is one of the last remaining semi-pristine streams in europe, and ﬂows through one of the least impacted area of the danube-ipoly national park (er}os et al. 2003). it serves as a reference stream for submontane headwater ecosystems in hungary. the ﬁsh fauna of the bernecei stream consists of stone loach barbatula nine native ﬁsh species: 257 ero}s & grossman carpathicus barbatula (l.), minnow phoxinus phoxinus (l.), chub leuciscus cephalus (l.) dace leuciscus leuciscus (l.), carpathian barbel barbus (heckel), burbot lota lota (l.), gudgeon gobio gobio (l.), nase chondrostoma nasus (l.), spirlin alburnoides bipunctatus (bloch). based on the 15,376 specimens captured in our sampling, minnow, stone loach, and chub represented 63.2%, 25.6%, and 7.6% of the ﬁsh fauna respectively. the remaining species represented <4% of the total numerical density and consequently, were lumped in a single ‘rare species’ group. sampling protocol (ii) late spring (may or june), to compare ﬁsh assemblage characteristics to both among- and within-patch variation in habitat structure we sampled ﬁshes and habitat structure in 13 habitat patches four times annually between august 1999 and june 2002 (12 seasonal samples/patch). samples were collected during: (i) early spring (end of march or early april), (iii) summer (august), and (iv) autumn (end of october or november). we deﬁned patches as areas of relatively homogeneous habitat (e.g., rifﬂes) bounded by areas of dissimilar habitat (see er}os et al. 2003; for a more detailed description of patch identiﬁcation criteria). the combined length of all patches was approximately 190 m and sampling took 3–5 days to complete. to quantify the physical structure of patches, we used the transect method of gorman & karr (1978) and schlosser (1982), and measured the following vari- ables: average depth (ln transformed for analyses) and velocity (ln), average amount of wood (ln), substratum composition (square-root coverage (square-root arcsin) (see er}os et al. 2003 for a detailed description). we used mean, rather than maximum or minimum values, for physical structure data because they best represent the ‘average’ conditions experi- enced by ﬁshes. during the study the sampling area had an average width of 3 m, an average depth of 0.26 m and gravel was the dominant substratum. the bernecei is well shaded and has an intact overstorey, hence there was little variation in shading or tempera- ture among patches (er}os et al. 2003). arcsin), root we quantiﬁed ﬁsh density in patches by block- netting the upstream and downstream ends of each patch and making three consecutive passes with a two- person backpack electroﬁshing team (3000 type; deka, gera¨tebau, marsberg, germany, 350–450 v, pdc). most ﬁsh were measured to the nearest mm (standard length) in the ﬁeld and returned in the stream. the proportion measured represented 34.3%, 74.7%, 97.3% and 99.9% of the total catches of minnow, stone loach, chub and rare species respect- ively. we measured almost all specimens (>90%) in 1999 and the ﬁrst half of 2000 to distinguish three age 258 groups (0+, 1+, and ‡2+). however we did not measure most 0+ minnow and stone loach in subse- quent years to reduce handling disturbance. the chub population consisted predominantly of adult (i.e., 1+ and older) specimens, the age of which could not be reliably distinguished based on length. we constructed seasonal length–frequency histograms (lfh) which yielded information on the length/age distribution patterns of the populations through time. by conven- tion we used 1 january as the birthday of all ﬁsh. to save space we pooled lfh for rare species (see fig. 6b). finally, we calculated ﬁsh densities in patches by dividing abundance in the patch by the area of that patch at the time of sampling. statistical analysis we compared the physical structure of patches by conducting a principal component analysis (pca; correlation matrix solution) on mean values of physical habitat data from seasonal samples for each patch (see er}os et al. 2003). altogether 156 points (12 seasonal samples for 13 patches) were ordinated based on physical habitat measurements. we only interpreted components that had eigenvalues greater than 1.0 and also represented ecologically meaningful patterns of habitat variation (grossman et al. 1998). to quantify variability in the habitat structure of individual patches, we calculated standard deviations (sd) for the mean pc score of each habitat patch on the ﬁrst pc axis (see results). we tested whether habitat variation in patches over time (i.e., temporal habitat variation) was corre- lated with their position on the habitat gradient (i.e., physical habitat structure – pca score) by comparing patch sd values to mean ﬁrst principal component (pc1) scores using spearman’s rs. essentially this examined whether within-patch habitat variation was constant across patch types (i.e., rifﬂe, run, pool) over the 36-month study. we used sds to quantify variation in habitat structure and assemblage structure (see below), because the multivariate statistics used for these analyses produced negative scores, which pre- vented the use of cvs (grossman et al. 1990). we assessed both within and among-patch variab- ility in ﬁsh assemblage characteristics using three different assemblage properties: species richness, ﬁsh density and assemblage composition (i.e., relative abundance) data. to determine whether either mean species richness or variation in species richness (measured as coefﬁcient of variation, cv) were correlated with either the habitat characteristics of a patch (mean score on pc1 for 12 seasonal samples), or variation in these characteristics (sd of pc1 scores for a patch), we compared these variables using spear- man’s rs. all subsequent mention of correlation analyses refers to tests made with spearman’s rs. we performed identical analyses on ﬁsh density data. we also tested for a potential relationship between a 100-year ﬂood and changes in ﬁsh abundance by correlating abundance values (pooled over all patches) during the study period from summer 1999 to late spring 2002, with time from the ﬂood (i.e., rank order). although the summer of 1999 was unusually wet (see fig. 1 in er}os et al. 2003), a 100-year ﬂood occurred in 21–22 june 1999 in the study area causing drastic changes landscape (a´ . bezeczky, danube ipoly national park, personal communication). in the morphology of the we used correspondence analysis (ca) to identify both among- and within-patch relationships in assem- blage composition (i.e., relative abundances of spe- cies). axis selection was based on criteria described in ter braak (1985) and er}os et al. (2003). we used ca rather than pca for assemblage structure data because it is more robust with respect to nonlinear responses of assemblages to ecological gradients (ter braak 1985). to quantify assemblage structure for each patch, we calculated mean ca scores for the 13 patches on the ﬁrst two ca axes (see results) based on the 12 seasonal samples per patch (ca ordination contained 156 points which were reduced to 13 mean values for the 13 patches). we also quantiﬁed temporal within- patch variation in assemblage composition by sum- ming the sds of each patch on each ca axis (see grossman et al. 1998 for a similar approach with habitat data). we then tested hypotheses regarding assemblage properties (and variation) and habitat variation by testing for correlations between these variables and the habitat structure of each patch (i.e., location of each patch on the habitat gradient – pc1 score) and temporal habitat variation within that patch (sd of pc1 scores). results

velocities, more erosional substrata (rock, stone and gravel) and less depositional substrata (tree roots and silty-sand)]. by contrast, patches with strong positive scores were pool-like (i.e., deep, with low velocities, less erosional substrata and more depositional substrata). run-like patches had scores and characteristics that were intermediate between rifﬂe and pool patches. all patch types (i.e., rifﬂe, run or pool) displayed similar within-patch habitat heterogeneities, because patches were evenly dispersed across pc1 (fig. 1). nonethe- less, we observed a positive correlation between mean pc1 score of a patch and its sd (rs ¼ 0.731, p < 0.01; fig. 2) indicating that temporal variation in the habitat characteristics of individual pool patches was greater than that for run and rifﬂe patches. given that rifﬂe and pool patches displayed similar absolute values on pc1 (although one set of values was negative and the other positive), this ﬁnding cannot be attributed to a positive correlation between variance and mean values for individual patches. fish assemblage properties and habitat variation the deepest pool patch had the highest species richness (eight species), whereas the shallowest rifﬂe patch displayed the lowest species richness (one species). mean species richness was strongly correla- ted with mean pc1 score of a patch (i.e., habitat characteristics, rs ¼

0.302, p > 0.05; fig. 3c). there were few signiﬁcant correlations (two of 34 cases) between ﬁsh densities or variation in ﬁsh densities (see table 1 for variation in ﬁsh densities) in a patch and either patch habitat characteristics, or 260 temporal variability in within-patch habitat character- istics (p’s > 0.05; table 2). a comparison of seasonal density changes for species in each of the 13 patches indicated that variability in ﬁsh density was caused primarily by variation in minnow density, although rifﬂe patches also were inﬂuenced by changes in stone loach density (fig. 4). fish density tended to decrease in rifﬂe and intermediate (i.e., run) habitats between autumn and early spring and increase in late spring, whereas an opposite pattern was present in pool patches (fig. 4). total ﬁsh abundance (pooled values from all patches) within the study area increased signiﬁcantly during the study (rs ¼ 0.867, p < 0.01). the abun- dance of individual species also increased signiﬁcantly time (chub rs ¼ 0.648, p < 0.05; minnow over rs ¼ 0.588, rs ¼ 0.867, p < 0.01; p < 0.05), with minnows showing the strongest increase. the sole exception to this pattern was stone loach (rs ¼ )0.189, p > 0.05). species rare length–frequency histograms indicated a consistent length/age distribution pattern of 0+ and adult ﬁshes for the two most abundant species (i.e., minnow and stone loach, fig. 5a,b). the 0+ cohort of both minnow and stone loach was almost completely lacking in summer 1999 samples but did appear in autumn samples. the 1999 cohort was not readily separable from the 2000 cohort, because of the small size of the former. in later years, all age classes were readily separable on the basis of length. the lfh for the chub and rare species showed that adult specimens domin- ated these populations with the exception of nase (fig. 6a,b). correspondence analysis of ﬁsh relative abundance data depicted a gradient in ﬁsh assemblage composi- tion from patches dominated by stone loach to patches with increasing dominance of chub and rare species (fig. 7). the minnow was abundant in all patch types, although it reached its highest relative abundance in patches with intermediate ca scores. comparisons between the physical characteristics of patches and ca scores indicated that ca1 was negatively correlated with pc1 (rs ¼ )0.874, p < 0.001), which demon- strates that stone loach dominated ﬁsh assemblages in rifﬂe patches. in contrast, ca2 was positively correlated with pc1 (rs ¼ 0.736, p < 0.01), which conﬁrms that the relative abundance of chub and rare species increased in pool patches. consequently, the most diverse assemblage also was found in the patch type (i.e., pools) with the greatest within-patch habitat variation. temporal variation in ﬁsh assemblage composition within a patch (i.e., summed sd of the ﬁrst two ca axis score) was positively correlated with both the physical characteristics of a patch (i.e., pc1 score, rs ¼ 0.665, p < 0.05), and with temporal within- stream ﬁsh assemblage variability table 1. mean total ﬁsh density (ﬁsh/m2; upper rows) and seasonal and total coefﬁcient of variation (cv; lower rows) of

previous ﬁndings for this system (er}os et al. 2003), ﬁsh assemblage structure displayed continuous change over the habitat gradient, but was relatively consistent within a patch. the latter result suggests that small- scale movements did not strongly affect our results (i.e., we did not observe the high within-patch variability that would result from substantial numbers of ﬁsh moving in and out of patches over time). comparison of our results with the predictions of the habitat stability model (schlosser 1982, 1987) yielded mixed results. first, in contrast to the habitat stability model, we found that temporal within-patch habitat variation was highest in pool patches during the 3-year study period. the second contrasting result was that both species richness and assemblage composition (ca scores) were higher/more diverse in more vari- ables patches (i.e., pool patches). our third contrasting result was that within-patch assemblage variability was relatively low (i.e., pool patch assemblages and rifﬂe patch assemblages were equally variable), and not strongly affected by changes in within-patch habitat structure. fourth, variability of species richness and ﬁsh density were not signiﬁcantly correlated with either the habitat gradient or within-patch habitat variation (neutral result). finally, in concordance with the habitat stability model, we found a signiﬁcant positive relationship between the variability of ﬁsh relative abundance data (i.e., summed sds of ca scores) and temporal within-patch habitat variation. consequently, although there were shifts in ﬁsh

characteristics showed different (positive, negative or neutral) responses to the habitat gradient and within-patch habitat variability. a possible explanation of the differences between the predictions of schlosser’s (1982, 1987) model and our ﬁndings, is that ﬁsh assemblage variability in the bernecei stream was determined predominantly by habitat generalist species (e.g., minnow and stone loach; see er}os et al. 2003). the relative abundance of habitat specialist species (i.e., chub and the rare species) was their within-patch dynamics did not change assemblage level variability substantially. our results are in accordance with the predictions of peterson & rabeni (2001), who found that rifﬂe-pool level variability of ﬁsh assemblages depends on the ratio of habitat generalist versus specialist species. low and hence, although our study focused primarily on the elucidation of ﬁsh assemblage characteristics at the patch-level, broader scale environmental variation also affected our results. we detected signiﬁcant increases in the densities of most species during our study and it these increases are related to the effects of the 100 year ﬂood that occurred just before our ﬁrst sample (see fig. 1. in is possible that 262 species in these study period. er}os et al. 2003). this ﬂood could have produced high mortality of the species in our site, which then gradually increased in density during the more environmentally benign 3-year in addition, seasonal lfh of the most abundant species (i.e., minnow and stone loach) suggest that the ﬂood affected recruitment in 1999. although the early summer ﬂood may have displaced larvae born in late spring, protracted spawning of both minnow and stone loach (mills 1987; er}os 2001) produced recruits for the year 1999. numerous reports have shown that ﬂoods produce substantial mortality in stream ﬁsh populations (e.g., grossman et al. 1982; schlosser 1985; matthews 1986, 1998); nonetheless, some stream ﬁsh assemblages are highly resilient (based on presence/absence data) via rapid recolonisation and reproduction (matthews 1986; meffe & sheldon 1990; peterson & bayley 1993). as we have no pre-ﬂood samples, we can only say that our results are consistent with a ﬂood effect, however, they may also have been produced by some other effect that occurred concurrently with or just before the ﬂood. our surveys suggest that the density of minnows in the site increased via local reproduction in patches, whereas that of chub and the ﬁve rare species 20 15 10 5 0 30 20 10 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 20 15 10 5 0 20

thus, both local and regional-scale processes affected the characteristics of rifﬂe and pool assemblages in the bernecei stream. abundance of the stone loach was relatively stable, which ﬁt the

(e.g., both pool and rifﬂe patches maintained similar within-patch ca scores at the beginning and end of the study). consequently, changes in density did not produce shifts in patch (i.e., habitat) use, given the range of densities observed during our study. substantial changes in abundance the habitats certainly can produce expansion of occupied by ﬁsh populations (matthews 1998), however habitat shifts in many stream ﬁsh populations seem to be more commonly linked to changes in habitat availability than to changes in abundance (grossman & ratajzak 1998). scale can affect the ﬁndings of ﬁsh assemblage structure studies (lohr & fausch 1997; syms & jones 1999; jackson et al. 2001) and unlike many previous studies of ﬁsh assemblage structure, our research was conducted at the patch scale. sampling at the patch scale ensures that species collected in the same sample will have a reasonable probability of interacting and may yield insights into the likelihood of coevolution- ary relationships such as competition-based niche shifts (w.j. matthews & e. marsh-matthews unpub- lished data). in the bernecei stream, variability in the assemblage characteristics of both pool and rifﬂe patches was relatively similar. at present, it would 264 appear that the inhabitants of this stream have the to develop coevolutionary interactions, potential although whether or not require further study including experimentation. this occurs will in conclusion both habitat structure and ﬁsh assemblage properties changed in a continuous rather than a discrete manner in the bernecei stream, although the continuum end points clearly represented distinct habitat patches/ﬁsh assemblages. broader scale environmental disturbance (i.e., extreme ﬂood event) may have signiﬁcantly affected changes in absolute and relative abundance, although ﬁsh assem- blage composition remained relatively stable during the study. our data suggest that environmental vari- ation plays a signiﬁcant role in the dynamics of ﬁsh assemblages in the bernecei stream, and that the relationship between assemblage variability and spa- tio-temporal habitat variability depends on the assem- blage property studied. we believe that other studies conducted at both the patch-level and outside of the mid-western united states will yield insights into the generality of the habitat stability model. resumen 1. durante tres an˜os, examinamos la variabilidad en la estructura del ha´bitat fı´sico y en la riqueza de especies, abundancia y composicio´ n del ensamblaje de peces en 13 parches del rı´o bernecei (hungrı´a). un ana´lisis de compo- nentes principales de los datos de estructura de ha´bitat de los parches revelo´ un gradiente corriente-tabla-poza entre los parches. la variabilidad temporal del ha´bitat incremento signiﬁcativamente desde los parches de corriente a los parches de pozas. 2. las caracterı´sticas de los ensamblajes mostraron cambios relativamente continuos sobre el gradiente de ha´bitat y fueron relativamente estables dentro del mismo parche. las propieda- des de la estructura del ensamblaje (i.e., riqueza de especies, etc.) mostraron respuestas diferentes al gradiente de ha´bitat y a la variabilidad de ha´bitat dentro del parche. en general los parches de pozas tuvieron ensamblajes ma´s diversos y mayor variabi- lidad del ensamblaje dentro del parche que los parches de corrientes. sin embargo, las dina´micas dentro del parche estuvieron esencialmente determinadas por la dina´mica de la poblacio´ n de un generalista de ha´bitat (i.e., phoxinus phoxinus). 3. variabilidad ambiental a gran escala (i.e., la riada ma´s catastro´ ﬁca que se puede producir una vez en cien an˜os) tambie´n parecio´ afectar a las caracterı´sticas del ensamblaje dentro de un parche. 4. nuestros resultados demuestran que la estructura de los ensamblajes de peces esta´ inﬂuenciada por la variabilidad fı´sica (i.e., tanto riadas como variabilidad de ha´bitat espacio-tempo- ral) en el rı´o bernecei. acknowledgements we are grateful to the following individuals for their material and moral support during completion of this project: a´ . berczik, a´ .
