alaska; gape limitation; resource pulse; sorex; subsidy introduction in particular, terrestrial litter through fluxes of stream communities are often heavily supported by riparian resources terrestrial organic matter such as leaf (vannote et al. 1980; wallace et al. 1997) and terrestrial insects (wipfli 1997; kawaguchi & nakano 2001; chan et al. 2007). insects can enhance and stabilise prey resources for stream fishes through differences in their abundance, energetic density and emergence phenology relative to stream derived prey (nakano et al. 1999; wipfli & baxter 2010; sato et al. 2012). however, this work has not emphasised the potential importance of other episodi- cally produced terrestrial prey, such as cicadas (cica- didae, nowlin et al. 2008) or riparian vertebrates, which may occur episodically among years (kor- pim€aki et al. 2005). small mammals are one such example that may provide episodic, but valuable feeding opportunities for freshwater fishes. several species of terrestrial rodents and insectivores have been documented in the diet contents of a variety of freshwater fishes, such as northern pike (esox lucius, lawler 1965), largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides, hodgson & kinsella 1995; schindler et al. 1997), brown_trout (salmo_trutta, cochran & cochran 1999), taimen (hucho_hucho_taimen, ohdachi & seo 2004) and arctic gray- ling (thymallus_arcticus, moore & kenagy 2004; jung et al. 2011). individual rations of mammals in these fishes can be substantial. for example, 42 lemmings (lemmus spp.) were found in a single taimen (h. taimen) at a time when lemming popula- tions were high, while another taimen ate 14 squirrels (sciurus spp., sigunov 1972 cited in ohdachi & seo 2004). even smaller predatory fish, such as arctic correspondence: p. j. lisi, school of aquatic and fishery sciences, university of washington, box 355020, seattle, wa 98195, usa. e-mail: pjlisi@uw.edu 622 doi: 10.1111/eff.12117 grayling, have been observed with several small mammals in an individual fish’s stomach (moore & kenagy 2004). while these occasional observations suggest that predation on mammals by fishes may be widespread among regions and species, they are typi- cally treated as rare and isolated events that are not organised spatially or temporally across watersheds. populations of small terrestrial mammals often fluc- tuate several orders of magnitude over intradecadal scales with well-known functional and numerical responses by their terrestrial predators (e.g., korpim€aki et al. 2005). while aquatic ecologists have largely ignored the potential significance of these episodic foraging opportunities, anglers have long appreciated small mammals as prey for sport fish and design lures specifically made to imitate small swimming mammals. for example, invasive house mice (mus musculus) in new zealand show boom and bust dynamics in response to mast events in native beech trees (nothofagus spp; choquenot & ruscoe 2008), which exhibit a 5-year cycle. mast years attract sport fisheries for anadromous brown_trout (s. trutta) and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) that feast on house mice in small headwater streams. such dynamics have even inspired a sport fishing documentary, once in a blue moon: the fly fishing adventure of a lifetime (mcneil 2009). although the incidence of these episodic subsidies may seem negligible when aver- aged over time, many freshwater fishes are long-lived and therefore may experience several vertebrate prey cycles over a lifetime. yet, predation rates on mammals depend not only on the availability of prey, but also on the ability of individual fishes to capitalise on ephem- eral resources. to exploit small mammalian prey, predatory fish require the behaviorial and physiological capacity to episodic predation by fishes on shrews recognise, capture and digest prey items that are far larger than those typically encountered. indeed, many fishes are capable of swallowing prey orders of magni- tude larger than the prey they most frequently con- sume – prey taxa ranging from small mammals to birds (hodgson & kinsella 1995; schindler et al. 1997; cucherousset et al. 2012). while average daily feeding rates are typically less than half of the maxi- mum consumption rate, excess foraging and digestive capacity enable individuals to exploit rare pulses of prey (armstrong & schindler 2011). fish can achieve daily energy intake rates as high as 9x their basal met- abolic cost (kitchell et al. 1977), giving them the potential to acquire the majority of their annual energy gain over a small portion of a single season (scheuerell et al. 2007; denton et al. 2009; armstrong & bond 2013). although inputs of small mammals to streams may be brief in duration, the behaviorial and physio- logical capacity of fishes suggests that these ephem- eral pulses of food may be ecologically significant. we studied the diet of arctic grayling and rainbow trout, two stream fishes that are native and common in coastal catchments throughout southern alaska, over 13 years in the wood river basin. while both arctic grayling and rainbow trout typically feed on a variety of benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, as well as sal- mon eggs and small fishes (scheuerell et al. 2007; bentley et al. 2012), small mammals occasionally appear in the diet of both species (fig. 1; moore & kenagy 2004). here, we assessed the occurrence of an assemblage of small mammals in the diet of these two fishes among several streams distributed across a sin- gle river basin and explored the spatial extent, ontoge- netic shifts and temporal occurrence of small mammal consumption among years. we found that both large- bodied arctic grayling and rainbow trout episodically fig. 1. a large (42 cm) arctic grayling showing the remains of eight shrews found in its stomach. 623 lisi et al. consumed shrews, every 2–3 years, with particularly large peaks occurring in two of the 13 years. although not continuously present, shrews are a potentially important prey resource for long-lived stream fishes. methods study site this study was conducted in the wood river system (59°34′37″n, 158°48′25″w) that drains into bristol bay in south-western alaska. this 3590 km2 river basin consists of five large, deep, oligotrophic lakes, which are fed by numerous tributaries and connected by short rivers. the lake and stream network supports a valuable commercial fishery for sockeye salmon (o. nerka) and also a large sport fishery for rainbow trout, arctic grayling, arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) and northern pike. this region has a diverse assem- blage of small mammals as potential prey for fishes, including five species of shrews of the genus sorex (s. monticolus, s. cinereus, s. hoyi, s. tundrensis, s. yukonicus) and small such as voles (microtus oeconomus, clethrionomys rutilus), deer mice (peromyscus maniculatus) and collared lem- mings (dicrostonyx groenlandicus; nolan & peirce 1996). rodents data collection we captured arctic grayling and rainbow trout using a fine mesh seine in small streams and angling in rivers during the summer months (june–september) from 2000 to 2012 (bentley et al. 2012). we sam- pled three streams in the river basin 4–6 times per year; lynx, hidden and the little togiak r. (ltr). other streams, pick, elva, kema, little togiak cr. (ltc), stovall, teal, fenno and the wind r. were sampled more opportunistically for spatial compari- son. individuals captured by angling may not be a random representation of the population, biasing for aggressive or larger fish. we assumed that larger fish fed similarly whether captured by seining or by angling. captured fish were anaesthetised and all individuals were measured for fork length (1 mm) and mass (1 g). during each sampling event, we examined the diet of fish via gastric lavage across a representative range in body size (scheuerell et al. 2007; bentley et al. 2012). gut contents were examined in the field, and individual items were enumerated into coarse taxonomic groups (typically order or family). when possible, mam- mals were preserved in ethanol and later identified to species. shrews were identified according to den- tation of the third unicuspid, body length and skull length (nagorsen 1996). their 624 data analyses we compared the frequency of mammal consumption by fish with fork lengths greater than the smallest fish observed with a mammal in its gut over the entire study (298 mm for grayling and 290 mm rainbow trout) to estimate how small mammal consumption varied among years and species. we used a cross-cor- relation analysis on the proportion of arctic grayling and rainbow trout that fed on small mammals as a function of lag, or time offset, between the time series to determine whether predation on mammals by these two species was correlated across time. in addition, we tested for length-dependent patterns of predation on mammals using logistic regression (glm with a lo- git link function; eqs 1 and 2). fish sampled in 2011, a year of relatively high shrew incidence, were classi- fied as either a shrew-eater (1) or not (0) to predict the probability of shrew consumption as a function of fish fork length. we estimated the 50% probability (lp50) of a fish having a shrew its stomach as the response s (l) and fork length (l) as the predictor. lp50 was cal- culated by dividing the intercept by the slope of the logistic regression (eq. 3). all analyses were con- ducted in r (r development core team 2011). logistic function: sðlþ ¼ ½expðb0 þ b1lþ=½1 þ expðb0 þ b1lþ (1) logit transform: logitðsðlþþ ¼ b0 þ b1  l lp50 ¼  b0=b1 (2) (3) results over the 13 years of the study, we examined 1568 arctic grayling and 2424 rainbow trout stomach con- tents. we documented 75 shrews and one red-backed vole among all fish examined. mice and lemmings were absent from the stomach contents examined. of the shrews, we were able to identify two species (30%, n = 23), 21 (91%) were s. cinereus, with an average live mass of 4.03  0.5 g, and two (9%) were s. monticolus but too extensively digested to accurately measure their mass (moore & kenagy 2004). up to eight individual shrews, at various stages of digestion, were found in the largest arctic grayling from the wind r. (fig. 1). up to seven shrews were found in a single rainbow trout, of which six were consumed whole and nearly perfectly preserved suggesting recent consumption. shrews were found in the diet contents from our first survey on july 1st through our last survey on september 12th. in one case, an individually tagged arctic gray- table 1. annual summary of arctic grayling and rainbow trout captured for stomach content analyses. episodic predation by fishes on shrews year 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 total streams pick lynx ltr elva hidden lynx ltr elva pick hidden lynx ltr pick hidden lynx ltr hidden lynx hidden lynx hidden lynx hidden lynx hidden lynx ltr hidden lynx hidden lynx ltr kema hidden lynx ltr kema elva ltc wind r. hidden lynx ltr stovall ltc pick no. of grayling fl > 298 mm no. of grayling with shrews (no. of shrews) no. of rainbow trout fl > 290 mm no. of rainbow trout with shrews (no. of shrews) 9 2 9 4 7 35 10 9 5 11 4 6 1 20 12 1 16 2 1 2 13 14 6 4 3 1 33 13 14 3 16 9 2 14 12 18 3 3 5 5 357 1 (3) 1 (2) 3 (5) 1 (1) 1 (2) 1 (1) 4 (5) 2 (4) 1 (2) 4 (12) 3 (15) 2 10 1 8 4 8 8 1 24 3 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 6 11 34 8 51 1 8 46 9 4 4 10 8 8 2 4 2 1 (1) 1 (1) 1 (1) 2 (2) 1 (3) 1 vole 3 (4) 3 (3) 2 (8) 22 (52) 299 14 (23) ling was sampled on two consecutive days with a shrew in its stomach, even though the stomach con- tents were removed on the first day. in eight of the 13 years of the study, shrews were absent in the stomach contents of fish we examined across all streams surveyed (table 1). yet, we found shrews every 2–3 years in one or more streams (fig. 2). the smallest arctic grayling and rainbow trout documented with a shrew in their guts were 298 and 290 mm, respectively. among the 3992 fish stomachs examined over the study period, only 299 rainbow trout and 357 arctic grayling were consid- ered large enough to consume small mammals (table 1). on average, 24% (range 11–38%) of these larger fish consumed shrews in 2003, 2006 and 2011 (fig. 2). cross-correlation analysis suggested that grayling and rainbow trout fed on shrews in phase with one another across the 13 years (lag 0, r = 0.82, p = 0.0015). incidence of shrews in fish was particularly high among multiple streams in 2011 and 2003 and, to a lesser extent, in 2001, 2006 and 2008 (fig. 2; table 1). we found evidence of shrews in the diet of arctic grayling and rainbow trout throughout the northern 625 lisi et al. predation by both arctic grayling and rainbow trout on shrews (fig. 4). we found that arctic grayling with a fork length above 374 mm and rainbow trout above 501 mm had a 50% probability of consuming a shrew in 2011 (logit summary statics grayling: b0 =  21.21, b1 = 0.057, p < 0.001, d.f. = 277; rainbow trout: b0 =  7.95, b1 = 0.016, d.f. = 338, p < 0.001). discussion our results suggest that small mammals, the majority of which were shrews, are an episodically important riparian resource for predatory fishes in boreal streams, occurring as often as every 2–3 years over the last 13 years. furthermore, our observations show that shrew consumption was correlated between two species of stream fish and among several streams across the river basin. further, our data suggest a size threshold for shrew consumption, where gape-limited or less dominant individuals were unable to exploit the resource pulse in years when shrews were widely available. we propose four mechanisms to explain why abundance of shrews in stomach contents of fish was highly variable over the 13 years of the study: (i) the abundance of shrews varied substantially among years, (ii) the abundance of large fish varied among years, (iii) variation in riparian flooding resulting in episodic transport of terrestrial prey to streams or (iv) prey switching from salmon eggs (a potentially pre- ferred prey) to shrews during low salmon years. of these possible mechanisms, we speculate that shrew population abundance dominated by s. cinereus was highly variable in riparian environments as the most plausible explanation for the temporal patterns in pre- dation on shrews. shrews of the genus sorex are known to have regular interannual population oscilla- tions (churchfield 1990; norrdahl 1995; merritt et al. 2003; korpim€aki et al. 2005). population dynamics for are not well understood, but are thought to be controlled by a combination of bottom-up processes (food availabil- ity, water table height, winter temperatures, snow depth), top down controls (predation, parasitism) or density-dependent processes (norrdahl & korpim€aki 1995; merritt et al. 2003; korpim€aki et al. 2005). density-dependent processes (territoriality, disease) could alter shrew behaviour such that they enter streams to feed in productive stream environments where predators might kill them. long-term monitor- ing is needed to accurately describe shrew population abundance fish stomach contents to help to clarify whether predation rates by fishes on shrews were associated with shrew population dynamics. independent of observations of shrews in western alaska large (a) arctic grayling fig. 2. the annual proportion of (>298 mm) and (b) rainbow trout (>290 mm) with at least one shrew in their stomachs from 2000 to 2012. numbers above bars indicate sample size per year. half of the wood river system in 2011, a year when shrews were common in stomach contents across most populations sampled (fig. 3). we found 41 shrews in 15 of 63 large arctic grayling (>298 mm) and an additional 15 shrews in seven of 28 large rain- bow trout (>290 mm). resampling the majority of these streams the following year produced no shrews in gut contents (table 1). rainbow trout were only found in a subset of the streams we surveyed over the river basin in ltr, hidden, stovall and lynx (fig. 3). shrews were absent in fish from southern streams in teal, stovall and fenno, but the majority of these fishes were small and likely morphologically unable to consume shrews (fig. 4). diet samples collected in 2011 revealed a distinct shrew consumption by size-based threshold for stream-dwelling fishes. larger individuals within each stream population of arctic grayling (fig. 4a) and rainbow trout (fig. 4b) had a higher incidence of shrews in their diet contents. although we suggest a minimum size threshold for shrew consumption across all examined fish, within a stream population, larger individuals (particularly arctic grayling) not only had a higher incidence of shrews in their diet, but often appeared to monopolise this resource. for example, all grayling captured in the wind r. were larger than the minimum size threshold of 298 mm, but only individuals >370 mm fl contained shrews in their stomachs. often, the largest individual con- tained more mammals than the next largest individu- als in the stream (fig. 4a). logistic regression also supported that body size had a significant effect on 626 episodic predation by fishes on shrews fig. 3. map of streams where the stomach contents of arctic grayling and rainbow trout were examined during the summer of 2011 in the wood river basin. bubble size corresponds to the average number of shrews consumed per large arctic grayling (>298 mm, dark bubbles) and rainbow trout (>290 mm, white bubbles). ‘x’ corresponds to streams where no small mammals were found in the diet of fish. alternatively, peaks in shrew consumption could be correlated with individual changes in foraging related to density-dependent properties of a changing predator population. schindler et al. (1997) found that a higher proportion of largemouth bass in a small lake consumed terrestrial vertebrates (frogs, snakes, voles, shrews, mice and birds) when bass populations were low, suggesting a relatively constant influx of large terrestrial prey was distributed more broadly across the bass population when bass abundance was high. while we do not have abundance estimates for fish across all streams and years, biweekly summer snorkel surveys conducted in 2010–2012 revealed similar densities of rainbow trout and arctic grayling both within and between years in lynx and hidden (bentley et al. 2012). despite similar densities and sampling effort over these 3 years, we only detected shrew consumption in 2011. variation in summer rainfall may explain why shrews were found in fish stomachs throughout the watershed in some years. flooding often controls the magnitude and timing of material exchange between aquatic and terrestrial environments, including terres- trial prey for predatory fishes (junk et al. 1989). high water periods are also expressed somewhat synchro- nously across streams in the wood river basin (armstrong & schindler 2013). annelids are found episodically in fish stomach contents from our study streams and may be a useful indicator of flood- controlled delivery of terrestrial prey to streams. indeed, summer rainfall (june 13–sept 8; 2003–2012; armstrong & schindler 2013) was correlated with the proportion of terrestrial annelids consumed by fish across the watershed (pearson’s r = 0.67, p = 0.03; rainbow trout only r = 0.78, p = 0.01). however, there was no significant positive correlation between 627 lisi et al. fig. 4. cumulative distributions of individual fork length (fl) of (a) arctic grayling and (b) rainbow trout for each stream surveyed

rainfall and shrew consumption by fishes (pearson’s r =  0.20, p = 0.57). summers when shrews were found in fish (2003, 2006, 2011) received less rain and streams remained closer to base flow conditions for the majority of the summer. while heavy rain may be responsible for episodic delivery of some terrestrial prey to stream fishes (e.g., annelid worms), heavy rain and flooding do not appear to be the dominant mechanism responsible for delivering shrews to predatory fishes in this system. resident fish may switch to shrew resources when salmon returns are low. salmon eggs are commonly consumed by resident fishes in coastal streams during salmon spawning events (bentley et al. last, larger 2012) and are 2–3x as energy dense compared with benthic and terrestrial invertebrate prey (cummings & wuycheck 1971; armstrong 2010). shrews in compar- ison are much larger than individual sockeye salmon eggs (~4 g vs. ~0.1 g) with similar energetic density by mass (shrews: 7.3 kjg  1  0.13, newman 1977; vs. eggs 9.0 kjg  1, armstrong 2010). we estimate that a typical 4 g shrew has the energetic equivalent of approximately 33 salmon eggs. however, shrews likely have a higher fraction of indigestible material (he & wurtsbaugh 1993) and lower levels of essential fatty acids, which have been positively linked to per- formance in fish (fuiman & ojanguren 2011). deliv- ery of salmon-derived prey also shows considerable 628 year-to-year variation as a result of natural population dynamics and age structure in salmon populations (rogers & schindler 2008). resident fish are likely digestively constrained in high salmon years, because growth saturates with salmon density (bentley et al. 2012), so consuming shrews would be suboptimal dur- ing high salmon years. we observed that all three of the high shrew years (2003, 2006, and 2011) occurred during relatively low salmon years on several of the streams studied. however, three other relatively low salmon years (2002, 2010 and 2012) did not coincide with high shrew consumption (bentley et al. 2012). furthermore, shrews were present in fish stomachs for several weeks before, during and after salmon com- menced spawning. therefore, it is unlikely that resi- dent fishes consume shrews only in years when salmon eggs are less available. we presume that a large proportion of arctic grayling and rainbow trout with shrews in their stomachs indicate an abundant and variable riparian shrew population rather than a fluctuating resident fish population or variable salmon population. we also observed variation among larger individu- als which seem to be better at feeding on shrews, such as the two grayling and one rainbow trout that accumulated 8–6 shrews in their stomach (fig. 1). these data suggest that larger fish may have the first opportunity to capture shrews susceptible to preda- tion. we speculate that these ‘shrew specialists’ may have disproportionately larger rations not only because of their ability to capture and ingest large prey, but also because of their ability to exclude smaller individuals from access to mammal prey. summary the behaviour of the occasional pulse of mammal prey to stream fishes may be important to the overall fitness of these long-lived consumers in freshwater streams. morpho- logical capabilities of predators and the habitat they occupy likely mediate access to terrestrial food in aquatic environments. novel mechanisms might also affect the rate at which shrews or other small mam- mals enter the water. for instance, nematomorph par- asites alter their cricket host, increasing the probability that they enter streams so the parasite can reproduce, at the same time creating a food source for stream-dwelling trout (salvelinus leu- comaenis japonicas, sato et al. 2011). alternatively, fish can create their own opportunities by developing strategies to capture novel food resources at the habi- tat fringe, such as the large-bodied european catfish (silurus glanis) that breach land to ambush pigeons on shallow gravel bars (cucherousset et al. 2012). fish often use a generalist strategy that maintains the ability to capitalise on many types of prey for surviv- episodic predation by fishes on shrews ing in heterogeneous environments where prey supply is unpredictable (schindler et al. 1997). although arctic grayling and rainbow trout are not considered particularly large-gaped animals, we show that at a certain size, these animals are capable of feeding on occasional pulses of vertebrate prey such as shrews. the mechanisms that make shrews available to stream fishes remain unknown; we suspect they forage on stream benthic invertebrates, thereby placing them- selves at risk to aquatic predators. often, ecologists imagine consumers as homogenous groups, with a singular response to pulses of food. our data suggest that higher-order effects of resource pulses (e.g., com- munity level effects) ultimately hinge on the ability of individual predators to capitalise on pulsed prey, with responses that may be highly variable within popula- tions or between species of consumers. acknowledgements this work is a
