(2002) commented that prior to the arrival of these molluscs in the la plata basin, the incidence of malacofauna was low in the diet of ﬁshes. in the itaipu reservoir, a low variation in water level in 1992 may have been the factor responsible for the establishment and outbreak of c. ﬂuminea (okada 2001), which became the most important food to p. granulosus in the years 1994–1996 (gaspar da luz et al. 2002). in addition to this paper, other works report an intense predation of these bivalve invaders by p. granulosus (darrigran & colautti 1994; mont- alto et al. 1999; ferriz et al. 2000; cataldo et al. 2002), which, besides being omnivorous, is opportunistic. the objective of this study is to quantify the diet of p. granulosus after the establishment of c. ﬂuminea and l. fortunei in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain, in three rivers (parana´, baı´a, and ivinheima) with different abundances of invasive bivalves. the for- aging behaviour of this predator and its role as a potential dispersing or controlling agent for these molluscs are discussed based on the diet composition and through the assessment of degree of digestion of the molluscs. materials and methods study area the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain is located between two reservoirs, immediately downstream from the porto primavera dam and about 200 km upstream from the beginning of the itaipu reservoir. this area is the last stretch of the parana´ river inside the brazilian territory with running waters. the main active channel in this system is the parana´ river; the baı´a river, the corutuba channel, the ivinheima river, and innumer- able lagoons complete the regional drainage network (souza-filho & stevaux 2004). and ivinheima river samples were obtained from the parana´ river (22°43’s and 53°11’w), baı´a river (22°43’s and 53°18’w), (22°49’s and 53°33’w) (fig. 1). the baı´a river has a semilotic channel and forms a number of lagoons along its course. in turn, the ivinheima river has a typically lotic channel with turbulent waters and is one of the main contributors on the right bank of the parana´ river. both subsystems are located in the state of mato grosso do sul (fig. 1). 48 fig. 1. upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain (pr ⁄ ms), showing the parana´, baı´a, and ivinheima rivers. fish sampling specimens were obtained quarterly from june 2004 to june 2005, with gillnets mesh sizes (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 mm between nonad- jacent knots) and longlines with 40 hooks. nets and longlines were set during 24 h and checked at 8:00, 16:00, and 22:00 h. fish were measured and weighed and stomachs and intestines removed and ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde for content analysis. diet characterisation the ﬁsh that consumed molluscs were divided into seven size classes, based on the range of their standard length (17æ9–64æ5 cm): 1 (<30 cm; n = 7), 2 (30– 35 cm; n = 19), 3 (35–40 cm; n = 10), 4 (40–45 cm; n = 6), 5 (45–50 cm; n = 7), 6 (50–55 cm; n = 2), and 7 (>55 cm; n = 6). a maximum number of 200 shells of each species of mollusc preyed were measured for each specimen, to obtain the mean length of the ingested prey per size class of the predator. digestive tract was divided into: stomach (sto), anterior (ain), medium (min), and posterior intestine (pin). the degree of digestion of the molluscs in different portions of the predator’s digestive tract was also evaluated, through the following scale: (1) empty shells weight; (2) full shells weight. estimation of diet was based on the analysis of stomach contents through the frequency of occurrence (%) and total weight (%) (hyslop 1980) of each food item. these data were used to calculate a feeding index (iai), described by the equation: iai ¼ foi  wi ðfoi  wiþ p n n¼1  100 where iai is the feeding index; i = 1, 2,…, n food item; foi is the frequency of occurrence (%), and wi is the relative weight of item i (% of total). statistical analyses to summarise the diet composition of all individuals, we used a multivariate technique. we choose corres- pondence analysis (ca; gauch jr. 1986) because it is more appropriate when the data matrix contains numerous zeros (olden et al. 2001). data entered were the weight of every item registered in a given stomach (totalling eight items in 84 individuals), controlling for the river where the individual was collected. the ﬁrst two axes were retained for interpretation because they explained most of the data variability. the scores of the retained axes were generated and used in further analyses to verify possible signiﬁcant spatial variations in diet composi- tion. to determine the items that most inﬂuenced the ordination, we analysed the correlations (pearson) between the scores of a given axis and the original data matrix. invasive molluscs in the diet of pterodoras granulosus results digestive tracts of 84 specimens of p. granulosus were analysed, and the occurrence of the invasive molluscs c. ﬂuminea and ⁄ or l. fortunei was veriﬁed in 57 of them (67.8%). in the baı´a river, c. ﬂuminea repre- sented more than 95% of the diet. in the parana´ river there was a predominance of l. (46%), followed by plants (33.14%). in the ivinheima river, plants totalled almost 91% of the diet (table 1). fortunei the two ﬁrst axes of the ca were retained for interpretation (eigen values of 0.86 and 0.77, respect- ively) because they explained the greatest data vari- ability. the location of the points along axes 1 and 2 (fig. 2) show that the composition of p. granulosus diet was strongly affected by different rivers, as indicated by the values of the feeding index (table 1). the assumptions of anova were not met (homo- scedasticity; p < 0.05). then, we applied a kruskal- wallis test which conﬁrmed the existence of spatial possible differences between the scores of the rivers were determined through analysis of variance (one-way anova). the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were tested using shapiro- wilk and levene tests, respectively. when the anova was signiﬁcant, the tukey test was applied to verify which level of if assumptions of anova were not met, we used kruskal-wallis test. similarly, the dunn’s test was applied to verify which level of the factor differed (zar 1999). the factor differed. the graphical and statistical analyses were made using the software statisticatm for windows 7.1, with the exception of the ca, which was produced in the pc-ord 4.1 for windows program (mccune & mefford 1999). the statistical signiﬁcance level adopted was p < 0.05. fig. 2. correspondence analysis (ca) using the weight of every item registered in a given stomach of each individual of pterodoras granulosus by rivers sampled in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain (june ‘04 to june ‘05). table 1. feeding index values obtained for pterodoras granulosus in three rivers at the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain (june ‘04 to june ‘05). baı´a river (n = 12) parana´ river (n = 38) ivinheima river (n = 34) sites ⁄ items limnoperna corbicula other molluscs insects fishes plants fruits ⁄ seeds detritus ⁄ sediment fo 16.67 100 16.67 41.67 8.33 41.67 wi 0.02 89.50 0.48 8.18 0.56 1.25 iai <0.01 95.66 0.09 3.64 0.05 0.56 fo 71.05 60.53 10.53 2.63 2.63 21.05 42.10 60.53 wi 24.45 3.34 1.54 <0.01 0.40 59.45 4.71 6.10 iai 46.00 5.36 0.43 <0.01 0.03 33.14 5.25 9.78 fo 23.53 35.29 17.65 2.94 91.18 35.29 38.23 wi 5.38 4.81 1.30 0.04 77.42 9.26 1.79 n, number of specimens analysed;

to c. ﬂuminea shells this variation was however, greater. the evaluation of the degree of digestion of molluscs in different portions of the intestine showed an increase in weight of l. fortunei empty shells from the anterior section of the predator’s intestine (fig. 4). for this mollusc species, the weight of full shells was only higher than the weight of empty shells in the stomach. however, for c. ﬂuminea the weight of full shells was higher than the weight of empty shells in all fig. 3. relation between standard lengths of pterodoras granulo- sus and the mean lengths of its preys limnoperna fortunei and corbicula ﬂuminea in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain (june ‘04 to june ‘05). size classes of the predator: 1 = <30 cm, 2 = 30– 35 cm, 3 = 35–40 cm, 4 = 40–45 cm, 5 = 45–50 cm, 6 = 50– 55 cm, and 7 = >55 cm. vertical bars represent the standard deviation. 50 fig. 4. degree of digestion of molluscs limnoperna fortunei and corbicula ﬂuminea along the digestive tract of pterodoras granulosus collected in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain (june ‘04 to june ‘05). sto, stomach;

(2004) simultaneously with the intense proliferation of c. ﬂuminea in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain, since 1990s there has been a marked decrease in the density of the native species. according to mansur et al. (2003, 2004), l. fortunei usually becomes attached to the posterior region of the native bivalves (e.g., leila blainvilliana lea 1834) and [e.g., pomacea canaliculata (lamark gastropods 1822)], not allowing the full closing of their valves. darrigran et al. (1998) believed that, with the estab- lishment of l. fortunei, autochthonous gastropods tend to decrease in density and be replaced by other molluscs. the mean length of c. ﬂuminea and l. fortunei shells consumed was slightly bigger as predator size increased. a similar result was reported by darrigran & colautti (1994) in a study on p. granulosus feeding in the la plata river, although the authors believe that this species does not undergo this type of selection. in the present study, a decrease in the mean length of both mollusc species in ﬁsh specimens with length higher than 50 cm could be a consequence of the opportunistic habit of the species. pterodoras gra- nulosus seems to maximise its energy gains by obtaining savings in the search for food. it seems to be a consensus that larger predators have higher energy requirements, and for this reason they search for larger prey items, which are energetically more advantageous (elliott & hurley 2000). according to the optimal foraging theory, the predator makes a preliminary judgement between (1) energy and the time required to travel to a large prey, and (2) the gain from capturing a nearby small-sized prey (gerking 1994). when both mollusc species are compared, it can be observed that l. fortunei provided a smaller weight contribution in the p. granulosus diet, because of the smaller size of its shells; conversely, this species showed higher frequency of occurrence values. sim- ilar results were obtained by ferriz et al. (2000). because the l. fortunei shell is fragile, p. granulosus can digest its tissues more rapidly; a marked increase in empty shells occurs from the anterior section of the intestine. the small amount of full shells at the end of the digestive tract indicates that the golden mussel is an important source of food for the ﬁsh species under invasive molluscs in the diet of pterodoras granulosus study. corbicula ﬂuminea, in turn, has a more resistant shell. the proportions of open and closed shells along the digestive tract apparently demonstrate a difﬁculty of p. granulosus in having access to the tissues of this mollusc. some ﬁsh species can control that it must be highlighted, however, the dispersal and consequently the dominance of invasive molluscs by foraging. cataldo et al. (2002) concluded, based on macrocosm experiments, that predation by some ﬁsh species has been quite effective in maintaining control over the golden mussel. thus, it can be presumed that p. granulosus behaves as a potential biological control agent. the increase of these molluscs in the environment, partic- ularly of l. fortunei, is high and they can still maintain high population levels. other studies emphasise the biological control of p. granulosus on invasive molluscs (darrigran & colautti 1994; ferriz et al. 2000; gaspar da luz et al. 2002). lo´ pez armengol & casciotta (1998) studied the feeding of the sciaenid micropogonias furnieri (desmarest 1823) and conclu- ded that golden mussel extermination in the la plata river estuary by predation seems unlikely. nonethe- less, predation by ﬁsh can act as a mitigating alternative against the impact caused by invasive molluscs. as a long-range migratory ﬁsh (souza-stevaux et al. 1994; agostinho et al. 2003; sabaj & ferraris jr. 2003), widely distributed in the parana´ river, and having an omnivorous feeding habit (hahn et al. the behaviour of p. granulosus favours its 1992), action as a dispersing agent (gottsberger 1978). the number of intact and viable seeds at the ending section of its feeding tract suggests that this species can be important for the upstream dispersal of plant species (souza-stevaux et al. 1994) such as cecropia pach- ystachya tre´cul (pilatti et al. 1999), contributing to enlarge the area of colonisation or occupation by plant species. differently from other ﬁsh species that feed on invasive molluscs, such as micropogonias furnieri and leporinus obtusidens (lo´ pez armengol & casciotta 1998; penchaszadeh et al. 2000), p. granulosus can tissues of both c. ﬂuminea and utilise the soft l. fortunei without damaging the shells. in addition, a considerable amount of c. ﬂuminea shells were still closed and intact at the ﬁnal section of its digestive tract. this fact represents an indication that the ﬁsh studied may be contributing towards the dispersal of this invader in the upper parana´ river ﬂoodplain. considering that the proliferation of these molluscs causes highly negative as previously discussed, it becomes an urgent matter to investigate forms of dispersal that, together with artiﬁcial forms, have contributed to expand the area of occupation by these species.
