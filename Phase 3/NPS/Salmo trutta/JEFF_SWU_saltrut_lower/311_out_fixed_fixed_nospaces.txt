laine et al. 2002; larinier 2002). in spite of the long history of ﬁshways, most of them still target adults of commercially important species such as atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.), which are strong swimmers with good leaping abilities (larinier 1998), and act as barriers to the majority of ﬁsh species present in the river (lucas et al. 1999a). during the last decade effort has been directed towards constructing ﬁshways that are pass- able for all kinds of aquatic organisms and life stages (lucas & baras 2001). one such type of multi-purpose ﬁshway is the nature-like bypass channel that is built to resemble a natural side channel with suitable substrate, water movements, channel morphology and gradient for most ﬁsh species (jungwirth 1996; eberstaller et al. 1998). many such nature-like ﬁsh- ways exist today, but the few tests of their use by ﬁsh have been performed on strong swimming species or life stages, such as adult salmonids (aarestrup et al. 2003; calles & greenberg 2005a). studies that have examined other species have often only recorded ﬁsh as they exit the ﬁshway at the upstream end (santos et al. 2005) and few have actually measured passage efﬁciency (lucas et al. 1999a). in the river ema˚n, southern sweden, two new nature-like ﬁshways were opened at finsjo¨ in decem- ber 2000. their use by anadromous salmonids was reported in calles & greenberg (2005a) and calles (2005b). the present study describes the use and passage of these two ﬁshways by 15 species of ﬁsh, belonging to the families anguillidae (1 sp.), cottidae (1 sp.), cyprinidae (7 spp.), esocidae (1 sp.), lotidae (1 sp.), percidae (2 spp.) and salmonidae (2 spp.). material and methods study area the study was conducted from september 2001 to june 2005 in the river ema˚n (57°07¢59¢¢n;

nevertheless, at least one antenna per channel was operational throughout the study. the detection range of each antenna was tested at least every fourth day, by holding a tag mounted to a stick at different distances from the antenna. the longitudinal detection range of the antennae varied from 0.3 to 1.0 m, which gave a total reading distance of 0.6–2.0 m as the antennae generate magnetic ﬁelds in both upstream and downstream directions. this was considered sufﬁcient to detect all tagged ﬁsh. all statistical analyses were performed using sas software (sas 9.1, sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa). parametric tests were used when data met the assumptions for these tests, otherwise nonparametric tests were used. results long-distance migrants in the ﬁshway at karlshammar, 48 individuals from six different species were caught and tagged (table 1). two chub (leuciscus cephalus l.) and one baltic vimba (vimba vimba l.) were recorded success- fully ascending the ﬁshway at lower finsjo¨ 20 km upstream, but none of them ascended the upper ﬁshway. the baltic vimba was tagged in fall and )1) and spent reached finsjo¨ in 24 days (1.2 kmæday table 1. number, weight and length of ﬁsh caught, tagged and released at karlshammar power plant, 2001–2004 in the river ema˚n. family species caught (n) mean range mean range tagged (n) enter pass ok length (mm) weight (g) fishway function (n) cyprinidae percidae petromyzontidae salmonidae siluridae 5 families§ baltic vimba (vimba vimba) chub (leuciscus cephalus) ide (leuciscus idus) roach (rutilus rutilus) rudd (scardinius erythrophthalmus) perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) river lamprey (lampetra ﬂuviatilis) rainbow trout (oncorhnchus mykiss) european catﬁsh (silurus glanis) 9 species§ 32 12  2 2 1 3 2à 5 9 64 341 404 330 280 320 280 350 543 767 300–400 280–435 300–360 260–300 – 270–290 – 530–540 510–880 461 850 440 270 600 260 – 1800 3300 288–740 280–1080 300–580 220–320 – 240–280 – 1500–2100 1240–4900 32 8 2 2 1 3 – – – 48§ 1 2 0 0 0 0 – – – the ﬁshway usage is presented as number of ﬁsh entering ﬁshways (enter) and successfully ascending a ﬁshway (pass ok).  four individuals were caught at karlshammar, tagged and transported to finsjo¨ and released. àfirst registered record of river lamprey since 1890 (a. hallde´n, pers. comm.) §anadromous brown_trout (n ¼ 734) and atlantic salmon (n ¼ 58) are excluded, see calles & greenberg (2005a,b) for details. 1 (100%) 2 (100%) – – – – – – – 3 185 calles & greenberg the winter in the lower ﬁshway before continuing upstream in spring. one of the chubs was tagged in fall and the other in spring, and both of them reached finsjo¨ in spring after 238 and 13 days, respectively )1). the three individuals recorded (0.1 and 1.6 kmæday at lower finsjo¨ corresponded to 3% of the baltic vimba and 25% of the chub tagged at karlshammar. local migrants at finsjo¨, a total of 187 individuals, comprising 12 species, were pit tagged and released in 2002–2005 (table 2). nineteen were released below the lower ﬁshway and 14 of them entered the ﬁshway at some time (74%). the remaining 168 individuals were released below the upper ﬁshway and 34 of them entered the upper ﬁshway (20%) and four swam downstream and descended the lower ﬁshway (2%). most ﬁsh were recorded by the antennae during day (about 70%), but there were differences between species, with four species being mostly recorded during daytime and two being predominantly noctur- nal (fig. 3). when looking at the species that most frequently entered the ﬁshways (‡5 individuals), the proportion of tagged ﬁsh that entered the ﬁshways was 83% for burbot (lota lota l.), 50% for tench (tinca tinca l.), 38% for chub, 32% for perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) and 23% for roach (rutilus rutilus l.) (table 2). for both ﬁshways, 74% of the individuals that ascended the ﬁshway did so successfully, i.e., 74% passage efﬁ- ciency. the individuals that did not successfully ascend the entire ﬁshway either stopped inside the ﬁshway (21% at lower and 17% at upper) or turned back downstream and left the ﬁshway (5% at lower and 9% at upper). when combining all species, we found that the individuals that successfully ascended the ﬁshways (median length 271 mm) were larger than fig. 3. the proportion of pit-recordings during day (white bars) and at night (grey bars) in two nature-like ﬁshways in

individuals that stopped inside the ﬁshways were typically burbot and juvenile brown_trout, two individuals of each species remained inside the ﬁshways for months. species frequently ascending the ﬁshways six burbot were tagged and all but the smallest individual ascended the ﬁshway shortly after release (2.6–11.5 days). three of less ascended the ﬁshway directly, whereas the other two

caught when electroﬁshing (table 3). half of the tench that were marked, entered one of the ﬁshways and all of them successfully ascended the ﬁshways (100% passage efﬁciency, table 2). tench was the only species in which the individuals that ascended the ﬁshway were smaller than those that did not enter the ﬁshway (median 350 mm vs. 440 mm, mann–whitney test, u13 ¼ 47, p ¼ 0.004). no tench were caught when electroﬁshing in the ﬁshways or in the ﬁshway traps, indicating that the ﬁshways do not function as rearing habitat for this species. chub, more than any other species, were recorded in the ﬁshways (table 2). the majority of chub were successful at ascending the ﬁshways (86%, table 2). a total of two individuals (14%) turned back down- stream (140 mm and 155 mm), and these individuals were smaller than those that successfully ascended the ﬁshways (median length ¼ 332 mm) (mann–whitney test, u11 ¼ 20, p ¼ 0.03). several juvenile chub (30– 50 mm) were caught when electroﬁshing the lower ﬁshway, showing that chub used the ﬁshway as rearing habitat (table 3). eight of the 25 tagged perch ascended the ﬁshways, one at the lower ﬁshway and seven at the upper ﬁshway. all of them successfully completed the passage (100%), six of them on their ﬁrst attempt and two on their second attempt. the individuals that ascended the ﬁshway (median length ¼ 185 mm) were larger than those that did not (median ¼ 177 mm), but the difference was not signiﬁcant (mann–whitney test, u23 ¼ 69, p ¼ 0.58). several untagged perch were caught in traps as they were both ascending and descending the ﬁshways. no perch were caught when electroﬁshing the ﬁshways, indicating that the ﬁshways do not function as rearing habitat. of the 44 tagged roach, 10 individuals ascended the upper ﬁshway. fifty per cent of the roach successfully ascended the upper ﬁshway (table 2). the individuals that failed spent from a few seconds up to 2 h in the ﬁshway (upstream of the ﬁrst antenna) before turning back downstream. the individuals that turned back downstream in the upper ﬁshway were smaller than the ones that completed their ascent (median 153 mm (32 g) vs. 212 mm (90 g), mann–whitney test, u9 ¼ 24, p ¼ 0.04). roach were caught in the ﬁsh- ways, both in traps and when electroﬁshing (table 3). in total, 97 individuals of varying sizes and belonging to eight species were caught in the ﬁshways (table 3). when combining the data from pit pas- sages, electroﬁshing catches and trap catches inside the ﬁshways, 240 individuals belonging to 15 species and seven families used the ﬁshways in finsjo¨. discussion the great potential of the fact that 240 individuals belonging to 15 species and seven families used the ﬁshways in finsjo illustrates these ﬁshways. moreover, the broad size range of ﬁshes observed using the ﬁshways indicates that they work for many different the passage efﬁciencies were high and consistent for both ﬁshways (74%). life stages. for all species combined, 187 calles & greenberg the passage efﬁciency of the finsjo¨ ﬁshways was high when compared with passage efﬁciency of a similar ﬁsh assemblage ascending a denil pass (17– 22%) (lucas et al. 1999a,b). despite the overall high passage efﬁciency of the ﬁshways at finsjo¨, there was considerable variation between species, ranging from 50% passage efﬁciency for roach to 100% for tench and perch. still, the passage efﬁciencies for both perch and roach in the present study are higher than the 8% and 29% reported for perch and roach, respect- ively, in a study of a pool and weir ﬁshway (knaepkens et al. 2005). surprisingly, species like tench and perch that are typically found in lentic habitats had a higher success rate than lotic species such as chub, burbot and roach. these results contrast with reports from other ﬁshways in which chub and roach have been observed successfully ascending at a higher efﬁciency than perch (lucas et al. 1999a; knaepkens et al. 2005). furthermore, tench are rarely observed using ﬁshways (prignon et al. 1998; jansen et al. 1999), and they would not have been expected to have a high efﬁciency, given their low critical swimming speed (wolter & arlinghaus 2003). both burbot and pike (esox lucius l.) have been observed to ascend nature-like ﬁshways, denil- and vertical slot ﬁshways (schwalme et al. 1985; degerman 2001), but their low usage in the present study may be an effect of the low number of tagged ﬁsh. as a general rule, nature-like ﬁshways are often passable for more species than technical ﬁshways (eberstaller et al. 1998), but there are examples of technical ﬁshways such as denil ﬁsh passes that are passable for numerous species, including chub, bream (abramis brama l.), bleak (alburnus alburnus l.) and euro- pean eel (anguilla anguilla l.) (baras et al. 1994). there are numerous potential explanations for the low passage efﬁciency for some species. sample sizes for a number of species were quite low, making conclusions about these species tenuous. motivation to migrate might have also been low for many of the species as many of our observations were performed outside of their spawning season (baras et al. 1994; mader et al. 1998; prignon et al. 1998). size, which is often directly related to swimming ability, may explain some interspeciﬁc differences in passage efﬁciency in our study and even intraspeciﬁc differences between studies. for example, chub had a higher passage efﬁciency than roach, and this difference might reﬂect the fact that the chub (275 mm), were substantially larger and presumably better swimmers than the roach (168 mm). the optimal body size for successful ﬁshway passage differs between species, with slender individuals presumably beneﬁting most from an increased body size, which should increase their swimming performance, whereas deep-bodied ﬁshes might beneﬁt more from a smaller body size that will 188 minimise drag, enabling them to use low-velocity boundary layers near the bottom (eberstaller et al. 1998; calles & greenberg 2005a). one possible low proportion of ﬁsh explanation for the overall eventually ascending one of the ﬁshways (28%) maybe that the pit-tagged individuals were negatively affected by the tagging procedure. recent evaluations on the effects of pit tagging on cyprinids, however, found no effects on body condition and no tag loss as long as the incision remained unsutured (skov et al. 2005). evaluations on the effects of pit implants on the noncyprinid species in our study have, to our best knowledge, not yet been performed. )1æm previous studies that have reported low ﬁshway efﬁciencies, have attributed the low efﬁciencies to the ﬁshways’ limited dimensions, low discharges and high water velocities (mader et al. 1998; aarestrup et al. 2003; knaepkens et al. 2005). as the discharge–width ratio of the ﬁshways at finsjo¨ were close to double the )1, one might proposed maximum of 0.1–0.2 m3æs have predicted low passage efﬁciencies for the ﬁshways (gebler 1998). conditions similar to the ﬁshways in finsjo¨ have been reported from a portuguese nature-like ﬁshway, and this ﬁshway functioned well for many different species and sizes (santos et al. 2005). one might have also expected the passage efﬁciency to be lower for the lower ﬁshway than for the upper ﬁshway as the lower ﬁshway is both longer (150 m vs. 370 m) and steeper (1.8% vs. 2.5%), factors that normally reduce passage efﬁciency (slatick & basham 1985; clay 1995; calles & greenberg 2005a). upstream migration in unregulated rivers is pre- dominantly nocturnal for many species, which has been proposed as a way of reducing predation risk (banks 1969; jonsson 1991). this nocturnal activity has also been observed for several species using ﬁshways (prignon et al. 1998; aarestrup et al. 2003; santos et al. 2005). however, most studies of ﬁsh- ways, including this one, have reported daytime activity (gowans et al. 1999; lucas 2000; calles & greenberg 2005a). daytime activity has been attrib- uted to the need for visual cues to be able to successfully ascend difﬁcult passages (stuart 1962; gowans et al. 1999). however, this may not always be the case, as some ﬁshways that have been primarily ascended at night have had a low passage efﬁciency (aarestrup et al. 2003). difference in activity patterns between different rivers may be related to turbidity. high turbidity should have the same camouﬂaging effect from visual predators as nocturnal behaviour in clear water systems (jacobsen et al. 2004). fishways can function as rearing and/or spawning habitat for different ﬁsh species as has been previously suggested for species like bullhead (cottus gobio l.), burbot, chub, grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.), european eel, roach, trout, salmon and signal crayﬁsh (pacifastacus leniusculus) (jungwirth 1996; eberstall- er et al. 1998; jansen et al. 1999; degerman 2001; slavik & bartos 2002; knaepkens et al. 2005). in our study, we documented relatively long-term use of the ﬁshways, presumably as rearing habitats, for several species, but it is not known whether any of the species spawn inside the ﬁshways. as illustrated by chub and baltic vimba, salmonids are not the only species that perform long-distance migrations (fredrich et al. 2003), and thus these nonsalmonid species have the potential to recolonise previously isolated river reaches. all in all, the nature- like ﬁshways in finsjo¨ were efﬁcient for most species and sizes of ﬁsh. nevertheless, small individuals of species such as roach were less successful. the next obvious step is to measure the attraction efﬁciency of the ﬁshways for these species, as this has rarely been examined. in many respects, we have considerable information about the biology of ﬁshes to be able to design fully functional ﬁshways. despite this, there are still examples of ﬁshways that were expected to work well for a particular species, but have not (aarestrup et al. 2003). this means that we cannot be certain that a ﬁshway will work beforehand, and it is still necessary to evaluate the function of each new ﬁshway after it is built. acknowledgements the research presented in this paper was carried out as a part of the swedish r&d programme ‘‘hydropower – environmental impact, remedial measures and costs in existing regulated waters‘‘, which was ﬁnanced by elforsk, the swedish energy agency, the national board of fisheries and the swedish environmental protection agency. we thank minna brodin, jan folkesson and madelen juhl for hard work in the ﬁeld, per sjo¨strand and
