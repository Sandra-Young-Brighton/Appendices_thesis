(west- estonian archipelago sea) is a relatively shallow but large bay. its ﬁsh fauna is strongly dominated by freshwater species. several species inhabit the bay all matsalu bay (fig. 1) in the va¨inameri year round, for example: roach rutilus rutilus, pike esox lucius, white bream blicca bjoerkna, perch perca ﬂuviatilis and rudd scardinius erythrophthalmus. some freshwater and anadromous species, on the (vimba bream vimba contrary, are less abundant vimba) or almost lacking in the bay (smelt osmerus eperlanus) outside the spawning period. the only abundant marine species is herring clupea harengus membras, which spawns mostly in outer parts of the bay (fig. 1); this species is almost absent in the area in summer (erm et al. 2002). the ﬁsh fauna of matsalu bay has been studied over a long period. still, earlier works have mostly studied only some details, e.g. reproduction of doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00134.x 211 vetemaa et al. ob cb ib dnalnif r. kasari 5 km nedews ainotse aivtal ainauhtil fig. 1. three parts of matsalu bay (ib, inner bay;

no. 110/2 for 17–30 mm). each net consisted of a 60-m- long stretched net bundle, which was attached to a 27-m upper and 33-m lower net-rope. only bottom nets (net height 1.8 m) were used. stations were randomly placed in all three parts of the bay, further referred to as three ‘sections’. only places with water depth of at least 1 m (ib) or 1.5 m (cb and ob) were chosen, to avoid shallow areas with dense vegetation. in each year the total number of stations was around 40, and distribution between sections was equal. fishing usually took 5 days (eight stations per )1 night). only days with wind speed less than 8 m s were used. the nets were set between 16.00 and 19.00 hours and lifted between 08.00 and 11.00 hours following day. the distance between stations was at least 100 m. cpue was calculated as the number of ﬁsh per station/night. fish length was measured as total length (tl). year-round sampling fish were sampled between august 2001 and august 2002 at least once per month during the ice-free period. these samplings were grouped between three seasons – spring: march–may (21 march, 3 april, 18 april, 4 may; water temperature 3–15 °c); summer: june–september (3 june, 28 june, 5 august, 7 august, temperature 15–21 °c) and 19 september; water autumn: october–december (17 october, 6 novem- ber, 1 december; water temperature 3–12 °c). the same methods were applied as during the routine midsummer monitoring, but the number of stations per section was 3. fishing usually took 3 days; the second day of ﬁshing is always given as the sampling date. the nets were always set at least 2 h prior to sunset and lifted at least 2 h after sunrise the following day. as the number of observations (ﬁshing effort) was not dynamics of ﬁsh in the matsalu bay equal throughout the year, the bootstrapping method (elfron 1979) and kruskal–wallis test (kruskal 1952) were employed in order to test the statistical signiﬁ- cance of the differences in the abundance of ﬁsh. during the ice-covered period the nets were set under the ice each time for ca. 2 weeks and there was only one station per section (january 7–19; january 19–31; january 31–february 10; february 10–21; always the seventh day of ﬁshing is given as the sampling date). winter data were used only in the calculation of shannon–wiener and evenness index. the shannon–wiener index of diversity was calcula- ted for sampling and section: each gill net h¢ ¼ ) pi ln (pi) (shannon 1949). evenness was calculated as e ¼ h¢/ ln (s), where s is the number of species in the sample. while calculating these indices, the total catch (sum of all stations) in the segment was used. p with the aim of obtaining a more complete list of ﬁshes inhabiting matsalu bay, ﬁsh were also sampled using a commercial fyke net (only in cb; mouth opening 1.5 m, leader net 100 m, during the whole ice-free season august 2001–august 2002) and by hand seining. seining was carried out at each monthly sampling (see the sections above) during the ice-free season from august 2001 to august 2002 (one haul 400 m2; two hauls in each section). the hand seine that was used had a wing length of 15 m and a mesh size (knot to knot) of 2.5 mm. results mid-summer ﬁsh monitoring during the coastal ﬁsh monitoring carried out in july– august 1994–2003, altogether 27,683 specimens of 22 species were caught by gill net ﬁshing in matsalu bay (table 1). the total effort was 399 station/nights. the most abundant species was roach, followed by white bream and perch (table 1). the distribution of the 10 most common species between different sections in the years 1994–2003 varied considerably (table 2). concerning four spe- cies, perch, pike, white bream and bleak alburnus alburnus, the distribution between all three sections was rather equal and there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in cpue (table 3; kruskal– wallis test, p < 0.05). in general, the ﬁsh species composition in the sections cb and ob was rather similar. only one species, vimba bream, showed signiﬁcant differences in abundance between these two sections (table 3). the ﬁsh fauna of the shallow and more closed ib was, on the contrary, rather different from the two more open sections. signiﬁcant differences were found concerning many species (table 3). 213 table 1. number of specimens caught during year-round sampling (august 2001–2002, by the sections) and summer ﬁsh monitoring (1994– 2003;

only the cpue of pike, pikeperch s. lucioperca, ﬂounder p. ﬂesus and gibel carp carassius gibelio was not signiﬁcantly impacted 214 by seasonality (kruskal–wallis test, p > 0.05). for some species the effect of seasonality on the catch was very large. for example, during the summers of 1994– 2003, only one specimen of eelpout z. viviparus and seven burbots lota lota were caught. in spring both species were common. smelt and herring were very abundant in spring, but during the summers, only 1 and 12 specimens, correspondingly, were caught. few garpikes belone belone were caught in spring and never in other seasons. rudd and white bream showed an opposite pattern: they were much more abundant in summer than during spring and autumn. pikeperch caught during the study period were all caught in summer. seasonal differences in the abundance of ﬁshes were greatest in the shallow ib, where seven species had signiﬁcantly different cpue values in different table 2. average cpue of 10 most abundant species in the different sections of matsalu bay in 1994–2003 and the mean cpue in the bay (signiﬁcant differences presented in table 3). dynamics of ﬁsh in the matsalu bay species perch pike ruffe pike-perch flounder white bream rudd roach bleak vimba bream year 1994 12.20 33.38 13.25 27.73 0.60 0.29 0.00 0.30 0.20 1.00 3.25 1.15 0 0.21 0 0.15 0 0 0 0 1.40 2.25 6.75 2.73 0.80 0 0 0.12 3.60 21.50 33.25 20.24 0 0.04 0 0.03 0 0 3.00 0.36 section ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib cb ob mean ib, inner bay;

appelberg et al. 1995; kurkilahti & rask 1996; finstad et al. 2000). however, other commonly used ﬁsh sampling techniques are not applicable in matsalu bay, or in most other similar shallow areas. trawling is not possible due to the shallowness and the stony bottom. seining (using big commercial seines suitable for catching adults of the typical species) is not suitable due to the abundant stones and very dense vegetation in some areas of the bay. therefore, gill net sampling using standardised mesh sizes (thoresson 1996) is still the most wide- spread method in studying coastal ﬁsh assemblages in the coastal northern baltic sea. nevertheless, it is not suitable for some species, especially for eel anguilla anguilla, which in the present study was found to be rather abundant in the fyke net catch, but was never caught by gill nets. 215 vetemaa et al. table 3. signiﬁcant differences in the abundance (cpue) of the most common species in summer between different sections (table 2) based on the data from 1994 to 2003. ib:cb ib:ob cb:ob perch pike ruffe pikeperch flounder tench burbot white bream rudd roach bleak vimba bream ib < cb** ib < cb* ib > cb* ib > cb** ib < cb** ib < ob** ib < ob** ib < ob** ib > ob* ib > ob* ib > ob** ib < ob** ib < ob** cb < ob** ib, inner bay;

(2002) found a signiﬁcant relationship between the total distances moved per day and temperature. positive correlation between the rate of movement and temperature has been shown for pikeperch as well (jepsen et al. 1999). even though pike belongs to the group of species preferring warmer water, the correlation between its movements and temperature is still somewhat unclear. while casselman (1978) demonstrated that swimming activity of pike in the laboratory was highly correlated with temperature, jepsen et al. (2001) and rogers & bergesen (1995) found no such relationship in the ﬁeld. temperature dependence in activity is known also for cold-water species, e.g. burbot, which is typically less active in summer (hardewig et al. 2004). in general, differences in temperature preference have been explained by physiological characteristics, e.g. feeding biochemistry. for example, roach growth ceases below a temperature threshold of 12 °c, as the intake and digestion of food is limited by the reduced activities of digestive enzymes (hardewig & 216 van dijk 2003). in conclusion, different cpue values in gill-net catches obtained during the year-round samplings cannot be directly transformed into abun- dance estimates. low abundance of burbot in summer most likely reﬂects its inactivity. however, some warm-water species that inhabited matsalu bay all year round showed signiﬁcantly higher cpue in spring, when water is still cold. such species were, e.g., roach, vimba bream, perch and pike. these observations hint at the possibility that the populations of these species in matsalu bay may consist of resident and migratory components, as has been described in some other areas (e.g. estuary of darss- zingst-bodden, winkler 1996). the hypothesis that some pike, perch, roach, vimba bream and ide leuciscus idus enter the bay (and river kasari system) only for spawning and then leave back to the open waters of the va¨inameri has been raised earlier too by erm et al. (2002), who referred to ﬁshermen’s obser- vations. however, borcherding et al. (2002) demon- strated that some cyprinids perform regular feeding migrations in summer. jepsen & berg (2002) showed that the necessity of ﬁnding food and avoiding predators explains the seasonal migrations of roach in two danish lakes. therefore, even if the spawning seems to be the main trigger of migrations in the va¨inameri area, there may be other reasons too, which need special studies in future. bays of different size and morphology may exhibit rather large variations in the dynamics of ﬁsh fauna. it has been shown that while the abundance of ﬁsh in some smaller very shallow bays in the va¨inameri area (e.g. saunja bay, 6 km2, depth 0.3–1.5 m; ka¨ina bay, 9 km2, depth 0.3–1.0 m) is very high in spring, these bays are almost empty during the winter season (saat & taal 2001; saat & kikas 2002). soon after spawning, adults return to va¨inameri and only young-of-the-year ﬁsh stay in the bays during their ﬁrst summer. in this respect matsalu bay is different. it is bigger and deeper and does not have anoxic conditions during winters. therefore it is important for ﬁsh all year round and the abundance in spring does not surpass other seasons so drastically. only a few species (smelt, herring) leave the area after spawning, while the majority of species occurring in matsalu bay can ﬁnd suitable habitats all year round. the present study demonstrated that the ﬁsh fauna of matsalu bay is strongly dominated by freshwater species such as perch, roach, white bream and rudd. there is only one seasonally abundant marine species – herring – that enters the bay for spawning in spring. two other marine species, ﬂounder and eelpout, are rare and can usually be caught only in ob. sand goby pomatoschistus minutus and common goby pomato- schistus microps were abundant in the outer parts of the bay but not found in ib. euryhaline sticklebacks table 4. cpue (±se) of 15 most abundant species in matsalu bay caught during the year-round sampling 2001–2002. signiﬁcant differences in the abundance at least between two seasons (kruskal–wallis test;

(ja¨ger et al. 1980; klinkhardt & winkler 1989). such salinity values are typical to estonian coastal areas. furthermore, it has been shown that inhabiting brackish waters have adapted to reproduce in higher salinities than populations inhabiting fresh waters (e.g. ruffe, vetemaa & saat 1996). therefore, it is possible that other factors such as temperature, possibility of ﬁnding food and shelter, etc. may play an even more important role than salinity in the distribution of species. for example, the minnow phoxinus phoxinus was abundant in hand seine catches in ob, but was never caught in less saline ib. the reason might be too high vegetation density for this species. some freshwater ﬁsh populations in conclusion, species composition and abundance of ﬁsh in matsalu bay showed high seasonal and annual variations. the most dynamic period is spring, when several species that are very rare during summer enter the bay for spawning. therefore, in spring, ﬁsh composition may drastically change in a few days, which, in the present study, also resulted in very unstable diversity and evenness indices both between different sections and between successive samplings in spring (data not presented). on the contrary, summer values of these indices were rather stable. this indicates that the common sampling period (july 25– august 15) for coastal warm-water ﬁsh assemblages in sweden, finland and estonia (thoresson 1996) is really the most suitable one for assessing the common commercial species. acknowledgements this research was ﬁnanced by the estonian science foundation (grant 5930), project life05nat/lv/000100, estonian state- ﬁnanced project 0182554s03 and baltic sea regional project (gef trust grant no. tf051286). references appelberg, m., berger, h.m., hesthagen, t., kleiven, e., kurkilahti, m., raitaniemi, 1995. development and intercalibration of methods in nordic freshwater ﬁsh monitoring. water air and soil pollution 85: 401–406. j. & rask, m. borcherding, j., bauerfeld, m., hintzen, d. & neumann, d. 2002. lateral migrations of ﬁshes between ﬂoodplain lakes and their drainage channels at the lower rhine: diel and seasonal aspects. journal of fish biology 61: 1154– 1170. casselman, j.m. 1978. effects on environmental factors on growth, survival, activity and exploitation of northern pike. american fisheries society special publication 11: 114– 128. elfron, b. 1979. bootstrap methods: another look at the jackknife. annals of statistics 7: 1–26. erm, v., kangur, m. & saat, t. 2002. fishes and ﬁshery of the matsalu wetland in the 1980s. in: saat, t., ed. fishes and ﬁshery of the va¨inameri. tartu university publishers, tartu (estonia), pp. 9–45 (in estonian with english summary). finstad, a.g., jansen, p.a. & langeland, a. 2000. gillnet selectivity and size and age structure of an alpine arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) population. canadian journal of fish- eries and aquatic sciences 57: 1718–1727. hamley, j.m. 1975. review of gillnet selectivity. journal of the fisheries research board of canada 32: 1943–1969. hardewig, i. & van dijk, p.l.m. 2003. is digestive capacity limiting growth at low temperatures in roach?
