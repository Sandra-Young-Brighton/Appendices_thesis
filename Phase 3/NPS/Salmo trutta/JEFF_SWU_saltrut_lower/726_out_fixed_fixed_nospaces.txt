rubble slopes were the least inhabited. habitat associations differed among species. among adults, bream abramis brama, white bream blicca bjoerkna and roach rutilus rutilus were associated with beaches and stump fields, whereas perch perca fluviatilis, ruffe gymnocephalus cernuus, asp aspius aspius and pike esox lucius were associated with rubble slopes. bream, white bream, bleak alburnus alburnus, roach, ruffe and pikeperch sander lucioperca were associated with beaches among juveniles, whereas the only juvenile associated with rubble slopes was perch. we showed that most common species are associated with distinct habitats and also that utilisation of various littoral habitats differs in general. key words: habitat associations; gillnet; reservoir; structural complexity; slope steepness; community structure introduction littoral habitats littoral zones of reservoirs and lakes are fundamental for fish inhabitants (winfield 2004). reproductive success of most fish species is especially dependent on the quality of (kennedy & fitzmaurice 1970; kahl et al. 2008). many juvenile fish utilise the littoral zone of reservoirs (vasek et al. 2006; brosse et al. 2007) to maximise growth and minimise predation pressure (gardner et al. 1998). for reasons such as feeding, resting or seeking refuge from predators (kubecka 1993), adult fish utilise the littoral zone of reservoirs as well (j€arvalt et al. 2005; prchalova et al. 2009). the littoral zone of a reservoir is scarcely uniform (brosse et al. 2007), and many authors mention a crucial role of littoral structural complexity for fish (jennings et al. 1999; poulet et al. 2005). however, the importance of the littoral zone may differ among habitats: at least two distinct habitats are formed in typical canyon-shaped reservoirs–rubble slopes and beaches (kratochvíl et al. 2012). due to functions of reservoirs, such as water storage and power genera- tion, water levels usually vary in time (winfield 2004; krolova et al. 2011). water-level variability together with freezing erosion during winter results in formation of rubble slopes. when the slope steep- ness is considerably high, rubble slopes often develop within a few years after a reservoir is flooded. when the slope is mild, the fine particles sediment on the bottom which results in sandy or muddy beaches (li et al. 2001; krolova et al. 2011). correspondence: marek smejkal, biology centre of the academy of sciences of the czech republic, v.v.i., institute of hydrobiology, na sadkach 7, 370 05 ceske budejovice, czech republic. e-mail: mareks1@centrum.cz doi: 10.1111/eff.12094 405 smejkal et al. considering that reservoirs are often flooded for- ested valleys, habitats densely embedded with tree stumps are common in recently filled reservoirs (kratochvíl et al. 2012). however, stump fields are missing in older reservoirs due to decomposition of roots. fluctuation, submerged aquatic vegetation strongly influences the distribution of fish in the littoral zone (rossier et al. 1996; brosse et al. 2007). unfortunately, water-level turbidity and unfavourable edaphic conditions prevent the growth of large for- mations of submerged aquatic vegetation (winfield 2004). in most reservoirs, the presence of submerged aquatic vegetation is usually restricted to tributaries is nearly constant (krolova where the water level et al. 2011). finally, rocks are a common littoral habitat in res- ervoirs (kratochvíl et al. 2012), but depth varies greatly in this habitat due to steep slope and thus pre- vents properly made littoral sampling in desired depth with benthic gillnets. fish habitat associations in lotic waters are driven mainly by stream width, water velocity, substrate type and underwater structures (gosselin et al. 2010; santos et al. 2011). however, few studies have tar- geted littoral habitat associations in lentic waters of europe (ekl€ov 1997; fischer & eckmann 1997; brosse et al. 1999), and their results usually describe only one particular species or ontogenetic group. thus, there is a lack of knowledge about littoral habi- tat associations, especially of adult fish communities. some habitat associations of common species have been revealed mostly by laboratory experiments. fine sediment or mud was the favourable feeding ground for bream abramis brama, roach rutilus rutilus, juvenile tench tinca tinca and ruffe gymnocephalus cernuus (diehl 1988; rendon et al. 2003; dieterich et al. 2004), whereas coarse substrate or structured habitat was the favourable feeding environment for both juvenile and adult perch perca fluviatilis and pike esox lucius (diehl 1988; dieterich et al. 2004; kobler et al. 2008). together with recently well-doc- umented importance of open water of reservoirs and lakes for mentioned common fish species (j€arvalt et al. 2005; juza et al. 2009), the better knowledge about littoral habitat associations in vivo has a poten- tial to improve our understanding of reservoir ecosys- tem as a whole. the aim of this study was to describe patterns of fish distribution in different littoral habitats in reser- voirs. we expected that because of different charac- teristics of fish communities inhabiting them would differ in species composition, overall biomass and abundance. we anticipated that the association with different littoral habitats would be both species- and age-specific. these three habitats, 406 methods study areas the research was conducted in the czech republic in four canyon-shaped reservoirs rímov, vír, vranov and zlutice. these reservoirs have fish communities that range between percid and cyprinid phase of succession (ríha et al. 2009). all reservoirs are used primarily for water supply purposes and further for the hydropower generation. the vranov reservoir is the only reservoir used for recreation, and access to the other reservoirs is restricted. basic characteristics of these reservoirs are presented in table 1. gillnet sampling gillnets (pokorny-síte, brloh, czech benthic republic) were used to sample littoral habitats. benthic gillnets were constructed according to european standard document en 14 757 (2005; 1.5 9 30 m height 9 length, 12 mesh sizes). single gillnets were deployed 2 h before sunset at depths between two and three metres, set overnight and lifted the next day 2 h after sunrise (prchalova et al. 2010). the gillnet samplings were carried out during the late summers of two consecutive years: 2010 and 2011. during the first year, the rímov reservoir was chosen for pilot sampling of structured habitats (rub- ble slopes and stump fields). after determining gill- net sampling in structured habitats as feasible, all four reservoirs were sampled in 2011. late summer was chosen as the best time for extensive sampling of the reservoir fish community because juveniles of a majority of fish species are large enough to be sam- pled using gillnets and identified (prchalova et al. 2009). additionally, no spawning or winter migra- tions take place during this part of the year in czech reservoirs (hladík & kubecka 2003). gillnets were set at four localities (dam, middle, upper and tribu- table 1. basic characteristics of reservoirs rı´mov, vı´r, vranov and zlutice. epilimnetic total phosphorus (total p) and chlorophyll-a concentrations are mean values in the growing season (may–september). characteristics rımov vır vranov zlutice 12.0 210 16.0 45 100 26.4 18.0 471 length (km) surface (ha) average depth (m) maximum depth (m) retention time (days) total p (lg l  1) chlorophyll a (lg l elevation (m a. s. l.) gps location of the dam 48°50′ n, 14°29′ e 1978 year of filling  1) 9.3 223 25.0 65 180 35.1 29.3 464 49°33′ n, 16°18′ e 1958 30.0 761 17.4 47 160 57.0 31.1 353 48°54′ n, 15°49′ e 1933 4.6 167 9.0 27 145 25.8 14.8 511 50°05′ n, 13°09′ e 1968 sources: http://www.pmo.cz/, http://www.pvl.cz/, vasek et al. 2013. gently sloped littoral by steepness  sd; beaches, rubble slopes and stump fields were sam- pled in the rímov reservoir, whereas only beaches and rubble slopes were sampled in reservoirs vír, vranov and zlutice. these littoral habitats repre- sented 99% of all in these reservoirs. the marginal habitats were represented by rocks and mac- rophytes, which were both scarce and too patchy to be sampled by gillnets. the slope steepness was mea- sured by inclinometer (leica disto d5) with at least 10 independent measurements on each habitat. bea- ches were shores defined (9.9°  3.6°, mean 28  9 m, mean distance from the bank  sd) with fine sedi- ment on the bottom and without occurrence of any underwater structures. rubble slopes were formed in the bank (31.5°  4.4°; steep-sloped parts of 7.5  1 m), where boulder size was 25  6 cm in diameter, and remnants of old tree stumps were often present (former forests on valley slopes). stump habi- tat with density stump per 10 m2 was gently sloped (8.2°  0.3°; 30  1 m) with fine substrate on the bottom. the water temperature was similar both between sampled habitats and reservoirs as well (average temperature across habitats and locali- ties  sd: rímov 2011-19.8  0.1°c; vír-19.2  0.7°c; vranov– 21  0.6°c; zlutice - 20.5  0.2°c). water level was usual in all reservoirs during sampling, with no terrestrial vegetation flooded or dried-up littoral areas. the maximum distance between habitats sam- pled at the same locality was approximately one kilo- metre. each habitat was sampled at each locality independently three times by setting single benthic gillnets parallel to the shore. 2010-20.8  0.3°c;

species scores were divided by the standard deviation, and samples were standardised by norm. statistical significances were analysed by monte carlo permutation tests. restricted permutation tests were performed with blocks defined by covariates to quantify the effect of a given environmental variable (the samples were permuted only within blocks and never across blocks; leps & smilauer 2003). partial rda was used to test the environmental variables of habitat, independently. the other environmental variables were used as covariates in the particular tests, where we did not intend to interpret their effects; however, we wanted to take their effect into account simultaneously (these vari- ables would make bi-plots too difficult to read). the responses of dependent variables to individual envi- ronmental variables were fitted using general linear models (glm; canodraw software, faculty of sci- ence, university of south bohemia, ceske budejo- vice, czech republic). uncommon species in sampled reservoirs (carp cyprinus carpio, gudgeon gobio gobio, pumpkinseed sunfish lepomis gibbo- sus, chub squalius cephalus) were down-weighted in analyses, and species with weak responses to tested environmental variables were excluded from bi-plots. locality and reservoir results comparison of littoral habitats in total, 7231 fish individuals with a total weight of 437 kg were caught during this study. the total fish biomass considerably abundance differed and 407 smejkal et al.

adult fish community were associated with rubble slopes: perch, ruffe, pike and asp aspius aspius (fig. 2a). the only juvenile associ- ated with rubble slopes was perch (fig. 2b). effect of reservoir, habitat, slope steepness and locality all variables included in rda analysis explained 50.4% of variability in the adult community structure and 62.5% of variability in the juvenile community structure (table 4). all tested environmental vari- ables had significant effects on structures of both adult and juvenile fish communities with exception of locality for juveniles. the reservoir variable had the largest effect on community structure (table 4). reservoir explained 23.8% of the variability in the community structure of adults and 34.7% in the juvenile community struc- ture. the adult fish community of the vranov reser- voir was dominated by bream, bleak, pikeperch and white bream, whereas the main species in the rímov reservoir was roach. the community structure showed a high proportion of perch in the vír reser- voir. the zlutice reservoir was the only reservoir with a high occurrence of european catfish silurus glanis, rudd scardinius erythrophthalmus and tench (fig. 3a) and an absence of bream and bleak. habitat combined with slope steepness described patterns in communities better together than either variable alone (table 4). therefore, the interpretation of fish associations was more accurate while using both environmental variables. the composition of the adult biomass on particular littoral habitat was a function not only of the habitat but also of locality position along longitudinal axis of reservoir (table 4). a majority of species were more abundant reservoirs, namely ruffe, bream, white bream, tench and pike (fig. 3b). a different pattern was revealed for perch, european catfish and asp. perch and european catfish were most abundant in the dam part of reservoirs. asp tended to occupy the middle part of reservoirs. in tributary parts of discussion we demonstrated significant species-specific associa- tions with various littoral habitats during this study. beach, stump fields and rubble slope habitats differed in relative abundance and biomass of fish as well as in species composition. parameters of fish communities also differed along longitudinal axis of reservoirs and among reservoirs. beaches seem to be the most productive habitat in four reservoirs sampled in this study. stump fields, present in one reservoir only, did not differ signifi- cantly from beaches in both abundance and biomass, so these habitats appeared to be rather similar. rubble slopes proved to be less productive habitat with caught biomass reaching half of the catch on the beaches. the similar pattern was found in north america for zoo- benthos, which had in lake memphremagog in epi- limnetic beaches two times higher biomass than on 409 smejkal et al. (a) (b) fig. 2. redundancy analysis (rda) bi-plots of adult (a) and juvenile (b) fish biomass associations with three littoral habitats and with slope steepness. black triangles represent the three sam- pled habitats and are discrete value environmental variables (beach, rubble slopes and stump fields). the thick arrow repre- sents the association with the continuous environmental variable slope steepness. the correlation between each species and envi- ronmental variable can be deduced from the direction and magni- tude of each thin arrow. high correlations between a species biomass and an environmental variable can be identified by arrows whose direction and magnitude match the location of the environmental variable in the bi-plot. sites, where organic material did not sediment (kalf 2002). the possible explanation for differences in fish biomass and abundance is therefore invertebrate pro- ductivity of these habitats and therefore higher food availability, which seems to be higher on beaches. habitat associations of seven common species were described in this study. bream, white bream and roach predominantly grouped together among habitats; they 410 (habitat, variables table 4. response of both adult and juvenile fish communities to slope steepness, habitat + slope environmental steepness, locality and reservoir) in per cent of explained variability of the community structure. the analyses presented are partial rdas, using the other factors as covariables. bold values in the p-value column indicate significant effects. environmental variables adult fish habitat slope steepness habitat & slope steepness locality reservoir all together juvenile fish habitat slope steepness habitat & slope steepness locality reservoir all together explained variability (%) f statistics p-value 6.1 7.5 12.0 8.9 23.8 50.4 6.2 7.3 11.2 5.3 34.7 62.5 1.922 5.004 2.755 2.045 5.447 3.844 2.558 6.310 3.368 1.606 10.476 6.288 0.032 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.020 0.004 0.004 0.066 0.002 0.002 were associated with gently sloped habitats–beaches and stump fields. these species are known to prosper in turbid waters, where they can feed effectively on zooplankton (persson 1987; persson et al. 1991). cyprinids also thrive from reduced predation pressure, which is lower in case of waters with higher trophic state (persson et al. 1991; ríha et al. 2009). in sam- pled reservoirs, beaches and stump fields showed less abundance of predators compared with rubble slopes. generally, more is known about habitat associations of juvenile fish than about those of adults (fischer & eckmann 1997; brosse et al. 1999, 2007). studies of brosse et al. (1999, 2007) were targeted on the shal- low littoral zone at a depth of up to one metre with and without vegetation. in these studies, the most com- mon fish were juvenile roach, rudd and perch, which occupied habitat with macrophytes predominantly. reservoirs in our study lack submerged macrophytes due to steep-sloped banks and frequent water-level fluctuation (winfield 2004; krolova et al. 2011). similar habitats as in our study were sampled by fi- scher & eckmann (1997) in lake constance. juve- niles of perch and ruffe occupied macrophytes, whereas adults were recorded on pebbles and boulders in the greatest abundance. because we have almost no macrophytes in our reservoirs, juvenile perch were associated with rubble slopes as well as adults of perch and ruffe. perch inhabit mainly steep slope banks and underwater structures (imbrock et al. 1996; ekl€ov 1997). ruffe, known to feed mainly on benthic invertebrates (bergman & greenberg 1994) at night (schleuter & eckmann 2006), was also associated with rubble slopes. these two species seemed not to avoid competition in reservoirs spatially, but tempo- rarily: ruffe is present in littoral in large amount just at (a) (b) the four sampled reservoirs fig. 3. redundancy analysis (rda) bi-plots of adult fish biomass associations with the four sampled reservoirs (a) and with the dif- ferent localities in each reservoir (b). black triangles in (a) repre- sent and are discrete value environmental variables (rímov, vranov, vír, zlutice). black tri- angles in (b) represent the localities sampled in each reservoir (dam, middle and tributary for zlutice; dam, middle, upper and tributary for rímov, vranov and vír). the correlation between each species and environmental variable can be deduced as per the explanation in fig. 2. night feeding actively (ríha et al. 2011), while resting in depths throughout the day (prchalova et al. 2009). in addition to perch and ruffe, two other species were associated with rubble slopes: asp and pike. asp predominantly inhabits open water of reservoirs (prchalova et al. 2008). rubble slopes resemble open water to large extent, and open water starts just few metres from the shore due to steep banks. thus, asp could utilise both open water conditions and higher concentration of prey in near shore habitats. pike is generally known to inhabit structured littoral habitats (cook & bergersen 1988; casselman & lewis 1996). in our study, pike catches (although relatively rare and difficult in rubble slopes. however, especially in the case of pike, the gillnet catches might be indicating fish activity and encounter possibility due to gillnet placement relative to comment) were highest associations of fish with various types to pike territory rather than real fish density (holm- gren 1999; olin & malinen 2003). although fish communities differed markedly between sampled reservoirs and reservoir factor explained the largest part of variability in community structure, differences in biomass and abundance among habitats were found constant across reservoirs. additionally, sampled reservoirs differed in their tro- phic state with zlutice reservoir in the lowest trophic state and vranov reservoir reaching highest trophic state with a community dominated by cyprinids. however, even under conditions of different trophic state followed described patterns of species-specific associations with individual littoral habitats. community structure, fish and generally, specimens optimise their ecological niche in the environment; therefore, by choosing of optimal habitat, they try to both maximise growth (gardner et al. 1998; krause et al. 1998) and mini- mise predation pressure (skov et al. 2008). a good indicator of growth maximisation measured by inges- tion rate is swimming speed (priyadarshana et al. 2001), by which could be observed species ability to utilise certain habitat. diehl (1988) studied foraging of adult bream, roach and perch. roach and bream were superior foragers on beaches, whereas in structured habitat, their swimming speed and ingestion rate were lowered considerably. however, the swimming speed of perch was less affected by habitat structural com- plexity. as a visually oriented predator (bergman 1988), perch is a superior forager in structured habitats (winfield 1986; diehl 1988). in lake constance and degersj€on, perch was found to inhabit steeply sloped structured habitats as well (imbrock et al. 1996; ekl€ov 1997). according to jennings et al. (1999), rubble slopes, which co-occur with steep-sloped banks, could enhance structural complexity of the littoral zone and therefore have positive effect on fish community. in case of four sampled reservoirs, rubble slopes seemed to be associated with species, whose densities were otherwise declining throughout succession of reservoir (with exception of ruffe; ríha et al. 2009). recently, effect of position of the sampling locality along the longitudinal gradient of water bodies was studied extensively with respect to fish biomass and community structure (vasek et al. 2006; prchalova et al. 2009). it is evident that fish species are not dis- tributed regularly within reservoirs. in addition to tro- phic level, phytoplankton (hejzlar & vyhnalek 1998) and zooplankton abundance (sed’a & devetter 2000) decrease along the longitudinal axis of a reservoir from the tributary towards the dam, which is the same overall pattern found for fish biomass (siler et al. 1986). fish such as bream, white bream, ruffe and tench that prosper in higher trophic conditions are more abundant in these productive tributary parts 411 smejkal et al. of reservoirs with higher food availability (vasek et al. 2004). the opposite pattern was revealed for perch, which, as a visually oriented predator (persson et al. 1988; bergman 1991), prefer waters with lower trophic conditions at reservoirs (prchalova et al. 2008). these patterns were found also in our study; however, community structure was more influenced by habitat type than by position of the locality on the longitudinal axis. the dam parts of to conclude, littoral habitats of sampled reservoirs differed considerably in fish abundance, biomass and community structure. common species were found to have habitat associations that are stable in various reservoirs. competition for food and avoidance of predators were hypothesised to be driving forces for found patterns. acknowledgements we would like to thank v. drastík, j.
