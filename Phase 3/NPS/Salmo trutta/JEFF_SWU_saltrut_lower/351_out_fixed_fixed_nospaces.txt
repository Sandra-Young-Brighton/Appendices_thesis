crisp, 2000). quantiﬁcation of suitable habitat requirements of juvenile salmon is, there- fore, an important management consideration for conservation and enhancement of the resource, and for estimations of optimum spawning escape- ments. measurements of abundance of young salmon are standard procedures for estimating the health of salmon stocks and for predicting yields of smolt and subsequent adult returns (chadwick & claytor 1990; chadwick & green 1985; kennedy & crozier 1993). a number of predictive models have been developed, relating habitat variables to salmonid densities (e.g., bovee 1982; winstone 1993; annoni et al. 1997; heggenes et al. 1999; stoneman & jones 2000). also, habitat may be described as ‘primary’ or ‘secondary’ and distribution related to density and temperature (bult et al. 1999). the abun- dance of the young year-classes at sites is some- times related to some target number or index 207 gibson functional (elson 1967; grant et al. 1998). a general esti- mate of ﬂuvial abundance is frequently derived from the average density from selected sites in the system (elson & tuomi 1975; chadwick & green 1985; randall & chadwick 1986), but without full consideration being given to river ecosystem functioning. therefore, the accuracy of results from averages over different types of habitats in different river reaches for estimating numerical changes related to spawning escape- ments, or to smolt yields from the system in following years, depends on choice and weighting of sampling sites. types and abundance of suita- ble prey items change with gradients of the macro- invertebrate feeding groups with stream succession (vannote et al. 1980). also, juvenile salmon migrate within the ﬂuvial system (cunjak & randall 1993; erkinaro & gibson 1997; erkinaro et al. 1998a). in this paper, i give examples from within and between some rivers of eastern canada of the wide range of production that can occur, related to biological and physico- chemical factors, and describe work in a new- foundland river to emphasise that estimates of juvenile salmon populations in a system should take into account the diversity of habitats that occurs in the whole river ecosystem. at present, at least in canada, relative production within and between river systems is not taken into account in estimating optimum spawning escapements, and the factors discussed will be helpful in improving management goals. sources of data and study sites growth rates and relative biomass are reviewed from studies on the matamek river, on the north shore of the gulf of st. lawrence, in quebec, and from some rivers in newfoundland. more detailed population estimates at various sites over a num- ber of years are presented from the highlands river in south-western newfoundland (fig. 1, and river characteristics described in gibson et al. 1987). population estimates were made at most sites by the depletion method, with four removals, using an electro shocker (zippin 1958; bohlin et al. 1989), but where proportions of captures in sweeps were below about 0.5, in such sites as deep pools, some ﬂats and in lakes and ponds, ﬁsh were captured in addition by a beach seine, and population estimates made by the mark and recapture method (ricker 1975). habitat variables were measured at all sites. habi- tat types and detailed methodology are described in gibson et al. 1993 and gibson et al. 1998. sizes and population estimates are presented from data collected in late summer (july–august), after the 208 main growing period, and before ﬁsh migrate towards winter habitat. further details are pre- sented in the referenced papers. although bio- logical production, which correctly should refer to the elaboration of organic tissue over a time period (ivlev 1966), was estimated at some sites in the highlands river only in one instance (gibson et al. 1987), it was generally impractical to sample sites more than once a year. the term ‘production’ in comparing some sites here is therefore, in some instances, inferred from growth and density estimates. growth and biomass potentials growth rate has consequences on age of smolting and age at maturity (myers et al. 1986; hutchings & jones 1998). there is a wide range of growth within the species’ geographical distribution, related to climate, but also to habitat and to biotic factors. in general, slowest and fastest growth rates of juvenile salmon are at the most northern and southern limits of the species’ range (reviewed in hutchings & jones 1998). however, the range of growth rates of juvenile salmon that can occur in eastern canada, summarised in fig. 2, taken from published papers, is close to the species’ growth possibilities in its geographical range. all these sites were between latitudes 468460n (northeast trepassey brook) and 488110n (high- lands river) in newfoundland, and at 508180n (matamek river) on the north shore of the gulf of st. lawrence in quebec. although growth and production is controlled primarily by food avail- ability and temperature (egglishaw & shackley 1985; elliott & hurley 1997), the wide range in growth between sites in this relatively small geo- graphical area of the species distribution suggests that food availability, affected by habitat and competition, had greater consequence, although modiﬁed by climate. the slowest growth shown was in northeast trepassey brook (erkinaro & gibson 1997), which is a third-order, infertile stream, with high densities of young salmon (gibson et al. 1993). the greatest growth we found was in a small fertile lake in the city of st. john’s (kenny’s pond), where unfed salmon fry, of parents from a local river, were planted shortly after emergence (gibson & haedrich 1988). both males and females at age 2þ were mature in the lake, even though originating from anadromous stock. similarly, unfed fry of the same stock were planted in a fertile stream in st. john’s (south brook), and showed exceptional growth, despite high densities (gibson & hae- drich 1988). this stream was enriched from farm- land fertilisers and nearby suburbs, and although habitats, growth and migration of juvenile atlantic salmon fig. 1. the highlands river and its location in south-western newfoundland, eastern canada. r, f, p, l are the stations (r¼ riffle, f¼ flat, p¼ pool, l¼ lake). was not polluted, the additional nutrients enhanced the high abundance of suitable food items (gibson & colbo 2000). salmon fry stocked upstream of enrichment showed growth more normal for the area. the ﬁgures shown for the matamek river at low densities and for high densities were in dif- ferent years at the same station, and illustrate the effects of intraspeciﬁc competition (gibson 1978). 209 gibson fig. 2. ranges in the fork lengths of sal- mon parr recorded in eastern canada. data are from the following sources: kennys pd is a small lake in st. john’s, newfoundland (gibson & haedrich 1988); s.br. is a riffle station on a third- order enriched river, south brook, in st. john’s (gibson & colbo 2000); mat. 5 is a station below a lake on the mata- mek river in quebec (gibson & dick- son 1984); mat. low dens and mat. high were at the same station (2nd falls) on the matamek river, in different years, at relatively low and at high densities, at a distance downstream from mat. 5 (gibson 1978); mat.–t is the same sta- tion (2nd falls) on the matamek riber, when the brook_trout were removed, in a year of relatively high salmon density (gibson & dickson 1984); hlds is a rif- fle station in rainy brook, a tributary of the highlands river, newfoundland (gibson et al. 1996a); ne trep is a sta- tion on northeast trepassey brook, newfoundland (erkinaro & gibson 1997). when brook_trout, salvelinus_fontinalis (mitchill), were removed from this station, the size of the 2þ parr was enhanced (mat.–t in fig. 2), even though occurring at higher densities than the low-density ﬁgures, which we interpreted as illus- trating negative interspeciﬁc effects by trout on the large parr in the pool environment, where trout possibly have the competitive advantage (gibson & dickson 1984). the greatest growth we found in the matamek river was close to a lake (mat. 5 in fig. 2), where ﬁlter feeding insects were abundant (gibson & dickson 1984). also illustrated is the size of young salmon from rainy brook in highlands river (hlds), described below. at each of the sites described above, the ﬁsh species diversity was low, with two salmonids being the dominant species. the range in salmonid biomass found in rifﬂe stations at a number of sites in newfoundland is illustrated in fig. 3, with two species of salmonid being present at each site, comparable to the biomass range through the species’ distribution (gibson 1993). a fairly high biomass was found in ouananiche beck, where overhanging bank vege- tation provided good cover for the brook_trout (gibson et al. 1996b). the highest biomass was 210 found in south brook, an enriched stream in st. john’s, illustrating enhancement resulting from higher nutrient levels. in south brook, the abun- dant 1þ and 0þ salmon had a negative effect on the brown_trout, salmo_trutta l., in the rifﬂe habitats (gibson & haedrich 1988). examples of habitat effects on biomass and densities from the highlands river, newfoundland the comparative biomasses of juvenile salmon in rifﬂe, ﬂat, pool and lake habitats, in the late summer (august) of 1995, are shown in fig. 4. we found a range in salmon biomass from 2.30 g m 2 in a rifﬂe of a second-order tributary (bald mountain brook), to 0 in a pool at the lower end of the river (gillam’s farm). this latter ﬁgure was checked by underwater observations with ‘snorkelling’ the pool, but neither salmon nor trout were seen. we found this surprising, since an adjacent rifﬂe and ﬂat in the same stretch had 1.62 and 1.63 g m 2, respectively. the pool in the second-order stream (bald mountain brook) had a salmon biomass of 2.12 g m 2. mean depths of these two pools were similar, 53.0 cm at the upper station and 60.0 cm at the lower station, as were habitats, growth and migration of juvenile atlantic salmon fig. 3. the comparative biomass of sal- monids recorded in riffle stations of some third-order newfoundland rivers. hlds¼ rainy brook, a tributary of the highlands river (gibson et al. 1996a);

p¼ 0.061) and 1þ salmon (r¼ 0.48; p¼ 0.044). the negative correlation with salmon was most likely related to displacement by competition of yearling trout by salmon in rifﬂe habitats, described in other studies (gibson 1988). the stepwise regression for 1þ densities retained the variables, mean depth (d, cm), % canopy cover (c), and densities of 2þ and older trout (t2), as follows: t1þ¼ 0.11d  0.18cþ 0.90t2þ 4.71 (p¼ 0.01;

p¼ 0.050). the stepwise regression is: t2¼ 0.20cþ 0.87t1þ0.11d  4.07(p¼ 0.01; r2¼ 0.89). self-thinning relationships and movements of juvenile salmon the self-thinning hypothesis has been applied to salmonids, in which with competition densities decrease related to growth of the species, with possible slopes of  1.00 if total biomass remains constant during self-thinning,  1.08 if territory size limits population density and  1.33 if total metabolic rate of the population remains constant during self-thinning. elliott (1993), grant (1993) and bohlin et al. (1994) favoured the energetic equivalence hypothesis, whereas steingrı´ msson & grant (1999) found evidence for the territory size hypothesis, where food abundance declined over the study period. elliott (1993) showed that with a population of brown_trout self-thinning closely followed a hypothesised  4/3 power rule as pre- dicted by energetics allometries, i.e., if the mean weights of succeeding age-classes of trout were plotted against their densities as logarithmic func- tions, the slope would be close to  1.33. however, a problem with some salmonids is that year- classes migrate to other habitats or sections of the river as they develop, or densities are low enough related to resources that density-depen- dent migration or mortality is not severe enough for the self-thinning rule to apply (armstrong 1997). i plotted self-thinning slopes for three year-classes of salmon at a number of rifﬂe sites and a pool site in highlands river, and for two year-classes at a rifﬂe site in south brook (fig. 6). the majority of smolts in highlands river migrate at 3þ (19.5% 2þ, 72.5% 3þ and 8.0% 4þ in 1996), whereas the majority of ﬁsh in south brook would migrate at 2þ (gibson & haedrich 1988), so only two age-classes can be used for the latter plot. the slopes for the two south brook year-classes were  1.26 and  1.22, close to the hypothesised ﬁgure of  1.33. at the stations in highlands river, slopes varied from þ0.33 at a fourth-order downstream site (gillam’s farm), to  1.54 at a pool station in a third-order tributary, probably related to ﬁsh movements, illustrating the problems suggested by armstrong (1997). the relatively greater production in south brook is reﬂected in the higher intercept, of 3.19, than seen in the stations of highlands river. at the enriched site (south brook) suitable habitat was available for both year-classes, and self-thinning may have occurred related to competition for food as sizes increased. the regression in rainy brook pool has a slope of  1.54, close to, but a little greater than the hypothesised ﬁgure, which possibly reﬂects suitable habitat having been present for all three year-classes, with some immigration of larger parr. the slopes at the second- and third- order tributary sites vary from  0.60 to  1.04 and possibly reﬂect emigration of larger parr. at the downstream site, 0þ were relatively few (the station at gillam’s farm in fig. 5), and the slope of þ0.33 would fourth-order rifﬂe 213 gibson fig. 6. self-thinning relationships of ju- venile salmon at stations in the high- lands river and a riffle station in south brook (s. br.). above a beaver dam, where densities of parr were sparse. highest densities of 1þ parr were at the small rainy rifﬂe station (sm rny), with small size, but the 2þ parr were sparse. habitat was likely more suitable for the 1þ age-class than 2þ at this station, since the water was shallow (16 cm mean depth, substrate rating 3.3 – pebble and cobble) compared with, for example, gillam’s farm rifﬂe where the 2þ were abundant in deeper water and coarser substrate (36 cm mean depth, substrate rating 4.7 – 50% boulder). data for the pool habitats and the lake habitat are displayed, although not included in the regressions. growth of 2þ parr in the second- and third-order pools (bald mtn pool; small rny pool; rny pool) was better than might be expected in rifﬂe habitats, but growth of the 1þ parr in pools was similar to that in rifﬂes. similarly, better growth in pools by large parr has been described for rivers in norway (bremset & berg 1997). sizes of both 1þ and 2þ parr in the lake (l.l.) were larger than at most sites, but not larger than might be expected from the density–weight regression. several workers have remarked on the relatively faster growth of salmon parr in lakes compared to lotic habitats (e.g., blair 1943; hutchings 1986; pepper et al. 1987; erkinaro et al. 1995; halvorsen & svenning 2000), related possibly to less competition for food and to reduced energy expenditure in the lentic habitat, and to enhanced feeding opportu- nities (erkinaro et al. 1998b). density-dependent represent migration of larger parr to this down- stream reach. except for the pool station, slopes were less than  1.33, suggesting that factors other than competition for food operated, and that there were movements of ﬁsh between sites. although the plots are unexpected in that at highlands river stations they apparently are not representing density changes within a year-class, the self-thinning regressions indicate factors determining the population structure at certain sites so that comparisons with the hypothesised regression indicates migration of year-classes from or to the site. density-dependent growth is apparent in high- lands river, illustrated in fig. 7. i plotted the logarithmic values of mean weights versus densi- ties of 1þ and 2þ salmon parr at various rifﬂe stations in 1996. there was no correlation for 0þ (r2¼ 0.03; p¼ 0.589). however, there were weak correlations for the 1þ (r2¼ 0.48; p¼ 0.006) and for the 2þ (r2¼ 0.39; p¼ 0.031), and distribution of the points about the regression indicate relative habitat quality. for example, both 1þ and 2þ parr were larger than might be expected for their densities at the gillam’s farm (glm) rifﬂe station. this station is downstream from a lake, and invertebrates sampled at this station in 1980 and in 1981 were very much more abundant at this station than at any other (gibson et al. 1987). best growth for both the 1þ and 2þ was at the upper rainy station, a second-order stream 214 habitats, growth and migration of juvenile atlantic salmon fig. 7. density–weight relationships of salmon parr in the highlands river, 1996. glm¼ the riffle station at gillam’s farm, below loch leven;

gibson et al. 1987). such methods are cheaper than standard trapping tech- niques, and would put less stress than trapping on the ﬁsh at this delicate stage. densities of juvenile salmon related to spawning escapement after closure of the commercial ﬁshery in 1992, the spawning escapement in the highlands river increased, and the densities of underyearling sal- mon increased considerably from those estimated 10 years previously (fig. 9). this occurred at all stations, but the relative increase was greatest in the main stem third-order tributary, river brook (results from an upper station are shown in the upper panel of fig. 9). river brook has a steeper gradient and coarser substrate than the other tributaries, so i interpreted the relatively greater increase in fry to spawning by large salmon (older than one sea-winter), which are better able to dig redds in the coarser substratum than grilse (one sea-winter) (kondolf & wolman 1993). anecdo- 216 fig. 9. the densities of juvenile salmon at two stations in the highlands river over the years of study. habitats, growth and migration of juvenile atlantic salmon fig. 10. the adult salmon returns to the highlands river over the years of the study. tal evidence from earlier years suggested that only large salmon migrated up river brook (palmer 1928). the commercial exploitation of large sal- mon before ﬁshery closure was about 51–60%, and since closure of the commercial ﬁshery the number of large salmon in the run to the river has increased in greater proportions than the grilse (gibson et al. 1996a). the relative proportion of grilse to large salmon has changed from 2.27– 2.83, 10 years ago, to 0.93–1.21 in recent years (fig. 10). it is likely, therefore, that the increase in the large salmon component was primarily responsible for the greater underyearling densities in river brook. this changed drastically in 1996 when in mid-february there was a severe ﬂood, discharge rising from 1.57 m3 s 1 on 16 february to 79.2 m3 s 1 on 18 february, categorised as a ‘20-year ﬂood’ (personal communication, dr wasi ullah, water resources management division, government of newfoundland and labrador). massive amounts of substrate were displaced, prior to fry emergence, no doubt caus- ing high mortalities of this stage (fig. 9), and possibly of older age-classes. smolt output was reduced and adult salmon escapement conse- quently declined (dempson & clarke 2000; anon- ymous 2001). the highlands river can be classiﬁed as a ‘ﬂashy’ river (gibson et al. 1987), and therefore not so productive as more stable rivers. stable river systems are known to be more productive of invertebrates and ﬁsh than rivers with high ranges in discharge (hynes 1970; binns & eiserman 1979; milner et al. 2000; saegrov et al. 2001). in addi- tion to movements of the substrate caused by ﬂoods, with resulting effects on ﬁsh eggs and the stream fauna (badcock 1953; spina 2001), low ﬂows have negative effects on various life stages of young salmon (gibson & myers 1988; ghent & hanna 1999). in newfoundland, many river systems contain lakes. lakes have stabilising inﬂuences on the hydrology and temperature regimes of the outﬂowing rivers, and although they are, in general, nutrient traps, they export seston as high-quality food for ﬁlter feeding inver- tebrates downstream (thonney et al. 1987; richardson & mackay 1991). production of sal- monids is therefore increased for varying dis- tances downstream, depending on size of the lake and the river (gibson & galbraith 1975; gibson et al. 1984; einarsson et al. 1990; erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). similarly, o’connell & ash (1993) found that growth rates of juvenile salmon in newfoundland was better in ‘lacustrine’ type rivers than in ‘ﬂuvial’ systems, degerman et al. (1996) found growth of brown_trout, and har- aldstad et al. (1987) found densities of brown_trout, greater in the outlets of lakes. in order to test for possible consequences of lakes on produc- tion of salmon, i plotted ‘spawning targets’ against the ratio of lacustrine habitat (m2) to ﬂuvial habitat (m2) of each system. the ‘spawning target’ is the conservation spawning requirement, which in canada presently is 240 eggs 100 m 2 of ﬂuvial habitat (anonymous 1992), with an allow- ance for lake production of 368 eggs ha 1 of lacustrine area in most newfoundland lakes, and 105 eggs ha 1 in some northern lakes (o’con- nell & dempson 1995). the spawning targets i used were means taken from 20 rivers with adult 217 gibson fig. 11. the proportion of potential egg deposition related to the conservation requirement (% spawning target) re-

production of salmon is positively related to the area of lakes in the watershed. this could be interpreted as an underestimate of lake production of juvenile sal- mon, but is probably mainly due to the enhancing effect of lakes on efﬂuent rivers, shown in other studies. although the regression in fig. 11 should be looked on as indicative rather than predictive, data points which ﬁt poorly can be examined for possible disturbances. for example, harry’s river (h) is well below the regression line. this river’s basin has been 28% logged, and with 0.63 stream crossings km 2 logged, more than in other rivers in the plot (scruton d. a., department of fisheries and oceans canada, newfoundland, personal communication). logging roads create sediment in run off to streams (everest et al. 1987), which is damaging to stream production (waters 1995), and a large proportion of culverted stream crossings obstruct ﬁsh passage (harper & quigley 2000). such effects may have degraded harry’s river. northeast trepassey brook (netr in fig. 11) lies well above the regression. this river 218 is the smallest of the rivers examined (third order, and basin area of 21 km2). the other rivers are fourth order or bigger (mean basin area of rivers in fig. 11: 862.9 km2). northeast river placentia (nepl) had the highest proportion of spawning escapement, and is a relatively small system (basin area 94.0 km2). all other rivers shown had basin areas larger than 183 km2 (range of the remainder, 183.1–6398 km2). smaller streams are more pro- ductive per unit area than larger streams (hynes 1970). western arm brook (wab) lies partly on calcareous bedrock, and therefore is less acid than the other systems, and probably more productive for this reason. with indian bay brook (not included in the regression, since data were avail- able only for 3 years), the x point was somewhat lower than predicted, at 2.18 (y¼ 2.33; predicted value for the log percentage spawning target, x¼ 2.22). the system is healthy, but resident salmon (salmo_salar ouananiche) are abundant, and interactive competition may reduce produc- tion of the anadromous form. although the regression in fig. 11 suggests differing ‘a’ values (ricker 1975) of the stock–recruit relationships between rivers, and that lacustrine effects inﬂu- ence river production. similar effects of lakes may apply in other systems, although possibly of less consequence where rivers are relatively fertile, or where the lakes are in the lower part of the system. also, effects on salmonids may be negative in lowland lakes where piscivorous ﬁsh are present and prey on migrating smolt (rasmussen et al. 1996) or on brown_trout (degerman & sers 1994). habitats, growth and migration of juvenile atlantic salmon as has been similarly suggested by poff & huryn (1998), similar types of models, but more reﬁned to include other known controlling or indicative factors, such as temperature, water chemistry, gradient, type of substrate, hydrology, stream size, amounts of invertebrates, density- dependent growth of parr, species community, etc., could be used to more accurately predict required spawning escapement where stock- recruitment models were uncertain. also, as has been pointed out by bardonnet & baglinie` re (2000), an improved knowledge at large spatial scales is required if we are to describe and under- stand atlantic salmon habitat requirements across spatial scales. it is recognised that rivers of different productivity have different stock– recruitment relationships (e.g., symons 1979; egglishaw et al. 1984; potter 2000). although regulation of spawning stock escapement ideally should be stock speciﬁc for each river system, in practice long-term data are lacking to set such levels. to overcome this problem, in newfound- land, rivers are regulated by controlling effort related to the river, various retention levels being based on the proportion of ‘spawning target’ achieved in individual rivers, or similar rivers close to ‘index’ rivers (anonymous 1999b). where stocks are very low, as shown at the lower end of the plot in fig. 11, some of these rivers are closed, including the highlands river (hlds). habitat models could improve on advice to management. for example, in the habitat model of fig. 11, highlands river (hlds) ﬁts on the regression line, which suggests that present carrying capacity, at least for large parr, has been reached in the river so that increased egg deposition may not increase smolt output. some evidence for this hypothesis lies in that although the highlands river has been closed to angling since 1978, and spawning esca- pement has increased since closure of the com- mercial ﬁshery in 1992, smolt output has not increased since the counts made 20 years ago (table 1). similarly, sharma & hilborn (2001) related watershed characteristics to smolt abun- dance of coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch) and suggested that, contrary to general thought, streams were not spawner limited, but instead were probably limited by other factors. with the present limitations of freshwater habitat, major changes in adult returns can only be expected with changes in marine survival, which have been relatively low over the period shown in fig. 11 (reddin et al. 2000; anonymous 2001). further research in freshwater habitats will allow better models for categorising river sys- tems, and for regulating and conserving salmon stocks. table1. movements of salmon through the counting fence in the highlands river, s.w. newfoundland, canada downstream upstream year smolt kelt

los habitats requeridos por juveniles de salmo_salar, en general bien conocidos, pueden variar en calidad en relacio´ n a efectos de varias variables que interactu´ an y que pueden depender de diferentes partes del sistema ﬂuvial. se dan ejemplos de rangos de densidad y crecimientos que pueden ser encontrados en varias localidades del este de canada que ilustran los factores biologicos y ﬁsico-quimicos que afectan la produccio´ n de juveniles. tasas de crecimiento relativas pueden indicar calidad de habitats y densidades de poblaciones. 2. los juveniles de s. salar tienen effectos negativos sobre salvelinus_fontinalis en habitat de torrenteras. los efectos de migracio´ n dentro de un rio y de los cambios con la sucessio´ n del rı´ o sobre la produccio´ n de juveniles de s. salar se ilustran con ejemplos de un rio de terra nova. la migracio´ n de las clases de edad puede ser cuantiﬁcada a traves de curvas de ‘self-thinning’. los lagos tienen efectos positivos sobre los habitats ﬂuviales aguas abajo y, al menos, en terra nova y probablemente en muchas regiones boreales, la proporcio´ n lacustre de la cuenca puede ser utilizada como indice para derivar estimas de las escapadas reproductivas. los factores descritos deberian ser tomados en consideracio´ n para esti- mas mas reﬁnadas de la produccio´ n del rio y para la gestio´ n de los recursos salmonı´ colas.
