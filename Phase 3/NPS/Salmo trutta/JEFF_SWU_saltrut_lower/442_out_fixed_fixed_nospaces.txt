flows during this period were less than the historical average. when coupled with the historical evidence, these observations suggest that spawning coincides with increased river discharge. river regulation may inhibit spawning. key words: australian grayling;

jackson & koehn 1988), dentition (mcdowall 1974), the sensitivity of eggs and larvae to salinity (bacher & o'brien 1989) and diet (jackson 1976; bishop & bell 1978; berra et al. 1987). while there has been some in- vestigations into the species' life history (bishop & bell 1978; berra 1982, 1987; bacher & o'brien 1989; hall & harrington 1989), little is known of the 70 factors that in¯uence spawning and recruitment success, in particular, the relationship between the river discharge and the spawning events. to investigate the spawning requirements of this species, the reproductive status of a popula- tion of australian grayling in the barwon river, south-eastern australia, along with potential spawning cues, was monitored over two consecu- tive spawning seasons. study area the barwon river ¯ows from its headwaters in the otway ranges near forrest in a north-easterly direction for about 100 km before entering bass strait at barwon heads. the forested headwaters of the barwon river give way to extensive agri- cultural pastureland in the middle reaches until ®nally, in the lower section, the river ¯ows through the urban and industrial areas of the city of geelong. the study site was located in the lower reaches of the river below the junction of the moorabool river (fig. 1). the study site was typically (under normal ¯ow conditions) slow- ¯owing, having an average width of approximately 30 m and an average depth of approximately 2 m. the barwon river system is highly regulated ovarian involution in the australian grayling table1. spawning status of fish collected from barwon river 1997 and 1998. 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 sampling date 14-5-97 females not involuting 1mature 2-6-97 16-6-97 24-6-97 2-7-97 8-7-97 22-7-97 6-8-97 23-5-98 23-7-98 5-8-98 12-8-98 2 mature 6 mature 1mature 0 0 2 mature 0 1mature 0 0 0 females involuting 0 0 0 1 1 3 2 1 0 5 4 6 dicted natural ¯ow (no regulation) as opposed to actual ¯ow (regulation). results fish condition during 1997, a total of 20 females were examined for spawning condition. females were ®rst observed to be undertaking ovarian involution on the 24th june. eleven females were sampled on or after 24th june, of which eight (73%) were undergoing ovarian involution (table 1). during 1998, a total of 16 females were exam- ined for spawning condition. ovarian involution was ®rst observed on the 23rd july after which 15 females were sampled, all of which were under- going ovarian involution (table 1). at the early stages of ovarian involution, eggs appeared to have shrunk in diameter, while others appeared dead. as involution progressed, the entire egg mass became a `mush' in a partially digested state, whereby individual eggs could not be distinguished. at the latter stages of involu- tion, fat bodies were formed within the abdominal cavity, presumably as a result of the involution. a more detailed description of ovarian involution can be found in zuckerman & weir (1977). water temperature in the 1997 study period, water temperature was at a maximum recorded high (12.98c) on 14th may and low (7.78c) on the 23rd july. in 1998, the maximum recorded water temperature was 12.68c on the 13th may, while a low temperature (7.78c) was recorded on the 18th of july. water 71 fig. 1. geographical location of the study area in the barwon river below its junction with the moorabool river. having a number of impoundments in headwater reaches and many private diversions along its length. materials and methods the study was conducted in 1997 and 1998. mon- itoring of ®sh, between april and august, corres- ponded to the months leading up to and includ- ing the spawning season (bishop & bell 1978; berra 1982, 1987; bacher & o'brien 1989; hall & harrington 1989). fish were collected during the evening hours (16:00±19:00 hours), using three mesh nets, 25 m long, with diagonal stretch-mesh of 25, 37.5 and 50 mm. the nets were checked every half an hour. samples of the female australian grayling were assessed for maturity stage, according to the categories described by pollard (1972). water temperature was monitored on an hourly basis using an automated data logger. daily river discharge data were obtained from the barwon region water authority. the effect of regulation on the ¯ow regime at the barwon river study site was elucidated from a model located at connes lane (fig. 1), obtained from the local water authority. this model pre- o'connor & mahoney fig. 2. daily river discharge in the bar- won river for 1997, 1998 and the 18 years average daily river discharge for the months of april through august at the mcintyre bridge gauging station. observed by hall & harrington (1989), when spent australian grayling were sampled in the barwon river in 1986 and 1987. however, in both years of the present study, the river discharge was below average, and while there were some small increases in the river discharge that had duration similar to that of the increases observed by hall & harrington (1989), the magnitude of these increases was different. this historical data, in conjunction with the current study, indicate that spawning may be associated with an increase in river discharge. fish were observed undergoing ovarian involu- tion in late june 1997 and in late july 1998. given that potential cues such as water temperature are met, it appears that the onset of ovarian involu- tion may occur in the barwon river before the end of july in the absence of the appropriate increase in the river discharge. the process of ovarian involution described here has not been reported for australian grayling before. similar strategies have been reported for golden perch, macquaria ambigua (lake 1967; mackay 1973), and australian bass, m. novema- culeata (harris 1986), where ovarian involution has been associated with low river discharge, producing unfavourable spawning conditions. these results suggest that the loss of large percentages of ¯ow to river regulation may contri- bute to reduced spawning in australian grayling. resumen 1. prototroctes mareana es una especie endeâ mica de las cuencas costeras del sudeste de australia que se encuentra amenazada. poco se sabe sobre los factores que in¯uyen la puesta y en el eâ xito reproductivo y, en particular, sobre las relaciones entre el caudal de los rios y la reproduccioâ n. por ello, durante dos anä os consecutivos, evaluamos el status y las condiciones reproductivas de la poblacioâ n del rio barwon. 2. en ambos anä os, una gran proporcioâ n de las hembras muestreadas sufrioâ involucioâ n ovaâ rica. en ambos anä os, la temperature did not exceed beyond 128c after late may in either year of the study. river discharge in both years of the study, there were small increases in the river discharge before the onset of ovarian involution; however, these increases were below the average daily river discharge for these months of the year (fig. 2). regulation as a result of regulation, the actual river discharge was often lower than the natural river discharge during both years of the study. for example, on the 23rd june 1998, 44% of the potential ¯ow at the study site was lost to regulation so that only 250 ml/day reached the study site instead of the 450 ml/day that was predicted by the model. discussion no spawning was observed and a large propor- tion of sampled female australian grayling under- went ovarian involution in the two consecutive years of study. previous research on australian grayling has indicated that spawning is associated with a drop in water temperature to around 138c (berra 1982, 1987; hall & harrington 1989), while hall & harrington (1989) suggested that spawning in the barwon river may also be associated with a recent high-¯ow event. jackson (unpublished data, from jackson & koehn 1988) believed that australian grayling reached a stage of maturity, close to spawning, but did not spawn until con- ditions were suitable, possibly when water levels rose. in the present study, the range and timing of changes in water temperature was similar to that 72 temperatura del agua estuvo dentro de los rangos sobre los que previamente se ha observado a la especie reproducirse. sin embargo, el caudal fueâ inferior al caudal diario medio esperado para esta eâ poca del anä o. 3. el examen de un modelo predictivo de condiciones de caudal no regulado indicoâ que la regulacioâ n del rõâ o podrõâ a contribuir a una menor reproduccioâ n. acknowledgements a number of staff from the arthur rylah institute contrib- uted to the ®eldwork, including peter fairbrother, terry glenane, louise grgat, des harrington and damien o'mahony. tarmo raadik provided much appreciated sup- port in his role as project supervisor. paul close, pam clunie and bill o'connor provided comments on the ®nal manu- script. numerous regional staff of the department of nat- ural resources and environment, parks 5ictoria and barwon water are thanked for their co-operation. references bacher, g.j. & o'brien, t.a. 1989. salinity tolerance of the eggs and larvae of the australian grayling, prototroctes mareana gunther (salmoniformes: prototroctidae). aus- tralian journal of marine and freshwater research 40: 227±230. bell, j.d., berra, t.m., jackson, p.d., last, p.r. & sloane, r.d. 1980. recent records of the australian grayling prototroctes mareana gunther (pisces: prototroctidae) with notes on its distribution. australian zoologist 20 (3): 419±431. berra, t.m. 1982. life history of the australian grayling, prototroctes mareana (salmoniformes: prototroctidae) in the tambo river, victoria. copeia 4: 795±805. berra, t.m. 1987. speculations on the evolution of life the australian grayling. american history tactics of fisheries society symposium 1: 519±530. berra, t.m., campbell, a. & jackson, p.d. 1987. diet of the australian grayling, prototroctes mareana gunther (salmoniformes: prototroctidae), with notes on the occurrence of a trematode parasite and black peritoneum. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 38 (5): 661±669. ovarian involution in the australian grayling bishop, k.a. & bell, j.d. 1978. aspects of the biology of the australian grayling prototroctes mareana gunther (pisces: prototroctidae). australian journal of marine and freshwater research 29 (6): 743±761. hall, d.n. & harrington, d.j. 1989. studies on the spawning and early life history of australian grayling prototroctes mareana gunther, in the barwon river, victoria. arthur rylah institute for environmental research technical report series no. 84, melbourne: department of conservation, forests and lands, 31 p. harris, j.h. 1986. reproduction of the australian bass, macquaria novemaculeata (perciformes: percichthyidae) in the sydney basin. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 37: 209±235. jackson, p.d. 1976. a note on the food of the australian grayling, prototroctes mareana gunther (galaxiodei: prototroctidae). australian journal of marine and fresh- water research 27 (3): 525±528. jackson, p.d. & koehn, j.d. 1988. a review of biological information, distribution and status of the australian grayling (prototroctes mareana) gunther in victoria. arthur rylah institute for environmental research technical report 52: 1±20. lake, j.s. 1967. rearing experiments with five species of australian freshwater fishes. part i. inducement to spawning. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 18: 137±153. mackay, n.j. 1973. histological changes in the ovaries of the golden perch, plectroplites ambiguus, associated with the reproductive cycle. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 24: 95±101. mcdowall, r.m. 1974. specialisation in the dentition of the southern graylings-genus prototroctes (galaxiodei: pro- totroctidae). journal of fish biology 6 (2): 209±213. mcdowall, r.m. 1976. fishes of the family prototroctidae. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 27 (4): 641±659. mcdowall, r.m. 1996. freshwater fishes of south-eastern australia. revised edition.
