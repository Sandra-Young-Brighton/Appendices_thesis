bell 1988). this structure protects stickleback from vertebrate predators by increasing diameter and resisting compression from the predator’s jaws (hoogland et al. 1957; hagen & gilbertson 1972; moodie 1972; gross 1978; reimchen 1983, 1991, 1994; bell 1988; lescak & von hippel 2011). oce- anic (marine and anadromous) threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) have robust pelvic girdles containing all four elements on each side. pelvic girdle reduction (decrease in size or number of ele- ments) has evolved rapidly and independently in many resident found in recently deglaciated regions (bell 1987, 1988). popu- lations that have evolved pelvic reduction are typi- cally found in habitats with low dissolved ion concentration, a lack of piscivorous ﬁshes and abun- dant macroinvertebrate predators (giles 1983; bell freshwater populations correspondence: emily a. lescak, department of biological sciences, university of alaska anchorage, 3211 providence dr., anchorage, ak 99508, usa. e-mail: elescak@alaska.edu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00579.x 581 including 1988). the relative contributions of water chemistry and macroinvertebrate predation to the evolution of pelvic reduction in lakes lacking piscivorous ﬁshes are unknown. the association between pelvic reduc- tion and the presence of macroinvertebrates has led to speculation about whether possession of a com- plete pelvic girdle may be disadvantageous in avoid- ing macroinvertebrate predation. reimchen (1980) conducted laboratory experiments to determine effects of stickleback size and pelvic spine length on susceptibility to predation by dragon- ﬂy naiads (genus aeshna). results demonstrated that naiads have a strong tendency to prey upon juvenile stickleback over adults. he suggested that the presence of spines could be disadvantageous to ﬁsh because they provide extensions upon which naiads can grasp to facilitate capture and manipulation. however, he found no signiﬁcant differences in mortality rates between long-spined versus short-spined phenotypes. marchinko (2009) also conducted predation experi- ments with juvenile stickleback using several types of macroinvertebrate dragonﬂy predators, lescak et al. naiads, and found juveniles with robust pelvic development to be most susceptible to predation. morphological analyses have also been used to determine which pelvic phenotypes may be most sus- ceptible to macroinvertebrate predators. reimchen & nosil (2002) found that juvenile cohorts tend to exhi- bit the full complement of spines during winter months when predation by vertebrates predominates, while they have fewer spines, on average, during summer months when macroinvertebrate predators are abundant. reduction in spine number during sum- mer months was attributed to predation by macroin- vertebrates. similar experiments have been conducted using brook stickleback (culaea inconstans) and ninespine stickleback (pungitius pungitius). in reist’s (1980) experiment using brook stickleback with and without pelvic girdles, naiads demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher rates of predation on ﬁsh lacking pelvic girdles trials, but no phenotype-dependent in one set of differential consumption in another set of trials. ziuganov & zotin (1995) found that macroinverte- brates, including dragonﬂy naiads, had a propensity to prey upon ninespine stickleback with complete pelvic girdles in an experimental pond. overall, experimental results seem inconclusive as to whether macroinvertebrate predators demonstrate differential consumption of stickleback with a partic- ular pelvic phenotype. in addition, reimchen’s (1980) work was the only study to address behaviour of naiads. the purposes of this study are to determine whether dragonﬂy naiads demonstrate differential consumption of threespine stickleback with highly reduced or complete pelvic girdles and to investigate potential differences in capture and manipulation strategies when naiads prey upon individuals with divergent pelvic phenotypes. materials and methods study populations stickleback were collected from wallace lake (61˚34′27·9″n, 149˚34′27·3″w), located in the mata- nuska-susitna valley in south-central alaska, in april–september 2009 and may–july 2010. fish were trapped in unbaited, 0·32 and 0·64-cm mesh minnow traps set near shore and left overnight. fish were brought to the university of alaska anchorage, where they were grouped according to pelvic score (ps). pelvic armour structure was quantiﬁed using the following scoring system developed by bell et al. (1993): 4, all pelvic elements present; 3, only pelvic spine and ﬁn ray absent; 2, pelvic spine and posterior process absent (anterior process and ascending branch remain); 1, only anterior process present; and 0, all 582 elements absent. each side of the pelvic structure was scored separately, and the two scores were added together to obtain the individual’s ps (possible score ranges from 0 to 8). stickleback were housed in 379- l covered, outdoor tanks in dechlorinated tap water. stickleback were fed brine shrimp daily before being used in experiments. the amount of time spent in captivity before use in a predation trial varied from 1 day to several months. dragonﬂy naiads, aeshna spp., were collected as bycatch in minnow traps set out for stickleback in wallace lake and various other lakes and wetlands in the matanuska-susitna valley during the summers of 2009 and 2010. naiads were housed individually in plastic tanks (17·8 9 10·2 9 12·7 cm) with lids. the bottom of each tank was lined with gravel to provide traction for movement. each tank was ﬁlled halfway with dechlorinated tap water. arena trials nine arena trials were conducted in outdoor pools, from 6 june–5 august 2009. two additional trials were conducted in june 2010. each trial took place in a wading pool (140·8 cm in diameter), lined with gravel, ﬁlled to a depth of 4–5 cm with dechlorinated tap water (approximately 60 l) and covered with mesh. each trial contained twenty stickleback of known standard length (sl; anterior tip of upper jaw to posterior end of hypural plate) ranging from 23 to 57 mm. ten stickleback per trial had highly reduced pelvic girdles (ps 2), and ten had fully formed pelvic girdles (ps 8). six naiads were introduced to each pool, and pools were monitored daily. dead ﬁsh that had been preyed upon by naiads were removed. fish that died of natural causes (evidenced by lack of wounds; three per trial on average) were replaced with ﬁsh of the same ps and similar sl. the goal was to terminate trials when ten stickleback had been consumed, but for ﬁve trials, the naiads consumed between 11 and 13 ﬁsh. surviving ﬁsh were scored for pelvic phenotype and sl. a chi-square test was used to compare the frequen- cies of surviving ps 2 versus ps 8 individuals per trial. the number of ps 8 survivors was correlated with trial length using the spearman rank correlation (because of small sample size) to determine whether a relationship existed between length of trial and phe- notype of survivors. the mean sl of ps 2 versus ps 8 survivors of each trial was compared using wilco- xon signed rank tests. video trials ninety-six video trials were conducted using 32 dragonﬂy naiads. fifty-eight of these resulted in successful capture of prey, while the naiad did not capture prey in the remaining 38 trials. twenty-three naiads had one successful capture of a ﬁsh ﬁlmed, and the other nine had multiple captures ﬁlmed (three to four, to look for consistency in prey). trials took place 9 june–8 december 2009 and 14 july–3 sep- tember 2010. all trials were conducted indoors at room temperature. a to two introduced ﬁsh were each trial consisted of two stickleback of similar sl, one with a ps of two and one with a ps of eight. the tank (17·8 9 10·2 9 12·7 cm) ﬁlled to a depth of 4–5 cm with dechlorinated tap water and lined with gravel. once the ﬁsh had acclimated (3–5 min, as evidenced by normal swimming behaviour), a naiad was intro- duced. interactions between the naiad and ﬁsh were ﬁlmed for 1 h using a sony digital 8 video recorder (made in japan) set to slow play. after each trial, the length of the naiad (ln) was measured, and the ps of the captured and non-captured ﬁsh were noted. if no ﬁsh was captured after 1 h, the trial was terminated and not included in analysis. films were analysed by measuring parameters associated with predation events. we recorded the region of the stickleback’s body grasped by the naiad during capture and whether the ﬁsh was able to escape postcapture. the latencies (amount of time that lapsed from the beginning of the trial) to strike and capture, the hunting strategy (categorised as sit and wait versus stalk) and whether the naiad used its legs to grapple with the ﬁsh as a means of controlling it were also recorded. capture events were those in which the naiad struck at the ﬁsh and was able to hold it in its jaws. chi-square tests were performed to compare the number of ps 2 and ps 8 individuals that were preyed upon. paired t-tests were used to compare the sl of introduced (sli) and captured ps 2 and ps 8 individuals. independent samples t-tests were used to compare latencies to strike and capture and length of time between initial strike and capture for each pelvic phenotype. the difference between ln and length of captured prey (slc) was calculated to determine upper and lower limits of prey size. the difference in ln and slc for ps 2 and ps 8 stickleback was com- pared using independent samples t-tests to determine whether size of the prey relative to the predator dif- fered signiﬁcantly owing to ps. ln was regressed against slc separately for ps 2 and ps 8 stickleback as well as for both phenotypes combined to deter- mine whether prey size increased with predator size. for naiads that were ﬁlmed multiple times, only data from the ﬁrst trial were used in the above analyses. additionally, latencies to strike and capture were regressed against trial number to determine whether the naiads became more efﬁcient these naiads, for predation of stickleback by naiads

8 stickleback did not signiﬁcantly differ in sl (xps 2 = 36·1 mm, xps 8 = 35·0 mm; paired t-test: t10 = 1·21; p = 0·25). captured ps 2 and ps 8 individuals also did not signiﬁcantly differ in sl (xps 2 = 36·1 mm, xps 8 = 34·4 mm; paired t-test: t10 = 1·71; p = 0·12). the correlation between trial length and number of ps 8 survivors was signiﬁcant (spearman rank correlation: ρ = 0·69, p =

ps 2 individuals were larger than the naiad, and captured ps 8 individuals were smaller than the naiad (table 1, fig. 3). the overall upper limit of prey size (difference in size between the naiad and largest captured ﬁsh) was +10 mm for ps 2 prey and +5 mm for ps 8 prey. the lower limit (difference in size between the naiad and smallest captured ﬁsh) was  18 mm (both phenotypes; table 1). there

analysed statistically because of small sample sizes. however, emerged (table 2). naiads appeared more likely to stalk and wrap their legs around (grapple with) ps 2 than ps 8 individuals. about half of the naiads that preyed upon ps 8 ﬁsh latched onto the pelvis, and almost half that preyed upon ps 2 ﬁsh latched onto the head. the highest frequencies of escape for both pheno- types occurred when naiads held the ﬁsh by the tail. patterns nine naiads were observed in multiple trials in which they captured prey (table 3). five of these individuals captured stickleback of the same pheno- type in every trial. of these, four captured ps 2 ﬁsh in every trial. the latency between strike and capture on the ﬁrst versus the second trial did not vary signif- icantly (w = 49, p = 0·393). discussion the purpose of this study was to determine whether dragonﬂy naiads demonstrate differential consump- tion of stickleback with reduced or complete pelvic girdles. results of arena trials suggest a tendency towards predation of ps 2 ﬁsh (p = 0·07, fig. 1), contrary to the prediction (reimchen 1980) that naiads can more easily capture stickleback with pel- vic spines. however, the number of ps 8 survivors increased with increasing trial length (fig. 2), indicat- ing that the trend of predation of ps 2 ﬁsh could be an artefact of trial length. future studies that stan- dardise trial length could test this hypothesis. ln was not signiﬁcantly correlated with trial length, which implies that predator size does not factor into length of time required to capture and consume prey. results from video trials reveal that naiads preyed more heavily upon ps 2 individuals that were larger than themselves and ps 8 individuals smaller than themselves (table 1, fig. 3). this ﬁnding supports previous research that juvenile stickleback with com- plete pelvic girdles are at heightened susceptibility to macroinvertebrate predators (reimchen & nosil 2002; marchinko 2009). our study shows that preda- tion by naiads continues into the adult size class, table 1. mean standard length (sl) of introduced (sli) and captured (slc) stickleback, mean difference in stickleback sl relative to naiad

without pelvic spines may have demo- graphic consequences, particularly if the smaller ﬁsh with spines are likely to be eaten before they repro- duce. this may select for faster maturation in juve- niles with complete pelvic girdles, or pelvic reduction, because survival is greater for stickleback with reduced pelvises prior to reproduction. reimchen (1980) suggested that stickleback with pelvic spines may be at a disadvantage when faced with macroinvertebrate predators because the spines could be used to facilitate capture and manipulation. if this is the case, then it implies that one of two sce- narios is taking place: either (i) macroinvertebrates are able to discern visually which prey have spines and which do not and select accordingly, or (ii) equal numbers of stickleback with and without pelvic spines are captured but stickleback without spines have greater escape success. aeschnids are primarily visual predators (pritchard 1965), but the results from these experiments do not suggest that naiads, on average, are visually selecting stickleback with pelvic spines over those without. arena results suggest a tendency towards the oppo- site, with more ps 8 ﬁsh surviving than ps 2 ﬁsh predation of stickleback by naiads (fig. 1). results from multiple video trials conducted with the same individual naiads suggest that naiads repeatedly prey upon stickleback with the same pel- vic phenotype, which would be facilitated by visual identiﬁcation of ps. if these results are conﬁrmed by additional trials, then it suggests that differential con- sumption of prey with a particular pelvic phenotype varies among individuals. naiads were observed grappling with ps 2 individ- uals more often than with ps 8 individuals (table 2), so it appears that the spines are not often used by the legs of the naiad to facilitate control. conversely, grappling may be more important with ps 2 ﬁsh of large size. stickleback had the greatest likelihood of escape when captured at the tail, but there did not appear to be differential success at escaping because of ps (table 2). only six instances of escape by the stickleback were recorded in the video trials, three of each phenotype, of 58 capture events. similarly, reimchen’s (1980) work revealed only two escapes out of 80 capture events. as a result, we are limited in our interpretation of capture and manipulation behaviour. vermeij (1982) posited that it is the failed attempt at capture that drives the evolution of prey defences. as odonates appear to be highly efﬁcient predators, an exceptionally large number of trials would be required to statistically verify differential predation of stickleback with varying pelvic pheno- types. naiads may be adjusting their hunting strategies based on prey phenotype, because they appeared more likely to stalk a ps 2 individual than a ps 8 individual (table 2). naiads in this study may have preyed more heavily upon large ps 2 stickleback if the pelvic girdle acts as a deterrent to predation, rather than an asset to the predator. the pelvic girdle may deter naiads when it is large enough to be a hin- drance and may make the ﬁsh appear too large to prey upon. susceptibility to predation may also be an effect of prey behaviour if stickleback with complete pelvic girdles exhibit different behavioural strategies than those with pelvic reduction. for example, grand (2000) found that stickleback with complete pelvic girdles from paxton lake, british columbia, were table 2. differences in hunting and capture strategies and frequencies of escape. hunting

research could employ naiad predators, rather than ﬁsh predators, in shy-bold experiments to test this possibility. it was not possible to track the behaviour of the ﬁsh in the current study because they were not individually marked. stickleback with phenotypes occupy different foraging microhabitats in boulton lake, british columbia; pelvic-reduced individuals are more benthic in their foraging behaviour (reim- chen 1980, 1997; reimchen & nosil 2001, 2002). it is currently unknown whether alaskan populations are similar in this regard, but if they are, then higher attack rates on pelvic-reduced stickleback may be a result of spatial susceptibility. this factor was con- trolled for in our experiments because water depth in the arena and video trials was shallow (4–5 cm), which conﬁned stickleback to the substrate. pelvic availability of refuge (leinonen et al. 2011) and lateral plate number (moodie & reimchen 1976; re- imchen 2000) may also inﬂuence susceptibility to predation. refuge was not included as a factor in the present study because we wanted to focus on the role of the pelvic girdle in predation and did not want our view of predator–prey interactions to be obscured by objects in the tank. lateral plate number was not con- sidered because the wallace lake population is uni- formly low plated (lescak 2010) and lateral plate number did not differ between ps 2 and ps 8 ﬁsh in a previous study (lescak & von hippel 2011). differential predation by macroinvertebrate preda- tors on various size classes of different pelvic pheno- types may interact with energetic expenses associated with ion availability in lakes (giles 1983) to result in pelvic girdle reduction. additional studies with other macroinvertebrate predators [e.g., leeches (hirudi- nea), predaceous diving beetles (coleoptera)] and 586 lescak, e.a. 2010. selection for threespine stickleback armor phenotypes in wallace lake, alaska. m.s thesis. anchor- age, alaska: university of
