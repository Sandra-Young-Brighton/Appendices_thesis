humphries et al. 1999; thoms & sheldon 2000). fish populations may respond to variation in river ﬂows, including ﬂoods and droughts, by moving between habitats and spawning and recruiting over a wide range of ﬂow conditions (bishop et al. 1995; mallen-cooper 1999; balcombe et al. 2006). however, improved management of regulated ﬂow regimes will be critical to the long- term maintenance of ﬁshes adapted for rivers with natural ﬂow regimes classiﬁed as among the most variable in the world (walker 1985; thoms & sheldon 2000; pusey et al. 2004). golden perch, macquaria ambigua percichthyidae (richardson), is one australian freshwater ﬁsh species with ﬂexible spawning strategies adapted for naturally variable river ﬂows. the species is relatively long lived and has been recorded up to 26 years old (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003), but is more com- monly 10 years old and up to 60 cm long and <5 kg in weight (anderson et al. 1992a; mcdowall 1996). golden perch are highly fecund and the semi-buoyant eggs from a single 2.2 kg female can number up to 500,000 (mcdowall 1996). in early pond experiments, spawning was associated with water temperatures above 23 °c and ﬂooding of dry ground (lake 1967). this spawning model was generally consistent with doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00308.x 577 roberts et al. the ‘ﬂood pulse concept’ in which summer inundated ﬂoodplains provide suitable spawning conditions for ﬁsh and these inundated habitats then provide suitable feeding grounds for larvae (junk et al. 1989). early studies also added further evidence of ﬂood-mediated recruitment for golden perch (mackay 1973; reynolds 1983; harris & gehrke 1994). recently, studies on golden perch within temperate rivers of the southern murray–darling basin system have provided evidence that golden perch have a much more ﬂexible breeding strategy with spawning and recruitment occurring during both ﬂood conditions and rising winter ⁄ spring ﬂows contained within the river banks (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003; king et al. 2005; balcombe et al. 2006; stuart & jones 2006). additionally, the southern populations of golden perch appear to spawn at much lower water temperatures than previously document by lake (1967) at approx- imately 19 °c (king et al. 2005; stuart & jones 2006). it is increasingly apparent that for golden perch, the inﬂuence of river ﬂow and temperature on recruitment is highly variable, with ﬁsh displaying opportunistic spawning behaviour and recruitment variation across the geographic distribution of the species. the fitzroy basin in central queensland (fig. 1) is the northern most natural distribution of the golden perch in australia with other natural populations occurring in the murray–darling, lake eyre and bulloo river systems (mcdowall 1996; pusey et al. 2004). golden perch from the fitzroy catchment represent a genetically and morphologically distinct sub-species, m. ambigua oriens (musyl & keenan 1992) and they are distributed widely throughout the sub-catchments (long & berghuis 1999); however, in contrast to southern populations, relatively little is known of their biology (pusey et al. 2004). riverine impoundments and changes to natural ﬂow regimes often exert negative pressures on ﬁsh popula- tions including reductions in water quality, habitat loss, inhibited migration, alteration of spawning triggers, reduction in average river ﬂow volumes and changes to the timing and periodicity of ﬂows (cadwallader 1978; walker 1985; faragher & harris 1994; maheshwari et al. 1995). given the variability in rainfall and environmental conditions across the fitzroy basin, variable recruitment patterns in golden perch were likely a natural feature of the basin. the degree to which recruitment patterns have changed as a result of anthropogenic ﬂow regulation, changes to natural ﬂow patterns and other factors, such as raised turbidity levels, toxicants and artiﬁcial ﬁsh stocking, are unknown. in the fitzroy basin, the management of regulated ﬂow regimes is currently being reviewed and an improved understanding of the breeding biology of golden perch and the inﬂuence of river ﬂow, the degree of river regulation and water temperature, may be important factors in water management planning. for some ﬁsh, such as barramundi (lates calcarifer), ﬂooding in the fitzroy river estuary is an important prerequisite for strong recruitment (staunton-smith et al. 2005). however, for freshwater ﬁsh inhabiting this large semi-arid tropical river, the patterns of recruitment and ﬂooding are less clear and this represents an important management objective. connors river pacific ocean isaac river tropic of capricorn fairbairn dam bedford weir mackenzie river eden bann weir fitzroy river rockhampton raymond stn nogoa river comet river don river moura weir theodore weir 0 50 100 kilometres fish sampling locations dawson river glebe weir taroom (widewater) fig.1. location of the fitzroy river basin, queensland, australia, indicating major sub-basins and ﬁsh sampling sites. 578 this study examined the age distribution of golden perch from four major rivers in the fitzroy basin to investigate the effect of variability in river ﬂow, seasonal water temperature and the degree of river regulation on recruitment patterns. materials and methods study location the fitzroy basin is the largest drainage system on the east coast of australia occupying an area of 142,645 km2 spanning the tropic of capricorn, with a tropical, semi-arid climate (noble et al. 1997). of all the australian east coast rivers, the fitzroy discharges the second largest mean annual volume of 6.08 km3 (furnas & mitchell 2001). there are six major sub- catchments in the fitzroy basin; the connors ⁄ isaac, nogoa, comet, mackenzie, dawson and fitzroy rivers (fig. 1). these rivers are characterised by extensive ﬂoodplains, often with many anabranches. the longest tributary, the dawson river, ﬂows for 483 km from the source in the carnarvon range to the conﬂuence with the mackenzie river to form the fitzroy river which ﬂows an additional 480 km to the river mouth at keppel bay in the coral sea. the )1 river gradient is relatively low at only 0.26 mækm and there is high turbidity (kelly & wong 1996). rainfall and ﬂow in the fitzroy river and its tributaries are highly variable and subject to periodic monsoonal ﬂoods in 25 days in 1991); however, there are extended periods of low to zero ﬂow in winter and rivers regularly dry up into a series of pools (connell et al. 1981; o’neil et al. 1992). (18.5 · 106 ml in summer the fitzroy basin is highly regulated with 15 impoundments with a total combined storage capacity of 1.67 · 106 ml (department of natural resources 1998) with the largest being fairbairn dam on the nogoa river. a number of additional large dams have been proposed for the comet and dawson rivers. the mackenzie and lower dawson rivers are the most regulated reaches which have led to a reduction in the frequency and total volume of low and medium ﬂows in the system (department of natural resources 1998). the isaac and connors rivers in the north of the catchment are currently unregulated. fitzroy river golden perch golden perch were collected from eight locations within the fitzroy, dawson, mckenzie and nogoa rivers (fig. 1) between august 1996 and may 1997. fish were caught using single- and multi-panel gill nets (50, 100, 150 mm stretched mesh) and single wing fyke nets (25 mm stretched mesh). nets were set recruitment patterns of golden perch in a variety of habitat types including deep pools and shallow runs in an effort to sample a wide size range of ﬁsh. traps on ﬁshways on the lower fitzroy river and angling supplemented samples, at eden bann weir (stuart et al. 2007) and at the fitzroy tidal barrage (stuart & mallen-cooper 1999). all ﬁsh were mea- sured for total length (tl), weighed (g) and the stage of gonad maturation noted. ageing technique the use of sectioned otoliths to age golden perch has been validated for golden perch up to a maximum of 22 years with known age stocked specimens (ander- son et al. 1992a; stuart 2006). in the present study, sagittal otoliths were dissected from specimens and a section approximately 0.5 mm thick was cut through the core along the dorso-ventral plane of the left otolith using a buehler isomet low-speed cutting saw. sections were mounted on a microscope slide and examined under a dissecting microscope using reﬂected light against a black background to highlight the pattern of opaque zones (annuli). sectioned otoliths were read on two separate occasions and to reduce reader bias, the identiﬁcation of each otolith was obscured during both age estimations. estimation of the ageing precision was calculated using the index of average percentage error (iape) method (beamish & fournier 1981). to conﬁrm the annual formation of annulus marks, the fitzroy river samples were used to measure the timing of the annulus formation for a range of ﬁsh ages collected in the lower catchment at the eden bann weir collection site each month between august 1996 and january 1997. a quali- tative score for the outermost annulus and otolith margin was employed to assign a nominal birthday for golden perch from the fitzroy basin. as per convention, the estimated ages were corrected to the nominal birth date to ensure all ﬁsh hatched in the same spring ⁄ summer spawning period were counted among the corresponding age class group (anderson et al. 1992b). the nominal birth date was deter- mined as the month in which the greatest proportion of samples showed a new annulus forming on the otolith margin. these qualitative scores included: forming (f) when a new annulus mark had com- menced forming around the otolith margin; new (n) when a complete marginal annulus was observable but was <25% of the width of the previous hyaline zone; plus (p) when a complete marginal annulus was observable but was <75% of the width of the previous hyaline zone and due (d) when a hyaline zone on the leading edge of the otolith was >75% of the previous hyaline zone width with no marginal annulus forming. 579 roberts et al. river ﬂow, water temperature and artiﬁcial stocking river ﬂow and water temperature data for each of the rivers studied were obtained from the queensland department of natural resources and water (dnrw). the data were sourced from the ofﬁcial dnrw gauging station located closest to the ﬁsh sampling sites. in an effort to assess the likely effect of artiﬁcial stocking of ﬁngerlings on the golden perch population, stocking numbers were sourced from the department of primary industries. statistical analyses pearson correlation coefﬁcients were determined between the number of ﬁsh observed in each age class and a range of river ﬂow statistics including the total monthly, annual, winter (june–august), spring (sep- tember–november), summer (december–february), autumn (march–may) and wet season (september– february) periods for each of the four rivers. in addition to these ﬂow statistics derived from delineations of the calendar year, three additional total ﬂow statistics were calculated to represent ﬂows where water temperature might inﬂuence the number of ﬁsh observed in each age class. these included the total ﬂow for all months in which the average monthly temperatures exceeded 21, 23 and 25 °c, respectively. correlations were deter- mined using spss graduate pack 13.0, 2004. regres- sion equations were then calculated for the largest positive correlations for each river to assess how well the regression explained the relationship between age frequency and river ﬂow. the river ﬂow data used for the analyses of the spring period were from the months preceding the theoretical birth date and for summer, autumn and winter periods, following the birth date. to assess the overall trend between age class strength and river ﬂow from all rivers combined, the ﬂow data for the period chosen in each river was standardised by dividing the total ﬂow by the median ﬂow values for the corresponding period (bonvechio & allen 2005) and correlation and regression analysis were performed. in the present study, the collection of small 1 year old golden perch was possibly affected by a combi- nation of sampling equipment and habitat biases. speciﬁcally the gill net mesh sizes used would have been ineffective for collecting small golden perch and the fyke nets typically require ﬁsh to be actively moving. additionally, the chances of collecting the less abundant older ﬁsh were greatest in the fitzroy river where there were more potential sample days because ﬁsh were available from a seven month ﬁshway assessment at eden bann weir (stuart et al. 2007). hence to limit potential bias, the data analyses were restricted to age classes 2–12 for the fitzroy and 2–9 for the remaining rivers. the 9 year age class was 580 chosen as the upper limit for group analysis as these ages were represented in the nogoa, dawson and mackenzie river samples where there were similar habitat types sampled. the absence of an age class in the data was retained in the analysis as we assumed these represented poor or failed recruitment events rather than inadequate ﬁeld sampling. assumptions of the linear regression model were assessed before analysis for ﬂow and age frequency data. in the case of river ﬂow data, log transformation (x + 1) was used to address the skewed nature of the data prior to analyses. a von bertalanffy growth function was used to analyse the age at length data using the nlin procedure of statistical analysis system (sas). comparisons of von bertalanffy growth functions among rivers were performed using the analysis of the residual sum of squares (arss) method (chen et al. 1992). results ageing errors and birth date determination the thin-sectioned otoliths had clearly discernible patterns of opaque and hyaline zones when viewed under a microscope using reﬂected light and there was a high precision (iape 2.9% error) of age estimates between the two readers. examination of the otolith margin revealed the percentage of ﬁsh forming a new annulus was greatest in the months of spring (sep- tember and october) with a small proportion of ﬁsh forming a new annulus in august and november (fig. 2). no golden perch was recorded forming an 100  h s i f f o e g a t n e c r e p 80 60 40 20 0 10 35 8 11 3 5 r e b m e t p e s r e b o t c o r e b m e v o n r e b m e c e d y r a u n a

outer edge of the otolith in december or january, although the sample sizes were smaller. this indicated that the otolith banding patterns were annual and most often formed in spring. in determin- ing the nominal birth date, the percentage of ﬁsh with a new band forming was greatest in both september and october. as the september sample size was larger, the 1st of september was assigned as the theoretical birth date. age and growth otoliths from 182 golden perch, ranging in size from 163 to 511 mm tl were sectioned, including 72 ﬁsh from the fitzroy river, 54 ﬁsh from the nogoa river, 33 ﬁsh from the dawson river and 22 ﬁsh from the mackenzie river. table 1 provides the parameters of the von bertalanffy growth function and fig. 3 depicts the growth curves with 95% conﬁdence intervals shown for ﬁsh samples that converged to a maximum theoretical length estimate (l¥) following a maximum of 50 iterations of the nonlinear procedure in sas. the growth rate of golden perch for both males and females was highly variable as indicated by the difference in growth between the oldest estimated ﬁsh of 12 years old measuring 402 mm (tl), compared with a larger ﬁsh of 511 mm (tl) estimated to be 8 years old. no signiﬁcant differences were observed between the growth rate of all ﬁsh from the fitzroy and dawson rivers (p > 0.05, f = 0.98, d.f. = 3, 99; fig. 3a). in contrast, signiﬁcant differences in the growth rate were found between males from the fitzroy and nogoa rivers (p < 0.001, f = 12.35, d.f. = 3, 46; fig. 3b) and among females from the fitzroy, dawson and mackenzie rivers (p < 0.05, f = 2.57, d.f. = 6, 79) (fig. 3c). for all samples, based on a qualitative assessment of gonad stage, the minimum size and age at maturity was 173 mm tl recruitment patterns of golden perch and 2.3 years 5.1 years for females. for males, and 277 mm tl and year class strength figure 4 shows the differences in the dominant age classes observed between each of the four rivers. in the fitzroy river, the dominant age classes were 6 (32%) and 8 (29%) years old. the next most abundant age class (3 years old) comprised only 8% of the total sample. the sample from the nogoa river was dominated by the 4 (28%), 5 (24%) and 6 (22%) year old classes whereas the dawson and mackenzie rivers were dominated by the 3 year old age class (24% and 50%, respectively). there were also reasonable proportions of ﬁsh in age classes ﬁve and six in the dawson river and six in the mackenzie river. from these data, it is apparent that the 6 year old age class was consistently present in reasonably high frequencies across all rivers. however, the sample size for the dawson and mackenzie rivers was relatively smaller with 33 and 22 ﬁsh, respectively. in contrast to the other rivers, the nogoa river sample contained a higher proportion of 4-year old ﬁsh and a relatively high proportion of 5-year old ﬁsh compared with the fitzroy and mackenzie rivers and to a lesser degree the dawson river. this indicates that conditions conducive to recruitment of golden perch were present in those years corresponding to the 4- and 5-year old age classes in the nogoa river and less so for the remaining rivers. artiﬁcial stocking the number of artiﬁcially stocked golden perch ﬁngerlings varied considerably among sites and years ranging from 7000 to 42,000 in any 1 year. the only river not stocked was the nogoa river upstream of fairbairn dam. correlations between the number of table 1. golden perch von bertalanffy growth parameters (±se) and the minimum and maximum length and

however, only the fitzroy river results were signif- icant (p < 0.006 and 0.003, respectively). with the exception of the fitzroy river, all ﬂows occurring prior to november and after march were typically associated with negative or low correlations coefﬁ- cients (fig. 7). conversely correlations between november and march were largely positive with 14 out of the 20 possible correlation combinations being positive. out of the six negative correlations, four of those were from the nogoa river. the correlations between the total ﬂow values for months exceeding 21, 23 or 25 °c and age frequency, with the exception of the nogoa river, were all high 583 roberts et al. table 3. pearson correlation coefﬁcients between the numbers of golden perch observed in each age class and various river ﬂow statistics. river system flow period (log10 + 1) fitzroy river (n = 11) nogoa river (n = 8) dawson river (n = 8) mackenzie river (n = 8) annual (july–june) winter (june–august) spring (september–november) summer (december–february) autumn (march–may) wet season (september–february) months with average temperature > 21 °c months with average temperature > 23 °c months with average temperature > 25 °c 0.80 (0.001) 0.38 0.06 0.73 (0.006) 0.42 0.77 (0.003) 0.82 (0.001) 0.81 (0.001) 0.80 (0.002) )0.49 )0.31 )0.40 0.33 )0.67 0.12 )0.41 )0.24 )0.15 0.61 (0.054) )0.10 )0.32 0.61 (0.055) 0.39 0.55 0.68 (0.033) 0.74 (0.017) 0.75 (0.016) 0.41 )0.59 0.27 0.15 0.21 0.17 0.51 (0.09) 0.51 (0.09) 0.74 (0.018) signiﬁcance levels are shown in parentheses. note: age classes used included 2–12 for fitzroy river, 2–9 for nogoa, dawson and mackenzie rivers. t n e i c i f f e o c n o i t a  l e r r o c 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 –0.2 –0.4 –0.6 –0.8 –1.0 fitzroy rr nogoa rr dawson rr mackenzie rr jul aug sep oct nov dec jan month feb m ar apr m ay jun fig.7. monthly correlation coefﬁcients between age class fre- quency and monthly total ﬂow (ml) for each river sampled. and in seven out of nine cases were signiﬁcant (table 3). additionally, for the fitzroy, dawson and mackenzie rivers, the correlations between the total ﬂows occurring in months with average water tem- peratures signiﬁcant (r = 0.80, p < 0.002;

(r = 0.73, discussion ageing and general biology of golden perch the combination of high precision (97%) of age estimates using thin-sectioned otoliths in this study, the conﬁrmation of relatively discrete periodicity of the formation of annuli and previous validation studies from known age ﬁsh supports the use of annuli to accurately age golden perch (anderson et al. 1992a; stuart 2006). the present study conﬁrms the longevity of golden perch and highlights the variable growth and recruitment patterns which occur across the sub- catchments possibly reﬂecting the broad differences in temperature regimes, seasonal ﬂow patterns and habitat types (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003). lon- gevity, ﬂexible growth and opportunistic recruitment are likely adaptive traits for a river system with a hydrology classiﬁed among the most variable in the world with periods of long droughts interspersed with high magnitude summer monsoon ﬂooding (puckridge et al. 1998). the growth rate (k) and theoretical maximum size (l¥) of golden perch from the fitzroy river appeared slightly slower and smaller than that of southern temperate populations (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003) and the minimum size at ﬁrst maturity was also smaller, although the ages at maturity were similar to the temperate murray river population where males matured at 2–3 years and females at 4+ years (mallen- cooper & stuart 2003). it is a common assumption ) h s i f . o n (  y c n e u q e r f 25 20 15 10 5 0 y = 1.45x + 1.98 r 2 = 0.54, p = 0.000 r = 0.73, n = 26 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 standardised flow (total divided by

climates. however, the relationship between ﬁsh growth and temperature is highly variable (mcdo- wall 1994) suggesting there are few generalisations that can be drawn from ﬁsh growth and size based on geographical location alone (as a surrogate for temperature) and that a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors are likely to determine the growth and size characteristics of a population. higher water temperatures may actually result in reduced growth and body size due to the negative effect of reduced oxygen content in warmer water, combined with the increased metabolic activity with elevated body temperatures (atkinson 1995). as the fitzroy basin represents the northern most extent of the the growth natural distribution of golden perch, observed may reﬂect for somatic growth as previously suggested for other ﬁsh populations occurring at the extremities of their natural ranges (wilde & muoneke 2001). alternatively, other factors can also inﬂuence ﬁsh growth rates and maximum size including genetic differences in the species, habitat quality, food availability and quality, or competition (mcdowall 1994). the upper thermal limit in the fitzroy river system, as has been observed in other populations of golden perch (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003) females grew to a larger size and took 2 or 3 years longer than males to reach maturity. this sexual dimorphism could be related to the greater energetic requirements of females during the annual formation of gametes resulting in a delay in the onset of maturity. flow variability and the degree of ﬂow regulation might also inﬂuence growth (lytle & poff 2004). for example, if conditions for spawning do not occur then golden perch might resorb gametes for growth and the frequency of this occurring might vary among regulated rivers (mackay 1973; collins & anderson 1999). despite considerable variability, there were still differences in the growth and theoretical maximum size of golden perch between sexes and among the four sub-basins. for a large river system where ﬂooding and temperature regimes vary among sub- basins, there appears to be pervasive effects on the growth characteristics of golden perch populations. hence, variable growth rates among rivers could be the result of interactions between local productivity in relation to ﬂooding, regional temperature regimes and variable annual spawning effort. relationship between river ﬂow and recruitment the positive correlations between the number of ﬁsh in each age class and increased ﬂows observed in this study support previous ﬁndings linking rising ﬂows 585 roberts et al. and ﬂood mediated spawning and recruitment for golden perch (mallen-cooper & stuart 2003; king et al. 2005; balcombe et al. 2006; humphries et al. 2008). in particular, river ﬂows during the warmer months (december to march) had the greatest number of positive correlations in all rivers. in the fitzroy basin, river ﬂows are episodic with a seasonal bias toward larger monsoon ﬂows in the summer and autumn months (december to march). some ﬁsh species of the fitzroy basin rely on this seasonal pattern of ﬂooding for recruitment and access to habitats (staunton-smith et al. 2005). for golden perch in a tropical river system with a semi-arid catchment, ﬂexible spawning strategies in response to environmental stimuli is an advantageous adaptive mechanism to succeed in a harsh environment with highly variable river ﬂows (thoms & sheldon 2000; balcombe et al. 2006). golden perch possess a number of life history adaptations suited to these conditions, an extended breeding season, high fecundity, high mobil- ity, ﬂexible spawning strategies and wide physiolog- ical tolerances (lake 1967; collins & anderson 1999; mallen-cooper 1999; humphries et al. 2002; mallen- cooper & stuart 2003; o’connor et al. 2005). including ﬂexible growth rates, despite these adaptive strategies to cope with ﬂow variability, the regulation and alterations of the natural patterns of ﬂows, in particular the timing, amplitude and duration of ﬂows, and potentially water temper- ature, has still resulted in a range of adverse impacts on golden perch (cadwallader 1978). these include severe declines in the natural abundance and range, heightened larval mortality, interrupted migration and irregular recruitment events as observed in the age class strengths (puckridge et al. 1998; baumgartner et al. 2006; mallen-cooper & brand 2007). in systems such as the fitzroy basin, the potential negative effects of river regulation might be heightened because of the inherently variable nature of the natural ﬂow regime (puckridge et al. 1998) and the ongoing demand for further water resource management for human use in the form of additional dams and weirs. currently, the largest dam in the fitzroy basin is fairbairn dam on the nogoa river (1.3 · 106 ml capacity, department of natural resources 1998) which is capable of capturing a large proportion of the ﬂood volume as exempliﬁed by the few occasion the impoundment has overtopped since its construc- tion. despite this, the nogoa river upstream of the dam is unregulated and remains one of the longest reaches of unregulated river in the catchment and maintains an abundant population of golden perch (long & berghuis 1999) with relatively consistent recruitment between years as evidenced by the patterns in the age class frequency. the comet and the connors ⁄ isaac rivers within the fitzroy basin are 586 largely unregulated and would provide an interesting contrast to the recruitment patterns of golden perch from the more highly regulated rivers in the basin. the pattern in age class frequency of golden perch from the nogoa river suggests that recruitment occurs across a wide range of ﬂow magnitudes. two of the three dominant age groups in the nogoa river (5 and 6 years old) corresponded to relatively large ﬂow )1 for events in the order of 30,000–58,000 mlæday periods of 3 to 4 days. however, the ﬂow volume coinciding with the most abundant age class (4 year old) were relatively small, with a maximum discharge )1 that lasted approximately 24 h at of 9072 mlæday this intensity. this relatively small ﬂow would likely have been completely contained within the low ﬂow terraces of (d. bell, dnr&w, personal communication). this apparent inconsistency between ﬂow size and recruitment as measured by age class strength was responsible for the low correlations for all ﬂow statistics in the nogoa river. the lack of clear ﬂow-recruitment patterns might also be indica- tive of a high degree of ﬂexibility to spawning cues and suitable conditions for subsequent recruitment that occur in a relatively unregulated reach of river such as the upper nogoa river. this assertion is also some- what reﬂected in the regulated dawson river, how- ever, the sample size was relatively small and more research is needed. the nogoa river these observations from the nogoa river are in accordance with studies in the murray–darling system that have also found that golden perch spawn and recruit in response to a wide variety of ﬂow conditions from ﬂoodplain inundation events, high ﬂows that were contained within the banks of the river and possibly during minimal ﬂow conditions (mackay 1973; mallen-cooper & stuart 2003; king et al. 2005; balcombe et al. 2006). relationship between water temperature and recruitment the importance of water temperature (nominally >23 °c) to promote golden perch spawning was ﬁrst observed by lake (1967) in enclosed pond environ- ments. jones (1974) also reported that recruitment, as judged by ageing a sample of the murray river population, was not restricted to periods of major ﬂooding which had inundated ﬂoodplains and con- cluded that water temperature was the major control- ling factor. although golden perch may actually spawn at lower water temperatures, for this study the nominal ﬁgure of 23 °c, which is considered appropriate for a tropical river, was used as a basis to examine the relationship between seasonal water temperatures in the fitzroy basin and recruitment patterns. the period from october to april (late spring through to autumn) across the fitzroy basin generally coincides with river water temperatures exceeding 23 °c. however, this threshold temperature is reached as late as november or as early as march in the cooler dawson and nogoa rivers. flow events that occur prior to november and after march generally result in poor recruitment in the fitzroy basin. this relatively narrow window of optimal temperature is highlighted in the nogoa river where a large ﬂow event (239,000 mlæday )1) which commenced relatively late in the wet season (late march and continuing into april) would have coincided with a period of the year when water temperatures are rapidly cooling to below 23 °c and resulted in the fewest age class (7 year olds). the mechanism for in cooler water temperatures may be due to a number of factors including weaker spawning cues associated with lower water temperatures, reduced survival of larvae developing in cooler periods prior to winter, or reduced food supplies. hence, the strength of recruit- ment events could have been inﬂuenced by spawning and ⁄ or larvae survival processes (koehn & harrington 2006). reduced recruitment for golden perch in the fitzroy basin, it appears that spawning and recruitment are closely linked to both river ﬂow and water temperatures and in order to mitigate the effects of river regulation, ﬂow manage- ment strategies need to be cognizant of these linkages and ensure environmental ﬂow rules are linked with ecological relevance. elsewhere the importance of the seasonal timing of ﬂows and temperature in control- ling the strength of in riverine ﬁsh populations has been demonstrated for a range of ﬁshes and habitats (nilo et al. 1997; staunton-smith et al. 2004; bonvechio & allen 2005; lobo´ n-cervia & mortensen 2005) and the optimal combination of these factors is likely to be a signiﬁcant controlling factor in structuring ﬁsh populations. recruitment effects of river regulation the recruitment success as measured by the number of ﬁsh observed in each age class varied considerably between rivers. although this could be an artefact of the relatively small sample size in the dawson and mackenzie rivers these observations may also reﬂect, in part, variability in hydrologic conditions and the degree of river regulation in the form of impound- ments and changes to the natural ﬂow patterns. the most variable recruitment patterns seem to occur in the mackenzie and fitzroy rivers whereby only one or two age classes comprise a relatively large proportion of the total sample in the order of 50% and 61%, respectively. conversely, in the nogoa river and to a lesser extent the dawson river, there were multiple age classes comprising a larger proportion of the total sample indicating more frequent recruitment across the recruitment patterns of golden perch period observed. the three independent measures used in this study to represent the changes in river conditions due to ﬂow regulation indicate that the fitzroy and mackenzie rivers are more regulated compared with the dawson and nogoa rivers. combined, these measures might be indicative of fewer opportunities for golden perch to successfully recruit in the fitzroy and mackenzie rivers which is reﬂected in the variability in age classes exhibited in these two rivers. water resources in the fitzroy basin are managed under a water resource plan that speciﬁes a range of ﬂow operating principles to take into consideration environmental ﬂow requirements of ﬂow dependent species (department of natural resources 1999). one environmental ﬂow objective includes the provision of the ‘ﬁrst post winter ﬂow event’, deﬁned as the ﬁrst ﬂow occurring in a year commencing between the 15th september and 10th april, lasts for 21 days and if commencing in september, must be at least 23 °c. although the water resource plan in some way allows for water temperature to be considered, this is only deﬁned for the month of september. in light of the present research, it appears more appropriate, both in terms of suitability for golden perch spawning cues and optimal use of water for environmental ﬂow objectives, the ﬁrst post-winter ﬂow rule be reconsidered to take into account the variability in timing of the minimum water temperature of 23 °c within each river irrespective of the month of the year, as the primary trigger for the environmental ﬂow releases. that despite the apparent relationship between golden perch recruitment and river ﬂow, water temperature and the degree of river regulation in the fitzroy basin during this study, there are undoubtedly many other factors that would have a signiﬁcant bearing on the spawning and successful recruitment of golden perch including pop- ulation dynamics, food availability and migration pathways (bye 1984; humphries & lake 2000; king et al. 2003; balcombe et al. 2006), hence future research effort need to take into consideration some of these factors for ﬁsh in the fitzroy river basin. golden perch exhibit ﬂexible life history character- istics, which are an adaptation to a river with highly variable ﬂow conditions with unpredictable summer monsoon ﬂooding. flexibility in key life-history characteristics such as longevity and high fecundity, and the capacity to recruit in response to a range of environmental factors including ﬂow and temperature, are adaptive strategies that have contributed to the success of this species. as infrastructure for river regulation increases in the fitzroy basin, more appro- priate ﬂow management strategies will be needed (arthington et al. 2006). to assist in ameliorating the adverse effects of ﬂow modiﬁcation, the existing 587 roberts et al. environmental ﬂow scenarios for the fitzroy basin should also consider release strategies that take into account the combined inﬂuence of ﬂow timings and river speciﬁc temperature differences. acknowledgements our sincere thanks to
