e-mail: tommi.linnansaari@unb.ca accepted for publication june 20, 2010 introduction habitat use by juvenile atlantic salmon salmo_salar l. has been widely studied during the last few decades (e.g. heggenes 1990; armstrong et al. 2003). logis- tical difﬁculty to implement studies in deep areas of rivers has, however, resulted in a situation where studies examining the effects of depth on habitat choice by juvenile salmonids have mostly been carried out in shallow (<1 m) parts of streams (e.g. egglishaw & shackley 1982; kennedy & strange 1982; green- berg et al. 2001). bremset (1999) pointed out that the existing habitat suitability data for atlantic salmon incorporates a considerable bias for shallow micro- habitats although several studies have shown that juvenile salmon are also abundant in deep pools (gardiner 1984; bremset & berg 1997, 1999). in large rivers, the majority of the wetted area may consist of relatively deep habitats not necessarily described as pools (i.e. deep rifﬂes, rapids and glides; e.g., beechie et al. 2005; borsa´nyi et al. 2004), where monitoring of salmonid abundance using traditional electroﬁshing methods is not possible. based on the existing water velocity and substratum size suitability curves for juvenile atlantic salmon, these deep areas should be suitable for juvenile atlantic salmon (ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 2004). it is uncertain, however, if such areas are suitable for juvenile atlantic salmon as the existing habitat suitability curves are not extended to the very deep areas. since the various deep habitats can constitute a major part of the wetted area in large impact on the rivers, production capacity of the suitability of the deep habitats would be less in comparison with shallow areas. they may have a substantial river systems even if the purpose of this study was to determine if juvenile atlantic salmon use deep, fast-ﬂowing hab- itats in large rivers. throughout the article, ‘deep habitat’ refers to areas that are not effectively studied with traditional electroﬁshing methods; a threshold level of 1.0 m was chosen to distinguish between deep and shallow areas. the ﬁrst objective of the study was to determine [by self contained underwater breathing apparatus the different age classes of juvenile salmon (0+ and >0+, hereafter young-of-the-year or yoy and parr, respectively) (scuba)-diving] if 618 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00443.x show preference for particular water depths in large rivers. the second objective was to identify if the deep habitats are used throughout the summer months, june–august, and compare possible changes in the frequency of occurrence of juvenile atlantic salmon in deep and shallow habitats based on ﬁxed underwater video monitoring. material and methods study area the study was carried out in two large river systems, the river tornionjoki and the river teno, both situated in northern finland (fig. 1). atlantic salmon is the predominant ﬁsh species in the ﬂuvial habitats of both river systems (niemela¨ et al. 1999; va¨ha¨ et al. 2009). the river tornionjoki forms a 500-km long border between sweden and finland and has a drainage area of 40,000 km2 with an annual mean discharge of )1. it is the most productive approximately 380 m3æs salmon river draining to the baltic sea with an juvenile salmon in deep ﬂuvial habitats estimated wild smolt production of about 1.2 million smolts in 2008 (va¨ha¨ et al. 2009). scuba-diving (self contained underwater breathing apparatus; here- after diving) was carried out in ﬁve separate study sites (a–e) in the river muonionjoki, a large tributary of the river tornionjoki (fig. 1). all study sites were (67°34¢n; located within a 10-km river segment 23°31¢e, fig. 1) about 255 km upstream from the sea. a description of the general characteristics of the diving sites is shown in table 1. the river teno, with >1200 km of accessible migration routes for atlantic salmon, forms the border between northern norway and finland (70°n). the river system supports one of the largest atlantic salmon populations in the world (annual salmon catch mostly between 100 and 200 t; niemela¨ et al. 2004) and has a drainage area of 16,000 km2 with an annual )1. under- mean discharge of approximately 200 m3æs water videocamera recording was carried out in an area close to the conﬂuence of the river utsjoki (a tributary to river teno, 69°54¢n; 27°02¢e), 106 km upstream from the sea. video data were collected by using a camera in both shallow and deep habitats in fig. 1. location of the self contained underwater breathing apparatus-diving sites (a–e) in the river muonionjoki, and the underwater videocamera recording sites in the river teno and the river utsjoki. the cameras monitoring the deep and shallow habitat are denoted as d and s, respectively. 619 linnansaari et al. table 1. physical characteristics of the self contained underwater breathing apparatus-diving sites in the river muonionjoki, finland. water velocity was measured at the 0.6 · depth;

ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 2004) leaving depth as the only habitat variable that could limit occurrence of juvenile salmon in the study locations (0.40–0.65 m and 0.55–0.80 in shallow; 1.60–1.70 m and 1.34–1.45 m in deep habitats in the rivers teno and utsjoki, respectively). water velocity and substratum size were similar at the camera locations for the shallow and deep habitats in both rivers. underwater visibility remained high throughout the studied period (typically >6 m; orell & erkinaro 2007) and was not considered to limit the detection probability of juvenile salmon. scuba-diving the diver used a standard set of scuba-equipment (e.g. dolloff et al. 1996) and a drysuit but no ﬁns. diving was carried out along eight equidistant transects in each study site, except for site d (fig. 1) where diving was possible along only six and a half transects due to excessively high water velocity (i.e. )1 at surface) in the mid-river locations (i.e. >1.5 mæs total of 38.5 transects). transects were positioned parallel transect situated 11–14 m away from the river bank. before each dive, a transect rope (140 m in total length) was anchored to the river substratum. the ﬁrst and last 20 m of the transect rope was not used for making observations of juvenile salmon to avoid any fright bias that anchor installation may have caused. the diver recorded the occurrence of juvenile salmon within an area up to 1.0 metre to the left side of the to the streamﬂow with the ﬁrst 620 transect rope (relative to diving direction) and hence, the area studied along each transect was 100 m2. the transect rope was marked every metre to keep track of the spatial location relative to the start of the transect. substratum sizes within a square metre area were visually evaluated every 10 m (table 1) and water depth was simultaneously recorded using a suunto d3 diving computer (accuracy ±0.05 m; suunto ltd., vantaa, finland). upon encountering a juvenile salmon, the diver stopped to record the depth and substratum size at the ﬁsh location and to observe the behaviour of ﬁsh. the identiﬁcation of juveniles as yoy or salmon parr was based on visual estimation of the ﬁsh size such that the ﬁsh <6 cm in total length were assigned as yoy (based on long term data of yoy sizes in the system; a. romakkaniemi, unpub- lished data). brown_trout occur in the tributaries of the river muonionjoki (haikonen et al. 2003) but as only one juvenile brown_trout was documented during the dives, the species was not further considered in this study. following each dive, mean water velocities were measured at 0.6 depth with a schiltknecht miniair2 ﬂow meter (schiltknecht messtechnik ag, gossau switzerland) from a boat every ten metres along each transect. diving in all ﬁve study sites was carried out during the last 2 weeks in august 2002 when water temper- ature ranged from 12 to 19 °c. systematic testing of the efﬁciency of the method to detect juvenile salmon was hampered by a decline in water temperature below 10 °c in early september after which the number of juvenile salmon visible to a diver declined, presum- ably because many of the ﬁsh were sheltering within the substratum (fraser et al. 1993). therefore, the abundance estimates reported in this study represent a minimum number of juvenile salmon, based on the diving transects. the detection probability of juvenile salmon between transects was assumed to be similar. data from the different study sites were used as replicates, and both ﬁsh and habitat availability data were pooled across the study sites. underwater videorecording the video recording was carried out on ﬁve separate 24-h periods during the summer of 2002 at all four camera locations (fig. 1); 13 and 27 june, 9 and 22 july and 5 august (except the ﬁrst recording in shallow habitat in the river teno which occurred 12 june). in the river teno and in the deep habitat of the river utsjoki, monochrome cameras (jai 1020; jai corporation ltd., glostrup, denmark) with cosmi- car ⁄ pentax tv lens (hx 3.7 mm; pentax ltd., tokyo, japan) were used. in the shallow habitat of the river utsjoki, the video equipment included a monochrome camera (wat-902 h; watec company, yamagata, japan) combined with a yamano (yamano optical company, kanagawa, japan) wide angle lens (hx 3.5 mm). the cameras remained in place throughout the season in the river utsjoki and the lenses were cleaned before each recording period. in the river teno, recording session for safety reasons. the location of cameras remained constant the only exception was in the shallow habitat in the river teno where the camera had to be located further from the recording date to ensure riverbank after the ﬁrst complete submersion of the camera following a decline in water level. the cameras were removed after throughout the study; the recording was based on 12-h time-lapse video recording at ﬁve frames per second and the data were stored on vhs and s-vhs tapes and analysed using panasonic video recorders (ag-6024 and ag-tl700; panasonic, kadoma, japan). the video material was analysed by counting the number of juvenile salmon observed during a 30-s period every 5 min for each 24-h period (i.e. 288 separate 30-s periods for each 24- h for each camera). an individual ﬁsh was recorded only once during each 30-s period although some individuals momentarily disappeared behind rocks during an observation period; still and slow motion pictures were used to ascertain the accuracy of observations. it should be noted that ﬁsh counts between different 30 s observation periods likely included recounts of the same ﬁsh individuals, causing pseudoreplication (hurlbert 1984); the frequency of occurrence as reported in this study is not a measure of juvenile salmonid abundance in the study locations but rather a proxy of the relative difference in occurrence between deep and shallow habitats. the 24-h period was divided into day (08:00– 20:00 hours) and night (20:00–08:00 hours) segments. therefore, juvenile salmon in deep ﬂuvial habitats total darkness was not experienced during the study due to the polar day conditions in these high latitudes; rather, the night was characterised as a dimmer period largely caused by overshadowing from the nearby mountains. water temperature ranged from 11.9 to 15.2 °c during the study period. because juvenile atlantic salmon is the predominant small bodied ﬁsh in the study area (virtually no juvenile brown_trout or other ﬁsh species; niemela¨ et al. 1999), and because of the high quality of the video output data, the probability of erroneous ﬁsh species identiﬁcation was considered negligible. data analysis habitat availability data collected along the diving transects were analysed in surfer 7.0 for windows (golden software inc 1999). an exponential vario- gram model without a nugget effect was applied to the physical habitat data to describe the spatial depen- dency between the measurement locations in each study site (variograms were presented in linnansaari 2003). habitat availability maps for different depth categories at each study site were then created based on the variogram models using a geostatistical method of kriging (e.g. cressie 1991; muotka et al. 1999). using such maps, the availability of different depth categories was calculated by summing the area belonging to different depth categories along each diving transect and data across all study sites were pooled (total of 3850 m2). frequency distributions of habitat use and availability were compared using kolmogorov–smirnov (ksm) test and depth prefer- ences were calculated using jacobs’ index (jacobs 1974) standardised to range from 0 to 1. mann– whitney u-tests were used for comparisons of indi- vidual habitat variables between age groups of ﬁsh (i.e. yoy and parr). wilcoxon signed ranks test (tw) was used for comparisons involving video recording data. mean values were reported with the correspond- ing standard errors. results scuba-diving a total of 117 juvenile salmon (40 yoy, 77 parr) were observed during the diving surveys. two salmon parr were observed feeding 10–15 cm above the substra- tum; all other juvenile salmon held stations in contact with the river substratum during the observations. fish did not seem disturbed by the presence, or approach, of a diver. the observed occurrence (density) of ranged from 0 to 5 yoy 100 m parr 100 m juveniles )2 and from 0 to 8 )2 within the study transect areas. the 621 linnansaari et al.

signiﬁcantly correlated with water temperature or water level in either the river teno or the river utsjoki during the study period (rp, p > 0.05 for all correlations). diel variations in the mean

due to the increasing amount of nocturnal activity towards the end of the study period, the pattern was not statistically signiﬁcant (tw = )0.77, n = 10, p = 0.44, fig. 5b). however, when the mean relative daytime frequency of occur- rence was contrasted between the two depth zones, the daytime observations were indeed more common in the deep than in shallow habitats (shallow vs. deep, pooled data: tw = )2.67, n = 10, p = 0.008). discussion the current study showed that deep habitats (i.e. >1 m depth) are readily used as rearing areas for juvenile atlantic salmon in large northern rivers. the video data showed that deep habitats are used throughout the summer by juvenile atlantic salmon although the total abundance of juvenile salmon was not estimated. moreover, the diving data indicated that salmon parr use shallow and deep habitats equally in large rivers when water velocity and substratum conditions are suitable. also, yoy salmon were frequently observed in deep habitats although they showed a preference for the shallower habitats. the extensive use of deep habitats observed in this study supports the view that water depth alone may be of little importance for establishing habitat suitability for juvenile atlantic salmon in large rivers (degraaf & bain 1986; morantz 623 linnansaari et al. et al. 1987; bremset & berg 1999). it is obvious that deep habitats need to be considered as suitable rearing areas when production of juvenile atlantic salmon is evaluated in large rivers. level (finnish environment the notion that deep, fast ﬂowing habitats are usable by juvenile atlantic salmon extends the ﬁnd- ings of previous habitat studies which typically report a suitable (or commonly used) range for juvenile salmon occurrence to be between 0.2 and 0.8 m in smaller nursery streams (e.g. heggenes 1990; scruton & gibson 1993; armstrong et al. 2003). although bremset & berg (1997, 1999) and gardiner (1984) showed that deep pools are used by juvenile atlantic salmon, depth habitats in large rivers may require a different classiﬁcation. for example, it is important to realise that in large rivers, the classiﬁcation of deep areas as pools (typical in smaller streams) may be inappropriate. rather, such areas may be better designated as deep rifﬂes, rapids and glides where ‘optimal’ conditions in terms of water velocity and substratum size can be found for juvenile atlantic salmon (sensu armstrong et al. 2003). indeed, the availability of the various deep habitats can be substantial in large rivers such as those studied herein. for example, the majority of the wetted area of the diving sites in the river muonionjoki was >1.0 m deep even though the mean stage of the river during the study was almost 0.2 m below the 30-year average water institute 2002). likewise, an estimated 80% of the 1700 hectares of atlantic salmon biotope (i.e. rapids and rifﬂes) in the river teno is deeper than 1.0 m (niemela¨ et al. 1999; e. niemela¨, finnish game and fisheries research, personal communication). it should be noted, how- ever, that not all of the deep habitat was used. juvenile atlantic salmon were never observed in areas where the substratum material was mobile (typically sand ⁄ small gravel among cobble–boulder substratum) due to turbulent, down-welling ﬂow vortices, emphasising the importance of stability of substratum and the interplay between depth and other habitat variables. furthermore, deep habitats were not used as a three- dimensional space like has been described in smaller norwegian streams (bremset & berg 1999). instead, juvenile salmon remained in close contact to the substratum and made only short bursts to capture prey after which the ﬁsh returned to stations in contact with the substratum. as suggested by bremset (1999), the difference in space use between the current study and bremset & berg (1999) likely stems from the higher water velocities measured in our study locations; energetic costs are minimised in fast ﬂowing water by holding positions at sheltered bottom locations (this study) whereas juvenile salmon can utilise the whole of water column at minimal energetic costs in the slow ﬂowing pools studied by bremset & berg (1999). 624 the results concerning the depth range used by juvenile salmon in this study (i.e. highest depth of 1.9 m for yoy; 2.2 m for parr) should not be considered exhaustive and must not be interpreted as an upper threshold-level for juvenile salmon occur- rence in deep habitats. rather, the results from this study merely reﬂect the fact that transect diving and video recording were not carried out in (even) deeper sections of the study rivers. the video data indicated that deep habitats (1.4– the summer season 1.7 m) were used throughout showing that these habitats provided a steady supply of both shelter and food necessary for juvenile salmon. in the river utsjoki, more juvenile salmon were consistently observed in the shallow than in the deep habitats. since the analysis of the video material did not account for the size of the ﬁsh observed, the above result was likely a consequence of the fact that yoy salmon were concentrated in the shallow areas (see above). the video data also indicated differences in the timing of the most frequent observations within the diel cycle between the shallow and deep habitats. although true nocturnal darkness was not experienced during the study, the increased daytime occurrence of juvenile salmon in deep habitats may indicate that deep water was perceived as an adequate form of overhead cover from predation allowing relatively ‘safer’ daytime activity in deep than in shallow habitats. this view is supported by gibson & erkinaro (2009), who suggested that water depth per se may provide sufﬁcient cover from predation. that the diel differences in the use of shallow and deep areas was not observed by the end of the study period probably reﬂects the initiation of a nocturnal winter behaviour pattern by juvenile salmon (fraser et al. 1993; linn- ansaari et al. 2008). the current study was not an attempt to estimate the total abundance of juvenile salmon in deep habitats. the video data were compromised by apparent pseudoreplication (hurlbert 1984), invalidating an estimation of total ﬁsh abundance. also, planned experiments of repeated diving to document consis- tency of within-transect ﬁsh enumeration were pre- maturely terminated because of the decline of water temperature below 10 °c (and the consequent decline in juvenile salmon visible during daytime; fraser et al. 1993). studies comparing the efﬁciency of visual counts and electroﬁshing surveys to enumerate juve- nile salmonids have generally concluded that visual methods tend to underestimate ﬁsh density by 50–90% in rivers with coarse substratum (cunjak et al. 1988; heggenes et al. 1990). density estimates based on electroﬁshing in the shallower parts (i.e. 0.5–1.0 m) of the diving sites (carried out a week after the diving) ranged from 5.1 to 8.6 yoy and 8.5 to 9.4 parr per 100 m2 (linnansaari 2003), indicating that the number of juvenile salmon was 2- to 8-fold higher than observed during the dives. therefore, the abundance data collected by means of scuba-diving should be considered as a minimum estimate of the number of juvenile salmon in deep habitats. subsequent research is urgently needed to conﬁrm how widely applicable are the results from the current study, and particularly the fact that no depth preference was noted for salmon parr in large rivers, for the range of depths studied herein. although our results may imply that electroﬁshing-based density estimates of salmon parr from the shallow (i.e. 0.3–1.0 m) habitat could also be applicable in deep areas where water velocity and substratum composition are comparable, studies incorporating estimates of the true density are necessary before any conclusion can be made. sim- ilarly, the abundance of yoy salmon, and the extent to which they are found in deep habitats (i.e. density), warrant more research. even the low abundance of yoy salmon observed in the deep areas of the rivers teno and tornionjoki can be signiﬁcant due to the vast amount of deep habitats in such large rivers. it is concluded that the use of habitat suitability curves derived from shallow nursery streams may signiﬁcantly bias the interpretation of suitability of habitats for juvenile atlantic salmon in deep, large rivers. due to the high availability of deep habitats in large river systems like the river teno and the river tornionjoki, deep areas can contribute signiﬁcantly to the production of atlantic salmon and should be included in production capacity estimates. therefore, research is urgently needed to provide such informa- tion if the density of juvenile salmon in deep habitats can be reliably predicted from estimates in the shallower habitats or if direct estimates of densities in deep areas are necessary to give realistic estimates of the total production in large rivers. finally, it has to be recognised that the data presented in this study were collected from a limited number of sampling locations over a short period within a single year. therefore, more work is needed to evaluate the extent to which deep habitats are used by juvenile salmon in rivers with different physical characteristics (e.g. geomor- phology) and across different seasons. acknowledgements we are grateful to sauli vatanen and kari pulkkinen for help during the ﬁeldwork. pauliina louhi provided constructive advice concerning
