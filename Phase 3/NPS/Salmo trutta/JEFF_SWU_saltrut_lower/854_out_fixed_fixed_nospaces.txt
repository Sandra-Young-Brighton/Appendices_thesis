antunes & tesch, 1996) for the identi- fication of the metamorphosis zone observed on the otoliths of eel larvae. in addition, information on the occurrence of leptocephali of other anguilli- formes along the west european coast may be ob- tained from these samples (strehlow et al., in prepa- ration). unfortunately, the 199 1 cruise during which this type of sampling was carried out was, as far as recent years are concerned, the last of its kind. this is the reason for this special paper with this article was presented at the september 1994 session of the eifackes working group on eel, oviedo, spain. its reports on this single year of sampling. at the same time, we have to state that resumption of this kind of study is necessary as long as several re- gional and general problems of anguilliformes have not been resolved. material and methods the sampling was carried out from on board the r.v. “heincke” (length 66 mj, and the gear used was a modified isaac kidd midwater trawl (ikmt) with a front opening of 6 m2. the characteristics of this gear were described by tesch (1 980). the speed of towing was 2 knots and the duration of each tow was around 55 minutes. the depth of all hauls var- ied between 50, 75 and 100 m. the catches were made at night between 38’40’ and 47’19’ n (figure l), during two periods: 19:oo-22:oo hours and 03:oo-06:oo hours, with the exception of the first night which started at 20:oo and the last night of capture which lasted from 19:oo until 02: 10. measurements of the total lengths of the lepto- cephali were taken using fresh material. larvae length comparisons between and in each latitude area were made using student’s t-test. the develop- 50 eel larvae results from a total of 31 hauls, 21 hauls captured lepto- cephali (67.7%). five of these hauls were performed at a depth of 50 m (24%), 8 hauls at 75 m (38%) and 8 hauls at 100 m (38%). the hauls that recorded the highest values (15 leptocephali - 42'25' n 09'35' w, 24 leptocephali - 46'25' n 07'10' w) were taken at 100 m, both at 05:20-06:15 (table 1). we obtained 4.5 larvae per positive haul and 3.06 larvae as an average of all hauls. north of 43"n the values were 4 larvae per positive haul and, as an average of all hauls, 2.8 larvae while south of 43'n we ob- tained 4.9 larvae per positive haul and an average of 3.25 larvae for all hauls. leptocephali of stages 1-11 were observed in 62% of the hauls, 111-iv in 34% and stage v in 4%. dif- ferences were observed between north and south. while stages 1-11 were present in the bay of biscay in 46% of the positive hauls, west of the iberian peninsula this stage of development was registered in 82% of the positive hauls. larval length was significantly different between north (7.31m.38 cm) and south (6.84f0.34 cm) of (r0.05). these differences were also ob- 43'n tained when comparing, for these latitudes, the stages 1-11 and 111-iv (ko.01). however, for each area, no significant difference was observed be- tween stages 1-11 and 111-iv (p>0.05). the maxi- mum length obtained was 8.2 cm (46'n) while the minimum was 5.8 cm (42'n). the water temperature, at the surface, was 13.9'c fig. 1. sampling stations for eel larvae in october 1991. 0=3 hauls: .=6 hauls. ment stages were determined by means of strub- berg's (1913) method, adapted by bertin (1956), be- fore preservation in 70% alcohol. table 1. number and development stage of eel larvae captured in october 1991, at different positions, time and depth. ikmt = isaac kidd midwater trawl date 23.10.1991 24.1 0.1 991 24.1 0.1 991 24 10 1991 24.10.1991 25.1 0.1 991 25.1 0.1 991 25.1 0,1991 25.10.1991 25.10.1991 26.1 0.1 991 26.10 1991 26.1 0.1 991 26.1 0.1 991 26.1 0.1 991 27.10.1991 27.10.1991 27 10 1991 27.10.1991 27.1 0.1 991 28.10.1991 position 38"40n 09"53w 39"21n lo"16w 3p25n lo"13w 41 "32n op29w 41"35n 09.30w 42"17n op33w 42"20n 09"34w 42"25n 09"35w 43"13n 09"52w 43"15n 09"51 w 44"oon 09"13w 44o03n 09"ll w 45"39n 07"50w 46"22n 07"12w 46"25n 07"low 47"19n 06"23w 47"18n 06t1 w 47"15n 06"21w 47"16n 06"20w 47"17n 06"21w 47"15n 06"23w time 20:05 03:oo 04:05 20:lo 21 :10 03:oo 04:05 05:15 19:oo 20:05 04:05 05:lo 19:oo 04:05 05:12 19:oo 20:06 21:05 22:45 23:50 01:oo depth of ikmt (m) ~ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ number of larvael development stage 100 50 75 75 50 50 75 100 100 75 75 100 100 75 100 100 75 50 100 75 50 3/1-11 2/1-11 5/14;

tesch & niermann, 1992). a comparison of the length of larvae caught in the bay of biscay and west of the iberian peninsular confirms earlier results concerning the increase of length of the larvae in a s-n direction (tesch et al., 1986; utrecht & holleboom, 1985; bast & streh- low, 1990). resumen 1. entre el 23 y el 27 de octubre de 1991, obtuvimos 31 captu- ras que fueron realizadas por el “isaac kidd midwater trawl” en la bahia de vizcaya y en la costa occidental de la peninsula iberica. 2. en total se capturaron 95 larvas de anguila. a1 norte del paralelo 43”n se capturaron 2.8 larvas por hora de pesca mien- tras que a1 sur (costa occidental de la peninsula ibkrica) se cap- turaron 3.25 larvas por hora. la abundancia de larvas a1 norte y a1 sur fueron similares a las de 10s afios siguientes al fuerte de- scenso de 1980. las larvas miis j6venes (estadios 1-11] domin- aron (82%) en la costa occidental de la peninsula mientras que en la bahia de vizcaya 10s estadios m8s viejos fueron mls fre- cuentes (estadios 111-iv, 53.6%). las larvas del norte mostraron 52
