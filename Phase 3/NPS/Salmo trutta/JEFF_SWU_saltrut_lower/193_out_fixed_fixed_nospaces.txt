however, upstream collections were more divergent from each other than were tidal collec- tions. the absence of distinction of armin f. koernig hatchery from almost all regions was consistent with multiple origins of this stock. conversely, solomon gulch hatchery in the east region was distinct from all regions but east, consistent with a more restricted origin and in- fluence. j. e. seebl, c. habichtl, w. 0. templinl, 1. w. seebl, j. b. shaklee2, f. m. utte6 'alaska department of fish & game, commercial fisheries division, anchorage, alaska, 2washington department of fish & wildlife, olympia, 3school of fisheries, university of washington, seattle, washington, usa key words: allozyme;

thorsteinson et al. 1971). because pink 122 salmon spawn in high densities and are semelpar- ous, returning pink salmon adults are important in conveying essential nutrients and minerals from the marine ecosystem to estuaries, freshwater streams, and terrestrial environments (cf., brick- ell & goering 1970; bilby et al. 1996). both juven- ile and adult pink salmon are important sources of food for many fishes, birds, and mammals in prin- ce william sound. wild pink salmon populations of prince william sound have been affected in recent years by natu- ral and anthropogenic phenomena. a major tec- tonic upheaval resulting from the 1964 earthquake centered near prince william sound (roys 1971) and raised some tidal areas 10 m above sea level while submerging other areas by up to two m. hatcheries began releasing pink salmon in 1975, and between 1988 and 1997 hatchery releases com- posed on average 76% of pink salmon returns to prince william sound (morstad et al. 1998). the genetic effects of these releases on wild populations are currently unknown. in concert with these hatchery releases has been an increase in commer- cial catch of pink salmon from a 3 million average before hatcheries to an 18 million average since hatcheries began (morstad et al. 1998). finally, the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill of 41 million liters of crude oil produced both direct and indirect effects on pink salmon in prince william sound. direct effects may have included germ-line genetic dam- age (bue et al. 1998; roy et al. 1999) in tidally spawning pink salmon. indirect effects of the oil spill include over-harvest and depletions of wild stocks in eastern prince william sound as a conse- quence of redirected harvest on these stocks away from the spill area in 1989 (templin et al. 1996). proper management of pink salmon is depend- ent upon adequate knowledge of the population structure of even- and odd-year runs (shaklee & varnavskaya 1994). a finding of genetic structur- ing within each year class would support popula- tion-specific management to minimize over-har- vesting of weak segments of the run. understand- ing population genetic structures of wild populations would also provide a valuable baseline for monitoring and guiding hatchery releases and locations and for assessing the consequences of hatchery and harvest management policies. ecological diversity within prince william sound may influence the population structure of pink salmon. generally, pink salmon populations are found to be genetically similar over large geo- graphic distributions (olsen et al. 1998). however, within prince william sound, potentially discrete aggregations of pink salmon spawn in tidal areas, upstream areas, areas influenced extensively by gla- cial run off, and areas where glaciers are absent. genetics of alaskan pink salmon patterns of gene flow may differ among tidal- and upstream-spawning pink salmon because homing to upstream habitats may be more precise than homing to tidal habitats (john thedinga, u.s. na- tional marine fisheries service, personal com- munication). additionally, time of spawning is par- titioned into early and late peaks that may be maintained by dispersive selection (e.g., smoker et al. 1998). ecological variables such as these have been linked to genetically mediated differences in meristic, morphometric, and developmental characters in pink and chum salmon populations as a consequence of environmental selection (beacham & murray 1987; beacham et al. 1988; see review in utter et al. 1993). since the early 1970s, genetic variations detected by molecular genetic procedures have revolution- ized our understanding of population structures (avise 1994). the oldest and most extensively ap- plied class of molecular variants in salmonid fishes has been allozymes, where the amount of popula- tion genetic data may be exceeded only by droso- phila and humans (allendorf & waples 1996). the ability to assay allelic products of many nuclear loci rapidly and at low cost has led to the accumu- lation of considerable gene frequency data on pink salmon (e.g., shaklee & varnavskaya 1994) including pre-hatch- ery and oilspill data from prince william sound (seeb & wishard 1977). cytoplasmic and matern- ally inherited variants of mitochondria1 dna (mtdna) complement nuclear allozyme data for studying population structures of pacific salmon (allendorf 1994). because of its distinct inherit- ance and potentially greater resolving power (gyl- lensten & wilson 1987), mtdna provides inde- pendent genetic assays to nuclear loci for estimat- ing stock structures. the pacific rim throughout the present data are part of an ongoing investi- gation focused on defining genetic structure of populations of pink salmon as a basis for improv- ing management in prince william sound. allo- zyme and mtdna data are presented from wild adult fish captured in 1994 from 25 tidal and up- stream locations and from concurrently returning adults from two hatcheries. w e examine relation- ships among wild collections and between wild and hatchery fish based on the null hypothesis of pan- mixia among all populations. management strat- egies suggested by genetic relationships are dis- cussed. study area prince william sound is located at the northeast- ern corner of the pacific ocean, at the very north- ern tip of the gulf of alaska (61"n, 147"w). pink 123 seeb et al. salmon spawn in more than 800 streams in prince william sound, which is divided into five regions for the management of harvest (fig. 1). divisions were made based upon geology, run timing, and stream characters (rugolo 1984 and citations therein). southwest region streams have short spawning sections and populations with the latest run timing. the north region is glacially influ- enced and has populations with intermediate run timing. the east region has longer, warmer streams and has populations with the earliest run timing. the southeast region is composed of is- lands with long spawning streams. the montague region is made up of an island, has short streams, and was most affected by the 1964 earthquake. generally, fish enter prince william sound from the gulf of alaska through the southwest region and move clockwise on their way to their spawning areas (templin et al. 1996). material and methods field sampling tissues were collected from 92-100 individuals from each of 25 spawning aggregations from wild- stock streams and two hatcheries during 1994 (table 1, fig. 1). primary consideration was given to tributaries routinely supporting large runs, with further efforts made to sample within each of the five regions and to include streams having both fig. 1. prince william sound, alaska. map locations and the five management regions where pink salmon were sampled in 1994. borders of the management regions were subjectively selected based upon ecotypic variability, including glacial influence, perceived by fisheries biologists in the 1970s (pirtle 1978). streams in the north region except mink creek (lo), are most influenced by glacial melt. streams in the east and southeast regions are generally longer with higher drainage areas and are rain fed. streams on montague the southwest region are short with smaller drainage areas and are rain fed. southeast and montague regions are composed solely of islands. 124 table 1. location of pink salmon collections taken from prince william sound in 1994. sample numbers coordinate collections with multidimensional scaling plots in fig. 2 and 3. map numbers refer to fig. 1. elevation describes location within the stream (“upstream”=above the influence of tidal action;

(1987), and nomenclature followed shaklee et al. (1990). an initial screening of 45 individuals from erb and humpback creeks identified 66 putative loci (table 2) for which each of the remaining indi- viduals were screened. allelic data were incorpor- ated for further analyses if the phenotypes were unambiguously scorable and if complete data were available for all populations. throughout these analyses, critical values for each family of tests were adjusted using sequential bonferroni method maintaining an overall 01=0.05 as suggested by rice (1989). heterozygosity estimates included data from loci expressing rare alleles but excluded data from isolocus pairs. rests were done to determine if observed heterozygosities differed significantly be- tween upstream and tidal samples of common streams (paired t-test) and between hatchery and wild collections (t-test). for remaining analyses, rare alleles were excluded to reduce statistical noise (alleles that never occurred at a frequency bo.01 in any collection; see shaklee & varnavskaya 1994). we examined potential departure from expected hardy- weinberg (h- w) proportions using likeli- hood ratios (modified from weir 1996) with all tests within each collection treated as a family of tests. this was done to test for surplus hetero- zygotes (evidence that there was genetic introgres- sion in the previous generation) or deficiency of heterozygotes (wahlund effect; evidence of current stock mixtures). for isoloci (saa t-i,2*, gpi- b1,2*, smdh-a1,2*, smdh-b1,2*), allele fre- quencies were calculated using a multinomial model, assuming independence of alleles at both loci. collections were analyzed for inter-locus ga- metic disequilibria (genepop ver. 3. lc; up- dated version of raymond & rousset 1995) with all tests within each collection treated as a family of tests. this was done as an additional effort to detect current stock mixtures, past genetic intro- gression from other stocks, or genetic bottle- necks. to examine the ability of gametic disequi- libria to detect mixtures, we created artificial 125 seeb et al. table 2. tissue and buffer combinations used to detect enzyme variants expressed by 66 allozyrne loci. locus abbreviations follow shaklee et al.

each of two collections as follows: 1) the two most divergent collections (based on genetic distance) and 2) the most genetically divergent pairs of collections based on the locus pairs found to be in gametic disequilibrium. a gene diversity analysis (nei 1973) was per- formed among the wild collections to partition variation into hierarchical levels. wild collections were organized hierarchically from top to bottom: 1) among collections from different elevations, 2) among regions within tidal and upstream elev- ations and 3) among collections within regions. isoloci were excluded. hierarchical log-likelihood ratios (modified from weir 1996) were tested for homogeneity within and among groups. as before, this analysis was partitioned by elevation and then by region. this hierarchy allowed us to compare structure within tidal collections to structure within up- stream collections. the log-likelihood ratio stat- istic is distributed approximately x2 with (n- 1) (m-1) degrees of freedom, where n is the number of alleles and m is number of collections in the test. if an allele was observed in a collection, then we assumed that it potentially existed within all col- lections at an infinitely small frequency. therefore, the degrees of freedom and log-likelihood statistics were summable, and differences among and within collection subdivisions could be examined. critical values for families of tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons (modified from milliken & johnson 1984) by first evaluating the top hierarch- ical level as a family of tests, i.e., between sources (tidal and upstream) and within sources. a signifi- cant statistic led to evaluating the next hierarchical table 3. restriction enzymes, length of recognition sequence (r), and fragment sizes detected in

size in these patterns. there are three fragments of the indicated size in these patterns genetics of alaskan pink salmon level as a family of tests. if a test was not signifi- cant, all remaining lower levels were treated as a single family of tests. log-likelihood ratios of separate hierarchical groupings examined differences between paired collections within streams (upstream vs tidal col- lections) and between regions with significance levels adjusted as described above. tests between regions involved two groupings 1) after pooling tidal collections within regions and 2) after pooling upstream collections within regions. we also tested these pooled collections against individual hatch- ery collections. all region-to-region tests within el- evation and all region-to-hatchery tests within each hatchery within elevation were treated as sep- arate families. pairwise cavalli-sforza & edwards (1967) chord distances between collections were used in classical multidimensional scaling analysis (lessa 1990) to evaluate genetic relationships. multidimensional scaling analysis plots genetic relationships in two or more dimensions so that plotted distances closely match observed distances in multidimen- sional space and provides a means both to confirm expected structure and to uncover unexpected structure. all calculations were performed using functions in s-plus (mathsoft, inc.) mitochondria1 dna analysis a subset of 40 individuals from each collection was assayed for restriction fragment-length poly- morphisms at sites in the nd5/nd6 region. gen- omic dna was extracted using puregene dna isolation kits for animal tissues (gentra systems, inc. po box 13159, research triangle, nc, usa 27709- 13 159). after extraction, dna was ampli- fied using the polymerase chain reaction. ampli- fied dna was cut with six restriction enzymes pre- viously found (unpublished data) to detect pink salmon haplotype polymorphisms (apa i, bst u i, ecor i.: hinf i, rsa i, xba 6 table 3) and electro- phoresed on agarose gels. fragments were visual- ized under ultraviolet light, and a photographic record was made of each gel. the restriction site polymorphisms detected with each enzyme were pooled as composite haplotypes for statistical analyses. as with allozymes, critical values for each family of tests were adjusted using sequential bonferroni method maintaining an overall a=0.05 as suggested by rice (1989). nucleotide (tc) and haplotype (h) diversity meas- ures (nei 1987) were calculated for all collections using the restriction enzyme analysis package (reap; mcelroy et al. 1992). these measures esti- mate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site between dna sequences (i.e. sequence diver- 127 seeb et al. gence) and the amount of dna polymorphism within collections, respectively. to test for heterogeneity among populations, monte carlo simulations with 10,000 replicates were performed (roff & bentzen 1989) using the reap analysis program. independent tests for heterogeneity were performed in a hierarchical manner following the levels identified in the log- likelihood analysis. however, the chi-square values for individual tests are not summable. monte car- lo tests were also performed between the paired upstream and tidal collections, and among-region tests were conducted by pooling collections within region. definition for families of tests followed the methods identified in the log-likelihood analysis. an analysis of the distribution of molecular variance was made using the analysis of molecular variation (amova) subroutine in arlequin ver. 1.1 (schneider et al. 1997) assuming equal distance among haplotypes (drift model). haplotype corre- lation measures were expressed using @statistics (excoffier et al. 1992). among regions, qct was defined as the correlation of random haplotypes within a group of collections relative to that of random pairs of haplotypes drawn from the entire set of collections. for the analysis among collec- tions within regions, (dsc was the correlation of random haplotypes within collections relative to that of random pairs of haplotypes from the re- gions. finally, for the within-collection analysis, (dst was the correlation of random haplotypes within collections relative to that of random pairs of haplotypes drawn from the entire set of collec- tions. the amova analysis allows for only a two- level hierarchy, so we were unable to partition re- gions within elevations as in the preceding analy- scs. rather, we performed two separate analyses, one based on elevation and one on geographic re- gions. the significance of the observed variance components and @-statistics was tested using 1024 random permutations in amova, which avoids the parametric assumptions of normality and inde- pendence not met by molecular distance measures (excoffier et al. 1992). @st values between pairs of populations, modified coancestry coefficients, were also calculated as a genetic distance and examined with multidimensional scaling analysis. results allozymes: within population variation all collections were screened for variation at 66 loci. seventeen of these loci were eliminated from statistical analyses due to ambiguity in scoring banding patterns (mah-i *, mah-2*, ck-ci *, ck-c2*, fh*, gapdh2*, aman*, tpi-4*), in- complete data (ntp*, pgk-i*, pgk-2*) or be- 128 cause putative alleles were later shown not to fol- low mendelian expectations in progeny from single-pair matings (bgala*, gda*, gr*, bha*, iddh*, tpz-3*; data not shown). reliable allelic variation was detected at 41 of the 49 remaining loci examined (84%; see appendix a). nineteen al- leles were excluded from further analyses because frequency of variants was less than 0.01 in all populations (appendix a). excluding rare alleles reduced the number of polymorphic loci to 34. overall heterozygosities among the 27 collec- tions varied over a narrow range (0.091-0.113) for the 41 loci (mean=o.lol). no significant differ- ences in mean heterozygosities were observed be- tween tidal (0.100) and upstream (0.100) collec- tions within streams nor between hatchery (0.095) and wild (0.102) collections (p=0.089). among 743 tests, no significant overall devi- ations from expected hardy-weinberg proportions for the 34 polymorphic loci were detected after ad- justing for multiple tests. however, we found ga- metic disequilibrium between mah-4* and pgdh* in chenega creek (p=o.ooolo; adjusted a=0.00041), saat-4* and pep-d2* at hump- back creek (p=0.00012; adjusted a=0.00042), and saat-4* and maat-i* at jonah creek (p= 0.00034; adjusted a = 0.00045). two sets of tests with simulated mixtures were used to examine the ability of gametic disequilib- rium to detect mixtures. no gametic disequilib- rium was detected in an artificial mixture of the two most genetically distant collections (erb tidal and lagoon upstream). nor was disequilibrium detected in artificial mixtures of the three most genetically divergent pairs of collections based on the three significant locus pairs found to be in ga- metic disequilibrium (countess creek and lagoon creek upstream, mah-4* and pgdh*; swanson creek and lagoon creek upstream, saat-4* and pep-d2*; rocky creek and lagoon creek up- stream, saat-4* and maat-i*). allozymes: among population variation total diversity. overall allele frequency variation (appendix a) indicated considerable uniformity among the 27 collections. the largest among- population difference between the lowest and the highest allele frequencies at a locus was 0.204 at sidhp-2*, and the range was less than 0.100 at 23 of the 34 variable loci. among the 11 most variable loci (mean frequency of common allele <0.095), the maximum and minimum values all occurred among wild populations where upper lagoon creek accounted for four extremes, more than any other collection. the hierarchical gene diversity analysis (table 4) indicated that the majority of

fact, genetic differences among populations within prin- ce william sound (100 ocean km apart) were com- parable to differences among pink salmon popula- tions that are 3000 ocean km apart in the russian federation, where the differences among popula- tions are considered biologically significant (shaklee & varnavskaya 1994). although prince william sound covers a comparatively small geo- graphic area, it is highly complex. there are over 4800 km of coastline with over 800 streams with available spawning habitat for pink salmon. streams in the eastern portion of prince william sound tend to be longer, with available spawning habitat upstream of tidal areas. in western prince william sound, streams are higher energy, shorter, and often contain barriers to upstream habitat within 0.5 km of the tidal area. further, regional temperature differences exist that may be reflected in run timing differences. for instance, the earliest runs occur in the northern fjords, followed by runs of salmon entering large, cold mountain streams, with the latest runs spawning in lake- and rain-fed island and mainland streams (rugolo 1984). run timing appears to be genetically controlled in pink salmon (smoker et al. 1998); therefore, differences observed in run timing among streams may be a result of differential selective forces on discrete populations rather than environmentally mediated effects on a single population. the relatively small allele frequency range (maximum=0.208) and diversity (gst=0.0071) observed in prince william sound and limited mtdna divergence contrast with larger differences among sockeye salmon (0. nerka walbaum) popu- lations in adjacent and similarly sized cook inlet (seeb et al. 1998). these differences in amounts of diversity among populations of the species are expected based on the life-history differences. selection for precise homing in sockeye salmon, which require a lake for rearing, is much stronger than for pink salmon, which migrate into the ocean after fry emergence. the shallow degree of genetic structuring detected in prince william sound pink salmon relative to sockeye salmon is indicative of a more dispersive taxon with fewer barriers to gene flow (avise 1994). however, the small differences we found do not imply a transitory appearance of structuring which may vanish or shift among generations due to demographic changes (e.g., migration, population size). for example, the outlying status of upper la- goon creek indicated by both allozyme and mtdna data cannot be dismissed as an artifact caused by a recent bottleneck. such an event would also generate strong gametic disequilibria between allozyme (and other nuclear) loci detectable for many generations (waples & smouse 1990). this strong divergence may indicate a temporally stable phenomenon because gametic disequilibria within upper lagoon creek were not detected in this study. similar microgeographic stability has been demonstrated experimentally over four gener- ations in an upstream run of pink salmon re- turning to auke creek in southeastern alaska (lane et al. 1990). the gametic disequilibrium found between locus pairs within three streams may be the result of mix- tures of gene pools, genetic bottlenecks, physically linked loci, selection and/or type i1 error (waples & genetics of alaskan pink salmon smouse 1990). evidence from otolith-marked pink salmon adults released as fry from hatcheries in prince william sound indicate that some streams contain high proportions of hatchery fish which could result in gametic disequilibrium within collec- tions. however, when artificial collections were as- sembled consisting of all fish each from (1) the most genetically divergent collections and (2) the three most genetically divergent pairs of collections based on the three most significant locus pairs in gametic disequilibruim, no differences were detected. these statistical power tests do not support the hypothesis that the gametic disequilibrium that we detected was due to population mixing, and other causal mechanisms must be considered. future work will allow us to test temporal stability of gametic dis- equilibria within locations. comparison of allozyme and mtdna data comparison of differences between nuclear allo- zyme and mtdna markers is complicated by their distinct modes of inheritance and evolutionary dy- namics and the relative statistical power of the two data sets. similar male and female straying rates from coded-wire-tag data (habicht, unpublished; see habicht et al. 1998) permit excluding differences based on maternal inheritance of mtdna. still, its haploid and unisexual inheritance makes the effec- tive population size of the mtdna genome approxi- mately one fourth that of nuclear genes, magnifying the influence of genetic drift on the frequency of mtdna haplotypes (reviewed in allendorf 1994). this attribute theoretically enhances the power of mtdna markers for discriminating populations. in this study the comparative resolving power of allo- zymes was enhanced by larger sample size (mtdna n=40; allozyme n= loo), and both mtdna and al- lozyme variation had similar patterns in prince wil- liam sound, where most variation was found within collections and some upstream-tidal and regional differences were detected. details of variation given that panmixia does not exist for even-year pink salmon populations in prince william sound, we address aspects of population subdivision within the analytical hierarchy of this study. upstream and tidal collections. a contrast apparent from both data sets was the greater dissimilarity among the five upstream collections than among the 20 tidal collections. much of this difference was driven by upper lagoon creek, which also ex- plains much of the upstream heterogeneity within the east region as well as between this region and 133 seeb et al. the southeast and north regions. however, the upstream koppen creek collection was also dis- tinct from its tidal counterpart in the east region based on mtdna data. such divergence found only in upstream spawners suggests greater iso- lation and possible adaptive specialization among some of these populations. conversely, reduced though detectable heteroge- neity (e.g., table 5) among tidal collections indi- cates greater gene flow among tidal spawners. in prince william sound approximately 70% of even- year pink salmon spawn in tidal areas. straying of natural populations of pink salmon has been docu- mented to be between 0 and 20% (reviewed in heard 199 11, theoretically allowing them increased ability to successfully spawn in fluctuating habi- tats, characteristic of tidal areas (quinn 1984). tidal locations are likely to be more similar to each other than upstream locations, reducing selective pressure on pink salmon straying among tidal locations. further, tidal-spawning popula- tions were affected by tectonic shifts following the 1964 earthquake (uplift of up to 10 m, subsidence of up to 2 m; plafker & mayo 1965). this may have provided a homogenizing force through the transitory loss and creation of tidal spawning habi- tats, thus stimulating gene flow. additionally, di- rect effects of the exxon valdez oil spill on spawning habitat and populations would be limited to tidal locations. the need to better understand such effects has generated considerable recent literature (e.g., wells et al. 1995; rice et al. 1996) and instigated this study. effects of hatcheries. extensive hatchery releases in prince william sound warrant special consider- ation as a potential homogenizing force among the variety of ecotypes of even-year pink salmon. prin- ce william sound is the center of one of the world’s largest aquacultural industries. since 1987, about 600 million pink salmon fry of hatchery ori- gin have been released annually (morstad et al. 1998). during this time, the alaska department of fish & game has grappled with management of the wild populations in the face of hatchery-wild- stock interactions. proposals by hatchery oper- ators to change broodstocks, release early-run pink salmon in late-run areas, and use hatchery supplementation to augment natural spawning further cause concern. the present data provide some valuable insights. two of the four hatcheries located in prince wil- liam sound were included in this study, the armin f. koernig hatchery and the solomon gulch hatchery. a comparison of allozyme data of both hatcheries with the tidal collections (table 6a) pro- vides an interesting contrast. though only one of 134 the original even-year broodstock for the arm- in e koernig hatchery was a mixture of duck river (east region) and larsen creek (southwest region - hatchery site). annual propagation at the hatchery came from broodstock seined from fish milling in front of the hatchery and evidence from coded-wire-tag recoveries suggests that these mill- ing fish include wild fish (sharr et al. 1995). further, the armin e koernig hatchery is located adjacent to the strait through which most pink salmon enter prince william sound on their way to their spawning areas (templin et al. 1996); it is possible that wild fish included in the hatchery broodstock may come from throughout prince william sound. therefore, our finding that the ar- min e koernig hatchery fish were not distinct from tidal spawners from other regions (table 6) is concordant with a heterogeneous gene pool at the armin f. koernig hatchery. in contrast, the founding broodstock for the so- lomon gulch hatchery was obtained locally, and the hatchery is located at the end of valdez arm in the east region (fig. 1) where few pink salmon bound for other regions are likely to congregate. thus, the origin of broodstock and location of the solomon gulch hatchery appear to have main- tained a fairly pure regional stock compared to the armin e koernig hatchery. the solomon gulch hatchery comparisons was significant after adjustment for multiple tests, four of the five values were significant prior to adjust- ment compared with no pre-adjustment signifi- cance for the armin e koernig hatchery. after adding respective chi-square values and degrees of freedom, total armin e koernig hatchery com- parisons remained non-significant (p=0.301) while those of the solomon gulch hatchery became highly significant (p<o.ool). additionally, the ab- sence of extreme allozyme allele frequencies (ap- pendix a) further supports a heterogeneous gene pool for the armin e koernig hatchery. hatchery stocks and wild populations are sub- ject to different selection regimes through dissimi- lar incubation, rearing, and breeding conditions (e.g., hindar et al. 1991). although such domest- ication is unlikely to be directly detectable through the more or less neutral molecular markers used in this study, its existence in cultured salmonids is more than a theoretical abstraction (reisenbichl- er & mcintyre 1977; campton et al. 1991). no selection for some behavioral and developmental traits necessary in the wild occurs in prince willi- am sound hatcheries because gametes are collected and incubated in controlled conditions. for ex- ample, in the hatchery there is no selection for fish that can identify suitable spawning habitat, dig redds, successfully fertilize gametes, or guard redds. there is also no selection for embryos that can withstand extreme environmental conditions as might be found in wild systems. adaptive heterogeneity, (e.g., for microlocality, breeding date and duration, energy distribution; see hendry 1999) apparently characterizing natural breeding aggregates, cannot be perpetuated in large produc- tion hatcheries such as the armin e koernig hatchery or the solomon gulch hatchery. management implications. this initial detailed ex- amination of prince william sound pink salmon populations provides some valuable management information. recognition of population genetic structure is a first step in conserving genetic diver- sity within the natural evolutionary dynamics of pink salmon in prince william sound (utter et al. 1993). preservation of both suitable upstream and tidal habitats is important in some locations because their respective populations are not maintained by a common gene pool. in some streams, upstream riparian zones cannot be permitted to deteriorate with the expectation that a given upstream popula- tion is perpetuated from tidal straying. similarly, tidal heterogeneity confirms that harvest and hatchery management decisions should continue to be made on at least a geographical basis as op- posed to a species-specific basis. given the inevitable adaptive divergence of hatchery and wild populations, a key to effective management is to minimize the interactions of hatchery and wild fish. during the past 20 years, mixed-stock harvests of hatchery and wild fish have compromised some wild fish escapements. al- though few data exist on hatchery to wild straying, and interbreeding has not been measured in prince william sound, data from selected streams indi- cate high straying rates (sharr et al. 1995). an im- portant implication is that hatchery stocks should be developed and maintained with local stocks, and transfer of hatchery stocks between locations within prince william sound should be prohibited when ecological (genetic) diversity is threatened (cf., brannon 1993; utter et al. 1993). this need for isolated breeding and harvest of hatchery fish presents a challenge for hatchery operations in prince william sound to maintain the demo- graphic and genetic health of the wild populations. resumen 1. durante 1994 examinamos alozimas y adn mitocondrial de colecciones de oncorhynchus_gorbuscha walbaum, proceden- tes de dos piscifactorias, cinco cabeceras de rios y 20 localida- des inter-mareales de cinco regiones sujetas a gestion pesquera en prince william sound (pws), alaska. 2. para seleccionar 10s alozimas estudiamos 66 loci en grupos genetics of alaskan pink salmon de 92 y 100 peces por muestra. treinta y cuatro de estos loci tuvieron frecuencias alklicas >0.01 en una o mas colecciones y fueron utilizados para el analisis poblacional. tras seleccionar muestras de 40 peces por coleccion para estudiar variaciones en la region nd5/nd6 del adnmt, encontramos ocho haplotipos usando 6 restricciones de enzimas. 3. los analisis de ambos tipos de datos, adnmt y alozimas, mostraron diferencias significativas y aparentemente estables, lo que permite rechazar la hipbtesis nula de panmixia y, por lo tanto, apoyar la gesti6n independiente de poblaciones nativas a nivel regional en pws. 4. encontramos diferencias entre las colecciones de las cabece- ras y las zonas inter-mareales en lagoon creek (alozimas) y en koppen creek (adnmt) tambien encontramos heterogenei- dad regional entre las colecciones de las cabeceras (alozimas y adnmt) y de las zonas inter-mareales (alozimas), aunque las de las cabeceras de 10s rios fueron mas divergentes entre si que las de las zonas mareales. 5. la ausencia de diferenciacibn observada en individuos de la piscifactoria de armin e koernig procedentes de casi todas las regiones concuerda con su multiple origen; mientras que la poblacion de la piscifactoria de solomon gulch fue distinta de todas las regiones except0 de la del este, lo que apoya su origen mas restringido. acknowledgments sample collection could not have been done without a. craig and d. sarafin and the voluntary
