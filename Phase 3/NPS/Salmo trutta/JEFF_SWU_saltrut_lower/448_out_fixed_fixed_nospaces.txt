female–female competition in convict cichlids, beeching et al. 1998; male choice in pipeﬁsh, bergl- und et al. 1997; female choice in guppies, houde 1987). as carotenoids cannot be synthesized de novo in vertebrates, they must be obtained in the diet and then deposited in the signal in either unmodiﬁed or modiﬁed form (simpson et al. 1981). given that the acquisition, absorption, transport and modiﬁcation of carotenoids are energetically costly (hill 1996, 2000; olson & owens 1998; mcgraw et al. 2005), expres- sion of carotenoid-based colours may be dependent on an individual’s current energetic state (e.g., guppies, nicoletto 1993; stickleback, milinski & bakker 1990). alternatively, as reproductive individuals often have to balance conﬂicting energy demands during reproduc- tion (e.g., courtship vs. parental care, current vs. future reproduction, williams 1966; wootton 1994; sargent 1997; candolin 1999, 2000a,b), colour expression could also be dependent on the energy requirements of the entire reproductive sequence. in this case, the pattern of energy allocation both within and between reproductive cycles could be shaped by local selection pressures and may or may not result in correlations between condition and colour during speciﬁc repro- ductive stages. little is known about the relative importance of each of these mechanisms for colour expression, especially under natural conditions. in the threespine stickleback, gasterosteus aculeatus (l.), males complete several breeding cycles during each breeding season (sargent 1985; candolin 2000a). within a cycle, males build nests on the substratum, court females and then provide exclusive parental care. during reproduction, males develop an intense orange ⁄ red throat coloration that functions to attract females during the courtship stage and to repel 292 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00279.x rival male intrusions during both the courtship and parental stages (bakker 1994; rowland 1994; for reviews). comparisons of the relationship between condition and colour have found that this relationship can be highly variable both within and among populations of this stickleback (milinski & bakker 1990; fitzgerald et al. 1993; frischknecht 1993; bakker & mundwiler 1994; rowland 1994; hosking 1996; baube 1997; guderley & guevara 1998; candolin 1999, 2000a; kraak et al. 1999; rush et al. 2003; boughman 2007). in some cases, colour corre- lates positively with condition, which could indicate that colour expression is energetically costly (e.g., milinski & bakker 1990; bakker & mundwiler 1994; barber et al. 2000). however, observations under natural conditions do not uniformly support this possibility (fitzgerald et al. 1993; bakker & mundw- iler 1994; guderley & guevara 1998; barber et al. 2000). the more general pattern that is emerging is one in which males use both energy and carotenoids strategically during the breeding season in response to local selection pressures (e.g., frischknecht 1993; hosking 1996; baube 1997; candolin 1999, 2000a,b; rush et al. 2003). consistent with this pattern, the strategic storage and use of carotenoids has been identiﬁed in other ﬁsh species (e.g., sockeye salmon, crozier 1970; chum salmon, kitahara 1983). here we examine the relationship between repro- ductive costs, condition and colour in three lacustrine populations of threespine stickleback in the cook inlet region of alaska. two of these lakes (willow and big beaver) contain benthic (bottom-feeding) ecotypes and one (lynne) contains the limnetic (plankton- feeding) ecotype (foster 1995; foster et al. 1998). in willow and big beaver lakes, males defend their nests against cannibalistic groups of conspeciﬁcs that attack and consume young in the nests (foster 1995; foster et al. 1998). cannibalistic groups are absent from lynne lake (foster 1995; foster et al. 1998). males exposed to cannibalistic groups tend to spend more time defending nests and engaging in diversionary displays that divert the attention of foraging groups from the nest, than do those in populations from which cannibalistic groups are absent (foster 1994a,b; 1995; foster et al. 2007). males from populations without cannibalistic groups do not perform diversionary displays, even when groups of conspeciﬁcs approach low to the substratum (foster 1988, 1994a; ridgway & mcphail 1988). because nest defence can be energetically costly (smith & wootton 1995, 1999), we predicted that males from willow and big beaver lakes would pay higher energy costs during the parental stage than males from lynne lake. we also used stomach content analysis to determine whether males from willow and big beaver lakes were feeding less than males from lynne lake, which could also reproductive costs and stickleback colour contribute to energy-based reproductive costs. we then examined the relationship between reproductive costs, condition and male nuptial colour within each popu- lation. we predicted that if reproductive costs act as a constraint on colour expression, then males that pay signiﬁcant energy costs should decrease colour during the parental stage. in contrast, if energy costs alter the payoffs associated with allocation to current versus future reproduction, then males that pay signiﬁcant energy costs should increase signalling effort during current reproduction because the expectation of future reproduction may be low. methods fish collection stickleback were collected from three lakes in the matanuska-susitna valley in the cook inlet region of alaska, during june 1996–1997. nesting males were captured during their ﬁrst reproductive cycle from lynne lake (ly) and willow lake (wi) during 1996 and from lynne lake and big beaver lake (bb) during 1997. beginning in late may, males in these lakes move into the shallows and construct nests on the substra- tum. these males then court and receive eggs from multiple females, which they defend against nest predators. completion of a reproductive cycle typi- cally requires 2–3 weeks in g. aculeatus (wootton 1984). males were collected during two reproductive stages that represent the initial and ﬁnal stages of parental care: (1) courting (co) males were either observed courting a female or were defending nests that contained newly-laid eggs; (2) fry-guarding (fg) males were defending fry close to the nest. we used behavioural observations and nest inspections to determine the reproductive stage of each male. males were then immediately frozen using dry ice. for each population, sampling of both stages was completed within three consecutive days. in total, 238 ﬁsh were collected during the two years (1996: co = 20, fg = 20 per population; 1997: co = 60, fg = 20, lynne lake; co = 58, fg = 20, big bea- ver lake). the additional males collected in the 1997 samples allowed for a more robust measure of the relationship between colour and condition. following collection, the ﬁsh were transported to the university of kentucky (lexington, kentucky, usa) and held at )70 °c to prevent carotenoid degradation (simpson et al. 1981). (snorkelling) reproductive costs to quantify the energy-based costs of parental care for males in each population, we measured the change in 293 sparkes et al. condition between the co and fg stages. for each ﬁsh, we recorded standard length (mm) and body weight (g), and then calculated physical condition (using weight ⁄ length3 · 105, following ricker 1975). each ﬁsh was also examined for both external and intestinal parasites. males with parasites were ex- cluded from the analysis. to determine the initial condition of males in each population, we calculated the mean condition value for males collected in the co stage. the energy cost of parental care was then estimated by subtracting this value from the individual values obtained for males in the fg stage (negative values indicating a cost). this approach yielded one estimate of energy cost for every fg male present in the sample. we used a one-way anova with bonferroni-adjusted multiple compari- sons to compare the energy costs of reproduction between populations (following normality tests, systat 10). for this analysis, we combined the energy cost values obtained from lynne lake for the two samples (1996 and 1997) because they did not differ (unpaired t-test unequal variance: t13 = 0.8, p = 0.4). diet analysis as males from willow and big beaver lakes must defend nests against cannibalistic groups, they may have less time available to forage than males from lynne lake. to determine whether males differed among populations in either feeding activity or diet composition, we recorded stomach contents of males using a dissecting microscope. threespine stickleback typically consume prey items whole, which allows for both the identiﬁcation and enumeration of prey items to be completed relatively easily. for each male, we recorded both the number and type of prey present (i.e., crustaceans, insects or stickleback eggs). we considered the number of prey present a measure of recent feeding activity, and compared these values between populations using a kruskal–wallis test (zar 1999). we examined variation in prey type between populations by comparing percent occurrence values for each of the three prey types (% occurrence = num- ber of males that contained each prey type ⁄ total number of males examined for that population · 100, following hyslop 1980). in this calculation, males that consume more than one prey type are included in more than one category. thus, percent occurrence values can be above 100% when the values for more than one prey type are combined. the values obtained for each prey type during each reproductive stage were com- pared among populations individually using g-tests (sokal & rohlf 1995). for both the feeding activity and prey type analysis, we combined the two samples obtained from lynne lake (1996 and 1997) because they did not differ statistically (feeding activity, 294 mann–whitney u-test: co, u15,43 = 342.5; p = 0.7; fg, u9,11 = 43.5, p = 0.6; % occurrence, g-tests: crustaceans, co, g1 = 0.01, p > 0.7; fg, g1 = 0.2, p > 0.5; insects, co, g1 = 0.8, p > 0.2; fg, g1 = 0.4, p > 0.5; eggs, co, g1 = 0.4, p > 0.5, fg g1 = 0.1, p > 0.7). coloration we quantiﬁed colour for the males collected in the co and fg stages. these ﬁsh were dead, but retained coloration because they were ﬂash-frozen in the ﬁeld and stored in an ultra-freezer prior to use. for each ﬁsh we measured colour components by ﬁrst obtaining reﬂectance spectra and then converting these values to measures of colour components using principal com- ponent analysis (endler 1990; cuthill et al. 1999; grill & rush 2000). spectral measurements were made on a 1-mm diameter area of the ventral surface of the lower jaw (mid-line, between the eyes, 1 measure per ﬁsh). on the ﬁsh collected in 1996, we used an ocean optics ps-1000 portable spectrometer with a halogen light source (world precision instruments, model f-o- lite-h) and reﬂectance probe. reﬂectance spectra (400–750 nm) were calculated relative to a white standard of barium sulphate. on the ﬁsh collected in 1997, we used an oriel system, consisting of a sighting optic with nikon uv-transmissive macro-lens (105 mm), ﬁxed image compact spectrograph, oriel instaspecä iv (1024 by 256 ccd) and capture board. fish were illuminated with a 250-w stabilised xenon- arc light source (cvi-laser corp.). reﬂectance spectra (350–725 nm) were calculated relative to a white standard of spectrolon (labsphere). principal component analysis reduced the number of reﬂectance variables to three, which explained over 98% of the variation. from each pc value, a factor score was calculated, which is a weighted measure of that pc. differences in factor scores can be related to differences in brightness (pc1), chroma (pc2) and hue (pc3) (endler 1990; cuthill et al. 1999; grill & rush 2000). brightness is an overall measure of light intensity at all wavelengths. chroma is a measure of the saturation of the colour. colours with high chroma are pure, vibrant colours. hue is what is typically referred to as colour (e.g., yellow, red, blue; grill & rush 2000). however, brightness is typically removed from the analysis because pc1 measures can be unreliable (cuthill et al. 1999). we also recorded the inﬂection point of each reﬂectance curve to assess the validity of using pc3 as a measure of hue (following grill & moore 1998). the typical curve obtained from the orange ⁄ red throat of male g. aculeatus is sigmoi- dal and the inﬂection point indicates the wavelength at which the curve switches from accelerating to decel- erating. the higher the value of the inﬂection point, the further the reﬂectance curve is shifted into the red region of the spectrum. thus, males that have ‘red’ throats will have inﬂection points at longer wave- lengths than males that have ‘orange’ throats. we examined the relationship between pc3 and inﬂection point within each populations using pearson correla- tion analysis (systat 10). to determine the relationship between condition and colour, we used two approaches. first, we examined whether colour (pc2 and pc3) was condi- tion-dependent within stages using pearson correlation analysis. we then examined changes in colour (pc2 and pc3) between the co and fg stages. for this analysis, we compared colour values using anova. when colour measures correlated with either condition or body size (length), we used ancova (following tests for homogeneity of slopes, systat 10). results reproductive costs of the 238 stickleback collected from the three lakes, 173 (73%) were used in the analysis (lynne 1996 = 60%, n = 24; lynne 1997 = 68%, n = 54; willow = 88%, n = 35; big beaver = 77%, n = 60). the other males were excluded because they were parasitised (n = 61, infected with cestodes, nematodes or trematodes) or because one or more of the colour measures (pc2 and pc3) was an outlier (n = 4). for the remaining males, we found that there was signif- icant variation among populations in the energy costs of parental care (fig. 1, f2,52 = 9.8, p < 0.001). multiple comparisons revealed that males from wil- low and big beaver lakes paid higher energy costs than males from lynne lake. these costs translated into a decrease in condition of 10% and 13% for males s e u l a v e c n e r e f f i d 0.30 0.15 0.00 –0.15 –0.30 a b ly wi population b bb fig. 1. energy costs of parental care in lynne lake (ly), willow lake (wi) and big beaver lake (bb). shown are mean values (±se) for parental cost in each population. letters associated with each bar indicate signiﬁcant differences (following bonferroni corrections). reproductive costs and stickleback colour from willow and big beaver lakes, respectively. in contrast, males from lynne lake did not appear to experience a signiﬁcant change in condition during the parental stage (1996: decrease of 1.5%; 1997: increase of 2.5%). diet analysis almost all the males had prey in their stomachs (ly = 100%, n = 78; wi = 97%, n = 35; bb = 97%, n = 60). values obtained for feeding activity are summarised in table 1. we found that prey number did not differ among populations during the co stage but did differ during the fg stage. during this stage, males from willow and big beaver lakes contained fewer prey items than males from lynne lake (bb vs. ly, q3 = 2.9, p < 0.02, wi vs. ly, q3 = 2.7, p < 0.05; wi vs. bb, q3 = 0.4, p > 0.5). examina- tion of diet composition (% occurrence) revealed that there was also signiﬁcant variation among populations in the relative contribution of each prey type to the diet. during the co stage, males from lynne lake were more likely to contain insects than males from the other lakes, whereas males from willow lake were more likely to contain both stickleback eggs and crustaceans than males from lynne lake. males from big beaver lake were intermediate to the others for both eggs and crustaceans. there were no detectable differences in diet composition among populations during the fg stage. as we did not collect data on the type of prey present in the environment, it is unclear whether the diet composition values are reﬂective of prey availability in each lake. coloration using the values obtained from the reﬂectance spectra, we estimated inﬂection points and obtained measures for pc2 and pc3 for individuals during each repro- ductive stage. table 2 summarises the inﬂection point data. for these values, an increase in inﬂection point during the parental stage indicates a shift in colour (hue) from more orange to more red. correlation analysis revealed that pc3 correlated signiﬁcantly with inﬂection point in all four groups (ly 96: r = 0.78, p < 0.001, n = 24; ly 97: r = 0.80, p < 0.001, n = 54; wi: r = 0.49, p = 0.003, n = 35; bb: r = 0.46, p < 0.001, n = 60). thus, variation in pc3 correlated with variation in colour (hue) in these populations. the relationship between condition and colour (pc2 = chroma and pc3 = hue) during the co and fg stages is shown in table 3 and fig. 2. condition did not correlate with pc2 during the co stage for any of the populations but did correlate with pc2 during the fg stage for lynne lake males during both years. 295 sparkes et al. prey number % occurrence – co % occurrence – fg co fg insects eggs crustaceans insects eggs crustaceans ly wi bb h3 g2 8.0 (10) 8.5 (13) 8.5 (8) 0.3 ns – 10.5 (9)a 5.0 (4)b 4.0 (4)b 10.7** – 95a 63b 70b – 15.3*** 45a 75b 64ab – 7.4* 31a 75b 43ab – 10.2** 90 87 94 – 20 10 6 – 45 68 38 – 0.6 ns 1.6 ns 3.8 ns shown are median values for prey number (interquartile ranges in parentheses) and percent occurrence values. test statistics for each test along with degrees of freedom are also shown (kruskal–wallis test – h3, g-test – g2). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005 and superscript alphabets indicate signiﬁcant differences between populations. table 1. feeding activity (prey number) and diet composition (% occurrence) for courting (co) and fry-guarding (fg) males from lynne (ly), willow (wi) and big beaver (bb) lakes. table 2. inﬂection points (mean ± se) obtained from the reﬂectance spec- tra for courting (co) and fry-guarding (fg) males from lynne lake (ly 96 and ly 97), willow lake (wi) and big beaver lake (bb). population ly 96 ly 97 wi bb n 15 43 16 44 co 581 (2.9) 589 (0.8) 591 (2.5) 587 (0.5) n 9 11 19 16 fg 586 (1.4) 593 (1.5) 581 (2.7) 587 (0.7) table 3. relationship between colour components and condition for males from lynne lake (ly 96 and ly 97), willow lake (wi) and big beaver lake (bb) for courting (co) and fry-guarding (fg) males. co n 15 43 16 44 population ly 96 ly 97 wi bb pc2 0.44 )0.19 )0.18 )0.14 pc3 )0.51 0.12 )0.58 )0.16 fg n 9 11 19 16 pc2 0.77 )0.60 0.05 0.24 pc3 )0.24 )0.47 )0.08 0.22 shown are pearson correlation coefﬁcients with signiﬁcant correlations indicated in boldface. however, the direction of this relationship differed between years (1996 – positive and 1997 – negative). condition only correlated with pc3 for one of the groups (willow, co stage). for this group, males that were in better physical condition had lower pc3 values than did those in poorer condition, indicating that males in better condition were more orange and males in poor condition were more red. comparisons of colour changes between reproduc- tive stages revealed differences among populations in the pattern of colour change during the parental phase (fig. 2). for males from lynne lake [fig. 2 (a–d)], pc2 and pc3 values did not change between stages sample (1996, pc2, ancova, condi- for either tion = covariate: f1,21 = 0.1, p = 0.8; pc3, anova: ancova, f1,22 = 3.3, length = covariate: f1,51 = 0.2, p = 0.7; pc3, anco- va, length = covariate: f1,51 = 0.3, p = 0.6). in con- trast, for males from willow lake [fig. 2(e–f)], values p = 0.08; 1997, pc2, 296 for pc2 increased (anova: f1,33 = 9.0, p = 0.005) and values for pc3 decreased (ancova, length = covariate: f1,32 = 30.4, p < 0.001) between the co and fg stages. this latter change represents a shift from individuals that are more red to individuals that are more orange during the parental phase. for males from big beaver lake [fig. 2(g,h)], pc3 did not change between stages (anova: f1,58 = 1.4, p = 0.2), but pc2 values increased between stages in a size- dependent manner. that there was a positive correlation between pc2 and body size for fg males (length, r = 0.70, p = 0.003) but not for co males (r = 0.01, p = 0.9). this size-related difference in colour resulted in heterogeneous slopes for pc2 and body size between stages (f1,56 = 11.6, p < 0.001), which precluded the use of ancova. is, discussion parental care can be energetically costly in threespine stickleback (chellappa et al. 1989; fitzgerald et al. 1989; dufresne et al. 1990; smith & wootton 1999) and other ﬁsh (coleman & fischer 1991; gillooly & baylis 1999; mackereth et al. 1999; skolbekken & utne-palm 2001), and these costs can differ among populations (steinhart et al. 2004) as we demonstrate here. males from the benthic willow and big beaver lake populations declined in condition more during the parental stage than did males from the limnetic lynne lake population. in addition, males from willow and big beaver lakes had fewer prey items in their stomachs during the fg stage than did males from lynne lake. these changes are consistent with the interpretation that defence against cannibalistic groups imposes both foraging and energy costs on males in willow and big beaver lakes and that these costs are not a factor for males in lynne lake. our results are also consistent with the interpreta- tion that differential changes in condition could have an inﬂuence on colour expression in these populations. this could occur in two ways. first, if the production and maintenance of colour is sufﬁciently costly (e.g., reproductive costs and stickleback colour co fg pc2 * 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 pc3 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 * 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 (b) 1.6 0.8 0.0 –0.8 –1.6 1.0 (d) 8 4 0 (f) (h) –4 –8 0.8 2 1 0 –1 –2 0.8 6 3 0 –3 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 –6 2.0 0.8 condition 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 (a) 8 4 0 –4 –8 1.0 20 10 0 (c) * –10 –20 0.8 (e) 6 3 0 –3 –6 0.8 (g) 20 10 0 –10 –20 0.8 fig. 2. relationship between colour com- ponents (pc2 = chroma, pc3 = hue) and condition for courting (co) and fry-guard- ing (fg) males.

chellappa et al. 1989; dufresne et al. 1990; raffetto et al. 1990; sabat 1994; smith & wootton 1994), energy costs could inﬂuence signalling effort during current reproduction by altering the relationship between current and future reproduction (trade-off hypothesis; williams 1966; sargent 1997). under this scenario, males that experience signiﬁcant energy costs during a reproductive cycle should be more intensely coloured in initial than later reproductive cycle(s) because the expectation of future reproduction is low (e.g., candolin 1999, 2000a). here we use our data to evaluate the likelihood that each of these mechanisms contributes to variation in colour expression among populations of stickleback. males from lynne lake did not decline in condition between reproductive stages, nor did their nuptial colour change. within stages, there was no consistent correlation between condition and colour, either. correlations were only observed between pc2 and condition in the fg stages, and they differed in direction between years. thus, variation in colour was typically independent of condition in this population. in contrast, willow males declined signiﬁcantly in condition between stages. this decline was accompa- nied by both an increase in chroma (pc2) and a shift in hue (pc3) from red to orange. within stages, pc2 did not correlate with condition and pc3 correlated with condition only during the courtship stage. during this stage, males in good condition were orange whereas males in poor condition were red (indicated by the negative relationship in fig. 2f). these results do not support the hypothesis that energy constraints imposed by reproduction determine colour expression as chroma (pc2) increased, rather than decreased, during the fg stage. the negative correlation between hue and condition during courtship could potentially indicate that orange is energetically costly to produce. however, these males became more orange during the fg stage when condition decreased. therefore, the colour changes that occur in willow lake males during the reproductive cycle are most consistent with the hypothesis that a trade-off between current and future reproduction mediates colour expression. males in willow lake decreased in condition by approximately 10% between stages. similar declines in condition are correlated with an increase in post- reproductive mortality and a decrease in the number of reproductive cycles male complete in g. aculeatus (sargent 1985; chellappa et al. 1989; dufresne et al. 1990). in addition, laboratory studies have shown that experimental reduction in condition results in an increase in the colour of male g. aculeatus (hosking 1996; baube 1997; candolin 1999). thus, according to the trade-off hypothesis, males in willow lake 298 could beneﬁt by increasing signalling effort during the initial reproductive cycle (williams 1966; sargent 1997) and this could explain the transition in male nuptial colour we observed in this population. males from big beaver lake also decreased in condition (approximately 13%) during the reproduc- tive cycle, and changed colour between stages. in this population, however, chroma increased in a size- dependent manner, such that larger fg males exhib- ited greater values for chroma, but hue did not change. there was also no correlation between condition and colour within reproductive stages. this pattern of colour variation is also inconsistent with the hypoth- esis that energy constraints imposed by reproduction within a cycle determine colour expression, as chroma increased, at least in large males. these observations are more compatible with the trade-off hypothesis but only if the expectation of future reproduction is size- dependent. that is, because chroma correlated posi- tively with body size in the fg stage, large males would be expected to have a lower expectation of future reproduction than small males. this relationship is plausible as small males in this population are likely to be 1-year olds, and large males, 2-year olds (baker ja, unpublished data). however, willow lake also contains a mixture of small 1-year olds and large 2-year olds (baker ja, unpublished data) but chroma did not correlate with body size during the fg stage in this lake. thus, for the trade-off hypothesis to explain variation in chroma in both big beaver and willow the energy costs imposed by lakes requires that reproduction inﬂuence the expectation of future reproduction in different ways in the two lakes. in sum, our results are most consistent with the hypothesis that colour changes within populations are inﬂuenced by the effects of energy-based reproductive costs on the expectation of future reproduction. this possibility is supported by detailed proﬁles of tagged males in one benthic and one limnetic population indicating that males exposed to cannibalistic groups are unlikely to complete a second reproductive cycle, whereas those not so inﬂuenced in a limnetic popu- lation can complete as many as three reproductive cycles (foster et al. 2007). although suggestive, multi-year studies on several populations of each ecotype will be necessary to resolve the relationships between colour and condition in populations experi- encing different costs of reproduction. an alternative explanation for some of the colour changes observed in willow and big beaver lakes may be that the increased chroma during the parental stage functions to deter nest attacks by cannibalistic groups. parental male stickleback in benthic popula- tions engage in conspicuous diversionary displays when cannibalistic groups approach their territories (foster 1988, 1994a). during these displays, males then swim out of if successful, their bodies so that often tilt their coloration is exposed, presumably to attract the attention of the group, the territory and dig aggressively in the substratum. the group members follow the male and dig in the same area. thus, increased chroma may improve the likelihood that a parental male successfully diverts attacks on his nest. however, given that the colour change was size-dependent in big beaver lake, large males in this lake would be expected to have a higher risk of nest detection than small males for this mechanism to explain the relationship between body size and colour expression. a second alternative explanation for the colour changes could be that the differences reﬂect inherent variation in male colour that appear to be a stage- related change because of the approach used to collect the ﬁsh samples. for each population, we captured all males over a three-day period during their ﬁrst reproductive cycle. thus males collected in the fg stage would have mated earlier than the males collected in the courtship stage. if the ﬁrst males to mate were also more intensely coloured, and they retained that colour during the parental stage, then the colour change identiﬁed in this study could be due to inherent differences in colour between the two groups of males. similarly, if males in willow and big beaver lakes have to wait longer to receive eggs from females than males from lynne lake, then these males may be in poorer condition during the parental stage than males from lynne lake. at this time, we cannot exclude these possible explanations. carotenoid availability, either in the diet or in the signal, could also explain some of the colour variation observed within or among these populations (e.g., grether et al. 1999; faivre et al. 2003). carot- enoid limitation in the diet seems an unlikely explanation for colour variation; however, because an increase in chroma in willow and big beaver lakes was associated with reduced feeding as indi- cated by stomach contents. if, however, carotenoids present in the signal during courtship were mobilised for use elsewhere during the fg stage, a change in carotenoid composition of the signal could have caused the hue shift observed in willow lake males. threespine stickleback males that have a large amount of astaxanthin tend to be red, whereas those with a large amount of lutein and tunaxanthin tend to be yellow or orange (wedekind et al. 1998; barber et al. 2000). thus, an increase in metabolic require- ments for astaxanthin could result in speciﬁc mobil- isation of this carotenoid, and in the shift in hue seen in willow lake. previous studies have identiﬁed stress-related mobilisation of carotenoids in both brown_trout (steven 1948) and atlantic salmon (nordgarden et al. 2003). however, a similar shift reproductive costs and stickleback colour in hue did not occur in the big beaver males although these males experienced a similar type of energy stress. given this discrepancy, is also plausible that the shift in hue observed in willow lake males was due to a population-speciﬁc effect, which was not accounted for in this analysis. it the direction of boughman (2007) has recently shown that limnetic male threespine stickleback, in limnetic–benthic spe- cies pairs, exhibit strong positive correlations between condition and colour (area and intensity); but that both benthics and anadromous forms do not. this differ- ence was proposed to be due to strong directional selection acting on limnetic males. the results obtained for lynne, willow and big beaver lakes did not appear to be consistent with this relationship. instead, we found that colour was only condition- dependent during the courtship stage for one popula- tion of benthics (willow lake). in addition, when colour was condition-dependent in the limnetic males (fg stage), the relationship was inconsistent between years. however, our measures of colour were restricted to colour components obtained from reﬂectance spectra and did not include either colour area or human-based measures of colour (both of which were included in the other study). thus, a more comprehensive approach that incorporates more colour variables is required to assess this relationship more directly in these populations (see rowe et al. 2006 for a recent discussion of colour measurement in threespine stickleback). in addition, males from both willow and big beaver lakes express less colour during the courtship stage than males from lynne lake (hulslander 2003). thus, identifying condition- dependent relationships in benthic populations may be problematic because of the lack of variation in colour during the courtship stage. benthic and limnetic populations of stickleback differ predictably both in reproductive behaviour and nuptial coloration. males in limnetic populations are brighter during courtship than are those in benthic populations, and exhibit more conspicuous courtship, differences thought due to plastic responses to chronic, stressful interactions with cannibalistic groups in benthic populations (foster 1994a,b, 1995; foster et al. 1998, 2007; hulslander 2003; shaw et al. 2007). however, males of both ecotypes from northwestern north america are intensely coloured during the fg stage in both lab and ﬁeld (mclennan & mcphail 1989; hulslander 2003), and our results indicate that differences in colour expression at this time could reﬂect differences in condition and the expectation of future reproduction between the ecotypes. however, the variation in colour expression identiﬁed in the populations studied here could also be due to direct effects of nest predation on male colour pattern. we propose that a detailed understanding of the 299 sparkes et al. relationships among energy-based reproductive costs, post-reproductive mortality, and the pattern of energy allocation within a breeding season coupled with information concerning the risk of nest predation within each population should yield valuable insights into variation in nuptial colour of threespine stickle- back in nature. acknowledgements this work was supported by nsf (deb-9253718, ger- 9355093, deb-9728892), nimh (t32mh19917-01a1, 5r03mh57826-02), university of kentucky (ofﬁce of re- search and graduate studies) and depaul university (univer- sity research council). john baker, brooke brander, bill cresko, christie donaldson, kara gaetke, denise hoskins, cristin hulslander and rich king assisted in data collection. colour measurements were recorded in craig sargent’s lab at the university of kentucky. critical guidance on different versions of the manuscript were provided by john baker, mickey rowe, bob scott, deborah mclennan and two anonymous reviewers. lizbeth rodriguez provided help with translation. references bakker, t.c.m. 1994. evolution of aggressive behaviour in the threespine stickleback. in: bell, m.a. & foster, s.a., eds. the evolutionary biology of the threespine stickleback. new york: oxford university press, pp. 345–380. bakker, t.c.m. & mundwiler, b. 1994. female mate choice and male red coloration in a natural three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) population. behavioral ecology 5: 74–80. barber, i., arnott, s.a., braithwaite, v.a., andrew, j., mullen, w. & huntingford, f.a. 2000. carotenoid-based sexual coloration and body condition in nesting male sticklebacks. journal of fish biology 57: 777–790. baube, c.l. 1997. manipulations of signalling environment affect male competitive success in three-spined sticklebacks. animal behaviour 53: 819–833. beeching, s.c., gross, s.h., bretz, h.s. & hariatis, e. 1998. sexual dichromatism in convict cichlids: the ethological signiﬁcance of female ventral coloration. animal behaviour 56: 1021–1026. berglund, a., rosenqvist, g. & bernet, p. 1997. ornamentation predicts reproductive success in female pipeﬁsh. behavioral ecology and sociobiology 40: 145–150. boughman, j.w. 2007. condition-dependent expression of red colour differs between stickleback species. journal of evolutionary biology 20: 1577–1590. candolin, u. 1999. the relationship between signal quality and physical condition: is sexual signalling honest in the three- spined stickleback? animal behaviour 58: 1261–1267. candolin, u. 2000a. changes in expression and honesty of sexual signalling over the reproductive lifetime of stickle- backs. proceedings of the royal society of london, series b 267: 2425–2430. 300 candolin, u. 2000b. increased signalling effort when survival prospects decrease: male–male competition ensures honesty. animal behaviour 60: 417–422. chellappa, s., huntingford, f.a., strang, r.h.c. & thomson, r.y. 1989. annual variation in energy reserves in male three- spined stickleback, gasterosteus aculeatus l.
