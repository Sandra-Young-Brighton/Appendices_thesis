wedderburn & hammer 2003). this study is part of a continuing investigation of the reasons whereby c. s. fulvus remains widespread in the lower murray, whereas c. and abundant ﬂuviatilis is patchily distributed. it characterises the habitats occupied by the two species and associated ﬁsh. the aims were to identify the variables that govern the presence and abundance of each species, and to highlight the likely causes of separation. the ﬁndings are viewed in relation to other comparative studies of similar species. materials and methods fish sampling s. range of c. ﬂuviatilis and c. sampling was conducted at 22 sites between december 2004 and april 2005, within the known fulvus extant (fig. 1). these included sites where c. ﬂuviatilis has been recorded previously (lloyd & walker 1986; s. d. wedderburn, unpublished data; south australian museum records). off-channel sites only were sampled, as there are no records of c. ﬂuviatilis from the main channel. fyke nets were selected above other sampling methods (e.g., seine nets) because among macrophytes, soft sediments and woody debris (thus, repeatable results), and capture most off-channel ﬁsh species in the lower murray (b. b. smith and d. fleer, south australian research and develop- ment institute, unpublished data). although a few species may have avoided capture, the choice of method was based on optimal (for taxa including craterocephalus) than comprehensive per- formance at a microhabitat level. they perform consistently well rather fish were sampled with four single-leader fyke nets (5-mm half mesh) set overnight for 12 h, within 1–2 h of sunset and sunrise, and for 4 h during the day. the mesh size allowed the capture of ﬁsh >15 mm tl, including juveniles and adults. nets were set 10 m apart, perpendicular to the bank, with the leader attached to a post at the water’s edge (ﬁrst and third nets) or in open water (second and fourth nets). all captured ﬁsh were identiﬁed and counted, but carp gudgeons (eleotridae) were combined as hypseleotris spp. due to taxonomic uncertainties (cf. bertozzi et al. habitat separation of craterocephalus fig. 1. field sampling sites on the river murray. 2000). voucher specimens of c. ﬂuviatilis have been lodged at the south australian museum, adelaide. habitat (<10 cm diameter) or ‘habitat complexity’ was measured quantitatively using eight 10-m transects set 5 m apart, the ﬁrst being 2.5 m to the left of the ﬁrst fyke net. objects in the water directly below each 1 m point were recorded. ‘submerged macrophytes’ were identiﬁed to species where possible, and given one point per occurrence. ‘woody debris’ and ‘rocks’ were scored as one point two points (>10 cm) (cf. kinsolving & bain 1990). ‘habitat openness’ was the number of points that scored zero in the sampling area. ‘habitat patchiness’ was the combined number of times that scores changed to and from zero within each transect, excluding the start and ﬁnish. ‘macrophyte species richness’ was the total number of species in the sampling area. the percent- age of emergent macrophytes in the sampling area was estimated and categorised (£5%, 6–10%, 11–15%, 16–20%). the percentage of riparian vegetation cover in a 35 · 10 m area adjacent and parallel to the aquatic sampling area was estimated and categorised (£25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, 76–100%). ‘average water depth’ was derived from ﬁve measurements taken at 2-m intervals, beginning 2 m from the water’s edge, through the centre of the sampling area. depth measurements were used also to determine the littoral gradient. secchi depth was recorded. sediment grain size was estimated visually (viz. silt, silt/sand, sand). dissolved oxygen was measured using a wp-82 meter, and salinity and temperature were measured using a wp-84 meter (tps pty ltd, brisbane, australia). 443 wedderburn et al. analysis data were analysed by non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (nms) ordination using the relative sørensen in pc-ord (ver. 4.36, mccune & distance metric, grace 2002). indicator species analysis (dufreˆne & legendre 1997) was used to characterise the ﬁsh assemblages associated with three categories of abundance of c. ﬂuviatilis low, high). response curves for c. ﬂuviatilis and c. s. fulvus in relation to habitat variables were derived by nonpara- metric multiplicative regression using hyperniche (ver. 1.0, mccune & mefford 2004). this is a tool for habitat models where the predictors are combined multiplicatively, rather than additively; it is used to estimate the likelihood of the occurrence of species in relation to various habitat parameters (see mccune 2006). (absent, results fish over 20 native ﬁsh species, including at least three hypseleotris spp. and four exotic species, were recorded (table 1). philypnodon grandiceps and the exotic gambusia holbrooki were the only species recorded at all sites. species captured at fewer than four sites, namely the short-ﬁnned eel anguilla australis, southern pygmy perch nannoperca australis and yarra pygmy perch nannoperca obscura, were removed from the ordination analysis. craterocephalus ﬂuviatilis was recorded at 11 sites, with high numbers (191–1221 table 1. fish species captured in ﬁeld sampling. ﬁsh) at four saline sites (>3&) that were completely or partially isolated from the main channel, and low numbers (2–17 ﬁsh) elsewhere (table 2). cratero- cephalus stercusmuscarum fulvus was captured at 13 sites that were fully or partially connected to the main channel, four of which also contained low numbers of c. ﬂuviatilis (salinities 0.4, 0.9, 1.5 and 6.9&). habitat recorded variations were salinity for wide )1), water (0.14–19.80&), dissolved oxygen (4–12 mgæl temperature (16–28 °c), secchi depth (18–110 cm) and average water depth (30–71 cm). macrophyte richness varied from two to nine species. submerged species of widgeon grass ruppia and water milfoil myriophyllum (3–20&) dominated saline and slightly saline (0.4–1.5&) sites, respectively. low-salinity sites (<0.4&) had a more diverse macrophyte assemblage, typically with ribbon weed vallisneria americana michx. and curly pondweed potomogeton crispus l. ordination analysis the data yielded a two-dimensional ordination (stress 16%), indicating three distinct groups (fig. 2). multi- response permutation procedure (mrpp) conﬁrmed that the groups are signiﬁcantly different (p < 0.001). salinity is the variable most strongly associated with ﬁsh assemblage structure, particularly on axis 1 (correlation score: r ¼ 0.79). secchi depth and ruppia show similar trends on axis 1 (r ¼ 0.57, 0.53, respectively). there is a between axis salinity and family taxon common name number of sites total captured anguilla australis richardson, 1841 nematalosa erebi (gu¨nther, 1868) retropinna semoni (weber, 1895) galaxias maculatus (jenyns, 1842) melanotaenia ﬂuviatilis (castelnau, 1878) atherinosoma microstoma (gu¨nther, 1861) craterocephalus ﬂuviatilis mcculloch, 1912 craterocephalus stercusmuscarum fulvus ivantsoff, crowley & allen, 1987 macquaria ambigua ambigua (richardson, 1845) nannoperca australis gu¨nther, 1861 nannoperca obscura (klunzinger, 1872) pseudaphritis urvillii (valenciennes, 1832) philypnodon grandiceps (krefft, 1864) philypnodon sp.

table 3). distinctive ﬁsh assemblages are identi- ﬁed for each category and correspond to the groups identiﬁed in the ordination. the atherinid species are signiﬁcant indicators in three separate assemblages. where c. ﬂuviatilis was absent, signiﬁcant indica- tors include hypseleotris spp. (p ¼ 0.001), nemata- losa erebi (p ¼ 0.011) and c. s. fulvus (p ¼ 0.021). where c. ﬂuviatilis was uncommon, signiﬁcant indi- cators are a. microstoma (p ¼ 0.003), p. olorum (p ¼ 0.005), t. lasti (p ¼ 0.016) and g. maculatus (p ¼ 0.002), and the exotic c. carpio (p ¼ 0.045) and p. ﬂuviatilis (p ¼ 0.020). where c. ﬂuviatilis was abundant, the associated assemblage is least diverse and g. holbrooki and p. grandiceps are nonsigniﬁcant indicator species. predicted salinity responses habitat modelling identiﬁed only salinity as a factor describing the separation of c. ﬂuviatilis and c. s. fulvus (fig. 4). the model predicts a bell-shaped response to salinity for c. ﬂuviatilis, with an optimum at approximately 13& and an upper limit of >20&. the model also predicts an inverse relationship to salinity for c. s. fulvus, with peak abundance at <5& and an upper limit of <20&. discussion habitat characterisation each atherinid species is associated with a distinctive habitat and is a signiﬁcant indicator species in its respective assemblage. the habitat of a. microstoma is not adequately deﬁned here because the survey 446 focused on craterocephalus. its salinity range extends to at least 94& in the estuary (molsher et al. 1994), below barrages that regulate ﬂow to the murray mouth, where craterocephalus is absent. the habitat of c. ﬂuviatilis is distinguished in two ways. first, in reaches several hundred kilometres upstream of the murray mouth, it occurs in shallow (<0.5 m), saline (3–20&) waters that are completely or partially isolated from the main river channel, with scant woody debris and a few macrophyte species (predomi- nantly ruppia). in that region, c. ﬂuviatilis often is highly abundant in sparse assemblages that otherwise include only p. grandiceps and g. holbrooki. secondly, in the lower reaches it occurs in shallow (<0.5 m), slightly saline water (ca. 1&) that is partially or fully connected to the channel, in habitats dominated by the macrophyte myriophyllum. in these habitats, c. ﬂuvi- atilis occurs in low numbers, in a diverse assemblage dominated by diadromous and estuarine species inclu- ding a. microstoma. in off-channel areas of the lower river murray, the habitats of c. s. fulvus typically are partially or fully connected to the channel, deeper (>0.5 m) and less saline (<0.4&), with diverse macrophytes and abun- dant woody debris. the associated ﬁsh assemblage is diverse and consists of obligate freshwater species, including hypseleotris spp., n. erebi, philypnodon sp. and melanotaenia ﬂuviatilis. craterocephalus ﬂuvia- 1000 600 c. fluviatilis 200 c. s. fulvus e c n a d n u b a d e t c d e r p  i 0 0 5 10 salinity (‰) 15 20 fig. 4. predicted responses to salinity by craterocephalus ﬂuvia- tilis (11 sites) and craterocephalus stercusmuscarum fulvus (13 sites) derived from nonparametric multiplicative regression. tilis is absent. incidentally, c. s. fulvus also occurs in the main channel and upper reaches of the murray, where habitat (e.g., water velocity) and ﬁsh assem- blages differ from sites sampled in this study. habitat complexity habitat complexity inﬂuences foraging efﬁciency, predation and recruitment in ﬁsh assemblages (win- ﬁeld 1986; rozas & odum 1988; savino & stein 1989; hayes et al. 1996). submerged macrophytes often are signiﬁcant, providing invertebrates as food and a refuge from predators (keast 1984; rozas & odum 1988; pusey et al. 1993; weaver et al. 1997). in wetlands the murray mouth (above the barrages), myriophyllum is associated with diverse ﬁsh assemblages that include a. microstoma with c. s. fulvus or c. ﬂuviatilis. the apparent link between craterocepha- lus and myriophyllum warrants more investigation (cf. weaver et al. 1997). several kilometres upstream of in saline wetlands several hundred kilometres upstream of the murray mouth, there is an apparent association between the submerged macrophyte ruppia and a ﬁsh assemblage dominated by c. ﬂuviatilis. a similar pattern is reported by lyon & ryan (2005). the physiological attributes of c. ﬂuviatilis enabling it to inhabit saline water may be paramount, regardless of habitat complexity attributes. salinity limit it the upper ‘slow acclimation’ salinity contributes towards the segregation of the two craterocephalus species. field records suggest for c. ﬂuviatilis is >20& that (chessman & williams 1974; lyon & ryan 2005). further, the upper ld50 for c. s. fulvus is 43.7& (williams & williams under 1991). in the present study, the peak salinity of capture for this species was 6.9&, which matches other ﬁeld observations (chessman & williams 1974). craterocephalus ﬂuviatilis, therefore, inhabits a wider salinity range than c. s. fulvus, and indeed, most other murray ﬁsh species (cf. chessman & williams 1974; hart et al. 1991). under current regulated conditions, the fragmentation of c. ﬂuvi- atilis populations appears to be related to salinity, but this is due to the physiological effects of salinity, to the effects of salinity on other factors (e.g., habitat complexity, competition, predation), or a combination of both. importantly, salinity levels in the murray-darling basin have risen considerably over few decades (goss 2003); the ﬁndings do not necessarily reﬂect patterns that occurred before the population decline of c. ﬂuviatilis. is unclear whether the last habitat separation of craterocephalus freshwater habitats (<0.4&) had more habitat complexity than saline sites, and macrophyte commu- there were dominated by p. crispus and nities v. americana. there is an association between macr- ophyte species richness, low salinity and the presence of c. s. fulvus. the absence of c. ﬂuviatilis at these sites suggests that physiological factors may be responsible, although there could conceivably be competitive exclusion by other ﬁsh, including the abundant c. s. fulvus. the distributions of ﬁsh often are determined by physiological tolerances to temperature, salinity or ph (davenport & sayer 1993). interactions between species are also important, but tend to diminish with increasing environmental ‘harshness’ (e.g., ross 1986; jackson et al. 2001). many craterocephalus species are able to tolerate ﬂuctuating salinity (milton & arthington 1983; allen et al. 2005), and the euryhaline preferences of c. ﬂuviatilis are clear (wedderburn & hammer 2003; lyon & ryan 2005). the reasons for its absence in freshwater are less apparent. further studies are needed to discover whether salinity is the key segregator of the congeners, ﬁrstly by comparing their osmoregulatory abilities. studies may also examine whether c. ﬂuviatilis is a poor competitor and is thereby able to persist in saline habitats that exclude potential competitors. comparative studies factors causing the studies of congeners may yield insights into the ecological segregation and fragmentation of populations (e.g., bettoli & morris 1991; bryce et al. 2002). one of the most often- identiﬁed segregators interspeciﬁc competition (e.g., crombie 1947; werner & hall 1976, 1977; nakano et al. 1999), although differences in physio- logical tolerances and adaptations to physical factors (e.g., ﬂow variability) also may be signiﬁcant (e.g., schlosser & toth 1984; schlosser 1985; greenberg 1988; poff & allan 1995; heggenes et al. 1996). is in keeping with gause’s principle, one of two similar species occupying the same habitat will eliminate the other, or they will cohabit by evolving some form of ecological isolation (crombie 1947). nakano et al. (1999) supported this notion, showing that dietary shifts enabled congeneric ﬁsh to cohabit when prey became sparse and interspeciﬁc aggression increased. although salinity appears to play a role in segregating craterocephalus populations in the lower river murray, interspeciﬁc competition could contrib- ute at mid-range salinities (ca. 0.4–7.0&), where the congeners may cohabit. the congeners co-occurred at four sites, with comparable abundances at three sites, and one species or the other was present at 11 other sites (this proportion of co-occurrence does not necessarily reﬂect that of the overall populations, 447 wedderburn et al. because site selection was not random). additionally, c. s. fulvus and c. ﬂuviatilis predominate in freshwater and highly saline wetland assemblages, respectively. comparative studies of cyprinodontids in america suggest some ecological parallels with craterocepha- lus, in that rare species may dominate ﬁsh assemblages at high salinity (e.g., ostrand & wilde 2002) and closely related forms have distinctive habitat prefer- ences (e.g., nordlie & walsh 1989). the mechanisms whereby salinity determines the distributions of some cyprinodontids are unclear (ostrand & wilde 2002), although the health of the threatened cyprinodon tularosa is associated with the reduced incidence of parasites in saline water (rogowski & stockwell 2006). research now under way is comparing the osmo- regulatory capabilities of c. s. fulvus and c. ﬂuviatilis (s. d. wedderburn, unpublished data). this should establish whether the respective distributions of the species stem from their physiological attributes or from competitive interactions or other ecological factors. acknowledgements this paper is from continuing phd research by sdw, co-supervised by kfw, bpz and associate professor david paton. it is funded by the sa murray-darling basin natural resources management board and the university of adelaide, with support from the goolwa to wellington local action planning board, the coorong district local action planning board and nature foundation sa. our thanks to michael ham- mer, rupert mathwin, melanie prodoehl, spenser burgstad, chris bice, ron bellchambers and claire treilibs, for ﬁeld assistance. we also thank two reviewers for their helpful advice. references allen, m.g., morgan, d.l. & gill, h.s. 2005. distribution, zoogeography and biology of the murchison river hardyhead (craterocephalus cuneiceps whitley, 1944), an atherinid endemic to the indian ocean (pilbara) drainage division of western australia. ecology of freshwater fish 14: 209– 224. bertozzi, t., adams, m. & walker, k.f. 2000. species boundaries in carp gudgeons (eleotrididae: hypseleotris) from the river murray, south australia: evidence for multiple species and extensive hybridization. marine and freshwater research 51: 805–815. bettoli, p.w. & morris, j.e. 1991. changes in the abundance of two atherinid species after aquatic vegetation removal. transactions of the american fisheries society 120: 90–97. bruton, m.n. 1995. have ﬁshes had their chips?
