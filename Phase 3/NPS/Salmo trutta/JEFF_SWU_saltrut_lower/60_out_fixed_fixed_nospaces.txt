(thorpe & moore 1997). photoperiod is recognised as the major environ- mental cue for the initiation of smoltiﬁcation (duston & saunders 1990) and water temperature is considered the rate controlling factor (hoar 1988). smoltiﬁcation in brown_trout results in body silvering (tanguy et al. 1994), enhanced sea water (sw)-tolerance (nielsen et al. 1999) and migratory behaviour (aarestrup et al. 2000). the progress of smolt development can be monitored by measuring gill na+, k+-atpase activity, which is closely correlated with sw tolerance (nielsen et al. 1999) and migratory readiness (aarestrup et al. 2000) in smolting hatchery-reared brown_trout. initiation of downstream migration of wild salmonid smolts has been associated with increased water tem- perature and water discharge in several studies (e.g. solomon 1978; hansen 1990; bohlin et al. 1993). however, little is known about the relationship between the physiology of the developing smolt and the respon- siveness to these cues. the present knowledge is mainly based on comparisons of genetically different strains of anadromous and resident brown_trout reared and retained in captivity (e.g. boeuf & harache 1982; soivio et al. 1989; aarestrup et al. 2000). wild symp- atric populations of anadromous and resident trout offer an opportunity to concurrently investigate the diverging physiology of these types, and thereby to characterise their development at the time when downstream migration is initiated by environmental factors. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether: (i) morphological and physiological smolt features corre- late in wild brown_trout; and (ii) elevated gill na+, k+- atpase activity (as a measure of smolt status) is a unique characteristic to those trout which respond to environmental cues for downstream migration. this was done by concurrently comparing gill na+, k+- atpase activity in descending (i.e. caught in a trap) and nondescending individuals (caught by electroﬁshing upstream of the trap) of a brown_trout population in a small danish brook during the entire smolt run. materials and methods study area and experimental ﬁsh the study was conducted in the brandstrup brook (9°40¢n, 56°23¢w), which is a tributary to the river 230 gudenaa (jutland, denmark). the brandstrup brook is 4.5 km long, 0.5–2 m wide and has a maximum depth of 0.5 m. the distance from the trap to the river mouth is c. 23 km. water temperature (fig. 1) was measured daily at 18:00 hours with a mylog data logger (dansk elektronik design, aarhus, denmark). water dis- charge was not measured during the study, but annual water ﬂow rate at the outlet varies between 34 and 152 læs )1. the brandstrup brook has never been stocked with hatchery-reared brown_trout, thus the population is considered of wild origin (hansen & mensberg 1998). the age at smolting varies between one and three years, with the majority of smolts leaving the brook as two yearlings. the total annual smolt run varies p a r t n i t h g u a c h s i f f o r e b m u n (a) (b) (c) 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 march april may march april may march april month may ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 fig. 1. the number of wild descending brown_trout (salmo_trutta): (a) smolts (open bars, n ¼ 496);

(1994). the sex of the sampled ﬁsh was determined upon dissection and total length (lt) was measured to the nearest millimetre. the age and growth of selected ﬁsh were determined by scale analyses. sampling and analyses the ﬁsh were stunned by a blow to the head and following decapitation, one second gill arch was placed in 0.8 ml sei-buffer (300 mm sucrose, 50 mm imidazole, 20 mm na2edta, ph 7.3) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. na+, k+- atpase activity was analysed in gill homogenates at 27 °c by the method of mccormick (1993) using a microplate reader (spectramax, molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa). protein content in the tissue homogenates was measured by the method of lowry et al. (1951) modiﬁed for microplate reader. statistics all values are reported as mean value ± se. statistical differences were analysed using systat 7.0 (systat 7.0, 1997 by spss inc., chicago, il, usa). data were evaluated using either one-way or two-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by bonferroni’s test. when 5 3 . 0 ± . 3 3 1 3 . 0 ± 0 . 2 1 6 2 . 0 ± 1 . 4 1 1 6 . 0 ± . 3 4 1 9 3 0 . ± . 9 3 1 1 4 0 . ± . 6 2 1 8 4 0 . ± . 8 3 1 4 3 0 . ± . 8 2 1 2 5 0 . ± . 1 4 1 4 3 0 . ± . 9 3 1 6 5 0 . ± . 6 3 1 1 6 . 0 ± 5 . 3 1 8 6 . 0 ± 6 . 2 1 2 4 . 0 ± 8 . 2 1 ) m c ( h t g n e l p a r t 0 0 5 0 5 h s ﬁ . l e 0 3 0 5 0 2 p a r t 0 0 1 0 9 h s ﬁ . l e 0 8 0 1 0 1 p a r t 0 1 1 9 8 h s ﬁ . l e 0 2 0 7 0 1 p a r t 0 0 0 0 1 h s ﬁ . l e 0 7 0 2 0 1 p a r t 0 0 2 0 8 h s ﬁ . l e 0 3 0 1 0 6 p a r t 5 2 5 7 0 h s ﬁ . l e 5 . 2 1 5 . 7 8 0 p a r t 0 4 4 6 6 5 h s ﬁ . l e 0 5 2 5 7 t l o m s - e r p t l o m s r r a p d o h t e m y a m 5 l i r p a 6 2 l i r p a 7 1 l i r p a 0 1 h c r a m 7 2 h c r a m 5 1 h c r a m 6 e t a d p a r t e h t n i d n a i g n h s ﬁ o r t c e e m a e r t s p u l y b s e t a d s u o i r a v e h t t a t h g u a c h s ﬁ f o ) m e s ± ( s h t g n e l n a e m d n a s e p y t - h p r o m f o n o i t u b i r t s d i e g a t n e c r e p . 1 l e b a t . a i r e t i r c l i l a c g o o h p r o m g n s u i s t l o m s r o s t l o m s - e r p , r r a p s a i d e ﬁ s s a c l e r e w h s f i 231 nielsen et al. required, data were transformed to satisfy the anova assumption of homogeneity of variances. regression analysis was used to determine if ﬁsh size and gill na+, k+-atpase activity were correlated. gill na+, k+-atpase activities of the different trap-caught and electroﬁshed morphs were therefore pooled monthly. results trout morph-types appearing in the trap during the study period, water temperature varied between 3.7 and 14.8 °c. twenty-ﬁve per cent, 71% and 4% of the total number of trap-caught trout were caught in march, april and may respectively (fig. 1). in march, 1%, 30% and 69% of the trap-caught ﬁsh were classiﬁed as parr, pre-smolts and smolts respect- ively, while in april 0%, 29% and 71% of the trap- caught trout were classiﬁed as parr, pre-smolts and smolts respectively (fig. 1a–c). in may, 71%, 11% and 18% of the trap-caught trout were classiﬁed as parr, pre-smolts and smolts respectively. during the entire study period 3%, 28% and 69% of all trap- caught trout were classiﬁed as parr, pre-smolts and smolts. pre-smolts occurred quite evenly in the trap with no obvious peaks from march to mid-april. through the same period, smolt downstream movement occurred in peaks [fig. 1a,b]. length, sex and morph-types of the sampled trout there was no difference in length between sampled ﬁsh caught in the trap and by electroﬁshing (table 1). in march, the relative distribution of the three morph- types was similar among trap-caught and electroﬁshed trout (table 1). in april, the majority of sampled trap- caught trout were judged as smolts (89–100%), while only 10% of the sampled electroﬁshed trout was judged as smolts. the majority of electroﬁshed trout were either parr or pre-smolts during the same period. through may, there was a shift from smolts to parr appearing in the trap. the percentage of parr among the sampled electroﬁshed trout increased from 30% to 100%, while the propor- tion of smolts decreased from 20% to 0%. the proportions of females among the three groups of sampled ﬁsh through the study period were: parr, 28%; pre-smolts, 43%; and smolts, 76%. in the same period, gill na+, k+-atpase activity trap-caught trout mean gill na+, k+-atpase activity of randomly selected trout was relatively low on 6 and 15 march (fig. 2). the activity increased signiﬁcantly in late march and increased further (p < 0.001) to a plateau during april. in early may, the activity was almost halved and remained low until the end of the study. electroﬁshed trout mean gill na+, k+-atpase activity in electroﬁshed trout remained relatively low and unchanged during the study period, except for a transient increase in late march (fig. 2). there was no signiﬁcant difference between the activity of trap-caught trout and trout caught by electroﬁshing in samples taken in march and may (fig. 2). however, in april the na+, k+- atpase activity in trap-caught trout was threefold higher (p < 0.0001) compared with trout caught by electroﬁshing. comparison of gill na+, k+-atpase activity within morph-types: effect of time and catching method mean monthly gill na+, k+-atpase activity was unaffected by catching method (trap and electroﬁsh- ing) and time in both parr and pre-smolts (fig. 3a). in smolts, the activity was generally higher in april than * a * a * a ab b a b ab ab ab ab ab ab ab 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 o f d e s c e n d n g i t r o u t b b b b march april month may c u m u a l  t i v e % o  f t o t a l n u m b e r fig. 2. seasonal changes in mean gill na+, k+-atpase activity in wild brown_trout (salmo_trutta) caught in a trap (d) and by ) and the cumulative catch electroﬁshing ( in per cent of the total number of descend- ing trout during the study period (dotted line). na+, k+-atpase activities are mean values ± sem of eight to 10 ﬁsh, and values with shared letters are not signiﬁcantly dif- ferent (p > 0.05). capital and lower-case letters are used for trout caught in the trap and by electroﬁshing respectively;

(1987); atlantic salmon: whitesel (1993); brown_trout: aarestrup et al. (2000)]. from march to mid-april, trout judged visually as pre-smolts and smolts in the present study expressed different migration responses to the same environmental factors, suggesting that physiological smolt status in pre-smolts and smolts was different. from march to april, visual appearance (silvering) was in fact closely related to gill na+, k+-atpase activity with the level being smolts > pre-smolts > parr. this relation was consistently observed in both trap-caught and electroﬁshed trout in march to april, and the degree of silvering seems to be a reliable indicator of physiological smolt status in wild brown_trout at this period of time. the observed physiological smolt status (i.e. gill na+, k+-atpase activity) of the morph-types was only little affected by ﬁsh size (all morphs: r2 ¼ 0.11; p < 0.0001). a similar positive relation was found between ﬁsh morph-type and gill na+, k+-atpase activity in hatchery-reared brown_trout of wild origin at the time of peak gill na+, k+-atpase activity (tanguy et al. 1994). wild migrating smolts of brown_trout tolerate exposure to 34 ppt sw with no changes in plasma ] (ugedal et al. 1998). they have high gill na+, [cl ) 233 nielsen et al. )1æh k+-atpase activity (nielsen et al. 1999), and move directly into sw with no intermittent period of acclimation in the estuary (moore et al. 1998), suggesting that sw tolerance must be developed prior to or concurrent with downstream migration. trout with na+, k+-atpase activities below 2 lmol adp )1 fail to tolerate sw (nielsen et al. mgæprotein 1999), and the consistently low gill na+, k+-atpase activity in the trap-caught (and electroﬁshed) parr during the study, suggest that the downstream moving parr in the present study were probably not destined for the sea. whether the trap-caught parr were just moving about in the brook or were gradually moving downstream in search for spacious and more produc- tive habitats as documented for atlantic salmon parr (cunjak et al. 1989) is unknown. a large number of pre-smolts moved downstream concurrently with the smolts in late april. these ﬁsh were generally smaller and had lower gill na+, k+-atpase activity compared with migrating smolts. the purpose of moving for these ﬁsh is unknown but it is possible that they may develop into full smolts with higher na+, k+-atpase activity at a later stage of their downstream movement. scale analysis revealed that 16 of 20 randomly selected trout caught in the trap in late april had experienced a period with accelerated spring growth (so-called ‘b-type growth’; fahy, 1990) during the spring, while zero of 20 randomly selected trout in the trap in early march had experienced this ‘b-type growth’. the spring growth is likely to have made the comparatively small pre-smolts caught in late april able to smolt relatively late in the season. lower gill na+, k+-atpase activity at the end of the migratory period has been reported in wild migrating smolts of brown_trout (nielsen et al. 1999) and atlantic salmon (mccormick et al. 1999) and may be an early sign of desmoltiﬁcation (hoar 1988). in the present study, the few descending smolts caught in may had, despite a silvery appearance, statistically signiﬁcant lower gill na+, k+-atpase activity than smolts descending during the main run in april. this suggests that the descending smolts in may had started desmoltiﬁcation and that the reliability of the degree of silvering as an indicator of the physiological smolt status in wild brown_trout is dependent on season. loss of physiological smolt characteristics in salmo- nids is correlated with increase in temperature (duston et al. 1991) and/or degree-days (duston et al. 1991; mccormick et al. 1999), and the present water temperature increase above 14 °c in late april is likely to have triggered the desmoltiﬁcation process. the relationship between morphology and physiology was less pronounced in may presumably due to progressing desmoltiﬁcation. this agrees with soivio et al. (1988) who reported progressive loss of sw tolerance in silvery atlantic salmon smolts. thus 234 external appearance is not a reliable indicator of smolt stage during desmoltiﬁcation. the sex ratio varied between the different morph- types, with 28%, 43% and 76% females in the parr, pre-smolts and smolts respectively. this supports earlier ﬁndings by christensen et al. (1993) and reﬂects the different reproductive strategies of females and males salmonid populations (fleming 1996). in anadromous there was no effect of catching method on mean gill na+, k+-atpase activity of a particular morph- type. nor was there any size difference between trap-caught and electroﬁshed trout. since primarily smolts responded to the increased water temperature during march and most of april, wild brown_trout smolts may need to reach a certain physiological threshold condition before being responsive to environmental factors which initiate downstream migration. this was also suggested for hatchery- reared brown_trout (aarestrup et al. 2000) and is further identical sw tolerance in wild descending and nondescending (immature) brown_trout caught in a trap and by electroﬁshing respectively (dellefors & faremo 1988). however, dellefors & faremo (1988) only examined sw tolerance at a single time point and were unable to resolve seasonal changes in this pattern through the migratory period. supported by a report of studies of the physiological differentiation in potential resident and anadromous brown_trout during the smolting period are few and limited to studies comparing different strains of trout reared in captivity (boeuf & harache 1982; soivio et al. 1989; tanguy et al. 1994; pirhonen & forsman 1998). low gill na+, k+-atpase activity was measured in offspring of resident brown_trout compared with anadromous trout (boeuf & harache 1982; soivio et al. 1989; tanguy et al. 1994) during smolting. in contrast, pirhonen & forsman (1998) found that landlocked brown_trout had either similar or higher gill na+, k+- atpase activity than anadromous trout. landlocked trout should, however, not be considered as resident as their life history may include migration between streams and lakes (jonsson 1985). in the study of pirhonen & forsman (1998) the landlocked trout displayed downstream displacement in an annular ﬂume tank at the same frequency as the anadromous trout during smolting. this suggest, that downstream movement of diadromous brown_trout during spring- time is closely linked to increased gill na+, k+- atpase activity, whether the journey is destined for the ocean or is conﬁned to the freshwater drainage system. a major reason for these conﬂicting results may be the fact that offspring of genetically different resident and anadromous trout strains were reared in captivity. it has been documented that resident and anadromous trout when co-existing form parts of the same population (hindar et al. 1991), and originate from a common gene-pool (pettersson et al. 2001). thus, offspring from anadromous parents can become resi- dent and vice versa. the developmental pathway is likely to be controlled by interacting factors including both endogenous (nutritional, genetic) and environ- mental components, and the only way to distinguish ‘true’ anadromous from resident individuals is there- fore to study the ﬁsh in their natural environment, where migration can take place. in conclusion, the study shows that morphological and physiological smolt features (gill na+, k+-atpase level) correlate in wild brown_trout during spring at the time of the smolt run. further, the present study suggests that wild smolting brown_trout need to reach a certain physiological condition before initiating downstream migration. acknowledgements the study was supported by a grant from the danish ministry for food, agriculture and fisheries. references aarestrup, k., nielsen, c. & madsen, s.s. 2000. relationship between gill na+, k+-atpase activity and downstream movement in domesticated and ﬁrst-generation offspring of (salmo_trutta). canadian wild anadromous brown_trout journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 57: 2086–2095. boeuf, g. & harache, y. 1982. criteria for adaptation of salmonids to high salinity seawater in france. aquaculture 28: 163–176. bohlin, t., dellefors, c. & faremo, u. 1993. timing of sea-run (salmo_trutta) smolt migration: effects of brown_trout climatic variation. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 50: 1132–1136. buckman, m. & ewing, r.d. 1982. relationship between size and time of entry into the sea and gill (na+, k+ )-atpase activity for juvenile spring chinook salmon. transactions of the american fisheries society 111: 681–687. christensen, o., pedersen, s. & rasmussen, g. 1993. review of the danish stocks of sea_trout (salmo_trutta). copenha- gen: international council for exploration of the sea, c.m. 1993/m: 22. cunjak, r.a, chadwick, e.m.p. & shears, m. 1989. down- stream movements and estuarine residence by atlantic salmon parr (salmo_salar). canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 46: 1466–1471. dellefors, c. & faremo, u. 1988. early sexual maturation in males of wild sea_trout, salmo_trutta l., inhibits smoltiﬁca- tion. journal of fish biology 33: 741–749. duston, j. & saunders, r.l. 1990. the entrainment role of photoperiod on hypoosmoregulatory and growth-related aspects of smolting in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). canadian journal of zoology 68: 707–715. physiological smolt status in wild brown_trout duston, j., saunders, r.l. & knox, d.e. 1991. effects of increases smolt characteristics in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 48: 164–169. temperature on loss of in freshwater fahy, e. 1990. spring growing period as a regulator of the size of the smolt run in trout (salmo_trutta). arch. hydrobiol. 119: 325–330. ferguson, a. 1989. genetic differences among brown_trout, salmo_trutta, stocks and their importance for the conservation and management of the species. freshwater biology 21: 35– 46. fleming, i.a. 1996. reproductive strategies of atlantic salmon: ecology and evolution. reviews in fish biology and fisheries 6: 379–416. hansen, l.p. 1990. salmon ranching experiments;
