(ii) what are the distances moved by bullheads? (iii) does movement behaviour vary in time? residency and movement of materials and methods this study was conducted in the steenputbeek (spb) (depth: 0.1 m–0.4 m; width: ±1 m) and the laarse beek (lb) (depth: 0.5 m–1.0 m; width: ±4 m), two rivers belonging to the basin of the river scheldt (belgium). a river stretch of 200 m (spb) and 300 m (lb) was subdivided into sections of 10 m and sampled in november to december 2001 with electric ﬁshing gear using an electracatch wfc7 generator (electracatch international ltd, wolverhampton, uk) producing 150 v. bullheads were anaesthetised with 2-phenoxy- )1) and individually marked with ethanol (0.25 ml l passive integrated transponder (pit) tags (selected model: tx1400l, fish eagle international, gloucester- shire, uk; 12 · 2.1 mm, operation frequency 125 khz, biocompatible glass encapsulation), a reliable and innocuous technique for tagging bullheads (bruyn- doncx et al. 2002). the size of the marked bullheads varied between 51 and 100 mm, a length at which bullheads generally are considered to be sexually mature (smyly 1957; crisp et al. 1974). following capture and handling, individuals were allowed to recuperate in large tubs with stream water, before being released into the centre of the section where they were initially caught. during january to february (period a) and may to june 2002 (period b), both river stretches were sampled again. in addition, extra river trajectories (also subdivided into sections of 10 m) of 50 m (spb) and 100 m (lb), located adjacent upstream and down- stream of the marking areas, were also sampled in both periods. marked ﬁsh recaptured in their initial tagging section were categorised as resident, the others as mobile. the distance between centres of sections where ﬁsh were released and centres of sections where they were recaptured was considered as the distance that the recaptured ﬁsh had moved. the following analyses were conducted using this mark and recapture data for each study area: (i) proportions of resident and mobile ﬁsh during both study periods; (ii) distances moved during the study periods; (iii) individual residency and move- ment twice. comparisons of resident and mobile ﬁsh were conducted by fisher’s exact tests. comparisons of the mean distances ﬁsh moved between sampling periods were conducted by mann– whitney u-tests. the proportions of recaptured determined from ﬁsh 318 results steenputbeek in the spb, a total of 374 bullheads were caught and tagged. of those ﬁsh, 186 (50%) were recaptured during the study, 144 during period a (39%) and 42 during period b (11%). in the latter period, 35 bullheads were recaptured for a second time. least of the 144 bullheads recaptured during period a, 95 (66%) were found in the same stream section in which they had initially been caught (fig. 1). of the 49 (34% of recaptures) bullheads that moved, 32 (22% of recaptures) were recaptured at sites adjacent to initial tagging sites. the remaining 17 (12% of recaptures) were at two sites away from the initial tagging sites. the distances moved by these ﬁsh ranged between 100 m upstream and 20 m downstream. three of these mobile individuals were recaptured outside the 200 m marking area. of the 77 bullheads recaptured during period b, only 32 specimens (42%) were found in the stream section in which they had been released after tagging (fig. 1). of the 45 (58% of recaptures) bullheads that moved, the authors recaptured 20 (26% of recaptures) at sites adjacent to initial tagging sites. the remaining 25 (32% of recaptures) were at least two sites away from the initial tagging sites. the distances moved by these ﬁsh ranged between 90 m upstream and 90 m downstream. seven of these mobile bullheads were observed upstream or down- stream the 200 m marking area. test, f ¼ 12, p ¼ 0.0006). furthermore, the proportion of mobile bullheads was signiﬁ- cantly larger during period b than period a (fisher’s exact the distances of movement by the bullheads were also signiﬁcantly larger during period b (mean: 26 ± 3 m) than those during period a (mean: 17 ± 2 m; mann–whitney u-test, u ¼ 819, p ¼ 0.017). residency and movement patterns of individual bullheads were inferred from ﬁsh that were recap- tured twice. over the duration of the study, a total of 35 ﬁsh met this requirement (fig. 2). during period a, 28 of 35 ﬁsh (80%) were observed at their initial capture site, while the remaining seven (20%) had moved between 10 and 30 m. of 28 ﬁsh that were classiﬁed as resident during period a, 16 (57%) remained resident and 12 (43%) had moved (between 10 and 70 m) during period b. by contrast, of the seven ﬁsh initially categorised as mobile, all (100%) had moved again (between 10 and 110 m) at their second recapture. this propor- tion was signiﬁcantly higher than for resident ﬁsh that subsequently moved (fisher’s exact test, f ¼ 8, p ¼ 0.0092). residency and movement of cottus gobio steenputbeek laarse beek s d a e h l l u b f o r e b m u n s d a e h l l u b f o r e b m u n 12 9 6 3 0 12 9 6 3 0 –250–200–150–100 –50 0 50 100 150 200 250 distance (m) laarse beek –250–200–150–100 –50 0 50 100 150 200 250 –250–200–150–100 –50 0 50 100 150 200 250 distance (m) steenputbeek –250–200–150–100 –50 0 50 100 150 200 250 (a) 100 s d a e h l l u b f o r e b m u n 80 60 40 20 0 (b) 100 s d a e h l l u b f o r e b m u n 80 60 40 20 0 distance (m) distance (m) from the initial tagging sites and moved between 260 m upstream and 160 m downstream. four of these bullheads were recaptured in the 100 m section upstream and downstream of the marking area. although the proportion of mobile bullheads was larger during period b than period a, the difference test, f ¼ 1.96, was not signiﬁcant (fisher’s exact p ¼ 0.22), probably because of a limited sample size. furthermore, the distances of movement by the bullheads were also signiﬁcantly larger during period b (mean: 133 ± 3 m) than those during period a (mean: 18 ± 7 m; mann–whitney u-test, u ¼ 1.00, p ¼ 0.0012). residency and movement patterns of individual bullheads could not be investigated as no marked bullheads were recaptured twice in the lb. discussion recaptured bullheads either were resident, i.e., found within the initial site of capture or had covered distances between 10 and 100 m in the spb and 10 m and 260 m in the lb. these results suggest that not all bullheads exhibit sedentary behaviour, as has often been assumed (smyly 1957; andreasson 1971; lelek 1987), but that both resident and mobile individuals may be present within a population. similarly, for many other stream ﬁsh, it was initially thought sedentary, i.e., that movement was restricted to a particular pool or stream site (‘restricted movement paradigm’; individuals were adult that 319 fig. 1. distances (m) and directions (+ upstream; ) downstream) that bullheads moved during each study period [(a) before the spawning season, (b) during the spawn- ing season)] in the steenputbeek and the : bullheads recaptured in laarse beek. river trajectories located adjacent upstream and downstream of the marking area. laarse beek in total, 28 of 196 tagged bullheads (14%) were recaptured during this study: 20 during period a (10%) and eight during period b (4%). no bullheads were recaptured twice. recaptures) of the 20 bullheads recaptured during period a, 11 (55%) were found in the same stream section in which they had initially been caught (fig. 1). of the nine bullheads (45% of that moved, seven (35% of recaptures) were recaptured at sites adjacent to initial tagging sites. the remaining two (10% of recaptures) were at two sites away from the initial tagging sites. the distances moved by these ﬁsh were 30 and 70 m upstream. however, none of these individuals were recaptured outside the 300 m marking area. of the eight bullheads recaptured during period b, only two specimens (25%) were found in the stream section in which they had been released after tagging (fig. 1).the two sites away remaining six (75%) were at least least n = 35 resident (n = 28, 80%) moved (n = 7, 20%) r1 resident (n = 16, 57%) moved (n = 12, 43%) resident (n = 0, 0%) moved (n = 7, 100%) r2 fig. 2. individual residency and movement of bullheads in the steenputbeek. r1 and r2 represent the ﬁrst and second recapture. knaepkens et al. gerking 1959; gowan et al. 1994). there is now however accumulating evidence that, although a majority of the individuals within a stream ﬁsh indeed sedentary, a proportion of population is ﬁsh is mobile, i.e., ﬁsh that move frequently and sometimes for long distances (smithson & johnston 1999). these observations have prompted the view that stream ﬁsh populations may be composed of both static and mobile group. consequently, it is not unlikely that in the lb and the spb, the bullhead population also consists of both stationary and mobile individuals. this hypothesis is furthermore individual movement supported by our behaviour of multiple recaptured bullheads, i.e., some ﬁsh were either always resident or mobile. in addition, other bullheads exhibited both sedentary and mobile behaviour. a possible explanation is that these ﬁsh alternate between both behaviours. move- ment studies have demonstrated that, instead of exhibiting one strategy or the other exclusively, ﬁsh also can display periods of site ﬁdelity (sedentary behaviour) punctuated by times of movement (smithson & johnston 1999; hilderbrand & ker- shner 2000), a behaviour harcup et al. (1984) termed ‘switching’. results of our results also showed that the proportion of mobile bullheads and the distances travelled were signiﬁcantly larger during period b (may to june) than during period a (january to february). one explan- ation is that the more pronounced movement beha- viour of bullheads during period b is associated with reproductive behaviour. during the spawning season (in flanders: march to july; vandelannoote et al. 1998), male bullheads locate an appropriate spawning site, i.e., a cavity underneath a stone or other solid substrate, and prepare a nest for spawning (morris 1955). it is likely that some males have to travel substantial distances to look for suitable spawning sites, while others remain sedentary because their nonbreeding season hiding places also serve as appropriate spawning substrates. this may also explain as to why some resident bullheads became mobile during period b, while others remained resident in both sampling periods. these ‘spawning movements’ of male bullheads may be especially large when suitable spawning sites are rare and very scattered, as is the case for the study area in the lb. this river has been subjected to human activities like canalisation and clearing practices, resulting in a substantial loss of natural spawning substrates (iron– sandstone aggregates, typical of this part of belgium). today, spawning in the lb is mainly limited to the few remaining natural substrates and artiﬁcial stones, used to stabilise river banks and abutments of bridges, that are scattered within the river (g. knaepkens, personal observation; see also knaepkens et al. 2002). simi- 320 that already have eggs larly in other ﬁsh species, including cottidae (japanese ﬂuvial sculpin, cottus pollux), the spatial distribution of potential nest sites may affect the distance of male movement during the spawning season (natsumeda 1999; lucas & baras 2001). in addition, the increased movement behaviour of bullheads during period b may also be the result of females exploring the river looking for a mate. as female bullheads have a preference for certain males, i.e., relatively large males or males in their nest (marconato & bisazza 1986; bisazza & marconato 1988), and/or males may be scattered within the river as a result of the spatial distribution of suitable spawning sites, it is likely that females also have to travel relatively large distances during the spawning season to ﬁnd an appropriate male. clearly, future evaluations of year-round movements of both males and females are necessary to evaluate if increased bullhead movement behaviour indeed is the case during the breeding season and not just the result of an increased period of time between recaptures. addi- tionally, the distribution of potential spawning sites within the river should also be taken into account in these studies. the recapture rates of marked bullheads were much higher in the spb than in the lb. a possible explanation is the difference in bullhead capture efﬁciency between both rivers. as bullheads do not surface during electric ﬁshing because of the lack of a swim bladder, the transparency of the water largely affects their capture efﬁciency (g. knaepkens, perso- nal observation). the latter is probably much higher in the narrow (±1 m), shallow (0.1–0.4 m) and clear spb than in the wider (±4 m), deeper (0.5–1.0 m) and much more turbid lb. an additional explanation is that there was substantial emigration from the lb sampling area compared with the spb. however, this hypothesis can only be examined with an extensive survey of larger parts of both rivers. finally, we are aware that the sampling methodo- logy used in this study may have limitations for interpreting bullhead movement. first, given the limited temporal scale and size of the study areas, year-round and/or long-distance movements could not be addressed. secondly, because of the contiguous nature of the recapture sites, the distance moved by bullheads should also be interpreted with caution. for example, ﬁsh could have been tagged at the down- stream edge of a site and recaptured at the upstream edge of the site immediately downstream of the initial tagging site. in this scenario, bullhead movement is overestimated because distances shorter than 10 m were crossed. clearly, to further disentangle the movement behaviour of the bullhead, further long- term research at a larger scale and with a higher resolution is necessary. nevertheless, despite these limitations, this study provided a ﬁrst basic under- standing of bullhead movement in both study areas. resumen 1. desde noviembre del an˜o 2001 hasta junio del 2002, evaluamos la residencia y los movimientos de cottus gobio a trave´s de te´cnicas de marcado-recaptura en dos rı´os ﬂamencos: steenputbeek (spb) y laarse beek (lb). aunque antes de la estacio´n reproductiva, la mayorı´a de los individuos re-capturados (66% en spb y 55% en lb) fueron encontrados en las mismas localidades de marcado, algunos peces habı´an cubierto distancias entre 10 y 100 metros (media ¼ 17.2 ± 2 m) y entre 10 y 70 m (media ¼ 18.0 ± 7 m) en spb y lb, respectivamente. durante la estacio´n reproductiva, tanto la proporcio´n de individuos que se movieron (58% en spb y 75% en lb), como las distancias recorridas fueron signiﬁcativamente mayores: en spb, entre 10 y 90 m, media ¼ 26.0 ± 3 m y en lb entre 30 y 260 m, media ¼ 133.0 ± 3 m. 2. ana´lisis del comportamiento entre mu´ ltiples individuos mostro´ que algunos individuos fueron o residentes o mo´ viles mientras que otros individuos cambiaron entre ambos compor- tamientos. en general, nuestros resultados sugieren que no todos los individuos muestran comportamiento sedentario sino que la poblacio´n incluye individuos estacionarios y mo´ viles. acknowledgements we thank l. bervoets, k. hermans, d. knapen and w. meeus for assistance in the ﬁeld. this study was supported by the university of antwerp and aminal (vlina/9903). references andreasson, s. 1971. feeding habits of a sculpin (cottus gobio l. pisces) population. report of the institute of freshwater research, drottningholm, sweden, 51, pp. 5–30. bisazza, a. & marconato, a. 1988. female mate choice, male- male competition and parentale care in the river bullhead, cottus gobio l.
