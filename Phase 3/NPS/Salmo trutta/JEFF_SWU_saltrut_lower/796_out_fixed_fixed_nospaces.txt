(adams et al. 2013; day et al. 2014), that was listed as state-threa- tened in missouri in 2004, and declared federally endangered under the u.s. endangered species act (esa) in 2013 ([esa] 1973; usfws 2013). although cave adaptation has been observed in other sculpin species (espinasa & jeffrey 2003; espinasa et al. 2013), grotto sculpin represent the first formally recognised troglomorph of the cottus lineage (adams et al. 2013). the known range of grotto sculpin is limited to caves and their corresponding resurgence spring streams within the bois brule watershed of perry county, missouri (adams et al. 2013). unlike most cave-dwelling fishes, grotto sculpin represent a variable distribution of morphological cave adapta- tions throughout cave streams, spring branches and surface streams (burr et al. 2001). these three dis- tinct, continuous habitats and their corresponding sculpin populations provide a unique system in which to investigate population ecology in relation to habi- tat of a fish that appears to be in the process of adapt- ing to life underground. the cave systems inhabited by grotto sculpin are found exclusively in shallow, porous karst regions that underlie agricultural and industrial landscapes and may experience rapid shifts in water quality due to surface activities (burr et al. 2001). fox et al. (2010) observed high concentrations of many agricul- tural and industrial chemicals detrimental to verte- brate physiology in several cave streams and spring branches in perry county, providing evidence that direct contaminant input from surface run-off does occur and is likely to have negative impacts on grotto sculpin populations. pollution of groundwater could increase susceptibility to parasite infection due to reduced condition or health (marchand et al. 2012; day et al. 2013; kleinertz & palm 2013). high sus- ceptibility to anthropogenic pollution makes popula- tion ecological data essential for the conservation of 28 grotto sculpin populations, and understanding popula- tion structure and ecology is imperative for such spe- cies to mitigate future perturbations. we used long-term mark–recapture techniques to investigate population ecology, size structure and sea- sonal life history characteristics of grotto sculpin over a 3-year period. our objectives were to: (i) compare size class structure to macrohabitat (cave vs. spring branches) and season; (ii) compare grotto sculpin density and life history characteristics in caves to spring branches, and other cavefish species. we related size class structure, fish density and macro- habitat type to season in an effort to identify seasonal variation in the population structure of grotto sculpin. we analysed variation within and among cave and spring branch streams and offer comparisons with other cave and sculpin species for which mark–recap- ture and population data were available. materials and methods study area sinkholes, caves, perry county lies on the salem plateau in the north- east ozark highlands of southeastern missouri, u.s. (fig. 1), and contains 656 known caves: one of the highest concentrations in the united states. predomi- nantly limestone formations, these caves are thought to have formed during the pleistocene era (vandike 1985) and underlie a sinkhole plain terrain typified by sinking streams and numerous springs. subterranean streams outnumber surface streams in this landscape, and the porous nature of this landscape allows for the direct input of large amounts of sediment and anthropogenic contaminants into karst cave systems, likely affecting fish health and popula- tion size (burr et al. 2001; fox et al. 2010). we sam- pled two caves and two corresponding resurgence streams along cinque hommes creek (fig. 1) that had relatively reliable accessibility and consistent presence of grotto sculpin (burr et al. 2001). mystery cave (mc) resurges at mystery resur- gence (mr) and is the third longest cave in missouri with 27.35 km of surveyed passage (walsh 1985). running bull cave (rb) resurges at thunderhole (th) and has 405 m of surveyed passage (p. moss, pers. comm.), nearly 300 m of which has stream. cinque hommes creek is a resurgence stream for many subterranean streams in perry county, includ- ing those of mystery cave and running bull cave. at mystery resurgence, the stream emerges from mystery cave and empties into a deep pool located 10 m from its confluence with cinque hommes creek, where we began stream sampling. the run- ning bull resurgence site, thunderhole, extends for 250 m before rejoining cinque hommes creek. (a) (b) grotto sculpin population ecology fig. 1. map of perry county, missouri, where grotto sculpin are found (a) and inlay map of the united states showing location of missou- ri denoted by dark shading (b). thin lines represent surface streams, thickened lines represent cave systems where grotto sculpin presence has been documented with respect to the four localities examined in this study: mystery cave, mystery resurgence, running bull cave and thunderhole resurgence. field methods numerous safety concerns, including groundwater contaminants, potential for high levels of co2 during detrital decomposition, the need to avoid caves dur- ing high flow and potential flooding conditions pre- vented us from sampling all habitats on a consistent basis. as such, sampling trips were spread as evenly as conditions allowed across all streams, seasons and years between august 2005 and october 2008. sea- sons were defined as spring (march–may), summer (june–august), fall (september–november) and win- ter (december–february). we divided streams into 10-m sections that were demarcated by semi-permanent construction flagging, affixed in a manner that did not disrupt cave forma- tions, to maintain accuracy throughout the study per- iod. three stream width measurements were taken in each section and used to calculate sampling area. in mystery cave, it was only feasible to sample a portion of the stream due to air quality concerns. one-hundred eighty sections (1800 m) were sampled yielding a total sampling area of 2587 m2. running bull cave was divided into 29 sections (290 m) for a total sam- pling area of 473 m2. in spring branches, 10 sections at thunderhole resurgence (219 m2) and 13 sections at mystery resurgence (830 m2) were sampled. combinations of visual searches with dip nets, seining and electrofishing were used to capture fish. in shallow, clear waters and low ceiling areas of run- ning bull cave, we performed visual searches with dip nets. if the stream was turbid, searches were post- poned. electrofishing was employed at mystery resurgence, where the stream is too wide to seine effectively. at mystery cave and thunderhole, sein- ing was used exclusively. seines ranged in length from six to 10 feet (mesh size 0.125 in), as dictated by width of streams and passageways. we acknowledge that there are inherent differences among capture tech- niques, and were careful to sample as exhaustively as 29 day et al. conditions and methods allowed across all habitats. immediately after capture, fish were placed in buckets and individually anesthetised in 200 mgl  1 ms-222 for approximately three minutes as determined by lab- oratory experiments following argent labs (red- mond, wa, usa) protocols (iacuc #2005-005). sedated fish were tagged, standard length measured, allowed to recover in fresh water and returned to the centre of their respective sections. although grotto sculpin were not a federally endangered species at the time this study was conducted, care was taken to treat them as such in the likely event that results would lead to formal listing under the esa. for this reason, repro- ductive status of individuals could not be directly assessed via examination of internal organs. colour- ation differences in cottus carolinae are not obvious as in other species, even less so in c. specus due to lack of pigmentation (adams et al. 2013; burr et al. 2001). we used visual implant elastomer tags (vie; northwest marine technology, shaw island, wa, usa) to mark fish as this method had been tested pre- viously in sculpin (bruyndoncx et al. 2002). standar- dised body placement, combined with the use of multiple colours, allowed us to tag each individual with a unique code. for the first year of the study, all fish were assigned unique codes. due to the large quantity of all size classes of fish and low recapture rates, we employed group tagging during years two and three at two spring branch sites but individual tags were used throughout the study in caves. tag retention is variable in unscaled species (ficke & myrick 2009) but was closely monitored by examining individual fish upon recapture and comparing recorded encounter histories, and remained high throughout the study. fin clips were not taken due to status of the species, but a subsample of fish was tagged with both alphanumeric and vie to monitor tag retention which was consistent with previous studies. to reduce mortality concerns fish <30 mm standard length were not marked. statistical analyses to calculate catch per unit area (cpua, herein referred to as density) for a given location and sam- pling trip, we divided the total number of sculpin cap- tured by the stream section area. overall mean density for a given stream was then calculated by averaging across sampling trips. density data were also averaged by season to allow for seasonal comparisons among and within macrohabitats. size class structure was determined using length-frequency histograms of stan- dard lengths and compared to reproductive timing of other species, the closest being c. carolinae (burr et al. 2001; carter et al. 2004; grossman et al. 2006). individuals smaller than 30 mm were classified as 30 in mean lengths young-of-year (yoy), 30–60 mm as juveniles and greater than 60 mm as adults, corresponding with the approximate size of the smallest mature sculpin cap- tured during our study. we used t-tests to examine dif- ferences and percentages of recaptures. repeated-measures anova (jmp 7.0; sas institute, cary, nc, usa) was used to evaluate the effects of seasons and habitat on overall densities. size-specific densities were compared for each habitat type separately using repeated-measures anova to pro- vide deeper insight on grotto sculpin life history in dif- ferent log- transformed [log10 (n + 1)] prior to all analyses, and post hoc tukey contrasts were used to identify pair- wise differences between densities when anova results indicated significant differences. the popan (sch- warz & arnason 1996) interface of program mark version 3.1 (white & burnham 1999) was used to cal- culate population estimates and provided a robust pa- capture–recapture rameterisation theory. only individuals large enough to tag (>30 mm sl) were included in population estimates. all means are reported with standard errors indicated by ‘’ (in text) or ‘se’ (in table). types. density data were jolly-seber habitat of results overall between august 2005 and october 2008, 26 sam- pling trips were conducted in perry county, missouri. mystery cave, running bull cave, thunderhole resurgence and mystery resurgence were sampled on 22, 23, 23 and 18 occasions, respectively, yielding 6265 grotto sculpin captures. of the 6265 capture events recorded, 2684 (43%) occurred in caves streams and 3581 (57%) in spring branch streams. a total of 2986 fish were tagged including 1468 in summer, 491 in fall, 583 in winter and 444 in spring. the proportion of recaptured fish was highest in caves, ranging from 0% to 76% by trip with a mean of 46%. in spring branches, recaptures ranged from 0% to 38% by trip with a mean of 18%, and were significantly lower than in caves during all seasons (p < 0.001). overall differences were observed for recaptures with significantly higher rates in fall and winter (32% each) than spring (25%) (p = 0.002). summer recaptures (15%) were signifi- cantly lower than all other seasons (p = 0.01). seasonal overall grotto sculpin densities varied significantly by habitat type (i.e., cave or surface) on overall grotto sculpin densities (two-way anova, d.f. = 1, f = 13.94, p < 0.001), and this pattern was consistent d.f. = 3, among f = 0.55, p = 0.650) (fig. 3). mean grotto sculpin densities were significantly lower in caves (0.037 m2) (two-way seasons anova, all grotto sculpin population ecology table 1. mean grotto sculpin densities and standard errors (individuals  2) in cave streams and surface spring branches by season and size m class. sizes classes defined as: yoy <30 mm, juvenile 30–60 mm, adult >60 mm.

therefore, only results from caves are reported. population estimates calculated by popan for the two caves ranged from 12 to 133 in running bull cave and 262 to 509 in mystery cave (table s1). during each trip, attempts were made to sample all four sites; however, this was often limited by inclem- ent weather and flood events. discussion population ecology grotto sculpin densities were higher than values reported for other cave fishes. most cave species are found to have lower population sizes and densities than their epigean relatives (poulson 1963; trajano 2001b; grossman et al. 2006), presumably functions of the energy limitations that often characterise sub- terranean ecosystems. high influx of surface nutrients to perry county caves may sustain higher carrying capacities of subterranean organisms such as grotto sculpin. as such, frequent heavy winter and spring rain events can trigger elevated allochthonous organic input to caves, providing critical nutrients for sculpin populations and reducing the reliance on cannibalism for sustenance (day et al. 2013). overall population structure and turnover were rel- atively predictable throughout the study period with gradual annual increases in catches. densities of adult sculpin in caves remained stable and high year-round, with pulses of increases occurring late summer and early fall. winter decreases in adult presence under- ground coupled with increases at resurgences could be indicative of sculpin utilising seasonally high flow events to facilitate large downstream movements from cave sites to resurgences, and to a lesser extent maturation of the previous year’s cohort (burr et al. 2001). five individuals tagged in running bull cave during winter were recaptured at thunderhole resur- gence during subsequent spring sampling providing more evidence that grotto sculpin may experience washout events similar to other species such as southern cavefish (amblyopsis rosae) which are known to be washed out of subterranean habitats by flood events in a similar manner (graening et al. 2010). significant differences in the densities of adult and juvenile sculpin captured within cave and spring branch study sites indicate an ontogenetic shift in habitat use. spring branches were dominated by juvenile sculpin throughout the year, following yoy emergences during spring and summer. increases in juvenile densities during later seasons likely repre- sent maturation, or lateral size class movement, and the appearance of yoy during spring and early sum- grotto sculpin population ecology mer indicates potential late winter and early spring spawning (fig. 3). the spring surge of yoy repre- sents a 35% increase compared to winter, and many of these fish remained either underground or at resurgence sites into summer. adult densities began to increase at spring branches in october, reached peak densities during december and disappeared almost entirely in january, coinciding with an increase in high flow events important to the initia- tion of spawning (johnston 2001). mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi) of the coweeta drainage are also found in stable abundances dominated by adults occupying territories with higher prey abundances than juveniles (grossman et al. 2006). additionally, density dependence coupled with flow variation and mean water levels influence yoy survivorship and competitive interactions with juveniles, resulting in shifting size class spatial distributions similar to those found in the findings presented here (gross- man et al. 2006). banded sculpin (c. carolinae) in tennessee undergo a similar ontogenetic niche shift from riffles to pools between age 0 and age 1, possi- bly correlated with predation pressure. underground, adult sculpin present the largest predation threat to young-of-the-year and juvenile banded sculpin (ko- czaja et al. 2005). in an attempt to escape this preda- tion risk, it is possible that young sculpin reside on the surface until they reach a sufficient size to avoid predation. during all seasons, significantly lower recaptures were found in spring branches, indicating adult movements to subterranean habitats or deeper areas of caves that we were unable to sample. movement of adults upstream from surface streams into spring branches during winter likely represents an under- ground reproductive migration. it is unknown how far grotto sculpin move upstream in caves prior to spawning, but the discovery of a nest approximately two feet into the resurgence at thunderhole suggests that at least some stay close to the surface resurgence. it is also feasible that resident cave sculpin spawn deeper in caves than we were able to sample, and we were unable to capture them until they reached our resurgence study areas. life histories of sculpin species are highly diverse, but aspects of their reproductive ecology are rela- tively consistent throughout north america. most species use cavities for nesting and males guard eggs until hatching (mccaleb 1973). pygmy sculpin (cot- tus paulus), endemic to coldwater spring in ala- bama, exhibit habitat preferences similar to grotto sculpin with most prevalent nesting activity occurring in areas of coarse substrate, shallow water depths and swift water velocity (johnston 2001). keeler & cunjak (2007) observed male nest guarding and spring spawning (april–june) in slimy sculpin 33 day et al. (cottus cognatus) and suggest this species may be sensitive to changes in flow conditions during the reproductive season. a preference for high water velocities could stimulate earlier nesting and spawn- ing behaviour for both of these species, as observed in this study of grotto sculpin. threats to cave fauna point- and nonpoint-source pollution events pose notable concerns and are likely to increase the sus- ceptibility of grotto sculpin to local or total extirpa- tion. throughout their range, the misuse of sinkholes remains the greatest threat to their populations. it is estimated that over half of the numerous sinkholes in perry county are ‘trash-can’ sinkholes containing large quantities of unregulated household and agricul- tural refuse (burr et al. 2001), exacerbating the immi- nent threat of pollution. burr et al. (2001) reported a mass extirpation event in running bull cave, the ori- gin of which remains unknown but is suspected to be anthropogenic in nature. mystery cave also experi- enced at least one recent mass extirpation from a point-source pollution event in 2005 that caused a rapid and fatal drop in dissolved oxygen levels (b. pobst, pers. comm.). although population densities in both of these caves appear to be high at present, this observation is not necessarily indicative of long-term population stability and presumed recovery. suffi- cient vegetative sinkholes located in highly utilised land areas would largely reduce both agricultural chemical injection into cave systems and dramatically decrease sedimentation con- cerns (pavvo & kelly 2004; pavvo et al. 2006; reed et al. 2010). riparian buffering of groundwater contamination and the threat of extir- pation of species endemic to sinkhole plain caves are alarmingly prevalent and can be severely detrimental to long-term water quality and cave taxa survival. unfortunately, these concerns are not unique to perry county, and significant threats from pollution from biological, chemical or siltation continue to jeopar- dise cave biodiversity globally. ogilbia pearsei found in the yucatan peninsula karst are highly threatened by faecal coliform and excess nitrate pollution from improper industrial and domestic waste disposal in rural caves (proudlove 2001b). prietella phreatophila (rio bravo drainage, mexico), satan eurystomus (edwards aquifer, texas, usa), speoplatyrhinus poulsoni (key cave national wildlife refuge, ala- bama, u.s.) and trogloglanis pattersoni (edwards aquifer, texas, u.s.) are all recognised by the iucn red list and reported to be highly vulnerable to eutrophication and contamination from agricultural and industrial run-off of fertilisers, heavy metals and pesticides (culver 1986). heavy metal run-off from a 34 landfill site was identified as a severe threat to sloan valley cave, kentucky typhlichthys subterraneus before their status and taxonomy could be fully assessed (tercafs 1992), and a decades-long gross pollution event extirpated another population in hid- den river cave (lewis 1996). intraspecies diversity in life history strategy is thought to build population- and community-level resilience in fishes from numerous ecosystems (c^ote & darling 2010). the use of coupled epigean and hypogean habitats by grotto sculpin may better equip them to withstand threats of pollution, in that they do not appear to be totally reliant on a single cave or cave system. unlike highly remote or isolated cave populations (i.e., typhlichthys subterraneus, south- ern cavefish; satan eurystomus texas cave catfish), a single pollution event may result in local, but not total extirpation. grotto sculpin can, and do, utilise surface streams with periodically high water veloci- ties that sustain the flushing of contaminants and facilitate fish movement between systems. shallow soil depths offering little filtration of surface run-off coupled with intensive agricultural land use may be responsible for increased available energy and resulting higher (simon & buikema 1997), as evidenced by the variable grotto sculpin population structure and densities found in this study. carrying capacities grotto sculpin were capable of persisting over extended periods within the constraints of this study (up to 29 months); however, our ability to monitor individuals and make inferences as to their sus- pected perseverance through periods of low dis- solved oxygen or anthropogenic pollution is limited. because such occurrences are capable of extirpating large portions of these endemic populations (burr et al. 2001), persistent connectivity with the surface and broad environmental preferences are both required for the continued existence of grotto scul- pin, and also a hindrance to their resilience when under threat of contaminant influx. loss of cave habitats to poor water quality could preclude repro- ductive success of spawning adults, and outflowing contamination resulting in fish kills spring branches could extirpate entire cohorts and jeopar- dise the species. the limited geographic distribution and unknown capacity for dispersal between springs via surface streams restrict the available habitat where grotto sculpin can seek refuge from environ- mental disturbances. refugia may either be absent entirely or inaccessible due to conduit connectivity or hydrographic variability, and the capacity of the cave ecosystem to absorb the impacts of a distur- in other bance is limited. recolonisation potential caves within the perry county karst area is unknown. at conclusion this study represents the first comprehensive descrip- tion and assessment of the life history and population biology of endangered grotto sculpin. this species occupies a unique niche that encompasses both epigean and hypogean stream networks, an unusual strategy not commonly reported or recognised in cave-adapted fishes. population densities varied across habitats and seasons, with patterns of occurrence suggesting an alternative life history strategy aptly adapted to the nature and pressures of karst ecosystems. further investigation is needed into the linkages and relationships between surface activities and sinkholes, particularly with respect to their impacts on aquatic cave fauna. determination of residency rates and dis- persal potential of grotto sculpin and other taxa within and among linked systems such as perry county caves could provide valuable insight on the role of sinkholes in structuring and sustaining their populations. future research should seek to better understand the magnitude and severity of anthropogenic surface activities across the geographic distribution of grotto sculpin, and how subterranean ecosystem ecology and function may be affected by continued poor sinkhole management and proposed mitigation strategies. acknowledgements support for this project was provided by grants from the mis- souri department of conservation and u.s. fish and wildlife service. the diligence and dedication
