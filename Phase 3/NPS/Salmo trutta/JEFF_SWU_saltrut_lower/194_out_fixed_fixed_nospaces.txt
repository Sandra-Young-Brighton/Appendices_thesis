(1990). electromorph identity was confirmed by running samples side by side (guyomard & krieg 1983; krieg & guyomard 1985; largiadcr & scholl 1995). comparison with other european populations portuguese brown_trout populations were com- pared with other iberian and non-iberian samples for which data were available from the literature, covering 14 natural populations from atlantic and mediterranean drainages and three atlantic hatch- ery stocks across seven polymorphic loci: ck-a1*, gpi-a2*, gpi-b2*, ldh-c*, me*, mpi-2* and tf* (table 2). data on the tf* locus were not available for all populations, and analysis was per- formed with and without this locus. data analysis allele frequencies were estimated directly from zymograms for loci showing codominant express- ion. alleles for the isoloci ck-a1, a2* were allo- cated to the single locus ck-al* and their fre- quencies estimated by the square root of the fre- quency of homozygous phenotypes, i.e., under the assumption of hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the biosys-1.7 computer program (swofford & se- lander 1989) was used to analyze the data. pheno- typic distributions of all codominantly expressed loci were tested for agreement with hardy-wein- berg expectations using the chi-square test. un- biased expected heterozygosities for each popula- tion were calculated from observed allele frequen- cies following nei (1978). gene diversity (gst) fig. 1. location of the sulmo trutta sampling sites;

(1999). the ob- served spatial genetic structure showed the portug- uese and northern spanish brown_trout popula- tions to be closely related and both belong to the southwestern atlantic group. our results indicate that the pan-european study of spatial genetic variation at the tf* locus could form a valuable contribution to our understanding of population relationships in salmo_trutta and already helped to characterize northwestern atlantic and mediter- ranean populations, as well as s. trutta marmor- atus, s. trutta carpi0 and s. salar (e.g. krieg & guyomard 1985; presa et al. 1994; largiadkr & scholl 1995, 1996a; giuffra et al. 1996). genetic differentiation of portuguese populations a low level of genetic differentiation was observed between portuguese natural populations (gst= 2.7%) compared to the corresponding value for six populations from galicia, spain (gst=27.3%, martinez et al. 1993). the simultaneous analysis of populations belonging to three distinct drain- ages may have inflated the latter value compared with the portuguese populations that represent a single river system. similarly contrasting results (7.7% versus 21.5%0, expressed in fst rather than gst) were obtained by comparing asturian brown_trout populations from single and different drain- ages (moran et al. 1995). the comparison of brown_trout populations from streams discharging in the atlantic and mediterranean yielded even higher values (e.g. gs,=61 .5%, garcia-marin et al. 1991). based on their genetic similarity, we con- clude that gene flow between the vade, estoriios and trovela populations is substantial, perhaps op- erating through a linear composite of populations and subpopulations interchanging individuals by migration (morrin et al. 1995). the presence of the brown_trout anadromous form in the lima basin could help to increase gene flow between popula- tions (moran et al. 1995). a possibility that cannot be excluded is that transport from one population to the other, for example through the hatchery in- 198 dustry, has artificially decreased differentiation among populations. origin of portuguese hatchery fish and management implications hatchery populations in denmark, france, spain and italy all had a northern atlantic origin (kri- eg & guyomard 1985; garcia-marin et al. 1991, 1998; presa et al. 1994). however, fish from the torno hatchery is genetically dissimilar from the northwestern atlantic group and is therefore un- likely to originate from the corresponding area. a purely mediterranean origin is also unlikely be- cause it is polymorphic at some loci that are monomorphic in populations from the mediter- ranean group. it is unlikely to originate from spanish hatchery populations because stocking in- cidences from those can be detected using ldh- c* as a diagnostic marker (garcia-marin et al. 1991; moran et al. 1991; martinez et al. 1993; ari- as et al. 1995; garcia-marin et al. 1998). by de- fault we assume a local, southwestern atlantic ori- gin. the absence of variation at two loci that are normally polymorphic in this group may be due to a small size of the original stock (“founder ef- fect”). alternatively, torno fish could be not strictly autochtonous, i.e. not from the lima basin, but originate from populations that were not yet investigated, such as those from the douro and mondego river basins, which regularly serve as source for stocking operations (local hatchery au- thorities, personal communication). continuous recuperation is common procedure in the main- tenance of hatchery populations and most hatch- ery stock is of mixed origin. the comparative data for the three natural populations and the torno hatchery warrant further consideration. despite intensive torno hatchery stocking over many years and localities in the lima basin (local hatch- ery authorities, personal communication), a strong influence of these activities is not apparent (table 2, fig. 2). rather, the divergent allele frequencies of the hatchery sample at the four polymorphic loci suggest no displacement and minimal intro- gression of hatchery and wild populations. these possibilities deserve more detailed examination with regard to the effectiveness of hatchery pro- grams, the dynamics of hatchery and wild fish in- teractions, and the protection and value of native populations. the puzzling case of allele tf*95 the survey of the tf* locus in natural portuguese populations revealed the existence of the *95 and *lo0 alleles. the tf*100 allele is usually fixed in atlantic populations (krieg & guyomard 1985; presa et al. 1994), while the tf*95 allele was so far only reported in frequencies lower than 0.14 in trout from tributaries of the upper rhone and the upper po in switzerland (largiadkr & scholl 1995; largiader et al. 1996). portuguese natural popula- tions possess this allele at frequencies of ca. 0.35. the allele is further present at the southern limits of the brown_trout distribution in portugal where, at the upper ranges of the river zezere, it reaches a frequency of 0.80 (a. antunes, unpublished re- sults). the simultaneous presence of the tf*95 al- lele in portuguese and mediterranean trout is puz- zling. either a single tf*95 allele exists, identical in portuguese and mediteranean populations, or the gene product referred to as tf*95, although indistinguishable by electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point, is distinct from the *95 allele found in mediterranean populations. the first hypothesis would suggest common ancestry, in which case the tf* locus would be a good candi- date to help uncover the trout dispersal pattern. in the absence of the anadromous form south of 42" latitude, contemporary gene flow between iberian and mediterranean populations is unlikely. further investigation is required to clarify these issues. promising strategies would include (1) the study of the tf* locus in selected populations from the iberian peninsula and adjacent mediter- ranean areas and (2) the gene sequencing of vari- ous electrophoretic tf* variants. similarly, the presence in high frequencies of some alleles at the ldh-a2* and mep-3* loci in both mediterran- ean populations and in populations from the river guadalquivir in southwestern spain may indicate historical gene flow between those areas or even the merging of atlantic and mediterranean groups (garcia-marin & pla 1996). 1. en 247 individuos, procedentes de tres afluentes de la cuenca del rio lima y de una piscifactoria a1 n de portugal, examina- mos
