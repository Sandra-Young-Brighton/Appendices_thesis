wood et al. 2005), (2) elimination of reproductive habitat for crevice and benthic spawning ﬁshes (burkhead & jelks 2001; sutherland 2007), (3) direct physical damage and physiological stress for both macroinvertebrates and ﬁshes (newcombe & macdonald 1991; sutherland & meyer 2007) and (4) reductions in the visual ability of ﬁshes to locate and capture prey (barrett et al. 1992; zamor & grossman 2007). doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00359.x 427 hazelton & grossman although, turbidity clearly is an important agent of habitat degradation in streams, there are few studies detailing its effects on noncommercially important stream ﬁsh species, despite their dominance of assemblages (matthews 1998). in addition, most studies focus on the effects of turbidity on foraging success of single species (sweka & hartman 2001; zamor & grossman 2007), rather than elucidating its effects on intra- or interspeciﬁc behavioural interac- tions. because many stream ﬁshes are found in multispeciﬁc groups, these effects may be particularly important (freeman & grossman 1992a; b; freeman & grossman 1993; grossman et al. 1998; matthews 1998). in one of the few extant studies, berg & northcote (1985) showed that turbidities above 20 nephelometric turbidity units (ntu) reduced prey capture success and intraspeciﬁc aggression fourfold in both aggressive and nonaggressive juvenile coho salmon (onchorychus kisutch). dominant coho sal- mon consistently occupied focal positions at the front of the tank and captured signiﬁcantly more prey than subordinate individuals (berg & northcote 1985). in addition, vinyard & yuan (1996) demonstrated that reduced recruitment and growth of lacustrine lahontan cutthroat trout (onchorynchus clarki henshawi) may be a result of the introduction of lahontan redside (richadsonius egregious) which is a superior forager in turbidities found in the study habitat (summit lake, ne). studies of the effects of turbidity on interspeciﬁc interactions are especially important, because habitat degradation produced by increased turbidity also may favour more tolerant invasive species (scott & helfman 2001; scott et al. 2002; sutherland et al. 2002; walters et al. 2003; vogt 2004). (onchorynchus mykiss) changes in turbidity and velocity also may affect individual behaviour of ﬁshes, and how they search for prey. sweka & hartman (2001) found that rainbow trout increased movement with increases in turbidity. this was attributed to a switch to active prey searching behaviour, and resulted in more prey captures, but increased energy expenditure. focal point depth (distance to substrate) also is an important microhabitat parameter for drift feeding ﬁshes because it is potentially related to the amount of energy expended per prey captured (grossman & ratajczak 1998; grossman et al. 2002). furthermore, changes in focal point depth may indicate changes in foraging behaviour, from drift feeding to more active benthic searching behaviour (piccolo et al. 2007). for the last 25 years we have been studying ﬁsh assemblages in the coweeta creek drainage of north carolina, usa. in the mid-1990s we observed the ﬁrst appearance of yellowﬁn shiners (notropis lutipinnis) in this system. although recent genetic studies indicate that yellowﬁn shiner may be native to the little 428 tennessee river, it has only recently invaded a number of smaller tributaries such as coweeta creek (scott et al. 2008, in press and w. l. mclarney, personal communication). both rosyside dace (clino- stomus funduloides) and yellowﬁn shiners are small- bodied (maximum length <13 cm), drift-feeding minnows that belong to the mid-water microhabitat guild in coweta creek, nc, usa. (grossman et al. 1998). the species reproduce during summer and rosyside dace probably reach an age of at least four in coweeta creek (g. grossman, personal communica- tion). by contrast, yellowﬁn shiner likely only reach an age of 2+ and may die after reproducing (goforth & foltz 1998). rosyside dace are a species of special concern in north carolina and are distributed from north georgia to ohio (zamor & grossman 2007). by contrast, yellowﬁn shiners have a much more restricted distribution and are native to atlantic slope drainages in both georgia and north carolina (etnier & starnes 1993), and are more abundant in degraded streams with higher sedimentation rates (scott et al. 2002; price & leigh 2006). wagner (2004) studied the interspeciﬁc interactions between rosyside dace and )1) yellowﬁn shiner at two velocities (10 and 20 cmæs and found that yellowﬁn shiner aggressively domi- nated rosyside dace at both velocities. dominance in these species resulted in having a move forward position in the tank, and hence, increased access to food. nonetheless, rosyside dace caught more prey at higher velocities than yellowﬁn shiners and hence, may be able to coexist because of this ability (wagner 2004). given the characteristics of rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiner and increasing environmental change in the study region (scott et al. 2002; sutherland et al. 2002), we examined how the combined effects of turbidity and an invader might inﬂuence future population status of rosyside dace. consequently, we conducted a multifactorial experiment in which we examined the effects of physical (turbidity and veloc- ity) and biological factors (length, intra- and interspe- ciﬁc competition) on focal point depth, movement rate, dominance and aggression in native rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiner. methods experimental procedures conducted using the experiments were 3.0 m (l) · 0.75 m (w) · 1.0 m (h) plexiglas artiﬁcial ﬂume of zamor & grossman (2007), powered by two 36 kg thrust electric trolling motors. however, we reduced the test chamber to 1.6 m · 0.45 m · 0.5 m to facil- itate identiﬁcation of individual ﬁsh. this system produced semi-laminar ﬂow, and during experiments )1, rosyside dace = 16 cmæs velocities were constantly monitored and varied )1 throughout the water column. test veloc- <3 cmæs ities were average tank velocities measured at 60% depth. the substratum consisted of a 4-cm layer of pebbles (maximum diameter 50 mm), marked with a 1 cm grid for location of test specimens. we held ph and water temperatures at 7.0 and 10–12 °c respec- tively, which corresponded to spring and fall temper- atures in coweta creek (grossman & ratajczak 1998). we tested ﬁsh at two velocities (12 and )1) that bracketed the optimal focal point 18 cmæs velocities for these species in coweta creek (yellowﬁn )1; shiner = 13 cmæs grossman et al. 2002). we tested ﬁsh at three turbidities (10, 20 and 30 ntu) using a natural, commercially available local substratum – red clay (see zamor & grossman 2007). turbidity treatments represent moderately impacted to heavily impacted streams in this region (sutherland et al. 2002; price & leigh 2006). to facilitate observations at 30 ntu, the test chamber was reduced to 1.6 m · 0.45 m · 0.5 m. we tested ﬁve species · density combinations: two and four rosyside dace (intraspeciﬁc rosyside dace trials), two and four yellowﬁn shiners (intraspeciﬁc trials), and two of each species yellowﬁn shiner (interspeciﬁc competition trial), for a total of 30 treatment combinations. each treatment was replicated three times, with the exception of four replicates of: )1; two four rosyside dace at 10 ntu and 12 cmæs )1; two rosyside rosyside dace at 20 ntu and 12 cmæs )1; four yellowﬁn shiners dace at 30 ntu and 12 cmæs )1; two yellowﬁn shiners at 30 at 20 ntu and 18 cmæs )1. we conducted a total of 95 trials. ntu and 18 cmæs test specimens were collected from coweta creek and other headwater streams within the little tennes- see drainage between november and april of 2005, 2006 and 2007. we collected ﬁsh using a backpack electroﬁsher (smith-root, model lr-24) and nets (zamor & grossman 2007). dip nets also were used to hand capture ﬁsh from large pools (>1.5 m deep). we discarded all specimens that displayed evidence of physiological stress or collecting injuries. following collection, we held rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiner for 2 days in separate 1150l recirculating systems maintained at 10–12 °c, ph of 7.0–7.2, and 12 h:12 h, photoperiod. fishes were fed meal worms (tenebrio molitor) ad libitum once daily. the mean length and mass of specimens were:rosyside dace n = 152; sl ± sd = 65 mm ± 9; mass ± sd = 3.7 g ± 1.0 shiners n = 150; sl ± sd = 64 mm ± 7; mass ± sd = 3.7 g ± 1.2, and we restricted length ranges of ﬁsh used in trials to minimise length effects (see below). after acclimation we anaesthetised (ms-222; ross & ross 1999) and tagged ﬁsh with unique coloured light:dark yellowﬁn and dace foraging competition and turbidity plastic discs (3.0 mm diameter, black, white, yellow and clear) located just posterior to the dorsal ﬁn (wagner 2004). these tags do not affect general or feeding behaviour of the experimental subjects (wag- ner 2004), and we found no signiﬁcant difference in the aggression received by any colour (hazelton and grossman, unpublished data). following tagging and a short recovery period, we returned ﬁsh to holding tanks for a minimum of 2 days to ensure adequate posttagging recovery. the holding system was treated )1 to with kanamycin sulphate at a dose of 3 mgæl reduce infection from tagging (wagner 2004). fish were placed in a second holding tank, prior to use in experiments, and fasted for 2 days to ensure that all specimens experienced similar hunger levels. a 2-day period ensured that specimens had evacuated their stomach and intestinal contents (hazelton, unpub- lished data). each specimen was used in only one trial. aggression, dominance, position and ﬁsh length in preliminary trials we distinguished four aggressive behaviours exhibited by both species: (1) flash – behavioural display involving parallel swimming, ﬁn ﬂaring or a positioning of the body by tilting the dorsum towards the recipient (berg & northcote 1985), (2) chase – aggressor pursues a retreating recipient, (3) charge – aggressor accelerates directly towards a recipient but does not chase or make contact and (4) nip – aggressor bites recipient, usually on the anal or caudal ﬁn. we used videography to quantify behavioural interactions and recorded the time of each aggressive act to the nearest second. still examined the although length differences among ﬁsh in trials were less than 10 mm, with one exception (15 mm difference), we relationship between length and aggression. we ranked individ- uals by length within a trial from smallest (one) to largest (four) in four ﬁsh trials and small (one) and large (two) for two ﬁsh trials. for each density, we tested whether the per cent of aggressive acts received within the trial was signiﬁcantly affected by length rank using one-way anova with tukey’s (honestly signiﬁcant differences hsd) tests (dow- dy et al. 2004). we performed a similar analysis on the per cent of aggressive acts initiated by each length rank. finally, we tested whether length was related to dominance, because the dominant ﬁsh (see below) was not always the most aggressive. we used chi-squared tests for independence (dowdy et al. 2004) on dominance ranks and length ranks to determine if these two variables were independent within a trial. we analysed two and four ﬁsh trials separately. we constructed linear dominance hierarchies for each trial based on the number of aggressive acts 429 hazelton & grossman initiated or received (grossman 1980; rincon & grossman 2001). in brief, a dominant ﬁsh initiated more aggressive acts than it received (grossman 1980; rincon & grossman 2001). assuming that hierarchies are linear, a dominant ﬁsh is dominant over all other individuals subordinate to any challenger that it has defeated (de vries 1998). we used this format to identify three different dominance levels: one – subordinate, two – subdominant and three – dominant. in two ﬁsh trials typically there was only a subordinate and a dominant. for four ﬁsh trials, there was typically one dominant (three), one subdominant (two) and two subordinates (one). however, in the case of a tie in four ﬁsh trials, we assigned both ﬁsh to the same rank. we tested whether one species was dominant over another by determining if species and dominance rank were independent in interspeciﬁc trials using a chi- squared test. in four ﬁsh trials, we tested whether dominant ﬁsh occupied the ﬁrst (most upstream) position in a group more frequently than expected by chance and whether subordinate ﬁsh occupied the positions three and four (most downstream) more frequently than expected by chance. we used chi-squared tests for independence (dowdy et al. 2004) to test for the independence of position and dominance for both species. we tested data from two and four ﬁsh intraspeciﬁc trials separately. per capita aggression rates, focal point depth and movement rates to examine the relationships between turbidity, focal point depth, intraspeciﬁc aggression and interspeciﬁc interactions; we quantiﬁed per capita aggression rates at the trial level by calculating the total number of aggressive acts in a trial divided by number of ﬁsh in the trial, and then standardising the result per unit time (acts ⁄ ﬁsh ⁄ min, wagner 2004). we quantiﬁed focal point depth as the distance from an individual ﬁsh to the substratum (cm) at 1-min intervals over each trial. we then calculated the mean distance from the substratum for each ﬁsh, and used this as the response variable. we measured movement as the distance between points travelled by each individual along x, y and z coordinates of the experimental ﬂume, at 2-min intervals. estimating ﬁsh location along the width of the tank (z coordinate) was difﬁcult at higher turbid- ities. to compensate, we divided the tank into three lanes of equal distance across the width of the tank and recorded the lane occupied by each ﬁsh. we then assigned a z coordinate based on the median value of that lane. movement rates were calculated by dividing the mean movement by the number of minutes in the trial. these estimates actually underestimated true movement, because they assumed that all movement was linear. we examined the effects of turbidity, velocity and competition on per capita aggression rate, focal point depth and movement rates of ﬁshes using linear models and aikaike’s information criterion. for analyses of focal point depth and movement, we constructed a set of 10 a priori conceptual models including: main effects of environmental, behavioural and competition parameters; and interaction effects (table 1). environmental variables included: turbidity – measured as the mean experimental value in the trial in ntu, and velocity – measured as the treatment )1). competition variables included: level (12, 18 cmæs table 1. candidate models used to evaluate the relative importance of environmental and behavioural variables affecting foraging behaviour of rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiners. no. model name hypothesis models 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 global environmental competition behavioral environmental and competition environmental and behavioral behavioral and competition species · environmental all main effects and interactions will change response parameter response is dependent on changes in environmental stimuli response is dependent on species and type of competition response is dependent on species, ﬁsh length and dominance rank response is dependent on both environmental and competition factors response is dependent on species environmental and behavioural factors response is dependent on species, dominance rank, ﬁsh length and type of competition response is dependent on species and changes with level of environmental factors 9  dominance · environmental response is dependent on dominance rank and changes with level of 10 species · competition environmental factors response is dependent on species and changes with type of competition y = velocity + turbidity y = species + interspeciﬁc + intraspeciﬁc y = species + dominance + length y = velocity + turbidity + species + interspeciﬁc + intraspeciﬁc y = velocity + turbidity + species + dominance + length y = species + dominance + length + interspeciﬁc + intraspeciﬁc y = species + velocity + turbidity + species · velocity + species · turbidity y = dominance + velocity + turbidity + dominance · velocity + dominance · turbidity y = species + interspeciﬁc + intraspeciﬁc + species · interspeciﬁc + species · intraspeciﬁc  model 9 was not used in analysis of per capita aggression because dominance was measured at the focal ﬁsh level, and per capita aggression was measured for each trial (group of ﬁsh). 430 species – binary coded 0 = c. funduloides, 1 = n. lutipinnis;

length – standard length of the focal ﬁsh. because per capita aggression rates were calculated for groups of ﬁsh rather than individuals, we omitted dominance and the model for species · interspeciﬁc competition because these parameters were measured at the focal ﬁsh level. we also modiﬁed the length parameter as the mean standard length of all ﬁsh in the trial (mean length). this resulted in ﬁtting only nine of the candidate models used for the other analyses (table 1). represent we assessed the relative abilities of the competing models to explain information in the data using akaike’s information criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (aicc; hurvich & tsai 1989). models with low, daic values and high akaike weights (wi) lose little of the information present in the data, and hence best the processes affecting the response variable (burnham & anderson 2002; grossman et al. 2006). to control for multicolinearity, we conducted a pearson correlation analysis on all pairs of variables and deleted one of each pair that had r2 values >0.25. sex of ﬁsh and seasonality of trial did not covary with either response variable, and we therefore excluded them from all analyses. we exam- ined data normality through normal probability plots and found few substantial deviations from normality. using the criterion of burnham & anderson (2002), we interpreted models that had wi values >10% of the model with the highest wi value. interpretable models were used to calculate model - averaged parameter dace foraging competition and turbidity estimates and unconditional standard errors weighted by akaike weights (burnham & anderson 2002). we calculated 95% conﬁdence intervals around these estimates and interpreted parameters with conﬁdence intervals that did not overlap zero (grossman et al. 2006). results aggression, dominance, position and ﬁsh length regardless of species, larger ﬁsh initiated a signiﬁ- cantly larger proportion of aggressive acts than smaller individuals in two ﬁsh trials (n = 38 trials, d.f. = 1, f = 9.05, p = 0.0037), and the same result obtained for the largest and smallest ﬁsh in four ﬁsh trials (initiated: n = 71, d.f. = 3, f = 2.78, p = 0.042, fig. 1). in both two and four ﬁsh trials we found that larger ﬁsh tended to be dominant more often than smaller ﬁsh (two ﬁsh trials – n = 38, d.f. = 1, v2 = 3.225, p = 0.0725; four ﬁsh trials – n = 56, d.f. = 6, v2 = 14.992, p = 0.0203, fig. 1). the spe- cies also exhibited differences in dominance in (n = 18, d.f. = 2, v2 = 7.042, interspeciﬁc p < 0.0296). in these trials yellowﬁn shiner were the dominant or subdominant ﬁsh 64% of the time as opposed to 33% for rosyside dace (fig. 2). the dominant ﬁsh occupied the most upstream (i.e., ﬁrst) position with a signiﬁcantly greater frequency in all two ﬁsh trials – trials for rosyside dace (fig. 3: n = 19, d.f. = 1, v2 = 6.465, p = 0.011;

(tables 2 and 3). parameter estimates indicated that trials containing ﬁsh with a mean length 15 mm greater than other trials would have a 39% increase in per capita aggression (1.60 acts ⁄ ﬁsh ⁄ min)

and were viewed as not interpretable. )1 increased movement discussion our data show that physical and behavioural factors best explain variation in dominance, access to prey, aggression, focal point depth and movement rate of native rosyside dace and invasive yellowﬁn shiner. speciﬁcally, the main effects of turbidity, velocity, length and interactions involving species and intra- speciﬁc competition all were capable of explaining information contained in the data set. in some cases the species displayed similar patterns with larger ﬁsh: (1) being dominant, (2) moving less and (3) occupying more proﬁtable foraging positions. nonetheless, despite being matched for length, yellowﬁn shiners dominated rosyside dace in behavioural interactions. dominant ﬁsh typically occupied better foraging positions; therefore the invasive species has the potential to negatively affect the native via interspe- ciﬁc competition. changing physical conditions may affect the forag- ing behaviour of stream ﬁshes (matthews 1998). yellowﬁn shiners are less efﬁcient drift feeders than )1 and presumably also at rosyside dace at 20 cmæs higher velocities (wagner 2004; rincon et al. 2007). in a previous study, we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in capture success between these species at )1 (hazelton & grossman velocities up to 18 cmæs 2009). nonetheless, our results indicate that ﬁsh held positions farther from the substratum at higher veloc- ities, and higher velocities were linked with increases in movement rates. these shifts could subject rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiners to increased focal point velocities and increased energy expenditures while foraging (hill & grossman 1993; grossman et al. 2002). in fact, we observed yellowﬁn shiners holding closer to the substratum and acquiring more old prey items from the bottom (p. d. hazelton, personal communication). sweka & hartman (2001) found that 434 high turbidities produced similar shifts in brook_trout foraging behaviour, as well as weight loss. behavioural factors such as dominance also affected foraging behaviour and interacted with physical fac- tors. dominant ﬁsh had higher movement rates and higher capture success than subordinates regardless of species (hazelton & grossman 2009). whether this results in an increase in net energy gain is unknown. when both turbidity and velocity increased, both species captured fewer prey by via forward movement, and captured greater numbers of prey via lateral or downstream captures. this likely resulted in an increase in energy expended per prey captured, because ﬁsh exposed their lateral proﬁle to the current rather than their cross-section (hazelton & grossman 2009). consequently, increased turbidity probably will reduce individual ﬁtness in these species via increased foraging costs. we are assuming that mealworms adequately represented natural prey, but both species are opportunistic feeders (etnier & starnes 1993) and it is likely that similar patterns are manifested in with natural prey (freeman & grossman 1992b). previous research on the effects of turbidity and velocity on foraging behaviour of stream ﬁshes has shown that both moderate and high turbidities (barrett et al. 1992; zamor & grossman 2007) and velocities (piccolo et al. 2008) may negatively affect foraging success of stream ﬁshes. zamor & grossman (2007) found that reactive distance of rosyside dace was signiﬁcantly reduced from  45 to 30 cm with an increase in turbidity from 0 to 10 ntu. wagner (2004) found that dominant rosyside dace and yellowﬁn shiners had higher prey capture rates in intraspeciﬁc trials, however, yellowﬁn shiner were more aggressive and dominated rosyside dace at lower velocities (wagner 2004). nonetheless, at higher velocities rosyside dace captured more prey than yellowﬁn shiners (wagner 2004). with increases in turbidity found in moderately impacted streams in the region (sutherland et al. 2002; price & leigh 2006), the competitive balance between these species may shift so that yellowﬁn shiners will be dominant regardless of velocity. our results also may explain why rosyside dace are often absent from disturbed watersheds in the region (sutherland et al. 2002; vogt 2004; scott 2006). these streams typically have increased turbidities as well as lower velocities (sutherland et al. 2002; vogt 2004; scott 2006) and generally maintain substantial populations of more tolerant species including yellowﬁn shiner (vogt 2004; scott 2006). our results suggest that the combination of reduced velocities and higher turbidities may limit rosyside dace, and give yellowﬁn shiner a competitive advantage. fine sediments also may harm stream ﬁshes via reducing prey diverse mechanisms including: (1) availability, (2) direct physical harm (berkman & rabeni 1987), (3) increased predation risk (miner & stein 1996) and (4) reduced breeding success (burk- head & jelks 2001; sutherland 2007). however, the sediment loads necessary to produce these effects are likely to be larger than those associated with reduced foraging ability (berkman & rabeni 1987). as a consequence, studies of the effects of turbidity on the foraging behaviour of stream ﬁshes may yield insights into the potential population-level effects of increased sedimentation in a watershed, long before prey populations crash or reproductive habitat is ﬁlled. our results may yield insights into the future distributions of yellowﬁn shiners and rosyside dace in this region. it is unlikely that increased predation pressure would differentially affect these species because they have similar morphologies and ecologies (grossman et al. 2002; rincon et al. 2007). similarly, both species are nest associates of nest-building ﬁshes such as nocomis, campostoma and semotilus, so they are unlikely to be differentially affected by sedimen- tation of reproductive habitat (etnier & starnes 1993). in addition, one nest builder creek chub (semotilus atromaculatus) increases in abundance in degraded streams in the region (scott 2001; vogt 2004). consequently, we cannot predict how this interaction will play out across the region, even though yellowﬁn shiners appear to dominate rosyside dace under some conditions. conversely, as shown by wagner (2004) rosyside dace may always have a refuge in higher velocity microhabitats in regional streams, as long as turbidities are relatively low. we have demonstrated that multiple physical, behavioural and competitive factors can explain variation in foraging behaviour of native rosyside dace and invasive yellowﬁn shiners. although, the turbidities used in experiments occur only during storm events in lightly disturbed streams in the little tennessee drainage region, they are common in disturbed streams (bolstad & swank 1997; sutherland et al. 2002; price & leigh 2006). we suggest that the negative impacts of turbidity on foraging behaviour of native south-eastern stream ﬁshes may be partially responsible for their declines in disturbed habitats, especially given that more tolerant species are abun- dant in these habitats (scott et al. 2002; sutherland et al. 2002; walters et al. 2003). that controlling stream sedimentation and other aspects of habitat degradation will be necessary to maintain habitat for rosyside dace and other sensitive native species in the southern appalachian region. is clear it acknowledgements financial support of this project was provided by the usda. forest service mcintire-stennis program (grants geo-00114- dace foraging
