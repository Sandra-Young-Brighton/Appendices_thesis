kajaaninjoki in finland. northern pike is the main predator in many lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere. previous tagging studies have shown a general tendency to sedentary behaviour by pike. whether individuals in a ﬁsh population adapt a sedentary or moving strategy may affect population persistence. to study if the spawning population consists of sedentary or moving individuals and the pattern of movements, we tagged 40 pike with radio transmitters and followed them from may 2002 to june 2003. pike were caught and tagged during the spawning season in the mouth of the river kajaaninjoki which ﬂows into one of the largest lakes in finland, lake ouluja¨rvi. our results suggest that the pike spawning population consisted of sedentary pike (n ¼ 16) dwelling the whole year in the river, and moving pike (n ¼ 24) which moved to lake ouluja¨rvi after the spawning period. pike exhibited homing behaviour, as most of the migrating pike returned to the same spawning area in the following year. large pike had a higher movement rate than small pike during the summer and seasonally the movement rate was lowest during the spring and highest during the summer. t. vehanen, p.

teppo.vehanen@rktl.ﬁ accepted for publication january 24, 2006 introduction northern pike (esox lucius l.) is the top predatory ﬁsh species in many waters in the northern hemisphere. in most countries in the region pike has both commercial and recreational value (crossman & casselman 1987; raat 1988). pike is a typical sit-and-wait predator which usually hunts prey by ambushing (webb & skadsen 1980). vegetation is an important part of a pike habitat, especially for spawning and nursery areas (bry 1996). vegetation acts as cover from predation and cannibalism and also provides a habitat for young pike to lie and wait for prey. however, size is likely to affect habitat use, as large pike are often found outside vegetation (chapman & mackay 1984). pike are capable of occupying many types of macrohabitats and it is present in lakes and rivers as well as in brackish water in the sea area. tagging studies have demonstrated general infor- mation about sedentary behaviour of pike (kaukoranta & lind 1975; mu¨ller 1986; kara˚s & lehtonen 1993; craig 1996). sedentary behaviour has been attributed, for example, to a poor swimming capacity or a general tendency to not search actively for prey by swimming. most studies on pike movements, however, have been mark-recapture studies which do not reveal move- ments between release and recapture, or are relatively short-term studies and thus do not include any possible seasonal differences. previous work has shown that individual pike tend to return to the spawning ground they used in the previous year (kara˚s & lehtonen 1993; miller et al. 2001). homing could be the result of active migration or just the ﬁsh returning because they have no alternative spawning ground (lucas & baras 2001). according to malinin (1969) most ﬁsh populations consist of mobile and sedentary 154 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00151.x northern pike movements and habitat use outflow lake oulujärvi finland norway n sweden automatic

whether individuals in a pike spawning population consists of sedentary or moving individuals. also to study the magnitude and pattern of these movements by adults we tagged 40 pike with radio transmitters. materials and methods study area river during the the movements of adult pike were investigated in the mouth of the river kajaaninjoki, which ﬂows into lake ouluja¨rvi (928 m2 ) (fig. 1). the mean ﬂow in )1 53.6 m3æs the (sd ¼ 37.4). the study area of the river kajaaninjoki was 9 km long, starting from a¨ mma¨koski dam, which ﬁsh cannot pass, and ﬂowing downstream to palta- salmi strait, which separates the river from lake ouluja¨rvi (fig. 1). below a¨ mma¨nkoski dam the river widens out from 30–50 to 300–1000 m with depths of study was up to 19.5 m in the main channel. excluding the uppermost part of the study area, the shorelines in the area are shallow and vegetated. water horsetail (equisetum ﬂuviatile) and common reed (phargmites australis) are frequent. shallow bays also include yellow waterlily (nuphar lutea), waterlily (nymphaea alba collectively), perfoliate pondweed (potamogeton perfoliatus), broad-leaved pondweed (potamogeton natans) and bur-reed (sparganium gramineum). tagging radiotransmitters were surgically implanted in 40 pike captured by seine net (22), trap net (13), gill net (3) and angling (2) (23 males and 17 females). the mean weight of the ﬁsh was 2043 g (1100–4590 g) and the length 674 mm (578–922 mm). their age was deter- mined from scales. the pike were 6–12 (mean 7.5, sd ¼ 1.3) years old. they were caught during the spawning season of may 10–23, 2002 from different parts of the study area. after tagging, each ﬁsh was returned to the same site where it was caught. 155 vehanen et al. the water during tagging, temperature varied between 7.6 and 10.2 °c. the pike were anaesthetised with benzocaine and tagged on a plastic sheet. the weight and length of the ﬁsh were measured. radio transmitters used were cylindrical (lotek, mcft-3a; lotek wireless inc., newmarket, on, canada), 60-mm long, 20-mm wide and weighed 16 g. the expected battery life was 397 days with operational frequency between 148 and 151 mhz. each transmit- ter was surgically implanted through a 4-cm incision in front of the pelvic girdle. a shielded-needle technique (adams et al. 1998) was used to guide the ﬂexible whip antenna through the body wall posterior to the incision. the incision was closed with three sutures and the antenna was shortened to level with the tip of the caudal ﬁn. surgery lasted for 3–4 min and after which the ﬁsh recovered for c. 30 min prior to release at the original place of capture. tracking the pike were followed between 24 may, 2002 and 23 july, 2003. an automated tracking station (als) (lotek srx_400; lotek wireless inc., newmarket, on, canada) with a nine-element yagi-antenna was installed in paltasalmi strait, the boundary between the river kajaaninjoki and lake ouluja¨rvi and the border of the research area. the tracking station recorded ﬁsh moving between the study area and lake ouluja¨rvi. the station searched each frequency at 3-s intervals. before the start of the study, the datalogger was adjusted to ensure that no tagged ﬁsh could pass the strait without being observed. tracking covered the whole strait. however, the test indicated that tagged pike using the narrow and deep (15 m) channel in the middle of the strait at depths >10 m would have been missed by the als. therefore the station may have missed some pike moving between the river kajaa- ninjoki and lake ouluja¨rvi. daily manual trackings of pike at 24 h )1 intervals were done between 24 may to 24 june, 2002 and 27 may to 17 june, 2003. the pike were tracked from a small boat by a lotek srx_400-receiver and a ﬁve- element yagi-antenna. the ﬁsh were approached at low speed, with the engine turned off, and the location was deﬁned by searching for the strongest signal obtain- able. the ﬁsh were recorded directly on expanded maps and a gps device was used to obtain the coordinates. the water depth was measured with a meter stick or echo sounder (lowrance x60; lowrance electronics inc., tulsa, ok, usa). the vegetation cover (% of the area) was estimated from a circle (5 m radius) around the pike’s location. submerged veget- ation was not included in vegetation cover estimates. weekly manual trackings of the pike were recorded throughout the study from 24 may, 2002 to 17 june, 156 2003. during the summer, tracking was done from a small boat. ice covered the research area almost totally between 6 november, 2002 and 14 may, 2003. when the ice was thick enough locations of the pike was done when skiing or from a snowmobile. in the period 6–29 november, 2002, and 4 april to 14 may, 2003 the ice cover was too weak and the pike were located from land by triangulation. the ﬁsh that moved away from the study area to lake ouluja¨rvi were occasion- ally tracked from a boat and during the winter 2002– 2003 from a snowmobile. data handling coordinates of the pike locations were incorporated into a arcviewreg gis program (esri inc., redlands, ca, usa). linear distances between daily or weekly locations were calculated. for the data handling we classiﬁed those pike that remained in the area of river kajaaninjoki as sedentary pike and those that moved between lake ouluja¨rvi and river kajaaninjoki as moving pike. we used temperature regimes to divide the study period into four seasons: summer (28 may to 13 september, 2002 and 26 may to 24 august, 2003; temperature >10 °c), autumn (14 september to 12 october, 2002; 0–10 °c), winter (13 october, 2002 to 9 april, 2003; <0 °c) and spring (10 april to 25 may; 2003, 0–10 °c) (finnish meteorological society). weekly locations were used to compare the move- ments and habitat use by the pike between seasons. movements and habitat use variables (mean veget- ation cover, water depth, log-transformed to stabilise variances) were related to water temperature and length of ﬁsh using the pearson correlation analysis. an ancova was used to test the possible effect of gender (male, female) and moving strategy (sedentary, moving pike) on movements (distance between daily locations) or water depth used by pike adjusted by the weight of the ﬁsh (covariate). some tagged ﬁsh left the study area rapidly and only a few observations of their movements and habitat use were obtained. fish with less than four observations were removed from the analysis. thus 34 ﬁsh were used in the statistical analyses. an ancova was also used to test for the possible seasonal effects (summer, autumn, winter, spring) on movements (dis- tances between weekly locations) adjusted by the weight of ﬁsh (covariate). an anova was used to test for the possible differences between two summers in daily movements. we used the kernel method to estimate home range areas (least squared cross-valid- ation) based on weekly locations throughout the year for the pike that remained in the study area during the whole study period. for each pike, 95% and 50% utilization distribution boundaries were deﬁned using animal movement analysis (hooge & eichenlaub 1997). results general behaviour of the 40 tagged pike 16 ﬁsh stayed in the study area in the river kajaaninjoki throughout the study period. we classiﬁed them as sedentary pike. altogether 24 pike used the study area as temporary habitat: they either moved shortly after spawning or during the summer and autumn for wintering in lake ouluja¨rvi. we classiﬁed these 24 pike as moving pike. only six of 16 sedentary pike were tracked during the entire study period (to 17 june, 2003). local ﬁshermen caught eight pike in gill nets and with lures, two during the summer and six during the winter. the destiny of two pike remained unclear: their tags were found lying on the river bottom without any remains of the ﬁsh. of 24 pike that moved to lake ouluja¨rvi, ﬁshermen caught six and returned the tags. one ﬁsh was caught in a trap net, one by angling, three in gill nets and one pike’s tag was found by a customer who had bought the ﬁsh home from the ﬁsh market in helsinki, c. 550 km south of the tagging area. according to monitoring in lake ouluja¨rvi, most of the pike did not stay in the vicinity of the study area but spread widely in lake ouluja¨rvi. four ﬁsh were located only in lake ouluja¨rvi after they left the study area. however, 14 pike showed homing behaviour and returned to the study area in the river kajaaninjoki for spawning during spring 2003. of the 14 pike that returned for spawning, six were active in the study area to the end of the study, three were caught in the study area by ﬁshermen and ﬁve moved back to lake ouluja¨rvi (two of them were caught by ﬁshermen in lake ouluja¨rvi during the study period by trawlers). northern pike movements and habitat use temperature distance 20 15 10 5 0 c ° e r u t a r e p m

pike moved less during the spring compared with other seasons (fig. 2) (ancova, f ¼ 10.58, p < 0.01, d.f. ¼ 3). movements based on locations between weekly observations increased compared to other seasons and also varied more in summer. movements started to decline in the autumn and during winter the level of movement was low (fig. 2). likewise in the summer, individuals with larger body weight moved more compared with smaller pike (signiﬁcant covari- ate, ancova, f ¼ 5.70, p < 0.05, d.f. ¼ 1). there were no signiﬁcant differences in the water depth used by pike between seasons. the mean water depth of pike locations was 3.2 ± 3.5 m (mean ± sd) during the summer, 3.3 ± 3.4 m during the autumn, 2.2 ± 2.9 m during the winter and 3.5 ± 4.8 m during the spring. the mean size of 95% of the home range area was (n ¼ 16, median ¼ 99 m2, min ¼ 18 m2, 157 m2 fig. 3. home ranges (kernel method) based on weekly relocations of 14 sedentary pike in the study area between june 2002 and june 2003. the 95% (dark grey) and 50% (light grey) utilization distribution boundaries are presented. max ¼ 582 m2 ). sedentary pike had rather restricted home ranges (fig. 3): only among four pike the estimated home range area exceeded 200 m2. in some obviously preferred areas there was a substantial overlap among the home range areas (e.g. pike numbers 1, 2, 10 and 13, fig. 3), although they were generally separate from each other. none of the pike inhabited the nearby shallow lake, lake sokaja¨rvi. movements and habitat use during summer during summer the mean distance between daily pike locations was 303 m (n ¼ 1071, sd ¼ 649), varying 157 vehanen et al. from pike being found in the same spot to successive trackings to a maximum difference of 7432 m. a difference was found between summers of 2002 and 2003: during 2003 the pike moved signiﬁcantly more during the day (mean ¼ 414 m) than in 2002 (mean ¼ 262 m) (fig. 4, anova, f ¼ 4.23, p < 0.05, d.f. ¼ 1). this was probably caused by different water temperatures between the years: in 2002 the water temperature increased to 20 °c and movements declined whereas in 2003 the temperature increased slowly and stayed well below 15 °c during the study period (fig. 4). no signiﬁcant difference was found between sed- entary and moving pike in the daily distances during the summer. females (397 ± 623 m, mean ± sd) tended to move more than males (246 ± 658 m) but this was due to the female’s larger size, as body weight was a signiﬁcant factor in explaining differences in distances between pike locations (ancova, f ¼ 4.25, p < 0.05, d.f. ¼ 1). no signiﬁcant differences were found in the habitat use (water depth and vegetation cover) between sexes or moving/sedentary pike (p > 0.05). neither did the ﬁsh’s weight have an effect on habitat use. although vegetation cover was generally an important part of a pike habitat, the pike showed individual differences in their habitat use. some pike were always found in habitats with no vegetation cover and in relatively deep water depths whereas some individuals always used high vegetation cover and shallow water depths. the mean water depth of all pike locations was 2.9 m (n ¼ 1058, sd ¼ 3.6) varying from 0.2 to 19.5 m, and the vegetation cover percentage was 12% and 0–90% respectively (n ¼ 1069, sd ¼ 21). discussion almost all the pike (14 of 16) classiﬁed as sedentary pike had restricted home ranges and used a quite uniform habitat throughout the year. moving pike used the river area especially for spawning and some of them also spent the summer in the river area before departing to the lake for wintering. although these ﬁsh were only randomly located in the lake area, they obviously had larger home ranges and changed habitat between the river and lake environments during the year. several studies have indicated that adult pike are resident and do not move extensively (e.g. malinin 1969; lehtonen et al. 1983; mu¨ller 1986). mann (1980) suggested that most of the pike population consists of static ﬁsh, but some of the young ﬁsh in particular disperse more widely. jepsen et al. (2001) observed that the adult pike population in a small reservoir consisted of groups with different strategies: some live in a relatively narrow area while other individuals move more intensively. our results from the spawning population in the river kajaaninjoki showed that some of the spawning population were sedentary pike, most of them having a relatively narrow home range in the river. the others, however, moved to lake ouluja¨rvi and, according to the tag, returns (e.g. from trawlers) and trackings were widely dispersed in the lake, which is one of the largest in finland (928 km2 ). the fact that a spawning popu- lation consists of both sedentary and mobile individ- uals is likely to be beneﬁcial for the population (wootton 1998). in case of catastrophic events in the river, migratory individuals are still able to sustain the population. the differences between the earlier results of mainly resident behaviour can largely be attributed to differences in the methods: earlier passive tags, e.g. carlin tags, were mainly used. unlike telemetry passive tags do not, for example, reveal the informa- tion about a ﬁsh leaving the area and returning later. we observed the homing behaviour among adult pike. almost all the moving pike returned to the same spawning area in the following year. previous studies have also shown the homing behaviour among pike (frost & kipling 1967; kara˚s & lehtonen 1993; miller et al. 2001). in a large area pike can form several sympatric populations, separated by homing behaviour, although foraging habitats overlap (miller et al. 2001; rosell & macoscar 2002; westin & temperature distance 2000 2002 1000 0 24.5 03.6 13.06 date s n o i t a c o l n e e w t e b ) m ( e c n a t s i d 20 15 10 c o e r u t a r e p m e t 5 23.6 s n o i t a c o l n e e w t e b ) m ( e c n a t s i d 158 20 15 10 c o e r u t a r e p m e t 2000 2003 1000 0 24.5 03.6 13.06 date 5 23.6 fig. 4. mean daily distances (±se) between pike relocations during summer 2002 and 2003 in the study area. the dashed line shows the daily water temperature. limburg 2002). this is probably also the case in lake ouluja¨rvi, where our study area was only one of several spawning habitats. miller et al. (2001) reported that the maximum )1 distance travelled by tagged pike was 26.5 kmæday and chapman & mackay (1984) reported that pike can travel several kilometres in a few hours. the pike in our study area could move several kilometres (max- imum 7.4) or stay almost in the same spot all day long. although the rate of movement varied between individuals, the lower movement rate during summer 2002, when water temperature rose to 20 °c compared with summer 2003, suggested that high water temper- atures inhibited pike movements. we found a strong seasonal effect on pike movement: the movement rate was very low in the winter at very low temperatures and also during spawning season in the spring. we suggest that temperature may have an effect on pike movements as high and low water temperatures tended to decrease the movement rate. however, we cannot exclude the effect of, for example, the changing day length on seasonal movements. the pike is a visual predator and our work was done in northern conditions with large seasonal changes in water temperature and day length. casselman (1978) showed that the swim- ming activity of pike was correlated with temperature in the laboratory. in many ﬁeld studies, however, no difference between the level of movement was found (diana et al. 1977; rogers & bergersen 1995; jepsen et al. 2001). female pike in the study area moved more than the male but this could be due to their larger body size. according to minns (1995), ﬁsh with a larger body size have larger home ranges. vegetation is an important part of a pike’s habitat through the ﬁsh’s life span (raat 1988; bry 1996; casselman & lewis 1996). earlier studies have shown that while small pike are usually associated with vegetation, larger individuals more frequently inhabit a vegetation – open water interface or less-vegetated areas (grimm & backx 1990; casselman & lewis 1996). we found that adult pike used vegetation cover during the summer (there is practically no aquatic macrophytes present during the winter), but this varied widely between individuals. although most pike used vegetation cover to some extent, some individuals had their home range in open water with no vegetation cover. this suggests that pike may also select different foraging strategies. although the classical ambush attack from vegetation is the pike’s main predator behaviour (webb & skadsen 1980), this behaviour may be more ﬂexible. this was further supported by the tag returns from trawlers, where the pike caught were probably hunting for vendace or smelt in the open water. about 10% (5–10 tonnes) of the annual pike catch in the lake is caught by trawlers. however, northern pike movements and habitat use pike in our study were generally found in relatively shallow water (<5 m), but some individuals also used higher depths. our results are in accordance with those of casselman & lewis (1996), who observed that pike are usually found in shallow water (<4 m) but can also be found in relatively deep water. we observed a high ﬁshing mortality among the tagged adult pike during the 1-year study period. pike is an important game ﬁsh for recreational ﬁshery and also for some professional ﬁshermen in the area. the annual catch of pike is about 80 tonnes in lake ouluja¨rvi and, this is of commercial importance. a major part of the pike is caught during the spawning season by various netting and angling gears. the tag returns in our study also came from different gears: gill nets, trap nets, angling, trawling and hooks. the transmitters found on the river bottom with no remains could cause a misinterpretation of our data. these tags could have been expulsed. according to the ﬁshermen, however, all the caught pike were in good condition with no visible inﬂammation. another explanation could be that another pike ate the tagged ﬁsh and the tag is defecated to the bottom (e.g. jepsen et al. 1998; hyva¨rinen & vehanen 2004). the most logical explanation is that a ﬁsherman, having caught the ﬁsh, has thrown the tag away into the river either by mistake or on purpose. our main conclusion is that the pike spawning population consisted of sedentary pike dwelling the whole year in the river and moving pike. pike showed homing behaviour, as most of the migrating pike returned to the same spawning area in the following year. large pike had a higher movement rate than small pike and movement differed signiﬁcantly between seasons. acknowledgements we would like to thank ville leppa¨niemi, saku ivanov, ari kauttu and jaana kauttu for logistical
