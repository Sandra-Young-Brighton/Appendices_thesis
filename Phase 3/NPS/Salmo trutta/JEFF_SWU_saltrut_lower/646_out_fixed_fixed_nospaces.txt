mixed models; sacramento river; san joaquin river introduction their paciﬁc salmon (oncorhynchus spp.) are well known for long migrations between ocean feeding grounds and freshwater spawning and juvenile rear- ing habitats. although estuaries are only utilised dur- ing a relatively short portion of salmon life cycles, they can provide critical habitats for juveniles by providing quality-rearing habitat (gray et al. 2002; bottom et al. 2005a; greene et al. 2005) and support- ing life-history diversity within populations (bottom et al. 2005b). additionally, estuaries are where juve- niles make the critical physiological transitions that facilitate ocean residency (jobling 1995). as the importance of estuaries to salmon is better under- stood, they are more frequently targeted for restora- tion and conservation actions to support recovery of threatened salmon populations (simenstad & cordell 2000). understanding how improvements in estuarine conditions inﬂuence salmon populations is compli- cated both by the myriad of factors that inﬂuence sal- mon survival and by the large geographical area salmon require to complete their life cycle (bradford 1997). however, this understanding is essential for effective recovery of salmon populations. estuaries throughout the range of paciﬁc salmon have been degraded by freshwater diversion, wetland loss, pollution, diking, dredging and invasion by non- native species (simenstad & cordell 2000; borde et al. 2003). the san francisco estuary in california ranks as the largest estuary on the paciﬁc coast of north america and serves as a migration route for the southernmost spawning populations of chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tschawytscha). once support- ing spawning runs of an estimated 1–6 million adults (yoshiyama et al. 2001), the estuary has been subject correspondence: s. c. zeug, cramer fish sciences, 13300 new airport road, auburn, ca 95602, usa. e-mail: stevez@ﬁshsciences.net doi: 10.1111/eff.12013 157 zeug & cavallo to many of the alterations listed earlier beginning in the mid-19th century during california’s gold rush. presently, chinook salmon stocks that utilise the san francisco estuary are in a depressed state, including populations listed as threatened or endan- gered (williams 2006). as a result of declining adult salmon returns to upstream tributaries, considerable resources have been committed to improve conditions for juvenile salmon in the freshwater tidal reaches of the estuary; hereafter, referred to as the ‘delta’ (calfed 2007). this effort has largely focused on the manipulation of freshwater inﬂows from upstream and also through restriction of freshwater exports from two massive diversions within the delta (nmfs 2009). however, the beneﬁt of these actions for sal- mon at remains equivocal (brown et al. 2009). the population level hydrologic dynamics of the delta have been sig- niﬁcantly altered relative to historic conditions. how- ever, there have been concomitant changes in habitat quality, water quality, species assemblage structure and adult harvest (williams 2006). additionally, because salmon inhabit a wide range of habitats throughout their life, it is difﬁcult to detect whether incremental improvements in survival at a single life stage translate into enhanced population-level perfor- mance. an essential step in the recovery of salmon populations is to understand how conditions in the estuary inﬂuence survival of migrating salmon which can provide guidance for future restoration activities. in this study, we use 10 years of release and recov- coded-wire-tagged ery data (cwt) fall-run chinook salmon combined with physicochemical data from long-term monitoring pro- grams to evaluate the weight of evidence for alterna- tive hypotheses of the delta conditions that inﬂuence ocean recovery rates. our results indicate that factors previously assumed to strongly inﬂuence salmon migrating through the delta were not well supported by the data and suggest that quantitative evaluation of conceptual models of salmonid ecology in estuar- ies can help direct restoration and conservation actions. for hatchery-origin, methods study site complex network of tidal channels before entering the upper reaches of san francisco bay. flow into the delta is strongly seasonal with peaks from late winter to early spring and low inﬂows during summer and fall (fig. 2). additionally, there is a large amount of interannual variation in the total ﬂow entering the delta (fig. 2). historically, the delta contained vast areas of freshwater tidal wetlands, and inﬂow was driven by precipitation and spring snowmelt. during the late 19th and 20th centuries, the delta experienced an intense period of alteration for agricultural and urban development (yoshiyama et al. 2001). major dams on upstream tributaries now exert considerable con- trol over the timing and volume of ﬂow into the delta (singer 2007). water operations have reduced freshwater ﬂows into the delta during winter and spring when water is impounded in upstream reser- voirs and increased ﬂows during summer and fall when water is released for diversion in the delta (zeug et al. 2011). two large pumping facilities in the south delta divert water year round with up to 60% of total inﬂow diverted in some years (fig 2). wetland habitat has been extensively leveed and drained for farming, navigation and to protect the south delta diversions from salt water intrusion dur- ing periods of low ﬂows into the delta. study population tributaries to the delta support four distinct runs of chinook salmon. however, fall run are currently the most abundant and widely distributed. the fall run supports a commercial ocean ﬁshery as well as popu- lar ocean and inland recreational ﬁsheries. central valley fall run display an ‘ocean type’ life history. adults enter freshwater and spawn during fall and early winter. following incubation in spawning grav- els, juveniles emerge and rear in lotic habitats for weeks to months before entering the delta on their way to the paciﬁc ocean. the majority of juvenile rearing and outmigration occurs between february and may that was historically a period of high inﬂow into the delta. however, ﬂows during this period have been truncated by dam operations upstream (zeug et al. 2011). the delta, located in the california central valley, is a large tidal freshwater estuary that drains a catch- ment of approximately 150,000 km2 (fig. 1). the delta receives water from two major tributaries; the sacramento river that drains the northern portion of the central valley, and the san joaquin river that drains most of the southern portion of the central valley. water entering the delta ﬂows through a release-recovery data juvenile fall-run chinook salmon are raised at ﬁve hatcheries located on tributaries of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers to mitigate for production lost through water development activities. a portion of these juveniles is marked with cwts that are short (0.5–1.0 mm) lengths of steel wire containing a numerical code that is injected into the snout of each 158 california delta salmon recoveries sacramento r. n e v a d a n e v a d a american r. c a l i f o r n i a c a l i f o r n i a north pacific ocean cosumnes r. mokelumne r. sacramento r. san joaquin r. chipps island san joaquin r. export facilities 0 3.25 6.5 13 miles fig. 1. map depicting the location of coded-wire-tagged salmon releases in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers (circles), recovery locations (crosses), locations of ﬂow measurements (squares) and locations where water quality parameters were measured (triangles). ﬁsh. fish receiving a cwt have their adipose ﬁn clipped so they can be visually identiﬁed during sub- sequent sampling. codes identify batches of salmon released at particular locations rather than individual salmon. tagged ﬁsh are released at different delta locations to estimate ocean harvest rates and as part of various studies conducted by state and federal resource agencies. speciﬁc release locations vary among years; however, releases have consistently been made near the limit of tidal inﬂuence at two locations on the main stem sacramento and three locations on the san joaquin in april and may of each year (fig. 1). releases from these locations made in april and may of each year were used to estimate the effect of delta conditions on ocean recovery rates. there are four primary locations where tagged sal- mon can be recovered. first, the united states fish 159 zeug & cavallo (a) 600,000 1 – s * 3 m 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 (b) s t r o p x e %  0 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 3 9 / 1 / 1 4 9 / 1 / 1 5 9 / 1 / 1 6 9 / 1 / 1 7 9 / 1 / 1 8 9 / 1 / 1 9 9 / 1 / 1 0 0 / 1 / 1 1 0 / 1 / 1 2 0 / 1 / 1 3 0 / 1 / 1 date fig. 2. mean daily ﬂow into the delta (panel a) and the daily per- centage of total inﬂow exported (panel b) during the study period (1993–2003). and wildlife service (usfws) operates a mid-water trawl at the exit of the delta (chipps island; fig. 1). the trawl is usually operated for 4–6 weeks during the salmon outmigration period; however, effort has varied within and among years and capture probabil- ity is very low (newman 2008). second, the water export facilities in the south delta conduct salvage operations for ﬁsh entrained into the facilities. fish taken into the facilities are collected live, subsampled and an expansion factor is applied to estimate the total number of ﬁsh that entered the facility. then all ﬁsh (except the subsample) are trucked to the west delta and released. third, tagged ﬁsh are recovered in the commercial and recreational ocean ﬁshery 2–5 years after release. a fraction of ﬁsh brought into ports along the coast by commercial and recreational ﬁsh- erman is subsampled, and an expansion factor is applied to estimate the total catch for each age class in the release group. fourth, tagged ﬁsh are recovered on the spawning grounds during escapement surveys by state and federal resource agencies. recovery information from the export facilities was not used in models because after subsampling to estimate total numbers, the ﬁsh are trucked to the western delta and released. thus, ﬁsh accounted for at the salvage facility could potentially be recaptured in the ocean ﬁshery or on the spawning grounds and ‘double counted’. investigation of the methods used 160 during spawning surveys indicated that the probabil- ity of detecting cwt ﬁsh on the spawning grounds (or collecting a cwt detection) was considerably dif- ferent among rivers and years, making the data unre- liable. thus, inland recoveries were not included in the analysis. the chipps island recovery data have often been used to estimate survival through the delta; however, these data have several issues that restrict their usefulness (newman 2008). the trawl is operated only during daylight hours and recent data suggest that most passage occurs at night (perry 2010). additionally, the number of recoveries at this location is low and the probability of capturing a ﬁsh passing chipps island is low and variable among sample dates and years (newman 2008). recoveries in the ocean ﬁshery are high relative to chipps island, and data are available to estimate the proba- bility of a ﬁsh being captured and the probability of being sampled given that it was captured. thus, we used the ocean recoveries to model the effect of delta conditions. use of the ocean recovery data has the advantage of providing inferences about the inﬂuence of delta conditions at the population level rather than only during the smolt migration period. tag recovery information for the commercial and recreational ocean ﬁshery was obtained from the regional mark information system database (www. rmpc.org) that is maintained by the paciﬁc states marine fisheries commission. rather than using the expansion calculated by the regional mark process- ing center, we used an alternative expansion that accounted for variation in harvest among years and sampling fractions for each age group. recoveries for each release were estimated as: ^r ¼ xn i¼2 ro;i ðsi  itþ where ^r is the estimated number of recoveries for a release group, ro,i is the observed number of recover- ies for age i, si is the fraction of the commercial and recreational catch sampled for ith age class, and it is the sacramento index (si) value for combined recrea- tional and commercial harvest in year t when each age was harvested. the si provides an estimate of central valley fall-run chinook harvest by combin- ing the best estimates of recreational and commercial harvest in the ocean, in river harvest, and escapement to spawning tributaries (o’farrell et al. 2008). several factors that could not be quantiﬁed have the potential to inﬂuence estimates of recovery rate, including changes in chinook salmon maturity sched- ules over the study period, spatial or temporal differ- ences in gear susceptibility, duration of exposure to the ﬁshery, and others. however, there is little infor- mation available to quantify or test for these differ- ences among individual release groups. thus, we assume that these characteristics of the ﬁshery and chinook population were similar among years and did not inﬂuence the recovery rate of cwt ﬁsh dur- ing the study. pyper et al. (2012) found that harvest estimates for sacramento river fall-run chinook were robust to simulated variation in several similar population characteristics over 19 years, suggesting our assumption is reasonable for the time period examined. although recovery information is available for releases going back to the 1970s, we chose to analyse releases starting in 1993. major changes in delta water management began in the mid-1990s following the california state water resources control board ruling d-1641 known as the bay-delta accord. these changes primarily involved restriction of exports during the juvenile salmon outmigration per- iod that reduced the number of salmon encountering the export facilities. the last year of releases analysed was 2003. we chose this year because the ocean ﬁsh- ery was closed in 2008 in response to the collapse of the central valley fall-run stock that prevented col- lection of 4-year-old salmon released in 2004. environmental data salmon experienced as all ﬂow data used in the analyses were averaged for 7 days following each release event to capture the conditions they migrated through the delta. the period of 7 days was chosen based on the mean migration rate of acoustically tagged juvenile chinook salmon through the delta (6.4 days; michel 2010). flow into the delta from the sacramento river was obtained from the califor- nia data exchange center (cdec) gauge at freeport. the cdec gauge at vernalis was used for inﬂow from the san joaquin river, and export ﬂows were obtained from the online data archive, dayflow http://www.water.ca.gov/dayﬂow/ (fig. 1). the propor- tion of ﬁsh in each release group salvaged at the export facilities was obtained from the usfws chipps island survival table (http://www.fws.gov/stockton/jfmp/ docs/data%20management/chipps%20island%20sur vival%20table%201993%20-%202008,%20updated% 20dec.2008.pdf). water temperature was measured by hatchery staff at the location where ﬁsh were released. water quality data were obtained from the interagency ecological program’s environmental monitoring pro- gram (http://www.water.ca.gov/iep/activities/emp. cfm). this program is a consortium of state and federal agencies that coordinate data collection in the san francisco estuary. unlike ﬂow for which daily data are available, water quality parameters were measured at monthly intervals; thus, these parameters could not be calculated as 7-day averages. water quality parameters california delta salmon recoveries + concentration included secchi depth (cm), nh4 (mgl  1), and the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (din/dip; fig. 3). secchi depth was chosen to represent the effect of water clarity on visually oriented salmon predators such as striped bass (morone saxatilis). predation on juvenile salmon would be expected to decrease as secchi depth decreases and visually oriented preda- tors become less efﬁcient (rodriguez & lewis 1997). ammonium ion concentration and din/dip are indi- cators of changes in water quality as a result of wastewater discharge and have been predicted to inﬂuence delta food webs over time (glibert 2010). on the sacramento river, water quality parameters were measured at hood and, on the san joaquin river, they were measured at buckley cove (fig. 1). these sites were chosen because they were the most consistently sampled during the study period. wells’ index was used to represent ocean productivity (fig. 3). this index is a composite of ocean condi- tions that has been signiﬁcantly related to growth and maturity of california chinook salmon in the paciﬁc ocean (wells et al. 2007). wells’ index in the year of ocean entry and the year following ocean entry were both included in the ‘ocean productivity’ hypothesis. data analysis a correlation analysis was performed on all continu- ous predictor variables to identify potential sources of multicollinearity. when the absolute value of a corre- lation coefﬁcient between two variables was  0.70, one of the predictors was arbitrarily excluded in the subsequent modelling exercise. separate correlation analyses were performed for sacramento and san joaquin river releases. a series of generalised linear mixed models (glmm) were constructed a priori to represent hypotheses regarding the factors that affect juvenile salmon during migration through the delta based on previous research. these hypotheses included: ha1 – conditions at the time of release have a strong inﬂu- ence on recovery rate of salmon; hereafter, referred to as ‘release-speciﬁc factors’ (newman & rice 2002). this hypothesis predicts that suboptimal tem- perature at the release site or small ﬁsh size result in higher mortality of the release group. additionally, some release sites may have greater mortality (e.g., they are near predator holding areas). ha2 – ﬂow conditions in the delta during migration have a strong inﬂuence on recovery rate, hereafter referred to as ‘hydrologic factors’ (kjelson & brandes 1989; newman & rice 2002; newman & brandes 2010). this hypothesis predicts that recovery rate will be greatest when inﬂows are high, exports are low and 161 zeug & cavallo mean fork length sacramento san joaquin proportion salvaged sacramento san joaquin m m % 120.0 100.0 80.0 60.0 40.0 20.0 0.0 0.050 0.040 0.030 0.020 0.010

increased mortality of migrat- ing salmon, hereafter referred to as ‘water quality’ (glibert 2010). this hypothesis predicts that changes in the delta food web driven by changes in water quality as described by glibert (2010) have reduced the capacity of the delta to support juvenile salmon resulting in greater mortality through time. ha4 – ocean conditions during ocean residency exert a strong inﬂuence on recovery rate, hereafter referred to as ‘ocean productivity’ (mantua et al. 1997; wells et al. 2007; lindley et al. 2009). this hypothesis pre- dicts that conditions experienced by salmon in the paciﬁc ocean off the california coast will be the strongest inﬂuence on recovery rate. the speciﬁc variables used to represent each alter- native hypothesis are listed in table 1. each glmm utilised a binomial error structure for the response variable (expanded number of ﬁsh recovered and number of ﬁsh released) with a logit link function. we chose to model release-recovery data as a bino- mial distribution (with extra-binomial variation mod- elled as a random effect) rather than transformed proportions for several reasons. first, by calculating a simple proportion, the size of each individual release group and ignores variability in the sampling process that generates the information is lost about 162 response variable. second, warton & hui (2011) found that the analysis of transformed proportions was less powerful and less interpretable for binomial data. third, glmms are effective for modelling lon- gitudinal ﬁsheries data where repeated measurements are taken over time because correlations among observations can be addressed by attributing a ran- dom effect to temporal units (venables & dichmont 2004). in our models, year was included as a ran- dom variable, and an observation-level random vari- able was included to account for over dispersion in the recovery data. all continuous predictor variables were transformed into z-scores so results could be interpreted in units of standard deviation. a total of 15 models were constructed that represented each potential combination of hypotheses. additionally, a model with only an intercept and the random effects was calculated to evaluate how well the ﬁxed effects ﬁt the data. releases from the sacramento and san joaquin rivers were modelled separately. all models were constructed in the statistical program r with the package ‘lme4’ (r development core team 2012). an information theoretic approach was used to select best approximating models for releases in both rivers (burnham & anderson 2002). akaike’s infor- mation criterion corrected for small sample size (aicc) was calculated for each candidate model, and table 1. deﬁnition of variables used to represent hypotheses proposed to explain

approximating model model weights are interpreted as the probability that a given model is the best relative to all candidate models. models with a daicc value of 0–3 were considered competitors to best explain the data. the aicc values of the intercept-only models were com- pared to the full model for each river as a measure of how well the ﬁxed effect models ﬁt the data. to evaluate the level of support in data for each of the variables that composed the hypotheses identiﬁed in the model selection exercise, multi-model averag- ing was performed. this technique provides a way to use all the information contained in the candidate models to calculate model averaged coefﬁcients and unconditional (burnham & anderson 2002). predictor variables were considered to have good support in the data when unconditional conﬁdence intervals did not include zero (burnham & anderson 2002). conﬁdence intervals results a total of 44 releases comprising >1.4 million juve- nile chinook salmon occurred in the sacramento river and 76 releases comprising >2.2 million sal- mon occurred in the san joaquin river over the study period. release sizes in the sacramento river ranged from 16,600 to 55,872 ﬁsh, with a mean and standard deviation of 31,651 ± 12,035. in the san joaquin river, release size varied from a minimum of 15,796 to a maximum of 54,810, with a mean and standard deviation of 29,388 ± 9,647. all releases occurred in the months of april and may. delta conditions  1 and 94–750 m3s a wide range of delta conditions were experienced by emigrating juvenile salmon during the 10-year study period (fig. 3). flow during the releases ran- ged from 215–2466 m3s  1 in the sacramento river and san joaquin river, respec- tively (fig. 2). export volume during the cwt releases ranged from 28 to 240 m3s  1. for releases in the sacramento river, few ﬁsh were collected at the export facilities (116). a larger number of ﬁsh released in the san joaquin river were collected at the export facilities (8620); however, these numbers were relatively small in relation to the numbers released (0.008% and 0.386% in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers, respectively). median fork length of ﬁsh in each release group, temperature at release, and wells’ index values were similar for releases in both rivers. ammonium ion concentration was higher but less variable in the sacramento river. a greater range of secchi depths was observed in the sacra- mento river, whereas din:dip had similar median values although a greater range of values was observed in the san joaquin (fig. 3). model selection and averaging correlation analysis of predictor variables used to model san joaquin releases revealed a strong correla- tion between wells’ index in year 1 and ﬂow (r =  0.86). thus, wells index in year 1 was excluded from the survival models. analysis of pre- dictor variables used to model sacramento releases did not produce any correlations  |0.70|, and the full set of variables was used. 163 zeug & cavallo model selection indicated that the best model to explain recovery rate of salmon released in the sacra- mento river represented the water quality hypotheses aiccw = 0.725 (table 2). no other model had a daicc < 4.025. the difference in aicc values between the intercept-only model and the full model was 8.330 indicating that the model with covariates was a better ﬁt to the data. all predictor variables included in the water qual- releases had ity hypothesis for sacramento river in the data after model averaging good support (table 3). there was a well-supported negative rela- + concentra- tionship between recovery rate and nh4 tion depth. additionally, din:dip had a well-supported positive relationship with ocean recovery rate. recovery rate and and secchi selection of models describing recovery rate of san joaquin salmon releases resulted in two competing models (table 2). the most likely model (aiccw = 0.498) included release-speciﬁc and water quality hypotheses. the next best model (aiccw = 0.377) included release-speciﬁc, water quality and ocean productivity hypotheses. the intercept-only model was a poor ﬁt to the data relative to the full model daic = 17.306. three predictor variables were found to be well supported in the san joaquin river release data fol- lowing model averaging (table 3). for the release- speciﬁc hypothesis, temperature had a negative rela- tionship with ocean recovery rate and mean fork length had a positive relationship. within the water + concentration had a positive quality hypothesis, nh4 relationship with ocean recovery rate. wells’ index had poor support following model averaging. discussion model selection and averaging revealed that the con- ditions that most strongly inﬂuenced ocean recovery rate were dependent on the tributary where ﬁsh were released. temperature and mean fork length were well supported for juvenile salmon released in the san joaquin river. survival of juvenile salmon in the delta has been linked to temperature in several stud- ies that incorporated earlier cwt releases, suggesting that this variable has a strong inﬂuence on migrating chinook (kjelson & brandes 1989; newman & rice 2002; newman 2008). the delta is located at the southern limit of chinook salmon distributions where temperatures can often approach the tolerance of the table 2. results of model selection

upstream reservoir. thus, measure- ments taken at the release site on the sacramento may not be representative of the temperatures salmon experienced when migrating through the delta. popu- lations located at geographical extremes are expected to be sensitive to even small changes in temperature (gustafson et al. 2007), reinforcing the importance of this variable in salmon management. for san joaquin river releases, there also was good support for a positive effect of mean fork length on ocean recovery rate. larger size at release may confer survival advantages such as greater swimming ability and escape from gape-limited predators (wootton 1998). these advantages may be important for san joaquin river origin salmon because they all must pass through the interior delta on their way to the ocean. the interior delta is a region of the estu- ary that has been identiﬁed as supporting high densi- ties of non-native piscivores such as striped bass and black bass (micropterus spp.) (brown & michniuk 2007; nobriga & feyrer 2007). only a small propor- tion of sacramento river origin ﬁsh migrate through this route (perry et al. 2010) and fork length was not a well-supported variable for releases in this river. sacramento river releases were strongly inﬂuenced by water quality parameters. glibert (2010) reported negative relationships between the abundance of cer- + concentration, and tain native delta ﬁshes, nh4 din:dip and suggested these relationships were mediated by changes in food web structure. changes in delta food webs have been well documented, yet the effect of these changes on ﬁshes has largely focused on non-salmonid species (bennet et al. 1995; feyrer et al. 2003; nobriga and feyrer 2008). little is known about the diets of juvenile salmon in the delta or how they may have changed over time. however, macfarlane (2010) found that juvenile sal- mon migrating through the delta and san francisco bay experienced little or no growth that may indicate poor food web support. nobriga & feyrer (2008) suggested that food web changes in the delta may exceed the trophic adaptability of juvenile striped bass and the same may be true of juvenile chinook. additional studies of diet and growth of juveniles in the delta would be needed to conﬁrm the indirect pattern observed in this study. the water quality hypothesis was included in a competing model for san joaquin river releases, yet + concentra- only one variable had good support (nh4 tion), and the relationship was opposite of expecta- tions (positive). glibert (2010) reported lower and + concentrations in the san joaquin less variable nh4 that may have produced this result. nutrient concen- trations in the sacramento river are strongly inﬂu- enced by a municipal wastewater plant and ﬂows from the sacramento dominate delta inﬂow. the hydrologic hypothesis was not included in competing models for releases in either river. other studies of juvenile salmon survival also have pro- duced equivocal relationships with ﬂow (smith et al. 2002; zabel et al. 2008; michel 2010). a potential explanation for this result is the relative inﬂuence of tidal ﬂux over river inﬂow during migration through the delta. in a large portion of the delta, daily tidal ﬂux represents a greater movement of water than river inﬂow (cavallo et al. 2012). juvenile salmon may respond more strongly to ﬂow near or upstream of release locations where ﬂow is unidirectional but less so in downstream portions of the delta dominated by tidal ﬂux. miller & sadro (2003) found that the movement of juvenile coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch) smolts followed tidal movements in an oregon estuary. the use of ocean recovery data also may have inﬂuenced the lack of a detectable ﬂow effect. tagged ﬁsh recovered in the ocean have been exposed to both 165 zeug & cavallo delta and ocean mortality prior to capture. ocean recoveries provide a measure of population-level effects of delta conditions and the effect of ﬂow during delta migration may be small relative to other mortality sources. indeed, there is an increasing recognition that mortality during ocean residency can be a strong driver of salmon population trends (mantua et al. 1997; bro- deur et al. 2000; greene et al. 2005). previous salmon studies in the delta found a signiﬁ- cant effect of ﬂow on survival (kjelson & brandes 1989; brandes & mclain 2001). the data set used here includes the years after water operations in the delta changed in response to legislation to protect native ﬁshes, whereas previous analyses used data prior to these management actions to establish a relationship with ﬂow. thus, although releases were made over a wide range of ﬂows in the current study, changes in operations may have reduced the previously observed effect. michel (2010) did not ﬁnd an effect of ﬂow on survival of acoustically tagged salmon released in the sacramento from 2007 to 2009. the information theoretic approach used here allowed us to compare the relative weight of evidence for different hypotheses rather than looking for statistical signiﬁcance of bivari- ate relationships (burnham & anderson 2002). thus, although ﬂow may be important, it may be less impor- tant than the other variables examined. water exports from the delta are actively managed to protect salmon migrating through the delta. how- ever, we did not ﬁnd a well-supported effect of exports on ocean recovery rate for releases in either river. other investigations of export effects on sur- vival of sacramento origin salmon also have failed to ﬁnd strong evidence for the hypothesised negative relationship (kjelson & brandes 1989; newman & rice 2002; newman & brandes 2010). a multi-year study of san joaquin river releases also did not yield a signiﬁcant export effect (newman 2008). our anal- ysis took a unique approach by evaluating export effects using both the number of juvenile salmon that actually encountered export facilities (the proportion of each release group salvaged), and by the more indirect measure (recovery rate in relation to exports) used in previous analyses but still failed to detect a well-supported effect. although model selection and averaging provided strong evidence for certain hypotheses, several factors should be considered when interpreting results. first, the information theoretic approach only evaluates the weight of evidence for the hypotheses presented. there could be other hypotheses not presented here that could explain the data better. for example, the delta supports populations of non-native piscivores that could potentially impact salmon survival (brown & michniuk 2007; nobriga & feyrer 2007). direct measures of a predation effect or even indicators of 166 an effect could not be quantiﬁed here but future eval- uations may reveal that predation is an important component of salmon survival. the advantage of information theoretic methods is that new hypotheses can be directly evaluated against those presented here if more data become available (hobbs & hilborn 2006). the response variable in our analysis was a joint survival and capture probability (recovery rate). we assumed that capture probability is similar among releases to facilitate modelling; however, results could change if this assumption is incorrect. technologies such as acoustic tags that allow direct estimation of capture probabilities are increasingly used in the delta but survival estimates over long time periods are not yet available. finally, all salmon released in this study were hatchery origin and it is unknown how well the behaviour of hatchery ﬁsh matches that of wild ﬁsh in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers. estuaries are increasingly recognised as critical habitats for salmon as they transition from freshwater to marine habitats and restoration actions in these areas is likely to increase in the future. this study suggests that assumed relationships and conceptual models should be quantitatively evaluated before implementing management actions. our evaluation of the relationship between estuarine conditions and ocean recovery rate revealed that there was no clear hypothesis that best explained patterns of recovery rates. however, we found that the factors previously hypothesised to be important (ﬂow, exports) were less important than others (temperature, ﬁsh size, water quality) when models were pitted against each other. many of the relationships described here are indicators of particular effects (food web changes, size-mediated survival) and direct evidence of causal relationships would help reduce uncertainty in future management of the delta. acknowledgements we thank kris jones for providing assistance with statistical models and
