morph 1 was characterised as a generalist, morph 3 was more benthic-oriented, and morphs 2 and 4 were mainly pelagic feeders. of the latter, morph 4 was the most specialised, whereas morph 2 exhibited alternative feeding tactics of benthic cannibalistic and pelagic piscivorous feeding. our findings demonstrate that complementary dietary methods can elucidate habits of opportunistic feeders, a task that can often be problematic, given their complex and variable diets. our results add new information and perspectives on the current model of lake_trout differentiation, demonstrating niche partitioning based on benthic versus pelagic habitat use and generalist versus specialist feeding tactics. key words: arctic ecology; great bear lake; lake_trout; polymorphism; fatty acids; stomach content introduction resource polymorphism, the occurrence of discrete intraspecific morphs differing in their niches (espe- cially feeding or habitat use), is a product of ecologi- cal adaptations associated with divergent selection (smith & skulason 1996). sympatric resource poly- morphism can arise rapidly, especially in novel envi- ronments such as newly formed lakes or remote islands, where many of the most striking examples have been documented. examples among fishes include arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus), whitefishes (coregonus spp.) and threespine stickleback (gast- erosteus aculeatus) (schluter & rambaut 1996; jons- son & jonsson 2001; mckinnon & rundle 2002; kahilainen et al. 2007). as a consequence of its glacial history, the canadian freshwater fish fauna has a number of interesting examples of ecological and evolutionary characteristics resulting from geo- logically recent or on-going events, thus providing opportunities to study processes linked to resource polymorphism (schluter 2000; guiguer et al. 2002; ruzzante et al. 2003). investigating the relationship between morphologi- cal variation and diet is broadly accepted as an important feature for understanding the origin and maintenance of lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush) phenotypic diversity (zimmerman et al. 2006, 2007, 2009; stafford et al. 2014). conventional dietary methods include stomach content analysis (sca), which provides a ‘snapshot’ of the diet. however, sca is known to have limitations and biases, correspondence: louise chavarie, university of alberta, cw 405 biological science building, edmonton, ab t6g 2e9, canada. e-mail: chavarie@ualberta.ca doi: 10.1111/eff.12195 109 chavarie et al. including regurgitation during capture, variable rates of digestion of food items, identification of partly digested material, underestimation of prey size and lack of temporal representation (phillips et al. 2001; krahn et al. 2007; vinson & budy 2011). as a result, sca should not be used alone to characterise diet (kear, 1992) and should be complemented with an alternative method (beaudoin et al. 1999). complementary methods to sca, such as molecu- lar biomarkers, have more recently been developed to elucidate dietary composition and trophic links of organisms over longer time periods (iverson et al. 1997; budge et al. 2002; bradshaw et al. 2003). fatty acids (fa) are one set of dietary biomarkers, representing a large group of molecules that comprise the majority of lipids found in all organisms (budge et al. 2006). the principle behind fa analysis is that consumers derive their lipids either from their diet or by endogenous lipogenesis from dietary protein or carbohydrate precursors (howell et al. 2003). how- ever, a relatively limited number of fa can be bio- synthesised by animals, facilitating the distinction between dietary versus nondietary fa (cook 1991; iverson et al. 2004). thus, fa analysis assumes that dietary lipids are broken down into their constituent fa and incorporated relatively unchanged into the consumer tissues (howell et al. 2003; iverson et al. 2004). both qualitative and quantitative fa analyses have been used to compare diet composition between organisms, and examine their spatial and temporal variations (iverson 2009). fa analysis is commonly used in studies of top predators, such as marine mam- mals, bears and seabirds (budge et al. 2006), but is increasingly receiving attention in freshwater ecosys- tems (ahlgren et al. 2009; iverson 2009; eloranta et al. 2013). morphology can also reflect diet of an organism; for example, gill rakers are commonly used to infer foraging behaviour in fishes (kahilainen et al. 2011). the gill raker apparatus plays a role in prey retention efficiency, with the gill rakers functioning as a cross- flow filter (sanderson et al. 2001; smith & sander- son 2008). longer and more gill rakers enhance cross-flow filtering and improve retention of small prey, whereas shorter and fewer gill rakers are linked with larger prey and/or benthic habitat (wright et al. 1983; kahilainen et al. 2007). characteristics such as these that can be linked with phenotype–environment associations can be valuable tools for determining feeding habits of different morphotypes. this study was undertaken to advance our under- standing of the mechanisms for the extensive lake_trout morphological variation found previously at great bear lake (blackie et al. 2003; alfonso 2004; chavarie et al. 2013; chavarie et al., accepted, jour- nal of biological linnean society, bjls-3437). 110 despite some evidence of both piscivory and insecti- vory (blackie et al. 2003; alfonso, 2004; chavarie et al. 2013), the nature of the ecological processes driving this phenotypic diversity remains unknown. our main objective is to compare diet composition among lake_trout morphotypes by evaluating short- term diet composition from sca in combination with longer-term patterns from fa analysis. we also examine gill raker structure among lake_trout mor- photypes as an indicator of diet differences (e.g. amundsen et al. 2004; vila-gispert et al. 2007). this study should advance our understanding of the niche relationships among lake_trout morphotypes by assessing the link between morphological and ecolog- ical variation within a species. materials and methods entirely within canada; 0 w120° 35 its study system 0 great bear lake (n66° 06 ) is the largest surface area lake (31,790 km2) is divided into five semi-isolated ‘arms’. maximum depth is 446 m, although mean depth is ca. 90 m (macdonald et al. 2004). four dis- tinct morphotypes coexist in the shallow-water zone (≤30 m) of the lake (chavarie et al. 2013). morph 1 was characterised by a smaller head and intermediate fins, morph 2 had the largest head and jaws but smallest fins, morph 3 had the longest fins and a robust body shape, whereas morph 4 had a thick curved lower jaw and the smallest caudal peduncle (chavarie et al. 2013, chavarie et al., accepted, jour- nal of biological linnean society, bjls-3437). an level of morphological differentiation additional within some of these morphs was demonstrated among the five arms of great bear lake, mainly in relation to body shape (chavarie et al., accepted, journal of biological linnean society, bjls-3437). field sampling for this study, fish were caught inshore in waters with depths ≤30 m using paired bottom sets (ca. 24 h) of a 14-cm and a multimesh (3.8–14 cm) gill net during july and august. sampling occurred in all five arms over multiple years: dease (2005 and 2010), mcvicar (2003 and 2008), keith (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2010), mctavish (2009) and smith (2006). data collected on captured lake_trout included fork length, weight, sex and stage of matu- rity, which was divided into juvenile, mature and resting categories (see chavarie et al. 2013). for each fish captured, a piece of dorsal muscle, the first left gill arch and the stomach (if it was not empty) were removed and frozen. trophic patterns among lake_trout morphotypes in great bear lake stomach content analysis in the laboratory, stomachs were opened (n = 42, 32, 16 and 2 for morphs 1–4 respectively) and con- tents were sorted by prey type and weighed. morph 4 is a rarer morph; combined with a high rate of empty stomachs (n = 20), only two stomachs were exam- ined. depending on the degree of digestion of prey items, identification ranged from species to family for both fishes and invertebrates. to facilitate data presentation, prey were pooled into the following groups: (1) fish, (2) malacostraca, (3) mollusca, (4) orthoptera, (5) lepidoptera, (6) aranea, (7) diptera, (8) hemiptera, (9) hymenoptera, (10) trichoptera, (11) coleoptera, (12) plecoptera and (13) unknown invertebrates. prey were also categorised as inverte- brate or fish, and by prey habitat (terrestrial, benthic, pelagic, littoral and surface), based on scott & cross- man (1973), triplehorn & johnson (2005) and mer- ritt et al. (2008). diet composition was summarised by morphotype using frequency of occurrence (%o), and percentage by abundance (%n) and mass (%m). to scale the importance of each prey category among morphotypes, %o, %n and %m were used to calcu- late the relative importance index (ri) at both the morphotype and individual level; for the latter, %o was excluded (george & hadley 1979). by averaging diet proportions using our data on prey mass, individual specialisa- tion was estimated across all individuals, but also within a morphotype, using dieta and indspec1 programs produced by dr. bolnick (http://web.biosci. utexas.edu/bolnick_lab/), calculating e (mean pair- wise diet dissimilarity between individuals) and wic/ tnw [(within-individual component)/(total niche width)] indexes (bolnick et al., 2007; bolnick et al. 2010). wic/tnw is the ratio of the average individ- ual niche width to the population niche width, and ranges from zero (strong specialisation) to one (gen- eralisation) (bolnick et al. 2002). we calculated mor- photype across individuals to obtain a measure of electivity (the pro- portion of decision making events that resulted in capturing resource type j) (bolnick et al. 2002). to ensure that wic/tnw was not sensitive to the partic- ular measure of individual specialisation, we also cal- culated a second index, e, the mean pairwise diet dissimilarity between individuals, where a value of zero implies an absence of interindividual niche vari- ation, increasing towards one with an increase in in- terindividual variation (araujo et al. 2008; bolnick et al. 2010). finally, to compare overall diet overlap among morphotypes, we calculated schoener’s pro- portional similarity, an index ranging from zero to one, for each pair of morphotypes; values higher than 0.6 represent significant biological diet overlap (schoener 1970; wallace, 1981). fatty acids analysis initially, overall, fa analysis procedures, using 41 fatty acids (appendix 1), followed the methods of iverson et al. (2004) and budge et al. (2006). muscle samples were taken from individuals sampled for sca and from supplementary lake_trout identified by chavarie et al. (2013) to morphotypes (morph 1 = 32, morph 2 = 35, morph 3 = 38, morph 4 = 21 and juve- nile = 13). individuals were selected for both fa and sca analyses, but due to high rate of empty stomachs, it was not possible to match all samples for both analyses. therefore, only 58 indi- viduals across the four morphotypes were sampled for both sca and fa analyses. dorsal muscle sam- ples were stored at  20 °c (budge et al. 2006, 2011; loseto et al. 2008, 2009; kavanagh et al. 2010). subsequently, muscle samples and prey items collected from stomachs and from gillnet bycatch (fish only) were freeze-dried and then homogenised with a mortar and pestle. smaller fish and inverte- brates were homogenised whole to give the best rep- resentation of their fa signatures. lipids were extracted from 1 g of the homogenate material pas- sively overnight (at  20 °c) using 2:1 chloroform– methanol containing 0.01% bht (v/v/w) (folch et al. 1957). samples were then filtered through whatman grade 1 qualitative filter paper, and the fil- ter paper/sample was rinsed twice with 2 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol. sample extract was collected in a test tube and 7 ml 0.88 n nacl solution was added as nacl encourages fa to move into the organic (chloroform) layer. the aqueous layer was then dis- carded, after which the chloroform was dried with sodium sulphate prior to total lipid determination. the extracted lipid was used to prepare the fatty acid methyl esters (fame) by transesterification with hil- ditch reagent (0.5 n h2so4 in methanol) (morrison & smith 1964). samples were heated for 1 h at 100 °c. gas chromatographic (gc) analysis was per- formed on an agilent technologies, santa clara, ca, usa 7890n gc equipped with a 30-m j&w db-23 column (0.25 mm i.d; 0.15 lm film thickness). the gc was coupled to a flame ionisation detector oper- ating at 350 °c. hydrogen was used as carrier gas flowing at 1.25 mlmin  1 for 14 min and increased to 2.5 mlmin  1 for 5 min. the split/splitless injector was heated to 260 °c and run in splitless mode. the oven program was as follows: 60 °c for 0.66 min, increasing by 22.82 °cmin  1 to 165 °c with a 1.97- min hold; increasing by 4.56 °cmin  1 to 174 °c and by 7.61 °cmin  1 to 200 °c with a 6-min hold. peak areas were quantified using agilent technologies chemstation software. fa standards were obtained from supelco (37 component fame mix) and nuchek (54 component mix glc-463). seventy-three fame 111 chavarie et al. identified via were and known standard mixtures and are reported as percentage of total fa. retention time all fa values were converted to a mass percentage of the total array and were named according the iupac nomenclature as x:y n-z, where x is the number of carbon atoms in the fa, y is the number of methylene-interrupted double bonds in the chain and n z denotes the position of the last double bond relative to the methyl terminus (ronconi et al. 2010). fa suggested by iverson et al. (2004) as important dietary fa, that transfer from prey to predator, were used in our analyses. fa profiles were log-trans- formed to obtain normality and were explored with pc-ord version 6 (mccune & mefford 2011) using a principal component analysis (pca) to provide inferences about patterns of habitat use (aquatic vs. terrestrial and benthic vs. pelagic habitats based on fa literature and prey ecology) and feeding ecology among the four lake_trout morphotypes. discrimi- nant analyses and a jackknife validation procedure were also performed with systat v. 12 (systat software inc., chicago, il, usa) on the fa signa- tures among the four morphotypes to determine whether their fa profiles differed. gill and arches gill morphology gill rakers were measured (0.01 mm) with an ocular micrometer at 649 mag- nification, and gill rakers were counted. we measured and then averaged the longest and shortest gill rakers from the upper and lower gill arch, along with one gill raker from the middle of the arch, defined as the con- fluence of the ceratobranchial and epibranchial bones (bodaly 1979). gill rakers were measured from the centre of the base, at the point of emergence from the gill arch, to the tip of the raker. the three measure- ment locations were highly correlated, and thus, all measurements were averaged for each fish. a multi- variate analysis of variance (manova) was performed with spss, chicago, il, usa v. 21 on gill raker count and length and arch length among morpho- types, with length of fish as a covariate, followed by a lsd post hoc comparison with bonferroni correction. results lake_trout diets in great bear lake comprised a variety of prey, both within and among morphotypes (see appendix 2 for proportions and scientific names for taxa). overall, lake_trout, round white- fish, burbot and slimy sculpin were the most com- mon fish prey (>10% by abundance and/or mass), whereas the most common invertebrate prey were mysidae, gammaridae, formicidae, hymenoptera 112 terrestrial and trichoptera (appendix 2). interestingly, diets of all morphs included a large proportion and diverse array of invertebrates, varying between 28% and 50% of their diet (fig. 1). strong individ- ual specialisation was found overall and within mor- photypes, with relatively low wic/tnw values (between 0.34 and 0.57) and relatively high e values (between 0.68 and 0.99) (table 1). however, most schoener overlap indices were higher than 0.7, indi- cating substantial diet overlap among morphotypes, except for those involving morph 4, where values were lower (0.39–0.61) (table 2). the first two axes of the fa pca explained 48.6% of the variation among the diets of the four adult morphs and juveniles. the first axis separated pelagic versus benthic diets, based on fas that have been previously associated with those two habitats (dalsg- aard et al. 2003; budge et al. 2006; tucker et al. 2008; iverson 2009) (fig. 2). individuals of morph 4 were clustered together and positioned as pelagic, whereas those of morph 2 appeared to be divided into two groups (pelagic and benthic). benthic indi- viduals from morph 2 overlapped with juveniles and a few individuals of morphs 1 and 3. pelagic lake_trout (morphs 2 in part and 4) contained higher con- centrations of the fas 14:0, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:4n- 3, 18:1n-9, 20:1n-7 and 22:1n-9, whereas morph 2 (benthic) and juveniles had higher concentrations of 16:0, 18:0, 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 (fig. 2). many indi- viduals of morphs 1 and 3 were more dispersed, but revealed a general pattern driven by 16:1n-7, 16:2n- 4, 16:3n-4, 18:1n7, 18:2n4, 18:3n6 and 22:1n7. morph 2 (benthic and pelagic) was also categorised by fa 22:5n-6, which was positioned to the lower part of the pca (fig. 2). the first two axis of a second fa pca, using the four adult morphs, juvenile trout and potential trout prey, explained 37.6% of the variation (fig. 3). fa signatures positioned lake_trout and prey on the x-axis along a gradient associated with aquatic versus terrestrial habitats (dalsgaard et al. 2003; gladyshev et al. 2009). there was also some separation between pelagic and benthic habitats along the y-axis, as lake_trout individuals that were identified in fig. 2 as benthic were higher on the y-axis relative to the pela- gic lake_trout. cisco (adults and juveniles) and northern pike overlapped with lake_trout fa signa- tures, while arctic grayling, lake whitefish and mysis partially overlapped with lake_trout. terres- trial invertebrates had generally higher concentrations of 18:2n-6, 18:3n-1 and 18:3n-3, whereas aquatic organisms, fish in particular, had higher concentra- tions of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 (fig. 3). discriminant analysis of the fa data showed sig- nificant differences among adult morphs and juve- niles (ƛ = 0.05, p < 0.01), especially for morphs 2 trophic patterns among lake_trout morphotypes in great bear lake (a) f inv b b & p as terr (b) (c) 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 f inv b b & p as terr 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 e c n a t r o p m i e v i t a l e r (d) 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 f inv b b & p as inv b b & p as terr terr f prey categories fig. 1. relative importance (%) of prey categories in stomachs of lake_trout from great bear lake for morph 1 (a), morph 2 (b), morph 3 (c) and morph 4 (d). prey are classified as fish (f) or invertebrates (inv) (solid bars), and as habitat categories (striped bars): benthic (b), benthic and pelagic (organisms that have vertical migration, e.g. mysis) (b & p), aquatic surface (as) and terrestrial (terr). see appendix 2 for identity and habitat categories of individual taxa. and 4, whereas morphs 1, 3 and juveniles overlapped (fig. 4). jackknife classification success was the highest for morph 4 (86%), while morphs 1, 2, 3 and juveniles had success rates of 56, 57, 55 and 61% respectively. finally, gill raker length differed among morpho- types (p < 0.01) (fig. 5), but no differences were observed in total counts of gill rakers (p = 0.36) or gill arch length (p = 0.17). morph 3 had significantly longer gill rakers than morphs 2 and 4 (p ≤ 0.05), while morph 1 was intermediate (and significantly longer than morph 2; p = 0.02). length of fish, as a covariate, was significant only for gill arch length (p < 0.01). discussion our study demonstrated significant differences in prey exploitation among the four lake_trout morpho- types inhabiting the inshore, shallow-water zone of great bear lake, based on a combination of fa analysis and sca. differences in gill raker length also suggested that some feeding specialisation has evolved (kahilainen et al. 2007). however, our inte- grative analyses also revealed overlaps in habitat use and prey items among the lake_trout morphotypes. while lake_trout has the reputation of being a vora- cious predator, it is also recognised as being an oppor- tunistic feeders and like many aquatic consumers, 113 chavarie et al. ranging to table 1. ratio of the average individual niche width to the population niche width (within-individual component/total niche width) based on stomach contents, one (generalisation), and mean pairwise diet dissimilarity between individuals indices (e), ranging from zero (absence of interindividual niche difference) to one (complete interindividual variation), for the four shallow-water morphotypes of lake_trout from great bear lake. specialisation) from zero (individual overall morph 1 morph 2 morph 3 morph 4 wic/tnw e 0.49 0.73 0.45 0.71 0.34 0.68 0.42 0.69 0.57 0.99 table 2. schoener’s index of niche overlap for the four shallow-water morphotypes of lake_trout from great bear lake, based on the relative importance of prey taxa in their diet (stomach contents). morph 1 morph 2 morph 3 morph 2 morph 3 morph 4 0.72 0.89 0.61 0.73 0.39 0.56 values higher than 0.6 represent biologically significant diet overlap (scho- ener 1968;

(2007, 2009) one unexpected finding of this study was the dietary importance of terrestrial insects, which con- tributed close to half of the stomach contents of each morph. in smaller lakes, lake_trout are con- ventionally thought to feed predominately on fish, with some invertebrates contributing to the diet in the spring and summer (martin 1952; jude et al. 1987). in many instances when invertebrates are found in the diet, they are usually aquatic (martin 1970; madenjian et al. 1998; roseman et al. 2009). however, zimmerman et al. found that in mistassini and great slave lakes, two other large and deep northern lakes, insects contributed considerably to the diets of both deep- and shallow-water morphs. several large individuals of the shallow-water morph, a piscivorous form, appeared to have specialised on terrestrial insects in great slave lake (zimmerman et al. 2009). similar to our study, zimmerman et al. (2007,2009) found terrestrial coleoptera, diptera and hymenoptera, but abundances were lower. our results, together with zimmerman et al. in northern aquatic systems, lake_trout use temporal pulses of food, such as those provided by flying insects (martin 1952).

(amundsen et al. 1996; smith et al. 2011). the high overlap in diet observed among most lake_trout morphotypes from great bear lake suggests that they are somewhat similarly taking opportunistic advantage of short but substantial pulses of prey. using a broad resource spectrum may be an adaptive strategy of fishes living in environments where food availability is pulsed and unpredictable (dill 1983; smith et al. 2011) and 116 niche expansion has been commonly observed in depauperate environments with few competitors, such as postglacial lakes (bolnick et al. 2010). variation in resource use among individuals (high values of e) might be the result of environmental differences in resource availability across time and space (bolnick et al. 2003; pire et al. 2011), which is supported by diet differences among the different arms of great bear lake (chavarie et al., accepted, journal of biological linnean society, bjls-3437). resource standard sympatric nonetheless, pca and discriminant analysis on fa profiles confirmed the persistence of diet overlap between morphs 1 and 3. this seems to differ from the polymorphism model, where a subset of individuals within a popula- tion switches to a novel and/or suboptimal resource, reducing intraspecific competition (olsson et al. 2006; moles et al. 2010). the nature of the diversifi- cation between morphs 1 and 3 remains unclear, but is not necessarily associated with clear diet differentiation. although there was overlap among the fa signa- tures, a high proportion of morph 3 fa profiles were driven by 16:1n7 and 18:1n7, known to be diatom bi- omarkers and to be found in high concentrations in benthic invertebrates and/or fish (virtue et al. 2000; budge et al. 2002; alfaro et al. 2006; stowasser et al. 2009; tucker et al. 2008; mariash et al. 2011). indeed, mysis, gastropod, and amphipod fa profiles were driven by 16:1n7 and 18:1n7 and sca sup- ported the importance of mysis in the morph 3 diet. the high relative mass of slimy sculpin in the stomach contents of morph 3 further indicated its benthic niche, although its long gill rakers is not a typical characteristic of benthic exploitation (amund- sen et al. 2004; kahilainen et al. 2007). in contrast, morph 1’s more dispersed fa signatures, combined with intermediate gill rakers, suggested a more gener- alised diet. thus, differences in habitat use, rather than specific prey types, might be part of the selec- tive pressures operating on lake_trout diversity in great bear lake. although discrimination of morph 4 based on mor- phology was not as apparent (chavarie et al. 2013), this morph was clearly distinct with respect to its long-term diet. fa analysis indicated diet specialisa- tion for morph 4, with a single distinctive cluster of fa signatures among individuals. similarly, morph 2 individuals showed some distinction in their fa pro- files, but were divided into two clusters, one of which was slightly overlapping with morph 4. the overlap- ping morph 2 and morph 4 individuals were charac- terised by c20 and c22 monounsaturates that can be used as biomarkers of food webs based on pelagic copepods (stowasser et al. 2006; ahlgren et al. 2009; loseto et al. 2009). specifically, 20:1n-9 and trophic patterns among lake_trout morphotypes in great bear lake 22:5n-6 are well-known indicators of diets based on calanoid copepods, which are particularly important in northern pelagic food webs (kattner et al. 1998; budge et al. 2006; ahlgren et al. 2009; loseto et al. 2009). interestingly, both morph 2 and morph 4 were characterised by shorter gill rakers, an indicator of feeding on larger prey (wright et al. 1983; kahilai- nen et al. 2007). these shorter gill rakers suggest that, rather than pelagic copepods per se, it is the pelagic, zooplanktivorous cisco (howland et al., 2013) that to both predator morphs, which is supported by their overlapping fa signa- tures with cisco. the fa signature of mysis was also overlapping with morph 4, suggesting the importance of mysis to its diet, which was supported by sca (although sample size was limited). is important overall, the integrated results of our study suggest that polymorphism in the lake_trout of great bear lake is maintained not only by diet differences, but also by shallow-water habitat partitioning. morph 1 appears to be the most generalised of the four mor- photypes, morph 3 is mainly benthic, while morph 4 is pelagic. morph 2 exhibited alternative feeding tac- tics of benthic cannibalism and pelagic piscivory; because only adults were examined, this dichotomy should be independent of an ontogenic shift. our results offer new perspectives on the current model of depth as the major driver of lake_trout differenti- ation (eshenroder 2008). we add a new layer of information in the context of shallow-water habitat exploitation and demonstrate the role of benthic ver- sus pelagic habitat segregation. however, the overlap and seasonality found among diets of different mor- phs bring into question the degrees to which diet and habitat partitioning are involved as drivers of diver- gent selection. thus, future studies will be necessary to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that form the basis of and maintain shallow-water lake_trout polymorphism in great bear lake. acknowledgements we thank deline

north- 117 (budge environments individuals of morph 2 that did not exhibit pelagic fa signatures overlapped with juvenile lake_trout and some morph 1 individuals, with fas associated with benthic et al. 2002; k€akel€a et al. 2005). these fish had high concentra- tions of 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3, found in diatoms and dinoflagellates respectively. the former reflects a benthic feeding mode through benthic invertebrates to fish (stowasser et al. 2006; tucker et al. 2008). the latter fa has been reported in pennate diatoms (iverson 2009) and in filter feeders, linking plank- tonic dinoflagellates to benthic filter-feeding bivalves (virtue et al. 2000; alfaro et al. 2006). the overlap between these more benthic morph 2 individuals, juveniles and some morph 1 individuals suggests a significant trophic interaction, most likely cannibalis- tic, as stomach contents showed lake_trout to be the most important fish prey for morph 2. cannibalism is also supported by relatively high concentrations of fas 16:0, 18:0 and 22:6n-3 and low concentrations of 16:1n-7 and 20:5n-3 (dalsgaard et al. 2003; iver- son et al. 2004; piche et al. 2010). overall, it appears that the piscivorous morph 2 of lake_trout in great bear lake has alternative feeding tactics, showing either a cannibalistic pattern in benthic habitats or preying on fishes, mainly cisco, in pelagic environ- ments. our study demonstrates the benefits of combining dietary methods (fa and sca) to clarify trophic hab- its of an opportunistic feeder, a task that can be prob- lematic due to complex and variable diets. the ‘snapshot’ of stomach contents and the longer time frame of fa allowed us to both capture the seasonali- ty in lake_trout diets and validate the importance of cannibalism in a subset of the piscivorous trout. important inputs to each morph demon- strated a link between terrestrial and aquatic systems in the arctic, suggesting that northern lake_trout can specialise in and/or respond rapidly to short tem- poral pulses in potential prey. terrestrial chavarie et al. west territories, canada. environmental biology of fishes 71: 21–32. amundsen, p.-a., gabler, h.-m. & staldvik, f.j.
