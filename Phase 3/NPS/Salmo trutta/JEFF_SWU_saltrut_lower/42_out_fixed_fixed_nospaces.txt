environment canada interdepartmental recovery fund abstract small- bodied freshwater fishes are often understudied, with the result that data gaps create uncertainties that can complicate and constrain conservation strategies aimed at species recovery. use of matrix models and perturbation population viability analy- ses (pva) are ideally suited for use in studying the consequences of life- history param- eter variation and environmental stochasticity to better understand the fate of threatened small- bodied fishes. we use data for eastern sand darter (ammocrypta pellucida) populations from the thames river, canada, to explore the consequences of life- history uncertainties such as age at maturation, multiple clutch sizes and age- specific fertility for population recovery in this species. environmental stochasticity acting on all life- history parameters was found to pose significant risks for the contin- ued viability of lower thames river populations, with significant chances of local ex- tinction predicted under current conditions. the intrinsic rate of population increase was most sensitive to 0+ survival rates, clutch size and clutch number. as demon- strated here, population models can successfully provide a means of exploring the population dynamics of small- bodied fishes and can inform managers of risks posed by factors acting on life- history parameters to affect continued population viability. management actions for eastern sand darter should focus on strategies designed to ensure successful spawning and improvement of 0+ survival rates, through pro- grammes aimed at the protection, enhancement or recovery of additional spawning and juvenile rearing habitats. k e y w o r d s endangered species, darters, population modelling, vital rates 1 |  introduction freshwater species are often threatened more by indirect anthropo- genic effects, such as habitat alteration, invasive species or pollution, than by direct effects, such as exploitation or incidental mortality (dextrase & mandrak, 2006; venter et al., 2006). the result is that freshwater fishes at risk are often smaller- bodied species (olden, hogan, & vander zanden, 2007; reynolds, webb, & hawkins, 2005) due to their greater sensitivity to habitat perturbations (van der lee & koops, 2016). small- bodied fishes can also play important roles in food web regimes, determining ecosystem properties and supporting other fisheries species (e.g. gido & matthews, 2001; pikitch et al., 2012; power, 2006; stewart, 1987). unfortunately, small- bodied fishes in freshwater ecosystems are often understudied, leading to significant data gaps and uncertainties that can constrain management decisions aimed at recovering these species and biodiversity. matrix population modelling is a common and useful tool to inform the conservation and management of endangered species (akcakaya 378  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:378–388. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdfinch et al. et al., 2004; beissinger & westphal, 1998; burgman, ferson, & akcakaya, 1993; crouse, crowder, & caswell, 1987; di minn & griffiths, 2010; reed et al., 2002). matrix models use age- or stage- specific information on fertility and survival, usually derived from life- tables or cross- sectional surveys of the population of interest, to determine population growth rate, future abundance and population structure (caswell, 2001; leslie, 1945). matrix models and the analy- ses of the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be incorporated into pva and used to estimate future population viability, determine limiting life stages and infer how differences in population vital rates may affect population growth rate (beissinger & westphal, 1998; de kroon, van groenendael, & ehrelen, 2000; morris, bloch, hudgens, moyle, & stinchcombe, 2002; morris & doak, 2002). knowledge of environmental and demographic stochasticity can increase pva real- ism by accounting for uncertainty in population trajectories (caswell, 2001; fieberg & ellner, 2001; morris & doak, 2002). additionally, perturbation pva can be used to better understand the implications of potential management and recovery plans by changing vital rates to simulate a proposed plan and then examine resulting population outcomes (caswell, 2000; ehrlén & van groenendael, 1998; heppell, caswell, & crowder, 2000). the ability of pva to incorporate uncertainty into quantitative models makes the approach useful for studying endangered species, especially when biological information (i.e. fertility and survival rates) is limited and collection of additional information is constrained by lo- gistical difficulties and the necessity of using nonlethal sampling tech- niques (akcakaya et al., 2004; caswell, 2001; morris & doak, 2002; norris, 2004). to date, pva have been successfully used to project pos- sible population futures for a variety of endangered aquatic organisms including turtles (crouse et al., 1987; enneson & litzgus, 2008), am- phibians (di minn & griffiths, 2010; zambrano, vega, herrera, prado, & reynoso, 2007), invertebrates (chilvers, 2011; grady & valiela, 2006; rogers- bennett & leaf, 2006) and fishes (cortés, 2002; robertson, 2005; vélez- espino, 2005; vélez- espino & koops, 2009a,b; vincenzi et al., 2008; williams, echelle, toepfer, williams, & fisher, 1999; worthington, kemp, & osborne, 2011). however, few pva on freshwa- ter fishes have been applied to small- bodied fishes, even though small fishes differ in their sensitivity to exploitation, catastrophic events and habitat loss (van der lee & koops, 2016; pope, rice, daan, jennings, & gislason, 2006; vélez- espino & koops, 2012). also, the responses of small- bodied fishes to ecosystem- wide stressors may not be well described by general relationships dominated by data for larger- sized fishes. for example, both pope et al. (2006) and van der lee and koops (2016) built models based on general size- based relationships, and in both cases, the lower size was limited to a 15 cm maximum length due to poor model performance for smaller fishes. the dynamics of small fishes, therefore, cannot be extrapolated based on the larger- bodied fishes, and there is insufficient research on small- bodied fishes to understand how the population dynamic responses of small- bodied fishes may differ from those of larger- bodied fishes. eastern sand darter, ammocrypta pellucida, is a small- bodied fish listed as threatened under canada’s species at risk act (sara) and is an ideal candidate for matrix modelling and pva. limited biological     |  379 information for canadian populations currently hampers the realistic development of required recovery strategies and management pro- grammes (bouvier & mandrak, 2010; cosewic 2009; finch, vélez- espino, doka, power, & koops, 2011; fisheries and oceans canada 2012; rosenfeld & hatfield, 2006). eastern sand darter is also a glob- ally rare percid that has experienced notable declines in its historic dis- tributional range and is now listed as a species at risk in nine of the 11 jurisdictions in which it occurs (cosewic 2009; natureserve 2015). once distributed from southern kentucky and the southern reaches of the ohio river watershed to southern lake huron (cosewic 2009; grandmaison, mayasich, & etnier, 2004), the current distribution is now more restricted and disjunct (figure 1). eastern sand darter pre- fer sandy and fine gravel substrates in lakes and rivers due to their fos- sorial behaviour (dextrase, mandrak, & schaefer, 2014; faber, 2006). thus, population declines have been attributed to habitat destruction, primarily via the siltation of sandy areas from bank erosion and altered stream channels (cosewic 2009; daniels, 1993; dextrase, staton, & metcalfe- smith, 2003; drake, power, koops, doka, & mandrak, 2008; holm & mandrak, 1996; jordan & copeland, 1877; o’brien & facey, 2008; scott & crossman, 1973). point and nonpoint contamination, invasive species (e.g. round goby neogobius melanostomus), lack of ge- netic variation, baitfish harvest- related mortality and the pet trade are also thought to have contributed to population declines (cosewic 2009; cudmore, mackinnon, & madzia, 2004). few detailed population studies for eastern sand darter have been completed with a recent study suggesting some variability in life- history attributes between populations especially with regard to environmental differences (finch, faber, koops, doka, & power, 2013; spreitzer, 1979). recent studies have reported increased lon- gevity estimates (from 2+ to 3+ years, e.g. drake et al., 2008; finch et al., 2013), delayed female maturation (2+ versus 1+, e.g. faber, 2006) and smaller clutch sizes (16–97 vs. 30–170, e.g. finch et al., 2013), a relationship between female age and clutch size (heins, 1985) and evidence for multiple spawning events (johnston, 1989; simon & wallus, 2006; winemiller & rose, 1992). individually, such differ- ences in population vital rates are likely to hold significant implications for population viability. collectively, they suggest that variability in population- specific vital rates is likely to complicate the prediction of population status, even with detailed knowledge of the anthropogenic and natural stresses affecting the population. appropriate development of future population scenarios for eastern sand darter will also require consideration of the implications of parameter uncertainty. in that regard, the availability of a controlled experimental frame in which the effects of life- history unknowns may be explored is vital. the use of a leslie matrix model- driven pva is one means by which limited biological information and the effects of pa- rameter uncertainty can be systematically explored to aid in the devel- opment of population- specific risk estimates and scientifically sound recovery strategies. the goal of this study was to construct a leslie matrix model suit- able for population viability analysis to assist with the recovery of eastern sand darter populations in canada using available population- specific information from the lower thames river eastern sand darter 380  |     finch et al. figure 1 global distribution of eastern sand darter (ammocrypta pellucida ) illustrating the disjoint nature of the distribution. top left insert highlights the location of an isolated ontario population. bottom left insert highlights the distributional area with respect to continental north america. the star denotes the location of the studied population population. the study objectives were as follows: (i) to identify the lim- iting life stages and vital rates using pva; (ii) to investigate how differing life- history strategies (e.g. multiple clutches and earlier age at maturity) and parameter uncertainty affect estimated population growth rate using perturbation analyses; and (iii) to predict the long- term viability of the population by incorporating environmental stochasticity. 2 |  materials and methods field sampling for eastern sand darter occurred in the area with the most robust population in canada, the lower thames river in south- ern ontario, during the summers of 2006 and 2007 (june–august). additional demographic information from a 2005 field survey (drake et al., 2008) was used to create a 3- year data set, the minimum size necessary for estimating population survival rates (beissinger & westphal, 1998). detailed description of field sampling methodology can be found in drake et al. (2008), while detailed explanation of the determination of age at first maturity, longevity, clutch size and fecun- dity information can be found in finch et al. (2013). briefly, eastern sand darter were collected from 10 depositional areas, typically sand- dominated point bars, using a three- pass seining method with a 10- m bag seine (1.8 m × 3.7 m wing with 0.64 cm mesh size and a 1.8 m × 1.8 m × 1.8 m bag with 0.32 cm mesh size). captured eastern sand darter individuals were sedated using clove oil, measured for total length (mm), had scales removed for ageing analysis and were examined for probable spawning readiness. incidental eastern sand darter mortalities were retained on ice and frozen for subsequent anal- yses. eastern sand darter capture and handling were approved under the fisheries and oceans canada species at risk permitting process and government of canada animal care committee regulations. 2.1 | model approach a deterministic, density- independent, leslie matrix model (beissinger & westphal, 1998; caswell, 2001; leslie, 1945; morris & doak, 2002) finch et al. f1 f2 0 age 0+ p0 1 age 1+ p1 2 age 2+ f3 p2 3 age 3+ figure 2 eastern sand darter life cycle diagram for the postbreeding deterministic leslie matrix model. circles indicate age- class, and fi defines mean age- class fertility rate. pi represents the probability of an individual in age- class i surviving for 1 year (modified from caswell, 2001) was constructed. as population surveys occurred following spring spawning, a postbreeding model consisting of four age- classes (ages 0+ through to 3+; finch et al., 2013) was used. figure 2 illustrates the model, where fi represents the mean reproductive output (fertility) of the ith age- class and pi represents the transition probability associated with surviving from age- class i to i + 1 (caswell, 2001). age- class survival probabilities, p1 and p2, were estimated from 2005 to 2007 thames river catch information using chapman– robson methods (chapman & robson, 1960; robson & chapman, 1961). differences in survival between years were calculated using analysis of variance (anova) followed by comparisons of means using the conservative tukey–kramer hsd post hoc test (e.g. zar, 2010). limited information on first- year survival for eastern sand darter made it impossible to quantify p0 values directly from either field stud- ies or literature sources. therefore, p0 was calculated by assuming that the population was in stable equilibrium (λ = 1.0), with p0 obtained as the value necessary to yield a finite population growth equal to one (caswell, 2001; morris & doak, 2002; rogers- bennett & leaf, 2006; vaughan & saila, 1976). fertility values for each age- class (i) were calculated following morris and doak (2002) as follows: fi = miqipicifi, (1) where mi is the number of female offspring per female assuming that the sex ratio for the parents is the same as that for the offspring, qi is the proportion of the population that is reproducing, pi is the survival of the individuals within the ith age- class, ci is the number of clutches laid per season, and fi is the number of eggs per clutch (morris & doak, 2002; vélez- espino, 2005). the proportion of females reproducing was calculated using the percentage of females over 42 mm, the mini- mum size for reproduction found by spreitzer (1979). use of population- specific information on fertility and survival in- formation in the construction of the projection matrix (l) allows future prediction of age- class abundances n(t + m), given an initial age- class abundance vector, n(t), at any period in the future (m) as follows: n(t + m) = lmn(t). (2)     |  381 the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix defines the intrinsic rate of population increase, r, from which the finite rate of population increase, λ, may be determined as follows(caswell, 2001): λ = er (3) the right (ω) and left (ν) eigenvectors of the projection matrix also provide information on the stable age distribution and reproductive contributions by age- class. combined, the eigenvalues and eigenvec- tors provide valuable information on population status and viability that is useful for understanding how management actions might mini- mise future extinction risks (caswell, 2001; crouse et al., 1987; morris & doak, 2002). limiting life stages and the relative contributions of model pa- rameters were determined using controlled model simulations and through the computation of parameter elasticities (eij) that express the proportional change in λ resulting from a known proportional change in a matrix parameter (aij) as follows (benton & grant, 1999; caswell, 2001; morris et al., 2002). eij = aij λ 𝜕λ 𝜕aij = aij λ i,ω ν j < ω,ν > , (4) where <ω,ν> represent the scalar products of the right (ω) and left (ν) eigenvectors of the leslie projection matrix (caswell, 2001; de kroon, plaisnier, van groenendael, & caswell, 1986), aij is the perturbed pro- jection matrix element (e.g. age- class fertility, age- class survival), and  aij is the simulation change in aij. elasticities sum to 1.0, thereby allow- ing for the relative contribution of each model parameter to λ to be easily established (de kroon et al., 1986). commercially available software, ramas© metapop: viability analysis for stage- structured metapopulations version 5.0 software (applied biomathematics, setauket, ny, usa), was used to implement all variants of the leslie matrix modelling framework used for analyti- cal purposes in this study. 2.2 | perturbation analyses perturbation analyses used to investigate changes in λ in relation to changes in the deterministic base- model vital rates were performed in four different ways. first, survivorship for each age- class was sys- tematically manipulated, while holding the rest of the model param- eters at their original value. the original base- model survival values were systematically varied from a 50% decrease to a 150% increase in 25% increments and the resulting λ values were calculated. secondly, reproduction was investigated using scenarios based on the life- history information gathered from studies of other ammocrypta spp. populations (driver & adams, 2013; finch et al., 2013; heins, 1985; johnston, 1989; simon & wallus, 2006; spreitzer, 1979; winemiller & rose, 1992). the reproduction scenarios were broadly classified into three cat- egories: (i) variation in the number of clutches per individual; (ii) varia- tion in the proportion of individuals participating in reproduction; and (iii) variation in clutch size. see table 1 for information detailing each reproduction scenario. thirdly, the theoretical range of λ for the lower 382  |     finch et al. table 1 summary of perturbation scenarios involving reproductive strategies reported or suggested for ammocrypta spp. and the resulting impact on λ for the lower thames river eastern sand darter population. for each reproductive scenario group, details of the simulation experiment are described. the column new matrix value defines the parameter value used for the simulation scenario described, with the new parameter values listed in the order in which they are defined in the simulation column. λ defines the resulting finite rate of population growth. difference compares the scenario estimate to λ = 1, as obtained in the base case, with an increment of 0.01 representing a 1% change in population abundance reproduction scenario number of clutches (heins, 1985;

(2013) and corrected for a standardised 10,000 m2 area. 3 |  results 3.1 | field sampling and parameter estimation chapman–robson survival rate estimates ± standard deviation for p1 and p2 varied across sites and sampling years from 0.277 ± 0.022 finch et al. to 0.507 ± 0.016, with a mean survival rate of 0.386 ± 0.075 (n = 12) and a coefficient of variation of 19.87%. the majority (n = 5) of the survival estimates were obtained from the 2007 sampling season, but sufficient data for 2006 (n = 3) allowed comparison of survival between years that showed no significant differences (anova, f1,6 = 2.12, p = .20). insufficient data existed to test differences in sur- vival between the sites. fertility rates (27.60) for age- classes 2 and 3 were computed using a mean clutch size of 71.5 eggs, assuming two clutches per individual per year, 100% of all individuals participating in spawning and a sex ratio of 50:50. the mean fertility value for age- class 1 (25.15) was sim- ilarly computed, assuming that all 91.1% of the age 1+ individuals that reached the minimum required maturity length spawned. thus, 8.9% of age 1+ individuals were found to be below 42 mm, the spawning length threshold suggested by spreitzer (1979). 3.2 | population viability analyses assuming population equilibrium (λ = 1) and calculating p0 from the other matrix entries (caswell, 2001), the resulting lower thames river eastern sand darter population projection matrix (l) was determined as follows: l = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 0 0.025 0 0 0 0 25.15 27.60 27.60 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ 0 0 0 0.386 0 0.386 the stable age distribution (right eigenvector, w) indicates that 0+ individuals make up the majority of the population (table 2). reproductive values (left eigenvector, v) are highest at the age of first reproduction, declining only marginally as fish age to a max of 3+ years (table 2). the highest elasticity was associated with p0 (figure 3), indicat- ing that small changes to age 0+ survival have the largest effect on λ. high elasticities were also associated with f1 (0.405) and p1 (0.149). the lowest elasticities (0.041) were found for f3 and p2, indicating that changes in these parameters had little effect on λ. 3.3 | perturbation analyses increases and decreases in survival over the range of −50% to +150% resulted in monotonic changes in the finite rate of population growth, with maximum increases in λ occurring with a 150% increase in p0 and maximal decreases occurring with a 50% decrease in p0 (figure 4). in the range of −25% to 25%, only minor variations in λ were observed (±10%). varying the number of clutches over the range from one to four resulted in a 25% reduction in population growth rate when all age- classes produced a single clutch and up to a 35% increase in λ when all age- classes produced four clutches relative to the base case of two clutches per year. differing the size of clutches caused a variation of ±46% in λ when the lowest (16 ova) and highest

individuals participated in spawning, a −35% decrease in λ was noted compared to when all age- classes participated in reproduction (table 1). the population growth for the lower thames river eastern sand darter population based on the worst- and best- case scenarios (using the lowest and highest p and f values) indicated that λ could range between 0.703 and 1.311, a total variation of 60.8%. inclusion of en- vironmental stochasticity yielded extinction probabilities within the next 100 years in the range of 17.31–26.34% (table 3). population abundance trajectories appear to remain relatively stable (figure 5), with the minimum expected abundance in excess of 900/10,000 m2 in all considered scenarios (table 3). 4 |  discussion the leslie matrix model constructed using acquired

darter populations. environmental stochasticity acting on all life- history parameters poses real risks for the continued viability of lower thames river populations, with significant chances of local ex- tinction predicted on the basis of what is currently known about those populations. based on the elasticity results from this analysis, the limiting life- stage vital rates are p0 and f1 (figure 3), which are in line with the findings of the legislated recovery potential assessment and modelling completed as part of canada’s species at risk act (bouvier & mandrak, 2010; finch et al., 2011). the importance of p0 and f1, as determined from their elasticities combined with the domination of 0+ individuals in the stable age distribution (table 2), suggests that variation in the survival of eastern sand darter individuals from egg to first spawning is a key driver of λ and is consistent with general conclusions drawn for other small- bodied fishes (van der lee & koops, 2016). based on the modelling results, therefore, management activities should focus on strategies designed to ensure successful spawning and improve- ment of 0+ survival rates. conservation and restoration of juvenile and spawning habitats have been suggested as a means of protect- ing freshwater teleosts (vélez- espino, fox, & mclaughlin, 2006) and, based on the present study, should be an important component of eastern sand darter recovery activities. given that eastern sand darter has a demonstrated preference for shallow, slow- moving waters over sand substrates typical of river depositional areas, it is necessary to ensure that the hydrological and sedimentation processes governing the creation of these habitat areas are maintained (cudmore et al., 2004; daniels, 1989; fisheries and oceans canada 2012; holm & mandrak, 1996). to that end, water ab- straction, diversion and impoundment activities known to alter flow regimes, flushing events and thermal regimes hold potentially serious consequences for eastern sand darter populations. for example, while eastern sand darter spawning events have never been observed in the wild, optimal spawning conditions are thought to exist when water temperatures are between 20.5 and 23°c (johnston, 1989; simon & wallus, 2006). nonoptimal water temperatures in other darter species have been linked to decreased p0 values with increased water tem- peratures causing larval and egg mortalities due to fungal infections and decreased water temperatures inhibiting egg release and larval growth (bonner, brandt, fries, & whiteside, 1998; poly, 2003). increased protection of suitable depositional areas is also likely to benefit 0+ individuals. drake et al. (2008) found that 0+ growth was negatively correlated to per cent silt substrate composition, but finch et al. positively correlated to per cent sand substrate composition. in con- trast, no correlation was found for adult phases. correlations suggest that 0+ individuals are more sensitive to variations in substrate com- position and it is reasonable to assume p0 would be compromised as substrate siltation rates increase. mechanisms for reducing p0 in habi- tats with a greater percentage of silt in the substrate include increased physiological costs associated with respiration when engaged in bury- ing behaviour (daniels, 1989; drake et al., 2008; grandmaison et al., 2004; holm & mandrak, 1996; simon & wallus, 2006) and the loss of access to the more productive sand- dominant substrates (riznyk & phinney, 1972; wulff, sundback, nilsson, carlson, & jonsson, 1997). another consideration with respect to increased protection for 0+ individuals is the suggestion that eastern sand darter, like many other darter species, has a short larval pelagic phase during which lar- vae might be transported downstream of their natal sites (freeman & freeman, 1994; rakes, shute, & shute, 1999; simon & wallus, 2006; slack, ross, & ewing, 2004). this has implications for eastern sand darter population recovery especially as estimates for the minimum amount of necessary habitat for species persistence are based on the eastern sand darter being sedentary and in discrete nonmigratory populations (bouvier & mandrak, 2010; finch et al., 2011). research on other small- bodied fishes has suggested possible metapopulation reliance on upstream populations as a source of recruits for down- stream populations (bennett, kuhajda, & howell, 2008; labbe & fausch, 2000). for eastern sand darter, a demonstrated lack of within- river genetic structure among fragmented microhabitats suggests that dispersal or environmentally induced changes in dispersal distances resulting from unstable habitats (faber & white, 2000) may pre- clude substantial genetic differentiation within rivers (ginson, walter, mandrak, beneteau, & heath, 2015). concentration on localised larval habitat features alone, therefore, may not suffice to ensure protection of eastern sand darter populations within a single river reach. landscape- level processes such as disturbance, dispersal and hab- itat patch mosaic structure have been found to influence populations of arkansas darter, etheostoma cragini (labbe & fausch, 2000), and similar factors could have implications for the lower thames river eastern sand darter population. local variations in p0, therefore, might be offset by downstream larval drift and facilitated by natural distur- bance regimes that create and redistribute habitat and refugia within the broader landscape (e.g. bisson, 1995; reeves, benda, burnett, bisson, & sedell, 1995). the importance of p0 for the population used in this study does not account for recruitment effects. improved ef- forts at refining understanding of larval drift and/or interpopulation or prespawning adult migration are, therefore, warranted. the reproduction scenarios examined here and the resulting sen- sitivity of λ to reproduction- related assumptions highlight the need for further detailed reproductive studies. in particular, improved under- standing of clutch numbers, size and the period over which spawning occurs is required. temporal variations in spawning readiness, clutch size and the apparent wide variety of vital rates suggest spawning may occur over a protracted period of time from early may until late june. spawning dates can vary with age and sex in fishes, with older mature individuals spawning earlier in the season (bagenal, 1971). information     |  385 on reproductive tactics available for this study suggested a wide variety of plausible reproductive scenarios. the variation in outcomes may have been driven by information paucity or uncertainty. alternatively, the variation and its associated impacts on λ may simply reflect population growth rate plasticity. such plasticity is often observed in species living in unpredictable environments where environmental conditions such as floods and droughts can compromise population survival (vinyoles & de sostoa, 2007). the ability to produce extra clutches under favourable environmental conditions can compensate for periods when reproduc- tive output (e.g. decreased clutch size and number of clutches) declines in the face of environmental constraints (king & mcfarlene, 2003; pianka, 1970; vinyoles & de sostoa, 2007; winemiller & rose, 1992). reproductive plasticity combined with dependence on juvenile survival classifies eastern sand darter as an opportunistic strategist. opportunistic strategists are typically small- bodied, short- lived fishes where rapid larval growth, early maturation (typically) and frequent reproduction facilitate rapid population growth and turnover rates (vélez- espino et al., 2006; winemiller & rose, 1992). these mecha- nisms can also make opportunistic strategists more susceptible to extinction when exposed to prolonged periods of natural or anthro- pogenic stresses (olden et al., 2007). as noted here, even under fairly optimistic reproduction and survival scenarios, extinction probabilities were high. coupled with evidence for declining numbers and sugges- tions that existing population numbers are at historic lows (holm & mandrak, 1995), an evolutionary susceptibility to extinction under stress suggests the future viability of the lower thames river eastern sand darter population is far from assured. accordingly, consideration of these factors suggests caution must be taken when interpreting the projected stable population trajectory (figure 5). to date, limited research on eastern sand darter population dy- namics has impeded the ability of resource managers to develop management strategies. population models such as the one described here provide one means of exploring eastern sand darter population dynamics. nevertheless, detailed studies on reproduction and the life- history characteristics of the species are still needed to properly understand and rank the factors influencing λ. in the absence of such studies, it is evident that with the predicted high extinction probability for eastern sand darter, management activities must focus on suitable habitat protection to increase p0 and ensure future population viability and/or the recovery of additional habitats within currently occupied watersheds. ultimately, population viability will depend on whether the anthropogenic stressors associated with habitat degradation can be removed in time to allow for the successful recovery of the lower thames river eastern sand darter population. acknowledgements l. bouvier, c. viloria, l. bennett, a. drake, d. marson, c. robinson, j. ho and c. rosairus provided field and laboratory assistance. a. doolittle and a. lewin prepared figure 1 based on the updated and detailed distribu- tion data provided by a. dextrase. funding for this project was provided by fisheries and oceans canada’s species at risk program (sarcep) and the environment canada interdepartmental recovery fund. 386  |     references akcakaya, h. r., burgman, m. a., kindwall, o., wood, c. c., sjogren- gulve, p., hatfield, j. s., & mccarthy, m. a.
