vitousek, mooney, melillo, & lubchenko, 1997). aquatic ecosystems are central to many human activities which gives them high economic value but makes them highly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance (stendera et al., 2012). reservoirs are hydrosystems resulting from human action, and dams profoundly alter ecological continuity and river function- ing (baxter, 1977). this transformation obviously modifies hydrol- ogy and ecosystem size, and ultimately has consequences on water temperature, oxygenation, type, availability and diversity of resources and habitats (baxter, 1977). despite these impacts, more and more dams are built to meet the demand for irrigation and hydroelectric- ity production notably. additionally to their intrinsic altered hydro- morphological characteristics, reservoirs suffer from anthropogenic stressors, notably eutrophication and alien species introduction. their physicochemical and biological quality ensures the sustainability of the associated services (drinking water, leisure, angling, etc) so that their monitoring is a requirement of current regulations (clean water act of 1972; european water framework directive, 2000). the anthropo- genic origin of reservoirs prevents the determination of an undisturbed reference state (jennings, fore, & karr, 1995). analysing the responses ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:621–635. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff  |  621 © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd622  |     of reservoir communities to gradients of pressures therefore provides a statistical way of assessing the impact of these pressures without reference to an undisturbed state, as currently done in other heavily disturbed ecosystems (de juan, demestre, & thrush, 2009). understanding the responses of reservoirs’ communities along environmental and pressure gradients is therefore an important pri- ority in order to improve their ecological assessment (hering et al., 2014). biological communities are increasingly monitored as living organisms are sensitive to environmental changes. since the pioneer- ing work of karr (1981), fish assemblages have often been used to assess the biological integrity of different water body types (argillier et al., 2013; debenay et al., 2003; oberdorff et al., 2011). various community descriptors, usually referred to as metrics, may be used on their own, for example taxonomic richness (birk et al., 2012), or in multimetric indices such as indices of biotic integrity (ibis, karr, 1981). however, even if some preliminary indices have been specifi- cally proposed for reservoirs (blabolil et al., 2016; launois, veslot, irz, & argillier, 2011; mcdonough & hickman, 1999), such bioindicators are rarely studied in the literature. the existing fish multimetric indices generally include a variety of metrics describing specific composition and abundance. taxonomic richness (total or native only) has often been selected as a metric in ibis (drake & valley, 2005; mcdonough & hickman, 1999). other metrics based on communities’ structure (e.g. taxonomic diversity or evenness) have been included in some ibis (appelberg, bergquist, & degerman, 2000; tammi, lappalainen, & rask, 2001), but their use is still rare. in some cases, taxonomic diver- sity metrics may not permit the detection of a community’s response to a disturbance. when stressors lead to species replacement by functionally different species (i.e. with different traits providing infor- mation on how species interact with their environment (violle et al., 2007)), taxonomic metrics may not change and are therefore poor indicators of stressor. in such situation, the use of functional diver- sity metrics can provide additional information on the response of fish communities to stressors (rosenfeld, 2002; villéger, ramos miranda, flores hernández, & mouillot, 2010). this was observed by villéger et al. (2010) in an estuarial lagoon. their study analysing the effects of a major environmental degradation (notably turbidity increase) on fish communities showed highly contrasting responses of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics. while taxonomic richness increased due to species introductions exceeding species extirpations, functional divergence and specialisation decreased, indicating a severe decline of functionally specialised species (villéger et al., 2010). in rivers, func- tional richness, evenness, originality and specialisation of fish com- munities were found to be sensitive to land use (clavel et al., 2013; pool, olden, whittier, & paukert, 2010). in natural lakes, fish functional traits were shown to respond to environmental and pressure gradients (brind’amour, boisclair, dray, & legendre, 2011; erős, heino, schmera, & rask, 2009). at the community functional structure level, erős et al. (2009) showed that habitat size (lake area and max depth) and both ph and total phosphorus affected the functional diversity of fish com- munities in finland natural lakes. functional diversity metrics may therefore be used in addition to taxonomic metrics to assess poten- tial modifications of species–environment interactions in response to anthropogenic stressors in various ecosystems (mouillot, graham, villéger, mason, & bellwood, 2013) but, to our knowledge, their appli- cation on reservoirs has not been performed to date. comparably to other freshwater ecosystems, we expect eutrophication to modify physicochemical conditions (oxygenation and turbidity notably) and food resources fish depend on such as primary producers or ben- thic fine particulate organic matter (jeppesen, jensen, søndergaard, lauridsen, & landkildehus, 2000). along the eutrophication gradient, altered habitat conditions and resources differentially impact fish spe- cies depending on their functional abilities. in most published works dedicated to the development of bio- indicators, fish metrics are analysed in response to a single stressor, eutrophication in most of the cases. however, water bodies often experience effects from multiple stressors (ormerod, dobson, hildrew, & townsend, 2010). while river communities mainly suffer from hydromorphological alterations, natural lakes are notably impacted by eutrophication and non- native species (stendera et al., 2012). here we focus on the particular case of lakes formed on dammed rivers. the accumulation of potential pressures frequently put them in multi- ple stressors situations (hering et al., 2014). when multiple stressors are present, synergistic effects may take place, making the analysis of these interacting factors important (lévêque, oberdorff, paugy, stiassny, & tedesco, 2007; ormerod et al., 2010), notably because most of these interactions are still not well understood (hering et al., 2014; piggott, townsend, & matthaei, 2015; stendera et al., 2012; strayer, 2010). consequently, it is very important to consider these potential interactions in the development of bioindicators. here we used a statistical modelling approach to identify and com- pare the respective sensitivities of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to eutrophication and non- native fishes in 112 french low- land reservoirs. in these reservoirs, fish communities consist of pre- damming riverine species, naturally colonising species and of stocked species. these native lowland fish assemblages include generally the roach (rutilus rutilus l. 1758), common perch (perca fluviatilis l. 1758) and northern pike (esox lucius l. 1758) (irz, laurent, messad, pronier, & argillier, 2002). non- native introduced species are often large pred- ators such as pikeperch (sander lucioperca l. 1758) that disturb the structure and dynamics of natural communities (blanchet et al., 2010; cucherousset & olden, 2011; eby, roach, crowder, & stanford, 2006; irz, argillier, & proteau, 2004). after this initial stocking event, stocking activities are limited to a few species of angling interest (salmonids essentially) due to the inefficiency of most of the stocking programmes (argillier et al. 2002). as a consequence, these species appear only in some systems and only sporadically. therefore, observed communi- ties can now be considered as an association of self- sustaining pop- ulations of species that occurred naturally before the damming and of initially stocked (native, translocated or exotic) species (irz et al., 2002). introduced species that settled in reservoirs had to be adapted to the environment and either found a vacant niche or overlapped with a native species’ niche. non- native species, especially exotic spe- cies that have evolved in a distinct biogeographic region, are more sus- ceptible to overlap functionally with native species than native species together (buckley & catford, 2016). this is especially true in reservoirs sagouis et al.where introduced species are essentially lacustrine while predamming species were riverine. hence, we can expect (i) a relationship between these non- native species and the functional structure of the whole communities (mercado- silva et al., 2009) and (ii) that they interact with eutrophication, which has already been demonstrated to be an important stressor (blabolil et al., 2016; launois et al., 2011). because in such large studies it is important to consider the effect of natural environmental parameters on fish communities (brucet et al., 2013; feld et al., 2016; irz, de bortoli, et al., 2007), five compet- ing models integrated in a nested fashion the effects of biogeography, habitat and of the two studied stressors individually or in interaction. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | fish community data fish communities were described in 112 reservoirs located in con- tinental france and corsica between 42 and 51°n and −4 and 9°e (fig. 1). fishing campaigns occurred between 2005 and 2014. they were made during the summer period following the nordic standard protocol (en 14757:2013). benthic gillnets (30 m long and 1.5 m high) with 12 mesh sizes ranging from 5 to 55 mm knot to knot (bar mesh) were set during a night including sunset and sunrise activity periods. the total number of nets (7 to 64) depends on the lake volume and area and they were set in a random stratified fashion. depth strata are determined based on depth maps and have to be of similar volume. finally, nets are set randomly in each depth stratum. fish were iden- tified to species level, counted and weighted. fish species numerical abundance and biomass were then standardised by computing catch per unit effort (cpue, number of individuals caught by m2 by night) and biomass per unit effort (bpue, grams of fish by m2 by night). to avoid possible selectivity bias in the assessment of the abundance of the young of the year individuals due to different sampling dates (between early and late summer), we excluded all individuals measur- ing less than 80 mm. this had no impact on the species richness. lakes containing less than five species or fishes not identified to species level were excluded as the computation of functional divergence (villéger, mason, & mouillot, 2008) needed at least five fully described species (number of species has to be greater than the number of functional traits). reservoirs having less than five species were essentially high- altitude ecosystems with a mean altitude of 800 m versus 300 m for the studied ecosystems. they also had a smaller mean phosphorus con- centration than studied lakes (23 vs. 53 μg l−1). however, they only constitute a small subset of the environmental and pressure conditions encountered among all studied lakes. as a consequence, we should not observe any major modification of results if they were included. morphological traits allow a continuous discrimination of spe- cies and offer deep insight in species functions as it is assumed that species phenotype is correlated with resource use, food and habitat notably (gatz, 1979; mouillot et al., 2005). for each of the 39 species (appendix 1), 13 standardised morphological traits were calculated thanks to 15 measures made on 3 to 161 photographs per species as described by schleuter et al. (2012). mean number of photographs per     |  623 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 ) ° ( e d u t i t a l −5 −3 −1 1 3 5 7 9 longitude (°) figure 1 map of the 112 lakes studied. catchment delineations (in grey) used to determine fish species origin (native or non- native of the watershed (brosse et al., 2013;

and (ii) three traits standardised by fish height: caudal peduncle length and height, and pectoral fin position (table 1). the functional role of the common perch substantially changes with ontogeny (hjelm, persson, & christensen, 2000). as it is one of the most abundant species, we took into account the different roles it played during its develop- ment by separating perch individuals into young and adult categories (young <= 130 mm < adults) with corresponding traits. a principal component analysis (pca) allowed us to summarise the 13 traits in four pca axes explaining 74.45% of the variance and creating a sim- plified four- dimensional functional space (table 1, fig. 2). traits were scaled and centred before analysis, and the pca was computed with the r package ade4 (dray & dufour, 2007). 2.2 | environmental data the reservoirs were located at altitudes ranging from 3 to 1,044 m above sea level (fig. 3a) and experienced widely varying environmen- tal conditions (fig. 3). reservoirs were described by biogeographic and habitat variables extracted from national databases, that is latitude, longitude, altitude (m asl), lake maximal depth (m), lake area (km2) and lake catchment area (km2). additionally, local air temperatures were sagouis et al.624  |     table 1 functional traits scores on each of the four principal component analysis axes axis 1 axis 2 axis 3 axis 4 28 2 food acquisition eye position eye diameter head length upper jaw length mouth orientation locomotion pectoral fin length pectoral fin position pelvic fin length body depth caudal fin length peduncle depth peduncle length ratio peduncle length 3.58 33.7 60.07 23.95 17.11 45.93 −7.77 44.22 71.32 −13.95 −63.67 −46.02 −30.22 29.47 −41.67 −0.78 26.69 −8.08 −27.11 18.38 −21.98 −27.56 −75.88 −14.65 −25.72 −38.51 −30.05 4.84 −33.28 −37.9 −29.00 6.35 40.42 14.62 −0.36 3.14 4.58 −26.3 −29.64 −36.91 19.79 −5.88 11.46 45.81 −20.61 33.43 −19.18 −0.77 −7.03 −17.1 −1.96 1.63 lepogi 7 1 8 40 9 10 18 25 13 gambaf pseupa axis 1 11 26 5 29 34 14 17 20 22 37 21 36 39 6 38 12 ameime oncomy 32 33 31 30 micrsa 35 the first four axes respectively explained 34.6%, 18.0%, 12.0% and 8.9% of the variance. 15 axis 2 modelled for each lake (safran system—vidal, martin, franchistéguy, baillon, & soubeyroux, 2010) and used to compute mean annual tem- peratures and mean amplitudes of temperature (july−january tem- peratures) for the fishing year and the five years before. 12 axis 1 = 35%;

dias et al., 2014). species were considered as non- native in a lake if they did not naturally occur in the catchment the lake belonged to. this information allowed us to compute the percentage of non- native species in each lake (%nn; proportion of non-native species in biomass per unit of effort, fig. 3h). 2.4 | metrics computation three taxonomic metrics were computed based on fish communi- ties (non- native species included). taxonomic richness is the total number of species present in the community. taxonomic diversity was described with shannon diversity index (magurran, 2004), and taxonomic evenness was computed following the equation of pielou (magurran, 2004). three functional diversity metrics were computed based on species abundances and trait values in the summarised func- tional space (figs 2 and 4). functional richness was computed as the mean of the four one- dimensional functional richness metrics (fris) taking into account intraspecific variability (schleuter, daufresne, massol, & argillier, 2010). multidimensional functional evenness (feve) and divergence (fdiv) metrics were computed following  33 25 lepogi 6 axis 3 ameime 8 10 14 38 22 11 39 35 1 7 26 20 9 30 31 37 32 36 40 micrsa oncomy 15 29 34 28 gambaf pseupa 2 21 axis 4 figure 2 distribution of measured individuals on the first four principal component analysis axes. exotic species codes stand for ameiurus melas (ameime), gambusia affinis (gambaf), lepomis gibbosus (lepogi), micropterus salmoides (micrsa), oncorhynchus_mykiss (oncomy) and pseudorasbora parva (pseupa). numbered species codes are indicated in appendix 1. groups 25 and 40 respectively represent >130 mm and <130 mm common perchs perca fluviatilis. for clarity purpose, european eel anguila anguila (l. 1758) individuals were removed from the plot as they are placed far from other species although they were included in the analyses villéger et al.

species at the edges of the functional space (mason, mouillot, lee, & wilson, 2005; villéger et al., 2008). sagouis et al.alban sagouis et al     |  625 (a) y c n e u q e r f (c) y c n e u q e r f

responses to environmental and stressor gradients were considered, consisting in multiple linear regressions (table 2). the model “biogeography” only considered geo- graphical variables. the model “habitat” additionally included habitat variables. the model “eutrophication” additionally included the total phosphorus concentration and a quadratic term of total phosphorus concentration in the lakes allowing testing either linear or humped relations. the model “non- native species” added the biomass- based proportion of non- native species (%nn) to habitat variables. finally, the model “interacting stressors” included all covariates as well as the two interactions between the two eutrophication proxies (tp and tp2) and %nn (table 2). for each response variable, the five models were ranked according to their aicc value, the model hav- ing the smaller aicc value being the most likely and parsimonious (burnham, anderson, & huyvaert, 2010). we also computed model akaike weights which represent the model probability based on the data used (burnham et al., 2010). models from the best to a 0.95 cumulative weight threshold were further interpreted (burnham et al., 2010). all model selection procedures were performed using the r sagouis et al.626  |     functional richness functional divergence functional evenness (a) (b) (c) n o ɵ i s o p n o ɵ i s o p n o ɵ i s o p prey

analyses on models of interest were run by computing type 2 anovas on the multiple linear regressions which allowed us to determine which variables significantly affected responses and in which direction. taxonomic diversity (shannon index) and functional richness were correlated with taxonomic richness (spearman correlation coefficient equal .38 and .64 respectively). we consequently took into account these correlations by adding taxonomic richness as an explanatory variable in the models built for taxonomic diversity and functional richness. this method enables to assess the effect of the various covariables on community structure beyond their effect on taxonomic richness. finally, we checked the robustness of functional diversity met- rics to the removal of morphological traits used in the pca. for each n number of removed traits (1 to 7), 999 random subsets of 13- n traits were selected. corresponding pca scores were computed and diversity indices calculated for 112 lakes.

in 110 of the 112 stud- ied reservoirs. in invaded lakes, non- native species richness ranged from 1 to 7 species (3.2 ± 1.5, mean ± se). twenty- four different species were considered as non- native in at least one lake. among them, pikeperch sander lucioperca (l. 1758) and ruffe gymnocephalus cernua (l. 1758), the most widespread non- native species, were respectively present in 85 and 58 lakes as non- native species. six species (pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus (l. 1758) (37 occurrences), black bullhead ameiurus melas (rafinesque 1820) (31 occurrences), sagouis et al.rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum 1792) (10 occur- rences), largemouth bass micropterus salmoides (lacepède 1802) (two occurrences), mosquitofish gambusia affinis (baird & girard 1853) (two occurrences) and stone moroko pseudorasbora parva (temminck & schlegel 1846) (two occurrences) were exotic (non- native from the european continent). 3.3 | multiple linear modelling models obtained a maximal coefficient of determination (r2) of .42, but most of them were below 0.3 indicating a poor explanatory power of the tested covariates (table 4). taxonomic richness was better explained by “habitat,” but “non- natives” model also had a relatively large aicc weight (table 4). when analysing the selected three best models (reaching the threshold of 0.95 cumulative aicc weight), tax- onomic richness was positively related to lake area and catchment area while it was negatively correlated with amplitude of temperature (table 4). taxonomic diversity and evenness best models were “biogeogra- phy,” but “non- natives” and “habitat” were also selected for the two metrics (table 4). the “biogeography” model revealed positive effects of latitude on taxonomic diversity and evenness (table 4). moreover, a positive effect of taxonomic richness on taxonomic diversity was shown in all models (table 4). these models revealed a significant neg- ative effect of altitude on taxonomic diversity and evenness (table 4). in addition, anovas showed almost significant positive effects of the proportion of non- native species on taxonomic evenness (|t| = 1.93, p = .057, table 4). functional richness best selected model was “non- natives” (table 5). the anovas revealed consistent positive effects of taxo- nomic richness and mean temperature on functional richness (table 5). the analysis of the “non- natives” model reveals that functional rich- ness also significantly decreased with catchment area and the pro- portion of non- native species (table 5). besides, when analysing the other selected models (“interacting stressors” and “habitat”), mean temperature and ecosystem size variables also had significant effects on functional richness (table 5). in the “interacting stressors” model, the interactions between eutrophication proxies and the proportion of non- native species were not significant (table 5). functional evenness best selected model is “interacting stress- ors” (table 5). anovas of the three best models revealed consistent effects of latitude and lake maximal depth and the “interacting stress- ors” model additionally detected significant effects of the interaction between total phosphorus and the proportion of non- native species (table 5). “habitat” model also showed that both mean temperature and amplitude of temperature were important variables (table 5). finally, all models applied to functional divergence were included in the 0.95 aicc weight threshold (table 5). anovas revealed con- sistent negative and significant effects of latitude, altitude and mean temperature on functional divergence (table 5). analysing the “non- natives” and “eutrophication” models showed no significant effect of the stressors, but the “interacting stressors” model detected sig- nificant effects of the interaction between proportion of non- native     |  627 species and total phosphorus (table 5). the interaction between the proportion of non- native species and total phosphorus2 is marginally significant (table 5). 3.4 | robustness analysis the spearman correlation ratios between observed and simulated functional diversity indices obtained for different number of traits involved in the pca are presented in table 6. functional richness and divergence obtained very high correlation ratios even when more than half the traits were removed. functional evenness also obtained good correlation ratios although it was more sensitive to the number of used traits in the pca. this analysis shows that the functional diversity metrics we selected are rather robust to trait removal. 4 |  discussion our study aimed at analysing the sensitivities and the responses of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to environmental and stressor gradients using a data set of 112 french reservoir fish com- munities. we found that fish communities were influenced by latitude and environmental variables related to system or catchment size, temperature and altitude. we also detected stressor effects on com- munities’ functional structure. functional richness and evenness were best explained by a model including the proportion of non- native species. we were unable to detect any direct effect of eutrophica- tion. conversely, non- native species were found to directly impact fish community structure: the proportion of non- native species in biomass was negatively correlated with functional richness. these stressors were also found to have interacting effects on fish com- munities: the interaction term was significant and negative for both functional evenness and divergence. we further studied this interac- tion in more details and found that the effects of non- native species on functional evenness and divergence changed from positive for low levels of eutrophication to negative for large eutrophication levels (appendix 2). 4.1 | responses and sensitivities to stressors 4.1.1 | functional metrics functional diversity has been largely used to analyse the response of plant and animal communities to disturbance (biswas & mallik, 2010; ernst, linsenmair, & rödel, 2006; flynn et al., 2009; janeček et al., 2013; pakeman, 2011). in aquatic ecosystems, some studies based on the functional diversity of estuarial lagoon (villéger et al., 2010), riverine (clavel et al., 2013; pool et al., 2010), catchment (matsuzaki, sasaki, & akasaka, 2013) and lacustrine (brind’amour et al., 2011; erős et al., 2009) fish communities detected the effects of stressors and we expected the same sensitivity of func- tional richness and divergence notably, in french reservoirs. as sagouis et al.628  |     . j d a 2 r 7 2 . 7 2 . 7 2 . 6 2 . f d 8 9 0 1 3 1 2 0 . 2 1 2 . 3 2 . 8 1 . 2 2 . 1 2 . 3 1 . 8 0 . 1 1 . 3

the 999 spearman correlation values ± sd. the specific application of these metrics to reservoirs is novel, we compared our results to other, either lentic or lotic, water body types although the age and environmental conditions of studied reservoirs led us to preferentially compare them to lakes (irz et al., 2002). abiotic stressors and notably eutrophication have been found to modify fish communities and lake functioning in both natural lakes (brind’amour et al., 2011; erős et al., 2009; jeppesen et al., 2000) and reservoirs (cooke, welch, peterson, & nichols, 2005). in contrast, our models detected no direct effects of eutrophica- tion on functional diversity metrics. very few studies have yet used functional diversity metrics to detect stressor effects on fish com- munities, so it is still difficult to get a general picture on this topic. however, finland lake communities’ functional diversity was shown to moderately respond to eutrophication and ph (erős et al., 2009), and functional divergence of fish communities has been shown to respond to abiotic stressors in a limited area of an estuarial lagoon (villéger et al., 2010). this latter result can be explained by the suc- cess of generalist species in disturbed ecosystems (pool et al., 2010). it is worth noting that in the study of villéger et al. (2010), fish com- munities were compared before and after a complex mix of abiotic alterations during which non- native species settled. the arrival of non- native species in these conditions makes disentangling abiotic and biotic effects difficult notably because non- native species may be drivers and passengers of stressors at the same time, and biotic and abiotic stressors may interact (light & marchetti, 2007). indeed, non- native species may notably impact functional diversity through biotic interactions (competition or predation notably) with already present species (cucherousset & olden, 2011; hecky, mugidde, ramlal, talbot, & kling, 2010; strayer, 2010). these effects are sus- ceptible to worsen or to be worsened by eutrophication that has been shown to be a potential facilitating disturbance for non- native fish (bíró, 1997; hecky et al., 2010). in our study, results indicate that when the proportion of non- native species increases, functional richness decreases. it seems that non- native species often had redundant functional roles with native species or with each other. responses of functional evenness and divergence to the proportion of non- native species differed depending on eutrophication inten- sity. the interacting effects of eutrophication and non- native species stressors on functional divergence and evenness were antagonistic. we checked that it was indeed the case, using complementary anal- yses (appendix 2). results indicate that non- native species have positive effects on functional evenness and divergence in slightly eutrophic lakes and negative effects in the most eutrophic lakes. these results suggest that in ecosystems with low phosphorus con- centrations, non- native species increase functional balance and introduced species tend to have external positions in the functional space. the increase of evenness is related to empty niche filling by non- native species (pool et al., 2010). divergence increase is likely explained by the rather external positions of non- native species, centrarchids notably (fig. 2). on the contrary, in the most eutrophic lakes, non- native species’ positive effects seem to be mitigated by eutrophication effects. this may be explained by the opposing influ- ences of two processes. first, non- native species filling empty niches promotes functional evenness as observed in the least eutrophic lakes. second, the contrasted success of species depending on their resistance or resilience to disturbance decreases functional even- ness. this is partly consistent with observations made in freshwater ecosystems by matsuzaki et al. (2013) which indicate that successful introductions of non- native species are often due to their access to a free niche in the functional space. in the lower colorado heavily dammed rivers, non- native species had a higher functional diversity than native species which explains their ability to use free niches offered by reservoirs while native species were more restricted to strictly riverine habitats (pool et al., 2010). concerning contrasting success of species in eutrophic lakes, the decreases of functional evenness and divergence indicate the success of non- native gener- alist species which is coherent with the widely observed dominance of generalist species, omnivores notably, in eutrophic lakes (argillier et al., 2013). these interactive effects were seldom assessed and discussed in the literature; however, synergetic effects have been shown on fish community diversity of lake victoria (hecky et al., 2010) and lake balaton (bíró, 1997). our results point that interactive effects may be detected using functional metrics and proper interaction tests. in the case of antagonistic effects, introduced species and eutrophication effects seem to hide each other. 4.1.2 | taxonomic metrics although models involving stressors were selected to explain taxo- nomic metrics, “habitat” and “biogeography” models dominated and detailed analyses revealed no significant effects of studied stress- ors. comparable studies detected no effects of eutrophication on taxonomic richness in deep (eckmann & rösch, 1998) and shallow (bachmann et al., 1996) lakes. conversely, the sensitivity of taxonomic sagouis et al.richness and diversity to eutrophication has been demonstrated in danish shallow lakes (jeppesen et al., 2000). these opposing results show that no generalisable rule exists concerning taxonomic rich- ness response to eutrophication in lakes. although less frequently used, taxonomic evenness has also been included in indices of biotic integrity to assess disturbances including eutrophication (appelberg et al., 2000; tammi et al., 2001), but it was not shown to be sensi- tive to eutrophication in our study or in finnish lakes (tammi et al., 2001). a positive effect of the number of non- native species on taxo- nomic richness was found in previous studies in heavily dammed riv- ers (pool et al., 2010), in lakes (tammi, appelberg, & beier, 2003) and at the catchment scale (matsuzaki et al., 2013). however, rather than focusing on the raw number of non- native species, we used a biomass proportion of non- native species as we consider that it is ecologically more meaningful as it is expected to take into account non- native spe- cies dominance or rarity. as a counterpart, proportion of non- native species expressed in biomass is not well suited to assess taxonomic richness responses. besides, the widespread presence of non- native species in our data set (110 lakes of 112) may have lowered the detec- tion power of our analyses, if the effects of non- native species on fish communities do not form a gradual gradient of stress. finally, although rare, occasional stocking of native species such as brown_trout (salmo_trutta, l. 1758) in lowland systems where they do not maintain sus- tainable populations may temporally blur the biotic effects of non- native species. 4.2 | responses to environmental gradients despite the artificial origin of reservoir fish communities, our results confirm the importance of local- scale variables in the assem- bly of fish communities (irz, michonneau, et al., 2007; mason, irz, lanoiselée, mouillot, & argillier, 2008; wetzel, 2001). lake area and lake maximal depth are related to the size, the diversity and the amount of available habitats which allow more species and more dif- ferent trait values to coexist, thus enhancing both taxonomic and functional diversity (brucet et al., 2013; irz, michonneau, et al., 2007; mason et al., 2008; pool et al., 2010; villéger et al., 2010). we studied responses of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to proxies of ecosystem productivity (latitude, mean temperature) and harshness (altitude, amplitude of temperature). following the spe- cies–energy hypothesis (wright, 1983) and the relation between temperature and productivity (karlsson, jonsson, & jansson, 2005), latitude and mean temperature are related to the variety and amount of resources found in lakes influencing the number of species and the diversity of traits expressed in the communities. taxonomic diversity surprisingly responded neither to mean temperature nor to latitude contrary to relations found in the literature (griffiths, 1997; hawkins, field, & cornell, 2003). on the contrary, functional rich- ness increased with mean temperature coherently with the literature which confirms that the more productive an ecosystem is, the more different trait values it can sustain (brucet et al., 2013; mason et al., 2008). finally, taxonomic diversity responded to ecosystem harsh- ness variables (altitude and amplitude of temperature) as expected,     |  631 harsh ecosystems (notably with a significant ice cover) being suit- able for fewer species. it seems that although ecosystem harshness affected the community structure, functional diversity remained unchanged. our results show that in the context of french reservoirs, func- tional diversity metrics based on fish communities allow assessing the impacts of anthropogenic stressors that were not detected by taxo- nomic diversity. the tested models had overall medium to low explan- atory power with adjusted coefficients of determination (r2) below .45. the high heterogeneity of our data set may explain, at least partly, the low sensitivity of taxonomic diversity metrics and the weakness of the coefficients of determination. another point worth of discussion concerning the lack of power of our results is the ability of morpho- logical traits to detect environmental alterations and eutrophication notably. although their efficiency has been shown (villéger et al., 2010), some categorical traits might respond more directly and bring more straightforward results. indeed, diet guilds such as omnivorous or invertivorous, reproductive guilds relying on macrophytes such as phytophilic species and other sensitive guilds such as tolerance to pol- lution have been shown to respond to eutrophication in lentic and lotic ecosystems (argillier et al., 2013; launois et al., 2011; pont et al., 2007). our results do not allow an immediate use of functional diver- sity metrics in bioindication although we bring encouraging results in this way. indeed, we show that (i) despite their anthropogenic origin, the functional structure of fish communities in reservoirs responds to the environment and can be reliably used to monitor impacts on these ecosystems, and (ii) the sensitivity of functional diversity metrics to biotic stressors is robust. we also stress the importance of interacting effects of studied stressors in french reservoirs, emphasising the fact that analysing eutrophication and non- native species independently in reservoirs may bring misleading results. acknowledgements we thank cédric lanoiselée for his help with trait measurements and maxime logez and anthony maire for valuable discussions and help. we also thank two anonymous referees and associate editor dr. bernard hugueny for their comments on the manuscript. this work is part of the mars project (managing aquatic ecosystems and water resources under multiple stress) funded under the 7th eu framework programme, theme 6 (environment including climate change), contract no.: 603378 (http://www.mars-project.eu). references appelberg, m., bergquist, b., & degerman, e.
