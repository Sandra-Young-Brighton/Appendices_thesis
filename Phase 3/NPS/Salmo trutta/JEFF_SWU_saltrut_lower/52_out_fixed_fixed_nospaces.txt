no light-induced difference in ingestion of small prey was found. foraging 0+ perch responded to indirect nonspeciﬁc cues of predation risk by reduction of intake of large prey, which are costly in terms of handling time. this allows ﬁsh to be more vigilant without ceasing their foraging activity even in potentially dangerous situations. in the lake, young perch are most vulnerable to abundant piscivorous ﬁsh and birds during the day; in twilight perch can afford a more time-consuming foraging activity. j. wanzenbo¨ck1, v. n. mikheev2, a. f. pasternak3 1institute for limnology, austrian academy of sciences, mondsee, austria, 2a.n. severtsov institute of ecology and evolution, russian academy of sciences, moscow, russia, 3p.p. shirshov institute of oceanology, russian academy of sciences, moscow, russia key words: light intensity;

wright & o’brien 1984; lazzaro 1987; hughes 1997). preda- tion risk is among the most powerful biotic factors that inﬂuence foraging (cerri & fraser 1983; lima & dill 1990). risk of being eaten, while foraging may inﬂuence uptake rate (fraser & huntingford 1986; fraser & gilliam 1987) and prey size selection, causing a forager to broaden its diet or even to prefer safer but less proﬁtable prey (godin 1990; sih 1993) and/or foraging habitats (smith 1997). intake rate, on the one hand, and handling time, on the other, depend to a large extent on prey size (werner 1974; stephens & krebs 1986; wanzenbo¨ck 1995). larger prey size correlates with longer handling time (werner 1974; scott 1987; prejs et al. 1990). consumption of larger prey conﬂicts more with vigilance and under predator- induced cues is replaced with smaller prey, requiring shorter handling time (godin 1990). because searching for food and handling prey reduce vigilance, young ﬁshes are predominantly susceptible to predation while foraging. so, they have to make a choice balancing feeding and safety requirements. in general, it is less risky and energet- ically costly to respond to the predator’s appearance earlier (preattack) than later in the predation sequence (endler 1986, 1991). nevertheless, too cautious for- aging behaviour would deprive ﬁsh of necessary food. it is assumed that the early recognition of a potentially 118 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00139.x hazardous situation is advantageous for a consumer that cannot cease feeding for a long period (like 0+ planktivorous ﬁsh) but can choose a less risky way of foraging. young-of-the-year (yoy) perch, perca ﬂuviatilis, are common planktivores of temperate lakes that actively move through their habitat searching for more proﬁtable places and considerably change their feed- ing activity on a diurnal basis. new microhabitats could be both proﬁtable for foraging and potentially dangerous, that causes elevated exploratory activity and vigilance of ﬁsh. these energy and time-consu- ming behaviours are in conﬂict with foraging. yoy perch is generally described as daylight forager (ali et al. 1977; maclean & magnuson 1977; bergman 1988), but many visual predators such as piscivorous ﬁsh and birds are most active also during the daytime (manteifel et al. 1965; hessen et al. 1986; vollestad et al. 1986; goldspink 1990; winﬁeld 1990; eklo¨v 1992; eklo¨v & diehl 1994). therefore, we assumed that high illumination and novelty of surroundings are indirect threatening factors for foraging yoy perch, and we hypothesised that these factors lead to modiﬁcations of 0+ perch foraging behaviour in a similar manner as direct stimuli from a predator. while effects of direct cues of predation threat (mainly visual and olfactory stimuli) have received a lot of attention during recent decades (milinski 1990, 1993), indirect cues possibly connected to predation threat have rarely been studied (godin 1997). speciﬁc questions were: (i) how do prey size selection and intake rate of yoy perch change with habituation to a novel experimental situation? (ii) are prey size selection and intake rate of yoy perch different under day and twilight illumination? (iii) how are habituation-related foraging traits inﬂuenced by illumination, i.e., is there any interaction between the two? material and methods predators and prey perch juveniles were obtained from egg strands collected from lake wallersee (austria). a mass culture was kept in ﬂow-through tanks at 20 ± 1 °c and a dark–light regime that imitated the seasonal changes of illumination. the ﬁsh were raised on a diet of living brine shrimp nauplii (artemia sp.), lake zooplankton and daphnia magna. fish used in the experiments of 31.1 ± 3.0 mm (mean ± sd) and a mean dry weight of 91.4 ± 26.9 mg. a dense culture of d. magna was maintained in plastic basins on a mixture of green algae and yeast. two prey sizes were produced by sieving; large prey with a mean body length (±sd) a mean standard had length modiﬁcation of 0+ perch foraging behaviour of 2.9 ± 0.3 mm and a mean body width of 2.0 ± 0.2 mm, and small prey with a mean body length of 1.2 ± 0.2 mm and a mean body width of 0.7 ± 0.1 mm. size distributions of the two classes did not overlap, and large and small prey were easy to discriminate visually. dry weight of d. magna was regression equation dw ¼ calculated from the 8.47 · l2.6 (j. wanzenbo¨ck, unpublished data). thus, large prey had an average body weight of 132.3 lg; small prey weight was 14.8 lg. gape width (gw) of perch juveniles was calculated with the equation gw ¼ )0.176 + 0.099 sl, where sl is the standard length in mm (kurmayer & wanzenbo¨ck 1996) and equalled 2.91 ± 0.30 mm (mean ± sd). the relative size (the ratio of prey width to mouth gape of the predator) of large prey (0.7) was slightly higher than optimal (werner 1974; kislalioglu & gibson 1976). handling of a prey that large takes several times (six times) longer than handling small prey (relative size 0.25). handling time (ht, s) was equation ht ¼ calculated 1 + 0.0229 exp 8.061 ps/ms, where ps/ms is prey size/mouth size ratio (werner 1974). it was 7.5 s per large prey and 1.2 s per small one. according the to experimental procedures and treatments experiments were carried out at the institute for limnology, mondsee, austria in 2001. they were run in glass aquaria of 30 · 20 · 20 cm ﬁlled with 10 l of ﬁltered lake water at 20 ± 1 °c. thirty ﬁsh randomly chosen from the ﬂow-through holding tank were distributed in groups of three among 10 aquaria where they were kept for ﬁve successive days of experi- ments; the same was done with another group of 30 ﬁsh 1 day later. fish were tested in groups of three instead of individually, because ﬁsh in groups calmed down and started feeding much earlier, than isolated individuals (our pilot observations). overhead lighting was provided by two 36-w ﬂuorescent tubes on a 16:8 h light:dark regime. aquaria were permanently aerated except the short periods of the feeding tests. fish were fed d. magna ad libitum during 1 h every day. consumption of large and small prey was estimated in 15-min trials with 100 large and 200 small daphnia per aquarium. prior to the experimental treatment, ﬁsh were prestarved for 20 h. according to our pilot observations, consumption rate of hungry yoy perch was highest during the ﬁrst 15 min. after 15-min feeding, ﬁsh were removed with a hand net and transferred temporarily to another aquarium. the remaining d. magna were collected with a sieve of 0.2-mm mesh and counted under a dissecting micro- scope. fish were returned into the same aquaria reﬁlled with fresh water. one group of ﬁsh was tested 119 wanzenbo¨ck et al. at 400 lx (daylight), another at 2 lx (twilight) meas- ured at the surface of the water. the experiment started 1 day after the ﬁsh had been transferred from the holding tank into the experimental aquaria. this trial was repeated on days 3 and 5. all experiments were run between 12.00 and 16.00 hours. novelty of surroundings that the ﬁsh faced upon transfer from the holding tank to the test aquaria included smaller size aquaria without a ﬂow, much lower number of conspeciﬁcs around, and regular handling. data analysis the number of consumed prey items was assessed as a difference between introduced prey items and those remaining after a feeding trial. large and small d. magna were counted separately. in trials without ﬁsh, no losses, either of large or small prey, caused by manipulations and sieving were found. original data were tested for normality and homogeneity of vari- ances, and repeated measures two-way anova was applied. tukey test for post hoc multiple comparisons was run. results there was a strong and persistent effect of illumination level on total consumption (tables 1 and 2) that was signiﬁcantly higher at 2 lx than at 400 lx. on the whole, total intake increased in the course of habitu- ation to novel surroundings from day 1 to day 5 (fig. 1, table 1). however, at high light, there was a signiﬁcant difference between days 1 and 5, while at the low light level, although the trend persisted, differences were insigniﬁcant (table 2). total food intake was primarily related to con- sumption of large daphnia. they always comprised more than 60% of biomass ingested. a gradual large daphnia was increase in consumption of observed on successive daily feeding trials from levels days 1 to 5, both at 2 and 400 lx light table 1. inﬂuence of illumination (high, 400 lx and low, 2 lx) and habitu- ation to novel surroundings (consecutive days 1, 3, 5) on consumption of daphnia magna by perch. prey consumed source of variation d.f. ms f p large daphnia small daphnia small + large daphnia light level (ll) 1 days of experiment (de) 2 ll · de 2 light level (ll) 1 days of experiment (de) 2 ll · de 2 light level (ll) 1 days of experiment (de) 2 ll · de 2 results of two-way repeated measures anova. 120 298 11 0.452 0.023 0.001 58,541 14.181 12,943 19.660 <0.001 0.640 0.882 3084 22.642 <0.001 0.204 226 0.005 0.007 0.747 1.661 56,948 10.157 5.718 0.294 3442 177 (fig. 2, tables 1 and 2). there was a pronounced effect of illumination level on consumption of large daphnia (tables 1 and 2) which was always signiﬁcantly higher at 2 lx than at 400 lx. maximum share of small prey (37% of the total intake) was observed on the ﬁrst day of experiment under high level of illumination (fig. 2). later on, in the course of habituation to novel surroundings, it decreased to 9.2% (day 5); at twilight illumination, the share of small prey was always lower and decreased from 30.8% (day 1) to 7.6% (day 5). the illumination level did not inﬂuence consumption of small daphnia during the whole period of habituation (fig. 2, table 2). calculated total time spent handling all prey items (large and small) during the 15-min foraging bout was considerably higher at 2 lx than at 400 lx: 106–112 and 65–78 s, respectively (table 3). this difference was even more pronounced when only large prey were taken into account: 74–101 s at 2 lx and 36–69 s at 400 lx (table 3). illumination level did not inﬂuence the time the ﬁsh spent handling small d. magna (table 3). with habituation to novel surroundings, perch spent more time on handling large prey, especially in twilight (table 3). discussion our study showed that both factors, high illumination level and novelty of surroundings, which can be associated with the risk of predation for foraging 0+ perch, signiﬁcantly reduce ﬁsh intake rate. this reduction was completely caused by decreased con- sumption of large prey. consumption of small prey was not affected by the level of illumination, but noticeably decreased with habituation to novel sur- roundings. handling time increases exponentially with relative prey size (ratio of prey width to mouth gape of the predator) (werner 1974; kislalioglu & gibson 1976). the relative size of large prey in our experiments (0.7) was somewhat higher than optimal (0.6) for particu- late-feeding ﬁsh of the size similar to that we tested (werner 1974; scott 1987; prejs et al. 1990). small prey (relative size 0.25) was considerably less than that of optimal size. handling smaller daphnia, 0+ perch spent six times less time than for large prey. doing this, ﬁsh were considerably reducing energy gain, but could be more vigilant at the same time. although our handling times were calculated using a formula developed for centrarchids, we believe that they reﬂect handling times of perch fairly well as the relationship between handling time and prey size– mouth size ratio is comparable across several species of ﬁsh and prey (werner 1974; scott 1987; prejs et al. 1990). table 2. inﬂuence of light level (ll: high, 400 lx and low, 2 lx) and habituation to novel surround- ings (days 1, 3, 5) on consumption of daphnia magna by perch. modiﬁcation of 0+ perch foraging behaviour prey consumed factor level q p large daphnia days of experiment within high light days of experiment within low light ll within day 1 ll within day 3 ll within day 5 days of experiment within high light days of experiment within low light ll within day 1 ll within day 3 ll within day 5 days of experiment within high light days of experiment within low light small daphnia large + small daphnia ll within day 1 ll within day 3 ll within day 5 pairwise multiple comparisons (tukey test). 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 low vs. high low vs. high low vs. high 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 low vs. high low vs. high low vs. high 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 5 vs. 1 5 vs. 3 3 vs. 1 low vs. high low vs. high low vs. high 6.857 3.300 3.558 5.568 1.444 4.125 4.782 5.124 4.006 6.551 4.578 1.973 6.893 1.606 5.287 0.724 1.709 0.474 4.055 1.273 2.782 2.545 0.746 1.799 4.517 4.011 3.740 <0.001 0.064 0.043 0.001 0.569 0.016 0.002 0.001 0.008 <0.001 0.007 0.354 <0.001 0.499 0.002 0.612 0.234 0.740 0.019 0.644 0.135 0.184 0.859 0.420 0.004 0.009 0.014  i ) 1 – n m 5 1 1 – . d n i g µ ( e t a r e k a t n i 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 1 3 days 5 fig. 1. inﬂuence of illumination, 2 lx (black bars) and 400 lx (open bars) and habituation (consecutive daily trials) on total intake rate of young-of-the-year (yoy) perch. mean and se values are shown. two aspects of diurnal changes of light intensity inﬂuencing foraging behaviour of ﬁsh are usually considered as a: (i) physical property limiting ﬁsh capacity to detect and discriminate prey (confer et al. 1978; mills et al. 1986; guthrie & muntz 1993); and factor signalling diurnal changes in foraging (ii) conditions and predation threat (hall et al. 1979; clark & levy 1988). although it was suggested that reduced light level (from several hundred to 2 lx) impaired the ability of yoy yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens) to ﬁnd small prey (mills et al. 1986), no decrease in consumption of small daphnia at low illumination compared with high illumination was noted in our experiments. also a change of relative availability of small and large prey with light reduction could not be derived from the data on several planktivorous ﬁsh (confer et al. 1978). minimum visual threshold for yoy perch was found to be 0.062 lx (guma’a 1978). it means that there was no physical limitation to detection of small prey. this leaves us with the second aspect, predation threat, as prey density was the same. according to the ‘anti- predator window’ model (clark & levy 1988), planktivorous juvenile sockeye salmon fed most intensively during twilight, avoiding feeding at day- light this behaviour resulted in lower intake and growth rates, but higher survival. illumination; like many planktivorous ﬁshes, which are predom- inantly visual foragers, yoy perch do not feed at night (ali et al. 1977; spanovskaya & grigorash 1977; guma’a 1978). however, their day feeding is consid- erably lower than their feeding at dusk and dawn (maclean & magnuson 1977; spanovskaya & grigorash 1977; post & mcqueen 1988). in the daytime, yoy perch were observed to be rather inactive and form large schools; at dusk, swimming activity increased and they fed most intensively on zooplankton (wang & eckmann 1994). numerous visual piscivorous ﬁsh and birds are often active in temperate lakes during daytime (manteifel et al. 1965;

winﬁeld 1990; eklo¨v 1992; eklo¨v & diehl 1994). thus, an increased risk of predation could cause the decrease in the activity, including foraging, of perch juveniles during the day, and the high level of illumination might be an environmental cue associated with the risk. fish are able to judge the level of risk and adjust their behaviour accordingly (dill & fraser 1984). feeding in our laboratory experiments was signiﬁcantly lower at daylight twilight, than at 122 illumination, impacts. high resembling diurnal changes under natural conditions. fish are capable of retaining the inherited antipredator behaviour (seghers 1974; breden et al. 1987). beha- vioural responses to environmental cues associated with predation risk could persist in naı¨ve laboratory- reared ﬁsh that have never experienced any predator- induced signalling increased risk, makes ﬁsh more vigilant and trade foraging intensity against safety. time spent handling all prey items (large and small) during the 15-min foraging bout was considerably higher at 2 lx than at 400 lx (table 3). this difference was even more pronounced when only large prey was taken into account (table 3). the risk of predation grows exponentially with an increase of time needed for pursuing and capture of larger prey (dill 1983). this could explain the signiﬁcant reduction in consumption of large but not small prey in the light. this response to high illumination did not change in the course of the experiment, suggesting that, high illumination is always considered by ﬁsh as a sign of a potentially dangerous situation. another stressing factor, novelty of similar behavioural response. with habituation to novel surroundings, perch could afford spending more time on handling large prey, especially in the dark (table 3), perceiving the situation as more familiar and safe. this means that exploratory behaviour and vigilance could be reduced, and more time could be invested in alternative activities, in this case, foraging. surroundings, induced a there could be three explanations for the observed large and concurrent increase in consumption of decrease of small daphnia during the series of daily trials. first, ﬁsh grew during the experiments, increas- ing weight, gape width, food demands and ability to process large prey. second, ﬁsh could learn how to improve the handling process, i.e., shorten handling time for a given prey (croy & hughes 1990; hughes et al. 1992). third, habituation to novel surroundings could make vigilance and exploration tasks easier, thus allowing foraging upon larger, more risky, prey. body weight and gape width of perch could have increased during the course of the experiment by a factor of 1.14 and 1.04, respectively, as was calculated using the data on growth of 0+ perch of similar size (mehner et al. 1998). however, increase in total intake and the share of large daphnia was much higher (1.33 and 1.46, respectively). thus, most of the observed changes could not be attributed to ﬁsh growth. it is hardly possible experiments improved handling skills like naı¨ve ﬁfteen-spine sticklebacks fed with amphipods (croy & hughes 1990), because the perch were preadapted to daphnia of various sizes for more than a week prior to the tests. the third hypothesis, emphasising a trade-off between foraging and other activities, seems more plausible. that perch in our this response implies that, the main novel ﬁnding of this study is that not only direct predator induced cues (visual, olfactory, hydro- mechanical), but also indirect cues, associated with potentially dangerous situations, can modify prey size selectivity and intake rate in juvenile ﬁsh. the adaptive signiﬁcance of losing immediate energy proﬁt by switching to smaller prey, ﬁsh can afford more vigilance, gaining in safety and survival. similarly to antipredator responses to direct threat of predation (seghers 1974; breden et al. 1987; magurran 1993), responses to nonspeciﬁc factors could be ﬂexible and depend on the predation pressure previously experienced by a population. perch juveniles originating from waters with low abundance of visual predators could be expected to be less cautious, actively feeding on large prey at daylight. acknowledgements this study was supported by the austrian academy of sciences (exchange programme with the russian academy of sciences), the russian foundation for basic research (projects 02-04- 48480 and 03-04-20010 to v. mikheev and 01-04-48701 and 04-04-48128 to a. pasternak) and the austrian academic exchange service (projects i.22/2001 and i.28/04). the help of phil hickley in shaping the english style of this paper is greatly acknowledged. references ali, m.a., ryder, r.a. & anctil, m. 1977. photoreceptors and visual pigments as related to behavioral responses and preferred habitats of perches (perca spp.) and pikeperches (stizostedion spp.). journal of the fisheries research board of canada 34: 1475–1480. bergman, e. 1988. foraging abilities and niche breadths of two percids, perca ﬂuviatilis and gymnocephalus cernua, under different environmental conditions. journal of animal ecol- ogy 57: 443–453. breden, f., scott, m. & michel, e. 1987. genetic differentiation for anti-predator behaviour in the trinidad guppy, poecillia reticulata. animal behaviour 35: 618–620. cerri, r.d. & fraser, d.f. 1983. predation and risk in foraging minnows: balancing conﬂicting demands. american natur- alist 121: 552–561. clark, c.w. & levy, d.a. 1988. diel vertical migrations by juvenile sockeye salmon and the antipredator window. american naturalist 131: 271–290. confer, j.l., howick, g.l., corzette, m.h., kramer, s.l., fitzgibbon, s. & landesberg, r. 1978. visual predation by planktivores. oikos 31: 27–37. croy, m.i. & hughes, r.n. 1990. the inﬂuence of hunger on feeding behaviour and on the acquisition of learned foraging skills by the ﬁfteenspined stickleback, spinachia spinachia l. animal behaviour 41: 161–170. dill, l.m. 1983. adaptive ﬂexibility in the foraging behavior of ﬁshes. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 40: 398–408. modiﬁcation of 0+ perch foraging behaviour dill, l.m. & fraser, a.h.g. 1984. risk of predation and the feeding behavior of juvenile coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch). behavioural ecology and sociobiology 16: 65– 71. eklo¨v, p. 1992. group foraging versus solitary foraging efﬁciency in piscivorous predators: the perch, perca ﬂuvia- tilis, and pike, esox lucius, patterns. animal behaviour 44: 313–326. eklo¨v, p. & diehl, s. 1994. piscivore efﬁciency and refuging prey: the importance of predator search mode. oecologia 98: 344–353. endler, j.a. 1986. defense against predators. in: feder, m.e. & lauder, g.v., eds. predator–prey relationships. chicago, il: university of chicago press, pp. 109–134. endler, j.a. 1991. interactions between predators and prey. in: krebs, j.r. & davies, n.b., eds. behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach, 3rd edn. oxford: blackwell scientiﬁc publications, pp. 169–196. fraser, d.f. & gilliam, j.f. 1987. feeding under predation hazard: response of the guppy and hart’s rivulus from sites with contrasting predation hazard. behavioural ecology and sociobiology 21: 203–209. fraser, d.f. & huntingford, f.a. 1986. feeding and avoiding the prey. the behavioral predation hazard: ethology 73: 56–68. response of godin, j.g.j. 1990. diet selection under the risk of predation. in: hughes, r.n., ed. behavioural mechanisms of food selection. nato asi series v. g20. berlin: springer-verlag, pp. 797–819. godin, j.g.j.
