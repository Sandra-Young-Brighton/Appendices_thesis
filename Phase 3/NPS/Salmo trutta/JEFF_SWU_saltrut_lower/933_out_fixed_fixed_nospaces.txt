taste buds located inside the mouth and on the external body surface, catﬁshes are excellent subjects to investigate nonconsumptive predator effects. juvenile channel catﬁsh ictalurus punctatus are often eaten by largemouth bass micropterus salmoides, and we tested the hypothesis that largemouth bass fed catﬁsh would adversely affect foraging and growth in channel catﬁsh. groups of catﬁsh were placed in tanks partitioned by a mesh screen: experimental tanks had a largemouth bass on the other half of the tank, and control tanks had an empty chamber. experimental catﬁsh exhibited a long-term decrease in spontaneous motion, feeding and growth. feeding catﬁsh to the bass caused the experimental catﬁsh to freeze after a multi-second latency suggesting transport of an alarm cue. thus, there were long-term effects from the continuous presence of the bass and additional short-term cues from the bass consuming a catﬁsh. m. l. fine1, m. s. mayo1, s. h. newton2, e. n. sismour2 1department of

introduction many organisms have the ability to assess predation risk (lima & dill 1990; bro¨nmark & hanssen 2000; wisenden 2000) and alter their morphology, growth, physiology and behaviour accordingly (bro¨nmark & miner 1992; agrawal 2001; dewitt & scheiner 2004; preisser et al. 2005; creel et al. 2007), i.e., noncon- sumptive predator effects. chemical signals elicit anti- predator responses in a wide variety of prey, including algae (lass & spaak 2003; yasumoto et al. 2005), invertebrates (boeing et al. 2006) and vertebrates (schoeppner & relyea 2005; brown & chivers 2006). given their exceptional specialisations for olfaction (caprio and finger 2003), taste (kapoor & finger 2003; valentincˇicˇ 2004) and electrosenses (new 1999), catﬁshes are ideal models for examining nonconsumptive effects of sensory cues from preda- tors. in addition to sensory cues that may be used to detect prey, catﬁshes have evolved stout pectoral spines as an anti-predator adaptation (fine & ladich 2003; bosher et al. 2006; fine et al. in press). pectoral spines in channel catﬁsh ictalurus punctatus can be bound and locked in an abducted position (fine et al. 1997), which hinders consumption and may injure gape-limited predators (bosher et al. 2006). ridges on the dorsal process of the spine base can be rubbed against the pectoral girdle to produce stridulation sounds (fine et al. 1997; vance 2000). stridulatory pectoral movements have been witnessed in channel catﬁsh held in the mouth of a largemouth bass micropterus (bosher et al. 2006). an experimental test with largemouth bass demonstrated that pectoral spines do not prevent attack, but they dramatically increase survival; intact channel catﬁsh were three times as likely as clipped ones to survive an hour session with a largemouth bass (bosher et al. 2006). juvenile channel catﬁsh are commonly eaten by largemouth bass and other predators, and a 900 g largemouth bass can consume ﬁngerlings up to 20 cm in fork length (krummrich & heidinger 1973). salmoides we are unaware of studies examining any response of juvenile channel catﬁsh to predation risk. in a tank study, we tested the hypothesis that largemouth bass who fed on channel catﬁsh would suppress foraging 114 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00466.x and growth of juvenile channel catﬁsh. we attempted to maximise the opportunity for eliciting noncon- sumptive effects by exposing the feeder catﬁsh to multiple potential stimuli (visual, vibratory, chemical and electrical) from largemouth bass and consumed- feeder catﬁsh. sorting out cue-speciﬁc responses will be the subject of future work. materials and methods juvenile channel catﬁsh obtained from aquaculture facilities of virginia state university were measured for total length (lt) in mm and weighed to 0.1 g at the beginning and termination of the experiment. large- mouth bass m. salmoides were obtained by hook and line from a small impoundment at the rice center of virginia commonwealth university (charles city county, virginia) (iacuc permit number ad20042), and work was carried out using methods approved by the virginia commonwealth animal care and use committee (am10047). largemouth bass lt (29, 37, 42 and 43 cm) was measured at the termination of the experiment to reduce stress on the ﬁsh. fish were maintained in eight 300-l ﬁbreglass (irregularly shaped horse troughs) tanks at 23 °c under a 14:10 ld cycle. a black polyethylene plastic mesh barrier (6.5 mm square openings) was erected across the centre of each tank separating them into halves, and a clay ﬂowerpot was added to the catﬁsh side for shelter. each tank had an external ﬁlter (no charcoal) with the intake on the predator side and the outﬂow on the catﬁsh side so that chemical signals would be rapidly transmitted to the catﬁsh. tank bottoms were siphoned at least weekly preceding a water change. ten channel catﬁsh were acclimated in the right half of each tank for 1 week, after which a largemouth bass was added to four of the tanks. the other four tanks, that held catﬁsh but no bass, served as controls. the positions of experimental and control tanks were evenly staggered so that external inﬂuences would be balanced, and behavioural observations were alter- nated between experimental and control tanks. large- mouth bass were fed twice a week with a channel catﬁsh from the same stock as the experimental catﬁsh. feeder catﬁsh were overdosed with ms222, and their spinal cords were severed. pectoral spines were clipped to prevent bass from being injured, which can deter feeding (bosher et al. 2006). the experiment was conducted for 13 weeks (7 september–14 decem- ber 2007). catﬁsh were fed to satiation 5 days per week using a standard ﬂoating-pellet feed. pellets were counted and added in lots to facilitate monitoring. time to eat the ﬁrst 10 pellets was measured, and the total number of pellets consumed was counted. pellets were added largemouth bass predators and channel catﬁsh until none was consumed after 30 s, and uneaten pellets were removed. we developed a nonparametric four-point scale to quantify motion of channel catﬁsh: 0 – no movement, 1 – small amplitude opercular movement and tail ﬂuttering but no body movement by any catﬁsh, 2 – less than half of the individuals exhibited body movement and 3 – over half of the individuals exhibited body movement. during a trial, catﬁsh motion was quantiﬁed, during a brief observation, once in control tanks and twice in experimental tanks, i.e., both before and after feeding sacriﬁced catﬁsh to the largemouth bass. ingestion of a feeder catﬁsh by a bass caused experimental catﬁsh to cease moving, and the latency, measured from the moment of catﬁsh ingestion, and duration of the freezing response were measured and averaged for each tank. total length (lt) and weight of channel catﬁsh at the beginning and end of the experiment were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by tukey’s multiple range test. lt and weight in the four control and four experimental tanks were averaged so that each tank was treated as a single unit for analysis (n = 4 per treatment). likewise, behavioural data across tanks were similarly averaged with each tank treated as an n of 1. data were compared between experimental and control tanks using a t-test (n = 4 per treatment). medians from the nonparametric scale for movement were compared with a mann–whitney u-test. the bass and six of the catﬁsh in one experimental tank died because of an air stone malfunction. we replaced the bass and continued the experiment with the four remaining catﬁsh. data from this tank were not used for measurements of pellet consumption. results growth initially, channel catﬁsh ranged from 10.0 to 16.0 cm in lt (mean ± 1 se: 12.82 ± 1.70) and 8.1–34.3 g in weight (17.06 ± 0.66 g). there were no signiﬁcant differences between tanks for initial lt or weight (p > 0.05). channel catﬁsh increased in length (anova: f3,12 = 35.09, p < 0.0001) and weight (f3,12 = 39.86, p < 0.0001) during the experiment (fig. 1). final lt was signiﬁcantly smaller in tanks with experimental ﬁsh (15.07 ± 0.63 cm) versus con- trol ﬁsh (16.67 ± 0.88 cm) (tukey test: p < 0.05). further, there was no overlap in mean lt between experimental ﬁsh (14.38–16.06 cm) and control ﬁsh (16.30–17.59 cm). similarly, experimental ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly lighter (25.88 ± 3.29 g) than control ﬁsh (39.02 ± 7.70 g) (p < 0.001), and as before, there was no overlap in tank means between

was signiﬁcant (u = 16, p = 0.0133). this response was transitory however; the latency for the freezing response was 24.4 ± 7.5 s, and it lasted for 15.0 ± 2.6 s (fig. 4). discussion we attempted to maximise our chances of success in this initial study by exposing catﬁsh to continuous bass odour and the chemical stimuli resulting from bass eating catﬁsh as well as to other potential visual, mechanical and electrical cues emanating from the bass. considerable work remains to tease out the particular sensory cues involved and the effects of learning. predator–prey experiments of this type commonly employ larger sample sizes. our replicates were limited by the availability of 300-l tanks and our desire to sacriﬁce the minimum number of catﬁsh necessary to obtain signiﬁcant results. this experiment utilised eight large tanks with individual external ﬁlters and required 80 catﬁsh (plus additional ones to feed the bass for 3 months). nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate robust nonconsumptive effects of largemouth bass predators on channel catﬁsh growth and behaviour. furthermore, the lack of overlap between tank means for lt and weight in experimental and control treatments provides a powerful result without further statistical analysis (yoccuz 1991), and r2 values of 0.9 from anova indicate strong effects. we did not use a nonpredatory ﬁsh as the control because results would be speciﬁc to that control species and we would still not have demonstrated that our results generalise to other nonpredatory species. differences between control and experimental tanks indicate that catﬁsh sensed the bass in the adjacent half of the tank, and this awareness could be mediated through visual (collin 2003; valentincˇicˇ 2004), elec- trical (new 1999), vibratory (pohlman et al. 2004) or ) s ( e m t i 30 20 10 0 latency duration fig. 4. latency and duration in seconds of channel catﬁsh freezing response after a feeder catﬁsh was eaten by a largemouth bass. largemouth bass predators and channel catﬁsh chemical cues. types of cues from the bass can be separated by whether they cause immediate or delayed responses by the catﬁsh. visual, electrical and vibra- tory cues would be expected to have short latencies, whereas chemical cues, requiring diffusion of the odourants or tastants, would require longer latencies. the mesh used to separate the tanks is wide enough to permit reasonable human visibility in air. we noted that the bass, a visually oriented predator, would orient and swim towards a catﬁsh that ventured close to the barrier. catﬁsh, however, did not appear to react to a bass that moved close to the barrier or when bass charged and attacked a feeder catﬁsh. furthermore, catﬁsh exhibited latencies greater than 20 s for the freezing response after the bass fed. although these observations need to be conﬁrmed with exclusive presentation of chemical stimuli, they suggest that the catﬁsh were relying on chemical cues and not vision, mechano- or electroreception to detect the bass or an injured catﬁsh. the almost continuous movement of control channel catﬁsh was severely suppressed in the experimental tanks. although experimental catﬁsh were typically stationary, they did exhibit tail ﬂutter- ing. this posture may be a channel catﬁsh version of ﬁn ﬂicking seen in several other teleosts exposed to predators (lawrence & smith 1989; brown et al. 1999; wisenden & chivers 2006), and small ampli- tude tail movements allow the ﬁsh to remain cryptic while causing small local movements of water that may improve access to chemical information (wisen- den & chivers 2006). reduced catﬁsh movement indicates long-term (tonic) effects associated with the largemouth bass. the response of channel catﬁsh to predator feeding can be divided into a phasic component represented by the freezing response and a tonic component associ- ated with the longer-term release of soluble digestive cues that catﬁsh learn to associate with predation (valentincˇicˇ & caprio 1994; mirza & chivers 2003; darwish et al. 2005). consumption of a catﬁsh by the bass appears to release an alarm cue as demonstrated by the delayed freezing response. similarly, channel catﬁsh freeze after attack and release by largemouth bass (bosher et al. 2006), thereby reducing attacks compared to those evoked by a swimming ﬁsh. further, individual channel catﬁsh and brown bull- heads ameiurus nebulosus freeze when an object representing a potential predator is visible above their tank (valentincˇicˇ & caprio 1994; valentincˇicˇ 2004). catﬁsh were reticent to eat in the presence of a bass and consumed fewer pellets at a slower rate than controls. the decreased feeding resulted in lower gains in lt and weight. decreased feeding and growth rate may compound the problem of stocking catﬁsh grown in aquaculture ponds into water bodies with predators (katano et al. 2005). catﬁsh have a greater likelihood 117 fine et al. of being eaten until they grow to a size less vulnerable to predation (krummrich & heidinger 1973). this study suggests that the presence of predators may prolong this vulnerable period. catﬁshes are generally nocturnal and prefer low- light habitats and generally have small eyes that are not well developed for high spatial resolution although channel catﬁsh have larger eyes and better vision than many catﬁsh species (collin 2003). apparently, adap- tation to low-light bottom habitats (arnott et al. 1974; hauser 1976; sillman et al. 1993) has been selected for decreased use of vision and increased development of chemical and other senses. these senses have been augmented by pectoral armament to avoid predation. a cost of this strategy appears to be decreased foraging and growth in the presence of a predator. many factors contribute to ﬁsh growth, and classic studies on the interactions of bluegill sunﬁsh lepomis macrochirus with largemouth bass demonstrate that bluegills experience a trade-off between growth in optimal pelagic habitats and increased predation (werner et al. 1983; werner & hall 1988). small bluegills are relegated to inferior littoral habitats and therefore grow more slowly. in addition to potential indirect effects on growth through habitat selection, the current study demonstrates that a predator can elicit a direct behavioural response that limits ﬁsh growth through decreased foraging. acknowledgements we thank d’arcy mays, chairman of the department of statistics at vcu, for statistical advice and james vonesh for discussions and for reviewing the manuscript.
