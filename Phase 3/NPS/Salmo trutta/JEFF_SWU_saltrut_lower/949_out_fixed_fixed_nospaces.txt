(1998) showed the preponderance of longitudinal variables (ele- vation and temperature) and their correlates (rainfall) in structuring ﬁsh communities from portuguese reservoirs. similar observations were made earlier on riverine systems (huet 1949; illies & botosaneanu 1963). the river continuum concept (vannote et al. 1980) provides an energy-based framework to the biota distribution. typically, the ﬁsh species richness increases downstream the river course (oberdorff et al. 1993), resulting in a combination of zonation and downstream addition of species (rahel & hubert 1991). these similarities suggest that the processes governing reservoir ﬁsh communities could be midway between those occurring in lakes, as a result of an isolation limiting immigra- tion possibilities (magnuson et al. 1998) and the riverine continuity. materials and methods the dataset the dataset pools the information collected over 30 years for the needs of case studies. the sources are fully listed in pronier (2000). most of the 43 study sites are located in south-eastern france (fig. 1), where the landscape is favorable to hydroelectric power generation. the main char- acteristics of these artiﬁcial lakes are summarized in table 1. they represent a variety of environ- mental conditions (table 2). ichtyological data were collected during either impoundment draining for dam investigation or gillnetting surveys. these surveys were carried out using two different sampling schemes. the ﬁrst one is mostly empirical, relying on the setting of horizontal gillnet series overnight with knot- to-knot mesh sizes ranging from 10 to 60 mm in geometrical progression. the sampling sites are 124 fig. 1. location of the 43 study sites on the french hydro- graphic network. the site numbers refer to table 1. chosen so that the whole water column may be prospected and to cover most of the habitats diversity. the second methodology uses vertical gillnet series in the deep areas, whereas the littoral zone is sampled with multimesh gillnets. the nets are then set for approximately 24 h. these two methods proved to be equally efﬁcient in terms of accuracy on species diversity and show overall similar distributions on the relative abundance of species (irz 1998). the efﬁciency of both gillnet- ting methods was successfully compared with a total census of the standing stock on the occasion of the total draining of la ravie` ge and treignac reservoirs (unpublished data). from the overall 37 species present in the samples, only 22 were common enough to be kept for the analysis. the species that were omitted were either sparse (less than ﬁve occurrences) or not properly sampled by gillnetting. some related species with similar habitat requirement were pooled into a single group (table 3). the numer- ical relative abundance (ra) of each species was calculated as the ratio of the number of indivi- duals per species versus the number of ﬁsh caught during the survey. these abundances were then encoded into three categories corresponding to the absence, low abundance, and high abundance of the species. the cut-off level between low and high abundances is the median relative abun- dance. environmental descriptors were chosen among the parameters available in the database. they were selected from the existing bibliography for their relevance in structuring ﬁsh communities. table1. main characteristics of the studied reser- voirs. each reservoir is coded with three letters cor- responding to its name and a number corresponding to a french administrative

between the highest and lowest exploi- tation levels, were obtained from the dam opera- tors. data processing the relationship between ﬁsh diversity (i.e. the number of species present in each site) and several parameters was ﬁrstly studied by bivariate linear regression. further analyses, apart from the design of a longitudinal gradient index, were only carried out on the 33 reservoirs below 1500 m in altitude because all the ﬁsh populations in mountain lakes result from species introductions. multivariate analysis was carried out using ade-4 software (thioulouse et al. 1997). the faunal and environmental matrices were then analyzed separately. a correspondence ana- lysis (ca) was processed on the species abun- dance indexes in order to identify the structure of the assemblages. the signiﬁcance of between- species associations were then tested using spear- man correlation. the environmental descriptors were submitted to a standardized principal components analysis (pca) to study the correlation between these variables. this analysis of the environmental matrix allows selection of the variables providing 126 the best description of the reservoirs for further analysis. careful selection avoids most of the redundancy between the selected descriptors. a second pca was then processed on the most correlated and redundant variables. the decom- position of the site scores on the ﬁrst two com- ponents of the pca enabled clustering of the sites and thus to summarize these parameters into a single ordinal variable. the relationship between the selected environ- mental descriptors and the ﬁsh communities was investigated by means of canonical correspon- dence analysis (cca) (ter braak 1986). cca is an ordination method that selects a series of linear combinations of environmental variables called canonical axes, which are uncorrelated. this method was designed to relate the dispersion of the species to the environmental descriptors. therefore, it meets the needs of community ecol- ogists and was successfully used in aquatic research (dolman 1990; godinho et al. 2000). it is a nonsymmetric approach that provides an assessment of the faunal inertia that is explained by environmental variables. the main result of the cca is an ordination diagram displaying the pattern of community variation (reservoirs and species) along the environmental variables (ter braak 1987). the method possesses speciﬁc properties to deal with the nonlinear relationship between the taxa abundance and environmental gradients (ter braak 1986). it also performs well in the case of a large set of response variables (prodon & lebreton 1994), even when strongly correlated (ter braak 1987). the limited number of data available led us to retain only four explanatory descriptors chosen in the light of the initial pca. this choice avoids the awkward interpretation of the results when numerous descriptors are corre- lated and ensures a tight restriction of the species scores by the explanatory variables. the stability and signiﬁcance of cca results was assessed by a monte carlo test. this test is nonparametric and is based on random permuta- tions of the lines of the observed faunal matrix. a value of the part of faunal inertia due to the environment is calculated for each combination and allows the validation of the observed explain- ed value with simulated values (efron 1982). results species occurrence the species most frequently observed in the ﬁsh assemblages are, in decreasing order of occur- fish communities in french reservoirs rence, perch, roach, brown_trout, tench, pike and chub (table 3). the dominant species in these assemblages are roach and perch, which indicates their aptness for reservoir environments. some of the more widespread species, such as carp and pike, always remain at a low relative abundance. species diversity the species diversity was plotted against each envir- onmental variable which were previously log- transformed. the correlation was signiﬁcant for the catchment area, reservoir area, distance to the source and mean depth (fig. 2). the best descrip- tors to predict the number of species in a reservoir reservoir area (r2¼ 0.67) and its are watershed area (r2¼ 0.54). no continuous rela- tionship was found between ﬁsh diversity and altitude, though the average diversity signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) between lowland (below differ 1500 m; mean¼ 9.1 species) and mountain sites (mean¼ 1.8 species), which conﬁrms that ﬁsh assemblages follow different patterns below and over the 1500 m elevation threshold. fig. 2. regression scatterplots of species diversity vs. the statistically significant variables. 127 irz et al. fish assemblages below1500 m the ca ﬁrst axis clearly discriminates two types of ﬁsh communities (fig. 3). the ﬁrst one is com- posed of gudgeon, barbel, brown_trout, french nase, chub and rainbow trout. these species are rheophilic and could originate from the riverine assemblages before the construction of the dams. the second group stretched along the second axis can be extended to the 13 other species, among which roach, perch, rudd and pike, i.e. limnophi- lic species are the most frequent. the opposition between tench, carp and pikeperch on one side, bream and bleak on the other side is difﬁcult to interpret at this stage. the between-species correlations conﬁrm these results (table 4). it shows the strong correlation among the ﬁrst group of species, whereas the second group displays fewer signiﬁcant correla- tions. the corresponding species represent an opposition to the ﬁrst group but cannot be inter- preted as a real assemblage due to their low co- occurrence rate. environmental descriptors of lowland sites the pca carried out on the environmental para- meters provides an overview of their organization (fig. 4). the correlation matrix is given in table 5. depth, water level range, perimeter and reservoir area, all site-scale characteristics, appear corre- lated. these parameters represent the size of the lake. the catchment area and the distance to the source are positively correlated, and opposed to the altitude. this opposition summarizes the loca- tion of the sites in the catchment. sldf is simul- taneously correlated to site-scale descriptors and to the location in the catchment. mountain water bodies are close to the river source and typically round-shaped (low sldf), with a small catch- ment area. these parameters increase for down- stream sites. reservoir age is independent from all the other parameters. design of a longitudinal gradient index considering the strong correlations cited pre- viously and the need to limit the number of explanatory variables for the cca, a single long- itudinal gradient index was searched for by means of pca. the input parameters, altitude, distance to the river source, and catchment area, describe the location of the reservoirs on the hydrographic network. the distribution of the 43 sites on the ﬁrst two dimensions of the pca enables the construction 128 fig. 3. position of the fish taxa on the first two axis of the ca carried out on lowland sites (n¼ 33).

variable comprises ﬁve gradient classes, each corresponding to a group of reservoirs on the pca diagram (fig. 5). the ﬁfth category contains all the mountain reservoirs. the distribution of the environmental descrip- tors along the longitudinal gradient index is dis- played in fig. 6. these boxplots reveal the meaning of this index about altitude, distance to source and catchment area that were used to construct it. it also shows the homogeneous fea- tures of high-altitude reservoirs, apart from their age. it also appears that the index is correlated to sldf, perimeter, and reservoir area. the long- itudinal distribution of the sites also corresponds to strong morphological trends that oppose large, complex-shaped lowland reservoirs to small, round-shaped mountain ones. when class 5 sites are not considered, water level range (p¼ 0.22) and reservoir age (p¼ 0.18) are independent from the index, whereas it remains negatively corre- lated to the mean depth (p < 0.001). the occurrence rate of the ﬁsh species can be plotted against the gradient index (fig. 7). this gradient provides a good explanation for the distribution of some species. bleak and bream occur mainly in lowland sites (1–3). on the other hand, rainbow trout and brown_trout are present more in the mountain sites (class 5). some species like barbel, gudgeon, tench and french nase are obviously restricted to intermediate condi- tions. roach and perch, the most widespread species in the reservoirs, are present in almost all the sites with the exception of mountain water bodies. ordination of fish communities restricted by environmental descriptors only four variables were kept for the cca. the longitudinal gradient index is the single large- scale input parameter, whereas mean depth, water level range and reservoir age characterize the water body itself. these descriptors were chosen to remove most of the redundancy in the data as well as to limit the number of explanatory vari- ables. a monte carlo test (p < 0.001, 1000 permuta- tions) proves the signiﬁcance of the analysis. it reveals that the four descriptors explain 20% of the variability within the ﬁsh assemblages (table 6). the abundance of four species is well explained by the descriptors. among these, bar- bel, french nase, and pikeperch are segregated along the ﬁrst axis of the cca biplot (fig. 8). this axis accounts for 47% of the explained variability and can be interpreted by reservoir depth. the 129 . l e v e l . 1 0 0 e h t t a t n a c i f i n g s s i i l n o i t a e r r o c . l e v e l . 5 0 0 e h t

and barbel is positively correlated with this variable, whereas pikeperch populations are more abundant in shallow reser- voirs. depth is therefore the main parameter structuring the ﬁsh communities in the studied reservoirs. along the second axis, which repre- sents 26% of the explained variability, the long- itudinal gradient is opposed to the age of the reservoir. these variables were not correlated during the previous analysis. these independent descriptors have an opposite effect on the ﬁsh assemblages. bleak is more abundant in old and/ or lowland reservoirs, whereas rainbow trout develops in young and/or elevated ones. the age since ﬁrst ﬁlling also has an effect on pike- perch which is most abundant in old water bodies. the group of rheophilic species observed in cor-

variabi- lity explained). its position on the biplot suggests that it is a species of intermediate longitudinal gradient and reservoir age. water level range does not appear to be a good structuring variable for this dataset. discussion the dataset processed in the present study reveals general patterns of the ﬁsh assemblages encoun- tered in french reservoirs. the observed taxa associations can be clustered into three types that are mountain sites, recently built lowland reservoirs, and older lowland reser- voirs. the latter group is much more heteroge- neous than the other two. the communities are inﬂuenced by local and regional parameters, and whereas reservoir morphology inﬂuences the abundance of particular species, large-scale de- scriptors tend to affect the assemblages. the increase in species diversity with the reser- voir size is coherent with the trends observed in ontario lakes (minns 1989) and northern wisconsin lakes (tonn & magnuson 1982). this can be related to the relationship between the 132 table 6. projected inertia decomposition on a cca subspace for the 19 species. environmental subspace (10 3) orthogonal subspace (10 3) total inertia (10 3)

catchment area, distance to the source and reservoir depth should fish communities in french reservoirs be interpreted with care, considering the numer- ous correlations linking these descriptors. how- ever, the effect of the catchment size on the ﬁsh communities can be considered indirectly through the downstream increase in nutrients loads, dis- solved minerals, and conductivity. the longitudi- nal gradient index designed on the basis of the site location descriptors could also be regarded as a temperature, a trophic or a quality gradient. this longitudinal-based structure conﬁrms the results of godinho et al. (1998) on portuguese reservoirs, although the species and sites characteristics are to a large extent different. high-altitude rivers typically sheltered no native ﬁsh populations prior to human introduc- tions of salmonids in the pyre´ ne´ es (delacoste et al. 1997). this can be generalized to most mountain areas in france, and ﬁshery legislation in such sites prohibits practices tending to sustain other ﬁsh taxa. therefore, ﬁsh communities in moun- tain reservoirs are more likely to reﬂect human actions than biotic responses to environmental conditions. depth is the main parameter structuring ﬁsh communities in reservoirs below 1500 m in altitude. this observation suggests a trophic interpretation fig. 8. cca biplot superposing the envir- onmental descriptors and the fish species. the scale box indicates the maximum value of the axis for the fish species. the maximum value of the axis is set to 1 for the descriptors. 133 irz et al. related to the food resource availability. deep water bodies submitted to temperate climate are seasonally stratiﬁed. these conditions are more favorable to pelagic ﬁshes which are able to feed in open waters than to the benthivorous species then limited to the shallow littoral areas. several bio- logical and chemical processes have been shown to depend on the depth of the water body that was therefore included in the expression of synthetic models to assess the trophic status or to predict ﬁsh yield (ryder et al. 1973). this interpretation of the effect of depth on ﬁsh communities is common with natural lakes, but reservoir-speciﬁc features increase the depth effect. a deep reservoir means that the dammed river had a steep slope. these intermediate riverine systems were de- scribed by verneaux (1981) as, from upstream to downstream, brown_trout, grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.) and barbel zones. french nase and barbel appear to be the species performing best in deep reservoirs, accompanied to a lesser extent by chub, bleak, rainbow trout, bream, gudgeon and brown_trout, whereas pikeperch, ruffe, pike and perch are most abundant in shallow reservoirs. furthermore the strong correlation between the reservoirs mean depth and their water level range can be considered as a general characteristics of these systems. the level ﬂuctuations, whose effects have so far been difﬁcult to distinguish from the effects of depth, also limit the possibi- lities for stable and rich benthic invertebrate and macrophytic communities to colonize the sub- strate. such artiﬁcial and unpredictable condi- tions for various functions of the ﬁsh life cycle. most of the recorded ﬁsh species feed, at least at one devel- opment stage, on benthic invertebrates (billard 1997). their low abundance represent a resource gap. the absence of aquatic vegetation also con- siderably reduces the survival of juveniles due to the lack of shelters from predators and prevents some species to reproduce in the absence of sui- table spawning habitat. the last direct impact of level variations is the risk for the eggs of shallow spawners to become emerged during lowering periods. severe pressure represent the cca shows that the water body depth is a better explanatory variable of the ﬁsh community than the water level range. nevertheless, the effects of level variations should be further inves- tigated to draw general conclusions. a more pre- cise description of the variations, including daily and seasonal ﬂuctuation regimes, would provide more pertinent results than the simple annual level range. man-made reservoirs can be regarded as parti- cularly interesting environments due to their 134 youth. their rapid evolution, in comparison to natural hydrosystems, provides valuable informa- tion on the ecological successions following a major environmental disruption. fish commu- nities appear sensitive to reservoirs’ aging process. the ﬁsh fauna of a newly built reservoir essen- tially originates from the dammed river. the dominant species at that stage are either rheophi- lic and limited to the mouth of the tributaries or come from the river pools. few of them are generalist enough to remain competitive in a lacustrine environment. pelagic habitats are to a large extent unexploited as these species ﬁnd better living conditions in littoral shallow areas (fernando & holcik 1991). in most cases, the ﬁsh stock does not increase until species adapted to standing waters are introduced. obviously, such management practices alter the natural evolution of biotic communities. nevertheless, our observa- tions show that the structuring role of site char- acteristics is not occulted by anthropogenic actions. indeed, as shown by argillier et al. (2002), stocking is rather inefﬁcient in such envir- onments. we hypothesize that species introduc- tions do not challenge our approach, ﬁrstly because all the sites are similarly submitted to these practices, and secondly because the success of an introduced species depends on whether it meets favorable environmental conditions or not. therefore, the abundance of the species can be regarded as a response to habitat characteristics despite stocking and introductions. the brutal habitat disturbance due to the con- struction of the dam is followed by a rapid evolu- tion in the created environment. some authors consider three stages in this biogeochemical evo- lution. a short time after ﬁlling, a ‘trophic up- surge’ results from the nutrients’ availability from inundated soils, then productivity decreases and then stabilizes at a level controlled by the external nutrients’ loads from the inﬂow (popp et al. 1996). in spite of the lack of water quality data, this model does not seem to ﬁt our observations. french reservoirs appear sensitive to progressive eutrophication, the ﬁrst algal blooms occurring a few decades after initial ﬁlling (unpublished data). fish community response to these habitat altera- tions is quite similar to the pattern described by kubecka (1993) with a shift from the original riverine community to cyprinids-dominated com- munities with important perch populations. such a process certainly is accelerated by species intro- ductions. the ultimate stage is characterized by the dominance of cyprinids, particularly bleak, and pikeperch that can be considered as the typical old reservoirs predator. these species are considered to be tolerant towards water quality and their adaptive ability allows their populations to develop in unstable environments. communities therefore seem to reﬂect the eutro- phication trend. the opposite effect of reservoir age and long- itudinal gradient index shows that the response of ﬁsh assemblages to the aging process is similar to a progressive slide towards downstream-type com- munities. this conﬁrms the trophic interpretation of the observed taxa successions, considering a longitudinal productivity gradient as a general feature of riverine systems. conclusions this work provides an original overview of the features of ﬁsh communities in french reservoirs and highlights the different types of factors struc- turing them. though the investigations were lim- ited to easily collectable descriptors of the studied reservoirs, the general patterns in the species associations can be interpreted functionally. in the absence of reference conditions due to their artiﬁcial origin, reservoir ﬁsheries management does not include any conservation purposes. spe- cies introductions are widespread and accelerate the successions while reservoirs age. further research aiming at designing a model to predict the ﬁsh potential yield and species adaptability should require the collection of water quality data. resumen 1. el objetivo de este trabajo es describir los ensamblajes de peces de los embalses franceses y relacionarlos con las caracteristicas de las localidades. los resultados de 43 mues- treos fueron complementados con descriptores ambientales. los ensamblajes de peces diﬁrieron entre localidades de montan˜ a dominadas por salmonidos y los de tierras bajas. los embalses de montan˜ a reﬂejan mas acciones humanas (re- poblaciones e introduccio´ n de especies) que respuestas bio- ticas a las condiciones ambientales. por debajo de los 1500 m de altitud, la diversidad de especies es mayor y se pueden distinguir comunidades reoﬁlicas a limnoﬁlicas. esto puede estar relacionado con la edad, la profundidad y la localiza- cion geograﬁca de la cuenca. 2. la respuesta de las comunidades a estas variables fue investigada a traves de analisis de correlacion cano´ nica. los para´ metros ambientales explicaron un 20% de la dis- persio´ n de las especies. las comunidades estan inﬂuenciadas por parametros locales y regionales. mientras que la morfo- logia del embalse determina la abundancia de algunas espe- cies, descriptores a gran escala tienden a afectar a los ensamblajes. las especies reoﬁlicas son tipicamente abun- dantes en las cuencas superiores, profundas y en los embalses recientemente creados. la respuesta de la comunidad de peces a la edad de los embalses tiende a ser la adicio´ n de especies de aguas quietas y a la extincio´ n de especie de rı´ o. discutimos ademas el papel estructural de la profundidad de las localidades, la edad y la localizacion, considerando estas fish communities in french reservoirs relaciones con el estado tro´ ﬁco y su signiﬁcado en te´ rminos de habitat. acknowledgements we would
