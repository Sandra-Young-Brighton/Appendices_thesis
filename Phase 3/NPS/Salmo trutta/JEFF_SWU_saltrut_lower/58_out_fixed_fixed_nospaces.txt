(bw) populations materials and methods egg size to compare the egg size in fw and bw populations, egg diameter (mm) of ovulated eggs of 96 females from pa¨rnu bay, 16 females from matsalu bay and 59 females from lake peipsi were measured. in 2002 (pa¨rnu bay only, may 7th, n ¼ 19) and 2003 (pa¨rnu and matsalu bay june 19th, n ¼ 7 + 7, accordingly; lake peipsi may 27th, n ¼ 32), the egg diameter was measured in the middle of the spawning season, whereas in 2004 we measured the eggs from females collected at different times (pa¨rnu bay may 4th, n ¼ 39 and june 5th, n ¼ 31; matsalu bay april 22nd, n ¼ 3, may 3rd, n ¼ 3 and june 18th, n ¼ 3; lake peipsi april 29th, n ¼ 12 and june 8th, n ¼ 15) during the spawning period to reveal the differences between batches. running eggs were stripped into petri dish, photographed under a microscope and the diam- eter of at least 30 eggs from each female measured using image tool (uthscsa image tool for windows version 2.00, san antonio, texas, usa) software. the dates during which ﬁsh were collected were trans- formed into days of the year for further analyses. also, the total length (tl) to the nearest millimetre of each female was measured. age of ﬁsh caught in 2004 was determined by counting annuli (single opaque and hyaline zone per year) of whole otoliths according to raitaniemi et al. (2000) under a microscope of 16· magniﬁcation. two readers read the otoliths and the percentage of agreement was determined. the otoliths that could not be rectiﬁed were not used in age analyses. reciprocal crossings we performed reciprocal crossings of freshwater and brackish-water ruffe and studied embryo development 106 at different salinity concentrations. mature ﬁsh were caught on the spawning grounds from a freshwater (fw, salinity <0.1 ppt, lake peipsi) and brackish- water (bw, salinity 3.5–6 ppt, pa¨rnu bay) population in may 2003 using trap nets and gill nets. live ﬁsh were transported to the laboratory where they were stripped. the ﬁsh used in experiments were selected by visual estimation of quality of ovulated eggs to avoid the unsuccessful fertilisation. the eggs of six fw females and two bw females were fertilised each with fw and bw males’ sperm at different salinities and incubated in petri dishes. a mixture of sperm from two males of the same origin was used in each crossing. each series (eggs with the same parents) consisted of three petri dishes with embryos develop- ing in salinities 3.3, 5.5 and 7.7 ppt (ﬁve fw females), 3.3, 5.5, 7.7 and 9.9 ppt (one fw female) and 5.5, 7.7 and 9.9 ppt (bw females; table 1). experimental salinities for fw and bw females were chosen according to results provided by vetemaa & saat (1996) where they showed that there was no difference in survival and hatching rate of bw ﬁsh in salinities of 3 and 5 ppt and the embryos of fw ruffe did not survive in higher salinities (above 7 ppt). in total 16 series (two series with each female, one with fw and one with bw sperm) were incubated. saline water was obtained by dissolving sea salt (kesko oy, helsinki, finland) in distilled water. salinity was checked with mettler toledo mc 126 conductivity meter (mettler- toledo, inc., columbus, ohio, usa). each dish contained c. 114 (fw females) or 90 (bw females) eggs and 60 ml of water. water was renewed daily. every day the number of live and dead embryos was counted. dead embryos were removed. the dishes were kept under the same conditions under natural photoperiod and at 16 °c. when most embryos had table 1. results of reciprocal crossings of freshwater (fw) and brackish water (bw) females (f) and males (m). egg survival (%) larvae sl (mm) cross salinity no. females no. eggs mean ± sd n mean ± sd fw-f · fw-m 3.3 5.5 7.7 9.9 fw-f · bw-m 3.3 5.5 7.7 9.9 bw-f · fw-m 5.5 7.7 9.9 bw-f · bw-m 5.5 7.7 9.9 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 644 620 616 115 672 656 713 143 175 166 167 211 194 152 0 ± 0 0 ± 0 17.42 ± 12.03 63 2.30 ± 0.28 18 2.04 ± 0.32 8.05 ± 5.18 8 2.06 ± 0.43 1.46 ± 1.34 0 92 2.19 ± 0.25 13 2.28 ± 0.47 8 2.05 ± 0.40 0 15.20 ± 6.66 7.79 ± 8.32 1.76 ± 1.76 0 ± 0 0 ± 0 30.15 ± 19.07 28 2.96 ± 0.20 13.59 ± 10.05 13 2.82 ± 0.19 2.78 ± 3.93 3 2.18 ± 0.66 32 3.09 ± 0.18 18.10 ± 0.45 16 2.77 ± 0.15 14.53 ± 7.23 1.89 ± 2.67 2 2.54 ± 0.67 hatched, all samples were preserved in 70% ethanol at the same time. later the length (sl, mm) of almost 30 larvae from each female (less in higher salinities, where the number of hatched larvae was lower) was measured. statistical analyses were conducted using the statistica 6.0 (statsoft inc., tulsa, oklahoma, usa). one-way anova (type iii) was used to compare the egg sizes in different populations, and the effects of salinity, female and male origin on the survival of embryos at hatching and sl of larvae. statistically signiﬁcant results were followed by bonferroni post hoc tests. results egg size in all between matsalu bay egg size did not differ egg size was signiﬁcantly different three populations (f2,168 ¼ 581.44, p < 0.0001;
