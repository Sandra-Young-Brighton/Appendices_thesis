home ranges for pelagic species, such as white bass morone chrysops, are generally not well described, yet are thought to be large. we studied white bass movement using acoustic telemetry in two irrigation reservoirs of the republican river basin in south-western nebraska. acoustic transmitters were implanted in fall of the previous year and tracking occurred a minimum of once per week throughout spring (mid-march to may) 2007 and 2008. linear home ranges were calculated from observed locations of individual ﬁsh. twelve of the twenty-seven tagged ﬁsh with at least ﬁve locations exhibited localised home ranges throughout the spring whereas the remaining ﬁsh exhibited home ranges extending across large portions of each reservoir. home range size was not correlated with ﬁsh size or condition. d. r. martin1, l. a. powell2, k. l. pope3 1nebraska cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, school of natural resources, university of nebraska-lincoln, lincoln, ne, usa,

and uses for daily activities during a given period (burt 1943). home ranges have been described for many freshwater ﬁsh species including bluegill lepomis macrochirus (paukert et al. 2004), largemouth bass micropterus salmoides (winter 1977), ﬂathead catﬁsh pylodictis olivaris (weller & winter 2001; vokoun 2003) and walleye sander vitreus (foust & haynes 2007). however, most home ranges previ- ously estimated are for littoral-zone species that spend large amounts of time along the shoreline of a water body. movements deﬁning a home range are speciﬁc to individuals and differ from population-directed move- ments such as seasonal and spawning migrations. within a single population, some ﬁsh may have restricted movements and localised home ranges whereas other ﬁsh may have large home ranges (gerking 1959). however, the source of this variation among individual home-range sizes is often unknown. pelagic freshwater ﬁshes, such as striped bass morone saxatilis and white bass m. chrysops, are often highly mobile and may roam an entire water body in search of food and other necessary resources. the striped bass has strong site ﬁdelity and localised home ranges in both estuary and reservoir systems (jackson & hightower 2001; ng et al. 2007). summer home ranges of the striped bass are often limited in southern reservoirs because of low dissolved oxygen and hot water temperatures (jackson & hightower 2001). though no information exists on home ranges of white bass, white bass movements have been assessed in prior studies. individual white bass move up to )1 in search of food (scott & crossman 11.1 kmæday 1973). beck & willis (2000) used biotelemetry to determine that white bass were usually located near- shore during spring and autumn months and offshore during winter and summer months in a south dakota glacial lake. multiple regression models quantifying distance of white bass locations from the nearest shore were weakly affected by temperature, cloud cover, precipitation and moon phase (all r2 < 0.26; beck & willis 2000). our objective was to quantify spring home ranges of white bass in two reservoirs within the republican river basin of south-western nebraska. 514 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00377.x study area enders reservoir is an irrigation reservoir constructed along frenchmen creek, in chase county, nebraska, by the u.s. bureau of reclamation in 1951. at conservation pool, enders reservoir has a water level of 948.5 m above mean sea level, surface area of 485 ha and maximum depth of 18.3 m. the shoreline is mostly composed of a silt ⁄ sand substrate with small cottonwood populus deltoides trees lining the shore- line. hugh butler lake (red willow) is an irrigation reservoir constructed along red willow creek in frontier county, nebraska, by the u.s. bureau of reclamation in 1962. at conservation pool, hugh butler lake has a water level of 786.9 m above mean sea level, surface area of 660 ha and maximum depth of 15.2 m. hugh butler lake has two inﬂow sources creating a reservoir with two arms: spring creek to the north and red willow creek to the west. the shoreline is mostly composed of a silt substrate with small cottonwood trees lining the shoreline. materials and methods thirty adult white bass (15 in enders reservoir and 15 in hugh butler lake) were implanted using techniques described by hart & summerfelt (1975) with sono- tronics ultrasonic tags (model ibt-96-9-1; 42 mm table 1. size and condition of ﬁsh (measured during tag implantation during september of previous year), number of spring

autumn 2006; an additional 30 white bass (15 in each reservoir) were implanted during autumn 2007 (total tagged ﬁsh n = 60). tag weight was <2.0% body weight and had a battery life expectancy of 9 months as reported by the manufacturer. mean ± standard error (se) total length for all ﬁsh used in further analysis was 306 ± 5 mm, mean weight ± se was 350 ± 22 g and mean ± se condition [relative weight (wr); wege & anderson 1978; brown & murphy 1991] was 86 ± 2 at the time of tagging (table 1). attempts to locate tagged white bass were made once a week during spring 2007 (17 attempts) and twice a week during spring 2008 (33 attempts). a typical sampling attempt consisted of a period of 12 h with days split into morning (03:00–15:00 h) and evening (15:00–03:00 h) sessions. tracking attempts began after ice-out on 22 march 2007 and 5 march 2008 and ended on 29 may 2007 and 2 june 2008 due to loss of tag battery life. during each sampling event, we systematically worked around the reservoir stop- ping approximately every 300 m to scan (i.e. cycling through all frequencies with the directional hydropho- ne pointed at 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° and 360°) for tags. once a tag was detected, we maintained a constant to pinpoint the location of the ﬁsh. after pinpointing a ﬁsh’s location, we resumed the systematic search. at least three circuits of the reservoir were

every 4 h within a 12-h sampling period. geographical coordinates were recorded with a garmin etrex gps unit at each ﬁsh location. coor- dinates were recorded in nad83 utm zone 14n. locations were mapped using arcmap version 9.3 (esri 2008) and compared to bathymetric maps of the reservoirs created with data from the lake mapping program of the nebraska game and parks commission. twenty-seven white bass were located a minimum of ﬁve times (range 5–25 locations per ﬁsh) during spring of 2007 (n = 12) and 2008 (n = 15; table 1). white bass with less than ﬁve locations were not included in analyses because at least ﬁve locations are needed to calculate a home range. multiple locations of individual ﬁsh within a sampling period were separated by at least 3 h. of those 27 white bass, 16 were in enders reservoir and 11 were in hugh butler lake. we calculated home ranges using a linear method in arcgis to allow for comparison among individual white bass movements. the linear method deﬁnes a home range as the minimum distance between the two most extreme locations (hayne 1949) and tends to underestimate home-range size by limiting the home range to one dimension. this distance was calculated manually in arcgis by measuring the shortest distance required to travel between the two most extreme locations while staying within the reservoir (i.e. not crossing onto shore). other home-range methods, such as the adaptive kernel method, tend to overestimate home-range size when the number of locations is less than 25 (schoener 1981; worton 1987) and researchers may introduce bias when reducing a kernel-based home range to the actual available home range within a water body. like the minimum convex polygon estimator, the linear method is prone to effects of sample size (burgman & fox 2003). however, the dimension issue is likely minimised in ﬁshery studies because most systems are longer in one dimension (e.g. river channels and dendritic reservoirs) than the other. results enders reservoir six white bass had small (<1000 m) home ranges in enders reservoir during spring 2007 and spring 2008. fish #51 had the smallest spring home range at enders reservoir, which was characterised by a ﬂat, shallow area (fig. 1). fish #157 had a small spring home range located along a steep area of natural rock on the west shoreline of the lower reservoir (fig. 1). fish #129 and #140 had overlapping spring home ranges restricted to a steep area of natural rock at the northern extent of the riprap dam (fig. 1). the spring home range of ﬁsh #166 was located in the middle reservoir along a shallow, relatively ﬂat area with inundated trees along the shoreline (fig. 1). fish #115 also had a small spring home range that was restricted to an area with two riprap jetties along the eastern shore (fig. 1). eight white bass had medium (between 1000 and 3000 m) spring home ranges that extended across larger portions of enders reservoir. fish #47 had a spring home range that extended across the centre of the lower reservoir characterised by a relatively deep basin with steep shorelines (fig. 1). fish #58, #67 and #68 had spring home ranges located across the middle portion of the reservoir characterised by a shallow ﬂat area with shorelines dominated by small woody trees with the addition of some sandy beaches along the southern shoreline (fig. 1). fish #125 had

fish #64 and #71 had locations and spring home ranges that included shallow water of the upper reservoir. the remaining two white bass had large (>3000 m) spring home ranges that extended throughout enders reservoir. fish #53 was found throughout the reser- voir during spring and had a linear home range encompassing most of the reservoir (fig. 1). fish #171 also had a large home range extending across most of the reservoir (fig. 1). hugh butler lake six white bass had small home ranges in hugh butler lake during spring 2007 and spring 2008. fish #141 had the smallest spring home range in hugh butler lake, which was characterised by a local structure of dead, standing trees along an old creek channel in the north arm (fig. 2). fish #39 had a spring home range restricted to a relatively ﬂat area adjacent to a point extending into the west arm (fig. 2). fish #116 had a spring home range located in the upper section of the west arm with most locations occurring along a steep break near shore (fig. 2). the spring home range of #122 was centred on a large underwater point extending across the middle of the reservoir with some locations nearby along the southern shore (fig. 2). fish #19 had a small spring home range characterised by locations on either side of a point extending into the lower reservoir (fig. 2). fish #101 had a similar spring home range located along a submerged point further west (fig. 2). one white bass had a medium home range in huge butler lake. fish #38 had a spring home range in the lower reservoir (fig. 2). locations of ﬁsh #38 were mostly along drop-offs (fig. 2). the remaining four white bass had large spring home ranges extending throughout hugh butler lake. fish #151 and #168 had locations throughout the west white bass home ranges 10,000

both had locations and spring home ranges extending across the entire reservoir (fig. 2). home-range analysis a mean ± se of linear home-range estimates ranged from 69 to 8154 m, with 1968 ± 421 m (table 1). home-range size did not differ between years (kruskal–wallis test, v2 = 0.18, p = 0.67) or reservoirs (v2 = 0.10, p = 0.75); thus, observations were pooled for further analysis. twelve white bass had home ranges restricted to small areas of the reservoir (<25%), nine white bass had home ranges encompassing 25–75% of the reservoir and six white bass had home ranges encompassing almost the entire reservoir. linear home range was not correlated with number of locations per ﬁsh (r = 0.001, p = 0.96; fig. 3). linear home range was also not correlated with ﬁsh total length (r = )0.23, p = 0.25), weight (r = )0.17, p = 0.42) (r = 0.10, p = 0.65) at the time of tag implantation (i.e. autumn). no evidence of ﬁsh shoaling was observed among or condition 517 martin et al. tagged ﬁsh during tracking (i.e. no more than one ﬁsh was observed in the same location at the same time). discussion the identiﬁcation of home ranges of white bass during spring (mid-march to may) provides insights into their basic biology. spawning was limited to approximately 10 days in early may of each year. thus, linear home ranges described herein encompassed prespawn, spawn and postspawn periods for white bass in these two reservoirs. our method of tracking ﬁsh using mobile acoustic telemetry should bias the number of encounters towards ﬁsh with smaller home ranges. fish that moved shorter distances were more likely to be encountered during a circuit than ﬁsh that moved longer distances. however, no relationship existed between the number of encounters and linear home- range size. thus, we believe this bias was minimal. the discontinuity in size of white bass home ranges suggests that two distinct behaviours of white bass occur in these reservoirs during spring. one behaviour produces movement during spring throughout much of the reservoir. the other produces more localised movement – a seemingly counterintuitive result given that white bass is a pelagic species. at least six competing hypotheses for the observed discontinuity in size of spring home ranges can be posed, including: (1) larger ﬁsh may require greater home-range areas to obtain sufﬁcient energy for growth and reproduction (peters 1983; minns 1995); (2) ﬁsh in greater condi- tion (e.g. wr) may travel less because they are in an area with abundant resources (optimal foraging theory; macarthur & pianka 1966); (3) male ﬁsh may remain close to potential spawning sites throughout the prespawn and spawning periods; (4) older, reproduc- tively senescent ﬁsh may travel little because they lack migratory behaviour that is associated with spawning periods; (5) some ﬁsh may spawn in intermittent years, and remain in energetically favourable areas during nonspawning years to promote growth (jørgensen et al. 2006; secor 2008); and (6) inter-individual variation in standard metabolic rates may be associated with varying levels of aggressiveness and activity levels (cutts et al. 2002). hypotheses 1 and 2 were not supported by our results (body size and wr were not correlated with linear home-range size), though the sample size was limited (n = 27). although hypoth- esis 2 was not supported by our data, white bass with small home ranges selected for areas characterised by one of two features: underwater drop-offs or relatively ﬂat areas with small trees. these areas may provide abundant food such that time and energy expenditure is minimised during the search phase of foraging. 518 these areas may also provide habitat necessary for spawning, although results from patch occupancy modelling and acoustic telemetry did not support this contention (martin 2008). we did not gather age, gender, reproductive status or metabolic data from tagged ﬁsh and thus were unable to test hypotheses 3, 4, 5 or 6. further research is needed to determine the mechanisms responsible for the discontinuity in white bass spring home-range size. acknowledgements we thank chris lewis and many volunteers for
