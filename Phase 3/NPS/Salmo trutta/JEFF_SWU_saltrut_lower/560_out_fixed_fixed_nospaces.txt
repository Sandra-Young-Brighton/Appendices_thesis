gilbert & lechowicz 2004; whaley et al. 2007). the identiﬁcation of these patterns has practical implications to the design of reserve networks (arponen et al. 2005), the planning and management of biodiversity (cramer & hobbs 2002) and the establishment of efﬁcient monitoring programmes (roth & weber 2008). freshwater ecosystems in greece are considered as ‘biodiversity hotspots’ for european freshwater ﬁsh (reyjol et al. 2007), due to their ability to support species of conservation interest, for which a number of protected areas have been established (drakou et al. 2008; kallimanis et al. 2008b). more generally, freshwater ecosystems are naturally heterogeneous landscapes, known for providing vital habitat for many taxa [birds (cleary et al. 2005), mammals (ruggiero 1999) and amphibians (cushman 2006)]. in addition, freshwater ﬁshes inhabiting these ecosystems are suitable for examining the role of ecological factors in community ecology and regional biogeography (grifﬁths 2006). several studies have focused on two competing theories on how communities are structured: niche- based and neutral approaches. the niche-based approach (keddy 1992) claims that community doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00354.x 369 drakou et al. composition is a consequence of physiological pro- cesses and biological interactions. accordingly, local habitat characteristics can determine community com- position patterns, thus habitat suitability is the key factor shaping species assemblage structure. on the other hand, neutral theory of biodiversity (hubbell 2001) claims that dispersal limitation and stochastic events, more than environmental determinism, are the driving forces structuring community composition. a key point of this theory is the neutrality assumption, stating that all individuals in a community have equal net ﬁtness (chave 2004). although it ignores key ecological principles such as differences among spe- cies (bell 2001; chave 2004) or aspects of species coexistence (chesson 2000; chase & leibold 2003), there is evidence to suggest is capable of summarising a surprising array of empirical patterns of species abundance (hubbell 2001). that it one major difference of the two theories is the signiﬁcance of environmental heterogeneity or dis- persal limitation, as a driver of species community composition (gilbert & lechowicz 2004). niche- based theory predicts that species composition reﬂects adaptive responses of the species and therefore depends on the environmental conditions. on the other hand, neutral theory predicts that the similarity in species composition between communities depends on the effect of dispersal limitation and thus decreases as the distance between two communities increases (chase et al. 2005). in order to assess the ability of the two theories to explain empirical observations, an increasing number of studies have investigated the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation in structuring species com- munity composition. the majority of these studies have focused on plants (tuomisto et al. 2003; ros- setto et al. 2008), birds (cleary et al. 2005; steinitz et al. 2006), marine ﬁsh (whaley et al. 2007) and invertebrates (thompson & townsend 2006). less attention has been paid to freshwater ﬁsh communi- ties, which inhabit discrete patches strongly bounded by terrestrial habitat. most investigating potential factors affecting ﬁsh assemblage structure mainly focus on speciﬁc biotic (macrophytes, nekton) and abiotic (ph, alkalinity) characteristics (bistoni & hued 2002; zyll de jong et al. 2005). still, their structure also depends on the interaction of multiple ecological processes acting over several temporal and spatial (magnuson et al. 1998; lewis & magnuson 2000). in this sense, the location of an ecosystem in the landscape has important implications for determining whether regional drivers would be more signiﬁcant in determining species community composition (lewis & magnuson 2000). the potential inﬂuence of landscape and local habitat structure upon richness and composition of freshwater local or studies scales 370 ﬁsh assemblages has received little consideration (genner et al. 2004). the aim of this study was to examine the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and dis- persal limitation on freshwater ﬁsh communities of 18 greek lakes and reservoirs included in the natura 2000 network. we had three main objectives. first, we investigated the potential effect of environmental factors upon species richness and composition. sec- ondly, we analysed the clustering of ecosystems according to their species composition. finally, we investigated the correspondence of ﬁsh community composition with the environmental conditions of the studied ecosystems and the distance separating them. study area our study areas included 15 lakes and three reservoirs (fig. 1), which are protected under the framework of the habitat’s directive (92 ⁄ 43 ⁄ eec). basic morpho- logical and limnological characteristics of the studied ecosystems are depicted in table 1. the studied ecosystems were dispersed from north- ern to south-western greece with most of them being totally independent from each other (fig. 1). their position and connections have changed over time thereby providing great opportunities for dispersal (bernatchez & wilson 1998). these ecosystems, belonged geomorphogenetically to discrete basins and are relics of old larger lakes, which occupied the country during pliocene times, when lakes vegoritida, petron and zazari (fig. 1) used to be one single lake (aeordaea lake). agra reservoir was linked with vegoritida lake until 1990. furthermore, lake chima- from lake zazari and ditida receives water discarded water in lake petron. at the same time period, a second group of lakes (lakes amvrakia, ozeros, lisimachia, trichonida) formed a large lake, agrinio lake, which belonged to a large river system along with tavropos reservoir. the rest of the ecosystems studied showed no connection through surface or underground waters. all these ecosystems belong to two larger biogeographical regions as identiﬁed by economidis & banarescu (1991); ponto–aegean division (for those situated in northern greece) and south-adriatic ⁄ ionian division (for those situated in south-western greece). input materials and methods fish diversity data fish diversity data was collected from both published (e.g., economidis 1991; kottelat 1997; bobori & economidis 2006; economou et al. 2007; leonardos et al. 2008) and grey literature (technical reports and dispersal versus environment in freshwater ﬁsh fig. 1. map of the studied freshwater eco- systems in greece. 1: lake volvi, 2: kerkini reservoir, 3: agra reservoir, 4: lake veg- oritida, 5: lake petron, 6: lake chimadit- ida, 7: lake zazari, 8: lake kastorias, 9: lake mikri prespa, 10: lake ioanninon, 11: tavropos reservoir, 12: lake voulkaria, 13: lake amvrakia, 14: lake ozeros, 15: lake lisimachia, 16: lake trichonida, 17: lake stymfalia and 18: lake taka.

(simberloff & stiling 1996; whittier & kincaid 1999), we decided not to include them in the analysis as reliable information on the existence of these species in the studied areas is lacking (econom- idis et al. 2000). we considered only species that have a limnophile or limnophile ⁄ rheophile and stagnophile habitat character (bobori et al. 2001). fish species records derived mostly from gill-net multi mesh sampling and electroﬁshing conducted in the studied 371 drakou et al. ecosystems at different time periods. fish species richness was estimated as the number of species of the above categories present in each aquatic ecosystem. the list of ﬁsh species and their frequency of occur- rence are presented in appendix s1. species names are in accordance with the recent nomenclature of kottelat & freyhof (2007) and froese & pauly (2008). environmental data by the natura we used digital maps of the natura 2000 network depicting habitat type composition in our study areas. we did not consider the entire protected area, as implemented 2000 directive (92 ⁄ 43 ⁄ eec), but only the water body of each aquatic ecosystem and the ‘natural’ habitat types that were in direct contact with it (sample map, fig. 1a), as these form the environment freshwater ﬁshes live in. in our study ‘human-made’ habitat types, such as areas of arable land, settlements or afforestation, were absent. habitat types were deﬁned according to the habitats directive classiﬁcation scheme. for map processing and transformation we used arcgis software (esri, new york, usa). we quantiﬁed spatial pattern with the use of metrics computed by fragstats software (mcgarigal & marks 1995), which calculates approximately 75 metrics describing area ⁄ density ⁄ edge, shape, isola- tion ⁄ proximity, contagion ⁄ interspersion and diversity of habitat types at the landscape level. as there is a great degree of collinearity among these metrics, we investigated their intercorrelations with the aid of correlation analysis. the noncorrelated metrics were maintained for further analysis (table 2). the criteria of selection among the intercorrelated metrics were the physical meaning of the metrics as well as their ability to distinguish between our study sites. to assess the environmental condition of our study sites, we included in the analysis apart from the spatial pattern metrics, geographical and limnological data. two limnological variables were available for all ecosystems (maximum lake depth and ecosystem’s trophic status), and were collected from published literature and technical reports (e.g., conides et al. 1995; matzinger et al. 2006). altitude (m.a.s.l.) was also included in the analysis. all the variables analysed are described in table 2. to evaluate dispersal limitation, we calculated linear distances between aquatic ecosystems (km). based on the coordinates (x, y) of the centre of each aquatic ecosystem, we generated an inter-lake distance matrix based on straight-line distances (euclidean distances between the centres of each ecosystem). data analysis to investigate which, if any, of the environmental variables could predict ﬁsh species richness, we performed a multiple regression analysis (mlr). we used spatial pattern metrics, geographical and limno- logical characteristics (table 2) as independent vari- ables and ﬁsh species richness as the dependent one.

using bray–curtis index of similarity and euclidean distance to measure the distances between groups. additionally, species responsible for the grouping of the studied aquatic ecosystems which contributed signiﬁcantly to the similarity within each cluster, as well as those respon- sible for differentiating the occurring clusters, were speciﬁed using the simper (similarity percentages – species contributions) procedure (clarke 1993) of primer statistical package (clarke & gorley 2001). the bioenv (biota-environment matching) proce- dure of primer was used to identify the most important environmental variables (as determined by weighted spearman rank correlations) explaining ﬁsh species composition. this test successively assesses all possible combinations of environmental variables that can best describe species community composition (anandraj et al. 2007). we correlated species composition and environmental variables similarity matrices with spear- man rank correlation (clarke & gorley 2001), for the entire dataset as well as within the occurring clusters. for our in order to investigate the correlation between environmental characteristics and the composition of ﬁsh assemblages study ecosystems, we performed the relate (testing matched similarity matrices) procedure of primer (clarke & warwick 2001). the ﬁrst step was the calculation of local environmental variables similarity matrix based on normalised euclidean distance. similarity matrix of ﬁsh assemblages was calculated using bray–curtis index of similarity. to examine the degree to which environmental variables explained the differences in ﬁsh community patterns, we assessed the congruence between similarity matrices by generating spearman rank correlations through randomisation tests (999 permutations) (somerﬁeld & clarke 1995). moreover, based on the estimated pairwise distances among the study sites we constructed a ‘between-lake’ distance matrix (generated using normalised euclidean dis- tances). we used relate subroutine to correlate the produced distance matrix with ﬁsh species composi- tion similarity matrix, aiming to detect the effect of geographical distance among the different lakes and reservoirs on ﬁsh species composition. both the above analyses were performed for the entire dataset, and also for the occurring clusters. results fish fauna description the aquatic ecosystems studied were inhabited by 53 native ﬁsh species belonging to 10 families (appen- dix s1). cyprinidae was the most abundant family dispersal versus environment in freshwater ﬁsh (70%) followed by cobitidae (7.5%) and gobiidae (7.5%) while six families were represented by only one species (1.9%). out of the 53 ﬁsh species, 37 (70%) are endemic of greece and the neighbouring balkan countries. more speciﬁcally, 17 (46%) of them are endemic of western greece, 11 (30%) endemic of northern greece and nine (24%) endemic of the balkan countries and greece. the majority of them belonged to the cyprinidae family and the genera squalius (seven species), rutilus (three species), barbus (three species) and telestes (one species). fish species richness ranged from three (lake taka) to 19 (lake volvi). the most common species that was present in all ecosystems was cyprinus carpio. two species (tinca tinca, esox lucius) appeared in more than 50% of the study sites, 20 species have been recorded in 3–8 sites, while 23 ﬁsh species appeared only in one ecosystem (appendix s1). effect of environmental heterogeneity on species richness the results of mlr demonstrated that ﬁsh species richness was positively correlated with area-weighted mean patch area (area_am) (r = 0.777, p < 0.001) (fig. 2a). also, ﬁsh species richness was negatively correlated with altitude (r = )0.474, p < 0.001) (fig. 2b). aquatic ecosystem grouping clustering of the study sites on the basis of similarities in species composition revealed three groups (fig. 3) with homogeneous native fauna. the distinguished groups clearly reﬂect the geographic location of the studied aquatic ecosystems, implying an underlying biogeographical pattern. group 1 (fig. 3) was com- prised of the aquatic ecosystems of northern greece, group 2 of ecosystems of central-western greece and peloponnese and group 3 includes ecosystems of north-western greece. percentage similarity analysis (simper) identiﬁed which species contributed most to the formation of each cluster. for the formation of the ‘northern’ group, c. carpio and e. lucius had the highest contribution (23.25% each of them). for ‘central-western’ group, it was pelasgus stymphalicus and squalius peloponnensis (33.3% each of them). finally, for ‘south-western’ group rutilus panosi, c. carpio and luciobarbus albanicus had the highest contribution (16.77% each of them). the species that distinguished groups 1 and 2 (average dissimilarity = 79.35%) were s. peloponnen- sis and p. stymphalicus present only in group 2 and e. lucius present only in group 1 (8.24% contribution each of them). similarly, groups 1 and 3 (average dissimilarity = 79.37%) were distinguished due to the presence of r. panosi and l. albanicus present in 373 drakou et al.

economidis & banarescu 1991). the species that contributed most to the homogeneity of the ‘northern’ group were genuine primary freshwater species, of central euro- pean, european or wider distribution, which inhabited greek freshwater ecosystems through the black sea and former aegeopotamos river (economidis & banarescu 1991). species of the ‘western’ group arrived directly from the north and were mainly rheophilic, with limited ability to disperse over long distances. the different dispersal routes these species followed, along with the fact that those of one group could not physically inhabit ecosystems of the other, emphasise the role of pindus range as a natural barrier, which obstructed freshwater ﬁsh dispersal. this ﬁnd- ing further supports the hypothesis, that mountain as well as marine barriers could affect species distribu- tion (tonn et al. 1990; grifﬁths 2006; spens et al. 2007). to add to the importance of dispersal barriers, we tested the relative importance of environmental heter- ogeneity and dispersal limitation – as considered in our analysis – in structuring freshwater ﬁsh commu- 375 fig. 4. correspondence of pairwise similarities between aquatic ecosystems based on freshwater ﬁsh composition with distance (km) between aquatic ecosystems. correlated ﬁsh fauna composition within the formed clusters (bioenv procedure) were area_am and altitude for the ‘northern’ group (r = 0.562) and prd and simpson’s diversity index (sidi) (r = 0.331) for the ‘western’ group. for the ‘northern’ group of ecosystems, similarity matrix of species composition and distance matrix of geographic distances between ecosystems were strongly correlated (r = 0.639, p = 0.006, relate procedure). the same analysis revealed no signiﬁcant relationship between the similarity matrix of species composition and that of environmental variables (r = 0.037, p = 0.429). for the ‘western’ group, the similarity matrix of species composition and the distance matrix of geographic distances between ecosystems were as well (r = 0.492, p = 0.016). the correlation between spe- cies composition similarity matrix and that of envi- ronmental parameters was not signiﬁcant, for this group (r = )0.012, p = 0.489). correlated strongly discussion our results indicated that freshwater ﬁsh community composition was associated more with dispersal in terms of straight-line distances among freshwater ecosystems, than with their environmental heteroge- neity. our ﬁndings support the hypothesis that distant sites, which might share similar environmental condi- tions, could display a low species similarity (primack & miao 1992). still, some environmental variables are likely to drive species richness patterns at freshwater ecosystems. freshwater ﬁsh species richness was found to signiﬁcantly decrease with altitude and increase with ecosystem area, in accordance with previous studies (bistoni & hued 2002; hobæk et al. 2002; pittman et al. 2004). more generally, the relationship between species richness and area is one of the oldest known in ecology (rosenzweig 1995; jacquemin et al. 2001; drakou et al. nity composition. when testing the effect of environ- mental heterogeneity on freshwater species composi- tion, we found species composition to be most strongly correlated with area_am and prd. the relationship between ecosystem’s surface area and species composition has been documented by several researchers (mehner et al. 2005; go¨tmark et al. 2008). moreover, greater values of habitat richness might indicate a more diverse habitat that could potentially satisfy the requirements for the coexistence of a greater array of species (dauber et al. 2006). overall, the contribution of environmental variables to the description of freshwater ﬁsh species composi- tion was low, in accordance with other studies (genner et al. 2004; zyll de jong et al. 2005). one possible explanation for this could be that some environmental factors, other than those considered here, like ph, alkalinity and substrate type could better reﬂect species community structure (bistoni & hued 2002; hobæk et al. 2002). however, this seems unlikely, as genner et al. (2004) and zyll de jong et al. (2005) who examined the effect of a range of different environmental (e.g., water chemistry) on freshwater species composition reached similar con- clusions. another possible explanation for this out- come could be the potential effects of human modiﬁcations of riparian areas that were not taken into account in this analysis. moreover, the fact that species sampling has been conducted during different temporal scales might have contributed to the low explanatory ability of environmental variables. factors the role of dispersal limitation was found to be more prominent than that of environmental heteroge- neity, suggesting that dispersal barriers prevented the ubiquitous establishment of ﬁsh species assemblages throughout greece. these ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies on freshwater ﬁshes (genner et al. 2004; zyll de jong et al. 2005). terrestrial landscape could thus act as a dispersal barrier for freshwater ﬁsh. as the latter are unable to disperse through sea, they are restricted to hydrographical networks of drainage basins (reyjol et al. 2007). their distribution through these networks is dependent upon their geomorpho- logic evolution thus, the structure of the landscape matrix as this has evolved through time. in other words, the possible existence of ecosystems with favourable environmental conditions did not necessar- ily involve the establishment of all species, as random or deliberate events never allowed them to reach these ecosystems. this indicates that, for species that overcome mountain or marine barriers, existing envi- ronmental conditions allow their populations to estab- lish. our analysis at the ﬁner scale of the occurring ‘biogeographical zones’ reached similar conclusions. more speciﬁcally, the environmental variables that 376 more signiﬁcantly correlated with species composition were for the ‘northern’ group, surface area and altitude, while for the ‘western’ they reﬂected land- scape diversity (prd and sidi). high diversity values might indicate a more diverse habitat that as men- tioned above, could satisfy the needs for the coexis- tence of more species (dauber et al. 2006). this ﬁner scale the results of our analysis at (‘northern’ and ‘western’ groups) further demon- strated that species composition was more strongly affected by dispersal limitation than environmental heterogeneity. the veriﬁcation of this relationship at coarser and ﬁner scales of analysis proves that existing natural barriers in our case, such as pindus range or sea, might be the most effective dispersal barriers but certainly not the only one. previous studies supported that regional scale factors such as natural barriers or glaciation events are likely to determine species distribution, while species that overcome such barriers are more subject to biotic or abiotic inﬂuences (tonn et al. 1990). in this sense, dispersal limitation, species biogeography and natural barriers or unmeasured parameters are those deter- mining community structure more than environmental heterogeneity. theoretical implications the difﬁculty of dispersal might be viewed as the dominant factor of freshwater ﬁsh community struc- ture. such species dispersal from one drainage system to another may be associated with deliberate and accidental events (economidis et al. 2000), emphasis- ing the role of stochasticity. these ﬁndings are in accordance with the dispersal assembly view (hubbell 2001) and are too steep to ﬁt the predictions of niche- based approach. hence, our ﬁndings support that species similarity between sites decreases as mono- tonic function of the geographic distance between sites (jones et al. 2006). according to this view, dispersal limitation may reduce the correspondence between species occurrence and environmental conditions (ozinga et al. 2005). so far, several studies have attempted to analyse the relationship between community structure, environ- mental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation. our study is in the minority of studies where dispersal limitation is more important in shaping community structure. studies on other species, as plants (rossetto et al. 2008), birds (steinitz et al. 2006), marine ﬁsh (whaley et al. 2007) or invertebrates (thompson & townsend 2006), have concluded that species assem- blage composition depends more strongly on the effects of environmental variables than on dispersal limitation. for these species, the landscape matrix is not as strong a limitation to dispersal as in the case of freshwater ﬁshes. our case study highlights the primary role of the landscape matrix – as a barrier to dispersal – in shaping biological communities. perhaps the applicability of the neutral theory in our study depends more strongly on the inhospitability of the landscape matrix, than either on the assumption of species neutrality, or on the stochasticity of demo- graphic events. in conclusion, we found that freshwater ﬁsh com- munities reﬂected more closely the predictions of neutral biodiversity theory than those of niche-based approach, throughout greece and within the two biogeographic areas identiﬁed. this could be attrib- uted to the role of the terrestrial environment (in our case the landscape matrix) as a barrier to the dispersal of these species. the importance of landscape barriers (in coarser scales of analysis) but also this of unmeasured stochastic events (in ﬁner scales of analysis), enhances the role of stochasticity. the factors that are responsible for species distribution in freshwater ecosystems rarely are solely geographic, spatial or biotic. the combination of all these param- eters seems to affect freshwater ﬁsh community structure, with natural barriers, species biogeography and dispersal limitation playing a more signiﬁcant role than environmental heterogeneity. acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the ﬁnancial support from the general secretariat of research and
