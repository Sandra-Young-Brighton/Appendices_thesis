jung- wirth et al. 1998; lucas & baras 2001). other direct effects the volume of available habitat and the prevention of gene ﬂow between conspeciﬁc ﬁsh populations. consequently, many ﬁsh species are conﬁned to small and often isolated habitat patches that can sustain only a limited number of individuals (pringle 1997; collares et al. include the reduction of 2002). such populations generally face appreciable risk from the effects of environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and reduced genetic diver- sity (meffe & carroll 1997). fortunately, the preservation of river connectivity has become increasingly important all over the world and has led to the design and implementation of different ﬁsh pass facilities that should allow ﬁsh to swim past otherwise impassable river barriers (clay 1995; cowx & welcomme 1998; jungwirth et al. 1998). however, studies of ﬁsh pass perform- ance have demonstrated a highly variable effective- ness (jungwirth et al. 1998; stuart & mallen-cooper 1999; bunt et al. 2000) and have often only focused on commercially interesting species such as salmo- nids (clay 1995; aarestrup et al. 2003; gowans et al. 2003). this provides only limited insight for nonsalmonid ﬁshes because they differ greatly in their abilities to pass physical and hydraulic 20 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00117.x obstructions. in general, if a major loss of global ﬁsh biodiversity is to be avoided, more information on the effectiveness of different types of ﬁsh passes for a wide number of species (particularly nonsal- monids) must be gained rapidly (clay 1995; lucas & baras 2001). the objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of a pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass for three nonsalmonid ﬁsh species, bullhead (cottus gobio), roach (rutilus rutilus) and perch (perca ﬂuviatilis), in a regulated lowland river in flanders (northern part of belgium). this information is especially valuable for the bullhead, because during the last few decades this species has become endangered in several areas like switzerland, the netherlands and flanders as a result of habitat fragmentation and habitat destruction (lelek 1987; utzinger et al. 1998; vandelannoote et al. 1998). the remaining populations often are very small and characterised by reduced levels of genetic diver- sity and ﬁtness (knaepkens et al. 2002; knapen et al. 2003). an important management strategy to increase the size and the range of these populations and to minimise or even reverse further genetic deterioration, is the reduction of river fragmentation by effectively functioning ﬁsh pass (knaepkens et al. 2004b). however, detailed information concerning the effectiveness of ﬁsh passes for bullheads is still very limited, although highly indispensable for devel- oping sound conservation programmes. facilities fish pass effectiveness for bullhead, perch and roach materials and methods this study was conducted in the laarse beek, a regulated lowland river of the river scheldt watershed (belgium). a weir maintaining a difference in water level of 1æ0 m and supplying neighbouring ﬁsh ponds with river water, was equipped with a pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass in 1998 to improve conditions for upstream ﬁsh migration. this ﬁsh pass is 25 m long with a gradient of approximately 4% and consists of a series of eight pools in steps leading from the foot of the obstruction to the top (fig. 1). stones (broken rock) are present within pools 1–7 (p1–p7). to evaluate ﬁsh pass effectiveness for bullhead, perch and roach, a river stretch of 110 m downstream and 470 m upstream the weir was subdivided into 10 m sections (fig. 1) and sampled with electric ﬁshing gear (electracatch wfc7 (electrocatch international ltd, wolverhampton, uk), 150 v dc). captured bullheads were subdivided into three treatment groups: individ- uals caught in sections 1–11 (group 1), in p1–p8 (group 2) and in sections 12–58 (group 3). after marking (see below), bullheads from group 1 were released in the section in which they were initially caught, while individuals from groups 2 and 3 were released in section 9 (downstream the ﬁsh pass). however, captured roach and perch were only subdivided into two treatment groups as no individuals of either species were caught in the ﬁsh pass. individuals caught in sections 1–11 were assigned to group a and ﬁsh from sections 12–58 were fish pass o3 p4 o4 p5 o5 downstream p3 o2 p2 o1 p1 9 10 11 p6 o6 12 p7 o7 p8 upstream 58 weir direction of current (a) 1 10 m (b) p5 o4 p4 fig. 1. (a) the ﬁsh pass in the laarse beek is composed of eight pools (p1–p8), each dropping in elevation by 0æ1–0æ2 m. seven concrete weirs (overﬂows; o1-o7) with a v-shaped notch separate the pools and control the water level in each pool and the water discharge in the ﬁsh pass. the length and width dimensions (m) of the pools are: p1 ¼ 2æ3 and 2æ4; p2 ¼ 3æ0 and 2æ4; p3 ¼ 3æ3 and 2æ4; p4 ¼ 3æ0 and 2æ5; p5 ¼ 4æ0 and 2æ5; p6 ¼ 4æ0 and 3æ0; p7 ¼ 3æ4 and 3æ0; p8 ¼ 2æ0 and 3æ2. the water depth within each pool varies between 0æ10 and 0æ35 m. different sized stones (broken rock; between 0æ16 m · 0æ14 m · 0æ15 m and 0æ67 m · 0æ35 m · 0æ30 m) are present within p1–p7, although their amount and conﬁguration differs between the pools, i.e., the bottom of p1–p5 is largely covered with stones (between 80% and 90%), while in p6 and p7, <50% of the bottom is covered. also, in contrast to o1–o5, no stones are present immediately upstream and downstream from o6 and o7. the study area downstream (length: 110 m) and upstream (length: 470 m) of the weir was partitioned into 10 m sections (1– 58) during electroﬁshing.

goldsmith et al. 2003). this method involves injection of a small volume of a biocompatible ﬂuor- escent elastomer material through a very ﬁne-gauge needle. bullheads were marked individually by combi- ning different marking colours (red, yellow, green and orange) and places (left and right, posterior and anterior on the ventral, not pigmented side of the tail). on the contrary, perch and roach were marked at the base of the caudal ﬁn with only one colour (group a: green; group b: yellow). following capture and handling, individu- als of all three species were allowed to recuperate for 2–3 h in large tubs with stream water, before being released into the river. when tagged individuals were recaptured in subsequent sampling sessions, their location (section) was noted and they were released at the last site of recapture. in addition, if marked perch or roach were recaptured for the ﬁrst time upstream from the ﬁsh pass, an additional tag (colour: red) was added to the caudal ﬁn. this allowed us to discriminate between tagged individuals that were recaptured upstream for the ﬁrst time or recaptured repeatedly. finally, during all sampling sessions, the water velocity in each overﬂow (o1–o7) was measured at the apex of the v-shaped notch (an important place for ﬁsh passage, especially for benthic species like the bullhead) using a portable ﬂowmeter (marsh-mcbirney flo-mate model 2000; marsh-mcbirney inc., frederick, md, usa). statistical comparisons of the proportions of recap- tured bullheads of groups i, ii and iii in the ﬁsh pass during the different sampling periods and comparisons of the proportions of tagged perch and roach of groups a and b that crossed the ﬁsh pass were conducted by fisher’s exact tests. to test for signiﬁcant differences in water velocity levels among the overﬂows of the ﬁsh pass, a one-way analysis of variance (anova) and a posthoc tukey test were carried out. the statistical tests were performed using statxact (mehta & patel 1995) and statistica (statsoft 1994) with an a-level of 0æ05, unless stated otherwise. results bullhead a total of 1270 bullheads (group 1: 811; group 2: 152; group 3: 307) was caught and marked individually during periods i, ii and iii (table 1). their length varied between 33 and 99 mm. of those ﬁsh, 479 (38%) were recaptured at least once during the whole study period, although none in the study area upstream the ﬁsh pass. marked bullheads were always recap- tured downstream or within the ﬁsh pass. in the latter case, they were found in the ﬁrst six pools (fig. 2). in p7 and p8 however, tagged bullheads were not observed in any sampling period. although the marked bullheads observed in the ﬁsh pass were from groups 1, 2 and 3 (table 1; fig. 2), there was a signiﬁcant difference in the proportion of individuals from these three groups in each sampling test, all p < 0æ020). after period (fisher’s exact bonferroni correction (a ¼ 0æ025), the proportion of individuals from group 2 was always signiﬁcantly higher than the proportion of groups 1 and 3 in periods ii, iii and v (fisher’s exact test, all p < 0æ018). in table 1. number of individually marked and recaptured bullheads of the different treatment groups (1, 2 and 3) in the different sampling periods (i, ii, iii, iv, v and vi). marked recaptured period 1 2 3 tot d-1 d-2 d-3 tot tot1x p-1 p-2 p-3 tot tot1x u-1 u-2 u-3 tot tot1x i ii iii iv v vi total 362 291 158 0 0 0 811 83 38 31 0 0 0 152 164 57 86 0 0 0 307 609 386 275 0 0 0 1270 0 95 128 62 67 66 417 0 12 16 7 7 13 55 0 25 33 8 18 17 101 0 132 177 77 92 96 573 0 132 138 59 56 48 433 0 0 3 5 2 2 12 0 13 13 5 6 4 41 0 6 2 5 2 2 17 0 19 18 15 10 8 70 0 19 11 9 6 1 46 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 d-1, d-2 and d-3, individuals of group 1, 2 or 3 recaptured in the downstream area;

table 2a). these proportions however did not differ signiﬁcantly (fisher’s exact test, fi ¼ 2; p ¼ 0æ23). the 16 perch that successfully crossed the ﬁsh pass, covered distances between 40 and 250 m and had a length between 70 and 149 mm (fig. 3b). size classes <70 mm or >149 mm of group b were never observed in this upstream area. 23 knaepkens et al.

caught and marked during periods i, ii and iii (table 2b). the length of these ﬁsh varied between 80 and 189 mm for group a and between 90 and 299 mm for group b (fig. 3a). of the 203 tagged roach, 58 (29%) were recaptured at least once in the area upstream the ﬁsh pass: 0 from group a (0%) and 58 from group b (35%; table 2b). these proportions were signiﬁcantly different (fish- er’s exact test, fi ¼ 24; p < 0æ0001). the 58 roach that successfully crossed the ﬁsh pass, covered distances between 30 and 460 m and had a length between 100 and 249 mm (fig. 3b). the 24 (<100 mm) and largest smallest (>249 mm) size classes of group b were never observed in this upstream area. water velocity in the ﬁsh pass the velocity of the water in the seven overﬂows of the ﬁsh pass differed signiﬁcantly

in all the other down- stream overﬂows (o1–o5; posthoc tukey test, all p < 0æ0002). in the latter, the velocity varied between )1, while in o6 and o7, it varied 0æ01 and 0æ21 m s between 0æ31 and 0æ62 m s )1. discussion fish pass effectiveness for bullhead our results suggest that bullheads were not able to successfully cross the pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass in the laarse beek. tagged bullheads were only observed in the ﬁrst six pools of the ﬁsh pass. a possible cause that prevented bullheads from fully ascending the ﬁsh pass is the presence of excessive water velocities. the bullheads’ swimming ability is generally considered to be relatively limited. for example, its critical swim- ming speed (ucrit) only varies between 0æ15– )1 (pavlov 1989). water velocity levels in 0æ34 m s it )1 and 0æ31–0æ44 m s o6 and o7 of the ﬁsh pass under study varied between )1, respectively, 0æ42–0æ62 m s and tagged bullheads were never observed in the adjacent pools (p7 and p8). consequently, is tempting to suggest that supercritical water velocities in o6 (and o7) prevented free upstream passage of this benthic species. this hypothesis would also be in agreement with other studies that demonstrated that free upstream ﬁsh passage in ﬁshways often is prevented because of excessive water velocities (clay 1995). nevertheless, using measurements like ucrit to estimate the swimming performance of ﬁsh under natural conditions in ﬁsh passes is contestable. on the one hand, ucrit values, which are generally based on forced swimming performance data of conﬁned ﬁsh, may underestimate voluntary locomotory capacity and behaviour of ﬁsh in the wild (e.g., because of behavioural refusal of ﬁsh to swim to complete physiological exhaustion in conﬁnement; bunt 1999; peake 2004). on the other hand, as ﬁsh passes operate by utilising the shear stress imparted by obstacles to the water ﬂow to reduce water velocity, they are inherently turbulent environments, though to varying degrees. these environments increase drag forces on ﬁsh swimming and may also cause difﬁculties in orientation for some ﬁsh species, inhibiting upstream progress through the ﬁsh pass. consequently, swim- ming performance data like ucrit, which usually apply only to laminar ﬂow conditions, may severely over- estimate the performance of ﬁsh in ﬁsh passes under natural conditions (lucas & baras 2001). clearly, further research under controlled laboratory and ﬁeld conditions is necessary to evaluate in detail the bullheads’ physical ability to negotiate hydraulic conditions of ﬁsh passes (e.g., water velocities, turbulence, back currents, disorienting ﬂows). in addition, such experiments may also assess whether low-velocity boundary layers occur towards the bot- tom of ﬁsh passes (bunt 1999) and whether this affects the passage success of bottom-dwelling species such as the bullhead. an alternative explanation for the absence of tagged bullheads in the upstream study area is that none of them had the intention to fully ascend the ﬁsh pass. for example, previous studies suggested that ﬁsh passes such as by-pass channels may be used as habitat by this benthic species (although the effective- ness of these constructions as a ﬁsh pass facility for the bullhead remained unclear because of methodological constraints like ineffective capture techniques or limited sample sizes; jungwirth 1996; jansen et al. 1999). similarly in the laarse beek, the pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass may provide suitable residence and spawning habitats for the bullhead because of the presence of stones. hard structures like stones are not only used by the bullhead as shelter, they also provide very suitable fish pass effectiveness for bullhead, perch and roach spawning substrates (morris 1955; smyly 1957; korolev 1991; knaepkens et al. 2004c). the latter was demonstrated by the presence of bullhead egg- clusters attached to stones within the ﬁsh pass during the spawning season (g. knaepkens, unpublished data). if nevertheless, it is very unlikely that none of the tagged bullheads had the intention to cross the ﬁsh pass. first of all, artiﬁcially displaced bullheads often have the tendency to go back to their home range (homing behaviour; smyly 1957; lucas & baras 2001). consequently, the ﬁsh pass had been effective, we would expect to ﬁnd bullheads of group 3 in the upstream study area. also for other ﬁsh species, upstream movement through a ﬁsh pass has been observed after (artiﬁcial or natural) downstream displacement across a migration barrier (lucas & baras 2001). in addition, this homing behaviour may also explain why bullheads of group 2 were relatively abundant (compared with groups 1 and 3) in the ﬁsh pass during the different sampling periods. secondly, there is accumulating evidence that beside a static group, i.e., ﬁsh that restrict their movements within an a certain river stretch, stream ﬁsh populations (includ- ing members of the family cottidae) often also comprise a mobile group, namely ﬁsh that move frequently and sometimes for long distances (smith- son & johnston 1999; knaepkens et al. 2004a; schmetterling & adams 2004; knaepkens et al. 2005). this mobile component is considered to provide ﬁsh species an opportunity to assess alternat- ive habitats, (re)colonise river stretches and/or main- tain gene ﬂow over the range of a population and between conspeciﬁc populations (stott 1967; smith- son & johnston 1999; larson et al. 2002). similarly in the present study, there were indications that treatment group 1 consisted of both relatively static and mobile individuals: although on successive sampling occa- sions more than 70% of the recaptured bullheads were observed in their initial or neighbouring tagging site, some ﬁsh crossed relatively large distances (30– 110 m; data not shown) and were even observed in different pools of the ﬁsh pass. it is not unlikely that these bullheads had the intention to explore the upstream study area, although were not able to fully ascend the ﬁsh pass because of its hydraulic limita- tions. finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that exposure of the tagged bullheads to an electric current during sampling affected our results. several studies have reported that electric ﬁshing may inﬂict some level of harm to ﬁshes, including external and internal injuries (e.g., haemorrhages in the musculature and spinal fractures; snyder 2003) and physiological and behavioural disturbances (e.g., reduced swimming altered movement patterns; mitton & stamina, 25 knaepkens et al. mcdonald 1994; snyder 2003; schreer et al. 2004). nevertheless, as the bullhead is a relatively small species and only constant direct current (dc) had been applied during electric sampling, internal and external harmful effects due to electroﬁshing can be considered to be minimal or even absent (no external injuries were observed during our study; snyder 2003; young & schmetterling 2004). fish pass effectiveness for perch and roach unlike bullhead, 8% of the tagged perch and 29% of the tagged roach were recaptured in the upstream study area. water velocities in the different over- ﬂows of the ﬁsh pass did not exceed the swimming abilities of perch (ucrit ¼ 0æ56–1æ26 m s )1; pavlov et al. 1972; wolter & arlinghaus 2003) and roach (ucrit ¼ 0æ91–1æ22 m s )1; wolter & arlinghaus 2003) and this probably explains their full ascend. similarly, showed that water velocity levels within pool-and-weir ﬁsh passes and also other types of ﬁsh passes like by-pass channels often are no obstacle to upstream passage of perch and roach (e.g., prignon et al. 1998; travade et al. 1998). previous studies for both species, only individuals of group b, i.e., ﬁsh that were initially caught upstream from the weir and displaced downstream after tagging, were recap- tured in the upstream study area. a possible explan- ation may be the difference in sample size between groups a and b. compared with group b, the chance that a perch or a roach of group a being recaptured is six and three times smaller respectively. an additional explanation may be that mainly ﬁsh of group b had the tendency to cross the ﬁsh pass and to go back to their initial place of residence. individuals of both species may have a home range (i.e., a well-deﬁned space where they restrict their activities) and homing beha- viour translocation or natural displacement (high ﬂoods) has been demonstrated in these species (worthington 1950; stott et al. 1963; champion & swain 1974; willemsen 1977; kipling & le cren 1984). however, individuals of group a were released into their natural home range after marking and it is therefore not unlikely that many of these individuals had no tendency to move upstream and pass the ﬁsh pass. following artiﬁcial nevertheless, not all perch and roach of group b were observed in the river area upstream from the ﬁsh pass. one explanation may be that a proportion crossed the ﬁsh pass but was never resighted because their chance of recapture was limited because of a restricted sample size. for example, the chance of recapturing tagged perch <70 mm and >149 mm or roach <100 and >249 mm is 14 and seven times smaller, respectively, compared with the intermediate size 26 that not all classes. furthermore, as perch and roach are able to cross distances of several hundred metres to a few kilometres (baade & fredrich 1998; lucas & baras 2001), tagged individuals of both species may also have left the 470 m long upstream study area. on the other hand, individuals of group b were also recaptured in the downstream study area during every sampling session. consequently, an additional explanation may be that translocated perch and roach returned to the upstream river area. similarly, move- ment studies of many freshwater ﬁsh, including perch and roach, demonstrated that not all artiﬁcially of naturally displaced ﬁsh returned to their initial location of capture (stott et al. 1963; kipling & le cren 1984; halvorsen & stabell 1990; lucas & baras 2001). several authors attributed this to motivational differ- ences between individuals because of the occurrence of a stationary and mobile component within a ﬁsh population (i.e., the nonmobile part of the population returns to their home ranges while the more mobile ﬁsh, which are not attached to any particular part of the river, stay where they were put or explore the new environment; stott et al. 1963; halvorsen & stabell 1990). further experimental research is however necessary to validate whether this (or an alternative) hypothesis applies to perch and roach (of group b), two species that also consist of stationary and mobile components within populations (stott 1961; williams 1965; stott 1967; bruylants et al. 1986). conservation and management implications to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies evaluating ﬁsh pass effectiveness for the bullhead (see also jungwirth 1996 and jansen et al. 1999). although it describes a situation that is relatively site speciﬁc (as all ﬁsh passes are), lessons learned from the assessment of bullhead behaviour at the pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass in the laarse beek may also be applicable to other ﬁsh passes that are already built or are to be built to pass this species. unlike perch and roach, our results strongly suggest that bullhead is not able to fully ascend the ﬁsh pass in the laarse beek because of supercritical water velo- cities in o6 and o7. free passage is however of vital importance for the long-term survival of endangered bullhead populations (knaepkens et al. 2004b). to reduce the water velocity in o6 and o7, several management strategies are possible. for example, stones may be placed immediately upstream and downstream from both overﬂows, thereby breaking the water current and creating opportunities for the bottom-dwelling bullhead to swim and hide while passing in the upstream direction. in fact, this strategy has recently been implemented by local ﬁshery managers and resulted in reduced water velocity levels )1) and o7 (<0æ23 m s )1; however, in o6 (<0æ18 m s the water velocity in o1–o5 remained relatively low; g. knaepkens, unpublished data). alternatively, the current pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass with v-shaped over- ﬂows may be modiﬁed, or replaced by a ﬁsh pass with vertical slot bafﬂes. these vertical slots allow suc- cessful passage of both pelagic and bottom-dwelling species, as ﬁsh are able to pass through the ﬁsh pass at any depth and a large variety of water velocities may be created (clay 1995). for example, a water velocity )1 at the surface of a vertical slot ﬁsh pass of 1æ6 m s )1 at the bottom, a velocity may be lowered to 0æ2 m s that benthic ﬁsh like the bullhead are able to negotiate, by increasing the roughness of the ﬁsh pass with rocks and stones (gebler 1991). stuart & berghuis (2002) showed that the modiﬁcation of a pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass to a vertical-slot design increased the number of species, even allowing many benthic species to successfully pass the ﬁsh pass. a third option is the replacement of the pool-and-weir ﬁsh pass by a nature- like bypass channel, i.e., a bypass system that resembles the natural stream with regard to morphol- ogy, substrate composition and hydraulic conditions. these bypass channels often allow passage of all occurring ﬁsh species, including those with limited swimming abilities (eberstaller et al. 1998). regardless of the chosen strategy, regular monit- oring of the effectiveness of the modiﬁed facility for all resident ﬁsh species is necessary. besides mark– recapture approaches, electronic techniques including radio-telemetry (minimum ﬁsh size ± 12 cm) and/or passive integrated transponders (pits; minimum ﬁsh size ± 5 cm; lucas & baras 2000) may also be used for such evaluations. a major advantage of these techniques is that it eliminates the need to recapture tagged ﬁsh as they can be tracked by using aerial antennas (lucas & baras 2000) or underwater pit tag detection antennas placed at the entrance and exit of a ﬁsh pass (lucas et al. 1999). however, the efﬁciency of the latter is not yet clear for benthic species like the bullhead and should be determined ﬁrst. resumen 1. desde agosto del 2002 hasta abril del 2003, evaluamos la eﬁcacia de un paso de peces tipo ‘‘pool-and-weir’’ para cottus gobio, perca ﬂuviatilis y rutilus rutilus en el rı´o regulado laarse beek (be´lgica). esta informacio´n es especialmente relevante para c. gobio ya que durante las ultimas de´cadas, esta especie esta siendo amenazada como resultado de la fragmen- tacio´n y destruccio´n del ha´bitat en regiones tales como suiza, holanda y flandes. 2. los peces fueron capturados con pesca ele´ctricas tanto aguas abajo (i.e., 110 m), y aguas arriba (i.e., 470 m) como dentro del fish pass effectiveness for bullhead, perch and roach paso de peces. en total, 1270 individuos de c. gobio, 209 de p. ﬂuviatilis y 203 de r. rutilus fueron colectados, marcados con etiquetas de implante visible (vie) y soltados aguas abajo del paso de peces. cuando los individuos marcados fueron re- capturados en sesiones de muestreos subsecuentes, su localiza- cio´n fue anotada y entonces soltados en el u´ ltimo lugar de re- captura. durante todas las sesiones de muestreos, la velocidad del agua en el ﬂujo del paso de peces fue medida en el ve´rtice de la da´rsena que es un lugar importante para el paso de los peces, especialmente para las especies bento´nicas como c. gobio. 3. nuestros resultados sugieren que el paso de los peces es ineﬁciente para c. gobio ya que ninguno de los 1270 individuos marcados fue re-capturado aguas arriba. estos fallos probable- )1) mente se deben a la excesiva velocidad del agua (>0æ40 m s en el paso de peces. por otro lado, el 8% de los individuos marcados de p. ﬂuviatilis y el 29% de los individuos marcados de r. rutilus fueron re-capturados aguas arriba del a´rea de estudio. las velocidades en diferentes ﬂujos de agua a trave´s del paso de peces no excedio´ la habilidad natatoria de p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus y esto probablemente explica su ascenso. 4. proponemos estrategias de gestio´ n que permitan el paso aguas arriba de c. gobio en el paso de peces estudiado. acknowledgements we thank l. bruyndoncx, p. scheys and all other
