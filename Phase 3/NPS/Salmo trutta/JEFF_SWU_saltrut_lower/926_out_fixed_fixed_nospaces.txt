publication april 20, 2011 abstract – nonnative parasites have the potential to detrimentally affect naı¨ve hosts, resulting in negative consequences for their growth, condition and energetics. here, the effect of the introduced parasitic nematode philometroides sanguineus on crucian carp carassius carassius populations in england was investigated. populations of c. carassius populations are increasingly spatially restricted in england and under increasing threat from habitat loss and hybridisation. parasite prevalence across 6 infected populations was <27% and, generally, there was no signiﬁcant relationship between levels of infection and ﬁsh length and age. parasite abundance ranged between 1 and 8 nematodes and was not signiﬁcantly related to ﬁsh length and age. comparison of the growth, body weight and condition, and energy reserves between infected and noninfected c. carassius revealed infection did not incur signiﬁcant detrimental impacts on these parameters. whilst this suggests that infection had only minimal impacts on the examined host ﬁsh, this may have been a consequence of a low proportion of ﬁsh <100 mm in samples (i.e., size- selective effects) and some tests did suffer from low statistical power because of, for example, unbalanced sample sizes. it does, however, suggest that p. sanguineus may not be a major threat to the status of these c. carassius populations and infection by introduced parasites may not always incur signiﬁcant impacts in naı¨ve ﬁshes. key words: philometroides sanguineus; carassius carassius; parasite prevalence; parasite abundance introduction the introduction of alien species into new ecosystems is a major ecological issue that can have profound effects on biodiversity (rahel & olden 2008). an inherent and persistent risk associated with such introductions is the concomitant release of alien pathogens that may infect naı¨ve hosts in the receiving area (peeler et al. 2011). this is particularly concerning in aquatic environments where disease transfer has led to serious and irreversible effects upon native communities, including ﬁsh, such as the introduction of gyrodactylus salaris into norway that caused declines in native atlantic salmon salmo_salar populations (johnsen & jensen 1988). despite these apparent risks, not all alien pathogens may have obvious detrimental effects on naı¨ve hosts and popu- lations, although this may be related to difﬁculties in the measurement and evaluation of sub-lethal effects in wild populations. consequently, the impact of many introduced parasites on native host populations remains unclear and requires clariﬁcation (kennedy 1994; blanc 1997; hedrick 1998). correspondence: j. robert britton, centre for conservation ecology and environmental sciences, school of applied sciences, bournemouth university, poole, dorset bh12 5bb, uk. e-mail: rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk 598 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00509.x for the introduction of alien ﬁsh pathogens is generally accidental, resulting from aquaculture activities such as ﬁsh imports and subsequent in-country movements (kirk 2003; gozlan et al. 2009; peeler et al. 2011). the accidental nature of parasite release and their subsequent high potential rapid dissemination through ﬁsh stocking activities or water transfer means their distribution and dispersal is difﬁcult to regulate and manage (hickley & chare 2004). the precaution- ary approach is usually adopted for the risk manage- ment of unintentional alien introductions (convention on biological diversity 2010) and is highly applicable to alien pathogens. this is because studies on their role in structuring native ﬁsh populations are limited, being generally restricted to those pathogens that have sudden or obvious impacts on host populations (e.g., mortality) (gozlan et al. 2009). consequently, there is a paucity of knowledge on many introduced ﬁsh pathogens, and in such cases, precaution has to be used to underpin control measures to protect native aquatic environments rather than using evidence-based science (hickley 2009). in england, crucian carp carassius carassius is native to central and southern regions but is increas- ingly threatened by factors including habitat loss and loss of genetic integrity through hybridisation with introduced ﬁshes (wheeler 2000; ha¨nﬂing et al. 2005). although the species is not threatened across their entire range, recent work has emphasised the requirement to conserve their remaining populations in england (e.g., copp et al. 2008; tarkan et al. 2009) and so the species increasingly appears in regional biodiversity action plans (bap; e.g., copp & sayer 2010; lambeth council 2010). however, such con- servation efforts may be compromised by infections of introduced pathogens (lilley et al. 1997; kirk 2003). literature suggests that the parasitic nematode philo- metroides sanguineus represents an additional pressure on their populations. this parasite, speciﬁc to ﬁsh of the genus carassius (moravec 1994), is transmitted to c. carassius via ingestion of free-living parasitised copepods, (yashchuk 1971; moravec 1994; anderson 2000; wang 2002). male and unfertilised female nematodes initially remain localised on the wall of the swim bladder and cause little obvious damage. after copulation, however, female worms migrate through the musculature into the ﬁns from late summer, with intensities increasing during autumn and winter, and they increase in length to a maximum of 50 mm (wierzbicki 1960). they remain in the ﬁns until temperatures increase in spring when they liberate their larvae through the process of ‘functional bursting’ (yashchuk 1971; moravec 1994). thus, the migration of gravid females into the ﬁns and the subsequent emergence of larvae have the potential to cause substantial tissue damage and their development the intermediate host philometroides sanguineus in crucian carp in england, may make substantial energetic demands on the host. their effects are generally more obvious in smaller hosts, with evidence of gross abnormalities in ﬁsh measuring <60 mm (vasilkov 1983; moravec 1994). by contrast, males remain on the swim bladder at lengths below 3 mm and do not result in any gross pathological damage. the parasite is known to infect at least seven c. carassius popula- tions. whilst it is believed to be an introduction to the parasitic fauna of british freshwater ﬁsh, the source of the introduction remains unclear. the introduction of p. sanguineus to other countries has been associated with movements of infected goldﬁsh carassius aura- tus l. within the ornamental ﬁsh industry (moravec 1994) and imports of infected cyprinid ﬁsh for aquaculture (moravec & cervinka 2005). whilst the pathology of infection in c. carassius is now being increasingly understood (williams et al. in press), it is not yet known how this translates into sub- lethal impacts on ecological parameters such as growth, condition and energetics. yet, these are crucial data for assessing the consequences of infection for parasitised individuals and would assist understanding of whether infection further threatens c. carassius populations in england. consequently, the aim of the study was to quantify, using the p. sanguineus: c. carassius para- site: host system, the ecological consequences of infection by an introduced parasite on a naı¨ve ﬁsh through evaluation of parasite prevalence and abun- dance, and the associated impacts on the infected host ﬁsh when compared to their noninfected con-speciﬁcs. materials and methods sample collection samples of ﬁsh from c. carassius populations known to be infected with p. sanguineus were initially collected from ﬁve lakes in england between october 2003 and may 2004. this timing was to coincide with the peak period for the presence of mature female nematodes within the ﬁns and the period during which the host energetic demand may be at its greatest (growth and development of the mature female). following capture with a 25- and 50-m micromesh seine net, samples were taken to the laboratory where they were euthanised by lethal anaesthesia (5% w ⁄ v benzocaine), measured (fork length, l, mm) and weighed (w, nearest 0.001 g). fins were examined under a low power dissection microscope for the presence of mature female parasites; where detected, their size, position and location was noted. an ex- and internal parasitological examination was then under- taken to identify the presence of any other infections that may have confounded subsequent analyses that assessed the status of infected and noninfected ﬁsh; 599 pegg et al. in all cases, there were no other signiﬁcant infections sample of c. carassius was detected. a further obtained from a newly detected site in march 2005 (where all ﬁsh were removed following pond draining) and then from site 5 (cf. table 1) in april 2010; these ﬁsh were euthanised in the laboratory and then analysed. in both cases, the data collected were as previously described but with the additional collection of scales to enable subsequent age estimations, and the dissection and weighing (nearest 0.001g) of the gonad and liver of each ﬁsh. it should be noted that in all cases, water names and locations cannot be provided for reasons of business conﬁdentially. data analysis for the samples collected in 2003 and 2004, data were analysed for mean lengths (±standard deviation, sd) of all ﬁsh, noninfected and infected ﬁsh, parasite prevalence (proportion of infected ﬁsh, %), parasite abundance (number of parasites per ﬁsh) and condition of individual ﬁsh (k, where k = 100 · w ⁄ l3, where length was measured in cm). mean lengths were compared between the groups (infected vs. noninfected ﬁsh) using anova, and differences in condition between the groups were analysed using ancova where the allometric effect of body length was controlled as a covariate. in these and all subsequent ancova tests, outputs were the signiﬁcance of the difference between the group means, the equality of variances, homogeneity of regression slopes, partial eta squared (·100) and posthoc power analysis. differences between group means were assessed at a = 0.05. equality of variances was measured using the levene’s test where p > 0.05 indicated equal variances between the groups. homogeneity of the regression slopes was used to ensure there was no interaction between the covariate (ﬁsh length) and the groups (infected and noninfected ﬁsh), with this indicated when p > 0.05. partial eta squared (gp2) was used to indicate group differences that were independent of sample size (effects size), where increased values indicated a greater group effect. the posthoc power analysis indicated the power of the test to detect a statistical difference between the groups. these tests were completed in spss v. 16.0 (ibm corporation 2010, somers, ny, usa). for the samples collected in march 2005 and april 2010, the effects of infection on the parameters of growth (somatic and gonad), body weight, condition (k) and energy reserves were also assessed. where sample sizes were large, sub-samples of ﬁsh were used to derive these parameters; these comprised of an equal number of infected and noninfected ﬁsh to provide balanced samples for statistical testing. determining somatic growth required the age of ﬁsh to be initially assessed by analysing scales under a projecting micro- scope (·20) and counting the number of annuli. fish growth was then compared between the groups of noninfected and infected ﬁsh by comparing residuals of length-age regressions to examine differences between the two groups. this method was used because of statistical complications resulting from reliance on back-calculated lengths, i.e., repeated measurements from individual ﬁsh. to estimate mean fork length and identify differences in growth between infected and noninfected ﬁsh, linear regressions of back-calculated fork length on age were completed and residuals stored. species-speciﬁc mean residual values, as mean fork length adjusted for age, were then compared between the two groups (anova). gonad growth (females only) was assessed through gonad weight and the gonado- somatic index (gsi), calculated by (gonad weight ⁄ somatic weight) · 100, where somatic weight was total weight minus gonad weight. energetic reserves were assessed using liver weight and the hepatic-somatic index (hsi), calculated from (liver weight ⁄ body weight) · 100, where body weight was total weight minus liver weight. on completion, their data were tested for normality and log-transformed where neces- sary before ancova models were constructed to test the effects of infection on the parameters by controlling the allometric effect of ﬁsh length. these models were only deemed valid when the assumptions were met that variances were equal between the groups (levene’s test) and there was no interaction between the covariate and the groups (homogeneity of the regression slope). where these assumptions were not met, then the output table 1. sample size, parasite

and the relationship between that parameter and ﬁsh length was not signiﬁcant, a mann–whitney test was used to test for signiﬁcant differences between the groups. results infections of p. sanguineus were present in all of the initial ﬁve samples of the c. carassius populations sampled in 2003 and 2004 (table 1). parasite prevalence ranged between 9 and 21%, and parasite abundance between 1 and 4 nematodes (mean intensity 1–1.9 worms per host) (table 1). in all except site 3, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the length of infected and noninfected ﬁsh (table 1); in site 3, infected ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly larger. ancova was used to test for differences in condition between infected and nonin- fected ﬁsh in each site and revealed differences were not signiﬁcant in sites 2–5 (table 2). whilst the power of these tests were all <0.8, effect sizes (gp2) were generally low, indicating a relativelysmall inﬂuence of infection on condition. the exception was site 1 where there was a signiﬁcant difference in condition between infected and noninfected ﬁsh (table 2). however, pairwise philometroides sanguineus in crucian carp comparisons based on estimated marginal means and adjusted for multiple comparisons (bonferroni) revealed that it was the infected ﬁsh that were signiﬁcantly higher in condition (infected: 1.87 ± 0.04, noninfected: 1.63 ± 0.02; p < 0.01). the sample of c. carassius collected in april 2010 from site 5 (cf. table 1) comprised 221 ﬁsh of which 45 were infected with p. sanguineus (20%), indicating persistence of the parasite approximately 6 years after their initial detection in the site. parasite abundance now ranged between 1 and 4 and the majority of infected ﬁsh were host to only one parasite (73%). scale ageing of 90 ﬁsh (45 infected and 45 randomly selected noninfected ﬁsh) revealed individuals present in both groups between age 0+ and 7+ years. com- parison of their age-adjusted mean lengths (residuals of regression of length on age; anova) showed no difference in mean back-calculated lengths at age noninfected between ﬁsh (f1,88 = 1.19, p > 0.05). in this sub-sample, there was also no signiﬁcant difference in body weight, condition and liver weight between the infected and noninfected groups when the allometric effects of ﬁsh length were controlled (table 3). posthoc power analysis revealed statistical power was <0.8

not signiﬁcant (r2 = 0.21; f1,88 = 3.16, p > 0.05), then a mann–whitney test was used and revealed the effect of infection on hsi was not signiﬁcant (z = )1.662, p > 0.05). the sample collected in march 2005 from the newly detected population provided a total sample size of 828 c. carassius of which 226 were infected with p. sanguineus (27%), with the majority of parasites recorded in the caudal ﬁn. noninfected ﬁsh were between 29 and 206 mm, and infected ﬁsh between 55 and 204 mm; there was no signiﬁcant difference in length between the infected and noninfected groups (anova: f1,826 = 0.06, p > 0.05). regarding parasite abundance, 59% of the infected ﬁsh had only 1 parasite present, with the maximum number recorded in an individual ﬁsh being 8. the relationship between length of infected ﬁsh and parasite abundance was not signiﬁcant (anova: f1,225 = 2.03, p > 0.05). ageing scales from 100 ﬁsh (50 infected, 50 noninfected, both randomly selected) revealed ﬁsh in both groups present at ages 0+ to 5+ years. comparison of their age-adjusted mean lengths (residuals of regression of length on age; anova) showed no difference in mean lengths at age between the groups (f1,98 = 1.29, p > 0.05). there was no signiﬁcant difference in body weight, condition and gonado-somatic index between the groups when the effects of ﬁsh length were controlled in ancova (table 4). whilst posthoc power analysis revealed statistical power in the tests was <0.8, effect sizes (gp2) were low, suggesting a small group effect on the parameters (table 4). discussion parasitism of c. carassius by p. sanguineus resulted in relatively low prevalence (<27%), and the majority of infected ﬁsh had only 1 gravid female in their caudal ﬁn. the outputs of subsequent analyses suggested these infections of p. sanguineus in c. car- assius were insufﬁcient to incur signiﬁcant negative impacts on the growth (somatic and gonad), body weight, condition and energy reserves of infected host ﬁsh. in the context of current conservation threats to populations of c. carassius in england, including habitat loss (copp et al. 2008) and genetic introgres- sion with nonnative cyprinid ﬁshes (ha¨nﬂing et al. 2005), the risk of this parasite causing further damage to threatened populations appears relatively low. our ﬁndings indicate that the disease risk assessment for p. sanguineus in england no longer has to rely on precautionary principles. the data presented here, in conjunction with data from histopathology (williams et al. in press), will enable the development of evidence-based assessment methods for managing risk to native ﬁshes. evidence from this study that the impacts of p. sanguineus on c. carassius are not signiﬁcant does, however, have caveats in relation to statistical power of tests and the size ranges of ﬁsh examined. regarding statistical power, in the ancova tests, the posthoc power analyses indicated relatively low power as a consequence of, for example, unbalanced sample sizes (sites 1–5, sampled in 2003 and 2004). this was, however, partially countered by testing for the effect of group size on the mean differences between the infected and noninfected ﬁsh. these values were generally low, supporting the inference that infection was not having a substantial negative effect on these ﬁsh. these statis- tical issues do, however, indicate the problems that can be encountered when reliant on wild ﬁsh populations for parasite studies where information on sample sizes and the proportion of parasitised ﬁsh are unknown in advance and may be unbalanced. regarding ﬁsh size, previous studies have suggested that gross abnormal- ities from infection by p. sanguineus are most apparent table 4. anova outputs for the site sampled in march 2005

debilitation and mortality in other ﬁsh species as a result of philometrid parasites highlight the susceptibility of juvenile ﬁsh to these nematodes (vasilkov, 1967; sinderman 1987; moravec 1994). the proportion of infected ﬁsh of <60 mm was low in this study and, correspondingly, should samples have comprised a greater proportion of smaller ﬁsh then signiﬁcant impacts may well have been detected. this suggests that future work should concentrate on the impacts of infection in these size classes in conjunction with controlled laboratory experiments that enable greater elucidation of impacts through the elimination of potential confounds and increasing the statistical power of subsequent tests. notwithstanding, in site 5, there was no evidence to suggest that any infection of juvenile c. carassius by p. sanguineus had incurred mortality sufﬁcient to severely inhibit recruitment and threaten the sustainability of their population, as the age structure in 2010 comprised of ﬁsh in age classes between 1 and 7 years, approximately 6 years after their initial detection on the site. the philometrid group of parasites are, however, generally highly pathogenic parasites, responsible for disease outbreaks in both wild and farmed ﬁsh populations (sinderman 1987; moravec 1994). how- ever, there are only limited detailed data available on their prevalence and pathogenicity in the wild (mor- avec 1994, 2006) with little information on their sub- lethal effects (de buron & roumillat 2010). thus, this study represents an important step in better under- standing the impacts of infections of p. sanguineus on naı¨ve hosts. moreover, this study provides context on the issue of introduced parasites on naı¨ve ﬁsh hosts and those in other animal groups. other studies strongly suggest that impacts of introduced parasites are generally severe. for example, the asian ﬁsh tapeworm bothriocephalus acheilognathi, a parasite that has been introduced around the world through the aquaculture trade (salgado-maldonado & pineda- lo`pez 2003), has been responsible for high mortality rates in cultivated cyprinid ﬁsh and has had pathogenic effects in wild populations (bauer et al. 1973; clark- son et al. 1997). the eel swim-bladder nematode, anguillicoloides crassus, introduced from asia into europe, has incurred severe ecological consequences as it has spread rapidly through europe, africa and america (kirk 2003). infections of the european eel anguilla anguilla have severely impaired swim-blad- der function and caused mortalities in populations when in the presence of other stressors (kirk 2003). in other animal groups, parasitism of juvenile ground ﬁnches geospiza fortis in the gala´pagos islands by introduced philornis downsi resulted in increased philometroides sanguineus in crucian carp mortality and was concluded to have the potential to lead to large population declines (huber 2008). implications to have serious ecological in summary, infection by p. sanguineus appeared not for threatened c. carassius populations in england, a contrast with many other introduced parasite-naı¨ve host systems, although further work is necessary to quantify their effects on smaller individuals. this work highlights the need for clear pathological, epidemio- logical and ecological data to evaluate disease risks from introduced parasites. acknowledgements the
