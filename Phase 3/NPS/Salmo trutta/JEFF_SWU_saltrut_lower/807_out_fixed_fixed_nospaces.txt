(2004) found hundreds of dead fishes in inter- mittent reaches of tributaries located in the james river drainage in virginia. although intermittency may create stressful conditions for fishes, many spe- cies exhibit physiological and biological adaptations that aid in their resistance and resilience in these harsh environments (matthews & styron 1981; sch- lossor 1982; magoulick & kobza 2003; hershkovitz & gasith 2013). previous studies have demonstrated that during stream drying, fishes tend to have greater fidelity towards deeper, more complex habitats, which has shown to increase persistence and survival (labbe & fausch 2000; hodges & magoulick 2011). evidence also suggests when fishes encounter unfa- vourable conditions that could negatively affect growth and survival, increased movement into higher quality habitat is often elicited (power 1984; labbe & fausch 2000). movement and dispersal are key responses known to influence recolonisation patterns (adams & warren 2005), population persistence (brown & kodric- brown 1977; scheuer et al. 2003) and community structure (tilman 1994). traditional views on stream fish movement suggested that many fishes follow the ‘restricted movement paradigm’ (rmp), which posits that majority of adult fish in a population remain sed- entary in one particular habitat for most of their lives (gerking 1953). however, as technology and our understanding of life history characteristics have advanced over the years, it has become clear that movement of many fishes has been underestimated due to imperfect study design and data misinterpreta- tion (gowan et al. 1994), as well as biased, distance- weighted movement data (albanese et al. 2003). although results are mixed on restricted movement, recent studies have begun relating movement of stream fishes to numerous biological and environmen- tal cues. these studies have shown that movement may vary depending on life history requirements (schlosser & toth 1984; roberts & angermeier 2007), presence of competitors and predators (nakano 1995; gilliam & fraser 2001), size and quality of hab- itat (johnston & smithson 2000), as well as habitat connectivity and availability of refugia (fausch et al. 1995; aparicio & de sostoa 1999; albanese et al. 2004). despite the plethora of empirical studies that have examined fish movement, few studies have pro- vided insight into movement dynamics of nongame fishes in small headwater streams that commonly chub movement in an intermittent stream experience intermittent conditions (smithson & john- ston 1999; labbe & fausch 2000; hodges & magou- lick 2011; walker et al. 2013). the purpose of this study was to investigate the movement patterns of a species adapted to survive conditions in an intermittent stream. creek chubs, semotilus atromaculatus, are one of the most ubiqui- tous freshwater fishes found in small headwater streams throughout eastern north america (scott & crossman 1973) and are an important component in many freshwater assemblages (schlosser & ebel 1989; page & burr 2011). creek chub have numer- ous life history adaptations for survival in many dif- ferent environments not only in their native range (magnan & fitzgerald 1984; harvey & stewart 1991; belica & rahel 2008), but also in places where they have been introduced (quist et al. 2006). thus, creek chub may provide important clues regarding adaptations needed to survive and persist in intermit- tent streams, particularly if headwater streams are expected to become more abundant and unpredict- able. our primary objectives were to (i) describe the general movement patterns of creek chub in an inter- mittent stream and (ii) investigate the potential influ- ence of ecological factors on creek chub movement. methods study area north sylamore creek is a second-order tributary of the white river and located within the ozark-st. francis national forest, arkansas, usa. it is formed by the confluence of south fork and cole fork creeks and flows eastward through baxter and stone county. topographically, the region is well known for its karst geomorphology, resulting in numerous springs that are heavily dependent on local precipita- tion to increase flow and surface connectivity. streams in the region are characterised as having moderate gradients with riffle-pool morphology, dominated by gravel–bedrock substrates. north syla- more creek has a somewhat predictable hydrologic regime and can be characterised as a mid-reach dry- ing stream with several isolated pools that persist and provide important refugia throughout the year (lake 2003; walker et al. 2013). the study was conducted in the headwater reaches of north sylamore creek within cole fork and bir- mingham hollow. the entire study reach was approximately 5 km long from the lowest pool in cole fork to the farthest upstream pool in birming- ham hollow. year-round base flow conditions allowed us to subdivide the study reach into six stream sections, three connected and three isolated, differing in number of pools and surface connectivity. 191 walker & adams connected sections consisted of pools with contigu- ous surface flow between all pools within the section, while isolated sections were made up of isolated pools not connected by surface flow. surface connec- tion between all pools only occurred following local- ised rain events which generally last 3–5 days depending on the duration and magnitude of the rain event. additional stream characteristics and map can be found in walker et al. (2013). briefly, walker et al. (2013) found that physical habitat characteris- tics (average pool depth and volume) and water qual- ity (dissolved oxygen and temperature) in isolated and connected pools were fairly similar and remained consistent throughout most of the study, but began deteriorating in isolated pools following the may mark–recapture sample. fish collection events occurring creek chub were marked in november 2009 with subsequent mark–recapture at 6-week intervals in january, march, may and july 2010. during the initial marking sample, every pool within the study reach (n = 23), as well as all samp- leable habitats between pools in connected sections, was sampled. all subsequent mark–recapture events focused on fish sampling in the 23 pools, and no samples were collected outside of the 5-km study reach due to time constraints. although these types of studies have been criticised for biasing recapture efforts strictly within the original marking habitats (gowan et al. 1994; gowan & fausch 1996), a mark- ing study reach of 5 km or greater is rarely seen for stream fishes. fish collections began in the most downstream connected section, progressing upstream until all habitats were sampled. in connected sections, block nets were placed at the upstream and down- stream ends of each pool to keep fish contained dur- ing sampling. a three-pass depletion method, using 1.52 9 4.57 m seines (3.18 mm mesh), was utilised. fish from each seine haul were placed in separate flow-through mesh containers that allowed fish to remain in ambient water conditions until further pro- cessing. captured fish were then anaesthetised with ms-222, weighed (0.01 g) and measured for standard length (sl; 1.0 mm). population structure temporal changes in population size and population size structure were assessed using all captured creek chub regardless of whether they were marked or not. creek chub were grouped into two size classes (age 0: ≤50 mm and age 1 + : ≥51 mm) based on previ- ous studies of population demographics (moshenko & gee 1973; schemske 1974). although creek chub are 192 reported to live up to 5 years, size structure was lim- ited to these two size classes due to a small occurrence of age 2+ fish (148 of 1590 individuals) in the popu- lation. population size was estimated using abundance of creek chub in each size class in each pool across all sampling events, and variation in population size structure was computed using these estimates. further- more, estimated population size for each size class was compared between connected and isolated pools for each sampling event. mark–recapture and movement all creek chub ≥30 mm sl were given pool-specific batch marks using visual implant elastomer (vie; northwest marine technology, inc., shaw island, wa, usa). pools were differentiated using combinations of six body locations and six vie colours (total = 36 codes). following recovery from anaesthesia, all fish were released back into the pool of capture. during successive mark–recapture events, fish recaptured in their original pool of marking were measured and released back into their pool of capture without further marking. recaptured fish that exhibited movement were given an additional mark unique to the new pool of capture, while unmarked fish were given a unique mark to identify the pool of original capture. distance values representing movements that occurred between each mark–recapture sample were assigned to all recaptured creek chub. fish recaptured in the pool of previous marking were classified as residents and given a distance value of 0 m. creek chub recaptured outside of the pool of previous mark- ing were considered mobile and given a positive (upstream) or negative (downstream) distance value (m) equal to the distance between the midpoint of the original pool to the midpoint of the recapture pool. movement patterns were examined on a per interval basis with month of recapture (january, march, may and july) used to reflect movements that occurred between each mark–recapture sample. movement behaviour was assessed by comparing the number of resident and mobile creek chub for each mark–recap- ture sample using chi-square analysis of indepen- dence. additionally, comparisons were made between standard length of resident and mobile creek chub for each mark–recapture sample using t-tests with assumed unequal variances to evaluate the effect of fish size on movement behaviour. to determine whether there were correlations between fish size and distance moved, comparisons were made between standard length and distance moved for each mark– recapture sample. to characterise movement distribution patterns, kurtosis values were calculated using signed distances moved for all recaptured individuals and analysed for each mark–recapture sample using the advection–dif- fusion framework (skalski & gilliam 2000; gilliam & fraser 2001; petty & grossman 2004). to test for directional bias of creek chub movements, one-sam- ple t-tests were used to examine deviations from zero of mean signed distance moved (m), calculated for each mark–recapture sample (a = 0.05). standard deviation of signed movement was calculated to eval- uate variation in population spread. a one-way analy- sis of variance (anova) was used to test for differences in mean unsigned distance moved across mark–recapture samples. ecological factors movement behaviour in relation to hydrology and isolation was investigated by comparing the propor- tion of residents in isolated and connected pools, pro- portion of movers between pools within the same section (intramovement) and proportion of movers from one section to another (intermovement). com- parisons were made using log-likelihood goodness- of-fit tests with a significant a of 0.05. handheld dissolved immediately following each mark–recapture sam- ple, we measured a suite of standard water quality and habitat characteristics that could then be related to creek chub movement. dissolved oxygen, tempera- ture and specific conductivity were measured using a ysi-85 oxygen/conductivity instrument, and ph was measured using a separate handheld ph meter. pool type, connected or isolated, was determined by its hydrological characteristic of whether a pool was connected via surface flow or isolated from all other pools. additional habitat vari- ables were measured along cross-sectional transects in each pool, where number of transects varied (3–5) depending on pool size. measurements of depth (cm), substrate and cover were recorded at 0.5 m intervals along each transect. maximum and average depths (cm) were recorded for each pool. pool area was calculated as the product of pool length (m) and average pool width (m) to represent pool size. per cent in-stream cover for each pool was calculated for each mark–recapture sample as the average propor- tion of points along habitat transects where cover was present. sources of cover included all of the follow- ing: pebble, cobble, boulder, over hanging bedrock, leaf litter, and small and large wood. following roberts & angermeier (2007), pool stability was cal- culated as the per cent change in pool area between mark–recapture samples. pool complexity was calcu- lated for each pool using pool substrate characteris- tics using shannon’s diversity index. from every mark–recapture sample data were also collected for two biotic variables to influence on creek chub determine their potential chub movement in an intermittent stream movement. total fish density and creek chub density  2 and were calculated as the total number of fish m  2 within each pool. total number of creek chub m additional species included in the calculation for total fish density were southern redbelly dace (chros- omus erythrogaster), stoneroller (campostoma spp.), duskystripe shiner (luxilus pilsbryi), hornyhead chub (nocomis biguttatus), orangethroat darter (etheostom- a spectabile) and rainbow darter (etheostoma caeru- tested as a potential leum). predation was not influence on creek chub movement in this study because creek chub was the largest fish species within our study. a logistic regression model (lrm; jmp version 10.0; statistical analysis system, cary, nc, usa) was built to determine which independent variables were most associated with individual creek chub movement (e.g. resident or mobile) from a pool. in the data set, resident fish were represented by a zero, while mobile fish were represented by a one. due to limited recaptures during the january and july mark– recapture samples, all data on creek chub movement were pooled into one logistic model. the model was built using a stepwise forward selection routine that added independent variables significant at a = 0.05. independent variables were drawn from the following predictor variables: dissolved oxygen, temperature, ph, conductivity, pool type, maximum depth, average depth, area, per cent in-stream cover, pool stability, pool complexity, total fish density and creek chub density. pair-wise correlations among independent variables never exceeded 0.5 and variance inflation factors never surpassed 3.0. model explanatory power was assessed using the generalised r2 value and the accuracy of correctly classified observations of movers (sensitivity) and residents (specificity). individual variables associated with movement were assessed using partial r2 values and standardised coefficient estimates (b). results population structure based on all captured creek chub, estimated average population size and size structure were relatively con- sistent from november 2009 to may 2010 followed by a significant increase in population size and a greater divergence in population size structure in july 2010 (fig. 1a). on average, abundance of creek chub in age 1+ was slightly higher than that of age 0 dur- ing all sampling events except in july. the changes in population size and size structure were driven by a dramatic increase in the proportion of new recruits in july (fig. 1b). estimated creek chub abundances in age 0 size class were fairly consistent in connected 193 walker & adams (a) (b) and isolated pools throughout most of the study; however, there was a substantial upsurge of age 0 fish in both pools in july with a greater abundance occurring in isolated pools (fig. 2a). age 1+ abun- dances showed an overall decreasing trend over the course of the study with equally similar abundances in both connected and isolated pools (fig. 2b). movement patterns over the course of the mark–recapture study, we marked a total of 635 creek chub (≥30 mm) within the 5-km study reach. percentage of recaptured creek chub was highly variable, ranging from 65% in march to 8% in july (table 1). movement behaviour was not significantly different among mark–recapture samples with the proportion of mobile and resident creek consistent (v2 = 3.806; d.f. = 3; p = 0.283; table 1). standard length was significantly different between resident remaining chub relatively 194 fig. 1. temporal variation in population size and population size structure of creek chub inhabiting the 5-km study reach of north sylamore creek: (a) estimated population size (95% ci) of each size class and (b) proportion of each size class contributing to the total population. creek chub were grouped into two size classes (age 0: ≤50 mm and age 1 + : ≥51 mm) based on previous studies of creek chub population demographics. and mobile creek chub in march (two-sample t-test;

fig. 4). furthermore, there was no signif- icant difference in the proportion of intra- and inter- movement between isolated and connected sections (g = 1.777, d.f. = 1, p = 0.183 and g = 0.078, d.f. = 1, p = 0.78 respectively; fig. 4). the lrm revealed that creek chub movement from pools was associated with two of the measured eco- logical variables, pool complexity and pool area (n = 174, r2 = 0.25, p < 0.001). observations of correct classifications were 71% for movers and 69% for residents. the probability of movement decreased with increasing pool complexity (lrm; r2 = 0.11, b =  0.44, p < 0.001; fig. 5). furthermore, pool area was negatively associated with the probability of creek chub movement (lrm; r2 = 0.16, b =  0.23, p = 0.002; fig. 5). discussion in intermittent creek chub movement reaches of north sylamore creek produced a surprising pattern compared to other fish movement studies (table 4). on average, creek chub displayed some of the lon- gest distances moved compared to many nongame fishes (freeman 1995; petty & grossman 2004; roberts & angermeier 2007). creek chub also showed increased movement, especially compared to studies in perennial streams, with almost 50% of the recaptured fish being mobile throughout the study. furthermore, most mobile creek chub (76%) moved 196 fig. 3. displacement distributions of movement distance by recaptured creek chub within the entire study reach in north syla- more creek. upstream movements are represented by positive numbers, while negative numbers represent downstream move- ments. numbers above zero bars represent resident individuals. 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 n o i t r o p o r p resident intra-movement inter-movement isolated connected fig. 4. proportion of recaptured creek chub in isolated and con- nected sections that exhibited no movement (resident), intramove- ment (between pools within a section) and intermovement (between sections) in north sylamore creek for all mark–recap- ture samples combined. 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 d e r u t p a c r e b m u n (a) mover resident 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 habitat complexity (b) 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 pool area fig. 5. number of creek chub that either stayed within (open bars) or moved from (solid bars) their original marking pool. hab- itat complexity (a) and pool area (b) were significant in the logis- tic regression model. distances >100 m past the nearest neighbour habitat. most studies examining fish movement have found that majority of recaptured fish remain sedentary in chub movement in an intermittent stream their original pool of capture and those individuals considered mobile tended to move short distances into nearest neighbour habitats (gerking 1953; petty & grossman 2004). in the perineal conasauga river, georgia, johnston (2000) found that the federally threatened blue shiner followed a pattern of patch to patch movement similar to most fishes and suggested they represent relatively discrete subpopulations con- nected by limited dispersal. contrary to the vast majority of movement studies, creek chub in our study exhibited movements representative of one continuous population with relatively unrestricted dis- persal among habitat patches, which was entirely unexpected given the discontinuity of surface water in this system. movements over long distances across spatially disjunct habitats, often found in headwater streams, allow individual fish the opportunity to eval- uate resource quantity and quality in alternative habi- tats (gilliam & fraser 2001; albanese et al. 2004; hodges & magoulick 2011). for example, in a pana- manian stream, power (1984) proposed that loricariid catfish can assess availability of resources in alterna- tive habitats and redistribute themselves in relation to habitat quality. several long-distance movements >300 m occurred between every mark–recapture sample with increasing distances as the spring season progressed. increased movement of creek chub in our study may represent a survival strategy for fishes in highly variable environments such as intermittent streams where resources can be patchy (schlosser & angermeier 1995; mas-marti et al. 2010). variability in recapture rates (8–65%) of creek chub suggests the population experienced variation in turnover and rates of movement. high recapture rates of fishes often result from populations experiencing low rates of turnover and limited mobility (gowan et al. 1994; rodriguez 2002). the low recapture rate of 8% in july was likely due to high population turn- over with approximately 97% of the captured creek chub being young of the year (age 0: ≤50 mm sl; fig. 1b). creek chub movement did not seem to be limited in this intermittent stream. compared to most previous studies, almost half of the recaptured creek chub were considered mobile for all mark–recapture samples. recapture rates may have also been affected by movements downstream out of the study reach, fish escape during sampling, mark loss or natural mortality; however, these explanations were not likely major contributing factors. overall, few recap- tured creek chub made downstream movements and 99% of those downstream movements were to pools in the same stream section or to the nearest down- stream section (1 instance; 2470 m downstream). sampling efficiency was >95% for all mark–recap- ture samples. in addition, mark loss and mortality were found to be very low for creek chub during a 197 walker & adams table 4. comparison of findings from selected references on movement of nongame freshwater fishes. values presented as ranges represent seasonal variability report in studies. values with na represent data that were not reported in selected studies. stream type shows stream order and flow permanence (p = perennial and i = intermittent). length of study for roberts & angermeier (2007) represents six different 1-km stream reaches. location: state or country stream type length of study (days) reach length (km) # marked (% recaptured) % mobile fish mean distance or home range (hr) median distance maximum distance detected nc nc nc ga ga ar ar ar ar ga nc va va va wy be ar ar 4th/p 4th/p 4th/p 5th/p 5th/p 2nd/i 2nd/i 2nd/i 2nd/i 2nd/p 4th/p 1st–3rd/p 1st–3rd/p 1st–3rd/p 5th/p 3rd/p 2nd/i 2nd/i 548 548 548 577 577 850 850 850 850 84 1095 480 480 480 53 395 326 326 0.177 0.177 0.177 0.546 0.546 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1 6 6 6 1.1 0.300 5 5 180 (28) 51 (33) 134 (19) 1914 (8) 624 (20) 112 (22) 163 (18) 679 (30) 364 (65) 180 (0–58) 604 (79) 8555 (11–15) 804 (19) 763 (25–29) 628 (27–47) 452 (45) 7546 (23–70) 635 (8–65) 8 18 23 32 16 12 33 12 14 33 17–72 6–7 7 3–9 36–55 10–76 16–43 41–58 13 m (hr) 14 m (hr) 19 m (hr) na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na 1–8 m 0.78–1.79 m na 179 m na 143 m na 191 m na 50 m 50 m 20 m 32–135 m 12–148 m 179–1069 m 103–388 m 130.7 m 55 m 40 m 98 m 420 m 200 m na na 453 m 506 m 332 m 165 m 500 m 250 m 600 m 606 m 395 m 5791 m 4678 m species mottled sculpin* longnose dace* rosyside dace* blackbanded darter† redbreast sunfish† creek chub‡ blackspotted topminnow‡ green sunfish‡ longear sunfish‡ blue shiner§ mottled sculpin¶ fantail darter** riverweed darter** roanoke darter** creek chub†† rhine sculpin‡‡ southern redbelly dace§§ creek chub¶¶ *hill & grossman (1987). †freeman (1995). ‡smithson & johnston (1999). §johnston (2000). ¶petty & grossman (2004). **roberts & angermeier (2007). ††belica & rahel (2008). ‡‡ovidio et al.

(2013) ¶¶current study. 125-day laboratory experiment (r. h. walker, unpub- lished data). distances were generally no farther than 300 m. creek chub in a north carolina stream exhibited rela- tively mobile (83% of population) behaviours, but these movements were generally very short distances (skalski & gilliam 2000). in the little glazypeau creek, arkansas, relatively few creek chub (<12%) moved outside of the original habitat patch of collec- tion (smithson & johnston 1999). median and maxi- mum distances moved by creek chub over an 8 week period in the laramie river, wyoming, were 49 and 606 m respectively (belica & rahel 2008). detection of several long-distance movements by creek chub in this study further exemplifies the importance of extensive study reaches for accurately measuring movement of stream fishes. albanese et al. (2003) proposed that increasing the length of study reaches a priori will decrease bias in distance- weighted sampling and increase the detection of long-distance movements. of the few studies that have investigated creek chub movement to date, all have been conducted in stream reaches <2.5 km in length (table 4), potentially underestimating move- ment in these systems. because our study focused on movement in a 5-km reach, we feel confident that leptokurtic distributions continue to be a recurring pattern in stream fish populations (hill & grossman 1987; skalski & gilliam 2000; gilliam & fraser 2001). creek chub movement patterns in north syla- more creek were no different, displaying variable leptokurtic distributions throughout the study. this variability in leptokurtic distribution signifies tempo- ral variation in distances and direction moved by creek chub. recent studies suggest leptokurtic distri- bution is a result of movement plasticity of individu- als factors (alldredge et al. 2011) and not a movement response by distinct subgroups within a population (skalski & gilliam 2000; fraser et al. 2001; rodriguez 2002). responding ecological to various characteristics of creek chub movement have been reported in a few mark–recapture studies and seem to vary across their geographic range. creek chub in our study tended to move more often, displaying greater median (103–388 m) and longer maximum distances (1228–4678 m) compared to previous studies. storck & momot (1981) observed several large, adult creek chub in indian creek, ohio, moving upstream, but 198 previous researchers have found variable results when relating movement behaviour and body size of fishes. some studies have found no difference in body size between resident and mobile fish (berra & gunning 1972; smithson & johnston 1999; belica & rahel 2008), while others have found mobile fish to be smaller and less-fit (funk 1957; heggenes et al. 1991; gowan & fausch 1996) or larger than their resident counterparts (gerking 1953; tyus & mcada 1984). belica & rahel (2008), and smithson & john- ston (1999) found no difference in sl between mobile and resident creek chub and no relationship between sl and distance moved. skalski & gilliam (2000) found a positive relationship between sl and the probability of movement; however, they did not find a relationship between body size and distance moved. contrary to these studies, sl of mobile creek chub in our study was significantly greater than resi- dent creek chub in march and may. however, similar to these other studies, sl of mobile creek chub was not associated with distance moved for any mark– recapture sample. these discrepancies in body size and movement behaviour between studies of creek chub suggest that movement of a single species may vary from one environment to the next and may fluc- tuate seasonally. directional movement of stream fishes has been associated with many different ecological cues (davey & kelly 2007; copp et al. 2010; alldredge et al. 2011). for instance, hall (1972) found several fishes compensated for downstream larval drift by migrating upstream to spawn. creek chub, in particular, have shown increases in upstream movement of mature individuals in association with spawning in indian creek, ohio (storck & momot 1981). creek chub in our study exhibited a significant upstream bias during the may mark–recapture sample with a subsequent shift in population size structure dominated by age 0 fish in july. our findings suggest increased movement upstream in may could have been associated with the reproductive ecology of creek chub. in arkansas, creek chub construct gravel nests and spawn from march to mid-june, which overlapped with the increased upstream movement detected in may. it is likely these long-distance movements by larger reproductive individuals were in search of mates or spawning habitats with higher productivity. our results accurately reflect the true movement pat- terns of creek chub in north sylamore creek. pool isolation did not seem to have a pervasive effect on population size structure or movement pat- terns of creek chub in north sylamore creek. although population size structure was fairly consis- tent in isolated and connected pools over the course of this study, there was a substantial increase in the abundance of age 0 fish in both pool types in july chub movement in an intermittent stream with a greater abundance occurring in isolated pools. this result was somewhat surprising given that walker et al. (2013) found physical habitat (average pool depth and volume) and water quality (dissolved oxygen and temperature) metrics declined in isolated pools by july 2010. the proportion of sedentary creek chub and creek chub exhibiting intra- and inter- movement was not significantly different between connected and isolated stream sections. fishes have shown various movement responses to intermittency (petty & grossman 2004; davey & kelly 2007; hod- ges & magoulick 2011). for example, bluehead chub in the james river drainage, virginia, emigrated from intermittent stream reaches more frequently than perennial reaches (albanese et al. 2004). walker et al. (2013) found that southern redbelly dace exhib- ited increased inter-movement from isolated stream sections, seemingly in response to the quality of iso- lated pools. reduced flow and habitat isolation can directly impede movement by acting as a dispersal barrier (labbe & fausch 2000; schaefer 2001; rob- erts & angermeier 2007). if pool isolation influenced the movement behaviour of creek chub in this study, we would have presumably seen increased intramov- ement between connected habitats and/or increased intermovement from isolated stream sections. addi- tionally, the overall increases in movement by creek chub and lack of association (in lrm) with pool type (connected versus isolated) suggest movement was influenced by contributing factors other than pool isolation. based on the results of the lrm, creek chub movement was influenced by two of the examined ecological variables. the probability of creek chub movement decreased as habitat complexity and pool area increased. creek chub tended to remain in dee- per more complex pools and move from smaller, sim- pler pools. these results are not surprising given that movement associated with characteristics of physical habitat has been detected in other stream systems and fish species (moshenko & gee 1973; johnston & smithson 2000; albanese et al. 2004). for example, in the laramie river, wyoming, creek chub move- ment between patches was associated with the avail- ability of cover (belica & rahel 2008). hodges & magoulick (2011) showed creek chub exhibited directional movement into deeper habitats and had greater survival during seasonal drying in indian creek, arkansas. furthermore, in little glayzpea creek, arkansas, mobile longear and green sunfish moved from smaller pools more frequently than lar- ger pools (johnston & smithson 2000). the attraction fishes in headwater streams have towards larger, complex habitats that act as refugia will likely aid in the survival of populations that experience intensive intermittent conditions. 199 walker & adams results, one of the primary goals of population ecology is to understand the causes and consequences of vari- ability in population dynamics in various ecosystems (schlosser 1995). intermittent streams provide unique opportunities for ecologists to examine both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to vari- ability in population responses. increases in the amount and distance of stream fish movement may counteract the negative impacts of intermittency on population dynamics. our in combination with previous studies on a widely distributed species, suggest creek chub are well adapted to survive in hydrologically dynamic, headwater streams. creek chub not only have shown the adaptive capability to increase their gut length in intermittent environments (christian & adams 2014), but our results also sug- gest they have adapted movement responses associ- ated with environmental cues of habitat size and complexity. creek chub in the intermittent reach of north sylamore creek exhibited increases in move- ment (>40% for all mark–recapture samples) and greater distances moved compared to previous studies on creek chub movement (smithson & johnston 1999; belica & rahel 2008). future studies should continue to monitor changes in behavioural response and survival of fishes across different magnitudes and durations of intermittency. as small headwater streams continue to be threatened by factors contrib- uting to increased intermittency, our understanding of the biological processes and governing phenomenon must also increase if managers intend to conserve populations and communities. acknowledgements we thank c. johnson, l. stearman, j. larson, r. adams, s. entrekin, d. mitchell, b.
