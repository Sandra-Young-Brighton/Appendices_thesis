accepted: 14 july 2016 doi: 10.1111/eff.12303 l e t t e r paternal genomotype affects female growth in a hybrid fish complex advance in population dynamics of allopolyploid vertebrates is ham- pered by lack of evidence on the fitness of the genomotypes (i.e. groups of individuals with specific combinations of parental genom- es) included in the complexes. while some studies have focused on commercial fishes subjected to induced auto-  and allopolyploidy for aquaculture purposes (piferrer et al., 2009), there is a dearth of information on natural allopolyploids, representing successful essays of heterospecific genome compatibility, novel gene interactions and gene compensation mechanisms. the iberian fish complex squalius alburnoides is ideal for empiri- cal studies on the fitness of natural allopolyploids. this complex arose by intergeneric hybridisation, involving squalius pyrenaicus females (p genome) and males from an already extinct species of the anaecypris hispanica lineage (a genome). it includes males and females with dis- tinct ploidies (2n = 50, 3n = 75 and 4n = 100) and genomotypes, which are fertile and able to mate with each other and with the sympatric squalius species. most populations are dominated by allotriploids, namely by the paa genomotype in the tejo, sado and guadiana basins. this highly female- biased genomotype is entirely maintained by cross- es involving paa females, yielding a gametes by meiotic hybridogen- esis, and pa and ppaa males, producing pa gametes clonally and by regular meiosis respectively (collares- pereira, matos, morgado- santos, & coelho, 2013). both these crosses are more successful than crosses between paa females and paa, ppa and s. pyrenaicus males, in egg allocation, fertilisation and larval survival (morgado- santos, carona, magalhães, vicente, & collares- pereira, 2016). however, paa females appear to preferentially mate with ppaa than pa males, and survival is higher among larvae and youngs- of- the- year generated by the former (morgado- santos, pereira, vicente, & collares- pereira, 2015; morgado- santos et al., 2016). in these circumstances, clarifying whether paa females fathered by ppaa and pa males differ in fitness later in the ontogeny will be important for understanding the dynamics of the complex. here, we conducted an experiment testing whether growth dif- fers between adult paa females fathered by ppaa and pa males. specifically, we assessed length variation in adult females kept in out- door tanks over 14 weeks. we focused on length because it drives several fitness traits in fish, such as fecundity, survival and competitive ability (matthews, 1998). experimental procedures followed the rec- ommended ethical guidelines (asab 2015) and the national legislation regarding animal capture, manipulation and experimentation for sci- entific purposes. individuals used in the experiment were produced in directional crosses between six paa females and three ppaa and three pa males from the tejo basin (ocreza river, portugal), conducted by morgado- santos et al. (2016). briefly, between may and july 2012, mating pairs were kept in compartmentalised outdoor tanks, the batches of eggs produced by each pair were transferred to petri dishes in groups of 100, and the larvae feeding exogenously and swimming properly were allocated in indoor containers with 3 l. three to four months after spawning, descendants of each mating pair were transferred to tanks, with 15–30 l, and kept at similar densities. because in the wild paa females mature only in the second year of life (ribeiro et al., 2003), we maintained our fish in the tanks for 3 years to assure they would be mature and sexed at the time of experiment. the tanks were kept at temperature and photoperiod reflecting con- ditions in the wild (i.e. october to february: 16°c, 10- hr:14- hr light/ dark cycle; march to september: 20°c, 14- hr:10- hr light/dark cycle), and water was renewed monthly. inspections for dead fish were con- ducted daily, and fish were fed ground commercial flakes. no eggs or sperm emissions were ever recorded in such tanks. in april 2015, nine descendants of each mating pair were select- ed for analysis, out of the 35–58 ppaa descendants and 21–37 pa descendants in the tanks. to minimise size effects on growth, selected individuals showed the least variation in total length as possible, with ppaa descendants ranging between 55 and 65 mm and pa descen- dants ranging between 54 and 61 mm. the ploidy of individuals was confirmed through flow cytometry (lamatsch, steinlein, schmid, & schartl, 2000), because paa females can occasionally produce aa and paa gametes and thereby generate higher ploidy descendants with ppaa and pa males (see collares- pereira et al., 2013). the 54 individuals with paa genomotype selected for testing were transferred to three outdoor tanks with 130 × 70 × 50 cm, kept under natural light (about 14- hr:10- hr light/dark cycle) and temperature (13.6–35.7°c). each tank had six compartments (43 × 25 cm), sepa- rated by perforated acrylic plates, and nets at the bottom, to allow egg removal without disturbing the fish. water was filtered using pumps connected to uv lamps. in each tank, descendants of ppaa and pa males were distribut- ed in alternated compartments, to minimise positioning effects. each compartment allocated three individuals, one descendant per mating pair, identified from cuts in the pelvic and anal fins. fish were fed fro- zen bloodworms twice a day and allowed to acclimate to experimental conditions for 2 weeks. from 27th april to 3rd august, fish were measured for total length each 2 weeks, and applied a gentle pressure on the abdomen for dis- charge of gametes and sex assessment. fish perceived as immatures and males were signalled but kept to maintain density constant among ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:719–721. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff  |  719 © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd720  |     compartments. because paa females are multiple spawners (morgado- santos et al., 2016) and tend to lay most eggs (>75%) during may and june (morgado- santos et al. unpublished data), compartments were daily inspected for eggs during 10 weeks. eggs were found in four compartments with ppaa descendants and in six compartments with pa descendants, removed and counted. at the end of the experiment, fish were euthanised with an overdose of ms- 222 anaesthetic and sexed following guerrero and shelton (1974). overall, three imma- tures and two males fathered by ppaa and one male fathered by pa males were identified in six compartments. analyses were thus restricted to 22 females fathered by ppaa males and 26 females fathered by pa males. prior to analysis, vari- ables were assessed for normality and homogeneity of variances using shapiro–wilk and levene tests respectively. variation in length was compared between pa and ppaa descendants using repeated- measures anova, with mating pair as nested factor. because the assumption of sphericity was not met (p < .0001 in mauchly’s test), and the estimate of sphericity (ɛ) was <0.75, the greenhouse–geisser correction was used to reduce the degrees of freedom associated with the f- value. the pillai’s trace multivariate test was also performed to confirm the results. potential confounding effects of egg allocation on growth rate were assessed using linear regression. egg allocation was indexed by the mean number of eggs per female in each compart- ment. growth rate was determined as the proportional increment in length gained by each female. because there were strong correlations between growth at the end of the experiment and at egg collection in both ppaa (r = .895, p < .0001) and pa descendants (r = .923, p < .0001), only the former was used in regression analyses. pairwise comparisons between pa and ppaa descendants for length and growth rate were analysed using t- tests and for egg allocation using mann–whitney u- test. significance of statistical testing was assessed letter at p < .05, and analyses were conducted using statistica v12 (statsoft 2013). females fathered by ppaa males grew less than those fathered by pa males (mean ± se: 0.151 ± 0.009 vs. 0.206 ± 0.010, t46 = 4.083, p < .001), being the largest at the onset of the experiment (59.6 ± 0.5 vs. 58.1 ± 0.4 mm, t46 = 2.451, p = .018) but the smallest at the end (68.5 ± 0.5 vs. 70.0 ± 0.4 mm, t46 = 2.156, p = .036) (fig. 1). growth rate was independent of egg allocation in both ppaa (r2 = 0.0002, f1,20 = 0.005, p = .944) and pa descendants (r2 = 0.060, f1,24 = 1.526, p = .229), and there was no difference in egg allocation between ppaa and pa descendants (52.682 ± 18.930 vs. 60.423 ± 19.032, u = 243.00, p = .374). repeated- measures anova showed that paternal genomotype had significant effects on female length (greenhouse–geisser test: f2,83 = 13.834, p < .001; pillai’s trace: f7,36 = 5.162, p = .0004), although there was also variation among females fathered by the same genomotype (greenhouse–geisser test: f8,83 = 4.821, p < .001; pillai’s trace: f28,156 = 1.704, p = .022). these results indicate that adult paa females in the s. alburnoi- des complex fathered by pa males may grow faster and attain larger sizes than those fathered by ppaa males. this adds to previous stud- ies showing ploidy and genomotype effects on individual size (cunha, bastir, coelho, & doadrio, 2009; ribeiro et al., 2003), and highlights that growth may vary among individuals with the same genomotype reflecting paternal imprinting effects. moreover, our results show that effects of paternal genomotype on female growth may be con- trary to those perceived in survival of larvae and youngs- of- the- year (morgado- santos et al., 2016), suggesting that the relative fitness of paa females fathered by different genomotypes may shift throughout ontogeny. there was also considerable variability in growth among females fathered by the same genomotype, which may be related ) m m ( h

was worth in highlighting parental imprinting effects on fish growth, results would possibly have been stronger if estimates of individual maturity and egg allocation were available. whatever its ultimate causes, our results suggest that “individual” effects on fish growth may have been insuf- ficiently scrutinised and that this component of variation needs to be explored further to better clarify the full set of factors shaping pop- ulation dynamics in allopolyploids, as advanced by morgado- santos et al. (2016). variation in growth in relation to paternal genomotype may play a role in the dynamics of the allopolyploid complex. larger size in mature paa females may partially counteract the lower survival of pa relative to ppaa descendants early in the ontogeny (morgado- santos et al., 2016), with larger females likely maturing earlier and producing more or larger eggs (matthews, 1998; ribeiro et al., 2003). besides, variability in length may promote some ecological parti- tioning among mature paa females, which may reduce intra-  and intergenomotype interactions for resources when limited (collares- pereira et al., 2013). mechanisms underlying the influence of paternal genomotype on growth remain unclear, but they may be linked to differences in the pa sperm produced by each male genomotype. actually pa males pro- duce unreduced gametes by clonal gametogenesis while ppaa males have a normal (haploidising) meiosis. the ameiotic production of unre- duced sperm might contribute to propagate good gene combinations and chromosomal regions instead of breaking them through recombi- nation (otto & lenormand, 2002). the resulting triploid embryos may perform better in comparative terms as suggested by the quantitative gene expression flexibility observed in paa females (matos, machado, schartl, & coelho, 2015). moreover, the perceived paternal imprinting may also involve epigenetic regulation on early embryogenesis, con- sidering the inheritance pattern of the sperm dna methylome in the zebrafish (jiang et al., 2013), but further research is needed to disen- tangle how epigenetic information and induced modifications operate in odd genomes. to our knowledge, this is the first study implicating paternal imprinting in shaping the fitness of individuals with the same genom- otype. as such, determining the effects of paternal imprinting in other fitness traits affecting population dynamics and clarifying the role of genomic context in driving allelic expression and dosage regulation in individual fish may be crucial to advance knowledge of allopolyploid complexes. acknowledgements we thank miguel morgado- santos for unpublished data on egg alloca- tion, and inês fragata for help in statistical analyses. thanks are also due to ana abrantes, beatriz orcinha, catarina correia and marlon pazian for assistance in fish maintenance. permits for fish manipulation and experimentation were provided by the instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas (140/2012/capt and 239/2013/capt).     |  721 this study was financed by portuguese national funds, through fct – fundação para a ciência e a tecnologia, within the projects uid/ bia/00329/2013 and pest- oe/bia/ui0329/2014, and within the biodiv doctoral programme (pd/bd/52596/2014). sara carona maria j. collares-pereira m. filomena magalhães ce3c: centre for ecology, evolution and environmental changes, faculdade de ciências, universidade de lisboa, lisboa, portugal correspondence sara carona ce3c: centre for ecology, evolution and environmental changes, faculdade de ciências, universidade de lisboa, lisboa, portugal email: sccarona@fc.ul.pt references asab (association for the study of animal behaviour).
