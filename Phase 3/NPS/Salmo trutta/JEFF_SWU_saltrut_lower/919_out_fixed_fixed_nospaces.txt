e-mail: clinton-ray-robertson@tamu.edu accepted for publication august 2, 2007 introduction despite their unique morphological characteristics, ancient origins and broad distributions in north america, ﬁshes in the order lepisosteiformes have received relatively little attention in the ecological literature. the seven living gar species of the family lepisosteidae are found in north america, central america and cuba (helfman et al. 1999). most studies on the ecology of this ancient lineage of ﬁshes have focused on the impact of gars on recreationally important species, by either directly consuming them or competing with them for prey (lagler & hubbs 1940; bonham 1941; lagler et al. 1942; crumpton 1971). the paucity of ecological research on gars may be associated with their history of classiﬁcation as ‘rough’ or resource agencies. ‘trash’ ﬁsh by many natural three sympatric gar species occur in the middle brazos river, texas, and its associated oxbow lakes: doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00265.x 119 robertson et al. alligator gar (atractosteus spatula), spotted gar (lep- isosteus oculatus) and longnose gar (lepisosteus osseus). the middle brazos river maintains a dynamic channel and ﬂood plain, allowing for river– oxbow connections during stochastic ﬂood events. these hydrologic connections allow piscivores, such as gars, to move between ﬂood plain and river habitats to exploit abundant prey, or to consume prey as they move between habitats (ross & baker 1983; kwak 1988; winemiller 1996, zeug et al. 2005). here, we investigate resource use among the three sympatric gar species in the middle brazos river during a year with relatively few river–oxbow con- nections and a year with frequent river–oxbow con- nections. we compared both habitat use (oxbow vs. river channel) and diet during periods of isolation and following periods of ﬂood connection. methods study site the brazos river originates in north-west texas, and ﬂows south-east across the state entering the gulf of mexico near freeport, tx. our study focused on the middle brazos river (between 30°25¢n and 30°37¢n), a meandering lowland reach with a broad ﬂoodplain dominated by forest and agricultural lands. aerial surveys identiﬁed more than 40 oxbow lakes on the ﬂood plain of the middle brazos river (winemiller et al. 2000). our sampling was conducted monthly from june 2003 to may 2005 at two oxbows (big bend and moehlman’s) and the brazos river channel the texas state highway 21 bridge. for more at detailed descriptions of to winemiller et al. (2000) and zeug et al. (2005). the study sites, refer big bend and moehlman’s oxbows differ geomor- phologically (winemiller et al. 2000). big bend oxbow is located closer to the active channel than moehlman’s oxbow, and lower ﬂows are required to connect big bend oxbow with the river channel (zeug et al. 2005). figure 1 shows the daily stream ﬂow hydrograph during the 2-year study period. the ﬁrst year of the study was relatively dry with few connection events (dry year). in the second year, river–oxbow connection events were relatively frequent (wet year), yielding multiple connections of moehlman’s oxbow which, on average, connects with the river channel only once every 1.93 years (twdb, 2004). fig. 1. hydrograph of daily stream ﬂow [m3 ⁄ s (cms)] of the brazos river at the texas state highway 21 bridge from june 2003 to may 2005. the lower line represents the minimum ﬂow required to connect big bend oxbow, and the upper line is the minimum ﬂow to connect moehlman’s oxbow. connectivity estimates provided by the texas water development board (twdb 2004). of each gillnet set was recorded for calculations of catch-per-unit effort (cpue). gars captured in gillnets were transported to the laboratory on ice, measured to the nearest 0.1-cm standard length (sl), and weighed to the nearest gram. stomachs were removed and ﬁxed in a 10% formalin solution. some studies have indicated that piscivores may regurgitate stomach contents when captured using gillnets (e.g., sutton et al. 2004), but little evidence of regurgitation (few fully distended but empty stomachs) was encountered during this study. to estimate prey abundance, small ﬁshes and grass shrimp (palaemonidae) were collected during each survey using a 10-m · 2-m bag seine with a 0.64-cm mesh in the wings and a 0.32-cm mesh in the bag, following winemiller et al. (2000). the seine was hauled perpendicular to shore at different locations until three consecutive hauls yielded no additional species to the cumulative list. the distance of each seine haul was estimated for calculations of prey species cpue. fish and grass shrimp collected in the seine were preserved in 10% formalin and returned to the laboratory where they were identiﬁed to species, counted and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. based on comparisons with data from electroﬁshing and experimental gillnetting, seining was determined to be a highly effective method of surveying ﬁsh assemblages in oxbow lakes (winemiller et al. 2000). oxbows were uniformly shallow (0.5–2 m), and the 10-m · 2-m seine efﬁciently captured small and intermediate size classes of all ﬁsh species that were the principal prey of gar. fish collection diet analysis gars were collected using experimental multiﬁlament gillnets consisting of three 16.5-m · 2-m panels of 2.54-, 5.1- and 7.6-cm bar meshes. gillnets were set from approximately 16:00–08:00 hours. the duration fishes were identiﬁed to the lowest possible taxo- nomic level, and invertebrates were identiﬁed to order. each prey item was counted, measured (sl for ﬁshes and total length for all other prey items) to the nearest 120 1 mm, and its volume determined by water displace- ment (winemiller & pianka 1990) to the nearest 0.01 ml. for analysis, prey items were grouped by family for ﬁsh and order for invertebrates. resource categories that consisted of unidentiﬁed or miscella- neous ﬁsh were not included in the calculation of indices. diets were compared among gar species between seasons and years. seasonal groupings were designated as summer (june–august), autumn (sep- tember–november), winter (december–february) and spring (march–may). diet overlap was estimated with pianka’s (1974) p symmetrical niche overlap: ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ q p p2 ik p pijpik p2 ij /jk ¼ where pij and pik represent the volumetric proportion of prey category i in the diet of consumer species j and k respectively. values for this symmetrical overlap index range from zero, which indicates no overlap in diet, to 1, indicating an identical diet or complete overlap between consumer species j and k, respectively. resource preferences were calculated using law- lor’s (1980) electivities (eij). for each consumer species j, electivities were calculated for each prey category i as: eij ¼ pij ri where pij is the volumetric proportion of prey category i in the diet of consumer species j, and ri is the relative proportion of prey species (ﬁsh and grass shrimp) i in the habitat (seine samples). to make comparisons, all electivities were standardised as a percentage of the totals. an index of relative importance (iri) (pinkas et al. 1971) also was calculated for each prey category i found in the diet of each consumer species j: iriij ¼ ð% by number þ % by volumeþ  % frequency of occurrence as with the electivities, between seasons, sites and species, standardised as per cent iri. to make comparisons the iris were niche breadth (bj) for each consumer species j was calculated using levins (1968) measure: bj ¼ 1p p2 ij where pij is the volumetric fraction of prey item i in the total diet of consumer species j. values of bj range from 1, indicating a minimum niche breadth or maximum specialisation, to n, where n is equal to the total number of resource states (or prey categories) resource partitioning among gar indicating a maximum niche breadth and minimum specialisation. for this study, there was a total of 20 prey categories (appendix i). niche breadth was standardised to make comparisons between species and habitat using hurlbert’s (1978) method: ba ¼ bj   1 n   1 where ba is levins’ standardised niche breadth for consumer species j, with values ranging from 0 to 1, indicating minimum and maximum niche breadth, respectively. to assess resource partitioning by prey size, pred- ator weight (g) and prey sl (mm) were log trans- formed and plotted against each other. predator weight was used, as spotted gars and longnose gars differ in morphology. a linear regression was used to deter- mine the relationship between gar weight and prey sl. statistical analysis chi-square tests were calculated to test for signiﬁcant (a < 0.05) differences in gar abundance in river and oxbow habitats between years, as well as for differences between average gar sls across habitats. a principal components analysis (pca) was performed on matrices of volumetric proportions of prey items according to species, sites and seasons using canoco (version 4; microcomputer power, ithaca, ny, usa). results habitat during the 2-year study, 693 gars were collected in gillnets. in the dry year, 411 gars were collected, and in the wet year 282 gars were collected. gar cpue was greater in the brazos river and moehlman’s oxbow than big bend oxbow (table 1). overall, 89.4% of alligator gars and 98.1% of spotted gars were captured from oxbow habitats (table 1). by contrast, 84.3% of longnose gars were collected from the river channel. distributions of spotted gar captures did not vary much between years. during the dry year, 98.7% of spotted gars were collected in oxbows and only three individuals were collected from the river channel (table 1). during the wet year, 96.9% of spotted gars were collected from oxbows and four individuals were collected from the river channel. spotted gar abun- dance in oxbows signiﬁcantly decreased during the wet year (v2 = 315.1, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001). during the dry year, 97.0% of longnose gars were collected from the river channel and only ﬁve individuals were collected from oxbow habitats. captures of longnose gars from oxbow habitats signiﬁcantly increased from 3.0% 121 robertson et al. atractosteus spatula n (%) lepisosteus oculatus n (%) lepisosteus osseus n (%) total cpue table 1. total catches of gar species by

from an oxbow (big bend) and one from the river channel. during the wet year, 17 alligator gars were collected, with 94.1% captured from oxbows and only one individual captured from the river channel. alligator gar abundance was signiﬁcantly greater in oxbows during the wet year (v2 = 202.5, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001). all alligator gars captured from oxbows were juveniles that ranged in size from 409 to 810 mm, whereas both of the alligator gars captured in the river channel were adults (1474 and 1850 mm). diet from the 693 gars collected, a total of 652 stomachs was removed for analysis (table 1). gars in both big bend and moehlman’s oxbows had a low occurrence of empty stomachs (37.9% and 37.5% respectively), whereas gars in the river channel had a high occur- rence of empty stomachs (59.0%). between species, longnose gar had the highest occurrence of empty stomachs and spotted gar had the lowest occurrence of empty stomachs (table 1). diet breadth gar diet breadth was highly variable between sites and years (fig. 2). during the dry years, longnose gars in the river channel had higher diet breadth than spotted gars in oxbows, but longnose gars had lower diet breadth than spotted gars during the wet year. spotted gars in big bend oxbow had higher diet breadth than those in moehlman’s. spotted gar diet breadth in both oxbows increased during the spring of the dry year which

river channel (%eij = 67.3%) and spotted gars in oxbow habitats (81.0%). for spotted gars in big bend oxbow, crayﬁsh (27.7%) were the most important prey item, and shad were the most important prey item for spotted gars in moehlman’s oxbow. sunﬁsh were also an important prey for spotted gars in both oxbows (big bend: 22.3%, moehlman’s: 16.5%). based on a limited sample size, shad (37.5%) and suckers (catastomidae, 31.7%) were the most important prey for alligator gars. variation in the relative importance of other prey taxa in gar diets also was observed between habitats and years. during the wet year, shad were the most important prey, followed by catﬁsh and minnows (cyprinidae), for longnose gars in the river channel (table 2). during the dry year, mayﬂies and catﬁsh were the most important prey items for longnose gars, while shad importance decreased. crayﬁsh and sunﬁsh were the most important prey items for spotted gars in big bend oxbow during the dry year, but during the wet (orthoptera) increased in importance along with catﬁsh. for spotted gars in moehlman’s oxbow, sunﬁsh and catﬁsh importance increased during the second (wet) year, whereas shad importance decreased. grasshoppers year, shad and for the statistical analysis of the diet composition data, the ﬁrst two axes of pca combined to explain 65.3% of the variation in diet (fig. 3). axis 1 loadings from low to high include crayﬁsh (0.11), minnows (0.16), catﬁsh (0.41) and shad (3.65). axis 2 loadings from low to high include shad ()0.44), crayﬁsh (0.25), sunﬁsh (0.64) and catﬁsh (2.71). in big bend oxbow, crayﬁsh were important in the diet of spotted gars during the dry year when ﬁsh prey items were declining in abundance (total prey ﬁsh cpue: summer: 62.1, autumn: 19.7, winter: 5.8 and spring: 19.8). after the river connected with the oxbow during the summer of the dry year and spring of the wet year, there were shifts toward greater shad consumption. similarly, catﬁsh were the most important prey item for longnose gars in the brazos river, and after the river connected with the oxbow during the autumn and spring ﬂoods of the dry year, shad became the most important prey item (fig. 3). shad abundance was low in the river prior to oxbow connection events (fig. 4). moehlman’s oxbow had low frequencies of hydrolog- ical connections, and spotted gars in this oxbow had a relatively stable diet dominated by shad. following ﬂood connections during the spring of the dry year and summer of the wet year in moehlman’s oxbow, spotted gar diets included more catﬁsh, but later switched back to shad (fig. 3). dietary overlap dietary overlap between the two most common gar species, longnose and spotted combined across all habitats and years was high: 72.7% during the dry year and 90.1% during the wet year. dietary overlap between longnose and alligator gars was 41% and between spotted and alligator gars was 43% during the wet year (alligator gar diet data were only analysed for the wet year). dietary overlap between longnose and spotted gars varied seasonally. during the dry year, dietary overlap was the highest in autumn, which coincided with a hydrological connection with big bend oxbow (fig. 1). during the wet year, summer and winter had higher dietary overlaps, which coin- cided with hydrologic connections between the river and both oxbows.

gar: slprey = 0.17[wgar] + 1.24, f1,122 = 32.19, p < 0.001). interspeciﬁc difference in the slope of the predator–prey relationship could not be determined due to a signiﬁcant interaction between gar species and weight (ancova: f2,434 = 35.7, p < 0.001). r2 = 0.13, discussion habitat partitioning gar cpue values suggest strong habitat partitioning between spotted and longnose gars in the brazos river, with spotted gars most abundant in oxbows and longnose gars most abundant in the river channel. similar habitat preferences in gars have been reported from other systems (holloway 1954; goodyear 1967; snedden et al. 1999). even during the wet year, with frequent lateral connections that provided corridors for gars to move between habitats, spotted gars remained within oxbow habitats (spotted gar cpue did signif- icantly decreased between years, but this likely was due to a doubling of water volume in oxbow habitats during the wet year). longnose gars, however, signif- icantly increased in abundance in oxbow habitats during the wet year. movement of riverine species associated with into ﬂoodplain habitats during lateral connections has been well documented (ross & baker 1983; kwak 1988; miranda & lucas 2004; miranda 2005; zeug et al. 2005). many channel-dwelling ﬁshes move onto ﬂoodplain habitats to spawn (hohausova´ et al. 2003; penczak et al. 2003) or to exploit the abundant food resources habitats (winemiller & kelso-winemiller 1994; o’connell 2003). longnose gars apparently enter oxbows to forage opportunistically on abundant prey rather than for spawning, as longnose gars seem to be stream spawners that require ﬂow (netsch & witt 1962; johnson & noltie 1996). conversely, spotted gars seem to prefer backwaters or areas with little or no ﬂow for spawning (echelle & riggs 1972; love 2004). off-channel alligator gars appeared to move into oxbow habitats during ﬂood connections. although based on a limited sample (n = 19), alligator gar abundance signiﬁcantly increased in oxbow habitats during the wet year, and all were juveniles. the alligator gar size distribution probably was skewed due to gear sampling bias. throughout the study, there was evidence of large ﬁsh escaping capture (large holes in the multiﬁlament gillnet), and a large alligator gar was observed in big bend oxbow during a ﬂood connection. adult alligator gars may move into oxbow habitats during ﬂoods to exploit abundant prey, and subsequently return to the river channel. by contrast, juvenile alligator gars appear to remain in oxbows for extended periods. there was no evidence that juvenile longnose gars moved into, or remained within oxbow habitats, based on average sl of longnose gars in the two habitats v2 = 0.511, (river = 727 mm, d.f. = 1, p = 0.48). a potential advantage of juveniles remaining in oxbow habitats is enhanced foraging, oxbow = 700 mm, resource partitioning among gar growth and survival, which have been shown in other species (sommer et al. 2001). diet partitioning based on high diet overlap, spotted and longnose gars do not seem to partition food resources. other studies of piscivorous ﬁshes in rivers have shown that diets often are similar for species that partition habitats (jepsen et al. 1997, sala & ballesteros 1997; wheeler & allen 2003). diet partitioning may be more prevalent among species that co-occur in the same habitat (winemiller 1989; bacheler et al. 2004; peli- cice & agostinho 2006). fishes comprised a major portion of the diet of both spotted and longnose gars, but they were not strict piscivores (appendix i). the two species consumed both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and longnose gars consumed terrestrial vertebrates as well. gars tend to consume prey in proportion to their availability (holloway 1954; goodyear 1967; dugas et al. 1976; seidensticker 1987; snedden et al. 1999). physical and environmental characteristics of oxbows have been shown to determine ﬁsh assemblage structure, and ﬁsh assemblages in big bend and moehlman’s oxbow differ, especially during periods of isolation (winemiller et al. 2000; zeug et al. 2005). these differences in ﬁsh assemblage structure were reﬂected in the diets of spotted gars in the two habitats. in big bend, sunﬁsh were the most abundant ﬁsh (46.1% of total prey ﬁsh cpue) and also were the most important ﬁsh in the diets of spotted gars. crayﬁsh, however, were the most important food item overall for spotted gars in big bend oxbow. crayﬁsh were abundant (c. r. robertson and s. c. zeug, personal observation) during the autumn and winter of the dry year when big bend oxbow was desiccating and ﬁsh abundances decreased. for a 6-month period (autumn and winter of the dry year), spotted gars in big bend consumed only crayﬁsh until a ﬂood connection in the spring reﬁlled the oxbow. in moehlman’s oxbow, shad were the most abundant ﬁsh (38% of total prey ﬁsh cpue), and also were the most important prey in spotted gar diets. longnose gars in the brazos river did not seem to follow this trend of consuming the most abundant food resource in their habitat. in the brazos river, minnows were the most abundant ﬁsh, but comprised only a small portion (8.5%) of longnose gar diets. based on electivities, longnose gars were strongly selecting against minnows. similarly, spotted gars selected against the second most abundant ﬁsh in both oxbows, mosquitoﬁsh (poeciliidae), with only one individual consumed during the entire 2-year study. gars prob- ably select against minnows and mosquitoﬁsh because of their small size. minnows and mosquitoﬁsh are 125 robertson et al. among the smallest ﬁshes in the system and are probably not easily detected or captured by gars (lundvall et al. 1999; do¨rner & wagner 2003). (fig. 2) in tropical ﬂoodplain systems, ﬁshes have been shown to increase their diet breadth during ﬂood periods (winemiller & kelso-winemiller 1994; balcombe et al. 2005). spotted gars in both big bend and moehlman’s oxbows followed this pattern, with greater diet breadth during the wet year. moreover, seasonal increases in diet breadth within years coincided with connections with the river channel. however, the opposite was observed for the longnose gar. longnose gar diet breadth decreased during the wet year. seasonal decreases in diet breadth within years also coincided with river channel connections. thus, longnose gars seem to forage opportunistically on pulses of abundant prey according to ﬂood dynamics. during ﬂood connections (fig. 1), shad were an important component in diets of longnose gars in the river channel. shad abundances are typically low in the river channel, and high in oxbows and ﬂoodplain lakes (winemiller et al. 2000; miranda 2005; barko et al. 2006; pegg et al. 2006). shad abundance increased in the brazos river channel following ﬂood connections (fig. 4). this difference in prey spatial distributions creates a pulsed food subsidy (winemiller & jepsen 2004; hoeinghaus et al. 2006) for longnose gars in the river channel. based on electivity values, longnose gars selected shad when their abundance in the river channel increased follow- ing river–oxbow connections (dry year–autumn: and wet year–summer: 51.5%, 95.9%, winter: 99.5%). the relative size (lundvall et al. 1999; do¨rner & wagner 2003; gill 2003) and mobility (savino & stein 1989; ostrand et al. 2004) of shad probably make them vulnerable to large sit-and- wait predators such as gars. spring: 73.1%; spotted gars in brazos river oxbow habitats probably beneﬁted from pulsed subsidies from the river channel. in both oxbows, ﬂoods were followed by an increased abundance of juvenile catﬁsh, prob- ably originating from the river channel. catﬁsh were the most selected prey for spotted gars in oxbows, as well as longnose gars in the river channel. allochth- onous food resources also were found in the diets of spotted gars. grasshoppers were the most important diet item for spotted gars in big bend during the summer ﬂood of the wet year when numerous grasshoppers were observed on the water surface of an inundated pasture. the physical characteristics of oxbows (connection frequency) inﬂuence gar diets as well. among the three habitats sampled, the river channel is the most dynamic habitat, followed by big bend oxbow which connects frequently with the river channel. moehl- man’s oxbow requires higher ﬂow rates for lateral 126 connections with the river channel and therefore is a relatively stable environment. this pattern was strongly reﬂected in the diet ordination (fig. 3). in big bend oxbow, diets shifted from crayﬁsh during 6 months when the oxbow was desiccating, to a diet dominated by ﬁshes brought into the oxbow during a ﬂood. in the brazos river, catﬁsh were the most important prey of longnose gars, but the diet shifted toward greater shad consumption following ﬂoods. spotted gars in moehlman’s oxbow had a relatively stable diet comprised mostly of shad and sunﬁsh, but they consumed more catﬁsh after ﬂoods. thus, relatively unpredictable ﬂood pulses seem to be an important factor controlling upper food web dynamics in this temperate lowland river. acknowledgements we thank d. lightsey and j.t. lyons for granting us access to study sites. we also would like to thank all the individuals who assisted during ﬁeld sampling:
