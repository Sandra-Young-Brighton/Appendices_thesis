perca ﬂavescens; spatial distribution; home range; telemetry introduction lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush) is a cold-water stenotherm that occupies a high trophic position in many cold, deep boreal lakes across canada (gunn & pitblado 2004). late maturation and narrow habitat requirements combine to make lake_trout extremely sensitive to human disturbance, such as over-harvest, climate warming and species introductions (martin & fry 1972; ryder & johnson 1972; schindler et al. 1996; vander zanden et al. 1999). introductions of both native and non-native (exotic) ﬁsh species can drastically alter community structure and decouple historic predator–prey relationships, resulting in al- tered pathways of energy ﬂow to top predatory ﬁsh species like lake_trout (vander zanden et al. 1999; morbey et al. 2007). lake_trout exist within a continuum of food-web communities that range from a heavy reliance upon littoral production to complete reliance upon pelagic forage species (martin 1966; vander zanden & rasmussen 1996). the potential for negative impacts of species introductions appear to be greatest when efﬁcient littoral predators, such as smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu), are intro- duced to lakes where lake_trout are highly dependent upon littoral forage (vander zanden et al. 1999). lake_trout prefer cold-water temperatures, typically 10–15 °c, and high dissolved oxygen (do) concen- trations (>4–6 mgæl)1) (martin 1952; martin & olver 1980; clarke et al. 2004). during stratiﬁed periods, the upper and lower habitat boundaries deﬁned by temperature and do, respectively, signiﬁcantly reduce habitat available to lake_trout (plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009). for lake_trout populations where pelagic prey correspondence: p. j. blanchﬁeld, fisheries and oceans canada, freshwater institute, 501 university crescent, winnipeg, mb r3t 2n6, canada. e-mail: paul.blanchﬁeld@dfo-mpo.gc.ca reproduced with the permission of the minister of fisheries and oceans canada. 300 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00548.x ﬁsh are absent, reduced access to warm, food-rich littoral areas during stratiﬁcation imposes the need for extensive omnivory. omnivorous lake_trout popula- tions are small-bodied, often referred to as ‘stunted’ (pazzia et al. 2002) or ‘planktivorous’ (konkle & sprules 1986), yet stable isotope analyses show they acquire about half of their energy annually from littoral ﬁsh (vander zanden & rasmussen 1996). when smallmouth bass or rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) are introduced, they out-compete lake_trout for littoral prey, forcing them to acquire most of their energy (80%) from less proﬁtable pelagic prey such as zooplankton (vander zanden et al. 1999). alterna- tively, introductions of prey species with summer habitat preferences that overlap those of lake_trout have the potential to beneﬁt these populations. for example, introduction of lake cisco (coregonus arte- dii) to lakes lacking pelagic forage ﬁsh increased lake_trout growth, fecundity and abundance (martin 1970; matuszek et al. 1990). our understanding of the effects of species intro- ductions to lake_trout populations is largely based on the analyses of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, which have been used extensively to determine diet origin (littoral vs. pelagic) and trophic position, respectively (vander zanden et al. 1999, 2004). stable isotopes integrate dietary changes over extended periods of time in long-lived, slow-growing species and are useful for reconstructing historical changes to lake_trout populations following species introductions (morbey et al. 2007; schmidt et al. 2009). although feeding location is often implied from stable isotope analyses, direct evidence for changes in lake_trout habitat use that accompanies dietary shifts associated with species introductions is limited. yet, understand- ing changes in habitat use by lake_trout is critically important because top-level mobile predators serve as key integrators of littoral and pelagic food webs (schindler & scheuerell 2002; mccann et al. 2005). incorporation of littoral production by pelagic prey is one example of habitat coupling in aquatic systems, and one in which lake_trout play a vital role (mccann et al. 2005). introduction of pelagic forage to lakes lacking such prey is predicted to signiﬁcantly reduce littoral habitat use by lake_trout and should be expressed through changes in pelagic and spatial distribution. here, we use acoustic telemetry to quantify changes in habitat use by a population of lake_trout that experienced a shift in forage base. lake 626 at the experimental lakes area (ela) is a typical small boreal lake that historically contained a forage community comprised of littoral cyprinids with lake_trout as the sole top predator. yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), a common forage species known to inhabit both nearshore and offshore areas (scott & crossman 1973; sandheinrich & hubert 1984; craig habitat use of lake_trout 1987), became established in lake 626. overlap in habitat between yellow perch and lake_trout during summer stratiﬁcation can account for greater con- sumption of ﬁsh compared to lakes with only littoral cyprinid communities (martin 1952). consequently, yellow perch forage allows for lake_trout growth rates that are similar to populations with pelagic forage present (martin 1952). introduction of yellow perch into a cyprinid-dominated lake provided a unique opportunity to examine the effect of a change in forage base on lake_trout habitat use during the stratiﬁed period. we compared data before (2001) and after (2008) yellow perch introduction to determine whether lake_trout habitat use reﬂected a deeper, offshore prey community (martin 1952). we hypothesised that lake_trout would have a deeper pelagic distribution with yellow perch as prey (2008) compared to when littoral cyprinids were the dominant forage (2001). we also hypothesised that lake_trout should alter their spatial distribution by reducing littoral presence and home range size in response to greater habitat overlap with yellow perch in the offshore region, which we directly tested using telemetry data. study area we used acoustic telemetry to examine the pelagic and spatial distributions of lake_trout in two boreal shield lakes at the ela in north-western ontario. lake 626 (l626) is a fourth-order, oligotrophic lake with a maximum depth of 12 m and an area of 26.2 ha. historically, ﬁsh species in this lake consisted of lake chub (couesius plumbeus), long nose dace (rhinich- thys cataractae), slimy sculpin (cottus cognatus), brook stickleback (culaea inconstans), fathead min- now (pimephales promelas), northern redbelly dace (phoxinus eos), white sucker (catostomus commer- soni), ﬁnescale dace (phoxinus neogaeus) and pearl dace (margariscus margarita). sometime between 2001 and 2008, yellow perch entered l626 and have become the most abundant forage ﬁsh (97% of total catch); presently, few littoral minnows are captured (p.j. blanchﬁeld, unpublished data). trap net catch per unit effort (cpue) data indicate that littoral cyprinids were much more abundant prior to introduction of yellow perch (110 ﬁshætrap)1æday)1) than in 2008 when yellow perch were established (2 ﬁshætrap)1æ day)1) (m.d. rennie, fisheries and oceans canada, unpublished data). the capture of dense schools of young-of-year (yoy) perch (fork length, 50 mm) in shallow (2 m), offshore combined with observed regurgitation of yellow perch by lake_trout angled in the offshore suggests that lake_trout forage on yellow perch in offshore areas (p.j. blanchﬁeld, unpublished data). lake 373 (l373) is a ﬁrst-order, oligotrophic lake (zmax = 21 m; area = 27.3 ha) that areas 301 wall & blanchﬁeld serves as a long-term reference lake for the area and was used as the control for this study. fish species in l373 include lake_trout, white sucker, pearl dace, ﬁnescale dace, northern redbelly dace and slimy sculpin. mysis diluvania (formerly relicta), which can be important pelagic forage for lake_trout during summer stratiﬁcation, is also found in l373. material and methods environmental conditions temperature and do proﬁles were collected approxi- mately every 2 weeks in each year during the study period (july–august) using a ﬁeld probe (model 550 a, ysi inc., yellow springs, oh, usa) at 1-m depth increments in both study lakes. we compared mean 15 °c isotherms and 6 mgæl)1 do isopleths between years for the study period because these variables most accurately deﬁne the upper and lower boundaries, respectively, for lake_trout habitat occupancy in ela lakes (plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009). temperature and do values from proﬁles were estimated by linear interpolation between depth values (to 0.1 m) and paired for similar days (n = 5) between years. telemetry lake_trout were captured in early may by angling and surgically implanted with transmitters following estab- lished procedures (see blanchﬁeld et al. 2005, 2009a; plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009). we selected individual lake_trout >700 g (2001: 767–1127 g; 2008: 745– 1320 g) to ensure tag ⁄ ﬁsh mass ratios <2% in air (winter 1983). in 2001, we used a combination of continuous (model ct82-3; sonotronics inc., tucson, az, usa) and pressure- sensing transmitters (model dt97; sonotronics inc.), whereas in 2008 we used coded pressure-sensing transmitters (model v13p-1l; vemco ltd., shad bay, ns, canada). transmitters recorded water temperature to ±0.1 °c and depth to ±0.1 m and were calibrated in temperature-sensing their respective study lake prior to surgical implanta- tion (table 1). we converted each recorded water temperature from acoustic transmitters to a depth (and vice versa) based on 0.1-m interpolation of the temperature proﬁles taken at 1-m intervals on each day of manual tracking in 2001 for comparison with 2008 data. in 2001, data on lake_trout depth distributions were acquired through manually locating individual ﬁsh in l626 and l373 (see following section and table 1). in 2008, a series of receivers (vr2, vr2w; vemco ltd.), permanently ﬁxed at stations throughout the lakes to provide maximum coverage, continuously logged the depth of tagged lake_trout and recorded time of detection (see plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009). gaps in data collection occurred only when receivers were removed for download (1 day every 2 weeks). all replicate detections (those <2 min apart) were removed to eliminate psuedoreplication. we acquired lake_trout spatial data both by manual location and using a radio acoustic positioning telem- etry (rapt) system (vrap; vemco ltd.) following methods described in blanchﬁeld et al. (2005, 2009a,b) (for data collection methods see table 1). the rapt system consists of three moored buoys arranged in a triad 300 m equidistant apart. individ- ual buoys detect transmitter signals via an omnidirec- tional hydrophone and transmit data by radio to an onshore base station and computer, where software calculates ﬁsh positions (blanchﬁeld et al. 2009b). positioning accuracy in l373 is 5–16 m when lake_trout are detected near the triad (blanchﬁeld et al. 2005). manually locating acoustically tagged ﬁsh involved using a 4.7-m aluminium boat with a 9.9-hp outboard motor (4-stroke), directional hydrophone and receiver (model usr-5w, sonotronics; model vr-60; vemco); a method determined to provide accurate positional data (£15 m) but not affect lake_trout behaviour (as described in blanchﬁeld et al. 2005). a ﬁsh position was recorded (gps model 60csx; garmin ltd., olathe, ks, usa) once the transmitter signal was at maximum strength under a low gain receiver setting

reference lake 373 in these same years. data collection methods included manual positioning, data loggers and an automated positioning system (see material and methods). in 2008, three ﬁsh in both l626 and l373 were not used for spatial analysis because of insufﬁcient detections. mean (± 1 se) depth, percentage of detections in littoral areas and home range (minimum convex polygon) were

arcview gis 3.2a (environmental systems research institute inc., toronto, on, canada) to quantify the proportion of littoral detections, deﬁned as the region where lake bottom depth was <5 m. we calculated home range size using the minimum convex polygon (mcp) method tool in arcgis 9.2 (environ- mental systems research institute inc., toronto, on, canada) (hawth’s tools) omitting any overlap with terrestrial regions. statistical analysis we compared within-lake differences in lake_trout habitat use before (2001) and after (2008) introduction of yellow perch for the impact (l626) and control (l373) lakes separately. we focused our sampling effort to the period of maximum thermal stratiﬁcation (july and august) as we expected this period to reﬂect greatest differences in habitat use by lake_trout. only data collected between 9:00 and 16:00 were used, to match data collected in 2001. to account for within- lake variation in environmental conditions between years, we tested for differences in mean 15 °c isotherm and 6 mgæl)1 do isopleth depths. parametric statistics (t-tests) were used to analyse all variables using statistica 6.1 (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa) (a = 0.05),

slightly 2001 (6.3 ± 0.17 m) compared to 2008 (6.8 ± 0.22 m). average july–august 15 °c isotherm depths were 0.3 and 0.5 m deeper in the study and reference lakes, this difference was not

p = 0.04) and l373 (t7 = 2.6, p = 0.03) compared to 2008. in l626, mean do isopleths for 2001 and 2008 in 2008, but (l626: habitat use of lake_trout were 9.6 m (±0.24 m) and 8.7 m (±0.19 m), respec- tively. in l373, the do isopleth depths for 2001 and 2008 were 15.2 m (±0.15 m) and 14.2 m (±0.47 m), respectively. pelagic distribution of lake_trout acoustically tagged lake_trout occupied much of the water column during mid-summer (july–august) in both lakes (fig. 1). estimates of core habitat (2.5th– 97.5th percentiles of all detections, see plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009) showed that lake_trout in l626 were slightly shallower and occupied a narrower range of depths (5.0–8.9 m) with littoral minnow forage (2001) compared to 2008 when the main prey species was yellow perch (5.4–10.9 m). the major difference in lake_trout depth distributions between years in l626 could be attributed to the use of deeper waters when perch were the primary prey species (2008, fig. 1b). these greater depths were not occupied when forage was dominated by littoral cyprinids (2001, fig. 1a). in l373, core habitat use by lake_trout was shallower with greater ranges (5.5–16.2 m) in 2001 (fig. 1c) compared to 2008 (7.6–16.3 m) (fig. 1d). the forage dominant on average, lake_trout occupied deeper portions of the water column (1.4 m deeper) after the introduction of yellow perch to l626 than in 2001, when littoral cyprinids were present (t17 = )4.6, p < 0.01) (fig. 2a). the difference in mean lake_trout depth between years (1.5 m) in l373 was similar to that in l626, but not statistically signiﬁcant (t19 = )1.6, p = 0.13) owing to greater variability of l373 depth distributions between years (table 1). although quantitatively similar, it is impor- tant to note that deeper habitat use by lake_trout in 2008 was achieved differently for the study and reference lakes. in l626, the lower boundary of lake_trout core habitat extended deeper into the hypolim- nion in 2008, with little change to the upper range. the opposite pattern was observed in l373, whereby a shift in core habitat use was driven by a deeper upper habitat boundary and little change for the lower range in 2008 (fig. 1). the deeper depth distribution in 2008 resulted in lake_trout occupying cooler mean temper- atures compared to 2001 for l626 (2001: 10.5 °c; 2008: 8.7 °c; t17 = 3.7, p < 0.01) and l373 (2001: 8.0 °c; 2008: 6.2 °c; t19 = 2.9, p = 0.01). spatial distribution of lake_trout lake_trout were detected in nearshore areas (15% of all detections) when littoral forage ﬁsh were the dominant prey community in l626. after yellow perch became the primary prey species in 2008, lake_trout presence in the littoral zone decreased by more than half (7% of all detections). overall, a signiﬁcantly greater propor-

(a) l626 2001; (b) l626 2008; (c) l373 2001; and (d) l373 2008. the forage ﬁsh community of l626 was dominated by littoral cyprinids in 2001 and yellow perch in 2008. the depths of the 15 °c isotherm (upper solid line) and 6 mgæl)1 dissolved oxygen (do) isopleth (lower dashed line) are shown. temperature isotherms, do isopleths and lake_trout daily core habitat (2001) were interpolated between days. for number of detections, see table 1. tion of lake_trout detections (t14 = 2.5, p = 0.03) were in the littoral region in 2001 compared to when yellow perch were the dominant forage (fig. 2b). lake_trout were rarely detected in the littoral region of l373 in late summer months (2001, 1.8%; 2008, 4.1%), and their use of this area did not differ between study years (u16 = 24.0, z = )0.8, p = 0.40) (table 1). associated with a shift to more offshore habitat use in the presence of yellow perch, lake_trout in l626 exhibited dramatic reductions in summer home range areas compared to the control lake. on average, home range areas (calculated as the mcp) were 71% smaller for lake_trout in 2008 (table 1). mean home range areas decreased signiﬁcantly (u14 = 0.0, z = 3.25, p < 0.01), by an average of 8.3 ha, after the estab- lishment of yellow perch (fig. 2c). in reference l373, home range also decreased signiﬁcantly between study years (t16 = 2.40, p = 0.03), although the magnitude of this reduction (3.7 ha, 30%) was less than half of that observed by lake_trout in l626. discussion the pelagic and spatial distributions of lake_trout in a small, boreal lake were noticeably different before and after a change in forage base. after the establishment of yellow perch, lake_trout occupied deeper depths, reduced time spent in the littoral region and showed a substantial decrease in home range size relative to when the lake was dominated by nearshore cyprinid 304 forage. consequences of species introductions are often difﬁcult to assess because the unpredictable timing of natural introductions often prevents collec- tion of habitat data ‘before’ and ‘after’ such events. we faced such a challenge in this study, whereby data were constrained to a single year prior to and after yellow perch introduction. nonetheless, direct spatial measurements, such as those carried out in this study, identify important ﬁne-scale features of habitat use and behaviour that provide a more complete picture of the potential consequences of species invasions (cunjak et al. 2005). the ﬁndings of this study provide one of the ﬁrst attempts to document changes in habitat use and behaviour of a top predator following the introduction of a new prey ﬁsh species. in the presence of yellow perch forage, lake_trout in l626 were frequently detected in deep areas of the lake (9–11 m) and often outside of the lower habitat boundary delineating favourable do concentrations (<6 mgæl)1; fig. 1b). the use of deeper waters when yellow perch were present was not related to differ- ences in the location of the 6 mgæl)1 do isopleth between years, which should have resulted in a shallower lake_trout distribution in 2008, not the observed deeper habitat occupancy. greater presence of lake_trout in l626 hypolimnetic waters is perhaps indicative of foraging on large solitary perch in deep offshore regions during the day (sandheinrich & hubert 1984; craig 1987). use of deeper water by lake_trout in ela lakes and elsewhere has coincided with a (a) (b) (c) 0 5 10 15 20 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 ) m ( h t p e d ) % ( s n o i t c e t e d l a r o t t i l ) a h ( e z s i e g n

individual bars represent the grand mean (+1 se) of (a) depth, (b) use of littoral region and (c) home range area (minimum convex polygon) in 2001 and 2008. the forage ﬁsh community of l626 was dominated by littoral cyprinids in 2001 and yellow perch in 2008 (shaded bars). sample sizes and data collection methods are in table 1. deeper 15 °c isotherm depth, which results from warmer air temperatures (mackenzie-grieve & post 2006; plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009). however, this phenomenon was not apparent in our study lakes where climatic and limnological conditions did not differ greatly between study years. we originally hypothesised that lake_trout would occupy a deeper position in the water column because they would spend less time foraging for cyprinids in shallow habitat use of lake_trout the presence of littoral areas. however, tightly grouped schools of yoy perch in offshore regions during the daytime may be one reason why we did not see a substantive difference in the upper range of core habitat compared to when littoral minnows, found in similarly shallow water but in the nearshore, were the main forage. a key ﬁnding of this study is that lake_trout spatial distribution changed following the introduction of a pelagic prey species. in lakes with no pelagic forage, summer feeding by lake_trout involves excursions into shallow, nearshore regions to which minnows are conﬁned (martin 1952; morbey et al. 2006). on average, 15% of lake_trout detections in l626 were in the nearshore area, suggesting lake_trout may have been actively foraging on littoral cyprinids when this was the only prey available. lake_trout presence in the littoral region was signiﬁcantly reduced (>50%) after yellow perch were established; showing a decreased reliance on inshore areas that previously would have been the only source of ﬁsh forage. unlike littoral cyprinid species, yellow perch actively migrate in schools between inshore and offshore regions of lakes (hergenrader & hasler 1968; craig 1987), which, based on offshore gill-netting and angling data, appeared to provide novel pelagic foraging opportu- nities for lake_trout in l626. reduced reliance on littoral areas by lake_trout when yellow perch became established was coupled with sizeable reductions (71%) in home range areas. it is possible that the observed change in lake_trout spatial habitat use in l626 is indicative of a signiﬁcant change in foraging behaviour whereby lake_trout target tightly spaced, offshore schools of perch. extensive reductions in littoral use and home range size after species intro- duction in l626 were not observed in the reference system during the same time period. the apparent habitat shift by lake_trout in l626 to offshore regions resembles piscivorous lake_trout populations whose diet primarily consists of pelagic forage (martin 1970; vander zanden & rasmussen 1996; zimmerman et al. 2009). these ﬁndings highlight the ability of telemetry methods to detect ﬁne-scale changes in habitat use not easily detectable by other indirect measures of spatial distribution. we veriﬁed that habitat changes were not attributed to differences in equipment between years. tempera- ture-sensing transmitters can lag in their response to rapid changes in water temperature (snucins & gunn 1995) and might have reduced the ability to detect brief warm-water excursions in 2001 (morbey et al. 2006). this would bias our data to a shallower depth distribution by lake_trout when pressure-sensing transmitters were used in 2008, opposite to what we observed. likewise, we conﬁrmed that the greater amount of data collected from passive receivers (2008) 305 wall & blanchﬁeld did not bias lake_trout depth distribution through within-year comparison with manual collection data. we tested whether home range size in the reference lake was reduced because of limited coverage of the southern portion of the lake by the automated positioning system (2008) compared to manual track- ing (2001). with this analysis, lake_trout home ranges in l373 were 22–28% smaller than in 2001 (depend- ing on data) and not statistically different between years, suggesting that the signiﬁcantly smaller home ranges in 2008 were perhaps a result of different methodologies. we note that lake_trout spatial data in l626, where we observed some of the greatest changes, were collected using the same methods between years. fewer lake_trout were monitored in 2001, but this difference in sample size was consistent for the study and reference lakes. a reanalysis of 2008 data using multiple sets of randomly selected ﬁsh to match numbers tagged in 2001 resulted in similar estimates of depth occupancy, littoral presence and home range size, albeit with increased variability. overall, differences in equipment and sample sizes between years did not bias our data, which suggests that observed changes in lake_trout habitat use in l626 arose from the introduction of yellow perch. ideally, we would have had several years of pre- and post-introduction telemetry data to strengthen our ability to quantify within- and between-lake differ- ences, especially because we observed qualitatively similar changes in the reference lake for some variables compared to l626 after the establishment of yellow perch. speciﬁcally, lake_trout in l373 were deeper and had smaller home ranges in 2008. greater lake_trout depth in 2008 was a result of a shallower upper boundary for core habitat in 2001, with no change in use of deep waters. this pattern is opposite to what we observed in l626, but produced a similar quantitative difference (1.5 m) in mean depth between years. we have previously demonstrated that the depth of the 15 °c isotherm can inﬂuence lake_trout in l373 (plumb & blanchﬁeld 2009), but we did not observe climate-mediated differences between years in this study. we have also previously documented levels of inter-individual variation between years in lake_trout depth occupancy (mean = 2.3 m, plumb 2006) and home range size (23%, blanchﬁeld et al. 2009a) in reference lake l373 similar to those observed between years in this study. after examining a suite of climatic, limnological and biotic variables, we believe that differences between years in depth and space use by lake_trout in l373 is primarily a reﬂection of inter- annual variability that is not altogether different from previous observations from this lake. lake_trout in both lakes had similar home ranges in 2001 (table 1), and the lakes are of similar size, so the large reduction in home range (71%) that accompanied the introduc- 306 tion of yellow perch was well beyond that expected by individual variability. the collection of multiple years before and after a species introduction would allow us to better account for year-to-year variation. at present, we are not able to offer a deﬁnitive explanation for changes in the reference system apart from variability, but believe that the greater magnitude of the observed changes in l626 habitat use by lake_trout compared to the reference system are likely driven by a change in forage base. previous studies have found that when quality pelagic forage was introduced (martin 1970) or planktivorous lake_trout were transplanted to lakes with pelagic forage (martin 1966), ‘stunted’ lake_trout experienced increased growth, size and fecundity (matuszek et al. 1990). a positive growth response of lake_trout to the availability of pelagic forage has been attributed to a number of factors, including access to greater numbers of larger prey, which can increase foraging efﬁciency (mason et al. 1995, 1998; pazzia et al. 2002). we predict that the presence of a littoral–pelagic prey species may beneﬁt lake_trout populations that lack pelagic forage. many of the unexploited lake_trout populations at the ela do not contain a pelagic forage ﬁsh and are characterised by small body size, usually <500 mm, low, but stable annual abundance (12 ﬁshæha)1) and recruitment with high annual survival (>80%; mills et al. 2000, 2002). comparison between lakes with yellow perch vs. cyprinid forage in algonquin park showed that early lake_trout growth was similar between food webs, but growth rate increased substantially after age 5 only for the population with yellow perch forage (martin 1952). the long-term implications of yellow perch introduction to l626 and the resulting shift in lake_trout spatial distribution could yield a lake_trout population with improved growth. however, an inter- esting question that arises is how might the entire l626 food web respond to such an introduction given the predicted substantial reduction in omnivory by lake_trout and decreased reliance upon littoral produc- tion. it will be several years until we understand the population-level responses of lake_trout and ecosys- tem-level changes of this species introduction. this study demonstrates how a simple species introduction could be affecting habitat use and behaviour of a mobile top predator. increased human presence in pristine boreal lead to further species introductions and an understanding of the conse- quences of these introductions will improve our ability to predict how lake_trout populations may respond. lakes will acknowledgements the authors wish to thank lori tate
