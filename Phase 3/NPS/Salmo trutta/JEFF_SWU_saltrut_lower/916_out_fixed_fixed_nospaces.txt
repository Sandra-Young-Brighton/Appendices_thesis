four in the sea and two in rivers along the west coast of finland, and from a fresh water lake for comparison. the concentration of several elements showed significant differences among sampling sites. otolith ba concentrations were higher at the northern sampling sites compared to the southern ones, thereby showing negative association to capture-habitat salinity. in contrast, otolith sr and zn concentrations were lower at the northern sampling sites, thereby associating positively to capture-habitat salinity. otolith mn concentrations did not associate with latitude or salinity but markedly varied between sampling sites. elevated fe concentrations occurred in fish otoliths from the two northernmost sites. ca concentrations were at the same levels in otoliths from all whitefish samples. otoliths of whitefish from the lake had very high ba and low sr concentrations compared to concentrations in otoliths from whitefish in the sea and rivers. our results show that otolith elemental characteristics of whitefish vary considerably at various geographic scales showing high potential for population identification using elemental fingerprints. analysis of otolith elemental characteristics may therefore provide an efficient tool for the identification of main areas of residence, spawning locations, and migration routes, thus contributing towards the sustainable management of whitefish stocks. key words: otolith; element; whitefish; anadromous; baltic sea introduction to manage fish stocks and understand their migration patterns, identification of fish populations and their geographical origin is a prerequisite. this is true for european whitefish (coregonus_lavaretus) in the gulf of bothnia, where whitefish are a commercially and recreationally important species. tagging studies have shown that they occur in two sympatric forms with similar outer features: a sea-spawning and an anadromous river-spawning form (lehtonen & him- berg 1979, 1992; lehtonen 1981). sea-spawning whitefish form relatively stationary populations and spawn close to the seashore. river-spawning white- fish undertake feeding migrations in the sea follow- ing spawning. these two whitefish forms live in mixed populations in the sea outside breeding loca- tions and time. river-spawning whitefish can migrate correspondence: h. h€agerstrand, laboratory of aquatic pathobiology & hus€o biological station, environmental and marine biology, faculty of science and engineering, abo akademi university, biocity, fi-20520 abo, finland. e-mail: hhagerst@abo.fi 66 doi: 10.1111/eff.12255 long distances, for example, between rivers and estu- aries in the tornio region in the north of the gulf of bothnia and the aland islands and the archipelago sea in the south (>700 km) (lehtonen & himberg 1979, 1992; lehtonen 1981; leskel€a et al. 2002). rich food sources are the probable reason for the southward migration, while preferential spawning locations are the driving force for the northward migration. river-spawning whitefish remain in the south for several (3–6) years, until maturing, and therefore abundantly occur in the archipelago around the aland islands, where the feeding conditions are particularly favourable (lehtonen 1981). they have no known spawning locations at the aland islands. largely as a result of anthropogenic destruction of their spawning rivers and the conditions in them, the population of river-spawning whitefish has declined over recent decades and they are presently listed among endangered species (helcom 2013). otoliths are fish tags (campana 1999; elsdon et al. 2008). sagittal otoliths (ear-stones) are paired inert caco3 (aragonite) structures located in the skull of teleost (bony) fish. they play an important role in balance and hearing, and constantly grow during the lifetime of the fish. calcium and in particular trace elements from water are with the aid of a protein matrix in a multistage process layered onto the caco3 structure forming the otolith. otoliths are exposed to elements in endolymph after elements being initially taken up into blood by the gills and intestine (payan et al. 2002). diet and temperature normally have a limited effect on the incorporation of elements into otoliths (bath et al. 2000; walther & thorrold 2006; lin et al. 2007; engstedt et al. 2012; doubleday et al. 2013). some elements such as sr and ba are incorporated into otoliths due to their sim- ilarity with calcium according to electric charge and ionic radius size, which allow them to replace cal- cium in caco3. zn, mn and fe show an affinity for otolith protein (miller et al. 2006; izzo et al. 2014). incorporation of elements (e.g. sr, ba, zn, mn, fe) into otoliths normally increases along with increased elemental concentration in the ambient water (cam- pana 1999; bath et al. 2000; elsdon & gillanders 2005; zimmerman 2005; clarke et al. 2007). sr concentration typically increases and ba con- centration decreases with increasing salinity of sea water (campana 1999; gillanders 2005; tabouret et al. 2010). the salinity-related sr and ba concentra- tions are usually reflected in their partition into oto- liths (bath et al. 2000; secor & rooker 2000; zimmerman 2005; macdonald & crook 2010; tabouret et al. 2010; engstedt et al. 2012). however, it is not known whether the relatively minor salinity differences occurring in the brackish gulf of bothnia are reflected in otolith sr and ba concentrations in otolith elemental characteristics of whitefish whitefish. besides sr and ba, other elements such as zn, mn and fe may help to distinguish fish from dif- ferently composed ambient water, and also be of use in identifying migrating fish (thorrold et al. 1998; clarke et al. 2007; chang et al. 2012; heidemann et al. 2012; engstedt et al. 2014). whole otolith analysis has been previously used for distinguishing between fish groups, for studying fish migration between chemically different waters and to assign fish to certain spawning and feeding locations (campana 1999; elsdon et al. 2008). in this work, we analysed elemental concentrations in whole otoliths (sagittae) with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (icp-oes). specifically, we aimed to evaluate whether otolith elemental (ca, sr, ba, zn, mn, fe) concentrations differ significantly among whitefish samples collected from different geo- graphic areas in the gulf of bothnia (baltic sea) where the salinity ranges from ~1 to 7%. this study represents a first evaluation of the suitability of otolith elemental fingerprints for fish discrimination in the gulf of both- nia. the knowledge collected may have relevance for the sustainable management of whitefish stocks. materials and methods study area the gulf of bothnia stretches ~725 km from the aland islands in the south, to the tornio region in the north and covers an area of 117,000 km2 (fig. 1) (helcom 2010; the baltic sea environment and ecology 2013; the baltic sea portal 2013). it is a shal- low sea with an average depth of ~60 m, having two deep graves (250 and 295 m). along the finnish side, an archipelago with shallow waters covers the coast. the tides are minute (≤2 cm), but water-level fluctua- tions driven by wind and air pressure can be consider- able (metres), particularly in the north. large areas of the sea area are usually covered by ice every year. the surface water temperature is ~0–2 °c in february– march. in july–august, the surface water temperature in the south (aland islands), and for shorter periods in the north (tornio area) reaches ~18 °c (siegel & gerth 2013). the salinity of the water in the gulf of bothnia forms a weak gradient as it receives fresh water from several large rivers in the north and saltier post-atlantic water from the baltic proper in the south. besides fresh water, rivers also carry discharges. sills at the aland islands (~70 m) and the quark (~25 m) reduce the flow of saltier bottom water from the south. the salinity of the brackish surface water (at 1 m depth) decreases from about 6 to 2% in the south– north direction. in the rivers and their estuaries, the salinity is lower. there is only a slight increase in salinity with the depth because the water is weakly 67 h€agerstrand et al. spawning grounds and season. two sea samples were collected outside the breeding season (a, kobba klintar (mixed sample, himberg et al. 2015) and e, kalix). location inari (g) was included for compar- ison as it is a freshwater lake. the samples from the southern part of the gulf of bothnia were collected in the sea from reefs close to the kobba klintar in june–august 2012 (mixed stocks), and in mariehamn bay (slemmern) and tengs€oda bay during spawning in october–november 2012 (sea spawners) (fig. 1). fish were caught with standing gill nets. river spawners from the river kokem€aki (pori) on the west coast of finland were collected with standing gill nets by local fishermen in november 2011. from the northern part of the sampling area, river spawners were caught with dipnets during spawning migration by local fishermen from the river tornio (tornio) in july 2013. whitefish were sampled with standing gill nets from the kalix archipelago during summer 2012, and from lake inari 2007 (fig. 1). fish weight was between 0.3 and 1.2 kg. otolith preparation and analysis sagittal otoliths were removed from fresh or thawed fish, rinsed with cleaning paper, soaked in water for 1 h, cleaned and air-dried on paper, air-dried for 24 h in open eppendorf tubes, weighed and stored in eppendorf tubes until analysis. whole sagittal oto- liths were analysed for elemental concentrations with a varian vista-mpx inductively coupled plasma- optical (atomic) emission spectrometer (icp-oes). samples were dissolved in 2 ml hno3 in the micro- wave accelerating system mars 5 (cem); 1200 w, 50% power, 15 min, 60 psi pressure, max tempera- ture 210 °c, 10-min hold time. after mineralisation, 8 ml water was added. calibration standard solu- tions were prepared from single element fluka branded certified reference materials for icp (ca, no. 94458;

secor & rooker 2000; zimmerman 2005; macdonald & crook 2010; tabouret et al. 2010; engstedt et al. 2012). otolith ba concentration has previously been reported to be a good predictor of salinity variations in estuaries (dorval et al. 2007). a negative associa- tion of otolith sr with latitude and a positive one with salinity in the gulf of bothnia has recently been indi- cated in eurasian perch and northern pike (lill et al. 2014a). in the present study, whitefish otolith ba concen- trations increased with latitude and decreased with increasing capture-habitat salinity (table 1). among the southern locations, otolith ba concentration var- ied slightly without an obvious direct relation to water salinity, being slightly higher at kobba klintar than at mariehamn, tengs€oda and kokem€aki. as the catch at kobba klintar represents a mixed group, we suggest that the relatively high average ba concentra- tion is due to the presence of river-spawning white- fish from the north. namely, whitefish from the river tornio had a markedly elevated otolith ba con- centration (table 1). our results on the uptake of ba and sr into otoliths reveal how fish migration compli- cates the interpretations of fish origin when bulk oto- lith elemental analysis is applied. our results further suggest that ba incorporation into otoliths peak at early ontogenesis, before feeding migration to the south. a peak of otolith ba incorporation in early life was recently shown in estuarine burbot (lota lota l.) in the baltic proper (rohtla et al. 2014a). similarly, baltic proper cod otolith ba concentrations were ele- vated in early life when compared to sr (limburg et al. 2011). apparently, the effects of water elemen- tal concentrations, fish age, water salinity and tem- perature (elsdon & gillanders 2002) on otolith element investigation. additional general factors to be regarded in forth- coming work are fish size and sex, as well as hydro- logical alterations in the sampling area. incorporation need further otolith sr concentrations were slightly higher in southern than in northern whitefish sampling sites otolith elemental characteristics of whitefish (table 1). it may be assumed that the occurrence of river-spawning whitefish at feeding grounds in the south will lower the average otolith sr concentration of mixed groups such as that at kobba klintar. simi- larly, the time spent in water of higher salinity during feeding migration in the south should increase the otolith sr concentration in river-spawning whitefish, for example, from the river tornio. such tendencies are seen (table 1), and the reasoning is supported by the results on otolith ba concentrations presented above. the lower otolith sr concentrations in otoliths of whitefish from river kokem€aki and kalix com- pared to whitefish from kobba klintar south of the aland islands indicate that the former groups do not migrate to the south of the aland islands for feeding. this has already been demonstrated for spawning whitefish from the river kokem€aki (hurme 1970; lehtonen 1981). the otolith sr concentration indi- cates that whitefish from the kalix archipelago are local and short-migrating, as has been previously suggested (lehtonen & himberg 1992). otolith zn concentrations slightly decreased with capture-site latitude from south to north (table 1). thus, zn showed a positive association with sr and a negative association with ba. natural mineralogical background (koljonen 1992; leivuori 1998) and sed- iment properties (pohl & hennings 1999; peltola et al. 2011) are known to influence water zn concen- trations in the gulf of bothnia. zn occurrence in the gulf of bothnia may be partly due to flow from the baltic sea proper, where zn from anthropogenic pol- lution accumulates in sediments and is released in anoxic conditions. the nature of the association between whitefish otolith zn concentrations and cap- ture-habitat latitude remains unclear. zn, like mn and fe, shows an affinity for otolith protein (miller et al. 2006; izzo et al. 2014). therefore, it is not surprising that zn and sr, a salinity indicator, show different patterns of accumulation in otoliths (limburg et al. 2003; lill et al. 2014), particularly in different envi- ronments of the fish (limburg & elfman 2010), and that zn incorporation depends on season (halden et al. 2000; limburg et al. 2003). interestingly, incorporation of zn into whitefish otoliths peaks, like that of ba, at early ontogenesis (lill et. 2014). in conclusion, a simple direct relation between otolith zn accumulation and habitat salinity seems less probable. otolith mn concentrations did not associate with latitude or capture-habitat salinity (table 1), but markedly varied between two spatially inhomoge- neous groups, whitefish from the relatively close areas mariehamn, tengs€oda and the river kokem€aki on one hand (lower mn levels), and whitefish from interdistant kobba klintar, kalix and the river tor- nio on the other hand (higher mn levels) (table 1). it 71 h€agerstrand et al. remains to be shown whether fish from the first group share similar short-migration feeding habitats. in the second group, whitefish from the river tornio and kobba klintar are known to share the same feed- ing habitat south of the aland islands (lehtonen & himberg 1979, 1992; lehtonen 1981; leskel€a et al. 2002). however, otolith sr levels indicate that white- fish from the kalix archipelago are stationary and do not migrate far south. mn is dissolved from bottom sediment during hypoxic conditions as shown by pakhomova et al. (2007) and limburg et al. (2011). their analyses revealed that bottom water mn con- centrations were higher south of the aland islands and lower west and north of the aland islands, thus providing a possible reason for the observed varia- tions in whitefish otolith mn concentrations in this area. the origin of elevated mn concentrations in whitefish from the kalix archipelago and the river tornio may be caused by river discharges. ingri & ponter (1984) reported that northern rivers in the gulf of bothnia transport mn to the sea. accordingly, mn in bottom surface sediment was higher (~29) in the northern part of the gulf of bothnia than in the southern part (leivuori 1998). the temporal stability of otolith zn and mn concentrations should be inves- tigated. otolith mn concentrations have been previ- ously reported not to associate with water salinity (elsdon & gillanders 2002, dorval et al. 2007). the pca ordination (fig. 3) visualises how spawning populations from the rivers tornio and kokem€aki, tengs€oda (sea) and mariehamn (sea) dis- tribute when plotted due to the concerted effect of their otolith elemental (ba, sr, zn, mn) concentra- tions (table 1). whitefish from the river tornio sep- arates from other sites due to high relative ba and mn otolith concentrations. river kokem€aki whitefish largely separate due to low otolith zn and sr concen- trations. otolith fe concentrations over the detection limit (2 lgg  1) occurred only in whitefish from the kalix archipelago and river tornio in the north. it is likely that the origin of elevated otolith fe concentrations is river discharges. northern rivers in the gulf of both- nia are known to transport excessive amounts of fe to the sea (ingri 1985). for otolith fe determination, blood contamination must be carefully avoided dur- ing otolith isolation. otolith weight analysis showed that otoliths of river kokem€aki whitefish were about double the weight of otoliths from the other sampling sites (table 1). similarly, their younger age) was markedly higher compared to river-spawning whitefish from the river tornio and tengs€oda aland. however, this is not surprising because from river kokem€aki are known to show faster growth than river-spawning whitefish fish length (despite 72 nearby river-spawning groups (lehtonen other 1981). this study shows that whitefish in the gulf of bothnia carry specific otolith elemental characteristics that separate them and map them to certain spawning and feeding regions and that this information can be obtained by bulk otolith elemental analysis. besides forthcoming studies on elemental composition and distribution (lill et al. 2015b) in whitefish otoliths, studies involving natural isotopes (gillanders 2005; torniainen et al. 2013; rohtla et al. 2014b), as well as genetic (macdonald & crook 2010; olsson et al. 2012; mccairns et al. 2012; ozerov et al. 2015) and proteomic (papakostas et al. 2014) investigations, will be highly beneficial in clarifying the stock struc- tures and migration details of whitefish in the gulf of bothnia. still, traditional studies involving tagging– recovery (leskel€a et al. 2009; engstedt et al. 2014), growth rate determination (lehtonen 1981) and gill raker counting (himberg et al. 2015) will continue to play important roles in these endeavours. for reveal- ing the detailed individual, life history migration pat- tern of whitefish elemental/isotopic scanning of polished otolith surfaces will remain an option (cam- pana 1999; heimbrandt et al. 2014). acknowledgements the authors declare no conflict of interest. the
