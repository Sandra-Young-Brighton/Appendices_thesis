endangered species; fish growth; monitoring introduction many factors influence freshwater growth rate, including food availability (filbert & hawkins 1995; metcalfe et al. 1999; imre et al. 2004), physical cover (thorpe 1987), stream temperature (myrick & cech 2000; marine & cech 2004; murphy et al. 2006), behavioural patterns (metcalfe et al. 1988, 1999), and intraspecific (keeley 2001) or interspeci- fic (reeves et al. 1987) competition. growth rate therefore integrates the environmental experience of an individual fish and is an important indicator of fish development (van den avyle & hayward 1999). for anadromous fish, increased freshwater growth rate decreases the time needed to attain minimum size thresholds for migration to saltwater (peven et al. 1994; cucherousset et al. 2005), potentially decreas- ing the at freshwater mortality. size risk of smoltification, which is the product of freshwater growth rate and residency time, can also influence marine survival (ward et al. 1989; lundqvist et al. 1994; tipping 1997). for atlantic salmon salmo_salar and steelhead trout oncorhynchus_mykiss, a life history trade-off exists between anadromy and residency (thorpe 1987; zimmerman & reeves 2000). resident matura- tion can occur in less time and with less mortality risk than anadromous maturation, but at the cost of reduced fecundity (kendall et al. 2015). changes in growth rate influence this anadromy-residency trade- off (metcalfe 1998; morinville & rasmussen 2003; mcmillan et al. 2011). for instance, individuals with faster growth and higher lipid levels may be more likely to adopt resident maturation (sloat & reeves 2014). environmental conditions controlling fish growth change spatially within catchments (wright correspondence: i. a. tattam, oregon department of fish and wildlife, 203 badgley, eou, one university boulevard, la grande, or 97850, usa. e-mail: ian.a. tattam@state.or.us 434 doi: 10.1111/eff.12287 2000; reeves et al. 2011; mcmillan et al. 2013), potentially creating reach- and season-specific growth responses by juvenile salmonids. therefore, interac- tions between reach-scale growth and inter-reach movement may contribute to shaping the life history of individual o. mykiss. given the importance of freshwater growth rate to fish life history (juanes et al. 2000; cucherousset et al. 2005) and subsequent survival (juanes et al. 2000; letcher et al. 2002), growth is often monitored as an indicator of habitat quality. however, the mobility of stream fish (gowan & fausch 1996; armstrong et al. 1997) can make growth rate moni- toring challenging. individual marking and detection techniques, such as passive integrated transponder (pit) tags, have increased our knowledge of growth patterns and movement (juanes et al. 2000; kahler et al. 2001; bacon et al. 2005). historically, many individual-based studies focused on growth or sur- vival patterns in short spatial and temporal (often dur- ing summer) periods (juanes et al. 2000; letcher et al. 2002; bacon et al. 2005). however, under- standing growth and movement, and the resulting implications for life history patterns at the stream scale across multiple seasons better reflects watershed management needs (fausch et al. 2002). managers need to know the appropriate scale to implement cost-effective conservation and restoration actions, whereas researchers need to know the appropriate spatial scale to monitor the effectiveness of these actions. factors limiting fish growth and abundance may change among seasons. as a result, research is increasingly accounting for larger spatial and tempo- ral grains (ebersole et al. 2006, 2009; reeves et al. 2011; roni et al. 2012). for instance, temperatures in portions of desert streams may limit both salmonid growth and spatial distribution during summer (li et al. 1994; feldhaus et al. 2010), but not winter. in response to high summer stream temperatures, salmo- nids may behaviourally thermoregulate or migrate to find more optimal thermal and growth habitat (eber- sole et al. 2003), potentially causing reach-specific changes in density, growth and survival among sea- sons (ebersole et al. 2006). the goal of our study was to evaluate spatio-tem- poral variation in growth during all four seasons, as this is a key driver of life history patterns and popula- tion productivity. to accomplish this, we studied growth and movement of individually marked o. mykiss in murderers creek, a tributary of the south fork john day river, oregon. we theorised that: (i) individual growth rates would vary among reaches and seasons, and (ii) individual o. mykiss would actively migrate seasonally among multiple reaches to maximise growth rate. the specific seasonal changes in growth patterns research hypotheses that we tested were as follows: density of o. mykiss would not differ among seasons and reaches (h1); growth rate of individually tagged o. mykiss would not differ among seasons and reaches (h2); and o. mykiss from reach 1 (the warm- est reach monitored) would immigrate into or through reach 2 (where stream temperatures were cooler) dur- ing summer (h3). methods study location description the south fork john day river basin (sfjd) sup- ports native, naturally reproducing summer-run steel- head (anadromous) and rainbow trout (resident). most of the o. mykiss in the sfjd are <200 mm fork length (fl), and although the population we sampled is composed of both mature resident and immature anadromous individuals (mcmillan et al. 2011), none were externally identifiable as being either resident (trout) or anadromous (juvenile summer steelhead). thus, we use o. mykiss to describe all individuals captured and tagged. o. mykiss are distributed throughout the sfjd, including four principal tribu- taries downstream of izee falls (fig. 1), which is a barrier to upstream migration by all o. mykiss. adult steelhead and resident rainbow trout spawn march– june. anadromous o. mykiss emigrate from the sfjd during october to may and migrate through the columbia river to the pacific ocean during april–june (tattam et al. 2013). we selected mur- derers creek as a location of intensive study from december 2004 to february 2006 (fig. 1). murderers creek is a fourth-order stream basin that encompasses 14,632 ha in northeast oregon (fig. 1) and ranges in elevation from 914 to 2133 m. our sampling frame for murderers creek included its lowermost 18 km (fig. 1). within this section, we identified three distinct geomorphic reaches (frissell et al. 1986). these reaches, previously described by weber et al. (2014), have similar channel widths, but differing gradients. we randomly selected a monitor- ing site within each of the three stream reaches. fol- lowing the nomenclature of weber et al. (2014), sites were labelled ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘three’ in ascending order proceeding upstream from the sfjd (fig. 1). sites encompassed at least five pools, ranged in thal- weg length from 99 to 391 m and were sampled five times between december 2004 and february 2006 to encompass four intervals that approximated each sea- son. murderers creek discharge (recorded by an oregon water resources department pressure gauge 0.3 km upstream from the sfjd) varied by more than two orders of magnitude during our study period. 435 tattam et al. d j f s 1 2 3 murderers creek minimum discharge (0.07 m3s  1) occurred on 28 august 2005 and maximum discharge (9.14 m3s  1) occurred on 31 december 2005. stream temperatures were recorded continuously (i-button thermochron and onset optic stowaway temperature loggers) with temperature loggers in reach two for the duration of the study period, and in reaches 1 and 3 from june 2005 to january 2006 (fig. 1). we used one-way analysis of variance (anova) and multiple compar- isons (using a bonferroni adjustment to minimise type 1 error rate) to evaluate differences in mean daily stream temperature among reaches during sum- mer and fall. fish capture, tagging and density estimation we used three different fish capture techniques to minimise the effect of capture-induced bias in the size of fish pit tagged. when stream temperatures were >8 °c, we captured o. mykiss using either a snorkeler or a backpack electrofisher (smith-root 12- b, vancouver, wa) to ‘herd’ fish from pools down- stream into a bag seine (3.7∙1.2 m, with 6.4 mm mesh). this method was also used in riffles >40 cm deep, whereas in riffles <40 cm deep we elec- trofished stream fish. when dipnetted and fig. 1. map of the south fork john day river (sfjd) and murderers creek. dashed arrow denotes stream flow direction. inset shows the location of the sfjd (grey shaded area) within the state of oregon and the united states. coloured stream areas denote three reaches, and numbered arrows mark the sampling site within each reach of murderers creek. stream temperature loggers were operated at each sampling site. we and temperatures were <8 °c, we night snorkelled with a dive light (c-8 uk sunlight, with led bulb) and captured o. mykiss with a handheld dipnet. captured pit-tagged (12∙2 mm, 134.2 khz;

(2013). the count of mobile fish capture events used to detect summer fish movement among reaches were described in detail by tattam et al. (2013). in short, capture effort seasonal changes in growth patterns was equally distributed among each reach in murder- ers creek on a weekly basis from june to september. the starting channel unit for each day’s capture effort was randomly assigned without replacement (each starting channel unit was drawn from a contiguous habitat inventory of all channel units in each reach), to sample the maximum possible linear extent. linear stream distance sampled each day ranged from approximately 80 to 200 m. over 1500 o. mykiss were captured throughout murderers creek (tattam et al. 2013; table 1), interrogated for pit tag pres- ence (and tagged if not a recapture), and their loca- tion recorded at the channel unit scale. we organised capture–recapture data into a 3 9 3 matrix compar- ing the reach of recapture during summer 2005 (for each capture occasion if fish were recaptured more than once) with the most reach of capture. recent prior results varied among significantly seasonal mean daily mean temperatures in murderers creek reaches (f2,225 = 51.3, p < 0.0001; fig. 2) with a longitudi- nal cline during summer. summer daily mean tem- perature higher (p < 0.0001) than reach 2. summer daily mean tem- perature lower (p < 0.0001) than both reaches 1 and 2. daily mean stream temperatures during fall were not statistically (f2,294 = 0.1, p = 0.88) among reaches different (fig. 2). significantly significantly 3 was 1 was in in reach reach from december 2004 to february 2006, we pit- tagged 483 o. mykiss at three sites on murderers creek (table 1). we captured 100 o. mykiss at both the beginning and end of a single season and used these individuals to estimate seasonal growth. there was evidence of a difference in o. mykiss density among reaches (f2,6 = 4.98, p = 0.05). comparison of 95% confidence intervals (fig. 3) suggests there were no significant differences in mean density of o. mykiss among reaches in june 2005. during september 2005, reach 1 had a significantly lower density than reach 2, and reach 2 in turn had a signif- icantly lower density compared to reach 3 (fig. 3). during january 2006, there was no significant differ- ence in density between reach 1 and reach 2. con- versely, 3 was significantly higher than density in either reach 1 or reach 2 (fig. 3). estimated density reach in relative growth rate (fig. 4) had significant sea- sonal (f3,88 = 62.6, p < 0.0001) variation with a sig- nificant first-order interaction between season and reach (f6,88 = 4.5, p < 0.001). winter growth rates (f2,88 = 3.0, varied significantly among reaches p = 0.05, fig. 4) with suggestive evidence of a 437 tattam et al. c d e b f f f reach 1 reach 2 reach 3 a winter spring summer fall mean maximum minimum (a) 20 ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t n a e m l a n o s a e s 15 10 5 0 (b) 25 ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t y l i a d 20 15 10 5 0 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec jan fig. 2. seasonal means of daily mean stream temperatures at sampling sites on murderers creek (panel a). error bars are 95% confidence intervals. letters commonly shared among bars indi- cate sites that were not significantly different (p > 0.05). daily stream temperature in reach 2 of murderers creek from 1 january to 31 december 2005 is presented in panel b. m r e p s s i k y m . o 6 2 1 0 reach 1 reach 2 reach 3 june september january fig. 3. estimated linear density of oncorhynchus_mykiss at three sampling sites in murderers creek during june 2005, september 2005 and january 2006. error bars are 95% confidence intervals. difference between reaches 1 and 3 (t = 1.9, d.f. = 88, p = 0.06), and significant evidence that growth rate in reach 3 was lower than reach 2 (t = 2.3, d.f. = 88, p = 0.02). spring growth rates were significantly higher than any other season 438 ) 0 0 1 · 1 – d · m m m m · ( e t a r h t w o r g e v i t a l e r 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 c c c reach 1 reach 2 reach 3 a,d a b e d,e a a a,b a,b winter spring summer fall fig. 4. seasonal pattern in relative growth rates of 100 pit- tagged oncorhynchus_mykiss in murderers creek from december 2004 through january 2006. error bars are 95% confidence inter- vals. letters commonly shared among bars indicate reach-season combinations that were not significantly different (p > 0.05).

(2006) sampled at a similar spatial scale and also observed high growth rates shift among reaches across different seasons. in their study, an intermittent stream with medium-sized juve- nile coho salmon oncorhynchus_kisutch at the end of summer became the reach of highest growth during winter. these studies in tandem indicate that reaches of lower summer productivity (moore creek in the study by ebersole et al. 2006, and reach 1 of murder- ers creek in our study) should be evaluated over the course of an entire year to accurately depict their importance to salmonid production. in addition to among-site and among-season varia- tion, relative growth rate also varied among individu- als within each site and season. although our recapture sample size was low during some seasons, we were still able to document a broad range of individual growth rates. for instance, we observed individual growth rates during summer in reach 1 the mean) which ranged from 0.00 (0% of to 0.17 mmday  1 (189% of the mean). this was simi- lar to the variation observed by juanes et al. (2000), but differed from bacon et al. (2005), who observed little individual variation in growth rates of atlantic salmon parr. different spatial scales of sampling, rather than recapture sample size, likely contributed to these contrasting results. bacon et al. (2005) sam- pled solely within a 140 m stream section; con- versely, juanes et al. (2000) sampled a 1 km section of stream. in comparison, we sampled 853 m dis- tributed across 18 km. these studies in combination indicate that, to encompass individual growth vari- ability and accurately measure production at a stream scale, individual monitoring should be nested within seasonal monitoring of different stream reaches. oncorhynchus_mykiss in murderers creek achieved the majority of their annual fl growth during spring. this occurred at mean temperatures (9.0 °c in reach 2) below the reported optimal growth temperature (15–19 °c; richter & kolmes 2005). bacon et al. (2005) and juanes et al. (2000) both observed a simi- lar discrepancy, with the fastest annual growth of atlantic salmon parr occurring during spring in colder than ‘optimal’ temperatures. positive change in photoperiod during spring likely contributed to the highest growth rates of the year through neuroen- docrine stimulation (higgins 1985; saunders & har- mon 1990). our results corroborate the theory that change in photoperiod has a larger influence on growth than temperature (higgins 1985). however, it is also important to consider seasonal changes in optimal growth temperature. for instance, averett (1969) found that optimal growth temperatures for coho salmon were lower during winter and spring 439 tattam et al. than summer. optimal spring growth temperatures for coho were one-third of optimal summer tempera- ture (averett 1969). although spring temperatures in murderers creek were below 15 °c (the optimum range presented by richter & kolmes 2005), they met or exceeded 5 °c on most spring days (fig. 2). macroinvertebrate drift biomass, which was an important component of summer fish growth in this stream (weber et al. 2014), likely mediated the rela- tionship between stream temperature and fish growth during spring as well. monitoring changes in stream temperatures, food availability and the associated physiological response of salmonids (e.g. feldhaus et al. 2010; weber et al. 2014) has been focused on summer periods. however, given the importance of spring to the overall growth of the o. mykiss we studied, understanding how future changes in spring stream temperature affect fish growth should also be a component of salmonid monitoring. annual patterns in growth rate were not driven solely by temperature, which is consistent with prior studies (nicola & almodovar 2004; larsson et al. 2005). winter growth rates differed among reaches during a season when stream temperatures are typi- cally homogenous. during summer, there was a signif- icant difference in temperature between reaches 2 and 3, but no difference in growth rate. density of benthic and drift macroinvertebrates was higher in reaches 1 and 2 compared to reach 3 during summer 2006 (weber et al. 2014). we theorise that increased prey availability in reach 2 was sufficient to offset tempera- ture-driven metabolic increases (hughes & grand 2000). expanding the prey availability monitoring conducted by weber et al. (2014) to the winter and spring seasons would improve our understanding of the mechanisms influencing the temperature–growth relationship in these seasons where growth varied among reaches and then reached its annual maximum respectively. irrespective of mechanism, the reach- scale differences in growth we observed were super- imposed on a photoperiod-correlated annual pattern, yet remained substantial enough to potentially alter life history trajectories (mcmillan et al. 2011). et al. 2001). although we the paucity of summer movement we found is in contrast to some observations of high movement rates for stream salmonids (gowan & fausch 1996, 2002; kahler technically accepted h3, as we were able to document summer migration by a few individual o. mykiss from reach 1 into reach 2, two independent methods indicated that >95% of o. mykiss in murderers creek remained in their tagging during summer. for o. mykiss in reach 1, this meant that they remained in reach 1 despite peak temperatures (27 °c) exceed- ing reported thresholds where growth ceases (richter & kolmes 2005). although nearby populations of reach of 440 o. mykiss have adaptive tolerance of high water tem- peratures (gamperl et al. 2002; rodnick et al. 2004), an upstream migration of 6 km would have decreased ambient temperature and in turn increased growth (presuming no density-dependent reduction in growth rates). perhaps stream temperatures near the upper incipient lethal temperature (richter & kolmes 2005) are necessary to stimulate upstream migration of a substantial portion of the population. future testing of this hypothesis would assist management, as a temperature trigger for upstream migration could be matched with discharge on a stream-specific basis to ensure that man-made fish passage structures (e.g. fish ladders at irrigation diversion dams and culverts at road crossings) effectively pass fish upstream dur- ing critical periods. however, factors in addition to stream temperature appear to influence movement. for example, the distribution of juvenile salmonids in experimental stream channels with cover habitat under-matched food abundance (giannico & healey 1999) indicating that food was not the sole driver of fish distribution. rather fish distribution can be medi- ated by cover habitat availability and not respond lin- early to food abundance (giannico 2000). research in murderers creek similarly suggests that response to high summer stream temperatures was mediated by a combination of increased prey abundance in warmer reaches (weber et al. 2014), higher winter growth rates in warmer reaches (fig. 4) and lower summer density in warmer reaches (fig. 3). management implications sampling only during summer would have provided an inaccurate assessment of the spatial distribution of fish growth in murderers creek. low summer growth rates in reach 1, if considered in isolation, implied that this is an unproductive reach that o. mykiss would emigrate from during summer. however, in contrast to our hypothesised upstream migration, most tagged o. mykiss remained in reach 1 of mur- derers creek during summer despite experiencing lower growth and higher temperatures relative to upstream reaches. our growth rate monitoring during prior seasons revealed that o. mykiss in reach 1 had experienced to upstream areas (reach 3) which provided a ‘jump start’ on annual growth. at the beginning of summer, newly tagged individuals were, on average, 3 mm longer in reach 1 than reach 2, and 21 mm longer in reach 1 than reach 3. salmonids monitor and allocate their lipid levels (bull et al. 1996) depending on whether they are on a trajectory to smolt the follow- ing spring (metcalfe et al. 1988). thus, as a result of beginning summer at a larger size, o. mykiss in reach 1 may have projected that their size or energy levels higher winter relative growth were sufficient to stay on a desired growth trajectory, obviating the need for resource tracking at the reach scale. in sum, we demonstrated that localised differences in the environment affected growth within a stream, and these differences were sparsely tracked by indi- vidual fish at the reach scale during summer. while longitudinal changes in the riverscape (fausch et al. 2002) certainly influence phenotypic expression (e.g. residency in cool headwater streams vs. anadromy in warmer high-order streams, mcmillan et al. 2011), our results also indicate the existence of a temporal component to the riverscape. fish size distributions observed within a reach during a single season are influenced by growth during prior seasons. further- more, phenotypic expression in partially migratory species like o. mykiss is influenced by growth during key seasonal (silverstein et al. 1998; mcmillan et al. 2011). monitoring growth at a longer time scale (e.g. annual rather than seasonal estimates of growth rate) would average across these key growth windows and miss important biological data. monitoring growth and movement during as many seasons as possible is hence important for accurately characterising the biota present along the riverscape and advancing our knowledge of partial migration. ‘windows’ acknowledgements we thank s. white, f. madri~nan, j. feldhaus, p. bayley, s. heppell, j. davis, b. kingsley, v. mueller, j. togstad, j.
