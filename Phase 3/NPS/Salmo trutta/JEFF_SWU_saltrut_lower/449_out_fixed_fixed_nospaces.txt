conducted a laboratory study using metalarval australian smelt (retropinna semoni) collected from the murray river, to examine daily increment deposition and the effects of different temperatures and feeding regimes on otolith growth. daily increment deposition was conﬁrmed by comparing the number of increments from an oxytetracycline mark with the known number of days from marking. after holding ﬁsh at two temperature levels and three feeding rates, both food density and temperature were found to have a signiﬁcant effect on otolith growth, with food density having the greatest inﬂuence. overall trends in ﬁnal lengths and condition of ﬁsh were well represented by recent otolith growth. the results of the experiment have implications for estimating growth histories and its relationship to various environmental conditions. z. tonkin1, a. j. king1, a. robertson2 1department of sustainability and environment, arthur rylah institute for environmental research, heidelberg, vic.,

gov.au accepted for publication october 15, 2007 introduction (1999) the coupling of high ﬂows and warm water temper- atures has been suggested to provide the optimal conditions for ﬁsh recruitment in ﬂoodplain rivers (junk et al. 1989; bayley 1991; gutreuter et al. 1999; king et al. 2003). however, in reviewing information on ﬁsh recruitment in australian systems, humphries et al. found little empirical evidence that inundation of the ﬂoodplain enhances survival of larval and juvenile ﬁsh, like as had been proposed (e.g. lake 1967; harris & gehrke 1994), and put forward a complimentary hypothesis suggesting that low sum- mer ﬂows may also provide optimal conditions for recruitment. to investigate patterns of ﬁsh recruitment in these systems we need to understand the survival and growth responses of larval and juvenile ﬁsh to different environmental conditions. otolith micro- structure analysis of larval and juvenile ﬁsh has been widely used as a tool to obtain valuable ecological information such as age–growth curves, hatch dates and life history events (e.g. sogard 1991; sepu´ lveda 1994; fey 2001). it has also provided researchers with a tool for measuring growth histories during early life stages (e.g. thorrold & williams 1989; secor & dean 1992), as well as allowing exploration of the role that environmental factors have on growth and survival (jones & brothers 1987). the reconstruction of early growth from otolith microstructure analysis relies on two assumptions: daily periodicity of increment formation and a strong otolith size – ﬁsh size relationship (baumann et al. 2005). despite both being met for most species, there are some examples of nondaily increment formation (e.g. szedlmayer 1998) and uncoupling of somatic and otolith growth (e.g. wright et al. 1990; barber & jenkins 2001; baumann et al. 2005). this implies the need to gain species-speciﬁc knowledge of deposition rates and inﬂuences on somatic growth and how this is reﬂected in otolith growth to interpret growth histories 312 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00283.x and their responses to environmental factors in the wild. as highlighted in the flood pulse concept (junk et al. 1989), as well as in marine literature, the key exogenous factors governing growth in the early life history of ﬁshes are temperature and food supply (fuiman & higgs 1997). which of the two has a greater inﬂuence and how this is reﬂected in the otolith appears however to be species and stage speciﬁc (jones 1992). australian smelt (retropinna semoni weber) are a small, pelagic, short-lived freshwater ﬁsh, endemic to south-eastern australia (mcdowall 1996). we have proposed that they are an ideal indicator species to reconstruct growth responses to different ﬂow and temperature conditions because of their abundance; rapid growth rates; protracted spawning season from early spring to summer (humphries et al. 2002), and their strong relationship between ﬁsh size and otolith size (tonkin, unpublished data). the present study examined the increment deposition rate and the effects of different temperature and feeding regimes on otolith growth of australian smelt. methods fish collection and marking otolith growth of retropinna semoni experiment 2: variability of otolith growth with differing food and temperature levels the time of ﬁsh allocation, all a total of 180 of the marked ﬁsh were randomly allocated at a rate of 10 ﬁsh per tank into 2 l tanks, with each tank connected to a continuous ﬂow through system. at tanks contained static water at approximately 18 °c, after which, the ﬂow through system was activated so that after approximately 6 h, half of the experimental tanks received water at a ‘low’ temperature (set at 12 °c), whilst the others received water at a ‘high’ temperature (set at 20 °c). the two temperature values were selected as they approximated the minimum and maximum water temperatures experienced by wild larval smelt in south-east australia (humphries et al. 2002). data loggers recorded actual water tempera- tures hourly for the two treatments, with an average value calculated for each at the end of the trial. approximately 24 h after ﬁsh were distributed amongst tanks (and temperature levels), each tank were assigned to one of three designated feeding regimes: 1 high feed: 20 ml of cultured brine shrimp nauplii solution fed every day; 2 low feed: 10 ml of cultured brine shrimp nauplii solution fed every second day; approximately 250 metalarval australian smelt (15– 20 mm ls, standard length) were collected from (36°04¢765¢¢s, the mid-murray river, australia 144°57¢553¢¢e), on the 25th november 2005 using quatrefoil light traps to minimise damage associated with other active methods of capture (e.g. seine netting). fish were transported back to aquarium facilities in 30 l aerated containers. the following )1 day, oxytetracycline (otc) hydrochloride solution (buf- )1 na2co3) for 24 h to mark

measurements of individual lengths and weights prior to the onset of the experiments were not possible. immersed in a 500 mgæl all ﬁsh were experiment 1: validation of daily otolith ring deposition seventy of the marked ﬁsh were placed in a 300 l aerated tank located outdoors under cover, where they were exposed to ambient light and temperature (approximate air temperature: 11–30 °c) cycles for 35 days. fish were monitored and fed once a day to satiation with live brine shrimp nauplii (artemia spp.) and water was topped up and renewed as required. every 5 days, ﬁve ﬁshes were killed and preserved (95% ethanol) for later analysis. 3 starved: not fed. each tank was therefore exposed to one of either six combinations of various feeding and temperature regimes: low temperature (12 °c):

mortalities or distressed ﬁsh (which were immediately removed, killed and preserved). the experiment was continued for 25 days, after which time all remaining ﬁsh were killed and preserved in 95% ethanol. nauplii 10 mæl otolith preparation and analysis all preserved ﬁsh from both the validation and feeding experiments were measured for ls (nearest 0.1 mm) and mass (nearest 0.001 g), with a measurement of general condition taken as the mass ⁄ ls. the right sagittal otoliths were removed with the aid of a stereo 313 tonkin et al. microscope and mounted proximal face down in thermoplastic cement. otoliths were then polished to the level of the primordium across the sagittal plain using 3 lm lapping ﬁlm and 0.5 lm alumina slurry. using a compound microscope equipped with a uv light source (400–1000· magniﬁcation), otoliths were viewed to identify the otc marks. a photograph of each otolith was taken under both uv light and normal transmitted light for future reference to the position of the mark for later image analysis. all otolith measurements were made using the image analysis system imagepro express (version 5.0.1.26, media cybernetics inc.). to verify daily increments (experiment 1) compar- isons between the number of increments on the outside of the otc marks (fig. 1) and the number of days elapsed since marking were made. otoliths from 18 individual ﬁshes, three ﬁshes randomly selected from six known time points, were examined. prior to increment counts, total otolith growth was measured as the distance from the outer edge of the otc mark to the outer edge at the widest radius on the dorsal section of the otolith. the number of increments from the otc mark to the edge of the otolith was counted three times each by two readers, after which the mean ring count for each reader was determined. if the two mean counts differed by no more than ±3 increments, the two counts were accepted and averaged (e.g. sweatman & kohler 1991). only one otolith was discarded because of reader disagreement. a linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between the mean increment counts outside the otc mark and the number of days after marking. an assessment of the slope and upper and lower conﬁ- dence intervals of the regression was used to test whether it was signiﬁcantly different to one (which assumes that increments were formed daily). for experiment 2, ﬁve ﬁshes were randomly selected from each tank (total of 15 ﬁshes for each treatment) were analysed for total otolith growth in the same manner as for experiment 1 (the distance from the outer edge of the otc mark to the outer edge at the widest radius on the dorsal section of the otolith). otolith growth was measured over the entire 25 days period for all treatments other than the high temper- (a) (b) ature ⁄ starved treatment. fish from this treatment were analysed at a range of time periods <25 days, as none survived the entire experimental period. therefore, all otolith growth during this experiment was divided by the number of days postmarking. a two-way anova was carried out with temperature and food regime as factors and otolith growth, ﬁnal ls and condition as dependant variables. signiﬁcant effects were analysed with post hoc comparisons using the tukey hsd test. all analyses were per- formed using the package genstat for windows 6.1tm, hertfordshire, uk. results experiment 1: validation of daily otolith ring deposition when examined under uv light, the otoliths from all ﬁsh showed a distinct ﬂuorescent mark (fig. 1). )1. otoliths grew by an average of 2.36 ± 0.02 lmæday using increment counts from the 17 ﬁshes analysed, the regression between the number of increments outside the otc mark and the number of days after marking was expressed as a linear relationship (r2 = 0.993, p < 0.001; fig. 2). the lower and upper 95% conﬁdence levels (0.931–1.019) of the slope (x = 0.975) indicated it was not signiﬁcantly different to one, conﬁrming that increments were deposited on a daily basis. 40 30 20 10 t n u o c t n e m e r c n i y = 0.9751x– 0.0791  r2 = 0.9932 0 0 5 10 20 25 15 days postmarking 30 35 40 fig. 2. linear regression of mean

otolith growth with differing food and temperature levels during the 25-day period ﬁshes in the high temper- ature treatment were subjected to a mean temperature of 18.45 ± 0.03 °c, whilst those in the low temper- ature treatment were subjected to 13.03 ± 0.01 °c. both food density and temperature had a signiﬁcant effect on otolith growth, with the interaction between the two also signiﬁcant (table 1). the magnitude of effects indicated that the largest proportion of variation in otolith growth was explained by food level (63%) and not by the temperature (12%) or by the interaction between the two (10%). post hoc comparisons of food levels showed that for both temperature levels, ﬁsh from the high feed treatment had signiﬁcantly greater otolith growth than the two other treatments, while ﬁsh from the low feed treatment had signiﬁcantly greater otolith growth than those that were starved (p < 0.001 respectively; fig. 3a). food density also had a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnal ls and the condition (measured as mass ⁄ ls) of ﬁsh in the experiment; however, unlike otolith growth, temperature and the interaction between the two did not (table 1). the ls and condition of ﬁsh at the end of the experiment was signiﬁcantly greater in high feed treatments than low and starved, whilst low feed was greater than starved (all p < 0.001, fig. 3b and c). discussion the results of this study demonstrate that the incre- ment formation rate on sagittal otoliths of larval and juvenile australian smelt occurs on a daily basis, as previously demonstrated for the closely related new zealand smelt (ward & boube´e 1996). this deposition rate was achieved under experimental conditions that attempted to mimic those experienced by wild larvae of the species (retropinna

(2003) explained found that water temperature 315 tonkin et al. approximately 30% of variation in otolith growth compared with 3.5% for food abundance. reasons for such differences between our study and these other similar studies are unclear, particularly given the difﬁculties of making such comparisons across species and environmental conditions. whilst speculative, it may simply be the differences between marine species and a temperate freshwater species, with the latter subjected to much larger seasonal scale changes in temperature. alternatively, given that otolith growth )1, and under the highest food ration was <2 lmæday wild specimens at similar developmental stages have )1 (tonkin, unpublished been recorded up to 5 lmæday data), patterns documented in the study may be a simple reﬂection of poorer growing conditions in the aquaria of the experiment in comparison with the natural environment. however, it must be noted that the food rations provided in this study were consistent with those available under natural conditions (king 2004). with overall changes in ls or condition not directly measured, clear conclusions of treatment effects on somatic growth cannot be made, however, ﬁnal ls and condition did give some indication of such trends. additionally, it is likely that ﬁsh in starved treatments underwent zero or negative somatic growth (as demonstrated by barber & jenkins 2001; fey 2001), yet otolith growth continued during these times. this suggests that otolith growth is governed by processes that are somewhat uncoupled by somatic growth processes. other studies have also demonstrated otolith growth continues during times of zero or negative somatic growth (e.g. barkman & bengtson 1987; mosegaard et al. 1988; barber & jenkins 2001). these studies have suggested that processes related to metabolic rate rather than somatic growth largely governed otolith growth. such metabolic-driven pro- cesses may explain why temperature had a signiﬁcant effect on otolith growth (although minor) but not on ﬁnal ls or condition. an increased metabolic rate incurred at higher temperatures is also a likely cause of the interaction effect between temperature and food on otolith growth in the present study, where the highest growth was observed in the high temperature ⁄ high food treatment. leach & houde (1999) also found that a combination of high temperature and high prey levels led to the highest growth rates. a higher metabolic rate may also explain why no larvae from the starved ⁄ high temperature treatment survived the full length of the trial, when compared with the starved ⁄ low temperature treatment which had a >50% survival. results in experiment 2 were a reﬂection of a single 25-day period of growth. massou et al. (2002) found that for larval and juvenile nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus), regardless of initial condition, the daily 316 increment widths started to decrease after the ﬁrst 1 or 2 days of restricted feeding. molony & choat (1990) however, found that a signiﬁcant decline in increment widths in starved ﬁsh was detectable only after 15 days, suggesting that this gradual decline in increment width reﬂects the exhaustion of readily mobilised energy reserves. these studies have illus- trated that otolith response times can be affected by factors such as ﬁsh size (molony & choat 1990) and past growing conditions (baumann et al. 2005). further investigations into the rate at which somatic growth responds to changes in environmental condi- tions, and how such responses are then reﬂected in australian smelt otoliths are required prior to any reliable interpretation of their otoliths from wild specimens. this species. the results of the conﬁrmation of daily increment deposition and reﬂection of trends in ls and condition in otolith growth documented in the present study have provided information into otolith microstructure important interpretation for the experiment have implications for estimating age and growth histories for the species and its relationship to various environmental conditions. this could prove valuable in investigating ﬁsh recruitment and produc- tion in australian lowland rivers and, with limited information on freshwater species, demonstrate the factors required for reliable interpretation of otolith growth histories and environmental conditions in freshwater studies. acknowledgements we thank john morrongiello for ﬁeld and lab assistance; john mahoney, justin o’mahoney and damien o’mahoney for help with aquarium
