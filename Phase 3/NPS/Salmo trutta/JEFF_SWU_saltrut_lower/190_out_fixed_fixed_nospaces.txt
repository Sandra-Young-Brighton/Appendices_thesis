(1993) sug- gested that this may be due to one of three fac- tors: i) the lack of sufficient colonists with the genetic capacity for developing these life-history patterns, 2) the lack of suitable habitat for devel- opment of a river-type or sea-type life-history pattern, or 3) the overlooked presence of small river-/sea-type stocks in southern rivers. studies of allozyme variability in sockeye salmon populations in the u.s. pacific northwest (utter et al. 1984; winans et al. 1996), british col- umbia (wood et al. 1994), alaska (wilmot & burger 1985; guthrie et al. 1994), and the kamch- atka peninsula of russia (varnavskaya et al. 1994) have revealed a pattern of population genetic dif- ferentiation in lake-type sockeye salmon that re- sembles a mosaic, where nearest geographic neigh- bors are not necessarily similar genetically. in con- trast, using similar methods of allozyme frequency distribution, wood et al. (1987a, b, 1994) were un- able to differentiate between a number of spawning populations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon sep- arated by as much as 180 km in the stikine river basin in british columbia, canada. more surpris- ingly, wood (19953, using allozyme frequency data reported in guthrie et al. (19941, showed that allo- zyme frequencies did not differ significantly be- tween populations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in the stikine and taku rivers, british col- umbia, although these river basins are separated by a minimum of 220 km. in response to a petition seeking protection for one population of sockeye salmon in washington state under the united states endangered species act, the national marine fisheries service (nmfs) completed a status review of sockeye salmon from the states of washington and oregon (gustafson et al. 1997). this article presents new information gathered during this status review process on the distribution of river-/sea-type sock- eye salmon on the west coast of north america, including previously unpublished observations of putative river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in wash- ington state, usa, and examines available allo- zyme information from north american stocks of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon. we then compare the genetic population structure of these stocks with selected lake-type sockeye salmon popula- tions in the same geographic region. 182 methods distribution records of riverhea- type sockeye salmon were obtained from published literature sources and from unpublished spawning ground survey records of the washington department of fish and wildlife (wdfw). we evaluated allozyme data from literature sources (guthrie et al. 1994; wood et al. 1994; winans et al. 1996; waples et al. 1997) and from nmfs unpublished data for 12 north american stocks that were clearly sea-type, river-type or a mixture of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon, and for a representative sampling of 26 lake-type sockeye salmon populations for which sufficient allele fre- quency data were available (table 1, fig. 1). in later discussions in this article, populations with some combination of river- and/or sea-type life his- tories are generally referred to as river-/sea-type populations. for those samples where allele fre- quency data were obtained from the literature (guthrie et al. 1994; wood et al. 1994; winans et al. 1996; waples et al. 1997), collection methods were provided in the original papers. six samples of adult sockeye salmon were obtained by wdfw biologists in 1996 on the spawning grounds in washington state (see table 1). the fisheries man- agement department of the makah tribe provided adult sockeye salmon samples from allen's bay in ozette lake, washington. the quinault fisheries division of the quinault indian nation provided samples of juvenile sockeye salmon collected as smolt using fyke nets in the quinault river (see table 1). we estimated within-population variability at 9 allozyme loci (sah*, ada-i *, a l a p , midhp-i *, ldh-c*, mpi*, pepco, pgm-i * and pgm-2") with standard statistics, mean number of alleles per locus, percent polymorphic loci, and average heterozygosity per locus using biosys- 1 (swof- ford & selander 1981). because only allele fre- quency data were available from the literature for most other populations, we calculated average heterozygosity based on hardy-weinberg expec- tations. a null allele for pgm-i* in sockeye salmon (utter et al. 1984) results in two pheno- types, a band of activity and no activity, being ex- pressed. we used observed homozygote frequencies for our analyses for this locus rather than calculat- ing the frequency of the common allele as 1 minus the square root of the frequency of the null homo- zygous phenotype (utter et al. 19841, because this method results in variance estimates more similar to those for other loci (see winans et al. 1996; waples et al. 1997). phenotypic frequencies for this locus from wood et al. (1994) and guthrie et al. (1994) were recalculated to yield the observed table 1. collection information and source of allozyme data for 38 anadromous sockeye salmon populations from the u s . pacific northwest, british columbia, and southeast alaska. l=lake-type, r/s=river-/sea-lype. sample number and collection location river basin collection date life history type sample sizea source of datab allozyme variability of river-/sea-type sockeye 1 redfish lake (outmigrants) 2 lake wenatchee (juveniles) 3 lake osoyoos (wells dam) 4 lake pleasantc 5 ozette lake (allen's bay)c 6 quinault lake (outmigrants)c 7 cedar riverc 8 big bear creekc 9 baker lake 10 sakinaw lake 11 babine lake (pierre creek) 12 lower shuswap river 13 klukshu lake 14 little tatsamenie lake 15 little trapper lake 16 tahltan lake 17 meziadin lake (tintina creek) 18 fred wright lake (bonney creek) 19 damdochax lake 20 great central lake 21 kennedy lake 22 cheewhat lake 23 weaver channel 24 chilko lake 25 quesnel lake (horsefly river) 26 shuswap lake (adams river) 27 nooksack rivep. 28 sauk riverc 29 upper skagit riverc 30 hackett river 31 verrett river 32 scud river 33 gingut creek 34 shustahini creek 35 tuskwa slough 36 yonakina slough 37 chilkat river 38 east alsek river columbia columbia columbia quit la yule ozette quinault l. washington l. washington skagit sakinaw skeena f raser alsek taku taku stikine nass nass nass vancouver is. vancouver is. vancouver is. fraser fraser fraser fraser nooksack skagit skagit taku stikine stikine nass taku taku taku chilkat east alsek 1991 1988 1990 1996 1995 1995 1994 1994 1991 1988 1990 1990 1992 1990 1990 1986 1986 1984 1992 1992 1990 1996 1996 1996 1985, 87 1983, 84, 85, 86, 89 1984 ,85, 87 1987, 88 1986 1986, 87 1989 1983 1987 1982,a3,85, 87 1984, 86, 87 1984, 86, 87, 89 1983,90 1985, 93 l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l r/s r/s r/s r/s r/s r/s ris r/s r/s r/s r/s r/s 138 120 63 100 33 93 80 80 80 82-83 60 60 75-76 67 100 74-397 95-100 90-279 195-298 100-243 89-91 79-1 00 100 99 94-1 00 100 26 15 25 57-91 21 6-691 83-21 1 93-1 68 97 40 18 100 50 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 4 2 2 4 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 a sample size varies for some populations since not all samples in wood et al.

(1994) and *i66 as reported in wood et al. (1994). the locus, referred to as ada-2* in wood et al. (1994), was equivalent to our ada-i*. likewise, we treated the allele pgm-2*135 in wood et al. (1994) as equiva- lent to our pgm-2*-77. between-population variability was estimated for the same 9 loci with the unbiased genetic dis- tance statistic of nei (1978). these values were used together with the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (upgma) to generate a dendrogram (sneath & sokal 1973) and a multidimensional scaling (mds) plot using ntsys-pc (rohlf 1994) to depict genetic relation- ships among populations. pair-wise geographic distances between popula- tions were calculated by hand from detailed maps by measuring total aquatic kilometers between spawning sites. 183 gustafson & winans fig. 1. collection locations for lake-type and river-/sea-type sockeye salmon allozyme samples in the us. pacific northwest, british columbia, and southeast alaska. sample numbers and collection locations correspond with those listed in table 1. results distribution of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon known self-sustaining populations of river-/sea- type sockeye salmon from british columbia and southeast alaska are listed in table 2. most popu- lations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in this re- gion spawn and rear in rivers fed by glacial run- off (wood et al. 1987a; halupka et al. 1993; wood 1995), and adult fish are difficult to observe in these silt-laden waters. these observational diffi- culties and the fact that many populations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon are of small size (table 2) suggest that many small river-/sea-type sockeye salmon populations may have been over- looked in the past. we found numerous anecdotal references, dating back to the turn of the century, and spawning ground survey data of the washington depart- ment of fish and wildlife (wdfw), dating back to 1950 (see references in table 3), that indicate consistent riverine-spawning aggregations of sock- eye salmon occur in puget sound and olympic peninsula rivers without lake-rearing habitat (fig. 2). in all cases the spawning aggregations are small but consistent over decadal time scales. evidence for the existence of river-/sea-type 184 sockeye salmon in washington is particularly strong in the case of the north and south fork nooksack rivers and the skagit river and its major tributary, the sauk river. adult sockeye salmon have been reported in the nooksack river, which has no accessible lake-rearing habitat, since the turn of the century (rathbun 1900; kershaw 1902). crawford (1907) stated that “a few [sockeye salmon] have been known to enter the nooksack river and spawn in one of its small tributaries .... last season a great many [sockeye] salmon as- cended the nooksack river.” more recently, spawning sockeye salmon have been consistently reported along a half-mile side channel of the north fork nooksack river (fwtc 1970; willi- ams et al. 1975). other stream sections, and some tributaries, in both the north and south fork nooksack rivers, have also received limited sock- eye salmon runs (fwtc 1970). with initial sur- veys beginning in 1961, wdfw salmon spawning ground survey data (egan 1977; r. egan, pers. comm.) indicated several locations of spawning sockeye salmon in the nooksack river (table 3). in addition, sockeye salmon are caught in the nooksack river as by-catch in the nooksack tribal coho salmon harvest during the months of september through october; recent annual tribal harvest of sockeye salmon has ranged from a low of 15 to as many as 386 (hoines 1995). reference riverine-spawning sockeye salmon in the skagit river basin, wdf et al. (1993) stated that sockeye salmon “are consistently found in very small numbers in the upper sauk river and the mainstem skagit near newhalem. whether these represent strays from the baker or other river systems or are small self-sustaining populations of a few individuals is unknown.” wdfw salmon spawning ground survey data (egan 1977; r. egan, pers. comm.) also indicated several locations where sockeye salmon spawn in the skagit river basin remote from accessible lake-rearing habitat (table 3). in to genetic population structure the data matrix of allele frequencies at the 9 shared loci for all 38 lake- and river-/sea-type sock- eye salmon populations is available upon request. a paper including the complete, previously unpub- lished, 29 loci data set for sockeye salmon popula- tions from the nooksack, sauk, skagit, and cedar rivers, big bear creek, lake pleasant, and ozette and quinault lakes is in preparation. within-population variability. a total of 22 alleles were observed over the 9 loci. one locus, mpz*, was monomorphic; five loci (ada-]*, sah*, table 2. previously known spawing populations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in north america. sea-type life history type is recognizable in scale and otolith analyses; however, river-type sockeye salmon showing 1 or 2 years freshwater growth may not be distinguishable from lake-type sockeye salmon with these methods. dashes indicate data were unavailable. allozyme variability of river-/sea-type sockeye location river system stream name british columbia fraser river pitt river (widgeon slough) harrison river maria slough vancouver island burman river conuma river leiner river englishman river little qualicum river nass river basin gingut creek seaskinnish creek zolzap creek estimated total percent escapement of glacial drainage sea-type riverkea-type reference yes yes no no no no no no no yes no - 100 - - - - - - - 10&10,000 25-400 25-1,000 25-750 150-300 25-75 25-200 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 5 97-100 - - 1,500-21,000 25-750 20-2,000 6,7 6 6 river system stream name southeast alaska admiralty island hasselborg river lynn canal lace river chilkat river yakutat forelands east alsek river akwe river ahrnklin river lost river old situk river glacial percent drainage sea-type estimated total escapement of riverhea-type reference 84 19 50 93 83 99 31 92 - - - - - - - 2,775 (sea-type) 13 13 13 13 13 13 t 3 14 central alaska bering river basin bering lake shepard creek kushtaka lake 33 54 22 41,00(t109,000 - - - - - - 13 13 13 8. 9 10 8, 9 8, 9 8, 9 8, 9 11 - 76 2-6 2&23 21-55 2-21 48 4,300 (sea-type) 1,955 (sea-type) 178 (sea-type) brltlsh columbia/southeast alaska stikine river basin julian slough chutine river scud river stikine mainstem lskut river taku river basin mainstem chum salmon slough chuunk mountain slough coffee slough fish creek honatka slough south fork slough shustahini slough tuskwa slough yonakina slough hackett river nahlin river nakina river tatsamenie river yehring creek references: 1 - birtwell et at.

sockeye salmon from puget sound, washington in the south to the chilkat river in northern southeast alaska (nos. 27-37), a range of over 2000 aquatic km, were genetically closely related (fig. 4). sea- type sockeye salmon from the east alsek river (no. 38) on the yakutat forelands of northern southeast alaska did not cluster tightly together with other populations of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon. in contrast to the genetic similarity of the river-/ sea-type samples (nos. 27-38), there was consider- able heterogeneity among samples of both north- ern and southern lake-type sockeye

river-/sea-type sockeye salmon lake-type sockeye salmon in north america pri- marily spawn from the columbia river northward to western alaska, where lake and river systems in bristol bay, alaska produce the largest lake-type sockeye salmon populations in the north pacific. in asia, lake-type sockeye salmon range from hokkaido, japan, the kuril and komandorskiy is- lands, and the northwest coast of the sea of okh- otsk in the south to the anadyr river in the north (atkinson et al. 1967; foerster 1968; burgner 1991). we found published records indicating that river-/sea-type sockeye

(see references in table 2). with the exception of sea-type sockeye salmon that spawn in the harrison river and rear in the lower fraser river system of southern british col- umbia, river-/sea-type sockeye salmon had not been previously documented south of the trans- boundary stikine river in southeast alaska/ british columbia (gilbert 1918, 1919; schaefer 1951; birtwell et al. 1987; levings et al. 1995). spawning ground survey (table 3) and genetic (fig. 4-6) data presented herein suggest that river-/ sea-type sockeye salmon do indeed exist at least as far south as northern puget sound, in both the nooksack and skagit river basins. adults are dif- ficult to observe on the spawning grounds in the north fork nooksack and sauk rivers, and to a lesser degree in the south fork nooksack and upper skagit rivers, due to turbid conditions caused by the heavy silt burden in these glacier-fed rivers. thus, in response to the hypotheses raised by halupka et al. (1993), small river-/sea-type sockeye salmon populations do exist in rivers south of the fraser river but their presence has been heretofore overlooked. the status of other riverine-spawning sockeye salmon in western washington (table 3, fig. 2) is less certain. the disjunct timings (table 3) and geographic distances (fig. 2) between individual aggregations of other riverine-spawning sockeye allozyme variability of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in washington rivers without lake habitat suggest that more than one process may be respon- sible for the occurrence of these aggregations. these aggregations may represent: 1) strays from u.s. and/or british columbia lake-type popula- tions, 2) strays from river-/sea-type populations in british columbia, 3) multiple u.s. river-/sea-type populations, 4) one wide-ranging u.s. river-/sea- type population (gustafson et al. 1997), or 5) one wide-ranging west coast river-/sea-type popula- tion. available genetic data for riverine-spawning sockeye salmon in the nooksack, skagit, and sauk rivers do not support hypotheses 1 or 3 for these populations, but are consistent with hypotheses 2, 4, and 5. lorenz & eiler (1989) noted that river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in the glacial taku river, alaska preferred spawning in main channel or off-channel areas where upwelling groundwater occurs and had, on average, two times more fine sediment in their redds than had been previously measured in other sockeye salmon redds. murphy et al. (1989) identified off-channel sloughs and beaver ponds, sites with a water velocity of less than 10 c d s , as preferred rearing habitats for juvenile river-/sea- type sockeye salmon in the glacial taku river. a paucity of similar spawning and off-channel rear- ing habitat may be a limitation on population size and occurrence of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in the southern extent of the range of north american sockeye salmon. past habitat conditions of rivers in washington likely supported many more river-/sea-type sockeye salmon than is currently the case. descriptions of pre-development conditions of rivers in wash- ington that had abundant salmonid populations suggest that even big rivers had large amounts of instream large woody debris, which not only com- pletely blocked most rivers to navigation but also contributed significantly to trapping sediments and nutrients, impounding water, and creating many side channels and sloughs (sedell & luchessa 1982; sedell & froggatt 1984). the skagit river, for example, was blocked by log jams 2 km long and over 25% of the floodplain consisted of sloughs, beaver ponds, and wetlands. sedell & lu- chessa (1982) compiled a partial list of major rivers that were impassable for navigation in the mid- 1800s due to large (1 00-1 500 m-long) log jams; this list included 16 coastal washington rivers. the clearing of rivers for navigation and extensive “stream improvements,’’ accomplished to facilitate log drives, including blocking off sloughs and swamps to keep logs in the mainstream and clear- ing boulders, trees, logs, and snags from the main channel, would have eliminated most of the rearing habitat for river-/sea-type sockeye salmon in wash- 189 gustafson & winans ington’s coastal rivers. therefore, the extensive loss of river-rearing habitat in the southern extent of the range of sockeye salmon may help explain the small population size of remaining river-/sea-type sockeye salmon. genetic population structure two principal characteristics of geographic vari- ation in sockeye salmon in north america have been identified in prior population genetic studies (wood et al. 1994; winans et al. 1996). first, there are apparently two major groups or lineages of sockeye salmon (summarized in wood 1995), a southern group of populations from washington and southern british columbia (including the fraser river), and a northern group consisting of populations from mid-british columbia and alas- ka. second, geographic variation within these two groups appears to be a mosaic of differentiated populations. nearest neighbors are not necessarily genetically similar; and clinal patterns are not seen locally or over large geographic regions (see win- ans et al. 1996). both of these findings are demon- strated in the current analyses of a 9-locus allo- zyme data set. in the context of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon, the only previous genetic studies that specifically addressed this life-history type were wood et al. (1994) and wood (1995), in which three samples from the stikine river were shown to be very similar to one another, and these in turn were shown to be genetically similar to river-/sea- type sockeye salmon from the taku river (wood 1995). our analysis of 12 river-/sea-type sockeye salmon populations indicates that this life-history group is a genetically cohesive group of popula- tions relative to the mosaic variability of lake-type populations (figs. 4, 5). this result is surprising, given that the samples are separated by as much as 2000 km and presumably represent both major north american groups of anadromous lake-type sockeye salmon. the unique relationship for this life-history type between geographic and genetic distance is best illustrated in figure 6. whereas there is no apparent relationship between geo- graphic distance between lake-type sockeye salmon samples and the level of genetic divergence (not surprising given the mosaic pattern of differen- tiation), the flattened 95% confidence ellipse for the pair-wise river-/sea-type comparisons indicates that genetic distance does not increase with geo- graphic separation for riverhea life-history types. patterns of genetic population differentiation re- flect historical and present-day forces, such as natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation, acting on the heritable characteristics of 190 a population. determining which set of forces pre- dominate is difficult. avise (1994) argued that a predominant force leading to geographic variation is historical isolation. wood (1 995), in fact, postu- lated the largest break in population variation in extant populations of sockeye salmon in north america is the result of population isolation in gla- cial refugia and the subsequent re-colonization of suitable habitat. he suggested that fish isolated during the last glacial period in the bering sea area, or beringia, repopulated northern areas, and fish in the columbia river basin region persisted in southern and cascadian areas. although river-/ sea-type sockeye salmon are distributed across both of these major ancestral groups, the data here suggest that this life-history type is most closely related to the beringian group (see figs. 4, 5). why are river-/sea-type populations so similar despite their broad geographic distribution? ap- parently, they occupy a distinctive ecological niche (described above) and undoubtedly have been sub- jected to unique selective forces. that some form of balancing selection is acting on these 9 loci is possible. under the premise that the majority of molecular markers are evolutionarily neutral, this explanation is doubtful. that selection acts on one or a few loci, however, is possible (see avise 1994). another explanation is that this life-history type has recently dispersed as a group and insufficient time has passed for isolation/differentiation typical of the species to occur. given that river-/sea-type sockeye salmon are often associated with glacier- fed rivers, a reverse explanation would be more tenable: that is, since this life-history type would likely be the first to disperse under early post-gla- cia1 conditions (wood 1995), more than sufficient time has elapsed for this life-history form to have undergone isolation and differentiation. pattern and levels of gene flow may be uniquely shaping geographic variation in this species. vari- ous authors have attributed the mosaic pattern of differentiation of lake-type sockeye salmon to the high fidelity of sockeye salmon to their natal ori- gins (reviewed in wood 1995); namely, there is little gene flow among neighboring populations. fid- elity, in this argument, is presumably a function of the strength of imprinting afforded by the long freshwater stage of their juvenile development. river-/sea-type sockeye salmon have a shorter freshwater stage in comparison and typically oc- cupy a common freshwater rearing environment in lower river reaches independent of spawning loca- tion within the river basin. wood (1995) speculated that river-/sea-type sockeye salmon are more likely to stray. therefore, we suggest that the genetic similarity among river-/sea-type sockeye salmon is most likely a result of a common ancestry (e.g., from the beringian group or from a third ancestral lineage) and high level of present-day gene flow among river-/sea-type sockeye salmon populations. finally, the river-/sea-type populations are char- acterized by higher levels of average heterozygosity per locus when compared to lake-type populations (fig. 3). these relatively higher values may reflect a greater effective population size and/or less fre- quent and less severe bottlenecks than those that are presumed to have affected lake-type popula- tions (discussed in winans et al. 1996). caution is warranted with these interpretations: several of the river-/sea-type samples were small (<40 specimens) and larger sample sizes are needed to calculate the robustness of these findings. river-/sea-type sockeye salmon from the east alsek river, alaska (no. 38) exist as a genetic out- lier in comparison with other river-/sea-type sock- eye salmon analyzed (figs. 4, 5). sockeye salmon escapements to the relatively short (12 km) east alsek river, which has no lake rearing habitat, are dominated by sea-type individuals (rowse 1990; halupka et al. 1993); the remainder are river-type sockeye salmon. however, the east alsek river did not exist as a separate drainage prior to the 1960s, when migration of the alsek river channel and groundwater upwelling resulted in formation of the east alsek river (halupka et al. 1993). since that time, returns of sockeye salmon to the east alsek have increased dramatically, resulting in a mean annual harvest of over 83,000 sockeye salmon between 1980 and 1988 (rowse 1990). hal- upka et al. (1993) postulated that river-/sea-type sockeye salmon were established in the east alsek river as a result of 1) colonization by stray river-/ sea-type sockeye salmon from neighboring sys- tems, 2) a rapid, environmentally induced, pheno- typic shift in life-history type by lake-type sockeye salmon unable to access the alsek river via the recently-isolated east alsek river, or 3) a very rapid adaptive genetic shift in life history by fish similarly stranded in the east alsek river. the current allozyme findings, which place the east al- sek population as an outlier to other riverhea- type sockeye salmon, suggest that the east alsek river was not likely colonized from other river-/ sea-type populations in southeast alaska. alter- natively, this population may have passed through a genetic bottleneck early in its history (founder effect). more data are required to clarify the geographic distribution and genetic population structure of river-/sea-type sockeye salmon. several additional rivers in washington have potential, based on spawning ground surveys, to harbor small popula- tions of river- and/or sea-type sockeye salmon. fu- ture research should center on determining the allozyme variability of river-/sea-type sockeye genetic population structure of riverine-spawning aggregations of sockeye salmon in the hoh, still- aguamish, and other rivers where abundance of riverine-spawning sockeye salmon may make this effort practicable. additional genetic data from non-lethal tissue sampling for allozyme (van doornik et al., in press) and dna type characters may help clarify the distinctiveness of this long overlooked life-history form of 0. nerka. resumen 1. ademas de las poblaciones de tipo “16tico” de oncorhynchus_nerka, se han encontrado otras dos formas de
