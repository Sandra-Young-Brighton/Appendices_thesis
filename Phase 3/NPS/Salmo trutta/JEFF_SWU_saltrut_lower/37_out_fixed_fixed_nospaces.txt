affect freshwater fish can be crucial for their conservation and management. despite the widespread investigation of relation- ships between fish habitat use and environmental variables, there is a paucity of knowledge on how abiotic and biotic factors jointly influence stream fish habitat use. three new zealand south island streams were selected to investigate the habitat preference of a stream- dwelling galaxiid, banded kokopu (galaxias fasciatus). fish abundance in several permanent pools was determined by spotlighting at night once a month from june 2008 to may 2009. drifting invertebrates and key physical features of each pool were measured at the time of fish sampling. an information- theoretic approach (aic) indicated that the most parsimonious candidate model to predict banded kokopu biomass was the one that included pool area, undercut banks, water velocity, overhanging vegetation, invertebrate drift density and an interaction term between invertebrate drift density and water velocity. banded kokopu biomass was positively related to pool area, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation and inverte- brate drift density. our study suggests that fish resource use patterns need to be un- derstood in the context of multiple interacting ecological factors, including prey abundance. k e y w o r d s banded kokopu, food supply, habitat use, pool characteristics 1 |  introduction habitat use and home range are crucial elements in the ecology of animals and can be defined as the occurrence of a species or individual in space and time (kernohan, gitzen, & millspaugh, 2001). stream fish communities are often highly structured, and individuals select their habitat patches nonrandomly (evans et al., 1987; jackson, somers, & harvey, 1992). there is substantial evidence that demonstrates that both abiotic (ayllón, almodóvar, nicola, & elvira, 2009; johnson & douglass, 2009; salas & snyder, 2010) and biotic (kawaguchi, taniguchi, & nakano, 2003; roussel & bardonnet, 1999) factors influ- ence freshwater fish distribution and abundance in ecosystems. optimal habitats are those which provide both suitable shelters and food supply allowing fish to maximise their growth. patterns of habitat use among freshwater fishes have been well- studied; however, the models proposed in this regard are mostly based on physical hab- itat structure. the role of food supply has had only limited study (but see giannico, 2000; hayes, hughes, & kelly, 2007; hansen & closs, 2009; salas & snyder, 2010). this is partly due to the difficulty of long- term monitoring of food abundance and access for individuals. hence, to fully understand the factors influencing the relationship between fish and their environment, interactions between the physical habitat and food supply need to be studied (grossman, 2013; hayes, ferreri, & taylor, 1996; wipfli & baxter, 2010). to investigate the relationship between fish and their environ- ment, we selected banded kokopu, an endemic new zealand galaxiid fish as a test species. they are medium- sized invertebrate drift- feeding galaxiid fish that typically live in the pools of small, forested streams (akbaripasand, krkosek, lokman, & closs, 2014; akbaripasand, nichol, lokman, & closs, 2011). banded kokopu feed on terrestrial and 270  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish.

jowett, & richardson, 2005). in this paper, we report the results of a long- term investigation of how habitat use of the fish interacts with both abiotic and biotic factors at the me- sohabitat level in three natural streams. the main goal of this study was to examine spatial associations between banded kokopu biomass and habitat use, with a particular focus on the interaction between physical habitat parameters and invertebrate drift density. the phys- ical habitat parameters examined in relation to fish biomass included pool area, water velocity, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation and invertebrate drift density. these variables were based on previ- ous studies indicating their importance in relation to habitat use by banded and giant kokopu (galaxias argenteus) (baker & smith, 2007; hansen & closs, 2009). we expected a positive relationship between number of fish and pool area, and the biomass of fish in relation to food supply and other determinants of food supply such as water ve- locity and overhanging vegetation. many freshwater fish populations are declining due to the anthropogenic habitat degradation related to the conversion of forest to pasture (allibone et al., 2010; hanchet, 1990; mcdowall, 1990; rowe, chisnall, dean, & richardson, 1999); hence, information on their habitat requirements is essential for effec- tive management. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study locations     |  271 excellent systems in which to study banded kokopu as they are the only common large fish species present, thus avoiding the effects of interspecific competition. we observed no more than 1–2 long- finned eel (anguilla dieffenbachia, max length ~ 150 cm) and the occasional common bully (gobius cotidianus) in each stream, and no interactions with banded kokopu were observed. 2.2 | fish biomass measurement the relationship between banded kokopu biomass and pool environ- mental variables, fish abundance was determined by spotlighting after sunset, with fish being also caught by hand- net for length–weight measurements (hickey & closs, 2006). seven, six and seven perma- nent pools were selected for sampling in craigs creek, deborah bay stream and sawyers bay stream, respectively. fish sampling occurred at night once a month from june 2008 to may 2009. the captured fish were anaesthetised using 2- phenoxyethanol at 120 μl/l. after meas- uring the weight (g) of each fish, they were placed in buckets with stream water to recover and then returned to the stream at the point of capture. each pool supports one or two large plus a few smaller fish, representing a size- based dominance hierarchy (hansen & closs, 2009). to examine size- related habitat use, the fish were divided into two size categories of small and large. we used 80–90 mm as cut- off length to divide fish in each pool into small and large categories as banded kokopu start to defend territories at this size threshold (see akbaripasand et al., 2011). the study was conducted in craigs creek, deborah bay stream and sawyers bay stream, all of which drain into otago harbour, south island, new zealand (figure 1). craigs creek and sawyers bay stream run through pastoral land with patches of riparian trees and shrubs, and with some limited residential development. in contrast, deborah bay stream is well shaded by native vegetation (see table 1 for more details on physical structure of the streams). these streams represent 2.3 | biological and physical habitat structure measurements to determine which environmental variables were associated with banded kokopu biomass (g) in pools,

each month from june 2008 to may 2009. instead of pool volume, pool area was measured as the pools within and across the three streams were almost similar in depth. mean water velocity in the middle of each pool was measured by recording velocity at 60% of the depth below the water surface (bonnett, mcdowall, & sykes, 2002) using an electronic flow metre (marsh- mcbirney inc., frederick, md, usa; flo- mate, accuracy ± 0.02 m/s). to determine the availabil- ity of drifting invertebrate prey entering each pool, cone- shaped drift nets of 400- μm- mesh size, 250 mm mouth diameter and 80 cm length were placed at the upstream end of each pool where the riffle met the pool. the drift nets blocked at least 90% of the stream width ensuring that most invertebrates drifting into the pools were caught. the nets were set after sunset and left for 24 hr. the current flow and water depth at the mouth of each drift net were recorded six times over 24 hr and averaged to determine the volume of water filtered. a new set of drift nets were placed in the same spot every 4 hr to prevent the nets becoming clogged, and care was taken to avoid disturbance to the streambed during net replacement. the entire invertebrate catch in each net was preserved in 90% ethanol in the field and subse- quently counted under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. the densities of drifting invertebrates were standardised to the number of invertebrates per m3 for each pool. only the densities of drifting invertebrates during the night were considered for the analysis given that banded kokopu are primarily nocturnal. the monthly sampling of invertebrate has been reported to be sufficient to detect the rela- tive differences in invertebrate drift density between pools (hansen & closs, 2007, 2009). undercut banks area (m2) was measured using a ruler. we used a model a convex spherical densiometer (forest densiometers, arlington, va 22207, usa) to assess the area above each pool covered by overhanging vegetation. 2.4 | data analysis analysis of variance (anova) was employed to compare mean num- ber of small and large fish in pools among the study streams. the analysis for fish biomass modelling comprised two steps. we explored the relationships between fish biomass with environmental variables (pool area, water velocity, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation and invertebrate drift density) in each pool using a linear regression. the data were pooled across the three streams for investigating such akbaripasand and closs     |  273 figure 2 box plot with 95% interval confidence

average number of small and large fish of all pools for each study stream (see text for definition of small and large fish) relationships. for all fish biomass and environmental variables, these regressions were computed using the means across all samples in each pool over the period of study. we examined how combined physical and biological factors and their interactions influence banded kokopu biomass, selecting the most parsimonious linear mixed model (lmm) using aicc (burnham & anderson, 2002). because the data from the three streams were pooled, we incorporated pools in the streams as a random factor (pools nested in streams) in the lmm to control for pool and stream effects in our analysis. a global model including all the above environmental variables was produced. we also added the interaction term between water velocity and invertebrate drift density to the global model as food availability as a function of stream flow is an important variable in fish biomass (railsback & harvey, 2002). variance information factors (vif) were calculated to study possible collinearity between all pairs of the environmental variables prior to the modelling. top models predicting fish biomass were obtained if the models had akaike weight (wi) values >10% of the model with the highest wi value (burnham & anderson, 2002). we fitted the models to the data with functions implemented in lme4 library (bates, maechler, bolker, & walker, 2013) in the sta- tistical software r (r core development team 2013). to compare pa- rameter estimates of the fixed effects (predictor variables) on different measurement scales, the input variables were standardised using the standardise function available in arm package (gelman & su, 2013). 3 |  results 3.1 | fish

diagonal], deborah bay stream [open circle] and sawyers bay stream [open triangle], respectively) creek, deborah bay stream and sawyers bay stream, respectively (figure 2a- c). the mean number of small fish was significantly higher than that of large fish in all streams; craigs creek (f1,144 = 33.28; p < .001), deborah bay stream (f1,134 = 43.99; p < .001) and sawyers bay stream (f1,142 = 31.04; p < .001) (figure 2d). there was a posi- tive relationship between banded kokopu abundance and pool area (r2 = .33, p = .008). banded kokopu biomass was correlated with pool area (r2 = .35, p = .006, figure 3a), undercut banks (r2 = .23, p = .03; figure 3c), overhanging vegetation (r2 = .32, p = .01; figure 3d) and invertebrate drift density (r2 = .41, p = .003; figure 3e) across the three streams. there was no relationship between fish biomass and water velocity (r2 = .003, p = .81; figure 3b). invertebrate drift den- sity was negatively correlated with water velocity in pools (r2 = .43, p = .002; figure 3f). the mean physical characteristics of pools, mean fish biomass and mean invertebrate drift density in pools across the study streams are summarised in table 1. akbaripasand and closs 3.2 | environmental variables predicting fish biomass per pool the estimated vif values (table 1) among the environmental vari- ables (pool area, water velocity, undercut banks, overhanging veg- etation and invertebrate drift density) predicting banded kokopu biomass in pools were below the threshold levels of 4 and 10 that are commonly used in vif analysis when testing for collinearity; hence, all the variables were included in the modelling. when all the five predictor variables and the interaction term were included in the full model, the single model that best explained the variation in fish biomass in pools included pool area, water velocity, under- cut banks, overhanging vegetation, invertebrate drift density and the interaction term (table 2, first model). the parameter estimates of pool area and invertebrate drift density were high and positive (37.62 and 42.69, respectively), indicating that fish biomass in pools increased as pool area and/or invertebrate drift density coefficients increased. in contrast, water velocity had a negative parameter esti- mate showing that banded kokopu biomass per pool was negatively correlated with pool current velocity. although parameter estimates for both undercut banks and overhanging vegetation were positive, their confidence intervals included zero indicating that they were not significant at α = 0.05 under the conventional null hypothesis sig- nificance testing framework (nakagawa & cuthill, 2007). the con- fidence intervals for parameter estimates of water velocity and the interaction term of water velocity and invertebrate drift density also included zero. 3.3 | fish biomass, water velocity and invertebrate drift density interactions pool water velocity had a medium negative effect on fish biomass in terms of its effect size (−16.31, table 3). model comparison using anova showed a significant effect of invertebrate drift density driv- ing fish biomass per pool when it was added to a model which in- cluded only water velocity as a predictor (χ2[1] = 895.68, p < .001). although the interaction term between water velocity and drifting invertebrate density as a predictor in our global model (including all environmental variables) was not statistically significant (p = .080) in predicting banded kokopu biomass per pool, it was significant when α = 0.1. 4 |  discussion in- stream physical habitat characteristics have been recognised to influence fish habitat selection (i.e. mcewan & joy, 2014; mundahl, mundahl, & thomas, 2012; pess, quinn, schindler, & liermann, 2013). we showed that larger pools can be occupied by more fish because of the greater area of habitat and an increase in microhabitat diversity. each pool was inhabited by one or two large fish and many small fish, a pattern best explained by the fact that dominance hierarchies occur in pool- dwelling banded kokopu (akbaripasand, krkosek, et al., 2014).     |  275 banded kokopu biomass was correlated with several environmen- tal factors, including pool area, pool water velocity, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation and invertebrate drift density, with pool area and invertebrate drift density having the highest positive effect size. hansen and closs (2009) similarly concluded that pool area and inver- tebrate drift density were the most important predictors of density and biomass of giant kokopu in streams, respectively. our findings also concur with previous work (jowett, richardson, & mcdowall, 1996; kawaguchi et al., 2003) in which invertebrate biomass was found as a key determinant of stream- dwelling fish abundance. these examples show that fish biomass varies with the habitat size and specifically with the magnitude of food availability in the habitat (giannico, 2000; nislow, folt, & seandel, 1998; thompson, petty, & grossman, 2001). it is worth noting that the banded kokopu in our study are likely food limited (akbaripasand, ramezani, lokman, & closs, 2014); hence, food resource availability likely plays a key role in determining drift- feeding fish assemblages in small streams. the most parsimonious model for fish biomass included a posi- tive relationship with invertebrate drift density and a negative rela- tionship with water velocity. several reports indicated that banded kokopu (akbaripasand et al., 2011; chadderton & allibone, 2000; jowett, hayes, deans, & eldon, 1998; mccullough, 1998) and giant kokopu (bonnett et al., 2002; david & closs, 2003; whitehead, david, & closs, 2002) prefer pools with slow velocities. understanding how water velocity interacts with drifting invertebrates, which are the main source of food for banded kokopu, is vital for understanding their habi- tat use. although an increase in water velocity may enhance the supply of drifting invertebrates to each pool (brittain & eikeland, 1988; grant & noakes, 1987; hill & grossman, 1993; hughes & dill, 1990), prey strike and prey capture efficiency declines in faster currents (facey & grossman, 1992). surprisingly, we found more drifting invertebrates in areas of lower velocity. water velocity alone was not a key determi- nant in determining fish biomass in pools, but its interaction with food in driving fish position in the habitat seems to be important in this study as well as elsewhere (fausch, 1984; rosenfeld, leiter, lindner, & rothman, 2005). undercut banks and overhanging vegetation also contributed to explaining the fish biomass, but not in all three streams. in- stream cover is a critical physical habitat factor that explains the presence of many galaxiid fish in streams (david & closs, 2003; rowe & smith, 2003; west et al., 2005). our results correspond with baker and smith (2007) in which banded kokopu and giant kokopu habitat use was strongly associated with undercut banks and debris dams. although woody debris was scarce in our study streams, the species seems to have affinity for any type of sufficiently large in- stream cover (rowe & smith, 2003). undercut banks are suggested to act as refuges for banded kokopu by day as the fish are primarily nocturnal (mcdowall, 1990; halstead, 1998; mccullough, 1998; and also this study). large nocturnal giant kokopu were also reported to use in- stream cover during the day (david & closs, 2001). the higher biomass of banded kokopu in pools with overhanging vegetation emphasises the importance of riparian vegetation in pro- viding terrestrial invertebrate prey (edwards & huryn, 1996; collier & akbaripasand and closs table 2 model rankings (full model

(akbaripasand, 2012), banded kokopu were shown to take twice as many aquatic invertebrates as terrestrial inver- tebrates in craigs creek with low overhanging vegetation, whereas the terrestrial species were numerically as important as aquatic species in the fish diet from deborah bay stream with higher overhanging vegetation. in the current study, we observed a weak positive rela- tionship between overhanging vegetation and invertebrate density; hence, preference of banded kokopu for overhanging vegetation may not be food related. like previous work (eldon, 1978; hicks & barrier,

relating fish abundance to only habitat physical parameters has been the subject of many studies to determine habitat capacity, while the role of food resources has received little attention in this regard (rosenfeld, bouwes, wall, & naman, 2013). focusing solely on one type of variable, either abiotic or biotic, results in misleading infor- mation on the relationship between fish and the environment (hayes et al., 1996). we have demonstrated that integrating physical habitat and biological factors is the best approach in predicting fish abun- dance and biomass, rather than investigating such relationships in isolation. it is worth noting that the role of each environmental factor in a complex model may vary over a yearly cycle or between habi- tats (i.e. see gasith & resh, 1999; gosselin, petts, & maddock, 2010; langford & hawkins, 1997; legalle, santoul, figuerola, mastrorillo, & cereghino, 2005; perrow, punchard, & jowitt, 1997; rosenfeld, 2003; salas & snyder, 2010). hence, fish habitat use patterns need to be evaluated across several environmental descriptors (hayes et al., 1996), and long- term monitoring of prey resources is needed to fully elucidate such patterns. acknowledgements this research would not have been completed without the help of imelda velasquez, hadi pourbagher, francis magbanua, amir hamidian, anslem rossi, etienne schaller,
