(1999) and bohlin et al. (2002) showed in contrast to bachman (1984) and elliot (1994), that growth among yearlings in wild populations can be negatively correlated to density. in addition, sundstro¨m et al. (2004) showed that poststocking growth of hatchery- reared brown_trout in the wild is density dependent. studies are needed to ascertain whether trout growth is density dependent and whether stocking impairs growth in wild ﬁsh. if so, some displacement of wild ﬁsh because of food shortages might be expected after stocking. a manipulative dose–response style experiment was designed in open ﬁeld enclosures to evaluate the growth, recapture and movement of wild trout after intensive stockings with hatchery-reared ﬁsh. the question of whether growth, recapture and movement of hatchery ﬁsh in the wild is density dependent, is also addressed. material and methods study area the river saubach, located in baden-wu¨rttemberg, southern germany, is a small tributary of the river radolfzeller aach, which runs near the city of radolfzell into lake constance (fig. 1). the saubach has a catchment area of 148 km2, a wetted width of 2–4 m and an average depth of 0.4 m. the brook was chosen, because the habitat condition was uniform in the study area. no differences between stocking stretches (see below) were observed. it is characterised by runs, rifﬂes and fast and slow ﬂowing channels

throughout the experimental period the mean daily water temperature was recorded using a stowaway tidbit temperature logger (onset computer associationó, bourne, maine, usa) instal- led in the middle

from 450 to 550 lsæcm the ﬁsh fauna consists of only two species, brown_trout and bullhead (cottus gobio l.). trout live and spawn in the saubach. a large proportion of the trout hatched in the saubach migrate during their second winter (aged one and a half years) into the larger river, while a very small number spend their whole life in the few deeper sections of the saubach (baer, unpublished data). marking procedure the experimental unit was a stream section 950 m long, approximately 1.5 km from the radolfzeller aach conﬂuence. this section started 50 m above a weir that formed an impassable barrier. the section was divided into six 100 m long subsections (s1–s6, fig. 1), separated by 50 m gaps. tape measurements reveal an average wetted width of about 3 m. in april 2002 and 2003, the resident trout in the experimental unit were captured by two electro-ﬁshing runs (efko, straight dc, 300–600 v, leutkirch, germany). on these survey days, each subsection was enclosed by stop nets. fish from each subsection were anaesthetised )1). visible-implant-elastomer tags (clove oil, 0.1 mlæl (northwest marine technology, seattle, wa, usa) with colours speciﬁc to each subsection were attached to the membrane posterior to the eye (hale & gray 1998). the ﬁsh were measured (total length lt to the nearest mm), weighed (to the nearest g) and released back into the subsection where they were captured. the target ﬁsh were those <20 cm long, deﬁned as 1-year old (1+). these individuals were marked in each batch with a speciﬁc combination of tag colours. in total, the complete tagged resident population (without fry) in the six subsections consisted of 176 individuals in april 2002 and 171 individuals in april 2003. trout one day after the resident trout were tagged in 2002 and 2003, on a small farm (forellenzucht hilzingen) 1-year old hatchery-reared brown_trout originating from the local catchment area were weighed, measured and marked with batch-speciﬁc

of 10.6 g ± 3.6 were processed. in both years, 1 day after the tagging procedure the marked ﬁsh were released in different densities into four subsections: in two subsections (s2 and s4) the stocked trout tripled the existing population (treatment t), in a further two subsections (s3 and s5) the population was quintupled (treatment q). the two remaining subsections (s1 and s6) were not stocked so that the population remained at its original density (treatment n). the numbers of ﬁsh stocked and tagged in each treatment in each year are given in table 1, while fig. 2 shows the initial length distribution of stocked and resident 1+ trout. during study period, all stocked 1+ trout were used and marked for the experiment. according to local authorities stocking with 0+ trout upstream or downstream of the study area have never been done. recapture in june and october 2002 and 2003, 43 and 161 days after stocking, surveys were carried out to recapture tagged ﬁsh. an additional survey in april 2004 sought to recapture ﬁsh after a further year (354 days) to provide a comparison with the ﬁrst year recaptures (from april 2002 to april 2003). for every survey, each subsection was separated by stop nets and two electro-ﬁshing passes were made. to check for strays, one electro-ﬁshing run was conducted in each gap and sampling was extended 50 m downstream of subsec- tion s1, just above the impassable weir and 50 m upstream of subsection s6. if a ﬁsh was recaptured density-dependent growth and recapture after stocking 2002 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2003 h s i f f

deﬁned as having moved. every ﬁsh caught during the surveys was checked for marks, weighed and measured, then released back into the capture area. angling in the last 3 km of the river saubach was forbidden for the duration of the study (2002–2004), but was permitted as usual in the river radolfzeller aach. the local angling club was informed about the survey and all ﬁshermen were given an information sheet explaining how to recognise tagged trout, how to distinguish the different batches or tag-colour combi- nations, respectively, and how to record them on special forms. anglers were also invited to attend training courses before the opening of the 2002 and 2003 ﬁshing seasons. catch and release is forbidden in germany, but trout accidentally caught below legal size (25 cm long) have to be released. statistical analyses the probability of capture p (deﬁned as electric ﬁshing success) was estimated separately for hatchery and resident trout using the equation by moran (1951): 457 baer & brinker p ð%þ ¼ t kn0   m ð1þ where t is the total number of ﬁsh caught (hatchery or resident trout), k the number of samples and n0 the original population size. m was calculated as: ðk   iþ ci¼m ð2þ x k i¼1 where ci is the number of ﬁsh caught at the ith sample. according to seber & lecren (1967), n0 is calculated as: n0 ¼ c2 ð3þ 1 c1   c2 where c1 is the number of ﬁsh caught at the ﬁrst and c2 at the second sample. according to cowx (1983), the population size in each subsection each year 43 and 161 days after stocking and the whole stream popu- lation size in april 2002, 2003 and 2004 were calculated by using piscistat (s. blank, langenargen, germany) version 1.2, using the solution for two-run removal by carle & strub (1978):    kn0   m   t þ 0:5k kn0   m þ 1 þ 0:5k  n0 þ 1 n0   t þ 1 k 1 ð4þ where n0, k, t and m are as deﬁned previously. to achieve an estimate of population density per square metre, a mean wetted width of 3 m was assumed. the thermal growth coefﬁcient (tgc) was calcu- lated for recaptured stocked and tagged resident trout according to iwama & tautz (1981): tgc½%d  1 ¼ fbw1=3   ibw1=3 h p i¼1 ti  d 100 i d ð5þ where fbw is the ﬁnal body weight (g), ibw is the mean initial body weight (g) of stocked or tagged resident 1+ trout, ti the average temperature on the ith day ( c) and d the number of days. tgc was used because this parameter allows comparison between growth of ﬁsh of different sizes growing in different water temperatures. recapture 43 or 161 days after stocking was calculated as a percentage of the initial stocking or tagged population, separated for each year, for each subsection and for stocked, 1+ tagged resident and older tagged resident trout. the absolute overall recapture rate 354 days after stocking (period i or ‘yearly recapture’) and 43 days after stocking (period ii, for stocked or resident 1+ trout was calculated as a percentage of the initial stocked or tagged population. ‘spring recapture’) 458 in addition, the relative recaptures for the period iii (the percentage of yearlings caught on experimental day 43 also caught at day 161, the ‘summer recapture’) and for the period iv (the percentage of yearlings caught at experimental day 161 also caught at day 324, the ‘winter recapture’) were also calculated. the number of ﬁsh recaptured outside their release or tagging site 43 or 161 days after stocking in each year was documented for each group from each subsection and deﬁned as percentage movement. thermal growth coefﬁcient, recapture and movement of yearlings was tested by a full factorial generalised linear model (glm) using origin (hatchery ⁄ resident), density (total number of caught trout per square metre in each section 43 or 161 days after stocking), and days after stocking (43 or 161 days) with year as a random block factor (sokal & rohlf 2003). for older ﬁsh, the model was applied only for recapture and origin was excluded (all older ﬁsh were residents). fishing success was tested by analysis of covariance with origin and density. the expected mean square method was used to ﬁt current models for random effects. stocking success expressed as densities after )2) was tested by glm includ- stocking (individualsæm ing treatment (treatments n, t and q) and year as random effects. post hoc comparisons were made by tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (hsd) test (hayter 1984) or by building contrasts (sokal & rohlf 2003). all descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were calculated according to sachs (1997). the data were analysed using jmp (sas institute inc., cary, north carolina, usa) version 7.0. results electric ﬁshing success was not affected by origin or ﬁsh density or by the interaction of these two variables (ancova; p > 0.05). the mean ﬁshing efﬁciency for all trout was 73.4% (sd ± 9.4%). the april population size of resident 1+ and older trout before stocking in all years was highly consis- tent: 0.08 ± 0.01

lower than in the stocked sections. furthermore, the densities in the quintuple stocked sections (0.16 ± 0.03) were higher than in the triple stocked sections (0.09 ± 0.02) (p < 0.00001). in each year, natural reproduction of brown_trout was observed within the experimental area. throughout the study period all recaptured ﬁsh showed adequate growth. however, the growth model revealed that origin has a very strong effect on tgc (p < 0.0001) (table 2) with residents (0.11 ± 0.04 vs. 0.08 ± 0.02) showing faster growth. in addition, a density-dependent growth and recapture after stocking

recaptured resident ﬁsh 14.4% (sd ± 3.1%) showed movement whereas 44.2% (sd ± 4.2%) of hatchery ﬁsh had moved away from the release area (p < 0.0001). no signiﬁcant upstream or downstream movement of stocked trout could be resolved from the data (p > 0.1). most of the relocated hatchery trout were found in one of the neighbouring stocking sections or in the gaps between two stocking sections. relatively few ﬁsh moved into unstocked sections or to sections with low ﬁsh densities (p > 0.7). in 2002, 43 days after stocking, a total of just nine hatchery ﬁsh were observed in the two unstocked sections, 161 days after stocking there were 10. in 2003, the corresponding ﬁgures were seven and ﬁve. 460 discussion in the present study, the growth of resident trout was density independent. even if population density was quintupled by stocking with hatchery-reared trout, the growth rates of the resident ﬁsh did not decline. a possible explanation is that resident ﬁsh have com- petitive advantages over newly stocked hatchery ﬁsh. sundstro¨m & johnsson (2001) showed in feeding experiments that wild trout ate more, were quicker to attack, and consumed attacked prey more efﬁciently than hatchery-reared ﬁsh. observations in the present study are in agreement with bachman (1984) and consistent with other studies in which the young stages of migratory brown_trout showed no density-dependent effects on growth rate (elliot 1994). however, other works have shown that growth can be density dependent: jenkins et al. (1999) manipulated the density of 1+ resident brown_trout in small streams and found negative effects on growth and bohlin et al. (2002) recorded density-dependent effects after raising the density of resident 1+ trout in different streams through stocking. both studies came to the conclusion that a lower population density resulting from higher initial mortality and⁄ or reduced egg deposition, would lead to higher individual growth in juvenile trout. jenkins et al. (1999) found effects at densities below one 1+ trout per square metre, bohlin et al. (2002) at densities above two individuals per square metre. in the present study, the highest densities were below 0.9 individuals per square metre and no density-dependent growth effects were observed. thus, it appears that density-dependent growth is site speciﬁc. the results of experiments by weiss & schmutz (1999), in which two streams of contrasting physicochemical properties were stocked with 2- to 3- year-old trouts support this hypothesis. they found that growth of resident brown_trout was negatively affected by stocking in one stream only. consequently, negative impacts of stocking on resident trout growth should not be presumed in every stream, even if the resident population is tripled or quintupled as in the present study. the factors that lead to density-depen- dent growth in resident trout, and those that preclude such effects deserve further investigation. the brown_trout in contrast to the resident trout, the growth rates of stocked trout in the present study were inversely density dependent. similar effects on hatchery-reared brown_trout were observed by sundstro¨m et al. (2004). several factors may explain this effect. the low recorded movement of the resident ﬁsh suggests that in the river saubach are territorial, at least during summer. consequently, stocked hatchery-reared trout may need to compete for territory. at a high population densities stocked ﬁsh may be required to invest much more energy and time in competitive interaction than at low densities (deverill et al. 1999), resulting in depressed growth rates. futhermore, as other authors have shown (metcalfe et al. 2003; sundstro¨m et al. 2003), the hatchery environment may reduce the ability of hatchery-reared trout to compete with wild resident ﬁsh for territories. despite having a relatively low tgc compared with resident trout, the hatchery-reared ﬁsh introduced to the experimental area in both years of the current study still grew well. therefore, those stocked individuals that were recaptured must have learned fast to feed on new prey. according to johnsen & ugedal (1986), hatchery trout can learn to feed on wild prey nearly as well as wild ﬁsh within 1 week. the growth rates of the introduced ﬁsh, particularly at low densities where the tgc was comparable with that of resident ﬁsh, suggests that limited in the river saubach during the study period. this assumption is underlined by another study in southern germany, which found comparable trout abundance in an extremely nutrient-poor (geist et al. 2006). therefore it can be assumed, that in the river saubach with mesotrophic nutrient status food is not limited. in agreement with sundstro¨m et al. (2004), growth of hatchery-reared ﬁsh in the wild appears to be more dependent upon the presence of competitors than on natural foraging ability. food was not river the present study demonstrated a density effect on recapture. recapture rates fell with increasing density, regardless of the origin of ﬁsh. for resident trout this was unexpected, given that bohlin et al. (2002) and jenkins et al. (1999) observed a density-independent recapture of resident trout after stocking hatchery- reared trout. several authors have demonstrated the competitive superiority of resident salmonids over introduced ﬁsh (bra¨nna¨s 1995; glova & field-dodg- son 1995) known as the ‘prior residence effect’ (huntingford & deleaniz 1997; rhodes & quinn 1998). in studies of territorial competition among brown_trout fry, johnsson et al. (1999) showed that in density-dependent growth and recapture after stocking 85% of the contests the territory owner could displace the invader, and that it took a 30% size advantage in introduced ﬁsh to balance the advantage of ownership. the difference may lie in the magnitude of the density increase. in the present study, the tripling or quintu- pling of the population would have meant that the resident 1+ trout would suddenly have had to face several competitors of the same size from 1 day to another. although the resident trout were larger than introduced ﬁsh in both years, they had to compete for food and space for several weeks. all 1+ ﬁsh would have experienced a prolonged increase in competitive stress. stocking and stocking intensity may also have had an inﬂuence on the recapture of resident 1+ trout. this theory is supported by the fact that, independent of treatment, the recapture rate of resident 1+ trout 43 days poststocking (during high densities) was lower than in the period from day 43 to day 161 (during which time densities fell as more stocked trout moved away). the movement of resident 1+ trout from unstocked sections was comparable with that of 1+ trout from stocked sections. despite having the opportunity to move to unstocked parts of the river resident 1+ trout were generally recaptured in the units where they were ﬁrst tagged. this means, that the resident individuals tended to remain at their original site, despite increased competition. this behaviour could be explained by the assumption that the ﬁtness costs of defending a site are lower than those incurred in leaving and searching for a new free territory. a question remains what happened to 1+ residents that were not recaptured. they could have migrated, died or simply been missed by the electro-ﬁshing. there is evidence that mark–recapture studies might be sensi- tive to ﬁsh movements outside the study reach (gowan & fausch 1996). the present study used unstocked sections downstream (s1) and upstream (s6), each 100 m long, accompanied by two 50 m gap sections to minimise this possible bias. but if signiﬁcant numbers of residents in the highly stocked areas had migrated, it could be expected that records of movement would have been higher compared with unstocked sections. in addition, only one resident trout, tagged as a 1+ ﬁsh, was caught by an angler in the river radolfzeller aach 1 year later. this individual may have relocated downstream during the ‘normal’ winter migration. the relative paucity of movement records among resident ﬁsh may indicate increased mortality in displaced ﬁsh. it could be assumed that prolonged competition for space and food drove residents out of their territory. stressed and displaced ﬁsh are likely to face increased exposure to predators like heron (ardea cinerea l.) and thus a higher mortality. however, even if it could not be clariﬁed in detail what happened to the not recaptured ﬁsh (emigration or dieing), the gen- eral outcome is in agreement with the ﬁndings of 461 baer & brinker bohlin et al. (2002), who suggested, in contrast to elliot (1994), that competition is not limited to young fry and that density effects may regulate population size in trout older than one summer. no density effects on poststocking recapture were observed for trout of elder year classes. hence, competition between stocked and resident trout seems to occur only between trout of the same size (in this case 1+). in the study of jenkins et al. (1999), large trout were always less affected by increasing density than small individuals. in agreement with those authors, it is suggested that large trout have a competitive advantage over small trout that increases with density. hatchery trout moved more than resident trout, but as a general rule still tended to stay at their introduc- tion site. despite having the opportunity to move into unstocked sections, most of them were recaptured in the section where they were released. they did not appear to make any attempt to avoid higher densities and thereby to avoid competition. the reason for this lingering behaviour is unclear. hatchery-reared trout will have been accustomed to live in high densities and therefore they may be more tolerant of high densities in the wild as well, despite the negative effect of increased competition, exacerbated by the presence of prior resident trout to which stocked individuals are likely to lose out in conﬂicts over food and space. presumably, this was a factor in the lower growth rates of stocked trout over residents and in the lower recapture and higher mortality rates of trout stocked in higher densities. large initial mortality, as observed in this study, trout stocking (needham & slater 1944; flick & webster 1964; bachman 1984). in agreement with the present study, other authors have also found poststocking mortality to be density dependent (berg & jørgensen 1991). is a general feature of in addition to the density effect, recapture rates were also shown to decline since stocking, indepen- dent of origin. as explained above, competition for space is a likely factor in declining recapture rates as density increases. if large trout have a competitive advantage over small individuals (jenkins et al. 1999; johnsson et al. 1999), it is likely that many smaller individuals of the same age will be displaced. in addition to background mortality which increases naturally with time, selective displacement of smaller trout could explain the decreasing recapture rates during the year. in the present study, 1+ trout slightly smaller than the residents of the same age were stocked. however, as stated above and according to other studies observed effects are likely to have been more pronounced, if larger ﬁsh up to the size of the residents could have been used (jenkins et al. 1999; johnsson et al. 1999). during the electro-ﬁshing surveys no indications of different catch probability became obvious; however, 462 nearly 40% of resident 1+ trout and more than 70% of stocked individuals were never recaptured. a propor- tion of the ﬁsh will have descended into the adjacent river radolfzeller aach and some may even have migrated into lake constance. the complete lack of stocked trout recapture records from anglers in the river radolfzeller aach between 2002 and 2007 is puzzling, but the stocking of hatchery-reared trout clearly increased the population density in the river saubach during the ensuing summer. all recaptured hatchery ﬁsh showed good growth, especially those recaptured after 6 months. most stocked ﬁsh seemed to disappear during their ﬁrst winter. yearly recapture records were virtually nil. over a 12-month timescale stocking seems to have little to no effect. nevertheless, some of the stocked trout that survived their ﬁrst 6 months may migrate along with resident trout during winter into the river radolfzeller aach and may contribute to the downstream wild population and to the yield of the anglers. during the whole study period, natural reproduction was observed in ﬁsh that overwintered in the river saubach. this compensated for the mortality and migration losses of 1+ trout. thus, after a single winter the population density returned to its base level. this is in agreement with the ﬁndings of berg & jørgensen (1991) and indicates that winter survival, not competition during summer, is the main bottleneck limiting density of brown_trout population in the river saubach. as the study shows, growth of wild brown_trout during their second summer is not necessarily density dependent and not automatically affected by stocking with hatchery-reared trout as has previously been suggested. only the stocked trout exhibited density- dependent growth. in contrast, recapture and therefore most likely emigration or mortality, can be density dependent, independent of origin. fisheries managers should be aware that there is a risk that stocking may deplete part of the resident population, in particular where stocking densities are high and comprise ﬁsh of the same age class. the advantages of stocking (seen here as temporarily elevated biomass) should be weighed against possible decreases in certain parts of the wild stock, at least during summer. acknowledgements this project was funded by the fischereiabgabe baden- wu¨rttemberg. permission to use the study sites for electric ﬁshing was kindly granted by the angling club
