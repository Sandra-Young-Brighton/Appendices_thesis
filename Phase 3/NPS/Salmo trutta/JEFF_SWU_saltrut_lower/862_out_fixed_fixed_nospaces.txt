nilsson et al. 2005), freshwater protected areas have received little attention in contrast to the establishment of terrestrial and more recently marine protected ones (maitland 1995; abell et al. 2007). since the un convention on biological diversity in rio de janeiro in 1992, genetic diversity has been considered a crucial factor in species conservation. in recent decades, many ﬁshery programmes have designed guidelines for preserving intraspeciﬁc genet- ic variability and have introduced new concepts to deﬁne appropriate conservation units (esu, waples 1991; ocu, doadrio et al. 1996). to support fresh- water ﬁsheries, the primary management strategy to maintain or improve degraded (or perceived to be degraded) wild populations have been extensive releases (stocking) of cultured ﬁsh (brown & day 2002). however, less attention has been devoted to the 610 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00312.x effect of these releases on maintaining the genetic variability of the native populations (ryman et al. 1995; frankham 2005; laikre et al. 2005). although guidelines for stocking are available (cowx 1994, 1999), often ﬁsh are stocked without a clear reason on why the wild population needs to be enhanced. a potentially detrimental result of stockings is the reduction in stock ﬁtness by genetic introgres- sion as a consequence of a reduction in effective population size and loss of genetic diversity (leary et al. 1995; garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1998; ferguson 2007). among native brown_trout (salmo_trutta) populations along the mediterranean, extensive introgressions or even displacements are well documented (garcı´a- marı´n et al. 1998; berrebi et al. 2000; caputo et al. 2004; sanz et al. 2006). in the eastern pyrenees, hatchery introgression in wild populations has been estimated between 1% and 5% per year (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1999a; araguas et al. 2004). this genetic erosion threatens pure native populations localized in several headwater streams (garcı´a-marı´n & pla 1996). recognized as the most serious threat to native brown_trout diversity in this region, the wildlife services involved in the management of these ﬁsheries initiated studies to evaluate the status of wild brown_trout populations and the genetic impact of hatchery releases. beginning in 1997, genetic refuges, where releases of hatchery ﬁsh are banned, have been established in the eastern pyrenees by the autonomous government of catalonia as a management strategy to preserve remaining native gene pools of brown_trout. this paper describes the dynamics of hatchery introgression at 10 selected native brown_trout popu- lations of the eastern pyrenees sampled at four times between 1993 and 2006, a period prior to and during the establishment of genetic refuges in this region. variation is related to stocking histories, harvest management and refuge status and is based on frequencies of the diagnostic allele ldh-c*90 that is ﬁxed in hatchery stocks and absent in native popula- refuge status in tions. we discuss the value of table 1. compiled management and stocking activities in the studied area. management based on genetic refuges stabilizing or preventing introgression, and the chal- lenges in managing and protecting populations where introgression preceded refuge status. material and methods study area and collections ten locations from the main eastern pyrenees river basins (ebre river tributaries, llobregat and ter rivers) were selected to monitor levels of native and hatchery ancestry between 1993 and 2006. these locations have been managed under several options (table 1, fig. 1). six locations are currently in genetic refuge areas and four are from non-refuge regions. refuge and non-refuge locations included ﬁshed and unﬁshed areas. except 1-ter, 7-filia` and 9-cavallers, all the locations maintained their ﬁshed or unﬁshed status during the whole period. the ﬁshed location in the ter river was a catch-and-release area from 1993 to 1997 as was the 9-cavallers since 1994. the 7-filia location varied its ﬁshed–unﬁshed status several times during the period 1993–2006 and was the region having the most recent stocking in 2002. stocking activities in 1-ter, 2-nu´ ria, 3-riutort, 4-pla de boet and 10-conangles ceased before this study started in 1993. intermittent and reduced stocking activities affected 5-cardo´ s, 6-manyanet 7-filia` and 8-cavallers between 1993 and 2002, while 9-cavallers was annually stocked until 2001. neither hardy–weinberg nor gametic disequilibria were noticeable in any of these locations in 1999 based on allozymic variation at 20 polymorphic loci (araguas et al. 2004). among all 39 collections, sample size ranged from ﬁve to 145 specimens (table 2). details for the 1993 and 1999 samples are reported in araguas et al. (2004) and mainly represent the status of wild populations before the genetic refuges were created. collected by elec- troﬁshing during summer, the 2004 and 2006 samples were taken in a minimum river sector of 50 m. the sector was increased in those collections with reduced location management stocking 1. ter 2. nu´ria 3. riutort 4. pla de boet 5. cardo´s 6. manyanet 7. filia` 8. sant nicolau fished* fished unﬁshed unﬁshed catch-and-release fished unﬁshed. fished area in 1995, 1996 and since 2000 fished 9. cavallers 10. conangles fished. catch-and-release since 1994 fished *catch-and-release area between 1993 and 1997. no since 1991 no since 1991 in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1995 suspected upstream releases before 1993 releases 3.5 km downstream from 1999 to 2001 in main river in 1998 and 2001 in main river from 1988 to 1990 and from 2000 to 2002 upstream in 1989–1991 and in main river (1.5 km downstream) in 1997–1999 and 2001 every year until 2001 suspected in main river (250 m downstream) before 1993 genetic refuge since 1997 since 1997 no since 2002 no since 2002 no no since 2002 since 2001 611 araguas et al. table 2. levels of hatchery introgression at 10 pyrenean locations estimated as the ldh-c*90 allele frequency. 1993 1999 2004 2006 1993–2006 fig. 1. geographical locations of brown_trout samples. for sample numbers, refer to table 1. shared areas represent current ‘genetic refuges’. location 1. ter (1997) 2. nu´ria (1997) 3. riutort (nr) 4. pla de boet (2002) 5. cardo´s (nr) 6. manyanet (2002) 7. filia` (nr) 8. sant nicolau (nr) 9. cavallers (2002) 10. conangles (2001) average n 15 28 42 5 25 24 15 28 20 22 ldh-c*90 (se) 0.000 0.000 0.155 (0.039) 0.400 (0.155) 0.040 (0.028) 0.000 0.429 (0.090) 0.179 (0.051) 0.000 0.159 (0.055) 0.136 n 26 24 25 15 25 25 26 25 27 25 ldh-c*90 (se) 0.000 0.000 0.458 (0.070)* 0.567 (0.090) 0.000 0.000 0.519 (0.069) 0.180 (0.054) 0.241 (0.058)* 0.200 (0.056) n 55 71 8 7 38 46 13 16 37 34 0.216 0.206 ldh-c*90 (se) n ldh-c*90 (se) fst 0.000 0.035 (0.015) 0.250 (0.108) 0.714 (0.121) 0.013 (0.013) 0.141 (0.036)* 0.346 (0.093) 0.156 (0.064) 0.284 (0.052) 0.118 (0.039) 65 145 56 ) 71 104 46 43 55 45 0.000 0.021 (0.008) 0.545 (0.047) ) 0.028 (0.011) 0.024 (0.011)* 0.348 (0.050) 0.116 (0.034) 0.264 (0.042) 0.375 (0.051)* 0.191 0.0000 0.0020 0.2686  0.1121à )0.0110 0.0024 0.0262 )0.0017 0.1837  0.0916  year when genetic refuge policy was instituted in each population is given in parentheses. n, sample size; se, standard error. *signiﬁcant genetic change from the preceding collection (p < 0.05).  signiﬁcant fst value (p < 0.05). àfst 1993–2004. sample size. thus, sample size of these 2004 and 2006 collections may reﬂect ﬁsh availability. because of constant reduced sample size in 4-pla de boet, even under intensive 2004 sampling effort, the location was not sampled in 2006. all 2004 and 2006 ﬁsh were anaesthetized with tricaine methanesulphonate (ms- 222) and the adipose ﬁn removed and preserved in ethanol 96% for dna extraction. once recovered from anaesthesia ﬁsh were returned to the streams. specimen’s length ranged between 12 and 20 cm, consistent with age class 1+ and 2+ in iberian rivers (nicola & almodo´var 2002). genetic analyses the genetic effect of hatchery releases was estimated by the frequency of the ldh-c*90 allele, which is ﬁxed in hatchery stocks used to reinforce mediterra- nean brown_trout populations and was absent in wild populations of iberian and north-western mediterra- nean rivers before the hatchery releases (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1991, 1999a,b; martı´nez et al. 1993; berrebi et al. 2000). because of this diagnostic difference, the presence or absence of this marker allele alone has proven valuable in quantitative estimates of exogenous hatchery ancestries in native iberian brown_trout populations (e.g., cagigas et al. 1999) and methods are being developed to score genotypes at this locus quickly and cheaply (chat et al. 2008). sanz et al. (2008) detected a good agreement between the ldh-c*90 frequency and the level of introgression estimated from multiloci approaches. from dna extractions using the chelex-proteinase k procedure (estoup et al. 1996), we identiﬁed genotypes for the 612 diallelic ldh-c* locus using the rflp method described by mcmeel et al. (2001). a ﬂuorescent ldh2f fam-labelled primer was used in 2006 analysis, and after bseli digestion, the pcr-rflp products were genotyped using abi prism 3130 genetic analyser (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). genotypic distributions at each location were tested for conformance to hardy–weinberg expectations by the exact probability test of guo & thompson (1992) incorporated in the computer package genepop ver- sion 3.3 (raymond & rousset 1995). we estimated temporal changes in ldh-c*90 allele frequency as fst values (weir & cockerham 1984) and their signiﬁcance was tested by randomizing genotypes between pairs of samples using fstat version 2.9.3.2 (goudet 1995). results only two of 10 samples collected in 2004 deviated from hardy–weinberg expectations at the ldh-c* locus at the 5% signiﬁcance level (9-cavallers and 10- conangles), but no signiﬁcant deviations occurred at the 1% level. no signiﬁcant deviations were found for 2006 samples. given these observations, and consid- ering the short persistence of released ﬁsh and that stocking activities were mostly carried out before 1999 (table 1), the occurrence of the ldh-c*90 allele in nine of 10 of these locations in 2006 (table 2) is interpreted as representing hybridization between hatchery and native ﬁsh rather than assortative matings of the respective ancestries. clear evidence of recent hatchery introgression was observed at two locations, both designated as refuges in the segre river basin in 2002. in 6-manyanet, a ldh-c*90 frequency of 0.141 contrasted with the allele’s absence in both earlier collections, indicating introgression only since 1999. although the level of introgression decreased in the 2006 collection, stock- ings of hatchery ﬁsh in the main river in 1998 and 2001 (before the genetic refuge was designated) apparently led to introgression of hatchery genes detected in the 2004 screening. introgression occurred before 1999 in 9-cavallers, with the allele absent in 1993, but having frequencies of 0.241 in 1999, 0.284 in 2004 and 0.264 in 2006. despite apparent resistance to earlier intensive stockings (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1998), continued introductions led to introgression here by 1999 (table 2). five locations had substantial introgression in each sampling: 3-riutort, 4-pla de boet, 7-filia, 8-sant nicolau and 10-conangles. the levels of introgression ﬂuctuated substantially in these locations with both extremes in the 2004–2006 collections (4-pla de boet, 0.714 and 8-sant nicolau, 0.116). the difference management based on genetic refuges among sampling years within these locations was signiﬁcant for 3-riutort and 10-conangles. three of these locations (3-riutort, 7-filia` and 8-sant nicolau) are not in a refuge area, in spite of the upstream area in 8-sant nicolau, like 5-cardo´ s, is now in a refuge. although the two refuges (4-pla de boet, 10-conan- gles) have not been ofﬁcially stocked, unofﬁcial stockings before 1993 are suspected in adjacent areas to both locations. three samples are from ﬁshed areas and two (3-riutort and 4-pla de boet) are from unﬁshed; in the latter locations, small sample sizes reﬂected low densities in 2004. discussion the refuge policy, initiated in 1997, established designated sections of some rivers to preserve the native gene pools remaining in wild populations. within each refuge, the previous ﬁshery status in speciﬁc sections is maintained, but releases from hatchery stocks are completely banned. the primary importance of these genetic refuges for conservation is the prohibition of further hatchery releases. this restriction prevents thereby restricting further introgression to those resulting from hatchery ﬁsh or their descendants present when the refuge was established. in addition, although the ﬁshery status has been maintained in refuge areas, the ban on stocking has been accompanied with measures to promote a self-sustaining ﬁshery, with restriction on the number of captures (from 10 to four per angler per day) and on the length of removed ﬁsh (from 19 to 21 cm). introductions, future the complex activities in the eastern pyrenees involving harvest, hatchery stocking and refuge establishment (table 1) present a challenging overall picture for relating data for hatchery introgression from these variables over a 13-year period. six of these areas are presently designated as genetic refuges. except 7-filia` which is currently a ﬁshed area, all locations have maintained their status as ﬁshed or unﬁshed areas since 1993. different patterns of variation were observed regarding the presence and frequency of the ldh-c*90 allele at each of the 10 locations sampled four times over 13 or more years (table 2). during this time, a complete absence of detectable introgression occurred only at 1-ter. both 2-nu´ ria and 5-cardo´ s had absence of introgression in some years and low levels in others. because of limited sample sizes, some hatchery presence is presumed to have remained in both areas throughout the sampling interval; alternatively, introgression in 2-nu´ ria since 1999 cannot be excluded because of its detection in the 2004 and 2006 samples. refuges established at both ter river basin locations remain the least affected by introgression where both areas are 613 araguas et al. ﬁshed. by contrast, the segre river tributary 5-cardo´ s is managed as a catch-and-release ﬁshery and is not a refuge (although such designation now exists upstream from the sampling area). earlier (in 1-ter) or recent downstream (in 5-cardo´ s) stockings appear to have had little or no detectable effect. high levels of introgression were detected in two non-refuge samples, 3-riutort and 7-filia`. in 3-riutort, gametic disequilibrium detected in 1990 was probably a consequence of the lack of random mating between native and hatchery ﬁsh observed in 1988 in this location (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1991). although there are no ofﬁcial records of stocking in 3-riutort before 1990, these authors related the presence of hatchery ﬁsh to the migration of hatchery ﬁsh released in neighbouring areas of this river. however, hardy–weinberg and gametic equilibrium were reached in this location by 1999 (araguas et al. 2004). high levels of introgression were not restricted to non-refuge locations as indicated by the high frequency of the ldh-c*90 allele in 4-pla de boet during the whole period. has the creation of refuges stopped and possibly reversed hatchery introgression in the catalonian pyrenees? overall, the strong footprint of stocking practices could not be erased by the restriction of hatchery releases imposed by the recent genetic refuges policy. the future is not bright for those refuges that remained introgressed (4-pla de boet, 10-conagles) or became introgressed (9-cavallers) during the 13 years of monitoring. in 4-pla de boet, although no signiﬁcant changes have been detected for the ldh-c*90 allele frequency, substantial alter- ation to the genetic background of the population was detected between 1993 and 1999 (araguas et al. 2004) suggesting that other threats compromise the persistence of the native gene pool in this population. the level of introgression in 10-conangles popula- tion appeared to be stable before the declaration of the refuge area in the upper reaches of the noguera ribagorc¸ana river in 2001, but hatchery alleles increased after this declaration as suggested by the tripled frequency of the ldh-c*90 allele in the 2006 collection. an upstream migration of admixed or released hatchery ﬁsh from non-refuge areas appears to be responsible for this alteration. in 9-cavallers, the initial replacement of native genes between 1993 and 1999 sampling persisted either before or after declaration of refuge status in 2002. despite the recreational ﬁsheries these refuges may provide, from a conservation perspective they are failures. once established in an area, such divergent introgression is virtually impossible to eradicate (allendorf et al. 2005). safeguards are mandated to prevent such hybridized populations from spreading and jeopar- dizing the existence of remaining native populations. 614 long-time persistence of ﬁsheries can only be achieved through local reproduction (olver et al. 1995). the brown_trout ﬁshery in eastern pyrenees rivers is recreational, making catch and release areas particularly attractive, and reducing political pressure for hatchery releases. however, refuge designation requires cautious location to avoid the situation observed in 9-cavallers where stocked ﬁsh were protected and are seriously threatening native popula- tions in surrounding river sections (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1998; hitt et al. 2003). leary et al. (1995) suggested the eradication of trout populations with high levels of introgression. however, eradication is premature when data are not available to deﬁne the borders of introgressed populations or the amount of introgres- sion. in 4-pla de boet, a stocked naturalized popula- tion inhabiting an upstream lake may send ﬁsh to the refuge area; this source of exogenous ﬁsh should be removed prior to rehabilitation efforts within the highly introgressed refuge area. in 8-sant nicolau, the stream is not far from a stocked downstream sector in the main river and exogenous ﬁsh are established in a protected area inside a national park (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1998). although initial assortative mating was observed between hatchery and native ﬁsh in 8-sant nicolau, a panmictic admixed unit was detected in 1999 (araguas et al. 2004). here, stopping stocking downstream and the translocation of native stocks to the river segments inhabited by exogenous ﬁsh could be a good option for the restoration of native populations in the whole region (maitland & lyle 1992; maitland 1995; youngson et al. 2003; caudron et al. 2006). stopping stocking and maintaining ﬁsh- ery pressure on 6-manyanet, 7-filia`, 10-conangles may help recovery of native gene pools on those locations. future monitoring will assist evaluation of all these decisions. as a conclusion, our results failed to detect signiﬁcant differences in the level of introgression before and after refuges were established. the stock- ing practices have left a strong footprint in wild populations that resists being erased by any manage- ment strategy. stopping stocking is unquestionable to protect remaining native gene pools, but other mea- sures are also necessary to avoid introgression from hybridized or hatchery populations already estab- lished. in addition, these brown_trout populations are not threats altering its gene pools. apparently, genetic drift altered native gene pools in 1-ter and 2-nuria even in the absence of hatchery releases (araguas et al. 2004). free of other although no encouraging deﬁnitive conclusions can be obtained, some positive comments are warranted. the policy of genetic refuges has con- tained the increasing average introgression occurring in the whole territory between 1993 and 1999 management based on genetic refuges araguas, r.m., sanz, n., pla, c. & garcı´a-marı´n, j.l. 2004. breakdown of the brown_trout evolutionary history due to hybridization between native and cultivated ﬁsh. journal of fish biology 65(suppl. a): 28–37. berrebi, p., poteaux, c., fissier, m. & cattaneo-berrebi, g. 2000. stocking impact and allozyme diversity in brown_trout from mediterranean southern france. journal of fish biology 56: 949–960. brown, c. & day, r.l. 2002. the future of stock enhance- lessons for hatchery practice from conservation ments: biology. fish and fisheries 3: 79–94. cagigas, m.e., vazquez, e., blanco, g. & sanchez, j.a. 1999. genetic effects of introduced hatchery stocks on indigenous brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) populations in spain. ecology of freshwater fish 8: 141–150. caputo, v., giovannotti, m., nisi cerioni, p., caniglia, m.l. & in splendiani, s. 2004. genetic diversity of brown_trout central italy. journal of fish biology 65: 403–418. caudron, a., champigneulle, a. & guyomard, r. 2006. assessment of restocking as a strategy for rehabilitating a native population of brown_trout salmo_trutta l. in a fast- ﬂowing mountain stream in the northern french alps. journal of fish biology 69(suppl. a): 127–139. chat, j., manicki, a. & merchermek, n. 2008. typing for brown_trout ldh-c1* alleles together with microsatel- lites by automated sequencing. conservation genetics: in press. cowx, i.g. 1994. stocking strategies. fisheries management and ecology 1: 15–30. cowx, i.g. 1999. an appraisal of stocking strategies in the light of developing country constraints. fisheries management and ecology 6: 21–34. doadrio, i., perdices, a. & machordom, a. 1996. allozymic variation of the endangered killiﬁsh aphanius iberus and its application to conservation. environmental biology of fishes 45: 259–271. elvira, b. 1996. endangered freshwater ﬁsh of spain. in: kirch-hofer, a. & hefti, d., eds. conservation of endan- gered freshwater ﬁsh in europe. basel: birkha¨user verlag, pp. 55–61. estoup, a., largiadier, c.r., perrot, e. & chourrout, d. 1996. rapid one-tube dna extraction for reliable pcr detection of ﬁsh polymorphic markers and transgenes. molecular marine biology and biotechnology 5: 295–298. ferguson, a. 2007. genetic impacts of stocking on indigenous brown_trout populations. environment agency science report sc040071 ⁄ sr, bristol, 93 pp. isbn 978-1-84432- 798-0. frankham, r. 2005. genetics and extinction. biological conservation 126: 131–140. garcı´a-marı´n, j.l. & pla, c. 1996. origins and relationships of native populations of salmo_trutta (brown_trout) in spain. heredity 77: 313–323. garcı´a-marı´n, j.l., jorde, p.e., ryman, n., utter, f. & pla, c. 1991. management implications of genetic differentiation between native and hatchery populations of brown_trout (salmo_trutta) in spain. aquaculture 95: 235–249. garcı´a-marı´n, j.l., sanz, n. & pla, c. 1998. proportions of native and introduced brown_trout in adjacent ﬁshed and unﬁshed spanish rivers. conservation biology 2: 313– 319. 615 fig. 2. hatchery releases of eggs (in black), parrs (in grey) and adults (in white) of brown_trout carried out by the autonomous government of catalonia (departament de medi ambient i habitatge, generalitat de catalunya, personal communication). (araguas et al. 2004). an overall reduction in hatchery stocking (fig. 2) coincides with the initia- tion of the refuge policy. given this reduction, the low or absent introgression in the ter river basin leads to optimism that these native populations will remain introgression free through the safeguards imposed by the refuges. similarly, the refuge area designated upstream from 5-cardo´s (table 1) appears to be buffered by the low introgression in this non- refuge area, despite downstream stocking in this stream. particularly notable here is that the catch- and-release management maintains a buffer of pre- dominantly native adult ﬁsh that seems to discourage upstream migration and reproduction of hatchery releases in downstream areas. ongoing restrictions on the number of captures and increased length of removed ﬁsh in the eastern pyrenees limit exploita- tion and also contribute to persistence of wild populations. acknowledgements research meets the objectives of this the
