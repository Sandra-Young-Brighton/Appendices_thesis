(1989). the otolith and scale ages of the north- american species coregonus_clupeaformis have been compared by barnes & power (1984). the comparability of age determination results between different countries and laboratories is questionable, especially if different methods like age determination from scales or otoliths are used and the age determination conducted in different laboratories have not been compared with each other. our objective was to test the methods and readers of different laboratories and to find more accurate methods of age determination that could be standardized. we were also interested in the ef- fects of age determination errors on the estimation of age distribution and growth. in order to compare the accuracy of age deter- mination routines, we conducted two different age determination tests. in the first test, the precision of the readings from calcified structures including scale, otolith (sagitta), and opercular bone, was examined. we compared ages determined from the different structures as well as determinations from each structure by different readers. we tried to use structures that would make it difficult to make pre- sumptions of the fish before examining the age de- termination structure. to do this, the calcified structures of three whitefish populations were mix- ed and presented randomly. in contrast, we conducted another test in which the readers could simultaneously examine the scales and otoliths of individual whitefish. the readers were provided with as much information of the fish as possible, except the actual age, before examining the age determination structure. to know how accurate the determinations are, we used a sample of known-age fish. material and methods the first age determination test of whitefish was done separately with scales, otoliths and opercular bones. a sample of 50 whitefish each were taken from a finnish, a norwegian and a swedish white- fish population. three readers, one from each nordic country (a, b, and c), got calcified struc- tures to age, knowing only that the fish had been caught in late summer. the readers got 150 envel- opes with scale impressions (five scales per plate), 150 envelopes with otoliths, of which one had been burned and cracked in median cross section through the nucleus, and 100 envelopes with opercular bones. the technique of burning and breaking the otolith was a modification of the method used by christensen (1 964) and more pre- cisely, power (1 977), except that after burning the otolith was dropped hot into water instead of al- cohol. 26 the scales of the finnish sample had been taken from the area between the tips of the pelvic fins, and the scales of the norwegian and swedish samples from the area between the lateral line and the adipose fin. the opercular bones were from the swedish and finnish populations, and they were read by only one reader. scale and otolith envel- opes were mixed so that readers could not distin- guish the different populations. wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to examine whether differences in age determinations among readers were systematic or random. similarly, the ages determined from scales, otoliths, and opercu- lar bones were compared. the effects of aging on age distributions were examined. the average lengths of the estimated age groups were also studied to see how much the differences in age de- termination affected the mean lengths of the esti- mated age groups. the whitefish used in the second age determi- nation test had been reared in ponds with a natural food supply and tagged with microtags injected into their snouts (jefferts et al. 1963) as one-sum- mer-old fingerlings, so their real ages were known. after tagging they had been released into lake vuokalanjarvi, finland. microtagging of whitefish fingerlings is a common method in finland, and to our knowledge it does not affect the growth of the tagged individuals. the sample of 50 specimens consisted of 1- to 6- year-old individuals (calendar age 1-6), and the 6- year-olds were the largest age group. the scales were taken from the area behind the pelvic fins. all eight readers (a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h) were given information about the fish: date of catch, length, weight, and sex. in each of the 50 envelopes the reader got scale impressions and two otoliths, one of which had been prepared for the determi- nation. first, it had been burned as in the first study and then glued to a piece of plastic plate, covering the otolith completely with epoxy two- component glue. after the glue had hardened, the otolith was ground to get a smooth cross section through the nucleus. there were some differences in the practices of the readers that were revealed in the second age determination test. readers a, c and f did not age-determine all the 50 individuals, because they were of the opinion that it is better to exclude in- distinct individuals than to age them with great un- certainty. there were also unexpected differences in the definition of age. the finns and swedes used “+ ” in marking the marginal growth after the last annulus (“4”, “4( +)” [the parenthesis in sweden if marginal growth was not detected], and “4+” are “4-year-olds” [calendar age from 1 january to 3 1 december]), and a part of the norwegians used table 1. the number of identical readings

day, whereas the others aged the whole material during a shorter continuous period. the ages determined were compared with the real ages of the fish. wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to examine whether the differences were systematic or random. the resulting age distri- butions were compared with the real age distri- bution and the mean lengths of the estimated age- groups were compared with the known mean lengths (t-test). in this article we use the terminology on defi- nition of age presented by bagenal & tesch (1978). results age determination test with mixed samples the first age determination test showed great vari- ation both between readers (table 1) and between structures read by the same reader (table 2). the differences in the age determination varied between the population samples, and systematic differences between the determinations were com- mon. of the norwegian scale sample, the readers b and c got 32 identical readings, but of the oto- liths only three. however, according to the otolith ages, a large part of the norwegian sample con- sisted of old individuals when compared with scales. on the grounds of the thickness of their otoliths and the structure of the rings (cf. power 1978) the otolith ages were considered to be closer to the actual age than scale age, which under-esti- mated the real age (fig. 1). discrepancies among swedish samples were probably also due to inac- curate age determination of scales and opercular bones from older individuals. the finnish whitefish sample consisted of 2- to 6-year-old individuals, and systematic differences in the age determination results such as those found in the norwegian or swedish material did not appear. however, the age determination of the finnish fish was not always accurate. five individ- uals, all 3 years old, had been microtagged before releasing as fingerlings, and so their real age was known. on the average, two of five were aged cor- rectly, and errors were made with all calcified structures: scale (2-4 correct determinations), oto- lith (1-2 correct determinations) and opercular bone (2 correct determinations). the errors with scales and opercular bones were mostly over- estimation, the ages from otoliths were both over- and underestimated. the otolith reading indicated that a large part of the norwegian sample consisted of older than 9- year-old whitefish, whereas the age determination from the scales revealed no individuals of this age (fig. 2). a similar phenomenon was found in the swedish whitefish sample. in addition, reader a determined 2-year-olds to be the youngest age- group in the swedish sample, while the other readers also found yearlings. in the finnish sample a systematic difference was found only in the age determination of the reader c who determined the same fish 2 years old from the scales and 3 or 4 years old from the otoliths (fig. 2). when the average lengths of the estimated age groups were examined in relation to the deter- mined age, the determinations of the swedish ma- terial made from scales or opercular bones showed a faster growth rate than the determinations from otoliths, according to which the population is very table 2. the number of identical readings of scales and otoliths, aged by the same reader (for explanation see table 1) reader statistical test norwegian sample swedish sample

3). the young and old fish in the samples from the finnish and norwegian populations were so much of similar size that it could not be examined whether the differences in the determinations would have caused differences in the estimates of growth rates. however, the de- terminations made from the otoliths of the nor- wegian population showed, despite the differences between the age determination, that the whitefish practically ceased from growing when they reached the length of 32-33 cm. age determination of known-age whitefish in the second comparison, the sample consisting of microtagged whitefish with known ages, the results were better than in the first one; 73-90% (average 82y0) of the determinations were correct. if the non-aged individuals were included as inaccurate determinations (readers a, c and f did not age the most difficult individuals), 7&90% (average 81%) were correct (table 3). the determinations of the reader h (46% correct), who aged 3-5 individ- uals per day, were excluded from these figures. sys- tematic errors were found towards both younger and older age than in reality (table 3). despite a fairly small number of incorrectly age determined fish per reader, inaccuracies affected the age distribution of the fish sample. a bias in the determinations tended to make it diffi- cult to distinguish large and small age groups in the sample, even if more than 80% of the determi- the 28 nations were accurate (fig. 4, table 3). it was nearly impossible to identify the strength of the age groups 3 and 6 in the age distribution of reader a, although 89% of the age determinations were correct. however, only 82% of the fish in the sample were correctly age determined, since reader a did not determine the age of four individuals in the sample. the growth of the fish was not as sensitive to inaccuracies as age distribution. all age determi- nations except the one made by reader h gave a fairly reliable figure of the mean length of each age-group. only the mean length of the estimated age-group 4 by reader h differed statistically sig- nificantly from the real mean length of the 4-year- olds (t-test, p<o.ol). the different practices in marking "+ " growth did not affect the results, because in this case the number of years was interpreted similarly by all readers. discussion the inaccuracies in the age determination of fish in the first test were probably partly due to the different growth of otoliths and scales, especially among older fish for which growth has slowed. when the growth of the scales had practically ceased, the otoliths still continued to grow, this is because scales reflect somatic growth that slows with age, and otoliths reflect temporal change (cf. casselman 1983, beamish & mcfarlane 1995). the results especially from the norwegian white- fish material show that when using only scales, age can be underestimated more than ten years com- pared with otoliths. barnes & power (1984) found similar differences between the scale and otolith reliability of whitefish age determination 40 20 10 n 30 20 10 0 30 20 10 0 40 30 20 10 0 30 20 10 0 30 20 10 0 sweden scales 40 -t noway scales a 10 15 20 5

fig. 4. the real age distribution of the known-age whitefish sample and the age distributions based on the determinations of readers a-h age in years tesch (1978) as one way to improve the reliability of age determination. because of the mixing of the population samples the readers could not calibrate their determi- nations with any checks like growth changes from exceptionally good or bad years or regularly occur- ring false annuli. this may also have been true with reader h in the second study, being able to read the calcified structures of only a few fish per day. although the mixing of population samples may have prevented the readers from getting pre- sumptions of the age and growth of the fish, it did not improve accuracy, but rather caused confusion in the readers. the method of preparing the otoliths for the readers in the first age determination test probably caused difficulties in the interpretations. burning and breaking may give a satisfying cross section with some populations. this study showed, how- ever, that whitefish otoliths may be difficult to read if the otolith is just burned and broken. this is because the cross section will easily have a rough surface. furthermore, the otoliths of especially fast growing whitefish are often so fragile that they break not only laterally but also longitudinally. it is more favorable to stiffen the otolith with wax or glue or corresponding substance and then grind it to get a readable cross section through the nucleus. this is especially important in comparisons where several persons handle the otoliths. only one reader in the first study had experience of whitefish opercular bones and determined ages 32 from them. the annuli of the slow growing swed- ish whitefish were hardly distinguishable. in both of the aged samples, there were difficulties in dis- tinguishing the first annulus, typical for the opercular bone. furthermore, the results showed that, as in age determination from scales, years of slow growth can be missed. on the other hand, the regular form of the opercular bone is an advantage in back-calculation compared with scales. during age determination, a reader inevitably forms an opinion of typical types of annuli for the population and about where to find the annuli most expectedly in the calcified tissue. according to bagenal & tesch (1978), it is important not to know the length of the fish before examining the aging structure, because when knowing the length one is unconsciously tempted to make the visible ring structure fit the age that would be likely for the fish of that length. however, examining the calcified structures alone is enough for presump- tions to be formed, and to an experienced reader the size of the calcified structure of a familiar fish species gives a fairly accurate representation of the fish length. in routine age determination it may be impossible to avoid paying attention to the fish length, consciously or unconsciously. an example of the effects of assumptions on age determination was presented by beamish & mcfarlane (1995). in a time series for pacific hake ages, all but a few age-groups with above average abundance were equally represented and moder- ately abundant in the yearly samples, until it be- came clear that the fish population consisted of a few strong year-classes, occurring every 3rd or 4th year. after getting this knowledge the age distri- butions differed from the earlier ones, and were either accurate or they reflected a bias toward as- signing fish to the known strong year-classes. a similar type of bias seemed to appear in the deter- minations of the readers a, b and c in the second study (fig. 4). our results from the age determination tests suggest that when the reader has more information about the fish, presumptions of growth, and num- ber of annuli, age determinations are more likely to be accurate. nevertheless, it is important for the reader to be conscious that growth patterns can be unexpected or that there can always be individuals in the sample that have grown in an exceptional way. practicing and testing age determination methods with known-age fish raised under natural conditions is recommended. we used naturally raised fish of known ages in our second study. in the study of salojarvi (1989), only 4.6% of 680 whitefish were aged incorrectly from scales. the whitefish of salojarvi’s study had grown faster reliability of whitefish age determination than the individuals in our second study, so they were possibly easier to age. the large sample size allowed readers to become more familiar with the material than in our studies. known-age fish have been used before in the validation of age determi- nation with several fish species, like roach (rutilus rutilus) and dace (leuciscus leuciscus, hofstede 1974), or bream (ahramis brarna) and rudd (scard- inius erythrophthalmus, steinmetz 1974), and they have been recommended by casselman (1987). the second age determination study showed that even if 80% of the individuals are aged accu- rately, an exceptionally strong or weak year-class may remain unidentified due to a bias in the deter- mination. this may cause problems with the re- liability of methods in which age distribution is needed for the calculations, e.g. virtual population analysis, calculation of instantaneous mortality, and calculations of yield per recruit. if individuals that are difficult to determine are excluded from the age determination and thereby from age distribution as well, the error will be smaller than when they are aged incorrectly. how- ever, if their proportion in the sample is large, they may cause a bias in the age distribution despite a high percentage of correctly aged fish. the calculation of growth rate seems to be less sensitive to incorrect age determination than age distribution, and it can be regarded as more re- liable when making conclusions of a small fish population sample. this is also because even a cor- rectly determined age distribution in a fish sample may essentially differ from the age distribution in the population due to sampling error. bagenal & tesch (1978) and casselman (1987) agree that “+” is a symbolic notation signifying growth distal to the last annulus. if this new growth is not detected, “+” should not be used. because of the different practices in marking “+” growth due to different definition of age, in some cases it is possible that the age marked by a reader is misinterpreted by a person from another labora- tory. this example showed how important it is in cooperative studies to agree on the practices that are used. in future comparisons we agreed to use “+” in brackets “(+)”, when the growth of the calendar year (of catch) is not yet discernible in the structures. conclusions the age of slow-growing whitefish should be deter- mined from the cross section of otolith, because years of very slow growth cannot be detected from scales. the chance of correct determination is highest when the reader uses more than one calci- fied structure as well as biological information of

problems with the reliability of methods in which age distribution is needed for calculations. the calculation of growth rate, at least when using the mean lengths of age groups, seemed less sensitive to incorrect age deter- mination than age distribution. 1. empleando dos analisis diferentes, comparamos determina- ciones de edad de coregonus iuvuretus (l.). en el primer anali- sis. varios lectores

fue quemado y cortado. 2. en el primer analisis, la precision de las lecturas fut baja, tanto entre 10s lectores como entre las diferentes estructuras analizadas. en las muestras de poblaciones de crecimiento len- to, 1as determinaciones de edad realizadas sobre otolitos resul- taron en edades mayores de las obtenidas sobre escamas. en el segundo anlilisis, 10s resultados fueron mejores, en un 73-90% (media=82%) de 10s casos las determinaciones de edad fueron correctas. 3. creemos que el uso de dos estructuras calcificadas mas una cierta informacion sobre 10s individuos mejora la precision en la determinacion de las respectivas edades. nuestros resultados no apoyan la idea de que el conocimiento de la longitud u otra informacibn sobre el pez en cuestion dificulta la interpretacion correcta de la edad. muy por el contrario, un cierlo conoci- miento sobre el pez, da a1 lector mayor posibilidad de realizar una correcta determinacion de su edad. 4. es recomendable validar las determinaciones de edad con individuos de edad previamente conocida. menos de un 20% de las dataciones incorrectas o de 10s individuos no datados puede causar problemas de fiabilidad en 10s mttodos en 10s que las dislribuciones de edades son necesarias. calcular la tasa de crecimiento parece menos sensible a dataciones incorrectas que a las distribuciones de edad. acknowledgements a working group of fish researchers from three nordic coun- tries, finland, norway and sweden, has been dealing since 1991 with the questions of the methods used in acidification studies. in order to increase the comparability of the results, the group has considered it important to calibrate the methods used in each country. age determination has been one of the important topics examined in the group that we call the nordic fresh- water fish group (noff). one goal has been to test the accu- racy of age determination of different fish species that live in the fresh waters of the nordic countries and the precision between different readers from different laboratories and countries. the authors got very valuable comments for this text from magnus appelberg, trygve hesthagen, mika kurkilahti, kari nyberg, and the referees. kari nyberg also treated the otoliths and scales of the second study for determination. helena halme edited the text. 34 references bagenal, t.b. & tesch, ew. 1978. age and
