lyons 1996). upstream communities inhabit low species richness and their headwaters, present in structure is largely deﬁned by abiotic factors. contrast, downstream communities are richer in species, dwell in more stable conditions and biotic interactions have a more prominent role in conform- ing their structure (matthews 1998; vila-gispert et al. 2002). between both communities there is an addi- tion and replacement of species which has been described as a continuum without deﬁned boundaries (vannote et al. 1980). however, it has been observed that, along this several longitudinal continuum, discontinuities or faunal breaks represent boundaries or transitions between ecological patches or zones (matthews 1986; naiman et al. 1988; rahel & hubert 1991) corresponding presumably to different ﬁsh communities. for example, in places where there is an abrupt change in altitude, ﬁsh assemblages seem to occur along a longitudinal zonation (matthews 1998). this is the case of west european rivers for which huet (1959) described four zones according to their most representative species: brown_trout, salmo_trutta fario l., grayling, thymallus_thymallus (l.), barbel, barbus barbus (l.) and bream, abramis brama (l.). however, the consideration of only one species as representative of a zone may not be sufﬁcient to provide a relevant characterization of ﬁsh assemblages. we therefore tested: (i) whether ﬁsh assemblages ﬁt huet’s zonation on a large scale (i.e., the whole garonne basin, one of the largest european rivers) and (ii) whether a more comprehensive description of the ﬁsh fauna is needed to identify characteristic assemblages. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00096.x 233 ibarra et al. materials and methods area of study the garonne basin is one of the largest basins in europe comprising 56,536 km2 of catchment area in the south-west of france (fig. 1). the main channel runs over 580 km from the pyrenees to the gironde estuary in the atlantic coast. its main tributaries have their sources in the massif central plateau and the pyrenees range. due to biogeographical reasons, ﬁsh fauna in the garonne basin is poorer than in adjacent basins, including the absence of grayling (persat & keith 1997). although the garonne basin is consid- ered as one of the least impacted by ﬂow regulation in europe and one of the least polluted (etchanchu & probst 1988), it has suffered from intensive damming during the second half of the 20th century (steiger et al. 1998) and the quantity of applied fertiliser has dramatically increased in the past few years (semhi et al. 2000), leading to several concerns on ﬁsh conservation, most notably on diadromous and native species (keith 2000). data data were obtained from the ﬁsh database of the aquatic environment team, school of agronomy at toulouse (ensat) and from the french fisheries council (csp) obtained during collection campaigns between 1986 and 1996, although not sampled at regular intervals. from this database a subset for n france massif central plateau atlantic ocean pyrenées range garonne main channel 234 fig. 1. location of the garonne basin, showing the sampling sites as dots. reﬂect collection the difﬁculties which collection of species richness was the objective of the sampling was chosen. electroﬁshing surveys were made either by wading in shallow areas or by boat in the deeper reaches during low-ﬂow periods (i.e., late summer). in the case of wider and deeper rivers, gill-netting was used in still waters and both gill- and drift-netting for running waters. this combi- nation of methods allows an effective assessment of ﬁsh diversity in rivers (seegert 2000), however, as abundance measures intensity (angermeier & smogor 1995), only presence–absence data were considered in order to remove sampling bias as recommended by hughes & gammon (1987). fish samplings were not made on a year-to-year basis as it implied a high ﬁnancial cost. indeed, many studies assuming large spatial and temporal scales use species presence–absence as the level of data resolution because of in obtaining reliable estimates of relative rank abundance (jackson et al. 2001). for the analyses, it was assumed therefore, a large spatio-temporal scale: a 10-year span as the time unit, and the whole garonne basin as the spatial unit. thus, the time dimension had to be taken aside, pooling all observations together in a similar way as described by sipponen & muotka (1996). moreover, local repeated surveys on some sampling sites showed that both environmental features and ﬁsh assemblages did not dramatically vary along the 10-year sampling period (bengen et al. 1992; mastrorillo 1997; hut- agalung 1998; cattane´o et al. 1999; reyjol 2002; aguilar ibarra 2004; p. lim, unpublished data). we reckoned this database, nevertheless, as a reliable representation of ﬁsh fauna in this area, according to our ﬁeld experience and with the information of ﬁsh atlases (brusle´ & quignard 2001; keith & allardi 2001). the resulting data set contained 109 sampling sites spread over the whole garonne basin (fig. 1), with 40 species belonging to 13 orders and 16 families. cyprinidae was the better represented with 17 species, followed by salmonidae (four) and diversity patterns for riverine ﬁsh percidae (three). data were arranged in a 109 · 40 presence–absence matrix, i.e., sampling sites in rows and species in columns. statistical analysis we applied a kohonen self-organising map (som) which is a nonlinear clustering technique capable of displaying patterns from complex data sets (kohonen 2001). we chose this method because it has proved effective in characterising distribution patterns in ecological analysis with the advantage of representing nonlinear relationships (lek et al. 2000). other con- ventional methods cannot handle outliers and species with low frequency of occurrence (i.e., rare species) contained in many ecological data sets (brosse et al. 2001; giraudel & lek 2001). in fact, we reckon rare to accurately describe beta species as important diversity, playing an important role in the ﬁsh assemblage structure (przybylski 1993), and in the determination of their biological integrity (cao et al. 1998). the som consisted of two layers of nodes, with the input layer directly connected by weight vectors to a two-dimensional output layer (fig. 2). modelling was carried out using the som toolboxó (alhoniemi et al. 2000) for matlabó (the mathworks inc., natick, ma, usa) in a pc platform, and required ﬁve steps. first, the input layer, which may be interpreted as a surrogate of the gamma diversity of the basin (i.e., regional species pool) was fed with the presence– absence matrix. second, the som calculated the connection intensities (i.e., weights) between input and output layers using an unsupervised competitive learning procedure (kohonen 2001) which iteratively looks for clusters in the data, based on their species composition. the connection intensity of the som can be considered as the probability of occurrence of a species at a group of sites, and can be displayed on the som as shades of grey, where the darker the colour, species . . . . . . . . . . . . sp1 x 11 . . . x i1 s e t i s g n i l p m a s spj x1j . . . x ij s1 . . . si n1 n5 n9 n2 n6 n10 n3 n7 n11 n4 n8 n12 species . . . . . . . . . . . . spj p1j . . . p12 j n1 . . . n12 s t i n u t u p t u o sp1 p11 . . . p12 1 input matrix connection weights output units output matrix fig. 2. simpliﬁed representation of the som modelling. the input matrix constitutes the input layer and contains the presence–absence data (i.e., xij). these data are used to train the som by changing the connection weights until a low training error is obtained. an output matrix is then produced with the ﬁnal connection weights (i.e., pij) of each node (i.e., output unit). 235 ibarra et al. the higher the probability (e.g., black means species occurred in >90% of samples) (lek et al. 2000). third, these sites were clustered in each node according to their similarities in species composition (i.e., pooled alpha diversity), resulting in an output matrix, with output nodes in rows and species in columns (fig. 2). the differences between nodes thus represent the beta diversity of the basin. we chose a 12-node som following the results of park et al. (2003a) and gevrey et al. (2004), because it was easier to interpret and because it presented a low training error. in fact, the som was trained with different number of nodes to ﬁnd the optimum map size based on the minimum values of both quantisation and topographic errors which are used to assess classiﬁcation quality (park et al. 2003b; gevrey et al. 2004). fourth, we looked whether there was a signiﬁcant zonation of ﬁsh scientiﬁc name abramis brama (linnaeus, 1758) alburnus alburnus (linnaeus, 1758) alosa alosa (linnaeus, 1758) alosa fallax (lace`pe`de, 1803) anguilla anguilla (linnaeus, 1758) barbatula barbatula (linnaeus, 1758) barbus barbus (linnaeus, 1758) blennius ﬂuviatilis asso, 1801 blicca bjoerkna (linnaeus, 1758) carassius sp. chondrostoma toxostoma (vallot, 1837) cottus gobio linnaeus, 1758 cyprinus carpio linnaeus, 1758 esox lucius linnaeus, 1758 gambusia afﬁnis (baird & girard, 1853) gasterosteus aculeatus linnaeus, 1758 gobio gobio (linnaeus, 1758) gymnocephalus cernua (linnaeus, 1758) ictalurus melas (raﬁnesque, 1820) lampetra planeri (bloch, 1784) lepomis gibbosus (linnaeus, 1758) leuciscus cephalus (linnaeus, 1758) leuciscus leuciscus (linnaeus, 1758) micropterus salmoides (lace´pe`de, 1802) mugil cephalus linnaeus, 1758 oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum, 1792) pachychilon pictum (heckel & kner, 1858) perca ﬂuviatilis (linnaeus, 1758) petromyzon marinus linnaeus, 1758 phoxinus phoxinus (linnaeus, 1758) platichthys ﬂesus (linnaeus, 1758) pseudorasbora parva (temminck & schlegel, 1842) rhodeus sericeus (pallas, 1776) rutilus rutilus (linnaeus, 1758) salmo_salar linnaeus, 1758 salmo_trutta fario linnaeus, 1758 salmo_trutta trutta linnaeus, 1758 scardinius erythrophthalmus (linnaeus, 1758) stizostedion lucioperca (linnaeus, 1758) tinca tinca (linnaeus, 1758) common name common bream bleak allis shad twaite shad eel stone loach barbel freshwater blenny white bream silver carp toxostome bullhead sculpin common carp pike mosquito ﬁsh three-spined stickelback gudgeon ruffe black bullhead brook lamprey pumpkinseed chub dace black bass lisa rainbow trout albanian roach perch sea lamprey minnow european ﬂounder top mouth gudgeon bitterling roach atlantic salmon brown_trout sea_trout rudd pikeperch tench roman numerals indicate the four huet’s zones. u, upstream; d, downstream. 236 assemblages by performing (i) a cluster analysis (ward’s method with chebychev distance metric) with the new matrix (12 · 40, nodes · species) esti- mated by the som, and (ii) a duncan’s multiple comparison test for species richness in each assem- blage, producing boxplots. fifth, the clustered groups were displayed in geographical maps to view the spatial distribution of ﬁsh assemblages. both the input and the output matrices are available upon request from the authors. results sampling sites were classiﬁed by the som according to their species composition in the 12 output nodes, so that each node included sites with similar ﬁsh fauna. hence, each species has a probability of occurrence in u i ii d iii iv table 1. list in alphabetical order of ﬁsh species with a mean probability of occurrence >0.50 in at least a som node. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * diversity patterns for riverine ﬁsh each node, even when it was not found in sampling surveys (table 1). the assumption behind is that local assemblages are unsaturated and might be colonised by potential species which have the same ecophysi- ological features as those present in local assemblages. this similarity brought about a counter-clockwise arrangement of nodes within the som showing a longitudinal gradient, which becomes evident when looking at the som and its geographical correspon- dence. as an example, we show some of the most common species in the basin, bleak, alburnus alburnus (l.), chub, leuciscus cephalus (l.), minnow, phoxinus phoxinus (l.), brown_trout, and of two ‘rare’ species – bullhead sculpin, cottus gobio l. and allis shad, alosa alosa (l.)

indicating that its popula- tions dwell in oxygen-rich waters in the highlands. salmo_trutta has a wider distribution: from mountain streams, where it shares its habitat with c. gobio, down to upper piedmont rivers where it is mostly associated to p. phoxinus. in contrast, l. cephalus and a. alburnus, are more frequent and widespread, being distributed in warmer waters of the lower piedmont and the plains. finally, a. alosa, a marine species, remained in large rivers and estuary-inﬂuenced sites, clustered by the som into node n12. the cluster analysis applied to the output matrix with the connection weights of each species resulted in the dendrogram of fig. 4. the number of groups of clusters in a dendrogram is commonly left to the analyst in order to look at the largest linkage distances (everitt & dunn 1991). at a linkage distance of c. 0.5, four groups become evident: one comprised the sites at the highest altitudes (n5, n6, n9, n10), the second included those broadly

were statistically different (p < 0.05, duncan’s multiple comparison test) in species richness composition (fig. 5). both distance to the source and species richness showed a positive relationship and a gradual increment along the river proﬁle (fig. 6), consistent with the counter-clockwise arrangement of the som. combining, on the one hand, information on the species assemblages provi- ded by the 40 som maps representing probability of occurence of the 40 species in each map cell (as exempliﬁed for six species in fig. 3), and on the other hand, results on the different clusters displayed on the som map of the sites (fig. 4), we obtained a general view of the upstream–downstream organisation of ﬁsh assemblages, as synthesised in table 1. discussion the spatial distribution of the sampling sites followed an upstream–downstream pattern and ﬁsh assemblages broadly matched the physiography of the landscape. however, there were few exceptions or ‘atypical’ sites in our analysis which did not correspond to the classical longitudinal proﬁle. for example, some rare sites (three sites) were identiﬁed as downstream sites by their species assemblage, but were geographically located upstream (fig. 4). this may be the result of human disturbances, such as agriculture, increasing nutrient load (rahel & hubert 1991; harding et al. 1998), or urbanisation and ﬂow regulation inducing higher water temperatures and creating lotic–lentic environments along a river (ward & stanford 1983). both the temporal variability of ﬁsh assemblages (oberdorff et al. 2001) and the location of sampling sites in the basin (osborne et al. 1992; osborne & wiley 1992) are other sources of community change that may explain atypical sites clustering. however, these sites were scarce and hardly inﬂuenced our analyses. in the same way, as the sampling occurred at different time might be covarying with space in our data set (oberdorff et al. times in different sites, diversity patterns for riverine ﬁsh 2001; ostrand & wilde 2002). however, no drastic changes in ﬁsh composition have been recorded in the garonne river basin, at least since the 1980s (bengen et al. 1992; hutagalung 1998). therefore, the combi- nation of samples gathered during several years would not bias our analysis. nevertheless, some local anthropic disturbances may have modiﬁed the relative abundance of some species in some sites. hence, samples collected by different sampling teams and during different seasons, can provide varied abun- dance patterns for each species. however, the species composition did not vary, as testiﬁed by the results obtained in sites where repeated sampling was performed (bengen et al. 1992; mastrorillo 1997; hutagalung 1998; cattane´o et al. 1999; reyjol 2002; aguilar ibarra 2004; p. lim, unpublished data). in this way, the use of presence–absence data, although implying a substantial loss of information compared with abundance data, ensures a relevant consideration of all the sampling sites, whatever their sampling date. we can therefore interpret the dendrogram of fig. 4 as a general conceptual framework of nested patterns of diversity of riverine ﬁsh within a large basin. hence, two main assemblages were distinguished at a linkage distance of c. 1.0: an upstream community and a downstream community. this upstream–downstream pattern has been observed elsewhere, although on smaller scales (schlosser 1982, 1987; zalewski et al. 1990; oberdorff et al. 1993; lyons 1996; matthews 1998; ostrand & wilde 2002). the upstream commu- nity would be exposed to higher environmental variability and would present lower species richness than the downstream community (schlosser 1987; jackson et al. 2001). indeed, ﬁsh species richness increased along with distance to the source (fig. 6). we observed in our data that upstream communities were characterised by trout populations and trout- associated species loach), whereas in downstream areas, these populations had a low probability of occurrence, giving place instead to warm water ﬁsh like cyprinids (e.g., bleak, common bream), several piscivores (e.g., perch, pike), and some estuarine species (e.g., shads) (table 1). fish assemblages from both ends seem to be dissimilar in species composition but assemblages located in between might represent an ecological boundary or a gradual transition of species (naiman et al. 1988), suggesting an overlapping of communities in the form of a two-step transition zone. indeed, as deﬁned by paller (1994) a transitional zone results from an overlapping of upstream and downstream species. such longitudinal the upstream–midstream–downstream framework of sch- losser (1987) proposed for small headwater streams in illinois. it also parallels lyons (1989, 1996) results, mentioning in wisconsin (e.g., minnow, transitional transition of species ﬁts stone a effect 239 ibarra et al. where groups of species were segregated along a ﬁsh- environment gradient, from cold-water to warm-water streams. the four assemblages found in this study may also be coupled to the zones of huet (1959), as rahel & hubert (1991) suggested that both the grayling and barbel zones would represent a transition between the trout and the bream zones. although grayling is not a native species in the garonne basin, ﬁsh often associated to it like brown_trout, stone loach, gudgeon, and minnow (mastrorillo et al. 1998; reyjol et al. 2001) do correspond to our assemblage ii (table 1). this may indicate that ﬁsh assemblages are too complex to be identiﬁed with a single species. indeed, as demonstrated by marsh-matthews & matthews (2000), a numerically dominant species does not always control ﬁsh assemblage structure. these results imply that ﬁsh zonation in large basins, with a diversity of habitats ranging from mountains to coastal plains, is part of a series of nested patterns of diversity, aggregated hierarchically. we suggest, there- fore, that gradual changes in species, ﬁsh zonation and an upstream–downstream shift in communities might be part of the same ecological process inﬂuencing ﬁsh assemblages on different spatial scales (naiman et al. 1988; tonn 1990; rahel & hubert 1991; jackson et al. 2001). in that way, the discrepancies in the analysis of longitudinal patterns of ﬁsh communities in streams have been basically a matter of local conditions (balon & steward 1983; matthews 1998) and of conceptual perception. moreover, ﬁsh assemblages are too com- plex to be identiﬁed with a single species, as commonly used in the huet (1959) classiﬁcation. finally, in this paper we have only dealt with general long-term aspects of ﬁsh species distribution and assemblages composition in the upstream–down- stream longitudinal proﬁle. this evidence of nested patterns was probably facilitated by a simple ﬁsh fauna in this region, and by the basin-scale approach we used. instructive results would be obtained by analy- sing time-series of density and biomass estimates, and incorporating ecological traits or guilds of species in further analyses. resumen 1. investigamos la distribucio´ n longitudinal de grupos de peces a trave´s una
