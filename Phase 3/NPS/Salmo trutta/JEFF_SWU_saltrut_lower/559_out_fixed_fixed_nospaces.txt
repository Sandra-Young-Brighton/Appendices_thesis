(2002). we examined the hypothesis that the ecologically similar exotic salmonids contribute to the lack of success in re-introducing atlantic salmon to lake ontario. previously, scott et al. (2003) demonstrated that adult chinook salmon (o. tshawytscha) have negative effects on adult atlantic salmon during spawning, causing increased levels of agonistic beha- viour, delayed spawning and reduced postspawning survival. however, mathematical modelling suggests that this inﬂuence by itself is not likely to inhibit establishment of a self-sustaining population (wilson 2003; r.j. scott, unpublished data). both models suggest the most sensitive period of atlantic salmon life-cycle to mortality is the early life stages, including the period of juvenile in-stream foraging. jones & stanﬁeld (1993) found that removal of all exotic salmonids from several experimental enclosures resulted in increased juvenile atlantic salmon growth and survival. whereas the mechanism of this effect is reasonably well known for rainbow trout (competition for foraging sites; volpe et al. 2001) it is unknown for the other exotic salmonids present in lake ontario tributaries. that we examined the mechanisms of effect between juvenile atlantic salmon and other salmonids. specif- ically, we predicted that the exotic salmonids would have negative effects on social interactions and foraging success by juvenile atlantic salmon. we tested these predictions in competition trials involving atlantic salmon, chinook salmon and brown_trout in an artiﬁcial stream. methods species et al. (e.g., harwood with juvenile atlantic salmon. additionally, we could ﬁnd no published research on interactions between atlantic and chinook salmon juveniles. secondly, brown_trout and atlantic salmon have a long history of sympatry in europe and there is a substantial body of published research examining interactions between them there 2001,2002; armstrong et al. 2003). however, brown_trout and atlantic salmon did not overlap historically in north america. consequently, atlantic salmon niche breadth may be broader in north america than in europe (because of competitive release) and therefore the potential for interaction with brown_trout may be greater. we did not include coho salmon in our study because coho salmon stocking in lake ontario has declined substantially during the past decade (craw- ford 2001). we did not include rainbow trout because there are numerous studies of atlantic salmon– rainbow trout interactions (e.g., hearn & kynard 1986; jones & stanﬁeld 1993; volpe et al. 2001). all ﬁsh used in this study were raised in ontario ministry of natural resources fish culture stations for their salmonid stocking programmes. the ﬁsh that we observed were representative (e.g., culture history, age, size) of those stocked in the streams during the spring and summer in ontario, canada (see table 1). competitive outcome in salmonids is often size dependent and most studies attempt to control for this effect by using similar-sized ﬁsh. however, atlantic salmon juveniles released into lake ontario tributaries are smaller than the chinook salmon and brown_trout juveniles released into the same tributaries. we felt that we could better represent the present situation by using juveniles that were representative of those released in the stocking programme. experimental procedure we obtained all ﬁsh in the early spring and held in 800 l ﬂow-through tanks at 11 °c and 12:12 h light:dark cycle and fed them ad lib (transition diet; martin mills inc., elmira, on, canada). we set aside a random set of ﬁsh each day and deprived them of food for 24 h to ensure feeding motivation (cutts et al. 2002). these ﬁsh were transferred to an artiﬁcial we examined the effects of chinook salmon and brown_trout on atlantic salmon. we chose these particular species for several reasons. first, chinook salmon is the most abundantly stocked exotic salmonid in lake ontario (crawford 2001). although juveniles of this species migrate from riverine to lacustrine habitat earlier than those of other exotic salmonids (some of which do not migrate at all), there is ample temporal and spatial overlap during which they may interact table 1. size of ﬁsh (fork length, mm) used in each of the experimental treatments. values are mean ± standard deviation.

treatments 10 times. data analysis we used one-way anova (sokal & rohlf 1995) to test for effects of our treatments on total rate (number per 20 min) of interactions involving atlantic salmon (i.e., interactions involving two atlantic salmon plus those involving one atlantic salmon and one member of the other species present). one-way anova was also used to test for effects of our treatments on interactions (number per 20 min) involving pairs of atlantic salmon. we used manova followed by univariate analyses to test for effects of other species present on different aspects of atlantic salmon interactions (quinn & keough 2002). speciﬁcally, we tested whether the overall effect on atlantic salmon interac- tion rate was the result of increased interactions among atlantic salmon or if it was a result of interactions with the heterospeciﬁc individuals and ﬁnally, whether it was a result of atlantic salmon initiated or other species initiated interactions. probability of type i error was adjusted to account for multiple tests (quinn & keough 2002). we randomly selected atlantic salmon for our trials and in doing so we introduced size variation that could inﬂuence foraging success. for example, larger juvenile salmonids are typically better at monopolizing resources (such as food and space) than smaller individuals (o’conner et al. 2000). we used ancova to examine the effects of treatment and atlantic salmon size (fork length; covariate) on dry gut content mass (rawlings 1988) simultaneously. fork length and dry gut mass were both log-transformed to linearize the relationship between the variables prior to analysis. results behaviour there was a signiﬁcant effect of the treatments on the total rate of agonistic interaction involving atlantic salmon (fig. 2, top panel; f3,36 ¼ 13.72, p > 0.001) and this appears to be the effect of interactions with the other species present as there was no effect of the treatments on interaction rate between atlantic salmon (fig. 2, bottom panel; f3,36 ¼ 0.565, p ¼ 0.642). manova suggests that the group centroids are different among the treatments (fig. 2, bottom panel; wilk’s k3,16 ¼ 0.495; p > 0.009) and subsequent univariate tests of differences among treatments in the direction of interaction suggests that atlantic salmon direct equal amounts of agonistic behaviour toward chinook and brown_trout (f1,18 ¼ 0.679; padjusted ¼ 0.841), 285 fig. 1. overhead view of the artiﬁcial stream used in the competition experiment (modiﬁed from grand 1997). the stream measured 0.5 m wide · 1.9 m long by 0.5 m high and was constructed

food items (larval trichoptera and epheme- roptera collected from a local river) in a 4 l container ﬁlled with freshwater. the container was elevated 30 cm above the water surface and a siphon (tygon tubing) drained all to the stream over 20 min. a stir-plate kept the food items suspended so that individual food items were intro- duced into the stream through the siphon in a random manner. the water from the pail we made continuous recordings of conspeciﬁc and heterospeciﬁc agonistic interactions (charge, chase, bite, frontal display and lateral display). at the end of each trial, we removed all ﬁsh from the artiﬁcial stream, killed them with an over-dose of anaesthetic (40–60 ppm clove oil) and preserved them in 10% formalin. later, we measured each ﬁsh (fork length), removed its gut contents and dried them to a constant mass at 55 °c. experimental design the total bottom area of our stream tank available for use by the ﬁsh was 0.95 m2 so there was enough room for three to four feeding territories (keeley & grant (1995) for 45.4 mm fork length atlantic salmon). therefore, we used four atlantic salmon in our baseline treatment. in each additional treatment we added four more atlantic salmon (density control), chinook salmon or brown_trout for a total of four treatments, (i) four atlantic salmon, (ii) eight atlantic salmon, (iii) four atlantic salmon plus four chinook

our study clearly demonstrate that both brown_trout and chinook salmon have an effect on the behaviour of atlantic salmon in an artiﬁcial stream. more importantly, this study demonstrates the mech- anisms of those effects; brown_trout and chinook salmon inﬂuence juvenile atlantic salmon agonistic behaviour but neither appears to have an effect on foraging success under laboratory stream conditions. atlantic salmon agonistic behaviour and foraging success typically reﬂect an optimal trade-off between the site-speciﬁc costs and beneﬁts of holding a feeding territory such that net energy gain is maximized (keeley & grant 1995,1997). therefore, changes in agonistic behaviour without a subsequent change in foraging success could reduce an individual’s net energy gain and long-term growth if those effects occur frequently and persistently in nature. for example, both species in our study caused a dramatic increase in agonistic behaviour (and thus elevated activity) by juvenile atlantic salmon but had no effect on their foraging success. therefore, both exotic species could cause increase in energy expenditure in the wild and subsequently reduce early growth in juvenile atlantic salmon. early growth is critical to survival and reproduction for salmon (metcalfe & monaghan 2001). smaller juvenile atlantic salmon have lower overwinter survival than larger ones (jensen & johnsen 1984) and they tend to grow more slowly (huntingford & de leaniz 1997; cutts et al. 1998; o’conner et al. 2000). as chinook salmon emigrate from riverine habitat during their ﬁrst summer, there is an opportunity for atlantic salmon to recover growth after the chinook salmon leave but prior to their ﬁrst winter. for example, morgan & metcalfe (2001) showed that although ﬁsh deprived of food early grew slower than fed ﬁsh, they did catch up o. tschwaytscha and s. trutta, on juvenile atlantic salmon behaviour in size once they were allowed to feed again. despite this, the nonfed ﬁsh were still smaller than their fed counterparts following the winter. so, the effect of slow growth early is likely to persist beyond the initial year (metcalfe & monaghan 2001). additionally, slow growing juveniles smolt at a smaller size and mature older at a larger size than fast growing juveniles (hutchings & jones 1998; jonsson et al. 2001). although maturing at a large size may seem to be beneﬁcial as larger ﬁsh tend to produce more and larger gametes, in the case of atlantic salmon in lake ontario it may be a detriment because larger atlantic salmon spawn earliest in a spawning season. spawn- ing earlier would increase the temporal overlap of spawning atlantic salmon with spawning chinook salmon (see scott et al. 2003) and thus increase the period of net energy loss for atlantic salmon. exotic species have affected re-introduction of a number of species across a broad range of taxa, including many salmonid populations (e.g., harig et al. 2000; levin et al. 2002). understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for the effect of exotics on native species to making decisions regarding re-introduction efforts (caughley & gunn 1996). our results clearly show that the effects of interspeciﬁc interactions in these juvenile salmonids can be signiﬁcant. our results suggest that attempts to re-introduce atlantic salmon to lake ontario streams may be difﬁcult if brown_trout or chinook salmon are present in those streams. is critical furthermore, our results emphasize the potential devastating effect that exotic paciﬁc salmonids may have on declining and imperiled native populations of atlantic salmon on the atlantic coast of north america. there exists no physical barrier to range expansion by these exotics from the great lakes to the atlantic coastal region (hickey 2002). on the con- trary, the design of our experiment does not allow inferences regarding the effect of atlantic salmon on the exotics that we studied. therefore, using our results to predict the effect or success of atlantic salmon that are invading the west coast of north america would not be prudent. finally, we have shown clear effects of two exotic species in lake ontario on atlantic salmon in an artiﬁcial stream and discussed their relevance to natural streams. however, it is clear that our conclusions must be validated in a natural setting. resumen 1.
