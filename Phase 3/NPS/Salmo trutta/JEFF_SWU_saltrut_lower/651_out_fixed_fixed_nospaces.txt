brown_trout; survival; temperature; incubation introduction parent–offspring conﬂicts (trivers 1974) have been extensively studied and represent one of the most productive frameworks in evolutionary biology (zeh & zeh 2001; janzen & warner 2009). propagule size is often a result of maternal investment and, accord- ingly, is both a maternal and offspring life history trait (bernardo 1996). famous optimality models have focused on this trait (smith & fretwell 1974; parker & begon 1986; sargent et al. 1987; mcginley 1989; levitan 2000) in an effort to identify the selec- tive forces shaping egg size evolution. offspring ﬁt- ness has been found to depend mainly on propagule size in a wide diversity of organisms, including plants (akinci et al. 2008), ﬁsh (bagenal 1969; hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 2000; heath et al. 2003), insects (fox & mousseau 1996) and birds (smith & bruun 1998). the generally supported hypothesis can be summed up in the ‘bigger is better’ mantra: individual ﬁtness curves are expected to be monotonously increasing with propagule size (smith & fretwell 1974; mcginley et al. 1987; sargent et al. 1987), although exceptions have been found, for example when the egg size maximising ﬁtness is dif- ferent between two subsequent life stages (hendry et al. 2001; martinez et al. 2007) or when different selective pressures favour different optima (e.g., large seeds favour germination success but are preferred by predators, gomez 2004). maternal ﬁtness is approxi- mated by the product of mean offspring ﬁtness by maternal fecundity. because the gain of offspring ﬁt- ness with increasing egg size is theoretically expected to reach an asymptote, mothers tend to gain propor- tionally less and less ﬁtness per offspring for a given positive increment in mean egg size. the evolution of egg size is therefore thought to be mainly con- trolled by this partial conﬂict between mother and offspring. this leads to a trivial single evolutionary solution for egg size, provided that ﬁtness curves are invariable within a population. empirical support is rather scarce, and only few studies have investigated correspondence: t. regnier, inra-umr ecobiop, p^ole d’hydrobiologie inra, 64310 saint pee sur nivelle, france. e-mail: tho.regnier@gmail.com doi: 10.1111/eff.12018 169 regnier et al. and acknowledged this hypothesis so far (einum & fleming 2000; heath et al. 2003; janzen & warner 2009). however, it has also been suggested that environ- mental variations can nuance these expectations (parker & begon 1986; mcginley 1989; einum & fleming 2000, 2002; hendry & day 2003). in par- ticular, such models do not explain the maintenance of large variation in egg size between females within a population (bernardo 1996), although models pre- dicting variable maternal investment are available (parker & begon 1986; mcginley 1989; hendry et al. 2001; hendry & day 2003). in natural popula- tions, the quality of the incubation environment pro- vided by the female can be variable and may select for different egg sizes. in this case, the evolutionary solutions for adaptive egg size may be female spe- ciﬁc and might therefore help to explain the observed variability in egg size within a population (bernardo 1996). salmonids are emblematic taxa for the study of this evolutionary dilemma (hendry & stearns 2004). these species typically produce a great number of eggs that are buried in nests (‘redds’) during the ﬁrst part of their development. egg size is known to be variable among salmonid populations (jonsson & jonsson 1999) and within populations (einum & fleming 2000; berg et al. 2001; heath et al. 2003). while female may produce eggs of variable sizes (gregersen et al. 2009), most variability observed within a population is attributable to egg size varia- tion among females (berg et al. 2001). spawning site may be variable among females, in terms of physical habitat, and such environmental variation may affect offspring growth and survival. indeed, females bury their eggs at different depths (devries 1997), at vari- able distances from a groundwater resurgence area (blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1997; garrett et al. 1998) and in area with or without vegetation cover. such variations in incubation environment for offspring may have distinct causes: variations in female prefer- ence for spawning ground characteristics, or, the result of competition for spawning grounds with sub- ordinate females being displaced to less favourable incubation sites. such variations in incubation envi- ronments may inﬂuence the amount of oxygen in the surrounding of eggs (van den berghe & gross 1989) but also the temperature within a particular redd (acornley 1999), and such variable selective pressures may maintain egg size variations in salmo- nid populations. in their study, einum & fleming (2000) demon- strate that individuals originating from large eggs have enhanced growth and survival after emergence from the redd. another study by heath et al. (2003) also revealed that juveniles originating from large 170 tshawytscha). these eggs survived to the onset of exogenous feeding at a higher rate than conspeciﬁcs from small eggs in standard hatchery conditions for chinook salmon (oncorhynchus two studies predict a single optimal investment maximising maternal ﬁtness in the considered populations (einum & fleming 2000; heath et al. 2003). however, few studies have considered the importance of incubation environment heterogeneity on the maintenance of egg size variations within wild populations. few studies have considered the inﬂuence of incubation environ- ment on the relationship between egg size and sur- vival. these studies investigated the inﬂuence of oxygen availability on survival following the hypoth- esis that with a smaller surface-to-volume ratio, the survival of large eggs may be impeded in low oxygen environments (krogh 1959). more recent studies report either a survival advantage for large eggs (einum et al. 2002; rombough 2007) or small eggs (acolas 2008, unpublished) at low oxygen levels. therefore, the inﬂuence of factors other than dis- solved oxygen, such as temperature, has received little attention (teletchea et al. 2009; burt et al. 2011 for a review). we believe that such variation in incu- bation environments deserves attention to better understand egg size evolution, simply because all mechanisms involved in the maintenance of variation are of prime interest for evolutionary biology. to consider the question of within-population variation in egg size, we raised brown_trout (salmo_trutta) progenies in three different temperature condi- tions. we measured individual egg size and tracked survival up to the end of endogenous feeding. we also measured individual metabolic rate (mr) after hatching, because (i) mr is dependent on tempera- ture and can be limiting for survival at high tempera- ture, (ii) mr is linked to body size, (iii) mr is increasing dramatically at that stage, and (iv) mr is also under maternal inﬂuence and seems to be related to maternal investment in brown_trout (regnier et al. 2010, 2012). mr could therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on ﬁtness. survival was then analysed with special interest in the inﬂuence of egg size variations among females, incubation environment and mr on offspring survival throughout incubation. the results are discussed with regard to the evolution of egg size in natural populations with a special focus on within- population variability as a response to the variability of spawning grounds. materials and methods brown_trout eggs originated from twelve females and were fertilised by four males caught on the 8 decem- ber 2008 in the bertiz, a tributary of the bidassoa river (spain) (n: 43.161, w:  1.609). from 15 maternal investment and offspring survival in brown_trout december to 15 march (incubation period), the mean water temperature in the river was 8.7 °c. parents were selected after age (determined from scales), size and mass measurements (table 1). eggs were hand- stripped and fertilised using sperm from four males mixed with diluent [acti-ﬁsh (10x)]. eggs were then incubated in ﬁsh hatcheries until 745 degree days (median date of emergence observed for individuals originating from the same population, t. regnier 2011, unpublished) in three different rearing condi- tions. an additional sample of thirty unfertilised eggs per female was kept to measure egg size (fresh and dry mass). incubation conditions eggs were individually weighed (0.001 g) within 10 h following fertilisation, and 16 eggs from each female were introduced in each rearing condition (192 eggs for each treatment in total). the three treat- ments consisted of different rearing temperatures: a cold condition 6 °c (0.4), a medium condition 10 °c (0.1), considered to be the reference temper- ature for incubation in the source population, and a warm condition 14.5 °c (0.5). this temperature range was established on the basis of previous work on the thermal sensitivity of brown_trout embryos and larvae (elliott 1994; ojanguren & bra~na 2003). each hatchery consisted of a plastic tank in which water was aerated (oxygen level was kept at satura- tion) and circulated by an electric pump (after uv sterilisation) to ensure temperature homogeneity and oxygen supply in the whole tank. temperature in the incubation room was maintained at 10 °c, and water temperature was regulated using an electronic thermostat connected to a chilling device and an aquarium heater. water ﬂow passed through a throughout perforated plate on which perforated 12-well tissue culture plates (bd falcon) were disposed. each egg was distributed in a randomly designated well. water ﬂow was mechanically reduced to avoid disturbances around the eggs. each well of the culture plates con- tained one egg and its development was followed from fertilisation to the expected onset of emergence (estimated at 745 degree days). embryos and larvae were maintained under dim light the experiment, and survival was followed each day. dead embryos and larvae were removed to prevent pathogen transfer to neighbouring individuals. at the end of experiment, surviving alevins were collected at the age of 745 degree days, killed with lethal anaesthetic and measured for size and fresh mass (0.0001 g). then, they were dried for 24 h at 60 ° c and placed 24 h in desiccators over silica gel until constant mass. dry mass of alevins was measured to  5 g. an additional sample of 48 the nearest 10 embryos (four half-sib eggs per female) was intro- duced in each of the three incubation conditions (144 individuals in total) to measure routine metabolic rate on the day of hatching. measures of routine metabolic rate see details (loligo systems, denmark, the 144 selected individuals were transferred to res- pirometry chambers of an intermittent ﬂow respirom- eter in regnier et al. 2010, 2012) on the day of hatching. oxygen consumption was measured on individual larvae for 24 h at the temperature corresponding to their incubation condition. only the last 3 h was kept for analysis as the preceding 21 h was assumed to be acclimatisation. mr was expressed in mm3 o2 con- sumed by an individual per hour (mm3h  1). after rmr measures, individual larvae were anaesthetised and measured for size (length) and mass (fresh and dry mass). table 1. life history traits of female used as genitors. statistical analysis female fork length (mm) 236 260 254 264 292 249 280 312 274 362 326 500 id 1 2 3 4

log-transformed female somatic mass f1,10 = 23.52, p < 0.0001). the egg size–fecundity trade-off was statistically signiﬁcant, but close to the 5% threshold (r² = 0.15, f1,25 = 4.49, p = 0.04). to summarise, egg mass and its variability were posi- tively related to female size and seemed to be, at least in part, traded-off against female fecundity. metabolism at hatching size at hatching was signiﬁcantly different between (r² = 0.37, f2,120 = 34.94, incubation conditions p < 0.0001), with length being negatively related to incubation temperatures (16.7  0.8 mm at 6 °c, 16.3  0.6 mm at 10 °c and 15.3  0.9 mm at 14.5 °c). no signiﬁcant differences in larval mass were found across treatments. metabolic rate measured within 4 days following hatching was different across the three treatments (r² = 0.21, f2,120 = 16.3, p < 0.0001), with meta- bolic rate increasing with incubation temperature (0.22  0.07 calday  1 at 6 °c, 0.36  0.06 at 10 °c and 0.5  0.35 at 14.5 °c). metabolic rate was found to be related to larval mass (body and yolk) at both 6 °c and 10 °c according to the relationship r = amb (fig. 1), whereas at 14.5 °c, no relationship fig. 1. relationship

experiment was positively correlated with initial egg mass (appendix s1). indi- viduals achieved higher growth at 10 °c except those originating from the smallest eggs, which achieved a better growth at 6 °c. mortality was low at low and medium incubation temperatures with only 12 deaths at 6 °c (6.25%) and 8 at 10 °c (4.17%), but higher at 14.5 °c with 59 deaths (30.73%) regardless of family effects. the best model describing survival during incubation accounted for signiﬁcant effects of initial egg mass similar for all incubation conditions (no signiﬁcant interaction between treatment type and egg mass) and treatment-speciﬁc intercepts; all these parameters included female effects (dic = 394.7, table 2). the relationship between survival probabil- ity and egg size is a decreasing function of egg size as the slope parameter was negative for all females (female-speciﬁc slope parameter, a0k, between  2.35 and  1.17). this slope parameter was steeper in progenies characterised by a high mass-speciﬁc meta- bolic rate at the reference temperature (10 °c): values of female-speciﬁc slope parameters were negatively correlated with the mean mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates of their progeny (calculated as the mean of residuals from the relationship r = amb, r² = 0.39, f1,10 = 6.46, p = 0.003, fig. 2). treatment-speciﬁc intercepts inﬂuenced the shape of the curve and par- ticularly the threshold above which survival probabil- ity decreases with increasing egg sizes. indeed, this threshold shifted towards large egg sizes, resulting in a relatively ﬂat relationship between egg size and sur- vival probability within the observed range of egg sizes at both 6 °c (a1k range: 4.27–4.47) and 10 °c (a2k range: 4.64–4.91) (fig. 3a,b). at 14.5 °c, indi- viduals originating from small eggs had a higher sur- vival than their conspeciﬁcs originating from large eggs (a3k range: 2.23–2.49) for the observed range of egg sizes (fig. 3c). discussion using individual monitoring from birth to emergence, our study points out a role of incubation environment as opposed to later life stages (einum & fleming 2000) for the understanding of egg size evolution and the and

between metabolic rate and body mass) and the slope parameter (a0k) of the relationship between survival and egg size for the different progenies (y =  1.66   2.82 9 metabolic rate). the mass-speciﬁc metabolic rate indicates whether a progeny presents a higher or lower metabolic rate than other progenies regardless of the mass. the relationship between metabolic rate and egg survival presents negative slopes for all progenies, but the greater the mean mass-speciﬁc metabolic rate, the lower the survival rate at a given egg size. offspring’s ﬁtness. maternal reproductive investment (egg size and fecundity) was largely inﬂuenced by female phenotype. egg mass and fecundity were, to a large extent, related to female size. once egg size and fecundity were corrected for the effect of female size, a negative relationship was found between egg size and fecundity; however, this relationship was weak. although the studied population appears to conform to the famous egg size–fecundity trade-off documented for a high diversity of organisms (sinervo & licht 1991; williams 2001; gregersen et al. 2006), however, this result should be consid- ered with caution and needs to be conﬁrmed with larger samples. the presence of this parent–offspring conﬂict allowed us to consider female and offspring ﬁtness according to classical optimality models (smith & fretwell 1974; sargent et al. 1987). we here consider the selective factors that may explain our results and discuss their role in the maintenance of the important variability of maternal investment in wild populations. metabolism

(2012). in contrast, due to the high variability of metabolic rate at 14.5 °c, the allometric relationship between metabolic rate and body mass was not signiﬁcant. this last result suggests a disruption of normal physi- ological functions at temperature for at least some individuals. however, these results must be considered with caution as individuals mea- sured for mr at a given temperature were raised at this same temperature; is not possible to disentangle the effect of acclimatisation to the tem- perature from the effect of temperature. for individuals raised at 10 °c may have a example, different mr than individuals raised at 14.5 °c when measured at 14.5 °c. this experimental thus, it test survival during incubation daily mean temperature in the bertiz tributary ranged from 7 to 10 °c during the incubation period in 2008 –2009. so, 6 °c corresponded to the lowest tempera- ture to which eggs or larvae could be subjected dur- ing early development, whereas 14.5 °c represented a temperature rarely encountered before the end of april. ojanguren & bra~na (2003) studied the effects of temperature on embryonic development of brown_trout from northern spain: they found a high mortal- ity at 14 °c and 6 °c (approximately 80% and 60%, 174 respectively), whereas survival was maximised at 10 °c (within the range 8–10 °c) with mortality just below 40%. in our study, mortality was very low at 6 °c and 10 °c (6.25% and 4.17%, respectively), while it reached 30.73% at 14.5 °c. we therefore obtained a similar pattern than that observed in the study of ojanguren & bra~na (2003), but with differ- ent overall mortality rates. a possible reason for these paralleled differences may be the exposure to pathogens. in contrast to this last study, we isolated the eggs in the well of cell culture plates that avoided direct contacts between individuals. in addition, dead individuals were removed daily which has likely lim- ited pathogen transfer between individuals. one can argue that, as the number of degree days required to reach emergence decreases with temperature (telet- chea et al. 2009), the highest mortality found at 14.5 °c is a consequence of starvation because emer- gence may have occurred 1 or 2 days prior the 745 degree limit chosen in the present study. however, in all treatments, ﬁsh measured at 745 degree had remnant yolk and the age at which last larvae died were 503, 634 and 610 degree at 6, 10 and 14.5 °c, respectively, thus more than 9 days before the end of experiments. the survival model that was best sup- ported by dic and deviance estimates accounted for female-speciﬁc slope parameters for the effect of ini- tial egg mass on survival and female-speciﬁc inter- cept for treatment type (incubation condition). this model revealed that large and small eggs had high and similar survival rates at both 6 and 10 °c, but that large eggs suffered higher mortalities at 14.5 °c. maternal investment and offspring survival in brown_trout this lower survival at 14.5 °c may be the conse- quence of impaired physiological functions as stated by metabolic rate measurements obtained in the pres- ent study. however, these results must be analysed with caution because of the small sample size for metabolic rate measurements. in addition, measure- ments were obtained on individuals not considered in the survival analysis, and our results do not show an effect of initial egg size on the impairment of physio- logical functions. yet the abilities to acquire oxygen (e.g., gill capacity) and to deliver it efﬁciently (circu- latory system) are also allometric functions of body mass with scaling exponents inferior to one (i.e., large individuals are less efﬁcient, wegner et al. 2010). thus, the exponential increase in metabolic rate with temperature (gillooly et al. 2001) may be constrained by oxygen uptake capacity at 14.5 °c in large individuals. this might explain a lack of rela- tionship between metabolic rate and body mass at this temperature and a lower survival of large individ- uals unable to sustain their high oxygen require- ments. another important point raised by this study is the presence of female-speciﬁc parameters deﬁning the relationship between egg size and survival throughout incubation. differences in slope and inter- cept parameters among clutches result in more or less steeper relationships between egg size and offspring survival. among-clutch differences in slope parame- ter seem to be related to physiological traits as proge- nies’ mean metabolic rate is negatively related to female-speciﬁc slope parameters. thus, the relation- ship between survival probability and egg size is clutch speciﬁc and seems to depend on metabolism. in a previous study, it has been shown that in brown_trout larvae originating from the same population, the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is clutch speciﬁc and is related to maternal investment in egg mass (regnier et al. 2012). accordingly, if survival throughout incubation at the experimental tempera- tures depends on an individual’s metabolic rate, then the relationship between survival and egg mass should be female speciﬁc as observed in the present study. thus, these results and the observed impair- ment of metabolic rate at 14.5 °c tend to suggest a role of metabolic rate in survival and its dependence upon egg size. the present ﬁndings state that survival throughout incubation is environment and female speciﬁc. also female-speciﬁc relationships between survival and egg size seem to be a consequence of female effects on offspring metabolic rate. these results indicate that variability of spawning grounds or variations in spawning site selection by females (devries 1997; acornley 1999) may promote the maintenance of egg size variation within salmonid populations. in particu- lar, an association between variations in incubation environments and egg size could be maintained through ‘phenotype habitat matching’ (hendry et al. 2001) where females deposit their eggs in incubation environments they are best suited. further research should now focus on ﬁeld surveys and experimental manipulations in semi-natural environments. accord- ingly, it is necessary to determine whether female actively chose spawning sites maximising the survival of offspring with regard to maternal investment strate- gies. for this purpose, an option would be to investi- gate the repeatability of spawning site choice (within a spawning season) and measuring offspring survival in preferred and nonpreferred incubation environ- ments. it would be also interesting to measure whether and how female preferences for spawning sites evolve with their maternal investment over consecutive spawning periods. alternatively, the vari- ability in incubation environments provided by females may be a consequence of female competition for preferred sites (van den berghe & gross 1989); thus, social status may condition maternal investment strategies. in accordance, phenotype habitat matching may be a consequence of subordinate females being displaced to nonpreferred spawning sites. experimen- tal tests with varying intensities of female competition would allow testing if subordinate females maximise ﬁtness through the production of eggs suited to ‘rea- lised’ spawning site as opposed to dominant ones with investment strategies suited for ‘preferred’ ones. for variable incubation environments and life stages to favour different egg sizes and should be considered in the study of egg size evolution. in particular, the pres- ent results may challenge the generally accepted view that ‘bigger is better’ from offspring perspec- tive and that variability of incubation environment provided by parents may promote within-population variability of egg size in opposition to a single optimal solution. this study revealed the potential acknowledgements the ﬁeld sampling was realised
