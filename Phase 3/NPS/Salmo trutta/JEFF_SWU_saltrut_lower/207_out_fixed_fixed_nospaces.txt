trondheim, %niversity of oslo, norway abstract - fry of the arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus, were experimentally stocked into a small fish-free lake to test the hypothesis that the size- dependent habitat shift from the epibenthic to the pelagic habitat is genet- ically determined. the charr originated from a nearby lake inhabiting predatory brown_trout salmo_trutta. the cohort of stocked charr was investigated for three years. the arctic charr started to exploit the pelagic habitat in their first summer at a size of 7-9 cm in contrast to about 15 cm in the donor lake. in the next two summers, the pelagic fraction of the cohort increased. l h e main fraction lived in epibenthic areas, utilizing the same prey as pelagic charr. water temperature moderated the habitat use of juveniles such that they avoided warm (>16"c) waters and resided in cool, deep areas. the result was consistent with the hypothesis of a trade- off between feeding benefit and the predation risk producing spatial segre- gation of arctic charr and demonstrated that the fish can facultatively re- spond to predation risk and adjust the size at which they migrate to the pelagic zone to feed on zooplankton.

with ontogeny and may also vary be- tween environments. differences in diet may be due to size-specific foraging tactics and prey abun- dance (werner & hall 1976; werner et al. 1983; holbrook & schmitt 1988) and can have signifi- cant consequences for species interactions (wern- er & gilliam 1984). recent work has shown that ontogenetic changes in diet or habitat also may be mediated by predation risk (mittelbach & chesson 1987; he & kitchell 1990). in experimental studies, fish have been shown to respond to predators by moving to protective habitats (cerri & fraser 1983; werner et al. 1983), reducing foraging distances (dill & fraser 1984) and limiting feeding time and intake (milinski & heller 1978). laboratory experiments have dem- onstrated that prey fish balance foraging and risk of predation when exposed to a simulated predator (reviewed by milinski 1993). a similar trade-off between feeding possibilities and risk of predation has been demonstrated in a field study of natural populations of arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus (l'abce-lund et al. 1993). they found that juven- ile charr used the pelagic habitat in accordance with food availability and risk of predation. the length of the smallest charr recorded in the pelagic habitat was positively correlated with the body size of the largest predatory brown_trout, salmo_trutta, present. however, they could not determine whether the length when this habitat shift occurred was genetically or environmentally determined. in their study of ontogenetic habitat shift in bluegill sunfish, lepomis macrochirus, werner & hall (1988) demonstrated a complex pattern of mi- gration mechanisms. the bluegill fry migrated to the pelagic zone to feed on zooplankton and re- 200 turned to littoral areas in four lakes at a length of ~ 1 2 . 5 mm. after some years in the littoral zone they reentered the pelagic zone at a specific body length that varied among lakes. this length was positively correlated with the density of large- mouth bass, micropterus salmoides, a major blueg- ill predator, this interlake variation was explained by a genetic component (werner & hall 1988). the arctic charr is a coldwater species com- monly distributed in arctic and temperate areas with a highly variable habitat use and feeding habits (johnson 1980). in general they exploit lit- toral areas and feed on littoral zoobenthos and crustacean zooplankton in allopatry, whereas they are confined to deep epibenthic and pelagic areas in sympatry with brown_trout (nilsson 1965; lan- geland et al. 1991). in this study we test the hypothesis whether the body size when juvenile arctic charr migrate from epibenthic areas to pelagic habitat has a genetic component. if this is true, we predict that the lake specific length when becoming pelagic is maintained when the stock is transplanted into a new environ- ment. an alternative hypotheses saying that the size of pelagic arctic charr differ between the donor and the new environment, is based on the plasticity of arctic charr in optimizing habitats and diet. this was tested by experimentally stocking a fish-free lake with fry of hatchery reared arctic charr from a nearby lake. in the donor lake, charr live in sympa- try with predatory brown_trout and demonstrate a habitat shift from epibentic to pelagic areas at a body size larger than 15 cm (l'abee-lund et al. 1993). we studied the habitat use and food of one single cohort of charr over a three-year period. methods the experimental lake, ellingtjern, is small (sur- face area 3 ha) and situated 453 m a.s.1. close to ontogenetic habitat shift lake songsjoen, central norway, where the fish populations have been well studied (langeland et al. 1991; l'abce-lund et al. 1993; langeland & l'abce-lund 1996). the fish species in lake songsjaen (arctic charr and brown_trout) are ex- ploited only for scientific purpuse (op.cit.). el- lingtjern had a small population of introduced brown_trout which were eliminated using the toxin rotenone in the spring of 1992. this was to ensure that the lake was complete free of predators before the stocking of charr fry, survival tests with young charr in small cages during summer of 1992 showed that the fish died after few days. very low density of zooplankton in 1992, only a few rotifers and cyclopid copepodids were recorded, also indi- cated the toxicity of the lake water. in 1993, the common cladocerans reappeared, however, the density was very low and less than 20 mg dry weight/m2. the stocking of charr was therefore postponed to the spring of 1994. apart from the lack of fish, the aquatic ecosystem had fully recov- ered by spring 1994 when our experiment started. this was indicated by the recovery of zooplankton and high survival of charr fry after stocking in 1994. lake ellingtjern is 15 m deep, oligotrophic and with a total phosphorous content of 5 pg per liter. it is strongly influenced by humic substances in the watershed resulting in a brown color of 40 mg pt/ l and water transparency of 3.0-3.5 m (secchi depth). commercial fertilizers were added to the lake in 1993 and the year of stocking (1994) to increase and recover the zooplankton. as a result the phosphorous content increased four fold in the epilimnion and doubled in the hypolimnion. the increase in phytoplankton biomass only slightly re- duced the water transparency from ca. 3.8 m to ca. 3.3 m, mainly due to a 3- to 4-fold increase in herbivorous zooplankton such as holopedium gib- berum. table 1. total catch of

artificial food until stocking on june 7 1994, when a total of 3500 fry (mean length 6.0 cm, se=0.45 cm) were released. sampling was performed in six periods during 1994-1996 using gill nets of bar mesh sizes 6-19.5 mm (table 1). the mesh size was increased accord- ing to increased body size as growth proceeded. the pelagic nets were set over the deepest area of the lake from the surface down to 6 m depth for one night each sampling period. the benthic nets were set perpendicular to the shore at two deep (1- 10 m deep) and one shallow (< 1.5 m) station. nets were set at 1600-1800 hours and emptied the next day at 0900-1200 hours. three pelagic gill nets (each 25 mx6 m, total net area 450 m2) were used in all sampling periods. six benthic gill nets (each 25 mx1.5 m, total net area 225 m2) were used in the three first sampling periods and three gill nets (total net area 112.5 m2) in the last three sam- plings. in lake songsj~ren, similar benthic and pel- agic gill nets of bar mesh sizes 12.5-35 mm were used in the years 1985-94 (langeland & l‘abce- lund 1996). this study demonstrated small in- teryear variation in habitat use, and thus the lack of temporal pseudoreplicates in our experimental lake are supposed not to be a problem. the catches of arctic charr in gill nets with mesh sizes 12.5- 19.5 mm in lake songsjnen were selected for com- parison of the size distributions of fish between the two lakes in the pelagic zones. in total, 1969 charr (58%) were recaptured in lake ellingtjern. the position in the gill nets and depth of capture was recorded for each fish, as was total fish length (to 0.1 cm) and weight. in each period of netting a subsample of recaptured charr was taken for stomach analysis (table 1). as all charr in the experimental lake originated from one cohort, otoliths for age determination were not sampled. stomach contents were identified to spe- cies level in the case of zooplankton and littoral crustaceans, while other food items were classified as chironomids, snails, aquatic insect larvae, adult terrestrial insects, coleoptera and unidentified items. two replicate samples of zooplankton was taken each period using a plankton net (mesh size 95 pm, net diameter 30 cm) from 10 m depth to surface in the years 1992-1996. water temperature were recorded at surface and down to 10 m with one meter interval in the eve- ning. in july 1996 temperature was measured down to 2 m depth. all statistical tests were performed with the spss/pc computer package (norusis 1986). dif- 202 ferences in mean size were tested by analysis of variance (anova). results spatial distribution the stocked charr demonstrated a change in habi- tat use throughout the study. about one month after release most (53 out of 57) recaptured charr were caught in epibenthic areas, close to the bot- tom in the lower 10 cm of the gill nets. one month thereafter, the charr were more evenly distributed in the bottom nets, indicating increased activity and a change from a cryptic behaviour close to the bottom. moreover, the charr exhibited an in- creased tendency to use the pelagic habitat through the study in terms of both number caught and in their spatial location (fig. 1). the use of epibenthic areas in summer was simi- lar in 1994 and 1995; fish were chiefly using depths between 4 and 10 m (fig. 1). maximum densities were registered at 6 8 m, i.e., 2.5 times the secchi depth. in july 1996, however, juvenile charr used the shallow littoral area (<1.5 m) as well as deeper areas. this was in contrast to july 1994 and 1995 when only a few charr were caught in the shallow littoral waters (<1.5 m). the charr exhibited a similar use of pelagic habitat in 1995 and 1996, irrespective of the period of the year and water temperature (fig. 1). only a few charr were caught in the pelagic zone in 1994. depth ternp’c 4 v 4 i  fig. 1. pattern of spatial distribution of arctic charr in benthic and pelagic habitats and

august/september with maximum tem- peratures of 11-12°c. fish length and food the charr more than doubled their length during the study (fig. 2). up until july 1995, charr recap- tured in epibenthic areas had a tendency to be larger than their pelagic conspecifics, but after this date pelagic charr were significantly (anova; p<o.ool) larger than epibenthic individuals. the small difference in length between habitats in july 1995 was statistically significant due to large sample sizes, and were probably of little ecological importance. the charr started exploiting the pel- agic areas soon after release, and the smallest charr recaptured by pelagic nets was 6.2 cm in length. the length distribution of charr recaptured in pel- agic waters (mean=12.5 cm, s.d.=2.0 cm, all years 1994-1 996) was significantly (anova; p<o.ool) skewed to the left compared to the donor strain in lake songsjaren (mean=20.0 cm, s.d.=2.4 cm, 1985-1994). fig. 3 shows the size distribution of charr caught on the

weight/m2) three-to-four-fold compared to the following years mainly due to high densities of holopedium gib- berum. in the pre-stocking years, 1992-1993, the zooplankton density was very low, due to the poi- soning in 1992 which killed most of the crustacean. bosmina longispina was the overall dominating zo- oplankton in 1995 and 1996 (total zooplankton biomass about 100 mg dry weight/m2), and only single individuals of a few other zooplankton spe- cies were recorded during the investigation. the 204 zooplankton results indicate that the benefit of feeding in pelagic waters was low in all years. the zooplankton biomass in lake songsj~ren (ca 100 mg dry weight/m2 in 1985-89) was similar to that of lake ellingtjern in 1995 and 1996. there were small differences in food intake among charr caught in the epibenthic and pelagic zones (fig. 4). the food choice of charr in both zones consisted of up to eight different food items. b. longispina, chironomids, adult insects and eury- cereus lamellatus were important prey items in most years, although relative ranking changed among years, but not among habitats. in general, the size of the food items increased with their increasing fish length, although b. longispinu main- tained its importance as a food item independent of fish size. the dominating zooplankton species in 1994, h. gibberum, was of low importance as food (fig. 4). discussion these results show clearly that juvenile arctic charr demonstrate plasticity in the length at which they migrate into pelagic waters. this shift from epibenthic to pelagic areas mostly occurred at a small size of 10 cm during their second summer of life in lake ellingtjern, although a few charr were recaptured in the pelagic waters in their first sum- mer at a length of about 6 cm. this was at a sig- nificantly smaller size than their conspecifics in the donor lake, songsjaren. the main difference in the two lakes is that the donor lake contains brown_trout in addition to arctic charr. brown_trout are in general an important predator on small arctic charr (l'abee-lund et al. 1992). if juvenile charr entered the pelagic zone in lake songsjaren at a small size and were eaten by brown_trout, this could affect the probability of catching small charr relative to the larger individuals. however, only eight brown_trout (0.5 yo) out of a total catch of 1725 trout had arctic charr in their stomachs (l'abee-lund et al. 1992). in other respects the lakes are comparable - water transparency is al- most identical (ca. 3 4 m), the biomass of pelagic cladocera was low (ca.100 mg dry weight /m2), the dominating species and most important prey for charr is bosrnina longispina in both lakes (lange- land & l'abce-lund 1996; this study). the minimum size at which charr exhibit onto- genetic habitat shift during their first and second summer of life was about 8 cm in lake ellingtjern, which is the preferred prey size of brown_trout of 25-35 cm in length (l'abce-lund et al. 1992). this length interval of the predator is common in lake songsjaren (langeland & l'abee-lund 1996). in contrast, charr attain pelagic behavior by about 15 cm and 2-3 years old in lake songsjlaen (l'abce- lund et al. 1993). thus, our results demonstrate that there is no genetic threshold determining when the juvenile arctic charr attain pelagic be- havior. if the ontogenetic habitat shift from epib- enthic to pelagic habitat was genetically deter- mined, we should have found similar length when juvenile arctic charr became pelagic in our fish- less experimental lake and in the donor lake that contained a piscivorous fish species. the length distributions were, however, significantly differ- ent - and skewed to the left in the fish-free lake. we consider our results consistent with the hypo- thesis of a trade off between food demand and ontogenetic habitat shift presence of predators in spatial distribution of juv- enile arctic charr (l'abee-lund et al. 1993), and that arctic charr demonstrate an opportunistic habitat or resource use. the predator-dependent size at habitat shift in arctic charr fits the model presented by werner & gilliam (1984) and werner (1986). a decreased risk of predation in the pelagic habitat should result in a decreased size at the habitat shift. werner & hall (1988) demonstrated that the length of bluegill sunfish at the time of habitat shift between littoral and pelagic habitat was directly correlated with the density of the major predator of the bluegill in the lakes studied. the biomass of cladocera in the pelagic habitat was low in our lake but almost identical to the do- nor lake. compared with the habitat use of arctic charr in several other lakes investigated (lange- land et al. 1991), we consider the foraging benefit in the pelagic zone to be less than in littoral areas. despite this, a considerable number of the stocked charr were recaptured at a small size in the pelagic habitat. the density (as cpue) of arctic charr, was 10-20 times higher in epibenthic zone and 10 times higher in pelagic zone in lake ellingtjern than in lake songsjaren. this may indicate a strong intra-cohort competition for food in lake ellingtjern. moreover, this may have affected the habitat shift in lake ellingtjern. however, if the fish density was important in regulating the frac- tion being pelagic, we would have expected a higher fraction of pelagic charr in lake ellingtjern compared to lake songsjaren than recorded. thus, we consider the fish density being of minor import- ance affecting the ontogenetic habitat shift in arc- tic charr. the cessation in growth in 1996 occurred simultaneously with sexual maturation of males and indicate that food availability in all habitats was to low to maintain both growth and produc- tion of gonads. the low growth rate and small size attained after three years is a typical result of food limitation when compared to the growth potential of arctic charr (varllestad & l'abce-lund 1994; ugedal et al. 1994). our study revealed the effect of water tempera- ture in structuring the habitat use of juvenile arc- tic charr. the arctic charr avoided shallow littoral waters in july when the water temperature was about 16-20°c. the habitat use in july 1994 and 1995 (warm) and 1996 (cool) demonstrate the tem- perature effect. thus, all other factors being un- changed, the juvenile arctic charr avoided warm waters in both epibenthic and pelagic areas. one reason for this may be that the optimum tempera- ture range for growth of arctic charr is 11-14°c (jobling 1983; jensen 1985). how do fish evaluate the risk of predation in the pelagic zone? we can think of two explanations - 205 langeland & l'ame-lund vision and chemical cues. chemosensory mechan- isms are important for many salmonids during their migratory periods. under laboratory con- ditions chemical cues have also been demonstrated to be important in kinship recognition (reviewed by brown & brown 1996). thus, it is reasonable to believe that prey species are able to detect the presence of a predator by olfaction. laboratory experiments with pike, esox lucius, and minnow, phoxinus phoxinus, showed that minnow alter their behaviour being less likely to take risks in the pres- ence of pike-odours in the water (magurran 1990). however, this mechanism can not explain the sig- nificant, linear relationship between size of the smallest pelagic prey fishes and the size of the largest predators recorded among lakes (l'abce- lund et al. 1993). thus, an additional sensory cue must take part in the evaluation of the predation risk in juvenile arctic charr. this could be vision as charr are known to feed successfully under poor light conditions (ali & wagner 1980), and thus be able to detect a predator over distances under poor light conditions. to conclude, our experimental study demon- strates that the size when arctic charr attain a pel- agic behavior is under environmental control and not direct under genetical control. moreover, water temperture has a strong effect on habitat use in juveline arctic charr restricting the use of warm (> 16°c) waters. 1. para determinar si el cambio en el us0 de habitat dependiente del tamafio desde zonas epibhticas a pelagicas esta determina- do geneticamente, realizamos un experiment0 consistente en in- troducir juveniles de salvelinus_alpinus en un pequeiio lago libre de peces, donde fueron investigados durante tres aiios consecu- tivos. los juveniles procedieron de un lago cercano habitado por salmo_trutta. 2. los juveniles de s. alpinus comenzaron a explotar la zona pelagica durante el primer verano de vida, cuando tenian unos 7-9 cm de longitud, mientras que en el lago original, lo hacen a 10s 15 cm. durante 10s dos veranos siguientes, la fraccibn peligica de la cohorte aumentb aunque la mayor parte de la poblacion utilizo la zona epibkntica predando sobre las mismas presas que 10s individuos pelagicos. la temperatura del agua tambien influyo en el us0 del habitat de 10s juveniles, de manera que estos evitan las aguas de temperaturas > 16"c, seleccionan- do zonas mas profundas y frias. 3. nuestros resultados son consistentes con la hipotesis relativa a un trade-off entre beneficio alimenticio y riesgo de predacion, que tiene como resultado una segregacion de la especie. ade- mas, 10s peces pueden responder de forma facultativa al riesgo de predacibn, ajustando el tamaiio al cual migran hacia la zona peligica para alimentarse de zooplancton. acknowledgments this work was supported by the
