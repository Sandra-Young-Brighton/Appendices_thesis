rie- man et al. 1997). in june 1998, bull trout in the columbia river basin were declared a threatened species under the federal endangered species act of 1973 (u.s. fish and wildlife service 1999). the current status of many bull trout populations magniﬁes the importance of conservation efforts through comprehensive research throughout this species range. to identify habitats in need of protection and restoration, ﬁsheries managers must understand the life history and ecology of early life stages where mortality is high. juvenile bull trout, par- ticularly age-0 ﬁsh, have speciﬁc habitat require- ments (goetz 1989; rieman & mcintyre 1993) that are important to survivorship (saffel & scar- necchia 1995) and growth. mcphail & murray (1979) suggested that the survival of bull trout fry is the bottleneck that limits production of the population. quantifying microhabitat use could improve understanding of habitat productivity (rieman & mcintyre 1993) and help reduce the extent of this biological bottleneck and identify critical habitats for protection and restoration. while several studies have described the habitat use of juvenile bull trout (pratt 1984; nakano et al. 1992; jakober 1995; baxter & mcphail 1997; thurow 1997), speciﬁc habitat descriptions for age-0 ﬁsh are lacking. therefore, the objectives of this study were to describe the temporal and spatial differences in the rearing microhabitats of age-0 bull trout. study area this study was conducted in indian creek, washington, usa, a second-order tributary of rimrock reservoir (468390n, 1218100w) in the yakima river basin. indian creek originates from apple and pear lakes on the eastern slope 81 polacek & james of the cascade mountains. the stream head- waters are at 1548 m above sea level and the mouth at 875 m above sea level. indian creek ﬂows southeast through a fairly conﬁned valley. average daily water temperatures range from approximately 1 to 10 8c. occasional valley widening has permitted lateral stream channel migration and these areas of widening act as zones of aggradation where high volumes of mostly cobble and gravel are stored. bull trout is the predominant ﬁsh species in indian creek, which is a spawning and rearing stream for adﬂuvial bull trout from rimrock reservoir. brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis), cut- (oncorhynchus clarki), mountain throat whiteﬁsh (prosopium_williamsoni), and sculpins (cottus spp.) also inhabit the system; however, their densities are much lower than those of bull trout (personal observation). trout two 50-m-long study sites were selected in indian creek. site a was the upstream site locat- ed in the mainstem. it was characterized by an abundance of pool, pocket-pool, and rifﬂe habitats and unconsolidated, unembedded cob- ble and gravel substrates. the maximum water depth in the site was 80 cm, and rootwads and other woody debris were present. site b was the downstream site located within a side channel of the mainstem. the site was located in a narrow valley ﬂoor and had a lower gradi- ent than site a. site b was characterized by silt, sand, and gravel with an occasional small boulder. pools, pocket-pools, and rifﬂes were present, but had relatively lower water velocities than site a. woody debris was present through- out the site. a thermograph was placed in the main channel near site b, and recorded water temperatures every 2 h from august 01, 1997 to november 21, 1997. materials and methods to quantify diel habitat use, we recorded bull trout numbers and microhabitat use once each day and night during each sampling period at both study sites from july 21 to november 21, 1997. day and night sampling was completed twice a month unless uncontrollable factors caused longer intervals between sampling periods. we began sampling at approximately 1200 hours, and again 1 h after darkness. we attempted to measure at least 30 age-0 bull trout microhabitats for each site during both day and night sampling periods. a length–frequency analysis indicated cohorts. throughout the study, we deﬁned age- 0 bull trout as ﬁsh between 22 and 81 mm total length. 82 each study site was walked and snorkeled simultaneously to locate age-0 bull trout in shal- low and deep sections of the study sites. the snorkeler traveled upstream and recorded data on a plastic wrist slate. when the snorkeler or bank observer located a bull trout, a metal num- ber-coded colored washer was placed at the ﬁsh’s focal point. the focal point was deﬁned as the ﬁsh’s vertical and horizontal position and orien- tation with respect to the wetted stream channel and direction of water ﬂow. the observer on the stream bank also acted as the data recorder and noted the washer’s color and general location in the study site. the observer that marked the ﬁsh’s focal point estimated the ﬁsh’s total length (tl in mm), the ﬁsh distance from the stream bottom (cm), and habitat and refuge type associated with the ﬁsh (i.e., substrate, woody debris, root wad, detritus, undercut bank, aquatic vegetation, over- hanging vegetation, turbulence, or depth). refuge habitats were deﬁned as the location selected by the ﬁsh when disturbed. a second crew of 2–3 people followed the observers and measured ﬁve variables at each washer: (i) total water depth (cm), (ii) water velocity (m/s) and depth (cm) at ﬁsh’s focal point, (iii) dominant substrate size (in a 400-cm2 area around the washer; (iv) percent substrate embeddedness (visual estimation), and (v) the distance to the next closest ﬁsh (cm). substrate was classiﬁed as silt, sand (particle diameter 1–5 mm), gravel (6–50 mm), cobble (51–250 mm), small boulder (251–1000 mm), large boulder (>1000 mm), bedrock, and detrital mate- rial. all silt and sand substrate types were con- sistently loose throughout the study sites and, therefore, were considered 0% embedded for analysis. the number of bull trout observed in each site was recorded to calculate bull trout densities per 100 m. to evaluate the accuracy of ﬁsh length estima- tion, visually estimated lengths were compared to ﬁsh that were collected and measured. a paired student’s t-test was used in the july comparison when the lengths of the same ﬁsh were estimated and then measured. for the remainder of the study, a student’s t-test was applied when esti- mated ﬁsh lengths were compared to a random sample of ﬁsh collected after the microhabitat survey. at least 30 bull trout were collected with small dip nets in site a. age-0 bull trout were captured and placed into holding buckets. fish were then measured to the nearest milli- meter in a glass 50-ml graduated cylinder with water. a folding ruler was used to both conﬁne and measure the ﬁsh in the graduated cylinder. no anesthetics were applied during the measuring process. the kolmogorov–smirnov goodness of ﬁt two- sample test was used to compare day and night for categorical (i.e. habitat type) and nonmeasured variables (i.e. embeddedness). depending on sam- ple sizes, a t-test or z-test was used to detect signiﬁcant differences in microhabitat use between day and night. a shannon–weaver diversity index was calculated to indicate the degree of diversity among substrate types used by age-0 bull trout. we placed statistical signiﬁ- cance at the 0.05 level. results and discussion data from both study sites were combined for analysis. we counted 141 age-0 bull trout during the day and 788 at night. microhabitats were measured for 91 and 403 age-0 bull trout during the day and night, respectively. two adults and one age-0 brook_trout were counted throughout the entire study, indicating extremely low densi- ties relative to bull trout. we do not believe that age-0 bull/brook_trout identiﬁcation had any effect on the results of this study. quality control efforts regarding estimated ﬁsh lengths versus measured ﬁsh lengths revealed that we tended to underestimate lengths in august (z¼ 4.006; d.f.¼ 229; p < 0.001) and november (z¼ 2.411; d.f.¼ 181; p < 0.01) by an average of 5.6 and 2.8 mm, respectively. no signiﬁcant dif- ferences existed between samples for july, sep- tember, and october. bull trout were very docile and few were observed swimming away from the observers. therefore, we were conﬁdent that ﬁsh were using their original focal points when ﬁrst sighted, and were not forced into nonpreferred habitats by the snorkeler and bank observer. frequently, ﬁsh were found back at their original focal point within minutes of marking their location. diel microhabitat use habitat of age-0 bull trout has been reported as shallow, slow-water areas along stream margins (brown 1992; mcphail & murray 1979; fraley & shepard 1989; rieman & mcintyre 1993; saffel & scarnecchia 1995). we found most age-0 bull trout in shallow stream margins (fig. 1a) at water velocities near 0 cm/s (table 1), and never exceed- ing 31.0 cm/s (fig. 1b). age-0 bull trout used deeper water during the day than at night; how- ever, no diel difference existed for focal point velocity (table 1). dolloff & reeves (1990) found age-0 dolly varden (salvelinus_malma) at water velocities near 0 cm/s. we believe that these slow, shallow water habitats provide the prey base for diel microhabitat use fig. 1. comparisons of day (gray bars) and night (black bars) microhabitat use by age-0 bull trout for water depth (a), focal point water velocity (b), and distance from the stream bottom (c). age-0 bull trout. james (1997) found ostracods in the stream margins of indian creek and observed ostracods in the stomachs of age-0 bull trout. age-0 bull trout were found to be highly asso- ciated with the stream bottom. bull trout were never more than 4.0 cm from the stream bottom during the day and 0.5 cm at night (fig. 1c). these 83 polacek & james table1. diel microhabitat use of age-0 bull trout and statistical comparisons be- tween day and night. table 2. diel microhabitats used by age-0 bull trout. microhabitat habitat types refuge types substrate types embeddedness (%) microhabitat parameter day p total water depth (cm) <0.001 water velocity (cm/s) >0.05 distance to closest fish (cm) >0.05 values are means (se) for water depth, water velocity, and distance to closest fish. 18.3 0.8 4.7 0.9 73.7 0.1 night 14.5 0.5 4.9 0.3 86.9 6.5 ﬁndings are consistent with other bull trout stu- dies (pratt 1984; fraley & shepard 1989; goetz 1989; rode 1989; brown 1992; nakano et al. 1992) and for the closely related dolly varden (dolloff & reeves 1990). diel comparisons revealed that age-0 bull trout were located closer to the stream bottom at night (z¼ 4.181; p < 0.001). age-0 bull trout were found over a variety of small, loose substrates including silt, sand, gravel, and cobble (table 2) which is consistent with other studies for age-0 bull trout (goetz 1991) and dolly varden (dolloff & reeves 1990). bull trout did not use more diverse substrate types during the day than at night (p > 0.05), resulting in a diversity index of 0.8226 and 0.7745 for day and night, respectively. most bull trout were found over substrate that was 0–40% embedded (table 2), and diel differences did not exist (k- s¼ 0.500; p > 0.05). pratt (1992) found juvenile bull trout over stacked, unembedded substrates. loose substrate seemed to be very important for refuge cover. in this study, disturbed age-0 bull trout used substrate interstices and woody debris as refuge cover (table 2). goetz (1991) and thurow (1997) frequently observed bull trout swimming into substrate interstices and woody debris or burrowing into loose silt and detritus when disturbed, similar to our ﬁndings. no age-0 bull trout were found associated with substrate that was 100% embedded. this indicates the imp- ortance of interstitial spaces for habitat during base and high ﬂows. stream ﬁshes can utilize the interstices in the substrate (hartman 1963), and locate as deep as 15–30 cm below the substrate surface (everest 1969) during high-ﬂow events. diel activity most of the ﬁsh sampled were found in the open; however, the few concealed ﬁsh were located in interstices or under organic debris that was near positive ﬂow. this may indicate that few age-0 bull trout stay relatively hidden while they feed. the highest counts of age-0 bull trout were found at night throughout the entire study. in the meto- lius river basin in late june, goetz (1991) found 84 percent frequency day night detritus depth woody debris rootwad substrate turbulence aquatic vegetation overhanging vegetation undercut bank detritus depth woody debris rootwad substrate turbulence aquatic vegetation overhanging vegetation undercut bank detritus silt sand (1^5 mm) gravel (6^50 mm) cobble (51^250 mm) small boulder (251^1000 mm) large boulder (>1000 mm) bedrock 0 20 40 60 80 100 15.6 1.1 17.7 0.0 65.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.4 0.0 64.4 1.7 27.1 0.0 0.0 3.4 0.0 8.8 14.3 38.5 25.3 13.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 77.9 9.7 2.8 5.5 4.1 0.0 0.8 0.0 4.5 0.0 94.5 0.0 0.3 0.0 0.0 1.3 4.0 27.4 2.7 62.7 0.7 1.3 0.0 0.0 2.2 16.7 33.7 35.4 12.2 1.2 0.0 0.0 63.9 16.8 7.3 7.3 4.7 0.0 microhabitat use was visually estimated by category. habitat and refuge types were defined as follows: detritus (fine organic material), depth (fish was suspended from bottom in deep water),woody debris (logs and tree limbs),rootwad (tree roots), substrate (fish was on the bottom or in the interstices),turbulence (fish was directly under the surface using nonlaminar flow), aquatic vegetation (aquatic macro- phytes), overhanging vegetation (terrestrial plants overhanging the stream), and undercut bank (sub-surface eroded stream bank). peak counts of age-0 bull trout during mid-day through late afternoon. we found the highest densities of age-0 bull trout at night, and daytime counts decreased throughout the study (fig. 2). a similar diel behavior shift was also observed for bull trout (thurow 1997), arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) (adams et al. 1988), age-0 steelhead trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) (edmundson et al. 1968), and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) (northcote 1992). this shift to exclusive noctur- nal activities may indicate that ﬁsh are switching to a diet that consists of larger drifting prey items, since the invertebrate drift generally reaches high- est densities in the evening hours (waters 1962). james (1997) began to observe age-0 bull trout feeding nocturnally with older conspeciﬁcs in september. diel microhabitat use fig. 2. counts of age-0 bull trout during the day (gray bars) and night (black bars) and mean daily water temperatures (se) (line) for each sampling date. a second factor that may be attributed to a shift to nocturnal activity is intraspeciﬁc predation. predation on juvenile bull trout is mostly by older conspeciﬁcs (armstrong & morrow 1980). dur- ing our study, juvenile bull trout (ages 1–3) were exclusively nocturnal and cannibalism on age-0 ﬁsh was observed. james (1997) found age-0 bull trout in the diets of juvenile bull trout in indian creek. age-0 bull trout may switch to nocturnal activity when they become large and strong enough to better escape the threat of predation. this diel niche shift by age-0 bull trout is accom- panied by costs and beneﬁts that should be studi- ed to quantify the impacts on age-0 survivorship. water temperature is one of the main hypoth- eses responsible for a shift from a diurnal to nocturnal lifestyle in bull trout (jakober 1995; thurow & schill 1996) and other juvenile salmo- nids (fraser et al. 1993; valdimarsson et al. 1997). resident stream populations of char and trout change their habitats at the onset of winter when conditions in areas occupied during spring to autumn become unfavorable (northcote 1992). we found that bull trout counts decreased as temperatures decreased, and below 6.1 8c no age-0 bull trout were found during the day (fig. 2), which is consistent with other bull trout studies (jakober 1995; thurow & schill 1996; baxter & mcphail 1997). valdimarsson et al. (1997) suggests that energy requirements at low water temperatures allow stream salmonids to forage, exclusively at night. low metabolic rates during the winter can decrease a ﬁsh’s ability to quickly escape the threat of predation, and there- fore ﬁsh can reduce their risk of predation by hiding during the day when the risk from terres- trial predators is highest (fraser et al. 1993). night snorkeling has been recommended in many systems for sampling juvenile bull trout (goetz 1991; sexauer 1994; saffel & scarnecchia 1995; baxter & mcphail 1997); however, this method can be laborious and dangerous. day snorkeling for age-0 and juvenile bull trout may underestimate densities if surveys are conducted during the fall in cold water temperatures. we found 76.3% of age-0 bull trout in the shallow stream margins at night. since the highest densi- ties of age-0 bull trout were found in september and october (fig. 2), we recommend night foot surveys in the fall, in certain stream systems, for presence/absence studies or recruitment estimate studies. resumen 1. estudiamos el uso circadiano de microhabitat en puntos focales de juveniles (edad 0) de salvelinus conﬂuentus en indian creek (washington, usa), durante la mitad del verano y el oton˜ o de 1997. las variables ambientales incluyeron profundidad y velocidad del agua, distancia desde el fondo, uso de habitat y refugio, y tipo e implantacio´ n de sustrato. 2. los individuos de edad 0 fueron localizados sobre el sustrato mas ﬁno y grava de menor taman˜ o en aguas someras de baja velocidad cerca de las margenes pero fueron locali- zados en aguas mas someras durante la noche. los indivi- duos de s. conﬂuentus estuvieron altamente asociados con el sustrato y utilizaron la zona intersticial como refugio cubierto. 3. los conteos diurnos decrecieron, y ningun individuo de edad 0 fue observado, despues del 15 de septiembre a temperaturas menores de 6.1 8c. sin embargo, los conteos nocturnos permanecieron constantes a lo largo del estudio. nuestros resultados sugieren que los muestreos de individuos de edad 0 deben realizarse por la noche cuando las temper- aturas del agua en verano empiezan a declinar.
