kubecˇka et al. 1998; seda et al. 2000). despite their apparent similarities, reservoirs present numerous functional differences with natural their that hinder lakes comparison (wetzel 1990). reservoirs have larger inputs of nutrients and particulate matter and stronger water-level ﬂuctuation than natural lakes that lead to eutrophication and stress on their ecological commu- nities. although several large natural lakes in europe are well monitored and studied (paxton et al. 1999; gassner et al. 2003; perga & gerdeaux 2003), there are few studies directly relating water quality and ﬁsh assemblages in reservoirs (godinho et al. 1998; irz et al. 2002b). moreover, although indices of biotic integrity are well developed in streams (hughes & oberdorff 1999; oberdorff et al. 2002) and have been adapted to some u.s. reservoirs (hickman & mcdo- nough 1996; mcdounough & hickman 1999), the few studies available in lakes show that many of the traditional ﬁsh metrics do not respond well to known 66 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00123.x anthropogenic perturbation and will need considerable modiﬁcation and validation (schulz et al. 1999; wanzenbo¨ck et al. 2002; gassner et al. 2003). therefore, studies directly relating ﬁsh assemblages and water quality in european reservoirs are urgently needed, particularly in countries such as france (irz et al. 2002a) or the iberian peninsula, where there are numerous reservoirs but few natural lakes (except in high mountains above 1500 m of altitude). more than 1200 large reservoirs are in use in spain, mostly built in the second half of the 20th century and controlling about 40% of the total freshwater ﬂow (riera et al. 1992; granado-lorencio 1992). about 70% of spanish reservoirs were eutrophic or hypere- utrophic by 1992 (alvarez cobelas et al. 1992). the general limnology of many reservoirs is well known, including several comprehensive regional studies (margalef et al. 1976; riera et al. 1992), but they have generally not included the ﬁsh community, owing to methodological and ﬁnancial constraints. con- versely, although there are several studies of reservoir ﬁsh, mostly on aspects of growth, reproduction or diet of ﬁsh in a single reservoir, very few relate them to water quality data (granado-lorencio et al. 1985; sancho royo & granados lorencio 1988). the response of ﬁsh assemblages to variation in water quality in spanish reservoirs is thus largely unknown. the objective of our paper is to analyse the response of the ﬁsh populations at the community level to the variation in limnological features in a diverse set of contrasting reservoirs in northeastern spain. methods we studied the limnology and the ﬁsh assemblage of 14 reservoirs in catalonia (table 1), including some of the largest in catalonia (riba-roja, sant antoni, susqueda, fish assemblages in spanish reservoirs features of escales, la baells) and also some small reservoirs (santa fe, riudecanyes, foix) from small, coastal watersheds (fig. 1). the main physical and limnolog- ical the reservoirs are summarised in table 1. for each reservoir, we assembled the following general features: altitude, water capacity, age (construc- tion year), watershed surface, reservoir surface, water storage at the sampling period, mean water storage the year before sampling and residence time of water. we studied water quality in a sampling point always located at the principal axis of the reservoir and ca. 100 m from the dam from 29 january to 16 may 2003 (one day per reservoir). in every sampling point we made a physical proﬁle from the surface to the bottom with a multi-probe and we collected integrated water samples (0–8 m) for phytoplankton pigment analysis, using a plankton tube sampler. in the ﬁeld, we measured temperature, conductivity, ph, redox poten- tial, oxygen saturation and concentration, light energy in the photosynthetic radiation spectrum (400– 700 nm, li-cor li-193 sa) and nephelometric tur- bidity (turo technology pty ltd., water quality analyser t-611, sandy bay, tas., australia) at 0 m of depth and we took a water sample for chemical analysis. we also measured secchi disc depth. at the laboratory, the surface water sample was analysed for suspended solids, nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a contents. suspended solids were measured by ﬁltration (whatman gf/f glass microﬁ- bre ﬁlter of 47 mm, brentford, uk) and drying at 60 °c during 24 h. nutrient concentrations (total particulate nitrogen and phosphorous, soluble reactive phosphorous, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, chloride, sulphate and silicate) were measured by conventional spectrophotometric or chromatographic techniques. alkalinity was measured following the gran method (with an automatic metrohm titration apparatus). the table 1. physical and limnological features of the reservoirs studied. the water conductivity, alkalinity, total p and integrated chlorophyll refer to that of the study period. see fig. 1 for location of the reservoir. reservoir name reservoir code altitude (m) age (years) basin surface (km2) reservoir surface (ha) capacity (hm3) conductivity (ls/cm) alkalinity (meq/l) total p (lm) integrated chlorophyll 0–8 m (lg/m2) baells boadella camarasa escales flix foix riba-roja riudecanyes sant antoni sant ponc¸ santa fe sau susqueda terradets bae boa cam esc fli foi rib riu san spo sfe sau sus ter 630 159 336 821 41 101 70 118 501 530 1080 425 351 372 28 36 84 49 56 76 35 86 88 47 71 41 36 69 532 182 2850 152 82246 290 79177 31 2070 318 5 1564 1850 2620 367 364 624 400 320 71 2152 30 927 139 6 570 466 330 115.4 62.0 113.0 154.0 11.0 3.7 210.0 5.3 205.0 24.4 1.0 168.5 233.0 23.0 517 312 246 213 687 1270 684 476 222 431 38 592 491 236 3.25 2.79 1.80 1.77 3.26 4.63 3.26 2.72 1.71 3.00 0.39 3.02 2.60 1.79 1.12 0.48 1.72 0.41 1.51 10.70 1.64 0.77 1.51 0.34 0.89 3.51 2.33 1.46 7.29 24.22 12.39 4.09 2.99 443.34 11.57 19.81 6.22 15.17 110.21 82.93 21.76 9.14 67 carol et al. fig. 1. location of the 14 reservoirs studied in the catalan river network. chlorophyll a contents, collected on whatman gf/f glass microﬁbre ﬁlters, was analysed by using the trichromatic method (jeffrey & humphrey 1975). fish were sampled from the 14 reservoirs from 19 february to 6 may 2003 by daylight boat electroﬁsh- ing in the littoral and multi-mesh gillnets in the limnetic zone. the electroﬁshing boat was equipped with a 5.0-gpp smith-root inc. (vancouver, wa, usa) engine (providing up to 1000 v and 16 a) and two to nine transects of about 500–1000 m of distance were done in each reservoir depending on its size. catch per unit effort (cpue) of electroﬁshing tran- sects was computed as the number of ﬁsh caught per electroﬁshing time (provided by the engine in seconds) divided by 100. for each electroﬁshing transect the percentage of vegetation cover and percentage of refuge were also estimated. multi-mesh gillnets were 50 · 1.5 m in size with 10 panels of 5 m length with meshes ranging from 31 to 260 mm (stretched mesh). meshes were interspersed within the net (to avoid confusion of the mesh size with environmental gradients) and followed a geometric 68 progression (to optimise efﬁciency). depending on the reservoir surface, four to seven multi-mesh gillnets were set in each reservoir overnight at 10 m of depth in the water column or at the bottom. cpue of gillnets was computed as the number of ﬁsh caught per net. a total of 3618 ﬁshes from 19 different species (table 2) were captured, measured (total length to the nearest millimetre) and (most of them) released. data analysis the two matrices (ﬁsh abundance and limnological variables) were mostly analysed with ordination techniques. variables were analysed with both indirect (principal component analysis or detrended correspon- dence analysis) and direct (canonical correspondence analysis) gradient techniques. indirect gradient analy- sis only uses the species · sample matrix in the ordination whereas in direct techniques the ordination results are constrained to optimise their linear rela- tionship to the environmental variables (usually physicochemical). indirect and direct gradient analyses fish assemblages in spanish reservoirs table 2.

provide an ordination using the two matrices in a single analysis, indirect techniques are often more robust (mccune 1997) and can show species gradients because of unmeasured environmental variables. except for principal component analysis (performed with spss 12), the program canoco 4.5 (ter braak & sˇ milauer 2002) was used for all multivariate analyses, downweighting rare species and log-transforming species abundances and most environmental variables. canonical correspondence analysis (cca) was used as the direct technique because a detrended correspon- dence analysis (dca) showed that the ﬁrst axis had a gradient length larger than four standard deviation units, suggesting a long gradient and that a unimodal response model technique was preferable. the envi- ronmental variables in cca were selected using the forward selection of canoco, which tests the signiﬁ- cance of the variables with monte carlo permutation tests (499 permutations). for the environmental variables highlighted in previous analyses, we also ﬁtted generalised additive models (gams) (lepsˇ & sˇ milauer 2003), as available in the canoco program, to ﬁt the response of cpue of ﬁsh species to the environmental variables. gams are an extension to generalised linear models that, unlike more conventional regression methods, do not require the assumption of a particular shape for the species distribution along the environmental gradient (lepsˇ & sˇ milauer 2003; yuan 2004). the model complexity of gams was selected by the stepwise selection proce- dure using the akaike information criterion (aic), as available in canoco 4.5. aic considers not only models for goodness of ﬁt but also parsimony, penalising very complex models. species without an adequate candidate model (e.g., rare species for which there is no evidence of response to the gradient) are automatically deleted by this procedure. the relationship between ﬁsh diversity (total species richness and shannon’s index of diversity for both limnetic and littoral samples) with annual mean total phosphorus (p) was also assessed through linear correlation. results indirect gradient analysis two axes of the pca (fig. 2), many of the variables were interdependent and the ﬁrst respectively, explained 27.4% and 21.5 % of the total variation. the strongest correlations were between conductivity, alkalinity and oxygen and nutrient concentrations: srp-nitrite, r ¼ 0.84; srp-total n, r ¼ 0.84; srp- conductivity, 0.79 and altitude-nitrite, r ¼ )0.73. these variables were all positively correlated and opposed to altitude and secchi disc depth and mean depth. the ﬁrst pca axis summarised these correla- tions displaying a trophic state gradient, in part related to altitude, from the most eutrophic, lowland reser- voirs (foix, riudecanyes, sau and susqueda) to oligotrophic, higher altitude reservoirs (escales, sant antoni). at one extreme of the gradient, only foix reservoir is hypereutrophic, with severe problems of cultural eutrophication owing to human activity in the drainage basin (marce´ et al. 2000). 69 carol et al. 1.0 0.5 2 a c p 0.0 –0.5 oxygen % light surface reservoir water level eh

from the ebro river (riba-roja and flix) from the rest of reservoirs (fig. 2). these two reservoirs, in addition to a large basin surface, display different limnological features (higher values of per- centage of oxygen, light penetration, suspended sedi- ments, chlorophyll concentration and residence time) because of the high water ﬂow (ebro is the iberian river with most water ﬂow), which implies high turbidity and suspended sediments but low phytoplankton production. ph and turbidity, lower 70 two axes of respectively, the dca of the ﬁsh the ﬁrst assemblages, explained 32.5% and 6.7% of the total variation and suggested a quite different ordination of the reservoirs (fig. 3). the ﬁrst dca axis distinguished the two reservoirs where we detected chub (squalius cephalus), which dominated in santa fe, with several other introduced species (rutilus rutilus, perca ﬂuviatilis) in boadella reservoir. the second dca axis is similar to the ﬁrst pca axis and also distinguished the two most oligotrophic reservoirs (sant antoni and escales) that were dom- inated by native ﬁsh species considered intolerant to pollution and from cold water (mostly salmo_trutta, barbus haasi and phoxinus phoxinus). the most eutrophic (such as foix and sau) and the lower ebro river reservoirs take rather central positions in the dca biplot. direct gradient analysis: the relationship of ﬁsh assemblages with environmental variables of the environmental variables initially included in the cca, only ﬁve were retained by the forward selection procedure (fig. 4). the ﬁrst two canonical axes, respectively, explained 24.6% and 11.7% of the variance in ﬁsh species data. the ﬁrst axis was mainly associated with alkalinity, although this variable is also highly correlated with altitude (r ¼ )0.70, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.005) and nutrient concentrations (see pca discussed above). this ﬁrst axis mostly distinguished the dystrophic santa fe reservoir, which was strongly dominated in number by chub and was the reservoir at highest altitude and with least conductivity and alkalinity. the second cca axis distinguished eutro- phic reservoirs (mostly foix, sau and susqueda), with the highest values of chlorophyll and concentrations of ammonium and other nutrients. these eutrophic reservoirs were dominated by common carp (cyprinus carpio), other species highlighted by the cca such as eel (anguilla anguilla) and goldﬁsh (carassius aura- tus) being less abundant. a partial cca removing the effect of altitude (covariate) showed the same ordina- tion of species and reservoirs with trophic state, conﬁrming that part of this trophic gradient is not because of altitude (but because of cultural eutrophic- ation). the response curves of species abundance to altitude (fig. 5) and trophic state (fig. 6) conﬁrm these patterns of species composition. the response for electroﬁshing data with altitude agrees with the dca and shows native, cold water species (s. trutta, b. haasi, chondrostoma miegii and p. phoxinus) peaking at higher altitudes (fig. 5). the strong curve for s. cephalus is mostly because of the dystrophic santa fe reservoir. in contrast, common carp and eel

showed a unimodal response to chlorophyll (fig. 6) because of the dystrophic santa fe reservoir (with high concen- tration of chlorophyll but usually low nutrient con- centrations). even more convincing results are that the absolute abundances of common carp (present in the 14 reservoirs) are signiﬁcantly related to total phospho- rous concentration both for electroﬁshing/littoral and gillnet/limnetic samples, explaining about 40% of the variation (figs 7 and 8). very similar results were obtained for the relationship with chlorophyll concen- tration. therefore, not only the relative abundance of common carp but also the absolute abundance increa- ses with trophic state. diversity and richness measures despite the clear effects of trophic state on the ﬁsh assemblages, total ﬁsh species richness was not signi- ﬁcantly related to the annual mean of total phosphorus (fig. 9, r ¼ )0.36, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.20). similarly, the negative correlation of shannon’s diversity index with total p (fig. 10) is very low and not signiﬁcant for the littoral (r ¼ )0.13, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.66) and the limnetic zone (r ¼ )0.10, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.73). 72 0.0008 0.0007 0.0006 0.0005 0.0004 0.0003

linear regression analysis is also shown. discussion effects of trophic state on common carp abundance altitude and trophic state were the most important descriptors of variation of ﬁsh assemblages in catalan reservoirs. spatial changes in ﬁsh assemblage structure along the upstream–downstream physical gradient are well known (schlosser 1982, 1990; magalha˜es et al. 2002) and in most european rivers, ‘trout’, ‘grayling’, ‘barbel’ and ‘bream’ zones are recognised along the river continuum (cowx & welcomme 1998). in iberian rivers, however, ‘trout’, ‘barbel’ and ‘eel’ zones are rather distinguished (sostoa et al. 1990; foix fish assemblages in spanish reservoirs doadrio et al. 1991) because many central european species are not native to the iberian peninsula (garcı´a- berthou & moreno-amich 2000; vila-gispert et al. 2002). this latter pattern was also observed in catalan reservoirs, with brown_trout and other native species in headwater reservoirs, common carp, eel and roach in the lowest altitude reservoirs and other species in middle reaches. camarasa terradets riba-roja sant ponç altitude and trophic state of reservoirs are often correlated, as has been reported in portuguese reser- voirs (godinho et al. 1998). after latitude, altitude has been suggested as the second most important natural factor controlling phytoplankton production in lakes and reservoirs worldwide (brylinsky & mann 1973). in general, the nutrient concentrations and productivity of freshwater ecosystems increase along the river continuum and downstream reservoirs should be expected to be more eutrophic. however, in our study, altitude was signiﬁcantly related only to total n (r ¼ )0.62, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.018) and not to total p (r ¼ )0.38, chlorophyll (r ¼ 0.014, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.96). moreover, multivari- ate analyses allowed separating the differential effects of altitude and trophic state. most eutrophic reservoirs (that were of low altitude) were dominated by common carp (c. carpio) and secondarily other species such as goldﬁsh (c. auratus) and, if passage is possible, eel (a. anguilla). in artiﬁcial and stressed ecosystems such as reservoirs the role of altitude probably mediates less the trophic level than in natural lakes or other aquatic ecosystems. n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.19) or we found a strong, signiﬁcant relationship of the absolute and relative abundances of common carp with trophic state both in the littoral and limnetic zones (independently with electroﬁshing and gillnet data). lee & jones (1991) also suggested that in most eutrophic u.s. reservoirs common carp dominated and this condition was difﬁcult to reverse because of the well-known effects of carp of increased turbidity and decline of macrophytes (crivelli 1983; lougheed et al. 1998). the observed carp–trophic state relationship supports that the rest of patterns observed are not because of random variation in species composition but that the ﬁsh assemblage composition clearly reﬂects water quality, despite reservoirs being very ﬂuctuant ecosystems. the fact that common carp was present in all reservoirs, is extremely tolerant to pollution and has been introduced many decades ago explains why such a relationship may be found and suggests that carp may be a good indicator of environmental degradation. gido et al. (2000) have recently suggested that reservoir ﬁsh assemblages may be quite stable because their ﬁsh species are well adapted to stochastic events such as turbid inﬂows or ﬂuctuations in water level. our results agree with the classiﬁcation of brown_trout and minnow as intolerant and bleak as a tolerant 73 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 sant antoni sau riudecanyes susqueda 0.2 camarasa escales sant ponç riba-roja baells terradets flix boadella santa fe foix r 2 = 0.47 p = 0.007  s s e n h c i r l a t o t 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 flix susqueda = 0.078 2 r p = 0.33 escales camarasa boadella ribaroja sant ponç sant antoni terradets baells santa fe riudecanyes sau foix 8 10 20 60 100 400 40 80 200 susqueda 10 annual mean tp (mg·m–3) 100 fig. 9. relationship between total species richness (total number of ﬁsh species detected) and the annual mean concentration of total phosphorous (log scale). linear regression analysis is also shown. foix environmental degradation for the other ﬁsh species recorded. carol et al. ) t e n l l i g ( p r a c f  o e u p c ) e u p c t e n l l i g ( p r a c f  o % 0.0 100 80 60 sant antoni 40 riudecanyes sau sau sau sau camarasa 20 0 escales sant ponç baells riba-roja terradets terradets terradets terradets boadella santa flix fe r 2 = 0.29 p = 0.048 8 10 20 60 100 400 40 80 200 annual mean tp (mg·m–3) fig. 8. relationship of absolute (top) and relative (bottom) gillnet cpue of common carp with total phosphorous concentration. linear regression analysis is also shown. species (oberdorff et al. 2002) but question the classiﬁcation of chub as a tolerant species, and suggest that b. haasi and c. miegii (iberian endemics without previous published information) should be considered as intolerant species. eel, goldﬁsh and particularly common carp [species previously classiﬁed as without adequate information by oberdorff et al. (2002)] should be regarded as tolerant species. we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant evidence of variation in abundance with 74 the effects of reservoir age in the few comparative studies of ﬁsh in european reservoirs (kubecˇka 1993; argillier et al. 2002; irz et al. 2002b), age has been pointed out as an important factor, second to the altitudinal gradient, in the description of ﬁsh assemblages. for french reservoirs, water quality data were not available but it was suggested that eutrophication probably increased with age, affecting ﬁsh assemblages that were dominated by bleak and pikeperch in older reservoirs (argillier et al. 2002; irz et al. 2002b). kubecˇka (1993) suggested ﬁve successional stages in the ﬁsh assemblages of central and eastern european reservoirs, from a brief initial period with riverine species (specially, salmonids) and pike (esox lucius), followed by a perch (p. ﬂuviatilis) increase and ending with cyprinid domination. a succession from salmonids to percids and later cyp- rinids is general of european lakes along productivity gradients (persson 1991). however, age was not highlighted in our analyses as a primary factor governing ﬁsh assemblages, despite that trophic state has also been related to age in spanish reservoirs (margalef 1983). in fact, reservoir age was not signiﬁcantly related to total p (r ¼ 0.19, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.51) or to total n (r ¼ )0.04, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.89). we believe that this is because catalan reservoirs were uniformly older (mean ¼ 57 years, range ¼ 28–88, table 1) than french reservoirs ) x e d n i n o n n a h s ( y t i s r e v d i l a r o t t i l 2.00 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 ) x e d n i n o n n a h s ( y t i i  s r e v d c i t e n m l i 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 riudecanyes boadella 2 r = 0.050 p = 0.44 camarasa terradets susqueda sant antoni flix escales foix sant ponç ribaroja santa fe baells 10 sau 100 annual mean tp (mg·m–3) escales 2 = 0.051 r p = 0.44 camarasa riudecanyes sant antoni boadella sant ponç sau ribaroja susqueda foix baells santa fe terradets flix 10 100 annual mean tp (mg·m–3) fig. 10. relationship between shannon’s diversity index (log2) in the littoral top) and limnetic (gillnet captures, bottom) zones with the annual mean concentration of total phosphorous (log scale). linear regression analysis is also shown. (electroﬁshing captures, (mean ¼ 35, range ¼ 4–71). the transition in ﬁsh assemblages from the ﬁlling period to the cyprinid domination took no more than 10 years in the few reservoirs were it has been studied (kubecˇka 1993), explaining the relative unimportance of age in our study. therefore, small effects of age should probably be expected in reservoirs older than 10 years as ﬁlling but more long-term data, particularly in new or reﬁlled reservoirs, are needed to understand the historical dynamics of reservoir ﬁsh populations and its rela- tionship with water quality. richness and diversity of ﬁsh assemblages although we observed clear effects of water quality on the ﬁsh species composition of the reservoirs studied, there was no signiﬁcant effect of water quality on fish assemblages in spanish reservoirs overall ﬁsh richness or diversity (figs 9 and 10). fish richness was low (maximum of eight species detected per reservoir) and most of the species were introduced. french reservoirs below 1500 m of altitude had 9.1 species on average whereas in catalan reservoirs the mean was of 5.9 species. given the relatively low ﬁsh richness of mediterranean (moyle & marchetti 1999) and european (gassner et al. 2003) freshwater ecosystems and the biotic homogenisation character- istic of reservoirs (rahel 2002), ﬁsh richness should probably not be expected to covary with water quality. another indication of this fact is that despite the clear altitudinal effects on water quality and ﬁsh assem- blages, ﬁsh richness was not signiﬁcantly related to altitude either (r ¼ )0.37, n ¼ 14, p ¼ 0.19), as was also observed in french reservoirs below 1500 m of altitude (irz et al. 2002b, 2004). similarly to richness, shannon’s index of diversity (fig. 10) or evenness (not shown) for the littoral and the limnetic ﬁsh assemblage did not depend on altitude or total p either. other authors have shown that species composition and other ﬁsh community attributes than shannon’s index respond better to environmental degradation (angermeier & schlosser 1987) and thus a response of ﬁsh richness and diversity to variation in water quality should not be taken for granted in freshwater ecosystems. rather resumen 1. la relacio´n entre la calidad del agua y las comunidades de peces esta´ poco documentada en los embalses europeos, a pesar de tener gran importancia para su gestio´n y monitor- izacio´ n. 2. se muestreo´ la comunidad de peces de 14 embalses espan˜oles mediante pesca ele´ctrica desde embarcacio´ n en la zona litoral y con redes agalleras de luz mu´ ltiple en la zona limne´tica. simulta´neamente se recopilaron datos de ocho descriptores fı´sicos y se midieron veinte caracterı´sticas de calidad del agua de estos embalses. 3. ana´lisis multivariante (me´todos de ordenacio´ n y modelos generalizados aditivos) mostro´ que la altitud y el estado tro´ﬁco (indicado por la cloroﬁla o concentraciones de nutrientes) explican, de forma independiente, la mayor parte de variacio´ n de las comunidades de peces de estos embalses. los embalses ma´s eutro´ ﬁcos esta´n dominados por carpa (cyprinus carpio) mientras que en los embalses oligotro´ ﬁcos son ma´s abundantes otras especies intolerantes a la contaminacio´ n, principalmente nativas (como la trucha, salmo_trutta). 4. las abundancias absoluta y relativa de la carpa esta´n fuertemente relacionadas con el estado tro´ ﬁco de los embalses y un 40% de su variacio´n se explica por la concentracio´n de fo´sforo total. a pesar de los claros cambios en la composicio´ n de especies, no se hallo´ efecto signiﬁcativo de la calidad del agua en la riqueza o diversidad de peces, lo que sugiere que en estas comunidades con baja riqueza la composicio´ n de especies es mejor indicador de la eutroﬁzacio´ n antro´ pica que la diversidad de peces. 75 carol et al. acknowledgements we thank q. pou for ﬁeld assistance and c. argillier, p. irz and a. munne´ for helpful
