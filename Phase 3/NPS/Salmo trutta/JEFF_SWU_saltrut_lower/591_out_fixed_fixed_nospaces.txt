the same environmental factors proved to be important in both data type analyses. the environmental factors explain more variability than the regional (between-stream) one. the total proportion of variability explained by the presence–absence data analysis was 71.9% and in the relative abundance analysis even 80.8%. the environmental factors measured during the ﬁeld survey explain 2.1- and 3.4-times more assemblages’ variability than factors measured from a hydrological map. key words: mid-sized streams;

oberdorff et al. 1993, 2001; lyons 1996; belanger 1997; angermeier & winston 1999; marsh-matthews & matthews 2000; moyle et al. 2003). variability in ﬁsh assemblages is generally inﬂu- enced by landscape features (angermeier & winston 1999), by the stream size or elevation (schlosser 1982; lyons 1996; brown 2000) or by stocking of econom- ically important ﬁshes (the brown_trout, grayling, carp, and pike) (pivnicˇka & humpl 2004). both indirect and direct multivariate gradient analyses are now frequently used to identify and explain how environmental gradients affect the distribution of ﬁshes (godinho et al. 2000; ero¨s et al. 2003; moyle et al. 2003) and their simultaneous use has often yielded the most appropriate results (maret 96 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00126.x et al. 1997; angermeier & winston 1999; ero¨s et al. 2003). the statistical robustness of these methods has been evaluated (ter braak & sˇ milauer 2002). if conditions, headwater reaches are highly variable, while more downstream environmental not anthropogenically inﬂuenced, are generally less ex- treme (ostrand & wilde 2002). evaluation of the impact of environmental variables on ﬁsh in protected areas (pa), which have little human inﬂuence, seems therefore more simple. however, construction of ponds, management with salmonids in headwaters or with carp more downstream cannot be overlooked. in this paper we analyse ﬁsh assemblages in three streams (the tepla´, luzˇicka´ nisa and ostruzˇna´ rivers) located in different protected areas where human inﬂuence is minimised by law. we hypothesise that: (i) ponds and stream manage- ment do not signiﬁcantly change the ﬁsh assemblages; (ii) using presence–absence or relative abundance data of ﬁsh and measuring the environmental factors directly in situ or from a hydrological map, inﬂuences the variability of ﬁsh assemblages equally. material and methods study sites study sites were located on three mid-sized (four to ﬁve order) streams in pa – the tepla´ river in pa slavkov forest, the luzˇicka´ nisa river in pa jizera mountains, and the ostruzˇna´ river in pa sˇ umava. they are situated in the west, north and southwest bohemia respectively (fig. 1). the basic information on the streams studied is in table 1. the major parts of the streams pass through highlands with prevailing forest stands and permanent grasslands. human activ- ities are minimised in these watersheds. sampling regime thirty-one sites regularly distributed in longitudinal proﬁles were selected to cover all the important habitats. the sites on the tepla´ were sampled in fish assemblages and environmental factors table 1. the basic information on the streams. tepla´ luzˇicka´ nisa ostruzˇna´ stream source altitude (m.a.s.l) stream mouth altitude (m.a.s.l) stream length (km) mean stream slope (mækm mean ﬂow in the stream mouth (m3æs higher order stream sites ﬁshed )1) )1) 784 370 64 6.47 3.1 ohrˇe 13 765 235 55 9.64 5.4 odra 8 938 452 39 12.46 1.2 otava 10 2002–2003, on the ostruzˇna´ in 2001–2002 and on the luzˇicka´ nisa in 2000. in total, 3312 specimens of 18 ﬁsh species were caught in tepla´, 1283 specimens of 15 ﬁsh species in luzˇicka´ nisa and 1848 specimens of nine ﬁsh species in ostruzˇna´ river. fished sections were minimally 100 m long. in all cases ﬁsh were collected by at least a three-person team using the honda gx 120 backpack electroﬁshing gear (1.8 kva; radomir bendar, olomouc, czech republic). the stream sections were ﬁshed by wading in two passes with comparable effort (30–40 min). the ﬁsh relative abundance (number of caught ﬁsh per 100 m2) is given in table 2. data analysis in many cases, only the species presence–absence data are available when temporal variability of older and recent data is to be evaluated. thus it is very helpful to know the differences of assemblage patterns when the presence–absence and/or the relative abundance data are used. the effect of extreme values was minimised by transforming the species relative abundance data by log (x + 1) and the inﬂuence of rare species by the evaluation only of species found at twice. altogether 19 species were used in the analyses (table 3). least table 2. the ﬁsh relative abundance expressed as the number of caught ﬁsh per 100 m2. site no. tepla´ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 16.80 4.64 46.66 45.01 15.26 12.56 8.55 5.66 8.21 18.65 18.69 3.80 2.13 s 2 4 5 11 12 3 5 5 5 9 8 7 6 luzˇicka´ nisa 22.81 5.24 7.72 8.09 1.29 4.39 7.69 10.99 – – – – – s 1 5 6 6 4 6 8 7 – – – – – ostruzˇna´ 44.17 16.07 30.38 30.83 31.30 17.89 30.52 33.62 26.23 18.70 – – – s 3 2 4 3 4 5 7 6 4 4 – – – fig. 1. map of czech republic showing the location of studied streams. the sites are arranged according to their increasing distance from the source (s, the total number of species). 97 humpl & pivnicˇka table 3. the list of ﬁsh species, their scientiﬁc and common names and the abbreviations used. scientiﬁc name abbreviation common name luzˇicka´ nisa tepla´ ostrunzˇna´ lapl anguilla anguilla l. anan barbatula barbatula l. babt carassius carassius l. caca cogo cottus gobio l. cyca cyprinus carpio l. eslu esox lucius l. gogo gobio gobio l. gymnocephalus gyce cernuus l. lampetra planeri bloch 1784 leuciscus cephalus l. lece leuciscus leuciscus l. lele lolo lota lota l. oncorhynchus_mykiss onmy walbaum 1792 peﬂ perca ﬂuviatilis l. rutilus rutilus l. ruru salmo_trutta m. fario l. satr safo salvelinus_fontinalis mitchill 1814 thymallus_thymallus l. thth tinca tinca l. titi european eel x stone loach x crucian carp x x bullhead x carp x pike x gudgeon ruffe x brook lamprey chub dace burbot rainbow trout x perch roach x brown_trout x brook_trout x x grayling tench x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x we used an indirect ordination method of gradient analysis (detrended correspondence analysis, dca) with the aim to identify the strongest gradient of assemblage composition independently of the environ- mental variables we measured. based on the dca sites’ ordination we also assessed between-stream differences in the ﬁsh assemblages. the direct gradient canonical correspondence analysis (cca) was then used for the evaluation of the variability in assemblage structure in relation to the selected environmental factors. the regional variability of assemblages (between-stream variability) was accounted for in the ﬁrst cca. then in the second cca (within-stream), the inﬂuence of the measured environmental factors was shown, while the effect of between-stream variability was partialled out (eliminated). step-wise forward selection of environ- mental variables available in canoco was used to choose the most inﬂuential factors. the individual effect of each signiﬁcant environmental factor was detected in partial ccas. in these analyses the residual effect of each individual factor was tested, while the effects of the other signiﬁcant factors were (together with the between-stream variability) partialled out as covaria- bles. multivariate statistical analyses were performed using canoco version 4.5 (ter braak & sˇ milauer 2002); for the correlation analysis statistica soft- ware was used (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa). fifteen environmental factors measured both from a hydrological map of the czech republic (1:50,000) and in situ during the ﬁeld surveys, were available for the study. to reduce the high number of variables, 98 relationships among all the environmental factors were ﬁrst tested by correlation analysis using spearman’s rank order correlation coefﬁcients (rs). only the factors with rs < 0.3 (a < 0.05) were retained in the analyses. four factors were eliminated (catchment area, stream order, number of settlements in the watershed and maximal depth). ‘increasing’ eleven environmental factors were ﬁnally used for the analyses. four of them were measured from a map, the other seven during ﬁeld surveys (table 4). the number of ponds was counted in the catchment up to a distance of 5 km above the given site. we deﬁned a pond as an artiﬁcial reservoir of minimally one to maximally hundreds of hectares, fed mostly by a small stream. ponds are used for rearing carp, together with tench and pike. in some ponds several species of coarse ﬁsh (gudgeon, perch, roach, stone loach, crucian carp and minnow) occur and can invade into their diversity. mean stream streams, width was the average of measurements made in three different positions situated in the beginning, middle and at the end of each ﬁshed section (ﬁve times each). mean depth was measured at the same positions, at each position ﬁve measurements equally distributed in a diagonal proﬁle were made. current velocity was the average stream current velocity in the site measured using a simple ﬂoat. when evaluating the channel type we differentiated among natural channel (1), channel with adjusted banks (0.5) and completely regulated channel (0). the quality of the cover was assessed according to the presence or absence of the following: boulders and scoured banks (1), scoured banks only (0.5) and none (0). substratum type is a ﬁve-state variable which describes proportions (%) of all table 4. environmental factors measured from map and during ﬁeld survey in situ. environmental variable unit/categories abbreviation used map distance from the source elevation stream slope number of ponds in situ mean channel width mean depth current velocity channel type cover substratum type land use )1 km m.a.s.l. )1 mækm value m m mæs 1/0.5/0 1/0.5/0 %boulders %stones %gravel %sand %silt permanent grassland permanent grassland with trees forest km elevation slope ponds width depth velocity channel cover %bo %st %gr %sa %si pg pg+t f individual bottom substratum categories on each site. land use was classiﬁed as a three-state categorical variable containing permanent grassland (1,0,0), per- manent grassland with trees (0,1,0) or forest (0,0,1). results fish assemblage gradients (dca) presence–absence data the ﬁrst two ordination axes of dca explain 35.2% variability of ﬁsh assemblages. on the ﬁrst axis (20.5%) to right reﬂected the gradient of assemblage change in the longitudinal proﬁle. the second axis gradient (14.7%) reﬂects the variability caused by unidentiﬁed environ- mental factors (fig. 2a). the species sequence from left to heighten the differences between the streams, the distribution of individual sites in the ordination space is arranged anew in fig. 2b. this arrangement shows the more prominent difference of the ostruzˇna´ river sites. the salmonid character of the ostruzˇna´ river (table 3) plays a role; all the ostruzˇna´ sites are situated at the beginning of the longitudinal gradient reﬂected by the ﬁrst axis. the less prominent difference in the position of the tepla´ and luzˇicka´ nisa sites relates to the size and lower altitude of the watershed of both rivers. anan lece lele gyce titi cogo satr thth eslu ruru cyca caca lolo babt pefl safo gogo onmy dca axis 1 6 (a) 4 i 2 s x a a c d  lapl 2 – –2 (b) 0 2 . 2 i  s x a a c d fish assemblages and environmental factors relative abundance data the ﬁrst two dca axes explain 42.5% of species composition in ﬁsh assemblages (fig. 3a). the ﬁrst axis (32.7%) reﬂects a gradient of assemblage change in the longitudinal proﬁle similar to the previous analysis. as in the previous analysis (fig. 2a), the brook lamprey (lampetra planeri bloch 1784), brown_trout (salmo_trutta m. fario l.) and bullhead (cottus gobio l.), followed by the rainbow trout (oncorhyn- chus mykiss walbaum 1792), burbot (lota lota l.) and grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.) represent typical species of the upper parts of the streams (fig. 2a). the second axis (9.8%) gradient again is not deﬁnitively understood from the species data only. in the site’s distribution diagram (fig. 3b), the more prominent difference of the ostruzˇna´ river sites can again be observed; sites are located in the beginning of the longitudinal gradient within the ﬁrst axis gradient. the separation of the tepla´ and luzˇicka´ nisa river sites is more extensive than in the presence–absence data analysis (fig. 2b). the longest gradient of the dca was 3.109 sd (standard deviation units of species turnover) for the (a) 5 gyce anan pefl 2 i  s x a a c d cogo satr thth lele lolo ruru titi lece cyca caca eslu lapl safo babt gogo onmy dca axis 1 5 3 – –2 (b) 5 . 2 i 2 s x a a c d  . 5 0 – 5 . 0 – –0.5 dca axis 1 3.5 –1.0 dca axis 1 4.0 fig. 2.

assemblages and environmental factors all six signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) environmental factors (distance from the source, elevation, number of ponds, channel type, substratum type, and land use) further explain 58.3% of total ﬁsh assemblage variability; 22.5% variability was already explained by the between-stream differences. the individual effects of environmental factors were: substratum type (16.31%, p < 0.0006), land use (7.80%, p < 0.0072), channel type (6.22%, p < 0.0003), number of ponds (3.92%, p < 0.0011), elevation (2.55%, p < 0.0234) and dis- tance from the source (2.50%, p < 0.0288). discussion as can be seen in the diagrams, the ﬁrst two axes in the indirect gradient analysis (dca) always represent the two most inﬂuential environmental gradients of ﬁsh assemblage variability (figs 2 and 3). from the ﬁsh species sequence on the ﬁrst ordination axis it can be reasoned that this axis reﬂects the stream longitud- inal gradient of ﬁsh assemblage change. this was evident similarly for both presence–absence and relative abundance data. the brook lamprey, bullhead and brown_trout are species that occur nearest to the stream source. all the other species appear succes- sively in the lower parts. at the very end of the gradient, species such as common carp (cyprinus carpio l.), crucian carp (carassius carassius l.), tench (tinca tinca l.), and roach (rutilus rutilus l.) appear. their occurrence is often inﬂuenced by their escaping from carp ponds or by their regular stocking by ﬁshermen. a continuum in assemblage composi- tion in a longitudinal proﬁle was also observed in a central european submontane stream (ero¨s et al. 2003). marsh-matthews & matthews (2000) observed signiﬁcant changes in assemblage composition (sum- marised as a sample score on two axes of dca) as a function of local and broad geographical factors in a midwestern stream of the usa. streams, the variability between the already detected by dca (figs 2b and 3b), was conﬁrmed by the direct gradient method (cca); this pattern was similar in both types of data analysed. there was no important difference, even though the relative abun- dance gives extra information on the similarity of assemblages (poff & allan 1995). during the direct gradient analysis (within-stream cca), environmental variables having signiﬁcant effect (p < 0.05) on the ﬁsh assemblages were always selected. having analysed the presence–absence data it was found that ﬁsh assemblage structure is most signiﬁcantly affected by number of ponds and land use. these environmental factors are the most closely correlated with the ﬁrst ordination axis, so they affect the principal gradient forming the ﬁsh assemblages most intensely (fig. 4, table 5). the second strongest 101 humpl & pivnicˇka gradient represented by the second ordination axis is best depicted by substratum type and elevation. the partial analyses (cca) showed that substratum type individually explains the variability in ﬁsh assemblage structure to the greatest extent. the occurrence of many ﬁsh species in streams is dependent on the characteristic habitat type, where the proportions of the individual categories of substratum type are its important components (lyons 1989; doughty & maitland 1994; pires et al. 1999). having analysed the relative abundance data it was found that the ﬁsh assemblage structure is also signiﬁcantly affected by the number of ponds and land use. these environmental factors correlate well with the ﬁrst ordination axis (fig. 5, table 6). dis- tance from the source and channel type explained well the second strongest gradient, which is represented by the second ordination axis. the partial cca analyses showed that substratum type explains the greatest variability in ﬁsh assemblages like in the presence–absence data analysis. the three most inﬂu- ential factors explaining the variability to the greatest extent (substratum type, land use and channel type) were measured in situ. just it was shown that the direct gradient analysis also gave very consistent results for both types of data. the same environmental factors appeared to be important both in the presence–absence and the relative abun- dance data analyses. the factors having no signiﬁcant effect on the assemblages were stream slope, stream width, depth, current velocity and cover. analyses of both the presence–absence and the relative abundance data showed that number of ponds is one of the most important environmental factors inﬂuencing ﬁsh assemblages in the tepla´, luzˇicka nisa and ostruzˇna´ rivers. this has already been ascertained in many czech streams (pivnicˇka 1998; pivnicˇka & humpl 2004). other important factors explaining a large proportion of the variability are land use, substratum type and channel type. generally, it is known that the presence of ﬁsh or their relative abundance is often related to the distinct types of including bottom substratum type (lyons habitat 1989; doughty & maitland 1994; pires et al. 1999; angermeier & davideanu 2004) and land use (schlosser 1991; maret et al. 1997; angermeier & winston 1999; wang et al. 2001). the signiﬁcant effect of channel type has also been observed for relative abundance data (lyons 1996; angermeier & davideanu 2004). factors (50.7%/58.3%) it was conﬁrmed that ﬁsh assemblages vary more signiﬁcantly according to the changes in environmen- tal than according to the regional (between-stream) variability (21.2%/22.5%) for presence–absence/relative abundance data respect- ively. this was also conﬁrmed by marsh-matthews & 102 matthews (2000) who demonstrated that the assem- blage composition may vary most as a function of environmental and landscape factors. generally, presence–absence and relative abun- dance data of ﬁsh gave similar results in both dca and cca analyses; the same environmental factors proved to be important in both data type analyses. the overall variability explained in the presence–absence data analysis was 71.9% (50.7 + 21.2); in the relative abundance analysis it was even 80.8% (58.3 + 22.5). therefore, summarising results of both types of data analysed we can say that the environmental factors explain ﬁsh assemblage variability slightly more effectively together with the relative abundance data than with the presence–absence data. the environmental factors measured directly in situ explain 2.1-times more variability (map 14.4%, in situ 30.9%) and with the relative abundance data even 3.4- times more (map 9.0%, in situ 30.3%). the factors measured from the map give only an average picture about the environment, whereas the values measured directly in situ reﬂect the actual state of the inﬂuence of environment on ﬁsh. the role of the factors measured in a map should, however, not be underes- timated. poff & allan (1995) pointed out that large- scale patterns are best detected with coarse-grain data. for ecological communities, relative abundance data provide ﬁne-grain information because they emphasise local peaks in species performance, while species presence–absence data emphasise a coarser grain of environmental tolerance (rahel 1990). the results can be used for the prediction of the structure and species composition of ﬁsh assemblages. expected changes can be assessed on the basis of the measurable environmental variables. as far as ﬁsh management affects the majority of streams, we can also assess the effect of stocking on species diversity and relative abundance. both types of information are important for ecologists, conservationists and ﬁsh managers. resumen 1. tres rı´os de taman˜o comparable localizados en diferentes a´reas de paisaje protegido de la repu´ blica checa fueron seleccionados para estudiar el

entre los ensamblajes de peces de los tres rı´os. este patro´ n fue conﬁrmado por un cca altamente signiﬁcativo. para la variabilidad dentro de la localidad, un cca revelo´ que los factores ambientales explicaron un 50.7% para datos de presencia-ausencia y un 58.3% para las abundancias relativas. 3. los ana´lisis revelaron que el nu´ mero de pozas y el uso del suelo fueron los factores de mayor inﬂuencia en el gradiente ambiental. sin embargo, en el cca parcial, el tipo de sustrato explico´ la mayor proporcio´n de la variabilidad que afecta a los peces en la eleccio´n de ha´bitat. 4. generalmente los datos de presencia-ausencia y abundancia relativa produjeron resultados similares tanto en los ana´lisis dca como en los cca; los mismos factores ambientales probaron ser importantes en los ana´lisis de ambos tipos de datos. los factores ambientales explicaron mas variabilidad que los regionales (entre rı´os). la proporcio´n total de variabilidad explicada por el ana´lisis de los datos de presencia-ausencia fue 71.9% mientras que para las abundancias relativas fue de 80.8%. los factores ambientales medidos durante los muestreos de campo explicaron 2.1 y 3.4 veces mas variabilidad que los factores medidos sobre mapas hidrolo´ gicos. acknowledgements we acknowledge the help of dr josef krˇı´zˇek during all ﬁeld operations. the research was funded by the
