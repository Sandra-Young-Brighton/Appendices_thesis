persson & greenberg 1990; hambright et al. 1991; mehner et al. 1995, 1996a). predator-prey relation- ships and inter-cohort cannibalism are further in- teractions affecting the structure and dynamic of ﬁsh communities (turner & mittelbach 1990; persson 1991; persson 1993; olson et al. 1995; persson & eklöv 1995; olson 1996). in this sense, 236 cannibalism and intra-cohort predation among 0„ ﬁsh are regularly found for true piscivores, such as the species of the genus esox or stizostedion (e.g. densen 1985; jacobsen & perrow 1998). perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) normally undergoes an onto- genetic niche shift, initially being plankton feeders as larvae and small juveniles, later becoming ben- thos-feeders, and from a certain body size, shifting to a piscivorous diet as yearlings and adults (thor- pe 1977; persson & greenberg 1990). however, there are some reports of cannibalism and pre- dation by larger 0„ perch (.40 mm total length) on 0„ cyprinids (smyly 1952; il’ina 1973; spanov- skaya & grygorash 1977; thiel 1989; mehner et al. 1996b). the ﬁrst information that perch larvae (10.5–20.7 mm body size) are also able to prey on perch and cyprinid fry was derived from labora- tory experiments by brabrand (1995). the author suggested that piscivory in perch larvae can sup- port rapid growth, becoming large enough to pre- date and potentially regulate the later hatching cy- prinids. based on the results of brabrand (1995), our aim was to study the predator-prey relationship be- tween 0„ perch and 0„ bream. we want to get a ﬁrst indication whether predation of 0„ perch could be a factor affecting the structure and dy- namic of the ﬁsh community of lake speldrop, a eutrophic lake in the ﬂoodplain of the river rhine, where perch and bream for the experiments were caught. material and methods lake speldrop (7 ha, 16 m maximum depth), from where perch and bream for the experiments stem from, is a typical gravel-pit lake at the lower rhi- ne between emmerich and rees (germany), where mining ended about 30 years ago. the substrate of the bank is dominated by sand, gravel and rubble, and submergent vegetation is nearly absent. the eutrophication at lake speldrop has reached a very high level. the phosphate values (e.g. 29/7/ 3») near the bottom 1998 at 14 m: 3.7 mg/l po4 during the summer stratiﬁcation were higher than described previously in our region (cf. berndt 1989). this nutrient supply supports algal pro- ductivity (chlorophyll a concentrations in the sum- mer of 1997 were around 50 mg/l, heinze personal communication), and to an extended anaerobic hy- polimnion (e.g. at the beginning of july: from the bottom up to 7 m depth). young perch (mean size 29.8”2.6 mm tl) from lake speldrop (caught with a beach seine net) were used for two series of laboratory experiments at a temperature of about 19(cid:190)c. to minimize hand- ling stress for the juvenile ﬁsh at the start of the experiments, only a sample of perch was measured to the nearest mm (tl) and the ﬁsh weight was calculated using the length-weight regressions of mehner et al. (1995). in the ﬁrst series starting at the beginning of june, the perch were put in 20-l aquaria together with roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)) of 23.7 mm tl (”1.5 mm). because roach were rare in lake speldrop, they were caught at a small channel nearby. four aquaria were used for each of the three perch:roach ratios (1:7, 4:4 and 7:1), and two of each of the four aquaria were fed with a ‘high amount of zooplankton food’ (hazf), and the other two with a ‘low amount of zooplank- ton food’ (lazf). this series of experiments last- ed for 30 days. the second series of experiments started also at the beginning of june and lasted for 20 days. in this series, the young perch were combined in 10 l aquaria with bream (abramis predation of 0„ perch on 0„ bream brama l.) larvae of 13.7 tl mm (”0.9 mm, for the ﬁrst 10 days) and later on 18.8 mm tl (”1.1 mm). the bream were also caught with a beach seine net at lake speldrop. the ratio of perch: bream in the experiments was 1:7, 4:4 and 7:1, with 10 aquaria for each of the three ratios. for each ratio, ﬁve aquaria were fed with hazf and ﬁve with lazf. all ﬁsh were counted twice daily at the feeding times and missing breams were re- placed (roach were not eaten). at the end of all experiments, the perch were measured and weigh- ed. in the statistical analysis (using spss 7.5), the t-test for paired samples (2-tailed signiﬁcance level) was used to compare means of ﬁsh sizes. daily zooplankton samples from lake speldrop served as food for the young ﬁsh. each day, the main zooplankton organisms of a sub-sample were counted and the total number of organisms was calculated for the complete catch. this complete catch was divided into 10 parts, from which one part was used for the lazf experiments and the remaining nine parts for the hazf experiments. the daily zooplankton part for the lazf (same procedure as for the hazf) was now divided into the number of aquaria with this condition and fed twice daily (9.00 and 21.00). at the end of all ex- periments, all daily zooplankton countings were averaged for the whole experimental period. in re- lation to the number of ﬁsh in each aquarium, the ﬁsh of the lazf condition were fed each day with an average of 13 (”5) rotatoria, 59 (”25) clado- cera, 19 (”10) copepoda and 8 (”5) other zoo- plankton organisms. thus, the concentration at the start of each feeding time was e.g. •24 clado- cera per liter (59 cladocera * 8 ﬁsh/2 feeding times/ 10 liters of aquarium). the number of food organ- isms per ﬁsh was nine times higher for the hazf. results because our study focused on the predator-prey relationship of 0„ perch on 0„ bream, the ﬁrst series of experiments with perch and roach served mainly as a control. in this series, the roach were about 24 mm and the 30 mm perch had no chance of attacking them successfully. thus, only zoo- plankton served as food during the 30 days of the experiment. regularly, the zooplankton in each aquarium was eaten during the ﬁrst hours after the feeding time. although there are no quantitative measurements, a few observations lead to the im- pression that perch were more successful in feeding on zooplankton, especially during the ﬁrst min- utes, and on larger organisms (e.g. cladocera). this may be one reason why roach showed nearly no increase in size during the 30 days of the experi- ment and averaged 24.3 mm tl (”4.3 mm). this 237 t‰6.28, n‰5, p‰0.003) and a maximum tl of 37.6 mm (4:4 hazf: t‰14.24, n‰5, p,0.001). in addition, the length increase at a perch:bream ratio of 4:4 was signiﬁcantly higher than at a ratio of 7:1 (lazf: t‰4.67, n‰5, p‰0.01; hazf: t‰4.44, n‰5, p‰0.011). the amount of zooplankton fed had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence, neither at the 7:1 ratio (t‰0.91, n‰5, p‰0.415), the 4:4 ratio (t‰1.78, n‰ 5, p‰0.15), nor at the 1:7 ratio (t‰1.3, n‰5, p‰ 0.264). at the perch:bream ratio of 1:7, perch fed on bream in varying quantities, averaging between three and nearly 12 bream per day per individual. after 20 days, this resulted in a mean perch tl of 54.4 mm at the lazf, and 50.4 mm at the hazf. these values were always signiﬁcantly higher than the tl of the other experimental groups (all p at least ,0.01). the distinctly higher standard devi- ation of both experimental groups (hazf and lazf) at the ratio of 1:7 is notable. for these perch, both the increase in length and in weight was signiﬁcantly correlated to the number of bream eaten per day by an individual perch (fig. 3). those perch which ate only a few bream were of smaller size at the end of the experiment than those which ate up to 12 bream per day. because there were no signiﬁcant differences in the ﬁnal perch sizes at the end of the experiment in relation to the different zooplankton food levels, borcherding et al. length (”standard deviation, vertical fig. 1. total lines) of perch after 30 days living together with roach at different ratios. fish were fed with either a ‘‘low amount of zooplankton food’’ or a ‘‘high amount of zooplankton food’’. the size of the perch at the start of the experiment is marked with a horizontal line. equals a growth rate of 0.02 mm ` day»1. the sizes of the perch are drawn in fig. 1. in the lazf experiment the tl of the perch increased slightly from an average of 29.8 mm to 31.7 mm, 32.9 mm and 35.5 mm, depending on the number of perch in each aquarium. highest growth rates occurred in the tanks with only one perch. in comparison to the perch of the lazf experiments, those of the hazf were slightly, but not signiﬁcantly, larger (p.0.05). as there were no signiﬁcant dif- ferences between the experimental groups, the mean growth rate of the perch feeding only on zooplankton was 0.17”0.071 mm ` day»1 (n‰12). for this experiment, as well as for the following one, the tendencies in change of length were also valid for the weight. calculated in the second series of experiments (fig. 2) the 0„ perch (starting size 29.8 mm tl) fed on bream (13 to 20 mm tl) and zooplankton. at a ratio of 7:1 and 4:4 all bream were caught (and replaced) twice a day. the tl of these perch increased sig- niﬁcantly at both food levels within 20 days from 29.8 mm to a minimum tl of 32.7 mm (7:1 lazf: at length (”standard deviation, vertical fig. 2. total lines) of perch after 20 days living together with bream at different ra- tios. the perch preyed on the bream, and in addition, all ﬁsh were fed with a ‘‘low amount of zooplankton food’’ or a ‘‘high amount of zooplankton food’’. the size of the perch at the start of the experiment is marked with a horizontal line. 238 fig. 3. the relationship between body size of individual perch and consumption rate (mean no. of bream per perch per day), calculated as linear regressions for the length (above) and weight (below). growth rates were calculated as the mean for both zooplankton food levels together: perch:bream ratio 7:1, 0.16”0.054 mm ` day»1 (n‰10); perch: bream ratio 4:4, 0.35”0.071 mm ` day»1 (n‰10); perch:bream ratio 1:7, 1.13”0.276 mm ` day»1 (n‰10). discussion in contrast to what is known on piscivory of adult ﬁsh and juveniles of true piscivores (e.g. pike), there is little knowledge on the piscivory of juvenile perch, which regularly feed on zooplankton or macro- zoobenthos (c.f. persson 1986; persson & greenberg 1990). a few studies presented ﬁeld data in which stomach analysis revealed that 0„ perch had fed on smaller larvae of perch and some cyprin- ids (smyly 1952; il’ina 1973; spanovskaya & grygo- rash 1977; thiel 1989). in order to estimate the in- ﬂuence of early piscivory on the structure of a ﬁsh community, mehner et al. (1996a, b, c) calculated the predation mortality of 0„ pikeperch and perch due to predation from 0„ ﬁsh at about 25–50%. all authors reporting on 0„ perch predation and cannibalism named size differences between prey and predator of about 50% as a main pre- requisite (e.g. densen 1985; brabrand 1995), mainly due to gape limitations. size differences of ﬁsh larvae in a certain situation are due to differ- ent spawning/hatching times (mostly temperature dependent) as well as to the variability in growth. brabrand (1995) reported that even a difference of 24 h in hatching produced a two-peak size distri- bution, in which the intra-cohort variation was large enough to create the potential for intensive cannibalism. at the start of our experiments, the size of perch was twice as large than that of the bream, depending on the different hatching times of both species in lake speldrop (heinze, personal communuation). thus, the experimental situation for perch and bream equalled that in lake speld- rop. the roach for the ﬁrst (control) series of ex- periments were about 24 mm tl, and thus, not available as prey for the perch. consequently, the growth rate of perch in the ﬁrst series of experi- ments (0.17 mm ` day»1) depended only on the number of zooplankton organisms, which were available in the intra- and/or interspeciﬁc compe- tition with roach. in comparison to highest growth rates of 0„ perch feeding on zooplankton ob- tained from the literature (perch larvae of about 12 mm tl feeding on zooplankton: about 0.62 mm ` day»1, recalculated after weight values of byström & garcia-barthou 1999), we assumed that the zooplankton levels in our experiments were too low to enable higher growth rates for the 30 mm perch. predation of 0„ perch on 0„ bream in relation to the addition of two bream per seven perch per day to the zooplankton food, the growth rate remained on the same level, but in- creased up to 1.13 mm ` day»1 with increasing numbers of bream available as prey (14 at a perch: bream ratio of 1:7). we considered 14 bream per perch per day to be an ad libitum prey level in our experiments, because the maximum number of bream predated on per day was about 12 (fig. 3). comparable consumption rates on ﬁsh larvae of perch between 10.5 and 20.7 mm body size were estimated by brabrand (1995). feeding conditions. the maximum growth rate of perch feeding ad libitum on bream (in addition to zooplankton) demonstrated the growth abilities of perch under optimal increasing growth rates in relation to piscivory of 0„ perch were also observed in ﬁeld data obtained by mehner et al. (1996a). according to polis & holt (1992), a diet shift to piscivory early in life could be advan- tageous for a single individual, since a piscivorous ﬁsh can directly reduce the density of potential in- tra- and interspeciﬁc competitors. furthermore, the intensiﬁed growth caused by early piscivory gives the potential to prey on food not available to inter- and intraspeciﬁc competitors, e.g. in relation to gape-size limitations (hartmann 1986; ham- bright et al. 1991; tonn et al. 1992). both (1) the increasing survival rates due to increased size (de- angelis et al. 1979; rice et al. 1993) and (2) the development of precocious males in the largest perch ﬁngerlings (spanovskaya & grygorash 1977) support the idea that a strong selection for rapid growth exists (brabrand 1995), which indeed could be the result of early piscivory. how far intra-cohort cannibalism and pre- dation of 0„ perch occurred at lake speldrop, and if, to what extent these perch reduce the number of 0„ cyprinids during the summer, is unknown. given the high level of eutrophication of lake speldrop, we expected to ﬁnd a ﬁsh community dominated by zooplanktivorous cyp- rinids (persson et al. 1991; kubecka 1993). how- ever, our ﬁrst investigations on the adult ﬁshes of lake speldrop (until now we have no quantitat- ive data) showed a piscivores-dominated com- munity. in consideration of our ﬁrst results and estimates of mehner et al. (1996a, b, c), two ob- servations from lake speldrop support the idea that predation of 0„ perch might be an import- ant factor affecting the structure and dynamics of the ﬁsh community of lake speldrop: (1) al- though the old cyprinids reproduce every year and 0„ cyprinids are found in large numbers after hatching, regularly no 0„ cyprinids are found at the end of the summer. (2) the size of the few 0„ perch caught at the end of july 1998 239 borcherding et al. at lake speldrop were in the range of 75–90 mm tl. starting with an average length of about 30 mm in the beginning of june, this equals growth rates of about 0.8–0.9 mm day»1. regarding the maximum growth rates of perch larvae feeding on zooplankton (byström & garcia-barthou 1999) and our results, sizes like this could only be reached if these perch were piscivorous. in or- der to understand this early piscivory of 0„ perch, its relationship to the habitat structure, how far laboratory results are also valid in the ﬁeld, and to what extent 0„ perch piscivory af- fects the structure and dynamics of ﬁsh com- munities will be the aim of our future research. resumen 1. para investigar effectos de la predacio´n de perca ﬂuviatilis sobre abramis brama, llevamos a cabo experimentos de labora- torio empleando larvas y juveniles de ambas especies proceden- tes del lago speldrop, un lago de gravera altamente eutroﬁzado de la llanuras del bajo rio rin. 2. en la primera serie de experimentos (control), los individuos 0„ de p. ﬂuviatilis de 30 mm de longitud total no predaron sobre los individuos 0„ de a. brama de unos 24 mm de longi- tud, sino que se alimentaron exclusivamente de zooplancton, dando como resultado tasas de crecimiento bajas (0.17 mm ` dia»1). en una segunda serie de experimentos, combina- mos percas de 30 mm con a. brama de longitudes comprendi- das entre 14 y 19 mm, en distintas proporciones. 3. de forma similar a la serie control, en la segunda serie de experimentos, densidades de zooplancton nueve veces mayores no inﬂuyeron de forma signiﬁcativa en el crecimiento de p. ﬂu- viatilis, independientemente de la proporcio´n de ambas especies p. ﬂuviatilis:a. brama. a proporciones 7:1 y 4:4, a. brama fue consumida totalmente por p. ﬂuviatilis y hubo que reponerlas dos veces al dı´a. al ﬁnal del experimento, las longitudes de p. ﬂuviatilis sujetas a proporcio´n 7:1, fue´ signiﬁcativamente menor que la de los individuos sujetos a proporcio´n 4:4 (tasas medias de crecimiento: 0.16 mm ` dia»1 a proporcio´n 7:1 y 0.35 mm ` dia»1 a proporcio´n 4:4, respectivamente. 4. a proporcio´n 1:7, p. ﬂuviatilis se alimento´ de a. brama en cantidades que variaron entre 3 y 12 por individuo y dı´a. des- pue´s de 20 dı´as, la longitud ﬁnal de estos individuos fue´ siempre signiﬁcativamente mayor que la longitud de p. ﬂuviatilis sujetos a otras proporciones, e incremento´ en correlacio´n al nu´mero de a. brama consumidos por dı´a (tasa media de crecimiento 1.13 mm ` dia»1). 5. los resultados son discutidos en relacio´n a la comunidad de peces dominados por piscivoros del eutroﬁzado lago speldrop. acknowledgments our thanks are due
