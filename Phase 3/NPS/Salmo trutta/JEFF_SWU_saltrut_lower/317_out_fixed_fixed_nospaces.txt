(2002) found a strong negative correlation between the discharge rate during the emergence period and density of s. trutta aged 0+, probably caused by the loss of 0+ ﬁsh due to the inability to maintain their stream position when water discharge is high: at high population density only 116 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00203.x factors yearlings that ﬁnd a shelter survive, while the others are ﬂushed away by ﬂoods. their study thus suggests that there can be an interaction between exogenous and endogenous or density-dependent in determining the survival of brown_trout during the ﬁrst year of life. recently, lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´n (2004) provided evidence of the importance of stream discharge on recruitment in a population of s. trutta living in rio chabatchos (spain); the results obtained by cattaneo et al. (2002) and lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´n (2004) appear to conﬁrm the context-dependent importance of density-dependent and -independent factors, the latter predominating in harsh environ- ments. the assessment of the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous factors in the regulation of population dynamics and ﬁsh recruitment is particu- larly difﬁcult for stream-living salmonids in nonex- perimental settings. moreover, in species exhibiting high plasticity in body growth like salmonids not just survival but also body growth and size at sexual maturity can be affected by density-dependent mechanisms; population density can thus also inﬂu- ence the reproductive output (i.e., number of eggs produced), as fecundity is usually correlated with body size in salmonids. as argued by jenkins et al. (1999) observational data and time-series analyses are often insufﬁcient to detect endogenous mechanism regula- ting population dynamics and should be complemen- ted by experiments in which environmental variation is minimised or controlled for and density ranges from very low to very high values. the aim of the present work is to test the hypothesis of density-dependent survival in the ﬁrst year of life translocated marble trout salmo_marmoratus for (cuvier 1817) populations in two pristine slovenian streams, combining observational data and simulation analysis. marble trout is a species of particular conservation interest, being endemic only in a restric- ted geographical area belonging to the adriatic basin, in particular in the basin of po river in northern italy (sommani 1961; forneris et al. 1990), in the adriatic basin of former yugoslavia (povz 1995) and albania (schoffmann 1994). since the beginning of the last century (the ﬁrst documented case dates back to 1906, povz et al. 1996), s. trutta of different origins have been introduced into the geographical area where marble trout occurs. the introduction of s. trutta quickly led to the creation of hybrid populations (berrebi et al. 2000) which displaced the native ones. at present, only eight pure marble trout populations were discovered in isolated streams in the upper reaches of the soca and idrijca river basins in slovenia (berrebi et al. 2000; snoj et al. 2000). here we report on a 9-year on-going study of translocated pure marble trout populations in two slovenian streams, designed with the purpose of exploring the population dynamics density-dependence survival in marble trout of the endangered species marble trout (for a full report on the marble trout rehabilitation project refer to crivelli et al. 2000). the investigation of density- dependent survival of newly emerged trout is per- formed by combining a classical life table analysis (dempster 1983; stiling 1988; sinclair 1989; auer- bach et al. 1995) with simulations following a monte carlo approach. material and methods study area and species description the marble trout rehabilitation project started in 1993 in the upper part of the idrijca river basins belonging to the adriatic basin of slovenia (fig. 1). the idrijca river basin presents a well-preserved environment, that is, remarkable quantity and quality of water, reduced agricultural and industrial activities, absence of erosion due to numerous deciduous forests – mainly fagus sylvatica – low human population density and numerous areas ofﬁcially protected, such as the triglav national park. fly ﬁshing is one of the main attractions for tourists and one of the most proﬁtable economic activities in the region, attracting many anglers from abroad. marble trout is the only ﬁsh species present within both the experimental streams (gorska and zakojska), both located in headwaters and with no predation or ﬁshing activities. streams length and topographical features were acquired from surveyor ﬁeld investigations and from available gis (source: surveying and mapping authority of the republic of slovenia). habitat features of zakojska and gorska are presented in table 1. the streams can be divided in sectors (11 in gorska, seven in zakojska) separated by impassable waterfalls, so trout can only move from upstream sectors to downstream sectors. the stream bed of gorska consists mainly of bedrock slides and is narrower than that of zakojska and its ﬂood plain is almost absent, with few shelter areas. on the contrary, in zakojska, in case of ﬂood the stream can overﬂow its bank on a wide area with riparian forest creating new suitable habitat for marble trout. rainfall data has been acquired since 1961 (arso, environmen- tal agency of slovenia). the annual mean precipi- tation is 2400 mm with october and november being the most rainy months. annual rainfall in the study period ranged from 1764.5 mm in 2003 to 2495.7 mm of 2000. monthly rainfall in march was extremely variable ranging from 0.9 mm during the severe drought of 2003 to 479.5 mm of 2001. in april a threefold variation was observed during the study period, ranging from 119.7 mm in the 2002 to 362.8 mm in 1999. 117 vincenzi et al. fig. 1. map showing the location of salmo_marmoratus populations introduced in gorska and zakojska. the soca and idrijca river basins lie in the northwestern part of slovenia and belong to the adriatic basin. table 1. main habitat features of zakojska and gorska, from spring to downstream close to the lowest part of the experimental stream with pure marble trout. main features zakojska gorska watershed characteristics watershed area (m2) stream length (m) land average slope (%) surface stream average slope (%) experimental stream characteristics length (m) surface area (m2) pool surface (m2) (% of total surface) altitude range (m.a.s.l.) number of sectors benthos biomass (mg m)2) 62,600 2480 60.65 22.5 1238 3544 895 (25.3) 578–728 7 14,638 21,900 1940 64.35 22.8 845 1805 685 (38) 400–514 11 11,446 loggers water temperature of the streams was recorded with recording temperature (optic stoneway model; onset corporation, bourne, ma, usa) at hourly intervals. annual average water temperature during the study period in gorska and in zakojska varies between 8.2–9.0 and 7.6–8.2 °c, respectively. marble trout present a high plasticity in growth rates; individuals of marble trout with weight up to 25 kg have been found in the lower reaches of the soca river (fumagalli et al. 2002) while in the study area the maximum recorded weight was 520 g. in the study area, maximum recorded age for marble trout was 6 years. marble trout feed generally on bottom-dwelling organism and cannibalism by adult marble trout was observed. spawning takes place in 118 november to december while marble trout eggs hatch generally in march, with emergence occurring in april to may. data and direct observation in streams of soca and idrijca river basins where pure marble trout occurs show evidence of a certain amount of repetition in reproduction (iteroparity). sampling procedure and data collection in 1994, wild genitors from one of the remnant pure populations (zadlascica) were taken in november, stripped in the hatchery and put back to their stream. fish produced were reared for 1 year and then stocked in 1996 in two ﬁshless streams of the baca river basin – zakojska and gorska – isolated from the hybridi- sation zone by natural impassable waterfalls. each released individual was marked with carlin tags that do not affect survival and growth of marked ﬁsh (kolari et al. 1998). since 1996, an annual monitoring program has been carried out in order to assess the long-term persistence and the population dynamics of those translocated pure populations. sampling was performed every june from 1996 to 2004 on the whole length of each stream starting from downstream to the upstream extent, consequently the whole population is sampled every year. a gasoline-powered, portable backpack electroﬁshing unit was used. every stream was electroﬁshed two times to produce a multiple-pass removal estimate of trout abundance using microﬁsh 3.0 (van deventer & platts 1989). age designation follows standard terminology; marble trout in the ﬁrst year of life were denoted as 0+ and in the second year, subsequent to winter annulus formation, as 1+. all captured ﬁsh aged ‡1+ were anaesthetised with benzocaine, marked with carlin tags made in sweden (institute of freshwater research), measured for total length (lt, to the nearest mm) and weight (w, g) and if sampled for the ﬁrst time the adipose ﬁn was removed. then marble trout were returned alive near the point of capture. age was determined by tag examination. at ﬁrst marking, scales were taken to assess the age of the ﬁsh. the small size of marble trout aged 0+ prevents their sampling in june and therefore they are not taken into account in this study. no sexing of trout caught could take place at that time of the year. marble trout hatched in the streams aged 1+ were sampled each year from 2000 to 2004 included. as no data on stream ﬂow were available, rainfall was used as surrogate of stream discharge. monthly rainfall were recorded at rut precipitation station, the nearest one available to both streams, for the whole period of the study (1996–2004). in order to estimate fecundity, 33 wild females – aged from 3 to 5 years old – from the zadlacisca pure population were stripped in the ﬁsh farm (tolminka, tolmin, slovenia). females were put back to their stream after stripping. an density-dependence survival in marble trout assessment of successful spawning of pure marble trout living in the study area using paternity investigation showed as minimum and maximum age for spawning for marble trout females 3 and 5 years old, respectively. first spawning occurs at a minimum length of 200 mm. all females aged 3+ and 4+ and exceeding 200 mm spawn successfully. approximately 20% of marble trout females aged 5+ spawn successfully, with spawn- ing probability being independent of body length. length–fecundity relationship we estimated a linear relationship between body length l and number of eggs f(l) produced by a female, such as: fðlþ ¼ a þ bl þ eð0; reþ ð1þ where e is a normal error with mean equal to zero and variance re estimated through least square regression on available data along with the slope b and the intercept a. marble trout density density of marble trout at the stream level was computed by dividing the total or age-speciﬁc number of marble trout estimated from multiple-pass removal by the overall pool surface of the stream, as it offered the best quantiﬁcation of instream areas suitable for marble trout. difference in mean marble trout density between streams during the study period was tested by kruskal–wallis test. survival r0 survival r0 from eggs to age 1+ was estimated by using the age–cohort data sampled in the two streams between 1998 and 2004 as described hereafter. let nxðtþ be the estimated number of marble trout (males + females) aged x in the reproductive phase (3+ £ x £ 5+) at year t, n1þðt þ 2þ is the estimated number of marble trout aged 1+ at year t + 2, that is, the progeny of marble trout which successfully spawned 2 years before. according to ﬁeld observa- tions and experiments performed in the ﬁsh farm, marble trout aged less than 3 years old or smaller than 200 mm are assumed not to be reproductive yet. the fraction of x years old females (3+ £ x £ 5+) that actually spawn is indicated with bx, sex ratio is assumed to be 1:1. thus, for each year for which data are available (t ¼ 1998, 1999,…2002), the expected number ^sxðtþ of x years old females actually spawning nxðtþ. as sampling campaigns was computed as 0.5bx take place in june, eggs laid in the late autumn of year t by ^sxðtþ ¼ 0:5bx nxðtþ reproductive females hatched in early spring of year t + 1 and n1þðt þ 2þ yearlings 119 vincenzi et al. were then sampled as 1+ in june of year t + 2. r0 was thus computed as the ratio between n1þðt þ 2þ and the estimated total number of eggs ^eðtþ laid in year t. in order to estimate the number of eggs laid by each reproductive female, information on the actual female length is required. as sampled marble trout were not sexed, we used the observed age-speciﬁc discrete distribution kðl=x; tþ of length l of marble trout sampled in year t to derive information on female length by means of a monte carlo approach, as described here after: 1 a set of length values li(x,t) [i ¼ 1,2,…, ^sxðtþ] was drawn randomly from the observed age- speciﬁc discrete distribution k(l/x,t);

(2002), who found a negative correlation between water discharge and yearling survival. our hypothesis is that the relation- ship we found can be explained by the fact that in zakojska the scarce availability of suitable habitats is a limiting factor for yearling settlement and survival. as a consequence, the positive relationship between rainfall and r0 could be related to the increasing availability of suitable microhabitat for juveniles with increasing rainfall, at least in the range of rainfalls observed in the study period. this does not happen in gorska, where, given the morphological features of the stream, higher water ﬂows do not provide an increasing availability of suitable microhabitat for juveniles. on the other hand, we believe extreme river ﬂows may determine a reduction of r0, by ﬂushing away or killing young marble trout. this is what actually happened in mid-october 2004 in gorska when a debris ﬂood – probably with a time of return of 50 years – wiped out the entire population of juveniles and adults as observed during our sampling campaign in june 2005, when no trout was found in gorksa. in zakojska, subject to the same rain pattern of gorska, the population maintained almost the same size as before the ﬂood. this shows that stream and watershed features and the resulting hydrological regime may be important determinant of the observed pattern of population dynamics. anyway, as the results are based on a limited time series of data, our preliminary conclusions on the role of stream ﬂow (of which rainfall is a surrogate) on survival during the ﬁrst year of life of marble trout need to be conﬁrmed by further analysis on a longer time series of data. as noted by rose et al. (2001) a promising trend is the recent focus 122 results highlight on how the interaction between environmental stoch- astic ﬂuctuations and density-dependent processes regulates the long-term dynamics of ﬁsh populations. our the importance of density- dependent and environmental factors in determining the survival of marble trout during the ﬁrst year of life; as recruitment is one of the major determinants of population size in salmonids (e.g., lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004), we believe our ﬁndings could signiﬁ- cantly enhance the comprehension of marble trout population dynamics and the effectiveness of rehabil- itation projects. acknowledgements the authors thank two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on a earlier draft of this manuscript. the authors thank the italian minister of research for having partially supported the present work under an internationalisation project. references allen, k.r. 1969. limitations on production in salmonid populations in streams. in: northcote, t.g., ed. symposium on salmon and trout in streams. british columbia, canada: university of british columbia, institute of fisheries, pp. 3– 18. auerbach, m., connor, e. & mopper, s. 1995. minor miners and major minors: population dynamics of leaf-mining insects. in: cappuccino, n. & price, p. eds. population dynamics: new approaches and synthesis. san diego, ca: academic press, pp. 83–110. berrebi, p., povz, m., jesensek, d. & crivelli, a.j. 2000. the genetic diversity of native, stocked and hybrid populations of marble trout in the soca river, slovenia. heredity 85: 277– 287. cattaneo, f., lamouroux, n., breil, p. & capra, h. 2002. the inﬂuence of hydrological and biotic processes on brown_trout (salmo_trutta) population dynamics. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 59: 12–22. chapman, d.w. 1966. food and space as regulators of salmonid populations in streams. american naturalist 100: 345–357. crivelli, a.j., poizat, g., berrebi, p., jesensek, d. & rubin, j.f. 2000. conservation biology applied to ﬁsh: the example of a project in slovenia. cybium 24: 211–230. rehabilitating the marble trout for dempster, j. 1983. the natural control of populations of butterﬂies and moths. biological reviews 58: 461–481. einum, s. 2005. salmonid population dynamics: stability under weak density dependence?
