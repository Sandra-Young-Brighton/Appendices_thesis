coregonus_pidschian; spawning movements; radio telemetry; chatanika river introduction humpback whitefish coregonus_pidschian is a com- mon coregonid in the interior of alaska and is dis- tributed throughout many of the river drainages of the beaufort, chukchi and bering seas (mcphail & lindsey 1970; alt 1979). this species is also found in several river systems south of the alaska range, including the copper and susitna rivers (alt 1979). whitefishes are important for many northern commu- nities where they are harvested in commercial, sport, personal-use and subsistence fisheries (alt 1979; hallberg & bingham 1994; woody & young 2006; brase 2010). despite the utilisation of these fishes, very little is known about their life history (reist & bond 1988; fleming 1996). in general, whitefishes are long-lived, iteroparous, broadcast spawners with diverse life histories (e.g., amphidromous, riverine and lacustrine; reist & bond 1988). these fishes may occupy many spatially and temporally separated habitats and engage in temporally segregated migra- tions (reist & bond 1988). management of whitef- ishes is often complicated because they exhibit a considerable degree of variation in life-history strate- gies and because there is a lack of information on the movement patterns and critical habitat areas for most stocks (alt 1979; reist & bond 1988; fleming 1996; brown et al. 2002; woody & young 2006). information on movement patterns and the loca- tions of critical habitat areas is important to help guide the management of exploited fish populations (schmetterling 2001; meka et al. 2003; waters & noble 2004; daugherty & sutton 2005; woody & young 2006). schmetterling (2001) studied the sea- sonal movement patterns of westslope cutthroat trout to guide restoration oncorhynchus clarki efforts and to gain a better understanding of this spe- cies in western montana; this study was able to pro- vide valuable information to the managers of the sport fishery and highlighted the importance of lewisi correspondence: t. m. sutton, school of fisheries and ocean sciences, university of alaska fairbanks, 905 n. koyukuk drive, fairbanks, ak 99775, usa. e-mail: tmsutton@alaska.edu †present address: alaska department of fish and game, 43961 kalifornsky beach road suite b, soldotna, ak 99669, usa doi: 10.1111/eff.12079 295 dupuis & sutton maintaining movement corridors. by examining the seasonal movement patterns and habitat use of flat- head catfish pylodictis olivaris, daugherty & sutton (2005) were able to show that the availability of structure and main-channel pool habitats are impor- tant considerations in the management of this species. without a thorough description of seasonal move- ment patterns, critical habitat areas and vulnerable movement corridors will remain ambiguous and unprotected. although several studies have examined the move- ments and habitats of whitefishes in the interior of alaska, current movement patterns and locations of important habitats of humpback whitefish in the min- to flats–chatanika river complex remain largely unknown (kepler 1973; townsend & kepler 1974; fleming 1996; brown et al. 2002; brown 2006). net surveys (kepler 1973; townsend & kepler 1974) and a radio telemetry study (fleming 1996) have indicated that humpback whitefish were present in the wetland complex of minto flats in late spring, dispersed from minto flats into the chatanika river in summer and were present at spawning areas in the chatanika river by september. this information pro- vides an adequate description of seasonal movement patterns and spawning areas for humpback whitefish in the chatanika river through the mid-1990s; how- ever, a current description of humpback whitefish dispersal patterns and spawning areas is not available even though this species is harvested in a recently reopened personal-use fishery. in the 1970s, a spear fishery began for humpback whitefish and least cisco coregonus_sardinella in the chatanika river; this fishery, which targets these fish in their spawning areas in the fall, became popular and harvest increased through the 1980s (mills 1987). in response to high harvests in the fishery, the alaska department of fish and game (adfg) initi- ated annual abundance estimates (hallberg & holmes 1987). these surveys indicated the declining numbers of humpback whitefish and least cisco, and the fish- ery was closed from 1990 to 1991 and from 1994 to 2007 (brase 2010). the spear fishery reopened in 2007 and was prosecuted at a low harvest level to account for the many unanswered questions relating to whitefish life history in this system. the reopening of the spear fishery led the adfg to identify a need to have more current and refined information on the dispersal patterns and spawning area distribution for humpback whitefish in the fig. 1. map of the minto flats–chatanika river complex and a portion of the tanana river near fairbanks, alaska. the shaded areas indi- cate: (a) the chatanika river spawning area in 2008 and 2009;

hallberg et al. 1986; t. m. sutton, university of alaska fairbanks, unpublished data). methods fish capture humpback whitefish were captured in the chatanika river from june through august 2008 and in the min- to flats complex in early june 2009 (fig. 1). fish were captured using single-mesh monofilament gill nets (4-cm stretch mesh; 15 m long and 2.5 m deep) and variable-mesh multifilament experimental mesh gill nets (three 7.5-m panels with 30-, 51-, 76-mm stretch mesh, 22.5 m long and 2.5 m deep), hoop nets (1-m-diameter hoops covered with 2.5-cm mesh and two 15-m leads) and fyke nets (two rectangular frames 1.2 m high 9 2.0 m long covered with 38.1- mm mesh, and a single 7.6-m lead). gill nets were humpback whitefish spawning movements deployed perpendicular to the bank and monitored continuously. when a fish was observed striking the net, it was immediately removed to limit stress and mortality. hoop and fyke nets were fished in suitable habitat types (e.g., cutbanks, entrances to sloughs, pools and riffles) and were checked every eight hours. radio telemetry coded radio transmitters (model f1835; advanced telemetry systems, inc, isanti, minnesota) were sur- gically implanted into humpback whitefish. transmit- ters were 17 mm in diameter, 44 mm long, 14 g in weight and had a battery life of 265 days. all trans- mitters operated in the 149-mhz frequency range. transmitters were programmed to transmit continu- ously from activation at 55 pulses per minute (ppm) for the life of the transmitter. upon capture, fish were measured for fork length (fl) to the nearest 1 mm, placed in an aerated hold- ing tub full of water and examined for physical injury and stress. a lack of sexual dimorphism in this species prevented the determination of sex. only uninjured humpback whitefish larger than 360 mm were used for tagging because male and female fish are generally considered to be mature at this size (alt 1979; clark & bernard 1992; fleming 1996; how- land et al. 2000). no transmitters were implanted when water temperatures exceeded 16 °c due to the potential for high mortality rates (morris et al. 2000). humpback whitefish were anesthetised using a 20–30-mg/l clove oil solution. transmitters were sur- gically implanted following standard methods; a com- plete description of the surgical methods used in our study can be found in dupuis (2010). after surgery, fish were placed in a tote containing aerated fresh water, allowed to recover and then released at least 100 m from the site of capture. fish positions were determined through a combina- tion of boat and aerial surveys and fixed receiving (tracking) stations. boat-tracking surveys were con- ducted in an upstream direction from the murphy dome access road to approximately 20 km above the elliot highway bridge, encompassing 116 km (fig. 1). when water levels in the chatanika river dropped in mid-september, tracking surveys were restricted to running downstream from the elliot highway bridge, covering approximately 70 km. boat surveys were conducted at least once a week from august through early october in both years. two tracking stations operated continuously on the chatanika river in 2008; a third tracking station was added on the tolovana river in 2009 (fig. 1). three aerial surveys were flown in fall 2009 over the minto flats–chatanika river complex and the tanana river during the expected spawning time (alt 1979). sur- 297 dupuis & sutton vey aircraft flew at 200–500 m elevation at approxi- mately 90 knots. while there is the potential for relo- cation bias in these surveys, we believe that the standardisation of tracking surveys limited the poten- tial for bias. information on the date, transmitter signals were detected using a three- element yagi and omnidirectional whip antenna (advanced telemetry systems, inc). when a fish was detected, time, fre- quency, channel code, signal strength, and the lati- tude and longitude was recorded with an ats r4500c receiver (advanced telemetry systems, inc). the rf gain (a control used to adjust the sensi- tivity of the receiver) was maintained at a setting of five throughout all surveys to maintain consistency in the recorded signal strength. data analyses to analyse the fall movements of humpback white- fish, the latitude and longitude of the capture loca- tions and subsequent relocations of each fish were plotted on a map of the minto flats–chatanika river complex using arcmap 9.3 (environmental systems research institute, redlands, california). during boat-tracking surveys, it was determined that fish locations could be identified to within 100 m of the true location; therefore, movement was defined as a fish moving more than 100 m in either the upstream or downstream direction between successive reloca- tions. fish were classified as potential mortalities if movement from the capture location was not detected during the tracking period. humpback whitefish were divided into two catego- ries: spawners and nonspawners. spawners dispersed upstream from capture locations to areas of river that exhibited characteristic whitefish spawning habitat (as identified by the presence of swift current veloc- ity, riffles and gravel bars in the river; alt 1979; fleming 1996; brown 2006) or to areas previously identified as whitefish spawning areas in previous studies (kepler 1973). nonspawners did not disperse to these areas of river. spawning areas were identi- fied as the areas of river where the spawners ended their upstream dispersals. movements were described according to the fol- lowing four 2-week periods in both 2008 and 2009: 15–31 august (late august), 1–15 september (early september), 15–30 september (late september) and 1–15 october (early october). these periods were chosen because not every fish was relocated at weekly intervals; however, most fish were relocated within each two-week period. the horizontal dis- placement of each fish was determined by measuring the distance (km) between the site of capture and the most distant relocation following the centre of the 298 river channel. the total time at liberty from capture to the most distant relocation was determined by counting the number of julian days; for the purposes of this study, the term at liberty is defined as the unrestricted movement of fish following the implan- tation of radio transmitters. the median dates of fish movements past each tracking station in 2008 and 2009 were found to determine run timing in the cha- tanika river. a two-tailed t-test was used to compare the fork length of captured fish between 2008 and 2009 and to compare the fork length of captured fish between the two capture locations in 2009. results in 2008, 60 humpback whitefish were surgically implanted with radio transmitters. six transmitters were deployed between 19 june and 29 july, and the remaining 54 transmitters were deployed over an 8-d period between 5 and 14 august. between 29 may and 7 june 2009, 100 humpback whitefish were sur- gically implanted with radio transmitters in the two sampling areas within minto flats. no radio-tagged fish were recaptured during the tagging events. the mean fork length of tagged humpback white- fish was 464 mm (range, 414–515 mm) in 2008 and 457 mm (range, 420–532 mm) in 2009. there were no significant differences between the observed fl fish captured in 2008 and 2009 (t = 1.56, of d.f. = 158, p = 0.12). further, no significant differ- ences were detected between the observed fork lengths of fish captured in the two sampling areas in 2009 (t =  1.36, d.f. = 98, p = 0.17). in 2008, 576 relocations of tagged humpback whitefish were made, and individual fish were relo- cated an average of 11 times (sd = 4). in 2008, boat surveys and tracking stations detected 98% (59 of 60) and 62% (37 of 60) of tagged humpback white- fish. in 2009, 729 relocations of tagged humpback whitefish were made, and individual fish were relo- cated an average of eight times (sd = 6). in 2009, boat surveys, aerial surveys and tracking stations detected 48% (48 of 100), 85% (85 of 100) and 80% (80 of 100) of tagged humpback whitefish, respec- tively. a lack of movement from the time of capture through the tracking period identified 12 humpback whitefish as possible mortalities in 2008 and seven in 2009. in 2009, three humpback whitefish were har- vested in the fall spear fishery and one transmitter was recovered near a bald eagle haliaeetus leuco- cephalus nest in minto flats. spawning areas in 2008, 39 fish were classified as spawners in the chatanika river. the spawning area was located (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) late august late august humpback whitefish spawning movements early september early september late september late september early october early october ) s n o i t a c o l e r f o r e b m u n ( y c n e u q e r f 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 20 river kilometer (rkm) 0 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 fig. 2. frequency distribution, by river kilometre (rkm), of relocations of radio-tagged humpback whitefish in 2008 (left panel) and 2009 (right panel), recorded from early august to early october in the chatanika river, alaska. dashed lines indicate: (a) confluence with the tolovana river;

n = 39; fig. 3) and were at liberty for an average of 68 day (range, 48–93 day; n = 39). conversely, in 2008, the nonspawning humpback whitefish showed an average horizontal displacement of 13 km in the chatanika river (range, 3–41 km; n = 9) and were at liberty for an average of 17 day (range, 6–34 day; n = 9). during 2009, spawning humpback whitefish exhib- ited an average horizontal displacement of 127 km in the chatanika river (range, 101–184 km; n = 39; fig. 3) and were at liberty for an average of 110 day (range, 78–127 day; n = 39). the nonspawners in 2009 exhibited an average horizontal displacement of 63 km in the chatanika river (range, 19–88 km; n = 15) and were at liberty for an average of 75 day (range, 8–115 day; n = 15). fish that dispersed out of the minto flats–chatanika river complex in 2009 showed an average horizontal displacement of 294 km (range, 168–346 km; n = 30; fig. 3). with only a maximum of two relocations per fish in the tanana river, the number of days at liberty was not determined. it should be noted that a comparison of the horizontal displacement between chatanika river spawning humpback whitefish captured in 2008 and 2009 is not advised due to the different capture loca- tions used in both years. in 2008, the median dates of upstream movement past the shovel creek and the trans-alaska pipeline tracking stations were 29 august (range, 11 august–18 september) and 9 sep- tember (range, 27 august–25 september), respec- the median dates of upstream tively. movement past the tolovana river, shovel creek and the trans-alaska pipeline tracking stations were 19 june (range, 1 june–10 july), 21 june (range, 14 june–18 september) and 24 august (range, 2 august–20 september), respectively. in 2009, discussion the addition of our movement data to the informa- tion collected in previous studies provides a more to begin their dispersal complete account of the seasonal movement patterns of humpback whitefish within the minto flats–cha- tanika river complex (kepler 1973; townsend & kepler 1973; fleming 1996). this study showed that humpback whitefish are present in the lake complex of minto flats after ice out in mid-may. fish exit the lake complex in early june and enter the chatanika river towards upstream spawning areas. fish disperse upstream in the cha- tanika river throughout the summer and arrive on spawning areas near the elliot highway bridge by early september. reproductive biology sampling con- ducted in 2008 tracked gonadal development through the summer and fall; this sampling revealed that fish engaged in upstream dispersals were mature and in spawning condition by mid-september (dupuis & sutton 2011). spawning is believed to take place in late september and early october and is followed by downstream movements to overwintering areas beginning in early october. some humpback white- fish also emigrate from minto flats and disperse into the tanana river. these fish exit the lake complex of minto flats in early june and are present at spawning areas in the tanana river in early october. our study represents the first documented account of humpback whitefish exiting the minto flats–chatanika river complex. similar study is the dispersal of humpback whitefish reported in our to the movement patterns described for other populations of coregonids found at northern latitudes (reist & bond 1988; howland et al. 2000; brown et al. 2002; harris & howland 2005; brown 2006; harper et al. 2007). whitefishes from the lower mackenzie river, northwest territo- ries (reist & bond 1988), travaillant lake system, northwest territories (harris & howland 2005), and the upper tanana river, alaska (brown et al. 2002; brown 2006), exhibit spawning dispersals from feed- ing areas to spawning areas beginning in early sum- mer. fish arrive at or near spawning areas by late august, spawning occurs from late september to early october, and downstream movements follow spawning activity. the parallels between these results and our study could indicate that these populations of coregonids are subject to similar factors that serve to influence the movement patterns of these fishes (i.e., costs and benefits to migration, geologic history and climate; bernatchez & dodson 1987; dodson 1997; northcote 1997; tallman et al. 2002). whitefishes in the interior of alaska often engage in long-distance dispersals that connect critical habi- tat areas (i.e., feeding, spawning and overwintering). our study showed that humpback whitefish present in minto flats dispersed up to 184 km to spawn in the chatanika river and up to 346 km to spawn in the tanana river. humpback whitefish in the upper humpback whitefish spawning movements tanana river require dispersals of 100–150 km to reach essential habitats (brown 2006). in addition, brown et al. (2007) showed evidence to suggest that anadromous humpback whitefish were distributed in the yukon river drainage up to 1700 km from the bering sea. because these fish rely on long-distance dispersals, efforts should continue to protect and identify the movement corridors that link critical hab- itat areas to ensure the long-term survival of these fishes. the observed movements of humpback whitefish within the minto flats–chatanika river provide evi- dence of complex dispersals to spawning areas. these complex movements have likely been shaped by the trade-offs between the costs of movement and the benefits associated with seeking out habitats that opti- mise growth, reproduction and survival (gross 1987; northcote 1997; tallman et al. 2002). for example, the energy expended during the long-distance dis- persal from summer feeding areas in minto flats to spawning areas in the chatanika and tanana rivers should be outweighed by the benefits conferred to growth (by feeding in minto flats) and reproductive success (by spawning in specific areas of the respec- tive rivers; gross et al. 1988). theoretically, the bal- ancing of these costs and benefits should maximise the fitness of these fish by increasing growth, sur- vival and fecundity (bernatchez & dodson 1987; lambert & dodson 1990; dodson 1997). the current extent of the spawning area in the cha- tanika river appears to differ from historic reports (kepler 1973; townsend & kepler 1974; fleming 1996). kepler (1973) observed that the humpback whitefish spawning area in the chatanika river encompassed approximately 42 km and extended 12 km above and 30 km below the elliot highway bridge to any creek. in contrast, our study suggests that the current spawning area in the chatanika river encompasses 29 km immediately downstream of the elliot highway bridge. these results indicate that the spawning area in the chatani- ka river could have decreased in size by approxi- mately 13 km and that spawning no longer takes place upstream of the elliot highway bridge. although we recorded no radio-tagged humpback whitefish above the bridge, efforts were not made to sample fish above this location. as a result, it is pos- sible that a portion of the humpback whitefish popu- lation still spawns in this area of river. approximately in the chatanika river, humpback whitefish were observed using the same spawning areas in both 2008 and 2009. fidelity to spawning sites has been well documented for salmonids and other fishes (e.g., quinn et al. 1999; miller et al. 2001; moyle & cech 2004; quinn 2005). similarly, whitefishes have also been shown to exhibit fidelity to spawning areas (an- 301 dupuis & sutton ras et al. 1999; underwood 2000; brown 2006). humpback whitefish were observed returning to the same spawning areas over several years in the upper tanana river, alaska (brown 2006). in the chatani- ka river, humpback whitefish have been recaptured from the same areas during consecutive year stock assessments conducted by the adfg (fleming 1996). our observations in the chatanika river pro- vide additional evidence to suggest humpback white- fish exhibit spawning site fidelity in this system. this study also provided evidence of the existence of a second spawning area in the tanana river (near fairbanks) used by humpback whitefish that feed in minto flats. the spawning area in the tanana river contained swift current and gravel substrates, and fall sampling revealed that fish in this area were in spawning condition with running milt and eggs (k. wuttig, adfg, unpublished data). because not all of the humpback whitefish recorded leaving minto flats were accounted for (23%), it is possible that other spawning areas used by minto flats humpback white- fish may exist within the tanana river watershed. humpback whitefish present in minto flats during late spring and early summer may be composed of at least two spawning stocks as indicated by spatially segregated dispersals and spawning areas in the cha- tanika and tanana rivers. evidence to suggest the existence of multiple spawning stocks has been given for several populations of coregonids (brown et al. 2002; harris & howland 2005; brown 2006). for example, spatially segregated dispersals and spawn- ing areas have been observed for humpback whitefish in the selawik and tanana rivers, alaska. multiple spawning stocks within a population increase the diversity of spatial and temporal separation of spawn- ing activity, which could render the population more resilient to stock and recruitment failure (begg et al. 1999). for humpback whitefish in the minto flats–chatanika river complex, they could play an important role in the productivity, resiliency and diversity of this popu- lation (altukhov 1981; begg et al. 1999). if multiple spawning stocks do exist the identification of spawning stocks is important for fisheries management (begg et al. 1999; secor 1999; stephenson 1999). stephenson (1997) sug- gested that reductions in the spatial distribution of spawning areas for some atlantic coast fishes may have resulted from management activities that treated these as simple populations when in fact they were complex and contained multiple stocks, some of which might have been more vulnerable to overfish- ing. many stock assessment models assume a closed population and homogenous life-history characteris- tics; misleading results could be produced if only a single stock of a complex population is modelled when a simple, closed population is assumed (begg 302 et al. 1999). as our data suggest, there are at least two spawning stocks present in the minto flats–chatanika river complex humpback whitefish population. how- ever, the relatedness of these two stocks is unclear. until the relationship between these two stocks is determined, the potential for this population to have a complex structure should be considered in future man- agement decisions to avoid the erosion of individual spawning stock, which could have unknown ecologi- cal consequences (stephenson 1999). movement data from our study show evidence of interannual variation in run timing in the chatanika river as the median dates of fish passage past the tracking stations were earlier in 2008 than in 2009. temporal differences in the timing of emigration of humpback whitefish have been observed in whitefish lake, alaska, which were attributed to a need for additional forage time to restore depleted lipid reserves (harper et al. 2007). an alternative explana- tion for our observation in the chatanika river is that fish were captured in early august 2008, and it is pos- sible that these fish were at the end of their spawning dispersal, which could account for the later median dates of movement past the tracking stations in 2008. because variation in run timing is documented for other populations of humpback whitefish in alaska, we believe that a thorough understanding of the tem- poral variation in run timing of humpback whitefish in the chatanika river, as determined through long- term monitoring of fish movements, would benefit future research and management in this system. our study results described the spawning dispers- als, spawning areas in the chatanika and tanana riv- ers, and provided evidence to suggest the potential existence of at least two spawning stocks of hump- back whitefish in the minto flats–chatanika river complex. because this study revealed that a seem- ingly simple population of whitefish was in reality quite complex, managers should take into account the possibility of multiple spawning stocks and spawning areas when developing management strategies for whitefish populations throughout their north ameri- can range. while our results have furthered our knowledge of this species, there are many facets of humpback whitefish remain unknown. as a result, we recommend that future studies conducted on humpback whitefish include investigations of the extent of complexity within pop- ulations, early life-history characteristics, identifica- tion of additional spawning areas and determining the extent of winter and early spring movements. this information will provide a more complete account of the life history of humpback whitefish, which will increase our understanding of whitefishes in general and allow for the development of better-informed management strategies. history that life acknowledgements we would like to thank c. gleason, n. koehler, s. hale, l. edenfield, c. castor, j. coleman,
