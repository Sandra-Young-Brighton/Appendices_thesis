schill et al. 1994), between rivers and lakes or reservoirs (adﬂuvial; stelfox 1997) and between rivers or lakes and the sea (anadromy; johnson 1989; berg & berg 1993). migrations, both upstream and downstream, are usually undertaken for spawning (schill et al. 1994) or for improved feeding opportunities (e.g., naslund 1992; doucett et al. 1999; gulseth & nilssen 2001). the great plasticity in charr life histories (reist 1989), including the development of diverse migration patterns (mccart 1980) and exploratory behaviours, has been suggested as being highly adaptive for energy acquisition in the habitats 376 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00148.x fluvial and adﬂuvial migration patterns of bull trout in idaho in which the species evolved: cold, unproductive, ice- and sediment-inﬂuenced, unstable waters associated with glaciation (power 2002). the bull the species, trout (salvelinus conﬂuentus), a native charr of the northwestern united states and canada, has suffered major declines in the past century, especially those relict stocks inhabiting the southern portion of its range. several factors have contributed to the decline of including overharvest, habitat disruption, non-native species competition and hybridisation with non-native brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis). management of bull trout has been complicated by several factors, including the species’ patchy distribution (rieman & mcintyre 1993), its tendency to migrate long distances and utilise widely separated habitats (swanberg 1997) and our lack of knowledge about population (stock) identity and discreteness (rieman & mcintyre 1993). insufﬁcient knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of individual charr stocks also makes it difﬁcult to designate appropriate conservation areas (stowell et al. 1996). all the above problems exist for the bull trout in the east fork south fork salmon river (efsfsr), idaho, a southern relict stock thought to be part of a central idaho stronghold for this threatened species (usfws 1998). as with many charr stocks in idaho, the distribution and migratory range of the efsfsr bull trout stock is poorly understood. the objectives of this study were to: (i) assess spatial and temporal distri- bution of bull in the upper efsfsr and its tributaries; and (ii) characterise individual and group bull trout movements by season. to the extent that migration patterns of bull trout in efsfsr correlate with those of other charrs, results from and implica- tions of this study will be useful in the management of various migratory charr stocks worldwide. the paciﬁc northwest, and worldwide, trout study area the study was located in west-central idaho, usa within the south fork salmon river (sfsr) drainage. the study area has a short growing season, with most )1) falling as snow. precipitation (mean 79 cmæyear frost can occur any day of the year at elevations higher than 2133 m (hogen 2002). fish sampling was centred in the upper efsfsr watershed (area 33,994 ha). the efsfsr ﬂows through a forested, v-shaped canyon with mostly steep topography. efsfsr stream channel gradients average about 4%. geology in the sfsr is primarily granitic (idaho batholith) with some volcanic and metamorphic material. the granitic material results in a low productivity of the streams; it also weathers into a ﬁne substrate most common in disturbed streams (klamt 1976; clayton & megahan 1997). the highest runoff period in the efsfsr is typically in a 6-week period in may and june from snowmelt. over the period 1929–1995, mean june discharge of the )1; mean august efsfsr at stibnite was 3.3 m3æs discharge was 0.45 m3æs )1 (kuzis 1997). twentieth century gold-mining activities have resulted in the formation of the glory hole, a former mine pit and now a 2-ha body of water located 19 km upstream of the efsfsr mouth. the glory hole had a maximum depth of 13.4 m in 1999, with most of the pit deeper than 6 m. methods capture bull trout were captured in the efsfsr watershed (above the conﬂuence with the sfsr) by hook and line sampling using artiﬁcial lures as well as circle hooks baited with salmon eggs. sampling occurred almost daily from 29 june to 12 august 1999, and from 3 july to 15 august 2000. the 65 bull trout chosen to be radio tagged ranged in length from 320 to 790 mm fork length (fl) and in weight from 385 to 4390 g. radio tagging tags lotek mcft-3fm fish were implanted with coded radio tags by surgery. the tags were of three different dimensions designed to keep the tag weight below 2% of the ﬁsh’s body weight (winter 1996; swanberg 1997). in 1999, 25 larger (10.3 g, 11 mm · 59 mm) and 11 smaller lotek mcft-3bm (7.7 g, 11 mm · 43 mm dimensions) were tags implanted. the typical life for both of these tag types was 238 days, or only a single spawning and overwintering season. in 2000, 11 intermediate-sized tags (lotek mcft-3em; 8.9 g, 11 mm · 49 mm) were implanted. the estimated life of these tags was )1 with a 5-s burst 439 days. tags transmitted 24 hæday rate. captured ﬁsh were held in individual stream tubes (90 cm · 15 cm or 90 cm · 10 cm) made of water- pervious (2-cm holed) pvc pipe with a sliding door at one end. on warm and sunny days, surgery was postponed until early evening. surgical procedures are detailed in hogen (2002) and summarised here. all surgeries were conducted on site. immediately prior to surgery, each ﬁsh was placed )1 into a holding tank that contained 80–90 mgæl tricaine methanesulphonate (ms-222) solution. anaes- thesia occurred in 1–2 min. each ﬁsh was then placed on its dorsum on a padded v-shaped holder. ms-222 solution was continuously pumped over its gills and head to maintain anaesthesia throughout the surgery. 377 hogen & scarnecchia a 4-cm incision was made with a scalpel and scalpel guide anterior to the pelvic ﬁns approximately 3 cm from the mid-ventral line on either the left or right side. a grooved receiver was inserted posteriorly through the incision, with its end positioned posteri- orly to the pelvic ﬁns. a 14-gauge needle (10-cm long) was then pushed through the skin onto the grooved receiver and then slid anterior toward the incision. the tag antenna was guided through the needle until it extruded. the needle and grooved receiver were removed from the incision and the tag was placed into the body cavity. suturing with absorbable sutures consisted of three surgeon’s knots. after tag implantation, each ﬁsh was transported back to the stream tube to recover. fish were held in the stream tube for a minimum of 15 min for recovery and then released at the capture site. radio telemetry movements of tagged ﬁsh were followed by ﬁxed and mobile tracking using two lotek srx400 radio receivers, one ﬁxed at a station and the other portable. the ﬁxed receiver was located on a streambank of the sfsr 0.8 km downstream of the secesh river con- ﬂuence (fig. 1). a six-element yagi directional antenna was mounted on a large tree at the site. a data logger recorded the time and date when radio- tagged ﬁsh passed the site. the receiver was removed from november through mid june to avoid freezing temperatures. the portable receiver was moved pri- marily by truck, but also by airplane and on foot. mobile tracking was conducted at weekly intervals from july through september, and bimonthly from october through june. during the july through september (3-month) period, each ﬁsh was contacted by either ﬁxed or mobile tracking an average of once every 5.6 days in 1999 and once every 4.2 days in 2000. the most frequent average rate of encounter for an individual ﬁsh was once every 4.0 days in 1999 and once every 1.9 days in 2000; the least frequent rate of encounter for an individual ﬁsh was once every 8.3 days in 1999 and once every 15.2 days in 2000. determining the location of a ﬁsh within 50–100 m was considered adequate for the study objectives, except during spawning, when more precise locations (to within 1 m) were sought. at suspected spawning sites and times, triangulation was used to pinpoint the ﬁsh’s location more accurately. fish locations were recorded using a combination of global positioning system (gps) coordinates, topographic maps or road distances from known locations. when an individual ﬁsh was not located by tracking with a truck, tracking by foot was conducted in areas without roads. if a ﬁsh was tracking by aircraft was conducted. still not located, attempts to observe and locate ﬁsh spawning sites were made with each contact during the fall season, fig. 1. map of study area showing bull trout overwintering, migration corridors and spawning and early rearing locations determined by radio telemetry, 1999–2000. arrows indicate direction of ﬂows. 378 fluvial and adﬂuvial migration patterns of bull trout in idaho which was known to be the spawning period from other studies elsewhere (shepard et al. 1984; schill et al. 1994; swanberg 1997). active redd construc- tion, pairing of ﬁsh in small headwater tributaries in the fall and the guarding of a redd were all considered to be evidence of spawning activities. the telemetry data were quantiﬁed by river kilo- metre, expressed as the distance from the mouth of the columbia river to the location of the radio-tagged ﬁsh. when upstream and downstream movements were >0.2 km between contacts, they were recorded as new locations; if no movement >0.2 km occurred, the ﬁsh was considered stationary. in the telemetry analysis, each individual ﬁsh was the experimental unit (winter 1996). migration was deﬁned as the act of moving from one spatial unit (e.g., overwintering habitat or spawning habitat) to another, and changing position within a single spatial unit was deﬁned as a movement (baker 1978). analysis all ﬁsh locations were graphed and visually inspected for patterns of individual and group movements. patterns of movement were qualitatively categorised as migratory or nonmigratory. migratory patterns were further described as ﬂuvial or adﬂuvial. to quantitatively test location the previous week, if ﬁsh movements were nondirectional or directional, a nonparametric runs test (ramsey & schafer 1997) was used for each individual ﬁsh and all ﬁsh were grouped together from 1999 and 2000. if the ﬁsh moved upstream from its it was categorised as a ‘+’. downstream movement was categorised as a ‘)’. if a ﬁsh did not move from its location the previous week (<0.2 km), the data were disregarded. the data were directional, a run (string of upstream or downstream values) would tend to be long and the number of different runs would tend to be small (ramsey & schafer 1997); this characteristic run would signify a ﬁsh migration. the null hypothesis was that a radio-tagged ﬁsh’s movement was nondirectional. if the nonparametric runs test statistic (l) was expressed as: l ¼ 2mp m þ p þ 1; where m is the number of ‘)’ and p the number of ‘+’. the standard deviation of the number of runs (d) was expressed as: d ¼ p 2mpð2mp   m   pþ pðm þ pþ2ðm þ p   1þ : the test statistic used was: z ¼ ðnumber of runsþ   l þ c d where c is a continuity correction. c was set at 0.5 if the number of runs was less than l and at )0.5 if the number of runs was greater than l. a t-test was used to investigate if consecutive-year migrants from 1999 moved upstream in 2000 at the same rate as ﬁsh radio tagged in 2000. weekly movement rate for each ﬁsh was considered a sample. seven geographic areas were delineated: salmon river, sfsr, lower efsfsr (mouth upstream to johnson creek), upper efsfsr (johnson creek upstream to headwaters), tributaries to upper efsfsr, johnson creek and tributaries to johnson creek (fig. 1). a chi-square test was used to evaluate if there was a statistical difference (a ¼ 0.05) between the observed number of bull trout entering the upper efsfsr and those entering johnson creek. results migrations and movements test movements of individual ﬁsh and groups of ﬁsh were qualitatively assessed to be strongly directional migra- tions, even though the runs indicated that individual ﬁsh exhibited both nondirectional (43 ﬁsh) and directional (12 ﬁsh) movements in both years. analysis of group movements supported the qualita- tive assessment; ﬁsh from both 1999 and 2000 as groups exhibited directional patterns [1999: runs test, n ¼ 31, p ¼ 0.01 (fig. 2a); 2000: runs test, n ¼ 30, p ¼ 0.01 (fig. 2b)] considered to be migrations. fish tagged in 1999 and returning in 2000 migrated upstream rapidly in early july. consecutive-year migrants moved upstream more quickly during the week of 3 july 2000 than other bull trout initially radio tagged in 2000 (d.f. ¼ 27, f ¼ 13.35, p ¼ 0.0011). observed movements of 62 ﬁsh were classiﬁed into one of four patterns: consecutive-year ﬂuvial, non- consecutive-year ﬂuvial, adﬂuvial and down-river stationary. three other ﬁsh were classiﬁed as having experienced tag loss or mortality. three ﬁsh exhibited a ﬂuvial migration pattern with consecutive-year spawning. after initial tagging in the efsfsr in late june or july, the ﬁsh migrated upstream to the mouth of a small tributary in early july, entered the tributary in mid-august, spawned or staged there from late august through mid-september, then rapidly emigrated downstream by mid-september into the sfsr or salmon river, where they overwin- tered. this pattern was repeated beginning in late may or early june of the following year (fig. 3a). the three ﬁsh entered the same major tributary (although not 379 hogen & scarnecchia (a) ) m k ( e c n a t s 20 10 0 –10 –20 –30d –40 –50 i 21 28 28 10 28 29 29 29 29 31 19 21 27 2 5 1 1 2 2 9 1 2 3 6 1 2 2 4 8 - j - j u l 2 9 6 - - - j j j - - a a 6 3 0 - - - - s 3 0 7 - - - u u a a a e s s s g g u u u p e e e - o c t u n u u u l l l g g g p p p date (b) 20 10 0 –10 –20 ) m k ( e c n a t s i –30d –40 –50 28 30 28 30 30 30 30 29 28 27 20 22 21 2 3 1 1 2 3 7 1 2 2 4 1 1 2 2 6 - j - j u l 0 7 4 1 - - - - j j j j - a 4 1 8 - - - - s 1 8 5 - - - u a a a e s s s u n u u u u l l l l - o c t g u u u p e e e g g g p p p date fig. 2.

maximum, 351 days). postspawning by 20 september of both 1999 and 2000, radio-tagged bull trout still retaining their radio tags had exited the spawning tributaries. radio-tagged bull trout migrated downstream rapidly at this time up to 106.4 km in 1 week. overwintering fluvial bull trout overwintered in the lower sfsr and salmon river. of the tagged ﬁsh located during the winter, 20 were in the lower sfsr, nine were in the lower salmon river and six were in the upper salmon river. bimonthly tracking during winter detected very little movement. three ﬁsh that overwintered in 1999 migrated upstream in 2000, then returned downstream to overwinter in 2000 at the same locations (sfsr and salmon river) as in 1999. discussion migrations and movements the presence of several variations of ﬂuvial migration patterns (fig. 3a–d,f) as well as an adﬂuvial pattern (fig. 3e) for the bull trout of the efsfsr is consistent with the great plasticity of life histories and migratory patterns observed in the species elsewhere in the region (rieman & mcintyre 1993). except for the downriver-stationary pattern, which is difﬁcult to interpret and may have resulted from ecological factors, stress associated with tagging or a combina- tion of the patterns have been described elsewhere in other bull trout stocks. those factors, all spawning throughout nonconsecutive-year all three ﬂuvial migrants exhibiting consecutive- year migrations into tributaries entered the same tributaries they had entered the previous year. other studies have also documented consecutive-year spawning site ﬁdelity (swanberg 1997; hvenegaard & thera 2001). in the kakwa river, alberta, hvenegaard & thera (2001) reported that 10 of 13 (77%) bull trout displayed spawning site ﬁdelity by returning to a speciﬁc tributary in each spawning season. the pattern observed in this study, in which ﬁsh migrated into small tributaries to spawn, subsequently overwintered downriver in a large river and remained in the large the next year, has been river habitat documented in other ﬂuvial bull trout populations (burrows et al. 2001; hvenegaard & thera 2001). in the kakwa river, hvenegaard & thera (2001) reported that 18 of 27 bull tracked through more than two successive spawning seasons displayed a tendency towards alternate-year spawning. in our study, nonspawning consecutive-year migrants did not typically migrate upstream to the mouth of a small tributary, but instead typically remained in the lower efsfsr or sfsr near the mouth of the secesh river, only migrating a portion of the distance to the tributaries. in spawning years, spawners would enter small tributaries. the 18-month study period was not long enough to determine whether the pattern was alternate-year spawning, spawning at longer intervals or tag loss during the winter. trout (67%) the short because of life of some tags, early expulsion of some tags and the short study duration, we were not always able to determine if the tagged ﬁsh were consecutive-year or alternate-year spawners. in 21 cases, for example, a ﬁsh swam upstream, staged in or at tributary, entered and spawned or staged in that tributary and lost its tag soon the mouth of a small 383 hogen & scarnecchia afterward. similar high rates of tag loss were also observed by schill et al. (1994) and elle et al. (1994) in rapid river, idaho. in the mcleod river, alberta, carson (2001) reported one of nine radio-tagged bull trout that entered a small tributary to spawn lost its tag either due to predation or tag expulsion. for 12 other ﬁsh tagged in 2000, the tag transmissions were adequate to demonstrate a ﬂuvial pattern with over- wintering downstream in a larger river, although the spawning periodicity was not determined. swanberg (1997) observed a similar ﬂuvial pattern in the blackfoot river, montana. in rapid river, elle et al. (1994) also documented ﬂuvial bull trout that migrated upstream to a tributary, entered the tributary to spawn, emigrated rapidly after spawning and resided in the salmon river, a large river downstream of the spawning tributary. the adﬂuvial pattern observed in this study differed greatly from ﬂuvial patterns in that ﬁsh migrated downstream out of the glory hole in late june to the mouth of a small tributary, apparently spawned in the small tributary and returned upriver to the glory hole during the winter. adﬂuvial life histories are common in relict bull trout in the paciﬁc northwest (rieman & mcintyre 1993). the adﬂuvial pattern in efsrsr bull trout is similar to migrations described by fraley & shepard (1989). in that study, adult bull trout entered tributaries from july through september, spawned during september and early october, exited the tributary after spawning and returned (downstream in this case) to the lake to overwinter. juveniles emigrated from the tributaries into the flathead river mainly in june and august and continued downstream until reaching flathead lake. their results differed from our results in that the efsfsr juveniles would have to swim upstream to mature in the glory hole and spawn downstream of their rearing area. as the glory hole has only been present this migration pattern would have had to develop over a short time period. carson (2001) observed two bull trout perform a downstream spawning migration in the mcleod river, alberta. these two ﬁsh were radio tagged in the river where they travelled downstream to the mouth of a tributary, entered the tributary, spawned and returned upstream to the capture site in the river. this study and the downstream migration of ﬁsh observed in the efsfsr further raises questions about the mechanisms and cues used in identifying and locating spawning areas. power (2002) suggested that ‘olfaction, together with habitat familiarity and solar navigation, seem to be the most likely modal- ities involved’ (p. 30) in charr homing. for 60 years, the diversity of migration patterns (ﬂuvial and adﬂuvial) observed in efsfsr bull trout is similar to that observed in other charrs elsewhere (johnson 384 1980; kircheis 1980; naslund 1990). nordeng (1961) and mccart (1980) summarised migratory characteristics of arctic charrs (salvelinus_alpinus), in their regions and reported that a diversity of life history and migration patterns existed. although anadromous life histories are common in many locations for arctic charr and are typically preferen- tially displayed by females over males (mortensen & christensen 1983), ﬂuvial and adﬂuvial life histories also have been reported, especially in landlocked situations (kircheis 1980; reist 1989). charrs have been characterised as having evolved migratory and exploratory life histories as adaptations favouring historical colonisation along glacial margins, areas typically characterised as cold, unproductive and unpredictable. exploration may be adaptive as an effective colonising mechanism, and migrations may allow charrs access to better food supplies in rivers, lakes or the ocean, wherever opportunities arise (power 2002). growth of charrs has been shown in to be strongly related to the numerous productivity the (e.g., barbour & einarsson 1987; rubin 1993) and fecundity (and presumably ﬁtness) positively related to ﬁsh size (johnson 1980). such historical migratory and exploratory adaptations in charrs may also serve a relict charr such as efsfsr bull trout well in its habitat. productivity for ﬁsh in the batholith-domin- ated sfsr basin is low, and spawning areas in the headwaters may provide little food or overwintering habitat. life history may be the most adaptive life history, particularly where a lack of large lakes in the upper efsfsr basin prevents the development of all but a modest adﬂuvial life history (i.e., associated with the glory hole; fig. 3e). in this situation, a migratory, ﬂuvial cases of habitat in this study, three spatial units were identiﬁed based on the results of radio tagging: overwintering habitat, migrational corridor and spawning and early rearing habitat (fig. 1). overwintering habitat was in the larger rivers including the sfsr and a portion of the salmon river. the glory hole was also identiﬁed as overwintering habitat for the adﬂuvial ﬁsh (fig. 1). migration corridors consisted of segments of the sfsr and the efsfsr from its conﬂuence with the sfsr (river km 1099.9) upstream to the glory hole (river km 1143.0) including johnson creek. spawning and rearing habitat was in the small tributaries including several small tributaries to efsfsr as well as headwater tributaries to those tributaries (fig. 1). although feeding studies were not conducted, larger migratory adults may feed opportunistically in all these habitats. the entry of 29 radio-tagged bull trout into the upper efsfsr, but none into johnson creek, indica- ted that trout preferentially the tagged ﬂuvial bull fluvial and adﬂuvial migration patterns of bull trout in idaho selected the upper efsfsr over johnson creek (fig. 3). the reason for the large difference in numbers of tagged ﬁsh entering the two rivers is not clear. johnson creek is known to contain bull trout. the nez perce tribe operated an upstream passage weir (pickets 4 cm apart) from 26 june through 13 september 2000, and during that period, 17 bull trout (390–510 mm tl) were collected in the trap and placed upstream of the weir (m. daniel, nez perce tribe, mccall, idaho, personal communication). in addition, the nez perce tribe also had a downstream migrant screw-trap located on lower johnson creek, where they captured 55 bull trout; four of them were greater than 350 mm fl. it is possible that our sample of radio-tagged ﬁsh did not adequately include johnson creek ﬂuvial bull trout. it is also possible that the migration timing of johnson creek ﬁsh did not coincide with when we radio tagged ﬁsh. it may also be that the ﬂuvial bull trout population in johnson creek and its tributaries is small relative to that in the upper efsfsr and tributaries. spawning period the bull trout spawning observed in late august through mid september in 1999 and 2000 in tributaries was associated with maximum water temperatures of 7.4–12.8 °c. a drop in water temperature from 12 to 9–10 °c occurred in most tributaries during early september. the observed spawning time and water temperatures were similar to those observed for resident bull trout by adams (1994) in tributaries to the weiser river, idaho. in the rapid river, idaho, schill et al. (1994) observed ﬂuvial bull trout spawn- ing in late august through mid-september as water temperatures dropped from 10 to 6.5 °c. fraley & shepard (1989) observed adﬂuvial bull trout spawning when water temperatures dropped below 9 °c. the three radio-tagged bull trout that were con- secutive-year spawners returned to the same tributaries as the previous year. swanberg (1997) observed similar consecutive-year spawning in a tributary of the blackfoot river, montana. overwintering the observation that radio-tagged ﬂuvial bull trout moved little during the winter months (less than 1 km) is similar to results reported elsewhere. swanberg (1997) reported that movements during the winter were very local, never exceeding 300 m. elle et al. (1994) also found that ﬂuvial bull trout from the rapid river, idaho typically remained in one habitat unit for the overwintering period and generally moved less than 100 m between contacts. even with the reduced tracking schedule in winter, the evidence indicates that overwintering movements were much less extensive than in other seasons. while observing the locations of the radio-tagged bull trout in the winter, we observed the ﬁsh using large deep pools and runs and avoiding shallow rifﬂes. this habitat use is similar to that reported by schill et al. (1994) and elle et al. (1994) in the salmon river near riggins, idaho. in our study, three radio-tagged ﬂuvial bull trout exhibited site ﬁdelity to the overwin- tering habitat by returning to the same location as the previous year. swanberg (1997) also observed over- wintering site ﬁdelity in three radio-tagged bull trout in the blackfoot river, montana. little overlap of efsfsr ﬂuvial bull trout overwintering habitat was observed with the rapid river ﬂuvial bull trout overwintering locations (elle et al. 1994; schill et al. 1994), even though the two groups had free access to the same overwintering sites. of the 63 ﬁsh tagged and subsequently contacted in overwintering habitats [38 from this study, 17 from elle et al. 1994 and eight ﬁsh from schill et al. (1994)], only one ﬁsh from our study and one ﬁsh from schill et al. (1994) used the same overwintering locations. as the overwintering and spawning areas of the radio-tagged bull trout from the rapid river and the sfsr do not overlap, it appears that they are separate stocks with not only distinct spawning areas, but also distinct overwintering areas. management signiﬁcance of diverse migration patterns trout results of this study show that bull in the efsfsr have evolved a variety of migrational patterns, both ﬂuvial and adﬂuvial, similar to bull trout in the region and other charr species throughout the northern hemisphere. fish from the efsfsr also exhibited migration patterns consistent with the idea that several distinct stocks of bull trout exist in the sfsr basin. the highly variable life histories and migration patterns associated with this species is consistent with genetic results (taylor et al. 1999) indicating that most of the molecular genetic variations occur at the interpopulation and inter-region (coastal vs. interior) levels. maintenance of bull trout habitat for such a highly migratory species composed of numerous stocks will thus require actions in a variety of habitats, from the larger main stem rivers to the smallest tributaries. acknowledgements we thank j. o’laughlin, j. congleton and s. miller for valuable comments on this paper. t. c. bjornn provided insight regarding radio telemetry methods and knowledge of idaho’s ﬁshes. k. apperson and m. faurot provided assistance and support. d. bates provided ﬁeld assistance. funding and other contributions for this project were provided by the idaho department of fish 385 hogen & scarnecchia and game, us forest service and university of idaho. the us geological survey and nez perce tribe provided additional logistical support. references adams, s.b. 1994. bull trout distribution and habitat use in the weiser river drainage, idaho. master of science thesis. moscow, id: university of idaho. baker, r.r. 1978. the evolutionary ecology of animal migration. new york: holmes and meier publishers. barbour, s.e. & einarsson, s.m. 1987. ageing and growth of charr, salvelinus_alpinus (l.), types in scotland. aquaculture and fisheries management 18: 63–72. from three habitat berg, o.k. & berg, m. 1993. duration of sea and freshwater residence of arctic char from the vardnes river in northern norway. aquaculture 110: 129– 140.
