(skaala & nævdal 1989; knutsen et al. 2001), delay in gonad maturation process (jonsson 1985) or the existence of behavioural barriers that may prevent mating from occurring. part of the confusion about the nature of genetic divergence between the two morphs may be due to the technical difﬁculty of ﬁeld investigations, meaning that data on interbreeding are scarce. campbell (1977) observed the presence of resident males together with spawning sea_trout females on redds, but there is no evidence that the eggs were actually fertilised. laboratory experiments have shown that anadromous · freshwater resident crosses are possible and produce fertile descendants in brown_trout (skrochowska 1969; ombredane et al. 1996). nevertheless, the existence of hybrids in nature has not yet been reported. in the present study, we investigated interbreeding between anadromous and non-anadromous adult brown_trout through a genetic analysis of new cohorts emerging from redds and entering the population after incubation of eggs and embryos into the substrate. the study took place in la roche brook, a small spawning tributary of the oir river (normandy, france) where both anadromous and non-anadromous spawning grounds largely overlap (charles et al. 2004). since anadromous and freshwater resident brown_trout are not morphologically distinguishable at the juvenile stage (baglinie`re et al. 2000), we ﬁrst used stable isotopes analyses (sia) to identify the maternal origin of each emerging fry (i.e., anadromous or freshwater resident) following the method described by charles et al. (2004). we then genotyped the fry at six dna microsatellites. in cases of low interbreeding level between adults of the two morphs on the redds, we assumed that the anadromous and non-anadromous female progenies would be genetically divergent. conversely, the absence of genetic divergence would reﬂect a high level of gene ﬂow between the two morphs, interbreeding on redds. thus indicating frequent materials and methods study site and brown_trout population the study was carried out in la roche brook (fig. 1), a 4.5-km long second-order tributary stream of the oir river (normandy, france), which provides suitable spawning grounds for both freshwater resi- dent and anadromous brown_trout and for atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). an impassable dam disrupts the stream so that only the lower 2.2 km of the stream is accessible to anadromous brown_trout. since 1985, brown_trout movement and population abundance have been monitored on the oir river and major tributaries by electroﬁshing juveniles (october and may) and by counting smolts and adults at a ﬁsh trap located on the oir river. a thorough description of the oir river biota, ﬁsh community and salmonid populations monitoring can be found in baglinie`re et al. (1993, 2005). anadromous brown_trout gener- ally enter the oir river and la roche brook in november and spawn from late november to janu- ary. young-of-the-year start to emerge from redds in march, while emigrant juveniles leave the brook in early spring (age-1 and age-2 parr, pre-smolt and smolt). fry sampling emerging fry were sampled at three sites in la roche brook (fig. 1): the lower site (s1) was situated 30 m la roche brook s3 s2 scale 0 1 km s1 oir river emerging fry sample sites in vertebrates sample sites impassable dam oir river mont - saint michel bay 256 fig. 1. study area: sites 1, 2 and 3 on the la roche brook (48 °38.3¢n, 01 °10.6¢w), second order spawning tributary of the oir river (normandy, france). upstream from the conﬂuence with the oir river; the middle site (s2) and the upper site (s3) were at 0.8 km and nearly 1.6 km, respectively, from the outlet of the brook. the sites were each 150 m long and, taken together they represented 20% (450 m) of the stream length between the conﬂuence and the dam. each site was electroﬁshed weekly from 15 march to 10 april 2002 and from 3 march to 24 april 2003, to sample the entire periods of emergence. equipped with a backpack electroﬁsher (24 v input; 150–550 v, 400 hz pulsed dc output; dreamelectronics, pessac, france), the operator progressed in an upstream direction and performed a minimum of 40-point samples per site along the right and left banks, alternately. fry collections from each sample point were placed in a separate water-ﬁlled container at the end of the site and only recently emerged fry (i.e., with yolk adsorption not completed or just completed) were kept for sia and genetic analysis. the sampling protocol for collecting emerging fry has been des- cribed in detail and discussed in charles et al. (2004). we established reference isotopic signatures of anadr- omous and non-anadromous spawners by collecting ﬁn and egg tissue samples from male and female brown_trout from the oir river system during november and december 2002. moreover, we sam- pled benthic invertebrates from electroﬁshing sites (s1, s2 and s3) and three other locations on the oir river system (fig. 1) in april 2003 to determine the stable isotope values of potential prey available to freshwater resident ﬁsh. isotopic analysis the ethical the selected fry were over-anaesthetised in a solution of phenoxyethanol (0.1%), according to the regula- tions for treatment of wild ﬁsh. the digestive tract was removed and discarded, and the remaining tissues were rinsed with distilled water. all samples (fry, eggs, ﬁn clips and benthic invertebrates) were freeze-dried at )40 °c and ground to a ﬁne powder using a mixer mill (retsch mm 200, fisher bioblock scientiﬁc, illkirch, france). approximately 0.2 mg of sample were weighed (sartorius m2p, sartorius, goettingen, germany) into a tin capsule and combusted in a carlo erba n/c-2500 elemental analyzer interfaced with a thermo-finnigan delta plus xp continuous ﬂow isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (cf-irms, thermo finnigan, bremen, germany). isotope ratios are expressed in parts per thousand (&) according to the following equation: x ¼ ½ðrsample   rstandardþ=rstandard  1000 where x is d13c or d15n and r is the corresponding 13c/12c or 15n/14n ratio. rstandard for d13c was carbon from carbonate rock (pee dee belemnite formation, genetic variability in sea and resident trout fry craig 1957) and rstandard for d15n was atmospheric nitrogen (mariotti 1983). positive delta values indicate enrichment of the heavier isotope and negative values indicate depletion. repeat analyses of iaea standards (n1, n2, ch6 and ch7), along with three elemental standards (acetalinide, cyclohexanone and nicotina- mide) and one internal standard (homogenised bovine liver), showed that d13c and d15n were precise to 0.20&. sample reproducibility was tested by making duplicate measurements (two or three per sample) on 43 tissue samples. the coefﬁcient of variation ranged between 0.001 and 0.077, and single measurements were carried out on all remaining samples. genetic analysis strbs131inra, dna extractions from fry samples were performed according to the proteinase k/chelex method (estoup et al. 1996) and dna was stored at )20 °c. samples analysed with six microsatellite markers: were str85inra, ssa0064nhv, ssa103nhv, str543nhv and ssa179nhv (pcr conditions and primer sequences are given in charles et al. 2005). the protocol the pcr reaction as well as the pcr product separation and visualisation was the same as in launey et al. (2003). stocking programmes have been discontinued for more than 10 years on the oir river catchment. however, the genetic analysis was carried out on native ﬁsh, we included dna samples from ﬁsh belonging to four hatchery strains (local: ‘fe´de´ration’ and ‘farcy’; national: ‘chauvet’ and ‘xertigny’). to check that followed for statistical analysis assumptions of normality and homogeneity of vari- ance in stable isotope values were tested using kolmogorov–smirnov and f-tests, respectively. stu- dent’s t-tests were used to assess variations in isotopic composition (d13c and d15n) between anadromous and freshwater resident groups. statistical analyses were performed with s-plus (professional edition version 6.1.2, insightful corp. s: copyright lucent technologies, inc., seattle, wa, usa). maximum type-i error rates were set at a ¼ 0.05. fry were grouped by year (2002 and 2003), site (s1, s2 and s3), and, according to the sia results, by maternal origin (anadromous and freshwater resident: abbreviated as ana and fhw, respectively). in this way, we deﬁned 12 emerging fry groups (table 1). departure from hardy–weinberg equilibrium and the null hypothesis of homogeneity in allelic distribution between the genepop3.1d program (raymond & rousset 1995). the genetic differentiation between groups was assessed with groups were the 257 charles et al. table 1. total number of alleles per locus (ta), number of alleles per locus per sample (a), expected heterozygosity (he) and observed heterozygosity (ho) at six microsatellite loci analysed in 12 groups of emerging fry group str85inra strbs131inra ssa0064nhv ssa103nhv str543inra ssa179nhv ta 10 02fhws1 (n ¼ 5) 11 a he ho 3 0.540 0.400 02fhws2 (n ¼ 22) 5 0.732 0.727 a he ho 02fhws3 (n ¼ 19) 6 0.760 0.790 a he ho 02anas1 (n ¼ 14) 4 0.543 0.357 a he ho 02anas2 (n ¼ 3) a he ho 02anas3 (n ¼ 6) a he ho 03fhws1 (n ¼ 7) 3 0.611 1.000 4 0.736 0.833 a he ho a he ho 5 0.735 0.571 4 0.667 0.667 03fhws2 (n ¼ 17) 5 0.766 0.882 a he ho 03fhws3 (n ¼ 6) 03anas1 (n ¼ 12) 5 0.715 1.000 a he ho 03anas2 (n ¼ 11) 5 0.756 1.000 a he ho 03anas3 (n ¼ 12) 5 0.684 0.917 a he ho fe´de´ration (n ¼ 35) 8 0.813 0.857 a he ho farcy (n ¼ 35) a he ho chauvet (n ¼ 15) a he ho xertigny (n ¼ 15) a he ho 7 0.763 0.857 7 0.804 0.857 7 0.780 0.933 4 0.580 0.800 6 0.803 0.909 5 0.726 0.789 6 0.786 0.929 3 0.611 1.000 5 0.778 0.667 5 0.674 0.857 5 0.704 0.765 5 0.764 1.000 4 0.715 0.750 5 0.744 0.727 5 0.722 0.833 8 0.618 0.629 8 0.748 0.857 7 0.749 0.600 6 0.784 0.733 27 3 0.620 0.600 10 0.690 0.773 9 0.799 0.842 5 0.722 0.923 3 0.611 1.000 5 0.694 1.000 7 0.786 0.857 13 0.867 0.940 8 0.861 0.833 6 0.802 1.000 8 0.820 0.900 7 0.640 0.818 11 0.860 0.882 14 0.861 0.971 10 0.842 1.000 10 0.784 1.000 29 5 0.780 0.600 11 0.819 0.773 12 0.896 0.947 7 0.814 0.429 4 0.722 1.000 4 0.708 0.833 7 0.796 1.000 12 0.887 1.000 6 0.778 0.667 6 0.792 0.833 6 0.765 0.889 9 0.822 0.909 16 0.852 0.971 15 0.824 0.857 13 0.856 0.733 8 0.820 0.800 17 4 0.580 0.800 7 0.636 0.682 7 0.697 0.737 6 0.648 0.857 2 0.444 0.667 4 0.653 1.000 3 0.541 0.714 4 0.394 0.471 7 0.820 1.000 6 0.765 1.000 4 0.566 0.454 6 0.793 1.000 12 0.847 0.743 9 0.812 0.857 11 0.822 0.867 9 0.822 0.800 29 6 0.800 0.800 10 0.791 0.727 9 0.852 0.947 6 0.747 1.000 4 0.722 1.000 7 0.833 1.000 5 0.611 0.667 8 0.822 0.875 7 0.820 1.000 8 0.826 1.000 8 0.833 0.778 9 0.876 0.818 15 0.885 0.970 14 0.890 0.943 13 0.864 0.867 11 0.889 0.800 mean 21 4 0.650 0.667 8 0.745 0.765 8 0.788 0.842 6 0.710 0.749 3 0.620 0.944 5 0.734 0.889 5 0.690 0.778 8 0.740 0.763 6 0.785 0.862 6 0.769 0.931 6 0.747 0.791 7 0.756 0.883 12 0.813 0.825 11 0.816 0.890 10 0.823 0.852 9 0.813 0.844 emerging fry were collected in the lower (s1), middle (s2) or upstream (s3) site of la roche brook, in 2002 (02) and 2003 (03), and identiﬁed as progeny of anadromous (ana) or freshwater resident (fhw) female brown_trout. results of the four hatchery strains (fe´de´ration, farcy, chauvet and xertigny) are also reported. 258 quantiﬁed with the genetix 4.02 program (belkhir 2000) by calculating unbiased pairwise fst values (weir & cockerham 1984). to account for temporal and microgeographical genetic variations when ana- lysing differentiation between morphs, we performed a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (amova) using the software arlequin version 2.000 (schneider et al. 2000). fry were grouped ﬁrst by year and site, then by morph and site and, lastly, by morph and year. we calculated the probability of each ﬁsh belonging to each group using assignment tests performed with the geneclass2 program (piry et al. 2004). we used the populations program (o. langella, http://www.cnrs- gif.fr/pge/bioinfo/populations) to assess relationships between groups by means of a neighbour-joining analysis performed with the cavalli-sforza & edwards (1967) chord distance, which assumes pure genetic drift. a bootstrap was carried out on loci (3000 permutations) to assess the robustness of the cluster- ing. the population phenogram was visualised using the program treeview 1.6.6.

(1991) for adult brown_trout in river voss (norway), support the hypothesis that interbreeding frequently occurs on redds when anadromous and freshwater resident trout reach the same spawning grounds and indicates a high level of gene ﬂow between the two morphs via reproduction. gene ﬂow between fresh- water resident and anadromous trout in la roche brook is probably promoted by extensive overlapping of their spawning grounds as previously observed 260 (charles et al. 2004), together with the absence of behavioural barriers on the redds (campbell 1977). moreover, there appear to be no temporal barriers either, as ﬁsh of both morph phenotypes enter la roche brook to spawn at the same time. in a companion study, charles et al. (2005) collec- ted tissue samples on adults en route to the spawning grounds at different locations in the oir river catch- ment, i.e., without information on where they were going to spawn. microsatellite analysis revealed no genetic differentiation between the two morphs. therefore, gene ﬂow between the two morphs appears to be a general the entire population of the oir river catchment. the gene ﬂow may be regarded as a mechanism to reduce genetic divergence between morphs, which is promoted by divergent selection, thus ensuring a high level of plasticity for the species. trend occurring over it is not surprising that the geographical factor has an inﬂuence on the genetic structuring of brown_trout populations, since this species has already been found in genetically subdivided populations over different geographical areas (ferguson 1989; skaala & nævdal 1989; hansen & loeschcke 1996; estoup et al. 1998). in la roche brook, the genetic differentiation between sampling sites located a few hundred metres apart may reﬂect the ﬁne-scale genetic structure of brown_trout within a single stream, as already observed elsewhere (see carlsson et al. 1999; carlsson & nilsson 2000). when sampling short stretches of stream however, a potential problem is that the catch may be biased towards a few families (allendorf & phelps 1981; hansen et al. 1997), and in la roche brook, between-site genetic differences could be reinforced by the small size of the population of spawners at each site. a positive correlation between geographical dis- tance and genetic differentiation, i.e., ‘isolation by distance’, has been reported in several salmonid populations (e.g., mo´ ran et al. 1995; hansen & mensberg 1998; knutsen et al. 2001). carlsson & 02anas3 03fhws3 02anas1 02fhws1 03fhws1 03anas1 fédération chauvet farcy xertigny 03fhws2 03anas2 02fhws2 02anas2 03anas3 02fhws3 89 52 11 14 19 35 40 65 0.1 units fig. 3. neighbour-joining dendrogram with pairwise cavalli– sforza and edwards’ chord distance units for 12 emerging fry groups collected in la roche brook and four hatchery samples (see table 1 for details). nodes values are given when >10% (3000 bootstrap replicates). nilsson (2000) provided an example of isolation by distance in brown_trout on a microgeographical scale (seven sections of 70–90 m along a 15.7-km stream) genetic variability in sea and resident trout fry in the absence of impassable geomorphological struc- tures. in la roche brook, the lack of isolation by distance may result from the relatively homogeneous habitat in this tributary, where water depth ranges from 20 to 60 cm and the gradient (1.1%) is almost constant from the conﬂuence with oir river up to the dam. thus, the entry of adults into la roche brook in early winter for spawning is largely facilitated, and they can quickly reach the dam located 2.2 km upstream from the conﬂuence. if the dispersion of adults on redds is not actually constrained by any habitat feature, then we may reasonably assume that adults are randomly distributed on redds. this accounts for the absence of a correlation between the genetic structure of the emerging fry population and the distance between the three sampling sites s1, s2 and s3. several studies on salmonids have highlighted the temporal stability of the genetic structure of popula- tions over several decades (nielsen et al. 1999; tessier & bernatchez 1999; hansen et al. 2002). for brown_trout, carlsson & nilsson (2000) reported temporal stability in the genetic structure within sites in a swedish stream. however, østergaard et al. (2003) observed that temporal differentiation vastly exceeded geographical differentiation in danish rivers with periodically extreme low water levels. in the present study, the genetic differences) between sampling dates for the same site may directly reﬂect the genetic variation between cohorts. again, this variation may be due to a genetic drift related to the small size of the brown_trout population (jorde & ryman 1996). this last feature could produce an artefact in the study of genetic differentiation between the anadromous and freshwa- ter resident trout in our study, and the question should be further investigated on larger brown_trout popula- tions. the observed temporal instability (i.e., finally, our study represents the ﬁrst attempt to analyse genetic differentiation between the progenies of freshwater resident and anadromous female brown_trout, thanks to sia. the results strongly support the hypothesis that interbreeding frequently occurs on redds when anadromous and freshwater resident trout reach the same spawning ground and maturate at the same time, thus indicating a high level of gene ﬂow between the two morphs via reproduction. is therefore suggested that genetic divergence between anadromous and freshwater resident morphs, when- ever observed in brown_trout populations, may be due to geographical isolation and/or delay in gonad maturation process rather than behavioural barriers that prevent anadromous trout from mating with resident trout. the present work further illustrates that sia – in conjunction with other appropriate tools such as genetic analysis — can improve our understanding it 261 charles et al. of some complex aspects of animal ecology (cunjak et al. 2005). acknowledgements we are very grateful to r. guyomard and p.
