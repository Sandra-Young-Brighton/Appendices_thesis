olson 1996) inﬂuence growth rates of individual ﬁsh, leading to the occurrence of size divergence within age cohorts. in many freshwater ﬁshes, variation in body sizes within the young-of-the-year (yoy) cohort is typically driven by ontogenetic diet shifts (persson & bro¨nmark 2002; galarowicz & wahl 2005). for a variety of reasons, the largest members of a cohort are often able to shift diets seasonally from invertebrates to ﬁsh whereas smaller individuals cannot make this shift (van densen et al. 1996; mittelbach & persson 1998; frankiewicz et al. 1999). because ﬁsh are an energetically proﬁtable prey item, the larger individ- uals may enjoy increased growth rates over smaller individuals (buijse & houthuijzen 1992; borcherding et al. 2000, 2007). perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) is a food generalist which feed undergoes ontogenetic diet shifts. they ﬁrst doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00300.x 475 urbatzka et al. on zooplankton, and switch to macrozoobenthos (hartmann 1983;

olsson et al. 2006; heermann et al. 2007). body sizes of yoy perch at the end of their ﬁrst summer are extremely variable and range between 4 and 15 cm (thorpe 1977; houthuijzen et al. 1993; beeck et al. 2002; borcherding et al. 2007). differ- ences in yoy body size are attributed to different productivity of lake systems, prey availability or the occasional onset of piscivory feeding in yoy perch. however, as in other freshwater piscivores, surpris- ingly little information is available on size-speciﬁc diets and growth rates during early life history (mittelbach & persson 1998). in the present study, the growth of yoy perch and the development of size variation within the yoy cohort were experimentally examined in relation to their consumed food resources in their ﬁrst year of life. adult perch and bream (abramis brama) were stocked into ﬁshless ponds in spring to produce yoy ﬁsh of both species, and recovered at the end of the growing season. bream was chosen as potential prey ﬁsh for perch mimicking the situation in lakes from the area of lower rhine in germany (beeck et al. 2002). the growth, size distribution and food intake of the yoy perch were recorded in order to gain more information on body size variation among yoy ﬁsh in relation to their use of food resources. stomach content analyses indicated the short-term feeding behaviour while stable isotope signatures reﬂected the long-term feeding behaviour of the juvenile ﬁsh. materials and methods experimental design the study was conducted in two experimental ponds (pilgram ﬁsh farm, lohmar) that were previously empty of ﬁsh, lay dry during wintertime and were ﬁlled in spring. on 20 march 2001, adult perch and bream were stocked into these ponds in similar weight considering differences in the area of the ponds (pond )1 a: 0.4 ha, 11.8 kgæha )1 perch, bream, 31 n; pond b: 0.6 ha, 10.3 kgæha )1 bream, 40 n). the stocked ﬁsh 30 n; 75.3 kgæha remained in the ponds until the end of the experiment. about 50% of adult perch and about 85% of adult bream were recovered by the ﬁsh extraction at the end of the experiment. the total length (tl) of adult perch was 25.5 ± 4.5 cm at stocking and 30.9 ± 2.7 cm at the ﬁsh extraction while bream were 45.2 ± 3.5 cm )1 perch, 12 n; 79.0 kgæha 476 respectively. the aim of and 48.2 ± 2.5 cm, the stocking scheme was to achieve a ratio of 1:10 of yoy perch to yoy bream after 14 days, which should mimic the natural competitive relationship in lakes from that area. this ratio depended on the number of eggs produced per kilogram of female ﬁsh and the survival rate of the hatched larvae in their ﬁrst 14 days (for perch: thorpe 1977; for bream: ku- charczyk et al. 1997). about 35,000 perch larvae and 350,000 bream larvae per hectare were expected in each of the ponds. no differences in water chemistry or food availability of zooplankton and macrozoo- benthos were observed between the two ponds during the sampling season (for details: see supporting data tables s1 and s2). fish sampling from the beginning of may until the beginning of july, the ﬁsh larvae and juveniles were caught once a week and from then on every 4 weeks until the end of the experiments in september. five different standard methods were applied: (1) larvae nets of different sizes (34 or 40 cm2 diameter, 1 mm mesh size), (2) a bongo (42 cm diameter, 500 lm mesh size, 1.7 m net length), (3) point abundance sampling by electroﬁsh- ing carried out with portable electroﬁshing equipment (deka 3000 lord) using a small ring anode (10 cm diameter), (4) a beach seine (1 mm mesh size, 10 m length) and (5) a pop-up net (2 mm mesh size, area 50 · 100 cm). the methods 1 and 2 were used for the earlier sample occasions while the others were used from then on. all sampled yoy ﬁsh were preserved in 4% formaldehyde solution. at the end of the exper- iments, the ponds were drained between september 25th and 28th 2001 by attaching a box (4 mm mesh size) to the drainage pipe. this allowed us to catch all ﬁsh and to measure subsamples to determine the length-frequency distribution (total [mm]). individuals of yoy perch from the small and large size class were preserved in 4% formaldehyde for analysis of the stomach content or were frozen for )1) for stable isotopes analysis. growth rates (mm day the small and large sized yoy perch were calculated as the difference of means in tl at their ﬁrst appearance and at the end of the experiment. length, stomach content analysis stomach contents of 10 randomly selected yoy perch were analysed biweekly if available. the gut content was identiﬁed to species or genus level and at least 10 randomly selected individuals of each prey were measured. biomasses were calculated as wet weight using length-weight regressions (bottrell et al. 1976; mehner et al. 1995). stable isotope analysis at the end of the experiments, individuals of the small and large-sized yoy perch from both ponds were taken for stable isotope analysis. 20 samples of muscle tissue of frozen perch were prepared from each size class, dried over night at 60 °c, freeze-dried with ﬂuid nitrogen and homogenised with a mortar. these samples were analysed for stable nitrogen ratios using an elemental analyzer (carlo erba na 1500) with an interface (conﬂo iii) connected to a mass spectrometer (deltaplus thermo finnigan). stable isotope data are presented as the difference between ratios of the samples to a standard (d = 15n ⁄ 14n), expressed as units per mil (&). as a standard for d15n, ammonium sulphate iaea-n-2 (d = 20.3) was used. results perch and bream larvae ﬁrst appeared in mid-may. however, the total amount of ﬁsh caught before the drainage of the ponds in september was small, despite the use of a variety of sampling methods. 281 perch and 19 bream were caught in pond a at 10 sampling occasions during the season while 1100 perch and 45 bream were caught in pond b (for details: see supporting data table s3). the size distribution of yoy perch was unimodal during the sampling season in both ponds and yoy perch grew from about 15 mm in may to about 30 mm at the end of july. at the end of the experiments, the ﬁsh extraction revealed a high abundance of yoy perch with 17,000 perch in pond a and 30,000 perch in pond b, which is about 51% and 69% of the calculated numbers 14 days after hatching, respectively. the size distribution of the yoy perch was exceptionally wide, with sizes ranging from 32 mm up to 168 mm tl (fig. 1). two size classes of yoy perch were deﬁned: small (< 100 mm tl), and large (>100 mm tl). the share of individuals of the large size class was 11% for pond a and 10% for pond b. in terms of biomass, however, the large-sized yoy perch contributed from 86% (pond a) to 62% (pond b). the mean growth rate during the experi- mental period for the yoy perch from the small size )1 class was 0.35 mmæday for the large size class. only a few yoy bream were caught in ponds a and b (56 bream in pond a, 71 bream in pond b); their size distributions were unimodal with a mean of 109 mm tl (sd ± 5 mm) for pond a and 121 mm tl (sd ± 4 mm) for pond b. )1, while it was 0.85 mmæday stomach content analysis the diet composition of perch caught from may to september was investigated for 165 perch (pond a: n = 75;

radke & eckmann 1999; persson et al. 2000). only few studies observed extreme growth of yoy perch up to 15 cm, e.g., a study of yoy perch feeding on neomysis integer (houthuijzen et al. 1993; van densen et al. 1996), feeding on bream larvae (beeck et al. 2002), or feeding on a diet mixture of ﬁsh larvae and mysids (borcherding et al. 2007). although no age estimation of the yoy perch was conducted in the present study, it was evident that they were in their ﬁrst summer since experimental ponds were ﬁshless before the 478 study and yoy perch were signiﬁcantly lower in size compared to the stocked adult perch. information about from other ﬁsh species (e.g., pikeperch, sander lucioperca) it is well known that a bimodal size distribution can be induced by the onset of piscivory in some individuals of yoy that resulted in different growth rates (van densen et al. 1996; frankiewicz et al. 1999). for analysing whether size divergences in the yoy perch were caused by an alternative use of food resources, stomach contents and stable isotopes signatures were investigated. while stomach content analyses reveal the short-term feeding behaviour of organisms, naturally occurring stable isotopes provide information about the long- term feeding behaviour (beaudoin et al. 1999) and, thus, reveal features of the food web that otherwise would not be detectable. d15n is accumulated while ascending the food web, revealing the trophic position of an organism in the food web from phytoplankton to piscivorous ﬁsh (pinnegar & polunin 2000). in the present study, the size classes of yoy perch differed signiﬁcantly in their d15n signatures with a difference of about 2&. differences of 3.4& are normally seen between two trophic levels (vander zanden et al. 1997; gaye-siessegger et al. 2004) and reﬂect the different position in the food web. therefore, stable isotope data suggested that large-sized individuals of yoy perch had used food resources of a higher trophic level than individuals of the small-sized yoy perch. the analyses of stomach contents at the end of the experiment showed a different short-term feeding behaviour of the two size classes. at this time, the large-sized yoy perch were mainly cannibalistic while the small-sized yoy perch were planktivorous or benthivorous. cannibalism in percids occurs frequently (claessen et al. 2000; persson et al. 2000, 2006;) and can start at a size of 10.5 mm tl (brabrand 1995). cannibalism may serve as an additional food resource for the large size class of yoy perch and may have contributed to their extreme growth, a phenomenon also described for et al. 1999). the yoy pikeperch (frankiewicz catches period were restricted solely to the small size class of yoy perch and therefore for this period no data were available for the large size class. the stomach content analyses of individuals of the small-sized yoy perch demonstrated a switch from zooplanktivorous to zoobenthivorous feeding during the season. combin- ing the results of the stomach content analyses and of stable isotope signatures, however, data provide good evidence that size differences in yoy perch might be induced by the use of different food resources. samples taken during the experimental season did not indicate a piscivorous feeding of yoy perch on experimental during the yoy bream, which is attributed to the fact that only the small size class was caught during the experi- mental season. from our studies in gravel pit lakes (beeck et al. 2002) as well as recent studies in the same ﬁsh ponds (heermann & borcherding, unpub- lished data) we know quite well that yoy perch begin to prey on bream larvae from a size of about 28 mm tl onwards, and that large numbers of bream are then eaten within a few weeks only. therefore, we assume a potential predation of yoy perch on yoy bream also in the present study. juvenile ﬁsh: in the growth rates of in addition to an alternative use of food resources, other factors might have initiated the occurrence of size differences in yoy perch. (1) a different timing of hatching could enable cannibalism by perch larvae on their smaller siblings, resulting in a bimodal size distribution (brabrand 1995). (2) individual varia- tions the differences in growth rates are increased by intense competition for food resources, resulting in growth retardation among the weaker competitors, while the ﬁtter individuals are only slightly inﬂuenced by their competitors (staffan et al. 2005). (3) patchy prey distribution: this may have caused random effects that enabled some juveniles to forage on better prey from a bioenergetic point of view. individual forag- ing behaviour and specialisation could have the same effect (bolnick et al. 2003). moreover, adult perch remained in the ponds until the end of the experi- ments and could potentially affect the size distribu- tion of yoy perch by size-dependent predation. maybe the foraging success was higher on a certain size class of the yoy perch (lundvall et al. 1999), affecting individual boldness and by that competition for food (westerberg et al. 2004; magnhagen & borcherding 2007). in summary, the stocking of adult perch and bream in previous ﬁshless ponds resulted in intra-cohort variation in the growth of yoy perch with a broad size distribution ranging from 32 to 168 mm. the combination of stomach content analyses and stable isotopes signatures provide evidence that size diver- gence in the yoy perch were caused by the alternative use of food resources. it is assumed that these ﬂexible diet shifts in early ontogeny together with fast growth and the development of a bimodal size distribution represent a more general character- istic, which may be valid also for other aquatic ecosystems. results further implicate that age deter- mination of yoy perch might be a necessary analysis in ﬁeld studies. acknowledgements thanks are due to lennart persson and pa¨r bystro¨m (umea university, sweden) for helpful suggestions on an earlier version intra-cohort variation in the size of yoy perch of the manuscript. we thank the a. pilgram ﬁsh farm (lohmar, germany) for providing the ponds free of charge and for all their support during the experiments. we are also grateful to alexandra doll, gero heinze, bozena hermasch, stephanie kiel and patrizia murawski for ﬁeld assistance, and to jelle eygensteyn for his assistance with the stable isotope analysis. jan klerkx edited the english text. this is cwe publication nr. 373. references beaudoin, c.p., tonn, w.m., prepas, e.e. & wassenaar, l.i. 1999. individual specialization and trophic adaptability of northern pike (esox lucius): an isotope and dietary analysis. oecologia 120: 386–396. beeck, p., tauber, s., kiel, s. & borcherding, j. 2002. 0 + perch predation on 0 + bream: a case study on a eutrophic gravel pit lake. freshwater biology 47: 2359–2369. berezina, n.a. & strel’nikova, a.p. 2001. relationships between the food spectrum of perch fry (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) and the structure of zoobenthos in experimental meso- cosms. biology bulletin 28: 311–318. bolnick, d.i., svanba¨ck, r., fordyce, j.a., yang, l.h., davis, j.m., hulsey, c.d. & forister, m.l. 2003. the ecology of individuals: incidence and implications of individual special- ization. the american naturalist 161: 1–28. borcherding, j., maw, s.k. & tauber, s. 2000. growth of 0 + perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) predating on 0 + bream (abramis brama). ecology of freshwater fish 9: 236–241. borcherding, j., hermasch, b. & murawski, p. 2007. field observations and laboratory experiments on growth and lipid content of young-of-the-year perch. ecology of freshwater fish 16: 198–209. bottrell, h.h., duncan, a., gliwicz, z.m., grygierek, e., herzig, a., hillbricht-ilkowska, a., kurasawa, h., larsson, p. & weglenska, t. 1976. a review of some problems in zooplankton production studies. norwegian journal of zool- ogy 24: 419–456. brabrand, a. 1995. intra-cohort cannibalism among larval stages of perch (perca ﬂuviatilis). ecology of freshwater fish 4: 70–76. buijse, a.d. & houthuijzen, r.p. 1992. piscivory, growth, and size-selective mortality of age 0 pikeperch (stizostedion lucioperca). canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 49: 894–902. bystro¨m, p. & garcia-berthou, e. 1999. density dependent growth and size speciﬁc competitive interactions in young ﬁsh. oikos 86: 217–232. claessen, d., de roos, a.m. & persson, l. 2000. dwarfs and giants: cannibalism and competition in size-structured pop- ulations. american naturalist 155: 219–237. frankiewicz, p., dabrowski, k., martyniak, a. & zalewski, m. 1999. cannibalism as a regulatory force of pikeperch, stizostedion lucioperca (l.), population dynamics in the lowland sulejow reservoir (central poland). hydrobiologia 409: 47–55. galarowicz, t.l. & wahl, d.h. 2005. foraging by a young-of- the-year piscivore: the role of predator size, prey type, and density. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 62: 2330–2342. 479 urbatzka et al. gaye-siessegger, j., focken, u., muetzel, s., abel, h. & becker, k. 2004. feeding level and individual metabolic rate affect 13c and 15n values in carp: implications for food web studies. oecologia 138: 175–183. hartmann, j. 1983. two feeding strategies of young ﬁsh. archiv fu¨r hydrobiologie 96: 496–509. heermann, l., beeck, p. & borcherding, j. 2007. two size classes of 0 + perch: is phenotypic plasticity based on food resources?
