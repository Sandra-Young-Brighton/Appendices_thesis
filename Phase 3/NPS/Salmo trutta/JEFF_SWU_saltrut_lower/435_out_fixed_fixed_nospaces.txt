(1998). we reported that energetic expenditure of repeat spawning brown_trout was higher (in both speciﬁc and absolute terms) than that of ﬁrst-time spawners. the mass speciﬁc expenditure of energy by spawning females was about 20%, compared to about 10% for males. survival of ﬁrst time spawners was about 0.90, but only about 0.55 for repeat spawners (berg et al. 1998). the total energy loss during spawning are about 30% for females and 14% for males (hendry & berg 1999). the aim of the present investigation was to de- termine and describe the seasonal changes in body composition of the trout population with particu- lar emphasis on the assessment of the energy status of the ﬁsh before, during and after the winter period, thereby revealing the potential impact of the winter period on the ﬁsh. material and methods brown_trout were captured in estenstaddammen, a small (0.068 km2), dimictic lake, situated in central norway (63(cid:190)23¿n, 10(cid:190)31¿e) at an altitude of 250 m a.s.l. the deepest part of the lake is 4.1 m, and vegetation covers about 70% of the bottom. con- ductivity was 110 ms ` cm»1, total hardness 3.3(cid:190) dh, and ph close to 7.5 during the entire period of investigation. in spite of some enrichment, the lake is classiﬁed as being oligo-humic. the lake was covered with ice from 26 october 1992 to 14 may 1993, a total of 200 days. water temperatures (table 1) were determined in samples taken by a ruttner sampler from each depth meter. this was done at each sampling period at approximately monthly intervals. brown_trout is the only ﬁsh species present in the lake. the lake is utilized as a municipal water supply, and ﬁshing has been prohibited for the past 40 years. two creeks that run in to the lake are used by the trout for spawning. waterfalls restrict upstream migration, so there are only short stretches (a few hundred meters) in the creeks that can be used for spawning. peak spawning was be- tween 25 and 29 september 1993. table 1. water temperatures ((cid:190)c) at different depths in the lake estenstaddam- men during the investigation period, 1992–1993 depth (m) sep nov dec feb mar apr may jun aug sep 5.5 5.0 4.9 4.8 2.7 3.4 3.9 3.9 2.2 3.3 3.9 4.3 2.3 3.7 3.7 3.7 0.4 2.2 3.0 3.0 0.8 1.5 3.5 3.5 5.7 5.1 5.1 5.1 14.1 15.2 12.7 15.2 12.4 14.9 12.1 14.7 7.7 7.5 6.8 6.7 1 2 3 4 164 trout were sampled at approximately monthly intervals between 25 september 1992 and 29 sep- tember 1993. sampling was done using gill nets (size 25.0 m(cid:192)1.5 m) with mesh sizes of 12.5, 16.5 19.5, 24, 29 and 35 mm, placed in a random se- quence along the shore. the gill nets were set in the evening, left for about 14 h and pulled in the morning. when the lake was covered with ice, the nets were pulled using 30-m-long, bottom-weighted ropes. the ﬁsh were taken to the laboratory for further processing. sampling was at about monthly intervals and 737 ﬁsh were captured, of which 366 were taken for the determination of fat and protein content throughout the year. for proximate determination, we tried to sample a material of immature and ma- ture, male and female ﬁsh. during the spawning period 141 maturing or spawned ﬁsh were cap- tured (energetics reported by berg et al. 1998). these were excluded in these analyses of seasonal variation in energetics leaving 225 ﬁsh altogether. cpue (catch per unit effort: mean capture per net-night) was similar at the beginning and end of the investigation (18.1 in september 1992 and 22.5 in september 1993), so it was concluded that the population of trout had been relatively undis- turbed by the sampling. in the laboratory, the trout were measured (total length, mm) and weighed (ﬁsh (cid:176)110 g to the near- est 0.05 g, larger ﬁsh to the nearest 1.0 g). scale samples were taken for age determination, the ﬁsh were dissected to determine sex, and maturation stage (1–7; dahl 1917). stomach contents were then removed and, thereafter, the ﬁsh were frozen (»24(cid:190)c) in individually marked plastic bags. fish were thawed at room temperature for about 30 min prior to determination of fat and protein content. the loss in mass from fresh to thawed ﬁsh was less than 3% on average. the ﬁsh were placed on pre-weighed pieces of aluminium-foil, weighed (precision 10»4 ` g – sauter ar70 scale), and placed in a drying cabinet (55(cid:190)c) for 20 days, after which stable dry-mass values were obtained. the dry carcasses were crushed to improve solvent ex- traction. fat content was determined gravi- metrically, after fat extraction in a solvent consist- ing of petrol-ether (ﬁve parts) and chloroform (one part) (dobush et al. 1985; randall et al. 1991). fat extraction was carried out in two steps (3„3 days), with fresh solvent being used for the second step (gardiner & geddes 1980; reznick 1983). the sol- vent:tissue ratio was kept above 10. after fat ex- traction, each sample was dried for 24 h (55(cid:190)c) and reweighed. protein content was estimated as the mass differ- ence between the fat free samples and the ash left after combustion (12 h at 550(cid:190)c). carbohydrates table 2. sampling periods and numbers of brown_trout (small (cid:176)5 winters;

jonsson & jonsson 1997), and ignoring this component intro- duced little error. further details of the methods and calculations can be found in gardiner & geddes (1980), reznick (1983) and berg & brem- set (1998). total energy content of each ﬁsh was estimated as the sum of fat and protein energy, where fat was assigned a value 39 kj ` g»1 and protein 24 kj ` g»1 (jobling 1995). energy values are quoted as either total energy or mass speciﬁcally (total energy di- vided by total fresh mass). to enable a seasonal comparison of energetics, the reproducing ﬁsh were excluded during the au- tumn spawning period. during the period de- cember–august, the effects of maturation were in- signiﬁcant on speciﬁc values of fat, protein and en- ergy. the ﬁsh sampled in the two september samples (25 september 1992 and 29 september 1993) were treated as one sample. the year was further divided into two seasons: the winter (ice covered) period from october to may (october and may included as beginning and end) and the ice-free period from may to october. these periods have been analyzed separately. based on the age and size structure (table 3) of the sampled ﬁsh, the data analysis of the body composition was performed on the young (those 4 winters or less; n‰117) and old (5 winters; n‰108). the young ﬁsh had a mean length of 175 mm body composition of brown_trout (range 124 mm) and mean mass of 64 g, while the corresponding values for old ﬁsh were 224 mm (range 129 mm) and 124 g. mean age of males at ﬁrst spawning was 3.2 winters, whereas that of fe- males were 4.4 (berg et al. 1998). mean weight for all ﬁsh in the material was 93 g. the two sub- groups will therefore be named small or large in the further text. the small trout mainly comprised immature and virgin spawners, while the large ﬁsh had reproduced at least once (berg et al. 1998). the distribution of the main parameters: fresh mass and the mass speciﬁc values for fat, protein and total energy content, did not deviate signiﬁ- cantly (p(cid:176)0.05) from normality as revealed by the kolmogorov-smirnov test. comparisons of the different parameters during the sampling periods, were made using an analysis of covariance, with ﬁsh mass as a covariate. nonsigniﬁcant interaction effects in the ancova analyses were deleted to obtain the ﬁnal model. results the mass-speciﬁc protein content was highly sig- niﬁcantly (p(cid:176)0.001; r‰0.4; df‰224) correlated with ﬁsh mass. the mass speciﬁc protein content (fig. 1) changed signiﬁcantly during the ice-free period for both small trout (p(cid:176)0.03; ancova with mass as a covariate; f‰2.8; df‰4), large trout (p(cid:176)0.001; f‰5.4; df‰4), as the speciﬁc protein content increased during the ice-free period. in ad- dition to the speciﬁc protein increase, the average growth of ﬁsh was 30 mm during the ice-free period (based on back-calculated growth after last winter-zone on the scales – see table 3), corre- sponding to a mass increase of 35 g and thus en- ergy amounting about 220 kj (based on mean spe- ciﬁc energy for all ﬁsh). from the highest level of speciﬁc protein in december, the mass-speciﬁc pro- tein content decreased during winter for large (p(cid:176)0.001; f‰7.5; df‰4), whereas small trout had a nonsigniﬁcant change. the mass speciﬁc fat (fig. 2) content was not correlated with ﬁsh mass (p¶0.25; r‰0.08; df‰ 224). for the large ﬁsh there was a signiﬁcant (p(cid:176)0.007; f‰3.9; df‰4) decrease in both the mass table 3. number of ﬁsh (n), mean length (mm) and weight (g) at age, and back-calculated length (mm) for the brown_trout back calculated length after age (winters) 2 3 4 5 n 23 28 66 108 length weight winter 1 winter 2 winter 3 winter 4 winter 5 135 165 193 224 29 52 81 124 58 56 56 60 99 96 92 87 132 127 122 164 157 193 165 berg et al. fig. 1. mean mass-speciﬁc protein content of (a) small (four winters and younger) brown_trout, (b) large (ﬁve winters old), according to seasonal sampling periods (september 1992–sep- tember 1993). standard error bars are indicated for each mean value, and sample size (n) is given. speciﬁc and total fat contents during the ice-free period, whereas no such effect was found among the smaller ﬁsh. during winter the speciﬁc fat con- tent increased among the large (p(cid:176)0.02; f‰3.2; df‰4) ﬁsh, whereas this relationship was non-sig- niﬁcant for the small trout (p(cid:176)0.16). the overall trend during winter was an increase, whereas a pronounced decline in fat content was noticeable between december and february, this drop was signiﬁcant (p(cid:176)0.003; t-test) only for the largest ﬁsh. when the body growth are taken into consider- ation, there was a signiﬁcant (p(cid:176)0.001) increase in total energy, largely as protein energy during the ice-free period. during winter there was a signiﬁ- cant decrease in protein energy (p(cid:176)0.003; anco- va with mass as a covariate; f‰4.3; df‰4), in- crease in fat energy (p(cid:176)0.001; f‰4.7; df‰4) and increase in total energy (p(cid:176)0.007; f‰3.7; df‰4), and the trout had considerably higher energy con- tent at the end of the winter. the mass speciﬁc energy content (fig. 3) of small trout signiﬁcantly (p(cid:176)0.004; f‰4.1; df‰4) increased during the ice-free period, whereas such a trend was not signiﬁcant among large trout. the changes in speciﬁc energy content was similar to that of speciﬁc fat during winter, and the speciﬁc energy content trout (p(cid:176)0.008; f‰3.7; df‰4) whereas the small trout had no such trend (p‰0.16). increased among large fig. 2. mean mass-speciﬁc fat content of (a) small and (b) large brown_trout, according to seasonal sampling periods (septemb- er 1992–september 1993). standard error bars are indicated for each mean value, and sample size (n) is given. fig. 3. mean mass-speciﬁc energy content of (a) small and (b) large brown_trout, according to seasonal sampling periods. standard error bars are indicated for each mean value, and sample size (n) is given. 166 to sum up, the ice-free period is characterized by an increase in speciﬁc protein and total content for all ﬁsh with a decrease in fat among larger ﬁsh. during winter there was an increase in speciﬁc fat, in particular among the larger sized ﬁsh, while there was a general decrease in speciﬁc protein con- tent among both size groups. the speciﬁc energy content during winter follows the trends found for speciﬁc fat content. regression equations of the changes in parameters such as mass-speciﬁc fat, protein and energy and total energy during the winter period (200 days) and subsequently for the ice-free period (may–october) were calculated from the linear the (monthly) sampling periods against the parameters above. the winter energy budget for a typical trout (mean mass of the ﬁsh was 93 g) will yield a total protein loss of »14 kj and total fat gain of 32 kj. based on the regression equations, there was a net energy gain of 17.8 kj during winter (200 days) or a energy gain of 0.09 kj ` day»1. the correspond- ing daily value for the ice-free period was about 1.4 kj ` day»1, or about 14 times higher. discussion the autumn spawning period represents a speciﬁc life history stage, and energy allocation during spawning has been reported elsewhere (berg et al. 1998). in this investigation, the spawning ﬁsh were excluded during the spawning period, with a corre- sponding low number of ﬁsh representing the au- tumn situation. the spawning ﬁsh are typically those with the highest energy content before spawning (e.g. metcalfe et al. 1988; metcalfe & thorpe 1992; berg et al. 1998). consequently, the seasonal energetic differences during the ice-free period may be somewhat underestimated, while the winter energetic situation may be over- estimated. nevertheless, there is a lack of detailed information about the seasonal energetics of fresh- water ﬁsh in temperate and arctic environments (e.g. jørgensen et al. 1997; forseth et al. 1999). the term growth signiﬁes a change in magni- tude. growth is typically measured as a change in length or mass during a speciﬁc period of time, but can also be measured in energetic terms (e.g. weatherley & gill 1987), and the energetic changes during speciﬁc periods of time may deviate from the growth pattern observed when conventional measurements are used. brown_trout are reported to grow mainly during the summer when water temperatures lie above 4–7(cid:190)c (e.g. elliott 1976, 1982, 1994; wootton 1990; elliott et al. 1995), but koskela et al. (1997) reported considerable growth of brown_trout under rearing conditions at tem- peratures down to 2(cid:190)c (growth rate 0.19% day»1). body composition of brown_trout the weight growth should correspond to a body growth of about 1.6 kj ` day»1 (for a 100-g ﬁsh). the energetic growth for their ﬁsh under rearing conditions should be expected to be signiﬁcantly higher than values obtained from wild ﬁsh and correspond to our ice-free values, whereas our cor- responding winter value was about 0.09 kj ` day»1. the winter protein growth recorded by koskela et al. (1997) is 16 times higher than that recorded for the wild trout during winter, but feed quality and quantity for trout in hatchery environments can explain such a difference. growth of salmonids under low water temperatures have also been re- ported by higgins (1985) and higgins & talbot (1985), who reported that growth rates of atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) increased rapidly as water temperatures increased from 1(cid:190)c (growth rate 0.02%) to about 7(cid:190)c. the largest ﬁsh showed a proportionally larger loss in protein during winter, which was matched by a larger gain in protein content during the ice- free period. this result is in contrast to those pub- lished by cargnelli & gross (1997) for bluegill sun- ﬁsh (lepomis macrochirus), which do not feed dur- ing the wintertime. cargnelli & gross (1997) found that the larger individuals emerged from the winter in better condition. losses in the fat and protein contents of salmonid ﬁshes have previously been detected as a reduction in condition during the winter (cunjak & power 1987). the smaller ﬁsh in estenstaddammen had the fastest replenishment of their energy stores. this was to be expected, on account of their smaller body size (jobling 1995). fat has low mass per energy unit and has almost no water-binding property compared to protein. the winter protein loss is accompanied by a water loss, which accounts for a mass loss of about ﬁve times the protein mass loss (jobling 1995), leading to an eventual decrease in total body mass, but still the ﬁsh may increase in energy content during the wintertime. larger sized ﬁsh had the largest loss in protein mass-speciﬁc terms, whereas smaller indi- viduals had a lower loss and try to economize, in accordance with the results of gardiner & geddes (1980). during the summertime, the protein are re- plenished and a relatively large amount of energy is allocated to growth in mass and length during the summertime. an increase in fat content in wintertime has pre- viously been reported as a considerable build-up of stored energy, in particular of fat, among imma- ture brown_trout, during the autumn spawning period in august–december (berg et al. 1998). there was obviously an abundant food supply in estenstaddammen during the spawning period. we investigated the energy expenditure involved dur- ing spawning, comparing immatures, virgin and 167 berg et al. repeat spawners, before and after the spawning period. the gonadal build-up by the females in- volves a considerably greater energy expenditure than the corresponding build-up by the males. the onset of maturation divides the life-cycle into stages, preparation and fulﬁllment. an optimal age and size at maturity is attained when the beneﬁts and costs of maturation at different ages and sizes balance (e.g., stearns 1992). during the spawning period, there is a large and evident difference be- tween the energy budgets of the spawners and the immature ﬁsh. during the rest of the year this dif- ference is not so conspicuous, and the reduction in the difference between groups of ﬁsh is due to the fact that all size groups must conserve their energy content and mass in order to optimize their future reproductive capacity (lessells 1991). the mass-speciﬁc content of protein and fat of the smaller trout increased during the ice-free sea- son, in contrast to the larger trout, which showed a considerable loss in fat content. the estimated decrease in fat of the larger trout may be somewhat too high, as the sample sizes of the immature, large-sized ﬁsh during the late summer and au- tumn is small. the mean energy content recorded for the autumn samples of trout from estenstad- dammen is similar to that found for anadromous and resident brown_trout in the southern part of norway (jonsson & jonsson 1997). the trout in estenstaddammen are generally small in body size, and the larger trout may typically exceed their op- timal size for the available food resources in their maximization of body size. their reproductive suc- cess, however, may be enhanced and they typically invest more resources into reproduction, as com- pared to the virgin spawners. there is a consider- able mortality among these larger individuals when they reproduce (berg et al. 1998), in contrast to the virgin spawners. the larger individuals therefore appear to be oversized for their available food resources, whereas they allocate more in their ﬁnal and capital reproduction. capital and income breeding are alternative tactics of resource use in reproduction (jo¨nsson 1997). the increased meta- bolic costs of an increase in body size may give rise to niche shifts (e.g. forseth et al. 1994; forseth et al. 1999), but for this stunted population in a small lake there are probably neither size differences, habitat heterogeneity nor physical space for any great degree of such divergence. there is therefore a rapid increase in mortality rate, coupled with an increase in the allocation of resources to repro- duction, with increasing ﬁsh size (berg et al. 1998). this may explain the small span of body length, which gives stunted populations. finally, the winter situation for the lentic brown_trout in the estenstaddammen is compared with 168 that of the lotic brown_trout in the nearby river humla (berg & bremset 1998). water tempera- tures in this river are around 0(cid:190)c during the win- tertime, while the river is covered with ice. at such a low temperature, no fat accumulation occurs, and both young trout and salmon decrease their energy reserves throughout winter. under such winter conditions the salmonids living there may be put under considerable stress (berg & bremset 1998). the maintenance of energy supplies by lotic salmonids has led to an increased interest in studies of the energy allocation by salmonids living in running waters (e.g. bull et al. 1996; valdimars- son et al. 1997; valdimarsson & metcalfe 1998; clarke & johnston 1999; metcalfe et al. 1999). the situation in lakes is different, because the trout ac- cumulate energy reserves during wintertime. in the temperate zone, therefore, there may be a contrast between the lentic and lotic habitats in regard to the severity of winter for salmonid ﬁsh. further- more, the hypolimnic zone of lakes may provide favorable conditions for ﬁsh during wintertime, in contrast to lotic and terrestrial habitats. resumen 1. hemos estudiado las variaciones estacionales en proteinas y grasas de una poblacio´n de crecimiento lento de salmo_trutta de un pequen˜o lago de la regio´n templada. en invierno, el lago se cubre de hielo durante 200 dias y la temperatura media del agua en el hipolimnion alcanza los 4(cid:190)c. 2. durante el invierno se produce un incremento en grasas espe- cı´ﬁcas, en particular, entre los individuos de mayor taman˜o mientras que decrece el contenido en proteinas especı´ﬁcas tanto en las truchas menores ((cid:176)5 inviernos) como en los mayores (–5 an˜os). durante el invierno (ﬁnales de octubre–mediados de mayo) una trucha promedio gana 32 kj de grasas pero el conte- nido en energı´a proteica decrece 14 kj por lo que el incremento neto de energı´a es de 18 kj de grasas equivalente a una ganancia de energı´a diaria de 0.09 kj. durante la estacio´n sin hielo (me- diados de mayo – ﬁnales de octubre), las truchas incrementan fundamentalmente el contenido proteico con ganancias de ener- gı´a diarias de 1.4 kj ` dia»1, valor 14 veces mayor que el corres- pondiente al invierno. 3. las truchas que viven en lagos pueden almacenar cantidades considerables de lı´pidos durante el invierno en contraste a la perdida de reservas de grasas observada en poblaciones de tru- chas de rı´o de la misma regio´n que se enfrentan a temperaturas de agua ma´s bajas durante el invierno. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge professor claus bech for introducing us to this method of determining fat and protein content and per harald olsen for valuable ﬁeld
