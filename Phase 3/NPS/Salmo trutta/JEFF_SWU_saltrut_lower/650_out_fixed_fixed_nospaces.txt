species-at-risk; ammocrypta pellucida; life history introduction limited biological information exists for eastern sand darter (ammocrypta pellucida), listed as a threatened species by canada’s species at risk act (sara) and globally vulnerable (g3) by natureserve and the iucn (edwards et al. 2007; cosewic 2009). east- ern sand darter were originally distributed along a lat- itudinal gradient that extended from southern kentucky and the southern reaches of the ohio river watershed to southern lake huron, but now exist in a more restricted, disjunct distribution, particularly along the original northern fringe of the canadian distribution (fig. 1; trautman 1981; page (38–46°n) & burr 1991; grandmaison et al. 2004; cosewic 2009). throughout the existing range, populations are declining likely due to habitat destruction, primarily as a result of the siltation of sandy substrates from bank erosion and altered stream hydrology (scott & crossman 1973; daniels 1993; holm & mandrak 1996; dextrase et al. 2003; cosewic 2009). point and nonpoint water contamination, invasive species (e.g., round goby, neogobius melanostomus), lack of genetic variation and baitﬁsh harvest-related mortality are also thought to have contributed to population declines (holm & mandrak 1996; cudmore et al. 2004; edwards et al. 2007). as a result eastern sand darter are listed as a species at risk in 9 of the 11 correspondence: m. power, university of waterloo, department of biology, 200 university avenue west, waterloo, ontario, n2l 3g1, canada. e-mail: m3power@sciborg.uwaterloo.ca 234 doi: 10.1111/eff.12021 biological traits of eastern sand darter fig. 1. map showing the global distribution of eastern sand darter and sampling sites located in the lower thames river, ontario and the little muskingum river, ohio. jurisdictions in which it occurs (cosewic 2009). given, the imperilled status of this species, increased knowledge of biological traits are important for the development of management and conservation strate- gies. speciﬁcally, knowledge on traits such as fecun- dity and growth are important in population viability modelling by providing valuable insight into future population trends. in addition to the paucity of biological information on eastern sand darter, there is limited detail on geo- graphical variation among populations. the biologi- cal traits of other ﬁsh species are known to differ substantially within different areas of the species range (conover & present 1990; conover 1992), with environmental factors such as temperature having a more pronounced inﬂuence on growth at the range edge (power & van den heuvel 1999). the single best source of biological information on eastern sand darter is an unpublished thesis focusing on a popula- tion from salt creek, ohio (spreitzer 1979). subse- quent studies on eastern sand darter have focused largely on: (i) determining presence/absence for pop- ulation status reports (holm & mandrak 1996; facey 1998; grandmaison et al. 2004; cosewic 2009), (ii) description of preferred habitats (daniels 1993; drake et al. 2008; o’brien & facey 2008), (iii) con- ducting laboratory studies on fossorial behav- iour (daniels 1989; simon 1991) and (iv) captive reproduction and larval development (johnston 1989; simon et al. 1992; simon & wallus 2006). most of the studies have been descriptive in nature, providing only limited insights into the aspects of population dynamics (e.g., fecundity, cohort structure) needed to quantify extinction risks or develop suitable recovery plans. given the paucity of population-speciﬁc biological data, this study uses data obtained from two seasons of ﬁeld studies on eastern sand darter populations in the lower thames river, ontario, to estimate important population traits (e.g., fecundity, maturity, growth). we then compare traits of eastern sand darter from the lower thames river to those of a more southerly population from the little muskin- gum river, ohio, to characterise possible geographi- cal variation in eastern sand darter traits within their range. materials and methods lower thames river sampling the lower thames river is a regulated 7th-order river with channel widths of 40–50 m. the river is turbid and highly productive, ﬂowing predominately through agricultural land from the conﬂuence of its north and south branch tributaries to lake st. clair, 235 finch et al. ontario (upper thames river conservation author- ity 2009). based on comparison with historical sam- pling surveys, edwards et al. (2007) and cosewic (2009) have suggested that the lower thames river has the largest eastern sand darter population(s) in canada. the designation of eastern sand darter under sara, necessitated the use of nonlethal sampling methodologies, a fact which restricted lethal sampling to accidental mortalities. all eastern sand darter cap- ture and handling was approved through the fisheries and oceans canada species at risk permitting pro- cess and the animal care committee sampling proto- col approval process in accordance with the canadian council of animal care guidelines (canadian coun- cil on animal care (ccac) 2005). eastern sand darter were sampled in the lower thames river during the summer months (june– august) of 2006 and 2007. mean annual and summer air temperatures for the sampling years were obtained from the london, ontario station of environment canada’s national climate data and information archive database (http://www.climate.weatherofﬁce. gc.ca/climatedata/canada_e.html). mean annual air temperatures measured 9.1 °c and 8.3 °c for 2006 and 2007, respectively, with corresponding mean summer air temperatures of 19 °c and 19.2 °c. for purposes of sampling consistency, study sites and protocols were the same as those described in drake et al. (2008). sampling was conducted in the large, sandy, shallow depositional area in a portion of the lower thames river (fig. 1). eastern sand darter were captured at 10 depositional areas using a 10-m bag seine (92 m2 enclosure) having 1.8 9 3.7-m wings, 64-mm mesh and 1.8 9 1.8 9 1.8-m bag, with 32-mm.mesh. the total area sampled was 4600 m3 as ﬁve seines were hauled at each depositional area. captured individuals were sedated using clove oil (keene et al. 1998), weighed (g) and measured for total length (mm). eastern sand darter were exam- ined for the presence of either a distended ovideposi- tor or enlarged belly (females) or the release of milt under slight pressure (males), and scales were removed from the left mid-dorsal region for ageing. individuals were revived in oxygenated river water and released back into the river at the capture loca- tion. incidental eastern sand darter mortalities were retained on ice and frozen for subsequent laboratory analyses. potential predator species captured during sampling were kept and their stomach contents examined for eastern sand darter specimens. individual ages were estimated by mounting sam- pled scales between two glass slides and counting the number of annuli at magniﬁcation (109) under a compound microscope (beamish & mcfarlane 1987). age-at-maturity was determined by relating estimated 236 age to ﬁeld observations of gravid females and males (i.e., presence of extended ovidepositors or expression of milt when gently squeezed). for all incidental mor- talities identiﬁed as 0+ ﬁsh, saggitae and lapellae oto- liths were removed and mounted sulcus side up using cyanoacrylate glue and analysed for daily growth ring patterns at the bedford institute of oceanography, otolith research laboratory (campana 2012). data were used to calculate larval emergence dates from which spawning dates were inferred assuming a 5-day incubation period as found in laboratory studies where temperatures were typical of ﬁeld conditions (e.g., 20.5–23 °c; simon & wallus 2006). the numbers of ﬁsh captured in repeated seine hauls were used to estimate site-speciﬁc population abundances using the three-pass maximum-likelihood estimator of junge & libosvarksy (1965). abundance estimates were divided by measured mean area of substrate sampled in each seine haul to obtain density estimates expressed as number of ﬁsh per m2 to standardise for differences in sample site areas. the constant probability of capture assumption of the abundance estimator was tested using a v2-based statistic as described in seber (1982). numbers of aged ﬁsh captured were used to esti- mate annual survival probabilities (s) for studied reaches and seasonal site-speciﬁc survival probabili- ties using chapman-robson methods (chapman & robson 1960; robson & chapman 1961) beginning with the ﬁrst fully vulnerable age-class in the catch, either 0+ or 1+ based on sampling season. weight (w) and length (l) data were used to estimate a regression model of the form w = alb (le cren 1951), after appropriate logarithmic transfor- mation of the data. isometric growth was tested by examining the growth parameter, b, and its associated 95% conﬁdence intervals following wootton (1998). growth parameter values equalling 3 indicate that ﬁsh do not change shape as they increase in length whereas values greater than 3 indicate ﬁsh become lighter as their length increases and values less than 3 indicate ﬁsh become heavier as length increases (wootton 1998). for each of the 2006 and 2007 data sets, total length and ages were used to estimate von bertalanffy growth models of the form lt = l∞ ð1   e  kðt t0þþ, where lt deﬁnes length at time t, l∞ the asymptotic length, k the growth coefﬁcient measuring the rate at which asymptotic size is obtained and t0 is the theoreti- cal age-at-zero length (beverton & holt 1957). clutch size and fecundity analyses were com- pleted using gravid females obtained as incidental mortalities or through retrieval of specimens from predator gut contents during the ﬁrst week of june 2007. ovaries were identiﬁed and removed using a dissecting microscope, weighed (mg) and immersed in gilson’s ﬂuid for preservation and separation of ovarian tissue from ova (bagenal & braum 1968). a gonadosomatic index (gsi) was calculated by expressing wet ovarian mass as a percentage of wet total body mass (bagenal & braum 1968). fecun- dity was determined from mature (ma) and mature ripening (mr) individuals (heins 1985). clutch size was calculated by counting all eggs over 0.7 mm, typically considered to be the size at which egg maturity is reached in percids (simon & wallus 2006). all ova were counted and diameters (mm) mea- sured using northern eclipse image analysis soft- ware (version 7, empix imaging, mississauga, ontario). as preserved eggs can be polygonal in shape (heins 2001), the software calculated diameter by averaging the smallest and largest axes. the result- ing frequency histogram of egg diameter measure- ments were examined for composite distributional structure and decomposed into component normal distributions using bhattacharya’s method (bhattach- arya 1967). the resulting component distributions were then used to identify developmental egg clutches necessary for inferring the presence or absence of multiple clutches. correlations between total length and clutch size were examined using linear regression to estimate standard fecundity-length (f-l) models of the form f = alb (bagenal & braum 1968). little muskingum river sampling air annual for the purposes of examining geographical variation in population traits, data collected in the thames river were compared with data from the little mus- kingum river, ohio, collected between august 2000 –july 2001 and june–october 2005. mean annual and summer air temperatures for the sampling years were obtained from the parkersburg, west virginia station of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration database (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ oa/ncdc.html). mean temperatures measured 13 °c and 12.9 °c for 2001 and 2005, respectively, with corresponding mean summer air temperatures of 20 °c and 21 °c, respectively. the little muskingum river is located in the middle of the species’ distribution range (fig. 1) and is a nar- row (<15 m wide), clear, nonglaciated stream with steep banks, an intact riparian zone and large ground- water inputs located in a largely agricultural area immediately downstream of the wayne national for- est. eastern sand darter samples were obtained from the last 1.2 km of rifﬂe and pool habitat in the river prior to its conﬂuence with the ohio river and were collected with 64 and 32-mm mesh ace-style seines. total area sampled was approximately 6660 m2. on capture specimens were ﬁxed in 10% formalin and stored in 70% ethanol. total length measurements biological traits of eastern sand darter (mm) were collected and scales were removed from the mid-dorsal region for ageing. to aid in statistical analysis for ageing purposes, age groups and their modal lengths were estimated using length fre- quency distribution analysis (lfda, version 5; kirkwood et al. 2001). sex was determined by inspecting the gonads and condition of the genital papillae. egg-bearing females collected during the summer were divided into mature (ma), mature ripening (mr) and ripe (re) classes based on ovary development (heins et al. 1992; heins & machado 1993). egg size was analy- sed from the largest cohort of ova from re females (heins et al. 1992; heins & machado 1993). the diameters of 20 randomly selected ripe ova from each female were measured to the nearest 0.05 mm with an ocular micrometre in a dissecting microscope. diameter was estimated by averaging the largest and smallest axes to account for polygonal shape (heins 2001). clutch size was determined by counting the largest cohort of ova from ma and mr females, with re females excluded because they may have pos- sessed partially spawned clutches (heins et al. 1992; heins & machado 1993). a gonadosomatic index was calculated as the ratio of dried ovary mass to dried carcass mass (barron & albin 2004). statistical comparisons of populations available data on eastern sand darter from the two sites permitted direct statistical comparison of growth (mean size-at-age, von bertalanffy growth models), clutch size, egg diameters, mature female total length and gender ratio. differences between populations for clutch size and egg size were established using two sample t-tests, adjusted for differences in variance as described in zar (1999). differences in gender ratios were examined using fisher’s exact test (zar 1999). statistical tests were performed using jmp 7.02 (sas institute inc, cary, nc, usa) with a = 0.05 signiﬁ- cance level. other biological detail including lon- gevity, age-at-maturity, gonadosomatic index and spawning times could only be descriptively compared. lower thames river von bertalanffy growth curves for 2006 and 2007 estimated using nonlinear regression techniques were compared between years for to similarly estimated curves for the little muskingum river. differences were assessed using analysis of residual sum of squares as follows (chen et al. 1992; haddon 2001): signiﬁcant differences dfi : 237 f ¼

associated degrees of free- dom for the i th population-speciﬁc growth models and m is the number of models compared (haddon 2001). results lower thames river populations a total of 1924 eastern sand darter were captured during sampling, 795 (41.3%) in 2006 and 1129 (58.7%) in 2007. a sub-sample of sexed individuals (n = 145) collected during june and july 2007 found that females dominated the catch, with an overall female to male ratio of 2.54:1. local abundances could not be estimated for all sites owing to low catches and violation of the common probability of capture assumption requirement of zippin population estimators (seber 1982). where local population abundances could be estimated (n = 4), the associ- ated density estimates ranged from 0.23  0.01 to 0.49  0.03 m  2,, with a coefﬁcient of variation of 27.35% among sites (fig. 2). mean river reach annual survival rates  standard deviation for the period 2006–2007 were 0.38  0.03. within season 2007, site-speciﬁc survival esti- mates were lower than annualised rates and ranged from 0.36  0.06 to 0.42  0.04 (fig. 2). eastern sand darter captured in 2006 and 2007 ran- ged in length from 19 to 65 mm, with a mean and standard deviation of 45.9 and 0.21 mm, respec- tively. estimated weight-length regression models indicated allometric growth in both years with the 0.5 0.45 0.4 0.35 0.3 0.25 l a v i v r u s

and the 2007 slope estimated as logew =  11.88 + 2.94logel (r2 = 0.90; df = 1120; regression p < 0.001). four age classes (0+, 1+, 2+, 3+) were identiﬁed based on scales from 743 individuals (n = 272, 2006 and n = 471, 2007). males were identiﬁed up to 2+, whereas females were identiﬁed to 3+. mature individuals for both sexes were observed in the 1+ age-class, indicating age-at-ﬁrst-maturity occurs during the second summer after birth. age- class size ranges were not discreet, as overlap in length-by-age was noted: 0+ (19–55 mm, n = 535); 1+ (35–65 mm, n = 319); 2+ (45–64 mm, n = 169) and 3+ (52–64 mm, n = 11). within season varia- tion in population size structure was evident (fig. 3) as noted in the 2007 length-frequency histograms, with shifts to lengths dominated by 0+ individuals evident as the birth cohorts for the year grew in size. estimated von bertalanffy growth models for 2006 and 2007, respectively, explained a high proportion of the variation in length-at-age (r2 = 0.72 and 0.79). an analysis of the residual sum of squares indicated no signiﬁcant difference between the annual models (f2,19 = 1.23, p = 0.34). the resulting common slope model was estimated as length (mm) = 55.52  1.59 (age + 0.47)), r2 = 0.77 and all estimated (1– e parameter p-values < 0.001. interpretation of growth rings from 0+ individuals (n = 27) estimated ages from 50 to 83 days, with a mean age  standard deviation of 61.67  10.67 days. based on these data, ﬁrst emergence var- ied from early may to the end of june for these indi- viduals. assuming a 5-day average incubation period (simon & wallus 2006), spawning appears to start as early as late april and to continue until late june, although the majority of the examined individuals were spawned in late may or early june in both 2006 and 2007 (fig. 4). for the 10 gravid females collected, the average index  standard deviation of gonadosomatic 0.09  0.03 was not correlated with length (n = 10 r2=0.04, p = 0.57).

sex was determined for 242 individuals, with females dominating the catch in a female: male ratio of 1.16:1. eastern sand darter captured in 2001 and 2005 ranged in length from 18 to 60 mm, with a mean  standard error of 45.0  0.57 mm. three age classes (0+, 1+, 2+) were identiﬁed for both males and females. mature individuals for both sexes were observed in the 1+ age-class, however, laboratory examination found re gonads only in 2+ females, suggesting no spawning occurred in 0+ or 1 + females. age-class size ranges were not discreet, as overlap in length-by-age was noted: 0+ (18–46 mm, n = 64); 1+ (28–60 mm, n = 160) and 2+ (51–60 mm, n = 41). estimated von bertalanffy growth models for 2001 and 2005, respectively, explained a high proportion of the variation in length-at-age (r2 = 0.71 and 0.80). an analysis of the residual sum of squares indicated no signiﬁcant difference between the annual models (f2, 31 = 1.67, p = 0.19). the resulting common slope model was estimated as length (mm) = 55.35 (1 e  1.35 (age + 0.31)), r2 = 0.79 and all estimated parameter p-values <0.001. the presence of re and mr ova in females among captures and the capture dates suggested that spawn- ing began and ended within the month of june. a total of 22 females with an average length  standard deviation of 55.80  0.6 mm, were used for fecun- dity estimates and were found to contain a range of mature ova, 19–97 eggs, with a mean of 61.2  8.2 eggs per individual and a mean ovum diameter  standard deviation of 1.08  0.01 mm. there was no evidence of bimodality in the measured distribution of egg diameters and no signiﬁcant correlation 240 between female r2 = 0.09, p = 0.41). length and fecundity (n = 22, geographical comparison of populations comparison of biological traits between the thames river and little muskingum river populations sug- gest that eastern sand darter in the thames river live longer, grow faster and have smaller eggs than the little muskingum river population (table 1). analy- sis of residual sum of squares indicated a signiﬁcant difference between the population-speciﬁc von berta- lanffy growth models (f2, 39 = 5.42, p < 0.001). although both populations reach maximum length in the 55 mm range, eastern sand darter from the thames river grew at a quicker rate (fig. 6). thus differences in mean size-at-age were found at 0+ (t = 3.98, df = 560, p < 0.001) and 1+ (t = 3.41, df = 199.27, p < 0.001), but not at 2 + (t = 1.90, df = 92.70, p = 0.06). the gender ratio differed signiﬁcantly between populations (fisher exact test, p < 0.001) with the lower thames river having a higher proportion of females. no differences were noted in age-at-ﬁrst- maturity among males (1+) in the two populations, although on the basis of specimens examined females typically spawn at 1+ and in the thames river females in the little muskingum river generally spawn at 2+. there was no signiﬁcant difference in either the mean clutch size of mature ova (t = 1.13, df = 26, p = 0.112) or clutch size variance (f1, 27 = 1.64, p = 0.211) between the two populations, but average ovum diameter was in the thames (t =  13.12, df = 888, p <

growth curves estimated for (black square, solid line) and little muskingum river (black circles, dot- ted line) eastern sand darter populations. curves differ signiﬁ- cantly (p < 0.001). the lower thames river population dynamics. overall, however, there was no persuasive evidence to suggest signiﬁcant variation in biological traits between these populations. eastern sand darter in the thames grow quickly, with 0+ individuals reaching lengths in the range of 50 mm by the end of the ﬁrst growing season (spreit- zer 1979; drake et al. 2008). faster growth produces a large overlap in size-at-age, making the distinction between mature and immature individuals on the basis of length almost impossible by late august. age-0+ individuals also make up the largest part of the catch, particularly after july when gear selectivity biases are reduced. the numerical importance of 0+ individuals in the population suggests that eastern sand darter populations will be responsive to environ- mental variation favouring the species, but will be prone to rapid abundance declines should nonoptimal conditions be encountered. this population response has been documented in other ﬁshes, such as paciﬁc sardine (sardinops sagox), paciﬁc herring (clupea pallasii pallasii), bay anchovy (achoa mitchilli), atlantic silverside (menidia menidia), and is often associated with short-lived, opportunistic strategists and r-selected species (winemiller & rose 1992; king & mcfarlene 2003). given the short life cycle, early maturation, frequent reproduction and rapid lar- val growth of the species, eastern sand darter is prob- ably also best classiﬁed as an opportunistic strategist. eastern sand darter individuals in the thames were aged to 3+ as opposed to individuals in the little muskingum which were aged to a maximum of 2+. this can suggest increased longevity for thames populations and implications for population dynamics and recovery potential as increased age can translate into increased female fecundity (heins et al. 2004). however, the difference in sample size between the populations and the relatively small number of 3+ individuals found in the thames river could also explain the longevity difference suggesting that increased sampling and ageing of eastern sand darter populations is necessary for further quantiﬁcation. signiﬁcantly, the estimated growth rate of thames river ﬁsh exceeded that of little muskingum ﬁsh, 241 finch et al. although eventual asymptotic lengths do not appear to differ. differences in the growth trajectories may relate to the prevailing thermal and turbidity regimes in the two rivers. both rivers can be classiﬁed as warm water sites with summer temperatures exceed- ing 24 °c (stoneman & jones 1996), however, the thames river warms more quickly in spring owing to less reliance on groundwater. given the impor- tance of temperature for increased growth in many ﬁshes (mann et al. 1984; braaten & guy 2002; heibo et al. 2005), higher early-season temperatures in the lower thames river would trigger faster early- season growth assuming that increased temperature- dependant metabolic demands could be met (i.e., sufﬁcient food resources). the high productivity of the thames river with high nutrient and biomass values would allow metabolic demands to be met due to the associated high abundance of invertebrate prey (upper thames river conservation authority 2009). increased growth rates in the lower thames may also be related to relative predator risk. for example, juve- nile estuarine ﬁshes experience increased growth in turbid waters due to decreased predation pressure from visual predators (blaber & blaber 1980). high turbidity in the lower thames (secchi disk = 0.05 m) versus the little muskingum (secchi disk >1 m) may limit the loss of larger, early growth eastern sand dar- ter to predation and affect the computed growth rates because of the relatively greater abundance of larger individuals in the thames. eastern sand darter spawning takes place earlier in the lower thames river than previously thought for canadian populations. holm & mandrak (1996) inferred spawning dates of late june to late july through investigation of archived museum specimens. however, daily ageing analysis of 0+ individuals indicate that emergence occurs from early may to late june (fig. 4), with spawning taking place from late april to mid june based on a 5-day incubation per- iod. although spawning has never been observed in the wild, spawning is believed to occur when water temperatures are in the 14.4–24.4 °c range, with 20.5–23 °c being ideal (spreitzer 1979; johnston 1989; holm & mandrak 1996; facey 1998). informa- tion from temperature loggers placed in the river showed that temperatures reached the lower end of the required range in april in 2006 (c. chu, personal communication, nature conservancy of canada). early spring spawning may be facilitated by multiple clutches that allow lower thames river ﬁsh to exploit favourable thermal conditions. such an oppor- tunistic strategy can maximise population growth and is used by other darters including, etheostoma microperca and etheostoma caeruleum (johnson & hatch 1991; winemiller & rose 1992; fuller 1998; vila-gispert et al. 2002). 242 whether the earlier spawning is typical of the spe- cies or exclusive to this population cannot be deter- mined from studies of short duration, and the possibility remains that the inferred spawning dates in 2006 were driven by abnormally warm water con- ditions in that year (environment canada 2012). decreased water levels in 2006 caused increased river water temperatures, especially in the shallow areas targeted during sampling. in contrast, the museum specimens used in the study by holm & mandrak (1996) were collected in june and july from various locations in southwestern ontario having lower recorded water temperatures (<21 °c) than those that prevailed in the lower thames river in 2006. first age-at-maturity was estimated at 1+ for males in both populations (spreitzer 1979). given that the mature 1+ ﬁsh in the lower thames river were caught in june and july, the short incubation period and the documented june emergence dates, there is solid evi- dence to suggest spawning by 1+ females in the lower thames river. while mature 1+ females were found in the little muskingum, time series sampling and laboratory examination of gonads determined that these ﬁsh did not spawn possibly due to late summer water temperatures exceeding the spawning threshold of 25 °c. results from the little muskingum contrast with those reported for salt creek, ohio, where spawning was documented for 1+ females (spreitzer 1979). warmer temperatures and faster ﬁrst-year growth in the lower thames may facilitate earlier mat- uration, providing a longer period for gonadal devel- opment while temperatures remain below 25 °c, potentially allowing individuals the time to spawn two clutches. comparisons of mean clutch size estimates among populations suggest that the characteristic does not vary geographically, being approximately the same for the studied lower thames, little muskingum and salt creek (spreitzer 1979) populations. the lack of variation contrasts with ﬁndings for other darter spe- cies where clutch size has been shown to vary geo- graphically (guill & heins 1996; heins 2001; heins et al. 2004), probably as a result of differences in food availability, environment and genetics (bagenal 1971; heins 2001). female size is also usually corre- lated with clutch size for other darter species, includ- ing other ammocrypta (heins 1985; heins et al. 2004), but there was no apparent association in any of the studied eastern sand darter populations for which data were available (spreitzer 1979). low var- iability among individuals and small sample sizes, however, may have hampered abilities to establish meaningful statistical relationships for eastern sand darter compared with other non at-risk-species. observed differences in mean ova size might be an artifact of different sampling methodologies including differences in preservation techniques (gilson’s ﬂuid vs. formalin/alcohol) and the associated egg shrink- age as well as differences in collection (incidental mortalities vs. targeted sampling; heins & machado 1993; lowerre–barbieri & barbieri 1993). given that the gonadosomatic index is similar for both popula- tions, smaller egg size for the lower thames popula- tion may reﬂect the presence of a trade-off for egg number. furthermore, while mean clutch size also did not differ between populations; earlier spawning may allow lower thames eastern sand darter to have a larger number of clutches than little muskingum populations. differences in egg size and number of clutches among ﬁsh populations have been suggested to represent local adaptations that can vary seasonally and annually with environmental conditions (fleming & gross 1990; quinn et al. 1995; heins et al. 2004). for example, an extended reproductive period as a result of multiple clutches has been found to increase successful in hydrologically ‘ﬂashy’ systems such as the thames river (becker et al. 2008). recruitment relatively few detailed biological studies have been completed on eastern sand darter populations. until now insufﬁcient detail on populations from across the distributional range has been available for comparative population analyses or determina- tion of how environment and genetics might act alone, or in concert, to affect population traits. data gathered as part of this study has allowed some of the ﬁrst geographical comparisons to be made and suggests limited variation among populations. dif- ferences in egg size and early growth rates among populations suggest possible trade-offs between egg size, maturation, number of clutches and growth rate, reﬂective of adaption to local environmental conditions. however, detailed data are still lacking for the development of a comprehensive understand- ing of the mechanisms that might give rise to trait differences among eastern sand darter populations. it appears that populations are more signiﬁcantly affected by localised differences in environment, such as turbidity, food availability, differences. the than result has implications for the management of other ﬁsh species at risk in canada, when considering variation of key biological traits (e.g., maximal size, age, fecundity). thus, detailed life-history studies probably remain the best way of examining the implications of trait variation for ﬁsh species at risk and developing the information base necessary to wisely and appropriately manage the remaining pop- ulations. the challenge ahead then becomes devel- oping ways in which to optimise data collection, without unduly impacting the populations that need to be protected. temperature and potential geographical
