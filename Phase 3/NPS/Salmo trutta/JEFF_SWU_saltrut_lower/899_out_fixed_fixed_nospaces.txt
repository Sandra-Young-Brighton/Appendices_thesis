their preferred prey are generally pollution- tolerant taxa commonly found in degraded streams. having a large level of dietary plasticity coupled with preferring prey that are often associated with de- graded systems likely facilitates to the spread of one of the most widely distributed freshwater invasive fish. k e y w o r d s agriculture, diet plasticity, gambusia affinis, invasive species 1 |  introduction the dietary breadth of invasive species can influence their success, with a wide dietary niche often facilitating the spread and survival of invaders under a variety of resource scenarios (crowder & snyder, 2010). for example, high dietary plasticity in largemouth bass is as- sociated with their successful invasion of european rivers (almeida, almodóvar, nicola, elvira, & grossman, 2012). furthermore, anthropogenic habitat degradation may facilitate the spread of in- vasive species (didham, tylianakis, gemmell, rand, & ewers, 2007). for example, the degradation of streams caused by agricultural land use is associated with the spread of the invasive fish gambusia affinis in northern new zealand (lee, simon, & perry, 2017). the ability of an invader to use a wide variety of resources, coupled with the phys- iochemical and habitat alterations associated with anthropogenic degradation, may facilitate invasive species spread (rehage, barnett, 822  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:822–833. © 2018 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd& sih, 2005). improving our understanding of the trophic role that invasive species have in degraded rivers and streams is critical to determining the impact they have in what are increasingly ubiqui- tous systems. globally, agricultural land use has been responsible for the deg- radation of rivers and streams (foley et al., 2005). increasing agricul- tural land use (area and intensity) frequently results in alterations to physiochemical and habitat conditions in streams and rivers, which in turn affects the composition of both vertebrate and invertebrate communities (allan, 2004a). for example, increasing nutrient, sed- iment and light inputs can increase primary productivity (allan, 2004b) and shift animal communities from pollution- sensitive taxa towards pollution- tolerant taxa (hall, closs, & riley, 2001). in de- graded streams, community composition may shift but overall pro- ductivity often increases, resulting in resource- rich systems that are not particularly suited to some of the original inhabitants but that provide opportunities for potential invaders (früh, stoll, & haase, 2012). the western mosquitofish (g. affinis), along with gambusia hol- brooki, is one of the most widely distributed invasive freshwater fish. native to the south- eastern united states of america, g. affinis are now found on every continent except antarctica (pyke, 2008) and are often associated with degraded waterways (lee et al., 2017). its global spread has been via intentional introductions; g. affinis are presumed to feed largely on mosquito larvae and pupae; hence, they have been introduced into water bodies throughout the world in efforts to control mosquitoes and the diseases they carry (lloyd, 1986; pyke, 2005). while g. affinis do prey on mosquitos they are not specialist predators and have a broad diet. g. affinis are om- nivorous, feeding on a wide variety of food types including detri- tus, algae, macrophytes, fish and amphibians, although their diet is frequently dominated by invertebrates (pyke, 2005). for example, in invaded systems, g. affinis competes with and predates on na- tive fish (barrier & hicks, 1994; henkanaththegedara & stockwell,     |  823 2014), amphibians (segev, mangel, & blaustein, 2009; shulse & semlitsch, 2014) and invertebrates (crivelli & boy, 1987; mansfield & mcardle, 1998). much of the research focusing on the diet of g. affinis comes from lake (mansfield & mcardle, 1998) or canal (crivelli & boy, 1987) populations, or experimental analyses (dionne, 1985; rehage et al., 2005). little previous research has considered the diet of stream populations, and to our knowledge, none has explicitly considered the diet of g. affinis in degraded streams. we aim to address two questions relating to the trophic ecology of g. affinis in degraded streams: (i) do g. affinis exhibit selective feeding behaviour and, if so, how does it change as prey availability changes? and (ii) do we ob- serve an ontogenetic shift in diet given gambusia spp. are gape size limited? to address, these two questions we examined the diet of g. affinis at eleven sites in catchments dominated by agricultural land use, in the north island of new zealand. we quantified the impacts of agricultural land use on streams using the macroinvertebrate community index (mci), a metric commonly used in new zealand to measure water quality based on invertebrate community compo- sition and known taxa pollution sensitivity (maxted & stark, 2007). prey selectivity and ontogenetic diet shift were determined using a combination of gut content analysis (gca) and stable isotope anal- ysis (sia). 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area we sampled eleven streams in the north island of new zealand (figure 1) that varied in extent agricultural land use. the sites were low elevation (less than 58 m above mean sea level), coastal (1.3 – 16.6 km from the sea), slow- flowing streams, which ran through catchments with medium to high levels of agricultural land use (46% - 95% of total catchment area, dominated by low intensity dairy n (b) (a) b 0 120 240 360 km f i g u r e 1 study sites were situated in the south auckland region of the north island of new zealand (a), specific site locations are shown in (b), sites f01, f04 and f13 were used for the stable isotope analysis 0 1 2 3 km lee et al.824  |     farming and lifestyle blocks). the areal percentage of agricultural land use in each catchment was calculated in arcmap 10.1 using river environment classification (rec) first- to fifth- order catch- ment polygons (snelder, biggs, & weatherhead, 2010) and land- cover data from the land cover database (lcdb v4.0, terralink international, wellington, new zealand), which has a spatial reso- lution of 1 ha. catchment size ranged from 45 to 4,218 ha, and streams ranged from 1st to 4th order but most were 2nd or 3rd order. sampling was carried out during low flow conditions in late summer (february 2015), which is when g. affinis populations are at their highest in new zealand. 2.2 | field sampling we measured local physiochemical and habitat variables associated with agricultural land use including water temperature (ysi ec300, yellow springs, oh, usa), dissolved oxygen (ysi odo 200, yellow springs, oh, usa), soluble reactive phosphorus (srp), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (din), velocity (marsh- mcbirney, flo mate, frederick, md, u.s.a.), proportion streambed silt cover, macrophyte cover and riparian vegetation cover. site codes range from f01 to f18 (figure 1) but are noncontinuous, this is due to the sites in this study being a subset of a larger set of sites used in lee et al. (2017), which provides further details of physiochemical measurement methods and site characteristics. site f08 had been sprayed with herbicide prior to sampling resulting in a die- off of much of the mac- rophytes present in the stream, which likely contributed to the low taxa richness observed there; thus, it was excluded from the glm analysis. we caught 400 fish across the eleven sites (min 19, max 56). at each of the eleven sites, all potential habitat types were sampled along a 50 m reach using a dip net (40 cm diameter, 2 mm mesh). some small juvenile fish may have passed through our net so our data may under- represent the smallest size classes. all fish were immediately euthanised, transported on ice and frozen in the lab- oratory within 8 hr to await analysis. a subset of three sites (f01, f04 and f13) were used for stable isotope analysis; these sites were chosen to cover a broad geographic range and are representative of typical conditions across sites. invertebrate communities were sampled following standard protocols for wadeable streams in new zealand (stark, boothroyd, harding, maxted, & scarsbrook, 2001). for hard- bottomed sites, a kicknet (0.5 mm mesh) was held on the streambed while a 0.2- m2 area immediately up- current was vigorously agitated by foot, dislodging invertebrates into the net. this process was repeated five times, covering all major habitat types (pool, riffle run, etc.) along the sample reach. at soft- bottomed sites, a triangle kicknet was used to vigorously agitate stream banks and macrophyte beds to dislodge invertebrates, and the net was then passed three times through the disturbed water over a distance of 1 m, which equated to a sample area of 0.3 m2. woody debris was held over the net and rinsed while being gently scrubbed by hand to dislodge inver- tebrates. this process was repeated ten times along the reach; net contents (invertebrates, stones, macrophytes, etc.) were pooled at each site and stored in 70% ethanol. in the laboratory, inver- tebrates were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic unit (typically genus for insects, following winterbourn, gregson, and dolphin (2006), and oligochaetes were identified by the presence of chaetas) and counted to yield relative abundances of each taxon in each sample. 2.3 | diet analysis to measure diet variability, gca was carried out. gca provides a short- term (hours to days) dietary ‘snapshot’ of recently ingested items (hyslop, 1980). gca can be biased towards food items that are slower to break down (e.g., mollusc shells), identification of prey items can be difficult, and presence in the gut does not guarantee assimilation (davis, blanchette, pusey, jardine, & pearson, 2012). given these limitations, we complemented gca with sia using δ13c and δ15n isotopes, which provide time- integrated information on feeding behaviour (abrantes, barnett, & bouillon, 2014). δ13c com- position in organisms generally changes little as it moves through the food web (post, 2002). therefore, δ13c can be used as an indicator of different ultimate basal resource pools supporting higher consum- ers (post, 2002), whereas δ15n generally enriches at a rate of 3% – 4% per trophic level and can, therefore, be used to estimate relative trophic position (post, 2002). gca and sia provide information on different aspects of an organism’s feeding ecology; by conducting both in tandem, some of the limitations of each can be overcome (post et al., 2007). fish were measured (standard length, to the nearest 0.1 mm), weighed (to the nearest 0.1 mg) and dissected. the entire gut was removed and preserved in 70% ethanol, and the remainder of the fish was processed for sia. it was not possible to isolate sufficient muscle tissue for sia from the smallest g. affinis (6.9 mm sl), so whole individuals (minus the gut) were used for all samples. fish were dried in an oven for 24 - 48 hr until a constant weight was reached, then ground into a powder and packaged in tin capsules. samples were analysed for 13c:12c and 15n:14n ratios on a pdz europa anca- gsl elemental analyser interfaced to a pdz europa 20- 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (sercon ltd., cheshire, uk) at the uc davis stable isotope facility. all ratios were expressed as δ units (‰) relative to standards (pee- dee belemnite for 13c and air for 15n). samples had an accuracy of ±0.09 ‰ for both δ13c and δ15n. gut contents of individual fish were spread out on a petri dish marked with 1- mm square grids and examined under a dissecting microscope. prey were identified to the finest taxonomic resolution possible. for each food item present, the percentage of total volume was estimated visually (baker, buckland, & sheaves, 2014) and area was quantified as the number of 1- mm2 grids occupied after lightly pressing the gut contents under a microscope cover slide to a uni- form depth (brooker, munday, & ainsworth, 2010; hellawell & abel, 1971). this research was conducted under animal ethics protocol 001089 at the university of auckland. lee et al.2.4 | statistical analysis to quantify the ecological impact of agriculture on streams, we cal- culated the mci for each site (equation. 1) (maxted & stark, 2007): mci = ∑i=s i=1 ai s × 20 (1) where s = the total number of taxa in the sample, and ai is the tolerance value for the i- th taxon (see (maxted & stark, 2007) for taxa tolerance scores). higher mci scores indicate better stream conditions at the sampled site. in theory, mci values can range between 0 and 200, but typically they range from 50 to 150. scores greater than 119 represent excellent water quality, 100 – 119 good, 80 – 99 fair, and scores less than 80 indicate probable severe pollution. to assess how the invertebrate community (and hence poten- tial prey) varied across all stream reaches, ordination by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nmds) was carried out on the site- by- species abundance data using the jaccard distance metric. we then used a generalised additive model (gam) to fit a response surface to the ordination space. a smooth two- dimensional function of the sample scores on nmds axes one and two was generated using thin- plate splines and used to model percentage of the catchment under agricultural land use. the response surface was then used to identify any potential degradation gradient associated with changes in invertebrate community composition across stream reaches. to assess whether the extent of agricultural land use explained any of the variation in community richness, invertebrate taxa richness was related directly to percentage catchment agricultural land use using a poisson glm with a log- link. gut contents were summarised for each site and by three size classes (<14 mm, 14 – 25 mm and >25 mm sl) related to stages in the development and sex of g. affinis at our sites. fish less than 14 mm were all juveniles, those 14 – 25 mm were adults (both male and female), and those >25 mm were exclusively large females. for each food item present in the gca, we calculated frequency occur- rence (%f), per cent volume (%v) and the relative importance (ri) (equation. 2). the relative importance index takes into account both how often a food item appeared in stomachs and the percentage volume occupied, thereby reducing possible bias in the individual metrics (chucholl, 2013; windell, 1971): rii = �aii 100� ∑n aii i=1 (2) where rii = the relative importance of food item i and aii = %f × %v for food item i. diet niche breadth was quantified using the standardised levin’s index (equation. 3), which characterises diet based on the number of different prey items eaten and the evenness of their distribution in the diet (wallace, 1981): �� 1 ∑ ̂d2 i � − 1� n − 1 ba = (3)     |  825 ba = the standardised levin’s index, ̂di the proportion of g. af- finis diet that made up of prey i and n = number of prey catego- ries. levin’s standardised niche breadth (ba) ranges from 0 to 1; low values indicate a diet dominated by few prey items (specialist predators), while higher values indicate an increasingly generalist diet (krebs, 1999). prey selectivity was measured using ivlev’s prey selectivity index (equation. 4) for each of the fifteen most common invertebrate prey species (kohler & ney, 1982): ei = ri − pi ri + pi (4) where ei is the dietary selectivity index for prey i, ri is the proportion of the prey i in the predator’s diet, and pi is the proportion of prey i in the environment. values for ei range from −1 to +1 with values near +1 indicating a prey item is selected by the predator in much greater proportion than it is available in the environment. conversely, index values near −1 indicate that the prey is selected much less than its relative abundance in the study area. prey with index values near zero are consumed proportional to their availability in the surrounding envi- ronment (kohler & ney, 1982). diet was not assessed in relation to sex because previous stud- ies of g. affinis diet have attributed observed sex- related differences in diet to body- size variability (pyke, 2005). to assess the level of diet overlap among size classes, the percent similarity index (psi; equation. 5) was calculated (schoener, 1968): psi = 1 − 0.5 ࢣ xi − ri ri  yi 100 (5) where rixi is the ri of prey item i of size class, and riyi is the ri of size class y. the psi ranges from 0% to 100%, with 100% de- noting complete similarity and 0% indicating no similarity of diet between the two groups compared. each of these metrics sum- marises different aspects of g. affinis’s diet, and together, they give a broad diet description (ri index), a summary of diet niche breadth and evenness (levin’s index), a measure of prey selectiv- ity (ivlev’s index) and a measure of dietary overlap across size classes psi. we used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permanova), a permutation- based nonparametric test to assess whether g. affinis diet differed across size classes. permanova was selected over alternatives such as analysis of similarities as it is more robust against unbalanced designs, which we had (anderson & walsh, 2013). we then used indicator species analysis to iden- tify the food items/prey taxa associated with particular g. affinis size classes. indicator species analysis isolates ‘faithful’ taxa, that is taxa (prey) that are consistently present or absent from groups of sites (size classes) and so whose presence or absence has pre- dictive power in regard to site group identification (de cáceres & legendre, 2009). significance was assessed using n = 9,999 permu- tations with the hochberg false discovery rate correction applied to account for multiple testing. finally, stable isotope measures δ13c lee et al.826  |     ta b l e 1 per cent catchment agricultural land use, physiochemical, habitat and water quality mci measures for sample sites. din, dissolved inorganic nitrogen;

e.g., terrestrial insects) and up to eight differ- ent food groups were found in a single stomach. across all sites amorphous material (unidentifiable digested material), detritus and algae appeared in the most stomachs (48.0%, 43.5% and 32.5% of stomachs analysed respectively). amorphous material and detritus were the most important items, whereas algae were less important (ri = 28.4, 17.0 and 7.0 respectively [table 2]). combined, inverte- brates accounted for 66% of stomach content volume and were the lee et al.most important broad food group (combined ri of 46.3). of the in- vertebrates, culicidae, amphipods and copepods accounted for the most volume and had the three highest ri scores. generally, at each site, diet was dominated by two or three food groups, with many other categories making a small contribution (see table s1 for all site by prey ri scores). 30 25 20 15 10 s s e n h c i r a x a t 50 70 60 agriculture (%) 80 90 f i g u r e 3 relationship between invertebrate taxa richness and percentage of catchment in agricultural land use across streams. grey shaded area is the 95% c.i     |  827 levin’s dietary niche breadth index (standardised) ranged from 0.04 to 0.32 and decreased with increasing invertebrate taxa rich- ness (r2 = .64, p = .002, figure 4), strong diet selectivity was apparent when the relative abundance of prey in g. affinis guts was compared to the relative abundance of prey in the environment (table 3). culicidae, copepods, chirono- mids and terrestrial invertebrates were always consumed in greater proportions than expected on the basis of their relative abundance in the environment. ephemeroptera, triclada and rhynchobdellida were never consumed. molluscs were frequently eaten but always at a lower proportion than their relative abundance in the environ- ment would predict. the relative consumption of all other taxa var- ied across sites (table 3). 3.4 | ontogenetic diet variability gambusia affinis diet varied with body length, with macroinver- tebrates and plant matter increasing and microinvertebrates de- creasing in abundance with body size (figure 5). the importance of amorphous material and detritus in the diet of g. affinis was relatively constant across size classes. in the invertebrate prey categories, ta b l e 2 diet summary of all fish analysed via gut content analysis (gca). n is the number of stomachs a given prey item was recorded in, % f is the per cent frequency occurrence, % v is the per cent volume each prey item accounted for in stomachs, and ri is the relative importance of each prey item in the diets of gambusia affinis. a, l, p indicate adult, larva or pupa life stages, respectively, where appropriate category item % f % v for all sampled fish n = 400 amorphous material detritus plant terrestrial macroinvertebrates microinvertebrates other filamentous algae macrophytes pollen diatoms terrestrial inverts (a) culicidae (l/p) amphipoda (a) chironomidae (l) hemiptera (a) misc. inverts (a/l/p) trichoptera (l) ologiochaeta mollusca acari paradixae (l) colembolla odonata (l) copepoda cladocera ostracoda gambusia affinis (body parts) invertebrate eggs 48.0 43.5 32.5 5.0 4.5 7.0 16.0 22.3 19.5 10.3 11.8 11.0 4.8 7.8 5.8 3.5 1.8 1.5 0.5 27.5 12.5 12.0 0.5 8.0 14.6 9.6 5.3 0.8 0.2 1.7 5.5 14.2 11.4 4.0 3.7 3.1 2.5 2.0 1.5 0.7 0.6 0.2 0.2 10.2 3.1 3.2 0.1 1.82 rii 28.4 17.0 7.0 0.2 0.0 0.5 3.5 12.8 9.0 1.7 1.8 1.4 0.5 0.6 0.4 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 11.4 1.6 1.5 0.0 0.6 lee et al.828  |     r2 = .59 p = .005 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 x e d n i s n v e l i ’ 10 15 taxa richness 20 25 f i g u r e 4 gambusia affinis diet niche breadth (as measured by levin’s index) versus invertebrate taxa richness across streams. the hollow point (site f08) is an outlier so was omitted from the regression analysis (see text) the relative importance of copepods decreased as g. affinis size in- creased (mean ri = 25.7, 11.3 and 2.1 across the three size classes, from largest to smallest). the relative importance of cladocera also decreased across size classes; they were completely absent in the large female size class (mean ri = 7.7, 1.4 and 0 across the 3 size classes, from smallest to largest). amphipods were progressively more important with increasing size (mean ri = 3.8, 9.2 and 15.2 across the 3 size classes, from smallest to largest); similar trends were observed for terrestrial invertebrates and culicidae (figure 5). diet similarity was highest when comparing the juvenile (<14 mm) and adult fish (14- 25 mm) (psi = 78.4%) and lowest (psi = 61.8%) com- paring between juveniles and the large female class (>25 mm); thus, diet difference was greatest between the smallest and largest fish. diet difference among size classes was confirmed with a permanova (pseudo- f = 2.314, p = .001). of the food items, macroinvertebrates and plant material (filamentous algae and macrophytes) were associ- ated with the largest size class, oligochaetes associated with the me- dium size class and microinvertebrates and diatoms were associated with juvenile g. affinis (table 4). the indicator species results largely agreed with the changes in ri scores, except indicator species analysis did not highlight terrestrial invertebrates or culicidae as important. 3.5 | stable isotopes at all three sites, g. affinis body length was associated with δ13c. at f01, g. affinis δ13c declined with increasing body length (r2 = .60, p < .001), suggesting a shift across the food web as body length in- creased. however, at f04 and f13, the reverse was true (r2 = .43, p = .003 and r2 = .20, p = .047 respectively) (figure 6). at f01, g. af- finis δ15n increased with increasing body length (r2 = .52, p = .0003) suggesting increasing trophic position with increasing body length (figure 6), but at f04 and f13, no such trend was apparent. 4 |  discussion increasing agricultural land use was associated a shift in invertebrate community composition. this is a commonly observed relationship ta b l e 3 prey selectivity ( ei) of gambusia affinis for invertebrate prey categories at each site. positive numbers indicate consumption was greater than the relative abundance of the given taxa in the environment;

quinn, cooper, davies- colley, rutherford, & williamson, 1997) and suggests that as catchment- level agricultural land use increased prey availability shifted. we found that in degraded streams, g. affinis eat a wide variety of prey, in particular invertebrates, detritus and algae. the diet of individual g. affinis diet was typically dominated by 2- 3 prey taxa, with many other prey found in small quantities. the prey most frequently eaten by g. affinis are all pollution- tolerant taxa in new zealand (stark & maxted, 2007; stark et al., 2001), suggesting that g. affinis are func- tionally well equipped to thrive in degraded systems. there was evidence for an ontogenetic diet shift with juvenile g. affinis prey- ing on microinvertebrates and larger g. affinis preying on macroin- vertebrates. stable isotopes provided limited support for g. affinis increasing in trophic level with ontogeny, but did show g. affinis moving across the food web with increasing body size. environmental (or degradation) gradients may have a strong in- fluence on trophic niche of consumers, as environmental gradients may be associated with an underlying gradient in prey availability (hsu, shaner, chang, ke, & kao, 2014). we found the lowest inverte- brate taxa richness at sites with a high percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use. these sites were associated with higher levin’s index scores, indicating that g. affinis were feeding relatively evenly across prey categories where fewer prey categories were available. conversely, where agricultural land use in the catchment was lower we found increased invertebrate taxa richness, and this was associated with g. affinis having a reduced dietary evenness; at these sites, g. affinis were eating a wide variety of prey taxa, but heavily favouring a few food groups, which may represent readily available high- quality food. optimal foraging theory suggests that animals will forage to maximise their net energy intake (macarthur & pianka, 1966; pyke, 1984). feeding generalisation is associated with balancing the costs and benefits of being able to use a diversity of resources (futuyma & moreno, 2002). for example, specialising in high- quality resources is beneficial when the resource is abundant, but can be costly in times of resource scarcity (yeager, layman, & lee et al.830  |     f01 −27 (a) r2 = .60 p < .001 −28 −29 −30 −31 f04 −29 (c) ) ‰ ( c 3 1 ∂ −30 −31 −32 f13 (e) −31 −33 −35 −37 10 15 20 25 (b) (d) (f) 14.0 13.5 13.0 12.5 14.5 14.0 13.5 13.0 17 16 15 14 13 12 ) ‰ ( n 5 1 ∂ r2 = .43 p = .003 r2 = .20 p = .047 r2 = .52 p = .0003 20 25 30 35 40 35 30 gambusia standard length (mm) 40 10 15 f i g u r e 6 relationship between gambusia affinis body length and δ13c (a,c,e) and δ15n (b,d,f) for each of the three sites sampled for isotope analysis hammerschlag- peyer, 2014). on the other hand, an ability to con- sume a variety of lower- quality resources when competition for resources is intense, or when high- quality resources are limited in availability, may allow fitness to be maintained through time and space as resource availability fluctuates (yeager et al., 2014). we ob- served g. affinis predating heavily on a small number of taxa where available (e.g. culicidae, amphipods), but where these prey were ab- sent individual g. affinis fed on a variety of food categories, showing an ability to switch between specialisation and generalisation de- pending on resource availability. at the individual level, g. affinis often showed considerable di- etary variation. this variation could be evidence of individual niche specialisation caused by differences in physiological and morpho- logical adaptive plasticity (rosenblatt et al., 2015). individual- level diet adaptation may be particularly apparent at sites where easy to catch, abundant prey are absent and individual fish have differential success rates at catching a variety of elusive prey taxa (rosenblatt et al., 2015). gambusia affinis clearly shifted their diets with increasing body length. smaller g. affinis generally consumed more small inverte- brates (e.g., copepods and cladocera), and as they grew larger, their diet switched to larger invertebrate taxa (e.g., culicidae, ter- restrial invertebrates such as arachnids). this shift is likely driven by multiple factors. juvenile gambusia spp. are gape limited, which restricts the range of prey available to them, whereas larger in- dividuals, with increased gape size, can consume larger prey and therefore a greater diversity of prey overall (werner & gilliam, 1984; woodward & hildrew, 2002). the variability in diet with body size also appears to represent a change in feeding behaviour as well as prey preference. the diet of small g. affinis was domi- nated by cladocera and copepods, taxa that are generally pelagic (although some copepods are benthic), indicating small g. affinis often feed in the water column. conversely, the diet of larger g. af- finis contained few pelagic prey taxa. the diet of large g. affinis was dominated by culicidae, amphipods, terrestrial invertebrates and ostracods. culicidae are found near the top of the water col- umn, terrestrial invertebrates on the water surface and amphipods and ostracods among detritus on the stream bed. large g. affinis likely split their time between feeding at the top and bottom of the water column, whereas juvenile g. affinis are mainly present in the middle of the water column. behavioural differences between adult and juvenile g. affinis may be directly related to accessing preferred prey; alternatively, they may be associated with preda- tor avoidance. for example, adult g. affinis often prey on juveniles (smith & sargent, 2006) and avian predators positively select for larger g. affinis (britton & moser, 1982). isotope results supported the gca results: g. affinis diet is highly variable and changes with ontogeny. δ13c was associated with g. affi- nis body size, which supports the evidence from the gca that g. affin- is’s diet changes with growth. if there is a shifting reliance on resource pools with growth it suggests that as g. affinis increase in size they may play an important role in assimilating different resource pools into lee et al.stream ecosystems (e.g., from allochthonous to autochthonous). the stable isotope results suggest that as g. affinis grow they move across the food web, rather than simply shifting up the food chain. there may be some vertical movement in the food web associated with g. affinis growth but we did not find a coherent trend across multiple sites in support of this. while this studied has provided a first look into the trophic ecol- ogy of a highly invasive species in degraded streams, there are a few important limitations that need to be considered. first, we have not considered the role of intraspecific competition, g. affinis are capable of reaching high densities, large females are known to eat juveniles and smaller males (dionne, 1985); therefore, individual behaviour likely varies with densities, which, in turn, may affect feeding be- haviours. furthermore, we did not consider the impacts of interspe- cific competition, although no other fish species were observed we did not sample the wider ichthyofauna. based on records from the new zealand freshwater fish database (https://nzffdms.niwa.co.nz), it is possible anguilla spp. and galaxias spp. may have been present at our sites. anguilla spp. could potentially compete with and prey on g. af- finis, while galaxias spp. may compete with g. affinis (rowe, smith, & baker, 2007). again, the presence of predators and interspecific com- petitors has the potential to alter the feeding behaviour of g. affinis. second, we acknowledge that our results are based on a single snap- shot sampling event. the prey that is available to g. affinis, their pop- ulation densities and the presence of competitors will vary seasonally and so the feeding ecology of g. affinis will also vary seasonally. we chose to carry out our study in late summer when g. affinis are at their highest densities in new zealand; our findings are representative of their feeding behaviour in degraded streams at this time of year only. finally, we chose to define the streams as impacted based on mci scores, which are determined by the presence/absence of pollution- sensitive macroinvertebrates. changes in mci scores are a response to, not a direct measure of agricultural degradation; therefore, we can- not attribute changes in prey availability to any particular driver, rather the observed changes food availability are likely the result of a combi- nation of stressors, which could vary in intensity in other agriculturally dominated streams. 5 |  conclusion this study of the trophic ecology of g. affinis in agricultural streams reveals how a generalist omnivore is able to change its diet to use a wide variety of available resources. the spread of invasive species is generally attributed to either, (i) some characteristic of the species that allows them to expand their distribution (i.e. broad environmental tolerances, generalist diet, high fecundity (marchetti, moyle, & levine, 2004; van kleunen, weber, & fischer, 2010)) or (ii) anthropogenic ac- tivities (e.g. deliberate introductions for economic, recreational and bio- control purposes or unintentional introductions facilitated via the movement of people and products around the globe (banks, paini, bayliss, & hodda, 2015; cucherousset & olden, 2011)). g. affinis have many of the traits associated with successful invaders, and they have     |  831 been spread intentionally by humans, have broad environmental toler- ances and are associated with anthropogenically degraded environ- ments. their high level of dietary plasticity likely further contributes to their ability to thrive in a wide variety of environments and may con- tribute to the success as invasive species across a range of systems. g. affinis’s preferred prey were frequently the same pollution- tolerant taxa that characterise degraded rivers and streams. where agricul- tural land use is spatially extensive preferred prey may be abundant, supporting large g. affinis populations. where preferred prey are not available, g. affinis can eat a wide variety of invertebrate and nonin- vertebrate food categories. this flexibility may allow g. affinis to sus- tain themselves in times of resource shortage. it has been shown that agricultural land use is implicated in the spread of g. affinis (lee et al., 2017), they are also capable of reaching high densities where condi- tions are favourable (pyke, 2008), are aggressive competitors (rehage et al., 2005) and generalist predators. all of these traits suggest that g. affinis may play an important role in regulating food web dynamics in degraded streams. acknowledgements the authors thank freyja stocker, alaine holdom and william jones for assistance in the field. we also thank three anonymous review- ers for their comments that greatly improved the manuscript. this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not- for- profit sectors. orcid finnbar lee http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9219-1486 references abrantes, k. g., barnett, a., & bouillon, s.
