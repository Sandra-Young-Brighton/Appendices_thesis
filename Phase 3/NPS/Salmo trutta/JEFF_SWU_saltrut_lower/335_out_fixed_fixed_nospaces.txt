(brown & chivers 2005). such learning can be mediated via damage-released chemical alarm cues (smith 1992, 1999). these chemical cues have been studied extensively in both invertebrates (rochette et al. 1998; wisenden et al. 1999; wisenden & millard 2001) and vertebrates (chivers & smith 1998; brown 2003). in ﬁsh, chemical alarm cues are typically passively released from the injured skin of prey following a predation event (smith 1992, 1999). their detection by nearby conspeciﬁcs often triggers an increase in innate species-typical antipredator beha- viour (chivers & smith 1998). given the context of their responses they trigger, these chemical cues can facilitate the associa- tion of an originally neutral stimulus (such as a novel predator odour) as a potential predation threat (brown & chivers 2005). recent studies have demon- strated that chemically mediated learned predator recognition leads to increased survival beneﬁts during subsequent predator encounters (mirza & chivers 2000, 2001a; darwish et al. 2005). release and the behavioural although damage-released chemical alarm cues may give valuable information regarding local risk, their function may be limited under acidic conditions. both laboratory (brown et al. 2002; leduc et al. 2003, 2004a) and ﬁeld studies (leduc et al. 2004a, 2006) have shown that the ability to detect and respond to conspeciﬁc and heterospeciﬁc alarm cues is impaired under relatively weak acidic conditions (ph 6.0). likewise, chemosensory-mediated learning from dam- age-released alarm cues may also be hindered under acidic conditions. for example, leduc et al. (2004b) demonstrated in a laboratory experiment that hatchery- reared rainbow trout exposed to the novel odour of a yellow perch (perca ﬂavenscens) paired with conspe- ciﬁc chemical alarm cues at a ph of 7.0 learned to recognise the novel odour as a potential threat. however, when exposed to acidiﬁed alarm cues (to a ph of 6.0), trout failed to recognise the novel odour. laboratory conditions, however, often lack the ecological realism of ﬁeld studies and as such, many researchers have urged for ﬁeld veriﬁcations of laboratory results (magurran et al. 1996; smith 1997, 1999; wisenden et al. 2004; leduc et al. 2006). laboratory conditions may represent a suite of the ecological conditions that individuals face in the wild (magurran et al. 1996). in addition, unlike wild ﬁsh, hatchery-reared ﬁsh used in laboratory experiments likely lack previous experience with predation risks, and may differ in their ability to learn novel predator cues (berejikian 1995; a´ lvarez & nicieza 2003). of particular importance, acidiﬁcation found in natural environments may not be exclusively from a single source (e.g., sulphuric acid). multiple acidiﬁcation sources, anthropogenic may stressful disturbances, unrepresentative of both natural and 386 contribute to the reduction of ambient ph (guerold et al. 2000; dangles et al. 2004) and may translate into different effects on the chemical alarm cues. such potential differences in alarm cue degradation between laboratory and natural conditions may inﬂuence chemosensory learning of a novel stimulus under acidic conditions. for instance, failure to measure a response to chemical alarm cues in natural conditions (leduc et al. 2004a) does not imply that prey individuals are not gaining information about preval- ent predation risks provided by the chemical cues. concentrations of alarm cue that fail to trigger an overt (observable) alarm response may still facilitate the acquisition of information about local predation risks (brown & smith 1996; brown et al. 2001) and such sub-threshold concentrations can still translate into increased survival for conditioned prey ﬁsh (mirza & chivers 2003). consequently, in natural settings, it is unknown if the measured impairment of alarm cues detection found under acidic conditions (leduc et al. 2004a) translates into impaired chemosensory learning of a novel cue, thus imposing an environmental constraint on this learning mechanism. in this experiment, we assessed under fully natural conditions if the ambient acidity had any effects on the ability of wild juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) to acquire the recognition of a novel stimulus (odour) after one paired exposure with conspeciﬁc chemical alarm cues. to investigate this question, we conducted observation trials in two nursery streams of different mean acidity levels (see below) used by wild atlantic salmon. we predicted that if juvenile salmon were able to detect conspeciﬁc chemical alarm cues (even in the absence of an observable response), they would associate a novel lemon essence odour (see below) as an indication of danger. as such, ‘conditioned’ ﬁsh should exhibit typical alarm responses following exposure to the novel odour alone. however, if no chemosensory alarm function is available under acidic conditions (e.g., if the chemical alarm cues are not detectable), we predicted that no learning would occur, as no alarm response would be detectable following exposure to the novel odour. to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst experiment demonstrating in a natural setting, the effects of ambient acidity on the chemosensory learning of a novel stimulus. material and methods study sites we conducted this experiment in northumberland county in new brunswick, canada. in this region, we chose two-third-order tributaries of the little south- west miramichi river (fig. 1) having different mean acidity levels. catamaran brook and devil’s brook are impaired learning in the wild fig. 1. the location of the study streams in new brunswick, canada. the inset map in the top right corner shows the location of the study sites within new brunswick. the arrows correspond to the study sites (each approximately 100 m in length) located along catamaran brook and devil’s brook. table 1. mean value (±standard deviation) of the physical and chemical variables between catamaran brook and devil’s book. catamaran brook devil’s brook ph dissolve oxygen (%) water temp.

(1999) have demonstrated that association of danger can occur with biologically irrelevant stimuli. second, lemon essence is clear, water-soluble and dilutes well in water thus having suitable physical properties for this study. atlantic salmon (mean ± sd on 17 june 2004, we captured 14 young-of-the-year fork juvenile length ¼ 4.58 ± 0.23 cm) from the little southwest miramichi river to be used as skin donors from which the chemical alarm cue was generated. after donor ﬁsh were humanely killed (in accordance to concordia animal care committee protocol ac-2005-brow), we removed a skin ﬁllet from each side of their bodies. we collected a total of 44.9 cm2 of skin that we homogenised in an iced-chilled container ﬁlled with 530 ml of stream water at a ph of 7.07. this ﬁnal concentration is known to elicit an alarm response in salmonids (brown & smith 1998; mirza & chivers 2001b; leduc et al. 2004a). to remove any particulate matter, we ﬁltered the solution through poly-ﬁlter wool ﬁbre. as a control stimulus, we used stream water collected prior to start of each trial (see below). as a novel odour, we used lemon essence (see above) that we diluted into unchlorinated well water (1:43) until only a faint odour was detectable. the resulting novel odour dilution had a ph of 7.14. we prepared 20 ml aliquots of each alarm cue and novel odour and froze them at )20 °c until needed. experimental protocol this experiment was conducted in two phases. in both catamaran brook and devil’s brook, we initially 388 conditioned juvenile salmon with a cocktail of either chemical alarm cues or stream water (for the experi- mental or control stimuli, respectively) paired with the lemon odour. twenty-four hours later, we tested the same (conditioned) ﬁsh with the lemon odour alone to assess if they responded with an alarm response. for both the conditioning and the testing phases, we used individually tagged wild young-of-the-year atlan- tic salmon. using dip nets while snorkelling, we randomly captured salmon in the chosen sections of catamaran brook and devil’s brook. on 8 and 18 august, we captured and tagged 45 individual salmon in catamaran brook (mean ± sd fork length ¼ 4.71 ± 0.38 cm) and 47 in devil’s brook (mean ± sd fork length ¼ 4.78 ± 0.33 cm), respectively. each captured subject was tagged by implanting minute amounts of red, green, pink, orange or blue elastomer pigments in the epidermis (for a fully detailed protocol, see dewey & zigler 1996; steingrimsson & grant 2003). this tagging technique is believed to not signiﬁcantly affect individuals’ behaviour (steingrims- son & grant 2003) and allows for the tracking of known individuals during the course of the study. once tagged, each ﬁsh was released at the location of its capture. phase one: conditioning the conditioning phase took place on 12, 14 and 16 august in catamaran brook and on 20, 22, 24 august in devil’s brook. after a tagged salmon was found while snorkelling in the test sites, the experimenter (a.o.h.c. leduc) positioned himself approximately 1.5 m upstream from the test ﬁsh at an angle of approximately 45° relative to the water current. we used this positioning to reduce the formation of artiﬁcial turbulences that may have interfered with the test ﬁsh. to let the test ﬁsh acclimate to the observer’s presence, we waited a minimum of 2 min before starting a behavioural trial (see below). a trial did not start unless the test subject was behaving ‘normally’ (i.e., that it was feeding and moving). trials were 10 min in length and divided in two 5-min segments corresponding to before and after the injec- tion of the stimulus (pre- and poststimulus injection, respectively). after the ﬁrst 5 min, we injected one of the two stimuli (randomly chosen) paired with the novel lemon odour using two 60-ml syringes attached together designated for the appropriate stimulus and the novel odour. all trials were video-recorded using an underwater camera (sea viewtm, sea view video technology, st. petersburg, fl, usa) positioned approximately 1.5 m from the test ﬁsh. from this distance, detailed behavioural observations could be made with accuracy (leduc et al. 2004a, 2006). in total, 40 and 39 salmon were conditioned in catamaran brook and devil’s brook, respectively. phase two: testing twenty-four hours after salmon subjects were condi- tioned (ranging from 24 to 27 h), we conducted the testing trials (on 13, 15 and 17 august in catamaran brook and on 21, 23 and 25 august in devil’s brook). this was done to assess if the test subjects would show an alarm response after being exposed to the novel odour alone. we used the same protocol as in the conditioning phase with the only exception being that we exposed the conditioned ﬁsh to the novel lemon odour alone (i.e., not paired with either chemical alarm cue or stream water). all conditioned salmon were tested during the testing phase (40 and 39 in catama- ran brook and devil’s brook, respectively). to assess if the environmental conditions in which the salmon subjects were tested had any inﬂuence on their response, we measured several physical and chemical variables after each trial. these variables included depth, current speed, percentage of canopy cover, ph, dissolved oxygen, substrate complexity, percentage of cloud cover and water temperature (table 1). the current speed was recorded from 5 cm below the water surface using a flo-mate velocity meter (marsh mcbirney inc., frederick, md, usa). to measure the ph, dissolved oxygen and water temperature, we used a wtw-p 4 multiline meter (wtw, weilheim, germany), which was calibrated with standard solutions (ph: technical buffers ph 4.01 )1 and 7.01; conductivity: conductivity cells 0.01 molæl kcl; dissolved oxygen: alkaline electrolyte solution) at the start of each day. the substrate complexity was determined by using a 1-m-long ﬂexible metal wire that we moulded to the substrate at the focal location of each test subject (i.e., the location where they received the stimuli). a value was obtained by measuring the linear distance between the ends of the wire after it was moulded to the substrate. as the metal wire had a length of 1 m, a substrate complexity value of one would indicate that the substrate is ﬂat (i.e., no complexity), while a lower number would indicate greater complexity. we averaged these environmental chemical) obtained in the conditioning and testing phases for each test site and compared these values across our two study streams (table 1). (physical values and behavioural measures and statistical analysis to determine if individuals learned to recognise the stimuli as a potential threat, we measured three behavioural parameters typical of an alarm response. we quantiﬁed the number of feeding attempts, the time (in seconds) spent in motion and the time (in seconds) spent motionless on the substrate. we deﬁned a feeding attempt as a change of location of at least impaired learning in the wild half a body length in which a pecking motion occurred (either in the water column or on the substrate). the time in motion was measured when an individual changed its location by at least one body length, whereas the time motionless on the substrate was measured when an individual stayed in contact with the substrate without changing its location. all video- recorded trials were analysed by the same observer on a 14-inch (35 cm) toshibatm ﬂat-screen monitor without prior knowledge of the experimental treatment or stimulus type. for each behavioural measure, we determined the occurrence of an alarm response by calculating changes in behavioural scores between the prestimulus and the poststimulus period (poststimulus minus prestimulus) scores. this gave us a difference score for each measured behavioural parameter. as an indication of an alarm response, we predicted to observe a decrease in feeding attempts and in time spent moving and an increase in time spent motionless on the substrate (chivers & smith 1998; leduc et al. 2004a, 2006). we used a repeated measures manova to test for any overall effect of acidity (neutral vs. acidic) and stimulus type (salmon alarm cues or stream water) on the intensity of the alarm response parameters measured using streams (i.e., acidity) and stimulus type as independent variables. we used the multi- variate approach, as our three behavioural measures are likely highly correlated; for example, a reduction in time moving would decrease frequency of foraging attempts. using repeated measures manova, we compared the overall effect of stimulus type on the intensity of the alarm response during the conditioning and the recognition phases separately for each stream separately. subsequent habitat characteristics between streams were also analysed using an anova. to reduce the probability that our observed responses were not the product of differences associated with the test ﬁsh populations, we compared the baseline (prestimulus) values of each behaviour between the two studied streams. we used spss 11 to conduct the statistical analysis. results the initial repeated measures manova revealed a signiﬁcant overall effect of stimulus type (alarm cues (f3,73 ¼ 12.95, p < 0.001) and vs. stream water) stream (neutral vs. acidic) (f3,73 ¼ 7.01, p < 0.01) on the antipredator response of juvenile salmon. more importantly, however, we found a signiﬁcant inter- action between stream and stimulus types (f3,73 ¼ 10.84, p < 0.01). we found no repeated measures effect (f3,73 ¼ 0.14, p ¼ 0.94) nor any interaction (rm · stimulus, f3,73 ¼ 0.14; rm · stream, f3,73 ¼ 389 leduc et al. 0.51; rm · stimulus · stream, f3,73 ¼ 0.42, p > 0.05 for all). these results suggest the test subjects were responding in either stream in a similar fashion during both the conditioning and recognition trials. that a repeated measures · stimuli taking each stream separately, a repeated measures manova showed that in catamaran brook (neutral stream), the type of stimulus used had a signiﬁcant effect on the alarm response intensity of the test subjects (f3,36 ¼ 24.08, p < 0.01), while no repeated measures effect was found (f3,36 ¼ 0.11, p ¼ 0.59) nor interaction (f3,36 ¼ 0.30, p ¼ 0.68). in devil’s brook (acidic stream), however, a repeated measures manova did not type (f3,35 ¼ 0.57, p ¼ 0.06) nor a repeated measures effect (f3,35 ¼ 0.59, p ¼ 0.63) or a repeated meas- interaction (f3,35 ¼ 0.67, p ¼ 0.18). ures · stimuli that although there was a these results suggest signiﬁcant difference in the stimulus type used in show a signiﬁcant effect of stimulus catamaran brook, no such difference occurred in devil’s brook. during the conditioning phase, we observed that salmon in catamaran brook decreased mean number of feeding attempts and mean time spent moving, while their mean time spent motionless on the substrate increased when exposed to lemon odour paired with the alarm cues compared with lemon odour paired with stream water (fig. 2). this suggests that the alarm cues exposures elicited an increased in salmon’s alarm response. in contrast, in devil’s brook we did not observe such consistent behavioural changes between stimuli. during the testing phase in catamaran brook, we observed similar mean changes in behavioural responses as in the conditioning phase (fig. 2), suggesting that salmon had learn to recognise the lemon odour as a potential predation risk when paired with the alarm cue. in devil’s brook, once again we did not observe any consistent behavioural changes between stimuli suggesting that no learning occurred. fig. 2. mean (±standard deviation) differ- ences (post–pre) in: (a) time in seconds spent on the substrate, (b) number of feed- ing attempts and (c) time in seconds spent in motion for juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) exposed to either alarm cues (dark bars) or stream water (open bars) under (ph 7.0) or acidic (ph 6.0) neutral conditions. 390 to ensure that our results were not due to differences in baseline activity levels between catamaran brook and devil’s brook as well as between stimulus types, we compared baseline activity rates (before the injection of any stimuli) using repeated measures manovas with streams and stimulus types as inde- pendent variables. we found no signiﬁcant difference in overall baseline activity between the two streams studied (f3,98 ¼ 0.82, p ¼ 0.49), types (f3,98 ¼ 1.76, p ¼ 0.16) nor an interaction of streams · stimulus types (f3,98 ¼ 0.31, p ¼ 0.82). stimulus to ensure that the differences in the measured behavioural responses were not the product of differ- ences associated with the environmental conditions in which the experiment was conducted, we performed an analysis of variance (anova) among streams (catamaran brook vs. devil’s brook) for each surveyed variable. with the exceptions of the ambient acidity, no overall signiﬁcant difference in the mean values for the abiotic variables surveyed was found between the two streams (table 1). discussion our data demonstrate that under acidic conditions, the ability of wild juvenile salmon to acquire the recog- nition of a novel odour from chemosensory association with a damage-released chemical alarm cue is impaired (i.e., reduced). in the conditioning phase, the paired alarm cues and lemon odour injections elicited signiﬁcant changes in alarm response under neutral conditions, while no response occurred under acidic conditions. in the testing phase, we found a similar response pattern in which only the individuals initially conditioned with the alarm cues under neutral conditions responded to the novel odour injections. under acidic conditions, the individual behavioural response did not differ between the alarm cues and the stream water control. these results concur with the laboratory results obtained by leduc et al. (2004a,b) and suggest that chemically mediated learned associ- ation of danger is impaired under acidic conditions. this demonstrates a potential environmental constraint on this type of learning mechanism. aside from ambient acidity, it is unlikely that our results can be explained by differences in the environmental conditions, as there was no overall difference amongst the environmental variables sur- veyed across the two streams. although juvenile ﬁsh may be especially vulnerable to ambient acidity, we do not suspect our inability to detect a learned response under acidic conditions to be attributable to a signi- ﬁcant physiological stress affecting the test ﬁsh. the avoidance threshold for atlantic salmon is c. ph 4.5 (gunn & noakes 1986; peterson et al. 1988; a˚ tland 1998). moreover, the baseline scores (before the impaired learning in the wild for the lack of injection of stimuli) for each behavioural modality measured did not signiﬁcantly differ between the studied brooks suggesting that test ﬁsh behaved with the same intensity in the two different streams. alternatively, damage to olfactory receptors may account response. leduc et al. (2004b) have shown that young-of-the-year rainbow trout could be conditioned to learn a novel odour when paired with damage-released chemical alarm cues. this learned response, however, did not occur when the odour was paired with acidiﬁed alarm cues (at ph 6.0). in contrast, acidifying the odour had no effect on the retention of this novel learning as long as the paired alarm cue was not acidiﬁed. this result suggests that under weakly acidic conditions (ph 6.0), the olfactory function of salmonids is not impaired and cannot explain the lack of alarm response. lastly, the alarm cues may be degraded (reduced) below a minimum detection threshold due to ambient acidity (leduc et al. 2003). several authors have shown that concentration of alarm cues below some population speciﬁc threshold fail to elicit an overt antipredator response (brown et al. 2001; mirza & chivers 2003; roh et al. 2004). however, even in the absence of observable alarm responses, chemically mediated acquired recognition of a novel cue may still occur. brown et al. (2001) demonstrated that fathead min- nows could learn to recognise a predator odour when exposed to concentrations of artiﬁcial alarm phero- mone below their behavioural response threshold. such covert responses (not observable during the course of into increased survival. mirza & chivers (2003) condi- tioned juvenile rainbow trout to alarm cues and the novel odour of an unknown predator (northern pike, esox lucius) with concentrations of alarm cue above and below the trout response threshold. trout exposed to concentrations below the observable response threshold were able to evade the predator equally as well as trout exposed to alarm cue concentrations above the observable response threshold. as such, these results suggest that even in the absence of measurable alarm responses, prey may still gain chemosensory information about prevalent predation risks. our current results suggest, however, that the alarm cue is degraded to the point where chemosen- sory learning no longer occurs. this ﬁnding suggests that rely on damage- released chemical alarm cues to gain information about the prevalent predation risks. as such, we argue that acidic conditions impose an environmental con- straint on this type of chemically mediated learning. prey may, however, have access to other sources of chemical information. for example, disturbance- released alarm cues are voluntarily released from prey detecting a predation threat (wisenden et al. 1995; juvenile salmon could not could translate the experiment) 391 leduc et al. bryer et al. 2001). these cues may have a different chemical nature and may not be affected by ambient acidity. more work is required to assess the nature of these disturbance cues and if ambient acidity affects their detection by prey. the observed loss of alarm function may create a signiﬁcant loss in risk assessment abilities for juvenile salmon. under natural conditions, chemically medi- ated learning is known to result in the rapid acquisition of both visual and chemical predator cues (brown et al., 1997; leduc et al. 2006). mirza & chivers (2001a) and darwish et al. (2005) have shown that prey conditioned to recognise novel predator odours exhibit increased survival during staged encounters with live predators. under natural conditions, young- of-the-year atlantic salmon are potential prey for many piscivorous ﬁsh species, including brook charr, slimy sculpin and atlantic salmon parr. these pred- ators may exert signiﬁcant predation pressures on young-of-the-year salmon. in their experiment, hend- erson & letcher (2003) stocked young-of-the-year atlantic salmon into three different brooks. these authors reported that between 4% and 49% of all stocked salmon were successfully preyed upon and predation mainly occurred within the ﬁrst 2 days of stocking. after this initial period, the predation rate on young-of-the-year salmon dramatically decreased. these ﬁndings support the idea that initially pred- ator-naı¨ve individuals are more easily preyed upon and subsequent acquired recognition of these predators confers increased survival. in our study streams, we found several ﬁsh predator species including brook charr, atlantic and slimy sculpin (a.o.h.c. leduc, personal observations). we expect that emergent predator-naı¨ve atlantic salmon fry may learn the identity of their predators from chemically mediated learning and gain survival beneﬁts from this learned response (mirza & chivers 2000, 2001a; darwish et al. 2005). by itself, chemically mediated learned predator recognition should confer signiﬁcant survival advantages to prey having the ability of making ecologically relevant associations between neutral remains unknown if the loss of chemosensory learning docu- mented here translates into increased mortality for prey individuals. (novel) and aversive stimuli. salmon parr it in many areas affected by acid precipitations, the soil buffering capacity has been heavily depleted by several decades of acid precipitations (doka et al. 2003). it is estimated that under the current state of sulphuric emissions and the current acid depositions, several decades may be necessary before normal buffering capacity of soil is replenished (jeffries et al. 2000). apart from acidity, other sources of anthrop- ogenic pollution may interfere with chemical alarm function. for example, pesticides (scholz et al. 2000) 392 and heavy metals (scott et al. 2003; mcpherson et al. 2004) impair the detection of chemical alarm cue. hence, the range of environmental constraints on chemically mediated learning may be greater than expected. given the decline in stocks of salmon (noakes et al. 2000; lackey 2003), understanding the effects of acid pollution as an integrated part may help us formulate better policies towards salmon sustainability. for example, prereleased antipredator training employed as a management tool to improve antipredator skills of ‘naı¨ve’ individuals (brown & laland 2001) may beneﬁt from avoiding stocking during periods of increased stream acidiﬁcation (e.g., after snow and ice meltdown) and as such, may favour increased survival rates of juvenile salmonids. acknowledgements the authors wish
