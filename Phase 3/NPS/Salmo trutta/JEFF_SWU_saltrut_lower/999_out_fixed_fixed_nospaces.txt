abstract – complete macrophyte removal to maintain drainage performance in lowland streams can have a negative effect on resident ﬁsh communities, but few studies have quantiﬁed this impact. moreover, limited research has been carried out exploring alternative approaches for macrophyte removal that minimise the impact on the resident ﬁsh community. the aims of this study were (i) to determine how the current practice of removing almost 100% of available macrophyte cover affects native ﬁsh populations in lowland new zealand streams and (ii) to see whether this impact can be reduced by limiting macrophyte removal to alternating 50-m sections of the waterway. native ﬁsh populations were surveyed before and after experimental macrophyte removal for the following three treatments: (i) complete macrophyte removal, (ii) macrophyte removal from alternating 50-m reaches and (iii) control with no macrophyte removal. radiotelemetry was used to monitor the behavioural response of individual giant kokopu (galaxias argenteus) to the different treatments. the results of this study suggest that current drain management practices reduce cpue of ﬁsh by 60%. although limiting macrophyte removal to alternating 50-m sections did not minimise the community impacts of drain clearing, large giant kokopu did beneﬁt from this strategy. all tagged giant kokopu remained in stream reaches partially cleared of macrophytes, while in completely cleared reaches all individuals were displaced. these results demonstrate the threat current drain management practices pose to new zealand native ﬁsh and highlight the value of trialling alternative methods of macrophyte removal. key words: catchment management; common bully; plant management; aquatic weeds; anthropogenic disturbance; giant kokopu introduction anthropogenic disturbance of streams draining agri- cultural and industrial land has reduced both the abundance and the range of native ﬁsh species glob- ally (maitland 1995). the negative effects of dams and chemical pollution are well documented (e.g., alabaster & lloyd 1982; maitland 1995; santos et al. 2006; zhai et al. 2010), but relatively little is known about the effects of many other human distur- bances on freshwater ecosystems. for effective con- servation management of is essential that anthropogenic threats to native ﬁsh are understood, as they often play key roles in aquatic lotic ecosystems it communities (maitland 1995). thus, changes in ﬁsh abundance can have a disproportionately large effect on community structure (maitland 1995). a little understood source of disturbance in low- altitude rivers draining pastoral land is the regular removal of aquatic macrophytes (swales 1982; young et al. 2004). for successful drainage of agri- cultural run-off, streams must remove water from the pasture quickly and efﬁciently while promoting phys- ical and chemical conditions in the soil that are favourable for agricultural production (hudson & harding 2004). accelerated macrophyte growth asso- ciated with increased nutrient input can limit drainage outfall (armitage et al. 1994; kaenel et al. 1998). correspondence: m. j. c. greer,

sediment deposition, reduce ﬂows and potentially ﬂood the sur- rounding pastoral land (kaenel & uehlinger 1988; hearne & armitage 1993). to prevent this, it is nec- essary to regularly clear macrophytes from the streams that drain agricultural land, using herbicides, mechanical or manual extraction of plant material and, occasionally, plant-eating ﬁsh (pieterse & mur- phy 1990; wells et al. 2003; hudson & harding 2004). although macrophytes limit the drainage efﬁciency of pastoral land, they play a key role in maintaining desirable physical and chemical conditions in fresh- water systems (fox 1992). it is therefore likely that the absence of macrophytes following drain clearing reduces the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. in addition, the physical process of removing macro- phytes can be a source of disturbance in itself. herbi- cides may adversely affect non-target organisms and alter the chemical properties of the water column via the decay of aquatic plant material (murphy & barrett 1990). mechanical excavation is the most disruptive method of macrophyte control and can result in the immediate loss of a high proportion of the available plant cover (kaenel & uehlinger 1988). this can reduce the heterogeneity of the stream bed, thereby limiting the number of species it can support (hicks & reeves 1994). despite a widespread understanding that macrophyte removal probably has a detrimental impact on community structure in streams (swales 1982), its impact on freshwater ﬁsh populations has been the focus of relatively few stud- ies. the limited research, however, has suggested that mechanical reduces growth rates and increases the predation of juvenile ﬁsh (mortensen 1977; garner et al. 1996), leads to the removal of ﬁsh during mechanical clearing (daw- son et al. 1991; serafy et al. 1994), and alters the behavioural patterns of many freshwater ﬁsh species (swales 1982). removal of macrophyte cover conﬂicting results. goldsmith to date, research on the effects of drain manage- ment on new zealand’s native ﬁsh populations has produced (2000) reported that there is anecdotal evidence that macro- phyte removal increases the abundance of some ﬁsh species like inanga (galaxias maculatus) and smelt (retropinna spp.), but leads to decreases in the abun- dance of other species like common bully (gobio- (anguilla spp.). morphus unfortunately, this information is not available in the primary literature, and these unpublished ﬁndings have since been questioned because of a lack of ana- lytical power (young et al. 2004). as a result of the limited research on this topic, it is unclear how the widespread removal of frequently abundant macro- phyte species like oxygen weed (egeria spp.), cotidianus) and eels impacts of macrophyte removal starwort (callitriche sp.), swamp willowweed (polyg- onum sp.) and pondweed (potamogeton spp.) affects new zealand’s native ﬁsh (hudson & harding 2004). one species of ﬁsh that may be particularly suscep- tible to macrophyte removal is the drift-feeding giant kokopu (galaxias argenteus). macrophyte removal not only reduces the availability of diurnal cover for this ﬁsh, but also results in the removal of a large quantity of invertebrate prey from the water column (hudson & harding 2004). therefore, we expect reduced food availability to increase the size of giant kokopu home ranges, increase levels of aggression and alter diel activity patterns (david & closs 2003; hansen & closs 2005, 2009). understanding how macrophyte removal impacts this species is particu- larly crucial given its ‘declining’ status (allibone et al. 2010). the present study aimed to examine the commu- nity level impacts of mechanical drain clearing on native ﬁshes and the possibility of minimising these effects with an alternative macrophyte clearing approach. speciﬁcally, we aimed to quantify the impacts of complete drain clearing on native ﬁsh communities and contrast these changes with those from areas where macrophyte removal was limited to alternating 50-m sections. we predict that ﬁsh abun- dance will be reduced by macrophyte clearing and that community composition will change. we also predict that these changes will be less severe when macrophyte removal is limited to alternating sections and that large giant kokopu will be less likely to be displaced from streams cleared in this manner. study area the catchment waituna lagoon is a largely unmodiﬁed coastal lake located approximately 40 km south-east of inver- cargill in the south island of new zealand (fig. 1). the lagoon’s catchment consists of about 20,000 hectares of farmland, native forest and the interna- tionally important awarua wetlands. drainage input for is provided by three major streams that ﬂow directly into the lagoon. of these streams, the waituna creek drains the largest area (12,500 ha), followed by carrans creek (5700 ha) and moffat creek (1700 ha). the majority of water- ways in the region are extensively modiﬁed as a result of and regular mechanical excavation is needed to maintain ade- quate drainage of the surrounding low-lying pasto- ral regular macrophyte removal, the ﬁsh community in the area is relatively diverse, and the catchment has a large population of the declining giant kokopu (riddell et al. 1988; thompson & ryder 2002; allibone et al. 2010). agricultural development, et al. 1988). despite land (riddell 511 greer et al. fig. 1. study sites located in the reaches and tributaries of armstrong creek, smit creek, moffat creek and carrans creek in the catch- ment of waituna lagoon in the south island of new zealand. methods study sites and treatments the impacts of macrophyte removal were examined in twenty-three 350-m treatment reaches located across four streams (armstrong creek, carrans creek, smit creek and moffat creek). eight 350-m reaches were available along moffat creek, while ﬁve reaches were available in each of the remaining three streams. these 23 reaches were then randomly allocated to one of the following three treatments: (i) complete macro- phyte removal (cleared), (ii) macrophyte removal from alternating 50-m reaches – leaving half of the overall habitat intact (staggered) and (iii) no macrophyte removal (control) (fig.2). all of these reaches had >50% macrophyte coverage and were all separated by at least 50 m of undisturbed waterway. this resulted in seven replicates of the cleared treatment (three in moffat creek, two in armstrong creek, one in smit creek and one in carrans creek), eight replicates of the staggered treatment (three in moffat creek, two in armstrong creek, two in smit creek and one in car- rans creeks) and eight control replicates (two in mof- fat creek, two in armstrong creek, one in smit creek fig. 2. illustration of the drain clearing treatments employed in this study. section a = macrophyte removal limited to alternating 50-m sections (staggered); section b = all macrophytes left undis- turbed (control); section c = complete removal of all aquatic macrophytes (cleared). 512 and three in carrans creek). unfortunately, the differ- ent number of replicates of each treatment in each stream was unavoidable because of the wishes of vari- ous landowners and local government agencies. experimental drain clearing was carried out between 22nd and 25th of march 2011 using a mechanical excavator. physico-chemical properties and habitat structure to determine the impact of the different drain clear- ing techniques on ﬁsh habitat structure, the physico- chemical characteristics of each treatment reach were analysed twice, once before macrophyte removal (between the 5th and 20th of march 2011) and once after (between the 10th and 25th of april 2011). water temperature and relative conductivity were measured at the most upstream point of each reach using a ysi probe (ysi inc. model 85). eight transects were then placed along the length of the reach at 50-m intervals. at each transect, the per- centage of the stream width covered by key plant groups (macrophytes, bryophytes, mat algae and ﬁla- mentous algae) was estimated and coverage was recorded on a scale of 1–3 (1 = rare, i.e., <20% coverage; 2 = common, i.e., 20–60% coverage; 3 = abundant, i.e., >60% coverage). stream width was then measured at water surface level, and water depth was measured at 0.5-m intervals across the transect. transect data were compiled and used to estimate the maximum depth, mean depth and mean width of each reach as well as the mean abundance scores of key aquatic plant groups. the percentage of the stream width covered by the following substrate types – mud (<1 mm), sand (1–2 mm), ﬁne gravel (3–20 mm), coarse gravel (21–60 mm) and cobble (61–260 mm) – was visually assessed at each transect. a total of 20 particles within each substrate category were collected from four points picked haphazardly along each transect and measured across the intermediate axis, excluding mud and sand that were assumed to be 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. from these values, the mean size of particles belonging to each substrate category was estimated and used in the following formula to calculate overall mean particle size at each transect. mean particle size ¼ pn n¼i þ st  pt ð 100 here, s represents the mean particle size of sub- strate type t, and p represents the percentage of the width of the stream covered by t. substrate size was averaged across the eight transects to calculate a mean value for each treatment reach. fish population surveys the impacts of the different drain clearing methods on ﬁsh abundance and diversity were measured by sur- veying the ﬁsh populations of each study reach twice, once before drain clearing (between the 5th and 20th of march 2011) and once after (between the 10th and 25th of april 2011). treatment reaches were separated into four individual 50-m sampling sites, and the resi- dent ﬁsh populations in each site sampled separately by overnight netting. to avoid catching non-resident ﬁsh, the most downstream 50 m and the most upstream 100 m in each 350-m treatment reach were excluded from sampling. large ﬁsh (>130 mm in length) were captured using two plastic ﬁsh traps per 50-m sampling site. the traps were constructed from cylinders of plastic netting (mesh size, 20 mm) and measured 1.2 9 0.40 m. funnelled vertical entrances constructed from plastic netting allowed ﬁsh to enter the trap from either end, even in water too shallow for the use of conventional fyke nets. the traps were set approximately 20 m apart, positioned parallel to the bank and secured to the stream bed using metal pegs. smaller ﬁsh (<130 mm) were caught using g-minnow traps that measured 420 9 230 mm, had 25-mm entrance apertures and a mesh size of 2 mm (swales 1987). three g-minnows, secured to one another with a length of nylon rope, were set in the centre of each 50-m sampling site and positioned so the long axis ran parallel to the bank. all ﬁsh traps were deployed 1-3 h before dusk, and collection began 1 h after dawn. captured ﬁsh were identiﬁed to the species level and released at the point of capture immediately after examination (except large giant kokopu kept for radio tagging). the abundance of individual species in each 50-m sampling site was recorded in cpue (catch per unit effort), that is, the total number of ﬁsh caught in all nets per hour of ﬁshing (ﬁsh per hour). as impacts of macrophyte removal the catch rates of individual species were low, the cpue data from all species present at a site were pooled to produce a satisfactory estimate of total ﬁsh abundance (swales 1982). radiotelemetry (ats model f1030) were to measure the response of individual giant kokopu to the different drain clearing techniques, radio trans- mitters surgically implanted into the abdominal cavities of 11 large adult giant kokopu (three from armstrong creek, four from moffat creek and four from a small drain- age network in the catchment of carrans creek). four ﬁsh were captured in the ﬁrst sampling period between the 8th and 21st of march, and the remain- ing seven ﬁsh were collected between the 22nd and 25th of march 2011 after being removed from the waterways by the excavator during macrophyte removal. eight ﬁsh were tagged in reaches from the cleared treatment group, two from the staggered and one from the control. the limited numbers of ﬁsh caught from within the stream (i.e., not with the exca- vator) resulted in low numbers of ﬁsh being tagged in staggered and control reaches (table 1). further surveys were carried out to increase the numbers of ﬁsh in the control reaches, but no ﬁsh were caught. radio implants were carried out following the meth- odology of david & closs (2001). brieﬂy, ﬁsh were an-  1) aesthetised with a dilute solution of aqui-s (20 ll·l and placed ventral side up in a ﬁsh-shaped relief cut into a wet sheet of foam rubber. a 10-mm incision was made approximately 15 mm posterior to the base of the pelvic ﬁns and between three and ﬁve mm to the right of the ventral midline. a radio transmitter was inserted into the ﬁsh’s abdominal cavity through this incision. the ﬁsh was kept unconscious during surgery by aerat- ing the gills with a dilute solution of aqui-s  1). the incision was ﬂushed with saline solu- (20 ll·l tion and closed with three interrupted stitches. to reduce the risk of infection and decrease healing time, the wound was also coated with a povidone-iodine topi-

located twice in the 48 h following surgery to ensure the tags were not expelled. as in david & closs (2003), location data were not recorded for a minimum of 2 weeks after tagging to ensure behavio- ural patterns had returned to normal. telemetry data collection commenced on the 13th of may 2011 and ended on the 11th of june 2011. when weather conditions permitted, each ﬁsh was tracked twice every 48 h, once during the day (09.0017.30 h) and once at night (18.30–03.00 h). fish were located using a scanning receiver (falcon ﬁve; wildlife materi- als international inc., carbondale, il, usa) and a hand-held directional three-element yagi antennae. the positions of located ﬁsh were recorded as the distance and direction (either upstream or downstream) of their current location in relation to where they were ﬁrst located and released following tagging. if a ﬁsh was located in a study reach, the treatment group of the reach was recorded. if the reach belonged to the stag- gered treatment group, it was noted whether the ﬁsh was in the cleared or undisturbed areas. retrieval of concealed transmitters prior to data collection indicated that estimated positions were accurate to ± 0.5 m. fish that could not be located within 1500 m of where they had been tagged over 4 days of attempted tracking were considered to have left the study area. additional checks to locate them were then undertaken once each week after this 4-day period. analyses fish catch data collected from the same 50-m sam- pling site were not independent through time (zar 1984); consequently, paired t-tests were used to compare total cpue and changes in the total num- ber of species collected before and after the exper- imental drain clearing for each of the different treatment groups. the same tests were used to 514 common bullies analyse changes in the combined and individual cpue of and giant kokopu. paired t-tests were also used to compare cpue before and after experimental drain clearing in un- cleared and cleared sampling sites in the staggered treatment. to achieve this, it was necessary to treat data from different 50-m sampling sites in the same treatment site as independent. catch data were not normally distributed, and both cpue and species to approximate normality. paired t-tests were also used to compare the physical characteristics of each 350-m reach before and after macrophyte removal in each treatment group. all statistical analyses were carried out using spss statistical software version 20.0.0 (international business machines corporation, armonk, ny, usa). (logx+1) data were log-transformed statistical comparisons of the movement patterns of radio-tagged individuals from the different treat- ment groups were not possible because of small sam- ple sizes and low levels of individual replication. instead, data are presented descriptively as in david & closs (2003). the locations of radio-tagged ﬁsh after drain clearing in relation to where they were originally tagged were used to make inferences about the impacts of the different macrophyte removal tech- niques. the recorded positions of individual ﬁsh in relation to available macrophyte cover were plotted on a drawn-to-scale map of the study sites and used for inferences about habitat use in staggered sites (david & closs 2003), and the potential beneﬁts of this technique for giant kokopu management. results physico-chemical properties and habitat structure after experimental drain clearing, mean water tem- perature decreased from 13.58 °c to 11.25 °c in table 2. physico-chemical parameters measured in cleared, staggered and control sites before and after experimental macrophyte removal. impacts of macrophyte removal parameters  1) temperature (°c) relative conductivity (ls cm mean width (m) mean depth (cm) maximum depth (cm) mean particle size (mm) macrophyte abundance bryophyte abundance mat algae abundance filamentous algae  1) temperature ( °c) relative conductivity (ls cm mean width (m) mean depth (cm) maximum depth (cm) mean particle size (mm) macrophyte abundance bryophyte abundance mat algae abundance filamentous algae  1) temperature ( °c) relative conductivity (ls cm mean width (m) mean depth (cm) maximum depth (cm) mean particle size (mm) macrophyte abundance bryophyte abundance mat algae abundance filamentous algae cleared before mean ± sd 13.58 ± 0.46 193.29 ± 14.70 1.36 ± 0.18 24.25 ± 4.98 32.35 ± 4.36 19.87 ± 10.92 2.43 ± 0.21 1.32 ± 0.25 1.32 ± 0.25 1.32 ± 0.21 staggered before mean ± sd 14.06 ± 0.56 198.67 ± 12.54 1.41 ± 0.10 26.51 ± 3.83 36.92 ± 4.07 17.64 ± 7.07 2.26 ± 0.16 1.15 ± 0.16 1.03 ± 0.03 1.34 ± 0.23 control before mean ± sd 11.72 ± 1.56 208.04 ± 17.12 1.67 ± 0.21 29.40 ± 3.97 38.82 ± 3.51 26.75 ± 13.54 2.71 ± 0.17 1.18 ± 0.10 1.09 ± 0.07 1.06 ± 0.06 after mean ± sd 11.25 ± 0.58 211.74 ± 11.89 3.26 ± 1.51 20.08 ± 3.37 27.54 ± 3.91 11.9 ± 4.81 1.14 ± 0.14 1.14 ± 0.14 1.05 ± 0.03 1.07 ± 0.05 after mean ± sd 11.35 ± 0.51 206.73 ± 10.61 1.60 ± 0.15 26.01 ± 2.05 33.81 ± 2.32 15.91 ± 5.41 1.75 ± 0.09 1.06 ± 0.06 1.03 ± 0.03 1.00 ± 0.00 after mean ± sd 10.98 ± 0.56 212.00 ± 12.03 2.45 ± 0.75 33.95 ± 4.41 43.50 ± 5.39 20.42 ± 7.81 2.25 ± 0.25 1.12 ± 0.08 1.25 ± 0.14 1.00 ± 0.00 t (df = 6) 7.51  1.19 1.84 8.80 8.30 32.08 2.00 0.52 0.81 0.74 t (df = 7) 4.52  0.46  2.09 0.19 1.38 0.52 4.49 1.00 – 1.51 t (df = 7) 0.42  0.15  0.99  0.83  0.78 0.50 3.41 1.52  0.95 1.00 p <0.001* 0.278 0.261 0.07 0.015* 0.449 0.005* 0.253 0.231 0.267 p 0.003* 0.657 0.075 0.850 0.210 0.618 0.003* 0.351 – 0.173 p 0.682 0.881 0.351 0.429 0.461 0.605 0.011* 0.170 0.370 0.351 *represents a signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) in values observed before and after treatment. sites cleared sites, from 14.06 °c to 11.35 °c in stag- gered sites and from 11.72 °c to 10.98 °c in con- trol (table 2). the observed difference in temperature before and after macrophyte removal was statistically signiﬁcant in the cleared and stag- gered treatment groups but not in the control (paired t-tests, cleared t6 = 7.513, p < 0.001;

sites at night (100% of night-time locations) and returned to uncleared sections during the day (100% of daytime locations) (fig. 5b & c). the single ﬁsh tagged in a control site, m176, remained in

that the lack of a signiﬁcant change in giant kokopu abundance after macrophyte removal may be due to low statistical power associated with table 3. cpue of common bully, giant kokopu and both species

removal minimised the impacts on native ﬁsh abundance, our data suggest that uncleared areas act as refuges for large giant kokopu that may be less likely to leave streams cleared in this manner. these ﬁndings support our predictions that the complete clearing of streams negatively impacts freshwater ﬁsh populations and that these impacts can be minimised by limiting macrophyte removal to alternating sec- tions of a waterway. to that practices native ﬁsh the implementation of our ﬁndings are of particular importance as they demonstrate the threat posed by current drain man- agement communities throughout new zealand’s lowland waterways, and suggest the staggered drain clearing strategy in areas where the giant kok- opu are found may prevent further losses of this already-threatened ﬁsh. mechanical removal of mac- rophytes has been shown to lead to short-term decreases in ﬁsh abundance in both north american and british streams (swales 1982; serafy et al. 1994), with limited impact on the species diversity of the resident ﬁsh communities (serafy et al. 1994). it is commonly accepted that mechanical excavation of macrophytes in new zealand streams most likely has a negative inﬂuence on native ﬁsh (hudson & har- ding 2004), but the present study is the ﬁrst to quan- tify this knowledge gap (young et al. 2004). a common problem encountered with past macro- phyte removal studies is the difﬁculty isolating sea- sonal changes in abundance from treatment effects (swales 1982; armitage et al. 1994). in this case, however, cpue did not differ between sampling periods in the undisturbed control reaches despite seasonal decreases in temperature and signiﬁcant reductions in macrophyte cover. this suggests that decreased ﬁsh abundance in cleared and staggered reaches was caused by the physical process of macro- phyte removal, the resulting changes in habitat struc- ture or a combination of both these factors. the total loss of available plant cover is, most likely, a contrib- uting factor in the reductions in ﬁsh abundance seen in the two treatment groups. removing large quanti- ties of aquatic vegetation increases predation of smal- ler ﬁsh (mortensen 1977), reduces cover for adult ﬁsh (swales 1982) and decreases food availability for both predatory and herbivorous ﬁsh (swales 1982; garner et al. 1996). although staggered clearing still led to a signiﬁcant decrease in total ﬁsh abundance, maintaining half of the available plant cover did miti- gate at least some of the impacts of drain clearing. undisturbed macrophyte beds acted as ‘refuges’ for giant kokopu and decreases in ﬁsh abundance were limited to the areas from which all available plant cover had been removed. signiﬁcant reductions in 518 macrophyte coverage, however, had no impact on cpue in the control reaches. subsequently, is likely that changes in ﬁsh abundance in cleared and staggered reaches were inﬂuenced by a number of factors associated with drain clearing other than reduced plant biomass. it disturbance caused by the physical process of macrophyte removal may also be partly responsible for the results observed in this study. mechanical macrophyte removal causes physical and chemical changes in the water column that can negatively impact the resident fauna (brookes 1988; hudson & harding 2004). drain clearing has been reported to temporarily increase sediment suspension (hudson & harding 2004; young et al. 2004), which interferes with normal respiration in ﬁsh by clogging the gills (bruton 1985), and limits the feeding success of predatory species by increasing turbidity and inverte- brate drift (ryan 1991; wood & armitage 1997). although these factors were not measured in the cur- rent study owing to logistical constraints, high levels of suspended sediment were observed during experi- mental drain clearing and it is possible that this led to the short-term decreases in cpue observed in the treated reaches. from the physico-chemical variables examined, only water temperature changed signiﬁ- cantly in both treatment groups, but this was unlikely to explain the observed changes in ﬁsh community. decreases in temperature were probably the result of seasonal changes in climate and were unlikely to be associated with macrophyte removal. temperatures in the treatment groups and the control were relatively similar after drain clearing, and the larger decreases in temperature seen in the cleared and staggered areas were a reﬂection of the relatively low temperatures recorded in the undisturbed reaches prior to macro- phyte removal. determining the physico-chemical drivers behind changes in the ﬁsh community follow- ing drain clearing is vital, and future research in this area is required to further develop drain management strategies. the in species limited change richness we observed following drain clearing may be a reﬂection on the long-term removal history of the study area rather than the effects of short-term macrophyte removal. regular excavation of waterways has been carried out in the waituna catchment since at least the 1960s (johnson & partridge 1998), which may have generated localised ﬁsh communities that are resistant to macrophyte removal in areas that are fre- quently cleared. if so, ﬁsh assemblages in developed waterways, such as those where the current study was carried out, may only consist of species that are at least partially resistant to this form of disturbance (orrego et al. 2009). determining how the distribu- tion of native ﬁsh species relates to current and his- torical drain clearing activities in catchments like the waituna may provide a better understanding of the community level impacts of macrophyte removal. the design of this study did not allow measure- ment of the long-term impacts of drain clearing on the ﬁsh community. the experimentally cleared reaches included in this study were bordered by undisturbed macrophyte beds. recovery time after disturbance has been shown to decrease when undis- turbed areas from which displaced animals can recol- onise are close (niemi et al. 1990; reice et al. 1990). therefore, the ﬁsh populations in our study sites would be expected to recover much more rapidly than they would under real-world conditions where macrophyte removal is typically carried out on a much larger scale (resh et al. 1988). future research focussed on monitoring resident ﬁsh populations fol- lowing routine large-scale drain clearing operations is needed to measure long-term community responses to macrophyte removal accurately. that removal may is no longer possible. although staggered clearing still resulted in sig- niﬁcant reductions in native ﬁsh abundance, we found that this technique may reduce the effects of drain clearing on adult giant kokopu. large giant kokopu are generally nocturnal and seek cover when not active (whitehead et al. 2002; david & closs 2003). the radiotelemetry data collected in this study suggest the response of giant kok- opu to drain clearing is heavily dependent on the availability of macrophytes, and large individuals leave completely cleared areas when diurnal will concealment in contrast, preserve staggered macrophyte enough cover and eliminate the need for large giant kokopu to leave treated waterways. further- more, we found this technique may actually beneﬁt giant kokopu by increasing the availability of desirable nocturnal feeding habitat (david & closs 2003). three individuals tracked in this study reg- ularly moved from the densely vegetated areas in which they sheltered during the day to cleared areas at night. giant kokopu prefer to feed in open habitats (david & closs 2003; hansen & closs 2009), and by creating this habitat through staggered clearing, the numbers and condition of resident ﬁsh may remain unchanged despite reduc- tions in food availability as a result of macrophyte removal (garner et al. 1996). although the idea of leaving undisturbed refuges when clearing macro- phytes from streams has been suggested in the past (swales 1982; armitage et al. 1994; garner et al. 1996; kaenel et al. 1998; aldridge 2000; hudson & harding 2004), the actual beneﬁts of this technique for individual ﬁsh species have not been quantiﬁed until now. further trials should be carried out in other systems, both in new zealand impacts of macrophyte removal and overseas, to determine whether this approach can beneﬁt other threatened ﬁsh species found in regularly cleared lowland streams. acknowledgements funding for
