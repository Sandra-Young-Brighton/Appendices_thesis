while the population may be managed as a single reproductive unit, the phenotypic variation within this population may have ﬁtness consequences and thus merits conservation. k. homel1, p. budy2, m. e. pfrender3, t. a. whitesel4, k. mock5 1department of ecology, montana state university, bozeman, mt, usa, 2usgs, utah cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, department of watershed science, utah state university, logan, ut, usa, 3department of biology, utah state university, logan, ut, usa, 4u.s. fish and wildlife service, columbia river fisheries program ofﬁce, vancouver, wa, usa, 5department of wildland resources, utah state university, logan, ut, usa key words: gene ﬂow;

e-mail: phaedra.budy@usu.edu accepted for publication january 17, 2008 introduction many species exhibit behavioural diversiﬁcation (e.g., multiple behavioural forms in a population or niche specialization) in response to a heterogeneous and changing environment (northcote 1992; lichatowich 1999). one common example of this diversiﬁcation is partial migration, the phenomenon wherein part of the population migrates and part remains resident (jons- son & jonsson 1993). through exploitation of multi- ple habitat types through time, resident and migratory individuals (from a single population) disperse the risk of that population becoming extinct because of local disturbances and gain access to a greater amount of resources (gross 1991; northcote 1992; lichatowich 1999; jackson et al. 2001). while natural selection may be favouring both resident and migratory forms under different environmental scenarios (kaitala et al. 1993), behavioural diversiﬁcation does not necessarily infer genetic differentiation between behavioural forms. rather, both forms could be maintained by a stable polymorphism (abiotic and ⁄ or biotic conditions may be favourable to the maintenance of both forms over time, smith 1970; leimar 2005) or be strictly because of phenotypic plasticity. from a management perspective, a population that contains reproductively isolated forms (representing different behaviours or exploiting different niches) would be managed differ- ently than one containing a single panmictic popula- tion that displays a behavioural polymorphism. for endangered species in particular, the genetic structure within a population (as it relates to behavio- ural forms) may have implications with respect to (1) deﬁnition of species or distinct population segments, (2) monitoring recovery in the target species or populations, (3) assessment of population size, and (4) maintaining connectivity and genetic diversity (us fish and wildlife service, usfws, 2004). by doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00299.x 465 homel et al. determining whether different behavioural forms are genetically distinct, how they interact, and how they exploit and adapt to natural environments, we can better understand how anthropogenic impacts may alter the genetic population structure, expression, or prevalence of different behavioural forms (gross 1991; neraas & spruell 2001; wofford et al. 2005), and select conservation strategies accordingly (dun- ham et al. 1999). because of isolation within the salmonids, there is evidence for several patterns of genetic population structure related to sympatric behavioural forms (osinov 1984; foote et al. 1989; wood & foote 1996; hendry et al. 2000; docker & heath 2003). for example, different mor- phological or behavioural forms may evolve into reproductive exploitation of different niches (arctic char salvelinus_alpinus, skulason et al. 1996; westgaard et al. 2004; but see nordeng 1983), or different spawn times or locations (steelhead and rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss, zimmerman & reeves (2000), sockeye and kokanee o. nerka, foote et al. 1989; taylor et al. 1996; wood & foote 1996). conversely, a population may exhibit behavioural diversiﬁcation, yet comprise a single breeding population (e.g., brook char s. fontinalis, mclaughlin 2001). at a broad spatial scale, is possible that behavioural polymorphism (e.g., migra- tion distance, home range size, and consistency in expressing a single behavioural form over time) may differ between populations (olsson et al. 2006). furthermore, the degree that different behavioural forms interbreed within a population may vary within a single species (e.g., steelhead and rainbow trout, docker & heath 2003; narum et al. 2004; mcphee et al. 2007; lake whiteﬁsh coregonus_clupeaformis, pigeon et al. 2006), with potentially different selection pressures acting on each form (kaitala et al. 1993; mcdowall 2001). it similar to other salmonids, bull trout (salvelinus conﬂuentus) exhibit a spectrum of behavioural and breeding strategies. bull trout are a species of char found in the paciﬁc northwest, and throughout their range they exhibit resident and migratory forms (i.e., adﬂuvial, anadromous, and ﬂuvial) within the same population (rieman & dunham 2000). unlike paciﬁc salmon that demonstrate discrete behavioural forms (e.g., anadromous and adﬂuvial), the difference between bull trout life-history forms is less distinct, particularly for stream-resident and ﬂuvial ﬁsh. adult bull trout commence spawning migrations into tribu- taries in the late summer (mcphail & murray 1979; shepard et al. 1984). both stream-resident and migra- tory bull trout spawn in the fall, and may spawn every year or every other year (rieman & mcintyre 1993). as such, a single breeding population may be comprised of 4+ generations and potentially multiple 466 behavioural forms (rieman & mcintyre 1993). once spawning is complete, ﬂuvial and adﬂuvial bull trout migrate to over-wintering grounds (fraley & shepard 1989) and resident bull trout exhibit limited movement (jakober et al. 1998). eggs develop over the winter and fry emerge from early april through may (shepard et al. 1984). fry are closely associated with the substrate for an extended period of time (mcphail & murray 1979). in the spring, peak ﬂows may ﬂush young-of-year bull trout downstream (downs et al. 2006), but peak ﬁrst-time outmigration of juveniles occurs in august (homel and budy in press). migra- tory juvenile and subadult bull trout inhabit larger more productive rivers or lakes for several years before returning to spawn (shepard et al. 1984; fraley & shepard 1989). while ﬂuvial or adﬂuvial bull trout may exhibit migrations up to 250 km in distance (fraley & shepard 1989; swanberg 1997; baxter 2002), there is no consistent demarcation based on distance moved that distinguishes the movements of migratory ﬁsh from those of resident ﬁsh. further- more, the only known morphological distinction between resident and migratory bull trout is based on body size after several migrations; migratory ﬁsh often attain sizes >600 mm total length (tl) as a result of migrating to larger, more productive streams, while resident ﬁsh typically grow to 300 mm tl (fraley these complicated & shepard 1989). writ behavioural, reproductive, and morphological ele- ments confound the deﬁnition of speciﬁc life-history forms, and the interpretation of the associated genetic structure within bull trout populations. large, typically exhibit the genetic structure of bull trout across their range reﬂects their post-glacial dispersal and subsequent isolation (as a result of habitat fragmentation). bull trout low genetic variation within populations (e.g., out of 65 bull trout populations examined by spruell et al. 2003, 56 have hs < 0.299). however, among population structure is typically quite high (leary et al. 1993; taylor et al. 1999; spruell et al. 1999; kanda & allendorf 2001; spruell et al. 2003; costello et al. 2003; reiss 2003). for example, spruell et al. (2003) reported fst values of 0.635 between two coastal populations of bull trout, and costello et al. (2003) reported an fst of 0.40 for two populations in the kootenay river. throughout their range, bull trout are typically associated with speciﬁc habitat conditions including cold, clean water, and structurally complex habitat (rieman & mcintyre 1993). many factors, such as loss of connectivity, habitat degradation, and introduction of non-natives, have contributed to the range-wide decline of bull trout, particularly of the migratory form (rieman & mcintyre 1993). in response to these threats, bull trout were listed as threatened in the contiguous united states in 1999 (department of the interior, u. s. fish and wildlife service 1999). while genetic structure among many bull trout populations has been assessed for conservation planning (e.g., leary et al. 1993; spruell et al. 2003; whiteley et al. 2006), little is known about whether behavioural variability results in patterns of non-random mating between resident and migratory ﬁsh within a population. in addition, despite the lack of a clear demarcation between the behavio- ural categories of ‘resident’ and ‘migratory’, differ- ences between these life-history forms are important for assessing the effectiveness of actions directed at recovery (e.g., reconnecting migratory corridors); and, in addition to other criteria, recovery objectives require preserving the diversity of behaviours bull trout express (e.g., resident or migratory forms, emigration age; usfws, 2002). in this study, our goal was to evaluate whether variability in behavioural patterns was associated with assortative mating between behavioural forms. char- acterization of this genetic structure is important for determining whether this population should be man- aged as a single panmictic breeding population (that contains behavioural variability), or as distinct popu- lations with genetically distinct behavioural groups. our previous analyses of the movement patterns within this population demonstrated a continuum of movement across space and time, indicating that movement distance and timing alone were insufﬁcient to deﬁne an individuals’ life-history strategy as resident or migratory (homel and budy in press). however, given the broad array of behaviours that a single life-history form may express, it is insufﬁcient to use movement distance and timing alone as metrics bull trout genetic population structure to deﬁne life-history forms. instead, we described behavioural patterns using a functional deﬁnition of migration (i.e., migration is annual directed, purpose- ful movement between distinct habitat types, e.g., dingle 1996), and determined that our population contains both migratory and resident ﬁsh. those ﬁsh exiting the study area were deﬁned as migratory as they are making a directed, distinct shift in habitat types (described in the study area), and many of those ﬁsh ultimately completed multiple spawning migra- tions (further described in the methods). therefore, the speciﬁc objective of this study was to evaluate whether resident and migratory ﬁsh exhibited assortative mating, as demonstrated by genetic differentiation. methods study area the south fork walla walla river (sfww) originates at elevations near 1800 m in the blue mountains of northeast oregon, conﬂuences with the north fork walla walla near the town of milton-freewater, and ﬂows into the columbia river upstream of mcnary dam (fig. 1). we selected this river as our study area for two reasons. first, it was known to contain a relatively large population of bull trout (8–12,000 ﬁsh, al-chokhachy 2006), previously described as con- taining both resident and migratory forms (buchanan et al. 1997). second, the sfww and main-stem walla walla include a range of habitat types from pristine to highly degraded. within the sfww, the habitat condition is generally of high quality, with few forest fig. 1. map of the south fork walla walla river study area with locations of passive antennae and tributaries marked. 467 homel et al. conditions degrade with respect related impacts and limited recreational activity that would impact the stream corridor (particularly in the headwaters, buchanan et al. 1997). downstream of the conﬂuence with the north fork walla walla river, the habitat to increased water temperature, simpliﬁed channel and habitat, impoundments, and irrigation withdrawals that severely deplete ﬂow (buchanan et al. 1997), and act as a seasonal migration barrier. skiphorton creek and reser creek are the major tributaries to the sfww and most observed spawning activity occurs in proximity to (or within) these pristine tributaries. trout within the walla walla basin watershed, the sfww, mill creek, and the touchet river all contain populations of bull (buchanan et al. 1997; fig. 1). according to oregon and washington criteria, population status in mill creek is ‘of special concern’ (buchanan et al. 1997) or alternatively ‘healthy’ (wdfw, 1997), the touchet river status is considered ‘unknown’ (wdfw, 1997), and the sfww popula- tion status is ‘low risk’ (buchanan et al. 1997); all subpopulations are listed as ‘depressed’ by the usfws (usfws 2004). although the sfww bull trout population is of low extinction risk, irrigation withdrawals and diversion dams along the walla walla river prevent interaction (from spring until fall) between sfww bull trout and the bull trout popula- tions from touchet river and mill creek. it is thought that historically bull trout had access to, and used, the columbia river (buchanan et al. 1997), but recent telemetry studies (mahoney 2001, 2002) have not conﬁrmed contemporary use of the columbia river, and pit-tagged ﬁsh from the sfww have not been detected at antenna located in mill creek or the columbia (homel and budy in press). study design phase i: mark-recapture study critical for this genetics study is a component of a broader effort to gather comprehensive population assessment data on the sfww, recovery planning (al-chokhachy et al. 2005; al-chokhachy 2006). for the ﬁrst phase of this broader effort, we conducted a large mark-recapture study in the main-stem of the sfww during july and august from 2002–2005 (al-chokhachy et al. in press). the study area extended from harris park to the conﬂuence with reser creek (a distance of 21 stream km, fig. 1), and was divided into 103 adjacent, 200 meter reaches (harris park is reach 1). each year we systematically sampled every ﬁfth reach (further described in al-chokhachy et al. in press), which entailed: (1) capturing bull trout, (2) implanting passive integrated transponder tags (pit tags) into the ventral cavity of all bull removing a 2–5 mm2 ﬁn clip from the anal ﬁn. we stored ﬁn clips trout >120 mm tl, and (3) 468 in 100% ethanol until they were processed by a laboratory. from 2002–2005, we captured, tagged, and ﬁn-clipped >1300 bull from the main-stem sfww. trout study design phase ii: deﬁning behaviour in the second phase of this study, we used ﬁsh recapture data (from the mark-recapture study), in combination with detection of tagged ﬁsh at stationary antennae, to determine the movement patterns and behavioural strategy of individuals in our population (homel and budy in press). in 2002, we installed two passive pit tag antennae in the sfww (one at harris park, and one at bear creek, fig. 1), to record the individual tag number of marked ﬁsh that passed through the antenna loop. the antenna at harris park was located at a transition point in habitat quality; upstream of harris park, the river exhibits complex braiding, in-stream structure, and temperatures within the thermal tolerance of bull trout. downstream of harris park, a paved road follows the course of the river, the river is simpliﬁed and ⁄ or channelized, and stream temperatures reach or exceed the thermal tolerance of bull trout. conditions progressively deteriorate downstream of the conﬂuence with the north fork walla walla river. given this distinct habitat transition, ﬁsh moving downstream past the harris park antenna would be considered migratory ﬁsh. based on our annual mark-recapture sampling and antenna detections in the study area, we deﬁned two putative behavioural subpopulations for genetic analy- sis: (1) ‘known migrants,’ and (2) ‘likely residents.’ ‘known migratory’ ﬁsh were those ﬁsh that exhibited a downstream migration, exiting the study area at harris park (n = 304). in converse, ‘likely resident’ ﬁsh were ﬁsh that were never detected at either antenna, and were recaptured annually in the same or adjacent stream reach (n = 83). as a result of variable antenna detection probability and efﬁciency during select periods of time in 2003 and 2004 (50–100% resulting from power outages), we could not deﬁne a ﬁsh as resident, but rather as ‘likely resident’ given the possibility of a missed migration detection at the harris park antenna. however, to mitigate the potential effects of missed detections at the harris park antenna on the identiﬁca- tion of an individuals’ behavioural strategy, we removed all samples from our database that were only detected at the bear creek antenna, as these ﬁsh could be either resident ﬁsh near the antenna, or migratory ﬁsh that were not detected at the harris park antenna. from 2002–2006, no likely-resident ﬁsh were ever detected at either antenna, suggesting that our behavioural deﬁni- tions were appropriate. these two behavioural classes were used for all subsequent analysis. study design phase iii: genetic structure data analysis bull trout genetic population structure finally, for this current genetics study, we combined data on the behavioural strategy of individuals with a microsatellite analysis to evaluate behaviourally based neutral genetic structure within one large stream population. from the initial phase of this study, we had >1300 ﬁn clips available to us for genetic analysis. these ﬁn clips were from ﬁsh >120 mm tl, repre- senting multiple size classes and both resident and migratory behavioural patterns, and were collected throughout the river from 2002–2005. as we were interested in identifying genetic structure within the population as it form, we selected samples for which we had described a behavioural strategy. from our pool of 304 migratory bull trout, we randomly selected 109 samples for genotyping (migra- tory n = 57, mean tl at capture = 354 mm, range tl = 122–720 mm; likely resident n = 52, mean tl at capture = 222 mm, range tl = 139–342 mm). trout, and 83 likely-resident bull relates to behavioural genetic processing conditions trout we extracted total genomic dna from 109 ﬁn clips using a ‘salting out’ protocol (sunnucks & hales 1996). we used pcr to amplify 11 microsatellite loci from these templates following the reaction conditions described by the original authors and summarized by the usfws abernathy fish technology center (aftc). these loci were members of a core set of standard bull loci, with the forward primers ﬂuorescently labelled (6fam or hex): omm1128 hex, sfo18 hex (angers et al. 1995), sco200 6fam, sco202 hex, sco216 6fam, sco220 hex (dehaan & ardren 2005), sma22 hex (crane et al. 2004), sco102 6fam, sco105 6fam, sco109 6fam, sco110 6fam (shaklee, wdfw olympia, wa, summarized by usfws aftc 2003). we conducted pcr using approximately 20 nanograms of sample dna with a total reaction volume of 15 ll. we assessed the pcr products on a 1.0% agarose gel. diluted pcr products were run on an abi3730 dna analyzer (applied biosystems, inc.) with a liz3730 size standard, analyzed using genescan software, and scored using genemapper software (applied biosys- tems, inc.). mention of brand names does not imply endorsement. although we ran all pcr reactions separately, we combined (multiplexed) pcr products from the following combinations of loci for runs on the abi3730 dna analyzer: sco216 and sco202, sco200 and omm1128, and sco105 and sco220. as a quality control measure, we ran replicates of pcr products from a small proportion of the samples on individual lanes to assure that multiplexing did not result in mis-scoring. test we evaluated the null hypothesis of random mating between resident and migratory ﬁsh using a combina- tion of complimentary statistical methods. first, we assessed the microsatellite loci for evidence of linkage disequilibrium and hardy-weinberg disequilibrium. next, we compared resident and migratory ﬁsh with respect to allelic diversity (a, corrected for unequal sample size with rarefaction), multi-locus expected heterozygosity (he), fisher’s exact for genic differentiation (comparison of allele frequencies across loci), and fst, using genepop (version 3.4, ray- mond & rousset 1995; options 1–6). next, we conducted a factorial correspondence analysis (fca) to depict potential clustering of individuals within each behavioural group using the program genetix (version 4.05, belkhir et al. 1996–2004). finally, we evaluated the genotypes of all samples without a priori assumptions about their putative subpopulation of origin to determine the most probable number of subpopulations (k) within the total population using the program structure (version 2.1, pritchard et al. 2000). we selected a burn in length of 100,000 replications, a run length of 100,000, and ran 100 replications using 5 k values (1–5). results before testing for hwe, we assessed whether our microsatellite loci were polymorphic and in linkage disequilibrium. two loci, sfo18 and sco102, were monomorphic in our samples, and sco110 was the same locus as sco216 (based on identical primer sequences), so we removed sfo18, sco102, and sco110 for all subsequent analyses. we found no evidence of linkage disequilibrium between any of the remaining 8 loci (p > 0.05). these 8 loci were polymorphic in both putative subpopulations with an observed number of alleles ranging from 3 to 21 (table 1). both putative subpopulations, and the entire population as a whole, conformed to expected table 1. total number of observed alleles and allele size range per locus, across all samples and for each subpopulation. locus omm1128 sco200 sco202 sco216 sco109 sco105 sco220 sma22 total resident migratory # alleles size range # alleles size range # alleles size range 9 7 3 5 11 6 7 21 275–354 133–157 127–135 239–263 266–387 164–208 299–328 204–283 7 6 3 4 10 5 6 17 275–354 133–153 127–135 239–263 266–387 164–208 299–328 204–283 8 7 3 4 8 6 5 18 275–354 133–157 127–135 239–255 266–387 164–208 299–319 204–279 469 homel et al. hardy-weinberg genotypic proportions at all (p = 0.28). loci we evaluated the potential for non-random mating between resident and migratory ﬁsh in the sfww using several statistical tests, all of which failed to demonstrate neutral genetic differentiation between behavioural groups. allelic diversity (mean number of alleles across loci per subpopulation, with the larger migratory sample size rareﬁed to the smaller resident sample size) was similar for resident and migratory ﬁsh (7.25 and 7.38 respectively). multi-locus expected heterozygosity (he) and observed heterozygosity (ho) were also similar for each subpopulation (he = 0.35 and 0.34 respectively, ho = 0.34 and 0.33 respec- tively). a pair-wise comparison of allele frequencies across loci was not signiﬁcantly different for resident and migratory subpopulations according to fisher’s exact test for genic differentiation (p = 0.85). this lack of structure between groups was further corrob- orated by an insigniﬁcant pair-wise fst value of 0.0037 and a similarly low combined fis value of 0.04. based on an individual-based fca of genetic variation across behaviourally deﬁned groups, we found a complete absence of multidimensional clus- tering (i.e., genetic structure). the ﬁrst four principal components in the fca each explained about 4% of the variation between samples (with the ﬁrst compo- nent explaining 4.85%); thus, a single component was sufﬁcient to describe the variation in our sample. our initial fca depicted three outliers for which we could determine no common denominator, although each contained a unique rare allele. we removed these three outliers from the analysis and still found no clustering in our fca plot based on behavioural form or other potential unidentiﬁed structure (fig. 2). overall, the similarity in allele frequencies, the low migratory resident 1 % 9 4 . 4   2 i s x a  0          1 – –1 0 1 axis 1  4.85% fig. 2. factorial correspondence analysis of the multidimensional genotype of 109 resident and migratory samples. each putative subpopulation is represented by a unique symbol. 470 fst values, and the lack of clustering in the fca plot suggest that resident and migratory ﬁsh comprise a single panmictic breeding population, although it is possible that the number of loci or the sample size were inadequate to detect a very low level of assortative mating. our bayesian analysis of potential population structure (ranging from 1 panmictic population to ﬁve discrete subpopulations, k = 1-5) using the program structure demonstrated complete panmixia; all indi- viduals were assigned an equal probability of belong- ing to each subpopulation, irrespective of the k-value selected, but k = 1 had the highest probability. pair-wise fst values for all k-groups were low (all < 0.05), indicating that the most likely structure for the population is a single panmictic breeding population. discussion in order to better understand the relationship between behavioural variation and neutral genetic population structure, we evaluated the genotypes of 109 individ- uals, representing two putative behavioural subpopu- lations from the sfww. based on our genetic results, we failed to reject the null hypotheses that resident and migratory ﬁsh comprise a panmictic breeding population. the sfww bull (in a transplant experiment our multiple tests for subpopulation structure all trout population is indicated that panmictic with respect to our deﬁned behavioural groups. while this represents the ﬁrst such study of interbreeding between behavioural forms in bull trout, similar results have been observed (with varying degrees of interbreeding) for co-occurring arctic char morphs in southern norway, nordeng 1983), brook_trout behavioural forms (fst = 0.0007 in 2000 and fst = 0.012 in 2001, theriault et al. 2007), and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) behavioural (charles et al. 2005). however, in contrast to nordeng (1983), westgaard et al. (2004) found signiﬁcant reproductive isolation between co-occurring arctic char morphs in northern norway (fst = 0.032). these results suggest that the degree of interbreeding between forms may be med- iated by environmental factors or landscape level processes (mclaughlin 2001). given the variability observed in other salmonids species, it is possible that, across the range of bull the degree of interbreeding between behavioural forms within a population may also vary. forms trout, we suggest two possible mechanisms by which interbreeding between forms may occur: (1) both forms may signiﬁcantly overlap in their selection of spawn sites, resulting in unintentional interbreeding, and (2) small resident males may exhibit the ‘sneaking’ tactic on large migratory females. in our study of bull trout movement patterns in the sfww, we observed that resident and migratory ﬁsh co-occurred, and that resident ﬁsh moved up to 14 km within the study area (during the spawning season, homel and budy in press). previous redd counts in the sfww by the oregon department of fish and wildlife identiﬁed that the majority of spawning activity occurred from approximately 4 km above bear creek, to above reser creek, including the skiphorton and reser creek tributaries (buchanan et al. 1997). however, al-chokhachy et al. (2005) demonstrated that most of these redds likely belonged to larger migratory ﬁsh. despite an imprecise knowledge in the spawning location of resident ﬁsh, the ubiquitous spawning location of migratory ﬁsh would suggest spatial overlap. furthermore, our data on ﬁsh movement suggests that resident and migratory ﬁsh are moving upstream to spawning areas at the same time of year (homel and budy in press). potentially, this temporal and spatial overlap in spawning could result in signiﬁcant interbreeding, independent of mate selec- tion. for example, docker & heath (2003) docu- mented gene ﬂow between co-occurring resident rainbow trout and anadromous steelhead, while narum et al. (2004) detected genetic divergence between those same forms as a result of differing spawn site selection. a second possible mechanism for interbreeding between forms is that smaller resident males may be selecting larger migratory females as mates through exhibiting a ‘sneaking’ tactic. while female ﬁsh have been shown to assortatively mate with similarly sized male ﬁsh (e.g., japanese char, salvelinus leucomaensis, maekawa et al. 1994; sockeye salmon, foote 1989), male ﬁsh may exhibit a sneaking tactic, and breed with signiﬁcantly larger, more fecund female ﬁsh (gross 1991; groot & margolis 1991). as a result of that tactic, resident males would be able to increase their ﬁtness relative to breeding with smaller, less fecund resident females. within the salmonids, there are numerous examples of this tactic. theriault et al. (2007) noted that gene ﬂow between resident and anadromous brook_trout was mediated by resident males mating with both resident and anadromous females. wood & foote (1996) documented a similar pattern between male kokanee salmon and female sockeye salmon. sneaker males have also been documented in coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch, gross 1991) and potentially in rainbow trout (mating with steelhead, zimmerman & reeves 2000; narum et al. 2004). although not expressly observed in sfww spawning surveys, it is possible that bull trout may express this sneaking tactic as well. in our assessment of behaviourally based genetic population structure, there were two potential, albeit bull trout genetic population structure minor, limitations to our study: (1) an inability to sample ﬁsh smaller than 120 mm tl, and (2) low genetic variability within the population. we only collected ﬁn clips from ﬁsh larger than 120 mm tl as this was the smallest size that we could tag, and we needed movement information to analyze genetic structure related to behaviour. however, bull trout are intergenerational breeders, and we do not believe that our failure to sample ﬁsh smaller than 120 mm tl resulted in any bias to our results. the second potential limitation to our study was that we detected a low level of genetic variation in our population which could make it difﬁcult to detect subpopulation structure. however, other bull trout populations have expressed similar levels of within-population genetic variation (e.g., bull trout populations in the yakima river basin had ho values ranging from 0.21–0.45 across six microsatellite loci, independent of population size, reiss 2003). furthermore, as we used metrics to assess genetic population structure that were relative to the total amount of genetic variation in our population (e.g., fst), we do not believe that the low genetic variation in our population would have precluded detection of genetic differences between behavioural forms, were they present. while it is possible that the low variation we detected, in combination with our sample size, could have resulted in a type ii error, this error would only have precluded the detection of a very low level of assortative mating between resident and migratory ﬁsh, and would not otherwise have inﬂu- enced the interpretation of our results. our study represents the ﬁrst genetic comparison of behavioural forms in bull trout, and was unique in that our a priori deﬁnition of behavioural groups was based on extensive monitoring of the movement patterns of >1500 ﬁsh (homel and budy in press). by understand- ing the continuous movement patterns of our ﬁsh, we were able to identify a potential behaviour-related cause for the lack of genetic structure we observed. this pairing of movement studies (via tagging) and genetic analysis improved our fundamental understanding of the evolutionary and ecological interactions between behavioural forms in this population, and how that interaction may shape patterns of random mating between behavioural groups. in managing the sympatric behavioural forms of an endangered species, it is important to consider limita- tions in our understanding of behavioural forms, particularly in the case of random mating. the presence of gene ﬂow between sympatric behavioural forms does not necessitate a lack of adaptive variation between these forms, provided that selective pressure for each form outweighs gene ﬂow (rice & hostert 1993). however, this common pattern of behavioural diversi- ﬁcation and genetic similarity (at neutral markers) reﬂects our limited understanding of the mechanisms 471 homel et al. that determine behavioural strategy. in this study, resident and ﬂuvial bull trout in the sfww comprise a single panmictic breeding population. while we were unable to reject the null hypothesis of panmixia at the level of neutral markers for this population, under different habitat conditions, different connectivity sce- narios, greater behavioural differentiation between resident and migratory ﬁsh, or over a longer time scale, there is potential that a different genetic pattern could exist. furthermore, since measures of neutral molecu- lar- and quantitative-genetic variation (pfrender et al. 2000) and population subdivision (lynch et al. 1999) are often disconnected, a study of quantitative genetic variation (heritability, h2) and subdivision (qst) based on the behavioural morphs would enhance the context of our conclusions. management implications the potential for behavioural groups within a population to randomly mate presents an interesting opportunity for conservation of bull trout. rather than create speciﬁc recovery goals for each life- history form, our research suggests that management should focus on maintaining phenotypic variation within the population. while we do not yet under- stand the mechanism driving the adoption of a life- history tactic in bull trout, we do know that multiple life-history forms within a population increase that population’s resistance to extirpation (via occupation of multiple habitat patches through time, gross 1991). furthermore, both resident and migratory forms fulﬁll unique ecological functions. migratory ﬁsh make an important demographic contribution to the population as a result of the increased fecundity associated with their larger body size (al-chokhachy 2006). conversely, resident ﬁsh ﬁll a predatory niche in the natal stream throughout the year, and potentially could bolster migratory populations via random mating, if behavioural forms can give rise to one another (as suggested in bull trout by dunham et al. 2003; and demonstrated in sympatric sockeye and kokanee salmon, taylor et al. 1996). given the importance of both resident and migratory forms, management must focus on (1) preserving local resident populations (that display local adaptations), and (2) addressing limiting factors for both resident and migratory bull trout. acknowledgements this research was funded by the us fish and wildlife service columbia river fisheries program ofﬁce, the us geological survey ⁄
