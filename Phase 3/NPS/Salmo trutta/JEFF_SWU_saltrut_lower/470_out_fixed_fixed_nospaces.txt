they initiate and control the ﬁne-scaled temporal pattern as well as the intensity of the spawning migration. in addition, a combination of increasing water temperatures and decreasing water levels, corresponding to the period after a ﬂood peak, offers high predictability of favourable spawning conditions at the spawning place and acts as a stimulus for the right timing for upstream migration in danube nase. g. rakowitz1, b. berger1, j. kubecka2, h. keckeis1 1department of freshwater ecology, university of vienna, vienna, austria, 2hydrobiological institute of academy of sciences of the czech republic, cˇ eske´ budeˇjovice, czech republic key words: freshwater ﬁsh;

e-mail: georg.rakowitz@univie. ac.at accepted for publication february 29, 2008 introduction one of the most obvious changes in behaviour is that related to spawning activity, which has a marked impact on the migratory behaviour of many ﬁsh species (lucas & baras 2001). the initiation of spawning in ﬁsh is controlled by an endogenous cycle of gonadal development and by an internal mechanism that synchronises this cycle with environmental cues (vlaming 1974; munro et al. 1990; wootton 1990). northcote (1969, 1998) and westin (1977) proposed that temperature acts as a directional orientation cue or as a threshold stimulus for initiating migratory move- ment prior to spawning (raymond 1979), particularly in combination with other environmental stimuli such as discharge and photoperiod, although distinguishing, which are direct and which are indirect effects is difﬁcult. increased water temperature and increased water level are among the main factors effecting upstream spawning migration, especially in salmonids (banks 1969; northcote 1984; jonsson 1991; erkinaro in some species, small changes in et al. 1999). temperature may strongly affect the behaviour of lamprey lampetra ﬂuviatilis spawners, (linnaeus) (sjo¨berg 1977), especially when responses occur at precise temperature thresholds as, for exam- ple, in barbel barbus barbus (linnaeus) (baras & philippart 1999). river i.e., recently, more research has been carried out on the movements of cyprinids (mills 1991; baras 1995; slavik 1996; clough et al. 1998; lucas 2000), whereby migratory patterns clearly associated with spawning 502 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00302.x (rodriguez-ruiz & granado-lorencio 1992; penaz 1996; winter & fredrich 2003) have been demon- strated. several native cyprinids of the danube under- take spawning migrations into tributaries (schiemer & waidbacher 1992), among which nase chondrostoma nasus (l.) is an indicator species of good river ecosystem health over the breadth of its distribution in europe (lelek 1987; winﬁeld & townsend 1991; schiemer et al. 2004). in many large rivers its abun- dance and distribution has dramatically declined (penaz 1996) because of habitat fragmentation (welcomme 1994; ward & tockner 2001). studies about spawning behaviour (zbinden & maier 1996; huber & kirchhofer 1998), spawning sites composi- tion (lusk et al. 1995; keckeis 2001) and large-scaled migrations (steinmann et al. 1937; povz 1988) have been carried out, but very little is known about the ﬁne- scaled patterns and environmental triggers and cues for short-term variability of its spawning migration. in the present study, we used horizontal echo sounding for online monitoring of the spawning migration of nase into an austrian tributary of the danube river and related the observed pattern to a range of abiotic parameters (i.e., water temperature, water level and turbidity) on a ﬁne temporal scale. beyond a general seasonal component, these factors ﬂuctuate considerably in natural systems. we provide evidence that the ﬂuctuations of these environmental cues – short-term increases or decreases within the spawning season – are relevant stimuli for describing the magnitude and timing of the spawning migration in danube nase. n environmental cues in nase spawning migration study area the fischa river is a tributary of the danube river east of vienna, originating at an altitude of 240 m in southern lower austria (haschendorf ⁄ ebenfurth) and ﬂowing northeast for 35 km before joining the danube (fig. 1). together with its main tributary, the piesting river, which originates at an altitude of 1200 m, the total catchment area is 549.4 km2, with a pluvio-nival drain-regime (mader et al. 1996) and a mean annual )1. spring (march ⁄ april) and discharge of 7.5 m3æ s (november ⁄ december) ﬂoods are common winter (kresser 1989). the water temperature does not exceed 16.0 °c during summer. its hyporithral char- acter changes into epi- and metapotamal within a transition area approximately 4.0 km upstream of the conﬂuence with the danube, where discharge is mainly inﬂuenced by the danube water level. in spring, the river is characterised by a sequence of single-species spawning events starting with pike esox lucius linnaeus and dace leuciscus leuciscus (linnaeus), followed by nase, barbel and ide leuciscus idus (linnaeus) (keckeis & rakowitz 2005). two nase spawning sites are located 4.5 km upstream the mouth, where the fischa splits into several smaller branches, creating a local ﬂoodplain area (fig. 1). two of these branches contain rifﬂes with high current velocity and are regularly frequented by the same nase individuals from year to year (keckeis 1999; keckeis in this & rakowitz 2006). adults are present river system only during spawning season, from march to early june (keckeis 1999). 0 500 m danube fischa river spawning area weir echo sounder traps 2004 traps 2005 water temperature water gauge turbidity fig. 1. the danube river in austria and its tributary, the fischa river, showing spawn- ing areas of nase, locations of the echo sounder and traps and where environmental variables were recorded. 0 50 100 km 503 rakowitz et al. materials and methods hydroacoustic recording the hydroacoustic investigation of the spawning migration of nase into the fischa river was conducted in the transition area at a site 4.0 km upstream of the river mouth (fig. 1). the cross-sectional riverbed topography here is well suited for ﬁxed location horizontal beaming: a triangular cross-section with a gently sloping right shore and steeply sloping left shore. at average discharge the river cross-section at the sampling site is 15.0 m wide with a maximum depth of 2.15 m near the left shore. the bottom consists of gravel and has an even gradient with small obtrusions. the site is located about 500 m down- stream of the spawning areas and about 4 km from the conﬂuence, a sufﬁcient distance to minimise hydroa- coustic recording of other danubian ﬁsh species migrating in the lower part of the tributary. also, water level ﬂuctuations during spring ﬂoods are less extensive than in the area of the conﬂuence without needing to dismantle the hydroacoustic setup because of high water levels. from 30 march to 27 may 2004 and from 12 march to 3 may 2005, hydroacoustic data were collected near- continuously with a portable 120 khz digital echo sounder (simrad, ek 60, horten, norway) and an elliptical (4.4° · 8.3°) splitbeam transducer. the trans- ducer was mounted on a tetrapod-scaffold and aimed horizontally across the river from the right shore towards the left shore using a dual-axis remote controlled rotator (sub-atlantic, 1128-mas, aber- deen, scotland). a panel fence was placed downstream of the transducer to guide upstream migrating ﬁsh out of the transducer’s nearﬁeld. the panel fence was manufactured from solid plastic tubes with a lattice spacing of 1.5 cm, ﬁxed on the ground and equipped with ﬂoating bodies on the top. prior to continuous echo-sounding, beam mapping was conducted to adjust the horizontal beam as close to the bottom as possible in order to detect bottom-oriented upstream migrating ﬁsh. the beam was tilted downwards by 7.6° degrees and panned downstream with 13.0° degrees. once properly oriented, the echo sounder system was calibrated in situ using the tungsten-carbide standard calibration sphere (ø = 23.00 mm) with a nominal target strength (ts) value of ts = )40.40 db and kept stationary for the whole sampling period. basic information about the sound propagation in the horizontal bottom-aligned beam is given by rakowitz & kubecka (2006). during monitoring, sound pulses were transmitted in average with the duration of 0.10 ms, the pulse width of 0.064 ms, the bandwidth of 11.80 khz and the pulse )1. the sensitivity threshold repetition rate of 10 pingsæs the power of 63 w, 504 the level of value of the detected echoes was set to )50.00 db because of the background noise. to increase the detectability in the horizontal bottom- aligned beam, the echo length detector was set to 0.8– 1.5 times the transmitted pulse, the maximum phase to 1.2° and the maximum gain deviation was set compensation was enhanced to 6 db (one-way). signals were automatically compensated for off-axis distance. the echo sounder was in operation for an average 23.5 h a day for 59 days in 2004 and 53 days in 2005. changing environmental conditions (water level, turbidity) did not alter the efﬁciency of the hydroacoustic system. analog data from the transducer were digitalised in the echo sounder’s gpt unit (general purpose transceiver), recorded on a laptop and stored on an external hard disk. hydroacoustic analysis regularly for this study, a total of 66 days – 33 days each year – were analysed with sonar5-pro version 5.9.1 post- processing software (balk & lindem 2000, 2002; lindem data acquisition, oslo, norway), which was updated (http://www.fys.uio.no/~hbalk). data recorded in 2005 was additionally corrected for biased ts-values because of inhomogeneous sound propagation in the horizontal bottom-aligned beam (rakowitz & kubecka 2006). to obtain the total number of upstream migrating nase (fig. 2e,f), the remaining 26 and 23 days, respectively, were interpo- lated using the mean of upstream migrants of the day before and the day after. linear regression analysis between daily counts and interpolated data from a continuous series of 11 days in 2005 revealed a highly signiﬁcant relationship (r2 = 0.91, p < 0.001). after conversion of raw data, the acoustic analysis was carried out by single echo detection (sed). for sed, we did not apply a traditional detector based on echo length (soule et al. 1997), but the alternative cross- ﬁlter detector (balk 2001) found in sonar5. this detector has been developed to improve track quality and to reduce erroneous detections in data with low signal-to-noise ratio (snr). the detector contains a suggestor obtaining trace candidates, an evaluator sorting out unwanted candidates, a sed former which deﬁnes the individual echo detections within a trace and an echo quality estimator. the suggestor works with ﬁlters identifying the targets frequency response while the evaluator operates with a set of min and max trace feature tests. in 2004 and 2005, the cross-ﬁlter settings which provided best results for tracking ﬁsh in the fischa were for the suggestor: foreground ﬁlter: height = 1 and 1, width = 1 and 1; background ﬁlter: height = 23 and 11, width = 7 and 13; offset = +6 and +6 db. for the evaluator, trace length and trace area were used. minimum and maximum values for the ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t t r e a w ) m c ( l e v e t l r e a w ) u t n ( y t i i d b r u t s t r n a r g m i environmental cues in nase spawning migration 2004 (a) 2005 (b) spawning area transition area confluence danube turbidity (d) (f) (c) (e) 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 500 400 300 200 100 50 0 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2 9 / 2 / 0 4 3 0 / 5 / 0 4 7 / 3 / 0 4 2 3 / 5 / 0 4 1 6 / 5 / 0 4 2 1 / 3 / 0 4 2 8 / 3 / 0 4 1 1 / 4 / 0 4 1 4 / 3 / 0 4 4 / 4 / 0 4 1 8 / 4 / 0 4 2 5 / 4 / 0 4 9 / 5 / 0 4 2 / 5 / 0 4 2 8 / 2 / 0 5 7 / 3 / 0 5 1 6 / 5 / 0 5 1 4 / 3 / 0 5 3 0 / 5 / 0 5 2 8 / 3 / 0 5 2 1 / 3 / 0 5 2 3 / 5 / 0 5 1 1 / 4 / 0 5 1 8 / 4 / 0 5 4 / 4 / 0 5 2 5 / 4 / 0 5 2 / 5 / 0 5 9 / 5 / 0 5 ) 1 – y a d  d n i ( fig. 2. water temperature (a, b), water level and turbidity (c, d) at different sections of the fischa river and the danube river and number of daily upstream migrating nase estimated from hydroacoustic records (e, f) in spring 2004 and 2005. f o . o n echoes track length were 1–250 pings and for the area 8–232 number of samples in a detected region. the settings rejected unwanted single from drifting debris, stones and from ﬂuctuations in the back- ground reverberation level to be included in the ﬁsh tracks. they remained fairly consistent over the study periods. automatic tracking caused severe bias of counts and sizing, we therefore applied manual tracking. identifying acoustic nase targets using supplementary sampling length (total to obtain qualitative information about migrating ﬁsh species, trap net catches and electro ﬁshing were conducted, and sex, length, cm) and weight (fresh weight, g) of the captured individuals were measured. in 2004, the traps were placed in the left (in terms of ﬂow direction) spawning arm 80 m downstream of the spawning place and 380 m upstream from the echo-sounding site and hence sampled only a part of the river. in 2005, the traps were put closer to the site of the echosounder and sampled the whole width (fig. 1). they were built from iron bars with 4 m in length, 1.3 m wide and 1.2 m high and the mesh size of the ﬂute was 10 mm. they were set to catch upstream as well as down- stream migrating ﬁsh. detailed information on the construction of the traps is described in mu¨hlbauer et al. (2003). the traps were emptied once a day in the morning from 8 march to 28 may 2004 and from 25 february to 6 may 2005, excluding 25 days when the traps were ﬂooded. electro ﬁshing was conducted four times in 2004 (21, 22, 26 april and 21 may) and three times in 2005 (7, 8 april and 3 may). we used a portable generator feg 1000 (200 v, 3 a). both spawning branches were sampled from the conﬂuence of the two branches to the end of the spawning places (fig. 1) within 1 day. from the species which undertake spawning migra- tions from the danube into the tributary, 80% of the total catch of migrants was comprised by nase, 9% by barbel, 5% by ide, 3% by white bream abramis bjoerkna (linnaeus) and the remaining 3% by pike, bream abramis brama (linnaeus), vimba vimba vimba (linnaeus) and burbot lota lota (linnaeus). nase were separated from nontarget species based on the captured individuals (romakkaniemi et al. 2000; lilja & romakkaniemi 2003). although nase is breeding at a size above 20 cm, 80% of the total catch of nase was comprised by nase between 45 and 55 cm. furthermore, 93% of length distribution of 505 rakowitz et al. all migrants in the size range of 45–55 cm were represented by nase. thus a size range between 45 and 55 cm was applied to the hydroacoustically recorded ﬁsh to separate nase from non-target ﬁsh. the (2005) was applied to convert relationship between ts and ﬁsh tl, ts = 24.71 · (log10 · tl) ) 89.63, from frouzova et al. the size of captured individuals into ts values. accordingly, the total length of 45–55 cm corresponds to ts values of )21.91 to )24.07 db. environmental parameters during the sampling period, water temperature (°c), water level (cm) and turbidity (ntu) were measured in daily intervals. water temperature was measured at four and water level at three different sites, respec- tively along a longitudinal proﬁle (spawning area, transition area, conﬂuence and danube river), turbid- ity at one site (fig. 1). the water level in the fischa was read off at a water level in the left spawning arm and at a water level near the echo-sounding site every day in the morning. daily water level data and mean daily water temperature data of the danube were provided from the nearest installed water level orth by the austria water authority via-donau. turbidity was measured once a day using a portable turbidimeter (turbiquant 1000 ir; merck, darmstadt, germany) at the traps. statistical analyses the kolmogorov–smirnov-test (k-s-test) was used to test the biotic and abiotic data set (ﬁsh passage rate, temperature, water level and turbidity) for normal distribution. between year differences water temper- ature and average upstream passage rate were tested with the mann–whitney u-test. between year differ- ences of water temperature at the spawning site was tested with a t-test, as these data revealed a normal distribution. between site differences of water temperature and water level were tested with a kruskal–wallis test. spearman rank correlations between daily passage rate and time series of environmental variables were estimated with time lags of up to ±7 days at intervals of 1 day for all variables. the time series were calculated according to y = xt – x(t)1), where x is the measured value at the point of time t, to render them stationary (lilja & romakkaniemi 2003). for each time lag, the differ- ences (1–7 days) were summed up. the signiﬁcant correlation of each variable and the highest signiﬁcant correlation of the time lags were used for further statistical analyses. regression models (peak, expo- nential) were used to analyse the mode of triggering. finally, a multiple linear regression analysis (spss 506 15.0.1) was employed to analyse the pattern of the ﬂuctuations in the spawning runs. results in 2004 and 2005, water temperatures were very similar and did not differ signiﬁcantly between the spawning and the transition area (mann–whitney u-test, p > 0.05). at the spawning area, values ranged from 6.3 to 13.8 °c in 2004 and from 3.9 to 14.5 °c in 2005. at this site highly signiﬁcant differences (t-test, p < 0.001) were observed between the two investigation periods, the corresponding average (±sd) temperatures were 10.9 ± 2.0 and 8.9 ± 2.7, respectively. during both years, temperature increased in an oscillating pattern with amplitudes of ±3.0–4.0 °c within a 5–10-day period (fig. 2a,b). in general, the oscillation amplitudes in the danube river were damped compared with the fischa river. at the start of the danube was 1.0–2.0 °c colder than the fischa, followed by a period of nearly same temperature levels in both rivers. in late may, the danube river was approxi- mately 2.0 °c warmer than the fischa. the average temperatures between the two rivers within each investigation period were not signiﬁcantly different (kruskal–wallis test, p > 0.05), but a signiﬁcant linear relationship is evident between the water temperature of the danube and that at the spawning site (fig. 3a). the linear regression (r2 = 0.87, a = 3.27, b = 0.70, p < 0.001) indicated signiﬁcantly higher fischa water temperatures at times of low temperatures in the danube, i.e., 3.00 °c in the danube correspond with an average of 5.3 °c in the fischa, and 6.0 °c in the danube correspond with 7.5 °c in the tributary. the sampling period, two of the three recorded water levels revealed a similar pattern of water level ﬂuctuations, resulting in a strong synchronisation (spearman coefﬁcient, r = 0.88, p < 0.001) of water level in the transition area of the fischa with water level in the danube. this was not the case at the spawning site (fig. 3b), except during several peak ﬂoods in 2005 when the hydro- logical situation of the spawning area was impacted. in 2004 no peak ﬂood occurred in danube, but 2005 was characterised by water level ﬂuctuations over several meters (fig. 2c,d). average water levels at the three sites, as well as range and variations, are given in table 1. water level at all sites differed signiﬁcantly between the 2 years (kruskal–wallis test, p < 0.001). in 2005, the variation of the danube water level was signiﬁ- cantly higher compared with 2004. mean turbidity in the fischa was twice as high in 2005 (tur05 = 28.53 ntu) than in 2004 (tur04 = 12.59 ntu), which corre- sponds well with the observed water level differences between years. the higher turbidity in 2005 mainly spawning area danube 1 : 1 (a) ) c º ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w r e v i r a b u n a d d n a r e v i r a h c

2004, the ﬁrst individuals were caught in the traps on 17 march, in 2005 recorded on 12 march. the average passage rate (±sd) between the 2 years differed signiﬁcantly (mann–whitney u-test, p < 0.05), being 22 (±22) individualsæday individ- ualæday the highest peak of migrants was observed on 1 and 2 april (125 and 110 nase, respectively), the second highest on 13 april (56) and the third highest on 25 april (25) (fig. 2e). the spawning migration took place to a lesser extent during the remaining sampling period. in 2005, we also observed three main migration peaks. the ﬁrst immigration peak was on 16 march (48 nase), the second on 26 march (60) and the third on 7 april (81) (fig. 2f). in 2004, highly signiﬁcant correlations between daily upstream passage rate and environmental parameters like water temperature, water level and turbidity were detected (fig. 4). in the fischa spawning area, low water temperature (r = )0.266, p < 0.05), but espe- cially increasing water temperature after 5 days (r = +0.430, p < 0.01), correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of migrants (fig. 4a). in 2004, a temper- ature increase from 5.1 to 7.0 °c in danube and from 7.3 to 9.8 °c in the fischa within 5 days corresponded with the trap net catch of the ﬁrst four mature nase individuals. also in the conﬂuence (r = )0.399, p < 0.01) and in the danube (r = )0.395, p < 0.01) low water temperatures were most signiﬁcantly correlated with the migration rate. additionally, increasing water temperature after 1 day in the conﬂuence (r = 0.273, p < 0.05) and after 3 days in the danube (r = 0.270, p < 0.05) showed signiﬁcant correlation with the number of upstream migrants at the echosounder (fig. 4b,c). at the transition area, an increased water level (r = 0.424, p < 0.01) and a decreasing water level after 6 days (r = )0.299, p < 0.05) showed the highest correlations with upstream-migrating nase (fig. 4d). in the danube, a signiﬁcant correlation was observed between an increased water level and upstream-migrat- ing spawners (r = 0.277, p < 0.05), but decreasing water level after 6 days was even more highly corre- lated (r = )0.312, p < 0.05) (fig. 4e). decreasing turbidity in the fischa with a time lag of )6 days (r = )0.448, p < 0.01), mainly caused by decreasing water level, showed the most signiﬁcant correlation with the number of upstream migrants (fig. 4f). the water level at the

in the danube (r2 = 0.27, p < 0.001) at 7.5 °c (fig. 5a–c). furthermore, a signiﬁcant relationship between number of migrants and water temperature ﬂuctuations was observed. pooled data of water

(2003) observed that a +4.5 °c increase of water temperature was associated with the largest catch per unit effort (cpue). rodriguez-ruiz & granado-lorencio (1992) identiﬁed water temperature as the dominant environmental factor inﬂuencing upstream migration and migration speed of cyprinids in the guadalete river in spain. steinmann et al.

(ovidio et al. 1998). our ﬁshes’ ﬁtness results demonstrate that an optimal stimulus for the spawn- ing migration in nase is a combination of variables, namely a slight increase of water temperature in the main habitat (the danube river) synchronized with a steep increase of water temperature at the spawning site in the tributary, in combination with a falling water level after ﬂood peaks. during spawning season the warmer water of the tributary causes a small, constant temperature difference between the conﬂuence and the danube, and might also act as a stimulus to maintain spawning migration into the tributary. our results therefore also demonstrate that ﬂuctuations of the environmental conditions within the main river itself represent relevant cues which initiate and control the temporal pattern as well as the intensity of nase spawning migrations. for nase, the predictability of favourable spawning conditions at the spawning place is high when a combination of increasing water temperatures and decreasing water levels (with certain time lags) acts as a stimulus for the right timing. during periods of high environ- mental unpredictability, as occur in spring in northern and temperate latitudes, ﬁsh have to take advantage of short periods of high environmental predictability, especially in terms of spawning migrations. this no doubt enables them to achieve high reproductive success and to increase their ﬁtness. to grasp the functional role of the environmental factors, discrete thresholds have impact on the migra- tory behaviour on a seasonal scale, but fail to explain short-term initiation of migration and migration pat- terns within spawning seasons. our results revealed the important functional role of the ﬂuctuations of variables within the season. they serve as a time- (in reference to season) and threshold-independent environmental 512 stimulus for migratory behaviour in general and for the spawning migration of nase speciﬁcally.
