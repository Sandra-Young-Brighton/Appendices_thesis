(1996), barbin zydlewski et al. (2001), greenberg & giller (2000), lucas & baras (2000), riley et al. (2002, movement of eels in a chalk stream 2003) and riley (2007) discussed the suitability and limitations of such pit antenna systems for studying ﬁsh movement, behaviour and habitat preference. this study employed a unique pit experimental facility to undertake a 2-year ﬁeld-based investigation into the movement and behaviour of wild european eels. materials and methods the study area was a carrier stream of the river itchen, hampshire, uk, that ﬂows across an unlit water meadow between the itchen navigation canal and the main river itchen, near winchester in southern england (51°03¢12¢¢n; 01°18¢39¢¢w) (fig. 1b). the brandy stream is 400 m long with an average width of 3.8 m and is fed from the itchen navigation canal via a single undershot-type sluice gate. the water velocity under the sluice is permanently >3 ms therefore )1 and is (a) (b) fig. 1.

(2006, 2009). on 19 september 2007 and 28 october 2008, european eels within the study site, and immediately downstream of the permanently ﬁxed pit antennae systems, were caught using electric ﬁshing (ac output 240 v, 50 hz, rectiﬁed to unsmoothed dc) in stop- netted sections, using one anode and two hand nets. a minimum of three passes were carried out in each section. eels were anaesthetised (approximately )1 of 2-phenoxyethanol), measured for total 1.0 mlæl length (tl; nearest 1 mm) and marked with a pit tag (12 mm long · 2.12 mm diameter). pit tags were implanted by ﬁrst making an incision penetrating the eels’ peritoneum (on the ventral side, just anterior of the vent, slightly to the left of a mid-ventral line) using the sterilised needle supplied with each tag. the transponder was then inserted by gently pushing it through the incision in an anterior direction into the body cavity. antibiotic powder (cicatrin) was applied to the incision to prevent infection. in addition, eels pit-tagged in 2008 (and those tagged in 2007 and recaptured in 2008) also had visible implant elastomer tags (north- west marine technology, shaw island, wa, usa) implanted on the ventral side, posterior of the vent, as a secondary mark to investigate pit tag retention. all eels were returned to their site of capture within 2 h. to the study site returned on 19 september 2007, 79 eels were pit-tagged and (tl range: 175–542 mm) and nine immediately downstream of the permanently ﬁxed pit antennae systems (tl range: 231–520 mm). on 28 october 2008, 11 eels were pit-tagged and returned to the study site (tl range: 202–350 mm) and two immediately down- stream of the permanently ﬁxed pit antennae systems (tl 302 and 470 mm). in addition, on 28 october 2008, 2 pit-tagged eels were re-caught from the 2007 survey and returned to the study site (tl 291 and 630 317 mm). the maximum likelihood model of carle & strub (1978) was used to estimate the population size. in 2007, the population size of the study site was estimated to be 97 ± 23 and 13 ± 8 immediately downstream of the permanently ﬁxed pit antennae systems. in 2008, it was estimated that all the eels, residing both within the study site and immediately downstream of the permanently ﬁxed pit antennae systems, were caught. the subsequent movements of these pit-tagged eels were recorded by the pit antenna at each of the streams exits. dredging of the navigation canal in 2008 required a signiﬁcant reduction in ﬂow for the brandy stream to be imposed between 27 and 31 july (inclusive), during which time the water was also very turbid. in addition, a lamp installed immediately adjacent to exit 3 was programmed to switch on every alternate night between 12 march and 15 may in both 2008 and 2009 as part of another investigation into the impact of artiﬁcial light on the onset of downstream movement of wild atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) smolts. the lamp switched on at 18:00 hrs (before sunset) and was switched off at 06:30 hrs (after sunrise). the lamp was on during the ﬁrst night of study (12 march) in 2008 and off during the ﬁrst night of study in 2009. water temperature measurements were taken using tinytags (gemini data loggers uk ltd, chichester, uk), secured to the streambed. these programmable data loggers underwent a three-point calibration (at 0 °c, 15 °c and 20 °c) by gemini before deploy- ment. these tags were programmed to record temper- ature once every 15 min. mean daily ﬂows were obtained from an environment agency gauging station situated at highbridge on the main channel of the river itchen. as the itchen navigation canal in winchester is fed directly from the main river itchen and the ﬂow into the brandy stream is determined by the area of the sluice gate opening and the water head difference across the sluice, these main river discharge values were used to provide an indication of the likely monthly variation in ﬂow in the brandy stream. sunrise and sunset times for the study area were calculated to the nearest minute using the method of hohenkerk & yallop (2004). day length was determined as the period between sunrise and sunset, and the periods of rapidly changing light intensity before sunrise (dawn) and after sunset (dusk) were incorporated into the night category. analyses were performed on the time of movement of eels in relation to time of day (expressed as hours after sunset); days following the previous new moon; and days following the previous perigee and apogee (which are the dates that the moon is closest and furthest from the earth, respectively, over a full cycle of approximately 28 days). as each of these variables are cyclic in nature (i.e., any phase of time within them can be represented by an angle around a circle), analyses were performed using circular statistics (batschelet 1981). mean vectors (representing the mean time ⁄ angle of movement) and mean vector length (r) (ranging from 0 to 1, which represents that the concentration of individual data points decreases as the concentration of the sample points around a mean direction diminishes) were calculated for each vari- able, and rayleigh tests for randomness were per- formed to assess the level of statistical signiﬁcance (p) of the mean vector. rayleigh tests examine whether the sample data points differ signiﬁcantly from random- ness (uniform distribution) or, in other words, whether there is statistical evidence of directedness. in this case, the tests were designed to investigate whether the movements of eels were ‘directed’ around particular phases ⁄ angles within the circular rhythm of each variable (i.e., were movements directed around a particular time following sunset etc?). grouping variables included: year of tagging; size class at tagging; stream exit; days following tagging; season of movement; and month of movement. results between 19 september 2007 and 14 october 2009, 118 detection events, representing 72 independent movements by 39 eels, were logged. as two antennae were installed at each exit ⁄ entrance to the brandy stream (separated by <1 m at stream exits 1 and 2 and by 12.6 m at exit 3), each independent eel movement often consisted of more than one related detection event (mean = 1.64; maximum = 10; minimum = 1). related detection events were grouped into indepen- dent movements on the basis of time antenna pairs and both (mean = 444 s, for all their movement of eels in a chalk stream upstream and downstream movements; maxi- mum = 3759 s, an upstream movement of 12.6 m; minimum = 0.27 s, a downstream movement of <1m) and space (exit ⁄ entrance) intervals. this method of grouping detection events has previously been assessed (using traps and the location of subsequently recaptured individual ﬁsh) and found to be robust, for downstream-migrating salmon smolts (riley et al. 2002; riley 2007) and upstream- and downstream- moving resident salmon parr, brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) and grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.) (riley 2007; riley et al. 2009; riley & pawson 2010). to date (autumn 2010), the aforementioned method has correctly predicted the location within the brandy stream of all (n = 11) subsequently re-caught pit- tagged eels. records indicated that ﬁsh moved past the antennae in both directions, conﬁrming that they were capable of travelling between the different sections of the stream. the mean number of detections per logged eel was 3.03 (maximum = 15; minimum = 1).the mean number of movements by the 39 detected eels was 1.85 (maximum = 6; minimum = 1). figure 2 shows the monthly number of movements in relation to the monitored or calculated environmen- tal parameters. no eel movements were recorded in the winter months (december–february) and march, when the mean daily stream temperatures were at their lowest, day length at the study site was short and the mean monthly discharge of the river itchen (uk environment agency data) was greatest. the numbers of movements peaked in may, when mean water temperatures and day length were increasing. consid- erably fewer movements were detected in august compared with may–july and september–october, coincident with the peak in mean water temperature. fig. 2. number of movements of individual eels (anguilla anguilla) in relation to calculated ⁄ measured environmental parameters. movement, mean monthly temperature, mean monthly day length, - day movement, mean monthly ﬂow. - night 631 riley et al. the majority (72%) of movements were detected during the hours of darkness (fig. 2). twenty-six eels were detected moving (36 move- ments) only at night. a few eels were detected moving only during the hours of daylight (four eels, nine movements), but this was less common, and some eels were detected moving during both day and night (nine eels, 27 movements). daylight movements were limited to april, may, july and october. there were similar numbers of movements in upstream and downstream directions in may, but relatively more upstream movements in the other months, particularly in august, september and november when no down- stream movements were detected (fig. 2). for summer (june–august) (p > 0.05, r2 = 0.25, n = 31) the movements of eels were signiﬁcantly directed around particular times of the day. the mean time of movement (all data) was 3:45 hrs following sunset (+ sunset) (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.45, n = 72) (fig. 3). the timing of movements in relation to sunset was similar for each season; with means of 3:11 hrs + sunset spring (p < 0.001, r2 = (march–may), 4:03 hrs + sunset 0.71, n = 25) and 3:37 hrs + sunset (p < 0.05, r2 = 0.45, n = 16) for autumn (september–november). however, it should be noted that the hypotheses of random movement could not be rejected during the spring. this was mainly attributable to a larger number of detections occurring during the morning, a pattern that was also evident at a monthly scale with may having detection times more evenly distributed between the hours of dark and light. for fig. 3. circular plot of the time of movement of individual eels (anguilla anguilla) in relation to sunset calculated for the day of each movement (2007–2009). the line is the mean vector indicating the mean time of downstream movement for both years pooled (±95% conﬁdence intervals). d = normal movements, s = movements during dredge window, lamp off, 4 = street lamp on. = street 632 patterns of movements, with regard to sunset, in upstream and downstream directions were very sim- ilar; mean movement times were 4:37 hrs + sunset (p > 0.05, r2 = 0.27, n = 24) for upstream and 3:33 hrs + sunset (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.55, n = 48) for downstream movements. however, randomness could not be rejected for upstream movements. grouping the data by year of tagging did not affect the pattern of movement, with eels from both tagging years showing mean movement times related to sunset. mean movement times were 3:27 hrs + sunset (p < 0.001; r2 = 0.44, n = 60) and 5:00 hrs + sunset (p < 0.05; r2 = 0.55, n = 12) for 2007 and 2008, respectively. similarly, separating eel movements into groups representing time elapsed between tagging and detection had little effect on the overall pattern, with all groups displaying mean vectors with overlapping conﬁdence intervals, although in some instances the small sample sizes meant that randomness could not be rejected. groups were chosen by identifying post- tagging intervals in the data set and included eels detected within 15 days of for evidence of a tagging effect) and those ﬁrst detected between 15 and 65 days, 195 and 365, and 600 + days post-tagging. tagging (to test dredging of the navigation canal in summer 2008 coincided with only seven eel movements (fig. 3), for which randomness could not be rejected (p > 0.05). similarly, the street-lit experiment coincided with only 12 eel movements, seven on nights (or the following day) that the light was on and ﬁve on nights (or the following day) when the light had been off (fig. 3). randomness could not be rejected for either group (p > 0.05). bonferroni correction of the above nonindependent tests dictates a modiﬁed level of probability (conser- vatively adjusted to p < 0.005) be regarded as signif- icant. evidence of correlations between eel movement and lunar activity was mixed. whilst movement was random with respect to days following the previous new moon, some relationships did exist between eel movements and the days following the last perigee. however, following bonferroni correction, none were found to be signiﬁcant. all eels marked with visible implant elastomer tags in 2008 and re-caught during the annual electric ﬁshing surveys conducted in october 2009 (n = 3) and october 2010 (n = 2) were found to have retained their pit tag. discussion to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to record the exact time of the onset of movement of wild european eels. other studies have reported times based on recording capture times in traps or nets of european eels (white & knights 1997) or larger-scale telemetric studies of other anguillid species (jellyman & sykes 2003). however, such studies are often time-con- strained by the trap clearance interval (i.e., the time between two checks of the trap) and the initial position of the eels relative to the traps or receivers, a distance that could have differed signiﬁcantly amongst the captured ⁄ detected individuals. in the present study, the exits to the brandy stream were continually monitored for pit-tagged eels over a period of more than 2 years, and any correlation between eel movements and a measured or calculated environmental variable is considered to be meaningful because of the very short distance between the eels’ previous position in the brandy stream and the positions of the pit antennae (maximum downstream distance = 270 m). seasonality of movements the intensity and timing of eel movements have been correlated with a variety of environmental factors including water temperature, lunar phases, increased river ﬂow and turbidity, etc. (baras et al. 1998; reviewed by cairns & hooley 2003; feunteun et al. 2003; haro 2003). water temperature is one proximate factor initiating movements ⁄ migrations in many diad- romous ﬁsh species, e.g., studies have reported that downstream migration of salmon and sea_trout (salmo_trutta l.) smolts occurs at a ‘critical temperature’ of 10 °c (mccormick et al. 1998). other studies have shown that 6 °c is critical for enhancing general activity in eels and 10 °c for initiating migrations in eels larger than 260 mm (naismith & knights 1988; white & knights 1997; feunteun et al. 2003; chad- wick et al. 2007). in this study, no eel movements were detected during the winter months (and march) when the mean stream temperature was below 10 °c. the movement of eels began in the spring as the stream temperature reached 10 °c and continued through the autumn until the stream temperature fell below 9 °c. these temperatures are slightly lower than those previously proposed as lower limits for the upstream migration of elvers and the trapping of juvenile eels in the uk (white & knights 1997) and the movement of larger yellow eels in france (baras et al. 1998) and new zealand (jellyman et al. 1996). in contrast, elver and silver eel catches in north-west france were made over a broad temperature range (3– 26 °c and 4–23 °c, respectively), although most elver catches (>90%) were made when river temperatures were ‡12 °c and most silver eel catches (>76%) were made when river temperatures were between 6 and 10 °c (acou et al. 2008, 2009). there were twice as many eel movements in may compared with that of any other month. this peak movement of eels in a chalk stream presumably redistributions, likely reﬂects an increased feeding activity in situ and ⁄ or from winter refuges to summer feeding habitats. mean stomach fullness of eels in two welsh streams increased tenfold between march and april ⁄ may (sinha & jones 1967). the downstream emigration of small, putatively immature, yellow eels from the girnock burn started in april and peaked in may (chadwick et al. 2007). glass eel and elver recruitment into freshwater habitats typically occurs during april to june in european (white & knights 1997) and other anguillid spp. (jessop 2003). the relatively low number of movements in august is difﬁcult to explain in terms of local environmental factors. most eel movements were detected during the hours of darkness, but the nights were longer in august than in may, june or july when movements were far greater. the maximum recorded water temperature during the study period was 19.2 °c, logged between 19:30 and 20:13 hrs on 2 july 2009. however, mean monthly water temperature peaked in august at <16 °c. baras et al. (1998) reported large yellow eels were most active at water temperatures above 16 °c and postulated that this might be as a consequence of increasing energetic expenditure. european eels are generally considered to become more active with increasing water temperature, and optimal growth rates in aquaculture are achieved at temperatures of 22–26 °c (tesch 2003). the increase in eel movements in september and october is most probably due to an increase in the number of tagged eels in the study area (see tagging dates), although the number of movements quickly declined in november reaching zero in december. autumn movements of eels are associated with searching for freshwater winter refuges or the seaward emigrations of silver eels (feunteun et al. 2003). however, we cannot be certain whether any eels in our study were silvering because our method did not provide information on the destination of marked eels once they had left the study area. diel periodicity of movements the timing of the movements of individual eels was signiﬁcantly correlated with the onset of night. the onset of activity at dusk has been reported in european (baras et al. 1998) and new zealand eels and has been related to feeding in european (tesch 2003) and new zealand eel spp. (sagar & glova 1998; glova & jellyman 2000). trapping studies have previously reported that yellow eels initiate upstream migrations during the hours of darkness (white & knights 1997). similarly, the activity of eels typically ceases before sunrise 1998). nocturnal move- ments ⁄ migrations in freshwater ﬁsh, such as those of (baras et al. 633 riley et al. atlantic salmon smolts, may be a predator avoidance tactic (riley et al. 2002). in the light of this, the strong similarity between the movement of individual eels in relation to sunset and salmon smolts migrating from the brandy stream in the spring (fig. 4) is particularly interesting. the results of this investigation have implications for the design of surveys of yellow eel populations and their habitat associations. a primary requirement of surveys for collecting time series data, or for a series of samples across a river basin, is that they are conducted under stable conditions. our ﬁndings suggest that such surveys should not be conducted during the spring and early summer, when eels may be moving between seasonal habitats. at this time of year, eels appear to be most active, possibly indicating redistributions, so capture here may tell managers little regarding local eel densities and habitat preferences. to provide information on yellow eel stock size and feeding and growth habitat preferences, managers should target sampling during august or early september, during daylight hours. note however that this will still likely only yield information on the daytime refuges of resident eels. the study of the habitat preferences of active resident eels (feeding, etc.) requires a method that provides remote measures of the microhabitat use of undisturbed eels throughout the 24-h period. portable, multipoint pit antennae have been deployed to collect such data on salmonids (riley et al. 2003, 2006, 2009), and their use in investigating eel behaviour is warranted. to this end, we have recently deployed such a system in the brandy stream to fig. 4. circular plot of the time of migration of individual atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) smolts (d) permanently leaving the brandy stream, in relation to sunset calculated for the day of each migration (2000–2006, excluding 2003). the line is the mean vector indicating the mean time of downstream movement for all 6 years pooled (±95% conﬁdence intervals). 634 examine the local habitat utilisation of those pit- tagged eels that remained in the study site.
