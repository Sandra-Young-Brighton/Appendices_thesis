1992; osborne & wiley 1992; copp et al. 1994; kelsch 1994; pusey et al. 1995; sheldon & meffe 1995; godinho et al. 1997a; godinho & ferreira 1998a). those species-environment relationships are not only fundamental aspects of community ecology but also the basis for developing manage- ment tools like indices of biotic integrity and habi- tat suitability indices (copp 1992). however, many studies utilize data from a single year precluding the analysis of the persistence of the environment- species associations observed. overall, few studies have addressed the relative importance of spatial and temporal components of variation in surveys of ﬁsh communities (matthews 1990; peterson & rabeni 1995). however, warmwater rivers are highly variable systems, not only within years but particularly between dry and wet years, and it would be of interest to evaluate the relative contri- bution of each source of variation (spatial and temporal) on ﬁsh communities. in the present study we used a data set from a variable southern iberian river, including surveys conducted both in a dry and wet year, to determine which environ- mental variables best accounted for the variability (temporal„spatial) in ﬁsh assemblage compo- sition. further, we partitioned the total variation in ﬁsh assemblage composition into independent components. 22 study area the basin of the river guadiana, the fourth largest in the iberian peninsula (67,000 km2), has been de- scribed elsewhere (godinho et al. 1997a, b). the study area, approximately the portuguese part of the basin, is characterized by a mediterranean cli- mate: the mean annual temperature is above 16(cid:190)c and the mean annual rainfall is 598 mm, with 80% falling between october and march (loureiro et al. 1986). besides the strong seasonal variation in ﬂow associated with rainfall typical of most iber- ian rivers, the lower guadiana presents a notable interannual variation in discharge, attaining a ratio of 57 to 1, whereas in tributaries this ratio may be larger than 200 to 1 (loureiro et al. 1986). in an average year surface ﬂow persists during summer in the main river but not so in many tribu- taries that become a series of discontinuous reaches. intermittency is often more pronounced the further upstream. although there are only 6 small reservoirs in portugal, the river is highly regulated in spain (48 reservoirs). in addition, a large dam (alqueva, 25,000 ha of inundated area at pool level) is presently under construction in this area. as it is typical of the iberian peninsula, this area has a native freshwater community poor in species but with a high proportion of endemic forms, mostly cyprinids, and several widespread exotic species (almac¸a 1986; elvira 1995; godinho et al. 1997a). material and methods two surveys of the lower guadiana ﬁsh com- munity were conducted between the middle of july and the beginning of august in 1994, and 1996. the year of 1994 culminated a succession of ex- tremely dry years, beginning in 1992 (total dis- charge for the period 1992–1994‰1.45(cid:192)109 m3). in contrast total discharge from january 1995 to august 1996 was 6.18(cid:192)109 m3 (claudia pinheiro, water institute, personal communication). twenty sites (100–200 m long) both in the main river (6) and tributary streams (14) were sampled in an up- stream direction with one electroﬁshing pass (by wading in shallow areas and from a boat in deeper parts) in both sampling years (table 1). the sites chosen for this study avoided river sources and the extensive brackish portion of the main river to pre- vent comparisons of vastly different sites (godin- ho et al. 1997a). after sampling, ﬁshes were iden- tiﬁed to species, measured (total length, tl, mm) and later allocated to size classes created based on major breaks on size-frequency histograms for each species. small barbus spp. ((cid:176)100 mm tl) variation in community composition table 1. site codes and names. for location of sites within the guadiana basin, see map on godinho et al.

variables were evaluated in each site: velocity (either present or absent because it was always low); maximum and average depth, maximum wetted width ((cid:176)10, 10– 20, 20–30, 30–50, –50 m), abundance of emergent and submerged macrophytes (estimated visually as being absent or presenting some ((cid:176)20), dense ((cid:176)50) or heavy (–50%) cover) and abundance of riparian vegetation (assessed visually as being ab- sent, or presenting some ((cid:176)20), dense ((cid:176)50) or heavy (–50%) bank cover). depth was measured in 25 to 55 random points with a graduated dip- net pole being converted to the following classes ((cid:176)0.2, 0.2–0.3, 0.3–0.5, 0.5–0.7, 0.7–1.0, 1.0–1.5, –1.5 m). the dominant substrate class (mud/silt (cid:176)0.05, sand 0.05–2, gravel 2–16, pebble 16–64, cobble 64–256, bedrock/boulder –256 mm) was es- timated in these same points around a circle with 0.5-m radius. two variables were derived from the substrate observations, the dominant (more fre- quent) substrate class (coarseness) and the number of different substrate classes (heterogeneity). in addition to local habitat variables and pres- ence of a nearby ((cid:176)20 km) reservoir (coded with the binary dummy variable reservoir), basin area, distance from source, altitude and gradient were obtained from 1:50,000 topographical maps. also, the location of a site in a tributary or in the main river was coded with the binary dummy vari- able river (ter braak 1987), whereas the binary dummy variable salt was used to identify sites located in tributaries discharging to the brackish 23 godinho et al. portion of the main river. the variable year coded sampling year. two matrices were initially developed for analy- sis: species size-classes, in catch per unit effort (cpue) (catch per 30 minutes), by sampling sites in each sampling year (25(cid:192)40), and explanatory (i.e. environmental„year) variables by sampling sites in each sampling year (17(cid:192)40). the cpue data were transformed by taking naperian logar- ithms [y¿‰ln (y„1)] to reduce the inﬂuence of spe- cies in extremely high abundance (ter braak 1987); rare species (occurring in less than three sites) were removed to prevent analysis distortion. the data matrices were submitted to canonical correspondence analysis (cca) using canoco (ter braak 1986; 1987), which is an eigenvalue ordi- nation speciﬁcally developed to relate multivariate ecological data matrices. this direct gradient analysis generates a diagram (biplot) that displays approximate values of the weighted averages of species (represented by points) with respect to the supplied explanatory variables (represented by ar- rows that roughly point in the factor direction of maximum variation) (ter braak & verdonschot 1995). from all the explanatory variables considered, the best predictors (those retained for analysis) were selected by a forward selection procedure available in canoco, a multivariate extension of the stepwise regression method, with a signiﬁcance cut-off point of 0.10 (magnan et al. 1994). next, the total variation in ﬁsh assemblage composition was partitioned into four components (borcard et al. 1992; magnan et al. 1994; rodriguez & mag- nan 1995). first, two new matrices were assembled from the ﬁrst explanatory matrix: environmental variables (the ones selected in the previous cca) by sampling sites in each sampling year (5(cid:192)40, ma- trix a), and the variable coding the sampling year (1(cid:192)40, matrix b). table 2. code, length interval (in mm) and cpue (mean”se, including

environmental variables (obtained from a cca relating the matrix of species size-classes cpue to matrix a), (2) variation accounted for by the sampling year (obtained from a cca relat- ing the matrix of species size-classes cpue to ma- trix b), (3) variation accounted for by the environ- mental variables after partialling out the inﬂuence of sampling year (obtained from a partial cca re- lating the matrix of species size-classes cpue to matrix a, after using matrix b as a covariable) (ter braak 1987), and (4) variation accounted for by the sampling year after partialling out the inﬂu- ence of environmental variables (obtained from a partial cca relating the matrix of species size- classes cpue to matrix b after using matrix a as a covariable). each component of variation was obtained by dividing the canonical eigenvalues of a particular cca (or partial cca) by the total inertia, i.e., the sum of all eigenvalues of a corre- spondence analysis of the species by sites in each sampling year matrix. the ‘‘pure’’ spatial/environ- mental variation (i.e. the spatial variation ac- counted for by the environmental variables) was given by step 3, whereas the ‘‘pure’’ temporal (an- nual) variation was given by step 4. the total ex- plained variation was obtained with the sum of 1 and 4 or 2 and 3, whereas the variation shared by both sampling year and environmental variables was obtained subtracting 3 from 1 or 4 from 2. for each cca and partial cca performed, a monte variation in community composition table 3. summary statistics for the canonical correspondence analysis

and the clupeid, alosa fallax, were collected in 1996. overall, high increases in cpue were detected from 1994 to 1996 in the smaller size-classes (mostly 0„ and 1„) of barbus spp. and chondrostoma willkommi, but the smaller size- classes of other species presented somewhat in- creased catches. as a major exception to this gen- fig. 1. axis one and two of the canonical correspondence analysis

(table 2). from the 17 variables initially considered for in- clusion in the cca, six were retained by the for- ward selection procedure (table 3, fig. 1). the composition of ﬁsh assemblages and explanatory variables were signiﬁcantly related (p(cid:176)0.01), as shown by a monte carlo simulation test with 100 permutations for both the ﬁrst axis eigenvalue and trace (ter braak 1987). another cca performed with presence/absence instead of cpue yielded similar patterns and is not presented here. as de- picted in the biplot, the ﬁsh community changed along the ﬁrst axis from assemblages characterized by the small-sized native cyprinids (l. pyrenaicus, t. alburnoides and c. willkommi) and the smaller size-classes of bigger cyprinids (i.e., barbus spp.) to assemblages characterised by the exotic centrarch- ids, c. facetum and the larger size classes of barbus spp. this separation was related to the dummy variable salt, site maximum depth and channel width. the high relative abundance of l. pyrena- icus, the exclusive presence of c. lemmingii, b. scla- teri and a. hispanica (all excluded from the cca due to their rarity), and the absence, or low abun- dance, of exotic centrarchids, the cichlid c. fa- cetum and g. holbrooki characterized the distinct salt sites. the second axis revealed a smaller gradient associated with altitude and substrate coarseness. sampling year was mostly associated with the third canonical axis (table 3, fig. 2 and 3). as seen on the biplot for the ﬁrst and third axis, most sampling sites shifted their position from 1994 to 1996 in association with changes in 26 the relative abundance of pertinent species size- classes. according to the partition performed, 39.3% of the total variation in ﬁsh assemblage composition was accounted for by the environmental variables (salt, maximum depth, maximum width, sub- strate coarseness and altitude) plus the sampling year, leaving 60.7% unexplained. selected environ- mental variables clearly accounted for the largest portion of the explained variation (‘‘pure spatial/ environmental variation’’‰34.9%, p(cid:176)0.01, monte carlo simulation test of both the ﬁrst axis eigen- value and trace). the pure temporal component of variation (4.1% of total variation) was much smaller but signiﬁcant (p(cid:176)0.01 for both the ﬁrst axis eigenvalue and the trace). the variation shared by both the environmental and temporal variables accounted for the remaining 0.3% of total variation. discussion changes in species numbers from 1994 to 1996 pronounced increases were de- tected in the smaller size classes of barbus and c. willkommi, but other species-size combinations such as t. alburnoides ((cid:176)50 mm tl) and l. pyr- enaicus ((cid:176)70 mm tl) also increased their cpue. an increase in numbers of the smaller sizes of spring-spawning cyprinids (and possibly recruit- ment) after transitions from dry to wet years has been described elsewhere (e.g. matthews 1986; bayley & li 1992), but not yet in iberia. these variations may have been the result of increased variation in community composition fig. 3. sample scores on the ﬁrst and third canonical axis. samples from 1994 are denoted by a superscript (e.g., 2¿ is the 1994 sample of site 2). for each particular site the sample from 1994 is connected with the correspondent 1996 sample, except for sample sites numbers 3, 7 and 6. spawning effort and/or the increased survival of eggs and young (matthews 1986), but the exact causes remain unknown. nevertheless, the species clearly increasing the numbers of their young (barbus spp. and c. willkommi) are known to spawn in lotic habitats (rodriguez & granado- lorencio 1992); the total amount or the accessi- bility of such habitat was likely increased by the discharge of 1995–1996. associations between species patterns and explanatory variables the assemblage patterns detected in the present study, namely the clear size-segregation in the larger sized barbus spp. and the exotic/native spe- cies separation, were similar to the ones obtained in another cca conducted only with the 1994 data (the present 20 sites plus 10 additional sites, godinho et al. 1997a), and parallel results from other studies (rinco´n et al. 1990; lobb & orth 1991; aadland 1993; sheldon & meffe 1995). from the total number of variables initially con- sidered, only 7 (6 environmental plus year) were selected by the forward selection procedure. salt was the main variable, strongly separating sites located in tributaries discharging into the brackish guadiana from other sites, closely followed by depth and width. although the exact reason for the importance of this variables is unknown, salt could be related to some important explanatory variable not measured (i.e. ignored) and thus rep- resent a powerful synthetic factor enclosing some of the measured (salt sites were among the shal- lower, narrower and with higher cover of emergent macrophytes) and not measured (e.g. discharge patterns, date of colonization by exotic species) ex- planatory descriptors. since salt has a clear geo- graphical component it also might have be inﬂu- enced by zoogeographical factors. nevertheless, though b. sclateri is reported only from salt tributaries (almac¸a 1986), the other native species encountered only in these tributaries during this study (c. lemmingii and a. hispanica) have been found elsewhere in the basin during the past (col- lares-pereira 1983). moreover, due to they rarity they did not enter the analysis. the other selected environmental variables: – depth, width, substrate heterogeneity and alti- tude – have been determined to be important cor- relates of ﬁsh assemblage structure elsewhere (lobb & orth 1991; aadland 1993; sheldon & meffe 1995). depth could be specially important in a mediterranean basin, since deeper sites may provide safer refuge against summer drying. this small group of environmental variables, particularly depth and width, has provided satis- factory templates for the distribution of species and size-classes in other studies (meffe & sheldon 1988; sheldon & meffe 1995). note that this selec- tion of variables as main explanatory factors in the forward selection does not mean that the other variables initially considered were not important correlates of assemblage structure. the forward- selection procedure aims at selecting a minimal set of explanatory variables that explain the total vari- ability in species composition about as well as the full set (ter braak 1991). variables enter the analy- 27 godinho et al. sis by decreasing additional explanatory power (ter braak 1991; ter braak & verdonschot 1995), and consequently some variables that can be signiﬁ- cantly related in isolation to species composition lose their additional explanatory capacity once correlated variables are added to the model (ter braak 1991). in the present study, depth and width were strongly related (r–0.67) to other environ- mental variables (river, distance from source and basin area) and thus could have acted as their partial surrogates. altogether differences in the habitat (i.e., site) used by the several species-size combinations we found might have come about due to different abilities to cope with conditions of abiotic stress, differential predation risk and/or competition (tramer 1977; angermeier & karr 1984; meffe 1984; castleberry & cech 1986, power 1987; bain et al. 1988; schlosser 1988). for further discussion on this interpretation, see godinho et al. (1997a, b); and godinho & ferreira (1998a). variation partitioning both environmental and temporal variables were signiﬁcant correlates of assemblage composition in the lower guadiana river. however, the spatial variation (accounted for by the selected environ- mental variables) was much higher than the tem- poral (annual) variation. this results support some studies (matthews 1990; peterson & rabeni 1995), but not others (frenzel & swanson 1996). though the dry period of 1992–1994 was rather harsh, the following wet years have been far from historical maximum values (14(cid:192)109 m3/year). it is possibly that much wetter years (though increasingly buf- fered by strong upstream damming) may provide bigger changes in community composition. never- theless the 1994–1996 interannual variability was signiﬁcant. surveys conducted in different hy- drological conditions and partitioned according to the present analytical procedures may allow a better understanding on the inﬂuence of dissimilar hydrological years upon ﬁsh assemblage structure. almost no variation in assemblage composition was simultaneously accounted for by the environ- mental and temporal variables. in fact, this low value suggests that between year changes in assem- blage structure and environmental conditions were similar over all the study area (i.e., largely indepen- dent of the spatial differences in environmental characteristics). the explanatory variables together explained 39.3% of the total variability but left a fairly high portion unexplained. however, the analytical methods used herein cannot discriminate between potentially explainable variation and true stochas- 28 tic variation (borcard et al. 1992). moreover, fac- tors that may be important structuring stream ﬁsh assemblages, such as invertebrate food abundance and the presence of terrestrial predators were not measured, and they could have accounted for some of the unexplained variation. nevertheless, the total variation explained in this study is within values reported in other multivariate studies relat- ing different ecological descriptors to explanatory variables (borcard et al. 1992; magnan et al. 1994; ter braak & verdonschot 1995; poizat & pont 1996; godinho et al. 1997a, b; godinho & ferreira 1998b). resumen 1. hemos determinado los factores asociados con la variacio´n espacial y temporal de
