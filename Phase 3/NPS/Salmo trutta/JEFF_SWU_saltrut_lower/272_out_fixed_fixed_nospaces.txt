(1993). stock density indices have been applied most commonly to electroﬁshing catch data for largemouth bass and bluegill, lepomis macrochirus (raﬁnesque) (e.g., carline et al. 1984; gablehouse 1984; guy & willis 1990). willis et al. (1985) applied stock- density-indices to walleye, sander vitreus (mitchill), white bass, morone chrysops (raﬁnesque) and gizzard shad, dorosoma cepedianum (lesueur) which were sampled by gill netting. although psd and rsd calculations are frequently used in north america, they are rarely employed in europe. gassner & wanzenbo¨ck (in press) adapted the rsd calculation for the assessment of length-fre- quency data of whiteﬁsh (coregonus sp.) populations in two austrian lakes. a ﬁrst attempt of an adapted index for arctic charr populations has been recently published for one austrian lake (rinnerthaler et al. 2004). godinho & ferreia (1996) discussed the utility of length-frequency indices to describe the status of iberian centrarchid populations. for austrian lakes, arctic charr, s. alpinus (l.) is regarded as a sentinel species of the so-called charr- lakes (gassner et al. 2005) and it is one of the most important angling and commercially used ﬁsh species. unfortunately, many austrian arctic charr populations have been subject to signiﬁcant impact over recent decades (zick et al. 2006). they have undergone changes in size structure because of overﬁshing or population size structure indices changes in the population size because of habitat changes and ﬁsheries mismanagement. in lake irrsee, for example, the arctic charr population has become extinct because of eutrophication (schwarz et al. 1995). to monitor the actual state of the ﬁsh species it would be useful to have a solid numerical descriptor of the population structure. one aim of the study was to test the traditional north american approaches of anderson (1976) and gablehouse (1984) for their applicability to arctic charr populations in prealpine and alpine austrian lakes. to do this, the psd and rsd index systems were adapted for alpine landlocked arctic charr populations, and a different approach for psd and rsd index calculation based on biological (population speciﬁc) parameters was examined. study area eight sites were included in this study. these were the prealpine lakes mondsee, grundlsee and langbathsee, situated in the ‘salzkammergut’ lake district of austria and ﬁve small alpine high mountain lakes (oberer-, mittlerer-, unterer landschitzsee, lungauer klaffer- see, zwerfenbergsee) of salzburg (fig. 1). important physical and limnological data for these sites are presented in table 1. mondsee is subject to a commercial ﬁshery. of 18 commercial ﬁshery rights, eight are still in part-time use today. the lake is also used for angling and the average number of season licences varies around 330. until 1957, arctic charr was the most important commercially caught ﬁsh species (yearly harvest: )1). throughout the 1960s and 1970s about 3.5 kgæha catches declined dramatically because of eutrophic- ation and the resulting oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. since 1977, harvest of arctic charr has been forbidden. grundlsee langbathsee mondsee high mountain lakes fig. 1. study site: mondsee, grundlsee, langbathsee and ﬁve high mountain lakes (austria). 55 zick et al. table 1. morphological and limnological data of mondsee, grundlsee, langbathsee and the mountain lakes (oberer- mittlerer-, unterer-landschitzsee, zwerfenbergsee and lungauer klaffersee). categories mondsee langbathsee mountain lakes grundlsee 664 64 170 0.92 709 33 5.5 0.87 oligo-mesotrophic (pmean: 8.5 mgæm )3) 5.9 m oligotrophic (pmean: 2.6 mgæm )3) 9.6 m oligotrophic (pmean: 4.5 mgæm )3) 8.8 m altitude (m) maximal depth (m) volume (mæm3) retention time (a) trophic level mean secchi-depth 481 68.5 510 1.7 1778–2197 13–33 unknown unknown oligotrophic )3) (pmean: 5 mgæm 10.3 m table 2. date of ﬁshing and sampling effort of the four study sites. parameter mondsee grundlsee langbathsee mountain lakes date of ﬁshing 22.10.2001 23.10.2001 24.10.2001 06.11.2001 07.11.2001 all in all net nights (nn) 50 nn: bottom sets 18.09.2001 24.09.2001 11.10.2001 16.09.2002 20.09.2002 09.09.2003–11.09.2003 15.09.2003–19.09.2003 2001: 24 nn: bottom sets 7 nn: pelagic sets 2002: 11 nn: bottom sets 11 nn: pelagic sets 2003: sampling according to cen/tc 230. 62 nn: bottom sets 28 nn: pelagic sets 26.06.2001 27.08.2001 01.10.2001 sampling according to cen/tc 230: 15 nn: bottom sets 12 nn: pelagic sets ols: 22.07.2001 mls: 22.07.2001 uls: 23.07.2001 lks: 22.07.2002 zbs: 23.07.2002 3 nn: bottom sets (per lake) ols, oberer landschitzsee;

length 42 m, height 1.5 m and pelagic sets: lundgren ‘nordic pelagic’). in 2003, in langbathsee and grundlsee, sampling was performed according to the standardised system for sampling of ﬁsh with multi-mesh gill nets (cen/tc230). in 2001 and 2002, in mondsee and grundlsee the nets were set near the spawning sites of arctic charr and in the mountain lakes, nets were set randomly. sampling time was short in the mountain lakes, but as the lakes were very similar, data were pooled for the ﬁve mountain lakes to increase sample size. sampling data are summarised in table 2. all ﬁsh caught were determined to species, counted, weighted and measured (total length in cm). sex and stage of maturity of arctic charr were determined according to nikolsky (in: ricker 1971). for age determination, the otoliths (sagittae) were ground with sandpaper and embedded on glass slides in araldite cy 212. after drying (24 h/100 °c) the otoliths were projected via a light microscope (40-fold magniﬁca- tion) on to a tv screen. without information of length or weight, three independent readers evaluated the age of each ﬁsh three to ﬁve times. the most frequent age value was used for further calculations. analyses the catch per unit effort (cpue) was expressed as ﬁsh per net and night (12 h). for the estimation of the length at ﬁrst maturity, a relationship between length and percentage of mature arctic charr was calculated by the sigmoid equation: fðyþ ¼ a 1 þ e ðx x0þ=b (x ¼ total b ¼ coefﬁcient) length (cm), x0 ¼ center, a ¼ amplitude, based on age and length data growth was calculated with the standard model of von bertalanffy: l ¼ l1ð1   e kðt t0þþ (l¥ ¼ asymptotic size, k ¼ deﬁnes the rate at which the curve approaches the asymptote, t ¼ size of the ﬁsh (total length), t0 ¼ hypothetical time at which the size of the ﬁsh is zero) to assess the population structures two different approaches, ‘standard’ (or so called ‘traditional’) and ‘lake speciﬁc’ were used. the calculations of both indices were deﬁned as: psd ¼ number of fish  minimum quality length number of fish  minimum stock length  100 rsd ¼ number of fish  specified 1 number of fish  minimum stock length  100 (psd ¼ proportional)stock-density-index, rsd ¼ relative)stock-density-index, 1speciﬁed lengths are the length categories ‘quality’, ‘preferred’, ‘memorable’ and ‘trophy’) population size structure indices for traditionally lengths classes the different categories are deﬁned as percentage lengths of the all-tackle world-record ﬁsh. to select, for example, the minimum stock lengths, a length range equiv- alent of 20–26% of the world-record lengths has been chosen (anderson & weithman 1978; gable- house 1984). according to gablehouse (1984) the all-tackle world-record length for arctic charr is 101 cm. the maximum length of arctic charr in the alpine study region has been described between 60 and 75 cm (spindler 1997; gerstmeier & romig 1998). for the calculation of the length classes here, a more realistic maximal length of 65 cm was chosen (rinnerthaler et al. 2004). the percentage classiﬁcation for each category was taken according to gablehouse (1984) and calculated based on the maximal length of alpine arctic charr populations. in contrast to the traditional approach, where the minimum lengths of the categories were used for index calculation, we used the arithmetic mean of each lengths class (table 3). thus the adapted psd and rsd for landlocked arctic charr in this study were calculated based on a maximum length of 65 cm and a minimum threshold of the arithmetic mean for each of the ﬁve categories (see also table 3). the lake speciﬁc approach is a modiﬁcation of the psd and rsd system to account for population speciﬁc conditions for austrian arctic charr popula- tions. according to gassner et al. (2003) for each population two speciﬁc thresholds were deﬁned: • l¥ of the von bertalanffy growth equation • the total length where 75% of ﬁsh are mature deﬁned as follows (gassner et al. 2003): length at which approximately based on these thresholds the length classes were 1 stock ¼ quality – ((trophy ) quality)/3) 2 quality ¼ total 75% of arctic charr are mature 3 preferred ¼ quality + ((trophy ) quality)/3) 4 memorable ¼ quality + (((trophy ) quality)/ 3) · 2) 5 trophy ¼ l¥ of equation + 20% the von bertalanffy growth table 3. traditional approach: classiﬁcation of the length classes for index calculations (gablehouse 1984; rinnerthaler et al. 2004). category stock quality preferred memorable trophy % of the maximal length [gablehouse (1984)] 20–26 36–41 45–55 59–64 74–80 length classes for arctic charr based on the world-record length of 101 cm 20.3–26.2 cm 36.3–41.4 cm 43.0–55.6 cm 59.4–64.5 cm 74.7–80.8 cm length classes for landlocked arctic charr based on 65 cm maximum length 13.0–16.9 cm 23.4–26.9 cm 29.0–35.7 cm 38.3–41.6 cm 48.1–52.0 cm minimum thresholds for the index calculation (mean of the length classes) 15.0 cm 25.2 cm 32.4 cm 40.0 cm 50.1 cm 57 zick et al. willis et al. (1993) gave a list of generally accepted stock-density-index ranges for balanced ﬁsh popula- tions. as no values for arctic charr were available, we used the index ranges for a balanced population of largemouth bass (gablehouse 1984) and added, according to rinnerthaler et al. (2004), the index range for trophy-length of austrian arctic charr populations. results length (27.5–28.4 cm) in mondsee a total of 150 arctic charr were caught. this represented a cpue of 2.3 (ﬁsh per net per night). the most abundant length group was 28 cm total in mondsee (fig. 2). there were few small ﬁsh, only 11 individuals were £15 cm (7.3%). the calculated relationship between length and maturity (fig. 3) indicated that almost all arctic charr (male and female) became mature before reaching a total length of 20 cm. the calculated l¥ was 36.82 cm (table 4), which ﬁtted well with the maximal observed length of 37 cm. during the three sampling years a total number of (2001: n ¼ 86; 2002: n ¼ 90; 247 arctic charr 2003: n ¼ 71) were caught in grundlsee. this represented a cpue of 6.4 (2001), 2.9 (2002) and 5.1 (2003) for the bottom sets and 3.5 (2001), 8.3 (2002) and 3.7 (2003) for the pelagic sets. the most abundant length classes were 28 and 29 cm (fig. 2). especially in 2001 and 2003 there were a lot of small ﬁsh (£15 cm: 2001 ¼ 24.4%; 2002 ¼ 12.2%; 2003 ¼ 25.4%). the calculated relationship between length and maturity showed that most arctic charr were mature before reaching a total length of 28.7 cm (fig. 3), the males spawning at a length of about 20 cm and the females at a length of about 26 cm. the calculated l¥ was 32.50 cm (table 4, fig. 4), which was slightly less than the maximal observed length of 34.4 cm. in langbathsee a total of 55 arctic charr were caught. the cpue was 8.5 for the bottom sets and 3.2 for the pelagic sets. the most abundant length class of arctic charr was 26 cm and there were almost no small ﬁsh (fig. 2). only one individual was £15 cm (1.8%). arctic charr did not become mature simulta- neously, some started spawning at a total length of 22 cm and others were still immature at a length of more than 30 cm. the calculated relationship between length and maturity indicated that most arctic charr ﬁnally became mature at a total length of 34 cm (fig. 3). the calculated l¥ was 34.50 cm and the maximal observed length was 38 cm (table 4). in all, but one of the ﬁve mountain lakes arctic charr was the only ﬁsh species occurring there. in unterer langbathsee brown_trout, salmo_trutta f. vario (l.), minnow, phoxinus phoxinus (l.) and bullhead, cottus gobio (l.) also occurred. a total of 80 arctic 58 charr were caught, 76 of which were blackriders (<16 cm, fig. 2) and 4 were wildcaught charr (min: 18.8 cm; max: 55.3 cm). the mean cpue was 6.6 (min: 4.5; max: 8.0). because of the low number of wildcaught charr, the relationship between length and maturity and the von bertalanffy growth were calcu- lated only for the blackriders (fig. 4). at a length of 10.2 cm most of them were already mature (fig. 3). calculated l¥ was 14.53 cm, which ﬁtted well with the observed maximal length of 15.9 cm (table 4). the calculation of the traditional stock-density- indices resulted in values between 0 and 68 (table 5). with the exception of the mountain lakes, psd and rsd-quality were similar for the other lakes and the values were within the thresholds for a balanced situation according to gablehouse and rinnerthaler et al. (2004). rsd-preferred was too low in mondsee and grundlsee (2001, 2002) and balanced in langbathsee and grundlsee (2003). rsd- memorable and rsd-trophy indicated that there were no big ﬁsh in these lakes. for the mountain lakes, stock-density-indices were calculated only for the blackriders (<16 cm), which resulted in a value of 0 for all categories. (1984) traditional compared with the the lake speciﬁc approach produced different results approach (table 6). the high psd and rsd-preferred for mondsee indicated that many ﬁsh were in the ‘pre- ferred’ length and some reached ‘memorable’ length. following the deﬁned ranges of a balanced population (gablehouse 1984; rinnerthaler et al. 2004) the psd and rsd values indicated a well structured situation in grundlsee for all investigated years. in langbathsee ﬁsh reached maturity in very different age classes and the length class where 75% of ﬁsh were mature was near l¥. it was difﬁcult to calculate reasonable lake speciﬁc indices, however, psd was beyond the target values. for the mountain lakes psd and rsd referred to the high number of ‘big ﬁsh’, as a length of 15 cm is in fact a ‘memorable’ length for blackriders. discussion length-frequency indices, which are mostly applied to north american lake ﬁsh populations (anderson 1976; gablehouse 1984), enable a numeric estimation of length-frequency data and are appropriate numerical estimators for deviations from natural size structures in ﬁsh populations. in contrast to different applicable statistical methods for testing the present size structure against a theoretical size structure, such indices are commonly applied and they give results, which are easy to communicate to ﬁshery manager (gassner et al. 2003). north american psd and rsd indices are based on the all-tackle world-record lengths (anderson & weithman 1978; gablehouse 1984). as ) n ( h s i f f o r e b m u n 25 20 15 10 5 0 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 fig. 2. length-frequency distributions of the (cm four classes). charr populations arctic mondsee n = 150 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 grundlsee 2002 n = 90 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 langbathsee n = 55 population size structure indices grundlsee 2001 n = 86 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 grundlsee 2003 n = 71 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 mountain lakes fish < 16 cm n = 76 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 5 length (cm) 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 the published length classes would not work for landlocked forms, here they had to be adapted to regional conditions. the traditional classiﬁcation of the length classes (% of the world record length) was taken from gablehouse (1984) and calculated for landlocked austrian arctic charr populations based on the regional maximum length of 65 cm. this resulted in a minimum stock length of 13.0 cm, which seemed to be too small, as according to gablehouse (1984) minimum stock length is often the size at or near which ﬁsh reach maturity. therefore we used the arithmetical mean of the particular length classes as minimum threshold for the further index calculation. a problem is the deﬁnition of the target values for balanced populations. generally accepted objective ranges for stock-density-index values have been devel- oped for ﬁsheries managers wishing to maintain or create a balanced ﬁsh population. a balanced ﬁsh population is one that is intermediate between the extremes of a large number of small ﬁsh and a small number of large ﬁsh and indicates that the rates of recruitment, growth, and mortality may be satisfactory (anderson & weithman 1978). in general, large ﬁsh are more easily captured than small ﬁsh in gill nets (willis et al. 1985;

(2004) showed similar results. it will be necessary to compile a better ﬁtting maximum length for austrian lakes as soon as there are more data available. bonar (2002) developed a system to compare the length frequencies of ﬁsh from a partic- ular water body with an average developed for a population size structure indices certain region. until now there are not enough data available to create a similar approach for austrian arctic charr populations, but this would be desirable for the future. as arctic charr is known as an extraordinarily variable ﬁsh species, displaying a wide range of maximal sizes (johnson 1980; klemetsen et al. 2003) it is rather difﬁcult to deﬁne a universal maximum length for all austrian landlocked populations. to get a more precise system for the assessment of arctic charr population structures, a lake speciﬁc approach was developed. thereby, the biological criteria were used for the calculation of ﬁve length classes. generally, the mean length at which ﬁsh of a given population become mature for the ﬁrst time is an important biological parameter for the management (jennings et al. 1998). froese & binohlan (2000) observed that the age at ﬁrst maturity is foremost a function of size. deﬁning the two thresholds, ‘length where 75% of ﬁsh are mature’ and ‘maximum size’ (¼ l¥), speciﬁc length classes for psd and rsd calculation can be ﬁxed separately for each arctic charr population. this seems to be useful for an extremely variable ﬁsh species like arctic charr. actually the lake speciﬁc system reﬂects the popula- tion structure of the study lakes well. the index indicated for the underﬁshed populations of mondsee and the mountain lakes, higher values in the preferred and memorable length categories. lakes which were used by commercial ﬁsheries and by anglers like grundlsee and langbathsee, showed lower values in these categories reﬂecting the ﬁshing pressure. trophy ﬁsh are generally rare in the lakes in this study and therefore the capture probability is low. the lack of table 5. traditional approach: indices for austrian lakes. length-frequency four arctic charr populations in speciﬁc table 6. lake length- frequency indices for four arctic char populations in austrian lakes. approach: grundlsee category mondsee 2001 2002 2003 langbathsee psd rsd-quality rsd-preferred rsd-memorable rsd-trophy 66 66 4 0 0 68 68 5 0 0 52 52 5 0 0 54 54 11 0 0 64 64 15 0 0 mountain lakes target -value* 0 0 0 0 0 40–70 40–70 10–40 0–10 0–2 psd, proportional-stock-density-indices; rsd, relative-stock-density-indices. *target-values for a balanced population according to gablehouse (1984) and rinnerthaler et al.

populations and reveals e.g., the poor condition of the charr population in langbathsee. the traditional approach indicated here a balanced popu- lation structure, whereas the lake speciﬁc approach showed a low psd referring to the shortage of juvenile arctic charr. the moderately ﬁshed population of grundlsee showed a balanced size structure according to gablehouse (1984) and in fact it seems to be the most balanced one of the four arctic charr populations investigated. it is not easy to deﬁne a ‘good’ size structure of an exploited ﬁsh population, nevertheless the size ranges given by gablehouse (1984) appear to work quite well. generally the ﬁrst test of the adapted stock-density- indices showed that psd and rsd are useful methods of length-frequency data analysis of arctic charr populations in austria. an important task for the future will be to increase the investigations and to reﬁne the modiﬁed approaches. references anderson, r.o. 1976. management of small warm water
