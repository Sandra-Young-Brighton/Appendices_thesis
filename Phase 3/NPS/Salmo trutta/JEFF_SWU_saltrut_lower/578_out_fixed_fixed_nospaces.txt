(2005) found that 0+ salmon parr were absent from seven streams, present at the mouth of 11 streams, and present within only two streams, both of which were probably spawning streams. in contrast, older parr migrated upstream into most streams and their highest densities were usually found in streams ﬂowing directly into the spawning habitat in the three largest tributaries of the tana or the river itself. juvenile salmon were sparse or absent in streams ﬂowing into the smallest tributaries. these differences in salmon density were related to environmental variables. twelve environmental vari- ables were measured: stream width and depth, water velocity, four categories of substratum size, moss cover, instream cover, overhanging cover, ph and conductivity. as some of these variables were corre- lated, principal component analysis was used to identify the major variables and was followed by multiple regression, using a ridge regression analysis doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00107.x 331 johansen et al. to remedy the potential problems caused by colinear- ity. a more detailed account of these methods is given in johansen et al. (2005). four variables (stream width, overhanging cover, water velocity, ph) were signiﬁcant enough to be included in a multiple regression model that explained 65% of the variation in salmon parr density across 80 sites in the 20 streams. parr density was related positively to stream width and the amount of overhanging cover, and negatively to water velocity and ph. therefore, 35% of the variation in parr density was due to other factors. the ﬁsh community in all streams consisted almost exclusively of salmon and brown_trout, salmo_trutta l., with negligible numbers of other species (johansen et al. 2005). it was possible that trout density could have affected salmon density, but no signiﬁcant it was therefore concluded that trout density was not respon- sible for even part of the remaining 35% of the variation in salmon density. one important factor not included in these earlier analyses was the density of invertebrates that provided potential the juvenile salmon. therefore, the main objective of the present study was to relate the differences in the density of juvenile salmon to the density of inverte- brates providing their food. relationships could be found. food for feeding is the predominant method of there are two different feeding regimes available for stream-dwelling ﬁsh: invertebrate benthos and drift (invertebrates drifting downstream on the water surface and in the water column). fish can be chieﬂy benthic feeders, or benthic and drift feeders that take prey on the bottom, in the water column and at the water surface (waters 1972). juvenile salmon are opportunistic feeders, with some studies reporting that drift food acquisition (wankowski & thorpe 1979), whilst others note that benthic feeding is also frequently used (keenleyside & yamamoto 1962; vignes 1999). salmon parr feed relatively more from the benthos than brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) (thomas 1962), and it has been proposed that juvenile brown_trout are more capable of maintaining position in the water current than juvenile salmon (shurov & shustov 1989). brown_trout are also more aggressive than salmon (heggenes et al. 1995, 1999). the riparian zone is an important part of the stream landscape, affecting both the stability and productivity of a stream. streamside forests affect food quality and quantity for macroinvertebrates directly through inputs of particulate food (leaf litter, soils, wood, etc.) and indirectly by affecting the structure and productivity of the microbial food web through shading and modifying the levels of dissolved organic carbon and nutrients (hynes 1975; de´camps 1996). presence of overhanging riparian vegetation is also important for the amount of terrestrial invertebrates (algae, bacteria) 332 falling into the stream (wipﬂi 1997; kawaguchi & nakano 2001; allan et al. 2003). the present study therefore examines the relationships between salmon density and invertebrate density in the benthos and drift, and evaluates the effects of riparian vegetation. methods study area the present study was carried out in the large subarctic river tana (teno in finnish) on the border between norway and finland (fig. 1). catchment area is 16 386 km2. the tana supports the largest ﬁshery of atlantic salmon in europe, with mean annual catches of 200 metric tonnes in the river and 200 metric tonnes in the sea outside the river outlet (moen 1991). in addition to the main river, there are over 30 tributaries with distinct spawning stocks of salmon (moen 1991). at least 100 ﬁrst, second and third order tributaries are known in which adult salmon do not spawn but from the main stems (erkinaro 1997). juveniles enter samples were taken in 13 second, third and fourth order streams ﬂowing either into the main tana river or into major tributaries of the tana. four different categories of riparian vegetation are found in the tana catchment: (a) willow (salix spp.), (b) birch (betula pubescens ehrhart), (c) a mixture of birch and pine (pinus sylvestris l.) and (d) nonforested alpine. the streams chosen for sampling were three in category a, ﬁve in b, three in c and two in d so that they were distributed in two groups, one in a downstream section up to about 100 m from the river mouth and the other in an upstream section about 200 m from the mouth (fig. 1, table 1). the sampling design was the same as that used in the previous study (johansen et al. 2005). there were four sampling sites in each stream, one at the stream mouth where it joined the main river, and three within the stream, so that there was a total of 52 sampling sites. the sample at the stream mouth enabled comparisons to be made between densities of both ﬁsh and benthos within the stream and immedi- ately outside the stream at its mouth. the distances between the three sites within the stream increased with the length of the stream and are provided in the previous study. the sites were sampled for ﬁsh and benthos in august and october 2000, 2001 and 2002. johansen et al. (2005) describe the environmental characteristics of the streams in detail. sampling the ﬁsh samples were the same as those used in the previous study (johansen et al. 2005). juvenile ﬁsh were caught

v; geomega as, trondheim, norway). the anode was a wand-mounted ring; the copper wire cathode lay on the stream bottom. a low voltage was used (300 v), thus reducing the effects of positive galvanotaxis (heggenes et al. 1990). the sampling sites were ﬁshed once in an upstream direction, each site being combed carefully with 2-m anode strokes in a downstream direction after which 0.5 m sideways steps were taken. the sampling effort was thus standardised so that it was similar at each site. the sampling area at each site was usually 100 m2, but in a few cases a slightly larger area of 120 or 140 or 160 m2 (only once) was used (table 2). all ﬁsh densities were expressed as num- bers per 100 m2. most sites were only accessible by walking for several hours on foot. block nets are commonly used in electroﬁshing studies, but because of the difﬁcult logistics of the present study, electro- ﬁshing was carried out without block nets. recent studies have also indicated that block nets are often unnecessary (bohlin et al. 1989). all the ﬁsh were returned to the site alive after measuring length to the nearest millimetre. the ﬁsh were divided into approxi- mate age classes on the basis of their length distribu- tions in the pooled samples from august and october (johansen et al. 2005). five benthos samples from each site were collected using a hess-waters sampler (waters & knapp 1961), which samples a bottom area of 0.089 m2. mesh size of the sampler was 390 lm. the sampler was pushed into the substratum with the collecting bag facing downstream. the substratum inside the cylinder was then disturbed, while larger stones were handpicked and wiped clean. the current carried the invertebrates into the collecting bag. the samples were spaced out randomly in each site. benthic densities were expressed as numbers per m2 (with se). drifting organisms were sampled in eight streams in august and october 2003 (table 1), using ﬂoating drift nets with a mesh size of 430 lm

site. each net sampled the water column from the surface down to a depth of 6 cm. total submerged area was 288 cm2. the nets sampled for 1 h every 3 h throughout one day and one night. at the beginning and end of each 1 h sample, a miniature current meter was used to measure water velocity at the middle of the net mouth. the volume of water ﬁltered was estimated from the product of the submerged area, current velocity and duration of sampling. flow through the nets was used to calculate drift density as the number of drifting invertebrates per 100 m3 sampled (elliott 1970; allan & russek 1985). both benthos and drift samples were preserved in 70% ethanol and later sorted in the laboratory at 6· magniﬁcation. all invertebrates were handpicked, identiﬁed and counted. statistical analysis to relate salmon density to environmental variables and benthic densities, a multiple regression analysis was performed with salmon density as the dependent variable and the remaining factors as the independent variables. in choosing the best model, a procedure using all possible regressions was employed. this requires ﬁtting of every possible regression equation associated with each possible combination of k independent variables. the statistic mallow’s cp was used as the main criterion in selecting the best subset of independent variables, and a ridge regression analysis was performed to remedy the potential problems caused by colinearity (neter et al. 1989). ridge regression involves the arbitrary selection of a ridge constant cr which controls the extent to which ridge estimates differ from least squares estimates. a ridge trace procedure was used to select cr. with this method, parameter estimates were computed for several values of cr. values for mallow’s cp were calculated for each cr, and the value of cr correspond- ing to the minimum value of cp was selected. results benthos and ﬁsh density electroﬁshing showed that, with the exception of stream c1, 0+ fry were found only at the stream mouth sites (table 2). therefore, in the following analyses, the density of 0+ fry was related only to benthic density at the stream mouth, while density of 1+ and older parr was related to a suite of environmental factors in addition to benthic density both in the stream and at the stream mouth. the mean density (±se) per m2 for the total benthos the 13 sampled streams was within each of 4520 ± 371 in august and 5025 ± 471 in october (tables 3 and 4). there was no signiﬁcant difference in benthic density between streams ﬂowing into the main tana river, into large-sized tributaries and into small-sized tributaries (single-factor anova, august: f ¼ 0.69; october: f ¼ 0.49, both p > 0.05). there- fore, there were only small, non-signiﬁcant differences in benthic density between streams with and without juvenile salmon, the latter being a1, b1 and b7 (table 2). tributaries (b7, c1, c3, c4) mean benthic density at the stream mouth was low for streams ﬂowing into the main tana river (a2, a4, b2, b3, b4) (august: 538 ± 128 per m2, october: 511 ± 75), slightly higher for streams entering large- sized (august: 1698 ± 393 per m2, october: 1716 ± 243), and high- est for streams entering small-sized tributaries (a1, b1, d1, d2) (august: 3065 ± 260 per m2, october: 2526 ± 596) (tables 3 and 4). the latter densities were often comparable with benthic density within the streams. the difference between benthic densities at stream mouth sites from streams ﬂowing into the main tana river, into large-sized tributaries and into small-sized tributaries was statistically signiﬁcant (single-factor anova, august: f ¼ 23.67, p < 0.001; october: f ¼ 9.13, p < 0.01). regression equations relating benthic and salmon densities at the stream mouth in both august and october were not signiﬁcant for 0+ fry, or for 1+ and older parr (p > 0.05; n ¼ 13). however, the regres- sion of the density of 1+ and older parr within the streams on benthic density at the stream mouth was signiﬁcant, and r2 values indicated that the negative relationship explained 39% of the variation in parr density within streams in august and 29% in october (both p < 0.05, n ¼ 13). found only in very low densities, therefore, all streams with a high density of juvenile salmon had low benthic densities at the stream mouth in both august and october (a2, a4, b4, c1, c3 in fig. 2a,b). juvenile salmon were not found, or in streams where the benthic density at the stream mouth was as high or higher than that in the stream (a1, b1, b7, c4, d1, d2 in fig. 2b, c). juvenile salmon at high and low densities occurred over a wider range of benthos densities within streams (fig. 2d,e,f). twelve environmental factors (see introduction) together with benthic density, both at the mouth and in the streams, were included in a regression ana- lysis. five variables emerged as signiﬁcant enough to be included in the following multiple regression models that explained 90% of the variation in salmon parr density in august (r2 ¼ 0.90, p < 0.01, n ¼ 13) and 67% in october (r2 ¼ 0.67, p < 0.05, n ¼ 13): juvenile salmon, benthos and invertebrate drift parr density ¼ a þ b1  benthosstream   b2  benthosmouth þ b3  moss cover   b4  water velocity   b5  ph ð1þ where estimates (±se) of the parameters a, b1, b2, b3, b4 and b5 are given in table 5 together with the partial correlation coefﬁcients for b1–b5. therefore, parr density was related positively to benthic density in streams and the proportion of moss cover on the substratum (for assessment methodo- logy, see johansen et al. 2005), and negatively to benthic density at the stream mouth, water velocity and ph. drift and ﬁsh density for total drift density varied mean values (±se) (table 6). benthic considerably between streams density and drift density of aquatic invertebrates for the eight streams correlated positively, although they were estimated in different years (august: r ¼ 0.73; october: r ¼ 0.78). therefore, streams with high benthic densities also had high drift densities. there were some signiﬁcant differences in drift of aquatic invertebrates between vegetation categories. highest densities were found in streams a1 and c1 in august and october (table 6). the difference between densities in categories a and c was not signiﬁcant (t ¼ 0.85, p > 0.05), and densities in a and c were than b and d (p < 0.001). signiﬁcantly higher therefore, the highest densities of aquatic inverte- brates in the drift were found in streams with dense riparian vegetation, either chieﬂy willow (category a) or a mixture of birch and pine (c). a regression between drift density of aquatic invertebrates and the amount of overhanging cover for the eight streams was not signiﬁcant (both p > 0.05; n ¼ 8). therefore, overhanging cover did inﬂuence the number of benthic invertebrates not entering the drift. in august or october the highest densities of terrestrial invertebrates in august and october were found in the streams with dense riparian vegetation (category a in table 6). category a had a signiﬁcantly higher density than categories b, c and d (all p < 0.001). b and c were also signiﬁcantly higher than d (all p < 0.001). a regression between drift density of terrestrial inverte- brates and the amount of overhanging cover was positive and explained 93% of the variation in drift in august and 65% in october (both p < 0.05; n ¼ 8). terrestrial invertebrates were found in much lower densities in october (table 6). category a was signiﬁcantly higher than b, c and d (all p < 0.001). the differences in drift density of terrestrial inverte- brates for the other three vegetation categories were 335 johansen et al. table 3. benthic densities per m2 (mean values ± se) of

overhanging cover had a strong inﬂuence on the number of terrestrial invertebrates entering the drift. of the eight drift-sampled streams, juvenile salmon were found in high densities in four (a2, b4, c1, c3), low densities in three (b3, d1, d2) and not found in one (a1) (fig. 3). all four streams with high salmon density were streams with a corresponding high benthic density and high drift density (both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates). the streams with low salmon density had either low instream benthic density (b3) or low drift densities combined with high benthic densities at the stream mouths (d1 and d2). the stream a1 without salmon had both high benthic densities (tables 3 and 4) and high drift densities (table 6, fig. 3). it also ﬂowed into a small-sized tributary of the tana with a high density of benthic invertebrates at the stream mouth (tables 3 and 4). therefore, the highest densities of juvenile salmon were found in streams with riparian vegetation, and were thus also associated with an abundant supply of drift food, including terrestrial invertebrates. the only discrepancy was stream a1 and possible reasons for this will be discussed later. exclusion of this stream from further analyses reduced the number of streams to only seven and therefore it was not possible to ﬁt a 336 multiple regression model that included the 12 envi- ronmental variables (see introduction), benthic density and drift density. discussion the samples of benthos, ﬁsh and drift were taken in august and october, but, for logistic reasons, the drift samples were obtained in 2003, 1 year later than the ﬁsh and benthic samples of 2000, 2001 and 2002. in spite of this sampling discrepancy, there were close correlations between benthic and drift densities, probably because of signiﬁcant differences between years for benthic densities in the same stream and month. therefore, mean densi- ties of benthos and drift in either august or october probably remained fairly constant between years within each stream. the absence of the most common way of estimating ﬁsh abun- dance in streams is to use a three-pass removal sampling electroﬁshing method (bohlin et al. 1989). this method is labour intensive and costly when applied to many areas, and tests show that a single- pass removal method can give a useful indication of ﬁsh abundance (lobo´ n-cervia´ & utrilla 1993; kruse & hubert 1998). catch probability is inﬂuenced by several factors, ﬁsh size (randall 1990) and water ﬂow juvenile salmon, benthos and invertebrate drift b4 m st st b7 m st c1 m st c3 m st c4 m st d1

estimated in the range 0.4–0.7 (e.g. jensen & johnsen 1988; saksga˚rd & heggberget 1990). the estimates of ﬁsh density given in this study from the tana river system should thus be handled with care. many of the sampled streams are difﬁcult to reach, and the main priority when choosing a sampling method was to obtain density estimates that were comparable between streams. the imprecision can be considerable, and therefore only very clear differences in density between streams are discussed here. there were differences in food availability between different habitats available for juvenile salmon in the tana river system. sites sampled in the main river and in the three major tributaries had very low benthic densities, while sites in the smaller tributaries and in streams had high benthic densities. earlier studies (erkinaro 1997; johansen et al. 2005) demonstrated that salmon migrate into streams during the summer and that the migrating ﬁsh generally showed enhanced growth compared with their counterparts in the main stems of the river. one conclusion from the present study was that the streams chieﬂy utilised by salmon were those with a low benthic density at the stream mouth. juvenile salmon were absent or sparse in streams with a high benthic density at the stream mouth and there was a clear negative relationship between parr density within the streams and benthic density at the mouth. the multiple regression model explained 90% of the variation in salmon parr density in august and 67% in october. it also identiﬁed ﬁve key factors out of a possible 14, with the parr density being related negatively to benthic density at the stream mouth, water velocity and ph, and positively to benthic density within the stream and the proportion of the substratum covered by moss. the latter is a good indicator of the degree of substratum stability (johansen et al. 2005). growth and survival of juvenile salmonids are variable and studies suggest that invertebrate biomass, production and drift are responsible for some of this variation (cada et al. 1987; filbert & hawkins 1995). studies of atlantic salmon have shown positive correlations between prey abundance in streams and salmonid growth rates (erkinaro & niemela¨ 1995) and biomass (egglishaw 1967; gibson & galbraith 1975). benthic densities in the main tana river are very low (lax et al. 1993), and the benthos is mainly composed of invertebrates that are little used as food (chirono- mids, oligochaetes and nematodes). the correspond- ing low growth rates in juvenile salmon (erkinaro & niemela¨ 1995) suggest they experience food limitation. density-dependent growth of salmon in that 337 johansen et al.

(1999; 41 studies) summarised studies on the effects of ﬁsh and invertebrate predators on benthic invertebrates and emphasised the importance of the criteria used to select data for the meta-analysis. they illustrated the complexity of the relationships, leading to contradictory conclu- sions. in some experiments, the predators had no effect on the density of benthic invertebrates, whilst in other experiments there was a signiﬁcant effect which was usually negative but occasionally positive, leading to an increase in benthic density. some of these analyses also showed that prey selection can

complexity, is almost impossible to detect predator effects in natural streams, such as the tana system. is not surprising that it it (johansen et al. 2005) the importance of riparian vegetation was illustra- ted by the present study. it provides overhead cover, inputs of allochthonous material and shade. tempera- ture measurements show that water temperatures in the main tana river can exceed 20 °c during the summer (data from the norwegian water resources and energy directorate), while temperatures in shaded and tributaries streams (m. johansen, unpublished data) are lower than 15 °c. temperature directly regulates metabolic rate in salmonids (elliott 1994), and the water temperature in the tana exceeds the upper temperature for maximum food consumption (forseth et al. 2001). high temperature combined with low food availability probably is a stress factor for juvenile salmon living in the main tana and therefore juvenile ﬁsh escape by migrating into cooler streams with higher food availabilities. that invertebrates another conclusion was there were also differences in food availability between streams ﬂow- ing through different vegetation categories. streams ﬂowing through dense riparian vegetation (especially willow sites) had a higher drift density of terrestrial invertebrates than high mountain streams without any riparian tree vegetation. other workers have found that the input of terrestrial invertebrates as ﬁsh food is inﬂuenced by riparian vegetation (mason & macdonald 1982; allan et al. 2003). salmon are commonly described as visual predators that feed on drifting invertebrates (wankowski 1981; stradmeyer & thorpe 1987; keeley & grant 1997). it has been shown experimentally that changing the drift rate triggers a higher rate of benthic feeding (nislow et al. 1998). aerial (terrestrial and adult aquatic invertebrates) can contribute up to 91% of trout prey (kelly-quinn & bracken 1990). salmon probably feed less on aerial prey than trout because of differences in the behaviour and feeding positions of the two species (egglishaw 1967), but studies from scotland and newfoundland show that aerial invertebrates can be important in their diet (gibson & cunjak 1986; bridcut 2000). the life cycles of many benthic insects in streams with dense riparian veget- ation are synchronised with the input of leaves during the autumn. growth of these species occurs during autumn and winter, and adults emerge in spring and early summer. as a result, the biomass of benthic insects is at its lowest point during summer, coinciding with the period when water temperatures are high and salmon metabolism is at its maximal level (hunt 1975; cada et al. 1987). this probably increases 339 johansen et al.

resources and thereby achiev- ing higher growth rate is one possible cause of migration (northcote 1984). an alternative view, supported by the present study, is that migration is a fundamental biological response to adversity (taylor & taylor 1977). this theory has been applied successfully to salmonid populations by thorpe (1989). the juvenile salmon in the main tana river and its large-sized tributaries face an environment with possible food limitations and therefore beneﬁt from the higher food availability found in associated small streams. however, juvenile salmon living in the smaller sized tributaries already live in an environment with relatively high benthic density, and the beneﬁt of migrating to smaller streams in terms of food is thus smaller. finally, it is intriguing that a stream such as a1 was not utilised by juvenile salmon, in spite of its high benthic and drift densities. this suggests the existence of other factors besides food availability controlling migration or, more simply, that the juvenile salmon have not yet reached these streams. an obvious experiment would be to stock these streams with juvenile salmon to see if they could survive. if such an experiment was successful, then it would provide one method for increasing the nursery habitat for juvenile salmon in the tana river. 340 resumen 1. el principal objetivo fue relacionar la densidad de juveniles de salmo_salar con la densidad de invertebrados a lo largo del rı´o tana (norte de noruega). los juveniles de s. salar fueron cuantiﬁcados con pesca ele´ctrica. los invertebrados fueron muestreados en cuatro localidades de 13 rı´os (una localidad en la boca del rı´o y tres localidades aguas arriba) en agosto y octubre de los an˜os 2000, 2001, y 2002. muestreos de deriva fueron tomados en 8 rı´os en agosto y octubre del an˜o 2003. 2. aparecieron solamente diferencias pequen˜as y no signiﬁca- tivas en la densidad de bentos en rı´os con y sin s. salar. todos los rı´os con densidad alta de juveniles de s. salar tuvieron densidad be´nticas bajas en las bocas de los rı´os. los juveniles de s. salar no fueron encontrados (o fueron encontrados en muy bajas densidades) en rı´os donde la densidad de bentos en las bocas fue tan alta como, o mayor que, las densidades en los rı´os. un estudio previo mostro´ que los juveniles mayores de un an˜o migran desde los ha´bitats de nacimiento en rı´os mayores hacia los rı´os ma´s pequen˜os. este estudio mostro´ que este movimiento esta´ asociado con menores densidades de alimento de invertebrados en las bocas de los rı´os, i.e., los juveniles se movieron desde a´reas de baja a a´reas de alta densidad de invertebrados. una regresio´ n mu´ ltiple explico´ el 90% de las variaciones en la densidad entre rı´os mostradas por los juveniles de s. salar en agosto y un 67% en octubre. este estudio identiﬁco´ 5 factores claves de un total de 14 factores posibles: la densidad de juveniles estuvo relacionada negativamente con la densidad de bentos en la boca de los rı´os, la velocidad del agua y el ph y positivamente con la densidad de bentos en los rı´os aguas arriba y con la proporcio´ n de sustrato cubierto por vegetacio´ n, siendo este u´ ltimo factor, un indicador de la estabilidad del sustrato. 3. la densidad de la deriva de invertebrados fue mayor en rı´os que ﬂuyen sobre a´reas con vegetacio´ n riparia densa que en a´reas sin esta vegetacio´n debido a la gran cantidad de invertebrados terrestres que caen al rı´o desde la vegetacio´ n de los alrededores (la cantidad de cubierta vegetal en los rı´os explico´ en 93% de la variaciones en la densidad de la deriva de invertebrados terrestres). las mayores densidades de juveniles fueron encontradas en rı´os con vegetacio´n riparia y estuvieron por ello asociados al abundante alimento en forma de deriva, especialmente de invertebrados terrestres. acknowledgements this work was ﬁnanced by a fellowship from the norwegian research
