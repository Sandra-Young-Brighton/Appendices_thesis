turchin, 1998). although movements that are asso- ciated with increased fitness are predicted to be favoured (stearns, 1992), considerable intraspecific variability in movement exists, as observed in mammals (e.g., pinter- wollman, 2009), birds (e.g., catry et al., 2011) and fish (e.g., kobler, klefoth, mehner, & arlinghaus, 2009). this variability in movement is therefore suggested to reflect the underlying behavioural strategies of individuals (austin, bowen, & mcmillan, 2004; salomon, 2009). for instance, activity that involves risk taking is often considered to be indicative of boldness (bell, 2005; harcourt, sweetman, johnstone, & manica, 2009), with bolder indi- viduals tending to be superior competitors, and thus grow faster and have increased fitness (höjesjö, johnsson, & bohlin, 2002; sundström, petersson, höjesjö, johnsson, & järvi, 2004). studies of the causes and consequences of individual movement are, however, rare due to the difficulty of repeated sampling of the same individuals and ob- serving them in their natural habitat (archard & braithwaite, 2010; bell, hankison, & laskowski, 2009). although ontogeny might affect variability, with individuals becoming more variable and/or specialised with age (polis, 1984), age is not often accounted for in field studies of animal behaviour. individual variation in somatic growth rates that result in variation in body sizes, such as size dimorphism, is a widespread feature of many animals, especially for species that have indeterminate growth and continue to grow after maturity (blanckenhorn, 2005; stamps, 2007). the maintenance of individual variation in growth rates is theorised as being associated with trade- offs between the foraging behaviours of the individual and the expression of their life history traits. for exam- ple, the growth- mortality trade- off theory predicts that individuals with higher levels of activity acquire resources that facilitate faster growth 398  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:398–407. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd﻿nyqvist st  al rates, but in doing so, they take more risks, exposing them to predation risk (stamps, 2007; werner & anholt, 1993). alternatively, trade- offs between activity levels and growth rates might occur where individu- als with increased activity have reduced growth rates due to their in- creased energy expenditure not being balanced with the acquisition of additional trophic resources (killen, brown, & gamperl, 2007; rennie, collins, shuter, rajotte, & couture, 2005; závorka, aldvén, näslund, höjesjö, & johnsson, 2015). the composition of the diet of individuals can also affect the expression of their life history traits, such as juve- nile growth rates and age at sexual maturity (caswell, 2001). in this respect, measures of the trophic niche can have high utility in revealing the contrasting abilities of individuals to acquire variable resources in competitive situations (bolnick et al., 2003). despite the potential im- portance in revealing the mechanisms underpinning individual variabil- ity in movement and its ecological consequences, studies attempting to relate the trophic position of individuals with their somatic growth rates, body sizes and movement patterns are rare. consequently, the aim of this study was to determine how tro- phic position (tp), body size, age and somatic growth rates influenced the movement patterns of individuals in a model fish population. the model species was the piscivorous pike esox lucius using the population in the river frome, southern england, as the study system. we specif- ically concentrated on their juvenile life stages (age 0 + and 1 + years), as previous work on this population has highlighted considerable vari- ability in their body lengths at these ages (e.g., mann & beaumont, 1990). we tested the following predictions: (i) individual movement varies between age classes, with age 1 + individuals moving more than those at 0 + ; (ii) within age classes, larger individuals with higher tps move more than smaller individuals at lower tps; and (iii) irrespective of age class, individuals that move more achieve higher growth rates and attain a higher tp compared to individuals that move less.     |  399 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | model species and study population as a long- lived and large apex predator fish species with a circumpo- lar distribution, the biology and ecology of pike has been extensively studied (craig, 1996; forsman et al., 2015; raat, 1988). considerable variation in early life growth rates has been found in both wild popula- tions (cucherousset, paillisson, & roussel, 2007; mann & beaumont, 1990) and captive situations (bry, bonamy, manelphe, & duranthon, 1995; ziliukiene & ziliukas, 2006). several studies have revealed a high level of interindividual variability in their spatial behaviour (jepsen, beck, skov, & koed, 2001; masters et al., 2005; vehanen, hyvarinen, johansson, & laaksonen, 2006) and trophic ecology (beaudoin, tonn, prepas, & wassenaar, 1999; chapman, mackay, & wilkinson, 1989; skov, lousdal, johansen, & berg, 2003). pike is therefore a strong model organism for studying individual spatial behaviours related to growth and foraging. in the focal population, adult pike tend to spawn in narrow side channels and agricultural drainage ditches connected to the main river (mann & beaumont, 1990). while some young- of- the- year fish (0 + cohort) move from these nursery grounds into the main river during their first summer, others are known to remain in these ditches until at least their second year of life (mann & beaumont, 1990). in this study, the age 0 + and 1 + pike inhabiting three side chan- nels (hereafter referred to as “ditches”) of the river frome (namely rushton ditch, railway ditch and flood relief channel) connected to the main river (50°41′9′’ n; 2°11′9′’ w) were studied between january 2009 and march 2011 (figure 1). rushton ditch is a 400- m- long chan- nel of up to 1 m deep and from 2.4 to 4 m in width; railway ditch is approximately 250 m long, up to 0.75 m deep and 2.3 to 3.6 m wide; figure 1 map of the study site of the river frome in dorset, uk 400  |     and the flood relief channel is 160 m long with depths to 1.5 m and widths from 2.3 to 3.6 m. a variety of fish species (e.g., eels anguilla anguilla, minnows phoxinus phoxinus) also inhabit and/or utilise the ditches as part of their life cycle, with pike using them as spawning and nursery habitats (mann & beaumont, 1990). all ditches are heavily vegetated (majority: glyceria fluitans, phalariss arundinacea, callitriche stagnalis, potamogeton natans, carex riparia, juncus effusus) with some tree cover, and the majority of the substrate was silt. the ditches are very slow flowing and support a rich diversity of aquatic invertebrates (armitage, szoszkiewicz, blackburn, & nesbitt, 2003). each ditch was divided into 10 m patches, with these marked out using semi- permanent, numbered wooden posts. the widths of the ditch patches were measured at their boundaries and in the middle (i.e., every 5 m). 2.2 | sample collection the pike used in the study were sampled using a smith- root lr- 24 back- mounted electric fisher (50 mhz pulsed dc at approximately 2 amps). captured fish were anaesthetised (tricaine methanesulphonate (ms- 222), 3.5 ml/l of river water) before being measured (fork length [fl], nearest mm). scales were then sampled for subsequent age de- termination, and pelvic fin clips were taken for stable isotope analyses. the stable isotope ratios of fin tissue correlate strongly with those of dorsal muscle tissue (jardine, gray, mcwilliam, & cunjak, 2005), but with the advantage of fin clips being less destructive and not adversely affecting fish survival and growth (gjerde & refstie, 1988). pike were tagged by surgically implanting a 23.1 mm passive integrated tran- sponder (pit) tag (texas instruments, half- duplex, 3.85 mm diameter, 0.6 g). the smallest fish tagged that was included in the analyses was 138 mm and 17.0 g, with the tag to body mass ratio for fish of age 0 + and 1 + ranging from 0.6% to 3.5%, and 0.3% to 0.8% respectively. pit tags were inserted into the coelomic cavity of the fish through a small incision made on the left side below the sideline slightly poste- rior to the pelvic fin. prior to their tagging, pike were scanned for the presence of an existing pit tag to enable recaptured individuals to be recognised. after recovery from anaesthesia in oxygenated fresh river water, individuals were released close to their individual capture point. electric fishing surveys were completed prior to and after each tracking period had been completed (see next subsection). the study was approved by an independent ethical review com- mittee of bournemouth university, with all tagging and tissue biopsy procedures completed under licence according to the uk animals (scientific procedures) act 1986 by the uk home office. 2.3 | tracking surveys tracking of the pit- tagged fish was undertaken over three independ- ent time periods during the study (hereafter referred to as “tracking periods” that comprise of individual “tracking surveys”): spring 2009 (24/03/2009 to 31/05/2009; n = 17 tracking surveys), spring 2010 (11/03/2010 to 27/05/2010; n = 13) and winter 2011 (05/01/2011 to 22/02/2011; n = 12). the rationale of these tracking periods was that studies suggest that more intense movement occurs in pike during ﻿nyqvist st  al early winter when temperatures increase slightly and during spring from mid- march to mid- may, with this coinciding with spawning in adults (koed, balleby, mejlhede, & aarestrup, 2006). during the three tracking periods, tracking was conducted on a regular basis every 4 to 6 days in order that consistent patterns in individual movements could be detected. note that the railway ditch was not monitored in winter 2011 due to few individual pike (n = 2) being captured prior to the tracking period. each tracking survey comprised of tracking of tagged fish using a portable pit antenna system, as per roussel, haro, and cunjak (2000) and cucherousset et al. (2010). the detection range of the antenna, measured as the distance between the plane of the antenna loop and the tag, varied with tag orientation, ranging from 55 cm when the tag was horizontal to 85 cm when the tag was vertical. the antenna was generally swept just above the water surface to detect the fish, but when the water was deeper than the detection distance of 55 cm, the antenna was submerged vertically to increase detection efficiency. the pike were tracked in a downstream direction from each side of the bank (cucherousset et al., 2010), with the exception being railway ditch where it was only possible from one bank. the antenna had an extendable pole with a maximum length of 4 m, which allowed scan- ning across the whole width of each ditch. each tracking survey covered all the ditches on the same day and took approximately 4.5 hr (railway ditch 1.5 hr, flood relief 1 hr and rushton ditch 2 hr). to test for the effect of time of day on tracking efficiency and movement, surveys in spring 2009 were conducted at different times of day: from dawn (06:00 to 08:00 hr, n = 5), during day- light (10:00 to 14:00 hr, n = 6) and towards dusk (16:00 to 18:00 hr, n = 6). as this revealed no significant effect of time of day on the num- ber of fish detected (table s1), as also detected by cucherousset et al. (2010), all subsequent tracking surveys were conducted during daylight hours (09:00 to 17:00 hr). during each survey, the patch number, and the distances along the length of the patch and to the closest bank (nearest 0.1 m), were recorded for each detected individual. the de- tection efficiency of the tracking was calculated using the formula: −1, where nd was the number of tagged individuals detected 100ndnp during a tracking survey, which were later recaptured, and np was the number of tagged individuals present (recaptured) in the ditches (cucherousset et al., 2010). the tracking efficiency was determined using the last tracking surveys of each tracking period in each ditch. by only including recaptured pike in the calculations, we ensured that the detection efficiency was based on living fish. detection efficiency depends on the species studied (cucherousset et al., 2010), but also on the water depth. in similar tracking studies, although conducted in streams with lower water depths, detections efficiencies of 19.6% to 81.9% have been reported (cucherousset et al., 2007; enders, clarke, pennell, ollerhead, & scruton, 2007; roussel et al., 2000). at the con- clusion of each tracking period, another electric fishing survey was also completed during which detected fish attempted to be recaptured, with the data collected as previously outlined. only recaptured, tagged individuals were included in subsequent analyses to avoid the inclusion of data from tags that had been expelled from fish or where the fish had died, and thus removed these aspects as potential confounding factors. ﻿nyqvist st  al 2.4 | stable isotope analysis (sia) trophic position of individuals was quantified using the stable iso- tope of nitrogen (δ15n) that shows enrichment of 2% to 4‰ from resource to consumer (post, 2002). to provide the baseline isotopic signals of the putative food resources of the fish, specimens of water louse asellus aquaticus were collected at the completion of each elec- tric fishing survey. this macroinvertebrate was the most abundant species in the ditches and has constituted an important part of the diet of juvenile pike in the river frome (mann, 1982). one sia sam- ple of a. aquaticus comprised of two to four individuals. the samples were oven dried (60°c for 48 hr), ground into a homogenous powder, weighed (all samples were 0.5–1 mg), and analysed at cornell isotope laboratory, usa. initial data outputs were in the format of delta (δ15n) isotope ratios, expressed in ‰. tp for each individual pike was then calculated using the formula: tp = ([fish δ15n – mean prey δ15n]/3.4) + 2, where 3.4 represents a widely used single trophic level fractiona- tion in δ15n, and 2 corresponds to the trophic level of primary con- sumers (vander zanden, shuter, lester, & rasmussen, 2000). 2.5 | data analyses ages of the individual, recaptured pike were determined by analys- ing their scales on a projecting microscope (×48 magnification), with counting the number of annual growth marks. a quality control proce- dure was used whereby a second operator aged 25% of the scales in- dependently. the growth rates of individual pike were measured using the specific growth rate (sgr), expressed as the change in fork length (mm) for each tracking period, where sgr = (ln[lf]- ln[li])*100/t, with li and lf being the initial and final lengths (mm) of the individual, and t is the number of days between the length measurements. to enable movement metrics of individual pike to be calculated, the initial step was to plot each fish location that was collected on each tracking occasion into two- dimensional coordinate values y (metre transects along the ditch length) and x (metre equidistant strata across the ditch width), following roussel, cunjak, newbury, caissie, and haro (2004) and cucherousset, paillisson, cuzol, and roussel (2009). the equidistant strata were calculated based on the average width obtained from three measurements of each 10- m- long patch of the ditch. first, the mean position for each individual fish was calculated by averaging the x- coordinate values obtained for all detections (x1, x2, x3,…) to calculate x and the y- coordinate values obtained for all detec- tions (y1, y2, y3,…) to calculate y this mean arithmetic position (x,y) was defined as the centroid of the positions from where the distance to all other points (i.e., individual positions obtained at each tracking) is the smallest (lair, 1987). secondly, we calculated the radial distances (m) for each detection (d1, d2, d3,…). the radial distances for each detection were calculated as the measured distances from the mean position (x,y ) and every location (x1- y1, x2- y2, x3- y3,…) to provide an estimation of fish position dispersal around its arithmetic mean position (x,y). the arithmetic mean radial distance (d) was then calculated by averaging the radial distances (d1, d2, d3,…). distances (v1, v2, v3,…) between two successive positions (from x1- y1 to x2- y2, from x2- y2 to x3- y3,…) were     |  401 calculated and subsequently divided by time between two consecu- tive detections (in days) to provide a measurement of the mean arith- metic distance (m) travelled per day (v) (roussel et al., 2004). while daily distance moved is a measure of distances between subsequent detection positions per day, radial distances provide an estimation of fish dispersal around its arithmetic mean position. radial distances are therefore more indicative of the home range of individuals. 2.6 | statistical analyses to obtain normal and homogenous variances prior to parametric anal- yses, mean radial distance moved (d), mean distance travelled per day (v) and sgr were log transformed. the mean radial distance (d) and mean distance travelled per day (v) were used in the preliminary analy- ses testing for differences between ditches, while the individual radial distances (d1, d2, d3,…) and distances between successive position (v1, v2, v3,…) were used in the linear mixed effect models. all analyses were conducted using r 3.2.5 (r development core team 2012). the effects of age or tracking period on the number of detections were tested using one- way anovas with either age or tracking period as fixed factors. as there were no age- 1 fish sampled in 2009, analyses using sampling periods in 2010 and 2011 were conducted to assess whether there would be an interaction between age (0 + , 1 + ) and season (spring 2010, winter 2011) on movement. as no interaction was found (table s2), all three sampling periods were used in the sub- sequent analyses without the interaction age x sampling period. to determine the causes for interindividual variability in move- ment, linear mixed effect models (lmms) were conducted using the lme function in the nlme package (pinheiro, bates, debroy, sarkar, & core team, 2015). radial distances (d1, d2, d3,…) or daily distances (v1, v2, v3,…) moved were fitted as the response variable and age, period, initial tp and initial fl as predictors. possible serial autocorrelation within individual movement measures was accounted for by a corar1 argument for radial distance and daily distances moved. individual id was nested within ditch as a random effect and age, period, initial fl and initial tp were fitted as fixed factors. individuals were sampled for length to calculate growth rate, and fin clips were taken to attain a value for tp at the end of each tracking session. consequences of individual movement on sgr or final tps were tested by running lmms with each movement metric as a pre- dictor and sgr or final tp as the response variable. thus, either daily distance moved or radial distances were fitted as predictors together with initial tp, age and period, and individual id was nested within ditch as a random effect. all models were first run with full two- way interactions and then simplified until no further model simplification could be made without removing a significant interaction (p < .05) (zuur, ieno, walker, savaliev, & smith, 2009). marginal r2 and con- ditional r2 values for each model were calculated using the “piece- wisesem” package (lefcheck, 2015). the marginal r2 describes the proportion of variance explained by the fixed factors alone, whereas the conditional r2 describes the variance explained by fixed and ran- dom factors (nakagawa & schielzeth, 2013). the standardised regres- sion coefficients that were scaled by mean and variance, and 95% 402  |     ﻿nyqvist st  al

1). therefore, 38% of the tagged pike were included in subsequent analyses, with all individuals were only detected in the ditches where they were tagged. a mean detection deficiency of 70.7% ± 1.7% of the pike tagged and recaptured in the ditches was obtained during the three tracking periods. there were no significant differences in body lengths at capture between re- captured and nonrecaptured individuals (table s3). there was also no relationship between body size at tagging and the number of subsequent detections (spearman’s correlation, r = −0.11, p > .05). the overall mean number of

variability in individual movement there was considerable variation in the movement of individuals between age classes and tracking periods. the radial distance (d) for 0 + fish in spring 2009 ranged from 2.6 to 42.1 m (mean 13.4 ± 6.9), in spring 2010 from 5.8 to 25.0 m (mean 12.0 ± 2.5) and in winter 2011 from 1.2 to 3.1 m (mean 2.0 ± 4.8). in 1 + pike, it was 10.4 to 25.0 m (mean 16.7 ± 1.8) in spring 2010 and 1.3 to 64.9 m (mean 17.0 ± 0.2) in winter 2011. the conditional and marginal r2 for the model with radial distance as a response variable were 0.47 and 0.11 respectively, and for the model with daily distance moved as response variable 0.11 and 0.06 respectively. both radial distance and daily dis- tances moved differed between ages and tracking periods; individu- als of age 1 + moved more than 0 + , and there was significantly less movement in winter than spring (table 2). the effects of initial fish length were, however, not significant. the daily distances of individu- als with higher initial tp were significantly less than those with lower initial tp (table 2). table 2 results of linear mixed models used to test for the effects of age, period, initial tp and fl on

and marginal r2 were 0.99 and 0.19 respectively for both models testing the effects of radial distance or daily distance on sgr (table 3), indicating high descriptive power of the models. sgr was age- dependent with age 0 + fish growing faster than 1 + , whereas tracking period had no significant effects on sgr (table 3). both radial distance and daily distances moved correlated positively to individual sgr, however, this correlation was dependent on initial tp and age (table 3). individuals with a higher initial tp had a higher sgr and the significant interaction term between initial tp and each move- ment metric revealed that individuals with a higher initial tp tended to move less (table 3; figure 2). the interaction between age and radial distances affecting sgr was due to fish of age 0 + growing faster but moving less than age 1 + fish (figure 2). the conditional and marginal r2 were 0.91 and 0.04 respectively for the model testing the effects of radial distance on final tp, and 0.93 and 0.04 respectively for the model testing the effects of daily distance on final tp (table 4). the model showed that final tp was dependent on age in the model that included radial distances as a fixed factor, while period had no significant effects on either model (table 4). radial distance and daily distances moved had significant positive effects on final tp, although this was affected by initial tp as described above for the effect on sgr (table 4). 4 |  discussion the individual movements of the juvenile pike were significantly in- fluenced by age, with fish of 1 + year showing greater movements than 0 + fish, with this consistent with the first prediction. although     |  403 initial tp was significantly and negatively associated with daily move- ments, body size had no significant influence on individual movement, contrary to the second prediction. in line with the third prediction, individuals that moved more achieved a higher somatic growth rate and an elevated final tp. these results suggest that individuals with higher levels of activity (i.e., more movement) acquire higher quality resources (as revealed by higher tp) and achieve higher growth rates (as sgr). it should be noted that the fate of the tagged fish that were never detected or recaptured in the study were unable to be deter- mined. given that mortality or tag loss within the ditch would result in the tag still being detected, then it was assumed these individuals either emigrated into the main channel or were depredated by a bird or mammal (cucherousset et al., 2007) and thus removed from the study areas. irrespective, this remains speculative and thus the fate of these fish is not considered further. that the development of older fish having larger home ranges (as radial distances) and moving greater distances (as daily distances) was independent of fish length is ecologically important, as previous work on this pike population has revealed that size dimorphism is a feature of their juvenile life stages. this dimorphism has been associated with movements from the ditches into the main river channel, whereby fish that remained in the ditches were smaller than migrants moving into the main river channel (mann & beaumont, 1990). however, the timing of this migration into the river, or the drivers responsible for this, was not determined (mann & beaumont,

significant differences in individual movements of these fish were a function of age, not length, then the influence of size dimorphism on these movements appeared minimal. this nonsignificant

kobler, klefoth, wolter, fredrich, & arlinghaus, 2008). in the study river, masters et al. (2005) revealed adult pike exhibit a continuum of spatial behaviours, with some individuals always using the same few hundred metres of river, while others use stretches over several kilometres. while influenced by pike length, the length range of these tracked fish was considerable (520 to 950 mm), with ﻿nyqvist st  al considerable variation in movement patterns between individuals of relatively similar size (masters et al., 2005). while it is difficult to extrapolate adult behaviour to juveniles, the length range of juvenile pike used here was relatively narrow (138 to 301 mm) and thus might have been insufficient to result in strong size- structured movement patterns. that age was a significant determinant of movement might then have been through it being a function of time, with older fish in the ditches having longer to establish larger home ranges in which they were able to make higher daily movements. this could align to “prior residence advantage,” where individuals that are present first in a new habitat obtain, and subsequently defend, the most profitable sites, with this often apparent in the behavioural ecology of salmonid fishes (e.g., harwood, griffiths, metcalfe, & armstrong, 2003). the development of the differences in movement patterns be- tween individuals might also have been influenced by their underlying behaviours that relates to their propensity for risk taking. we have previously documented individual consistency in foraging activity across risky situations consisting of the presence/absence of a com- petitor or predator laboratory experiments using 0 + pike collected from this particular population (nyqvist, gozlan, cucherousset, & britton, 2012, 2013). bolder individuals maintained a high foraging ac- tivity through time, while shyer individuals maintained a low foraging activity, but without consequences on growth (nyqvist et al., 2012, 2013). the individual variation in movement detected in the present study might thus relate to the degree of risk- taking behaviour but with consequences on growth. under the experimental settings of nyqvist et al. (2012), pike were kept in isolation, meaning that the intraspecific interactions, including effects of competition or dominance hierar- chies on individual growth, were removed, which was not the case for the pike in the ditches. apart from the important effect of intraspecific interactions, a heterogeneous environment may also play a significant role in providing the potential for habitat and resource segregation to occur and so, subsequently, enables divergent growth within a popu- lation. laskowski et al. (2016) tested individual behaviour of wild adult pike captured from a lake in standardised open- field behavioural as- says. the measured standardised behaviour did not relate to growth rate (laskowski et al., 2016). in contrast, our results show that individ- ual movement had positive consequences on growth and trophic po- sitions in juvenile pike in the wild. this difference may be explained by the differences in habitat complexity. while size dimorphism has been reported in our study population (mann & beaumont, 1990), no size differences were reported for the pike in the particular lake studied by laskowski et al. (2016). that individuals that moved achieved higher growth rates and an elevated final trophic position in our study may be related to the mortality- growth trade- off mediated by foraging activity (werner & anholt, 1993). foraging activities increase the probability of preda- tor detection and thus increased movements should lead to increased mortality risk (werner & anholt, 1993). reduced activity in the pres- ence of predators is also an important antipredator behaviour (lima & dill, 1990). in many animals, vulnerability to predation decreases with increasing body size, and especially in juvenile fish due to the issue of gape- size limitation in piscivorous animals (nilsson & bronmark,     |  405 2000). growth rate is therefore an important determinant of the probability of individual survival and is often used as a fitness proxy (brown, jones, & braithwaite, 2007). experimental studies on several fish species have revealed growth differences relating to foraging activity (imsland, jenssen, jonassen, & stefansson, 2009; jobling & baardvik, 1994; martin- smith & armstrong, 2002). studies on rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss have demonstrated that individuals taking greater risks while foraging grew faster, but survived at a lower rate in the presence of predators than individuals taking fewer risks (biro, abrahams, post, & parkinson, 2004, 2006). an increasing number of studies demonstrate that individual spe- cialisation in resource use in a population often develops where there is low interspecific competition but high intraspecific competition (araújo, bolnick, & layman, 2011; bolnick et al., 2011; svanbäck & bolnick, 2007). individual resource specialisation appears to be partic- ularly common among apex predator fishes (araújo et al., 2011), which may be explained by that they usually have few interspecific competi- tors in the community. in our study site, juvenile pike density, a proxy for intraspecific competition (araújo et al., 2011), was high with few (if any) other predatory species present. while individual specialisation in resource use often results in the development of related morpho- logical traits (bolnick et al., 2003; cucherousset et al., 2011; smith & skulason, 1996), cannibalism has been suggested to be the proximate cause of bimodal size distributions in some fish species (claessen, de roos, & persson, 2000). thus, a factor potentially contributing to the observed consequences for growth rates and trophic ecology in our studied pike may be the combined effect of intraspecific competition with cannibalism. in conclusion, individual variation in movement was negatively as- sociated with tp, and increased movement had positive influences on individual growth rates and subsequent tp in these juvenile pike. we suggest that individual variability in movement and tps reflects vari- ation in foraging activity, which may be underpinned by personality traits, but with causal drivers also involving pressures from intraspe- cific competition and trade- off with mortality risk, especially the risk from cannibalism. acknowledgements we are grateful to the numerous persons participating in the field- work. we thank anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this manuscript. this work was funded by a phd studentship from bournemouth university and support from the swedish cultural foundation in finland. references araújo, m. s., bolnick, d. i., & layman, c. a.
