(cargnelli & gross 1996; santucci & wahl 2003) and crappies pomoxis spp. (raﬁnesque) (pope & willis 1998; pine & allen 2001) that generally exhibited hatching periods exceeding 30 days. much effort has been dedicated to understanding the reproductive behaviour and early life history of smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu (lacepe`de) (ridgway et al. 1991; deangelis et al. 1993; sabo & orth 1996; wiegmann et al. 1997). events occurring during the ﬁrst year of life can affect survival and eventual recruitment of smallmouth bass (cleary 1956; shuter et al. 1980; ridgway & friesen 1992; sabo & orth 1995). speciﬁcally, research has suggested that the size attained by age-0 smallmouth bass prior to their ﬁrst winter may affect survival to age-1 (oliver et al. 1979; shuter et al. 1980; cunningham & shuter 1986), yet little information exists concerning the effects of hatch timing and daily growth rates on size attained by age-0 smallmouth bass prior to their ﬁrst winter. largemouth bass hatching periods in the south- eastern united states have ranged from 34 to 71 days and size attained by age-0 bass is often related to hatch timing (goodgame & miranda 1993; ludsin & devries 1997; pine et al. 2000). conversely, previously reported hatching or swim-up periods for smallmouth bass have been relatively short, ranging from 3 to 40 days (turner & maccrimmon 1970; graham & orth 1987; ridgway & friesen 1992; picard et al. 1993; sabo & orth 1995). short hatching periods may limit the inﬂuence of hatch date on age-0 smallmouth bass growth and size. speciﬁcally, sabo & orth (1995) reported that regard- less of hatch timing, all individuals within an age-0 smallmouth bass cohort had equal probability of achieving large sizes in august. similarly, hatching of largemouth bass in one wisconsin lake occurred over 17–21 days and hatch date explained less than 40% of the variability in individual age-0 bass length (post et al. 1998). their smallmouth bass represent a popular sportﬁshery across much of range and recruitment of smallmouth bass is often inconsistent (cleary 1956; serns 1982; mason et al. 1991; slipke et al. 1998; buynak & mitchell 2002). although smallmouth bass recruitment patterns have been linked to environmen- tal factors such as streamﬂow (mason et al. 1991; slipke et al. 1998) and water warming rates (serns 1982), the mechanisms regulating the survival of individuals to age-1 remain poorly understood. lab- oratory experiments with smallmouth bass (oliver et al. 1979; shuter et al. 1980; cunningham & shuter 1986) and evidence from studies on largemouth bass (gutreuter & anderson 1985; ludsin & devries 1997) suggest that size-selective mechanisms are important in regulating age-0 bass survival. conse- quently, elucidating factors inﬂuencing the size 364 attained by age-0 smallmouth bass remains important in understanding the recruitment process. to determine whether hatch timing regulates growth and size of age-0 smallmouth bass prior to their ﬁrst winter, we described hatching events and daily growth patterns for bass collected in august from two south dakota glacial lakes over a 3-year period. we hypothesised that hatch timing would have limited inﬂuence on growth and size of age-0 smallmouth bass in these populations. study area enemy swim (884 ha) and pickerel (386 ha) lakes are mesotrophic to eutrophic natural lakes located within the prairie pothole region in day county in northeast- ern south dakota. enemy swim lake has a mean depth of 4.8 m, a maximum depth of 10 m and a shoreline development index of 2.3 (blackwell 2001). vegetation coverage (emergent and submergent) dur- ing summer is approximately 30%; dominant sub- strates are silt (55%), sand (25%) and gravel (16%) with limited amounts of rock substrate (<4%; blackwell 2001). pickerel lake has a mean depth of 6.1 m, a maximum depth of 13.1 m, a shoreline development index of 2.2 and limited aquatic vegeta- tion coverage (<10%). primary substrates in pickerel lake are silt (49%) and sand (35%) with limited amounts of gravel and rock (<10%). the lakes are located 2.5 km from one another. surface water temperatures during the ﬁrst week of june on both enemy swim and pickerel lakes averaged 18 °c from 2000 to 2002. smallmouth bass were not native to these lakes (bailey & allum 1962) and were intro- duced to pickerel lake in 1983 by the south dakota department of game, fish and parks (sdgfp). adult smallmouth bass were ﬁrst collected in enemy swim lake in 1991 and may have been transported by anglers. from 1991 to 1993, sdgfp stocked ﬁngerling smallmouth bass in enemy swim lake (b. blackwell, personal communication). smallmouth bass populations in both lakes are now maintained through natural reproduction. material and methods age-0 smallmouth bass were collected from enemy swim and pickerel lakes during the ﬁrst week of august from 2000 to 2002. fish were collected with a mesh bag seine (15.2-m long, 6.4-mm bar mesh). all sites were randomly selected and remained ﬁxed throughout the course of the evaluation to reduce variability in catch per unit effort (cpue; catch per seine haul) among sites. number of sampling sites was based on lake size; 24 sites were sampled annually on enemy swim lake and 20 sites were sampled on inﬂuence of hatch duration and growth rate on bass size pickerel lake. total lengths (tl; mm) were measured from all smallmouth bass to calculate overall mean tl. in most cases, sagittal otoliths were removed from 30 to 35 randomly selected age-0 smallmouth bass from each sample to estimate hatch dates and daily growth rates from daily ring counts (graham & orth 1987). for enemy swim lake in 2000 and pickerel lake in 2002, otoliths were removed from all age-0 smallmouth bass captured, as total sample sizes were less than 30. otoliths were removed from 56 age-0 smallmouth bass on enemy swim in 2002 because of the relatively large number of bass encountered (n = 185). otoliths were wiped clean on a paper towel and then placed in vials and allowed to dry for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to mounting. otoliths were mounted on glass slides using cyanoacrylic cement. daily ring counts were conducted by an individual reader (campana 1990) using otolith images projected through a compound microscope (400 · magniﬁca- tions) onto a television monitor. rings were counted three times and the mean of the three counts was used in estimating hatch date. in some cases, otoliths were lightly polished with wetted 1000-grit sand paper and immersion oil was used to improve otolith clarity. graham and orth (1987) observed that daily rings were not formed in age-0 smallmouth bass otoliths until swim-up occurred at approximately 7 days; therefore, daily ring counts were adjusted by adding 7 days to the average daily ring count to estimate hatch date. hatch dates were estimated by subtracting adjusted average daily ring count from the day of year on which ﬁsh were collected (1 january representing day 1). two-factor anova was used to determine whether lake and year were signiﬁcant in explaining variability in hatch date of age-0 smallmouth bass; bonferroni-corrected t-tests were used in making multiple comparisons (corrected a = 0.01). graham and orth (1987) also reported that tl of age-0 swim-up was approximately smallmouth bass at )1) over the 8.4 mm; daily growth estimates (mmæday period from swim-up until time of capture in august were estimated for each bass by the equation: daily growth ¼ tl at capture   8:4 mm average daily ring count pearson’s correlations were used to assess the relationship between hatch date and daily growth rate. positive relationships between hatch date and daily growth would be indicative of situations where later- hatched ﬁsh experienced faster growth than earlier- hatched individuals of the same cohort. simple linear regression procedures were used to determine whether hatch date and individual daily growth rates were in explaining variation in tl of age-0 important smallmouth relations bass. although statistical between daily growth and tl share common terms (i.e., tl), prior research suggests the mathematical and ecological relationships produced are not spurious (prairie & bird 1989). results length frequencies of age-0 smallmouth bass for both lakes were unimodal in all 3 years. tl of smallmouth bass collected in august seine hauls ranged from 43 to 98 mm and mean tl ranged from 59 to 75 mm (fig. 1). mean tl of age-0 smallmouth bass was generally similar between lakes within each sampling year (differences <9 mm). annual differences in mean tl within each lake were more apparent (fig. 1). annual differences in mean tl of age-0 smallmouth bass in enemy swim lake ranged from 2 to 12 mm, whereas in pickerel lake differences ranged from 9 to 15 mm (fig. 1). in both lakes, mean tl of age-0 smallmouth bass was highest in 2001. some otoliths (n £ 5 in an individual sample) were damaged during polishing and were considered unreadable, which slightly reduced otolith sample sizes. based on average daily ring counts, hatching of smallmouth bass surviving until august in the two lakes occurred from late may until late june (fig. 2). hatching durations ranged from 19 to 27 days (mean = 22 days). distributions of hatch dates were unimodal in nature with mean hatch date generally occurring during the ﬁrst 10 days of june (fig. 2). lake was not signiﬁcant in explaining variability in mean hatching dates (f = 3.810, d.f. = 1, 170 and p = 0.0525) while year was considered a signiﬁcant explanatory variable (f = 3.64, d.f. = 2, 170 and p = 0.0284); however, a signiﬁcant interaction be- tween lake and year (f = 9.14, d.f. = 2, 170 and p = 0.0002) existed in explaining variability in mean hatch dates and multiple comparisons were made using treatment level means. mean hatch date of smallmouth bass in pickerel lake during 2000 was signiﬁcantly earlier (7 days) than in 2002 and repre- sented the only signiﬁcant difference among years in pickerel lake (fig. 2). no among-year differences in mean hatching date were detected for smallmouth bass in enemy swim lake. mean hatch date did not signiﬁcantly differ between lakes in any year. based on correlation analyses, we did not detect any signiﬁcant relations among daily growth rate and hatch date (fig. 3). mean daily growth rates of age-0 smallmouth bass collected in both lakes ranged from )1. the overall daily growth 0.56 to 1.56 mmæday anova indicated that both lake and year were signiﬁcant in explaining variability in mean growth rates (lake: f = 13.89, d.f. = 1, 170 and p = 0.0003;

post et al. 1998; fullerton et al. 2000). smallmouth bass hatching periods similar to those in our study have been reported elsewhere. sabo & orth (1995) reported that swim-up of age-0 small- mouth bass in one virginia river occurred over an approximate 25-day period and annual variation in hatch dates (s2 = 1.5–50.8) reported by ridgway & friesen (1992) for lake opeongo, ontario, resulted in hatching durations similar to our study. conversely, turner & maccrimmon (1970) reported that hatching of smallmouth bass in tadenac lake, ontario occurred over only a 3-day period. extended hatching periods for smallmouth bass are not unexpected based on observations of smallmouth bass spawning behaviour. protracted spawning windows for smallmouth bass (ridgway et al. 1991; picard et al. 1993) and spawn timing can vary across groups of bass in the same lake 370 because of factors such as body size (ridgway et al. 1991; wiegmann et al. 1997) and are likely because of temporal differences in water temperature. hatch timing of age-0 smallmouth bass in the two lakes we sampled overlapped with hatch timing reported in other evaluations (ridgway & friesen 1992; picard et al. 1993; sabo & orth 1995). based on mean hatch dates, peak hatch timing in enemy swim and pickerel lakes occurred slightly earlier than peak hatching in lake opeongo, ontario (ridgway & friesen 1992); hatch timing was similar to or slightly later than smallmouth bass hatching reported for the north anna river, virginia (sabo & orth 1995). these results may suggest latitudinal differences in peak hatch timing among smallmouth bass populations. little variation in peak hatch timing (as measured by mean hatch date) occurred between lakes or among years within a lake during our study. ridgway & friesen (1992) and sabo & orth (1995) reported that smallmouth bass hatched earlier in the year grew slower than bass hatched later in a given spawning season, a relationship also noted in several other studies of growth in age-0 ﬁshes (rice et al. 1987; ludsin & devries 1997; pine & allen 2001; sammons et al. 2001; santucci & wahl 2003). conversely, cargnelli & gross (1996) and garvey et al. (2002) offered evidence that growth of bluegills did not always differ between groups hatching at different times. similarly, we found that hatch timing was not strongly related to growth rates of age-0 smallmouth bass in enemy swim and pickerel suggesting that earlier-hatched individuals lakes, were capable of exhibiting growth rates comparable to later-hatched individuals of the same cohort. in addition, the weak positive correlations we detected between hatch date and daily growth were not necessarily associated with the longest hatching durations observed in each lake. hatching windows for smallmouth bass in our study and in other evaluations (ridgway & friesen 1992; picard et al. 1993; sabo & orth 1995) were generally much shorter than those reported for largemouth bass in southeastern reservoirs (34–71 days; goodgame & miranda 1993; phillips et al. 1995; sammons et al. 1999). secondly, bimodality in length frequency distributions of age-0 largemouth bass cohorts has been reported in other studies (timmons et al. 1980; miranda & hubbard 1994b; sammons et al. 1999) and was linked to variability in hatch timing (miranda & hubbard 1994b; ludsin & devries 1997; sammons et al. 1999). we suggest that the strong relationship we observed between daily growth rate and tl attained by smallmouth bass likely occurred because hatching windows were relatively narrow. simply, age-0 small- mouth bass that grew faster exhibited greater tl and may have had a higher probability of survival than inﬂuence of hatch duration and growth rate on bass size slower-growing members. because size-selective mechanisms occur in other taxonomic groups (hen- derson et al. 1988; thompson et al. 1991; phelps et al. in press), we suggest that daily growth may be may be an important factor inﬂuencing survival of ﬁshes with similar early life history characteristics. it should be noted that we estimated hatching dates only for those smallmouth bass surviving until august of each year. moreover, several previous studies of black bass micropterus spp. hatching dates have employed a similar approach, collecting age-0 bass at speciﬁed points during summer or early fall to estimate hatching dates (i.e., sabo & orth 1995; ludsin & devries 1997; sammons et al. 1999). sampling designs of this type may fail to account for the full range of bass hatching dates because some age-0 bass may have hatched but did not survive until the point when samples were collected (pine et al. 2000). consequently, the hatching durations we observed may not reﬂect the full range of smallmouth bass hatching dates in pickerel and enemy swim lakes. additionally, our analyses may have been affected by size-related sampling bias associated with the shoreline seine sampling we conducted in that larger bass may more easily avoid capture by seine (jackson & noble 1995; pine et al. 2000); however, we were unable to assess the extent of this bias as part of our evaluation. furthermore, for statistical reasons, we used random sampling to select ﬁsh for otolith analysis (e.g., sammons et al. 1999; fitzgerald et al. 2001; walsh et al. 2005; smith et al. 2006), which could result in rarer ﬁsh falling within the tails of the length frequency distribution not being selected for otolith removal. however, lengths of ﬁsh included in otolith samples encompassed between 75 and 100% (‡87% in ﬁve of the six samples) of all 1-mm length intervals observed in age-0 smallmouth bass length frequency distributions. it remains possible that a slightly wider range of hatch dates may have been estimated if smallmouth bass of all observed lengths were included in otolith analyses, but our sample coverage and the lack of strong linear relationships between hatch date and bass tl suggests that our sampling approach was sufﬁcient to address our objectives. acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the numerous personnel in the department of wildlife and fisheries
