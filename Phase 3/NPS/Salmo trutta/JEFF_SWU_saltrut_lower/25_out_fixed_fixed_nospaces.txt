brenkman, corbett, & volk, 2007; moore, yeakel, peard, lough, & beere, 2014; northcote, 1997), diversity in age at maturity (moore et al., 2014; schindler et al., 2010), variation in spawning frequency (auer, 1999; brenkman et al., 2007) and diversity in age structure of populations (hellmair & kinziger, 2014; schindler et al., 2010). this so- called portfolio ef- fect (figge, 2004), where risks are spread among multiple life history types and cohorts, helps to buffer populations against changing envi- ronmental conditions, stochastic events, predation and exploitation (greene, hall, guilbault, & quinn, 2010; hilborn, quinn, schindler, & rogers, 2003; schindler et al., 2010). in order to conserve species ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:609–620. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff  |  609 © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd610  |     dehaan et al. figure 1 study location, the warner basin, oregon, usa. warner suckers were collected from twentymile, deep, honey and snyder creeks as well as hart and crump lakes. individuals were also collected from a refugial population in the summer lake wildlife management area (wma). the box on the inset map shows the location of the warner basin within the state of oregon with variable life histories, it is important that biologists and fisheries managers have an understanding of the unique requirements of the different life history types and how they interact to maintain popu- lation viability. effective conservation plans for these species typically require a variety of management actions spread across different habitat types and over different time periods. for example, many fish species have both stream resident and migratory life history types (northcote, 1997). conservation for stream resident fish may depend on main- taining favourable stream flows and temperatures (muhlfeld et al., 2012; petty, hansbarger, huntsman, & mazik, 2012; pierce, podner, & carim, 2013), whereas conservation of migratory fishes may be more dependent on maintaining migratory corridors and removing barriers (duda, freilich, & schreiner, 2008; hitt, eyler, & wofford, 2012; pess, mchenry, beechie, & davies, 2008; shepard, may, & urie, 2005). much of our understanding of life history diversity in fishes is based on studies of commercially and recreationally important salmonid spe- cies. however, life history diversity can be found in many fish species spanning a broad range of families, and many of these species have very different life histories and are found in very different environ- ments than salmonids. conservation plans will require species- specific data to adequately identify and address the requirements for main- taining existing life history diversity and to ensure long term popula- tion viability. the warner sucker (catostomus warnerensis) is an endemic catostomid found in the warner basin, an arid sub- basin of the great basin in south- eastern oregon and north- western nevada, usa. warner suckers inhabit the lakes and low- gradient stream reaches of the warner basin and the species has two distinct life history types: lake and stream morphs. the lake suckers exhibit a lacustrine–adfluvial pattern in which they spend most of the year in large lakes and presumably return to spawn in tributary streams. however, when upstream migration is hindered by low stream flows during drought years or by irrigation diversion dams, lake suckers may spawn in nearshore areas of the lakes (white, ramsey, stern, & munhall, 1990). the stream suckers exhibit a fluvial life history dehaan et al. pattern and spawn in major tributary drainages to the warner lakes. there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each life history type. warner suckers in the lakes have access to a greater forage base and can attain larger sizes, which presumably results in greater fecundity. however, the warner lakes have large popula- tions of introduced fishes that reduce recruitment of warner suckers by preying upon their young (u.s. fish and wildlife service [usfws] 1998). periodic lake desiccation also threatens the lake suckers. stream- type suckers inhabit a more stable environment with re- duced risk of predation. however, resources are more limited in the streams, and threats specific to the stream type include water with- drawals for irrigation and habitat degradation associated with graz- ing (usfws 1998). presently, the relationship between the two life history types is not well understood. it is presumed that suckers in the warner lakes originate mostly in tributaries, but the tributary of origin for these individuals is unknown. only limited movements of suckers between the lakes and the tributaries have been observed, and these are limited to observations of suckers which had been marked with passive integrated transponder (pit) tags in the lakes being later detected in the lower reaches of the tributaries (scheerer, clements, jacobs, & peterson, in press). although historically abundant, warner suckers have declined sub- stantially due to the impacts of predation by non- native fishes and the construction of irrigation structures in the tributaries (usfws 1985). as a result of these declines and the persistence of threats to the species, the warner sucker was listed as “threatened” under the u.s. endangered species act in 1985 (usfws 1985). a greater un- derstanding of population viability and the relationship between the two life history types is important for developing effective conserva- tion and management plans to help recover the species. the recovery plan for the threatened and rare native fishes of the warner basin and alkali subbasin (usfws 1998) outlines three criteria that must be met before delisting the species. these criteria require that (i) a self- sustaining metapopulation is distributed throughout the drainages of twentymile creek, honey creek and below the falls on deep creek, and in pelican, crump and hart lakes; (ii) passage is restored within and among these drainages so that individual populations of warner suckers can function as a metapopulation; and (iii) no threats exist that would likely threaten the survival of the species over a significant por- tion of its range. biologists recognise the importance of restoring and maintaining connectivity among lake and stream habitats so that warner suck- ers can fully express the diversity of life history types necessary for maintaining a functioning metapopulation. in this study, we used ge- netic data to assess the status of warner sucker populations and the relationship between the two life history types. the specific objec- tives of this study were twofold. first, we wished to determine the amount of genetic variation that exists within and among tributary populations of warner suckers. this information will be important for inferring the viability and conservation status of these threatened populations and for determining the amount of genetic exchange among populations. our second objective was to examine the rela- tionship between lake and stream life history type warner suckers.     |  611 a clear understanding of this relationship is crucial for prioritising conservation actions in the warner basin such as the removal or modification of barriers which limit movements between stream and lake habitats. 1.1 | study area the warner valley is a north-east to south-west trending endorheic basin in oregon, usa, that extends approximately 90 km (fig. 1). the elevation of the valley floor is approximately 1,370 m and the basin is bound by fault block escarpments, the warner rim on the west and hart mountain and poker jim ridge on the east. the warner basin was formed during the middle tertiary and late quaternary geologic periods as a result of volcanic and tectonic activity (baldwin, 1974). abundant precipitation during the pleistocene epoch resulted in the formation of pluvial lake warner (hubbs & miller, 1948). at its maxi- mum extent approximately 11,000 years ago, the lake reached ap- proximately 100 m in depth and 1,300 km2 in area (snyder, hardman, & zdenek, 1964; weide, 1975). presently, the basin consists of three permanent lakes, hart, crump and pelican, as well as several ephem- eral lakes, and several tributaries. the basin is characterised by rel- atively low annual precipitation, and as a result, water levels in the permanent lakes vary widely among years and periodically the lakes completely desiccate. streams in the warner basin are fragmented by an extensive network of irrigation diversions and canals that divert water for agricultural purposes (fig. 1). there are five fish species native to the warner basin: warner suckers, tui chub (siphateles bicolor), redband trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), northern (pit) roach (lavinia mitrulus) and speckled dace (rhinichthys osculus). the lakes also contain an abundance of intro- duced, non- native fishes including white crappie (pomoxis annularis), black crappie (pomoxis nigromaculatus) and brown bullhead (ameiurus nebulosus) that prey extensively on native species. within the basin, warner suckers are presently found in hart and crump lakes, and in the honey, deep and twentymile creek drainages. recent surveys in the warner basin tributaries documented suckers to be abundant and widely distributed (scheerer et al., in press). surveys in the warner lakes documented mostly older suckers and recent recruitment ap- pears to be limited to a single year class (scheerer et al., in press). a refugial population of warner suckers also exists in an irrigation canal in the adjacent summer lake basin (fig. 1). this population was established at the summer lake wildlife management area (wma) in 1991 during a drought that desiccated the warner lakes (white, ramsey, stern, & munhall, 1991). seventy- five adult warner suck- ers were temporarily translocated from hart lake to the irrigation canal and then subsequently moved either to dexter national fish hatchery in new mexico or back into the warner basin following the drought. prior to being moved out of the irrigation canal, adult suckers spawned and the offspring were the first generation of the current summer lake wma population. although the number of adults that initially spawned in the summer lake wma is unknown, the translocated adults were believed to be roughly 70% females and 30% males (white et al., 1991). 612  |     2 |  methods 2.1 | sample collection we used backpack electrofishers to collect suckers from twentymile, deep, honey and snyder creeks and from the summer lake wma irrigation canal. we collected suckers from 2006 to 2012 during studies designed to assess the current distribution, abundance and movements in the basin (richardson et al., 2009; scheerer, heck, gunckel, & jacobs, 2007; scheerer, jacobs, bratcher, swearingen, & kramer, 2008; scheerer, jacobs, & munhall, 2006; scheerer, jacobsen, et al., 2011; scheerer, jacobs, et al., in press; scheerer et al., in press). in honey and deep creeks, suckers were collected during a single year (2007) and collections were made over multi- ple years in snyder creek, twentymile creek and the summer lake wma canal (table 1). suckers collected from tributaries ranged in dehaan et al. size from approximately 50–335 mm. we used trap nets to capture warner suckers in hart and crump lakes. we sampled the lakes during april, may and june of 2006, 2008 and 2012. in 2010, we only sampled crump lake due to low water depth in hart lake (<0.5 m). suckers captured in the lake ranged in size from 50 to 450 mm. 2.2 | laboratory methods we extracted dna from all individuals using qiagen dneasy 96 blood & tissue kits (qiagen inc., valencia, ca, usa). we then geno- typed all individuals at 16 microsatellite loci previously developed for other catostomid species (table 2). we conducted polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) in 10 μl volumes containing 2 μl of template dna, 5 μl of 2x qiagen multiplex pcr master mix (final concentration of 3 mm mgcl2) and 0.2 μl of oligonucleotide pcr primer mix. final table 1 sample sizes and collection years for warner suckers analysed for this study. collection year collection location 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2012 total honey creek snyder creek deep creek twentymile creek summer lake wma crump lake hart lake 2 13 44 16 26 24 33 11 26 74 27 35 13 30 3 34 145 44 19 26 75 68 92 232 table 2 list of microsatellite loci and pcr conditions used in this study. the locus us4 was not part of a multiplex reaction. locus name multiplex name annealing temperature final primer concentration (μm) allele size range source rbs04 rbs20 xte1 xte10 dlu4105 dlu416 dlu4243 xte4 dlu26 dlu4184 xte12 xte6 dlu4183 dlu45 rbs23 us4 cwa4a cwa4a cwa4a cwa4a cwa5 cwa5 cwa5 cwa5 cwa6 cwa6 cwa6 cwa6 cwa7 cwa7 cwa7 54 54 54 54 57 57 57 57 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 0.10 0.10 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.05 0.10 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.05 275–425 225–350 125–200 275–325 125–300 125–400 80–175 275–300 150–375 150–300 150–225 325–400 125–275 275–425 225–425 150–325 w. wilson, usfws, personal communication 16 march 2015 w. wilson, usfws, personal communication 16 march 2015 turner et al.

(1999). we used a one- tailed wilcoxon test to determine whether collections showed evidence of a significant ge- netic bottleneck. oftentimes introduced populations show reduced levels of ge- netic variation and/or increased relatedness when compared to wild source populations (mock, latch, & rhodes, 2004; puckett et al., 2014; stephen, whittaker, gillis, cox, & rhodes, 2005). we compared levels     |  613 of genetic variation observed in the introduced summer lake wma population to levels of variation in natural populations of warner suck- ers to determine whether the introduced population had levels of vari- ation comparable to natural populations. we used wilcoxon ranked sum tests to determine whether there were significant differences in estimates of ar and hexp between summer lake and the four natu- ral origin tributary populations. we also calculated two separate es- timates of pairwise relatedness within each population to determine whether levels of relatedness in summer lake were equivalent to those in the natural populations. we first estimated queller and goodnight’s (1989) coefficient of relatedness (rxy) for all pairs of individuals in each population using the program spagedi (hardy & vekemans, 2002). this coefficient ranges from −1.0 to 1.0 with values greater than zero indicative of two individuals with above average relatedness (i.e. full and half siblings) and values less than zero indicative of two individuals with below average relatedness. next, we estimated pairwise r values using the maximum- likelihood approach implemented in the program mlrelate (kalinowski, wagner, & taper, 2006). values of r range from 0.0 to 1.0 with pairwise r values of approximately 0.5 representing two individuals that are full siblings or parent–offspring pairs, pairwise r val- ues of approximately 0.25 representing two half siblings and pairwise r values of 0.0 representing two unrelated individuals. we compared the distribution of both relatedness estimators among the five populations. we estimated the overall level of genetic variation among tributary collections (fst) and the associated 95% confidence interval (based on 1,000 bootstrap replicates) using the program fstat v2.9.3.2 (goudet, 2001). we also used fstat to estimate the level of genetic varia- tion among all pairs of tributary collections (pairwise fst). we used genepop to conduct contingency tests of allele frequency heteroge- neity to determine whether there were significant differences in allele frequencies among the different tributary collections. significance val- ues for allele frequency heterogeneity tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a sequential bonferroni adjustment. to examine the relationship among populations, we conducted a multivariate dis- criminant analysis of principal components (dapc; jombart, devillard, & balloux, 2010) of our allele frequency data using the adegenet pack- age (jombart, 2008) for the r statistical environment (r development core team 2015). dapc is similar to principle component analysis (pca) but unlike pca, which maximises the total variation in the data set, dapc maximises the variation among different groups and mini- mises variation within groups (jombart et al., 2010). we assumed that warner suckers collected in the lakes originated in the tributaries and we used genetic population assignments to de- termine the origins of these fish. in order to determine our ability to assign unknown origin individuals from the lakes to their tributary of origin, we first performed leave- one- out assignment tests of our base- line data set using the program geneclass2 (piry et al., 2004). for this analysis, individuals are removed from the baseline data set one at a time, the baseline allele frequencies are then recalculated without that individual and the unknown origin individual is assigned to its most likely population of origin. the number of individuals assigned to the tributary they were collected from provides an assessment of the ac- curacy of the baseline data set for assigning unknown origin fish to 614  |     their most likely population. this analysis relies on the assumption that the baseline fish were collected in their tributary of origin and were not migrants from another tributary. we conducted leave- one- out assignment tests using a baseline data set that consisted of individ- uals from deep, honey, snyder and twentymile creeks. the summer lake wma collection was excluded from the baseline since summer lake is a separate drainage and is not connected to the warner lakes basin. genetic assignments and the associated likelihood scores (rang- ing from 0.0 to 100.0) for individual assignments in the leave- one- out tests were determined using the methods of rannala and mountain (1997). following leave- one- out tests, we assigned unknown origin warner suckers collected in hart and crump lakes from 2006 to 2012 to their most likely population of origin using geneclass2. 3 |  results 3.1 | genetic variation within and among tributary populations prior to bonferroni correction, we observed three loci that deviated from hwe expectations in honey creek and two loci that deviated from hwe expectations in the introduced summer lake population. following bonferroni correction, we did not observe any deviations from hwe expectations. we observed the following number of locus pairs (out of 600 total) that showed evidence of linkage: deep creek— three locus pairs; honey creek—three locus pairs; snyder creek—zero locus pairs; twentymile creek—six locus pairs; summer lake wma— 14 locus pairs. we observed no clear patterns of linkage among loci; therefore, we retained all loci for subsequent analysis. estimates of genetic diversity did not vary substantially among the five locations (table 3). all estimates of diversity were lowest in honey creek (a = 6.56, ar = 5.78, hexp = 0.669 and hobs = 0.653) and all estimates of genetic diversity were greatest in deep creek (a = 8.25, ar = 7.70, hexp = 0.775 and hobs = 0.811). only twentymile creek showed evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck (wilcoxon test p < 0.001). when we compared estimates of allelic richness and ex- pected heterozygosity in the introduced summer lake population to the four natural populations, both estimates were significantly greater table 3 estimates of genetic diversity based on 16 microsatellite loci and p- values for one- tailed wilcoxon tests for evidence of a genetic bottleneck. diversity metrics are as follows: n—number individuals genotyped;

however, a number of fish from hart lake (88 of 232) were also assigned to honey creek (table 6). most fish collected from hart lake in 2006 and 2008 were assigned to deep creek, but in 2012, nearly equal proportions of individuals collected in hart lake were assigned to deep and honey creeks (table 6). likelihood scores for genetic assignments of fish collected in hart lake ranged from 58.6 to 100.0 and approximately 88% of genetic assignments of fish collected in hart lake had likelihood scores of 96.0 or greater (appendix s3). 4 |  discussion 4.1 | genetic variation within and among tributary populations information regarding the level of genetic variation within popula- tions is important when developing management and conservation dehaan et al. figure 2 distribution of pairwise relatedness values for five warner sucker populations. the top figure represents queller and goodnight (1989) pairwise relatedness (r) values and the bottom figure represents kalinowski et al.

reed & frankham, 2003). as a result, these populations may represent higher priorities for conservation. the ability to adapt to a changing environment is especially important for species such as the warner sucker that inhabit arid landscapes where water temperatures, stream flows and habitat availability can fluctuate widely from year to year, particularly in the face of anthro- pogenic disturbance and a changing climate (jaeger, olden, & pelland, 2014; sada & vinyard, 2002). given that warner sucker habitat has been extensively fragmented and populations have presumably de- clined from historical levels, we might expect relatively low estimates of genetic variation based on population genetic theory (allendorf & luikart, 2007). however, within- population estimates of genetic variation appeared moderate and were relatively consistent among populations, suggesting that no warner sucker population faces any increased risks associated with low genetic variation. furthermore, estimates of heterozygosity we report (roughly 0.6–0.8) were similar to those observed for a number of different catostomid taxa from across north america (bessert & orti, 2008; darden & tarpey, 2014; hopken, douglas, & douglas, 2013; lippe, dumont, & bernatchez, 2006; reid, wilson, carl, et al., 2008; reid, wilson, mandrak, et al., 2008). warner suckers are a relatively long- lived species with over- lapping generations (adults can live upwards of 20 years; white et al., 1991), and these life history traits have likely helped buffer popula- tions against severe declines in genetic variation. furthermore, pe- riodic connectivity among populations may occur during winter and 616  |     (cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78) (cid:43)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78) (cid:54)(cid:81)(cid:92)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78) (cid:54)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:47)(cid:68)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79) (cid:55)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78) (cid:58)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:36)(cid:51)(cid:38)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:89)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:21) (cid:58)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:36)(cid:51)(cid:38)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:89)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:22) dehaan et al.

dowling, marsh, kelsen, & tibbets, 2005; finger & may, 2015; garrigan, marsh, & dowling, 2002; lippe et al., 2006). one population, twentymile creek, did show evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck. recent surveys showed that twentymile creek had the greatest estimates of abundance and density compared to all other tributary populations (scheerer et al., in press), suggesting that although abundance remains relatively high, there has been a loss of genetic diversity in twentymile creek in recent generations. one key difference between twentymile creek and the other tributary popula- tions is that that warner suckers in twentymile creek are isolated from the warner lakes by an extensive network of irrigation canals and di- versions, whereas other populations still have some degree of connec- tivity to the warner lakes and to each other. population isolation and reduced gene flow has presumably led to a loss of genetic variation in twentymile creek. the loss of genetic variation has been repeat- edly documented in isolated fish populations (dehaan, brenkman, et al., 2011; meldgaard, nielsen, & loeschcke, 2003; neville, dunham, & peacock, 2006; wofford, gresswell, & banks, 2005; yamamoto, morita, koizumi, & maekawa, 2004), including other species of suckers (bessert & orti, 2008; reid, wilson, mandrak, et al., 2008). translocations and population introductions are often used to es- tablish refugial populations of threatened and endangered fishes in the event that natural populations are extirpated (george et al., 2009). refugial populations are often founded with low numbers of individu- als, which may result in a loss of genetic variation and/or genetic bot- tleneck (finger, parmenter, & may, 2013; mock et al., 2004; puckett et al., 2014; stephen et al., 2005). the refugial population in the summer lake wma was established during a drought in 1991 when hart and crump lakes completely desiccated (white et al., 1991). although this population has not been used to re- establish extirpated sucker populations, information on the level of genetic diversity in this population is important if the population is to be maintained and potentially utilised in the future. although the number of individuals initially introduced into summer lake wma is known, it is unclear how many of those individuals spawned before they were removed (white et al., 1991). estimates of genetic diversity did not differ significantly dehaan et al. between summer lake and three of the four natural populations, and the summer lake population did not show evidence of a genetic bot- tleneck. given the skewed sex ratio of the founders and the possi- bility that only a small subset of these individuals spawned, we might expect to observe increased pairwise relatedness in the summer lake population. this was not the case, however; pairwise estimates of re- latedness did not differ between the introduced population and the four natural populations. collectively, these data suggest that the amount of genetic variation in the summer lake population is similar to genetic variation in natural populations. it should be noted, how- ever, that the summer lake population remains isolated and will lose variation via genetic drift in future generations. managers may con- sider facilitated gene flow via periodic transfers of individuals from the naturally occurring populations to minimise this risk (frankham, 2015; tallmon, luikart, & waples, 2004). previous analyses have shown that the spatial scale at which genetic variation is partitioned varies widely among catostomids. whereas some species exhibit significant genetic variation within large river basins (dowling, saltzgiver, & marsh, 2012; mcphee, osborne, & turner, 2008; turner, osborne, mcphee, & kruse, 2015), within individual rivers (reid, wilson, carl, et al., 2008) or even within individual tributaries (smith, reid, godfrey, & ardren, 2011), other species exhibit relatively low levels of genetic variation across large watersheds (reid, wilson, mandrak, et al., 2008). warner suckers ex- hibited significant genetic variation among tributaries and even within tributaries (e.g. honey and snyder creeks), indicating that each of the four tributaries sampled represents a genetically distinct spawn- ing population. although genetic variation among stream- dwelling freshwater fish populations is often a function of geographic distance and/or stream hierarchy (dehaan, bernall, et al., 2011; hopken et al., 2013; taylor, gow, witt, & zemlak, 2011; turner et al., 2015), our data suggest that habitat and population characteristics shape genetic vari- ation among warner sucker populations. for example, although deep and twentymile creeks are geographically proximate tributaries both within the crump lake drainage, fst values and the dapc plot showed that deep creek was more similar to honey creek (a tributary to hart lake) than twentymile creek. as noted above, habitat in twentymile creek is extensively fragmented and the population is isolated from the warner lakes and other populations, whereas habitat in deep and honey creeks remains connected to the warner lakes and both popu- lations maintain a migratory life history component. 4.2 | genetic population assignments life history diversity in fishes helps maintain population viability by spreading threats and risks among different components of the popu- lation (greene et al., 2010; hilborn et al., 2003; schindler et al., 2010). warner suckers have evolved two distinct life history types and his- torically interactions between the life history types helped to maintain population viability in a changing, arid environment. prior to the cur- rent study, virtually no information existed regarding the tributary ori- gins of warner suckers in hart and crump lakes and the interactions between the two life history types. genetic assignment data showed     |  617 that all but two fish collected in crump lake and nearly two- thirds of fish collected in hart lake originated in deep creek. these data indicate that deep creek is the primary population producing migra- tory, lake- type individuals. presumably, large, highly fecund individu- als in the lakes can make a substantial demographic contribution to stream populations (blueweiss et al., 1978; kamler, 2005), they pro- vide a means for genetic exchange among populations, and they act as a demographic and genetic reserve in case of stochastic events that negatively impact stream populations (e.g. fires, landslides). in order to maintain the lake- type life history for warner suckers in the near term, it will be important to protect the population in deep creek and maintain the connection between habitat in deep creek and the warner lakes. the relatively low abundance of fish from honey, snyder and twentymile creeks in the warner lakes is presumably due to the pres- ence of numerous barriers in the lower reaches of these tributaries that limit connectivity between these populations and habitat in the lakes. conservation efforts for warner suckers have recently been focused on improving connectivity between stream and lake habitats and improving fish passage at existing irrigation structures in the trib- utaries (scheerer, peterson, & clements, 2014). the low abundance of honey, snyder and twentymile creek origin fish in the warner lakes suggests that the populations in these creeks would benefit from management actions that aim to increase habitat connectivity and fish passage for warner suckers. improved connectivity between stream and lake habitats and among populations is essential for maintaining a functioning metapopulation of warner suckers, as specified in the spe- cies recovery plan (usfws 1998). the 2012 sample from hart lake did contain nearly equal proportions of fish from honey and deep creeks. these samples were collected following a year with increased precipitation and stream flows in the warner basin, which resulted in less water being diverted from the streams for irrigation purposes. the absence of twentymile creek origin fish in the 2012 samples from the lakes, despite the high flow events the previous winter, may also indi- cate loss of the migratory life history from this population. these data highlight the fact that maintaining stream flows in the warner basin is important for maintaining connections between the streams and the lakes and for maintaining the life history diversity of warner suckers. this will likely become increasingly challenging in the future assuming that stream flow regimes change as predicted by climate change sce- narios for the great basin (chambers, 2008; pilliod, arkle, robertson, murphy, & funk, 2015) and anthropogenic demands for water in the great basin increase (sada & vinyard, 2002). three of the 164 baseline individuals were not assigned to their collection location during leave- one- out assignment tests. these in- dividuals may represent either migrants among baseline populations or they may have simply been mislabelled. all three of these fish were collected on a day when sampling crews only visited a single collec- tion site, making it unlikely that the wrong sampling location was re- corded for these fish. it is more likely that these individuals represent migratory fish that were collected in a tributary they did not originate from or that they are the progeny of migratory fish. data presented here demonstrate that warner suckers do migrate between hart and 618  |     crump lakes and pit tag data have documented movement from the lakes into the tributaries (scheerer et al., in press). deep creek and honey creek are hydrologically connected via the warner lakes and migration is plausible. connections between twentymile creek and deep creek presumably only occur during very high flows making mi- gration between these two tributaries less likely, although we cannot completely eliminate the possibility. furthermore, warner suckers are relatively long- lived and the individual collected in twentymile creek that assigned to deep creek (or perhaps one or both of its parents) could have migrated several years prior to collection when flows were much more favourable. 5 |  conclusions historically, life history diversity allowed warner suckers to persist in an arid environment where habitat quality and availability routinely fluctuated. declines in the species’ abundance due to habitat frag- mentation and degradation as well as the proliferation of non- native piscivorous fishes in the warner lakes during the last century led to the species being listed as a “threatened” species and the need for increased conservation measures. one of the primary recovery goals for warner suckers is the maintenance of a self- sustaining metap- opulation (usfws 1985). this implies that opportunities exist for migration and gene flow among populations (hanski & gilpin, 1991). however, genetic data presented here corroborate earlier findings based on pit tags and suggest that presently there is very limited movement and genetic exchange among populations (scheerer et al., in press). although the population in deep creek apparently main- tains a migratory life history component, the low abundance of fish from other tributaries in the warner lakes highlights the need for increased connectivity between the other tributaries and the warner lakes. recently, recovery actions have focused on modifying or re- placing ageing irrigation structures with structures that have fishways and screened diversions designed to reduce the negative impacts on warner suckers (scheerer, peterson, & clements, 2015; scheerer et al., 2014). additionally, management agencies may consider reduc- ing the abundance of piscivorous fishes in the lakes to increase sucker abundance and increase the number of potential spawners that have access to the tributaries. challenges associated with maintaining con- nectivity between stream and lake habitats will presumably increase in the future as changes in climate are predicted to result in reduced spring flows in the great basin (chambers, 2008; pilliod et al., 2015), which will presumably increase habitat fragmentation and lake desic- cation for warner suckers. acknowledgments funding for this project was provided by the u.s. army corps of engineers and the oregon department of fish and wildlife. we would like to thank the numerous biologists and technicians from the oregon department of fish and wildlife and bureau of land management who helped collect genetic samples used in this study;
