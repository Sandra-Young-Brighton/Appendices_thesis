(ii) fish caught at the river mouth (confluence with the klamath river, river km 0), tagged and released in the upper basin; and (iii) fish caught at the river mouth, tagged and released in the lower basin. fish released in the upper basin outmigrated later and at a larger size than those released in the lower basin. the traits of fish transplanted to the upper basin were similar to fish originating in the upper basin. chinook salmon juvenile life-history traits reflected habitat conditions fish experienced rather than those where they originated, indicating that habitat modification or transportation to new habitats can rapidly alter the life-history composition of populations. key words: chinook salmon; life history plasticity; klamath river basin; markrecapture; experiment introduction responses of salmon populations to changes in habitat may be mediated by changes in life histories (crozier et al. 2008). salmon populations with plastic juvenile life-history strategies can respond to anthro- pogenic alteration of freshwater rearing habitats with altered life-history composition or expression of novel life histories (hutchings 2004). these life-his- tory responses may contribute to the persistence of the population if the juvenile life-history response is adaptive in the altered habitat, or increase extinction risk if the life-history responses are not adaptive. thus, understanding how anthropogenic changes in habitat influence the life histories of salmon is a first step in determining the capacity for resiliency or recovery of a population in altered habitat (beechie et al. 1994). in this study, we evaluated the life- history response of juvenile chinook salmon oncor- hynchus tshawytscha to habitat conditions in two dis- crete spawning areas of the shasta river, a tributary of the klamath river in ca with a history of exten- sive habitat modification. chinook salmon have one of the most variable life histories of all the pacific salmon species. diversity in juvenile chinook salmon life history is well described (healey 1991), but the circumstances under which individuals express specific life-history trait variations are poorly understood. generally, juvenile chinook ocean-type (<6 months rearing in fresh water) or stream-type (>1 year rearing in fresh water) life history (healey follow either salmon an correspondence: c. m. roddam, department of fisheries biology, humboldt state university, 1 harpst st., arcata, ca 95521, usa. e-mail: meiroddam@ gmail.com 150 doi: 10.1111/eff.12265 1991). evidence of genetic divergence between ocean- and stream-type chinook salmon (carl & healey 1984; clarke et al. 1994; rasmussen et al. 2003) suggests that genetic differences may predeter- mine the life-history type of juveniles. however, there is considerable variation in juvenile life history within both ocean- and stream-type chinook salmon that is associated with the environmental conditions they experience (taylor 1990; beechie et al. 2006; sykes et al. 2009). for instance, temperature and food sources are strongly associated with juvenile growth rate (heming et al. 1982; taylor 1990), and variation in juvenile growth rate can significantly influence the timing of smoltification and outmigra- tion (beckman et al. 1998, 2003). juvenile life-history traits play an important role in chinook salmon population dynamics and manage- ment because they influence future survival and the timing of adult return (zabel & achord 2004; scheuerell et al. 2009). in particular, marine survival is strongly influenced by smolt size as well as the timing of ocean entry in relation to seasonal coastal ocean conditions at the time of migration (wedemeyer et al. 1980; holtby et al. 1990; duffy & beauchamp 2011). given the importance of juvenile life-history traits for populations, it might be reasonable to man- age freshwater habitat to enhance the expression of the life histories that are most likely to survive to become adults, or, in cases where degraded freshwater conditions preclude survival of juveniles, to transplant individuals to habitats that will produce desired life- history traits. either strategy requires that juvenile life-history traits are not entirely constrained by local- scale genetic adaptation to historic conditions the pop- ulation experienced, or, in the case of transplantation, by the environmental conditions experienced during earlier life stages. for such management, strategies to be successful would also require that the expression of desired life-history traits is not associated with poor survival through the juvenile stage. most juvenile chinook salmon in our study area in the shasta river exhibit an ocean-type life history, but there is a wide range in timing (mid-march to july) and size (50–100 mm) at outmigration. there are two primary spawning areas for chinook salmon in the shasta river: the canyon area in the lower basin (ca. river kilometre 0–12), and the big springs complex in the valley of the upper basin (ca. river kilometre 40–56; fig. 1). juveniles rear in both areas, but the habitats have dramatically different character- istics. the lower basin is characterised by high gradi- ent, a precipitation-dominated hydrograph with a strong seasonal influence of upstream irrigation with- drawals, and warm summer water temperatures due to low flows and irrigation return water (jeffres & moyle 2012). the big springs in comparison, juvenile chinook salmon life history fig. 1. map of the shasta river and influential tributaries, with dams (solid squares), cities (solid circles) and interstate hwy-5 (double line) shown for reference. the study sites of the upper and lower basin spawning and rearing areas are indicated by the dashed hollow circles. complex in the upper basin is characterised by low gradient, a more stable hydrograph influenced by both snow-melt and groundwater springs with less irrigation influence, and lower water temperatures in the summer. is the relative survival we addressed three primary questions in this study: (i) do growth, outmigration size and migration timing differ between chinook salmon from the upper and lower basin? (ii) are these life-history dif- ferences fixed among individuals born in each loca- tion? and (iii) what to outmigration of juveniles from the upper and lower basin? to answer these questions, we conducted mark–recapture field studies using passive integrated transponder tag technology (prentice et al. 1990). given the differences in habitat characteristics between the upper and lower shasta river basin, we predicted that juveniles that reared in the upper basin would outmigrate later in the season, have a higher total growth and outmigrate at a larger size. further- more, we predicted these life-history differences were not fixed, and instead were flexible dependent upon the habitat that fish reared in.

jeffres et al. 2009). the shasta river flows 97 km northwestward from its headwaters on the north slope of mt. shasta and in the eddy mountains, to its confluence with the klamath river. since 1926, dwinnell dam, located at river kilometre (rkm) 58, has blocked access to about 22% of anadromous fish habitat in the upper shasta river (nmfs 2012). air temperatures in the shasta river basin can range from  6 °c in the win- ter months to 37 °c in the summer months. in the upper basin, the upper shasta, has a total  1 in the winter to <2 m3s the shasta river meanders through the low-gradient (0.1–0.3%; nichols et al. 2010) shasta valley for 50 km, from dwinnell dam to approximately rkm 12 (fig. 1). stream flow in the main stem upper shasta river can range from ca. 6 m3s  1 in the sum- mer. big springs creek (bsc), an important tribu- tary of length of 3.7 km, from its spring-fed headwaters to the con- fluence with the shasta river at rkm 54. big springs creek is essential in providing year-round stable water flows to the main-stem shasta river. water temperature in the shasta river from the confluence with bsc to tens of kilometres downstream has an average tempera- ture range of ca. 15–17 °c in the summer months and ca. 5–8 °c in the winter months, due to the cool (10–15 °c) flows from bsc (jeffres et al. 2009). stream flow contribution from bsc into the shasta river averages about 2.3 m3s  1 during the nonirri- gation season, and about 1.5 m3s  1 during the irri- gation season (jeffres et al. 2009). temperatures and river (fig. 1). water in contrast to the upper basin, the lower 12 km of the shasta river, before it empties into the klamath (0.3–0.9%;

sutton & soto 2012). a small incision on the ventral left side between the pectoral and pelvic fins was made and a 9-mm pit tag (134 khz fdxb; biomark, idaho, usa) was manu- ally inserted into the body cavity. all pit tags and nee- dles were disinfected in bleach and then rinsed in distilled water prior to use. fork length was measured to the nearest 1.0 mm for each fish tagged. weight was not sampled due to equipment malfunctions in the field. fish were allowed to recover in an aerated bucket until normal swimming behaviour was observed. to minimise stress, fish were released into assigned loca- tions of the river the same day they were tagged. date of outmigration from mid-march through july for both the 2012 and 2013 tagging field seasons, date of outmigration at each location was determined using instream detec- tion stations in place in big springs creek and the main stem shasta river (allflex antenna systems; refer to fig. 2). when a tagged fish swam through an antenna system, the pit tag’s unique 15-digit number was recorded onto a solar powered data logger on shore, allowing movements of tagged individuals to be established. the direction of travel (upstream vs. downstream) was determined by serial placement of instream antennas or by the subsequent detection of a fish by an antenna system further downstream or juvenile chinook salmon life history upstream. we defined date of outmigration as the julian day when a fish was detected at rkm 0. a more detailed description of the antenna systems is given in adams (2013). a linear model that was fit included date of outmi- gration as the dependent variable, tag group and tag year as categorical independent variables, and fork length at tagging as a covariate, and analysed with ancova (type iii sums of squares). we used a post hoc tukey hsd test for a pairwise comparison of mean date of outmigration between tag groups. previ- ous years’ screw trap captures indicated that outmigra- tion of each cohort was complete by july. however, the antennas revealed that some fish remained in the upper basin through fall. fish that resided past july for either 2012 or 2013 were not included in the analysis of outmigration time as they appear to have had adopted a qualitatively different life history. we address these individuals in the discussion. apparent survival to outmigration was estimated using the r statistical software (r development core team 2012) and program mark (white & burnham 1999), to determine the estimated propor- tion of fish in each tag group that outmigrated by the end of july for each year. the two field seasons in 2012 and 2013 were analysed separately. for each tagged individual, an encounter history at rkm 0 was constructed. there were five capture events for 2012: the tagging event, and recapture events at the rkm 0 c antenna, rkm 0 b antenna, the rst at rkm 0, and rkm 0 a antenna (fig. 3). there were fig. 3. schematic showing the locations of the pit antenna arrays (lines perpendicular to shasta river) and the rotary screw trap (cone) on the shasta river at rkm 0. corresponding corma- ck–jolly–seber apparent survival (phi) and recapture probabilities (p) for each location are labelled, where p(location 1) is the tag- ging event. note: ‘pit antenna rkm 0 a’ was installed prior to the 2012 tagging season, and uninstalled prior to the 2013 tagging season. figure adapted from adams (2013). 153 roddam & ward four capture events for 2013: the tagging event, and recaptures at the rkm 0 c antenna, rkm 0 b antenna and the rst at rkm 0 (fig. 3). the antenna at rkm 0 a was uninstalled prior to the 2013 field season. for both years, survival (phi) between the rkm 0 b antenna and the rst at rkm 0 was assumed equal to one because the antenna arrays are only about 10 m upstream of the rst (fig. 3). in r, the package ‘rmark’ (laake & rexstad 2008; laake et al. 2012) was used to construct cor- mack–jolly–seber (cjs) models that were fit using the logit link function. the base model was phi(loca- tion)p(location), which allowed apparent survival (phi) and recapture probability (p) to vary between recapture intervals and locations. simple models were built with tag group and fork length at tagging as covariates in order to determine overall survival (phi) to outmigration and recapture probability (p) at rkm 0. for a more detailed description of the methods for the survival analysis, refer to roddam (2014). growth and outmigration size individual fish growth and size at outmigration were obtained through recapture of pit-tagged fish in the rotary screw trap (rst) at the mouth of the shasta river from mid-march through july for both the 2012 and 2013 tagging seasons. to determine the presence of pit tags, recaptured fish were scanned with a biomark fs-2001 or pocket reader ex. total growth was defined as the difference in fork length (in mm) between the date a fish was tagged and the date it was recaptured at the rst at rkm 0. two linear models were fit with either total growth or out- migration size as the dependent variable, and tag group, year, date of outmigration (julian day), fork length at tagging, and the interaction term of tag group and date of outmigration as the explanatory variables. for both models, an ancova (type iii sums of squares) was performed and a tukey hsd test was completed to compare mean total growth and outmigration size between tag groups. collinearity between tag group and date of outmigration was eliminated by centring date of outmigration on tag group (kreft et al. 1995). this allowed for the effect of date of outmigration to represent the difference between the date of outmigration of an individual and the mean date of outmigration of other individu- als in the same tag group. results the numbers of pit-tagged juvenile chinook salmon varied little between years for the t-ub and t-lb groups, but the number of tagged juveniles in the c- ub group was increased from 15 fish in 2012 to 191 fish in 2013 (table 1), due to differences in sampling techniques and increased sampling effort. mean fork lengths at tagging did not differ considerably among groups and the mean ranged from 56 to 57 mm (table 1). date of outmigration there were significant differences in date of migra- tion across our predictors (full model f4,461 = 57, p < 0.0001, mse = 279.5, r2 = 0.33). average date of outmigration for juvenile chinook salmon was 2.5–3 weeks later for the c-ub and t-ub groups than for the t-lb group (fig. 4; test for tag group effect: f2,461 = 104.5, p < 0.0001). fish that were larger at tagging tended to outmigrate earlier (slope estimate:  0.48; se: 0.15; f1,461 = 10.1 p = 0.002). on average, outmigration was later in 2012 than 2013 (f1,461 = 10.8 p = 0.001). post hoc tests indi- cated that mean date of outmigration differed signifi- cantly among all (all tukey hsd p < 0.05), but the upper basin releases (t-ub and c-ub) were more similar to each other than to can- yon releases (t-lb). travel time from the upper basin to the mouth of the shasta river does not explain the longer residence time of juveniles rearing in the upper basin, as the minimum residence time ranged from 1 to 2 days for all tag groups. tag groups the estimated proportion of tagged fish that outmi- grated by july was generally higher in 2012 than in 2013 across all groups (table 2). additionally, dur- ing the 2013 field season, the estimated proportion table 1. number of juvenile chinook salmon that were pit-tagged (sample sizes in parentheses are the numbers recaptured in hand as they outmigrated, providing growth data) and mean fork length (fl) in millimetres at tagging, in groups that were captured, tagged and released in the upper river (c-ub), and groups that were captured and tagged in the lower river and released in the upper river (t-ub), or to the lower river (t-lb), during both field seasons. c-ub tag years sample size 15 (1) 191 (28) 206 2012 2013 total 154 mean tag fl  se 55  1.3 57  2.2 t-ub sample size 315 (52) 200 (34) 515 mean tag fl  se 58  0.3 57  1.6 t-lb sample size 255 (28) 200 (39) 455 mean tag fl  se 58  0.4 59  2.2 total tagged 585 591 1176 that outmigrated by july was higher for the t-lb group than for the c-ub and t-ub groups (table 2). most fish not included in the estimate of outmigrants by july likely died prior to outmigration, so we treat these estimates as an index of relative survival to out- migration. however, nine survivors with very long residence times were detected residing in the upper basin after july and are not included in the survival estimate. growth and outmigration size there were significant differences in total growth (full model f7,167 = 66, across our predictors juvenile chinook salmon life history p < 0.0001, mse = 47.6, r2 = 0.73). in 2012, relatively high flows and low numbers of juveniles in the upper basin led to a small sample size in the c-ub group. of the 15 fish in the c-ub group that were tagged in 2012, only one was recaptured at the rst at rkm 0; thus, statistical analysis of growth and outmigration data for c-ub fish mostly includes recaptured fish from the 2013 field season. total growth from date tagged until outmigration averaged five times higher for the c-ub and t-ub tag groups, than for the t-lb group (fig. 5; test for the tag group effect: f2,167 = 93.8, p < 0.0001). in addition, fish that were larger at tagging grew less (slope esti- mate:  0.30; se: 0.11; f1,167 = 7.6, p = 0.006) and fish that stayed in the basin longer grew more (slope f1,167 = 125.5, estimate: p < 0.0001). average growth was less in 2012 than 2013 (f1,167 = 7.8, p = 0.006). the interaction between date of outmigration and tag group was not significant (f2,167 = 1.0, p = 0.36), indicating that the differences in total growth were associated with differences in residence time, not differences in growth rate among the tag groups or habitats. post hoc tests indicated that mean total growth of juvenile chinook salmon significantly differed between the t-ub and t-lb groups (tukey hsd p < 0.01), and between the c-ub and t-lb groups (p < 0.01), but mean total growth for the t-ub and c-ub groups was not significantly different (p > 0.05). 0.53;

test for the tag group effect: f2,167 = 93.8, p < 0.0001). fish that were larger at tagging were larger at outmigration estimate: 0.70, se: 0.11; f2,167 = 40.8, (slope p < 0.0001) and fish that stayed in the basin longer reached a larger size (slope estimate: 0.53; se: 0.05: f1,167 = 125.5, p < 0.0001). average size at outmi- gration was in 2012 than 2013 (f1,167 = 7.8, p = 0.006). as observed for the total growth analysis, the interaction between date of out- migration and tag group was not significant (f2,167 = 1.0, p = 0.36). mean outmigration size of juvenile chinook differed between the t-ub and t-lb groups (tukey hsd p < 0.01), and between the c-ub and t-lb groups, but mean outmigration size between the t-ub and c-ub groups was different (p > 0.05). slightly less significantly significantly salmon not discussion juvenile chinook salmon life histories in the shasta river environmental influenced basin are by fig. 6. boxplots showing range and medians (thick black bar) of outmigration fork lengths (mm, rounded to the nearest integer) for each tag group for both 2012 and 2013 field seasons. 156 juvenile chinook salmon that conditions, particularly by differences in habitat con- ditions between the upper and lower basin. in gen- eral, reared in the upper basin, where flows and temperatures are rela- tively stable, resided in the river significantly longer, had greater growth and outmigrated at a larger size than those in the lower basin, where flows and tem- peratures are much more variable due to upstream irrigation practices. this experiment demonstrated that the differences in juvenile life history were con- sistent among individuals released at the two rearing locations, regardless of whether they were captured there (i.e. the c-ub tag group) or were transplanted there (i.e. the t-ub tag group). this flexibility was particularly apparent individuals. small individuals that were captured as outmigrants at the mouth of the shasta river completely shifted life-his- tory trajectories after transplantation to the upper basin and often remained for many weeks and gained more than 20 mm in size before restarting outmigra- tion. the differences in size and time at outmigration that we documented may have long-term implications for postsmolt survival of juvenile chinook salmon entering the estuary and open ocean (zabel & achord 2004). for small in the shasta river, life-history differences between the upper and lower basin may be associated with a seasonal decline in habitat quality in the lower basin that potentially forces fish to emigrate. typi- cally by early summer, water diversions decrease shasta river discharge to 1.5 m3s  1 or lower and water temperatures in the lower canyon area can exceed the thermal preferences of juvenile chinook salmon. the upper basin does not experience the same degree of decreased stream flow and increased temperature, due to the cooler tributaries fed by groundwater complexes in the upper basin. conse- quently, juveniles in the upper basin can reside in the river longer, grow larger and outmigrate at a larger size – potentially increasing marine survival (zabel & achord 2004; scheuerell et al. 2009). however, fish with longer residence times still need to migrate through the canyon to reach the ocean. if late spring and summer migration conditions in the canyon (i.e. warm water and low flows) lead to lower survival for the upper basin fish with longer residence times, as suggested by our 2013 apparent survival data, then longer residence and growth in the upper basin may not in terms of increased adult returns. lead to a benefit the dissimilarities between years in the average date of outmigration and the proportion of juveniles that outmigrated by july (table 2) may be associated with differences in the flow regime for spring 2012 and 2013 (usgs gauge 11517500; usgs 2015). average date of outmigration was later in 2012 than in 2012, apparent survival 2013. further, to july outmigration was similar across treatment groups, but in 2013 the high growth-potential habitat in the upper basin was associated with reduced apparent survival. during spring 2012, stream flow decreased gradually from the start of agricultural irrigation on april 1, from approximately 10 m3s  1 to around 1.5 m3s  1 by late june. during spring 2013, stream flow decreased more abruptly from the start of agricultural irrigation on april 1, from approximately 6 m3s  1 to around 1.5 m3s  1 by late april. we surmise that the gradual change in conditions in 2012 allowed fish to stay in the basin longer than in 2013 and that fish that might have attempted to outmigrate after july 2013 may have experienced a water temperature ‘bar- rier’ in the lower basin, which was exacerbated by low stream flows. these fish may have been more vulnerable to predation and disease, leading to low survival, or they were forced to reside in the cooler spring-fed tributaries and main stem in the upper basin through summer and fall of 2013 and were not detected leaving. the plasticity of outmigration timing observed in this study suggests a continuum of life-history varia- tions within the freshwater rearing period of juvenile chinook salmon. volk et al. (2010) found a similar continuum of freshwater and estuarine life histories of juvenile fall-run chinook salmon through analysis of otolith microchemistry and microstructure. they found that while most of the juvenile fish entered the estuarine environment in the summer in the fry and parr size ranges, there were a few fish that entered the estuary in the fall at a much larger size (volk et al. 2010). this indicated that some fish in the volk freshwater et al. rearing period of >6 months, but than (2010) study exhibited a longer shorter that than a year interestingly, several tagged juveniles in the upper shasta river basin exhibited a rearing time duration longer than the 6 months typical of ocean-type juve- niles, but shorter is typical of stream-type juveniles. these fish were primarily in the t-ub and c-ub tag groups and were not included in the analysis of residence time due to the extremity of their outmigration times. for example, in the 2012 field season, eight fish resided through fall 2012, and one fish (from the t-ub group) was detected outmigrating in early march 2013, for a total residence time of 293 days. this individual evi- dently adopted a stream-type life history in response to being transplanted to a juvenile rearing habitat with suitable year-round conditions. finally, one fish from the 2012 t-can group was detected migrating up the shasta river in mid-october 2013. unfortu- nately, this fish was not recaptured in hand, but it presumably returned to the shasta river as an adult jack. juvenile chinook salmon life history 12 months. such life-history diversity could represent a bet-hedging strategy. despite their relative scarcity, large, late outmigrants could provide an alternative source of recruits when early marine survival is very poor for earlier outmigrants. however, without more information about survival at sea of the various life histories of juvenile chinook salmon, we cannot evaluate this hypothesis. consequences of overall, this study showed how plastic responses to spatial and temporal variation in habitat conditions can generate substantial life-history variation across rearing habitats for juvenile chinook salmon. the freshwater rearing habitat of juvenile chinook salmon in the shasta river basin is likely to undergo change, due to ongoing land use changes as well as habitat restoration efforts. the these changes for juvenile life history and population growth of chinook salmon in the shasta river are unknown. however, our results suggest that, depend- ing on the relative fitness of different life histories, life-history plasticity could mask pending declines in the population. for example, if the availability of suitable rearing habitat declines in the upper basin, total abundance of outmigrants could remain stable or increase as more fish emigrate early in life at a small size. yet, if small, early-emigrating fish have low marine survival, the long-term response would be a population decline. therefore, assessing the effects of habitat change on chinook populations will require monitoring that goes beyond characterising juvenile abundance to include life-history characteris- tics and the relative contribution of each life history to adult returns. acknowledgements funding for this project was provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
