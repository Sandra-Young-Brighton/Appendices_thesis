umezawa et al., 1988). the fact that daily rings are formed during the beginning of larval life and dur- ing post-larval stages could be demonstrated experi- this article was presented at the september 1994 session of the eifac/ices workmg group on eel, oviedo, spain. 102 mentally (umezawa et al., 1989; umezawa & tsukamoto, 199 1). this encouraged several authors to undertake countings of the daily rings of glass eels of several regions and development stages (tsukamoto, 1990; tzeng & tsai, 1992; guerault et al., 1992; yahyaoui, 1991), which were suggested to provide more knowledge on the features of the migration of the larvae from spawning ground to continent. in all these papers, the age of the glass eels is determined by the number of assumed daily rings that are fairly easily identifiable. outside this zone the morphological features are irregular. the onset of metamorphosis is speculated to be observ- able at the outer edge of the countable daily rings, i.e. at the beginning of a diffuse zone. the marine phase where this could occur is uncertain. the du- ration of the diffuse zone is also speculative. otolith rings in european eel otolith features are to be expected is answered from the geographical point of view by the inspection of the otolith microstructure of old and new larva sam- ples. material and methods twenty-six larvae of anguilla anguilla were cap- tured during a cruise at the end of may 1989 (tesch & niermann, 1991), and 85 larvae in october 1991 (antunes & tesch, 1996). the larval developmental stages were analyzed using the classification of ber- tin (1956): stage i - fully grown leptocephalus; stage i1 - pigmentation on the posterior end of the spinal chord; stage i11 - pigmentation on the nerve chord becomes more extensive, skin pigment also seen on the tip of the caudal fin; stage iv - pigmen- tation on the nerve chord reaches the head; stage va - metamorphosis complete, eel-like in form, no ex- ternal pigment except the caudal spot. right and left side sagittae were removed from these specimens. the dissected sagittae were cleaned of extraneous organic material, washed with distilled water, dried in air, and finally stuck in a pin-stub with shellack glue, convex side up. the otoliths were polished in the sagittal plane with 2400-mesh sand paper and aluminum paste until the core was revealed. after that, they were etched for 6 to 8 s with 0.5 solution of hc1 and placed for about 12 h in an oven at a temperature of 60Â°c, then coated with gold and viewed under sem (jeol jsm 35 c) at 25 kv. the microstructure of the otolith was analyzed from sem photographs. the sagittae radius is the biggest distance between the nucleus (primordium) and the edge. student t-test was used for comparing the width of the diffuse zones (dz) of different development stages. t1 fig. 1. otolith types and microstructure of eel larvae and glass eels. cz = zone of countable rings;

"anton dohm" on 18 and 19 novem- ber 1979 east of north america: one leptocephalus and 3 glass eels at 39'41' n 70'45' w, water depth 2000 m, distance from the 1000-m line about 20 km; one leptocephalus and one glass eel at 36'01' n 70'01' w, water depth 4450 m, distance from the 1000-m line about 300 km. discussion the question regarding in how many days dz zone could be formed is based on pure speculation. we refer to the thesis of the first author (antunes, 1994) otolith rings in european eel number of stations depth (m) negative positive <200 200-1 000 200-1 000 >loo0 <200

following the zone of countable rings (cz), a theoretical fur- ther narrowing of the rings is reasonable if the dif- fuse area (dz) were not produced. however, in- cluded in the diffuse area are some small fragments of ring structure and of narrower spacing of these "rings". if the small spacing of these rings is used for a calculation of the number of days in that area, the determination for a glass eel results in a mean age of 560 days. jansen (1991) calculated an age of 471 days; his calculating method was a little differ- ent; but both methods resulted in a higher age than that provided by the method of lecomte-finiger & yahyaoui (1989). the age of about 500 days is also favored by an- other speculation. the peak of spawning of a. an- guillu takes place in marcwapril, which can be as- sumed from the data of j. schmidt (cf. boetius & harding, 1985). the number of rings in the cz zone as counted by antunes (1994) is about 200. this number corresponds well with the number of days from spawning time to the beginning of winter (no- vember) with its decreasing water temperatures. by this time, the larvae also may have attained higher latitudes and subsequently, also lower temperatures. these events cause a drop in growth which is so strong that daily rings are no longer formed, but, in- stead of that the diffuse zone forms. this develop- ment is favored by the fact that growth slows down genetically, as the final size is soon attained and therefore also, during the next summer, faster growth is not resumed. if this genetic barrier did not exist, the ring development could perhaps be similar to that in the approximately 100-mm-long conger 105 antunes & tesch conger larvae we collected in the same sampling pe- riod at the end of may 1989. examination of the conger otoliths (antunes, 1994) showed that they exhibited daily rings from the nucleus to the margin and no diffuse zone. instead of the latter, a zone of more narrowly spaced daily rings can be observed about half way from the centre to the margin of the otolith. back-calculation to the beginning of the more narrowly spaced rings coincides with the be- ginning of the last winter. strehlow (1992) suggests a two-year larval life of the atlantic conger conger, and the final length and metamorphosis of this lep- tocephalus species are to be expected near a length of 150 mm and for the next spring or summer. in contrast with anguillu, the conger larvae, therefore, at the end of may, will expect further essential growth during the second summer and no develop- ment of a diffuse zone. an investigation of the otolith pattern of the conger eel as it will be later on, in or after the second summer and at metamorpho- sis, would therefore be interesting, also with regard to anguillu. a second phenomenon has to be mentioned (fig. 3): the smaller dimensions both of the countable area (cz) and of the diffuse area (dz) in combina- tion with smaller lengths of the larvae in the south compared with the larger dimensions and lengths (according to tesch & niermann, 1992; antunes & tesch, 1996) in the north. the answer seems to be easy: a smaller fish seems to have a smaller otolith, and perhaps also a lower age, provided the daily rings have the same width in both cases. the ques- tion is more difficult if we consider the theoretical zone of metamorphosis (m). in all development stages, it is larger in the south than in the north. it should be of the same size in both areas, because metamorphosis should, in both cases, be the same morphological process. an explanation for the dis- crepancy could be the method of calculation of the metamorphosis zone. the larger size of the m zone in the south could result from the small gwr zone (fig. 1) of stage i in the south, which formed the ba- sis for the calculation of the m zone. an explanation would be also that, for the final stage i, the gwr zone in the south is underestimated, because addi- tional growth of the otolith gwr zone of stage i leptocephali in the south takes place up to the begin- ning of metamorphosis (m). this could also mean that the final length of the southern stage i lepto- cephali had not been attained. the occurrence of metamorphosed eels far from the coasts of the continents has undoubtedly its bio- logical significance. how otherwise, could young eels ascend into inland waters of mid-atlantic is- lands, like the azores, which are situated at a point two thirds, or less, of the way from the spawning 106 grounds? this, on the one hand, requires that a cer- tain number of the eel larvae migrating in mid-at- lantic areas have to be in metamorphosis. on the other hand, glass eels keep the behavior of the lep- tocephalus stage, as is obvious from their diurnal vertical migrations (tesch, 1980; tesch & nier- mann, 1986). this behavioral flexibility is perhaps also observed in their horizontal migration. an es- sential part of the larvae population must, therefore, either be ready to settle on protruding parts of the continent or to continue migration when the conti- nent is far away. this flexibility is perhaps also mir- rored by the variable patterns of the otoliths or by the presence or absence of a transition or marginal zone. the age of glass eel ascending an estuary and the structure pattern of the otolith must be influenced by the metamorphosis position and the distance from the coast. this position is probably determined by the ge- netically fixed development time up to the comple- tion of metamorphosis whereby temperature and food can provide some source of variability. a glass eel can be 300 km from the continental slope or more. in addition, it may have to cover a further distance of 300 km to the coast. the mechanisms of migration over 600 km are unknown, at least for the decper ar- eas of the ocean. if the eel migrates actively and di- rectly by, for example, one or two fish lengths per sec- ond, which would result in 5 to 10 km per day, it has to endure a migratory time of two to four months. if it is drifted, it can perhaps move faster, but probably not on a direct course and more likely by zigzag or by curves, which requires time and results perhaps in a similar duration of the journey to the coasts as active movement. these imponderabilities should be taken into account when the duration of the total migration from the spawning grounds is calculated. resumen 1. otolitos de angulas y larvas de anguila, fueron colectadas en el rio mifio (portugavespafia) y en el talud continental de la bahia de vizcaya y fueron analizados con microscopia electr6- fica de scanning. en este trabajo presentamos datos preliminares sobre el radio total de 10s otolitos y la anchura de las zonas con estructura difusa que, en la literatura, es sugerida ser la zona de metamorfosis. 2. encontramos que el radio incrementa desde el estadio de de- sarrollo i y i1 hasta el estadio de angula vb. la anchura de la zona difusa tambien muestra un incremento. el calculo de las dimensiones de la zona difusa en individuos mayores que el es- tadio i revelaron que el irea de metamorfosis incluye entre el 28 y el 60% del total de la zona difusa. parece evidente que la parte de la zona difusa debe formarse durante la fase larvaria de creci- miento retardado durante la cuiil no se forman anillos de creci- miento diarios. solamente la p o r c h exterior de la zona difusa incluye metamorfosis. 3. por todas estas razones, la determinacibn exacta de la edad contando anillos diarios parece imposible. adembs, la determi- naci6n de la vida ocehica de 10s reclutas de anguila es dificil tambikn por la siguiente razbn: tanto 10s trabajos primigenios como 10s mis recientes indican que 10s lectocephali de anguilla y sus estadios de desarrollo no ocurren en el talud continental lo que puede aiiadir una cantidad de tiempo adicional hasta la lle- gada a la costa. acknowledgements we thank renate walker for assistance at the
