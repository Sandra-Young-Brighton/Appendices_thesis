durham university, durham, uk abstract – emigration is a widespread phenomenon among ﬁsh species in seasonal habitats, but little is known about the factors which trigger individuals to emigrate to new habitats. in controlled experiments using tilapia guineensis, a species widely occurring in the seasonal ﬂoodplains of west africa, density of ﬁsh played a signiﬁcant role in triggering ﬁsh migration, whereas a lack of food available caused an increase in exploratory behaviour but with no impact on successful emigration. the impact of ﬁsh density and subsequently interactions between individuals on emigration suggests that this may be an important causal factor of emigration in ﬁsh species exhibiting social interactions. key words: emigration; tilapia guineensis; seasonal

publication june 9, 2008 introduction the commonest behavioural migration is one of adaptations of animals living in seasonal environments and occurs in a variety of taxa including mammals, insects, birds and ﬁsh (kennedy 1951; wolff 1994; lucas & baras 2001; makrakis et al. 2007; castello 2008), but surprisingly, the factors which trigger individuals to emigrate to new habitats (taylor & norris 2007). emigration is deﬁned as a one-way movement from the home area (lidicker & stenseth 1992; dingle & drake 2007) and suggested cues that trigger this exploratory behaviour include unfavourable environmental conditions, lack of resources, predation pressure and intra- and inter- speciﬁc competition (bell 1991). little is known about the relative strength of the different factors which trigger emigration may vary between species and particular environments. the proximate food limitation hypothesis assumes that territories are only important as a mechanism of capturing food (marschall & crowder 1995), suggesting that only food availability truly determines the individual’s decision to migrate. by contrast, other studies suggest that a wider range of factors such as water temperature, ﬂow and cover availability can trigger ﬁsh emigration (mcmahon & hartman 1989; keeley 2001). under controlled condi- their tions mcmahon & tash (1988) recorded increased emigration rates of the desert pupﬁsh, cyprinodon macularius, in response to a doubling in densities and a consequent halving of available food and cover. keeley (2001) found both food and density, rather than either exclusively, to be important components of demo- graphic changes (emigration and mortality) in steelhead trout, oncorhynchus_mykiss. it is important to tease apart individual factors that inﬂuence ﬁsh migratory behaviour so that relative inﬂuence can be assessed. as a result of difﬁculties in isolating causal factors for emigration in the ﬁeld, it has been suggested that only well-controlled laboratory studies can identify the true signiﬁcant factors (mcmahon & tash 1988; matter et al. 1989; mcmahon & matter 2006). yet, these same experiments, on ﬁsh and non-ﬁsh taxa, have been mostly carried out on species which do not exhibit well-deﬁned seasonal migration patterns (mcmahon & tash 1988; matter et al. 1989; mcmahon & matter 2006). emigration behaviour is considered to be at least partly genetically determined (dingle 1980; lidicker & stenseth 1992) and, testing factors that inﬂuence emigration had to consider species adapted to seasonal environments. therefore, experiment floodplain habitats are highly seasonal and provide dynamic conditions, some of which may present threats to ﬁsh and in other cases, advantages. whilst 60 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00323.x ﬁsh may become concentrated into isolated pools or channels as water levels recede, ﬂoodwater also provides access to new habitat, which can be impor- tant for reproduction and ⁄ or feeding. exploitation of seasonal ﬂoodplains by ﬁshes may, therefore, be triggered by speciﬁc environmental conditions. the guinea tilapia, tilapia guineensis, is widely distrib- uted on west african ﬂoodplains (campbell 1987). it is the commonest ﬁsh species encountered on the highly seasonal gambia river ﬂoodplains, and readily colonises new habitats which become available during the rainy season (v. louca, unpublished data). although most cichlids have very limited migratory habits (hert 1992; lucas & baras 2001), this is not the case in cichlids living in seasonal ﬂoodplains habitat (benech & penaz 1995). while average guinea tilapia densities in inundated ﬂoodplain have been recorded )2 are not as 11 ﬁshæm uncommon and in ﬂoodplain pools densities of )2 can occur (v. louca, unpublished data). 500 ﬁshæm in this species, the strongest territorial behaviour is reproductive individuals which exhibited by adult defend small areas (campbell 1987), and this is consistent with cichlid behaviour in general interactions between siblings of juvenile cichlids start as simple physical encounters and avoidance and progress to elaborate lateral posturing and ﬁnally to strong sexual and dominance interactions (valerio & barlow 1986; keenleyside 1991). )2, densities of 40–70 ﬁshæm from conspeciﬁcs in which social this study examined, under controlled conditions, food availability and ﬁsh density in the role of emigratory behaviour of the tropical ﬂoodplain ﬁsh, the guinea tilapia. we hypothesised that exploratory behaviour leading to emigration would increase with elevated density and reduced food, because of increased competition for space and food resources. methodology study site and test ﬁsh the study was carried out at the medical research council’s ﬁeld station at farafenni town (utm coordinates: 1500200n, 435500e), the gambia, located in the southern sahel region and characterised by a single rainy season from june to october. it lies in an open ﬂat sudan savannah dominated by the gambia river and the highly seasonal ﬂoodplains which border it (svensson 1933; pages & citeau 1990). juvenile guinea tilapia were collected from local ﬂoodplains using cast nets in 2007. specimens were kept in large holding tanks for a minimum of 2 weeks to acclimatise the ﬁsh and accustom them to being fed on aquarium dried ﬂake food (tetramin, fed ad libutum). the total length of the ﬁsh collected factors triggering ﬂoodplain ﬁsh emigration varied from 5 to 7 cm, a range which represents nonbreeding individuals (v. louca, unpublished data). young guinea tilapia do not show any sexual dimorphism (paugy et al. 2003), so sexes were not differentiated in the study. emigration experiments six cement tanks were constructed under a shed with open sides so that the tanks would be exposed to the natural day ⁄ night variations in shade temperature and light, but prevent any changes in the water level of the tanks because of rainfall. each tank was divided into two parts, each 1.0-m long and 1.0-m wide, with a water depth of 0.75 m, and a connecting ramp in the middle (fig. 1). fish were placed on one side of the tank (a) and a clear tube (length 7 cm, diameter 3 cm) connected to the narrowing ramp (length 15 cm) (fig. 1), prevented return of ﬁsh which moved to the opposite side of the tank. following introduction of ﬁsh into the holding tank, the water level was raised using a hose pipe and kept constant at 0.5 cm at the ramp (about one-third of ﬁsh body depth), so as to make ﬁsh movement across the ramp challenging, so that only those individuals with sufﬁciently strong motivation to emigrate would do so (mcmahon & matter 2006). preliminary observations showed that tilapia readily approached and accessed the ramp and those which successfully traversed it did not return to the holding tank (cumulative increase in numbers in receiving compartment b and recorded no incidences of ﬁsh accessing the ramp via the tube). the effect tested with of ﬁsh density on emigration was )2), medium (25 ﬁshæm )2) and low high (40 ﬁshæm )2) density treatments, densities naturally (10 ﬁshæm encountered in the wild, all of which were fed standard aquarium ﬂake at a ration of 5% of ﬁsh biomass ⁄ day (legendre & ecoutin 1989). experiments lasted for 7 days and comprised 12 tank replicates per treatment. for the food treatment, 25 ﬁsh per tank were used for 1 m 1 m a 15 cm 30 cm 3 cm b fig. 1. experimental setup of the emigration test tanks. fish were introduced on side a (75 cm deep), and emigrating individuals moved across the ramp (water depth at the ramp, 0.5 cm) to side b. the clear tube at the end of the ramp stopped ﬁsh from moving back to side a. 61 louca et al. preliminary observations showed treatment and control groups. food (standard aquar- ium ﬂake, 5% of average ﬁsh biomass ⁄ day) was provided for the control group and no food was given to the treated group for the whole 7-day duration of each experimental round. there were 12 tank repli- cates each for the food and control treatments. that ﬁsh approached and traversed the ramp throughout the day, but the lack of light prevented night-time observa- tions. behavioural observations were therefore carried out daily between 14:00 and 17:00, for 90 min in one randomly selected tank per treatment and the explor- atory behaviour of the ﬁsh in that tank was assessed by counting the number of times ﬁsh moved onto the ramp (an individual ﬁsh exposing its whole body on the ramp). as the ramp was the area of the tank that became newly available at the start of the experiment, we con- sider an individual ﬁsh’s effort to move onto the ramp as a good indicator of increased exploratory behaviour. the total number of ﬁsh that crossed into the emigration section over 24 h was recorded daily at 17:00 from counts of ﬁsh in the emigration section of each tank. no mortality or loss of ﬁsh was recorded during the study. individual ﬁsh were used only once to avoid problems related to learned behaviour. statistical analysis the impacts of the density and food treatments on the number of ﬁsh which migrated and the number of attempted crossings were analysed using general estimating equations. this analysis extends general- ised linear models to account for repeated measures and clustering of samples as well as allowing for linear and nonlinear models (horton & lipsitz 1999). it was as tanks were repeatedly sampled daily, important to select a method which accounts for repeated measures. tank number was incorporated into the model as a repeated measures variable assuming an exchangeable correlations matrix. data were ﬁtted to a negative binomial distribution with a negative binomial link function as untransformed data followed a negative binomial distribution. all analysis was performed in spss version 15. results )2, with a relative odd’s ratio (o.r., the starting ﬁsh density in the holding tank had a highly signiﬁcant effect on the

resource availability as a driving force for emigration, but suggest social interaction to be a far more important factor (wolff 1994). however, others argue that resource availability, habitat use and social interactions and their effects on emigration are closely intertwined (mcmahon & matter 2006). cichlid ﬁsh are known to exhibit complex behavioural patterns with a variety of different interactions between individuals including juveniles (keenleyside 1991). in this study, high ﬁsh density was shown to be a primary factor triggering emigration. during the dry season, the gambia river are reduced to small water bodies with high densities of ﬁsh taking refuge in them (svensson 1933; v. louca, unpublished data). interactions between tilapias with established territories within those shrinking habitats and other individuals that ﬁnd refuge in them during the dry season is likely to be a major factor driving ﬁsh out on to newly ﬂooded areas at the beginning of the rainy season. the ﬂoodplains of these results show that a lack of food induces increased exploration (table 1), probably to ﬁnd food, but there is no indication in our experimental set-up that it triggers them to make the extra effort needed to negotiate a shallow-water conduit and emigrate to a new habitat (table 1). this ﬁnding is also in accor- dance with mesick (1988) who concluded that food is not a strong trigger of emigration in stream-dwelling trout. these processes may be considered in the context of a mechanistic model whereby the avail- ability of resources (e.g., food, cover, territorial space) affects the exploratory behaviour of individuals, such that elevated motivation of individuals and increased exploratory behaviour will lead eventually to emigra- tion (sale 1969; mcmahon & matter 2006). in this study, the exploratory behaviour for ﬁsh with and without food did not vary over time suggesting that food availability is a relatively weak motivation for ﬁsh to emigrate. emigration patterns in ﬁsh which occupy more permanent habitats, for example salmo- nids in streams and tropical ﬁsh in coral reefs are mostly well-understood. dominant ﬁsh hold territories and subordinate individuals exhibit increased explor- atory behaviour and emigration, with subsequent high costs for the emigrating individuals, which often move to areas of poor quality habitat where energy gain may be low and predation risk high (clarke 1970; larson 1980; marschall & crowder 1995; keeley 2001). however, low, substantial costs can also be involved for ﬁsh that do not emigrate (mcmahon & tash 1988), so there is a potential trade-off of ﬁtness costs and beneﬁts to emigration. in the case of species such as the guinea tilapia, which utilise seasonally ﬂooded areas, emi- grating into newly ﬂooded, high-quality habitat unoc- cupied by other ﬁsh and with few aquatic predators resource availability is local if factors triggering ﬂoodplain ﬁsh emigration can be expected to increase their survival chances (welcomme 1979; lowe-mcconnell 1987; lucas & baras 2001). in these habitats, emigration may, therefore be a characteristic of strong ﬁtness beneﬁt. acknowledgements this work was
