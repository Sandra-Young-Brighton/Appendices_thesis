bonneville power administration; oregon department of fish and wildlife; u.s. forest service abstract we examined growth in length of fluvial bull trout (salvelinus_confluentus) in the walla walla river basin, washington and oregon. our objectives were to quantify individual variability in growth; examine growth within and among years, life history forms, life stages and sexes; and estimate von bertalanffy growth parameters. individual variabil- ity was evaluated by modelling asymptotic length (l∞) and the growth coefficient (k) as random variables. all models were fit with bayesian methods and were evaluated for fit by the deviance information criterion. by incorporating individual variability, population- level estimates of l∞ and k appeared appropriate and estimated growth trajectories for specific bull trout fit individual observed patterns in growth. growth trajectories and positive correlation between individual estimates of l∞ and k suggest that some individuals grow at a faster rate and reach a larger maximum size than other individuals and those differences are maintained throughout life. selected models sug- gest that fluvial migrants have higher estimates of l∞ and k than residents, but there were only slight differences in parameter estimates among migrants from two adja- cent spawning populations in the walla walla river basin, as well as between males and females. growth rates increased for fluvial migrants after subadult emigration. individual variability in growth is consistent with the life history diversity assumed es- sential for bull trout population persistence. quantifying this variability is important for modelling population dynamics and viability to conserve this threatened species. k e y w o r d s bayesian, population demographics, salmonid, salvelinus_confluentus 1 |  introduction accurate and precise estimates of demographic parameters improve our understanding of basic ecology and provide inputs for the popu- lation modelling used in stock assessment and conservation (haddon, 2001; pardo, cooper, & dulvy, 2013). it is important not only to ap- propriately estimate expected values for demographic parameters, but also to quantify variability among individuals (lloyd- jones, wang, & nash, 2014; marco- rius, caballero, morán, & garcia de leaniz, 2013; pilling, kirkwood, & walker, 2002), as individual variability can impact assessment of population dynamics and viability (peacor, bence, & pfister, 2007; pfister & stevens, 2003; vindenes, engen, & saether, 2008). understanding and quantifying individual variability in somatic growth may be especially important for a species such as bull trout (salvelinus_confluentus) that exhibits life history variation and for which population viability modelling is needed to guide con- servation efforts (rieman & mcintyre, 1995;

howell, colvin, sankovich, buchanan, & hemmingsen, 2016; rieman & dunham, 2000), similar to other salmonids (billman et al., 2014; doctor, berejikian, hard, & vandoornik, 2014; zydlewski, zydlewski, & johnson, 2009). bull trout populations can be exclusively resident (i.e., no subadult emigration) or have a mix of resident and migratory individuals. populations with migratory life history forms can be fluvial (i.e., individuals move among riverine habitats; e.g., al- chokhachy & budy, 2008), adfluvial (i.e., individuals move between riverine and lake or reservoir habitats; e.g., johnston & post, 2009) or anadromous (i.e., individuals move between riverine and marine habitats; e.g., brenkman, corbett, & volk, 2007). there is considerable variation in the direction, distance and frequency of movement within and among bull trout populations (howell et al., 2016; starcevich, howell, jacobs, & sankovich, 2012). this variability has ecological consequences and is considered essential for bull trout population persistence (paragamian & walters, 2011; tyre et al., 2011). although considerable variability in life history and movement patterns has been documented for bull trout, variability in demographic rates has not been examined or quantified. analyses of somatic growth are often key components of fisheries modelling (pardo et al., 2013) and are specifically needed for modelling population viability of bull trout, a species listed as threatened on the endangered species act (esa). we analysed data from change in length over time of tagged fish and back- calculated length- at- age from fish otoliths to examine indi- vidual variability and patterns in somatic growth for two populations of bull trout in the walla walla river basin in oregon and washington (figure 1): mill creek; and the south fork walla walla river (sfwwr). each is a mixed fluvial spawning population (i.e., interbreeding resi- dents and fluvial migrants with migration that varies both spatially and temporally; homel, budy, pfrender, whitesel, & mock, 2008; howell et al., 2016). our goals were to quantify the extent of variability in growth among individuals and to produce appropriate growth param- eters for future population modelling. growth rates specific to indi- viduals will help us identify how individual life history differences (i.e., ﻿haaris et hal     |  105 table 1 total numbers of recaptured bull trout in the walla walla basin, by group, and the ranges of total duration at large (i.e., number of years between tagging and final recapture), fork length (fl) at pit- tagging (in mm) and the proportion of individuals recaptured and remeasured after multiple intervals at large group number tagged south fork presumed residents south fork migrants south fork presumed migrants mill creek male migrants mill creek female migrants 138 105 47 78 99 duration at large 0.9–5.1 0.04–4.7 0.4–4.0 0.8–7.5 0.8–8.1 fl at tagging number of times recaptured 1 2 3 87–464 0.96 0.03 4 0.01 5 6 7 8 159–645 88–584 138–532 142–541 0.82 0.81 0.40 0.53 0.17 0.19 0.23 0.11 0.01 0.14 0.15 0.15 0.07 0.04 0.07 0.04 0.04 0.01 0.01 migration, habitat use, etc.) may impact growth, and thus survival, fe- cundity and ultimately population persistence. this information can guide conservation efforts. also, if individual variability in growth ex- ists and is ignored, growth parameter estimates (eveson, polacheck, & laslett, 2007; sainsbury, 1980; smith, williams, & fisher, 1997; wang, 1998), as well as extinction risk and other population dynamics esti- mated from those growth parameter estimates (peacor et al., 2007; pfister & stevens, 2003; vindenes et al., 2008), can be biased. our specific objectives were to (i) evaluate and quantify individual variabil- ity in growth; (ii) examine patterns in growth within and among years, and in relation to sex, migratory life history and life stage; and (iii) esti- mate von bertalanffy growth parameters for future modelling. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | pit- tagging and recapture we collected and tagged bull trout from the sfwwr and mill creek populations (figure 1). collected bull trout were anaesthetised using ms- 222 (tricaine methanesulfonate), measured for fork length (fl) or total length in mm (which was later converted to fl; budy, epstein, bowerman, & thiede, 2011) and scanned for a passive integrated transponder (pit) tag. if no pit- tag was detected, the individual was tagged with an 11- to 14- mm or a 23- mm pit- tag (budy et al., 2011; howell et al., 2016). after tagging, each individual was allowed to re- cover until equilibrium was restored and was then released nearby. bull trout from the sfwwr population were pit- tagged and re- captured in the sfwwr spawning area, harris park to reser creek, june–august, 2002–2013, by the utah cooperative fish and wildlife research unit at utah state university and the u.s. fish and wildlife service (table 1, figure 1). sampling occurred during the seasonal pe- riod when both migrants (i.e., juveniles before subadult emigration and returning adults) and residents were present (al- chokhachy & budy, 2008). bull trout were collected by electrofishing, trap nets and angling (al- chokhachy & budy, 2008). in addition, subadult and adult migra- tory bull trout from the sfwwr population were tagged and recap- tured by the u.s. fish and wildlife service year- round, 2007–2013, by angling in the lower sfwwr below harris park and in the mainstem walla walla river (wwr) from the mouth of the sfwwr to the mouth of the wwr (figure 1). most of these bull trout were captured in the wwr between river kilometres 74 and 76, immediately south of the washington state line and upstream of other wwr tributaries (i.e., mill creek and the touchet river; figure 1) and were assumed to be part of the sfwwr population, although limited dispersal among populations occurs (koch, 2014). collection and detection of sfwwr pit- tagged individuals in spawning and wintering areas allowed for evaluation of growth as a function of life history type (i.e., migrant or resident) for the mixed sfwwr population. we assigned a life history type to each bull trout in the sfwwr population based on tagging location and movement patterns between tagging and final recapture following the methods of al- chokhachy and budy (2008) and homel et al. (2008). specifically, we defined bull trout tagged downstream of harris park as “south fork migrants.” most of these individuals were tagged in the wwr between rkm 74 and 76, indicating that they had emigrated from the spawning area, but were later detected in various locations in the wwr and sfwwr, including at and upstream of harris park. we considered individuals first collected in the spawning area upstream of harris park a combination of “south fork presumed migrants” and “south fork presumed residents.” an individual was defined as a “south fork presumed migrant” if it was later detected at a pit- tag an- tenna at harris park or at an antenna farther downstream suggesting emigration from the spawning area. a fish was defined as a “south fork presumed resident” if it was never detected or recaptured at or below harris park. individuals tagged on the spawning areas were assigned a “presumed” status, as our ability to detect migration past harris park (i.e., pit- tag detection probability) was less than 100%. recaptures less than 14 days after tagging were removed from analysis, as indi- viduals recaptured during this period were not always remeasured and removing these individuals reduced possible short- term impacts of handling, tagging and measurement errors on results. in addition, all individuals tagged and recaptured in the spawning area within just one spawning season were not included in analysis, as we could not classify their life history type. migratory bull trout in mill creek were pit- tagged and recaptured during 1998–2010 by the u.s. forest service during emigration from 106  |     and immigration to the spawning and juvenile rearing area (table 1, figure 1; howell et al., 2016). upstream migrating adults (≥270 mm fl) were collected in a hoop net as they exited a fish ladder at a di- version dam at the downstream limit of the spawning area; down- stream migrating fish (mostly subadults, <270 mm fl) were collected in a rotary screw trap located 0.5 km upstream of this dam. upstream migrants were scanned by ultrasound to identify sex and maturity (howell & sankovich, 2012). the trap for upstream migrants was oper- ated may to october in all years, while the trap for downstream migrat- ing fish was operated march to october in some years and year- round in other years (howell et al., 2016). data from pit- tagged bull trout in mill creek were used to examine subadult and adult growth of “mill creek male migrants” and “mill creek female migrants.” 2.2 | otolith collection and preparation up to 10 bull trout each year (2002–2011) in the sfwwr were meas- ured and killed by the utah cooperative fish and wildlife research unit for the collection of otoliths to assess age and growth. as oto- liths must be lethally collected, sample sizes were intentionally small for this esa- listed species. otoliths have not been formally validated to estimate age for bull trout; however, when compared to scales and fin rays, they are considered accurate and precise (zymonas & mcmahon, 2009). otoliths were mounted in epoxy and sanded to produce a cross section that included the core. annuli were counted under 16–20 × magnification and the distance of each annulus (i.e., the location of closely spaced circuli, as described by zymonas and mcmahon (2009)) from the core was measured using a leica digital image analysis system. the annulus count (i.e., assigned age) and dis- tance measurements were recorded along a trajectory selected as the clearest on each of three separate examinations. if the assigned age was the same for all three examinations, the otolith was included in analyses. if not, the otolith was examined and assigned an age once more. if three of four age assignments were the same, the otolith was included (n = 36 individuals) and the one alternate age was dropped. all otoliths not assigned the same age in three of a possible four reads were excluded from analysis. included otoliths were from individuals measuring 97 to 544 mm fl at collection and were assigned an age of 1–6 years. back- calculation was based on the measured distance from the core to each annulus using the direct proportion method, as oto- liths can be present at the time of hatch (klumb, bozek, & frie, 2001). back- calculated length- at- age was completed for each of the three examinations, which allowed us to separate measurement error (i.e., error in the measured estimate of fl- at- age) from process error (i.e., lack of fit to the selected growth model). these “south fork otoliths” were collected from individuals in the sfwwr spawning area; thus, life history type (i.e., migrant or resident) was unknown. 2.3 | analysis of growth within and among years we evaluated patterns in growth (δfl/δt) within and among years by regression using a subset of data from south fork migrants at large (i.e., a period in the natural environment between fl measurements) ﻿haaris et hal for 25% of a year or less. only data from south fork migrants were included as individuals were tagged and recaptured (and thus re- measured) throughout much of the year and could be used to evalu- ate growth within the year as well as among years (i.e., as individuals were collected and measured during different years). this subset of south fork migrants (n = 72) ranged from 162 to 645 mm fl (aver- age = 273 mm fl). relationships between δfl/δt and possible pre- dictor variables: median calendar day at large (i.e., the median month and day between mark and recapture) and the year at large, were as- sessed. we evaluated linear (bday), quadratic (b day3), relationships between median calendar day at large and δfl/δt. year at large (byear) was modelled as a categorical variable (n = 6 years ex- amined, 2007–2012). median day and year at large for this analysis started on the first of april and ended at the end of february. this corresponded to the timing of seasonal migration patterns (i.e., 1 april is an approximate transition between an overwintering period and a spawning period) and allowed all included bull trout to be assigned only 1 year at large. no individuals were recaptured after being at large during march. we also included fl at tagging (bfl) as a predic- tor variable to evaluate if, as assumed by the von bertalanffy model (haddon, 2001; quinn & deriso, 1999), δfl/δt linearly declines with increasing length. day2) and cubic (b we ran models including all possible combinations of predictor variables (table 2). models were evaluated by bayesian methods in jags software (plummer, 2003) called from program r (r core team table 2 deviance information criterion (dic) scores for regression models evaluating impacts of predictor variables on growth rate (i.e., change in fork length in mm per year) of south fork migrants at large for 25% of the year or less day 3 day 2, byear day day 3 day 2 day 2 day 2, b model parameters bfl, bday, b bfl, bday bfl, bday, b bday, b bday bfl, bday, b 2, b bday, b 2, byear bday, b bfl, bday, b 2, b (full model) bday, b 2, b bday, byear bfl, bday, byear bfl bfl, byear byear day day day day day 3, byear 3, byear pv 5.2 4.1 7.3 4.3 3.3 11.3 5.5 11.2 12.6 11.6 9.1 11.1 3.1 9.2 7.8 dic 831.7 833.3 834.7 835.3 835.6 836.1 837.5 838.3 838.7 839.5 840.5 841.9 848.9 856.3 871.9 δdic 0 1.6 3 3.6 3.9 4.4 5.8 6.6 7 7.8 8.8 10.2 17.2 24.6 40.2 bfl = slope for fork length at tagging;

the model with the lowest dic score (i.e., appropriate trade- off between fit and complexity) is se- lected. dic is commonly used in bayesian analyses (askey et al., 2007; spiegelhalter, best, carlin, & van der linde, 2014; zhang, lessard, & campbell, 2009). for analysis of growth within and among years, median calendar day and fl data were centred by subtracting their means, as suggested by mccarthy (2007) to improve convergence. vague prior distributions were used for all parameters. normal distributions with means of zero and standard deviations of 100,000 were used as priors for the in- tercept, year effects and slopes for median calendar day and fl. the prior distribution for model standard deviation was a uniform bound between 0 and 1,000. posterior distributions were estimated by three chains and 50,000 iterations using a burn- in of 10,000 and thinning of 40. rhat scores were calculated in program r and were less than 1.01 for all estimated parameters. convergence and parameter stabil- ity are often assumed when rhat scores are less than 1.1 (gelman & hill, 2007; kéry & schaub, 2012). 2.4 | hierarchical von bertalanffy growth modelling we assessed growth using the von bertalanffy growth model, which usually estimates three parameters: k (growth rate coefficient), l∞ (as- ymptotic length) and t0 (hypothetical age when length is zero) (haddon, 2001; quinn & deriso, 1999). this model is often used to describe so- matic growth of fish (chen, jackson, & harvey, 1992; quinn & deriso, 1999; smith et al., 1997), including bull trout (erhardt & scarnecchia, 2013; mochnacz, bajno, reist, low, & babaluk, 2013) and other sal- monids (kaeding & koel, 2011; vincenzi, mangel, crivelli, munch, & skaug, 2014). in addition, von bertalanffy growth models supply input data for modelling used for conservation and management (pardo et al., 2013). we assessed growth separately for five groups described above: (i) south fork presumed residents; (ii) south fork migrants; (iii) south fork otoliths; (iv) mill creek male migrants; and (v) mill creek female migrants. we excluded south fork presumed migrants from von bertalanffy growth analysis due to low sample sizes over most of the length distribution (see results). 2.5 | von bertalanffy modelling for mark–recapture data sets fabens (1965) transformed the standard von bertalanffy model which expresses mean length as a function of age to assess growth by change in length over time that can be used with mark–recapture data as op- posed to length- at- age data from an ageing structure. assumptions of the fabens (1965) method are that expected values of l∞ and k are the same for all individuals; however, when individual variability in     |  107 growth is high, estimates for these parameters can be substantially bi- ased (eveson et al., 2007; sainsbury, 1980; smith et al., 1997; wang, 1998). we evaluated a hierarchical extension to the von bertalanffy model developed by zhang et al. (2009) to incorporate individual vari- ability in growth when length of an individual (i) is measured at cap- ture and then after time- at- large in the natural environment (j) for our mark–recapture data sets by modelling l∞ and k as random variables: ̂ li,j = l∞,i × (1 − exp ( − ki × (ai + ti,j))) where ̂ li,j is the expected length of fish i at time j, l∞,i is the estimated asymptotic length of fish i, ki is the estimated growth rate coefficient for fish i, ai is the estimated age at tagging minus t0 for fish i and ti,j is the measured period (in years) at large for fish i between tagging and time j. each measured length (li,j) is from a normal distribution with mean expected length ̂ li,j and an estimated standard deviation (σ) rep- resenting model error, which includes both measurement error (i.e., error in measuring fish length) and process error (i.e., lack of model fit): li,j ∼ n( ̂ li,j,σ) each individual’s l∞ (i.e., each l∞,i) is assumed to be a random sample from a population- level normal distribution with mean ul∞ and popu- lation standard deviation of σl∞ representing variability in l∞ among individuals: l∞,i ∼ n(ul∞,σl∞ ) similarly, each individual’s k (i.e., each ki) is also assumed to be a ran- dom sample from the population with a population mean and standard deviation (i.e., uk and σk): ki ∼ n(uk,σk) 2.6 | von bertalanffy modelling for the otolith data set we examined growth by back- calculating fl- at- age for south fork otoliths using the standard von bertalanffy growth model adapted for individual variability in l∞ and k (alόs, palmer, balle, grau, & morales- nin, 2009; pilling et al., 2002): ̂ li,j = l∞,i × (1 − exp ( − ki × (tj − t0))) where l∞,i, ki and associated standard deviations were estimated in the same manner as for mark–recapture data. with back- calculated length- at- age data, t0 can be estimated in the model. also different from the mark–recapture models, measurements of length (li,j,z) for each individual (i) at each year interval (j) from each of the three back- calculations (z) were from normal distributions with mean estimated length- at- age ( į mli,j) for that individual (i) at that year interval (j) and an estimated standard deviation (σb) to account for measurement error associated with the back- calculation process: li,j,z ∼ n( į mli,j,σb) each į mli,j (i.e., mean length from the three back- calculated reads) was from a normal distribution with von bertalanffy model 108  |     expected length (̂ li,j) and an estimated standard deviation (σp) to account for process error (i.e., lack of fit to the von bertalanffy model): � mli,j ∼ n( ̂ li,j,σp) differentiating measurement error and process error allowed us to directly evaluate how well the growth trajectory for each individual fish fit the von bertalanffy model produced for that otolith. assuming back- calculated length- at- age is appropriate, patterns in process error were evaluated by nonoverlapping 95% credible intervals between į mli,j and ̂ li,j. 2.7 | evaluation of hierarchical von bertalanffy models to assess growth for mixed fluvial bull trout zhang et al. (2009) examined models in which both l∞ and k were modelled as random variables, as well as models in which only one of the two growth variables (i.e., either l∞ or k) was modelled as random and the other was fixed. eveson et al. (2007), punt, buckworth, dichmont, and ye (2009) and zhang et al. (2009) all found that similar, unbiased estimates could be obtained by mod- elling both l∞ and k as random variables or by just modelling l∞ as random (i.e., k was fixed). reasons for this require more study but could be related to the negative correlation generally observed between l∞ and k (punt et al., 2009; windsland, hvingel, nilssen, & sundet, 2013). similar to windsland et al. (2013), we did not want to overparameterise models, so we only evaluated individ- ual variability in l∞, k or neither variable (but not both) for south fork presumed residents and south fork migrants as more than 80% of individuals were only recaptured once (table 1). similar to vincenzi et al. (2014) for growth of marble trout (salmo mar- moratus), we evaluated models including individual variability in both l∞ and k for south fork otoliths, as well as mill creek male migrants and mill creek female migrants as at least 47% of those individuals were recaptured (and thus remeasured) at least twice ﻿haaris et hal (table 1). for models with individual variability in both l∞ and k, spearman correlations between l∞,i and ki were estimated includ- ing all individuals, as well as only individuals for which we had at least three fl measurements, as done by vincenzi et al. (2014), as they found that correlations between l∞,i and ki could be al- most perfect for individuals only measured twice. spearman cor- relations were considered significant at α = 0.05. for these three groups, we also evaluated von bertalanffy models in which either l∞ or k was modelled as random and the other was fixed, and mod- els in which both l∞ and k were fixed (i.e., no individual variability  in growth). similar to zhang et al. (2009) and tang, jia, and jones (2014), we used dic to select the best von bertalanffy growth model for each group. for south fork migrants and south fork presumed residents, we plotted estimated annual growth by fl at the start of the interval. annual growth was only estimated for individuals at large for a period of 0.5 to 1.5 years; estimates were made by dividing the change in fl over that period by the duration of the period. to visually exam- ine the fit of the dic- selected model, we plotted estimated annual growth for these individuals with expected growth from the dic- selected model. for south fork otoliths, mill creek male migrants and mill creek female migrants, we visually examined the fit of the dic- selected model by plotting expected individual growth trajecto- ries along with actual patterns in growth for some individuals recap- tured multiple times. 2.8 | analysis of von bertalanffy models prior distributions for von bertalanffy parameters (table 3) were selected to be uninformative in a similar manner to previous stud- ies (tang et al., 2014;

however, a similar comparison for south fork presumed residents suggests that the dic- selected model may have overestimated l∞ and underestimated k (figure 2). 3.2.2 | mill creek mark–recapture and south fork walla walla river otoliths for south fork otoliths, mill creek male migrants and mill creek female migrants, individual variability was modelled in both l∞ and k. in most cases, 95% credible intervals on standard error values for and σk) did not overlap zero, indicating the growth parameters (i.e., σl∞ individual variability in growth (table 4). when all individuals were included, l∞,i and ki were significantly positively correlated for south fork otoliths (ρ = 0.80, p < 0.01), mill creek male migrants (ρ = 0.58, p < .01) and mill creek female migrants (ρ = 0.77, p < .01). when only individuals with at least three fl measurements were included, ρ was lower, but still significant for south fork otoliths (ρ = 0.57, p < .01), mill creek male migrants (ρ = 0.34, p < .02) and mill creek female migrants (ρ = 0.54, p < .01). individual variability in either l∞ or k was included in the dic- selected model for south fork otoliths, mill creek male migrants and mill creek female migrants. while error associated with model fit (i.e., σ or σp) was generally similar among models with individual variability in l∞ and/or k, model error was substantially higher for models that did not include individual variability in either variable and 95% credi- ble intervals did not overlap (table 4), indicating a substantially lower model fit when individual variability was not included. for south fork otoliths, process error (σp) varied by model (i.e., indicating different levels of lack of model fit), but measurement error associated with back- calculation (i.e., σb) was the same for all models (as expected) and estimated to be 10.2 (95%: 9.4–11.1). for south fork otoliths, the model selected by dic had individual variability in l∞, although all models using otoliths had similar dic scores, despite large dif- ferences in parameter estimates, so the selected model should be evaluated with caution. for mill creek male migrants, the selected model included individual variability in k, whereas for mill creek female migrants, the selected model included individual variability in l∞ (table 4). growth trajectories of south fork otoliths from individuals that were 5 or 6 years of age at collection were examined for specific patterns in lack of fit and three patterns were observed: (i) variable growth rates by individual, but annual patterns were fit well by the ﻿haaris et hal specific model for that individual over the entire lifespan (most oto- liths); (ii) individuals that were larger in early years and smaller in later years than expected by the specific model fit for that individual (i.e., potentially some variability in k); and (iii) individuals that appeared to experience a higher growth rate between ages of two and four than expected by the best fit model for that individual (figure 3). this higher- than- expected period of growth occurred when individuals were expected to be between 188 and 422 mm fl and annual growth up to 119 mm fl per year was estimated. individual growth trajectories from dic- selected models for mill creek male migrants and mill creek female migrants fit observed patterns in annual growth for specific adults and illustrated the ex- tent of variability in growth among individuals (figure 4). in addition, dic- selected models fit growth trajectories for individuals collected at emigration as subadults and then collected annually after returning to spawn as adults starting 1.2–3.4 years after emigration, although there was potentially higher- than- expected growth for some indi- viduals during the subadult stage (i.e., between emigration and first spawn; figure 4). generally similar to south fork presumed migrants (figure 2), subadults in mill creek that were recaptured as adults were tagged at emigration at 138 to 215 mm fl (average = 168 mm fl) and were first detected to return as adults at 304 to 501 mm fl (aver- age = 382 mm fl). 3.3 | growth comparisons among groups selected models illustrated some differences in growth among groups (table 4). selected models suggest that mill creek male migrants have slightly higher population- level l∞ and k values than mill creek female migrants, although 95% credible intervals overlapped. estimates of l∞ and k for south fork migrants were slightly higher than those for mill creek migrants of either sex, but 95% credible intervals overlapped for both. selected models suggest that migrants from both popula- tions have slightly higher estimates of l∞ than south fork presumed residents and substantially higher estimates of k. the selected model for south fork otoliths suggested an l∞ close to that estimated for south fork migrants and a k value close to that estimated for south fork presumed residents. 4 |  discussion our results demonstrate that a hierarchical von bertalanffy model ef- fectively describes annual growth in length of mixed fluvial bull trout. similar to results in vincenzi et al. (2014) for marble trout and alόs et al. (2009) for painted comber (serranus scriba), our results suggest that some bull trout grow faster and reach higher maximum lengths than others, likely due to genetics, migratory life history form and habitat use. migratory bull trout exhibit fidelity to spawning and overwintering sites (bahr & shrimpton, 2004; starcevich et al., 2012; swanberg, 1997); thus, some individuals may continuously inhabit more productive areas for growth than others, leading to growth dif- ferences that are maintained for life. hierarchical von bertalanffy ﻿haaris et hal     |  111 table 4 posterior parameter estimates (with 95% credible intervals) and dic scores from von bertalanffy growth models for bull trout in the walla walla river basin, by group, with asymptotic length (l∞ or ul∞) and the growth coefficient (k or uk) modelled as either a fixed or random variable (i indicates that the variable was estimated as random) group and model σ or σp l∞ or ul∞ σl ∞ k or uk σk pv dic south fork presumed residents 19.9 (17.4–23.3) 18.0 (14.5–21.9) 10.5 (6.4–17.5) l∞, k l∞, ki l∞,i, k south fork migrants 576 (519–680) 543 (499–623) 496 (448–573) 78 (46–102) l∞, k l∞, ki l∞,i, k 13.4 (11.7–15.6) 5.4 (4.4–6.8) 6.0 (5.0–7.6) 666 (640–703) 655 (642–686) 552 (489–637) 135 (103–175) south fork otoliths l∞,i, k l∞,i, ki l∞, ki l∞, k 12.4 (10.4–14.9) 12.3 (10.2–14.7) 13.9 (11.8–16.6) 42.4 (37.6–48.4) mill creek male migrants l∞, ki l∞,i, k l∞,i, ki l∞, k 12.7 (11.1–14.8) 13.0 (11.3–15.1) 10.1 (8.7–11.9) 32.2 (29.0–36.1) mill creek female migrants 10.8 (9.5–12.4) 11.0 (9.7–12.7) 27.2 (24.8–29.9) l∞,i, k l∞, ki l∞, k l∞,i, ki 676 (552–985) 667 (545–854) 130 (93–202) 124 (88–178) 1,050 (838–1,192) 918 (602–1,185) 654 (639–672) 636 (610–669) 650 (627–675) 643 (612–688) 613 (587–642) 674 (661–689) 785 (733–853) 634 (609–660) 97 (78–120) 52 (34–73) 93 (78–112) 66 (43–89) 0.15 (0.11–0.20) 0.17 (0.13–0.22) 0.22 (0.16–0.28) 0.34 (0.29–0.38) 0.34 (0.29–0.37) 0.43 (0.34–0.53) 0.12 (0.07–0.16) 0.12 (0.09–0.16) 0.07 (0.06–0.09) 0.09 (0.07–0.17) 0.31 (0.27–0.36) 0.33 (0.30–0.37) 0.32 (0.28–0.36) 0.27 (0.21–0.32) 0.27 (0.24–0.30) 0.21 (0.19–0.24) 0.12 (0.10–0.14) 0.25 (0.22–0.29) 0.03 (0.01–0.06) 0.12 (0.10–0.15) 0.01 (0.00–0.02) 0.01 (0.01–0.02) 0.14 (0.11–0.17) 0.12 (0.09–0.15) 0.09 (0.07–0.11) 0.08 (0.06–0.11) 234 638 5,270 302 976 1,023 197 205 207 207 460 493 635 166 658 717 156 891 1,953 2,317 6,433 2,149 2,405 2,505 3,116 3,124 3,125 3,126 2,512 2,556 2,566 2,699 3,095 3,169 3,186 3,190 δdic 0 364 4,480 0 256 356 0 8 9 10 0 44 54 187 0 74 91 95 σ = model error for mark–recapture data sets;

howell et al., 2016) and effec- tively modelled growth trajectories for individuals (i.e., figures 3 and 4), suggesting that they can appropriately assess both population- level growth and individual patterns in growth for bull trout, especially if length measurements are obtained from individuals on multiple oc- casions over time. while individual variability in growth is consistent with the continuum of life history and movement patterns identified for fluvial bull trout, a hierarchical model has not previously been used to examine or quantify such variability for any bull trout population. quantifying individual variability in growth is vital to the assess- ment of population dynamics and conservation of bull trout for multi- ple reasons. first, examining variability in demographic rates can help assess how habitat availability and connectivity among habitats may impact population persistence. for example, identifying environmen- tal conditions and habitats that lead to high growth can help guide conservation efforts such as setting minimum flows or establishing corridors to ensure connectivity among important habitats. such information could potentially indicate how populations may respond to environmental alterations (e.g., temperature, flow) caused by cli- mate change. second, incorporating individual variability may be es- sential when it exists and mark–recapture data are used since ignoring it can lead to biased population- level von bertalanffy growth estimates (eveson et al., 2007; sainsbury, 1980; smith et al., 1997). although the von bertalanffy model without individual variability appeared to gen- erally fit observed growth of south fork migrants, observed growth of south fork presumed residents suggested that a model without individual variability overestimated l∞ and underestimated k, as re- ported in other studies (sainsbury, 1980; smith et al., 1997). selected models for south fork migrants and south fork presumed residents may not have included individual variability as most individuals were only recaptured once. finally, our results suggest that some individuals do grow faster than others throughout life and accounting for that variability (i.e., propagating that growth variation appropriately) is es- sential for population viability modelling (peacor et al., 2007; pfister & stevens, 2003; vindenes et al., 2008) and for predicting population viability under potential future environmental scenarios. inclusion of 112  |     (cid:12) (cid:80) (cid:80) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:47) (cid:41) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:22) (cid:23) (cid:24) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:22) (cid:23) (cid:24) (cid:25) (cid:36)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:92)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:12) ﻿haaris et hal figure 3 expected fork length- at- age (line) and estimated back- calculated fork length- at- age (circles) for south fork otoliths from selected individuals representing three patterns: (i) no apparent lack of fit to the expected von bertalanffy model (upper panels);

open white circles represent overlapping points individual variability in population viability modelling may also be crit- ical for small or threatened populations, which may be strongly im- pacted by demographic stochasticity (vindenes et al., 2008). long- term pit- tag monitoring programs have the potential to help identify how environmental factors and life history diversity affect population persistence without killing fish, which is important for an esa- listed species like bull trout. however, variability can be difficult to quantify for individuals that are recaptured infrequently (such as in the sfwwr) and where accuracy and precision of movement data are impacted by detection probability at antennas. we differentiated south fork presumed residents from south fork presumed migrants based on detection at harris park or an antenna downstream. it is un- clear how many individuals were misclassified, but misidentification could add variability and potentially bias growth estimates for south fork presumed residents. in contrast, ageing structures, such as oto- liths, illustrate annual patterns in growth within individuals; however, errors in annulus identification can bias growth modelling. to back- calculate length- at- age, the otolith must also grow proportionally to somatic growth, as observed for a salmonid with comparable resi- dent and migratory life history forms (aubin- horth & dodson, 2002). similar to mark–recapture, otoliths can be used to elucidate migration patterns with growth using microchemistry (campana, 1999). as oto- liths must be lethally obtained, a proper validation would not currently be appropriate for esa- listed bull trout. although not a validation, sim- ilar growth estimates from both independent methods, such as in our study, lend support to both the estimates and the utility of the study methods. our results suggest that growth in length increases for subadults at emigration in mixed fluvial populations. in both the sfwwr and mill creek, emigration occurred at about 150–200 mm fl and most indi- viduals did not return to spawn until reaching about 350–400 mm fl. some south fork otoliths similarly suggested an increase in growth between ages two and four at around 200–400 mm fl; these may have been migrants experiencing high growth during the subadult stage. in the skagit river, washington, an increase in fluvial bull trout growth occurred as individuals transitioned from the tributary to the mainstem (~age 3) and was associated with an increase in piscivory (lowery & beauchamp, 2015). additional analysis of growth during the juvenile stage (i.e., before emigration) in mixed fluvial populations is warranted. an increase in growth in length associated with subadult emi- gration suggests caution when evaluating length- at- age results from von bertalanffy models for migrants, as the model assumes a de- clining rate of growth with increasing fish length. a von bertalanffy model including a change in the growth coefficient at emigration for migrants or use of an alternative growth model with additional parameters may be required to accurately illustrate a length- at- age curve over the entire life span. models incorporating a change in growth at a certain size or age have been developed (alόs et al., 2009; armstrong & brooks, 2013) but would be difficult to imple- ment with our mark–recapture data as the migratory phase occurs over a range of sizes and times posttagging (bowerman & budy, 2012) and we do not have considerable recaptures of known mi- grants during all life stages (i.e., juvenile, subadult and adult). ageing ﻿haaris et hal     |  113 (cid:12) (cid:80) (cid:80) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:47) (cid:41) (cid:71) (cid:72) (cid:87) (cid:70) (cid:72) (cid:83) (cid:91) (cid:72) (cid:3) (cid:85) (cid:82) (cid:3) (cid:79) (cid:68) (cid:88) (cid:87) (cid:70) (cid:36) (cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:48)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:86) (cid:48)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:86) (cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:25)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:48)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:86) (cid:19) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:22) (cid:23) (cid:24) (cid:25) (cid:26) (cid:27) (cid:28) (cid:20)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:20) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:14) (cid:48)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:86) (cid:28) (cid:20)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:20) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:22) (cid:25) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:23) (cid:24) (cid:26) (cid:27) figure 4 model estimates for individual expected fork length- at- estimated- age −t0 (line) and measured fork length (fl in mm)- at- model- estimated- age −t0 (similar- coloured filled circle) for multiple individual bull trout from mill creek (greyscale indicates a specific individual). the left column includes actual measured fl values (i.e., circles) and individual model expected growth trajectories (i.e., lines) for all individuals that were captured as adults at least seven times;

johnston & post, 2009). males and females do not have similar energy allocation, maturity schedules or reproductive behaviour (johnston & post, 2009; nitychoruk et al., 2013). our von bertalanffy estimates for mixed fluvial bull trout in the walla walla river basin were similar to those for a migratory population in idaho (erhardt & scarnecchia, 2013) and growth appeared generally simi- lar to that in the skagit river in washington (lowery & beauchamp, 2015). however, migratory fish (fluvial and adfluvial) in canada reached older ages with higher estimates of l∞ and lower estimates of k (johnston & post, 2009; mochnacz et al., 2013), possibly indi- cating latitudinal differences in growth. also, growth models devel- oped for resident populations of small- bodied bull trout, as well as adfluvial and anadromous populations, would likely differ from our models of mixed fluvial forms. food resources, habitat selection and density (bahr & shrimpton, 2004; beauchamp & van tassell, 2001; johnston & post, 2009) may also play a role, with higher growth rates occurring under more productive conditions. growth varied within the year for south fork migrants, likely due to reproductive status, location in the system and environmental conditions. model selec- tion did not include year at large as a predictor variable in any highly ranked model, but we had small sample sizes for each year (i.e., 3–20 individuals) in our analysis. if a large enough sample of otoliths from older individuals had been collected, examining patterns in annual residuals (i.e., differences between expected length- at- age and mea- sured length- at- age for each individual within a year) could possibly indicate impacts. in conclusion, we produced estimates of von bertalanffy growth parameters for two spawning populations of mixed fluvial bull trout. our estimates are consistent with population characteristics and individual growth trajectories, suggesting that our field methods and hierarchical models appropriately estimated growth. similar hi- erarchical modelling of growth could benefit other salmonids that exhibit extensive within- population variation in life history such as 114  |     oncorhynchus_mykiss (doctor et al., 2014). our results suggest that modelling both l∞ and k as random variables can be productive to better understand individual variability in growth within a population, even if estimates and growth trajectories are effectively estimated by only modelling one variable as random. across taxa, growth in length is one of the most important life history traits (vincenzi et al., 2014) as it impacts spawning frequency, fecundity, survival and potentially habitat selection (johnston & post, 2009; marco- rius et al., 2013; pinto et al., 2013), and appropriate assessment of growth is essen- tial for population modelling (peacor et al., 2007; pfister & stevens, 2003; vindenes et al., 2008). our study identifies differences in growth as a function of migratory life history form and indicates that growth increases rapidly following emigration (i.e., when individuals become subadults) for migrants. however, the individual patterns ob- served on growth trajectories suggest that strict classification as “mi- grant” or “resident” may be too simplistic in mixed fluvial bull trout populations. acknowledgements many people helped with experimental design and fieldwork. we espe- cially thank robert al- chokhachy, larry boe, tracy bowerman, david buchanan, phaedra budy, alan hemmingsen, steven jacobs, howard schaller and gary thiede. figure 1 was made by david hines and erin butts. previous drafts were improved by comments from anonymous reviewers. funding was provided by the u.s. fish and wildlife service, bonneville power administration, oregon department of fish and wildlife and the u.s. forest service. references to trade names do not imply endorsement by the u.s. government. the findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the u.s. fish and wildlife service or the u.s. forest service. references al-chokhachy, r., & budy, p.
