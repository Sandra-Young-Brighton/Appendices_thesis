biomass and body size. ecology of freshwater fish 2011: 20: 74–79. ó 2010 john wiley & sons a ⁄ s abstract – as species introductions can result in increased resource competition for coexisting species in the receiving ecosystems, the effects of increased exploitative competition for limited food resources from an introduced ﬁsh (pseudorasbora parva) on a coexisting ﬁsh (cyprinus carpio) were tested experimentally using a substitutive–additive design. additive treatments revealed that the growth of c. carpio was signiﬁcantly suppressed following the introduction of p. parva with the magnitude of growth suppression directly proportional to p. parva density and biomass. a substitutive treatment that tested for the effect of intraspeciﬁc competition revealed that when c. carpio were introduced at a similar biomass to p. parva, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the extent of the suppressed growth. at the same density, however, the effect of c. carpio (higher biomass) on growth was signiﬁcantly above that of p. parva (lower biomass). this was independent of the initial body sizes of the introduced ﬁshes. thus, the interspeciﬁc competition imposed by p. parva was only as strong as the intraspeciﬁc competition of c. carpio when present at a similar biomass. j. r. britton1, j. cucherousset1,2, j. grey3, r. e. gozlan1 1centre for conservation ecology & environ- mental

environmental change, bournemouth university, poole, dorset bh12 5bb, uk; e-mail: rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk accepted for publication september 15, 2010 introduction ecological consequences of introduced ﬁshes include the adverse effects of increased competition for resources within the resident communities (rahel & olden 2008). these effects include reduced growth and ﬁtness in these coexisting ﬁshes resulting from asymmetric interspeciﬁc competition as the introduced ﬁsh may exploit common resources more effectively, be a superior competitor or be more numerous (ruetz et al. 2003). competitive processes include interfer- ence, where aggression excludes competitors with high resource monopolisation, and exploitative, where species with similar feeding modes and ⁄ or in the same trophic guild all have access to the resource and exploit resulting in reduced resource availability for individuals (connell 1983; schoener 1983). in assessing the impacts of intro- duced ﬁsh on the growth of coexisting ﬁshes, the it nonaggressively, consequences of effects of interference competition have been pre- valent; signiﬁcantly reduced growth has been mea- sured through the aggressive dominance of the introduced ﬁsh (marchetti 1999), the displacement of coexisting ﬁsh into inferior foraging sites (baxter et al. 2007), reduced foraging behaviour of coexisting species (lawler et al. 1999) and the disruption of dominance hierarchies (blanchet et al. 2007a). following an introduction, quantifying the effects of the increased interspeciﬁc exploitative competition on coexisting ﬁshes requires the assessment of their relative effects in relation to increased intraspeciﬁc competition. previous studies on a range of organ- isms and systems suggest that interspeciﬁc competi- tion is rarely stronger than intraspeciﬁc competition. for example, a review by connell (1983) revealed that where interspeciﬁc competition was found in experimental re- subsequent experiments studies, 74 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00460.x vealed it was only stronger than intraspeciﬁc com- petition in <25% of cases. although there have been a number of subsequent studies involving competi- tion in ﬁsh, including introduced ﬁshes (e.g. fausch 1988; weber & fausch 2003; blanchet et al. 2007a), there remains a lack of understanding of the relative effects of inter- and intraspeciﬁc exploitative compe- tition, particularly in relation to the body size of the competitors and despite this being a key ecological trait (schro¨der et al. 2009). this is because body size ultimately determines whether competing populations comprise of low densities of large-bodied ﬁsh or high densities of smaller-bodied ﬁsh (schro¨der et al. 2009; the inﬂuence of density, arim et al. 2010). thus, biomass and body size on the strength of inter- and intraspeciﬁc exploitative competition remains unclear. accordingly, to understand the role of density and inter- and biomass on the relative strengths of intraspeciﬁc competition in relation to the body sizes of the competitors, a range of experiments were designed using an introduced species and a coexisting species. these tested the strength of inter- and intraspeciﬁc exploitative competition through the analysis of their effects on the growth of the coexisting ﬁsh. the introduced species was topmouth gudgeon pseudorasbora parva (temminck & schlegel), a highly invasive, small-bodied ‘pest’ ﬁsh that has the ability to rapidly colonise new waters and establish high-density populations that generally exploit com- mon food resources (britton et al. 2009a,b). the coexisting species was carp cyprinus carpio l., a larger-bodied, strong exploitative competitor (koehn 2004; britton et al. 2010). it is also invasive in many parts of the world (e.g. zambrano et al. 2006) where populations tend to be less dense but of higher biomass than where p. parva is invasive (e.g. britton et al. 2007). these species are also increasingly occurring in sympatry in european waters (britton et al. 2009a). using an extended substitutive–additive experimental treatments increased the abundance of introduced p. parva and the substitutive treatment introduced c. carpio rather than p. parva (underwood 1986), the objectives were to i) test the strength of intra- versus interspeciﬁc competition in these two ﬁshes and ii) identify how the different density and biomass of competitors deter- mine the outcome of the intra- and interspeciﬁc experimental treatments. design, where additive materials and methods experimental design experiments were completed in 45-l tank aquaria arranged randomly on shelving with three tiers (top, exploitative competition from an invasive ﬁsh middle and bottom shelves) and completed at 20 °c under a 16:8-h light:dark regime. a control and four treatments were designed, each being replicated three times and starting with seven c. carpio (total mass: 68.1–74.5 g). the control had no p. parva added, whereas the additive treatments had p. parva intro- duced at varying abundances. these treatments were termed the ‘low abundance treatment’ (n = 3, 9.2– (n = 15, 10.1 g), 32.6–33.4 g) treatment’ (n = 30, 49.2–52.5 g). the ﬁnal treatment was sub- introducing c. carpio (intraspeciﬁc treat- stitutive, ment, n = 3, 32.9–33.9 g) the effect of adding the same number of individuals as the low abundance treatment and similar biomass as the medium abundance treatment and to test the differen- tial effects of inter- and intraspeciﬁc competition. ‘medium abundance treatment’ abundance to test and ‘high the experimental procedure required c. carpio to be individually tagged using passive integrated transponder tags, measured (fork length l, nearest mm) and weighed (w, nearest 0.1 g) at the start of the experiment (m0). feeding was then once per day using ﬂoating pellets (1.5 mm diameter; 28% protein, 3.5% oil) at ﬁxed rations of 1.5% mean starting body mass per day. these pellets were chosen as although c. carpio is generally a benthic feeder, a preliminary feeding trial revealed their high capability to feed on these pellets. moreover, the pellets were capable of being ingested by both species across their size ranges. the experiment then ran for 80 days to enable the growth of c. carpio to be determined in the absence of other competitors; at the end of the period, tag number, measured and weighed again (m1). the ﬁsh introductions into the relevant treatments were then undertaken, followed by maintenance of the ﬁxed feeding rations, and the experiment concluded after 60 days to allow re-measurement (m2). the ﬁsh were identiﬁed by their statistical analyses the effect of the treatments on c. carpio growth in the time intervals between m0 and m1 and between m1 and m2 was characterised using two growth indices: speciﬁc growth rate (sgr) and incremental fork lengths (il). sgr was determined from [(lnwt+1 ) lnwt) ⁄ t] · 100, where wt = total starting weight of c. carpio in the tank, wt+1 = total ﬁnish- ing weight of c. carpio in the tank and t = number of days between wt and wt+1. il was determined from (lt+1 ) lt) ⁄ t, where lt was the starting fork length, lt+1 the ﬁnishing fork length and t the number of days between lt and lt+1. for the two indices, values were determined for each ﬁsh per treatment and the mean per treatment with 95% conﬁdence limits. 75 britton et al. prior to testing the effects of the treatments on the growth of c. carpio, the relationship between growth in the period m0–m1 and m1–m2 was assessed using linear regression to test whether growth between these periods was independent. the effects of the treatments on sgr and il for each period were then tested using linear regression (to test for any relationship in growth between the periods) and ancova (to test for differ- ences in growth between treatments), where the effects of the c. carpio starting w and l (as measured at m0), and tank position, were controlled. a secondary analysis was then used to investigate the individual growth rates of c. carpio in the treatments, as their size distribution may have inﬂuenced growth through enabling the larger ﬁsh to compete more effectively for the food resources. correspondingly, the analysis was designed to test whether c. carpio of greater than the mean size experienced higher growth within each replicated treatment, with the converse for those individuals below the mean. as per seiler & keeley (2009), the ﬁrst step was to calculate the relative initial mass of each ﬁsh according to their initial mass (m0) divided by the mean mass (m0) of the ﬁsh in their tank. ancova was then used to compare the growth (sgr) of the individual ﬁsh in the two periods with their initial relative mass, where the effects of the treatments were controlled in the model. all statistics were completed in spss v.16.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) with signiﬁcance evaluated at a = 0.05. results control and treatments the overall effect of the growth of c. carpio in each tank between m1 and m2 was not signiﬁcantly related to that between m0 and m1 (sgr: r2 = 0.06; f1,13 = 0.77, p > 0.05; il: r2 = 0.05; f1,13 = 0.68, p > 0.05); thus, the growth was independent between the two periods. at m1, there was no signiﬁcant difference in sgr and il (fig. 1a,b). between the between m1 and m2, the treatments on the sgr and il of c. carpio was signiﬁcant (fig. 1c,d), but not the effects of the initial mean weight and length of the introduced ﬁsh and tank position (table 1). in the additive treatments, linear regression revealed that the magnitude of growth suppression was signiﬁcantly proportional to p. parva abundance (sgr: r2 = 0.98; f1,2 = 871.1, p < 0.01; il: r2 = 0.98; f1,2 = 260.7, p < 0.01; fig. 1). the pairwise comparisons with bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons from ancova revealed that the differences in sgr and il between the control and the medium and high abundance

signiﬁcantly different from the low abundance treat- ment where the same number of p. parva was added (table 1; fig. 1). hence, adding a similar biomass of c. carpio and p. parva had similar adverse growth effects on c. carpio, but not adding the same density. there was no effect of the initial relative mass on the growth rate of c. carpio (m0–m1: f1,97 = 0.87, p > 0.05; m1–m2: f1,97 = 2.13, p > 0.05), indicating that c. carpio that were smaller than the mean at the commencement of the experiments generally did not grow any less. there was also no inﬂuence of the treatments on this relationship (interaction term: m0–m1: f1,97 = 0.04, p > 0.05; m1–m2: f1,97 = 0.25, p > 0.05). discussion the additive treatments revealed that the consequence for c. carpio of p. parva introduction under limited food resources was suppressed growth through exploitative competition. although the extent of the suppressed growth was proportional with p. parva abundance, the medium abundance and substitutive treatments revealed that there were no signiﬁcant differences in its extent when a similar biomass of p. parva and c. carpio was introduced. by contrast, exploitative competition from an invasive ﬁsh when identical densities of p. parva and c. carpio were introduced (low abundance and the substitutive treatments), signiﬁcantly different growth effects were detected. thus, the interspeciﬁc competition imposed by p. parva was only as strong as the intraspeciﬁc competition of c. carpio when present at a similar biomass. these growth consequences were indepen- dent of the mean initial body lengths and mass sizes of the released ﬁsh. that the consequent growth impacts in the coexis- ting ﬁsh were independent of the introduced species and dependent only on their biomass suggests that impacts from exploitative competitors may be subject to general rules that exclude the inﬂuence of body size. indeed, the inﬂuence of starting size of c. carpio on their subsequent growth was not signiﬁcant – a contrast to the output of many studies on salmonid ﬁshes (generally interference competitors) that dem- onstrates that body size confers a signiﬁcant compet- itive through dominance, leading to higher growth rates (seiler & keeley 2009). this then shapes the life history of individuals, particularly their reproductive tactics (e.g. blanchet et al. 2007a; seiler & keeley 2009). thus, these profound individual inﬂuences of body size in salmonids may be relatively insigniﬁcant for exploit- ative competitors. larger ﬁsh, often advantage to whilst body size did not inﬂuence competitive strength in this study, in natural situations it remains a key determinant of population size (and hence biomass) through its inﬂuence on individual energetic demands and feeding rates, trophic position and life- history traits (schro¨der et al. 2009; arim et al. 2010). correspondingly, the introduction of a small-bodied ﬁsh that has r-selected life-history traits, such as p. parva, has substantial life-history advantages for their rapid establishment and the formation of abun- dant populations when compared to larger-bodied ﬁsh such as c. carpio (garcia-berthou 2007; britton et al. 2010; gozlan et al. 2010a,b). thus, body size may still play a signiﬁcant role in determining the impacts on the growth of coexisting ﬁshes, although it is likely to be an indirect inﬂuence that regulates the population growth and biomass of the introduced ﬁsh. it is therefore recommended that future work on the relative strengths of intra- and interspeciﬁc exploit- ative competition involving introduced ﬁsh incorpo- rates the role of body size in determining their rates of establishment and population growth and subsequent competition strength. recent ﬁeld investigations on invasive p. parva populations have demonstrated that when their highly abundant populations share trophic space with roach rutilus rutilus and c. carpio, suppressed growth occurs (britton et al. 2009a,b). however, these ﬁeld studies were conducted without replication and were 77 britton et al. length, likely to have been subject to some stochastic environmental variables, i.e. conditions were unable to be controlled. correspondingly, the design of these experiments using replication and highly controlled conditions (e.g. ﬁxed daylight temperature, space, food supply) enabled the collection of com- plementary experimental data on the ecological effects of invasive p. parva. thus, the consistency in the outputs of the experiments and ﬁeld studies in revealing the effects of invasive species on native species (e.g. blanchet et al. 2007b) is another impor- tant outcome given that studies on the effects of competition from invasive ﬁsh often ﬁnd experimental data do not necessarily match ﬁeld observations. this is generally because of experimental spatial con- straints resulting in unnaturally intense interactions and issues relating to scaling up experimental data to represent more complex natural situations (korsu et al. 2009). in summary, the interspeciﬁc competition imposed by p. parva was only as strong as the intraspeciﬁc competition of c. carpio when they were present at a similar biomass. notwithstanding, the introduction of such small-bodied ﬁshes remains of great concern because of their increased ability to rapidly establish and form pest populations of high biomass when compared with larger-bodied ﬁshes. acknowledgements the study was funded by the british ecological society (1066 ⁄ 1386). we thank an anonymous reviewer for their
