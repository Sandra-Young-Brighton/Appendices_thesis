(alexander 1977; heggenes & borgstrøm 1988; kruuk et al. 1993). the main ﬁsh-eating mammal in north european fresh waters is the european otter (lutra lutra l.) in its area of distribution. mink (mustela vison schreber) also feed upon ﬁsh, but to a smaller extent and of smaller sizes than otters (wise et al. 1981; dunstone 1993). otters are opportunistic feeders in that they feed upon whatever available prey (mason & macdonald 1986; taastrøm & jacobsen 1999). they show a preference for cyprinids and slower moving ﬁsh. but if available, they prey on brown_trout and atlantic salmon (carss et al. 1990; kruuk et al. 1993), although these might demand more energy to catch. danish rivers have been stocked with trout for almost a century (larsen 1972; rasmussen & geertz- hansen 1998). enhancement of recreational ﬁsheries was the purpose of the stockings. however, in recent years stocking has been increasingly used as a conservation tool, both to support native populations by stocking offspring of local wild ﬁsh and for the re-establishing of populations where the native popula- tions have been extirpated (rasmussen & geertz- hansen 1998). stocking has typically been conducted with hatchery-reared trout at the fry stage or as 1-year- old ﬁsh. in addition, stocking with older trout, such as smolts (i.e., trout ready to metamorphose to anadro- mous trout) and larger 1–2-year-old trout (17–30 cm) has been conducted. the latter was mainly performed because of requests from anglers to stock almost legal- sized ﬁsh (rasmussen & geertz-hansen 1998). it has been demonstrated that the mortality of stocked hatchery-reared trout is higher than for wild trout (e.g., bachman 1984; berg & jørgensen 1991). this difference is more distinct the longer the ﬁsh has remained in the hatchery, i.e., mortality increases for doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00076.x 59 jacobsen ﬁsh stocked at older life stages than fry (na¨slund 1992). thus, mortality of 1 and 2-year-old stocked trout (17–30 cm) is higher (na¨slund 1992; pedersen et al. 2003). differences in behaviour may explain differential mortality between wild and hatchery-reared trout. hatchery-reared trout exhibit reduced ability to cap- ture prey and to hold their feeding positions (bachman 1984). in addition, anti-predator behaviour may be poorly developed in hatchery-reared ﬁsh (maynard et al. 1995) and they have been shown to be more vulnerable to predation by birds (eklo¨v & greenberg 1998). as yet, the predation risk to stocked ﬁsh from mammals has not been examined, this study estimates the vulnerability of newly stocked large-sized hatchery- reared trout to otter predation. this was achieved by comparing a trout river and a river dominated by coarse ﬁsh in order to incorporate the effect of preceding dietary habits. this study was carried out in the river trend and the river skals (denmark). the present study comprises an estimation of otter diet before and after stocking of large hatchery-reared trout in the two rivers by means of spraint analysis. otter diet was compared with the ﬁsh population, as assessed by electroﬁshing and change in otter diet was monitored at short time intervals for 5 weeks after stocking. i hypothesised that following releases of hatchery-reared trout, otters will change their prey preferences and disproportionately predate on the newly stocked trout, because they are easy to catch immediately after stocking. materials and methods study areas reaches of river trend river trend is situated in the northern part of jutland, denmark. the study section of the river represents a 7-km section in the lower the river, approximately 3 km above the mouth into the lim- ﬁord. in the study area the river was partly regulated, but with some meandering sections. the river is 4.2–7.0 m wide and 0.5–2.0 m deep with variable speed of current. the substratum is mainly sand and silt, and more than 50% of the river bottom was covered by vegetation during summer, mainly spar- ghanium spp. and elodea canadiensis. the ﬁsh species consist of resident and anadromous brown_trout, three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus l.), eel (anguilla anguilla l.), ﬂounder [platichthys ﬂesus (l.)], [oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum)], and brook lamprey [lampetra planeri (bloch 1784)]. the riverbanks vary from overgrown with willow scrubs to open areas of cultivated ﬁelds. there is some angling activity in the area. rainbow trout 60 river skals rivers skals is situated in northern jutland, approxi- mately 30 km south of river trend. the study area comprised 5.5 km of stream 50 km from the mouth. in this study area, the river is 7–12 m wide and 1–2 m deep with small pools along the turns. the river ﬂows slowly with a uniform speed. the ﬁsh species were dominated by roach [rutilus rutilus (l.)] and perch (perca ﬂuvia- tilis l.) with pike (esox lucius l.), eel, gudgeon [gobio gobio (l.)], three-spined stickleback, bream (abramis brama l.), rudd [scardinius erythrophthalmus (l.)], resident and anadromous brown_trout and brook lam- prey occurring as well. in the study area there is very little angling activity, compared with river trend. stocking two size groups of hatchery-reared trout from egebæk fish farm were transported to holding facilities. total length (tl) and weight were measured and trout classiﬁed as ‘small’ or ‘large’. all trout were dye marked with alcian blue by a panjet inoculator, small trout on the left and large trout right side of the abdomen. trout trout were stocked in equal densities in the two rivers. in total 937 trout were stocked in river skals and 483 trout in river trend: on 7 october 1998, 470 ‘small’ [mean length 21.1 cm ± 1.4 (range 16–23.9), mean weight 94 g ± 17 (range 38–116)] and 449 ‘large’ trout [mean length 27.2 cm ± 0.9 (range 26–30.4), mean weight 202 g ± 20.5 (range 158–248)] were stocked in river skals. on 8 october 1998, 240 ‘small’ trout [mean length 21.3 cm ± 1.3 (range 18.0–23.9), mean weight 97 g ± 17 (range 41–123) and 243 ‘large’ trout (mean length 27.6 cm ± 0.8 (range 26.5–30.4), mean weight 210 g ± 18 (range 162–245)] were stocked in river trend. in both study sites all trout were stocked from a boat and distributed in homogenous densities along a 4-km stretch in the study section of the river. on 11 and 12 november, four 500-m stretches in both stocking areas were electroﬁshed to estimate the survival rate of previously stocked individuals. all recaptured ﬁsh were measured and weighed. population estimates of ﬁsh fish density and composition in the rivers were assessed by electroﬁshing in the study sites during the day before stocking. in river trend 10, 100-m stretches with 500-m intervals and one 500-m stretch of the river were electroﬁshed from a boat by use of 4500 w generator. in river skals eight 100-m stretches with 500-m intervals and one 500 m stretch were electroﬁshed. all ﬁsh were identiﬁed, counted, measured (±0.5 cm) and released back to the water. in both study areas, two 100-m stretches were electroﬁshed twice. catch efﬁciency was estimated for each species separately and for two size groups of trout. for some species too few individuals were caught to estimate catch efﬁ- ciency. this was carried out to estimate the total number of ﬁsh in the study areas using the catch depletion method according to bohlin et al. (1989). biomass of ﬁsh in the study areas was estimated from key length–weight relationships for eel (rasmussen & terkildsen 1979), stickleback (wooton 1976), roach (kleanthidis et al. 2000) and perch (huusko 1990). for river trend, trout equations were derived from length–weight measures from previous captures of wild trout (own data). the relative distribution of ﬁsh species, based on biomass, was calculated to compare it with the distribution of ﬁsh species in the otter diet. trout length distributions were compared with trout length distributions estimated from otter diets. brown_trout and rainbow trout were pooled (here- after categorized as trout) as they were not distinguish- able in the otter spraints. instead, trout in the river were divided into groups £ or >40 cm because otters did not predate on trout >40 cm in the present study. otter diet otter spraints were collected in both study areas the day before trout stocking and on days 2, 5, 8, 14, 26 and 33 after stocking. during all samplings both banks were searched thoroughly in the study areas, including an approximately 0.7–1.5 km stretch (depending on accessibility) of the river before and after the stocking areas, likely to be visited by an otter. on day 14 after stocking, the banks of river trend were ﬂooded because of heavy rainfall, preventing spraint collec- tion. spraints were frozen and stored for later analysis. in the laboratory, spraints were dissolved in a detergent solution for a week, and then washed through a 1-mm sieve and the remains analysed in a petri dish containing water. then the analysed spraints were dried and weighed. otter spraints contain the hard, indigestible remains of their prey. fish remains were identiﬁed to species or family by use of vertebrae and scales and occasionally by use of jawbones or otholiths, accomplished by key literature (webb 1976; conroy et al. 1993). remains of other prey such as frogs and mammals were identiﬁed from bones, hair or teeth. the importance of each prey item in one spraint was assessed using a bulk estimate, giving each item a score from 1 to 10 (wise 1980). all bulks were multiplied by spraint dry weight and the bulk score was summed for each prey item in all spraints to give the ﬁnal food composition. this method has been shown to provide accurate estimates of diet composition (jacobsen & hansen 1996). in order to determine length distributions of trout in the otter diet, the length of all trout vertebrae in the spraints were measured using a digital slide calliper. otter predation on stocked trout these vertebrae lengths were back calculated to fork length (fl) of ﬁsh using the mean equations by wise (1980) for either caudal or abdominal vertebrae. by use of minimum and maximum equations given by wise (1980), each vertebra was assigned to a ﬁsh length interval. the lengths of ﬁsh represented in one spraint were assessed by pooling all vertebrae, which could possibly come from the same ﬁsh, that were assigned to overlapping ﬁsh length intervals and record these as one ﬁsh. this represents a minimum because two ﬁsh or more of the same length, appearing in one spraint, would be recorded as one (carss & elston 1996). however, this is preferred instead of scoring each vertebra as a separate ﬁsh. fl of trout in the diet was recalculated to tl using length relationships (sigler 1951). all trout lengths were grouped in 3-cm intervals. i.e., statistics sampling analysed dates were differences in diet composition before stocking and subsequent by chi-square tests. for river trend, the chi-square test was run on number of occurrence data in a 6 · 4 contingency table. all minor groups of prey (eel, other ﬁsh, mammals, birds, insects and unidentiﬁed) were pooled to avoid <5 numbers (siegel & castellan 1988). for river skals the chi-square test was run on number of occurrence in a 5 · 2 contingency table, with sampling dates after stocking pooled. minor groups of ﬁsh prey (eel and pike) were pooled and frogs were pooled with other prey items (mammals, birds and crustaceans). trout lengths in the otter diet in river trend before stocking were compared with the ﬁve sampling dates after stocking (day 8 and 14 were pooled because of insufﬁcient data on day 14) through kolmogorov– smirnov tests. trout length distributions in river trend were compared with otter diet through jacobs index of preference (d) (jacobs 1974). this was applied to the proportions of ﬁsh of each length group. jacobs index varies from )1 to 1, with )1 being total avoidance, 1 being total preference and 0 being neutral. this index was estimated for the trout length distributions in river trend before and after stocking. the two series of to determine trends in preferences, if any. indices were tested (sokal & rohlf 1995) results river trend fish populations a total of 967 ﬁsh were caught by electroﬁshing 1500 m (7910 m2) of the river trend at the onset of the study period. trout (brown_trout and a few 61 jacobsen table 1. fish population of river trend. trout £40 cm >40 cm sticklebacks eel flounder number of ﬁsh caught 635 catch efﬁciency p estimated biomass in the area (kg) 0.86–0.90 266.4 13 0.86 65.9 fish biomass before 78.3 19.4 300 0.63 1.76 0.5 stocking (%) stocking of trout (kg) fish biomass after 74.4 82.2 stocking (%) 15.9 0.4 1 – 18 – 6.16 1.8 1.5 biomass in the study area was estimated by electroﬁshing, incorporating catch efﬁciency factors. all salmonid ﬁshes (brown_trout and rainbow trout) were pooled as trout (see materials and methods). rainbow trout) were the dominating ﬁsh (table 1). trout represented 97.7% of the estimated ﬁsh biomass, with 78.2% of trout £40 cm and 19.4% of trout >40 cm. other ﬁsh species, eel, stickleback and one individual of ﬂounder only represented 2.3% of the biomass, but 31% in numbers (mainly sticklebacks) (table 1). in total 74.4 kg, the stocking of 483 trout, trout £40 cm by increased the total biomass of 28%, but made only minor changes in the per cent of trout compared with other ﬁsh species. hence, trout £40 cm then represented 82.2% of the ﬁsh biomass (table 1). otter diet a total of 365 spraints were analysed from river trend: 108 spraints before stocking and 248 spraints after stocking. the number of spraints varied during the sampling period (table 2). before trout stocking, the otter consumed a variety of food items with a large proportion made up by sticklebacks (65%). frogs represented 16% and trout only 8% of the food composition. there was a signiﬁcant change in diet composition during the study period (v2 ¼ 46.8; p < 0.001). there was only a slight, nonsigniﬁcant increase in the proportion of trout in the diet 2 days after stocking (table 2). five days after stocking, the proportion of trout in the diet had increased signiﬁ- cantly along with a signiﬁcant decrease in stickleback (v2 ¼ 19.1; p < 0.001). this increase remained for the rest of the study period. the proportion of frogs in the diet also varied; a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of frogs compared with trout and stickleback occurred on the third sampling date after stocking (v2 ¼ 4.25, p < 0.05) (table 2). proportions and lengths of trout in the diet before and after stocking comparing the proportion of ﬁsh species in the river with the proportion in the otter diet (fig. 1) revealed that the otter retained a preference for sticklebacks, however, the preference for trout increased and trout constituted a mean of 48.6% of the ﬁsh in the diet (33.3% of the total diet) after stocking (fig. 1). length frequency distributions of trout before and after stocking were based on measurement of 553 vertebrae. the length distribution before stocking is shown in fig. 2a along with the length distribution of trout remains in the otter diet, as estimated from the spraints. 1+ trout, especially the group of 9–12 cm ﬁsh, dominated trout numbers in the river, followed by 21–24 cm trout. occasionally, trout >42 cm also occurred in the river but are not shown in the ﬁgure. the otter preferred 9–18 cm trout that constituted 63% of diet trout (fig. 2a). stocking of 483 hatchery trout into the river increased the number of trout by 7.9%. this did not change trout the increase was distributed with 0.6–3.5% among each of the length groups 18–21, 21–24, 24–27 and 27–30 cm (fig. 2b). length distribution in the river; the trout length distributions in the otter diet changed signiﬁcantly after stocking (kolmogorov– smirnov: dn ¼ 0.31, p < 0.01), towards most trout being preyed upon in the 15–27 cm length groups, with 18–24 cm trout being most represented in the diet (fig. 2b). fewer 9–15 cm trout were preyed upon. jacobs index (fig. 3) changed signiﬁcantly after stocking (runs test;

(1993) found that otters in scottish rivers may consume up to 60% of the annual production of juvenile salmon and trout. heggenes & borgstrøm (1988) assessed the effect of mink predation on trout and salmon parr in norwegian rivers, and found a strong correspondence between declines in trout/salmon density as well as injured ﬁsh and the presence of mink. recently, otters have been shown to feed on trout farms and on trout in rivers with stocking (ludwig et al. 2002). so far, no studies have explicitly focused on predation impact by otters on stocked hatchery-reared salmonids. composition of otter diet the two study areas represented different otter habi- tats, river trend being a typical trout river and river table 3. fish population of river skals. otter predation on stocked trout trout £40 cm >40 cm cyprinids perch pike eel stickleback number of ﬁsh caught catch efﬁciency p estimated biomass in the area (kg) fish biomass before stocking (%) stocking of trout total (kg) fish biomass after stocking (%) 3 – 2.75 1.1 134.98 34.85 5 – 21.54 8.3 1536 269 0.49 106.4 40.9 0.33 94.5 36.4 19 – 28.97 11.1 16 – 5.82 2.2 24 – 0.054 0.02 5.45 26.93 23.94 7.33 1.47 0.01 biomass in the study area was estimated by electroﬁshing, incorporating catch efﬁciency factors. brown_trout, sea_trout, and rainbow trout were pooled as trout (see materials and methods), all cyprinids (mainly roach, and a few rudd, gudgeon and bream) were pooled as well. table 4. the proportion of prey (%) in otter diet in river skals. day n cyprinids perch stickleback eel pike trout frog mammal bird crustacean before stocking 65 66.7 43 78.6 day 2 38 95.6 day 5 29 69.9 day 8 23 66.2 day 14 day 26 54 99.3 55 67.3 day 33 7.4 8.7 1.4 0.2 5.2 0.7 0.3 0.8 0.3 0.02 1.2 7.7 1.1 7.4 0.9 0.1 7.5 11.1 1.4 1.1 0.4 21.9 32.7 0.9 0.5 5.9 6.0 15.3 5.5 before stocking, the diet composition before trout stocking, followed by the diet on the subsequent sampling dates;

carss & parkinson 1996; jacobsen & hansen 1996). moreover, the number of sticklebacks in the river might have been under- estimated from electroﬁshing. hence, the preference for sticklebacks in river trend is believed to be somewhat overestimated, and the trout proportion concomitantly the results might show similar bias before and after stocking. underestimated. nevertheless, in river skals the preference for cyprinids com- pared with percids, resembled otter diet in rivers and lake-habitats in northern europe (mason & macdonald 1986; taastrøm & jacobsen 1999). cyprinids are also preferred over the spiny-rayed percids by other piscivores, e.g., pike (eklo¨v & hamrin 1989), as they are easier to swallow. predation on stocked trout in river trend, the proportion of trout in the otters diet increased after trout stocking. the increase was not apparent in the ﬁrst but on the second sampling, i.e., in the spraints defecated on the third or fourth night after stocking. trout can pass through otter guts in 1–5 h depending on activity level (carss et al. 1998), so trout remains will occur in spraints the following day. thus, it seems that the otter started exploring this new resource after a few days, supposedly having discov- ered the possibility of easier available prey. there was some variation in the diet composition after stocking, but the increment in the proportion of trout persisted to the end of the study period. before stocking the otter took most trout in the length interval 9–18 cm and avoided smaller trout between 3–9 cm in correspondence with previous found size preferences (e.g., kyne et al. 1989; taastrøm & jacobsen 1999). concurrently, with the increase in trout proportion in the otter diet there was a signiﬁcant shift in length distribution in the diet. there was clearly not only a disproportional raise in the otter intake of trout in the stocked trout length groups, especially the smaller trout of 18–24 cm, but also an increase in preference 65 jacobsen of the 24–30 cm trout. thus, the otter increased the consumption of the length groups representing the stocked ﬁsh to a signiﬁcantly larger extent than could be explained by the overall increase of ﬁsh in these length groups because of stocking. this sudden change in size preference, simulta- neously with the signiﬁcant increase in proportion of trout in the diet compared with other prey items, suggests that the increased consumption of trout was caused mainly by the newly stocked trout. the fact that otters took larger ﬁsh than they usually prefer, emphasize the vulnerability of the stocked trout, especially the 18–24 cm group. the use of vertebrae to back calculate ﬁsh length in dietary studies has been disputed as the equations are subject to some error because of the large variation in vertebrae along the column. carss & elston (1996) showed trout length (12.5 and 21.3 cm) to be under- estimated by 9–16% (i.e., 2–3 cm) by use of verteb- rae-ﬁsh length equations by wise (1980). jacobsen & hansen (1996) also showed some deviations for trout. some authors (feltham & marquiss 1989; carss & elston 1996) have recommended to use the atlas vertebrae of salmonids, these provide better correla- tion. however, this method depends on the appearance of this single key bone in the spraint. in the present study, there were very few occurrences of atlas vertebrae, so it was decided to use all vertebrae, despite the uncertainties. considering the reported underestimation by carss & elston (1996), the group of 18–21 cm ﬁsh should be converted to 21–24 cm ﬁsh and so forth, resulting in an even higher propor- tion of the stocked ﬁsh length groups appearing in the diet after stocking, but now with a higher proportion of ‘larger trout’ in the diet (see fig. 2b). thus, this methodological bias does not seem to interfere with the interpretation of the results. in river skals there seemed to be almost no otter predation on the newly stocked trout. although trout stocking increased ﬁsh biomass in the study area, otters continued feeding on cyprinids and percids. hence, the assertion that otters prefer cyprinids over salmonids (erlinge 1968) seemed to include hatchery reared trout. plausibly, otters, which are inexperienced with trout predation, are unlikely to change to this food source despite the conspicuous behaviour of hatchery trout, if there are sufﬁcient alternative food resources. other parameters such as water turbidity and river morphology varied between the two rivers and this may inﬂuence the predatory behaviour of otters as well. fate of the stocked trout after 5 weeks, 74% trout were estimated to have disappeared from the study area in river skals. this 66 was mainly the result of downstream migration, according to a radio telemetry study, that was carried out at the same time, to evaluate the fate of the stocked trout. seventy per cent (35 of 50) of the radio tagged trout left the area during the study period, and were recorded passing on automatic listening stations located above and below the study area. the down- stream migration was not recorded until 9 days after stocking, but after 2 weeks half of the radio tagged trout had left the study area. thus, the fact that otters did not prey on these stocked trout could not be the result of immediate trout migration out of the study site. although there was no or very little predation on stocked trout, some trout might have been eaten by otters further down the stream. two of the 50 radio tagged trout, migrating downstream, were probably preyed upon by otters, as the transmitters were found with chewing marks left, on the banks. in river trend, 42% of the stocked trout had disappeared from the study area, corresponding to the low survival found in a previous study in this river (pedersen et al. 2003). this is not likely to be explained by downstream migration as in river skals because a previous radio telemetry study in river trend had shown that only 8% (four of 50) of radio tagged newly stocked trout moved out of the area during 5 weeks (aarestrup et al. in press). instead, it is made obvious, that in this river, mammal predation is one of the operating mortality factors. this conﬁrms that otters were responsible for a large number of radio transmitters with carnivore chewing marks, which were left on the river trend banks, in the radio telemetry study by aarestrup et al. (in press). thus, the hypothesis that hatchery reared trout, stocked in natural rivers, are more vulnerable to predation than wild trout, not only from ﬁsh and birds, but also from mammals, seemed to be conﬁrmed. the fact that relatively more ﬁsh from the larger group 25–30 cm had disappeared, is inconsistent with the otters preying upon most 18–24 cm trout. this could partly be the result of underestimation of trout length in otter spraints (see materials and methods). however, it is also consistent with the general lower survival of ‘larger’ trout compared with ‘smaller’ stocked trout, found by pedersen et al. (2003), and further indicates that other mortality factors or migra- tory behaviour is more important with the larger size group of stocked trout. conclusions in conclusion, the present study shows that otters can be important predators on newly stocked trout. it became obvious that the food regime of otters in the local area of stocking might be determinant of the levels of otter predation on stocked trout. thus, hatchery reared trout stocked in rivers with sufﬁcient amounts of other ﬁsh species, preferred by otters, were not as vulnerable to otter predation, as those stocked in a typical trout river. nevertheless, most compensatory stockings are carried out in rivers that already hold a trout population. the results from river trend showed some impli- cations for the use of stocking in management and conservation of salmonid ﬁshes. first, in conservation programmes for endangered salmonid ﬁshes it is important to recognize the increased mortality, inclu- ding mammal predation, of stocked ﬁsh that have become adapted to hatchery environments. this mortality is lower for trout, stocked at younger life stages (na¨slund 1992). however, otter predation might still be considerable, if younger trout of 9–15 cm sizes are used in stocking programmes, because this is in general the preferred ﬁsh size for otters (mason & macdonald 1986). otter predation on stocked trout fry and yearlings warrant further research. secondly, the fact that otters are the most endangered mammals in temperate europe and hence protected in most of europe may complicate management in areas where stocking of large hatchery reared trout is an option. a critical assessment of stocking activities in areas inhabited by otters would therefore be beneﬁcial not only to the populations of salmonid ﬁshes, but also to otters, because potential conﬂicts of interests between otter conservation and conservation and enhancement of salmonid populations could be avoided. resumen 1. la predacio´n puede ser un factor importante de mortalidad en salmo´ nidos de rı´o. la mortalidad inducida por predacio´n ha mostrado ser mayor en truchas de repoblacio´ n criadas en piscifactorı´a que en truchas naturales debido a un menor ajuste al sistema natural. esta diferencia se hace mayor cuanto ma´s tiempo hayan permanecido las truchas en piscifactorı´a. este estudio tiene como ﬁn evaluar la predacio´n de las nutrias (lutra lutra l.) sobre ejemplares de repoblacio´n de trucha salmo_trutta l. criadas en piscifactorı´a, sobre la hipo´tesis de que, tras la repoblacio´n, las nutrias cambian la preferencia diete´tica para predar desproporcionadamente sobre las nuevas truchas en el rı´o. 2. trucha criadas en piscifactorı´a de taman˜os comprendidos entre 16 y 30 cm. de longitud fueron repobladas en dos rı´os daneses con diferentes poblaciones de peces. la dieta de las nutrias fue estudiada antes y despue´s de la repoblacio´ n sobre ana´lisis de 685 excrementos colectados regularmente durante un perı´odo de 35 dı´as. antes de la repoblacio´n tambie´n determinamos la composicio´ n de la fauna de peces en los dos rı´os con pesca ele´ctrica. 3. en el rı´o trend, un rı´o tı´picamente truchero (tabla 1), la proporcio´n de truchas en la dieta de las nutrias aumento´ de un 8% antes de la repoblacio´ n hasta un 33%, unos pocos dı´as despue´s de la repoblacio´n (tabla 2). adema´s, las longitudes de las truchas en la dieta cambiaron signiﬁcativamente hacia los otter predation on stocked trout grupos de taman˜o de las truchas repobladas, lo que indica que las truchas repobladas fueron preferidas sobre las truchas del rı´o (fig. 2). este cambio tambie´n ocurrio´ unos dı´as despue´s de la repoblacio´ n indicando que a las nutrias las llevo´ varios dı´as descubrir la presencia de este nuevo recurso disponible de presas (fig. 4). en el rı´o skals, dominado por ciprı´nidos (tabla 3), no aparecieron cambios en la dieta de las nutrias despue´s de la repoblacio´ n lo que supone que e´stas fueron ignoradas por las nutrias (tabla 4). concluimos en que el re´gimen alimenticio de las nutrias a escala local puede ser determinante de los niveles de predacio´ n de las nutrias sobre las truchas repobladas. 4. el efecto de la predacio´n sobre truchas de gran taman˜o criadas en piscifactorı´a no ha sido previamente documentado para las nutrias. sin embargo, la predacio´n de las nutrias deberı´a ser considerada junto a la predacio´n por peces piscı´voros y por aves cuando las repoblaciones se utilicen como medida para conservar populaciones de salmo´ nidos en peligro. una evalua- cio´n crı´tica de las actividades de repoblacio´ n en a´reas habitadas por nutrias seria beneﬁcioso para evitar conﬂictos de intere´s potenciales entre la conservacio´n de las nutrias y la mejora de las poblaciones de salmo´nidos. acknowledgements i gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the technical staff, colleagues and students at difres, especially n. sørensen for
