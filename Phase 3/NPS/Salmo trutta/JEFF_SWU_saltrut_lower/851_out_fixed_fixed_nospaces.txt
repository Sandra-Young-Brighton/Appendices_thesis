(2005) demonstrated that biomasses of these macrophytes positively inﬂuence ﬁsh assemblage attributes such as ﬁsh density and diversity. in spite of the positive aspects of biodiversity maintenance, egeria beds show high nuisance poten- tial and the authorities are concerned about future 10 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00121.x water quality and hydroelectric functioning (thomaz & bini 1999). therefore, understanding the role macrophytes play in structuring ﬁsh assemblages is fundamental when the aim is habitat management and biodiversity conservation (van nes et al. 2002; agostinho et al. 2003). in this sense, the present work is an observational ﬁeld research that contributes with much needed information regarding feeding ecology of ﬁshes associated with egeria patches in a neo- tropical reservoir during a wet season. explicitly, the patterns examined were (i) food items consumed, (ii) intra-speciﬁc diet variability, (iii) diel feeding activity, (iv) diet and feeding activity in patches of different biomasses, and (iv) inter-speciﬁc food partitioning. additionally, we discuss that resource availability may be one of the mechanisms aggregating ﬁshes in these patches. material and methods study area rosana is the last reservoir of a cascade in the lower paranapanema river (22°36¢s, 52°52¢w), a major tributary of the brazilian segment of the parana´ river system (the second longest river in south america). the reservoir has a surface area of 276 km2, is shallow (depth <10 m), has high water transparency (secchi depth varying from 1.0 to 3.5 m) and is oligotrophic. rosana reservoir is characterised by high macrophyte diversity (37 taxa; thomaz et al. 2005), but recently large stands of egeria have become ubiquitous in rosana and many others reservoirs of this system. these beds form patches of different areas and biomasses (1–530 g m )2 of dry weight, dw; peli- cice et al. 2005) in shallow areas (maximum depth usually <3.0 m). a map of the description of ﬁsh assemblage structure, as well as effects of plant density and diel period upon the ichtyofauna can be found in pelicice et al.

(2005). brieﬂy, macrophyte dry weight biomass )2) was calculated for each sample. all samples (g m were characterised as having low (1–70 g m )2; n ¼ 19), medium (71–200 g m )2; n ¼ 25) or high )2; n ¼ 15) macrophyte biomass. it was (200–530 g m not possible to evaluate dw biomass in dusk samples, so macrophyte biomass was visually categorised as low, medium or high. all ﬁsh captured were preserved in 10% formaldehyde, taken to the laboratory and subsequently identiﬁed, counted and measured (stand- ard length, cm). a general description of the sampling design is shown in table 1. after ﬁsh evisceration, stomach fullness was assessed by visual inspection and categorised as 0 (empty), 1 (1–25% of stomach volume occupied by food), 2 (25–75%) and 3 (75–100%). only stomachs with fullness 2 and 3 were kept for content analysis. contents were identiﬁed under stereoscopic micros- copy to the lowest taxonomic level. for each food item, volume (ml) was measured using graduated cylinders and millimetre-scale plates. diet characterisation analyses were performed only for (i) patches of medium and high macrophyte biomasses, because in low biomass habitats few individuals were caught (see pelicice et al. 2005) and most had empty stomachs, and (ii) for species with more than ﬁve individuals. the feeding index iai was calculated to characterise ﬁsh species diets (kawakami & vazzoler 1980), which combines total volume (%) and frequency of occur- rence (%) of each item (lowest taxonomic level). p iai ¼ fi  vi i¼1 fi  vi l data collection fishes were sampled at six sites in the reservoir during the wet season (january 15–21, 2003). three sites were located in euclides da cunha paulista district (n ¼ 28 samples), sa˜o paulo state (22°34¢07¢¢s, 52°33¢34¢¢w), and three in diamante do norte district (n ¼ 31), parana´ state (22°38¢29¢¢s, 52°47¢16¢¢w). at each site, a 1 m2 throw trap (1.5 m height) was used to sample ﬁsh in patches of e. densa and e. najas of different biomasses in littoral areas (depths <1.4 m). here, each throw trap procedure was considered as an independent ‘sample’ (an enclosed area of 1 m2), including ﬁsh and macrophytes trapped inside. a total of 59 samples were collected, distributed in three diel where fi is the frequency of occurrence of item i (%), vi is the relative volume of item i (% of total) and l is the number of items. for

(tei), unidentiﬁed arthro- pods (art), ﬁsh ﬁns (fin), ﬁsh scales (sca), sediment (sed) and detritus (det). because ostra- coda, cladocera and copepoda were the main items consumed by almost all species, they were not pooled. intra-speciﬁc diet variability iai calculations are useful in providing a general description of species diet. however, these values have a great potential to give misleading conclusions, as they do not measure any variability existent in the diet among individuals (to characterise diet, volumes from all individuals are pooled by food item). for this reason, an overlap index was used as a measure of intra-speciﬁc diet variability. using the software ecosim v7.2 (gotelli & entsminger 2001), pianka’s overlap index (pianka 1973) was calculated between all individuals of the same species using the matrix of volume in percentage: q o12 ¼ p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ i¼1 pi2  pi1 p i2þ  ðp 2 i¼1 ðp 2 i1þ l l where pi2 is the % volume of item i in the diet of individual 2 and pi1 is the % volume of item i in the diet of individual 1. a mean intra-speciﬁc general overlap was obtained from all overlap combinations (hereafter ‘between’ samples mean overlap), which permits evaluation of intra-speciﬁc diet variability, e.g., the degree of diet similarity among individuals. this index ranges between 0 (no diet overlap, high variability) and 1 (complete overlap, no variability). the inﬂuence of to explore (indirectly) local environmental conditions on intra-speciﬁc diet vari- ability, pianka’s index was calculated among individ- uals of a same species by sample (patch), providing a mean overlap ‘within’ samples (considering only species present in more than three samples, with more than two individuals in each). mean overlap ‘within’ samples was then compared to the mean overlap ‘between’ samples. the coefﬁcient of variation (cv ¼ standard deviation/mean) was calcu- lated for both groups to compare the variability among overlap values observed in ‘within’ and ‘between’ samples. in addition, feeding activity to determine diel and habitat feeding activity, the mean stomach fullness (mf) was calculated for representative species (n > 25 individuals; species 12 abundance is detailed in pelicice et al. 2005) for each diel period and macrophyte biomass category: mf ¼ ðn0  0þ þ ðn1  1þ þ ðn2  2þ þ ðn3  3þ n where n0 is the number of individuals with stomach fullness of 0, n1 is the number of individuals with stomach fullness of 1, n2 is the number of individuals with stomach fullness of 2 and n3 is the number of individuals with stomach fullness of 3; n is the total number of individuals analysed. one-way anovas were used to test for signiﬁcant differences in mf values between diel periods and macrophyte biomass categories. two-way designs were not used because of unbalanced data distributions among levels of factors. bonferroni probability cor- rection (a ¼ 0.05/number of tests) was considered to avoid type i error. parametric assumptions were checked prior to analysis. means were compared using tukey’s post hoc test. all analyses were performed using statistica v5.5 (statsoft 2000). effect of macrophyte biomass on diet to compare overall dietary patterns between patches with medium and high macrophyte biomasses, diet similarity between habitats was measured using pianka’s overlap index. volumes of each item were pooled from all individuals collected in each category of macrophyte biomass. the resulting matrix of relative volumes (%, by food items) was used to calculate diet overlap between habitats and to explore differences in species diet between patches with medium and high macrophyte biomasses. only species with a sufﬁcient number of individuals (n > 5) in both categories of macrophyte biomasses were analysed. overlap among species to evaluate diet overlap among species, pianka’s overlap index was calculated for species pairs in each sample independently. volumes of each item were pooled from all individuals collected within each single patch, by species. the resulting matrix of relative volumes (%) was used to calculate diet overlaps among species, considering all species pairs within each sample (patch). therefore, an overall mean overlap and its standard error, for each species combination, were obtained. this procedure gives more realistic results, as overlap is measured among potential competitors (i.e., individuals collected in the same patch). additionally, to explore co-occurrence patterns, the occurrence (%) of species pairs in the 40 samples (medium/high biomass) and the occurrence (%) of species pairs feeding in a same patch, were calculated. only the most abundant species were analysed (n > 15 stomachs). results diet characterisation from a total of 559 ﬁshes caught in 59 samples (20 species; pelicice et al. 2005), only 202 (10 species) had stomach fullness of 2 or 3 (table 2). these species consumed autochthonous items almost exclusively. out of 32 items identiﬁed, 22 were autochthonous, six allochthonous and four of unknown origin. according to iai values, the main food items consumed were (in decreasing order of importance) zooplankton (ostra- coda, cladocera and copepoda), ﬁlamentous algae and aquatic larval insects. few individuals fed on higher plants, sediment or detritus. of the 10 species examined (table 2), ﬁve fed almost exclusively on zooplankton (i.e., hyphessobry- con eques (steindachner), hemigrammus marginatus ellis, roeboides paranensis pignalberi, metynis mac- ulatus kner and oligossarcus pintoi campos). items feeding ecology of ﬁshes associated with egeria (h. eques and bryophytes importance consumed by these species of minor included algae and m. maculatus), aquatic insect larvae (h. marginatus, o. pintoi, m. maculatus and r. paranensis) and adult insects (h. marginatus and o. pintoi). terrestrial eigenmannia trilineata lo´ pez & castello consumed mostly insect larvae but also fed heavily on zooplank- ton. serrassalmus marginatus valenciennes and sata- noperca pappaterra (heckel) had unique diets. the diet of s. marginatus was dominated by ﬁsh ﬁns and scales (approximately 60%), although larvae of aqua- tic insects were also important (30%). s. pappaterra was the only species to incorporate higher plants and detritus more consistently in the diet. hyphessobrycon sp. and serrapinus notomelas (eigenmann) were the only herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on algae and bryophytes. intra-speciﬁc diet similarity practically all species showed low values of intra- speciﬁc diet similarity (pianka’s index), indicating high diet variability among individuals (table 3; table 2. diet of ﬁshes associated with patches of egeria. item values are the

notomelas and e. trilineata, which presented the most conservative diets (least variable), although the latter may be biased (eight out 10 individuals were caught in a unique sample). diet similarity ‘within samples’ was evaluated for ﬁve species: h. eques, h. marginatus, s. notomelas, r. paranensis and s. marginatus. except s. notomelas, an individual’s diet similarity ‘within’ samples was always higher than similarity ‘between’ samples (table 3), suggesting that these species have a diet that is more site dependent. in addition, ‘between’ samples showed higher variation in overlap measures (cv) for all species, except s. notomelas. in some instances, ‘between’ samples had cv values twice higher than ‘within’ samples, such as h. eques, h. marginatus and r. paranensis. this result indicates that, in addition to higher mean overlaps, ‘within samples’ also had lower variation among overlap measures. feeding activity this analysis was based on seven species: h. eques, h. marginatus, o. pintoi, r. paranensis, s. margin- atus, s. notomelas and s. pappaterra. some species restricted feeding activity to diurnal periods, such as h. eques, s. marginatus and s. notomelas (fig. 1). r. paranensis was the only species that presented nocturnal feeding (fig. 1). others showed no diel (one-way anova; pattern p > 0.0071; bonferroni correction for seven tests). h. marginatus and o. pintoi probably feed continu- ously during day/night periods (fig. 1). although test signiﬁcance correction excluded statistical diel dif- ferences for s. pappaterra, this species tended to feeding activity in 14 feed more at dusk (fig. 1), and an analysis with more individuals may provide evidence for such a pattern. no species showed different feeding activity between sites with medium and high macrophyte biomasses (one-way anova; p > 0.0071; bonferroni correction for seven tests). effect of macrophyte biomass because of sample sizes, this analysis was based only on four species: h. eques (nhigh ¼ 40; nmedium ¼ 11), s. notomelas (nhigh ¼ 05; nmedium ¼ 11), r. para- nensis (nhigh ¼ 10; nmedium ¼ 24) and s. marginatus (nhigh ¼ 27; nmedium ¼ 10). in general, diet compo- sition was very similar between patches of medium and high macrophyte biomasses. individuals of h. eques, s. notomelas and s. marginatus fed on the same items in both areas, with overlap values (pian- ka’s index) of 0.95, 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. only r. paranensis tended to change its diet (o12 ¼ 0.36), consuming more zooplankton in areas with medium macrophyte biomass and aquatic insect larvae in higher macrophyte biomass. overlap among species both species this analysis compared inter-speciﬁc dietary overlap among ﬁve species: h. eques, h. marginatus, r. paranensis, s. marginatus and s. notomelas. in general, these species exhibited low dietary overlap (table 4). the highest mean overlap (pianka’s index) was observed between h. eques and r. paranensis (o12 ¼ 0.58); consumed mainly zooplankton. these species co-occurred in 40% of the patches, but were feeding together in only 25% of these patches. the second highest mean overlap occurred between s. marginatus and r. paranensis (o12 ¼ 0.43), because of the shared resource of aquatic insect larvae. these species co-occurred in 45% of the patches, but were feeding together in only 33% of these patches. intermediate levels of dietary overlap occurred between h. eques and s. notomelas (o12 ¼ 0.37), because of consumption of algae and bryophyte, and between h. eques and h. marginatus (o12 ¼ 0.32), owing to some overlap in ostracoda and copepoda consumption. however, with intermediate levels of dietary overlap these species pairs were seen feeding together more frequently (>50%; table 4). in general, s. notomelas had the lowest values of inter-speciﬁc diet overlap, because of its unique diet based on algae. similarly, s. marginatus had low dietary overlaps, but it is interesting to note that this species frequently co-occurred feeding together with other species (table 4). feeding ecology of ﬁshes associated with egeria fig. 1. diel feeding activity of ﬁshes associated with egeria patches. mf is the

1988; casatti et al. 2003; mazzeo et al. 2003). because invertebrate distribution in egeria beds was unknown and ﬁsh diets in other habitats were not evaluated, our results cannot test explicitly the hypothesis that ‘mono-speciﬁc’ egeria patches are ﬁsh feeding grounds. however, in rosana reservoir, ﬁshes associated with egeria consumed almost exclusively autochthonous resources (more than 90% of items consumed), mainly zooplankton, epiphytic algae and aquatic insects. many studies have shown that small invertebrates and algae are com- monly found associated with macrophytes, utilising plants as substrate, refuge, feeding ground and direct nutrient source (stansﬁeld et al. 1997; cheruvelil et al. 2000; burks et al. 2001; marklund et al. 2001; lima et al. 2003). if egeria patches constitute a suitable habitat for these organisms, as observed by mazzeo et al. (2003), ﬁsh might be beneﬁting from many food that appropriate resources. although it experimental designs are needed to test the ﬁsh feeding ground hypothesis, the considerable consump- tion of autochthonous invertebrates and epiphytic algae suggest that egeria patches might be playing this role during the wet season. is clear although most species tended to feed preferentially on some food items, ﬁsh species in egeria patches had moderate to low intra-speciﬁc diet similarity, revealing also a broad niche breadth. this high variability in diet highlights a well-known ﬁsh behaviour: individuals generally feed on resources available in a particular moment (larkin 1956; abelha et al. 2001; jepsen & winemiller 2002), a pattern that is strongly space/time dependent. accordingly, to calculate the general intra- speciﬁc diet similarity we compared individuals collected in different places (‘between’ samples, which included more than 10 patches for some species), where environmental conditions and food availability may differ in quality and quantity. this procedure may 16 account for a great amount of variation observed in diet. local environmental conditions, individuals. all tended to be considerably higher therefore, must inﬂuence considerably diet composition. indeed, when intra-speciﬁc diet overlap was calculated separately for each patch (‘within’ samples), results supported the site-dependency of ﬁsh diet: diet similarity ‘within’ samples than ‘between’ samples, e.g., individuals inhabiting a single patch presented a diet more alike. in addition, another important result was the lower variability in overlap values for ‘within’ samples, indicating that the level of diet overlap is more similar among patches than among all these results indicate (indirectly) that individual’s diet may be correlated with local environmental conditions and suggest that individuals are feeding in an opportunistic way among macrophyte patches, probably in response to the most abundant resource(s). such a pattern reveals a clear individualistic behaviour, in which the ‘feeding phe- nomena’ depends completely on the phenomena of the individual ﬁsh (sensu gleason 1917), that is, each ﬁsh of a particular species responding distinctly to envi- ronmental stimulus (intra-speciﬁc variability). ade- quate measures of the range of this intra-speciﬁc variability are necessary to understand and predict ﬁsh feeding behaviours. although the use of some indices (such as iai) and graphical methods (such as the method of costello 1990) can be useful tools expres- sing the overall diet or general patterns in ﬁsh feeding ecology, the high degree of variability inherent to ﬁsh feeding behaviour can seriously mislead ‘ﬁxed’ char- acterisations. the lack of differences in ﬁsh diet between patches of medium and high macrophyte biomasses indicates that ﬁsh species feed on the same resources in both habitats. however, it is important to emphasise that the present analysis evaluated the overall diet, as calcu- lations did not consider intra-speciﬁc variability within habitats (volumes from all individuals are summed by food item for each habitat type). for example, low values of intra-speciﬁc diet similarity were observed only occur. the small differences within each biomass category (data not showed), and these values approached the ‘between’ samples intra- speciﬁc mean overlap. therefore, we may conclude that for some ﬁsh species the overall diet is similar between egeria patches of medium and high macro- phyte biomasses, but in food consumption exception was r. paranensis, which showed marked changes in diet between macrophyte habitats. because this species showed nocturnal activity, it would be interesting to test if some invertebrates have diel movements among patches with medium and high macrophyte biomasses. to evaluate ﬁsh feeding ecology, casatti et al. (2003) sampled multispeciﬁc macrophyte stands in formed by egeria, sagittaria, rosana reservoir, salvinia and eichhornia. compared to our results, differences can be noticed in the overall diet of common ﬁsh species. for example, they observed a high consumption of insect larvae by h. marginatus, h. eques and r. paranensis. differently, in egeria patches insect larvae comprised less than 10% of the diet of these species. because neither overall ﬁsh diet nor feeding activity changed remarkably between egeria patches of medium and high biomasses (which constitute distinct habitats), is likely that plant architecture (macrophytes with different morpholo- gies) play a major role in determining invertebrate assemblages and, thus, resource availability for ﬁshes. as discussed, local environmental conditions inﬂuence ﬁsh diet among egeria patches, but it is likely that substantial modiﬁcations in habitat qualities are nee- ded to modify profoundly the overall diet, such as aquatic plants with prominent differences in morphol- ogy or life-strategies (dionne & folt 1991; chick & mcivor 1997; dibble & harrel 1997). it (r. paranensis). pelicice et al. many freshwater ﬁsh species show well-marked patterns of diel activity (reebs 2002; hohausova´ et al. 2003), as a feeding behaviour or as a mechanism to avoid predation. in the present study, we observed marked diel feeding patterns for almost all species, the majority with diurnal activity and only one strictly nocturnal (2005) observed that these same ﬁsh species are all resident and do not leave the macrophyte patches during day/ night periods. therefore, these observations permit the conclusion that egeria patches represent more than feeding areas for these small-sized ﬁshes, as they remain associated with egeria patches even when not feeding. hence, we suggest that in habitats containing egeria patches (i) the situation of open water proﬁtability (dewey et al. 1997) do not exist, because ﬁsh resources are more abundant in littoral areas and ﬁsh assemblages associated with egeria are essentially formed by small- sized individuals (casatti et al. 2003; mazzeo et al. 2003; pelicice et al. 2005), and (ii) some other mech- anism inﬂuences ﬁsh aggregation inside egeria beds, feeding ecology of ﬁshes associated with egeria such as predation pressure (chick & mcivor 1997). large piscivores are found in this reservoir (for instance hoplias malabaricus, adult s. marginatus and aces- trorhynchus lacustris), and the diet of these piscivores includes some of the small-sized species collected in the present study (almeida et al. 1997). in addition, the ﬁn- clipping behaviour of juvenile piranhas (s. marginatus) is a constant and less macrophyte-dependent impact. it is likely that predator–prey dynamics are very complex in these habitats, where predation pressure is diversiﬁed. trade-offs between foraging and sheltering may not be clear, because ﬁsh remain constantly associated with vegetation. it and, (ross 1986) food partitioning is a common feature of ﬁsh accordingly, we assemblages observed low food overlap among species. is interesting to note that, in addition to noticeably low diet overlaps, all species analysed, except r. para- nensis, showed overlapping feeding periods (diurnal). consequently, these results indicate that even feeding at the same period – and frequently in the same patches (see s. marginatus) – this ﬁsh assemblage shows a high degree of resource partitioning, based primarily on food choice and patch segregation. for example, although h. eques and h. marginatus consumed mostly zooplankton, h. eques preferred copepoda whereas h. marginatus consumed mainly ostracoda and cladocera. in addition, when diet overlap was higher (the highest diet overlaps was observed with r. paranensis), we observed an inter- esting diel pattern of resource sharing. in this case, r. paranensis shared resources with other species but restricted its activity to another period (nocturnal). so, differences low frequency of co-occurrence among potential competitors and dif- ferences in temporal resources use, as detected in this study, can prevent strong trophic competition. may (1986) reports that even when species demonstrate intense niche overlap, other factors can promote species coexistence, such as spatial heterogeneity and habitat complexity, allied with environmental, temporal, population and behavioural stochasticities. in conclusion, ﬁsh species inhabiting egeria pat- ches in rosana reservoir presented a well-deﬁned feeding structure, consuming basically autochthonous resources. it is likely that the use of microhabitats within macrophyte patches, together with particulari- ties in resources use and activity, prevent trophic competition and permit the coexistence of several ﬁsh species (approximately ﬁve species) in habitat patches smaller than 1 m2 of area (pelicice et al. 2005). in food choice, resumen 1. esta investigacio´ n caracterizo´ la ecologı´a tro´ﬁca de las especies de peces asociadas a manchas de egeria najas e 17 pelicice & agostinho e. densa, dos macroﬁtas sub-aquaticas, en la represa de rosana (alto rı´o parana´, brasil). los peces fueron colectados con un throw trap de 1 m2 en manchas con distintas biomasas de macro´ﬁtas y en tres perı´odos del dı´a, durante la estacio´ n lluviosa. 2. la dieta de 10 especies estuvo compuesta principalmente de componentes auto´ctonos (zooplancton, algas y larva de insectos acua´ticos). casi todas las especies presentaron patrones de dieta intra-especı´ﬁca con similitudes moderadas o bajas (elevada variabilidad). algunas especies no mostraron ningu´ n patro´ n de actividad alimenticia durante el dı´a mientras que otras fueron principalmente diurnas o nocturnas. no se observo´ ninguna diferencia de actividad alimenticia entre los habitats de media y alta biomasa de macro´ ﬁtas, y las especies tendieron a alimen- tarse de los mismos componentes entre estos habitats. 3. las especies de peces ma´s abundantes mostraron un solapamiento alimenticio bajo y parecen no competir por recursos alimenticios. sugerimos que las manchas de egeria funcionan como lugar de alimentacio´n y abrigo para los peces de pequen˜o taman˜o. acknowledgements we thank the programa de estudos ambientais (pea) and the nu´ cleo de pesquisas em
