in contrast with expectations, survival in the first 5 days posthatch was strongly negatively related to female size and age, while survival over the following 9 days was unrelated to maternal traits. throughout the study, survival was positively related to yolk-sac volume. our unexpected observation of a negative relationship between maternal size and age and initial larval survival indicates that maternal effects may not be consistent throughout larval ontogeny. in fact, maternal effects appear to be dynamic influences on offspring fitness, and may have complex effects on individual- and population-level reproductive success. key words: maternal effect; yellow perch; perca flavescens; offspring fitness; ontogeny introduction phenotypic variation determines the relative fitness of individual organisms through interactions with extant selective forces (hendry et al. 2011). in addition to genetic and environmental forces, individual pheno- types may be influenced by maternal effects, i.e. the impact of a mother’s phenotype on that of her off- spring (mousseau & fox 1998). measurable maternal effects on fecundity and fitness of offspring have been observed across a wide range of taxa, from the reproductive performance of daphnia (lamontagne & mccauley 2008), to the increased size and survival of eggs with increasing maternal age in the kittiwake (rissa tridactyla) (thomas 1983). while maternal effects are relatively ubiquitous, the mechanisms by which these effects operate are less uniform. whether maternal effects are inherently adaptive (i.e. whether particular phenotypes result in higher fitness among offspring) is not certain, although studies in species such as black rockfish (sebastes melanops) have indi- cated that this may be the case (berkeley et al. 2004). maternal effects may be particularly important in fishes, as recruitment of many species is strongly influenced by early life stage survival, which is often correlated with larval phenotype (berkeley et al. 2004). larger larvae with more energy-rich yolk-sacs often experience relatively high growth rates, are able to more efficiently evade predators and are less likely correspondence: s. andree, department of forestry and natural resources, purdue university 195 marstellar st. west lafayette, in 47907, usa. e-mail: srandree@purdue.edu †center for fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic sciences, southern illinois university, 1125 lincoln drive, life science ii, room 173, carbondale, il 62901, usa 384 doi: 10.1111/eff.12153 to suffer from starvation when prey is scarce (pitman 1979). life history theory predicts positive relation- ships between maternal traits, such as size, age and egg size, and offspring characteristics that affect fit- ness, such as offspring size and offspring provision- ing (johnston et al. 2007). empirical research has largely borne out these predictions, finding that older, larger females tend to produce a relatively greater number of larger, higher quality eggs (lauer et al. 2005; venturelli et al. 2010; olin et al. 2012) and that larger eggs tend to yield larger larvae (chambers & leggett 1996). therefore, larger mothers may pro- duce larger, more fit larvae, which may have a higher chance of survival during early life stages. however, various studies have illustrated that the role of maternal traits in directly determining larval survival is inconsistent across species and popula- tions, suggesting that maternal effects are highly vari- able and complex. regnier et al. (2013) found no relationship between maternal and egg size in brown_trout (salmo_trutta), but observed that smaller off- spring with lower total metabolic rates exhibited more efficient utilisation of yolk-sac reserves. heyer et al. (2001) found that larger, older yellow perch (perca flavescens) produced shorter offspring with larger yolk-sacs, indicating a possible trade-off between larval size and yolk-sac size (semmens & swearer 2012). in short, the particular suite of egg and larval characteristics which increases fitness may be inconsistent and vary among environments and year classes (marshall et al. 2010). the influence of maternal effects and larval traits on individual offspring performance can also vary through ontogeny. for example, pepin and meyers (1991) found that larval traits such as increased size, provisioning and swimming speed conferred advanta- ges in some early developmental periods, but not in others. typically, fish undergo one or more critical periods, during which the probability of mortality is very high due to a variety of related factors including developmental deformities, predation, prey availabil- ity, swimming efficiency and gape size limitations (may 1974). often two critical periods are observed. during the first larvae feed endogenously on yolk-sac reserves, and predation and congenital deformities likely drive mortality (morse 1989). later, during the transition to exoge- nous feeding, mortality may be strongly influenced by factors limiting prey availability (cahu et al. 2003; fulford et al. 2006). the timing, duration and selective magnitude of critical periods differ among species (may 1974), and the influence of maternal effects on offspring fitness likely also differs through ontogenetic transitions between critical periods. few days posthatch, this study aimed to evaluate maternal effects on egg size, offspring size and offspring survival of yel- ontogenetic variability of maternal effects low perch. yellow perch constitute historically important sport and commercial fisheries in both the u.s. and canada and represent an ideal species for examining maternal effects on reproductive success because they exhibit a fairly typical life history for many freshwater (i.e., maturation within 2–3 years, iteroparous spawning and no parental care; becker 1983). yellow perch deposit their eggs in a long, gelatinous ribbon called a skein, which is draped over vegetation to potentially promote oxygenation and deter predators (becker 1983). fishes the objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the influences of maternal length, mass and age on: skein mass, individual egg mass, egg diameter, egg density, larval length and larval yolk-sac volume; (ii) examine the relationships and potential trade-offs between egg characteristics and larval traits; and (iii) evaluate the importance of maternal, egg and larval traits on larval survival and resistance to starvation during early ontogeny. because larval yellow perch have been observed to switch from endogenous to exogenous feeding around 5 days posthatch (dph) (fulford et al. 2006), we sought to quantify maternal effects across two critical periods, 0–5 dph and 5–14 dph. based on previous studies, we hypothesised that (i) egg traits (mass, diameter, and density) and larval traits (length and yolk-sac volume) would be posi- tively related to maternal characteristics (mass, length and age), and (ii) larval survival posthatch would be positively related to maternal, egg and larval characteristics. methods maternal stock and egg collection we evaluated maternal effects in a closed population of north carolina-strain yellow perch that were origi- nally collected from the perquimans river, nc, usa, in 1992, and have since been held in semi-nat- ural ponds on a combination of naturally occurring and artificially supplemented food resources at the purdue aquaculture research lab (arl) (r. rode, personal communication; p. brown, personal commu- nication). these fish spawned naturally in the ponds each spring (i.e. larvae were not artificially produced most years), which may lessen the effects of domesti- cation on egg or larval traits (e.g., heath et al. 2003). with an observed average age of maturation at 2–3 years, roughly 7–10 generations have been pro- duced, meaning genetic diversity in the population is probably low. we collected yellow perch using seine nets from two yellow perch brood stock ponds at the purdue arl on 7 march 2012. collections occurred near the beginning of the natural spawning period, based on observations of skeins and a small number 385 measured (nearest 1 mm total length [tl]) each suc- cessfully stripped female. at the time of stripping, we also removed 4–6 scales from each female for age determination. we first weighed the whole skein to the nearest 0.01 g before removing and storing a 15–35 g subsample in 10% formalin to obtain aver- age egg size metrics. masses of skeins that were incompletely stripped or partially expelled in the holding tanks (a total of nine females) were not included in further data analysis. because shrinkage effects in percid eggs stored in formalin have been shown to be minimal, as well as proportional (serns 1982), and because samples were processed within 3–4 months of collection, we expected no significant effect of preservation on relative egg size patterns. in total, 121 females were successfully processed over a 2-week period (table 1). fertilisation and larval survival andree et al. of spent females collected during seining (z. feiner, personal observation). we transported individual yel- low perch to indoor flow-through holding tanks and separated them by sex on the basis of visually obser- vable sexual traits (e.g. size, swollen abdomens, run- ning milt for males). we acclimated all mature females in spawning condition in these tanks for 5 days before injecting them with 100 international units (iu) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) in the peritoneal cavity to promote ovulation and induce spawning. because yellow perch amass and provision their eggs during autumn and winter, and final ovulation and maturation of oocytes does not occur naturally until a few days prior to spawning (henderson et al. 2000), the use of hcg should not have affected the development of egg traits. support- ing this, hcg did not influence gonadosomatic index or egg survival relative to untreated females in the closely related percids walleye (sander vitreus; mali- son et al. 1998) and pikeperch (s. lucioperca; zakezs & demska-zakezs 2005). additionally, all fish were treated with an equal dose of hcg on the same day, so any potential effects should have been propor- tional among females. after injection, we held females in holding tanks at 14 °c and checked them twice daily (in the morning and late afternoon) for spawning readiness as indi- cated by a swollen and reddened gonadal pore and movement of egg masses to the posterior of the abdo- men. fish that were near spawning were processed immediately, while other individuals were retained in the holding tank until the next period of inspection. fish that appeared likely to spawn within 24 h of an inspection were placed in a mesh bag within the same enclosure, so that they could be more closely moni- tored. we removed all females that spawned indepen- dently (i.e. in the holding tank) daily and did not include them in the study. we manually stripped skeins from gravid females via pressure applied to the abdominal cavity. after obtaining the skein, we weighed (nearest 0.01 g) and tl (mean 211 mm, we chose a randomly stratified sample of approxi- mately two females per 10 mm size bin, for a total of 36 fish for inclusion in the larval survival study (table 1). for each female used in the survival study, we placed a 4–10 g skein section in a dry bowl and added 1–3 ml of milt from each of 4 randomly selected males range 185–243 mm). we obtained milt from the same males each day, storing milt samples in iced syringes prior to and between uses. the same four males were used to fertilise 32 of the 36 females selected for the survival trial. following unexpected mortality of the initial males, we randomly selected four new males (mean tl 214 mm, range 193–235 mm) to fertilise the remaining females. after adding milt, we added 100–150 ml of water to the skein sections and stirred them by hand for 2–3 min to facilitate fertilisation and water hardening. we placed each fertilised, water-hardened skein section into a separate 40 l tank on a plastic grate installed at a 45° angle. tanks were linked by a table 1. data summary. number of females (n), mean, range (minimum and maximum) and standard deviation of

flow-through system, using filtered and treated well water at a constant tempera- ture of 14 °c. each tank was equipped with an aera- tion system which operated continuously throughout the incubation process, maintaining dissolved oxygen content within a range of 10–11 mgl  1. we treated each tank with 5 ml of formalin every 2 days until hatching to reduce fungal growth (rach et al. 1997). we checked the incubating skeins twice daily for evi- dence of hatching readiness (i.e. larval stages and the presence of free-swimming larvae). any larvae that hatched between inspections were removed from tanks and not included in the larval study. when we determined the eggs to be near natu- ral hatch, we removed them from tanks and placed them into hatching trays, using manual agitation with forceps to induce uniform hatching. all eggs hatched within 6–10 days of fertilisation, with the majority (32 of 36 egg sets) hatching at 9 days. to control for the potential confounding effect of incubation time, only larvae that incubated for 9 days were used to evaluate maternal effects on larval traits and survival (although analyses including and excluding these lar- vae yielded similar results). at hatching, we randomly removed and stored 20 larvae per clutch in 95% ethanol to assess larval length and yolk-sac size. with larvae, as with eggs, we assumed shrinkage to be proportional (foley et al. 2010). to evaluate maternal effects on larval survival and starvation resistance using only yolk-sac energy reserves, we placed an additional randomly selected 20 larvae from each female into a 3.79 l tank filled with well water that was treated and sand-column fil- tered to remove >90% of all particles larger than 5 lm in diameter, and therefore contained no poten- tial prey (r. rode, personal communication). all tanks were held in a temperature-controlled room. at 17 °c and remained constant temperatures dissolved oxygen remained within a range of 8.25–8.70 mgl  1 for the duration of the study. we checked the tanks twice daily and removed and enu- merated all dead larvae. due to logistical constraints, the study was terminated after 14 days and surviving larvae in each tank were enumerated. ontogenetic variability of maternal effects as studies of fecundity, ally determined, we considered skein mass an indica- tor have demonstrated strong positive correlations between fecundity and skein mass (heyer et al. 2001; olin et al. 2012). previous past studies have quantified individual egg size using a variety of methods (egg diameter, egg dry mass, egg volume; chambers & leggett 1996; john- ston & leggett 2002; marteinsdottir & steinarsson 2005). we chose to quantify mean egg diameter, dry mass and egg density. we quantified egg diameter by removing 10 randomly selected formalin-preserved eggs from the skein using forceps, rinsing them with water, photographing and measuring them with imagej software (rasband 1997-2004). because yel- low perch eggs are not perfectly spherical, we mea- sured two perpendicular diameters to the nearest 0.001 mm for each egg (fig. 1a), and used the mean of the two radii (r) to calculate individual egg volume (i.e. to subsequently determine egg density), using the equation for the volume (v) of a sphere, v = 4/ 3pr3 (following heyer et al. 2001). to quantify egg mass, we placed two sets of 20 randomly selected eggs on preweighed drying tins after removing excess water using a kimwipe. wet weight was then recorded. after drying them at 70 °c for 48 h, we weighed the samples to determine egg dry mass. we calculated the mean individual egg mass for each female by first dividing the mass of each set of eggs by 20 and taking the mean of the two sets. mean individual egg dry mass was then used to determine mean egg density (egg dry mass/egg volume; table 1). (a) (b) data processing and analysis we determined the age of adult females using scales pressed between two microscope slides. three researchers independently counted annuli using a dis- secting microscope and compared age estimates to reach a consensus. a fourth reader re-evaluated any discrepancies in age estimates. using this method, the initial three observers consistently aged 100 of 121 females. all disagreements were resolved by the fourth observer. although fecundity was not manu- fig. 1. photographs of (a) yellow perch egg (359 magnification) and (b) newly hatched yellow perch larva (209 magnification). lines indicate axes used to determine egg diameter, larval stan- dard length and yolk-sac volume using imagej. 387 andree et al. the larvae collected at hatching were removed from ethanol, placed on slides and photographed individually at 209 magnification. we measured lar- val standard lengths to the nearest 0.001 mm from photographs using imagej (fig. 1b). we determined yolk-sac volume based on an equatorial diameter and a polar diameter taken at the posterior edge of the oil droplet, using the volume formula of a prolate spher- oid, v = (p/6)lh2, where h is the yolk-sac height (equatorial diameter) and l is the yolk-sac length (polar diameter) in mm (table 1, fig. 1b, blaxter & hempel 1963). to individual maternal we used simple linear regressions to determine the relationship of all egg (diameter, mass and density) and larval (standard length and yolk-sac volume) char- acteristics characteristics (length, age and mass). for egg and larval characteris- tics, a mean of all measurements taken per individual maternal sample was used. similarly, we used linear regression to evaluate relationships between egg and larval characteristics. we carried out all analyses in r (r core team 2012). we checked for violations to the assumptions of linear regression (linearity, indepen- dence, homoscedasticity of errors and normality of errors) by plotting residuals versus predicted values, autocorrelation of residuals and conducting shapiro- wilk tests on standardised residual distributions. when assumptions were violated (e.g. trends in residuals, significant shapiro–wilk tests), we used natural-log transformations to linearise the relationship. specifi- cally, skein mass was natural log-transformed for all regressions, and maternal mass was natural log-trans- formed when regressed against skein mass. we used holm-bonferroni adjusted p-values (ludbrook 1998) to control the family-wise error rate when conducting multiple comparisons within each dependent variable. trade-off between larval size and provisioning (semmens & swearer 2012) and because single variables were lar- gely poor predictors of larval traits (see results), we used multiple linear regression to determine the most useful combination of metrics to explain variation in larval length and yolk-sac volume. maternal length, mass and age, ln(skein mass), egg diameter, egg mass, egg density and the alternative larval trait (lar- val length when analysing yolk-sac volume and yolk- sac volume when analysing larval length) were included in an initial full model. incubation time was not included because all larvae were incubated for 9 days. we chose the best model using backward stepwise selection with small sample size-corrected akaike information criterion (aicc) as the decision criteria to prevent model over-fitting due to our rela- tively small sample size (hurvich & tsai 1989). to evaluate the potentially important we used cox regressions in r package ‘survival’ to (cox 1972; olin et al. 2012; therneau 2012) 388 time. initial evaluation of measure the influence of single variables (maternal age and size, and mean egg, mean larval and mean yolk-sac size) on the survival of larvae from individual mothers over the data revealed that seven tanks experienced unusually high mortality (>90%) over the first 48 h of the experi- ment, while all other tanks exhibited <45% mortality over the same period. as the larvae in these seven tanks were hatched on the same day, this suggested some extrinsic or methodological source of mortality. therefore, we excluded these tanks from all survival analyses, yielding a total of 27 females included in the analyses; however, cox regressions including and excluding these data yielded qualitatively similar results. in the remaining tanks, patterns of larval survival varied between time intervals, exhibiting relatively high mortality over the first 5 days of the experiment (mean tank mortality 58.2%, range 15–100% during days 0–5) of the experiment and decreased mortality over the following nine (mean 39.8%, range 0–100% during days 6–14). these mortality rates were signifi- cantly different (unpaired t-test with welch’s correc- tion; p = 0.027) supporting our decision to divide survival analysis into periods approximating larval endogenous and exogenous feeding in natural sys- tems (days 0–5 and 6–14, respectively; fulford et al. 2006). in each regression, days post hatch (dph) served as the time variable and death of each larva as a status variable. to determine the effects of mater- nal, egg and larval traits on larval survival, we included all variables measured as continuous explan- atory variables in separate regression models. the assumption of proportional hazards over time was checked for each cox regression by calculating the pearson between schoenfield residuals and time for each covariate, testing for significant variation over time (fox 2002). if the correlation was significant at a = 0.05, the assumption of proportional hazards was violated, requiring the addition of an interaction between the covariate and time in the model (cox 1972; olin et al. 2012). we considered all regressions significant at a = 0.05 after holm-bonferroni correction. product-moment correlations results relationships between maternal, egg and larval metrics egg diameter (fig. 2a) and skein mass (fig. 2b) were significantly positively related to all maternal traits (length, mass and age). egg dry mass was signifi- cantly positively related to maternal length, and marginally positively related to maternal age and mass. egg density was not related to any maternal metrics (table 2). moreover, based on simple linear regressions, larval length and yolk-sac volume were ontogenetic variability of maternal effects (a) (c) (b) (d) fig. 2. linear regressions of statistically significant relationships between a) maternal mass and mean egg diameter, b) ln(maternal mass) and ln(skein mass), c) egg dry mass and larval length and d) egg dry mass and yolk-sac volume. symbols in all panels represent individual females. unrelated to maternal traits (table 2). however, lar- val metrics were significantly related to egg metrics: both larval length and yolk-sac volume were positively related to egg mass (table 3; fig. 2c, d). thus, although we did not observe that larger females pro- duced larger larvae, they did produce larger eggs, which in turn produced larger larvae with larger yolk-sacs. based on multiple regression analysis and informa- tion criteria, larval length was best described by a simultaneous positive effect of egg mass coupled with volume (aicc =  14.29, r2 = 0.603). similarly, yolk-sac volume was best described by a simultaneous posi- tive effect of egg mass coupled with a negative effect yolk-sac negative a effect of table 2. sample sizes (n), intercepts (int) and slopes of linear regressions between maternal length (mm), mass (g) and age (years) versus ln(skein mass)  3), larval length (mm) and larval yolk-sac volume (mm3) of yellow perch, with adjusted r2 values (g), egg mass (mg), egg diameter (mm), egg density (g mm and holm-bonferroni-adjusted p-values. columns are independent variables and rows are dependent variables. all slopes represented as <0.0001 are positive. maternal mass was natural log-transformed to linearise the relationship with ln(skein mass). bolded values indicate significant relationships (holm-bonferroni- adjusted p < 0.05). maternal length variable ln(skein mass) egg mass egg diameter egg density larval length yolk-sac volume n 111 120 120 120 31 31 int slope p r2 0.50 0.17 0.97 0.36 5.23 0.10 0.0134 0.0002 0.0003 <0.0001 0.0012 0.0001 <0.001 0.890 0.050 0.027 0.002 0.062 1.000  0.008 1.000  0.001 1.000  0.013 maternal mass n int 111  1.32 0.21 120 1.04 120 120 0.36 5.44 31 31 0.11 maternal age slope p r2 n int slope p r2 1.0343 0.0001 0.0002 <0.0001 0.0005 <0.0001 <0.001 0.861 0.029 0.047 0.007 0.090 1.000  0.008 0.006 1.000 0.777 0.047 112 121 121 121 32 32 2.42 0.20 1.05 0.33 5.43 0.10 0.9930 0.0071 0.0039 0.0069 0.0235 0.0059 <0.001 0.374 0.050 0.033 0.229 0.004 0.388 0.011 1.000  0.019 0.049 0.777 389 andree et al. table 3. sample sizes (n), intercepts (int) and slopes of linear regressions between skein mass (g), egg mass (mg), egg diameter (mm), egg density  3), larval length (mm) and yolk-sac volume (mm3) of perca flavescens with adjusted r2 values and holm-bonferroni-adjusted p-values. columns are (g mm dependent variables and rows are independent variables. bolded values indicate significant relationships (holm-bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05). larval length yolk-sac volume variable ln(skein mass) egg mass egg diameter egg density larval length yolk-sac volume n 29 32 32 32 32 32 int 5.214 4.760 3.586 4.868 – 5.482 slope 0.0784 3.0792 1.8173 1.7491 – 0.4525 p 1.000 0.003 0.332 0.092 – 1.000 r2  0.009 0.363 0.097 0.178 –  0.034 int 0.113 0.058  0.113 0.088 0.099 – slope 0.0050 0.2886 0.2265 0.111 0.0060 – p 1.000 0.036 0.241 0.777 1.000 – r2  0.032 0.235 0.124 0.030  0.034 – length (aicc =  120.85, r2 = 0.526). in of larval trade-off both cases, accounting for an apparent between larval length and yolk-sac volume greatly increased the explanatory power of egg mass (from r2 = 0.363 to 0.603 for larval length and r2 = 0.235 to 0.526 for yolk-sac volume). survival the experiment the results of cox regressions considering only the first 5 days of revealed negative effects of maternal size and age, and larval length on larval survival, and a positive influence of yolk-sac volume (table 4, fig. 3). when the last 9 days of the experiment were analysed, results differed consider- ably. after a period of larval die-off during the first 5 days, maternal length and age were no longer signif- icant; however, maternal mass retained a marginally significant negative effect on survival. the effects of egg metrics and larval length were no longer signifi- cant, but yolk-sac volume remained significantly posi- tively related to survival (table 5, fig. 4). discussion maternal influences on egg and larval metrics the results of this study supported previous observa- tions of maternal effects via positive relationships between maternal and offspring size, but did not sup- port the hypothesis that maternal size and age posi- tively influence early life offspring fitness. maternal effects have been observed in the progeny of a vari- ety of taxa (e.g. thomas 1983; lauer et al. 2005; johnston et al. 2007) and are understood to play an important yet variable role in the development and survival of progeny. these effects differ among envi- ronments, among populations, and over time (pepin & meyers 1991; marshall et al. 2010). in fishes, maternal effects are known to influence offspring size and provisioning (lauer et al. 2005; marteinsdottir & steinarsson 2005; olin et al. 2012), and thus could have significant impacts on individual survival and 390 table 4. results from simple cox regressions for traits affecting mortality of larvae from 27 perca flavescens females 0–5 days posthatch (dph), with corresponding coefficient, wald score and holm-bonferroni-adjusted p-value. positive coefficients indicate an increase in the likelihood of mortality as the associated variable increases. negative coefficients indicate a decrease in the likelihood of mortality as the associated variable increases. bolded values indicate significant relationships. variable coefficient wald score adjusted p maternal traits maternal length maternal mass maternal age egg traits egg mass egg diameter egg density larval traits larval length yolk-sac volume yolk-sac volume*time 0.013 0.006 0.309 0.258 2.371  0.591 0.884  30.70 8.816 65.42 91.73 62.24 0.06 3.560 0.36 6.37 18.34 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 0.808 0.118 1.000 0.002 <0.001 population-level annual recruitment in both wild and aquaculture populations. when comparing maternal traits to egg traits, we expected to find that larger, older females would pro- duce more and larger eggs. supporting our hypothesis, the majority of maternal characteristics were signifi- cantly positively related to multiple egg metrics, with age being less influential than either length or mass. the weaker effect of age may be attributed to the fact that fish tend to increase in length and weight more slowly as they continue to age (von bertalanffy 1957). after this point, the growing disconnect between growth rate and annual age may account for a lessened relevance of age as an accurate predictor of egg and larval size and condition. as expected, heavier and longer females produced heavier skeins (which were considered an indicator of higher fecundity; see meth- ods) containing larger eggs. a positive effect of mater- nal size on egg size metrics is not uncommon among fish species, and has been reported by a number of studies in perca spp., including heyer et al. (2001), lauer et al. (2005), and olin et al. (2012). contrary to our hypothesis, direct correlations between maternal and larval traits were not observed ontogenetic variability of maternal effects (a) (c) 8 . 0 4 . 0 0 . 0 8 . 0 4 . 0 0 0 .

variables influencing both larval length and yolk-sac volume, it became clear that factors influenc- ing larval traits may be more complex. a paired effect of egg mass and yolk-sac volume explained over half of all variation in larval length. similarly, a paired effect of egg mass and larval length explained over half of all variation in yolk-sac volume, indicating a trade-off between larval length and yolk-sac volume, as has been previously observed in the common galax- ias (galaxias maculatus) (semmens & swearer 2012) as well as in yellow perch (heyer et al. 2001). differ- ing rates of yolk-sac metabolism and utilisation (reg- nier et al. 2013) as well as variation in incubation time could lead to a negative relationship between lar- val length and yolk-sac volume, as larvae continually grow and utilise yolk-sac reserves before hatching and throughout subsequent embryonic development (blax- ter & hempel 1963). however, we attempted to con- trol for variation in incubation time by only including larvae that had incubated for 9 days in our analyses and still observed a negative relationship between lar- val length and yolk-sac size, indicating that a trade-off may exist through mechanisms other than varying development time. it is unclear if this apparent trade- off between larval size and provisioning exists across species. regardless, this relationship suggests that maternal effects may involve complex tradeoffs among traits determining the energetic contributions to both larval size and provisioning, which may influ- ence fitness in different environmental conditions (marshall et al. 2010). 391 andree et al. i i g n v v r u s n o i t r o p o r p (a) (c) 8 . 0 4 . 0 0 . 0 8 . 0 4 . 0 0 0 . 500.0 g 199.5 g 96.2 g 5.80 mm 5.51 mm 4.73 mm (b) (d) 1.13 mm

found that maternal phenotype had varying effects on off- spring survival at different developmental increments. our observations indicated that larval perch undergo two critical periods within the first 14 dph, roughly demarcated by their switch from endogenous to exog- enous feeding around day 5 (fulford et al. 2006). we found distinctly different influences of maternal, egg, and larval traits on larval survival between the first 5 and subsequent 9 dph. in contrast with previous stud- ies that found a positive relationship between mater- nal size and larval survival (e.g. berkeley et al. 2004; marteinsdottir & steinarsson 2005; olin et al. 2012), we found that larval survival within the first 5 dph was negatively related to maternal age, length and mass, as well as larval length. this negative effect of maternal size on larval survival is fairly unique to the literature, and leaves much room for hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms that may be driving this response. we observed relatively high larval mortality in the first 5 dph (58.2%) compared to some other studies (e.g. olin et al. 2012). this may be because this experiment was conducted in a somewhat warmer 392 temperature and using larger females than compara- ble studies on wild populations such as that by olin et al. (2012). in addition, our larvae were restricted to small 3.79-l tanks, and small culture volumes have been linked to high larval mortality in walleye, possi- bly due to some unidentified difference between the culture environment and the species’ natural pelagic larval stage (li & mathias 1982). despite this unex- pected mortality, all larvae were exposed to nearly identical treatment environments, meaning that all individuals responded to similar conditions. there- fore, experimental treatment or handling effects should not have disproportionately affected the survival of larvae produced by larger, older females. another potential hypothesis for the early die-off of larvae from older, larger mothers is that they may have, for genetic or other intrinsically-driven reasons, absorbed their yolk-sacs at a faster rate, leading to earlier starvation. however, visual inspection of lar- vae that died during the first 5 days of this study revealed that most retained at least partial yolk-sacs, indicating that intrinsic factors, such as congenital malformations, and not starvation, were likely causes of early mortality. additionally, the females used in this study were taken from a closed population of cultured yellow perch, and thus could be expected to be more inbred than comparable wild populations. however, if inbreeding was the cause of lethal mal- formations, it would be expected that smaller, youn- ger females (which are likely more inbred) would suffer a greater decrease in larval fitness, which was not the case in this experiment. finally, while high larval mortality within the first critical period is uncommon in the literature, it is not unprecedented. dahlberg (1979) observed relatively high mortality during the first 5 dph in several species, including yellow perch, suggesting that this trend may be a mechanism of early selection in natural systems as well. therefore, we assert that our observations of negative maternal effects on early life survival remain valid, despite some unexpected trends in overall larval survival in the first 5 dph. an alternative explanation for the low survival of offspring produced by larger mothers in this study is maternal senescence. in previous studies, a negative effect of senescence on reproductive fitness has been attributed to the observation that older, larger mothers must allocate a larger portion of energy to metabolic demands, thus potentially leaving less available for reproduction (kamler et al. 1982). senescence may also act through increasing energetic costs of repro- duction as individuals experience an increasing num- ber of spawning events (reznick et al. 2002). since the subjects of this study generally matured at age 1 or 2 (r. rode, personal communication), it is reason- able to use age as an indicator of the number of spawning events undergone by each individual. if, after some point, an increase in spawning events relates to a decrease in maternal reproductive fitness (woodhead 1979), this phenotypic state could trans- late into the negative maternal effect we observed. while maternal effects during the first critical per- iod were in direct opposition to our hypotheses, the pattern of larval survival over the last 9 days of the study yielded results that generally agreed with our hypothesis: larval survival was positively related to yolk-sac volume, but was no longer negatively related to maternal length or age, and only marginally so to maternal mass. since larger yolk-sac volumes can supply greater energetic provisions to larvae due to the fact that they are able to contain more essential nutrients (e.g. fatty acids; johnston et al. 2007), and greater egg density often indicates higher lipid con- tent (and thus better provisioning; fuiman & ojangu- ren 2011), it is reasonable to conclude that, in the absence of an exogenous food source, survival of unfed larvae would be largely dependent on the nutri- tional content of yolk-sacs. a similar trend of diminishing maternal effects on larval growth and survival as larvae progress through ontogeny has been illustrated in experiments by heath et al. (1999) on chinook salmon (oncorhynchus ontogenetic variability of maternal effects survival observed in this tshawytscha); thus, the strength of maternal effects may in fact be largely determined by the develop- mental stage of the offspring. moreover, the sequen- tial pattern of study supports the theory that larval development should be viewed not as a homogenous process, but as a series of punctuated stages of growth and development, each characterised by its own set of defining vari- ables (pepin & meyers 1991). for instance, larger larval body and gape size may result in an increase in fitness during the transition to exogenous feeding, enabling larvae to both swim faster to avoid predators and maximise feeding efficiency by taking advantage of a wider size range of prey (morse 1989). how- ever, greater size may provide no advantage to the youngest, endogenously feeding larvae, whose mor- tality in this study may have been largely due to intrinsic factors such as malformations of body struc- tures or other congenital defects (cahu et al. 2003). while more research is necessary to develop this the- ory and some mechanisms remain unclear, our results suggest that maternal phenotype significantly influ- ences larval survival during at least the first 5 days posthatch in yellow perch, and, to some extent, in later development by influencing yolk-sac volume, which remained a determinant of survival for at least 2 weeks posthatch. females used in this study were genetically similar and reared in an environment with a largely stable food source, uniform habitat composition and an absence of predation. additionally, spawning date was regulated to some extent, and all eggs and larvae were treated similarly. moreover, there were no sig- nificant trends in maternal size or age with spawning time (data not shown). in nature, factors such as envi- ronmental variability, differences in spawning timing among individuals and mate selection are all potential contributors to egg and offspring phenotype and fit- ness (mousseau & fox 1998; marshall et al. 2010). however, while genetic, environmental and nutri- tional differences among females are known to influ- ence gonad development and offspring survival (e.g. henderson et al. 2000), variation of these factors among individuals was likely low in this study. instead, any maternal effects we observed should be largely due to phenotypic variation. in addition, our fish may have matured as early as age 1 or 2, around the youngest age at maturation observed in the wild (e.g. jansen 1996), and thus may have progressed toward reproductive senescence more quickly if the onset of senescence is driven, as we hypothesise, by the number of reproductive events. the lack of selec- tion on increased offspring size or provisioning in relatively benign aquaculture environments has been shown to cause rapid adaptive shifts toward smaller egg size (heath et al. 2003), potentially reducing 393 andree et al. differences in egg size among females and the impor- tance of maternal effects to offspring size and fitness (einum & fleming 1999). therefore, the significant influences of maternal phenotype on offspring size and early life survival we observed may in fact be conservative relative to similar effects in wild popula- tions, where selective pressures are stronger. potential impacts summarily, the results of this study indicate that, as expected, maternal phenotype displayed a positive relationship with egg quantity and size, and may mediate larval size through variation in egg size. however, early larval survival was negatively influ- enced by maternal metrics. furthermore, maternal effects differed over time, indicating that these effects are complex and that management practices which focus on the preservation of the largest females in a population may be neglecting to account for these multi-faceted interactions occurring during early larval development (heyer et al. 2001; semmens & swearer 2012). thus, it may be more beneficial to maintain a diverse spawning stock to produce off- spring which thrive in a wider range of conditions (hsieh et al. 2010). based on these results, three focus points emerge from this study. first, older, lar- ger mothers produce more eggs, contributing more gross offspring production to both wild and aquacul- ture populations. secondly, older, larger mothers pro- duce offspring that are more likely to suffer mortality during the first few days posthatch, potentially reduc- ing net offspring contribution. thirdly, egg and yolk- sac size are important determinants of early larval survival and starvation resistance, and some trade-off may exist between maximising yolk-sac size (and thus provisioning) and larval size at hatch. cumulatively, these results may have important implications for management of both natural and aquaculture systems. if the negative effects of mater- nal size and age on offspring survival are to be attrib- uted to senescence, they may be less pronounced in natural systems, where fish mature at varying ages due in part to environmental variation (heibo & vol- lestad 2002) and potentially have shorter life spans due to higher mortality rates, resulting in fewer over- all spawning events within an individual’s lifetime. in aquaculture, managers may wish to rethink the credo of ‘bigger is better’, i.e. the idea that larger females always produce higher quality offspring (chambers & leggett 1996; lauer et al. 2005), when choosing individuals to be included in brood stock. in this case, it is important to consider the potential trade-off between offspring quality and quantity, at least as it applies to the period of larval development between hatch and initial switch to exogenous feeding. 394 however, these results represent only one of many successive windows during which mortality may be driven by a variety of factors (pepin & meyers 1991). further experiments considering entire cohorts produced from individual females, and quantifying the total percentage surviving through multiple life stages to recruitment would be necessary to deter- mine the extent of the influence of maternal effects throughout early development. larger the results of this study answer its objectives clearly: variations in maternal phenotype translate to variations in egg traits and larval survival posthatch. females should be whether or not older, retained as higher contributors to recruitment is debatable; however, it is interesting to consider this new evidence that there may be some increasing costs of reproduction as females undergo additional spawning events, which may offset the benefits of higher fecundity in larger, older females. in light of this information, the management of wild and aqua- culture populations may be viewed as two sides of the same coin. in natural systems, where predation and prey scarcity are concerns, it may be more impor- tant to manage for the survival of larvae after the first 5 days posthatch (a period of high mortality; cahu et al. 2003; fulford et al. 2006), by preserving older, larger mothers, ensuring greater survival of offspring during the exogenous feeding period. in aquaculture populations, it may be more beneficial to maintain a younger brood stock, and thus a higher proportion of larvae surviving the first 5 days posthatch, as larvae that do not suffer mortality during the first critical period may be relatively less likely to starve or be eaten in an aquaculture system. overall, these results and their implications emphasise the importance and complexity of maternal effects on recruitment at a population level. acknowledgements the authors thank bob rode and
