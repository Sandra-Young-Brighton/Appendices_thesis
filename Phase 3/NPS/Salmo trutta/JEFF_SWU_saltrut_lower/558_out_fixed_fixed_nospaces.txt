hewitt 1996). analyses of freshwater ﬁshes have revealed molecular traces of recolonization routes on the north american and european continent (e.g., bernatchez & osinov 1995; nesbø et al. 1998; durand et al. 1999; koskinen et al. 2000). dna techniques are greatly advancing our knowledge of the global distribution of genetic diversity and vicariance of (hewitt 2004), but the details of migration routes could be provided only by direct analysis of specimens ances- tors remnants. the species molecular marker techniques do not only allow for the study of dna of contemporary organisms, but also of some extinct organisms (cooper & wayne 1998). ancient dna recovered from archaeological and palaeontological remains make possible a comparison of the genetic relationships of extinct organisms with their contemporary relatives (hofreiter et al. 2001). thus it may be possible to study evolutionary processes and historical events that changed the distribution of genetic variants, perhaps resulting in the present distribution of species. research on ancient dna extracted from ﬁsh bones and otoliths has focused on the analysis of mitoch- ondrial dna (mtdna) fragments. this is because the mtdna genome is a relatively small and well characterised molecule, is inherited maternally and evolves faster than nuclear dna (kocher et al. 1989). as each vertebrate cell contains numerous mtdna molecules, at least some undegraded mtdnas often persist in samples of ancient tissues (hagelberg et al. 1991). among the mitochondrial genes as the cyto- chrome b gene is probably the best studied mtdna segment in ﬁshes (e.g., kocher et al. 1989; briolay et al. 1998), sequences of in revealing genetic relationships at intra- and interspe- cies level. this gene is useful in this pilot study we examine ancient mtdna as an approach to shed light on phylogeography of past and present mitochondrial dna haplotypes in common bream (abramis brama l., cyprinidae, teleostei) in poland. the common bream represents a major component of the ﬁsh fauna of europe, inhabiting fresh and brackish waters. due to its sustenance importance, the remains of common bream have been 278 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00097.x mitochondrial haplotypes of common bream in poland fig. 1. map of northern poland showing the sampling sites. dudka, dabki, and wolin were archaeological sites, whereas bay of szczecin, bukowo lake, and niegocin lake refer to contemporary sampling sites of common bream. uncovered at many archaeological sites (makowiecki 2000). from archaeological material, we were interested in the following questions: (i) is it possible to identify common bream mtdna (ii) are haplotypes modern-type common bream haplotypes present in is this approach archaeological material, and (iii) useful for comparing the geographical distribution of bream mtdna variants over long periods of time? material and methods the archival material of common bream used in his work was obtained from three archaeological sites – wolin, dabki and dudka (fig. 1); samples of three individuals (one bone from dabki and dudka, and two bones from wolin) were subjected to dna analysis. the contemporary living breams were caught in the same geographical locations from which archival samples were obtained (table 1). dna extraction the method of dna extraction was performed following the protocol of ciesielski et al. (2002). at ﬁrst the bone was soaked in sodium hypochlorite solution for surface decontamination and then rinsed several times in ethanol. the bone was powdered with a ﬁne sand paper, and approximately 0.3 g of a bone powder was added to 0.5 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) (ph 8.0) in order to decalcify the sample. table 1. description of archival and contemporary samples of common bream

1 after 90 h of incubation with edta the decalciﬁed bone powder was transferred into a new tube, and 500 ll of lysis buffer (100 mm tris-hcl; 10 mm edta; ph 8.0, 0.5 mg of proteinase k, and 0.25 mg of dithiothreitol) was added. then the sample was incubated at 55 °c for 3 h. the aqueous phase was extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol, and once with chloroform– isoamyl alcohol solution (24:1). the dna of a sample was concentrated using microcon-50 microconcentrators (millipore corpora- tion, billerica, ma, usa). two consecutive rounds of concentration gave a ﬁnal volume of 50 ll, and the retante was stored at )20 °c. modern dna was extracted using the ‘dna-direct kit’ (wizardò genomic puriﬁcation kit; promega, madison, wi, usa). pcr ampliﬁcation primers l: 5¢-acgcactagtcgacctcc-3¢ and h: 5¢-ac- gtctcggcagatgtgg-3¢ spanned a 172 bp region of cyto- chrome b gene from 46 to 218 nucleotide (ciesielski et al. 2002). double-stranded pcr ampliﬁcation was performed in 50 ll reaction volumes containing 2 units of taq dna polymerase (promega), 5 ll reaction buffer (500 mm kcl, ph 8.5; triton x-100), 20 pmol of each primer (mwg-biotech, ebersberg, germany), 2.5 mm mgcl2, 500 of lm datp, dctp, dgtp, and dttp, and 2 ll of dna template. dna was ampliﬁed using a perkin elmer 9600 thermal cycler (pe-applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) beginning with preliminary denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min. the ampliﬁcation cycle consisted of 94 °c for 30 s, 52 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 45 s, for a total of 30 cycles, ending with a ﬁnal elongation step at 72 °c for 3 min. initial pcr products of archival samples were ream- pliﬁed using the same procedure. the pcr product was separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel, using 1x tbe buffer (0.5 m edta, ph 8.0). ethidium bromide (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the gel and the pcr product was visualised with uv light. molecular weight marker ux 174/hinf i was used. 279 ciesielski & makowiecki dna sequencing before sequencing the pcr product was puriﬁed from oligonucleotides, primers and dimers using microcon- 50 spin columns (millipore corporation). sequencing was performed using a perkin elmer abi 373 automated dna sequencer and the dyedeoxy cyc- ling sequencing reaction (pe-applied biosystems) at the institute of biochemistry and biophysics in warsaw, poland. the nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank under accession numbers: af238082, ay028979, ay028980, ay028981 and af486629. phylogenetic analysis nucleotide composition in the analysed segment was assessed with mega 2.1 (kumar et al. 2001). sequences were aligned with the help of higgins and sharp algorithm using the program clustal w (thompson et al. 1994). pairwise distance of nucleo- tide sequences were estimated using the kimura 2- parameter model (kimura 1980). genetic relationships were determined by distance method with mega 2.1 program (kumar et al. 2001) using deduced amino acids sequences. distance trees were estimated accord- ing to the neighbour-joining method of saitou & nei (1987). laboratory precautions the entire dna extraction procedure was organised following strict standard rules to avoid pcr contam- ination. the preparation of bone sample and dna extraction were performed in one laboratory and stored in a freezer located in another room. preparation of buffers and pcr set-up was performed in a separate laboratory, which was uv illuminated for periods of time when it was not in use. for each pcr, reaction blank controls were conducted. results the archaeological sequences (table 2) agreed with the sequence of contemporary common bream. all including those retrieved from ancient sequences, samples, were complete. for further phylogenetic analysis we took the middle part of the sequences without ﬂanking segments. the nucleotide composition of the 117 bp cyto- chrome b gene segment sequence was g deﬁcient (13,8%), whereas relatively equal frequencies were observed for the other three nucleotides (a, 25.7%; c, 31.8% and t, 28.7%). sequence alignment of all eight specimens was straightforward, no insertions or dele- tions were observed, and all sequences were translat- 280 table 2. variable sites of 117 bp long region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (which corresponds to position 46–218 of mitochondrial cytochrome b

haplotypes varying at six positions with the variable third codon position. one mutation (position 115 of the cytochrome b gene) affected the amino acid (leucine«methionine). nucleotide differences were observed only among the ancient common bream group, whereas sequences of examined contemporary living breams were identical (table 2). the pairwise nucleotide sequence distance between all haplotypes ranged from 0.0086 to 0.03516, whereas mean distance between ‘ancient’ group (wol11, wol12, dab20 and dud25) and the present-day haplotype (con01) was 0.0222 (table 3). the neighbour-joining tree based on amino acid sequences revealed two lineages (fig. 2). a ﬁrst clade included samples: dabki 01, dudka 01, wolin 01a and wolin 01b (con 01 haplotype) and dudka 25 (dud 25 haplotype), whereas a second group contained three ancient samples: wolin 11, wolin 12 and dabki 20 (respectively the wol 11, wol 12 and dab 20 haplotypes). the clustering observed resulted in leucine or methionine present in 39 amino acid position in a coded protein. discussion our results indicated a lack of genetic variation among analysed contemporary samples, whereas relatively high divergence among ancient common breams haplotypes was observed. as ancient ﬁsh, lived in several periods of time, it is difﬁcult to estimate how this fact inﬂuenced observed genetic divergence. it is worth noticing that ﬁsh remains taken from wolin table 3. pairwise distance among haplotypes under kimura’s 2-parameter model. 1 2 3 4 1. con 01 2. dab 20 3. wol 12 4. dud 25 5. wol 11 0.03516 0.03502

because of changing environmental conditions such as alteration of water salinity (mu¨ller 2001), this group of ﬁsh went extinct. some time after that alongside with other changes in environmental conditions, coastal waters became inhabited anew by ﬁshes, that have immigrated from the region where ﬁsh stocks were genetically more polymorphic (hewitt 1999). in conclusion, it is possible to retrieve and analyse mitochondrial dna molecules from archival bones of common bream. the procedures applied allowed obtaining information about mitochondrial haplotypes of ﬁsh that lived thousands of years ago. none of ancient bream mitochondrial haplotypes were found in contemporary samples, although this observation could result from small samples size. in order to compare the geographical distribution of ﬁsh mtdna variants over long periods of time it is necessary to analyse larger sample size. we contemplate that the present distribution of common bream mitochondrial haplotypes has been formed no earlier than 1000 years ago and that the present lack of genetic variation might originate from a founder effect and restricted gene ﬂow. although the glacial history and patterns of postglacial colonization have played a major role in shaping present-day genetic differentiation (hewitt 1996, 1999; jaarola et al. 1999) it is also possible that other historical events in the natural environment might have deter- mined the present genetic variation. resumen 1. descubrimientos recientes han probado que con te´cnicas moleculares no solo es posible estudiar ﬂora y fauna contem- pora´nea sino tambie´n organismos ya extintos. el acceso a restos de animales extintos permite extraer y estudiar su adn y revelar su posicio´n taxono´mica tanto como sus relaciones con parientes contempora´neos. este tipo de informacio´n puede ser u´ til para explicar cambios en la distribucio´ n de especies de peces. los datos gene´ticos de especı´menes arqueolo´ gicos proveen informacio´ n complementaria para resolver cuestiones sobre la distribucio´ n y migracio´n de los peces a trave´s de escalas temporales. 2. en este estudio, extraimos el adn de huesos de abramis brama (n ¼ 4) datados entre 6000 y 1000 an˜os ac sobre los que secuenciamos un fragmento de 172 bp de citocromo b mitocondrial. las secuencias obtenidas diﬁrieron de las se- cuencias homo´ logas de individuos contempora´neos (n ¼ 4) que habitan la misma a´rea geogra´ﬁca. ninguno de los haplotipos mitocondriales ‘‘antiguos’’ fue encontrado en los individuos contempora´neos. 3. sobre estos resultados contemplamos que la distribucio´ n actual de los haplotipos mitocondriales de a. brama o bien se ha formado hace menos de mil an˜os o bien que la falta actual de variacio´ n gene´tica puede haberse originado como efecto fundador o ﬂujo restringido de genes. 281 fig. 2. phylogenetic relationships among mitochondrial dna haplotypes of common bream based on amino acids deduced from 117 bp fragment of cytochrome b gene. genetic distance tree was estimated according to the neighbour-joining method of saitou & nei (1987). ancient samples are highlighted with a grey back- ground. island (wol 11, wol 12; 1000 bp) were genetically divergent, although they belonged to ﬁsh that have lived at the same time (c. 1000 years bp), contrary to bream caught in 2001. there was no relationship between past and present mitochondrial haplotypes of ﬁshes inhabiting the same geographical areas. each ancient ﬁsh possessed its own mtdna haplotype, and unexpectedly none of these were found in contempor- ary samples. as some characteristics of cytochrome b gene, such as saturation effects and the low variation in ﬁrst and second codon position, contribute to problems in phylogenetic analysis (meyer 1993), in this study of reconstruction of genetic relationship we used amino acid sequences (adachi & hasegawa 1996). the analysis performed revealed two lineages that differed to each other in one amino acid position. the samples: wolin 01a, wolin 01b, dabki 01, dudka 01 (haplotype con 01) and dabki 20 (dab 20) contained mtdna that determined leucine, whereas those from samples wolin 11 (wol11), wolin 12 (wol12) and dabki 20 (dab 20) coded for methionine at this position. the pattern observed in phylogenetic partition in analysed common bream mtdna is confusing because of the absence of a clear phylogeographical relationships between haplotypes. this could result from small number of studied common bream samples. however there is a some scheme of relation between analysed individuals – all ancient breams, that inhabited waters directly connected to the baltic sea (wol 11, wol 12 and dab 20 haplotypes) formed one clade (fig. 2), whereas ﬁsh from dudka site (dud 25 haplotype) joined the group of contemporary ﬁsh. it may be theorized that thousands of years ago a speciﬁc group ciesielski & makowiecki 4. nuestros resultados sugieren que la vicarianza de peces
