february 28, 2012 abstract – fish, which are generally visual foragers, experiences reduced reaction distance in visually degraded environments, which has consequences for encounter rates with prey. small prey is detected at shorter distances than larger prey, and piscivores are therefore predicted to be more strongly affected by visual degradation. in experiments, roach (rutilus rutilus) were fed two plankton prey types and pike (esox lucius) were fed daphnia and larval roach, in clear water, algal turbid water and water coloured brown by dissolved organic matter (dom). planktivorous foraging in roach was not affected by visual degradation, while pike foraging on both daphnia and larval roach was. pike showed increased reaction distance to daphnia in visually degraded water, while it was severely reduced with roach as prey even if the visual range was not reduced below pike reaction distances in clear water. pike foraging on daphnia was not affected, but when foraging on roach, the reduced search efﬁciency was counteracted by increased attack rates. however, there was no increase in movement and no difference between turbid and dom treatments. effects on piscivores will likely become more pronounced at later life stages as prey size and the reliance on long- distance detection increases at the same time as changing climatic conditions may further deteriorate the visual conditions in future. key words: turbidity; humic water; foraging; prey size; juvenile ﬁsh introduction growth rate of juveniles is one of the most funda- mental factors affecting survival and recruitment in ﬁsh populations (chick & van den avyle 2000; post 2003), and it depends heavily on the availability of resources. however, resource-speciﬁc beneﬁts may change over time as most ﬁsh are gape-size-limited foragers with ontogenetic shifts in prey-type prefer- ence (werner & gilliam 1984; mittelbach & persson 1998). at different developmental stages, ﬁsh feed on different types and sizes of prey according to prey- type availability, gape-size limitations (mittelbach & persson 1998) and energetic gain (stephens & krebs 1986). fish, which are generally visual foragers (guthrie & muntz 1993), detects larger prey from greater distances than smaller prey (chesney 1989; vogel & beauchamp 1999; de robertis et al. 2003). therefore, foraging on larger prey may be more affected by reduced visual conditions than smaller prey, which indicates that the effects of deteriorated visual conditions on foraging in juvenile ﬁsh may change during early ontogeny. it is previously known that increased clay turbidity affect foraging in ﬁsh, which is acknowledged as a major environmental problem (lind 2003). however, eutrophication also increases turbidity by stimulating phytoplankton growth which also degrades the visual conditions in the water (shapiro et al. 1975; sønderg- aard et al. 2007). during the last decades, many lakes on the northern hemisphere have also experienced increased brown coloration, resulting in the further deterioration of the visual environment (hongve et al. 2004; monteith et al. 2007; erlandsson et al. 2008). however, the optical properties of brown-coloured water are completely different from those of turbid water. in turbid water, large particles, that is, clay particles, phytoplankton or suspended sediment, scatter incoming light and thereby reduce the contrast between the prey and its background (utne-palm 2002). the brown colour on the other hand originates from dissolved organic matter (dom) that absorbs correspondence: m. jo¨nsson, ecology building ⁄ lund university, se223 62 lund, sweden. e-mail: mikael.jonsson@biol.lu.se doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00565.x 461 jo¨nsson et al. light instead of scattering it and leads to reduced light intensities (davies-colley & vant 1987; morris et al. 1995), but contrast may be maintained if light levels are sufﬁcient. as contrast is one of the most important parameters for prey detection in ﬁsh (hinshaw 1985; utne-palm 1999), foraging may not be as severely affected by dom as it is by turbidity. there are indications that individual growth rates (horppila et al. 2010) and ﬁsh production (karlsson et al. 2009) are affected by the level of dom in the water. however, even though this lake type is very common in the boreal region, experimental data on the effects of water with dom on foraging rates in ﬁsh are scarce, but there has been some recent advances (laine 2001; horppila et al. 2011; estlander et al. 2012). light level and prey size (chesney 1989; de robertis et al. 2003) also affect the detection of prey (vinyard & o’brien 1976; aksnes & giske 1993), implying that visual conditions may affect foraging on different prey sizes differently. foraging may be affected through rates (turesson & bro¨nmark decreased encounter 2007), which can be counteracted by increased activity (jacobsen et al. 2004; meager & batty 2007). but the outcome of a predator attack also depends on behavioural decisions and accuracy in interpreting the surroundings by both the predator and the prey, that is, their abilities to assess vulnerability and risk. by decreasing the visual information available, the precision in these assessments may be affected. as most ﬁsh are gape-size-limited foragers, they feed on prey of increasingly larger sizes during their ontogeny. larger prey are generally more energetically favourable (olson 1996; mittelbach & persson 1998; post 2003), and shifts in prey size preference and ⁄ or windows can therefore be crucial for continued juvenile growth (mittelbach & persson 1998; persson & bro¨nmark 2002). reduced growth may reduce the competitive ability of individuals (persson & bro¨nmark 2002) and expose juveniles to predators for a longer period, reducing probability of survival and thereby lifetime ﬁtness. individual success during ontogeny is thereby of crucial importance to both individual growth and population recruitment processes. in this study, we evaluate the effects of visual degradation on juvenile ﬁsh by comparing activity, swimming pattern, reaction distance and foraging efﬁciency of yoy ﬁsh in clear water, algal turbid water and water coloured brown by dom when foraging on two differently sized prey types. copepods and daphnia were used as small and large zooplankton prey for roach, and daphnia and yoy roach as small and large prey for pike. we hypothesised that foraging on plankton prey is not affected by visual degradation because of small prey sizes and thereby very short reaction distances. in contrast, we expect that foraging on ﬁsh prey should be negatively affected by visual 462 degradation because of a dependence on long-distance prey detection (chesney 1989; aksnes & giske 1993; de robertis et al. 2003). reaction distances for pike were hence expected to be negatively affected by visual degradation when foraging on ﬁsh prey. further, water with dom was not expected to affect foraging and behaviour as severely as turbid water. methods in the experiments, juvenile roach and pike were fed with different prey types at two different periods during early ontogeny. experiments were run in clear water, turbid water (green algae dominated by scene- desmus spp.) and water coloured brown by dom. these treatments are hereafter referred to as clear, turbid and dom water treatments. roach eggs were collected in bjo¨rkaån stream (55°39¢n, 13°38¢e), sweden, spring 2009 (water tem- perature, 11.6 °c), where roach migrate to spawn. eggs are deposited in thick mats on the substrate of shallow fast-ﬂowing stretches of the stream and can easily be collected by hand and put in aerated water. eggs were transported to the laboratory at lund university where they were kept in aerated stream water that was allowed to slowly increase in temperature to 16 °c. roach larvae hatched during the following 3 days. hatched larvae were moved to rearing tanks where they were fed cladoceran ephippia, live rotatoria and copepods once per day. after 5 weeks, larger cladocerans were also included in the food. pike came from a hatchery at lake ba¨singen (60°09¢n, 16°20¢e), sweden, where they were con- tinuously fed zooplankton from the lake. they were collected and transported to the laboratory at lund university 10 days after hatching where they were fed live copepods and cladocerans once a day. after 7 weeks, pike were moved to net cages to prevent cannibalism and 3 weeks prior to the ﬁsh prey trials, pike were fed live juvenile roach once per day. all ﬁsh were kept in clear water at a temperature of 18–20 °c and in ﬂuorescent light (ge lighting polylux xlr, 85wx2, ge lighting, cleveland, oh, usa) in 12:12 hour light ⁄ dark cycles which was gradually changed to 14:10 hour light ⁄ dark cycles during spring and early summer to mimic the natural photoperiod. turbid water was obtained using green algae with a dominance of scenedesmus spp. that were allowed to grow to high densities, whereas dom water was collected from a nearby pond (black pond, frihult, 55°33¢n, 13°39¢e). the turbid and dom water was diluted to a visual range of 25 cm (turbid water chl a, 705 lgæl)1; and dom water abs420 ⁄ 1, 0.32). the visual range in the water was deﬁned as the horizontal distance between the human eye and a secchi disc at which the contrast between the disc’s black and white ﬁelds disappeared. this method has been previously used (jo¨nsson et al. 2011a,b), and evaluation of the method has shown that reaction distance of adult pike feeding on ﬁsh prey is tightly correlated to this measure of visual range (ranåker, l., jo¨nsson, m., nilsson, p. a. and bro¨nmark, c. unpublished data). visual range refers to our measured visual range, and when the actual distance the ﬁsh can see in the water is referred to in the text, reaction distance is used instead. to create diffuse light conditions, two halogen spotlights (150 w each) illuminated the arenas from above through white fabric. halogen light bulbs were used to ensure that a broad spectrum of light was present (k, 410–930 nm). most wavelengths were also present at the bottom in all treatments owing to the shallow depth (k, 420–930 nm in algal turbid water and 460–930 nm in brown water, ocean optics hr4000 high-resolution spectrometer, ocean optics, dunedin, fl, usa), and the composition of the light included the absorption peak in the eyes of both pike (k, approximately 525 nm) and roach (k, approxi- mately 530 nm (jokela-ma¨a¨tta¨ et al. 2007). light levels during trials were 111 lux at the water surface, which corresponds to early dawn and late dusk levels, and 105, 76 and 45 lux at the bottom in clear, turbid and dom water, respectively (ins dx-100 digital lux meter, ins enterprise, taipei, taiwan). the intensity of par (photosynthetically active radiation) was 2.33 leæm)2æs)1 at the surface and 2.04, 1.42 and 0.93 leæm)2æs)1 at the bottom in clear, turbid and dom water, respectively, and the level of uva radiation was 1.99 lwæcm)2 at the surface and 1.67, 1.45 and 1.24 lwæcm)2 at the bottom in clear, turbid and dom water, respectively [nist traceable radi- ometer and photometer, international light il1400a (international light technologies, peabody, ma, usa) with both par and uv sensors]. the water depth was 6.0 cm, which is the depth that all light measurements were taken, in all trials except reaction distance trials where it was 2.0 cm to make the arena as two dimensional as possible. light was not measured at 2.0 cm depth as the shallower depth will affect the light less than the 6.0 cm depth will. all trials were recorded with cameras from above for later analysis. after all trials, photographs of the ﬁsh were taken for the measurement of total length in motic images plus 2.0ml (motic group, xiamen, china). however, photographs of prey ﬁsh were taken before trials. the duration of trials was determined in pre- trials so that they were long enough to ensure ﬁsh feeding but short enough to avoid satiation. roach foraging trials foraging trials with roach [roach total length (lt), 15.5 ± 1.9 mm, mean ± sd; age, 5 weeks] foraging yoy ﬁsh foraging under visual constraints on copepods (eight replicates) were performed in square arenas (15.4 · 18.0 cm), and where roach (roach lt, 19.8 ± 2.0 mm; age, 9 weeks) were forag- ing on daphnia (seven replicates), circular arenas (ø 45 cm) were used. larger arenas were used as the roach feeding on daphnia had grown to a larger size. each trial was performed with a group of three roach, acclimatised for 30 min prior to experimentation. groups were used to minimise stress as roach is a shoaling species. trials were started by adding 40 copepods or daphnia in the centre of the arena, lasted 30 min with copepod prey and 5 min with daphnia as prey, and were terminated by removing the three roach. the water was then ﬁltered through a 50-lm plankton net, and remaining copepods or daphnia were counted. roach and prey individuals were used only once in experiments, and only consumption was evaluated as separate foraging cycle components in roach are difﬁcult to quantify owing to roach and zooplankton sizes. further, activity and swimming pattern were not quantiﬁed because of limitations in the software used (noldus ethovision, version 3.1, noldus information technology, wageningen, netherlands). proportions of zooplankton consumed were arcsinöx- transformed before statistical analyses by anova to satisfy the assumptions of normality and homoscedas- ticity, but ﬁgures show absolute consumption. technical pike reaction distance experiments on pike reaction distance to daphnia as prey (seven, eight and ﬁve replicates for clear, turbid and dom water, respectively) were performed in a circular arena (ø 16 cm). one pike (lt, 17.3 ± 0.8 mm; age, 4 weeks) was acclimatised for 10 min before the trials were started by releasing ﬁve daphnia into the arena. reaction distance was quantiﬁed as the distance between the snout of the pike and the nearest body part of the prey when pike turned its head or the entire body towards the prey. all pike and daphnia were used only once, but in trials with roach as prey (roach lt, 18 mm), pike had reached a size that allowed more handling (pike lt, 54.4 ± 2.9 mm; age, 9 weeks), and the pike individuals were hence subjected to all treatments in a randomised order. these trials were performed in larger rectangular arenas (24 · 44 cm) as the reaction distance to larger prey is greater. roach were placed in a cylinder- shaped glass container (ø 3.0 cm) inside the arena to prevent pike from using other senses than vision for prey detection, and reaction distance was deﬁned as above. no acclimatisation of pike was necessary as they immediately engaged in prey searching behav- iour, and all ﬁsh were measured (nearest mm) after trials. differences in reaction distance with daphnia as prey were evaluated by anova. with roach as prey, a 463 jo¨nsson et al. randomised block anova was used with individual pike as the blocking factor that controls for potential differences between pike individuals and reduces the degrees of freedom according to the experimental design (quinn & keough 2002). pike foraging trials each pike all pike trials were performed in circular arenas (ø 45 cm) with a single pike each time. with daphnia as prey (six replicates), (pike lt, 38.3 ± 3.2 mm; age, 6 weeks) was acclimatised in the arenas for 30 min before trials were started by releasing 40 daphnia in the centre of the arena. trials were terminated after 10 min by removing the pike, and the water was then ﬁltered through a 50-lm plankton net and remaining daphnia were counted. pike and daphnia were used only once. in the trials with roach as prey (roach lt, 19.2 ± 1.9 mm), the same pike used for the quantiﬁcation of reaction distance were used and were subjected to all treat- ments in a randomised order (seven replicates). pike were acclimatised in the arenas for 30 min before trials were started, and 5 min before trial start, 10 roach were released into a net cage in the centre of the arena to allow them to acclimatise to experimental condi- tions. trials were started by removing the net cage and were terminated after 30 min by removing the pike. remaining roach were counted. activity (total dis- tance moved and time spent moving) and swimming pattern (turn rate or tortuosity, which is the degree of turn per distance moved) were obtained using noldus ethovision, version 3.1 for windows. in addition to consumption rate, attack rate (number of attacks during trial time) and capture success (proportion of the attacks that resulted in consumption) were also quantiﬁed. in the daphnia experiment, consumption was evaluated as the arcsinöx-transformed proportion of daphnia consumed, but ﬁgures show absolute consumption. in the roach prey experiment, time to ﬁrst capture was used as a measure of consumption rate in order to satisfy the assumption of a continuous response variable, as very few roach were consumed. differences in the dependent variables total distance moved, turn rate, attack rate, capture success and consumption rate with daphnia as prey were evaluated using manova. in the roach prey experiment, a randomised block manova with pike individual as the blocking factor was used. all statistics were performed in ibm spss statistics 19.0 for windows (ibm, armonk, ny, usa). time spent moving, results there was no effect of visual

f12,20 = 0.828; p = 0.623). however, in the experiments when pike fed on yoy roach, we found a signiﬁcant overall effect of visual conditions on pike foraging behaviour (wilk’s k = 0.098, f12,14 = 2.563, p = 0.048), and there was also a signiﬁcant block effect indicating differences (wilk’s k = 0.004; f36,33.5 = 2.395; p = 0.006). as the effect of visual condition was signiﬁcant in the manova, we proceeded with evaluating the univariate between- subject effects. there was a signiﬁcant effect on attack rate (fig. 4a, f2,12 = 7.825; p = 0.007), with lower attack rates in clear than in turbid (p = 0.008) and dom water (p = 0.023), respectively. however, there individual between pike 10 (a) 300 (b) yoy ﬁsh foraging under visual constraints and capture success was no difference in attack

planktivore is unaffected by naturally occur- ring levels of turbidity and dom. however, for a visual piscivore, the reaction distance to both plankton and ﬁsh prey is affected. when foraging on ﬁsh

reaction distance would decrease the encounter rates with prey if it is not counteracted by an increase in foraging effort, which is seen as an increased attack rate in visually degraded water. however, pike do not compensate for the reduction in reaction distance by increasing its swimming activity. also, these effects on yoy ﬁsh are similar regardless of the type of agent causing the visual degradation. for prey detection to occur, the projection of the prey on the retina of the forager has to be large enough, and the size of the projection is determined by the size of the prey and its distance from the forager (aksnes & giske 1993). small prey have to be closer to the forager to be detected, and therefore, the effects of visual conditions on foraging is predicted to increase in strength as prey size increases (vinyard & o’brien 1976; chesney 1989; de robertis et al. 2003). there are also other factors affecting detection of prey like contrast (lythgoe 1979; utne-palm 2002) and movements of the prey (utne-palm 1999). the different prey types used in this study differ in most of these parameters which somewhat confounds the mechanistic analysis, but they were chosen to resem- ble the prey types utilised in natural systems at the speciﬁc age or size of the forager. for roach, we were unable to determine reaction distance as they did not react very clearly when they detect prey. for pike, on the other hand, the response is very distinct both for plankton and for ﬁsh prey. in clear water, the reaction distance of yoy pike to daphnia was 2.0 cm, indicating that a reduction in visual range from clear water to a visual range of 25 cm would not restrict the reaction distance of pike (fig. 2). in accordance with the predictions, the visually degraded treatments did not restrict reaction distance but instead enhanced it (fig. 2). this has previously been shown in clay turbid water where enhanced prey contrast has been proposed as the likely explanation (hinshaw 1985; gregory & northcote 1993). it is uncertain whether this increase in reaction distance (2.0–3.1 cm) is of ecological relevance as there were no effects on any of the foraging parameters analysed. these limited effects of visual conditions may also partly be due to the developmental stage of the ﬁsh eyes. pike were only 17.3 mm long at the age of 4 weeks when the trials were performed, and it is likely that the eyes were not fully developed at that age. however, increasing the size of the prey changes the prerequisites for detection and thereby also the predictions. the reaction distance of yoy pike to roach prey was severely affected by reductions in the visual range with reductions both in dom (64%) and in turbid water (44%). reaction distance in clear water was 24.2 cm, which can be considered the maximal visual 466 (82%), which will ability of pike at that size and light condition. in both dom and turbid water, the visual range was 25 cm, which resulted in severely reduced reaction distance even if it was greater than pike’s maximal visual ability (fig. 2). reductions in visual range may therefore affect juvenile ﬁsh even if the visual range is greater than their maximal reaction distance. as the reaction distance is reduced with visual degradation, the search efﬁciency (volume of water searched per unit of time) of the forager is also reduced. calculating the water searched at any instant by the forager as a spherical sector (cone with a spherical end) with the reaction distance as the radius and a horizontal visual ﬁeld angle of 150° (raat 1988) reveals that search volume is substantially reduced in both dom (95%) and turbid water reduce the probability of encountering prey. pike counteracted the decrease in search efﬁciency by increasing the attack rate (fig. 4a), which together with a trend towards decreasing capture success (fig. 4b) resulted in no difference in consumption (fig. 4c). the reduced capture success may be due to lower precision in the attacks as the visual information available to the forager is reduced. even if prey are detected, the image quality may still be affected. image degradation may lower the ability of the predator to estimate size, swimming ability and condition of prey within the reaction distance, resulting in predators not being able to efﬁciently select the desired prey (abrahams & kattenfeld 1997; reid et al. 1999). despite the large reduction in search volume, there was no effect of visual conditions either on distance moved (fig. 3a) or on how much time they spend moving (fig. 3b). increased movement exposes juvenile pike to larger predators, both to other species and to cannibalistic conspeciﬁcs, more than increased attack rates would, possibly making this strategy more beneﬁcial in communities with high predation risk or intracohort cannibalism, which often is the case in dense pike populations (raat 1988). further, there was a trend towards a higher turn rate in dom water (fig. 3c), but having a high turn rate per se does not increase the search efﬁciency as turning would induce more overlap in the water volume searched. also, this increased turn rate was not present in turbid water, making orientation issues linked to low light intensi- ties a more likely explanation. at high prey density, encounter rates with prey may still be high enough to satisfy the predator even under deteriorated visual conditions. however, at low prey density, the probability to encounter prey may not be sufﬁcient to sustain foraging rates. here, yoy ﬁsh are affected similarly by dom and turbid water, but in natural systems, dom and turbid water systems are very different. algal turbid waters especially are generally eutrophic, with high densities of juvenile the availability of light ﬁsh and abundant food resources, resulting in high encounter rates for foragers. the high prey density therefore buffers the negative effects of visual degra- dation, and a high consumption rate may be sustained. in dom water, limits the productivity and prey density is low (karlsson et al. 2009). visual degradation is therefore likely to have disproportionately large effects on foraging in ﬁsh in systems rich in dom. further, even if the reasons for increased concentrations of dom in aquatic environ- ments are still under debate, hydrology and ﬂow regime seem to be important factors (erlandsson et al. 2008) that may increase in the northern hemisphere the coming decades because of climate change (ipcc 2007). increased dom concentration may lead to increased sensitivity of lakes in general and strengthen the effects of visual constraints on ﬁsh foraging. this study provides empirical evidence that even if yoy ﬁsh foraging on zooplankton may not be affected by visual degradation, yoy piscivorous ﬁsh are affected. this effect is present even if the visual range in the water is not reduced below the maximum reaction distance of the ﬁsh. reduced search efﬁciency was counteracted by increased attack rate but not activity, which may be beneﬁcial in high-risk envi- ronments where increased movement would increase exposure to predation. as pike consumption rates were not affected by visual degradation, they were able to efﬁciently counteract the decreased search efﬁciency by increasing the attack rate. also, the effects of visual degradation on foraging in yoy ﬁsh are similar, regardless of whether the water is turbid or coloured by dom. there is a potential of these effects becoming more pronounced in future through a continued increase in dom concentration of aquatic ecosystems because of changing climatic conditions. therefore, there is a need for further estimations of the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems differing in trophic status but nevertheless similarly subjected to increasing brown coloration and thereby visual deg- radation. acknowledgements we thank jan more´n and the fishing preservation district of lake ba¨singen, sweden, for hatching and providing larval pike and the swedish research council formas for funding the project. experiments were approved by an ethical committee (dnr m165-07), and facilities have permits for ﬁsh husbandry from the swedish board of agriculture (dnr 35-1878 ⁄ 03). references abrahams, m. & kattenfeld, m. 1997. the role of turbidity as a constraint
