mrss) within species because signal and receiver characteristics must be coupled for courtship to result in mating (lorenz 1970; templeton 1979, 1989; paterson & vrba 1985). however, this argument does not rule out the possibility that mrss evolve independently in isolated populations (foster & endler 1999; verrell 1999). further, if the mrs of a population diverges suf®ciently from that of other populations, ethological isolation and speciation are the expected outcomes (schluter & price 1993; ritchie 2000; panhuis et al. 2001). sexual selection is the differential mating suc- cess that is related to variation in secondary sexual characters among individuals, such as male sig- nals (andersson 1994). sexual selection may lead to rapid evolution of ethological isolation by causing changes in male signal characteristics and female preferences within a population (lande 1982; schluter & price 1993; panhuis et al. 2001; ritchie 2000). implicit in this model of speciation is that male mating signals and female preference functions co-evolve within populations; evolutionary changes that involve only one component of the mrs will not lead to isolation and speciation (ritchie 2000). for example, ethological isolation is not likely if two populations differ in male courtship signals, but females from each of the populations have no preference and mate randomly with respect to male signal types. the threespine stickleback ®sh (gasterosteus aculeatus) provides an excellent system to examine the role of sexual selection in speciation. marine populations have given rise repeatedly and 1 scott independently to numerous freshwater populations throughout their holarctic distribution (bell & foster 1994). males of this species develop a mosaic nuptial signal (red chin, bright blue iris, and blue-green dorsum) that varies among popu- lations in timing and extent of expression, and has been shown repeatedly to be under natural and sexual selection within populations (e.g., foster 1988, 1994; rowland 1989; bakker & mundwiler 1994; mckinnon 1995). several freshwater popu- lations along the paci®c coast of north america have lost the male mosaic signal altogether. in particular, male stickleback form freshwater streams in the chehalis river drainage (washing- ton state) are drab during territory acquisition and female courtship but become melanic during parental care (melanic form henceforth; scott & foster 2000). reimchen (1989) hypothesized that the cheha- lis stickleback signal evolved in response to sen- sory drive sexual selection. sensory drive sexual selection contends that different forms of a signal are conspicuous in some habitats whereas other forms are conspicuous in other habitats and var- iation among habitats is expected to lead to population-speci®c signals. scott (2001) found a correlation between stickleback nuptial signal type (mosaic or melanic) and water staining. speci®cally, the melanic type tends to be found in stained aquatic systems whereas mosaic types tend to be found in unstained areas in the che- halis river system. female preference for population-speci®c male nuptial signal has the potential to isolate local freshwater populations from those that possess the mosaic signal in the chehalis river drainage (washington state, usa). melanic and mosaic populations contact at narrow zones near the mouths of streams ¯owing into grays harbor and the paci®c ocean. here, i examine the poten- tial of the melanic signal to act as an ethological isolating mechanism by assessing female mate choice across the contact zone in a chehalis river drainage stream. methods locating the contact zone and male nuptial types the position of the contact zone between the freshwater and anadromous populations was determined by counting lateral plates on a sub- sample of 50 ®sh from seine hauls made at inter- vals along the lower 6 km of conner creek (478050n, 1248050w; fig. 1), a chehalis river drainage that ¯ows directly into the paci®c ocean, fig. 1. map of conner creek showing the frequency of complete (anadromous, closed bars), partial (hybrid, hatched bars) and low (freshwater, open bars) plate morphs at each sampled site. sample size is 50 individuals at each site. also shown on the map is the location of conner creek relative to the chehalis river, the location of and plate morph frequency at the humptulips river mouth, and the location of bowerman basin in grays harbor. 2 and in headwater ponds 11 km upstream. in addi- tion, a sample of sticklebacks was collected from salt-water tide pools at the mouth of the hump- tulips river in grays harbor, wa (fig. 1). sam- pling was conducted during the peak interval of reproduction in this system, which occurs from mid-may to mid-june. the stickleback were pre- served in 100% ethanol and later scored for lateral plate number on the left side under a dissecting microscope. lateral plates are modi®ed scales that form a single series of bi-lateral plates (bell 1982). fish from anadromous populations possess a complete set of 30±35 plates arranged continuously from the cranial region to the caudal peduncle ending in a lateral keel (complete plate morph). fish in freshwater populations possess ®ve to seven plates located in the cranial region (low plate morph; hagen & gilbertson 1972). lateral plate phenotypes can be used to determine the spatial range of each population as well as the location of the contact zone because the differ- ences in plate morphology are known to be under genetic control and hybrids in conner creek possess intermediate plate phenotypes (hagen & gilbertson 1973). lateral plate phenotypes can also be used to distinguish freshwater from anadromous females, which otherwise do not differ appreciably in phenotype. males at each of the sampled locations were also scored as belonging to one of three nuptial colour types: mosaic, melanic, or hybrid. mosaic nuptial types possess a bluish dorsum, bright blue iris, and red chin (mclennan & mcphail 1989), whereas the melanic nuptial types vary from drab to jet black depending on the stage in the nesting cycle (scott & foster 2000). hybrid males express character- istics of both nuptial types to varying degrees (mcphail 1969; hagen & moodie 1979). mate choice experiment gravid females were collected from three loca- tions: (i) headwater ponds; (ii) the upstream edge of the contact zone in conner creek; and (iii) a tidal ditch at bowerman basin in grays harbor (fig. 1). mate choice arenas were 2 m2 round pools with x-shaped partitions in the center that partially divided the pools into four equally sized sections. pools were ®lled with lake water to a depth of 15 cm, and the bottom of each was covered with 2 cm of beach sand and detritus from natural breeding areas. two size-matched males (within 1 mm total length), one mosaic and one melanic, were placed in each pool (both males were low plate morphs; mosaic males were col- lected from bowerman basin and melanic males from headwater ponds in conner creek). a single assortative mating in stickleback female was placed in a bottomless glass container in a neutral section of the pool once each male had completed constructing a nest and courted an arti®cial female. a female was released, initiating the trial, once both males had seen and courted her through the glass. i recorded the identity of the ®rst male to court her as well as the identity of the male whose nest the female entered, my cri- terion for choice. in addition, i recorded the time that elapsed from the start of a trial to female nest entry. fifty-two trials were run using females from each of the three locations. females were assigned randomly to one of eight male pairs to avoid potential affects of individual differences among males. each pair of males was used only once per day and maximally in eight trials. data analysis log-likelihood ratio test (g-test; sokal & rohlf 1995) was used to determine if the frequency of female choice differed from expectations based on random mating. heterogeneity g-test was per- formed subsequently to determine if nonrandom female mating frequencies were of the same mag- nitude and direction among females from the various locations. the heterogeneity g-test is analogous to testing the interaction term in an anova. signi®cant g-tests within a population indicate that one type of male is chosen more frequently than the alternative. signi®cant hetero- geneity g-test indicates that the direction of choice is different for at least one population. results the contact zone the samples collected at the humptulips river mouth and headwater site in conner creek were nearly monomorphic complete and low plate morphs, respectively (fig. 1). samples from the locations 1000, 3500, and 6000 m upstream from the mouth of conner creek comprised all three plate morphs but those from 1000- and 3500-m sites had substantially more complete and inter- mediate morphs than that 6000-m sample. thus, the 1000 and 3500-m sites are within the contact zone, and the 6000-m site is at the upstream edge of or just above the contact zone (fig. 1). male nuptial types samples from the humptulips river mouth pos- sessed only mosaic-type males. the 1000- and 3500-m samples in conner creek possessed 3 scott table1. choice of melanic or mosaic male threespine stickleback by females from different populations relative to the contact zone in conner creek, wa. color of male chosen female origin melanic mosaic conner creek headwater conner creek contact zone bowerman basin 15 15 4 4 3 11 n 19 18 15 total pooled heterogeneity d.f. 1 1 1 3 1 2 g 6.78 8.73 3.40 18.91 5.004 13.91 p 0.009 0.003 0.065 0.0003 0.025 0.0009 pooled values are based on null expectations of random mating. changing the null to expectations of assortative mating results in gpooled 1.08 (p 0.3) and gheterogeneity17.83 (p 0.0001). mosaic, melanic and hybrid males. hybrid males express characteristics of both nuptial types to varying degrees (hagen & moodie 1979; mcphail 1969) making unambiguous assignment of males to one of these three types impossible. never- theless, samples from outside of conner creek are monomorphic for mosaic males and samples at and above the upstream edge of the contact zone in conner creek are monomorphic for melanic males. female mate choice each pair of males in an experimental pool was used in more than one trial. however, there was no tendency for one male to be chosen more frequently than the other male beyond expecta- tions based on female location of origin (log- likelihood ratio test; g7.48, p 0.38; sokal & rohlf 1995), suggesting that female choice of males was not a function of individual differences between male pairs. furthermore, female choice was independent of which male courted her ®rst (log-likelihood ratio test: gyates corrected 2.604, p > 0.1). females from the three locations differed in their choice of melanic and mosaic males (gtotal 18.91, p 0.00029; table 1). across females from all three locations, melanic and mosaic males were chosen at frequencies that differed from expectations based on random mat- ing (gpooled 5.004, p 0.025; table 1), but not from expectations based on positive assortative mating (gpooled 1.08, p 0.3; table 1). conner creek headwater and contact zone females chose melanic males more frequently than mosaic males (g 6.78, p 0.009 and g 8.73, p 0.003, respectively; table 1). females from bowerman basin tended to mate in a positive assortative fashion as well (g 3.40, p 0.065; table 1), but the preference for mosaic males by these females was not as strong as that of conner creek females for melanic males. the frequencies at which conner creek headwater and contact zone 4 females chose males of the two colour types were similar (gheterogeneity 0.12, p 0.7) and differed in direction from the choices made by bowerman basin females (gheterogeneity 13.91, p 0.0009; table 1). females showed considerable variation in time taken before making a choice (mean 4.06 min; range 1±18 min). however, there was no differ- ence among female locations of origin for elapsed time to choice (anova; f2,47 0.571, p 0.57). in addition, some females made mistakes. however, whether a female chose correctly or incorrectly (based on colour type of population of female origin) was not a function of how quickly or slowly a female chose a male (logistic regression; x2 1.22, p > 0.25; hosmer & lemeshow 2000). discussion the in¯uence of habitat characteristics on mating systems has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. schluter & price (1993) found that male signals and female preferences in mod- eled populations were sensitive to environmental effects on signal detectability (male signals more so than female preferences) and that this form of sexual selection will lead to speciation if male traits and female preferences are such that diver- gent populations do not prefer one another as mates. empirical support for the effect of habitat characteristics on signal detectability comes from research on guppies (poecilia reticulata), cricket frogs (acris crepitans) and other populations of threespine stickleback. in guppies, male colour pattern, orange spots in particular, varies among populations in accordance with the spectral prop- erties of the local aquatic habitat (endler 1983; houde & endler 1990; endler & houde 1995). female preference for male colour pattern also varies among populations with preference tending to match the form of the signal in the local population (endler & houde 1995). call charac- teristics of male cricket frogs vary with sound transmission properties of surrounding vegeta- tion, and females from different vegetation types prefer call characteristics from their home habitat (ryan & wilczynski 1988, 1991; ryan et al. 1990). reimchen (1989) demonstrated a correlation between water staining and stickleback melanism across queen charlotte island, british columbia populations, and recently, boughman (2001) has also shown a correlation between british colum- bia stickleback mrss and spectral properties of local aquatic systems. many chehalis river drainage stickleback, including those in conner creek, are found in streams that are deeply stained (scott 2001), pro- viding a very different visual environment for signal transmission from that in most populations (lythgoe 1979; reimchen 1989). this presents the possibility that the ancestral mate recognition system has been lost because the male mosaic signal presents low contrast in the red-shifted light environment of stained water and thus does not offer a conspicuous signal (lythgoe 1979; reim- chen 1989; macdonald et al. 1995). instead, drab males may present a more effective signal in stained water. than unstained water there are two pieces of evidence supporting a role for staining in the evolution of the melanic signal in chehalis stickleback. first, chehalis river drainage stickleback populations with the melanic signal are more likely to be found in stained water (scott 2001). and second, the pattern of male signal and female preference in conner creek ®ts that expected by sexual selection mediated by envir- onmental effects on signal detection (this study). clearly, the effects of signaling environment on detection of male signals and female preferences warrant more direct experimentation to elucidate the role of environmentally mediated selection on signaling in these populations. for example, female choice of male based on colouration needs to be addressed under different signaling condi- tions. other studies have attempted to do this using arti®cial lighting or manipulated video. for example, baube (1997) used theatrical ®lters to manipulated down-welling light during mate choice trials, and macdonald et al. (1995) played back images of moving males against computer- manipulated backgrounds to gravid females. however, in baube's experiment, side-welling light (the light that produces the background against which the male is seen) was not provided. in addition, video displays are designed to stimu- late human eyes optimally (fleishman et al. 1998). the video images may not be simulating the colours seen by stickleback females. therefore, although both studies demonstrated an effect, how those effects translate to natural situations assortative mating in stickleback is unclear. in situ mate choice experiments elim- inate these problems and must be conducted before unambiguous conclusions regarding sen- sory drive can be made regarding the chehalis stickleback system. population-speci®c female preference appears to be strong in this system as females from each side of the contact zone made few mistakes. this result shows that ethological isolation between conner creek freshwater sticklebacks and adja- cent anadromous sticklebacks is nearly complete. this result is different from that of mcphail (1969) on the same system. in that study, females from the contact zone showed no preference and those from the headwater site preferred mosaic males. there are two possible explanations for this difference. first, the two studies could have documented a real change in premating isolation between the two populations over time. although this is certainly the more interesting of the two possibilities, the more likely explanation is a dif- ference in methodology. mcphail used a mate choice arena in which females spent time in front of males that were con®ned behind clear parti- tions. choice was determined based on female time in front of a male. the present study allowed direct interaction of males and females and used nest entry as the criterion for female choice. preference for melanic males by the conner creek females is a novel ®nding because the vast majority of stickleback mate choice studies show that females prefer males with the reddest chin. other male characters also play a role in female choice. for example, species pairs of benthic and limnetic sticklebacks from two british columbia lakes (priest and paxton) show size-based assor- tative mating (nagel & schluter 1998). addition- ally, females tend to mate with larger males (rowland 1989). male conner creek freshwater sticklebacks tend to be about 2 mm longer than anadromous sticklebacks in the chehalis region (scott unpublished), so size-based assortative mating is an additional possibility to male col- our-based assortative mating. however, the size difference between males of these two populations is small compared to that observed by nagel & schluter (1998), so size-based assortative mating is not likely important. furthermore, size differ- ences could not contribute to the results presented in the present study because males in each pool were size-matched. courtship behavior is another male trait that in¯uences female mate choice. males from some populations of stickleback in british columbia and alaska have lost compo- nents of the species typical `zig-zag ± lead ± show' sequence (foster 1988, 1994). kuè nzler & bakker (2001), found that video presentation of males 5 scott with zig-zags was more attractive than that of males without zig-zags, but the effect of courtship was not as large as the effect of male nuptial colour. benthic and limnetic males from another british columbia species pair lake (enos) differ in their courtship behaviour, which contributes to reproductive isolation in that system (ridgway & mcphail 1984). no attempt was made in the present study to examine population differences in male behaviour. this is an important charac- teristic that needs to be addressed in the chehalis stickleback system because differences in beha- viour may have contributed to the results observed here. previous research on melanic stickleback from the chehalis drainage has considered the male colouration as a single trait (mcphail 1969; hagen & moodie 1979; hagen et al. 1980). however, research presented here and by scott & foster (2000) and scott (2001) suggests that the repro- ductive signal in chehalis system has two inde- pendent components, a drab component used during mate choice, and a melanic component used during parental care. scott & foster (2000) found that males were deeply melanic during the parental care interval, and this corresponded with a dramatic increase in the occurrence of conspe- ci®c territorial intrusions, presumably nonrepro- ductive ®sh foraging on offspring under parental care. both components may be the result of environmental effects on signaling, but need to be examined separately. a fundamental problem in evolutionary biol- ogy is whether prezygotic isolation is a direct product of selection against hybridization, such as in the reinforcement model (howard 1993; littlejohn 1999), or whether it is a byproduct of the independent accumulation of locally adaptive, divergent characteristics (lande 1982; ryan & wilczinski 1991; schluter & price 1993; turner & burrows 1995). evidence for a role of divergent sexual selection in promoting premating repro- ductive isolation among populations is growing (e.g., ryan & wilczinski 1991; endler & houde 1995; boughman 2001). the present research demonstrates the utility of population-level com- parisons in making inferences about speciation that full-species comparisons cannot. resumen 1. la idea de que la
