kawecki & ebert 2004). spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions are likely to segregate populations into locally adapted subunits (fisher 1930; taylor 1991), and temporal environmental heterogeneity inﬂuences the extent of adaptive phen- otypic plasticity (kawecki & ebert 2004). these components of local adaptation can evolve relatively fast and over short distances for salmonids (kinnison et al. 1998; hendry & kinnison 1999; haugen & vøllestad 2001), and is even documented under extensive gene ﬂow, under effects from severe population bottleneck episodes and genetic drift (koskinen et al. 2002). fitness has repeatedly been demonstrated to be sensitive to phenotypic variation for traits expressed early in life (stearns 1992), which is also pertinent for salmonid studies (einum & fleming 2000; hendry & stearns 2004). if mortality is high during early life stages, any adaptation that results in a slight reduction of mortality may have profound ﬁtness advantages. in salmonids, the level of density regulation among juveniles has a tremendous impact on the evolution of fecundity (egg number), egg size (progeny size) and gonad investment (product of the former two traits). here, a high level of competitive interactions among juveniles is suggested to select against small egg size (parker & begon 1986; elliott 1994). an increasing amount of ﬁeld-derived and experimental data show that: (i) large juveniles hatch from large eggs (einum & fleming 1999; einum 2003) and (ii) large juveniles experience higher survival and growth rate (hutchings 1991; elliott 1994; einum et al. 2002), and (iii) there doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00129.x 237 environmental conditions (fry density in particular) and egg size values, (ii) investigate the degree of parallelism among demes from comparable environ- mental conditions and (iii) investigate the degree of among-deme differentiation in between-trait correla- tions for reproductive traits. study site the aursjøen reservoir is located in southwest nor- way (fig. 1). the reservoir was established in 1954 by damming three former lakes with initial altitudes of 851 (gautsjøen basin), 837.5 (grunningen basin) and 831 (aursjøen basin) m.a.s.l. highest regulated water level is 856 m.a.s.l., and lowest are 843.5, 837.5 and 827.3 m.a.s.l, respectively. the full reservoir is 24 km long with a maximum depth of 67 m and an area of 33.7 km2. at lowest water level, it covers 5.9 km2. the rock composition is dominantly pre-eucambrian granitic and granodiositic gneisses. this produces low- ionic water and ph in the 6.2–7.0 range (haugen & rygg 1996a; haugen 2000). the ﬁsh community consists of equal amounts of brown_trout and grayling (thymallus_thymallus (l.)). the total ﬁsh density is estimated to be low; on )1 (haugen & rygg 1996a; haugen average 0.8 kg ha 2000). brown_trout recruitment has been documented in 28 tributaries. given the differential habitat utilisa- tion and diet, it is assumed that there are minimal gregersen et al. are considerable additive genetic variance for egg size (einum et al. 2004). it trade-off patterns may increase the variance in trait distributions (jonsson & jonsson 1999; kinnison et al. 2001; quinn et al. 2004), consequently reducing the chance of detecting single-trait differentiation. hence, analysis of local adaptation processes should incor- porate the trade-off structure among traits. the magnitude of within-population variance is a result of individuals experiencing and responding differen- tially to spatial and temporal environmental variation. for instance, mature individuals partition income to growth or reproduction, and the reproductive energy can be used in the continuum from many small to few big eggs. higher investment in reproduction reduces growth and future survival. these trade-off structures between offspring number and offspring survival (smith & fretwell 1974; elgar 1990; jonsson & jonsson 1999) or gonad investment and growth and future survival (bell 1980; lester et al. 2004) are well documented. is these trade-off patterns, which diverge among systems (einum et al. 2004), and consequently urge the usage of multivariate explora- tions to separate effects (legendre & legendre 1998). in adaptation studies is documenting phenotypic differentiation among popu- lations measured under natural conditions. the aim is often to identify correlations between phenotypic values and a set of environmental variables having previously been shown to affect ﬁtness for the traits of interest, and/or demonstrating parallelism between populations, and/or comparing optimisation-based predictions with observed values (endler 1986; kawecki & ebert 2004). as such studies are based on trait values measured under natural, hence uncon- trolled, environmental conditions, they can only suggest what selective factors may have caused eventual observed divergence patterns. however, such suggestions form the basis for designing controlled experiments aimed at estimating selection intensities and the genetic architecture behind adaptations. a typical starting point the present paper explores divergence in egg size and fecundity among demes of brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) inhabiting the same lake, where the selective mechanism is hypothesised to be density-dependent interaction intensities among juveniles within the same habitat. the study system, the aursjøen reservoir in norway, is a climatically variable and oligotrophic fresh water system situated at a high altitude (haugen & rygg 1996a). previous surveys in 40 aursjøen tributaries revealed large among-tributary variation in fry density and a large within- and among-tributary environmental heterogeneity. this study explores whether egg size has differentiated in response to these biotic and abiotic conditions. our approach has been to: (i) check for potential correlations between 238 fig. 1. location of the aursjøen reservoir and the study tributaries. table 1. environmental characteristics and fry data for the ﬁve study tributaries in aursjøen reservoir measured in 1995/96. mean and sd of environmental (12 transects) and fry data of two stations from each tributary. tributary character kroka˚tbekken* geita˚e søre grøven midtre grøven* kvita aursjøen basin gautsjøen basin sympatric differentiation in brown_trout fish-producing length (m) gradient (m/m) tributary width (m) water depth (m) water ﬂow (m3 s)1) bedrock (%) blocks (%) coarse stone (%) gravel (%) sand (%) silt (%) temperature 1995  temperature 1996  mean fry density (individuals/m2) density early/lateà length mean (mm)§ length back-calculated§ 150 0.023 1.21 ± 0.32 0.22 ± 0.11 0.010 0.83 ± 2.9 20.8 ± 19.8 34.2 ± 12.4 29.2 ± 13.8 7.5 ± 8.7 7.5 ± 9.7 10.66 ± 1.90 10.03 ± 2.29 2.25 6.47/0.62 44.7 ± 8.1 43.7 400 0.063 10–15 0.31 ± 0.14 0.817 7.5 ± 13.7 70.4 ± 24 19.6 ± 13.1 2.5 ± 4 0 0 7.87 ± 1.50 8.21 ± 2.29 0.19 0.07/0.25 39.5 ± 4.6 42.7 300 0.033 3.96 ± 0.96 0.31 ± 0.09 0.116 50.8 ± 41.4 32.1 ± 31.1 15.8 ± 22.1 1.25 ± 3.1 0 0 8.66 ± 1.73 8.49 ± 2.57 0.46 0.78/0.31 38.4 ± 4 39.5 300 0.010 2.21 ± 0.99 0.2 ± 0.12 0.128 16.7 ± 30.5 40.8 ± 26.1 29.6 ± 18.3 11.3 ± 6.8 0 0 – 9.35 ± 2.30 2.66 4.82/0.31 37.3±4.8 41.1 *kroka˚tbekken had dried out 12. august and midtre grøven was not sampled in 1995.  the temperature values constitute mean and sd of weekly values from the july to september of the years 1995 and 1996. àthe highest density recorded in the swim-up sampling period and lowest density in late autumn. §length: empiric mean length in the end of growth season and back-calculated length in the end of growth season from all adult trout. 600 0.025 6.67 ± 2.1 0.31 ± 0.2 0.343 0 48.3 ± 17.5 48.3 ± 16.4 3.3 ± 4.9 0 0 9.24 ± 1.92 8.99 ± 2.57 0.33 0.12/0.23 36.9 ± 3.7 43.8 competitive interactions between the two species (haugen & rygg 1996a,b). due to loss of spawning areas, a compensatory stocking programme has been conducted. the stocked trout do not constitute a high percentage of (vøllestad & hesthagen 2001). in the 1996 sampling season, 6.4% out of the total catch were stocked ﬁsh (identiﬁed from ﬁn-clipping). these ﬁsh were excluded from all analyses. trout biomass the parallel tributaries were selected across an environ- mental gradient (with respect to previously measured fry densities) in two of the basins (aursjøen and gautsjøen basins). three pairs of neighbouring tribu- taries that had high and low fry density were originally selected; veslekvita, kvita, søre grøven, midtre grøven, geita˚e and kroka˚tbekken (fig. 1). this was done in order to explore parallelism in trait values and to exclude spatial effects. unfortunately, veslekvita was excluded due to very low densities of fry (summer drought). the tributary environments and fry densities varied greatly, with high fry-density tributaries having the largest proportion of suitable spawning area (gravel) (table 1). fry surveys in 1995, 1996 and 2004 conﬁrmed that the tributaries could be grouped into high- and low-density tributaries (table 1, unpub- lished data). midtre grøven and kroka˚tbekken have the largest proportion of suitable spawning area (gravel), the highest fry densities, and the highest density reductions of fry through the growth season. estimated instantaneous per capita mortality rates (z, estimated from fry density values available in table 1) were three times higher in kroka˚tbekken and midtre grøven (z ¼ 0.03 per day) compared with søre grøven (z ¼ 0.01 per day). fry abundance data were too low and uncertain for estimation of z for geita˚e and kvita. however, it is obvious from table 1 that z is low in these systems. consequently, there is a positive relationship between gravel composition, density and instantaneous per capita mortality. temperature data from 1995 and 1996 revealed considerable among- tributary differences in summer temperature (table 1). material and methods during ﬁve sampling seasons, 932 mature brown_trout individuals were collected from the ﬁve study tribu- taries of which 239 individuals were mature females. a major part of the material was collected during the entire 1996 spawning season. an additional material of mature females was supplemented from 1994, 1995, 1997 and 2004. this additional material constituted 16 (29%) individuals in geita˚e, 13 (100%) in kroka˚tbek- ken, 10 (30%) in kvita, 20 (34%) in midtre grøven and 15 (33%) in søre grøven. spawning adults were collected using electric ﬁshing and fyke nets. the ﬁsh was sexed, length (fork length) and weight was measured and scale-samples were taken before releas- ing the ﬁsh. as a measure of individual condition status, we used fulton’s condition factor (wootton 1990). a sample of 149 females was killed by an overdose of benzokain, and otoliths and gonads were taken. all these ﬁsh were categorised as stage 6 (crim & glebe 1990), i.e., immediately prior to ovulation. all gonad samples were frozen and brought to the 239 gregersen et al. p laboratory for further measurements. gonad size (wet weight) was measured to the nearest 0.1 g. to calculate fecundity, three subsamples from the gonad were weighed and counted. fecundity was then estimated: f ¼ wg/( gi/ni)/3 (wg ¼ gonad size, gi ¼ weight of subsample i, ni ¼ number of eggs in subsample i). a sample of 10–20 eggs from each female were dried at 60 °c for 5 days and weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg. egg size varied to some extent within individuals (cv: 5.38% ± sd 2.19), and the mean egg size was used for further analysis. age and length-at-age were revealed from scale readings (jonsson & stenseth 1976), and validated using otoliths. we found no systematic difference in the ageing results between the two methods. for the 1994 and 1995 material, the egg dry weights were estimated using egg wet weights from available gonad size and fecundity, and the dry weight versus wet weight regression material (wdry ¼ 1.49 + 0.326 wwet, r2 ¼ 0.89, p < 0.0001). analyses of among-individual variation in growth and condition factor were performed using nested anova with the general structure: remainder from the yijk ¼ lk þ ajðkþ þ eijk; where y is the dependent variable (i.e., length-at-age and condition factor) for individual i in tributary j located in (i.e., nested under) basin k, l is the mean expectation, a constitutes the tributary effect coefﬁ- cient and e is the error variance. the rationale for employing the nested structure was that potential environmental (climate, ﬁshing pressure, ﬁsh density, food abundance) and ancestral genetic variation (the basins were formerly separated by a waterfall) might exist between basins. consequently, all statistical models used in this study were a priori nested. when exploring the differentiation in reproductive traits, we aimed at separating the unique tributary effects from large-scale environmental spatial vari- ation (basin effect) and maternal effects (ﬁsh length and ﬁsh condition). we did so by analysing the variation and covariation between the reproductive traits using nested mancova: males geitåe krokåtbekken kvita midtre grøven søre grøven 400 350 300 250 200 ) m m ( h t g n e l 400 350 300 250 200 5 6 age (year) 7 8 9 150 4 5 6 age (year) 7 8 9 150 2 3 4 240 yijk ¼ lk þ ajðkþ þ bkxijk þ eijk; where y is the response matrix containing columns with individual egg size and fecundity values, l is a vector containing basin-wise effect coefﬁcients for the two traits, a is a vector containing tributary effect coefﬁcients, b is a vector containing basin-speciﬁc slope coefﬁcients for a covariate (e.g., length or condition factor) of the two traits and e is the error matrix. in most models both length and condition factors were included as covariates to assure correction of maternal effects caused mainly by environmental factors. the mancova was ﬁtted using an identity response matrix. the covariance structure between the reproductive traits was further explored by regression of residuals from these models. in order to homoge- nise the variance, both response- and covariate variables were ln-transformed and standardised to have mean zero and sd equal to one. in order to test for differentiation in egg size according to intertribu- tary fry density variation we used two different approaches: (i) by regressing least square mean egg size to fry density (corrected for basin effects) and (ii) by performing a post-hoc contrast test between high- and low-fry density tributaries. the univariate statis- tical analyses were performed in jmp version 5.1 (sas institute 2003, cary, nc, usa) and multivariate analyses were performed in sas version 9.1 (http:// support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sas9doc.html) by employing the manova statement under the glm procedure (i.e., generalised linear model). results spawning population structure there was a considerable amount of variation in individual length, weight, growth and age within each tributary (fig. 2). however, large among-tributary differences were also found. the length, weight and age distribution of the 932 sampled spawning trout had the following ranges: 146–420 mm (mean 270 ± sd 57), 46–681 g (mean 220 ± sd 129) and females fig. 2. age-speciﬁc ﬁsh length (mean and sd) of spawning brown_trout from the ﬁve study tributaries, partitioned into males (left) and females (right). note that square sym- bols represent tributaries from aursjøen basin and circular symbols represent tribu- taries from gautsjøen basin. filled, grey and open symbols constitute high-, middle- and low-density (of fry) tributaries, respectively. the same symbol pattern has been used in all ﬁgures. 3–11 years (mean 5.6 ± sd 1.3) (fig. 2). males were considerably more numerous (nfemale: 293, nmale: 639), younger (mean agefemale: 6.62, mean agemale: 5.22) and smaller (mean lengthfemale: 330, mean lengthmale: 243) than females (fig. 2). there were signiﬁcant differences in sex ratio among tributaries (p ¼ 0.045), where the male proportion was higher in midtre grøven (75%) and kroka˚tbekken (80%). the length distribution of spawning trout was signiﬁcantly different sexes (p < 0.0001), where the largest trout of both males and females were found in geita˚e and kroka˚tbekken (fig. 2). the age distribution of spawning trout was signiﬁcantly different among tributaries for both sexes (pmale < 0.0002, pfemale < 0.0129). males were oldest in geita˚e and kroka˚tbekken, and females were oldest in søre grøven and geita˚e. growth rate (i.e., length- at-age) differed signiﬁcantly among tributaries and between basins for both males (ptributary ¼ 0.0183, (ptributary ¼ 0.0332, pbasin < 0.0001) and females tributaries among for both sympatric differentiation in brown_trout pbasin < 0.0001). the growth rate was considerably higher for individuals belonging to tributaries draining into the aursjøen basin (least square means: aursjøen compared with gautsjøen males: 256 and 235 mm;

(1993a,b) has shown that considerable density regu- lation may result from considerable limitation of territories in a lake’s littoral zone. in fact, most tributaries in aursjøen reservoir lack juveniles older than yearlings (own unpublished data), showing that the juveniles distribute themselves in the littoral areas at a very early stage in life. hence, differential juvenile density regulation intensity at the basin level may have caused the observed egg size differentiation via similar mechanisms that cause among-tributary differentiation within basins. interindividual variation in reproductive traits within tributaries was much higher than the among- tributary variation. however, the between-trait corre- lation pattern was very similar both at the individual and tributary levels of variation (figs 4 and 5b), a result that is supposedly governed by similar maternal and trade-off effects. marked growth (maternal) effects on reproductive traits, as found in this study, are well known in salmonids (for a discussion, see koops et al. 2004 and einum et al. 2004). the negative correlation between fecundity and egg size reﬂects two of the most widely documented life-history trait trade-offs; number versus size of offspring, and reproductive investment versus growth/survival (for a discussion, see smith & fretwell 1974; roff 1992; jonsson & jonsson 1999; kinnison et al. 2001; einum et al. 2004; lester et al. 2004). our results show that there is a large variation in trait values within tributaries. such a pattern may result from environmental heterogeneity, and may constitute an adaptation to variable and unpredictable conditions. temporal environmental heterogeneity may impose adaptive phenotypic plas- ticity and local environmental heterogeneity may also favour numerous strategies within the same tributary 244 (kawecki & ebert 2004; einum & nislow 2005). indeed, the study tributaries constitute heterogenic habitats, both in time and space, being located at a high altitude with a harsh and unpredictable weather. to evaluate to what degree this pattern is purely phenotypic plasticity or genetic divergence (i.e., local adaptation) common-garden and/or reciprocal trans- plant experiments have to be conducted. such experiments should be constructed so as to evaluate the degree of differentiation in phenotypic plasticity pattern (adaptive phenotypic plasticity). many studies link ﬁrst-year growth to egg size, with different results (jonsson et al. 1996; quinn et al. 2004). our study found no association between maternal ﬁrst- or last-year growth and egg size. however, if ﬁrst-year growth had been expressed relative to maximum growth potential for a given temperature, the picture might have looked differ- ently. higher density of juveniles reduces food per individual and thereby suppresses growth, for a given ration of food. unfortunately, such data are not available for our study system. other early-life stress episodes can promote life-history trait divergence through physiological adaptive plastic responses. for instance, individuals living under stressful conditions as juveniles may, via endocrine mechanisms, produce larger eggs than individuals that do not. the selective advantage for such a plastic response will depend on the temporal variability in the environmental stres- sors. egg size evolution can also be driven by tempera- ture adaptations of energy contents in eggs, as indicated for sea_trout in norway by jonsson & jonsson (1999). in this sea_trout study, the authors suggest that higher temperature during egg incubation increases metabolic demands and selects for higher energy stores in the eggs, i.e., larger eggs. such an effect may occur in our study system as well. unfortunately, no incubation temperatures are avail- able from our study system. however, during incuba- tion the tributary temperature is expected to be more or less the same due to similar ground water inﬂuence during winter and early spring. futhermore, eventual incubation temperature differentiation cannot explain the between-individual differentiation or among-trait correlation structure within demes and/or between basins. assuming incubation temperature to be positively correlated with summer temperatures, we ﬁnd that the mean summer temperature is positively associated with adjusted egg size (k ¼ 0.5, p ¼ 0.38), and therefore indirectly supportive of the temperature- adaptation hypothesis. a two-way common-garden experiment with both fry density and temperature treatments (at ﬁxed rations of food) will have to be conducted to resolve which factor contributes most to the observed differentiation pattern. in conclusion, this study suggests that the observed differentiation in the egg size has resulted as a response to differential density-dependent fry interaction inten- sities among tributaries. in addition, a heterogeneous environment has caused large trait variation within tributaries. however, the reproductive traits follow similar and strict trade-off and maternal effect rules for all tributaries. by employing a mancova approach, we were able to address some of the most inﬂuential trade- offs and control for important environmental variables that are expressed via the maternal phenotype. this allowed us to decipher results for egg size differenti- ation amongst the ﬁve demes studied that would otherwise have remained obscured. the results suggest that divergence in reproductive traits can occur over a small spatial scale (<100 m) even under sympatric conditions. acknowledgements we thank aetat (fg) and university of oslo (fg, toh and ønl) for a successful cooperation and funding making this project possible. we further thank
