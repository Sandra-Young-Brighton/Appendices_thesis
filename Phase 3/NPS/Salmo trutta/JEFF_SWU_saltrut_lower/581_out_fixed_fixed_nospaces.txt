(6°34.97¢n, 2°23.75¢e) and lake hlan (6°56.88¢n, 2°19.48¢e). this region has a sub-equatorial climate with long and short wet seasons (mid-march to mid- july; mid-september to october) and long and short dry seasons (november to mid-march; august to mid- september) (fig. 2). annual rainfall recorded for 2002 was 1167 mm (service de la mete´orologie nationale, agence pour la securite de navigation aerienne 2003), and the highest monthly rainfall during the investigation was 439 mm for june 2002. the soˆ river is a tributary of the lower oue´me´ river. the soˆ ﬂows southward, parallel to the oue´me´, approxi- mately 100 km through a ﬂoodplain covering approxi- mately 1000 km2 (van thielen et al. 1987). hydrology of rivers in southern benin is strongly inﬂuenced by seasonal rainfall in the northern region. during the peak ﬂood season (october to november), water from the oue´me´ and soˆ rivers covers extensive ﬂoodplains (fig. 1). several habitat features were characterised at each sampling site (water quality, aquatic vegetation, substrate, riparian vegetation and land use). water depth was measured using a calibrated rope. temperature and the dissolved oxygen were measured to the nearest )1, respectively, with a digital 0.1 °c and 0.1 mgæl oxythermometer. turbidity was measured to the nearest millimetre with a secchi disk (hydro-bios, kiel, germany). ph was measured to the nearest 0.1 with a portable ph meter. salinity, total dissolved solids (tds) and conductivity were measured to the nearest 1, 0.1 )1, respectively, with a conductivity meter. and 0.1 mgæl nitrates, nitrites and total iron were measured to the )1 via titration with merck reagents nearest 0.01 mgæl (aquamerck, darmstadt, germany). during the study period, water depth in the main river channel in the study area averaged 421 (±210 sd) cm and turbidity averaged 40 cm (±28 cm). dissolved )1 (9–77% oxygen ranged between 0.4 and 4.5 mgæl saturation). most other physical and chemical features reveal less variation; mean water temperature during the study was 28.6 (±2.2) °c, ph averaged 5.4 (±0.6), )1 electrical conductivity averaged 99.45 (±3.1) lsæcm )1. nitrite and and average tds was 46.7 (±5.4) mgæl 32 total iron concentrations averaged 0.002 (±0.0015) and )1, respectively. the dominant ﬂoat- 1.04 (±0.66) mgæl ing macrophyte on the soˆ river is the water hyacinth (eicchornia crassipes), a species that invaded the system about 20 years ago. other common aquatic plants are pistia stratiotes (aracea) and ipomea aquatica (convolvulaceae). palms (elaies guinensis) are the dominant riparian tree. lake hlan is located near kpomey village (sehoue county) about 80 km from the atlantic coast. locally known as ‘the bonytongue lake’, lake hlan receives comparatively low exploitation owing to local enforce- ment of traditional ﬁshing regulations. lake hlan has a lower average depth (250 ± 128 cm sd) than the study reach on the soˆ river. the annual ﬂood was very low in lake hlan during august to november 2002, but occurred normally during this period in 2003 (fig. 2). dissolved oxygen (measured between )1 (1.5% of 1000 and 1400 h) ranged from 0.1 mgæl )1

lsæcm (±2.8) mgæl iron concentration were low and averaged 0.002 (±0.001) and 0.67 )1, respectively. floating grasses, such as (±0.26) mgæl cyperus difformis (cyperaceae), cover large areas of the lake and hinder ﬁshing activities. wind-driven movement of grass mats sometimes damages ﬁshing gear. these grasses also provide habitat for many aquatic organisms, including small ﬁshes. water hyacinth is present in lake hlan, but at low biomass compared with most areas of the river channel. other common ﬂoating macrophytes in lake hlan were p. stratiotes, azolla africana, nymphaea lotus and nymphaea maculatus (nymphaeacea), e. crassipes and echinochloa pyramides (poacee). submerged plants included ceratophyllum demersum (cerato- phyllaceae) and utricularia inﬂexa (lantibulariaceae). )1. nitrites and total taxonomy heterotis niloticus is one of the two living represent- atives of the family osteoglossidae, a lineage within the ancient ﬁsh order osteoglossiformes, on the african continent (the other species is the freshwater butterﬂyﬁsh, pantodon buchholtzi). according to guo-qing & wilson (1996), the osteoglossidae also contains two genera and three species in south america and one genus and three species in southeast asia-east indies-australian region. according to ferraris (2003), h. niloticus and arapaima gigas (south america) are considered by many ichthyolo- gists as the sole members of a separate family, the arapaimatidae. other living osteoglossiformes include the mormyridae (africa), gymnarchidae heterotis reproduction and population structure in a west african ﬂoodplain system (africa), and notopteridae (africa and asia). except for pantondon (an egg scatterer), osteoglossids per- form parental care – mouth brooding in osteoglossum and scleropages spp., and nest guarding in arapaima and heterotis. fish samples (50–80 mm mesh). fish were surveyed each month from july 2002 to december 2003. in the soˆ river, heterotis were collected from both aquatic vegetation and open water at four sites located near the villages of ‘ahome-blon’, ‘ahome-lokpo’, ‘zoungome’ and ‘kinto’. patches of vegetation were encircled with a net (2 m high, 10- mm mesh), and vegetation and ﬁsh were removed. open water areas of the river were sampled with a cast net in lake hlan, ﬁsh were collected with traps (80 mm long, 50 mm opening), gill nets (20 m · 2 m, 60-mm bar mesh) and hooks. local ﬁshermen were enlisted to set traps in vegetation close to the openings of active nests. all captured size classes were retained for analysis. at lake hlan, monthly survey effort was determined by requirements to obtain at least 15 individuals pertaining to adult size classes. adult size classes were rare at soˆ river survey sites. each month, sampling effort was continued until the total sample had a fairly consistent population size structure (i.e., additional castnet samples did not appreciably change the size structure of the sample). sampling effort was greater during the high-water period (august to november) when ﬁsh were dis- persed in the ﬂoodplain. heterotis nests are circular clearings within dense stands of rooted and submerged or emergent aquatic macrophytes in shallow (<2 m) water. nests are highly conspicuous, even under moderately turbid water conditions (secchi depth 0.5–1), due to the fact that rooted aquatic vegetation extends near or beyond the water surface. each nest has a cleared channel through the vegetation that allows adult ﬁsh to pass between the conﬁnes of the nest and open water. twenty active nests were randomly selected and 12 physical and chemical features (water depth, water transparency, nest diameter, nest opening, height of surrounding vegetation, temperature, ph, dissolved oxygen, oxy- gen saturation, conductivity, total iron and nitrite) were measured at the centre of the nest. estimated each month at lake hlan were the number of active heterotis nests per hectare, monthly ﬁshing effort (number of traps placed in nest openings), number of nests trapped per hectare, and water depth in the middle of the lake. abandoned nests with openings blocked by vegetation and lacking evidence of active use by brooding ﬁsh were not counted. the entire school of larvae was collected from seven nests to estimate brood size. specimens were measured [total length (tl) and standard length (sl)] in situ to the nearest millimetre then weighed to the nearest gram with an electronic balance. pressure was applied to the ventral abdominal wall to determine if gonads were fully mature (indicated by expulsion of oocytes). specimens were dissected, and gonads were removed for length, width and weight measurements. gender was determined by macroscopical examination of gonads (moreau 1982). gonad maturation stages were estimated using a modiﬁed version of stages described by amon-koth- ias (1980). female stages were: (1) immature (juven- ile) – very small gonad, ovary pink with oocytes invisible to naked eye; (2) early maturation – intermediate size ovary with very small pale-yellow oocytes visible to naked eye; (3) advanced maturation – very developed ovary with yellow-orange (postvi- tellogenic) oocytes; (4) ripe ovary – fully developed ovary ﬁlls ventral region of the abdominal cavity, eggs are postvitellogenic and expulsed when external pressure is applied to the ventrum; and (5) postspawning – ovary is ﬂaccid without signiﬁcant presence of mature oocytes. male maturation stages were: (1) immature (juvenile) – undeveloped testis consisting of a translucent ﬁlament; (2) early maturation – intermediate size testis having a very light yellow or tan colour; (3) advanced matur- ation – large testis, opaque white or light tan colour with numerous small, black spots; (4) ripe testis – fully developed testis, pressure applied to ventrum expulses white milt; and (5) postspawning–ﬂaccid testis without milt. (diameter 2.5–3.0 mm) after staging, gonads were ﬁxed in 5% formalin and transported to the laboratory (department of zoology & genetics, university of abomey-calavi). after 1– 7 days, preserved gonads were removed from formalin and stored in 75% ethanol. batch fecundity was estimated as the total number of mature oocytes extrapolated from three 1-g samples taken from each ovary (samples from anterior, middle and posterior portions of the ovary). each sample was weighed to the nearest 0.1 g, and mature oocytes in each sample were separated with the aid of dissecting needles. mature (fully yolked) oocytes have a yellow-orange colour. diameters of 10 mature oocytes from each of nine gonads were measured using an ocular micro- meter attached to a dissecting stereomicroscope. data analysis frequency histograms of ﬁsh size intervals were constructed for samples from both sampling areas. length–weight relationships were examined for pop- ulations associated with different habitats, genders, size intervals and hydrological seasons according to the linear relationship. log w ¼ log a + b log l, 33 adite et al. where l is the total length, w the weight, a a constant and b the allometry coefﬁcient (tesch 1971). univa- riate analysis of variance was used to test for between- group differences in slope. sex ratio was estimated for the collective samples from each region. the gonadosomatic index (gsi) was computed using the following formula: gsi ¼ (gonad weight/body weight) · 100 to evaluate reproductive periodicity, mean gsi was plotted for each month and region. size at sexual maturation (l50) was estimated as the size at which 50% of individuals were classiﬁed as ‘mature’ or ‘advanced maturation’ stages (albaret 1977). l50 was estimated from a sigmoid curve constructed with the percentage of mature individuals and associated size class categories. a frequency distribution was plotted for oocyte diameter based on ovaries in the top 10th percentile of gsi values. fecundity was estimated for mature ovaries, and the allometric relationship be- tween fecundity and body length was examined as f ¼ alb, where f is the fecundity, l the total length, a a constant and b the allometry exponent. the linear relationship of fecundity with body weight was examined as f ¼ bw + a, where f is the fecundity, w the body weight, a the intercept and b the slope. results population structure heterotis population size structure was markedly different in lake hlan (bimodal distribution) and the soˆ river (unimodal distribution, fig. 3). even with many small ﬁsh forming the ﬁrst mode in the size distribution, the average body size was larger in lake hlan than the river. the mean sl for lake hlan was 370 mm (range 74–762 mm) and mean weight was 1.13 kg (range 0.005–4.75 kg); soˆ river ﬁsh averaged 305 mm (range 148–765 mm) and 0.46 kg (range 0.05–5.84 kg). of 908 specimens collected from lake hlan, 36.4% were juveniles (<300 mm), most of which were collected during the high-water season. subadults (300–500 mm) comprised 17.8% and adults (>500 mm) comprised 45.7% of the lake population. of the 553 specimens collected from the river, 35.1% were juveniles (<300 mm), 60.2% were subadults s l a u d i v i d n i f o r e b m u n 300 200 100 0 lake hlan sô river 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 sl interval (mm) fig. 3. size structure of heterotis niloticus samples from the soˆ river and lake hlan during july 2002 to december 2003. table 1. log (tl) ) log (w) regressions for heterotis by habitat, gender, size class and season from the soˆ river and lake hlan. n 908 553 465 443 320 233 573 335 543 10 139 561 208 29 309 215 habitat lake hlan soˆ river gender male – lake hlan female – lake hlan male – soˆ river female – soˆ river size juvenile – lake hlan adult – lake hlan juvenile – soˆ river adult – soˆ river season wet – hlan flood – hlan dry – hlan wet – soˆ river flood – soˆ river dry – soˆ river p < 0.001 for all regression slopes. 34 slope 95% ci 2.81 2.94 2.81 2.80 3.03 2.81 2.89 2.75 3.00 4.05 2.77 2.82 2.74 2.79 2.94 3.26 2.79–2.83 2.87–3.01 2.79–2.84 2.78–2.83 2.95–3.11 2.67–2.94 2.85–2.92 2.57–2.92 2.92–3.08 2.83–5.27 2.62–2.92 2.80–2.84 2.65–2.83 2.53–3.05 2.87–3.00 3.09–3.43 r2 0.99 0.92 0.99 0.99 0.94 0.88 0.98 0.74 0.91 0.90 0.91 0.99 0.95 0.95 0.96 0.87 intercept 95% ci )4.47 )4.73 )4.47 )4.44 )4.94 )4.39 )4.63 )4.30 )4.87 )7.91 )4.38 )4.49 )4.27 )4.40 )4.70 )5.53 )4.51–()4.42) )4.90–()4.55) )4.53–()4.41) )4.50–()3.80) )5.14–(4.74) )4.73–()4.05) )4.71–()4.56) )4.79–()3.81) )5.07–()4.67) )11.34–()4.48) )4.80–()3.96) )4.54–()4.43) )4.50–()4.04) )5.08–()3.71) )4.78–()4.54) )5.95–()5.11) heterotis reproduction and population structure in a west african ﬂoodplain system 100 80 60 40 20 s l a u d i v i d n i e r u t a m f o  % 0 0 100 80 60 40 20 s l a u d i v i d n i e r u t a m f o  % 0 0 males 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 females 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 total length (mm) fig. 5. percentages of male and female heterotis from the soˆ river–lake hlan system with mature gonads (stages 2–5) by body length. length at maturation is estimated as the length at which 50% of individuals are mature as predicted by a sigmoid curve ﬁt to the data. both males and females (fig. 5). the size at which 50% of individuals were mature was about 575 mm tl for both genders. the smallest mature male (stage 2 gonad) was 560 mm tl (515 mm sl, 1.49 kg), and the smallest mature female (stage 2) was 545 mm tl (499 mm sl;

(number of oocytes per gram of body mass) revealed no general association with body size. nesting and brooding the mean monthly density of active heterotis nests encountered in lake hlan was 25.4 per hectare, with an average of 37–51 nests per hectare/month observed during the peak spawning period (may to august). no active nests were observed from december to febru- ary, with £10 observed during november and march. the percentage of identiﬁable nests that were active was >85% from july to september 2002 (january to june not surveyed) and from april to october 2003. nests averaged 116 cm in diameter (range 77– 165 cm) and occurred at an average water depth of 60 cm (range 40–86 cm). height of submerged and emergent vegetation surrounding nests ranged from 30 to 135 cm (mean ¼ 89 cm), and the diameter of nest entrances ranged from 20 to 47 cm (mean ¼ 33 cm). tending of nests and broods occurs from the time of hatching until juveniles disperse from the nest. when nests containing newly hatched larvae were disturbed, both parents took larvae into their mouths for trans- portation to another location (a. adite, personal observations). heterotis larvae were collected from seven active nests using a dipnet, and transported to heterotis reproduction and population structure in a west african ﬂoodplain system the laboratory for enumeration and use in rearing experiments. the number of larvae per nest ranged from 3953 to 6125 (mean ¼ 5028). fishing pressure on nesting bonytongues was assessed on a monthly basis by estimating the total number of active nests with ﬁshing traps positioned at nest openings. monthly trapping effort was positively correlated with the density of active nests (r2 ¼ 0.92; p < 0.01; n ¼ 18), with 87.8% of active nests having traps. discussion

river–lake hlan heterotis size classes (n ¼ 123). water (wet) and peak ﬂood seasons indicate that lake hlan is an important spawning site for bonytongues. in contrast, more than 90% of the bonytongues collected from the lower soˆ river and associated ﬂoodplain were captured during the ﬂood and early falling water periods (october to november), and almost all these individuals were juveniles and subadults. thus, it appears that juvenile bonytongues migrate from lakes into the ﬂooded plains, with many individuals making their way south to the vast, productive plains of the lower soˆ and oue´me´ rivers. this hypothesis is supported by the size distributions in the two regions. the lake hlan population contained many large breeding adults and small juveniles but few interme- diate size classes. these intermediate size classes strongly dominated the river ﬂoodplain region to the south. the densely vegetated river ﬂoodplains prob- ably provide abundant food resources that support rapid growth of these omnivores (adite et al. 2005). in the soˆ river, ﬁsh condition increased gradually from the start of the wet season through the peak ﬂood then falling water (dry) period. as ﬂoodwaters recede, invertebrate prey, food resource et al. 2005), probably become concentrated within shrinking aquatic habitats. adult bonytongues in lake hlan consume a mixture of aquatic invertebrates, seeds and detritus (adite et al. 2005). lake hlan bonytongues, nearly half of which were adults, were in best condition during the wet and ﬂood seasons when access to seeds from submerged and emergent terrest- rial vegetation should have been greatest. a particularly important (adite for juvenile bonytongues the spawning period of bonytongues was restricted to the wet and ﬂood periods, a pattern commonly documented for large ﬁsh species inhabiting large rivers and wetlands in africa (e.g., winemiller 1991;laleye et al. 1995). flooding at lake hlan was more extensive during 2003 than 2002. as the lake level gradually rises during the wet season (march to july), bonytongues select sites and construct their nests in shallow marginal areas of the lake. during the high ﬂood of 2003, most bonytongues abandoned their original nests when water depth became too great at to october, new nests appeared along newly ﬂooded lake margins. these locations. from august tl

response to excessive ﬂooding could partially explain why the egg-size distribution in the most mature ovary was less skewed toward the largest diameters during 2003 relative to that from 2002. the 2003 ovary was spawner (re-nester) that was responding to a sudden disruption of the reproductive cycle, whereas the 2002 ovary was from a female preparing to nest for the ﬁrst time in response to seasonal environmental cues. second-time from a fishing activity is intense in the soˆ river system, and bonytongues dominate the catch during the ﬂood season (gbaguidi & pfeiffer 1996). during this period, more than two-thirds of resident and migrant ﬁsher- men exploit this seasonally available resource. large cast nets are the most efﬁcient and popular means for catching bonytongues in this river ﬁshery. as almost no adults were captured from the survey region in the lower soˆ river, this subpopulation appears to be a metapopulation sink (pulliam 1988) maintained by periodic immigration from a source subpopulation. because spawning and brooding bonytongues are common in shallow waters along the margins of ﬂoodplain lakes, these habitats probably support source populations that sustain the large ﬁshery in the river and ﬂoodplain downstream. lake hlan is one of the largest lakes in the soˆ river ﬂoodplain, and is well known locally as the ‘bonytongue lake’. in lake hlan, castnetting is prohibited by local regulations, but bonytongues are caught with ﬁsh traps placed at nest entrances. this practice increases mortality not only on adult stocks, but also on larval cohorts vulnerable to predators when parental brooders are removed from their nests. between 1 and 7 days posthatch, larvae have large yolk sacs and are incapable of signiﬁcant movement, and thus are particularly vulnerable. the african bonytongue matures at 2 years (moreau 1982) and has relatively large eggs (2.5–3.0 mm) and moderate batch fecundity (2700–27,500) for a ﬁsh of its size. consequently, the species displays a life history strategy that is closer to the equilibrium endpoint than the periodic endpoint (winemiller & rose 1992), which implies that parental care is essential for early life stage survivorship and levels of recruitment needed for long- term population viability (van winkle et al. 1993;rose et al. 2001). in theory, equilibrium life history strategies should be associated with signiﬁcant density-dependent recruitment, such that minimum or optimal densities of spawners could be estimated. maintenance of a healthy population of spawners in lake hlan (source subpop- ulation) is probably essential for sustainable ﬁsheries (sink subpopulations comprised of immature ﬁsh) in the soˆ river ﬂoodplain. nearly 90% of active nests in lake hlan had ﬁshing traps positioned at their entrances. this suggests that high ﬁshing effort that targets brooding adults could jeopardise this critical source subpopulation of bony- 38 tongues. in fact, adult bonytongues are exploited as they construct their nests, prepare to spawn and tend their broods. as local regulations prohibit use of cast nets in lake hlan, ﬁsh stocks in this system are less impacted than those in most other aquatic ecosystems in benin. nonetheless, the high economic value of bonytongues has induced many ﬁshermen to adopt unsustainable ﬁshing practices, such as trapping nests. interviews with ﬁshermen revealed that they are aware of potential negative impacts of trapping, yet they need this source of income to meet the most basic needs of their families. the chances for a sustainable bonytongue ﬁshery in the soˆ river system would be increased by better enforcement of ﬁshing regulations governing the open-access river ﬁshery coupled with community-based management of the lake hlan ﬁshery that reduces harvest during the peak period of nesting from april to august. the other major lakes in the lower soˆ river ﬂoodplain should be investi- gated to determine their potential for supporting source subpopulations of bonytongues and possibly other nesting ﬁsh species, such as tilapiine cichlids. resumen 1. la estructura poblacional del osteoglo´ sido africano, heterotis niloticus, fue estudiada en el lago hlan (sudeste de benin), y en un a´rea de la zona de inundacio´n del rı´o soˆ, localizada a unos 60 km. del lago, aguas abajo. ambas localidades mantienen importantes pesquerı´as, en las cuales h. niloticus es una de las especies ma´s importantes durante el periodo de inundacio´ n. 2. los adultos maduros constituyen >40% de la poblacio´ n del lago hlan, pero solo el 3.5% de los individuos capturados en el rı´o fueron adultos. los promedios mensuales del ı´ndice gonado-soma´tico y los porcentajes de individuos con go´ nadas maduras aumentaron al incrementar el nivel de las aguas durante el periodo de lluvias, y disminuyeron posteriormente durante el pico del periodo de inundacio´n. la distribucio´n de frecuencias de taman˜os de los oocitos en los ovarios, sugirio´ la posibilidad de producir una cohorte adicional en el caso en que halla perturbaciones durante la puesta. entre 37 a 51 nidos activos por hecta´rea fueron observados en el lago hlan durante el pico de desove (mayo-agosto). el nu´ mero de larvas por nido vario´ en el rango 3.953–6.125. 3. los osteoglo´ sidos del lago hlan parecen constituir una importante sub-poblacio´n ‘fuente’ que exporta nuevos reclutas a las a´reas bajas del rı´o y zonas de inundacio´n donde la intensa actividad pesquera explota principalmente juveniles y sub- adultos. consecuentemente, restricciones a la cosecha de osteoglo´sidos adultos en el lago hlan puede ser esencial para una pesca comercial sostenible en la parte baja del rı´o soˆ. acknowledgements we are grateful to dr g.n.
