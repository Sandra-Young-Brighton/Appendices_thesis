however, over 60% of the green sunﬁsh were age 2 to age 4. mean total annual mortality was .60% for cyprinids and averaged approxi- mately 44% for green sunﬁsh. the age-speciﬁc mortality of central stonerollers and red shiners was generally less than 45% between age 0 and 1 and increased to over 85% for ﬁshes greater than age 1. fish com- munity characteristics (e.g., catch per unit effort of trophic guilds) and chemical habitat (e.g., total phosphorous) were not related to growth rates (p.0.05). growth of central stonerollers was not signiﬁcantly correlated with physical habitat (p.0.05). however, the growth increments of creek chubs, red shiners, and green sunﬁsh were related to the amount of woody debris (e.g., total woody debris, log complex habitat; r.0.60; pﬁ0.05). the results of this study provide important information on the population dynamic rate functions of cyprinid and green sunﬁsh populations in small prairie streams. furthermore, these data suggest that woody debris is important habitat inﬂuencing growth of stream ﬁshes. m. c. quist, c. s. guy kansas cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, division of biology, kansas state university, manhattan, usa key words: growth;

karr 1981; karr et al. 1986) to summarize ﬁsh assem- blage characteristics into a single metric. the ibi scores are then correlated with habitat features to determine the inﬂuence of instream conditions on 88 structure (steedman community ﬁsh 1988; bramblett and fausch 1991). other researchers have compiled species into trophic guilds or toler- ance categories to determine the inﬂuence of habi- tat on ﬁsh communities (schlosser 1982a; gorman 1988; hughes and gammon 1987). at the popula- tion-level, numerous models have been developed to predict standing crop of ﬁshes from habitat characteristics (fausch et al. 1988). however, most of these studies have been conducted in large streams and rivers and have focused on sportﬁsh production. although these approaches may be appropriate for many research hypotheses, they rarely provide information on the factors that in- ﬂuence population dynamic rate functions (i.e. growth, mortality, and recruitment) – especially with respect to nongame species in small streams. growth and mortality are important popula- tion-level dynamics inﬂuencing the ecology and management of ﬁsh populations; however, most studies on growth and mortality have been con- ducted on sportﬁsh in lakes, reservoirs or large- river systems (e.g., colvin 1991; guy and willis 1995). conversely, studies investigating these pro- cesses are rare in stream ecosystems. this is unfor- tunate because growth and mortality rates directly inﬂuence the ecological role of individuals within the community and interactions among species, especially in size-structured populations (werner and gilliam 1984). the purpose of this study was to describe growth and mortality of ﬁshes inhabiting small prairie streams and to determine the inﬂuence of ﬁsh com- munity structure and physical and chemical habitat incremental growth data (i.e., from hard struc- tures) are labor intensive and expensive to collect (devries and frie 1996). consequently, most studies on growth of stream ﬁshes have used length-frequency distributions to determine age structure and growth rates (e.g., schlosser 1982a, 1985; bayley 1988). however, these analyses are usually limited to determining age and growth of younger age classes (i.e., less than age 2; devries and frie 1996). moreover, length-frequency analy- sis is suitable when an individual cohort is followed through time or when the population is comprised entirely of young individuals. if the population contains older ﬁsh (e.g., older than age 2), it may be difﬁcult to delineate age groups; thereby com- plicating or preventing growth analysis (devries and frie 1996). furthermore, analysis of length- frequency distributions only provides a measure of cumulative growth to the most recent age (unless cohorts are followed through time). conversely, in- cremental growth analysis provides a detailed his- tory of growth for each individual and may pro- vide important information when habitat charac- teristics inﬂuence age-groups differently. for example, putnam et al. (1995) studied the inﬂuence of habitat on size-speciﬁc growth rates of several species in illinois streams. the authors found that habitat variables explained up to 90% of the vari- ation in growth of several sportﬁsh (e.g., channel catﬁsh ictalurus largemouth bass micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass m. dolo- mieu, bluegill lepomis macrochirus). furthermore, the authors found that the inﬂuence of habitat de- pended on the size of individuals. punctatus, growth and mortality of prairie ﬁshes on growth rates. we selected four species for this study based on their differing habitat requirements and trophic characteristics. central stonerollers campostoma anomalum are usually found in small streams and rivers dominated by cobble, gravel and sand substrates (pﬂieger 1997). we selected central stonerollers, which primarily feed on benthic algae (kraatz 1923; pﬂieger 1997), to represent a her- bivorous species. creek chubs semotilus atromacul- atus and red shiners cyprinella lutrensis were se- lected to represent insectivorous species. creek chubs are ubiquitously distributed throughout the central united states and are most abundant in habitats consisting of cobble and gravel substrates, well-deﬁned pool-rifﬂe sequences and abundant cover (mcmahon 1982; pﬂieger 1997). red shiners are also highly abundant in prairie streams, espe- cially in highly degraded habitats, due to their abil- ity to tolerate a wide variety of environmental con- ditions (matthews and hill 1979; pﬂieger 1997). throughout life, red shiners live in schools near the surface or in mid-water column habitats, while creek chubs form loose schools as juveniles and are solitary as adults. thus, even though these species are both insectivores, their life-history character- istics are quite different, and the factors that inﬂu- ence growth likely differ between species. the insec- tivore-piscivore guild was represented by green sun- ﬁsh lepomis cyanellus. green sunﬁsh are able to tolerate extremes in turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and ﬂow; consequently, green sunﬁsh are one of the most widely distributed species in the central united states (horkel and pearson 1976; carlander 1977; pﬂieger 1997). because these four species are common throughout much of the mid- west, the results from this study provide important life-history information (i.e., growth rates, lon- gevity, mortality rates) and insight into the factors that inﬂuence population dynamics of stream ﬁshes. we hypothesized that the abundance of conspeciﬁcs and closely related species (i.e., trophically similar species) would result in slow growth rates. we also hypothesized that growth rates would be related to habitat characteristics conducive to abundant prey production (i.e., periphyton, aquatic macroinverte- brates). speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that growth rates of central stonerollers would be highest at sites with rocky substrate, open canopies, and high phos- phorous concentrations and that growth of creek chubs, red shiners, and green sunﬁsh would be highest in areas with rocky substrate and abundant woody debris. study area streams were sampled on fort riley military res- ervation, located in the flint hills region of north- 89 quist & guy and stream characteristics, eastern kansas (riley and geary counties). a de- tailed review of the history, terrestrial plant com- munity, ﬁsh communities on fort riley are provided by quist (1999). the flint hills region is characterized by extensive limestone breaks and shallow soil (zimmerman 1985). due to the steep topography and rocky soils, row-crop agriculture is minimal; consequently, the flint hills contain the largest remnant of tallgrass prairie in north america (bragg and hulbert 1976; zimmerman 1985). streams in the flint hills region have relatively high gradients, with substrates dominated by lime- stone gravel and cobble, and support the most di- verse ﬁsh fauna in the kansas river basin (metcalf 1966). abundant ﬁshes in the study streams in- clude central stonerollers, creek chubs, red shiners, green sunﬁsh, common shiners luxilus cornutus, fathead minnows pimephales promelas, bluntnose minnows pimephales notatus, and orangethroat darters etheostoma spectabile (quist 1999). methods nineteen stream reaches were sampled from 13 dif- ferent streams during june and july, 1997 and 1998 (see quist 1999 for detailed descriptions). two sites were randomly selected from each reach to repre- sent the habitat characteristics of the reach. sites were generally 35 times the mean stream width (msw; lyons 1992; simonson et al. 1994), but never exceeded 300 m due to logistical constraints. water chemistry samples were collected from three equally spaced locations at each site. temperature ((cid:190) c) and conductivity (ms cm ` cm»1) were meas- ured with a hach co150 conductivity meter. dis- solved oxygen (mg ` l»1 as o2; hach hrdo method 8166), turbidity (formazin turbidity units [ftu]; hach absorptometric method 8237), and 3»; hach total phosphorous phosver 3 method 8048) were measured using a hach dr-el/2000 portable laboratory kit. boyd (1977, 1980) found that ﬁeld kits are adequate for measuring water quality. in addition, one hobo tempa temperature logger was placed at each site during the last week of may and was removed in august, 1997 and 1998. temperature loggers meas- ured temperature ((cid:190) c) at 3.25-h intervals. maxi- mum daily temperature, mean daily temperature, and maximum daily range in temperature between june 1 and august 17, 1997 and 1998, were deter- mined from each reach. (mg ` l»1 as po4 physical habitat and ﬁsh populations were sampled from each pool and rifﬂe macrohabitat independently. total length of each macrohabitat was measured. stream width (m), depth (m), cur- rent velocity (m ` s»1) and substrate particle size 90 were measured along transects following methods described by platts et al. (1983). substrate particle size was classiﬁed according to a modiﬁed wentworth scale (cummins 1962), except for the inclusion of a bedrock category and pooling of sand categories. the percentage canopy closure was measured with a spherical densiometer at four points along each transect (murphy et al. 1981). instream cover (i.e., aquatic vegetation, undercut bank, branch complex, bank root, log, log com- plex and rootwad; see quist 1999 for detailed de- scriptions) was deﬁned as any object ﬂ0.3 m long and in water ﬂ0.3 m deep. length (m), width (m) and depth (m) were measured from all cover types. additionally, total woody debris was deﬁned as the compilation of branch complex, bank root, log, log complex and root wad habitats. the amount of cover was quantiﬁed as m2 of a cover type per ha. scales from ten ﬁsh per centimeter length group were collected from central stonerollers, creek chubs, red shiners, and green sunﬁsh sampled from pool and rifﬂe macrohabitats (devries and frie 1996). although rifﬂe macrohabitats may be im- portant habitats for many stream ﬁshes, we found that catch rates were highest in pools, and over 85% of the individuals were sampled from pool macrohabitats (quist 1999). therefore, only data from pool macrohabitats were used in the analysis. scales were either pressed on acetate slides or mounted between glass slides and examined with a microﬁche reader. the fraser-lee method was used to determine mean back-calculated length at age for green sunﬁsh using a standard intercept value of 10 mm (carlander 1982). standard inter- central stonerollers, creek chubs, red shiners and green sunﬁsh were sampled by conducting one upstream electroﬁshing pass per macrohabitat using a smith-root model 15-c backpack elec- troﬁsher. electroﬁshing efforts were supplemented by conducting two seine hauls (bag seine; 7.6 m(cid:192)2.0 m with a 1.0 m(cid:192)1.0 m bag and 6.0 mm bar-measure mesh) in each macrohabitat. fifty ﬁsh of each species were measured to the nearest milli- meter (total length) and additional ﬁsh were counted. each ﬁsh species was categorized as a benthic-insectivore generalized-insectivore (gi), herbivore-detritivore (hd), insectivore-pisci- vore (ip) or omnivore (om), following schlosser (1982b), gorman (1988), and tripe and guy (1999). catch per unit effort (c/f) was used to index species and trophic guild abundance and was expressed as the number of ﬁsh per minute of elec- troﬁshing (ﬁsh/min). although seining was also used to collect ﬁsh, over 90% of the individuals used in this study were collected using electro- ﬁshing techniques. (bi), total annual mortality was determined using catch curves (ricker 1975). total annual mortality likely represents only natural mortality because central stonerollers, creek chubs and red shiners are nongame species and harvest of green sunﬁsh from fort riley streams is minimal (kyle hedges, fort riley military reservation, personal com- munication). we also estimated age-speciﬁc mor- tality rates (e.g., mortality between age 0 and age 1, mortality between age 1 and age 2) by determin- ing changes in the relative frequency of individuals within successive age groups (ricker 1975). emigration and immigration of ﬁshes are im- portant considerations when conducting stream re- search, especially with regard to studies investigat- ing the factors that inﬂuence growth rates. simi- larly, age-speciﬁc habitat use (e.g., pools, rifﬂes) may also affect the interpretation of growth and mortality estimates. although movement of short- lived stream ﬁshes is difﬁcult to quantify, it is un- likely that emigration and immigration substan- tially inﬂuenced our results because our experi- mental unit was a large stream reach (up to 10 km long). within each reach we sampled two sites and each site contained up to 20 individual pools. therefore, our estimates of growth and mortality represent a large spatial area within each reach. in addition, we did not ﬁnd any evidence of age-speci- ﬁc habitat use for any of the species examined. cept values have not been proposed for central stonerollers, creek chubs, or red shiners and the body-scale relationships were weak (i.e., r2,0.80); therefore, the direct proportion method was used to calculate mean back-calculated length at age. age structure of each species was estimated using age-length keys and assessed by determining the proportion of age classes within a sample (devries and frie 1996). linear regression analysis was used to determine the inﬂuence of ﬁsh community characteristics (e.g., c/f of cental stonerollers) and physicochem- ical habitat on growth increments. because older ﬁshes may not have lived in a stream reach for its entire life, we limited our analysis to the most cur- rent year of growth. for example, if age-3 green sunﬁsh were collected, the growth increment (i.e., growth increment 3) used in the analysis was de- ﬁned as the difference between mean back-calcu- lated lengths at age 2 and age 3. for this example, growth increment 1 (i.e., mean back-calculated length at age 1) and growth increment 2 (i.e., dif- ference between mean back-calculated lengths at age 1 and age 2) were not included in the analysis. relationships with pearson’s product-moment cor- relation coefﬁcients (r)ﬂ|0.60| and p-values ﬁ0.05 were retained for further analysis. stepwise- multiple regression was used to determine which growth and mortality of prairie ﬁshes of the remaining variables explained most of the variation in growth. the contribution of individual variables was tested using f-tests, and regression equations were limited to variables which contrib- uted signiﬁcantly (pﬁ0.05) to the model. models containing more than one independent variable were compared to reduced models by examining mallows’ cp statistic and reductions in the coef- ﬁcient of determination (r2, r2; mallows 1973; ott 1993). multicollinearity was analyzed by exam- ining tolerance values and variance inﬂation fac- tors as recommended by sokal & rohlf (1981). all statistical analyses were conducted using sas (1996). results central stonerollers and creek chubs were sampled from 95% of the reaches, while green sunﬁsh and red shiners were sampled from 84% and 37% of the reaches, respectively. central stonerollers were the most abundant of the four species examined in this study, followed by creek chubs, red shiners and green sunﬁsh (table 1). the herbivore-detritivore guild was the most abundant trophic guild; how- ever, central stonerollers were the only species re- presenting this guild. benthic-insectivores were rarely collected; whereas, generalized-insectivores and omnivores were common in our samples. the high variability in c/f of omnivores was due to lo- calized, but highly abundant, populations of bluntnose minnows pimephales notatus, common carp cyprinus carpio and bullheads ameiurus spp. physical and chemical habitat was highly vari- able among study reaches (table 2). mean dis- solved oxygen was never below 6.5 mg ` l»1, despite temperatures in excess of 25 (cid:190)c (table 2). mean total phosphorous concentration was generally be- low 0.50 mg ` l»1; however,

pebble. overall, aquatic vegetation was the most abundant form of instream cover. however, aquatic vegetation (lemnaceae and potamogeton spp.) was present at ,60% of the study reaches and, when present, covered .90% of the reach. woody debris was abundant in nearly all of the reaches and was dominated by log complex habi- tats. riparian vegetation, primarily oak quercus spp. and hackberry celtis occidentalis, was highly abundant at many sites and was positively corre- lated with the amount of bank roots (r‰0.57, p‰ 0.01), root wads (r‰0.48, p‰0.04) and total woody debris (r‰0.52, p‰0.02). age and growth analysis was conducted on ap- proximately 3300 individuals (table 3). mean back-calculated length at age varied among reaches, especially for the older ages (e.g., age-3 92 growth and mortality of prairie ﬁshes central stonerollers). the age structure of cyprinids was dominated by young individuals (table 3). however, the age structure of green sunﬁsh was more evenly distributed among age groups. the maximum age of green sunﬁsh was age 7. the mean total annual mortality was .60% for the cyprinids and 44% for green sunﬁsh (table 3). age-speciﬁc mortality rates

shiners, and green sunﬁsh. however, mortality rates were greater than 85% once individuals approached their maximum age. for example, the mortality rate of red shiners between age 0 and age 1 was less

chemical habitat did not appear to inﬂuence growth of the species examined in this study (p‰ 0.07–0.90). no signiﬁcant relationships (p.0.05) were found between growth increments of central stonerollers and physical habitat variables. total woody debris and pebble substrate explained 63% of the variation in the ﬁrst growth increment for creek chubs (fig. 2). total woody debris explained most of the variation (r2‰0.52) in the model. no signiﬁcant relationships were determined between habitat characteristics and growth increments 2 and 3 for creek chubs; however, growth increment 1 and 2 of red shiners was positively correlated with total woody debris (r.0.61, p‰0.04). vari- ation in growth of green sunﬁsh during the ﬁrst year was best explained by clay substrate and abundance of total woody debris (fig. 3). how- ever, total woody debris explained most of the variation (r2‰0.46) in the model. growth in- 93 quist & guy crement 3 was weakly related to the amount of log complex

studies have used incremental growth analysis to determine the age structure and growth rates of stream ﬁshes. furthermore, most studies have used length-frequency their analyses to age-0 and age-1 ﬁshes (e.g., lotrich 1973; schlosser 1982a, 1982b, 1985; bayley 1988). lennon and parker (1960) used scales to age cen- tral stonerollers in several tennessee and north carolina streams. although the authors used scales to determine age, they did not estimate mean back-calculated length at age. similar to our study, gunning & lewis (1956) used incremental growth analysis central stonerollers were 51 mm, 79 mm, and 99 mm at age 1, 2, and 3 in an illinois stream, respectively. we hypothesized that a high abundance of rocky substrate (possible attachment sites for algae), low canopy cover (exposure to sunlight) and high phos- phorous concentrations (an index to productivity) would enhance growth rates; however, habitat characteristics were not correlated with growth of central stonerollers. the inability to develop a sig- niﬁcant model for central stonerollers does not im- ply that their growth was beyond the inﬂuence of biotic or environmental factors. rather, it is poss- ible that growth was related to factors not meas- ured in this study or that the variability in ﬁsh community and habitat characteristics inhibited model development. mean back-calculated length of creek chubs from fort riley were within 20 mm of lengths re- ported for illinois (gunning & lewis 1956) and iowa streams (dinsmore 1962). gunning & lewis (1956) and dinsmore (1962) did not estimate mor- tality rates but reported that the age structure was dominated by young individuals (i.e., less than age 2). similar to fort riley streams, schlosser (1998) found that mortality averaged over 80% between age 0 and age 1 for creek chubs in a minnesota stream. growth of creek chubs during the ﬁrst year was related to the amount of total woody debris. nu- merous studies have demonstrated the importance of woody debris for invertebrate production (e.g., benke et al. 1984). instream woody debris is an important component of nutrient processing in stream ecosystems because it enhances retention of organic matter and inorganic sediments by form- ing debris dams (speaker et al. 1984). debris dams 94 become important nutrient sources and provide substrate for aquatic invertebrates, forming an im- portant component of lotic food webs (triska et al. 1983; benke et al. 1984) and are especially im- portant in habitats with unstable or unproductive substrate (e.g., silt, sand; nilsen and larimore 1973; angermeier and karr 1984; benke et al. 1984). creek chubs are particularly dependent on aquatic macroinvertebrates during their early life history (dinsmore 1962; mcmahon 1982; schloss- er and angermeier 1990). although creek chubs were deﬁned as insectivores for this study, older creek chubs are largely opportunistic foragers and exhibit diverse diets consisting of plant material, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and ﬁshes (dinsmore 1962). the mechanism underlying the observed trends is unknown. however, the re- lationship of growth increment 1 with woody debris and pebble substrate, and lack of signiﬁcant relationships for older ages, likely reﬂects an onto- genetic shift in diet from aquatic insects to a diver- siﬁed diet not dependent on instream production (e.g., terrestrial insects). mortality of red shiners between age 0 and age 1 was lower (,20%) than the other species, indicating that most red shiners survive their ﬁrst year of life but then disappear from the community thereafter. thus, high variability in recruitment can substan- tially inﬂuence the community structure and associ- ated indices (e.g., species diversity, evenness) from year to year. the amount of woody debris inﬂu- enced growth increments at all ages for red shiners. red shiners are highly dependent on aquatic macro- invertebrates throughout life (pﬂieger 1997). thus, woody debris may enhance growth through in- creased aquatic invertebrate production. information on the growth of green sunﬁsh is abundant for midwestern lakes, reservoirs, and streams (carlander 1977). however, this is the ﬁrst study to report age structure, growth, and mor- tality of green sunﬁsh in northeast kansas streams. on fort riley, green sunﬁsh were the longest-lived species and experienced the lowest total annual mortality rate. in general, green sunﬁsh growth is faster in lentic environments compared to lotic en- vironments (carlander 1977). green sunﬁsh from fort riley grew at rates similar to studies reported in carlander (1977) and were most similar to mis- souri streams. cross et al. (1959) reported mean back-calculated lengths at age for green sunﬁsh from farlington lake, kansas, where mean back- calculated lengths were 20 mm to 40 mm greater at each age than green sunﬁsh from fort riley. moreover, cross et al. (1959) used the direct pro- portion method, which tends to underestimate lengths when compared to methods used in this study. similar to creek chubs and red shiners, growth of green sunﬁsh was related to the abundance of woody debris. green sunﬁsh are insectivores dur- ing their early life history and then switch to a pis- cine diet (pﬂieger 1997). thus, woody debris may provide beneﬁts to green sunﬁsh in different ways during ontogeny. for example, woody debris may function as a source of invertebrate prey during early ontogeny and as structure (e.g., ambush areas) for adults. tillma et al. (1998) found that the area of root wad and undercut bank habitat explained over 60% of the variation in the relative abundance and biomass of spotted bass m. punctu- latus in kansas streams. the authors suggested that woody debris was important because it often formed the only source of structural diversity in their study streams. therefore, it is possible that woody debris concentrates prey ﬁsh and serves as cover (e.g., ambush areas) for stream piscivores. it is apparent from this study that woody debris is an important habitat inﬂuencing growth of small stream ﬁshes in prairie ecosystems. although the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying these relationships are unknown (e.g., invertebrate production, ambush areas), these data provide a framework for further observational and experi- mental research on the mechanistic processes in- ﬂuencing population dynamics of stream ﬁshes. the results of this study suggest that approaches traditionally used in lake and reservoir systems can provide information regarding the population dynamic rate functions (e.g., growth, mortality) of stream ﬁshes. furthermore, the re- sults of this study provide information that is fun- damentally important conserving prairie stream ﬁshes and their habitats. although these methods are more labor intensive than many other techniques (e.g., analysis of length-frequency dis- tributions), they provide detailed information on the factors that inﬂuence ﬁsh populations and ulti- mately ﬁsh community structure and function. component important for resumen 1. el ﬁn de este estudio fue determinar la estructura de edades, y las tasas de crecimiento y mortalidad (mortalidad anual total y mortalidad especı´ﬁca de la edad) en campostoma anomalum, semotilus atromaculatus, cyprinella lutrensis y lepomis cyan- ellus en 13 rı´os de la reserva militar de fort riley (kansas, usa). pusimos especial intere´s en determinar la inﬂuencia de la comunidad de peces y de las caracterı´sticas del habitat sobre las tasas de crecimiento. 2. la estructura de edad en c. anomalum, s. atromaculatus y cy. lutrensis estuvieron dominadas por individuos jo´venes ((cid:176)2 an˜os); sin embargo, mas del 60% l. cyanellus tuvieron entre 2 y 4 an˜os. la mortalidad total anual media fue –60% para los ciprı´nidos y 44% de promedio para l. cyanellus. en general, la mortalidad especı´ﬁca de la edad en c. anomalum y cy. lutrensis fue menor del 45% entre la edad 0 y 1, e incremento´ al 85% en los individuos mayores de 1 an˜o. growth and mortality of prairie ﬁshes 3. las caracterı´sticas de la comunidad de peces (e.g. capturas por unidad de esfuerzo de grupos tro´ﬁcos) y el habitat quı´mico (e.g. fo´sforo total) no parecieron estar relacionados las tasas de crecimiento (p–0.05). el crecimiento de c. anomalum tampoco parecio´ estar relacionado con el habitat fı´sico. sin embargo, incrementos en el crecimiento de s. atromaculatus, cy. lutrensis y l. cyanellus estuvieron relacionados con la cantidad de ‘‘de- bris’’ (e.g. log complejidad de habitat; r–0.60, pﬁ0.05). acknowledgments we thank j. delp, t. elbel, t. hungerford, g. norris and l. quist
