the accuracy of each is likely dependent on the nature of the environmental gradients, species responses to those gradients and the spatial extent of the modelling. thus, it is important to compare multiple approaches across species and habitats to identify the most effective modelling approach. using geographical information system (gis) derived characteristics of stream segments as predictors, we tested the model performance of three methodologies – linear discriminant function analysis, classiﬁcation trees and artiﬁcial neural networks (ann) – for predicting the occurrence of 38 ﬁsh species in a great plains river basin. results showed that all approaches predicted species occurrences with relatively high success. ann generally were the best models, in that they generated the most signiﬁcant models (35 of 38 species) and most accurately predicted species presence for the greatest number of species (average correct classiﬁcation ¼ 81.1%). the importance of gis variables for predicting stream ﬁsh occurrences varied among species and modelling techniques, but were generally strong predictors of species distributions, including the federally endangered topeka shiner notropis topeka. in summary, predictive models should be viewed as both competitive and complementary methodologies for establishing quantitative linkages between ﬁsh species and their environment. our study demonstrates the potential utility of such an approach for guiding conservation efforts for stream ﬁshes of the great plains, usa. r. m. oakes1,2, k. b. gido1, j. a. falke1,3, j. d. olden4,5, b. l. brock6 1division of biology, kansas state university, manhattan, ks, 2university of pennsylvania law school, philadelphia, pa, 3department of fishery and wildlife biology, colorado state university, fort collins, co, 4graduate degree program in ecology, colorado state university, fort collins, co, 5center for limnology, university of wis- consin, madison, wi, 6wildlife conservation society, bozeman, mt, usa key words: predictive modelling, great plains, geographical information system, artiﬁcial neural networks, classiﬁcation trees, linear discriminant function analysis keith b. gido, division of biology, kansas state university, manhattan, ks 66506, usa;

dodds et al. 2004) and great plains streams are home to a number of threatened or endangered ﬁshes (e.g., notropis topeka; haslouer et al. 2005). modelling freshwater ﬁsh distributions in the great plains is particularly important for the management of this highly imperiled fauna because little information is known about the ecology of many of these ﬁshes (matthews 1988; fausch & bestgen 1997). fishes in this region are tolerant of harsh natural conditions, in hydrological regime (matthews et al. 1988; fausch & bramblett 1991; labbe & fausch 2000), and ﬂuctuating temperatures (matthews 1987; smale & rabeni 1995). despite their tolerance, great plains ﬁshes have been negatively impacted by human-induced changes in land use (berkman & rabeni 1987; schlosser 1991), hydrology (eschner et al. 1983; cross et al. 1985; winston et al. 1991) and the spread of non-native species (cross & moss 1987; gido et al. 2004), which have collectively resulted in extirpations and drastic declines in a number of native species. the particularly vulnerable status of great plains ﬁshes necessitates a predictive understanding of species–habitat relationships to aid the development of conservation plans aimed at preserving the biological the region. including drastic changes and hypoxia integrity of 362 ideally, these models will predict the occurrence of species of concern and areas of high indigenous species richness (wall et al. 2004). this study assesses the ability to develop accurate predictive models for ﬁshes in these dynamic river systems, which to our knowledge, is previously untested. herein, we develop predictive models for ﬁshes in the big blue river basin in north-eastern kansas, with the primary goal of providing a management tool to aid in the conservation of ﬁshes in the region. this river system supports a ﬁsh fauna that is in critical need of conservation. a comparison of recent surveys of the basin with those conducted in the 1950s suggests that several species have been extirpated (e.g., hybognathus argrytus) or have declined in their range (e.g., notropis topeka; shrank et al. 2001; gido et al. 2002). these same studies also document the recent introduction of several nonindigenous species; some within the past 3 years (gido et al. 2002). land- use and impoundments (i.e., tuttle creek reservoir) have impaired the basin (falke & gido in press). in short, the big blue river basin typiﬁes many problems that are characteristic of great plains ecosystems, and is an appropriate system on which to study the utility of predictive modelling as a conservation tool. conversion, hydrological modiﬁcations although there are many different statistical approaches to model ecological data, studies that have directly compared the effectiveness of the different techniques are scarce (guisan & zimmermann 2000). studies that have made direct comparisons across modelling approaches (e.g., mastrorillo et al. 1997; manel et al. 1999; olden & jackson 2002) have reported signiﬁcant differences across both statistical techniques and individual taxa. recent studies have highlighted the utility of nonlinear statistical techniques such as classiﬁcation trees (ct) (e.g., magnuson et al. 1998; rathert et al. 1999; rejwan et al. 1999) and artiﬁcial neural networks (ann) (e.g., mastrorillo et al. 1997; brosse & lek 1999; olden & jackson 2001) in modelling the distributions of freshwater ﬁshes. the advancement of nonlinear statistical approaches not only provides researchers with additional tools with which to model complex ecological relationships, but also presents the problem of choosing the approach that most accurately represents a species–habitat relation- ship. to address this question, we compared three modelling techniques to assess their performance in modelling the occurrence of great plains ﬁshes. methods study area the big blue river and its tributaries drain approxi- mately 24,900 km2 in north-eastern kansas and w n s e 0 10 20 40 kilometres fig. 1. map of the big blue river basin, located in south-eastern nebraska and north-eastern kansas, usa. fish sampling locations are represented by circles (kdwp sites), squares (gido et al. 2002) and triangles (minckley 1959). south-eastern nebraska (fig. 1). the physical habitats of these streams were inﬂuenced by past glaciation events, and are broadly classiﬁed into three types: sand-bottomed, mud-bottomed and gravel-bottomed streams (minckley 1959). tuttle creek dam impoun- ded the big blue river in 1962, and formed a large (50 km2) located approximately 15 km upstream from the conﬂuence of the big blue river and the kansas river. land cover in the drainage was historically tall and mixed-grass prairie, but is now predominantly row-crop agriculture and pasture. reservoir fish data predictive models were based on 120 ﬁsh collections, from which 50 species were captured. the frequency of occurrence of each species in these collections is presented in table 1. included in these collections were three species that have been identiﬁed as being of special conservation concern: hybognathus argrytus, notropis topeka and phoxinus erythrogaster (haslouer et al. 2005). fifty-six sites were sampled between march 1957 and august 1958 (minckley 1959), prior to the construction of tuttle creek dam using a combination of entrapment devices (hoop and fyke nets), observations by anglers, gill nets, rotenone, electroﬁshing and predominately seining. the kansas department of wildlife and parks (kdwp) sampled 49 sites in the basin between september 1995 and august 2000. kdwp sampling followed the protocol of meador et al. (1993); at each site a reach that was 40 times the average wetted width of the stream (minimum 150 m, maximum 300 m) was sampled using a com- bination of straight and bag seines (4.7-mm mesh) and dc-pulsed backpack electroﬁshing. finally, gido et al. (2002) sampled 15 sites in the big blue river basin in modelling great plains ﬁshes autumn 2001, using 4.6 m · 1.2 m (3.2-mm mesh) or 6.1 m · 1.8 m (4.8-mm mesh) straight seines, and backpack electroﬁshing (dc-pulsed). all major habi- tats within a stream reach of 100–300 m were sampled, and sampling was ended after two or three seine hauls yielded no new species. to increase the spatial coverage of the sampling sites, we used ﬁsh species records collected in the big blue river basin over approximately 50 years. although changes in species abundance in the big blue river and its tributaries were documented over this time span (gido et al. 2002), species occurrences within great plains river basins have tended to be more stable (gido et al. 2004). thus, we assumed that by measuring current habitat conditions, we could capture species–habitat associations based on pres- ence/absence data from historic collections. environmental variables predictive modelling was conducted at the scale of stream segments. a stream segment was deﬁned as a length of stream from its upstream conﬂuence to its downstream conﬂuence with other tributaries (mean length ¼ 1.6 km). while the segment scale may not encompass all habitats used by freshwater ﬁshes throughout their life stages (schlosser & angermeier 1995; fausch et al. 2002), stream ﬁshes typically move relatively little during most life stages (skalski & gilliam 2000) and thus should respond to factors operating at the scale of stream segments used in this study. twenty-ﬁve landscape-scale habitat variables were quantiﬁed for each segment and used to model ﬁsh distributions (table 2). these habitat variables were chosen to represent factors that have been linked to ﬁsh assemblage structure, including stream size and position in the watershed (sheldon 1968; osborne & wiley 1992; zorn et al. 2002), surface geology (matthews & robison 1988; nelson et al. 1992; mandrak 1995), and land use within the catchment (roth et al. 1996; wang et al. 1997). associations among variables were evaluated prior to modelling. as this was partly an exploratory analysis, only highly correlated (i.e., r > 0.85) variables were excluded from the data set, and the same variables were used in all three modelling approaches to ensure accurate comparisons across approaches. environmental variables were classiﬁed at the stream segment scale for use in modelling with arcgis software and methods described in arc- hydro: geographical information system (gis) for water resources (maidment 2002). measures of stream size and positioning were calculated from a modiﬁed version of the national hydrography dataset (usgs 1997), soil measurements were obtained from the statsgo database (nrcs 1994), and catchment 363

included general land cover types that were less prone to misclassiﬁcation than other land cover data sets available for the basin. statistical analyses we compared the effectiveness of linear discriminant function analysis (dfa), ct and ann for predicting the occurrence of 38 different ﬁsh species that occurred in greater than 5% of the collections (i.e., in three or more of the 120

species as absent when it was observed at a site (i.e., the complement to model sensitivity or false negative), commission error referred to the misclassiﬁcation of a species as present when it was not observed at a site (i.e., to model speciﬁcity or false positive) and total error referred to the total misclas- siﬁcation rate of a species across all sites. all error rates were expressed as percentages. for all model predictions an a priori decision threshold of 0.5 was used to classify a species as present or absent. the complement (i.e., presence linear discriminant function analysis discriminant functions were based on linear combi- nations of predictor variables that maximise the separation between groups and absence). dfa is expected to perform similarly to logistic regression when parametric assumptions are met (efron 1975) and therefore was representative of traditional, parametric approaches in general. dfa has been used in ecological studies of ﬁshes (e.g., joy & death 2002), but is constrained by the assumptions of linear relationships among variables (e.g., olden & jackson 2002). all models were generated using spss, version 11.0. within-groups covariance matrix was used and prior probabilities were computed from group sizes (i.e., species prevalence). the importance of independent variables in the dfa models were expressed on a scale of negative one to one using standardised discriminant function coefﬁcients. classiﬁcation trees classiﬁcation trees are a powerful nonparametric approach (breiman et al. 1984) for modelling ecolog- ical data (de’ath & fabricius 2000). classiﬁcation trees were constructed using a recursive partitioning algo- rithm that repeatedly splits the data set into two mutually exclusive groups; where each split sought to minimise the misclassiﬁcation rate and create groups that were as homogeneous as possible with respect to the response variable (i.e., species presence/absence). splitting continued with each new group until no new split yielded a signiﬁcant decrease in misclassiﬁcation rate, or the group contained a small number of observations (n ¼ 10). prior probabilities were esti- mated, and goodness-of-ﬁt was calculated using the gini index, the measure of goodness-of-ﬁt favoured by the developers of ct (breiman et al. 1984). the importance of each habitat variable in the ct models for each ﬁsh species was estimated by summing the 365 oakes et al. changes in misclassiﬁcation for each split across all groups, and was expressed on a scale from 0 to 100, with high values indicating greater importance in the model (breiman et al. 1984). classiﬁcation trees were generated using matlab, version 6.0 (novi, mi, usa). artiﬁcial neural networks artiﬁcial neural networks have shown great promise for modelling nonlinear ecological data and develop- ing prediction or classiﬁcation rules for many taxa (lek & gue´gan 2000), including ﬁsh species distri- butions (e.g., olden & jackson 2001). in this study we used one-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks trained by the backpropagation algorithm (bishop 1995). the architecture of this network consists of a single input, hidden and output layer, with each layer containing one or more neurones. the input layer contains p neurones, each of which represents one of the 25 environmental variables. the number of hidden neurones in the neural network varies and was chosen to minimise the trade-off between network bias and variance by comparing the performances of different cross-validated networks, with one to 25 hidden neurones and choosing the number that produced the greatest network performance. the output layer contains a single neurone representing the predicted probability of species presence. additional bias neurones with a constant output (equal to one) are added to the hidden and output layers. learning rate (g) and momentum (a) parameters (varying as a function of network error) were included during network training to ensure a high probability of global network convergence and a maximum of 1000 itera- tions for the backpropagation algorithm to determine the optimal axon weights. prior to training the network, the independent variables were converted to z-scores to standardise the measurement scales of the inputs into the network, and thereby ensure that same percentage change in the weighted sum of the inputs caused a similar percentage change in the unit output. the explanatory importance of the environmental variables for predicting ﬁsh species occurrence was quantiﬁed by calculating the product of the hidden-input and hidden-output connection weights between each input neurone and output neurone and then summing the products across all hidden neurones. this procedure was repeated for each environmental variable and the relative contributions of the variables were calculated by dividing the absolute value of each variable contri- bution by the grand mean (sum of all absolute variable contributions). the relative contributions of each envi- ronmental variable were subsequently assessed for their statistical signiﬁcance using a randomisation test (see olden et al. 2004 for more details). all ann were conducted using computer macros written in the matlab programming language, version 6.0. 366 model validation species models were evaluated using a cross- validation procedure, in which one site was excluded, a model was constructed using n-1 sites, and the excluded site was predicted using this model. this procedure was repeated n times. cohen’s j statistic (titus et al. 1984) was used to assess whether the association between predicted and observed preval- ence differed from expectations based on chance alone (olden et al. 2002), because this method is relatively independent of species prevalence (manel et al. 2001). model comparisons and variable importance we compared the three modelling techniques with wilcoxon signed ranks tests that examined differ- ences in total, omission and commission error rates among modelling approaches. a bonferonni corrected alpha was used to account for multiple comparisons. to examine the relative contribution of environmental variables to species predictions gener- ated from the three modelling approaches, we ranked the variables from 25 to 1 (25 ¼ most important variable, 1 ¼ least important). mean ranks across species models were calculated to identify the environmental strong and consistent relationships with ﬁsh species occur- rence. spearman rank-correlation coefﬁcients were calculated to examine concordance of variable importance across individual modelling techniques for all species. exhibited variables that results comparisons of modelling approaches inﬂuenced by patterns of thirty-eight species occurred in three or more collec- tions and were modelled using the different approa- ches. cohen’s j statistic indicated that the ann, dfa and ct approaches produced 35, 29 and 24 species models, respectively, which were signiﬁcantly better than those expected by chance. predictability of species presence or absence varied greatly, and as expected was species prevalence (fig. 2). widely and narrowly distributed species typically had low total error rates, whereas species with intermediate prevalence across sites ranged widely in total error rates. mean total error rates across the 38 species models ranged from 19.9% for ann models, 21.4% for ct models and 23.9% for dfa models. differences in omission and commission error rates across the approaches were much greater but strongly correlated with species prevalence; omission error rates increased and com- mission error rates decreased with declining species prevalence. all were ) % ( e t a r r o

analysis of error rates among the families of species modelled revealed no clear trends in species predict- ability related to phylogeny. however, some species models performed better than others with respect to prevalence, across the three modelling approaches. models generated for species with strict habitat requirements tended to perform better (e.g., had lower error rates than expected based on their prevalence) across all three modelling techniques. examples of such species include carpiodes carpio, ictalurus punctatus and semotilus atromaculatus, which were present in approximately 50% of the collection records and had average correct classiﬁcation rates of 80%, 78% and 75%, respectively, across modelling approa- ches. conversely, generalist species such as lepomis humilus and lepomis macrochirus were observed in similar percentages of collection records, but gener- ated less predictable models (average correct classiﬁ- cation across modelling approaches equalled 60% for both species). mean cohen’s j statistic values also modelling great plains ﬁshes tended to be higher in models developed for the three species with strict habitat requirements than those developed for the two generalist species. total error rates for the three species of special conservation concern in the basin were low across modelling approaches (4–8% for h. argrytus, 7–15% for n. topeka, 10–13% for p. erythrogaster; table 1). however, omission error rates tended to be high in models generated for n. topeka and p. erythrogaster, indicating that the models were under-predicting the occurrence of these species. cohen’s j statistic values for models developed for these species were generally high (mean j across models 0.42 for h. argrytus, 0.32 topeka, 0.29 for p. erythrogaster) across for n. modelling approaches, with the exception of the dfa model developed for n. topeka, which did not signiﬁcantly differ from results expected by chance. across all species, ann generally produced the greatest number of models (35 of 38 species) whose results were signiﬁcantly better than those expected by chance and had the lowest error rates, although the magnitude of differences among approaches was often small. wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed that total error rates generated by ann and ct models were signiﬁcantly (bonferroni corrected p < 0.05) lower that those generated by dfa models (table 3). commission error rates were lowest for ann, inter- mediate for ct and highest for dfa models. omission error rates generated by ann models were signiﬁ- cantly lower than those generated by dfa models, but not different from ct models. ann models most often generated the lowest error rates for a given species, with the lowest total error rate for 14 of the 38 species, the lowest omission error for 18 of 38 species, and the lowest commission error for 19 of 38 species (table 1). the ann approach also generated the most accurate models for two (h. argrytus and p. erythro- gaster) of the three species of special conservation concern in the basin. in particular, the ann approach was able to predict the distribution of h. argrytus with a high degree of accuracy (96% species occurrence,

across the three approaches, measures of stream size and position in the watershed (drainage, link, dlink) and variables reﬂective of the underlying geology of the basin (kfact, perm) were generally ranked highest across the 38 species models (fig. 3). however, mean ranked importance of environmental variables in the models ranged between 6.8 and 21.9, and 24 of the 25 variables were ranked as the most important in at least one model. thus, most variables were important in some species models, and no variable was important in all species models. moreover, weak associations in variable importance among methods showed that variable approaches (table 4). contributions differed among modelling discussion artiﬁcial neural networks, classiﬁcation trees and linear dfa successfully predicted the presence and absence of the majority of ﬁsh species. the high correlation between prevalence and classiﬁcation success across species and modelling approaches has been previously reported and is partly attributed to insufﬁcient data points available to accurately classify habitats in which species are either present or absent (scott et al. 2002), and the increased probability of correctly predicting the occurrence of rare and very abundant species (olden et al. 2002). from a conservation standpoint, models drainage link dlink strahler downorde dist_res permh omh slopeh

as ct models did not generate variable importance metrics for species where no variable induced a split in the classiﬁcation tree, no comparison was made for some species, designated na. values in bold indicate signiﬁcant correlations (p < 0.05). that produce low omission error are of the most interest, because they can be used to identify areas of suitable habitat for rare species across the land- scape. moreover, species presence data is considerably less biased compared with species absence data that can arise solely from the failure to detect a species at a particular site (scott et al. 2002). however, models that over-predict occurrences (i.e., high commission error) may not be biologically meaningful. thus, models with the greatest utility for conservation are those that are ecologically interpretable and predict occurrences of rare species while minimising commis- sion error. although the magnitude of differences was often small, ann models generated the lowest omission error rates. these ﬁndings correspond to those of olden & jackson (2002), who compared the predictability of four modelling approaches (the same approaches examined here in addition to logistic regression analysis) in 286 temperate lakes in south-central ontario, canada. like this study, olden & jackson (2002) found the overall in predicting ﬁsh distributions 369 oakes et al. predictive performance of four modelling approaches was similar across species, but that the ann modelling approach generated the greatest number of signiﬁcant models and lower omission error rates than the other approaches. given the disparity in environmental gradients between prairie streams and temperate lakes, this suggests ann models may generally outperform other modelling approaches across a wide range of environmental gradients. despite the dynamic abiotic characteristics of prairie streams (dodds et al. 2004) and the prevalence of generalist species (fausch & bestgen 1997), we were able to generate signiﬁcant models for the majority of species at the scale of stream segments. while our approach was similar to that of olden & jackson (2002), we expected to observe weaker species–habitat associations because of the inherent differences between hierarchically distributed river basin networks (frissell et al. 1986) and spatially isolated lake systems. our results were comparable with those presented by olden & jackson (2002), but as expected, our observed error rates for prairie stream ﬁshes were higher than for lake species (notably, species prevalence was similar in the two data sets). for example, using ann models the mean total error rate across 29 lake species was 15.8%, versus a mean total error rate of 19.9% across the prairie stream species analysed in this study. there also was a greater discrepancy in omission error rates, which averaged 29.2% across lake species versus 44.6% across prairie stream ﬁshes. our results suggest that species predictability is associated with the autecology of the species being modelled. lotic species with strict habitat require- ments should more strongly respond to the environ- mental gradients regulating the distribution of ﬁshes within river basin networks than more wide-ranging species, and consequently may be more likely to co-vary with environmental variables used in predic- tive modelling. for example, of the three species highlighted in fig. 2, both c. carpio and i. punctatus are large-river species that were only collected in main stem rivers of the big blue river basin. the third species, creek chub (s. atromaculatus), as its name implies, typically occur in tributaries, and are rarely found in large rivers (cross & collins 1995). these species may be classiﬁed as ecological specialists in that they respond to a gradient of stream size across two lepomis species the river basin. in contrast, (l. humilis and l. macrochirus) occurred in approxi- mately the same number of collections, but their models had much greater total error rates. these species are considered to be ecological generalists that tolerate wide-ranging conditions and are present in numerous habitat types (cross & collins 1995). consequently, they may be more difﬁcult to model 370 than species with strict habitat requirements that can be explained with only one or a few environmental variables (porter et al. 2000). the presence of n. model results were mixed for the species of special conservation concern. the presence of h. argrytus was most accurately predicted using the ann topeka was most approach, accurately predicted using the ct approach, and the presence of p. erythrogaster was most accurately predicted by the dfa approach. moreover, the presence of h. argrytus was successfully predicted >83% of the time using ann, but ann models were only successful at predicting the occurrence of n. topeka and p. erythrogaster 62% and 50% of the time, respectively. these results illustrate that the predict- ability of rare species is highly variable and should be interpreted with caution; a ﬁnding that is supported by the varying success of recent modelling efforts that used the approaches compared in this study (ann: mastrorillo et al. 1997; ct: rejwan et al. 1999; dfa: scheller et al. 1999). rare species with strict habitat requirements are often among the ﬁrst species to be adversely impacted by anthropogenic changes (allan & flecker 1993). whereas a species with speciﬁc habitat requirements should be more easily modelled, the lack of data points available for threatened or endangered species limits the usefulness of these modelling techniques for rare species (scott et al. 2002). in this study, h. argrytus, n. topeka and p. erythrogaster occurred in only 5%, 7% and 8%, respectively, of the 120 collection records used in modelling; additional sampling records of n. topeka and p. erythrogaster likely would have allowed more accurate predictions to be developed for these species. in light of such data limitations, conducting additional surveys prior to beginning modelling efforts may improve predictive accuracy for rare species. given the often endemic nature of rare species, undertaking a more hierarchical approach to modelling ﬁsh species distributions also may assist in predicting the occur- rence of rare ﬁshes (quist et al. 2005). furthermore, the development of ecologically relevant predictive models that maximise the correct classiﬁcation of species presence (i.e., minimise omission error), albeit at the expense of increased commission error, will be an important development rare species. this can be accomplished by incorporating misclassiﬁcation costs into the modelling process. studies typically apply equal costs to omission and commission error; however, in practice it may be advantageous to assign more appropriate costs to the misclassiﬁcations if such information is available. for example, more false presences for a rare species may be tolerated to minimise the risk of failing to protect that species; thus greater costs could be assigned to omission errors during the modelling process. for modelling of all independent variables used in this study were gis-derived landscape variables quantiﬁed at the stream segment scale. such variables may either be directly responsible for shaping ﬁsh assemblage structure (e.g., nelson et al. 1992; osborne & wiley 1992; mandrak 1995), or may simply be correlated with other habitat features at ﬁner spatial scales that are known to inﬂuence ﬁsh distribution and abun- dance. for example, zorn et al. (2002) accurately predicted species distributions in michigan based on soil permeability, slope and drainage area above collection sites, which strongly correlated with hydrol- ogy and water temperature. the ability of landscape variables to successfully predict ﬁsh distributions provides a useful in instances where limited resources do not allow sufﬁcient ﬁner-scale data to be collected. however, researchers must be aware that these variables may be surrogates for the actual factors driving species distributional patterns. nevertheless, our results demonstrated that signiﬁcant models could be produced for many ﬁsh species across wide ranges of prevalence and habitat preferences using only gis- derived habitat variables as predictors. tool several highly ranked variables were reﬂective of either stream size or position in the watershed, or the underlying geology of the basin. these results agree with previous studies (minckley 1959; gido et al. 2002; falke & gido in press) in the big blue river basin, which linked ﬁsh assemblage structure primar- ily to stream size, location and substrate type. interestingly, all segment measurements of geological variables had low mean rankings. whereas segment- measured variables were, to some extent, associated with watershed-level geological variables, the consis- tent selection of these watershed-level variables high- light the potential utility of large-scale proxies in modelling ﬁsh distributions. such an approach repre- sents the hierarchical manner by which basin geology impacts ﬁsh distributions at smaller spatial scales (fausch et al. 2002). as noted earlier, the big blue river basin was inﬂuenced by glaciations, resulting in distinct geology among watersheds, which proved in this study to be key predictors for many species in the basin. additional studies in areas with less topo- graphic relief and habitat heterogeneity are needed to assess the ability of these modelling techniques to predict ﬁshes in other prairie environments. mean rankings of predictor variables suggest some variables were more frequently important across all models, but it appears that almost all variables (24 of 25 in individual species models) were important in at least one species model. like olden & jackson (2002), we found a lack of concordance in variable importance among the different approaches, which indicated different combinations of variables were being chosen to predict species occurrence, despite the modelling great plains ﬁshes that modelling techniques were generating fact roughly equivalent error rates. some variance in variable importance was probably because of moderate levels of correlation among variables, as only highly correlated environmental variables were removed from the analysis. overall, it is difﬁcult to generalise the importance of individual variables because multiple variable interactions were implicitly accounted for in the ann and ct models (multiple variable interac- tions were not taken into account in dfa modelling). when modelling large numbers of species, it also was important including enough variables to represent all species responses to environmental gradients, but not so many that the these variables becomes biological unclear. in instances where speciﬁc species are modelled as part of the development of conservation strategies, a more rigorous screening of variables may be appropriate and a consensus of results from multiple models should be used. the trade-off of relevance of to consider the development of signiﬁcant predictive models for most species using only gis-derived habitat variables is promising, because of the aforementioned time and monetary advantages of these data, and, as was the case in this study, ﬁner-scale data are often not available. researchers (smith & powell 1971; tonn 1990; quist et al. 2005) have hypothesised that environmental ﬁlters operate at successive scales, whereby large-scale variables exert an initial inﬂu- ence on aquatic biota, and ﬁner-scale variables have a modifying inﬂuence that determine presence– absence at a speciﬁc locality. this suggests the inclusion of ﬁeld data or other ﬁner-scale measure- ments would have increased our predictive ability. although in some cases the inclusion of ﬁeld- measured variables generates only marginal improve- ments in classiﬁcation success (e.g., porter et al. 2000), a combination of landscape and local habitat variables may likely generate the most accurate species models, and ﬁner-scale data should be included if available. conclusion for regional managers this study has demonstrated the relatively high predictability of great plains ﬁsh species occurrence, and highlights the utility of ann over other com- monly used modelling approaches. this is encour- aging for conserving prairie stream ﬁshes that have suffered major declines in abundance and overall range. although we were less successful in predicting species occurrences than results that have been reported for other systems (e.g., temperate lakes), our models did predict the occurrence of at least two species of special conservation concern in the region (h. argrytus and responsible 371 oakes et al. conservation plans n. topeka) with a relatively high degree of accuracy (>60% occurrences correctly predicted). developing meaningful species requires knowledge of both the organism and the environmental features that shape its distribution. in instances where these data are not available, measures such as collecting additional data may be required to generate accurate models for rare species. for rare future advances in the prediction of stream ﬁshes will likely come from a greater understanding of the processes and scales that regulate ﬁsh distributions across the landscape, as well as improvements in the ability of statistical techniques to elucidate these relationships. in particular, a better understanding of spatial and temporal variation in species distributions are needed, as well as an understanding of how the importance of environmental gradients that regulate distributions vary with respect to scale (angermeier et al. 2002). resumen 1. predecir la distribucio´n de las especies tiene importantes implicaciones para la conservacio´n y gestio´n de los peces de agua dulce, particularmente en regiones tales como el great plains de los estados unidos, donde los impactos humanos han resultado en el declive o en la extirpacio´ n de numerosas especies nativas. 2. hay varias aproximaciones estadı´sticas para construir modelos de distribucio´n;
