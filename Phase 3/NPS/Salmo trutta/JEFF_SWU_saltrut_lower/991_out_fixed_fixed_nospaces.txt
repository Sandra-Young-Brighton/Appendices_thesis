(1977); bregazzi & kennedy (1980) and cook & bergersen (1988). however, on the contrary, other authors have observed restricted home range among pike (malinin 1970; grimm & klinge 1996; eklo¨v 1997). migration of ﬁsh has often been regarded as an adaptive behaviour for increasing growth, survival, reproductive success, and hence overall ﬁtness (e.g., harden jones 1968; northcote 1978; gross 1987). migration is often deﬁned according to northcote (1978). homing orientation of ﬁsh to the natal site implies imprinting at the early life history stages on the natal site (reviewed by horrall 1981). many studies of movement and migration (including hom- ing) are based on ﬁsh older than young of the year class (e.g., horrall 1981; l’abee-lund & vøllestad 1985), where usually no information about the parental spawning site of the speciﬁc individual is available. under these circumstances, distinction between movement and migration is merely a question of the genetic population structure may give stronger evidence of natal homing (e.g., stepien & faber 1998; miller et al. 2001). the advantages of spawning in another place than the natal site (dispersal vs. philopatry) are thought to be related to risk of inbreeding and kin competition, and this often differs between sexes due to mating system and general life history (perrin & mazalov 2000). interpretation, whereas analysis of spontaneous swimming activity has been reported to be more pronounced in female pike than males doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00136.x 191 koed et al. (vostradovsky 1981). a number of studies report that the spawning season is a period of high activity of pike (e.g., diana et al. 1977; cook & bergersen 1988; lucas 1992). most previous studies have reported no difference in movement between male and female pike in relation to spawning (e.g., cook & bergersen 1988; lucas 1992; rosell & macoscar 2002). however, moen & henegar (1971) reported that female pike moved more than male pike. they gave no informa- tion whether this was in relation to spawning, but they reported that ﬁsh tagged in the fall moved less than those tagged in the spring in the same area. on basis of a study involving mark-recapture and genetic analysis, miller et al. (2001) concluded that pike in kabetoga- ma lake exhibit both natal-site and spawning-site ﬁdelity. in lakes and reservoirs, the movements of pike have been investigated in several studies using telemetry (e.g., diana et al. 1977; diana 1980; cook & bergersen 1988; lucas 1992; jepsen et al. 2001). the results from these studies show much variation among populations and individuals. little is known about movements of adult pike within rivers, including annual patterns of movements and spawning habitat choices. masters et al. (2002) studied radio-tagged denmark w n s e river gudenaa pike during autumn and winter in a river, but these results were mainly related to ﬂood events. the present study investigated annual movement and migration of ten radio-tagged pike within a river system in relation to sex, speciﬁc growth rate, body size, temperature, lunar phase, water discharge, and velocity. materials and methods research area the 158 km-long river gudena˚ (fig. 1) has a mean )1. the river width in the annual discharge of 40 m3 s research area is between 50 and 90 m and maximum depth is 3.3 m (2.3 m at the mouth). the 30 km narrow fjord is shallow (<10 m) and brackish (0–30&), with salinity always >10& in the bottom water layer at the river outlet. intrusions of saline water >500 m upstream of the river mouth occur approximately 1–2 days a year. due to eutrophic lakes upstream of the study area, the river water is turbid. submerged vegetation, dominated by sparganium sp. and potamogeton sp., can be found in the shallow the banks. areas of the main channel and near kattegat randers fjord river nørreå als tidal limit river gudenå 10 km fig. 1. map of the river gudena˚ showing the position of the locations of the automatic listening station (als). the arrow (.) in- dicates the tagging area of ten pike radio- tagged in the lower section of the river. 192 important emergent vegetation at the edge of the river is glyceria maxima (hartman) holmberg, phragmites australis trin. and scirpus lacustris l. the ﬁsh fauna is dominated by bleak alburnus alburnus (l.), roach rutilus rutilus (l.), and bream abramis brama (l.). pikeperch stizostedion lucioperca (l.), perch perca ﬂuviatilis l., ruffe gymnocephalus cernuus l., atlan- tic salmon salmo_salar l., brown_trout s. trutta l., and eel anguilla anguilla (l.) are also abundant (koed et al. 2000). capture and tagging on 26 august 1998, ten pike (table 1) were caught by electro-ﬁshing (6500 w pulsed dc-current) on the river stretch 0.2–4 km from the river mouth (fig. 1), and radio-tagged. two of these pike were captured by anglers on 7 september and 4 october, respectively, but the returned transmitters were reused to tag two additional pike on 27 november 1998 (table 1). the data from the two angler-captured pike are not included in the data analysis. after tagging, the ﬁsh were released into the capture area. the transmitters were cylindrical (model 5902; advanced telemetry systems inc., santi, mn, usa), 45 mm long, 15 mm in diameter, weight in air 14.5 g, and an expected battery-life of 350 days. each transmitter operated on a separate frequency within the 142.000–142.500 mhz range. the ﬁsh were )1 solution of anaesthetised immediately in a 60 mg l eugenol (clove oil) (merck-schuchardt, germany) until opercular rate became slow and irregular (3– 6 min). the transmitter was inserted into the body cavity through a mid-ventral 20–25-mm incision, anterior to the pelvic girdle. the antenna was run out through a hole in the abdominal wall, pierced with a blunt needle. the incision was closed with two to three separate sutures. the duration of the operation was between 3 and 5 min, and recovery time was 5–10 min. the water temperature ranged from 3 to 14 °c at the time of tagging. after tagging, each ﬁsh was measured (lt) to the nearest 0.5 cm below and weighed to the nearest 50 g (table 1). pike movement and migration tracking and data analysis radio tracking was performed manually from a boat using a hand-held receiver (model r2100; advanced telemetry systems inc.) and a four-element yagi antenna. further tracking was conducted automatically by one stationary automatic listening station (als, model d5041; advanced telemetry systems inc.) loc- ated 1.2 km from the river mouth (fig. 1). the als operated for the entire period, recording passage of tagged ﬁsh. the river was divided into 0.1-km sections, starting with section 0.1 at the river mouth at randers fjord (the river stretch from 0 to 0.1 km). the position of each ﬁsh was determined and recorded within 0.1 km sections using landmarks. during tracking, ﬁsh were approached at low speed with the boat’s motor turned off to minimise disturbance. the ﬁsh were tracked every third day from 0900 to approximately 1300 h from 15 september 1998 to 7 september 1999. the ﬁsh could not be tracked in the tidal region and in the fjord due to the high conductivity of the brackish water. we assumed that tagged ﬁsh that could not be found during one or more trackings, but were later located in the river had been in the fjord. pike movement in relation to spawning was deﬁned to occur during 15 march–15 may. this was based on catches of more than 50 mature pike during the spring of 1999 that showed that pike spawned during april. they were all caught in the capture area of the radio- tagged pike or in the vicinity of this area. recapture on 10 september 1999, the ten radio-tagged pike were recaptured by electro-ﬁshing (table 1). the condi- tion factor, k, of each ﬁsh was calculated as k ¼ 100 w l 3 (g), lt ¼ total length (cm)]. the speciﬁc growth rate (gw) of weight and length (% day-1) was calculated according to wootton (1998). the pike were sexed and examined with emphasis on the position of the transmitter, [w ¼ bodyweight t table 1. summary of the biometric and move- ment data for the ten radio-tagged pike in the the river gudena˚. all ﬁsh were lower part of recaptured on 10 september 1999. total movement (km) lt at tagging (cm) weight at tagging lt at recapture (cm) weight at recapture (kg) fish # time of tagging sex speciﬁc growth rate (% * 10 e2) 350 422 382 393 361 402 441 371 412 432 25.3 27.6 38.1 77.4 7.4 10.9 7.9 4 5 25.3 113 73 99 100 92 65 57 69 59 60 11.60 2.65 7.50 7.80 5.80 1.95 1.25 2.3 1.45 1.25 114 74 101 102 96 68 60 73 65 67 9.40 2.40 6.70 7.15 6.15 2.40 1.50 2.70 1.95 1.95 f m f f f m m m m f 27 nov 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 27 nov 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 26 aug 98 0.31 0.36 0.53 0.69 1.12 1.19 1.35 1.48 2.55 2.90 193 koed et al. healing of the incision, and internal changes caused by the transmitter. statistical analysis a general linear model (glm) with movement as the dependent factor and sex, length, growth, and period (spawning vs. non-spawning) as the independent factors was performed. multiple regressions with 3- day movements as the dependent factor and tempera- ture, lunar phase and discharge as independent factors were performed (backward elimination). a nonlinear lunar phase parameter was developed, and the lunar day transformed to linear data (l1) by sine transformed as described by jellyman (1991): ll ¼ sin½2plð29:75þ   p where l ¼ lunar day;

(2004) observed both male- and female-biased dispersal in brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis mitchill, 1814). most previous studies have not found any difference in movement between male and female pike in relation to spawning (e.g., cook & bergersen 1988; lucas 1992; rosell & macoscar 2002). however, jepsen et al. (2001) reported that female pike tended to move more extensively than males in a small lake (22.5 ha), but this did not relate to the spawning period. moen & henegar (1971) also observed that female pike moved more than the male pike, but gave no information whether this was in relation to spawning. however, they reported that ﬁsh tagged in the autumn moved less than those tagged in the spring in the same area. tracking studies on another esocid, the muskellunge (esox masquinongy mitchill, 1824) showed that the females moved greater distances during spawning than males (minor & crossman 1978). it has been reported that female pike grow faster and attain larger sizes than males (e.g., frost & kipling 1967; bregazzi & kennedy 1980; casselman 1996), and food consumption and spontaneous swimming activity are directly related (casselman 1978) and more pronounced in females that in males (vostra- dovsky 1981). the present results showed a negative correlation between growth rate and movement in pike, thus, these results do not support the suggestion by vostradovsky (1975), who observed that pike that moved to a distance greater than 3 km had higher daily gains in weight than the resident pike, and ascribed this to a greater chance of encountering prey. however, the lt of three of the ﬁve females were 99–113 cm and thus close to their maximum length (casselman 1996). therefore, their speciﬁc growth rate was low, which may have resulted in a ‘false’ signiﬁcant ‘speciﬁc growth rate effect’, because these three females were among the four ﬁsh that moved the greatest distance. this is supported by the fact that omitting the three females from the analysis no effect of the speciﬁc growth rate was detected (glm, p ¼ 0.21). a number of studies of pike, carried out in lake and reservoir environments, have shown pike to be relatively sedentary during the nonspawning season (e.g., malinin 1970; chapman & mackay 1984b; cook & bergersen 1988), which is in line with the present observation. at 66% of the recordings, the pike were stationary between two successive trackings and the general behaviour of the pike was character- ised by a long stationary period, then an abrupt movement, and again a long stationary period. this type of behaviour indicates a sit-and-wait food search strategy of pike, which is in line with the earlier observations of pike (e.g. diana 1980; webb & skadesen 1980). in addition to the spawning period, more intense movement was observed during early winter. in general, movement did not correlate with any of the measured physical factors. however, the increased movement during early winter may be due to increased foraging initiated by a slight temperature increase at this time. diana et al. (1977) and cook & bergersen (1988) observed an increased activity of pike in winter. cook & bergersen (1988) ascribed this increase to more active foraging by pike. jepsen et al. (2001) suggested that an increase in temperature during winter could boost the activity level of pike. however, rogers & bergersen (1995) found no change in pike movement to december despite drastic changes in temperature over that time period. rates from august radio tagging of ﬁsh can have several negative effects (reviewed by jepsen et al. 2002; baras et al. in press), such as increased mortality (nettles et al. 1983), decreased swimming capacity (mccleave & stred 1975), and reduced growth (wrenn & hackney 1979). in a study where similar transmitters and surgical procedures were applied as in the present study, jepsen & aarestrup (1999) compared the pike movement and migration growth of radio-tagged and dye-marked pike, and observed no difference in growth rate between the two groups of ﬁsh. the tagged ﬁsh in this study also seemed unaffected by the transmitters as the ﬁsh grew and their condition factor did not change during the study period. we therefore believe that the effects of carrying the transmitter, if any, were not severe, and that the present study adds new and valid information on the behaviour of river-dwelling pike. acknowledgements we thank n.
