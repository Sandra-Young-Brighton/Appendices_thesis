lucas & baras, 2001). the temporal and spatial scales of movements fluctuate strongly according to the migratory category (diadromous or potamodromous) and the life stages. impulsions for fish movement behaviours are the outcome of internal and external cues that interact to stimulate a response (lucas & baras, 2001). when fish are physiologically ready to respond (en- dogenous state), temperature, river flow and photoperiod (individually or in interaction) are important external factors that control the timing of fish spawning migrations. many river systems around the world are affected by human activities that induce drastic effects on functional habitat availability. these include longitudinal fragmentation, water flow regulations (dynesius & nilsson, 1994; fullerton et al., 2010), hy- dromorphological modifications, hydropeaking (capra et al., 2017) and local temperature fluctuations (isaak et al., 2010). such environmental 660  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:660–671. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltddegradation may influence the triggering of fish spawning movements by the perturbation of the intensity and the timing of the cues. potamodromous rheophilic cyprinids are major components of fish communities of the middle and lower reaches of temperate rivers (lucas & frear, 1997). they constitute good indicators of river degrada- tion state because of their sensitivity to environmental changes (teresa, romero, casatti, & sabino, 2011). rheophilic cyprinids have exigent habitat requirements (santos et al., 2011). this particularly applies to spawning activity, during which they have to find well- oxygenated gravel- bed spawning areas so that they place their eggs under the sub- strate (poncin, 1996; welcomme, winemiller, & cowx, 2006). to com- plete their life cycle, rheophilic cyprinids frequently make displacements and are affected by longitudinal fragmentation (ovidio & philippart, 2002, 2008). radio tracking and fish- pass monitoring studies have shown that the movement activity of large rheophilic cyprinids, such as the barbel (barbus barbus), the chub (squalius cephalus) and the nase (chondrostoma nasus) is seasonal, with the greatest distances travelled by individuals generally in the prespawning and spawning period when movements of several kilometres may be undertaken (benitez, nzau matondo, dierckx, & ovidio, 2015; britton & pegg, 2011; kulíšková, horký, slavík, & jones, 2009; de leeuw & winter, 2008; lucas & baras, 2001; ovidio, parkinson, philippart, & baras, 2007; ovidio et al., 2016). rheophilic cyprinids can develop different migratory behaviour, and they can adapt (to some extent) to unnatural habitats depending on their availability and costs of migration (fredrich, ohmann, curio, & kirschbaum, 2003; de leeuw & winter, 2008). so far, all studies dealing with the influence of environmental factors on rheophilic cyprinid movements have focussed on single species and were undertaken within a single river or during a single spawning season (fredrich et al., 2003; lucas & baras, 2001; ovidio et al., 2007). however, studies of multi- annual movement behaviour at the scale of the river basin would contribute to our understanding of the movement periodicity and allow a more accurate comprehension of the influences of environmental factors. the goal of this study was to analyse whether rheophilic cyprinids living in different places of the same river basin may develop a similar movement periodicity through- out the year and react identically to environmental cues to start their spawning migration. we focused on the spawning migration period using two abundant rheophilic cyprinid species in european rivers: the barbel and the chub. to obtain information about the mobility pat- terns of these species, we simultaneously monitored traps in three fish passes installed in the meuse basin (belgium) during three complete and consecutive years. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study areas and fish- pass monitoring the study was conducted in the belgian meuse river basin (figure 1). from downstream to upstream, the three monitored fish passes are installed in the main course of the meuse river (average annual dis- charge = 400 m3/s), in the ourthe river (67.4 m3/s; a meuse tribu- tary) and in the amblève river (19.3 m3/s; an ourthe tributary), built     |  661 respectively in 1999 (fish pass n°1 lixhe), 2009 (fish pass n°2 angleur) and 2007 (fish pass n°3 lorcé). the three fish passes are modern vertical- slot pool types (table 1), designed to be multispecific and situated in different huet fish zones (huet, 1949). for each fish pass, a capture cage was installed in the most upstream pool and removed from the water with a winch (figure 1). the fish were taken out of the cage with a hand net and placed in a tank containing river water. from january 2010 to december 2012 (3 years), we performed a total of 870 fish- pass monitoring events. the monitoring frequency varied from one to five times per week according to the intensity of fish capture. monitoring was carried out during the same week for the three devices, during 75% of the study period (100% of the time in spring), and during exactly the same day for 64% (70% in spring) of the time. at each monitoring date, the captured individuals were anaesthetised in a solution of 4- allyl- 2- methoxyphenol (eugenol: 0.1 ml/l), identified at the species level, counted, measured (±1 mm, fork length), weighted (±1 g) and released upstream of the dam after a small recuperation period. as biological models, we used two rheophilic cyprinids: the barbel and the chub. only individuals at adult stage were taken into account with a distinction was made between adult and juvenile fish according to the size categorisation for adult fish. the adult size described in philippart and vranken (1983) in the meuse river basin thanks to multi- annual fish capture by electric fishing and analyse of sexual maturity: barbel are considered as adult when the size (fork length) > 250 mm and chub > 160 mm. 2.2 | environmental factors water temperature (°c) was recorded every hour during fish- pass monitoring periods, using data loggers (tidbit onset) installed at the inlet of the fish passes. flow data (m3/s) were provided by the wallonia public service of hydrological studies (sethy, walloon region), with one measurement every hour. the photoperiod was cal- culated using sunrise and sunset data and it corresponds to the sun- shine duration per day in hours (www.ephemeride.com). during each monitoring event, each fish capture at adult stage was associated with environmental data for the previous day’s capture: • the water temperature (t) in °c: the mean daily temperature of the river of the previous day’s capture with an accuracy of 0.1°c, • the delta temperature (dt) in °c: the difference between the mean daily temperature of the previous day’s capture and the mean daily temperature of the previous day’s monitoring, • the degree days (dd8) in °c days: the sum of the mean daily tem- perature above a threshold temperature (neuheimer & taggart, 2010) of t = 8°c (temperature threshold of activity for cyprinids, souchon & tissot, 2012), starting from december 21st until the previous day’s capture (time step: 1 day). dd8 was used to as- sess seasonal gonad development on the spawning migration, and december 21st was chosen because it is the shortest day of the year and the sexual maturation of breeders is inhibited by a de- creasing photoperiod (poncin, 1989; baras & philippart, 1999). benitez and ovidio662  |     (a) (b) (c) figure 1 localisations on a belgian scale (top left) and on a basin meuse scale (top right) and picture (dam, fish pass and capture trap) of study sites in the meuse basin (rivers and fish pass associated) (a) the fish pass of lixhe in the meuse river, (b) the fish pass of angleur in the ourthe river and (c) the fish pass of lorcé in the amblève river • the water flow ratio (wfr): the ratio of the mean daily river flow and the average annual discharge of each river, • the delta water flow ratio (dwfr): the difference between the mean wfr of the previous day’s capture and the mean wfr of the previ- ous day’s monitoring, • the photoperiod in hours (hr). 2.3 | data analysis global comparisons of t and wfr of rivers and the size of adults were realised using the nonparametric test of kruskal–wallis (kw test). when the kw test was significant, we used the post hoc pair- wise comparison of mann–whitney (u test) with bonferroni–holm benitez and ovidiotable 1 characteristics of the study sites: the meuse river (fish pass of lixhe), the ourthe river (fish pass of angleur) and the amblève river (fish pass of lorcé) ourthe amblève characteristics\river elevation source (m) elevation confluence (m) length (km) drainage area (km2) average slope (‰) width (m) average annual discharge (m3/s) dominant huet fish zone dominant fish species (kg) level of water quality dam location type of dam delta height of dam (m) type of fish pass total length of fish pass (m) pools number trap system meuse 409 0 950 36000 0.4 >50 400 507 63 175 3672 2.5 30–50 67.4 bream barbel bream barbel medium lixhe mobile 8.2 pool- type, vertical slot 140 high angleur concrete ramp 4 pool- type, vertical slot 73 27 cage in the upper pool 16 cage in the upper pool 586 102 93 1083 5.2 30–50 19.3 grayling/ barbel barbel high lorcé mobile 3.3 pool- type, vertical slot 67 15 cage in the upper pool     |  663 because the number of levels is lower than 5 (zuur, hilbe, & ieno, 2013). the variable selection in the log- linear model was evaluated based on the stepwise forward selection method by the aic (akaike information criterion: boyce, vernier, nielsen, & schmiegelow, 2002; burnham & anderson, 2002). we considered only the best model, that is, the model with the lowest aic. to ensure that there is no temporal autocorrelation, best models were tested using the durbin–watson test (crawley, 1993; savin & white, 1977). we compared the full models with the null models using likelihood ratio tests (mccullagh & nelder, 1989) and we calculated the pseudo- r2 as the goodness- of- fit (menard, 1995). we used hierarchical par- titioning (hp) with pseudo- r2 as the measure of goodness- of- fit to determine the relative importance (the independent contribu- tion) of each factors to the full model by calculating the percentage of the total variance (chevan & sutherland, 1991; walsh & mac nally, 2013). we followed mac nally (2002) to identify statistically significant variables by randomising the data matrix 1,000 times. we verified the multicollinearity of the variables with the variance inflation factor (o’brien, 2007; gvif > 2.5 in binary logistic regres- sion: zuur et al., 2010). the influences of environmental factors on spawning migration initiation/inhibition were compared using cumulative frequency and the median (p50), the percentile 20 (p20) and the percentile 80 (p80) of the variables selected by the model. we used the kw test and u test to identify significant differences between rivers. all statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program r (the r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria, version 3.1.1.). statistical significance was set a confidence level of 95%. 3 |  results 3.1 | temperature and water flow ratio fluctuations mean water temperature (figure 2) between 2010 and 2012 was significantly different (kw test, χ2 = 241.6, df = 2, p < .05) between rivers: 10.3°c for the upland river, the amblève (0.1 to 24.6°c), 11.3°c for the middle- land river, the ourthe (0.2 to 25.3°c), and 14.4°c for the lowland river, the meuse (1.7 to 27°c) (u tests, all p < .05). the water flow ratio showed a similar temporal evolu- tion between rivers, with maximum values in winter and minimum values in spring and summer (kw test, χ2 = 24.78, df = 2, p = .26): the meuse mean value = 0.89 (0.1 to 10.5), the ourthe mean value = 0.89 (0.1 to 10.9) and the amblève mean value = 0.91 (0.1 to 12.0). 3.2 | capture and size diversity during the 3 years of simultaneous monitoring (2010–2012), we captured a total of 296 barbels and 122 chubs (table 2). the number of individuals varied according to the river, with 69 barbel individuals in lixhe (meuse river), 174 in angleur (ourthe river) and 53 in lorcé (amblève river); for chubs, we captured 37, 69 and 16 individuals, respectively. barbels were significantly different correction. abundances of adult fish captured were compared between rivers, and the periodicity of captures was identified ac- cording to the julian day of the capture and it compared between rivers, using the kw test and the u test. we identified factors that significantly influenced the presence or absence of a spawn- ing migration between december 21st and june 30th of each year (cumulative periods of winter inhibition and spring migration ac- tivation) of adult individuals within three rivers. according to the protocol of zuur, ieno, and elphick (2010), the profile of dd8 does not correspond to a linear link with the variable presence/absence. it has therefore been replaced by a categorical variable with four classes (cdd8: two extremes and two intermediates) to maintain a quantitative character: c1 (<20°c days), c2 (20–250°c days), c3 (250–450°c days) and c4 (>450°c days). we used generalised linear models (glm: mccullagh & nelder, 1989), more particularly a log- linear model assuming a binomial error distribution, and the logit link function (zuur, ieno, walker, saveliev, & smith, 2009) with quantitative variables (environmental factors) and categorical variables (cdd8 with c1 as reference, the river with the meuse and the year with 2010) as independent variables. the year and the river (both categorical variables) are considered as fixed effects benitez and ovidio664  |     figure 2 temporal evolutions of mean daily temperature and daily water flow ratio between 2010 and 2012 for the three rivers in size between rivers at adult stage (kw test, χ2 = 59.4, df = 2, p < .05): ourthe (578.9 ± 65.6 mm) = meuse (550.6 ± 85.6 mm) (u test, p = .97) > amblève (471.6 ± 74.7 mm) (u tests, both p < .05). similarly, adult chub size significantly differed between rivers (kw test, χ2 = 18.28, df = 2, p = .0001), with only adults of the ourthe being larger than those of the meuse and the amblève (u tests, both p < .05). 3.3 | interannual variation and capture periodicity of adults during the simultaneous multi- annual monitoring, the number of cap- tures varied between years for both species (table 2). this variabil- ity was more important for barbel than for the chub, with a capture number between 5 and 135 individuals (mean = 33 individuals) per benitez and ovidio    |  665 table 2 number of adult individuals captured (total, per river and per year) and the mean size (fork length) in mm with the standard deviation (±sd) species rivers n 2010 n 2011 n 2012 n per river n total adult size in mm (sd) barbel meuse 13 14 42 69 550.6 (85.6) ourthe 135 10 29 174 296 578.9 (65.6) amblève 27 21 5 53 chub meuse 7 11 19 37 471.6 (74.7) 403.7 (65.9) ourthe 40 10 19 69 122 452.5 (53.4) amblève 10 6 0 16 322.6 (149.7) figure 3 periodicity of captures depending on the river and the year for adult barbels, with the spawning migration season (grey square) year per river. chub abundance varied between 0 and 40 individu- als (mean = 13 individuals) per year and per river. highest barbel and chub captures were obtained in different years. clearly, spring was the period with the most captures; 91% of barbel and 83% of chub captures across all three rivers (figures 3 and 4). for the barbel across all three sampling years, the ratio of capture during spring increased up to 94% and 100%, respectively, for the amblève and the ourthe. global capture periodicity of barbel within the meuse was separated into two distinct periods: 67% in spring and 32% between late august and late october. the chub showed a more mixed capture periodicity between the rivers, with 73% of the captures in spring in the meuse, 96% in the ourthe and 38% in the amblève. both species showed a significant difference in the annual periodicity of captures between rivers for each year (kw tests: all p < .05). benitez and ovidio666  |     figure 4 periodicity of captures depending on the river and the year for adult chubs, with the spawning migration season (grey square) 3.4 | spawning migration periodicity and influence of environmental factors 3.4.1 | barbel in the meuse basin, the global spawning migration periodicity of the barbel occured at p50 = 3rd of may (p20 = april 21st and p80 = may 27th), but the dates differed significantly between rivers (kw test, χ2 = 62.9, df = 2, p < .05): p50 = 30th of april (april 8th–may 3rd) for the meuse, p50 = 2nd of may (april 18th–may 27th) for the ourthe and p50 = 26th of may (may 14th–may 27th) for the amblève. of the factors initially considered as predictors, after stepwise selection, the factor combinations that best discriminated the presence of adult barbel during the spawning migration period (2010 to 2012) within the three rivers (log- linear model: table 3) were cdd8 (c2 positively and c4 negatively), the river (the ourthe positively) and the t (posi- tively). no temporal autocorrelation was observed (durbin–watson test: dw = 2.2, p = .4). of the total variation explained (pseudo- r2 0.28) for the presence of barbel within fish passes, 54.9% was sig- nificantly attributable to cdd8, 30.3% to t and 14.8% to the river. the analysis of cumulative frequencies of barbels during the spring (figure 5) showed that barbels were captured at different values of t between rivers (kw test, χ2 = 71.5, df = 2, p < .05). barbels had a median value of 14.8°c (p20 = 13.1 and p80 = 16.8°c) in the meuse and 14.3°c (10.2–16.8°c) in the ourthe (u test, p = .29). t of capture was greater in the amblève (u tests, both p < .05), with a median value of 18.4°c (18.1–18.9°c). the median value of dd8 during spring cap- ture of barbels was 237.1°c days (115.3–279.7°c days) in the meuse and 258.9°c days (198.4–370.5°c days) in the amblève. the dd8 value during barbel captures was significantly different between rivers (kw test, χ2 = 51.1, df = 2, p < .05) and it was significantly smaller (u tests, both p < .05) in the ourthe, with a median value of 158.3°c days (92.6–274.6°c days). 3.4.2 | chub the global spawning migration periodicity of the chub occurred at p50 = 11th of may (april 13th–june 4th). the spawning migra- tion period of the chub did not significantly differ between rivers (kw test, p > .05): p50 = 2nd of may (april 12th–may 22nd) for the meuse, p50 = 16th of may (april 21st–june 12th) for the ourthe and p50 = 20th of may (april 24th–may 26th) for the amblève. depending the stepwise selection of model, the factor combinations that best discriminated the presence of adult chub during the spawning migra- tion period within the three rivers (log- linear model: table 3) were cdd8 (c2 positively), the river (the ourthe positively and the amblève benitez and ovidiotable 3 results of best presence models for the barbel and the chub in the three fish passes during the spawning migration period including coefficient estimates (β) for each variable together with standard errors (se), odds ratios (eβ) and significance of the wald test (p) for testing the hypothesis that the corresponding estimate is equal to zero (null hypothesis : in bold when p<.05). likelihood ratio test and pseudo- r2 statistics indicate the goodness- of- fit. also presented are the independent effects (ie) of each explanatory variable (%) on the dependent variable (fish presence), calculated by hierarchical partitioning and the generalised variance inflation factor (gvif)     |  667 β se eβ p ie (%) gvif −6.926 0.907 0.001 <.001 1.407 0.263 −2.487 0.305 1.286 −0.085 0.839 0.994 1.213 0.064 0.363 0.408 1.658 0.388 −1.739 0.260 0.348 0.838 −1.808 0.870 1.093 1.291 0.072 0.139 0.354 0.588 4.084 1.301 0.083 1.357 .048 .791 .040 <.001 54.959 2.077 30.295 14.746 2.207 1.109 3.618 0.919 df = 7;

britton & pegg, 2011; lucas & batley, 1996) observed that autumn movements benitez and ovidioof barbel are usually directed downstream due to a homing behaviour, but our results demonstrated that these movements could also be di- rected upstream and remained constant from year to year. however, our sampling procedure (in fish pass) does not allow the observation of downstream movements. as this kind of behaviour was particularly observed in the canalised river meuse, it may represent a wintering behaviour or a premise of upstream movement for the next spawning migration. the monitoring of fish passes demonstrated the capture variability of barbel and chub within three different rivers of the same basin and the flexibility of the timing of migration behaviours from one river to another. indeed, the precise timing of the spawning migration period of the barbel may shift in time depending on the position in the river basin. we observed that barbels living in the upland river (amblève) initiated their migration later than those of middle- land (ourthe) and lowland rivers (meuse). the best model of the presence of bar- bel had a pseudo- r2 of 0.28 which is a relatively good fit for the data (louviere, hensher, & swait, 2000). environmental factors that play a role in spawning barbel movement within the three rivers were tem- perature (as already suggested by baras, lambert, & philippart, 1994 and britton & pegg, 2011 for the barbus barbus and santos, ferreira, godinho, & bochechas, 2002 for the iberian barbel, barbus bocagei), but the dd8 was a determinant variable in our study. surprisingly, we observed a different temperature peak of spawn- ing movements at a warmer thermal range in the upland river (between 17 and 19°c) compared to the ranges of the two other rivers (between 12 and 15°c). moreover, the thermal threshold for the initiation of the spawning migration was more variable (temperature differential of 8°c at p20) than at the end of the migration period (around 2°c at p80). these results indicate that the environmental factors for the ini- tiation of the spawning migration seem to be different depending on the river, but the end of the migration period occurred at more similar environmental conditions. such a phenomenon may facilitate synchro- nous arrival in the spawning areas, at the end of the migration period. the degree day cue reinforces the idea of the existence of a certain thermal homogeneity at the end of the migration period compared to the beginning. barbels in the three rivers have accumulated the same degree days at p80, which reinforced the role of this variable in the gonadal development in regards to the initiation of the spawning act under the control of an endogenous cycle, as suggested by fredrich et al. (2003) for the chub. baras and philippart (1999) observed that the spawning behaviour act depends on two environmental factors to maximise juvenile survival and growth: a photoperiod increase and a water temperature >13.5°c, more precisely between 13°c and 24°c (britton & pegg, 2011; souchon & tissot, 2012). as well known for the salmonids (quinn, 2005), the spawning date is reflected by the thermal regime of the river. in our study, the spawning migration occurred over an approximate period of 8 weeks for each river and each year. our results indicate that there may be a short time lag in the spawning act and, as a consequence, in the future fry emergence period between rivers, but the egg incubation will takes place in optimal conditions, everywhere (4 days at 20°c to 15 days at 14°c; penáz, 1973) without any impact on fry survival.     |  669 the barbels of the meuse basin belong to one genetic popula- tion (gennotte, michaux, prignon, ovidio, & melard, 2014), which means that the observed behavioural differences may not have orig- inated from the strain. this suggests that barbels can adapt their behavioural tactics and the timing of their spawning mobility pat- terns according to the characteristics to their local environment, as well as the start and end points of their migratory route. in terms of space and time use, a fish will theoretically adopt the best strategy (best of bad situation, pfennig & pfennig, 2005), and it must make compromises in terms of costs and benefits (the notion of trade- off, wolf, van doorn, leimar, & weissing, 2007). some of the most recent evidence has demonstrated that several species of fish can learn and integrate complex spatial information, indicating their ability of complex cognitive processing (braithwaite & de perera, 2006), which makes it possible to optimise their behaviour within their home- range, especially since the lifespan of a barbel is rela- tively long (15–25 years). barbels living in the upland river amblève had nearer spawning habitats and probably adjusted their timing of movement in the upper limit of spawning migration period in con- trast to the individuals of the lower course of the ourthe and the ca- nalised meuse, which are relatively far from the gravel- bed spawning areas. branco, amaral, ferreira, and santos (2017) observed that the iberian barbel (luciobarbus bocagei) might adjust their life- history strategy to increase residential proportion within a fragmented en- vironment. this presumably results in balance between cost migra- tion energy within a fragmented environment, availability habitat and benefits to choice a suboptimal spawning area. indeed in our case, the lentic environment caused by anthropogenic activities can be affected by the loss of vital habitats (le pichon, gorges, baudry, goreaud, & boët, 2009) and it reduces the potential to move, there- fore induce an adaptive behaviour. the spawning migration period of chubs was more extensive than that of barbels between late march and late june. the main reason for this is that chubs are iteroparous fishes and can spawn twice per year, migrating to different spawning grounds within the same year (fredrich et al., 2003). unlike the barbel, spawning periods of migra- tion for chubs were not different between rivers in the hydrographic basin of the meuse taking account the smaller number of chubs. in addition to temperature and degree day, our results highlight the role of temperature variations (i.e., a positive variation) in the initiation of spawning migration. those temperatures with a threshold close to 16°c and the dd8 between 100 and 250°c.days (i.e., an accumula- tion of 14 days and 36 days at 15°c) act as clear cues of spawning migration. the range of thermal threshold for the initiation of spawn- ing movements of chub between rivers was more shortened (around 2.7°c at p20 and 1.1°c at p80) than for barbels, and threshold factors were not different between rivers. due to their less specific ecological requirements, chubs are more ubiquitous and probably adapt and re- produce within more anthropised environments (arlinghaus & wolter, 2003) compared to the barbel. this may explain the greater homoge- neity within the river basin. our study demonstrated that within the same river basin, rheo- philic cyprinids demonstrate flexibility in terms of their responses to benitez and ovidio670  |     environmental variables and may optimise the starting date of migra- tion to spawning grounds, depending on their local environment and individual experiences. this phenomenon was more pronounced in the barbel, which has more need to adapt to anthropisation because of its specific strong ecological requirements. acknowledgements
