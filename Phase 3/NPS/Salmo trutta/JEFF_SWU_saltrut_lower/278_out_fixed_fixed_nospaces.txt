(2006) pointed out that a bias in the literature toward salmonid species which frequently engage in strong territorial competition as juveniles may be the cause of an underestimation of the prevalence of density-dependent growth in adult stream ﬁsh. the detection of compensatory patterns such as density-dependent body growth can be affected by the spatial scale at which these patterns are investigated, that is, the scale at which mean density and mean body size are derived. density-dependence should be esti- mated by averaging population numbers or densities over areas that are scaled appropriately to the move- ments of the individuals studied. especially in the case of mobile organisms, study areas need to be large enough to detect the average density of conspeciﬁcs experienced by individuals. ray & hastings (1996) suggested as a rule of thumb that data should be scaled such that no more than 10% of individuals moves across its boundaries. moreover, limited movement or dispersal can provide the conditions for the subdivi- sion of a global population into several local popula- tions with independent dynamics. in an interesting and inﬂuential study on brown_trout, jenkins et al. (1999) investigated the occurrence of density-dependent growth in underyearlings at different spatial scale, from ‘segments’ (5–31 m in length – rifﬂes, run and pools) to ‘sections’ (340–500 m in length), either by manipulating densities in experimental settings or in the wild. not surprisingly, the clearest evidence of the occurrence of density-dependent growth was provided by the experimental settings in which densities were artiﬁcially produced. anyway, the pattern was also observed, although less clearly, with natural variations in density occurring in the wild. jenkins et al. (1999) suggested that a sampling area needs to be at least 100 m2 to capture the trout density experienced by the average individual over the preceding growth period. moreover, the availability of food, such as invertebrate drift, is affected by individuals living upstream. therefore, food local abundance may depend on trout density in a much larger area than that directly experienced by a trout. another aspect potentially inﬂuencing the scale at which density-dependent growth may be detected is the mobility of organism, and it has been observed that trout may move over considerable distances (gowan et al. 1994). in a study on four marble trout (salmo_marmoratus cuvier 1817) populations living in slovenian streams (gatsnik, gorska, huda and zakojska), vincenzi et al. (2008b) found a clear negative relationship between the mean age-speciﬁc body length of a year-class and total density of conspeciﬁcs experienced by the density-dependent growth at two spatial scales individuals of the year-class during their ﬁrst year of life. the variables of the density-dependent relation- ship were computed at the whole stream level. data on mean length and density of the four populations were pooled together to increase sample size and to cover a wider range of densities. on the contrary, the studied streams are divided in sectors delimited by natural barriers generally restraining and in some cases preventing the upstream movement of marble trout. limited movement and dispersal might provide the conditions for the establishment of independent pop- ulation dynamics and trout in different sectors might experience different density. by averaging out lengths the whole stream level we might and densities at actually lose important information on density-depen- dent patterns at smaller scales. aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between density of marble trout during the ﬁrst year of life and mean body size through the lifetime of year- classes at two spatial scales – the sector level (length and weight) and the whole stream level (only weight) – in order to derive insights on the scale at which density-dependent growth may be observed. speciﬁ- cally, we explored: (i) the existence of a signiﬁcant relationship between body size (both length and weight) and population density also when computing mean body size and density at the sector level; (ii) whether the presence of physical barriers preventing the upstream movement of ﬁsh may affect the strength of the density-dependent relationship. material and methods study area, collection methods, sampling surveys and translocation methods for the creation of new popu- lations have been described in detail elsewhere (crivelli et al. 2000; vincenzi et al. 2008a; b); there- fore, only aspects relevant to this study are reported here along with some of the results presented in vincenzi et al. (2008b). species description and studied populations sexual maturation of marble trout is size-dependent; spawning occurs at a minimum body length of 200 mm and typically when females are 3+ (vincenzi et al. 2008a). egg production is positively related to female length and iteroparity is commonly observed (vincenzi et al. 2008a). spawning takes place in november–december whereas hatching occurs in march and emergence in may–june. marble trout feed preferentially on invertebrates, with some evi- dence of cannibalism (dusan jesensek, pers. comm.). today, only seven remnant pure (less than 2% of foreign genes, fumagalli et al. 2002) populations persist in the soca and idrijca river basins (slovenia, 339 vincenzi et al. crivelli et al. 2000), the huda population being one of them. as part of a conservation plan started in 1993 (crivelli et al. 2000), three new populations were created by stocking 1+ individuals raised in the ﬁsh farm in previously ﬁshless streams (zakojska, gorska and gatsnik). the populations of gorska and zakojska were created in 1996 by stocking 500 individuals aged 1+ in each stream while the population of gatsnik was created in 1998 by stocking 599 marble trout aged 1+. marble trout raised in the ﬁsh farm were introduced in headwater stretches located between impassable water- falls (table 1) and successfully reproduced within the streams. marble trout is the only ﬁsh species within the headwaters of the four studied streams. the gorska population was wiped out by a severe debris ﬂood in october 2004 while the marble trout populations of huda and zakojska experienced a major drop in population size after severe ﬂoods in october 2004 and in september 2007, respectively. the four streams differ greatly in habitat features (table 1), with gorska and zakojska divided in sectors separated by natural physical barriers (i.e., waterfalls) allowing only limited downstream movement of trout and thus called one- way streams. on the contrary, gatsnik and huda are two-way streams (huda being steeper), as marble trout can move from sector to sector in either upstream and downstream direction (table 1). data collection sampling surveys were performed every june on the whole length of the headwater stretches from 1997 to 2005 for gorska, from 1997 to 2007 for zakojska, from 1999 to 2007 for gatsnik and from 2001 to 2007 for huda, respectively. we electroﬁshed every stream two times starting from downstream by using a gasoline-powered, portable backpack electroﬁshing unit, to produce a multiple-pass removal estimate of trout abundance using microﬁsh 3.0 (van deventer & platts 1989). all captured ﬁsh aged ‡ 1+ were anaes- thetised with benzocaine, measured for total length (l, to the nearest mm) and weight (w, g) and if sampled for the ﬁrst time the adipose ﬁn was removed and scales were taken for age assessment. trout longer table 1. main habitat features of the four studied streams. than 115 mm (l) were marked with carlin tags (institute of freshwater research, sweden). marble trout were returned live near the point of capture. age was determined by tag examination or by reading scales if the individual was not tagged (ﬁrst sampling or tag lost). capture rates in the streams are higher than 80%. the small size of marble trout aged 0+ prevented their sampling in june and therefore they were not included in this study. sex determination was not possible in june due to lack of gonad development. maximum age observed for marble trout period in the studied streams was 8 years. statistical methods the statistical analyses presented here were carried out only on marble trout hatched in the streams and were performed in four steps. first, we investigated movement rate across sectors by computing over the entire sampling period the percentage of marble trout sampled at year t + 1 in a sector different from the one where the ﬁsh was sampled at year t. second, differences in mean density across years among sectors were estimated for gatsnik and zakojska by ﬁtting a linear mixed-effect model (pinheiro & bates, 2000) with year of sampling modelled as random effect. third, we investigated which explanatory variables better explain variations in mean age-speciﬁc body length and weight (lx, wx, x = 1 + ...5 +) of marble trout year-classes at the sector level (lsc x ) and at the whole stream level ). we did not investigate body size at ages > 5+ as we lacked the necessary sample size. we assumed that marble trout spent their ﬁrst of life in the sector where they were sampled for the ﬁrst time. x , w ws x x , w sc (lws lsc x and w sc x were computed for each stream and sampling year t as the sector-speciﬁc mean length and weight of x-year-old trout (x = 1 + ...5 +), respec- tively, where sc identiﬁes

(i.e., along all sectors), respectively. lws x values have been already reported in vincenzi et al. (2008b). trout that moved from one sector to another were not used to compute lws x and w ws x x and w sc x x ). both dsc ancovas were performed on the ln-transformed response variables lsc (x = 1 + ...5 +) sepa- rately for gatsnik and zakojska (for only these two populations we had the minimum sample size for the statistical analyses). we chose as independent vari- ables age, year, sector, the sector-speciﬁc density of all marble trout aged ‡ 1+ experienced by the individuals of a year-class during the ﬁrst year of life (from here on referred to as dsc u ) and the sector-speciﬁc density of marble trout when they are aged x ( dsc u and dsc x were ln-transformed in the ancova model. we included dsc u (ind m-2) as a candidate predictor of body growth through the lifetime as growth rates and morphological, physiological and behavioural traits in a number of species are triggered by early experience, nutritional and habitat conditions and then become relatively ﬁxed (e.g., schlichting & pigliucci 1998; bateson 2001). moreover, vincenzi et al. (2008b) found a signiﬁcant relationship between dws u and lws x for all ages, while density after the ﬁrst year of life of the cohort ( dws x ) did not explain a signiﬁcant part of the variability in lws u of marble trout were computed by dividing the estimated number of marble trout aged ‡ 1+ living in a sector ( dsc u ) or in the whole stream ( dws u ) during the ﬁrst year of life by the overall pool area of the sector (for dsc u ) or of the whole stream (for dws u ) in which the cohort lived. as marble trout live preferentially in pools, pool area offered the best quantiﬁcation of in-stream habitat available for marble trout (dusan jesensek, pers. comm.). as sampling was performed once a year, density d was computed as the mean of density of marble trout at year t - 1 and at year t, where t is the year when the year-class was 1+ (for dws u ) or aged x (for dsc x . densities dsc u and dsc u and dws x ). in the lines, form l: transformation, xþ ¼ ln a þ b ln d and finally, where signiﬁcant, we investigated the relationship between density d (either d: u or d: x) and age-speciﬁc response variables l: w : the and x x (x = 1 + ... 5+) either at the sector level (sc) and at the whole stream level (ws). speciﬁcally, we ﬁtted x ¼ a þ b d and straight x ¼ a þ b d, and negative power curves after loga- w : form rithmic lnðl: xþ ¼ lna þ bln d. the analysis at the sector level was carried out for each age class x by pooling together data on mean density (either dsc x ) and mean body size (both lsc x and w sc x ) across years and sectors. as in zakojska the surface of several pools is less than the minimum sampling area suggested by jenkins et al. (1999) to capture the trout density actually experienced by an average individual over the preceding growth period, in lnð w : u or dsc the density-dependent growth at two spatial scales we carried out the same analysis by using as independent variable the two-sector mean density, that u or dsc is, x ) estimated in the sector in which the cohort lived and in the sector upstream. the mean of the densities (either dsc x or dws the analysis at the whole stream level was per- formed for each age class x by pooling together data on mean density (either dws x ) and mean body u weight w ws across years and across the four studies populations. the effect of density on body length lws x at the whole stream level was already presented in vincenzi et al. (2008b); the relationship was also reported in this work to facilitate the comparison with the new results obtained at the sector level. akaike information criterion (aic) was used to explore which model form better ﬁtted the observed pattern. aics were calculated for the linear (aiclinear) and negative power (aicpower) model. negative power model was assumed to be the best if aicpower – aiclinear < 2 (motulsky & christopoulos 2004). the signiﬁcance level a for all statistical tests was set at 0.05. all statistical analyses were performed by using the software r (r development core team, 2006). results a total of 6031, 442, 2021 and 277 marble trout hatched within the streams were sampled in gatsnik, gorska, zakojska and huda, respectively. analysis of movement of marble trout showed a frequency of movement of individuals among sectors for all years of sampling combined of 10% in gatsnik, 2.4% in zakojska, 5.1% in gorska and 10.6% in huda, respectively. as expected, in gatsnik and huda trout moved both upstream and downstream whereas in zakojska and gorska only downstream movement was observed. mean length and weight at age 1+ in sectors in gatsnik and zakojska are reported in table 2, whereas densities estimated at the sector level and at the whole stream level in gatsnik and zakojska are showed in fig. 1. signiﬁcant differences in mean ﬁsh density among sectors were found in both gatsnik and zakojska (gatsnik, zakojska, f5,35 = 21.11, p < 0.01). f5,30 = 19.82, p < 0.01; the sector level besides the large effect of age, the two most important variables explaining a signiﬁcant proportion of the overall variation in mean age-speciﬁc length lsc x in gatsnik and of year-classes at zakojska were sector and trout density dsc u experi- enced by the year-class during its ﬁrst year of life (table 3). on the contrary, population density at age x dsc x was not signiﬁcant in both streams, while year- effect and the interaction between dsc u and sector was signiﬁcant only in gatsnik. 341 vincenzi et al. table 2. mean density (ind m-2) in sectors in gatsnik and zakojska during the study period and mean individual length (mm) and weight (g) of year- classes at age 1+ lsc 1þ. sector gatsnik 1 2 3 4 5 6 zakojska 1 2 3 4 5 6 mean (±sd) lsc 1þ( ± sd) w sc 1þ(±sd) 0.13 ± 0.07 0.57 ± 0.31 0.30 ± 0.16 0.63 ± 0.30 0.27 ± 0.14 0.30 ± 0.13 0.70 ± 0.23 0.42 ± 0.13 0.20 ± 0.09 0.29 ± 0.09 0.46 ± 0.14 0.18 ± 0.05 119.5 ± 12.2 112.9 ± 12.8 113.2 ± 15.1 107.9 ± 12.0 105.3 ± 13.3 99.8 ± 9.2 124.1 ± 5.0 113.6 ± 3.7 122.3 ± 16.2 114.2 ± 5.2 114.3 ± 11.8 117.6 ± 7.1 18.04 ± 5.79 15.18 ± 5.69 15.11 ± 6.22 12.94 ± 4.23 12.45 ± 4.43 10.65 ± 3.11 19.72 ± 2.85 15.23 ± 1.74 19.59 ± 7.43 16.24 ± 1.73 16.13 ± 4.36 17.24 ± 3.78 sector 6 is the most upstream sector in both streams. mean individual weight of year-classes at the sector level w sc x was clearly related to age, sector, and density during the ﬁrst year of life dsc u in gatsnik, whereas in zakojska the signiﬁcance level p for dsc u was slightly above 0.05 (table 3). in addition, in the case of weight as response variable, the sector density dsc x experienced at age x did not explain a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in w sc in neither streams while the interaction x between density during the ﬁrst year of life dsc u and sector was signiﬁcant only in gatsnik (table 3). as for both length and weight dsc x was not signiﬁcant in the ancovas, we performed the regression analyses by using early density dsc u as predictor of body size. at the sector level, in gatsnik the mean individual length lsc x of year-classes was negatively related to total density of marble trout aged ‡ 1+ during their ﬁrst year of life dsc u for all ages from 1+ to 5+ (fig. 2c). in zakojska, the relationship between lsc x and dsc u was signiﬁcant only for age 2+, 3+ and 4+ (fig. 2b). in both gatsnik and zakojska, power curves provided a better ﬁt than straight lines for each age. no noticeable differences were observed in the statistical signiﬁcance and coefﬁcient of determination of the age-speciﬁc relationships in zakojska when the independent variable was computed as the mean of the densities dsc u in the sector in which the cohort lived and in the sector upstream. at the whole stream level, the relationship between w sc x and dsc u was signiﬁcant for all ages in gatsnik and well explained by power curves (fig. 3c), whereas in zakojska the relationship was signiﬁcant only for age 2+, 3+ and 4+ (fig. 3b), with a low coefﬁcient of determination (table 4). at the whole stream level, the relationship between w ws u was signiﬁcant for all the ages from 1+ to 5+ (fig. 3a). in addition, in this case, power curves provided a better ﬁt than straight lines. and dws x 342 zakojska sect 1 sect 2 sect 3 sect 4 sect 5 sect 6 whole 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 year gatsnik 0 1 . 8 . 0 6 . 0 2 – m d n · i 4 0 . 2 . 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 2 – m d n · i 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2001 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 2004 year fig. 1. density of marble trout in ind. m-2 at the sector level and at the whole stream level in gatsnik and zakojska. discussion in this study, we showed how the detection of the effects of total population density on body growth in marble trout populations living in streams divided in sectors may depend on the spatial scale at which the pattern is investigated. population density dws u of marble trout during the ﬁrst year of life of year-classes estimated at the whole stream level has a clear effect through trout lifetime on mean individual weight w sc x (fig. 3a and table 4) of year-classes. in a previous work, vincenzi et al.

(2008b). our analysis showed that variability in age-speciﬁc mean individual length lsc x of year- classes at the sector level is partially explained by x and weight w sc sector-speciﬁc population density and by sector- and year-effects (table 3). the interaction between sector and dsc u was signiﬁcant for both lsc x in gatsnik, 344 and w sc x and this means that sector-effect is dependent on sector-speciﬁc density during the ﬁrst year of life. density during the ﬁrst year of life does seem to inﬂuence the body growth of marble trout. the result seem to support that body growth trajectories through the lifetime are heavily determined early in life, a carry-over effect of early density on body growth at subsequent ages. the observed relationship between total density and growth of marble trout can have alternative explana- tions: it can be either a direct effect of total population density in the newly recruited cohort, that is, inter- cohort competition, or – if density were proportional to the spawning stock – the effect of intra-cohort compe- tition for resources among underyearlings. in fact, in the latter case, the negative relation between body size growth of the newly recruited cohort and population densities of older cohorts should be interpreted as an indirect effect mediated by overall egg production. as underyearlings were not sampled in these streams, there is no ﬁeld data to directly test these hypotheses. yet, in vincenzi et al. (2007, 2008a) we showed that density of underyearlings is not correlated neither with total density of marble trout nor with spawner density, as egg production is size-dependent and female size is density-dependent. moreover, density-dependent inter- cohort competition in s. trutta and its effect on body growth rates were conﬁrmed by nordwall et al. (2001) and kaspersson & ho¨jesjo¨ (2009). therefore, while further investigations are needed, we are inclined to believe that reduced growth rates result from increased intensity of inter-cohort competition. the relationship between total population density at the sector level during the ﬁrst year of life dsc u and age-speciﬁc body size was stronger for both length lsc x and weight w sc in gatsnik, a stream in which x movement across sectors is possible in either direction, than in zakojska, where upstream movement is basically prevented by the presence of waterfalls (figs 2 and 3; table 4). this was surprising, as we expected that the effect of density at the sector level would be better detectable and stronger in the one-way stream in which waterfalls limiting movement may deﬁne the boundaries of local population dynamics. on the contrary, pool surface in sectors in gatsnik is noticeably greater than in zakojska (tab. i); as a consequence, it could be argued that in zakojska the minimum area to capture the average trout density experienced by an individual was not represented by sectors, but possibly at a larger scale. jenkins et al. (1999) suggested 100 m2 as minimum sampling area for brown_trout. nevertheless, even by using as a predictor of body size the mean of population density in two sectors (the one in which the year-class lived and the sector upstream) the statistical signiﬁcance of the relationship did not improve. density-dependent growth at two spatial scales overall, the best evidence of density-dependent growth was offered by the analysis at the whole stream level using the pooled data set (table 4), although the population of huda was a clear outlier for both mean individual length (fig. 2a) and weight (fig. 3a) of year-classes, with mean size (either length and weight) consistently greater in huda at any population density dws u . further studies and more years of data are necessary in order to understand which factors are responsible of the observed differences. in gatsnik, the strength of the density–length rela- tionship at the sector level (i.e., the slope of the power curves) was very similar to that observed at the whole stream level by using the pooled dataset, whereas differences were greater when the response variable was mean individual weight of year-classes. the density– weight relationship was stronger at the whole stream level with the pooled dataset than at the sector level in gatsnik (table 4). our results showed that the relation- ship between density and body size growth was fairly weak when marble trout were 1+, both at the whole stream level and at the sector level, which may imply that body size at age 1+ also depends on other factors, such as the availability of suitable micro-habitat. the results here presented have several implications. first, the detection of density-dependent growth may depend on the spatial scale at which the pattern is investigated. the appropriate spatial scale is likely to be related to the species and its ecology and the physical features of the stream. in the speciﬁc case of marble trout, as sectors of a stream may be character- ised by mean density and trend that are different from that observed at the whole stream level (fig. 1), it is seems reasonable that, whenever possible, density– dependent relationships are also tested by using data at the sector level. in addition to spatial scale, habitat quality is likely to be responsible for the occurrence of growth-density patterns. in an interesting study on density-dependent growth in stream-living brown_trout in rio chaballos (spain), lobo´ n-cervia´ (2005) found that the interactions between body size and density occurred at a site scale (60–80 m in length) and varied in nature among sited to the extent that the density- dependent patterns were site-speciﬁc. lobo´ n-cervia (2005) also reported that the speciﬁc life stage, ranges of density upon which density operated, and the relative importance of intra- and inter-cohort density varied greatly among sites and revealed a different operation of density depending on habitat quality. this led lobo´ n-cervia´ (2005) to suggest that spatio-tempo- ral variations in space suitable for sized individuals are the immediate factors responsible for the site-speciﬁc growth-density patterns. these ﬁndings deserve future investigations also for marble trout. second, limited movement of individuals across the boundaries of a sector may not be sufﬁcient for the 345 vincenzi et al. the issues presented here are of establishment of independent population dynamics. in the case of zakojska, contrarily to what was expected given the low movement rates of individuals, sectors may not identify local populations with independent population dynamics, but this might also depend on the limited pool surface in sectors. on the contrary, the relationship between mean individual length and weight of year-classes and density during the ﬁrst year of life was clear in gatsnik, a two-way stream with higher movement of marble trout across sectors. third, negative power curves always provided a better ﬁt of the observed patter than a linear regression. these result are in agreement with those of jenkins et al.

(2005) for s. salar, who hypothesised that body size of underyearlings follows a negative power curve in relation to ﬁsh density. because of the shape of the relationship, large increments in body size are expected when the population drops at low densities. fundamental importance for a better understanding of the role of density-dependent body growth in terms of population dynamics and resilience to the effects of catastrophic events, such as ﬂoods, droughts and landslides. in fact, a negative correlation between population abundance and individual growth that persists from the juvenile to the adult stage combined with a positive correlation between adult body size and reproductive output constitutes a compensatory mechanism for regulating recruitment (jenkins et al. 1999). a simulation anal- ysis was performed by using a data-driven individual based model of marble trout accounting for both density-dependent and individual growth and the effects of autumnal severe ﬂood events. the results of the simulation analysis sug- gested a potentially powerful role of density-depen- dent individual growth for compensatory recruitment (vincenzi et al. 2008a). given the fundamental impor- tance of body growth of marble trout for the popula- tion dynamics, further studies are needed to identify the scale at which density-dependent growth operates, particularly in streams in which movement of individ- uals is constrained by natural barriers. early survival acknowledgements we thank fondation sansouire and the angling association of tolmin for funding this study. all the people who have participated each year to the ﬁeldwork are warmly thanked. the author is also grateful to three anonymous referees for insightful and constructive suggestions. references bateson, p. 2001. fetal experience and good adult design. international journal of epidemiology 30: 928–934. 346 crivelli, a.j., poizat, g., berrebi, p., jesensek, d. & rubin, j.f. 2000. conservation biology applied to ﬁsh: the example of a project in slovenia. cybium 24: 211–230. rehabilitating the marble trout for davey, a.j.h., turner, g.f., hawkins, s.j. & doncaster, c.p. 2006. mechanisms of density dependence in stream ﬁsh: exploitation competition for food reduces growth of adult european bullheads (cottus gobio). canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 63: 597–606. egglishaw, h.j. & shackley, p.e. 1977. growth, survival and production of juvenile salmon and trout in a scottish stream, 1966–75. journal of fish biology 11: 647–672. elliott, j.a. 1994. quantitative ecology and the brown_trout. oxford: oxford university press. fumagalli, l., snoj, a., jesensek, d., balloux, f., jug, t., duron, o., brossier, f., crivelli, a.j. & berrebi, p. 2002. extreme differentiation among the remnant populations of marble trout (salmo_marmoratus) in slovenia. molecular ecology 11: 2711–2716. gowan, c., young, m.k., fausch, k.d. & riley, s.c. 1994. restricted movement in resident stream salmonids: a para- digm lost?
