2000: 9: 177–190. c munksgaard, 2000 abstract – fish assemblages in three rivers of eastern cape york penin- sula, northern australia, were sampled during the early part of the mon- soonal dry season, and the diet of 23 species was quantiﬁed. spatial vari- ation (between-river) in diet was, in general, not pronounced. sufﬁcient specimens were collected to enable examination of ontogenetic changes in the diet of four species. interspeciﬁc and ontogenetic variation in diet were most strongly related to differences in body size and mouth gape, with larger species or age classes feeding on ﬁsh and large aquatic invert- ebrates. other gradients upon which dietary differences were arranged included gradients in detritivory and reliance on terrestrial invertebrates. signiﬁcant trophic separation was evident in the fauna despite aquatic invertebrates being the most important food item in most species. seven, and possibly eight, trophic groups were recognized. notable features of the trophic organization were the prevalence of omnivory and piscivory and relatively small representation by detritivores. planktivores were essentially absent. much of the observed trophic structure within the ﬁshes of cape york peninsula could be ascribed to the effects of phylogen- etic determinants of body size, morphology and foraging mode. the trophic structure within rivers of eastern cape york peninsula is com- pared to other aquatic systems in tropical northern australia. b. j. pusey1, a. h. arthington2, m. g. read2 1cooperative research centre for tropical rainforest research and

regulatory processes may be numerous, inter-re- lated and operating at several different levels or scales (schoener 1987; schlosser 1987). compe- tition and trophic segregation have been suggested to inﬂuence the structure of tropical stream ﬁsh communities, but support for this contention is far from unequivocal (knoppel 1970; zaret & rand 1971; lowe-mcconnell 1975; goulding 1980; angermeier & karr 1983; moyle & senanayake 1984; winemiller 1989). field studies of resource partitioning in some australian freshwater ﬁsh communities have revealed trophic segregation in- ﬂuenced by body size (bishop et al. 1980; pusey et al. 1995), phylogenetic origins (pusey & kennard 1995; pusey & bradshaw 1996), habitat structure (bishop & forbes 1991; arthington 1992; pusey et al. 1995; kennard 1995), seasonal variation in prey abundance (pusey & bradshaw 1996) or combi- nations of these factors. quantitative description of the diets of many australian freshwater ﬁshes, particularly those of northern australia, is limited (but see bishop et al. 1980; jeffree & williams 1908; hortle & pearson 1990; bishop & forbes 1991; pusey et al. 1995; kennard 1995). signiﬁcant biogeographic vari- ation across northern australia has been reported (allen 1989; bishop & forbes 1991) and extends to differences between ﬁsh faunas east and west of the great dividing range, which effectively bisects cape york peninsula of northern queensland (herbert et al. 1995). an understanding of ﬁsh die- 177 pusey et al. tary ecology is important for assessing the impact of disturbance (jeffree & williams 1980), but the trophic ecology of much of the fauna of cape york peninsula has not been quantiﬁed. the extent to which the ﬁndings of individual dietary studies conducted in one region can be applied to other northern australian regions containing dissimilar ﬁsh assemblages is unknown, placing an important limit on the degree to which aquatic systems of this wilderness area can be effectively managed in view of potential threats and increasing pressure from grazing, the introduction of exotic and indigenous ﬁshes, tourism, mining and an expanding crop- based agricultural industry. the aim of this study is to describe the diets of freshwater ﬁshes of three cape york rivers, to describe spatial (between river) and ontogenetic variation in diet and to place the observed species-speciﬁc variations in diet into a community trophic framework. fig. 1. map of the northern tip of cape york peninsula (cyp) showing the location of the three study rivers and sampling locations within each river (p). inset shows position of study area relative to continental australia. western tropics (wt) and alligator river region (arr) refer to two areas referred to in the text. 178 study area catchment the pascoe, stewart and normanby rivers are located east of the great dividing range on cape york peninsula, an extensive wilderness area of north queensland (fig. 1). the dividing range rarely exceeds 500 metres in elevation. the norm- anby river includes an extensive ﬂoodplain (laura plains) extending north to the stewart river catchment (galloway 1970). the three rivers are of low gradient over the spatial range of sites examined within each river (0.23%, 0.26% and 0.06% for the pascoe, stewart and nor- manby rivers, respectively). the area has a sub- humid to humid tropical (monsoonal) climate, with pronounced wet and dry seasons (gunn 1970), and the discharge regimes of the region’s rivers tend also to be seasonal, with highest ﬂows occurring from december to april (the wet season) and lowest ﬂows occurring between august to oc- tober. fish were collected from three sites located in the pascoe river drainage, four in the stewart river drainage and seven in the normanby river drainage. pascoe river sites p1 and p2 were predominantly shallow ((cid:176)40 cm deep), with a dominant substrate of sand and ﬁne gravel, and a stream width of 10 m and 30 m re- spectively. both sites had areas of fast ﬂow (–0.6 m ` s»1), but ﬂows less than 0.3 m ` s»1 were charac- teristic of the site. site 3 was 10 m wide, contained no discernible ﬂow and had a slightly coarser sub- strate with some cobbles and rocks. woody debris, leaf litter beds, undercut banks and macrophyte beds were present in all sites but were not abundant. stewart river four sites were located on the stewart river (s1– 4). sites s1–3 were located in the upper reaches of the river where the river was narrow (3–8 m) and shallow ((cid:176)50 cm depth). stream ﬂow was minimal ((cid:176)0.30 m ` s»1) and the substrate was dominated by sand and ﬁne gravel. with the exception of ex- tensive beds of leaf litter, other forms of in-stream cover were uncommon. site s4 consisted of a large isolated pool (surface area‰5300 m2) with a sandy substrate and abundant in-stream cover (woody debris, leaf litter, rootmasses and some aquatic macrophytes). normanby river seven sites were sampled. sites n1–3 were located in the ﬂoodplain reaches of the river below an elev- dry-season diet of freshwater ﬁshes eye and given a grade of between 0 (empty) and 1.0 (full). the contribution of each food category to the diet was estimated by an indirect volumetric method (hyslop 1980) where the items within each food category were lumped together and squashed to a uniform depth of 1 mm and the area covered taken to represent the volumetric contribution by that food classes were recognized (table 1). food category. twenty-two different statistical analysis the data set was ﬁrst subdivided on the basis of species and river (pascoe, stewart or normanby river). prior to multivariate analysis, the contri- bution of the unidentiﬁed fraction to the total diet was removed and the remaining data renormalized to total 100%. spatial variation in diet was exam- ined by comparing bray curtis dissimilarity scores generated by comparing the average diet of species from individual rivers. the remaining analyses were performed on data pooled across all rivers after examination of spatial variation revealed little spatial variation in diet (see below). sufﬁcient specimens of four species were collected to allow the diets of two separate age classes (0„ and 1„ table 1. dietary categories used in the quantiﬁcation of the diets of ﬁshes of cape york peninsula. letters in parentheses refer to codes used in tables 4

reaches of the normanby river (n4), the upper reaches of the laura river (n5) and the upper reaches of the east and west branches of the normanby river (n6 and 7). the river at sites n1–3 was wide (30–75 m) and maximum depths were greater than 4 m. little ﬂow was detectable, the substrate was dominated by mud and sand, and in-stream cover in the form of woody debris, leaf litter, undercut banks, rootmasses, aquatic macrophytes and submerged overhanging riparian vegetation was common. sites n4–7 were narrower (5–20 m), shallower (maximum depths of 0.9 to 1.8 m but commonly in the range of 0.35 to 0.5 m) and without any discernible ﬂow. the substrate was more diverse than at the downstream sites, containing gravels, cobbles and rocks; it was how- ever, still dominated by sand and ﬁne gravel. in- stream cover was absent except for abundant leaf litter and some woody debris. material and methods fish were collected in august 1990 (dry season) by a combination of electroﬁshing, gill- and seine- netting. fish were anesthetized (ms-222) and pre- served in 4% formalin within 1 hour of capture. standard length, body weight and mouth gape (see pusey & bradshaw 1996) were estimated in the lab- oratory or ﬁeld. the range in body length for each species is depicted in fig. 2. dietary analysis each stomach was placed under water in a watchglass and stomach fullness was estimated by pusey et al. and older [unpublished data]) to be examined. the standard lengths denoting the different age classes were; neosilurus hyrtlii and n. ater 150 mm, oxye- leotris lineolatus 150 mm and anguilla reinhardtii 200 mm. only data from ﬁsh with a stomach full- ness index of 0.20 or above were used in any stat- istical analysis in order to prevent bias in the esti- mation of the proportional contribution of various items. the average diet for each species and age class, where appropriate, was estimated and differences were examined by classiﬁcation and ordination. classiﬁcation, based on the bray curtis associ- ation matrix, was achieved using the ﬂexible upgma method available in patn (belbin 1995). the number of groups deﬁned by a classiﬁ- cation dendrogram is dependent on the level of similarity used to deﬁne group membership and the number of objects within each group. we chose a subjectively meaningful level that recognized seven distinct groups. group allocation at this level was then used in a discriminant functions analysis (spsstm) to test whether group member- ship could be predicted on the basis of length, weight or mouth gape. various combinations of log-transformed and untransformed predictor variables were used in the discriminant functions analysis, and the solutions displayed herein repre- table 2. freshwater ﬁshes examined and

the best dis- crimination. scaling ordination was achieved using semi-strong hy- brid multi-dimensional (sshmds, patn, belbin 1995) based on the species by spe- cies association matrix generated using the bray- curtis dissimilarity measure. simulation studies have shown this to be the most robust and least biased measure used for such investigations (faith et al. 1987). the ordination was based on three dimensions after examination of changes in the stress level with decreasing numbers of dimensions used in the ordination. the stress level generated for the ﬁnal three dimensional solution was 0.13. the ordination was then rotated to its most simple structure using the varimax procedure available in patn, and principal axis correlation analysis was then used to determine the existence of signiﬁcant vectors in ordination space for each of the 21 die- tary categories. the signiﬁcance of correlations be- tween species position in ordination and the pro- portional contribution of individual dietary items was assessed by reference to 100 monte carlo ran- domization runs. only correlations with a signiﬁ- cance level of p(cid:176)0.05 were further considered. results a total of 2514 ﬁsh from 30 species was collected during the study, of which most (80%) were col- lected by electroﬁshing. eighteen species of ﬁsh were recorded from the pascoe river, 15 from the dry-season diet of freshwater ﬁshes stewart river and 21 from the normanby river (table 2), and the diet of 10, 10 and 18 taxa (spe- cies and age classes) were examined for each river, respectively. melanotaenia splendida splendida was the most commonly collected species, being re- corded from all sites, and contributed 31.7% of the total number of ﬁsh collected by electroﬁshing. the ﬁve most abundant species; m. s. splendida, mogurnda mogurnda (23.7%), leiopotherapon unic- olor (9.8%), ambassis agrammus (6.3%) and neosi- lurus hyrtlii (5.0%) contributed over three quarters of the total number of ﬁsh collected by electro- ﬁshing. the next ﬁve most abundant species; gerr- es ﬁlamentosus, o. lineolatus, a. reinhardtii, n. ater and glossamia aprion (in decreasing order of abun- dance) contributed a further 14.6% of the total number of ﬁsh collected. thus, of the 25 species collected by electroﬁshing, 10 species contributed over 90% of the total catch. spatial variation in diet the majority of comparisons (10/17) of intraspec- iﬁc spatial variation in diet revealed little between- river differences in the diet (table 3). low dissimi- larity values ((cid:176)0.4) were observed for between- river comparisons of the diets of awaous acritosus and g. aprion, and in both cases, the dominant items in the diet did not vary between rivers. com- parison of the diets of m. s. splendida, l. unicolor, juvenile a. reinhardtii and m. mogurnda from dif- ferent rivers also revealed little differences in diet table 3. spatial variation (between-river) in diet for those species recorded from

and a. acritosus) consumed detritus and diatoms (table 4). group 2 ﬁshes (adult a. reinhardtii, g. aprion and juvenile o. lineolatus) consumed ﬁsh, shrimps, odonate and ephemeropteran larvae, and group 3 ﬁshes (adult o. lineolatus and a. midgelyi) mainly consumed ﬁsh. adult n. hyrtlii and g. au- reus were included in a fourth group characterized by a substantial contribution of trichopteran lar- vae to the diet (table 4). adult n. ater consumed substantial amounts of chironomid larvae and os- tracods, items which were much smaller than would be expected given its size, and thus was not grouped with adult n. hyrtlii and g. aureus at the level chosen. the largest group (group 5) contained 11 spe- cies, of which three were the juvenile age classes of taxa in other groups. this group of ﬁshes con- sumed a wide variety of prey, but chironomid, ephemeropteran and trichopteran larvae were the most important items. the ﬁnal two groups (6 and 7), each composed of two species, were dis- tinguished by the very high contribution of chiron- omid larvae (74%) to the diet of group 6 species, and the presence of ants and ﬁlamentous algae in the diet of the two rainbowﬁshes forming group 7. signiﬁcant between-group discrimination based upon differences in body size and mouth gape was achieved by discriminant functions analysis at level of grouping (c2‰52.02, p(cid:176)0.001, 62.5% successful discrimination, table 5). important dietary items for each of the classiﬁ- cation groups (table 4) were, with the exception of ﬁlamentous algae, also those items identiﬁed by principal axis correlation analysis as being import- ant in determining species position in ordination space. when the seven classiﬁcation groups were table 4. major dietary items for each of the groups deﬁned by

7. (scores of 0.39 to 0.52), and where differences did occur, they were most commonly due to one item being important in the diet of a species from one river but not in another. for example, while the diet of m. s. splendida was dominated by ants and ﬁlamentous algae, ephemeropteran nymphs com- prised 10% of the diet of this species in the norm- anby river but were essentially absent in the re- maining two rivers (table 3). similarly, trichopter- an larvae were twice as important in the diets of l. unicolor from the normanby river than in either the pascoe or stewart rivers. nevertheless, aquatic insect larvae were the dominant prey across all three rivers for this species. a similar pattern of one prey class being important in one river but not another was also observed for a. ag- rammus and juvenile n. hyrtlii. very high (–0.75) dissimilarity values were recorded for spatial com- parison in two species, juvenile n. ater and h. compressa. filamentous algae comprised almost one third of the diet of juvenile n. ater in the pascoe river but were competely absent from the diet of juveniles of the normanby river. one quar- ter of the diet of h. compressa from the stewart river consisted of hydracarina, which were absent from normanby river ﬁsh. in view of the small sample sizes for some of the comparisons shown in table 3 and the general similarity in diet of most of the between-river com- parisons, we consider that pooling data within spe- cies across rivers is valid. furthermore, where dif- ferences in diet were observed, these differences in- dicate the extent of variation in prey consumption within a species, and thus pooling across rivers is appropriate when examining general patterns of interspeciﬁc variation in diet and broad patterns of trophic structure.

it is evident that overlap between groups on vectors 1 and 2 exists only for groups 1, 4 and 5. however, when viewed in the ordination space deﬁned by vectors 1 and 3, overlap between these groups is much reduced as the detritivore group is displaced negatively on vector 3. when considered in all three dimensions, little overlap between groups is evident. thus, the ﬁshes included in this study may be divided into at least seven trophic groups, mem- bership of which is determined in large part by body size and mouth gape. it could be argued that an eighth group composed of kuhlia rupestris and t. chatereus also exists, given that both species are large bodied with large mouths and feed substan- tively on terrestrial invertebrates taken from the water’s surface. most of the species included in this analysis were between 25 and 125 mm in length (fig. 2), yet within this size range many species consumed dif- ferent prey (table 6, fig. 4). for example, small individuals of g. aprion, t. chatereus and k. ru- pestris were examined, but by virtue of their large mouth gape, their diet was more similar to larger species. similarly, the small mouth gapes of m. s. splendida, m. trifasciata, g. ﬁlamentosus and h. compressa constrained their diet to include only the smallest invertebrate prey. ordination and principal axis correlation analy- sis revealed that the diets of individual species as- sorted along several independent gradients (fig. 4). the most prominent gradients on vector 1, which explained the greatest amount of variance (42.8%), were those relating to prey size. the aver- age volumetric contribution of larger prey items (shrimps, odonate larvae and ﬁsh) was signiﬁcant- ly positively correlated with species arrayed on vec- tor 1. the diet of adult o. lineolatus was composed entirely of ﬁsh, and the diets a. midgelyi and g. aprion were characterized by similarly high pro- portional contributions by ﬁsh (50.0 and 30.2%, respectively) with the majority of the remainder being composed of shrimps (9.0 and 22.3%, respec- tively) and odonate larvae (13.0 and 9.4%, respec- 65.5 (10.4) 5.9 (1.7) 6.4 (0.6) 37.1 (7.9) 1.8 (1.1) 3.9 (1.0) 43.3 (4.6)

species was present in 35% and contributed 33% of the volume. unidentiﬁed ﬁsh remains were the most common item (38/55 specimens) and contributed 37% of the volume. neosilurus spp., h. compressa, l. unicolor and a. reinhardtii were also present but generally occurred in only a few individuals but where they did occur, they contributed 100% of that individual’s intake. fig. 4. ordination bi-plots

invertebrate prey, and signiﬁcant correlations with the pro- portional contribution by chironomid larvae and trichopteran larvae were detected (fig. 4). chiron- omid larvae were present in the diet of 21 of the 27 taxa examined and contributed more than 10% of the total diet in 11 species (table 6). chironom- id larvae were the dominant item in the diet of g. ﬁlamentosus (74%), redigobius bikolanus (42.5%), amniataba percoides (25.0%) and h. compressa (21.4%). these species also consumed ephmerop- teran nymphs and trichopteran larvae, in common with a large number of other species. the left-hand side of the ordination space depicted in fig. 4 was populated by generalized invertebrate feeders. species arrayed high on vector 2 consumed prey taken from the water’s surface and a signiﬁcant correlation between species arrayed on vector 2 and the volumetric contribution by formicidae was detected. ants contributed 12% and 11% to the diets of m. s. splendida and m. trifasciata, re- spectively, and 8.1% of the diet of t. chatereus. other terrestrial or surface insects were also pres- ent in the diet of t. chatereus (gerrids and large insects such as grasshoppers), but the most volu- metrically important dietary item was aquatic hemiptera (table 6). ants were not present in the diet of k. rupestris, but other prey taken from the water’s surface such as diptera adults (20.1%), ger- rids (7.9%) and orthoptera (2.0%) were present. fish and shrimps were the most important items in the diet of this species, but other small aquatic organisms were also present (table 6) and hence 184 dry-season diet of freshwater ﬁshes fig. 5. ontogenetic variation in diet for a. reinhardtii, n. ater, n. hyrtlii and o. lineolatus. the ﬁgures shown are simply those illustrated in fig. 4 but excluding all other species in order to simplify the emergent pattern. the position of k. rupestris in ordination space was intermediate on both vectors 1 and 2 (fig. 4). a signiﬁcant negative association arrayed on vector 3 was detected for detritus. ninety-ﬁve per- cent of the diet of nematolosa erebi and 29% of the diet of a. acritosus was identiﬁed as detritus. the dominant item in the diet of this latter species was diatom algae (33.5%) (table 6). shrimps and odonate nymphs, which were both positively ar- rayed on vector 1, and trichopteran larva, which was negatively arrayed on this vector, were all posi- tively correlated with species position arrayed on vector 3. thus, vector 3 forms a second gradient of dietary item size from small detrital and algal particles to larger aquatic invertebrates. ontogenetic shifts in prey consumption of the four species for which data were available, ontogenetic shifts in diet were clearly evident in the relative position of juvenile and adult samples in ordination space (fig. 5). when viewed in the space deﬁned by vectors 1 and 2, a common shift from left to right was evident for all four species, corresponding to a shift from small invertebrate prey such as trichopteran, ephemeropteran and chironomid larvae to larger invertebrates and ﬁsh. a different pattern was observed for the two ploto- sid catﬁshes in the space deﬁned by vectors 1 and 3. whereas juvenile n. ater and n. hyrtlii consume an almost identical array of prey (table 6), ontog- entic shifts in dietary composition were in opposite directions on vector 3. whereas n. hyrtlii tended to consume larger invertebrate prey such as shrimps and odonate larvae as they grew larger (hence an upward shift in ordination space), the diet of adult n. ater was characterized by increases in the contribution made by ostracods (5 to 17.3%), microplankton (0.8 to 6.1%), chironomid larvae (1.5 to 5.2%) and bivalve molluscs (0 to 21%). thus, to a large extent, the shift in diet as n. ater increased in length was towards smaller prey items. discussion although some spatial variation in diet was ob- served in this study, the overall extent of variation was not profound. moreover, given that dietary in- formation presented here is in general agreement with other published accounts of prey consump- tion for these species from elsewhere in australia (bishop et al. 1980; merrick & schmida 1984; hortle & pearson 1990; allen 1989; arthington 1992; pusey et al. 1995; kennard 1995), it appears that variation in dietary composition for many of the species included here is slight over even quite large spatial scales. it must be borne in mind that the present study was conducted over a small period of time (the mid dry season) and that tem- poral variation in diet may potentially alter this conclusion. kennard (1995), in a study of the trophic dynamics of isolated ﬂoodplain wetlands of the normanby river, monitored changes in ﬁsh diets over an 8-month period and found little tem- poral variation that could not also be related to ontogenetic change related to increases in body size. ontogenetic changes in diet related to increas- ing body size may overwhelm the detection of any potential temporal variation associated with ﬂuc- tuating prey abundance and availability. intraspeciﬁc size-related gradients in the degree of piscivory, reliance on large aquatic invertebrates and reliance on terrestrial insectivory have been re- 185 pusey et al. corded from studies of the trophic organization of stream ﬁshes (winemiller 1989; sheldon & meffe 1993; pusey et al. 1995). with the exception of the latter gradient, these patterns were also observed for a. reinhardti, o. lineolatus and n. hyrtlii in the present study. the failure to detect a size related gradient in terrestrial insectivory may have arisen because too few t. chatereus and k. rupestris were collected to allow an examination of ontogenetic variation in these species. ontogenetic changes in diet, especially towards the ingestion of larger prey and greater piscivory, appear common in fresh- water ﬁsh assemblages (winemiller 1989; piet 1998). adult n. ater also consumed larger prey (such as odonate nymphs and small bivalve molluscs) than did juveniles. however, it is notable that os- tracods become an important component in the diet of adult specimens, with the result being that the diets of adult n. ater and n. hyrtlii, unlike those of juveniles of these species, are dissimilar. both species are morphologically very similar ex- cept that n. ater has a smaller mouth gape at large size (this study) and possesses more and ﬁner gill rakers than does n. hyrtlii (allen 1989), a charac- teristic that may allow it to forage more effectively on very small prey such a benthic microplankton but not large aquatic invertebrates. the difference may allow the coexistence of these two species when in sympatry. about one third of the species (8 of 23) included in the present study were found to consume other ﬁshes as part of their diet (m. splendida was not included, as the small contribution by ﬁsh given in table 6 was due to the presence of ﬁsh eggs). at least three other species commonly found in the region (lates calcarifer, megalops cyprinoides and strongylura kreffti), but for which insufﬁcient specimens were collected to enable their inclusion in this analysis, are also known to be partly or pre- dominantly piscivorous (bishop et al. 1980; pusey et al. 1995; kennard 1995). matthews (1998) sug- gests, in an analysis of the ratio of predator to prey species in north american stream ﬁsh assem- blages, that there are usually about 3 prey species for every piscivore; somewhat higher than that re- ported here (¶2.4: 1 if piscivores consume all other species including the juvenile stages of other pisciv- ores, 1.4:1 if non-piscivores only are consumed, or 0.5: 1 if only those species identiﬁed from stomach contents are included). however, matthews (1998) was concerned with predator/prey ratios for local assemblages, not for assemblages pooled across large spatial scales as in the present study. in ad- dition, ﬁsh species were categorized as prey if they were of sufﬁciently small size to be ingested by pis- civores and not by whether they were actually de- 186 tected in another species’ diet. moreover, mat- thews (1998) classiﬁed a species as a piscivore only if ﬁsh were a ‘‘substantial’’ component of prey. these differences make valid comparison with streams of north america difﬁcult. bishop et al. (1980) report the presence of ﬁsh in the diet (–10% of diet comprised of ﬁsh) in 20 of the 33 freshwater species of the alligator river region of the northern territory, australia. eight species of a total of 23, within rainforest streams of northern queensland consumed ﬁsh and of these, three included ﬁsh as more than 10% of the diet (pusey et al. 1995). however, the latter example is an underestimate, given that the lower reaches of the two rivers studied were not extensively sampled and that piscivorous l. calcarifer, s. kreffti and m. cyprinoides are known to be present there (pusey & kennard 1996) but were not included in the analy- sis of pusey et al. (1995). thus, the proportional contribution of piscivores (ﬁsh –10% of the diet) to total species richness of cape york rivers (26%) is very similar to that determined for other north- ern australian systems (24.2% and 26% for alli- gator river region and wet tropics, respectively). pusey & kennard (1995) demonstrated that pisci- vory was signiﬁcantly more developed in northern australian ﬁshes than it was in the southern australian ﬁsh fauna (7.7%). a notable feature of the community trophic structure described here is the absence of an obli- gate herbivore group. previous literature accounts of the diet of many australian ﬁshes (merrick & schmida 1984) indicate that obligate herbivory is rare. of the 115 species for which dietary infor- mation is given by merrick & schmida (1984), only nine species from three families (mugilidae, terapontidae and hemirhamphidae) were classi- ﬁed as herbivores (some of which also consumed detritus), and it is perhaps signiﬁcant that of these, four species are not restricted to fresh waters. far more species (23) were listed as omnivores. bishop & forbes (1991) report that herbivory, and especially omnivory, are well represented trophic styles in the alligator river region rivers. simi- larly, nine of the 26 species studied in wet tropics rivers consumed plant matter, but in only one case (m. splendida, 58%) did the volumetric contri- bution from this source exceed 40% of the total diet (pusey et al. 1995). eight of the species in the present study were found to contain some veg- etable matter in the diet, although in no case did the contribution of this food source exceed 20%. most of the plant material observed in the diet of ﬁshes described here was ﬁlamentous algae, but none of the species examined appear to possess morphological adaptations that would allow a grazing or scraping feeding mode commonly ob- served in other tropical and temperate stream ﬁsh assemblages (power et al. 1985; matthews et al. 1987). this is perhaps not surprising for river sys- tems of low gradient and a dominant substrate of sand and ﬁne gravel, conditions unconducive to the development of plentiful periphyton. adap- tations for grazing on attached algae do not ap- pear to have evolved in the australian ﬁsh fauna to any great extent or to have persisted in time if they ever did exist. regional differences the apparent paucity of obligate herbivory in australian ﬁshes is in contrast to fresh waters else- where in the world (knoppel 1970; lowe-mccon- nell 1975; goulding 1980; matthews et al. 1987; winemiller 1990). however, the results presented here indicate that herbivory, although not necess- arily obligate herbivory, may be more common than has been suggested previously for australian inland ﬁshes. pusey & kennard (1995) noted that herbivory and omnivory were more common in ﬁsh species from northern australia than southern temperate australia and suggested that this pat- tern may reﬂect in pro- ductivity, but also noted that differences in evol- utionary origin of these two faunas (mcdowall 1981; allen 1989) may confound this interpreta- tion. further evidence for relatively increased her- bivory in northern australian ﬁshes is provided by geographical differences in diet of species (and subspecies) within the rainbowﬁsh genus mel- anotaenia. taxa present in the alligator river re- gion of northern australia (m. nigrans and m. splendida inornata) consume signiﬁcant amounts of aquatic plant material (17 and 29% respectively) (bishop et al. 1980) as does m. sp. splendida from northern queensland (19–35%) (this study, pusey et al. 1995). melanotaenia duboulayi from south- eastern queensland and m. ﬂuviatilus from the murray-darling river system of southern austra- lia consume less aquatic plant material (5%-10% and 11% respectively) (arthington 1992; arthing- ton & marshall 1993; hume et al. 1983, respec- tively). detritivory is a common trophic strategy in many freshwater ﬁsh assemblages (sheldon & mef- fe 1993; matthews 1998). detrivores may dominate assemblages with respect to species richness (fel- ley & felley 1987) or abundance (pusey et al. 1998) and detrivory may become more common or im- portant during periods of resource limitation (goulding 1980; felley & felley 1987). coates (1993) suggested that true detritivory is lacking in australian freshwater ﬁshes and the results pre- sented here indicate that, within the pascoe, ste- wart and normanby rivers, n. erebi is the only obligate detrivore. elsewhere, this species has been shown to consume microcrustacea and microalgae dry-season diet of freshwater ﬁshes also (bishop et al. 1980). elsewhere in northern australia, the consumption of detritus is more strongly expressed. for example, bishop et al. (1980) report that 60% of species examined con- tained detritus in the diet but that volumetric con- tributions greater than 20% of the total were limited to only 4 species (12% of the species). simi- larly, the ﬁsh assemblage of wet tropics streams contained 11 species out of a total of 26 which consumed some detritus but only four species con- sumed more than 20% of the diet from this source (pusey et al. 1995). none of the species included in this study could be considered a planktivore. the great majority of ﬁshes in this study fed pre- dominantly on aquatic invertebrate larvae, as been previously noted for the australasian ichthyofauna as a whole (coates 1993). despite this, substantial trophic separation was evident when interspeciﬁc dietary differences were viewed in three-dimen- sional ordination space and apparently based, to a signiﬁcant degree, on interspeciﬁc differences in body size and mouth gape. further segregation based on interspeciﬁc variation in vertical distri- bution of ﬁsh and of foraging mode has been de- scribed for many of the species discussed here (kennard 1995). m. s. splendida, a. macleayi and c. stercusmuscarum occur most frequently in the upper water column, g. aprion, l. unicolor and a. percoides in the middle and lower water column, and g. aureus, r. bikolanus, o. lineolatus and a. reinhardtii most frequently in the lower water col- umn or associated with the substrate (kennard 1995). porochilus rendahli, n. ater and n. hyrtlii are also benthic species (pusey, unpublished data). spatial segregation on other habitat axes is also possible. the two rainbowﬁshes, m. splendida and m. trifasciata, although sympatric at the reach level at site 2 in the pascoe river, segregated on the basis of water velocity. m. trifasciata was only collected from areas with ﬂows greater than 0.5 m ` s»1, velocities avoided by m. splendida. this difference may explain the presence of simuliid lar- vae in the diet of the former but not the latter spe- cies. interspeciﬁc partitioning of habitat resources is common in freshwater ﬁsh assemblages and may be the major means by which species reduce the potential for competition (ross 1986). the ﬁsh assemblage studied here is notable for the low level of within-genera species diversity and only three genera, melanotaenia, ambassis and neosilurus contain more than one species. this fea- ture seems to be common for many eastern ﬂowing rivers in queensland (pusey et al. 1993; herbert et al. 1995; pusey et al. 1995; pusey & kennard 1996). the average species richness per genus for 25 from cape york peninsula queensland rivers, south to the border with new south wales, is 187 pusey et al. 1.34”0.04 (se) (pusey, unpublished data). thus, much of the dietary segregation observed for the pascoe, stewart and normanby river ﬁshes prob- ably has little to do with contemporary ecological interactions and more to do with historical and phylogenetic factors. sheldon & meffe (1993) noted a similar taxonomic basis for trophic segre- gation in stream ﬁsh assemblages of the southeast- ern united states. resource segregation based on phylogenetic differences is probably related to evolutionary differences in body morphology, which constrain how and where a predator forages or what size prey it may ingest. diversity at higher levels of taxonomy (i.e. genus or family) usually equates to diversity of morpho- logical forms (foote 1997) and, as a consequence, assemblages with low within-genus diversity but greater diversity at higher taxonomic levels are likely to demonstrate substantial trophic segre- gation. it is interesting therefore to compare the diets of species within families, which should be more morphologically similar to one another than to species from other families. two families, the plotosidae and the gobiidae (both the gobiinae and the eleotridinae), were sufﬁciently speciose in the present study to allow this. as has been dis- cussed above, differences in the diets of adult n. ater and n. hyrtlii appear related to morphological differences in mouth size, gill raker length and number. however, porochilus rendahli, juvenile n. hyrtlii and n. ater all consumed a similar array of prey, probably as a consequence of being con- strained by small body size and mouth gape. the gobiidae, for which data were available for six spe- cies (seven taxa given that o. lineolatus was divided into two age classes), was represented in all but one of the seven recognized trophic categories (absent from group 7). each species was from a unique genus, thus resource segregation in this group may also have a strong evolutionary component. die- tary group 5 (small aquatic invertebrates) con- tained two gobiids, one species from the gobiinae and the other from the eleotridinae. although al- located to the same trophic group, these two spe- cies differ greatly in morphology and microhabitat use. redigobius bikolanus is a diminutive benthic species (fig. 2) and consequently consumes mostly chironomid larvae, whereas m. mogurnda is larger, more often associated with woody debris, root- masses and aquatic macrophytes (merrick & schmida 1984), and consumes a wider array of larger prey (table 6). the habitat difference be- tween these two gobiids is typical of subfamilial differences in microhabitat use in australian gobi- ids (see data in merrich and schmida 1984). within each of these two families (gobies and cat- ﬁshes), interspeciﬁc dietary differences in the pres- 188 ent study appear to have a strong taxonomic basis except for within the small age classes. this sup- ports the suggestion that the overall basis for trophic segregation in these rivers is strongly re- lated to pylogenetic differences of the assemblage members and that this effects is visible at the fam- ilial, generic and species level. this study has revealed that, over all species, benthic invertebrates contribute greatest to the diet of cape york peninsula ﬁshes, in common with other stream and river systems throughout the world (matthews 1998). signiﬁcant trophic separ- ation was evident within the fauna despite this re- liance on aquatic benthos. seven trophic groups were recognized by classiﬁcation for the total fauna of 23 species. an eighth group containing two species that fed largely on large terrestrial in- vertebrates and upper water column insects was recognized by ordination analysis. notable fea- tures of the trophic organization were the preva- lence of omnivory and piscivory, relatively small representation by detrivores and absence of plank- tivores. much of the observed trophic structure within the ﬁshes of cape york peninsula could be attributed to the effects of phylogenetic determi- nants of body size, morphology and foraging mode. resumen 1. al comienzo de la estacio´n monzo´nica seca, muestreamos ensamblajes de peces de tres rı´os de la penı´nsula de cabo york (australia) y cuantiﬁcamos la dieta de 23 especies. la variacio´n espacial en la dieta entre rı´os no fue´ pronunciada. 2. colectamos peces en nu´meros suﬁcientes como para exami- nar cambios ontogene´ticos en la dieta de cuatro especies. las variaciones interespecı´ﬁcas y ontogene´ticas en la dieta estuvie- ron relacionadas con diferencias en el taman˜o del cuerpo y en la apertura de la boca, de manera que los individuos, o las clases de edades mayores, se alimentaron de peces o de los in- vertebrados acua´ticos de mayor taman˜o. otros gradientes de diferenciacio´n alimenticia incluyeron detritivorı´a o invertebra- dos acua´ticos. 3. la separacio´n tro´ﬁca es evidente a pesar de que los inverte- brados acua´ticos fueron los ma´s abundantes en la dieta de la mayorı´a de las especies. reconocimos siete grupos tro´ﬁcos o quiza´, ocho. algunas caracterı´sticas notables de la organizacio´n tro´ﬁca son la prevalencia de la omnivorı´a y la piscivorı´a, la escasa representacio´n de los detritı´voros y la ausencia de plantı´- voros. 4. gran parte de estructura tro´ﬁca observada entre los peces de la penı´nsula de cabo york se podrı´a adscribir a los efectos de determinantes ﬁlogene´ticos tales como taman˜o corporal, la morfologı´a y modo de alimentarse. finalmente, comparamos tambie´n la estructura tro´ﬁca de los rı´os al este de la penı´nsula con otros sistemas acua´ticos tropicales del norte de
