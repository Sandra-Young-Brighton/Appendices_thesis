(age-0, 1 and 2, and 3+), was quantiﬁed from recaptured, individually tagged brown_trout and related to season, stream reach, relative abundance, initial length and movement to examine factors inﬂuencing growth in length in three streams in the midwestern united states. total variation in growth was almost ﬁve times greater for age-0 than for age-3+ trout. individual trout accounted for about 13% of total variation in age-0 growth, season about 57%, and trout initial length and relative abundance combined another 2%. the 2006 age-0 cohort had the fastest growth rates in their second spring and summer (2007) and slowest growth in their ﬁrst winter (2006–2007). about 53% of total growth variation of age-1 and age-2 trout was accounted for by individual trout, season, initial length and stream reach. predicted growth rates indicated strong effects of season and initial length. a signiﬁcant interaction between these two factors indicated that, although smaller trout grew faster than larger trout, this length effect was most pronounced in spring and summer. about 35% of total growth variation of age-3+ trout was accounted for by individual trout and season. together, season and individual trout characteristics were identiﬁed as the most important factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth in these streams. key words: brown_trout; growth; coldwater streams; seasonal growth; movement introduction growth has important ecological and management implications for salmonid populations. fast growth can result in a larger body size that allows adults to produce more young (helfman et al. 1997; harwood et al. 2002), permits individuals to feed on a wider range in prey sizes (montori et al. 2006) and may increase survival, all of which increase organism ﬁt- ness (sogard 1997; kaspersson & höjesjö 2009). from a management perspective, populations with poor growth may have low recreational angling value, whereas populations with good growth may provide more ﬁsh of a larger size that anglers prefer. occasionally, large ﬁsh size may instead be the result of slower growth, because of greater longevity, a pattern often associated with latitudinal factors such as temperature (braaten & guy 2002; munch & sali- nas 2009). the plethora of potential factors inﬂuenc- ing growth, such as nutrients, genetics and water temperature (helfman et al. 1997), requires an identi- ﬁcation of primary factors for a speciﬁc region or population to aid management efforts and to better understand and forecast effects of changing land use or climate (elliott 2009; xu et al. 2010). brown_trout growth has been associated with a wide range of factors across their range (e.g., logez & pont 2011), but several have been repeatedly sug- gested: intra-speciﬁc density, social dominance, water temperature, physical habitat and movement. intra- speciﬁc density, as an indicator of competition, has correspondence: d. j. dieterman, minnesota department of natural resources,

been found to be negatively associated with growth in many brown_trout populations (e.g., bohlin et al. 2002; lobón-cerviá 2005; kaspersson & höjesjö 2009). competitive interactions are often manifested through social dominance with larger brown_trout exhibiting more aggressive behaviours toward smaller individuals, which enable larger ﬁsh to gain access to more resources and grow faster (fausch 1984; alanärä et al. 2001). water temperature is universally recognised as a modiﬁer of growth through its funda- mental effect on metabolism (elliott 1994). water temperature effects on growth have been directly assessed with bioenergetics models (jensen et al. 2000; elliott 2009) or indirectly via proxy variables, such as different stream reaches) or temporal periods (e.g., seasons or years) characterised by different regimes (parra et al. 2009). spatial and temporal differences in other habitat conditions, such as pool depth and habitat complexity, have also been suggested to inﬂuence trout growth (greenberg & giller 2001; lobón- cerviá 2005). finally, that move more may demonstrate faster growth than sedentary individuals (jonsson 1985; forseth et al. 1999). mobile individuals may ﬁnd more energetically prof- itable stream locations with more abundant food, more optimal temperature regimes or locations that minimise energy expenditure. individual locations thermal spatial (e.g., trout studies to examine the importance of these factors for brown_trout growth have not been conducted in the 62,000 km2 driftless area of the upper midwestern united states, so named because it was bypassed by the last glacial epoch (waters 1977). karst geology of the driftless area ensures considerable groundwater ﬂow from springs, resulting in more stable baseﬂow hydrology and thermal regimes than other midwestern streams (gebert & krug 2007). these hydro-geologic features support many recreationally important brown_trout ﬁsheries and led local biologists to theorise that brown_trout are able to continue growing across all seasons (thorn et al. 1997). however, the lack of growth information hinders trout management and makes it difﬁcult to predict effects of changing condi- tions, such as climate or land use. the goal of our study was to evaluate several factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth. to do this, we developed models between observed growth rates of brown_trout and some of the primary factors identiﬁed elsewhere to assess their effects in this region. our ﬁrst objective was to quantify the amount of total variation present in the growth rate observations, and our second objec- tive was to determine how much of this total variation could be accounted for by individual trout, stream reach, season-year, relative abundance, ﬁsh size and movement in three driftless area streams of the upper midwestern united states. 484 methods study was our conducted in three wadeable coldwater streams in the upper midwestern state of minnesota, usa: coolridge, hemmingway and pine creeks (study area midpoint at approximately 43° 51′ n, 91° 52′ w; elevation, 265 m a.s.l.). coolridge and hemmingway creeks are tributaries to pine creek. the entire study area represented about 5.5 km of continuous lotic habitat (table 1), except for one sec- tion on hemmingway creek that was not sampled because of landowner concerns. other ﬁshes present in the study area included brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis, white sucker catostomus commersonii, brook stickleback culaea inconstans, mottled sculpin cottus bairdii and slimy sculpin cottus cognatus. to determine whether distinct stream reaches were present, geomorphic, instream habitat and thermal features were measured following standard methods (bain & stevenson 1999; mndnr 2007). these sur- veys identiﬁed six hydro-geomorphically similar reaches across the three streams. reaches were char- acterised by differences in water temperature and physical habitat (table 1). mean wetted widths dur- ing summer baseﬂow were 3.1 m for coolridge creek, 4.5 m for hemmingway creek and 10.4 m for pine creek. temperature loggers were placed in all six reaches at the beginning of the study, but all were lost during ﬂooding in 2007, and some replace- ments were lost again during 2008 ﬂooding. given available temperature data, pine creek was the warm- est and deepest reach and had the most cover (i.e., greatest per cent of surface area composed of water depths > 60 cm, instream rock, overhead bank cover and instream wood). lower hemmingway creek was the second warmest and deepest reach. reaches on coolridge creek were cooler in summer and shal- lower than either pine or lower hemmingway. upper hemmingway had cooler temperatures also but tended to have more cover and depth than coolridge creek reaches (table 1). we used stream reach in our analyses as a surrogate measure of differences in habitat and water temperature, in part, because so many temperature loggers were lost. if stream reach was signiﬁcantly related to growth, then we might reasonably assume that some aspect of each stream reach, such as thermal regime or pool depth, could inﬂuence brown_trout growth. to examine seasonal and year effects on growth, brown_trout were captured and recaptured from sep- tember 2006 to september 2008 with electroﬁshing gear (pulsed dc; 1-3 a) at each of four times per year. each time approximated the transition period between fall, winter, spring and summer seasons: early september, late november, mid-march and late may. most sampling was completed within one or table 1.

beginning in late june. integrated transponder (pit) 2 weeks. however, march 2007 sampling was inter- rupted by substantial ﬂooding. trout were collected with a backpack electroﬁsher in upper hemmingway and all three coolridge reaches. a barge electroshoc- ker with two anodes was used in lower hemming- way and with three anodes in pine creek, because these reaches were wider and deeper. one upstream electroﬁshing pass was made through each pool, which was individually identiﬁed and numbered throughout each stream reach, and no block nets were used. a passive tag (12.45 mm, 134.2 khz) was inserted into trout to individually identify each ﬁsh. upon capture, brown_trout were anaesthetised (ms-222), measured (mm, total length [tl]), had their adipose ﬁn clipped as a secondary mark and tagged. most trout were tagged in the body cavity in september 2006 and in march– april 2007. a small number of randomly selected trout had a pit tag inserted into their dorsal muscula- ture in march–april 2007 to evaluate tag loss. more speciﬁc information on tags, tag loss and scanning equipment can be found in die- terman & hoxmeier (2009). recaptured trout were checked for the presence of a pit tag and remea- sured. the individual pool and reach of recapture were also recorded. tagging methods, to identify more speciﬁc life stages inﬂuenced by each factor, trout were placed into groups based on lengths that approximated three age groups: age-0, age-1 and -2 and age-3+. by analysing these age groups independently, we sought to identify any ontogenetic transitions in the relative importance of factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth. age-0 trout ﬁrst became fully susceptible to capture and were deemed large enough to be tagged (120 mm tl) in early september. these trout were distinguished from older trout by obvious breaks in length/frequency his- tograms. these length breaks were 175 mm tl in pine creek and 150 mm tl in the other study reaches in september 2006. age-0 brown_trout were too small to be captured and tagged during their ﬁrst spring and summer in 2006, so growth from this cohort was evaluated in their second spring (i.e., march–may 2007) and second summer (may–august 2007), when these ﬁsh were age 1. this allowed a more complete assessment of seasonal growth for this cohort. thus, growth estimates for age-0 trout repre- sent growth during their ﬁrst autumn, ﬁrst winter, and second spring and summer seasons. we did not estimate growth between hatch and early september. finally, age-0 growth was only estimated for the 2006 cohort because the 2007 cohort was almost nonexistent because of spring and summer ﬂooding in that year. growth of age-1 and age-2 trout was examined as a group because these ﬁsh support the recreational ﬁshery, comprise the bulk of the adult population and represent sizes most often caught by anglers. age-1 trout were distinguished from age-0 trout by length-frequency breaks as described above. age-2 trout were distinguished from age-3+ at a length of 305 mm tl because this length approxi- mates the average back-calculated length at age 3 for brown_trout in southeast minnesota (dieterman et al. 2004). also, many angling regulations in southeast minnesota use this length break as well (e.g., 12–16 inch protected slot regulation), so inferences made for trout smaller (i.e., age-1 and age-2 trout) and 485 douglas j. dieterman et al. larger than 305 mm (i.e., age-3 + trout) may have direct management implications. we used linear mixed effects models ﬁt by maximum likelihood, with a random effect for indi- vidual trout, to evaluate the effects of season-year, initial stream reach, relative abundance of all trout, initial length and distance moved on growth of indi- vidual brown_trout. we characterised growth as abso- lute growth rate, the change in length between two time periods (each seasonal interval) per unit time (i. e., mm tl/d in this study) (isely & grabowski 2007). for example, growth rate over the fall 2006 seasonal interval was the difference between the length in september and the subsequent november. to ensure that we correctly attributed growth rate to only one season, we only included data for ﬁsh that were captured and recaptured before and after each season. thus, a ﬁsh caught in september 2006, not captured in november 2006, but caught in march 2007 and may 2007 only had data for the spring 2007 season included in the model. we did not parti- tion growth rate among multiple seasons if a ﬁsh was not caught between them. also, because ﬁsh and sea- son constituted our statistical replicates, individual ﬁsh may have contributed more than one data point if they were captured in more than one season. multiple recaptures of the same ﬁsh provided the random effect in our models (i.e., the estimate of the effect of individual ﬁsh), which allowed us to infer the impor- tance of traits of individual trout (e.g., sex, genetics) on growth rates. the total growth rate variance we ﬁrst ﬁt an intercept-only model to quantify the amount of total variation present in the growth rate data for each age group. we then ﬁt and tested models with various combinations of independent variables to determine their importance and how much of they accounted for. variance accounted for was estimated by comparing the amount of total variation in the initial intercept-only model to the variation explained in a subsequent model with independent variables. for example, if the intercept-only model yielded a total variance estimate of 0.12 and a subsequent model with the intercept and stream reach reduced the variance estimate to 0.02, then the initial total variance estimate was reduced by 83% (1   [0.02/ 0.12]), suggesting that stream reach accounted for 83% of the total variance in our growth rate data. we always included the random effect for each indi- vidual trout (i.e., pit tag number) in our models to determine how much of the total variation was attrib- uted to individuals. all models were ﬁt and tested with aicc using r software (crawley 2007). we considered differences in aicc values greater than two to indicate support for a difference between models. 486 initial stream reach was the reach individual brown_trout was captured in prior to their change in growth. initial reach represented an indirect measure of abi- otic factors that included temperature and physical habitat, based on differences in spatial location, as opposed to direct measures of these variables. to estimate effects of trout density, we calculated the relative abundance (number of trout/m2) of all trout as the total number of trout (all sizes of both brook_trout and brown_trout) captured on the ﬁrst electroﬁshing pass divided by the surface area of each stream reach. surface area was determined from the total length of each stream reach and the mean wetted width measured during geomorphic and instream habitat surveys. by using all trout of both species present, we attempted to estimate exploitative competition for the total food supply, as opposed to interference competition for a speciﬁc drift-feeding site that would be structured more by size. initial trout length was tested as an index of social dominance and may represent a better measure of interference competition. initial length was the total length of each brown_trout prior to its change in growth. distance moved was the linear distance along the stream between initial capture and subsequent recap- ture. each pool was individually numbered, so that the pool of capture and recapture could be recorded. distances between the midpoints of all pools were measured and used to determine distance moved by individual ﬁsh. results age-0 brown_trout there were 257 growth observations from a total of 162 individual age-0 brown_trout captured at the beginning and end of a speciﬁc season. age-0 trout tagged at the beginning of this study in september 2006 averaged 141 mm (sd = 18.11). median values of observed growth rates were highest in spring 2007, but also most variable (fig. 1). a few individual brown_trout either did not grow or lost length (i.e., growth rates  0.0) in fall, and most trout grew slowly in winter (fig. 1). conversely, although median observed growth was slow in fall 2006, some individuals still grew fast or faster than the median value for growth during spring or summer (fig. 1). most age-0 brown_trout (65% of observa- tions) were recaptured in the same pool in which they were initially captured and released. the most parsimonious model of factors related to growth rates of age-0 brown_trout included season, individual trout (i.e., pit tag number random effect), initial length and trout relative abundance. the total (a) 0.8

spring and summer (i.e., these trout were age-1 in spring and summer 2007). tagged at the ﬁnal model variance in growth rate was 0.0208 (table 2). vari- (aicc =  499.8) was ance of 0.0058, a 72% reduction from the total variance. nei- ther addition of stream reach nor trout movement improved this ﬁnal model. individual trout accounted for about 11% of the variance, season 59%, and ini- tial length (an attribute of individual trout) and rela- tive abundance about 2% in this ﬁnal model. age-0 brown_trout growth rates were fastest in spring and summer 2007. fall 2006 growth rates intercept = 0.148; were set as the baseline (i.e., table 2). thus, interpretation of model effects (i.e., model estimates) for other seasons is relative to growth rates in fall 2006. the smaller and negative factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth estimate for the effect of winter 2006–2007 ( 0.022) indicated that growth rates were slower in winter than in fall 2006. conversely, spring and summer model estimates were higher than those in fall 2006, indicat- ing faster growth in those seasons. although season had the strongest effect on growth rates of age-0 trout, the ﬁnal model also included terms for initial length and relative abundance. initial length and relative abundance had negative model estimates, which indicated that growth rates declined as trout initial length increased and as relative abun- dance increased (table 2). calculation of predicted growth rates based on the ﬁnal model allowed an integrated assessment of season, length and relative abundance factors (fig. 2). predicted growth rates reiterated the dominant effect of season. for example, predicted growth rates in spring for the in reaches with the highest largest age-0 trout density (0.30 mm·d  1) were greater than pre- dicted growth rates in fall 2006 for the smallest in reaches with the lowest density age-0 trout (0.19 mm·d  1). initial age-1 and age-2 brown_trout a total of 420 individual age-1 or age-2 brown_trout contributed 1041 seasonal growth rate observations. median observed growth rates were highest in spring in both years and lowest in winter (fig. 1). however, there was considerable variability in growth rates among individual trout within each season (fig. 1). at least a few individuals did not grow or shrunk in length in every season except spring 2008. similar to age-0, few age-1 and age-2 brown_trout were recap- tured in a different pool between sampling occasions. seventy-two per cent of age-1 and age-2 trout were recaptured in the same pool, and 81% were recap- tured within 50 m of the pool in which they were ini- tially caught. the best model identiﬁed three factors associated with growth rates of age-1 and age-2 brown_trout, in addition to the random effect for individual trout: sea- son, initial length and stream reach. this ﬁnal model (aicc =  2221.0) reduced total variance from 0.011 to 0.0052, a 53% reduction (table 2). variability in growth rates attributed to individual trout accounted for 17% of the variance. predicted growth rates from our ﬁnal model esti- mates (table 2) again illustrated the strong effect of season and initial length (fig. 3). predicted growth rates were fastest in spring and summer and for the smallest trout. there was an interaction between these two factors, which showed that, although smal- ler trout grew faster than larger trout in all seasons, the effect of size was most pronounced in spring and summer (i.e., a steeper slope). 487 douglas j. dieterman et al. table 2. final models for

the median growth rate for all age-0 trout in spring 2007 (fig. 1). also, total variation in growth rates for age-0 trout was 0.0208, but was only 0.0043 for age-3+ trout (table 2). thus, there was almost ﬁve times as much total variation in growth rates of age-0 trout as com- pared to age-3+ trout. factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth the best model of factors predicting growth rates of age-3+ trout only included terms for season-year and individual trout (table 2). season-year and indi- vidual trout effects reduced total variance from 0.0043 to 0.0028, a 35% reduction. individual trout accounted for 27% of this variation, and season-year, the remaining 8%. model estimates (table 2) and predicted growth rates (fig. 4) indicated fastest growth rates in spring 2007, summer 2007 and spring 2008 and slowest growth rates in fall 2006 and winter 2007–2008. there appeared to be a slight year effect, as observed and predicted growth rates were faster in summer and fall of 2007 than in these seasons in the respective years they were sampled (i.e., fall 2006, summer 2008) (figs 1 and 4). there were seven observations where the ﬁnal model substantially underestimated observed growth rates. five of these observations were for ﬁve large trout (341–359 mm tl) that grew very fast in summer 2007, and the other two observa- tions were from two of these same ﬁsh that grew very fast in spring 2007 (see dots in fig. 1). discussion individual the primary goal of this study was to assess the importance of trout characteristics and selected biotic and environmental factors on growth rates of all sizes and ages of brown_trout in three streams of the upper midwestern united states. sea- sonal effects were examined in particular, because of a prevailing belief that the primarily groundwater-fed streams in this area facilitate continuous growth throughout the year, especially in reaches with the most groundwater. we found increasing importance ) 1 – d m m · ( e t t a r h w o r

line references no growth. of individual trout characteristics as trout got older and larger, noted a pervasive inﬂuence of season on growth rates and found that factors commonly found to be important for brown_trout growth in other regions had only a modest inﬂuence in these streams. individual trout accounted for increasing amounts of variation as trout got older and larger (13% for age- 0, 17% for age-1 and 2, 27% for age-3+). we have not found many other comparative studies that speciﬁ- cally quantify this source of variation in a similar manner (i.e., with a random effect for individual trout, or possibly a repeated measures effect), because they either focused on population-level mean growth esti- mates (e.g., jensen 1990; nicola & almodóvar 2004) or did not speciﬁcally account for individual ﬁsh in their analyses (e.g., carlson et al. 2007). neverthe- less, some studies have reported large variability in growth rates among individual trout (greenberg & giller 2001; acolas et al. 2007), as well as other life history traits (cucherousset et al. 2005) indicating the importance of quantifying this source of variation. initial length was the only characteristic of individual trout we examined in this study, and it accounted for some of the variation in our ﬁnal models (although it was not signiﬁcant in our model for the age-3+ trout, the ontogenetic group with the largest amount of growth variation attributed to individual trout). other unmeasured characteristics of individual trout, such as genetics, sex or possibly age or size at maturity, may explain some of this individual-level variation. for example, serbezov et al. (2010) found that genetic heritability accounted for 16–31% of differences in length-at-age estimates among individual brown_trout. future studies should assess individual trout charac- teristics including sex and age at maturity to quantify their inﬂuence on growth. 490 the fast growth in spring and summer observed in this study has been observed in other brown_trout populations, and a variety of factors have been sug- gested to explain these patterns. fastest growth in spring and early summer seasons has been found in brown_trout populations in norway (jensen 1990), england (elliott 2009), eastern north america (carl- son et al. 2007) and spain (lobón-cerviá 2003). growth in fall and winter was much slower or nonex- istent in most of these populations. seasonal changes in food availability, water temperature, photoperiod and stream ﬂow have all been suggested as possible explanations for these patterns (beouf & le bail 1999; nicola & almodóvar 2004; carlson et al. 2007; elliott 2009). although season seems like an obvious factor, ver- ifying the presence of seasonal patterns was still important for driftless area streams of the upper midwest for multiple reasons. first, driftless area streams are heavily inﬂuenced by groundwater springs and seeps, which often result in more stable thermal regimes than streams governed by surface run-off or mixed water sources (gordon et al. 2004). stable thermal regimes may moderate growth differ- ences among seasons, resulting in more continuous growth throughout the year (nicola & almodóvar 2004); thus, whether growth varied seasonally or not was unknown, as was the importance of seasonal changes to overall growth rates of brown_trout. sea- sonal changes accounted for the most variation in growth for the smallest and youngest trout (about indicating a strong inﬂuence on this group. 57%), second, the presence of seasonal growth patterns allowed us to identify the time periods of fastest growth, spring and summer. this information should be used to focus future research efforts to these time periods to better elucidate causal mechanisms, such as food availability or water temperature, as primary modiﬁers of growth. loss of temperature loggers in this study precluded us from a more direct assess- ment of water temperature, but future research should strive to obtain such data. third, our results help tar- get the time periods when growth may be most sus- ceptible to changing conditions, such as climate or land use. changing conditions may have a dispropor- tionately stronger inﬂuence on the smallest and youn- gest trout because of the greater variation accounted for by season for this group. our results also suggested some minor differences in seasonal growth among years. year-to-year differ- ences in brown_trout growth have been found to be substantial in other populations (newman & waters 1989; lobón-cerviá 2005). for example, differences among years accounted for at least half of the varia- tion in average fork length of brown_trout in streams in california (jenkins et al. 1999). in one instance in that study, age-0 brown_trout were about 30 mm longer in 1 year than in another. in our study, growth rates tended to be higher in spring, summer and fall in 2007 than in these same seasons in other years. our study area was subjected to extreme ﬂooding in march and august 2007 (national weather service 2007). increased stream ﬂows have been suggested to increase brown_trout growth through greater avail- ability of drifting foods and increased trout feeding (lagarrigue et al. 2002; carlson et al. 2007) and may explain the increased growth rate we observed in 2007. initial the minor importance of length, stream reach, trout relative abundance and movement on growth was somewhat surprising, but may be par- tially explained by the productivity of driftless area streams in southeast minnesota. trout relative abun- dance, as an index to density, and initial length, as a surrogate measure of social dominance, were both expected to represent competitive interactions. where food or space is limiting, growth rates are expected to be slower where trout density is highest and the largest trout within an age group should grow fastest (alanärä et al. 2001; lobón-cerviá 2005). a nega- tive relationship between growth rates and trout rela- tive abundance was observed in this study, but only for age-0 trout. for initial length, the relationship was the opposite of what was expected. we found that larger trout were predicted to grow slower than smal- ler trout, offering little support for the presence of social dominance hierarchies in our study streams. initial length was only an important modiﬁer of growth for the two youngest age groups in this study, age-0 and age-1 and age-2. based on the amount of variation accounted for, and the magnitude of their predicted effects, neither trout relative abundance nor initial length appeared to be large modiﬁers of growth, possibly indicating that food or space was not limiting in these streams. driftless area streams are some of the most productive streams in the world, likely because of their largely agricultural watersheds and limestone bedrock geology (kwak & waters 1997; almodóvar et al. 2006). kwak & waters (1997) suggested that the extreme water fertility should ensure that food resources are not limiting and that salmonid production would likely be limited more by other factors, such as hydrology or instream habitat. our observation that smaller trout within each size group grew faster than larger trout may have simply been an artefact of the higher metabolism and greater scope for growth inherent in smaller ﬁsh rel- ative to larger ﬁsh (elliott 1994). larger ﬁsh, if mature, also allocate more energy into reproductive tissues rather than somatic tissue growth (helfman et al. 1997). abundant food resources could also factors inﬂuencing brown_trout growth explain why trout in this study did not move exten- sively and why stream reach was not a primary modiﬁer of growth. seasonal changes in food avail- ability and water temperature could explain the importance of season in our study and suggest a need for more detailed diet and temperature data, perhaps coupled with a mechanistic bioenergetics assessment. alternatively, our sampling design, focusing on a seasonal timescale, may have been inadequate to properly assess the inﬂuence of some factors, such as short-term movements. our study was designed to assess seasonal shifts to important feeding habitats whereby brown_trout actively moved to speciﬁc reaches with better growing conditions in speciﬁc seasons for a growth beneﬁt. such a pattern would have been supported if we would have found move- ment to be a signiﬁcant factor in conjunction with a reach 9 season interaction. however, signiﬁcant such patterns were not found for this population. radio-tagged brown_trout have been found to move extensively over shorter timescales, such as over- night, before returning to the same pool during the day (diana et al. 2004). our study was not designed to assess such intra-season movements and cautions against over-interpreting movement results. this study identiﬁed ontogenetic changes in growth rates of brown_trout and quantiﬁed the relative impor- tance of seasonal and annual environmental changes in conjunction with the inﬂuence of characteristics of individual trout. this information should guide future studies assessing mechanistic explanations for these patterns, especially long-term ecological studies. this study also suggests that the smallest and youngest brown_trout may be most susceptible to changing conditions, such as land use or climate, and that these effects may be most pronounced in spring and summer. acknowledgements we especially thank r. bearbower, d. casper, s. erickson, s. klotz, m. konsti, b. lee, d. logsdon, j. melander, j.
