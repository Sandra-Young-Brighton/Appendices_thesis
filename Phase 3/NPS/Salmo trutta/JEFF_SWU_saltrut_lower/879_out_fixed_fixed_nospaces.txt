turchin 2003). since 1990s, emerging ﬁelds of spatial ecology and metapopulation biology have shifted the focus towards the interactions among local populations via dispersal (tilman & kareiva 1997; hanski 1999). numerous theoretical works have demonstrated the importance of spatial struc- tures on population persistence and species coex- istence. empirical evaluations, however, are still lacking because of the difﬁculty of extensive ﬁeld surveys at multiple populations, except for particular ﬁeld systems (e.g. hanski 1999). the roles of spatial population structure have received considerable attentions because habitats of many animals and plants have been lost and fragmented since the last century. effects of habitat loss and fragmentation may be most serious in stream-dwelling organisms because dispersal routes are restricted within river networks, correspondence: itsuro koizumi, creative research institution, hokkaido university, n21w10 sapporo, hokkaido 001-0021, japan;

frankham et al. 2002). we can infer population structures, dispersal among local populations and even population demography by genetic analysis, which provides useful information on the roles of space and dispersal on population dynamics. the resolution of genetic markers, however, is still coarse compared to traditional ﬁeld surveys, such as population census or mark-recapture methods: demography and dispersal inferred from genetic analysis are the long-term average of populations (e.g. slatkin 1987; koenig et al. 1996; but see schwartz et al. 2007). population genetics cannot reveal contemporary population dynamics, such as annual ﬂuctuation of abundance, increasing ⁄ decreas- ing trends or synchrony in local population dynamics, which is for ecologists and conservation biologists. the main interest integration of ecological, demographical and genet- ic data is particularly useful to examine population structure and dynamics because both ﬁeld survey and genetic analysis have complementary strengths (slat- kin 1987; gaggiotti et al. 2002; lowe & allendorf 2010). field surveys generally require labour and time costs, but produce high-quality ecological data especially at relatively short time scales. for example, intensive mark-release-recapture studies often reveal population dynamics through estimation of population growth parameters and individual movements (e.g. schwarz & seber 1999), although the number of populations studied is generally small (<10 popula- tions). genetic analysis, on the other hand, can indirectly estimate population parameters at greater spatial and temporal extents, but may lack the resolution found in mark-release-recapture studies. in this study, i propose several hypotheses of possible population structures and mechanisms of population persistence in stream-dwelling ﬁshes, although this applies to many other taxa as well. then, i develop a framework for testing the hypoth- eses using ecological, demographic and genetic data, by summarising a decade of research on stream- dwelling dolly varden charr salvelinus_malma in the sorachi river basin, central hokkaido, japan (koizu- mi & maekawa 2003, 2004; koizumi 2006; koizumi et al. 2006a,b, 2008) with additional results from recent studies. i conclude with a review of this work in the context of related efforts to study spatial popula- tion dynamics of stream-dwelling ﬁshes to provide some general conclusions from what we have learned and point to fruitful directions for future research. spatial structure and persistence in stream ﬁshes spatial structure and freshwater systems river and stream networks are among the most vulnerable ecosystems to human impacts such as habitat fragmentation and altered ﬂow regimes by impoundments, irrigation and sediment loading from agriculture, and water pollution (e.g. richter et al. 1997). as a consequence, a greater number of fresh- water species (including shrimps, crayﬁshes, mussels as well as ﬁshes) throughout the world have become endangered or extinct at both local (watershed) and regional (species range) levels (richter et al. 1997; riccardi & rasmussen 1999; pringle et al. 2000). if in addition, in addition to habitat loss and direct extirpation of local populations, habitat fragmentation is one of the main factors threatening freshwater species. habitat fragmentation constrains population sizes increasing the effects of environmental and demographic sto- chasticity (morita & yamamoto 2002; morita & yokota 2002). freshwater species naturally form metapopulation structures where dis- persal among tributaries or streams inﬂuences popula- tion resilience, physical barriers against dispersal can increase the extinction risk both at the local and regional scales (dunham & rieman 1999; morita et al. 2009). accordingly, it is important to understand the spatial habitat requirements of freshwater species, which may be more important than local habitat factors when considered across stream networks (e.g. isaak et al. 2007). effects of anthropogenic inﬂuences differ depend- ing on characteristics of individual species (rieman & dunham 2000; reynolds et al. 2005; see also duncan & lockwood 2001). for example, for highly sedentary species that naturally inhabit isolated habitats, river fragmentation may be less important as long as the fragment size is larger than the minimum area needed to complete the life cycle. in fact, some small populations are often found above natural waterfalls that prevent upstream dispersal for thousands of years (e.g. elliott 1987; northcote & hartman 1988). on the other hand, for mobile species that require a range of stream areas or habitat types in their life, even a small number of obstacles can critically affect population persistence (jager et al. 2001). therefore, is necessary to understand the mechanisms of population persistence in stream-dwelling ﬁshes, which is strongly related to structures of populations deter- mined by the distribution, dispersal ability and the life history of species within river networks. it hypotheses of population structure and persistence in stream ﬁshes alternative population structures have been proposed in the last few decades, depending on taxonomic 353 koizumi groups and habitats. in this study, i use a relatively simple model modiﬁed from harrison & taylor (1997), mcelhany et al. (2000) and schtickzelle & quinn (2007; fig. 1). the primary aim is to under- stand the mechanisms and ⁄ or processes affecting population dynamics and persistence rather than just to categorise particular patterns (hanski 1999; rieman & dunham 2000). understanding pattern is key for several reasons. first, the distribution of individuals or populations in relation to available habitats deﬁnes spatial structures. some species may occur continuously within a watershed, whereas others in patches. this may change depending on spatial scale examined (falke & fausch 2010): at a smaller scale (e.g. within a stream) distribution tends to be continuous, whereas at a larger scale it may be patchy (e.g. among branches of a large river basin). distributions may also change depending on ontogenic shifts or seasonal migrations (northcote 1997): distribution of a species may be patchy in some seasons and heterogeneous in other seasons. therefore, it is important to determine the proper life stages or habitats to examine spatial structure as well as proper spatial scales. in practice, the distribution of spawning grounds or spawning aggregations is highly relevant to population structure and persistence because it determines breeding unit or local population. in addition, spawning in many ﬁshes require particular environments, which are often distributed patchily. when focal habitats (e.g. spawning areas) are available continuously throughout a river network, individuals may comprise a panmictic population or an isolation-by-distance structure in a continuous space (wright 1943) depending on dispersal distance (fig. 1). in the former, population dynamics, demo- graphy or life history should be identical within the river, assuming that local environmental conditions are less important in driving expression of these char- acteristics. in the latter, each entity character should be

possible population structures in stream ﬁshes (summarised and modiﬁed from the conceptual frameworks of harrison & taylor 1997; mcelhany et al. 2000; schtickzelle & quinn 2007). first, populations can be categorised depending on habitat suitability (patchy or continuous). then, the level of dispersal determines basic population structures. in a metapopulation, frequency of extinction and colonisation characterizes alternative structures. owing to habitat degradation or fragmentation, all the structures can be disrupt into a nonequilibrium structure where local extinction dominates the dynamics. see more details in the text. 354 correlated among neighbouring area, but become independent with increasing distance, and potentially independent of local environmental conditions. to each tributary, when focal habitats are patchily distributed, for example, three basic population structures can be hypothesised depending on the levels of dispersal (fig. 1). if there is no dispersal among tributaries, each population would persist in isolation (i.e. many isolated populations). in some cases, some small and naturally isolated populations appear persistent (e.g. elliott 1987; northcote & hartman 1988; letcher et al. 2007), but in others where human inﬂuences isolate formally connected populations, persistence is likely (morita & yamamoto 2002). the opposite extreme is a patchy panmictic population where dispersal is so frequent and wide- spread that each tributary is essentially interconnected with every other. as some stream ﬁshes undergo long-distance movement (e.g. swanberg 1997), this structure is also possible. the intermediate is a metapopulation structure where dispersal is more or less restricted and each breeding unit is partially independent. less stability or continuous dispersal a metapopulation structure can be further cate- gorised into three basic structures depending on the prevalence of extinction ⁄ colonisation events. if there is no extinction ⁄ colonisation event in each tributary, a structured metapopulation is suggested (equivalent to the member-vagrant hypothesis in garant et al. 2000 and grifﬁths et al. 2009). in this case, all suitable habitats are occupied, for example, owing to environ- mental among neighbouring populations (i.e. rescue effect, hill et al. 2002). the other extreme is a classic or levins type of metapopulation where turnover occurs frequently in every local habitat. although this structure may be uncommon in natural populations (harrison & taylor frequent extinction ⁄ colonisation events are 1997), suggested in some insects and small mammals (reviewed in hanski 1999) as well as some desert ﬁshes (fausch & bramblett 1991; scheurer et al. 2003) and everglades’ ﬁshes (mcelroy et al. 2003). the intermediate situation is a mainland-island or source-sink metapopulation structure where extinction occurs only in small island or sink populations. a review suggested that the mainland-island or source- sink structure is most prevalent in stream ﬁshes (falke & fausch 2010). dolly varden in the sorachi river basin study area i conducted a series of studies in the sorachi river basin above kanayama reservoir in central hokkaido, japan (koizumi & maekawa 2003, 2004; koizumi spatial structure and persistence in stream ﬁshes 2006; koizumi et al. 2006a,b, 2008). dolly varden were most abundant in the middle and upper reaches of the shiisorapuchi river, one of the main branches, especially in its tributaries. they were less abundant in the lower elevation where farmlands and villages are present. there was no record of dolly varden being captured in the kanayama reservoir (i.e. no lake-run population). therefore, the shiisorapuchi river was selected as the core study site where more than 100 small tributaries are present (some tributaries are fed by stable spring waters and others by rain and snowmelt runoff, shallow ground water from main- stream hyporheic entrainment and their mixture). dolly varden occurred both in tributaries and the mainstem, but spawned mostly in tributaries. there- fore, as a working hypothesis, each tributary was assumed as a discrete breeding unit or local population if dispersal among tributaries is restricted. life history and partial migration two life history types were observed even within a single tributary or population (koizumi & maekawa 2003; koizumi et al. 2006a). some individuals migrated to the mainstem and returned to tributaries for spawning, whereas others stayed in small tribu- taries and matured at a smaller size, a phenomenon known as partial migration (jonsson & jonsson 1993). migrants grew larger in the mainstem, producing a size dimorphism between resident and migratory adults (70–110 mm fork length for resident, 120– 170 mm for migrants). males adopted both resident and migratory behaviours, but females usually ma- tured as migrants, suggesting female-biased migration. resident females were rare (ca. 5–20% or 0–3 individuals per tributary a year). migratory individuals may disperse to other (i.e. non-natal) tributaries for spawning, which may connect populations genetically and demographically. given that most females migrate to the mainstem, dispersal of such individuals to other tributaries (called ‘stray’ in some literature, but it may be adaptive, see rieman & dunham 2000) may have a strong inﬂuence on local population dynamics. another important life history characteristic for the population dynamics of dolly varden may be the species short life span in the sorachi river. mature adults mostly consisted of age 1+ and 2+ and >3+ ﬁsh were rare (koizumi et al. 2006a). because of the small body size, fecundity normally ranges from 50 to 200 eggs (i. koizumi, unpublished data). in a stream in the shiretoko peninsula, hokkaido, dolly varden mature at a larger size and live longer (kitano 1997). fecundity at a given body size, however, was higher and egg size smaller in the sorachi river than the shiretoko stream (i. koizumi, unpublished data). the early maturation and short generation in the sorachi 355 koizumi river might be an adaptation for ﬂuctuating environ- ments (letcher et al. 2007). local population size population size is a key parameter for population dynamics and persistence, but is generally difﬁcult to estimate in the wild, especially for multiple locations. in the sorachi river basin, owing to small sizes in tributaries and spawning aggregations in such tribu- taries, estimation of population size was possible. based on detailed population census, number of individuals in typical tributary for dolly varden in the shiisorapuchi river was generally fewer than 500, of which 40–80% were age-0 + (koizumi et al. 2008). the number of mature adults was generally fewer than 100: fewer than 20 females spawned per year. redd counts from 45 tributaries provided a similar result (fig. 2; in most i. koizumi, unpublished data).

unpublished data). during a spawning season in 2004, each of the 45 tributaries with different size was investigated from the conﬂuence to the headwater once or twice and spawning redds were counted. the number of spawning females was estimated based on the assumption that one female constructs two redds on average (kitano & shimazaki 1995). the x-axes represent log- transformed water discharge. the size distribution of tributaries in the shiisorapuchi river is also shown (lower panel, after koizumi & maekawa 2004). note that the number of tributaries larger than )1 (zero in the log-scale) is only three. spawning (ﬁlled >1 m3 s bar) represents tributaries where spawning was observed (i.e. local populations). fish (hatched bar) represents tributaries where individuals were observed, but not spawned (i.e. temporal use, such as for nursery). 356 the numbers of tributaries, females were again estimated as fewer than 20 and the median was just nine. a relatively large population size (>100 females) was estimated only in the largest tributary surveyed. this is one of the largest tributaries in the shiisor- apuchi river (ca. 4 km in length) and the environment seems ideal for dolly varden (e.g. cold spring water, suitable spawning substrates), but still a number of female spawners was just a few hundreds. if minimum viable population (mvp) sizes in stream-dwelling salmonids are between 250 to 2000 individuals excluding age-0+ (e.g. rieman & mcintyre 1993; morita & yokota 2002; hilderbrand 2003), local populations in most tributaries may be vulnerable if they are isolated, except for a few large tributaries like the one described earlier. such large populations were found only in ﬁve tributaries in the shiisorapuchi river so far (judged from coarse electroﬁshing and snorkel- ing, i. koizumi, pers. obs.), although no quantitative estimate was made. because numbers of individuals in more than 90% of the tributaries should be below the mvp values, each tributary population may not persist long time without immigration. therefore, the role of dispersal and population structure in dolly varden as a potential inﬂuence on persistence in this system becomes an important question. dna maker-based tests of alternative models of population structure (i.e. many isolated populations), when focal habitat is distributed patchily within a watershed, population structure is determined by the levels of dispersal among the habitats (fig. 1). such structures can be tested by population genetic analysis, by estimating the degree of genetic differentiation or gene ﬂow. first, if there is no gene ﬂow among local habitats strong genetic divergence is expected, which is independent of geographical distance among tributaries because of random genetic drift. second, if there is considerable gene ﬂow among local habitats (i.e. a patchy panmictic population), no genetic divergence should be ob- served. third, if moderate level of gene ﬂow connects only neighbouring habitats (i.e. a metapopulation), genetic divergence should be observed only among distant tributaries (i.e. a positive correlation between genetic divergence and geographical distance), a pattern called ‘isolation-by-distance (ibd)’ (wright 1943; slatkin 1993). to test the alternative hypothesis in dolly varden, microsatellite dna analysis was used to compare populations across 17 tributaries (£26 km) (koizumi et al. 2006b). signiﬁcant genetic divergence was observed among the tributaries (mean fst = 0.05– 0.08), leading to rejection of the panmictic population hypothesis. the genetic divergence was positively correlated with geographical distance, but the correla- tion was weak (r2 = 0.18). a subsequent new approach based on a residual analysis detected seven ‘outlier’ populations where genetic divergences were substantially high or low (see detail in koizumi et al. 2006b). when such outliers were excluded, the correlation of genetic and geographical distances became much higher (r2 = 0.76), a strong indicative of ibd. therefore, a metapopulation structure appears likely. some of the outliers, which disrupted the general pattern of genetic structure, were populations with physical barriers and human impacts. they might have lost connectivity, and therefore, may persist as isolated populations or be heading to local extinction. in addition, despite the physical connections to other tributaries, a small population (the number of spawn- ing females was estimated at 2–3) was selected as an outlier with high genetic divergence (fst = 0.10, <3 km), which suggests a strong genetic drift. population synchrony to assess demographic dependency despite the signiﬁcant differentiation at the watershed level, little genetic divergence was observed among neighbouring tributaries (<5–10 km; koizumi et al. 2006b). this indicates extensive dispersal among neigh- bouring tributaries, forming a single demographic unit or local population. therefore, genetic analysis alone could not conﬁrm the hypothesis that each tributary contained a partially independent local population. to investigate further whether each tributary popu- lation was demographically independent, the level of synchrony in population dynamics was assessed among ﬁve neighbouring tributaries (<7 km) over 10 years (koizumi et al. 2008). the prediction is that if dispersal is substantial among the tributaries (i.e. panmixy) as suggested in the genetic analysis, popula- tion demography should be highly synchronised. the level of synchrony, however, was not high in abundance and other demographic characteristics coefﬁcients, q = 0.33, (mean range = )0.19 to 0.56). moreover, a few cases of positive synchrony was more likely due to common environmental factors (i.e. moran effect), rather than dispersal, because an isolated tributary showed high levels of synchrony with the other tributaries. these results collectively suggest that population dynamics are largely independent in each tributary. therefore, the demographic analysis supported the hypothesis that each tributary contains a local population. correlation cross extinction ⁄ colonisation dynamics the next question is whether extinction and colonisa- tion naturally occur at the local population level, an spatial structure and persistence in stream ﬁshes important aspect of metapopulation dynamics (hanski 1999). because direct observation of extinction and ⁄ or colonisation is generally difﬁcult in natural popula- tions, patch occupancy survey (i.e. presence or absence of species) is often used to infer such dynamics (e.g. a review in hanski 1999; stream ﬁshes in rieman & mcintyre 1995; dunham & rieman 1999; gotelli & taylor 1999; morita & yamamoto 2002). in theory, extinction rate is higher in small populations and colonisation rate is lower in isolated populations. therefore, if occurrence is higher in larger, more connected habitats and lower in smaller, more isolated habitats in the wild, such observed pattern infers underlying extinction ⁄ colonisation dy- namics (hanski 1999; but see clinchy et al. 2002 for an alternative hypothesis). leading to rejection of the patch occupancy pattern of dolly varden was investigated in 2000 (koizumi & maekawa 2004) and 2004 (i. koizumi, unpublished data). in the 2000 survey for 78 tributaries, some tributaries were suggested to be suitable, but unoccupied by dolly varden. such tributaries tended to be small and more isolated, suggesting extinction and ⁄ or colonisation at the tributary level, the structured metapopulation hypothesis. we also found a non-equilibrium dynamics in the lower reaches of the study area where extinction overrides re-colonisa- tion because of human disturbance (koizumi & maekawa 2004). this is consistent with high genetic divergence in the lower area (koizumi et al. 2006b). then, which structure is more likely, classic or mainland-island? most of the middle- and large-sized )1) were consistently occupied tributaries (>0.03 m3 s by dolly varden (fig. 2). therefore, populations in such sizes should be relatively stable. extinction and colonisation events may occur only in very small tributaries. microsatellite analysis (koizumi et al. 2006b) also supported the temporal stability in moderate and large populations because such strong ibd (r2 = 0.76) is not expected if extinction ⁄ coloni- sation occur frequently (whitlock 1992). high genetic divergence in the very small tributary (mentioned before) may be also consistent with a founder event after local extinction. therefore, mainland-island or source-sink structure is more plausible in the dolly varden than classic metapopulation structure. the patch occupancy survey also showed that dolly varden populations were more likely to occur in spring-fed tributaries (koizumi & maekawa 2004), which may reﬂect the environmental stabilities of spring-fed tributaries. thus, spring-fed tributaries may function as mainland or source habitats. given this, how often do local extinction and ⁄ or colonisation occur? in the second patch occupancy survey in 2004, all of the 36 tributaries occupied in 2000 were also occupied, even in very small 357 koizumi indicates tributaries. this that extinction is not frequent regardless of small population size, although the time span of the survey is short (i.e. 4 years equivalent to 1–2 generations). on the other hand, new breeding events were observed in 2004 in a few tributaries where no spawning was observed in 2000, suggesting some colonisation events did occur. over the past 10 years since i started to study this dolly varden in more than 100 tributaries, only three populations have appeared to have gone extinct (i.e. were reduced to levels not detectable even by intensive sampling and observations). the common situation is that all three had physical barriers to prevent upstream dispersal. two of the tributaries have an artiﬁcial dam or culvert and the others have a natural vertical fall (<1 m) at the junction with the mainstem that had probably been created after a heavy ﬂood in 2003. one of the tributaries was nearly completely desiccated above a dam section in a summer, which is probably the cause of local extinction. some other tributaries also suffered partial desiccation events and strong disturbances from heavy ﬂoods, but populations are still persisting as long as tributaries are connected to the mainstem (e.g. magoulick & kobza 2003). after a couple of heavy ﬂooding events in the past 10 years, some tributary habitats were signiﬁcantly reduced because of the changes in the watercourse of the mainstem. at the same time, a few tributaries have been newly emerged. such catastrophic changes in habitats may create a long-term extinction ⁄ colonisa- tion dynamics of dolly varden in this system. synthesis: population structure and persistence of dolly varden in the sorachi river population census and redd counts indicated that most tributary populations may not persist long time if they are isolated. only a small number (probably ﬁve) of relatively large populations may persist without immigration (i.e. self-sustaining populations). patch occupancy survey, however, suggested low extinction probability even in small populations. the large self- sustaining populations may act as source or mainland to neighbouring small sink or island populations. however, these large populations may not be enough to support all small populations in the network. it is possible that many small populations exchange individuals with neighbouring small populations, collectively acting as population clusters (i.e. regional populations) that function as larger viable populations through mutual rescue effects (but not enough to create complete population synchrony). such step- ping-stone type of dispersal should partly connect population demography and genetic composition throughout the network (i.e. metapopulation). 358 the population structure of dolly varden in the sorachi river basin, however, is not simple, as suggested in some other stream ﬁshes (e.g. dunham & rieman 1999; falke & fausch 2010). the structure was primarily approximated as a source-sink or mainland-island metapopulation, but nonequilibrium structure was also suggested in the lower area (koizumi & maekawa 2004; koizumi et al. 2006b). in the lower area, however, some local populations still exist (i. koizumi, unpublished data). these populations may stand as many isolated populations (fig. 1), or facing extinction in the near future (i.e. extinction debt). on the other hand, in the upper-most areas where i have not fully examined, population structure may be a panmictic or isolation-by-distance in continuous habitats (fig. 1), because spawning occurs both in the tributaries and in the mainstem (i. koizumi, unpublished data). whereas falke & fausch (2010) suggested that the population structure may change across spatial scales (e.g. panmicitic at smaller scales, nonequilibrium at larger scales), i suggest that population structure may also change along water- courses (e.g. panmicitic in upper area, nonequilibrium in lower area). gotelli & taylor (1999) found an altitudinal cline that extinction is more likely and colonisation less likely in upstream than downstream sites in the cimarron river, oklahoma, where up- stream provides more ephemeral habitats with higher evaporation events. population structure may also change across time. at the time scale in this study, extinction and colonisation rarely occurred, so a structured metapo- pulation without extinction might rather be more appropriate. at the longer time scale, on the other hand, catastrophic disturbances may extirpate local populations or create new habitats to colonise. in this case, a source-sink or mainland-island metapopulation may ﬁt better. both patch occupancy survey and genetic analysis inferred the possibility of extinction and colonisation events, but the direct evidence and time scale of turnover rates have remained unclear. rescue effect should be the main factor that explains persistence in small populations, but an alternative possibility cannot be ruled out: some small populations may be able to survive without immigra- tion from other populations (e.g. letcher et al. 2007). some tributaries, especially spring-fed ones, are highly stable in temperature and discharge, providing ideal conditions for dolly varden, especially for juveniles (koizumi & maekawa 2004; koizumi et al. 2008). immigrants may not be necessary for population persistence in such tributaries, and the populations might act as source or mainland populations. spring-fed tributaries may also increase metapopu- lation persistence by reducing the levels of synchrony in population dynamics: when local dynamics become more independent, extinction probability of a meta- population will decrease (heino 1998; palmqvist & lundberg 1998). population dynamics of stream ﬁshes are often regulated by water discharge, especially during ﬂoods and droughts, which can create strong regional synchrony (grenouillet et al. 2001; lobo´ n- cervia´ 2004), and could in turn increase basin-wide extinction risks. stable spring-fed tributaries, on the other hand, should be less inﬂuenced by such regional environmental ﬂuctuations, which may be a factor in the weak synchrony of dolly varden. the diversities of both life history (e.g. resident and migrant) and habitat (e.g. the mainstem and two types of tributaries) may also contribute to the persistence of the dolly varden. the utilisation of different habitats among individuals of different forms may reduce the risk of catastrophic disturbances such as ﬂood, drought or ﬁre (pearsons et al. 1992; rieman et al. 1997). for example, some small tributaries were desiccated in summer and ⁄ or frozen in winter (i. koizumi, pers. obs.). in this case, migratory individuals can maintain the local populations, by escaping from such events. on the other hand, effects of ﬂoods from storms could be severe in the mainstem compared to tributaries (especially, stable spring-fed tributaries). in this case, resident individuals may play an important role in the subsequent generations if the ﬂoods extirpate migra- tory individuals. or, migrants may use tributaries as temporal refuges. conservation implications resident in spite of the low extinction probability in natural conditions, the population characteristics of the dolly varden makes them highly vulnerable to habitat alterations both at the tributary and watershed levels. at the tributary level, if movement barriers (e.g. dams, impassable road culverts) were installed in a tributary, the populations above the barriers would decline quickly because most females migrate to the mainstem and only a few small females (if any) contribute to the next generations. such a small population should be vulnerable to local extinction just because of demographic stochasticity (lande 1993; morita & yokota 2002). in fact, the three presumed extinction events in the past decade were all above physical barriers. also, in another tributary, no dolly varden was observed above a small erosion dam despite the presence of breeding below the dam, indicating a local extinction above the dam. such immediate extirpation by damming could be avoided if ﬁsh change life history from migratory to residency (morita et al. 2000), but this may not last long time because of small population size (morita & yokota 2002). in addition to the habitat fragmentation, such small tributaries are susceptible to river reclamation spatial structure and persistence in stream ﬁshes and revetment, which can readily extirpate local populations. thus, local populations are highly susceptible both because of their natural character- istics, such as small population size and female-biased migration, and because of human land use. such a local extinction could spread at the watershed level by reducing the connection of local populations or rescue effects. when a human-induced local extinction takes place in a tributary that is surrounded by many tributaries, the effect may not be important for other populations because the rescue effect may still be enough to support viable regional- or meta-populations. however, if such extinction occurred in a ‘critical’ tributary that signiﬁcantly connects local populations, reduction of the rescue effect may result in local extinction of nearby populations. such local extinctions further reduce the rescue effect and may cause chain reaction (extinction vortex). therefore, only a small number of habitat alterations could possibly cause signiﬁcant metapopu- lation degradation. it is necessary thus to assess the critical habitats and ⁄ or the minimum viable (meta-) population sizes (rosenfeld & hatﬁeld 2006). synthesis and future directions: population structure and persistence of stream ﬁshes traditionally, population dynamics of stream ﬁshes have been studied within single streams, mainly focusing on density-dependent population regulations and environmental factors that affect dynamics (e.g. elliott 1994). in addition to the difﬁculty in collecting quantitative data at multiple locations, ignoring spatial structure or connectivity among local habitats may stem from the ‘restricted movement paradigm’ (gerk- ing 1959) that suggests limited dispersal of stream ﬁshes, so the dynamics should be local processes. gowan et al. (1994) questioned the viewpoint and, since then, considerable evidence has been accumu- lated about the extensive dispersal of stream ﬁshes (e.g. gowan & fausch 1996; skalski & gilliam 2000; rodrı´guez 2002), which emphasizes the importance of connectivity and spatial structure within stream net- works (e.g. rieman & dunham 2000; fagan 2002; falke & fausch 2010). the ﬁrst and most extensive study examining spatial structure in stream ﬁshes is bull trout s. conﬂuentus in northwestern usa. studies from different approaches (e.g. rieman & mcintyre 1993, 1996; spruell et al. 1999) concluded that many bull trout populations form complex metapopulation structures with the possibility of extinction ⁄ colonisation dynamics (e.g. dunham & rieman 1999). in addition to human impacts, catastrophic disturbance, such as wildﬁre and land- slides, may be a cause for local extinction (e.g. rieman et al. 1997). the study systems of bull trout 359 koizumi and dolly varden shared much in common (e.g. same genus, complex metapopulation structure, within- stream migration) with some contrasting differences (e.g. spatial scales and body size). the most intensive study, on the other hand, is probably about brook_trout s. fontinalis in a simple stream network of western massachusetts, usa (letcher et al. 2007; xu et al. 2010). the study integrates pit-tag research and microsatellite analysis to compare population models from open and closed streams. they concluded that currently connected tributary populations would go extinct within 2–6 generations (4–12 years) if dispersal from the main- stem were blocked, a similar conclusion with dolly varden. on the other hand, they also found that small isolated populations can persist long time if adaptation occurs. a spatially continuous approach has been proposed by a similar intensive pit-tag research in coastal cut-throat trout o. clarkii (e.g. gresswell et al. 2006; berger & gresswell 2009), which is of particular use for species distributing continuously within stream networks. falke & fausch (2010) reviewed the literature on metapopulation structures of stream ﬁshes, using the keywords, ‘metapopulation’ or ‘source-sink’. of 31 papers they found (although anadromous populations were included), source-sink structure was the most frequently reported (16 papers), followed by non- equilibrium (six papers). this is not surprising because source-sink is the simplest metapopulation structure that incorporates space and because many metapopu- lation studies are conservation oriented (falke & fausch 2010). in fact, many rivers or streams had already been affected by human activities, so less affected study systems, like that of dolly varden in the sorachi river, are valuable as reference or original settings. a thorough examination of non-equilibrium situa- tion is white-spotted charr s. leucomaenis populations isolated by erosion control dams in southern hokkai- do, japan (morita et al. 2000, 2009; morita & yamamoto 2002; morita & yokota 2002; yamamoto et al. 2004). the series of studies clearly demonstrated that both size and time of isolation can critically affect the population vital rate, and only environmental and demographic stochasticity can lead to local extinction above dams. the stream sizes and life history of the white-spotted charr are similar with those of the dolly varden in my system. these two systems can be a good contrast to examine population dynamics under natural and disturbed stream networks. extinction ⁄ colonisation dynamics have rarely been observed in stream ﬁshes except for particular stream systems (e.g. fausch & bramblett 1991; gagen et al. 1998; scheurer et al. 2003). salmonids are most widely studied, but direct natural 360 evidence of extinction ⁄ colonisation is very rare: it is generally inferred from the pattern of patch occupancy (dunham & rieman 1999; koizumi & maekawa 2004). there is a piece of circumstantial evidence where catastrophic disturbances, such as wildﬁres or debris ﬂows, extirpated ﬁshes in some stream reaches (e.g. pearsons et al. 1992; burton 2005), but indivi- duals often recover very quickly (within few years), so it is questionable if this represents an actual ex- tinction ⁄ colonisation dynamics (e.g. rieman et al. 1997; rieman & dunham 2000). many desert ﬁshes, on the other hand, experience actual extinction and re- colonisation events because of intermittent water ﬂow, at least, at the patch scales (i.e. pools)(e.g. fausch & bramblett 1991; gagen et al. 1998; labbe & fausch 2000; scheurer et al. 2003). however, whether they form metapopulation structures remains unknown because population dynamics should be highly synchronous in response to water ﬂow (e.g. larned et al. 2010). populations might be rather panmictic because of potential long-distance dispersal during ﬂooding events. desert ﬁsh systems have been studied mostly based on ﬁeld surveys. genetic analysis would be informative to test the alternative hypotheses. although natural extinction ⁄ colonisation events have been suggested in some stream ﬁshes (dunham & rieman 1999; labbe & fausch 2000; koizumi & maekawa 2004), knowledge on the time scale of turnover events and the causes of local extinction is critically lacking. local extinction may take place during catastrophic disturbances, such as ﬂoods, droughts, wildﬁres, landslides or debris ﬂows (e.g. rieman et al. 1997). because such events may occur at a time scale of 10–100 years, it is difﬁcult to assess the rare events in nature. at this time scale, genetic analysis may provide some information, such as time after disturbance (e.g. yamamoto et al. 2004; letcher et al. 2007; but see koizumi et al. 2006b; neville et al. 2009). in small populations, on the other hand, only stochasticity can lead to local extinction (morita & yokota 2002). in such populations, inbreeding depression or loss of genetic diversity may also affect population viability (saccheri et al. 1998). thus, it is difﬁcult to determine actual causes or mechanisms of local extinctions because multiple factors simulta- neously lead to extinctions. the low frequency of natural extinction (a case of the dolly varden) and quick recovery after cata- strophic disturbances (e.g. rieman et al. 1997; burton 2005) may rather be an indication of high resilience or viability of stream ﬁsh populations. in fact, many stream organisms have been adapted to the ﬂuctuating environments (lytle & poff 2004). as long as habitats are well connected, extinction may be rare even in small local populations, or, even if it becomes extinct, a new population may readily be colonised. despite in stream organisms the potential high persistence, the ubiquitous extinc- tions (richter et al. 1997; riccardi & rasmussen 1999; pringle et al. 2000) indicate the signiﬁcance of human impacts. more studies are needed to examine the mechanisms of population persistence in wild ﬁsh populations. conclusions i have shown the framework to investigate the population structures and persistence in stream ﬁshes by integrating demographic, ecological and genetic data. the concept and methods are applicable to many stream organisms. researchers should explicitly deﬁne the unit of local populations and the spatial and time scales examined; population structures may change across space and time. the dolly varden provided the idea how natural populations persist at the watershed level, and became a good reference with a few comparative study systems. rather surprising result was that the extinction rate was low despite small local population sizes, indicating strong persistence in the presence of dispersal. however, they were highly vulnerable to habitat alterations. long-term researches at basin-wide scales would be inevitable to understand complete pictures of spatial structure and population persistence in stream ﬁshes. acknowledgements i thank bruce rieman,
