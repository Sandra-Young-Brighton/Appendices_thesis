however, the patterns for temporal trends in individual species abundances were not conserved across sites. decreasing trends were observed in longear sunﬁsh, striped shiner, white sucker, central stoneroller, common carp and creek chub while bluegill and mimic shiner increased in abundance. longear sunﬁsh was the only species that exhibited the same trend in abundance for all sites. niche breadth was inversely related to the population growth rate at sites adjacent to low-head dam impoundments. we suggest that the presence of multiple impoundments has resulted in a fragmented series of ﬁsh assemblages. key words: fish assemblages; malthusian growth model; long term data; bayesian inference introduction and stochastic deterministic identiﬁcation of patterns in community structure is a central theme in freshwater ecology. application of niche theory (hutchinson 1957; vandermeer 1972), gradient analysis (whittaker 1967; vannote et al. 1980), community assembly inference (grossman et al. 1982; schlosser 1982), and more recently, hierarchical modelling (royle & dorazio 2008; hitt & roberts 2011) have improved understanding of spatial and temporal vari- ation in populations and communities. temporal shifts in assemblage structure can indicate ﬂuctua- tions in habitat, population dynamics, ecosystem function, and have management or conservation the majority of ecological implications. however, studies focus on relatively short timescales (willis et al. 2007). exploring long-term data sets for com- munity processes and spatiotemporal patterns pro- vides (grossman et al. 1982; schlosser 1982; weaver & garman 1994; pyron et al. 2006; magurran et al. 2010). improved insight estimators of rare/common species, despite their utility, many long-term ecological incorrect analyses are limited by nonnormal data, and point collection bias (e.g., gear, investigator, detection, etc.). bayesian inference of hierarchical models is a recent technique employed in ecology where model components can be speciﬁed to account for these constraints and results in increased accuracy and res- olution of model parameters (wade 2000; clark 2005; gelman & hill 2006; kery et al. 2009). bayes- ian inference has been used for managing sport ﬁsh (willberg et al. 2005), estimating species richness correspondence: jason c. doll, aquatic biology and fisheries center, department of biology, ball state university, 2000 w university ave, muncie, in 47306, usa. jcdoll@bsu.edu sjj and jcd contributed equally in this study. 280 doi: 10.1111/eff.12025 long-term ﬁsh assemblages respond to habitat and niche breadth (bayley & peterson 2001; hector et al. 2011), meta- population modelling (ter braak & etienne 2003) and predator–prey models (schmidt et al. 2001). bayesian methodologies discern probabilities for a set of parameters given observed data. the bayesian framework permits ecologists to evaluate complex models with multiple latent parameters and draw inference from large sets of parameters. bayesian inference can be applied to any mathe- matical model, including the malthusian growth model (gotelli et al. 2010). the intrinsic rate of increase is a parameter of the malthusian growth model representing the population-speciﬁc estimate of abundance change with time (lotka 1945; caugh- ley & birch 1971). identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant rate of change values without environmental or species-spe- ciﬁc life history covariates is only relative to a null model (e.g., time) and does not provide any informa- tion regarding the mechanisms driving the change. incorporation of additional information such as habi- tat or species-speciﬁc niche attributes can increase explanatory power of long-term trends by further describing community data and environmental varia- tion (macarthur 1960; jiao et al. 2009). grinnell (1917) developed the niche concept based on a species’ speciﬁc suite of physical habitat attri- butes necessary to optimise ﬁtness (hirzel & le lay 2008). application of niche theory in the description of temporal trends in assemblage structure facilitates prediction of prior habitat conditions based on pre- dictable species–environment response curves (austin 2002). one expectation is that species with increas- ingly generalist niches are expected to increase in degraded habitats and exhibit less population change over time compared with specialist species (karr et al. 1985). conversely, in instances of low environ- mental alteration, specialist species’ populations are not expected to decline. this occurs as a result of the increased likelihood of specialist species’ populations to covary with environment (devictor et al. 2008). however, local assemblages in a given area or habitat are limited by the available regional species pool (jackson et al. 2001). lotic systems in the midwestern united states are predominantly inﬂuenced by urban and agricul- tural activities including alteration of ﬂow regime (low-head/levee impoundments and channelisation), sedimentation, nutrient and chemical input, and intro- duction of exotic species (karr et al. 1985; nislow et al. 2011). these inﬂuences can alter and shift aqua- tic communities (santucci et al. 2005). jacquemin & pyron (2011) described the current ﬁsh assemblages of indiana as dominated (70%) by a few (14) general- ist species that have prevailed in concert with years of habitat alteration. homogenous or degraded habi- tats were observed to be associated with increasingly generalist assemblages (jacquemin & pyron 2011). however, whether or not long-term changes in ﬁsh assemblages are related to niche breadth is unknown. the incorporation of niche attributes in hierarchical population and assemblage models may improve our understanding of species abundance patterns that result from habitat homogenisation, restoration, or exotic species invasion, and provide a measure of environmental condition (bond & lake 2003). our objectives were to (1) identify temporal trends in ﬁsh assemblages from 1980 to 2010 in the west fork white river in east-central indiana using the population growth rate parameter of the malthusian growth model and (2) determine whether change in the population growth rate parameter was related to grinnellian niche breadth. we hypothesised that tem- poral ﬁsh assemblage trends would follow a deter- ministic model and inclusion of individual species niche breadth would improve our understanding of assemblage change. the underlying mechanism of this relationship is rooted in environmental variation. thus, we predict that covariation of time and popula- tion abundance reﬂects a continuum from specialist to generalist taxa, whereby generalist taxa are more suited to a variety of habitat conditions and less prone to population trends with time seen in special- ist taxa. explicitly, our a priori hypothesis is that we expect more specialised taxa inferred by lower niche breadths to exhibit greater trends in population with time compared with generalist taxa. methods study area the study was conducted on the west fork white river (hereafter referred to as the white river) in east-central indiana, usa. the white river watershed is approximately 995 km2 in our study area and land use primarily consists of row crop (73%) and pasture (13%) agriculture [united states department of agriculture (usda) 2001]. stream depth and width ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 m and 25 to 35 m, respectively. dominant substrate type is cobble and gravel with scattered areas of sand or bedrock (jcd unpublished side scan sonar data). riparian zone varied from buffer zones of wooded vegetation to maintained grass strips. in addition, a continuous levee (us army corps of engineers) follows one bank side. data collection fish were sampled at 16 sites from 1980 to 2010 (fig. 1) (1997) and the ohio environmental protection agency for following simon & dufour 281 stephen j. jacquemin & jason c. doll fig. 1. map of sampling area. assessment of streams within the eastern corn belt plains ecoregion (ohio environmental protection agency (oepa) 1989). sampling was conducted at normal pool while turbidity maintained less than 40 nephelometric turbidity units. two types of electro- ﬁshing equipment were used for ﬁsh collections. a tote-barge-mounted smith-root model 2.5 gpp electroﬁsher with a 2500 watt generator and a rcb-6b junction box was used for wadeable sites. nonwadeable sites were sampled with a boat- mounted smith-root model 5.0 gpp electroﬁsher with a 5000-watt generator and a rcb-6b junction box electoﬁsher using a dropper array for the anode and boat hull as cathode. sampling was conducted along a linear reach of the stream based on 15 times the wetted width with a minimum distance of 200 m for the wadeable sites and a minimum distance of 500 m for nonwadeable sites. each site was sampled using only one collection technique and all represen- tative habitats were sampled within the stream reach following a single pass. fish were netted (3 mm stretch mesh) and immediately placed into a live well. following sampling, all ﬁsh were identiﬁed to species, counted, length measured and batch weighed by species. fish were identiﬁed using regional identiﬁcation manuals (trautman 1981). voucher specimens were curated at the bureau of water qual- ity (bwq), muncie, indiana. all ﬁsh samples were collected as part of the bureau of water qualities long-term ﬁsheries monitoring programme in white 282 river. sampling crews consisted of one biologist and three technicians (see acknowledgements section). technician assistants were required to be enrolled in an aquatic or environmental sciences university pro- gramme and were given 2 weeks of training in ﬁsher- ies electroﬁshing principles prior to sampling. (2009) whereby niche from the fishtraits database niche was characterised on the basis of habitat afﬁnities for substrate type (muck, clay, sand, gravel, cobble, bedrock and boulder), submerged vegetation, woody debris, detritus, lotic (slow current, moderate current, fast current) or lentic systems and lowland or upland range (frimpong & angermeier 2009). all data were (ﬁsh- wild.vt.edu/ﬁshtraits/) described in frimpong & an- germeier attributes were assigned from a combination of regional observational and distribution studies (e.g., trautman 1981; page & burr 1991), and individual species were scored as a 1/ 0 for each habitat or life history metric. our measure of niche breadth was calculated as the sum of all posi- tive habitat occurrences (pyron 1999; higgins & strauss 2008). thus, taxon with larger niche breadth scores would occur in a greater diversity of habitat types than those with smaller scores and be more clo- sely aligned as generalists. this approach is limited by condensing intraspeciﬁc variation in habitat use to a single binomial character. thus, niche breadth score does not facilitate details driving which particular hab- itat component is inﬂating a given score (e.g., a higher score may result from a variety of substrate prefer- long-term ﬁsh assemblages respond to habitat and niche breadth ences of stream sizes). in addition, the approach out- lined above does not incorporate speciﬁc chemical water quality tolerances. however, given the number of species included in the analysis, we expect our overall estimates and resulting model parameter to be an appropriate approach for estimating niche breadth. data analysis temporal trends in species abundance were assessed using a bootstrapping procedure and hierarchical model following gotelli et al. (2010). the bootstrap procedure compares variability in temporal trends among species within the data set to a null model. the null model is an assumption that ecological pro- cesses did not contribute to the abundance matrix, thus observed changes in species abundance are due to simple sampling effects. sampling effects are those processes during sampling that inﬂuence the observed trends in abundance (i.e., missing species or low abundance of a particular species due to insufﬁcient sampling.), and is expanded to include an estimate of undetected species with the chao2 estimator (chao 1984; gotelli et al. 2010). the null hypothesis being tested is that variability in temporal trends among spe- cies is not greater than what would be expected due to simple sampling effects. the alternative hypothesis is that at least some species are increasing or decreasing in a systematic way that cannot be accounted for by sampling effects alone. the null model is used to con- struct a simulated assemblage based on the observed data that is proportional to the species abundance and year-speciﬁc sampling probability. temporal change was then calculated from the simulated abundance based on the null model and from observed values. first, the slope of individual species regression models as a function of collection year was estimated. equation a: yij ¼ b0 þ b1tj þ ij where yij is the abundance of species i sampled dur- ing survey j, b0 is the intercept, b1 is the slope, tj is the time of survey j in years and eij is error assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation r2. overall temporal change (tc) for the entire assemblage at each site was quantiﬁed as the variance of the b1 parameter. equation b: tc ¼ 1 s   1 ðb1i   b1þ2 rs i¼1 temporal trends that are more heterogeneous and exhi- bit larger changes in composition would result in larger tc values. temporal trends model was ﬁt in r 2.14 (r development core team 2011). see gotelli et al. (2010) for a thorough discussion on the null model. after an overall evaluation of assemblage change, we used the hierarchical model to estimate parame- ters of the malthusian growth model. the abundance (n) of species i in sample j was assumed to follow a poisson distribution with mean abundance, a function of the malthusian growth model (equation c). equation c: nijjkij  poissonðkijþ kij ¼ kioexpðri  tjþ equation d: where nij represents the observed number of species i during the jth survey, kij represents mean abundance of species i during survey j, tj represents the year of the jth survey and ri represents the average annual rate of change in abundance of species i. in lieu of replicated counts, the probability of capture is assumed to vary among species, but not surveys. the model is parameterised in a linear form (equation e), integrating and substituting lij for nij and ai for kio (see gotelli et al. 2010 for a complete description). equation e: logðlijþ ¼ ai þ ritj where lij denotes the poisson mean for individual species counts, ai denotes the species-speciﬁc inter- cept, ri denotes the vector describing the annual trend in abundance of species i and tj denotes sample year of the jth survey. in the base model, the trend in spe- cies change in abundance, ri, follows a normal distri- bution with mean b and variance r2 (equation 2.18, from gotelli et al. 2010). equation f: r1jb; r2 ¼ normalðb; r2þ in this parameterisation, b represents the overall mean trend in abundance and r2 represents variabil- ity among species. we extended this model to a two- level hierarchical structure (gelman & hill 2006), so that the assemblage wide mean trend in species abun- dance b is modelled as follows: equation g: r1jbi; r2 ¼ normalðbi; r2þ equation h: bi ¼ d þ x  nbi the parameter d denotes the overall mean trend in abundance (analogous to b in the base model) when niche breadth or x is 0, x denotes the vector describ- ing the relationship between niche breadth and trends in abundance, bi represents the species-speciﬁc trend in abundance and nbi represents niche breadth for species i. niche breadth was standardised to a mean of 0 and unit standard deviation to improve model 283 stephen j. jacquemin & jason c. doll convergence by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation using the following formula: equation i: standardðnbiþ ¼ nbi   nbi stdðnbiþ hierarchical models were ﬁt using a bayesian approach (robert & casella 2004) within the open- bugs software (lunn et al. 2009). bayesian infer- ence differs fundamentally from frequentist null hypothesis testing in its deﬁnition of probability, whereby bayesian inference views probability as the uncertainty about the value of a parameter and the frequentist inference views probability as the relative frequency of an event. the foundation of bayesian inference is based on bayes’ theorem where the prob- ability of a model parameter (h) given observed data (x) is estimated using the data, the prior belief about h and the evidence. according to bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability of model parameters given observed data p(h|x) is calculated by: equation j: pðhjxþ ¼ pðxjhþpðhþ dhpðxjhþpðhþ r here, p(x|h) denotes the probability of the data given the parameters (the likelihood function), p(h) denotes the prior probability of the model parameters and the denominator (the evidence) is a normalising parameter calculated by summing across all possible parameter values weighted by the strength of their belief. for a thorough discussion on bayesian infer- ence, see gelman et al. (2004) and kruschke (2011). we used vague (i.e., noninformative) priors to indi- cate that we presume no a priori knowledge of the model parameters. we assumed normal (0, 0.0001) priors for a, d and x, and a uniform (0, 10) prior for r. three markov chains were independently ini- tialised and 300,000 draws were made for all sites. the ﬁrst 150,000 draws of each chain were dis- carded as a ‘burn-in period’, which resulted in a total posterior sample of 450,000 draws to estimate the model’s parameters and 95% credible intervals. we analysed each site separately and are primarily interested in the rate of change for each species rather than change in abundance. we assume that capture probability of constant between 1980 and 2010. while small-bodied ﬁsh (e.g., cyprinidae) are less likely to be collected with the boat unit is assumed constant, thus, the rate of change would not be signiﬁcantly affected. the bias (within a given site) each gear was a graphical representation of the two-level hierar- chical model is provided in fig. 2 using a directed acyclic graph (dag) (spiegelhalter et al. 1996). 284 fig. 2. directed acyclic graph of the two-level hierarchical model describing the relationship between niche breadth and annual rate of change in species abundance. rectangles are constants (i.e., data) and ellipses are parameters estimated by the model. nij is the abundance of species i in year j, tj is year j,lij is the poisson mean for individual species counts, ai is the species-speciﬁc inter- cept in equation e, ri is the vector describing the annual trend in abundance for species i, bi is the mean species-speciﬁc trend in abundance, nbi is the species-speciﬁc niche breadth, d and x are hyperparameters specifying the mean of the normal distribution for bi, and τ and r are hyperparameters describing the precision of the normal distribution for bi. nodes represent stochastic and deterministic model components. stochastic nodes are either parentless nodes or related to their parents by single line arrows (i.e., ri and ai). deterministic nodes are related to their parents with a double line arrow (i.e., bi or lij). model selection between the base (i.e., hierarchical model without niche breadth) and extended model (i.e., hierarchical model including niche breadth) was assessed with the deviance information criterion (dic, spiegelhalter et al. 2002). the dic is similar to other information theoretic approaches (e.g., ak- aike information criterion, akaike 1974) where there is a trade-off between model complexity and a mea- sure of model ﬁt. the model with the lowest dic is considered the most parsimonious. to determine if both candidate models are plausible, we use the guidelines provided by burnham & anderson (1998) for aic where models with a difference in aic of 2 or less are considered. spiegelhalter et al. (2002) consider this approach at model selection to work reasonably well with dic. one critique of the dic is that it is subjected to monte carlo sampling error (spiegelhalter et al. 2002). to evaluate if this error is affecting our estimates of dic, we re-ran the models with different starting values. the dic estimates were nearly identical; therefore, we are conﬁdent that t a h t s e t a

model. results between 1980 and 2010, a total of 287 sampling events occurred. not all sites were sampled each year. the surveys resulted in 169,056 individual ﬁsh representing 65 species (table 1). seven sites were sampled with a boat electroﬁshing unit and nine were sampled with a tote-barge electroﬁshing unit. fish included in the study ranged in niche breadth from 7 to 20 with a mean of 12.1 (sd = 2.7). the observed temporal change in the ﬁsh assem- blages was larger than 950 of the 1000 simulated tem- poral change values for all sites except whi-331.5 (i.e., observed temporal change was not within the 95% con- ﬁdence intervals of the null model, table 2). this sug- gests that the abundance of some species is changing more rapidly than would be expected from sampling effects and undetected species. the highest observed temporal trends, or most variable trends in species abundance, were at whi-318.8 and whi-310.7 while whi-322.4 and whi-304.4 exhibited the most homog- enous trends among species. the estimated number of undetected species ranged from 1 to 12. eight of the most parsimonious models describing the rate of change in species abundances included our estimates of niche breadth (table 3). the ddic for the remaining eight models were >2 indicating that niche breadth did not improve the model. gear type was split between the base model (four tote- barge and four boat) and extended model (ﬁve tote- barge and three boat). seven of the eight sites that were best described by the extended model were directly adjacent to low-head dam impoundments. site

are characterised by a slow rate of posi- tive change or decreasing while more specialist species are characterised by a high rate of positive change or increasing. 289 stephen j. jacquemin & jason c. doll fig. 4. posterior distribution of x (niche breadth parameter) estimated from the eight-two-level hierarchical models. forty-ﬁve species decreased in abundance at a minimum of one site and 30 species increased in abundance (table 1). there were substantial differ- ences among sites due to site heterogeneity (table 2). the observed temporal change ranged from 0.177 to 24.394 and did not indicate an obvious trend. the wide range in temporal scores suggests increased var- iation in species abundances within sites. multiple species resulted in variation for the direction of change in abundance at most sites (table 1). for example, there was a 97.5% probability that blunt- nose minnow decreased in abundance at seven sites species only and increased at ﬁve sites. other decreased in abundance or remained constant, or increased in abundance or remained constant. the species with a 97.5% probability of decreasing in abundance included longear sunﬁsh (16 sites), white sucker (13 sites), northern hog sucker (12 sites), cen- tral stoneroller (12 sites), common carp (11 sites) and creek chub (11 sites). the species with a 97.5% probability of increased abundance includes bluegill (11 sites), mimic shiner (11 sites), redhorse spp. (10 sites), smallmouth bass (8 sites), silver shiner (8 sites) and steelcolor shiner (8 sites). longear sunﬁsh was the only species with the same trend at all sites. in addition, several species showed no consistent fig. 5. relationship between the estimated annual rate of change in abundance (r’) and normalized niche breath values for

to habitat and niche breadth change (table 1). overall, generalist species such as the bluntnose minnow increased at 5 sites, decreased at 7 sites and did not change at 4 sites. specialist spotﬁn shiner increased at 6 sites, decreased at 6 sites and did not change at 3 sites. such as species the discussion fish assemblages of white river have experienced notable changes during the past 30 years (1980– 2010). despite the local scale of the study (50 km reach), however, all sites did not result in similar pat- terns of species increase or decrease. in total, more species decreased in abundance (32) than increased (14) across all study sites. disentangling the relative inﬂuence of study scale in assemblage and commu- nity assembly studies is a current interest in ecology (pease et al. 2011) as identiﬁcation of a relevant scale can be difﬁcult and is frequently categorised roughly as local or regional. hierarchical framework models generally support regional factors (e.g., species rich- ness, climate) as primary community determinants and local scale habitat (e.g., heterogeneity) as second- ary community determinants (angermeier & winston 1998; hoeinghaus et al. 2007; pease et al. 2011). our hierarchical framework suggested credible changes in population abundances at all sites. however, there were substantial differences among sites due to site heterogeneity (table 2). thus, the observed temporal change did not indicate an obvious trend. the wide range in temporal scores suggests increased variation in species abundances within sites. overall changes in abundance were not conserved across species and sites. our population models indi- cate an overall abundance decrease at over half the sites for longear sunﬁsh, striped shiner, white sucker, common carp, central stoneroller, creek chub, spotted sucker and northern hog sucker. abundances of bluegill and mimic shiner increased at a comparable number of sites. kanehl et al. (1997) and others asso- ciated the decrease in abundances of tolerant species such as common carp, white sucker and spotted sucker with improved habitat quality. however, the concurrent decline of sensitive species such as north- ern hog sucker suggests that a simple interpretation is not warranted. we expected greater yearly changes in abundance among specialist taxa compared with gen- eralist taxa. deviation from this expected result may suggest that the habitat of the white river has not changed over the past 30 years. the overall when niche breadth was included as a model parameter, temporal trends within our hierarchical model was improved. we identiﬁed a negative relationship between rate of change in abundance per year and niche breadth. explanation of within our interestingly, this improvement this was the opposite trend than predicted in our hypothesis. the inverse relationship between the rate of change in abundance and niche breadth indi- cates that specialised species increased in abundance disproportionately to generalist species (fig. 5). for example, of the species that were changing in abun- dance at whi-314.8, generalist species (e.g., white sucker and common carp) were declining in abundance while only specialist species (e.g., mimic shiner and steelcolor shiner) increased in abun- dance. this trend is contrary to our expectations and likely indicates that an additional unmeasured factor is inﬂuencing local ﬁsh assemblages over the past 30 years. in model explanation by incorporating niche breadth as a species attribute was only noted in sites imme- diately adjacent to low-head dams. study area, ﬁve low-head dam impoundments (1.5 to 2.0 metre height) potentially restrict upstream movement of ﬁsh during normal pool. we suggest that low-head dams are altering the ﬁsh assemblages and contributing to the variation among sites. this provides additional evidence for potential impacts of stream impoundments. cumming (2004) reported a modiﬁcation in physical and chemi- cal water quality parameters that reduced stability and species richness along an impounded river. in addition, nislow et al. (2011) reported that dispersal limitations were associated with impoundments, resulting in variation in abundance of species among sites asymmetrically. repeated impoundment structures create homogenous stretches of degraded habitat (santucci jr. et al. 2005). despite distinct improvements in water quality (doll 2011) following passage of the clean water act (1972), improvements in physical habitat have been limited by multiple low-head impoundments. ﬂuctuated that these impoundment barriers have the potential to restrict movements of ﬁsh with only brief connec- tions during periods of high ﬂow (haponski et al. 2007). we speculate that unaccounted for variability in the rate of change for individual species at such a local scale indicates that ﬁsh in the white river exhi- bit a degree of source sink dynamics, such as described for metapopulations (levins 1970; hanski & gilpin 1991). metapopulation dynamics have been used to describe highly fragmented and spatially structured populations that are governed by extinction and colonisation (gotelli & taylor 1999; larned et al. 2010). one caveat to this interpretation, how- ever, is that the local scale of the study and connec- tivity and colonisation effects. however, metapopulation struc- turing has been shown to result from the presence of dams such as low-head impoundments (e.g., see matsubara et al. 2001). extinction preclude likely strict 291 stephen j. jacquemin & jason c. doll in summary, we identiﬁed both conserved and dis- parate species abundance trends among individual local sites and showed that niche breadth can be used to explain assemblage trends. given the 30 year timescale, it seems unlikely that these results are sto- chastic, but rather are likely mechanistic. gotelli et al. (2010) suggested an extension of their bayesian hierarchical model to include covariates to increase explanatory power. our study is the ﬁrst to our knowledge to incorporate niche breadth as an explan- atory component of species-speciﬁc intrinsic rate of increase. we tested this approach through the addition of grinnellian niche breadth as a species level parameter that improved our understanding of assemblage shifts at half of our sites. this suggests that a substantial component of local scale variation among sites is based on habitat afﬁnities. possible explanations abundance variation that were observed that was not due to niche breadth includes imperfect detection (due to sampling conditions and/ or investigators), variability in sampling year (not every site was sampled every year), biotic interac- tions, chemical improvements of water quality, degree of site connectedness and habitat heterogene- ity. other possible confounding factors inﬂuencing variation in the intrinsic rate of increase include body size or generation length. for in our study, body size and generation length were not consistent with time across sites. previous studies have demonstrated positive covariation of niche breadth with body size (pyron 1999). furthermore, a post hoc analysis testing for a relationship between intrinsic rate of increase and niche breadth at each site did not discern a relationship (results not pre- sented here). however, further study on the relation- ship between intrinsic rate of increase and niche breadth should be undertaken. in addition, the incon- sistent collection years complicate formally account- ing for temporal autocorrelation in the model. temporal autocorrelation can have a signiﬁcant effect on the population growth rate and variance; however, the magnitude of effect depends on environmental perturbations and variability within the population (tuljapurkar & haridas 2006). highly variable popu- lations are not as strongly impacted by perturbation and not inﬂuenced as strongly by temporal autocorre- lation (tuljapurkar & haridas 2006). if temporal autocorrelation were severe, the null model analysis would not have detected a signiﬁcant deviation of among-species variability in temporal trends from a simple model of sampling processes (i.e., not all spe- cies are following a similar temporal trend). how- ever, perturbations such was ﬂooding could inﬂuence the affect of temporal autocorrelation. additional work would beneﬁt by adding hydrological variables to the model. 292 we suggest that further incorporation or reﬁnement of attributes beyond habitat afﬁnities may improve explanatory power. for example, categorising taxa based on functional or ecological categories (jacque- min & pyron 2011) or rate of increase by ecological category may result in identiﬁcation of ecosystem processes and reduce possible noise attributed to uncommon or speciﬁc species. acknowledgements we recognise john
