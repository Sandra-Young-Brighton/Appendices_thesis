burgner et al. 1992). summer-run or “stream maturing” steel- head enter the sea as juveniles after one to two years, and typically spend two to three years at sea (everest 1973; pucket 1975; jones 1980; barnhart 1986). summer steelhead enter freshwater systems as reproductively immature adults as early as de- cember but typically enter riverine systems be- tween april and july (burgner et al. 1992; jones 1992, 1997). functional gonads develop in these stocks while holding up to 10 months in freshwater habitats (chilcote et al. 1980). as migrating adults, summer steelhead contain a higher percentage of body fat than winter steelhead, which is thought to contribute to gonad development and a fat re- serve for summer layover (smith 1968). both groups typically spawn from january to may and are iteroparous, i.e. capable of spawning more than once over several years before they die (shapovalov and taft 1954; burgner et al. 1992). in many pacific river systems both reproductive ec- otypes are known to occur (neave 1944; shapova- lov and taft 1954; withler 1966; smith 1968; sav- 159 nielsen 8z fountain vaitova et al. 1973; chilcote et al. 1980; burgner et al. 1992; busby et al. 1996). their distributions, however, often do not coincide in time or space (everest 1973; leider et al. 1984). climatic shifts and subsequent changes in flow conditions can de- termine the upper migratory limit for either life history type within a drainage. when both types occur sympatrically, however, summer steelhead usually spawn a significant distance upstream from where winter steelhead reproduce leading to repro- ductive isolation between the two ecotypes (roel- ofs 1983; behnke 1992). the two steelhead ecotypes occur sympatrically in the eel river drainage in northern california. while winter-run fish utilize large areas of this drainage for rearing and spawning, the middle fork eel river remains the only location where we currently find large numbers of summer-run fish (fig. 1). summer-run steelhead migrate each spring to the headwaters of the middle fork eel river in the yolla bolly wilderness of the mendo- cino national forest. summer-run migrations peak in may on the eel river (jones 1980). access to deep, thermally-stratified pools found in the middle fork eel river (i.e. summer-run steelhead habitat) is available to the fish only after transit of 190 km of the mainstem eel river. k san francisco \  fig i. map showing locations of sample collections taken from steelhead (uncorhynchus mykiss) in california for this study. 1 60 the middle fork eel river drains approximate- ly 1950 km2 of rugged mountainous terrain. this part of the river is characterized by high sediment loads, low summer flows, and elevated summer stream temperatures. in the yolla bolly wilderness area, summer steelhead hold and mature through- out the summer in approximately 22 km of steam punctuated by numerous deep, thermally stratified pools (>4m maximum depth). thermal refugia with water temperatures 323°c lower than ambi- ent stream temperatures found within these deep pools appear to be a critical summer habitat for the eel river run of summer steelhead (nielsen et al. 1994). several studies on the relative degree of repro- ductive isolation among different runs of steelhead have been published (smith 1968; utter et al. 1974; leider et al. 1984). electrophoretic investigations into summer and winter steelhead in other drain- ages have not indicated large genetic differences between sympatric populations (utter & allendorf 1977; chilcote et al. 1980; leider et al. 1984; niel- sen 1996). chromosome morphology also showed no differentiation between different spawning groups of steelhead (thorgaard 1977). recent dna studies have shown limited genetic diversity summer steelhead have been documented along the upper reaches of the middle fork eel river for the last 30 years by the california department of fish and game, with counts ranging from 198 (1966) to 1601 in 1981 (jones 1980 & 1992). anec- dotal accounts of summer steelhead found in the upper canyon of the middle fork eel river in the 1930s reported over 6000 fish (jones 1992). the number of live fish counted in 1997 (n=513) com- pares poorly to the official pre-1964 average of over 3500 fish (jones 1992 & 1997). in recent drought years (1991-1996), limited early-fall flows in the middle fork eel river often brought the distribution of summer and winter steelhead into close proximity during the fall mi- gration period, leading to questions of repro- ductive isolation between the ecotypes. speculation on the mechanisms leading to reproductive iso- lation between sympatric summer- and winter-run steelhead include smith’s hypothesis that “it is possible that summer steelhead may select mates and be prepared to defend spawning territories against winter steelhead which might arrive several months later than the summer fish in the same stream” (smith 1968, page 37). behavioral mech- anisms leading to reproductive isolation? however, are undocumented scientifically. it is also undeter- mined whether juvenile summer steelhead use dif- ferent rearing areas from winter-run fish within this system. no morphological characteristics can be used to separate the stocks at this age. table 1. list of steelhead collection sites and capture dates (year) for steel- head used in this study. %“=adults;

n= 50) collected by electrofishing in the middle fork eel river for the national marine fisheries status review of steelhead coast-wide (busby et al. 1996). we used winter-run steelhead (1991-1994; n=64) collected from nine northern california coastal streams along the mendocino coast (gualala, gar- cia, albion, navarro and ten mile rivers, and cottonwood, howard and usal creeks). these fish served as an outgroup in genetic distance analyses and to compare genetic diversity found between the two reproductive ecotypes within the middle fork eel river with that found in winter-run fish from geographically proximate drainages. microsatellites sixteen microsatellite loci were chosen for these analyses based on their high level of polymorph- ism in previous studies of rainbow trout and steel- head (0. mykiss). the omy-series of microsatellite loci was developed specifically for 0. mykiss; the onep-series was developed for sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka); ots-series for chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha); and the ssa- series was developed for atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). amplification of microsatellites followed the methods given in nielsen et al. (1997b), except that each 10-p1 pcr reaction contained 67 mm tris-hc1 (ph 8.8), 6.7 mm mgc12, 16.6 mm (nh4)$04, 10 mm j3-mercaptoethanol, 1 pm each of dgtp, datp, dttp, and dctp, 1 pm of each primer, 0.31 units of taq polymerase, and 1 pl of chelex-100 (bio-rad) extracted dna. for each locus, pcr conditions and the color of the fluorescently labeled reverse primer are listed in table 2. microsatellites were run out on a 6% poly- acrylamide gel. prior to loading the gel, 1 pl pcr product was added to 4 pl of loading buffer con- taining 1 pl of 50 mg/ml blue dextran in 25 mm table 2. pcr conditions used for amplifications of 16 microsatellite loci in middle fork eel river steelhead. primer concentrations for all reactions re- mained 1 pm throughout. mykiss a mykiss b locus annealoc 6fam-blue tet-green hex-yellow 52“ 30 cycles 52” 32 cycles onep14 o m 9 7 ssa439 omy77 onep2 omy207 otsl ssa85 ssal4 omy2 sfo8 onepll ssa289 omy325 onep8 ssa4 161 between the two ecotypes based on the allelic structure found in two microsatellite loci in the middle fork eel river stocks (nielsen 1996). a recent synthesis of genetic analyses suggested that the two steelhead ecotypes are not monophyletic, with coastal streams dominated by winter steel- head and inland steelhead of the columbia river basin dominated almost exclusively by summer steelhead (busby et al. 1996). in this article we present results of genetic analy- ses of summer- and winter-run steelhead from the middle fork eel river using 16 microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis of reproductive isolation be- tween the two sympatric ecotypes. support for this hypothesis is provided by analysis of molecular variance (amova), estimates of the number of migrants per generation (nm), genetic distance measures and estimated divergence time from their most recent common ancestor. material and methods sample collection adult steelhead samples were captured by hook- and-line, deep-water seine, or as incidental mor- talities from the upper middle fork eel river (1990-1998; table 1). summer steelhead holding in deep water pools on the middle fork eel river were captured along 22 km of stream in the yolla bolly wilderness area of the mendocino national forest by sein (n= 16) in august-september 1990 and by hook-and-line (n= 5 ) april-september 1991. additional summer steelhead tissues samples (n=46) were taken from adult summer-run mor- talities in 1998. these fish died due to low water levels below a migration barrier and temperature stress in one pool on the middle fork eel river (w. jones, personal communications). adult winter-run steelhead from the middle fork eel river (n= 13) below the junction with black butte river were captured by hook-and-line nielsen & fountain edta, 2.5 p1 of diformamide and 0.5 p1 of abi genescan 500 (applied biosystems). all microsatellite gels were on run an abi 373 adapted for microsatellite analysis according to recommendation by the manufacturer. microsatel- lite gels were read using abi prism’s geno- typer software (1996). all loci were run indi- vidually in separate pcr reactions to determine the average allelic size distributions for steelhead in the middle fork eel river. allele sizes reported here are equal to the size of the total product amplified (including amplified primer sequence). known 0. inykiss dna samples were rerun on each gel for size standardization with reference to an abi genescan-500 size marker ladder. to in- sure consistency in both pcr reactions and scor- ing of microsatellites, approximately 5% of all samples were re-amplified, run on different gels, and scored independently. analysis of heterozygosity and exact tests for hardy-weinberg equilibrium in microsatellite loci were performed using arlequin (schneider et al. 1997). fisher’s exact p-values associated with the probability of rejecting hardy-weinberg equi- librium by locus and by population were calculated using the markov chain method (guo & thomp- son 1992). population independence between sum- mer- and winter-run steelhead populations was tested using fisher’s exact tests, based on a mar- kov chain adaptation of row-by-column contin- gency tables (genepop v3.la; raymond & rousset 1997). tests of independence were run for each microsatellite locus independently and for all loci combined. genepop’s fisher’s exact tests have been shown to have several computational advantages in multi-loci analyses (raymond & rousset 1995). statistical significance levels for fisher’s exact analyses were set using sequential bonferroni tests (rice 1989). the estimated number of migrants (nm) was calculated between steelhead ecotypes on the middle fork eel river using the private allele method (slatkin 1985; barton & slatkin 1986) and with f,, (wright 1968). mean heterozygosity for the 16 microsatellite loci was calculated using microsat (minch 1997) available from dr. e. minch, stanford university (http://lotka.stanford.- edu/distance.html) with expected equilibrium values developed for the stepwise mutation pro- cesses (see rousset 1996). amova based on f,, values calculated between and within populations was performed using arlequin. two pairwise genetic distance matrices (nei’s distance (d; nei 1987) and goldstein et al.5 (1 995a) were calculated for microsatellite allelic di- versity in summer and winter middle fork eel river steelhead using mendocino coastal popula- tions (winter-run) as an outgroup. nei’s distance operates under the infinite allele model of muta- tion events. the (zip)* distance measure maintains an estimate of the mutation process under expec- tation of a strict, single-step (*one repeat unit) shift for each mutation event. delta mu distance measures were used to generate an unrooted con- sensus neighbor-joining tree using the neighb- or and consense applications from phylip v. 3.572 (felsenstein 1995) comparing microsatel- lite diversity among steelhead populations. repli- cate microsatellite distance trees (n = 1000) were generated to obtain bootstrap estimates and assess reproducibility of branching patterns found in the genetic distance tree. table 3. list of 16 microsatellites and their source publications amplified from summer and winter steelhead from middle fork eel river, 1990-1998. locus source m. o’connell personal communication m. o’connell personal communication morris et al. 1996 omy2 omy27 omy77 omy207 m. o’connell personal communication m. o’connell personal communication my325 schribner et al. 1996 onep2 schribner et al. 1996 onep8 schribner et al. 1996 onepll onep14 schribner et al. 1996 m. banks personal communication otsl angers et al. 1995 sfo8 mcconnell et al. 1995 ssa4 mcconnell et al. 1995 ssal4 o’reilly et al. 1996 ssa85 ssa289 mcconnell et al. 1995 ssos1439 slettan et al. 1995 number of allelic size range (bp) alleles 26 7 18 24 17 21 14 4 11 14 15 28 19 13 8 17 109-167 99-1 11 97-143 96460 87-1 33 110-290 144-188 137-147 145-171 159-243 176-286 161-241 120-168 105-153 108-124 120-154 results sixteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were amplified in the middle fork eel river steelhead populations (table 3). the number of alleles amplified per locus ranged from 4 to 28, and the allelic size ranged from 87 to 290 base pairs (bp). standard deviations (sd) around size estimates by allele ranged from 0.004 to 0.41 bases. average sd for microsatellite allele size was 0.24 bases, allowing tight binning of dimeric allelic structure without overlap for all 16 loci. arlequin’s analysis of hardy-weinberg equilibrium using the probability test on 16 micro- satellite loci for the two middle fork eel river steelhead populations supported a random union of gametes for all loci and both populations. locus specific heterozygosity ranged from 0.34 (onepl 1) to 0.92 (omy207). average heterozygosity for the 162 microsatellite diversity in summer and winter steelhead 16 loci was 0.76. fst values ranged from 0.5x10-5 (omy207) to 0.33 (onep14). mean f,, for all 16 loci combined was 0.01. unique diagnostic alleles occurring at >5% within any one populations were: summer-run omy2-149; onep8-152, onep14-145, ssa4-195 and 225, ssa85-147; win- ter-run omy2-153 and omy77-ill. we found sig- nificant year-to-year variation in molecular diver- sity for the 16 loci between collection years for summer or winter steelhead in the middle fork eel river, however, unequal sample size for each year class contributed significantly to this finding. fisher’s combined test of independence for all 16 loci showed significant differentiation between the two reproductive ecotypes (x2=infinity; df= 32; p<o.ool). amova analysis of allelic frequencies between summer and winter steelhead on the middle fork eel river showed that only 1% of the overall microsatellite allelic variance was attribu- table to run timing within this basin. variation among individuals within populations accounted for 18.3% of the overall variance. amova analy- ses including the mendocino coastal winter-run fish showed that 23% of the allelic variance was found among the three groups (summer-run middle fork eel river, winter-run middle fork eel river, and mendocino winter-run), with 75% of the overall allelic variance found within popula- tions. genetic distance between middle fork eel river summer and winter steelhead was (6~)~=2.74, sd= 1.15. nei’s distance in our comparisons of the middle fork eel river steelhead ecotypes was d = 0.035, sd=0.013. delta mu squared distance be- tween summer and winter steelhead in the middle fork eel river was 2.74, whereas genetic distance calculated between middle fork eel river winter- run and mendocino coastal winter-run was 4.26 (fig. 2). a consensus tree derived from nei’s gen- etic distance values gave the same architecture as the tree. branching patterns found in the consensus nj tree based on ( 6 ~ ) ~ distance separat- ing middle fork eel river ecotypes and mendoci- no coastal winter-run steelhead populations were supported by a high bootstrap values (>98%). estimates of the number of migrants (nm) used as a surrogate for gene flow between summer- and winter-run middle fork eel river steelhead calcu- lated with the private allele method was 5.15 indi- viduals per generation and 16.3 based on f,, values for the 16 microsatellite loci. using the regression equation developed by goldstein et al. (1995b) be- tween distance measures and time since diver- gence, we calculated the time since the split be- tween the summer and winter steelhead in the middle fork eel river to be approximately 16000 to 28000 years. 99 1- 1 98 i i i middle fork eel river summer steelhead middle fork eel river winter steelhead mendocino coastal winter steelhead fig. 2. consensus neighbor-joining tree derived from genetic distance data (sp)’ between two steelhead populations from the middle fork eel river representing sympatric reproductive eco- types, summer and winter steelhead and coastal stock from mendocino county, california. bootstrap values (%) were gen- erated from 1000 replicate trees. dlscusslon due to extensive differences in morphology (i.e. body fat), coloration, migration timing, adult freshwater habitat use, and reproductive develop- ment, summer-run steelhead have always been con- sidered a separate stock or “race” by fishermen, scientists, and resource managers (everest 1973, jones, 1980; freese 1982; ward 1988; nakamoto 1994). despite the fact that previous allozyme studies have demonstrated limited or no isolation between sympatric populations of summer- and winter-run steelhead, the summer-runs have been managed as separate stocks in the wild and in hatcheries in many rivers due to the unique charac- teristics that reside within this group of fish (chil- cote et al. 1980, leider et al. 1984, chilcote et al. 1986). without genetic evidence, however, it is dif- ficult to prove reproductive isolation between sum- mer- and winter-run steelhead and place a scale on their divergence in evolutionary terms for conser- vation purposes (waples 1995). many examples in the literature suggest that genotypic and phenotypic life history variation oc- cur at multiple scales (stearns 1976; healey & prince 1995). genetic adaptation to local environ- mental conditions is thought to have evolved in salmon because of their homing behavior, but when divergent phenotypes occur within the same drainage the evidence of local adaptation becomes more complex. lineage differentiation in life his- tory patterns and reproductive performance in closely related fishes have been demonstrated using genetics in several studies (gall & gross 1978; mckay et al. 1986; danzmann et al. 1986; wangi- la & dick 1988; skaala & nzevdal 1989; clarke et al. 1992; ferguson 1996: bernatchez et al. 1996). other studies, however, have shown cases of par- allel life history evolution in reproductive timing 163 nielsen & fountain among geographically separate stocks, suggesting that divergent patterns within a drainage or basin may represent recent adaptations to local con- ditions (hindar et al. 1991; wood 1995; reznick & bryga 1996; taylor et al. 1996). specific to salmonids, the parallel evolution model is consist- ent with the anadromous form as a colonizer of new habitats and resident forms that evolve inde- pendently several times in each species (allen- dorf & waples 1996). either model (lineage diver- gence and separation over time or parallel life his- tory evolution) may be true for subpopulation structure based on migration timing. evidence of the degree of genetic separation found between the summer- and winter-run steelhead in the middle fork eel river can be used to support separation of these stocks based on a temporal scale and give insight into the evolutionary causes or structure of their separation. an important component of the conservation of a population or species is the recognition that evol- utionary divergence is a dynamic system with markers acting across many different spatial and temporal scales (nielsen et al. 1997a). with the ad- vent of new technologies for dna amplification and analyses, the goal of population genetic studies must be to integrate various scales of infor- mation across populations to set parameters needed to fit general conservation or management strategies (nielsen 1995; tessier et al. 1995; allen- dorf & waples 1996). dna mutation rates are known to vary exten- sively among genes and across taxa (wilson et al. 1977; nei 1987; takahata & slatkin 1984; weber & wong 1993; avise 1994; rubinsztein et al. 1995). unique changes based on nucleotide substitution or insertions or deletions for dna sequence are un- likely to be due to complex physiological or life his- tory variables such as body size, generation time or timing of first reproduction (martin & palumbi 1993; rico et al. 1996). with highly variable rates of mutation and no evidence of selective constraints, allozymes, mtdna sequence, and nuclear micro- satellite data can represent three very different tem- poral or biogeographic scales for any given popula- tion (boyce et a]. 1996; nielsen et al. 1997a). in assessing the usefulness of genetic markers for addressing population structure, we need to con- sider changes in parameter values specific to the population in question, the accuracy of analyses available from each molecular marker, and the marker’s ability to describe evolutionary change on a scale the population has responded to. while some researchers suggest that only congruent mol- ecular structures be used to establish conservation units (moritz 1994), there is no rational expec- tation of congruence among markers with diver- 164 gent scales where past selective events are not necessarily consistent with population history or structure (boyce et al. 1996). a high degree of length polymorphism has been found in microsatellite loci for many species (bru- ford & wayne 1993; ashley & dow 1994). poly- morphism at homologous microsatellite loci appear generally higher in species closely related to the original source species for which the conserved primers were developed (fitzsimmons et al. 1995; nielsen 1996; rico et al. 1996). higher mutation rates for microsatellite loci increase polymorphism and have a large effect on the analysis of genetic dis- tance parameters. therefore, microsatellite allelic frequency data are very useful for studying evol- utionary relationships in closely related populations (goldstein et al. 1995a; takezaki & nei 1996). microsatellites may allow detection of population differences where allozymes and mtdna do not (tessier et al. 1997; estoup et al. 1998). our findings of significant genetic separation between summer- and winter-run middle fork eel river steelhead at the microsatellite scale suggest relatively recent di- vergence between these populations. slatkin estimates of the number of migrants between the two reproductive ecotypes found in the middle fork eel river were large enough to retain muta- tion-drift equilibrium between the populations based on the one-migrant-per-generation rule (one-migrant-per-generation; 1985; mills & allendorf 1996), since even low levels of migration will retard population differentiation and obscure the effects of genetic drift (goldstein et al. 1995b; slatkin 1985). theoretical predictions versus real-world applications of this rule, how- ever, were questioned from the start (wright 193 l). in their recent review of the one-migrant-per-gen- eration rule, mills and allendorf (1996) suggest recommendations for consideration in estimating the number of migrants necessary to sustain pan- mixia between populations. their recommendation of 1-10 mpg is based on factors that often con- tradict the underlying assumptions of the rule. high estimates of nm between summer- and win- ter-run steelhead in the middle fork eel river sug- gest significant gene flow between these groups. exceptions to the one-migrant-per-generation rule discussed by mills and allendorf (1996) in- cluded conditions where movement between popu- lations is in the form of a pulse of several individ- uals every several generations, such as the poten- tial reproductive overlap between summer- and winter-run steelhead in the middle fork eel river during late fall drought conditions if we exclude the possibility of behavioral isolation proposed by smith (1968). during drought cycles the upstream migration of the summer stock is effectively block- ed and some members of both populations may end up spawning in the same place at the same time. under such conditions, mills & allendorf (1996) suggest that up to 10 migrants per gener- ation is not likely to cause uniformity of allelic fre- quencies across subpopulations. our estimate of nm calculated from f,, exceeded even the 10-mpg rule for summer and winter steelhead in the middle fork eel river. comparisons of genetic diversity made with geo- graphically proximate coastal steelhead stocks from mendocino demonstrated the relative degree of differentiation found between the middle fork eel river reproductive ecotypes. it is clear from our microsatellite analyses that both reproductive ecotypes found in the middle fork eel river are more closely related to each other than they are to winter-run steelhead from adjacent drainages. these data support a pattern of parallel evolution in steelhead reproductive ecotypes in the middle fork eel river, probably derived from recent ad- aptations to local conditions. the suitability of any molecular marker to de- pict correct relationships among different popula- tions depends on the scale at which differentiation is required for conservation or management. there are numerous cases reported in the literature where contradictory relationships were generated based on different molecular markers (jarne & logda 1996 and literature therein). in several studies microsatellite data have shown genetic indepen- dence in populations limited by size or time since divergence (shriver et al. 1993; estoup et al. 1995). more recently, microsatellites have demonstrated a much higher efficiency and power in statistical tests for differentiation among populations when com- pared to other molecular markers (barker et al. 1997; estoup et al. 1998). significant microsatellite allelic frequency differences were found between the middle fork eel river summer and winter steelhead using several statistical tests in this study. how we judge this unique genetic diversity in re- productive ecotypes within a drainage in relation- ship to overall species diversity on an evolutionary scale is an important question in our management and protection of this species. phylogenetic analyses of microsatellite distance data have been used with mixed results by many recent studies (bowcock et al. 1994; shriver et al. 1995; nielsen et al. 1997a, b; boyce et al. 1997). dating of evolutionary divergence between closely related populations based on microsatellite diver- sity, however, remains controversial. goldstein et al. (1995b) used 30 microsatellite polymorphisms and a pedigree-based estimate of mutation rate as 5.6x to estimate the time of separation be- tween african and non-african humans. in this accepting the caveat that many microsatellite loci are required to estimate true separation times with and that the relationships given in goldstein et al. 1995b were developed from human microsatellite data (no equivalent pedigree based data is currently available for 0. mykiss), we used the regression correlation between genetic distance and time of goldstein et al. and assumed a 3-year generation time for steelhead to estimate the time of divergence between the summer- and winter-run steelhead in the middle fork eel river to be ap- proximately 16,000 to 28,000 years ago. this esti- mate is congruent with a relatively recent evol- utionary divergence of microsatellite loci between the reproductive ecotypes in the late pleistocene. accepting a recent divergence, it is not unex- pected to find limited differentiation between the middle fork eel river steelhead populations based on allozymes and mtdna (see nielsen 1996). mitochondria1 dna is thought to represent mid to late pleistocene differentiation in most ver- tebrates. recent analyses in birds, however, shows that mtdna divergence can extend much further back than the pleistocene (klicka & zink 1997). both allozymes and mtdna may have been con- served in both middle fork eel river steelhead ecotypes for long periods of time. differentiation of these stocks with microsatellite markers is most likely due to accelerated mutation rates in micro- satellite loci and the likelihood that these three genetic systems may have been affected by different evolutionary processes within this drainage. considering their recent divergence and possible interbreeding during cyclical drought conditions in the middle fork eel river, the fact that we were able to demonstrate significant genetic differences using 16 microsatellite loci supports a level of re- productive isolation between these two sympatric ecotypes in this basin that should be considered in conservation and management for this species. at the very least, these findings suggest the implemen- tation of a conservative approach to population management for steelhead in the middle fork eel river. under this approach, each reproductive eco- type would be considered a separate evolutionary unit and efforts should be taken to maintain viable populations and habitat for both. enhancement efforts that retain the unique genetic identity of these stocks should be considered a first priority. microsatellite diversity in summer and winter steelhead study the genetic distance measure ( 6 ~ ) ~ was shown to be linear with time having a slope equal to 2 times the average mutation rate across loci. resumen 1. estudiamos, empleando 16 loci microsatelites, la diferencia- cion genetica de dos ecotipos reproductivos de oncorhynchus 165 nielsen & fountain mykiss del rio middle fork eel (california). doce de 10s loci estudiados presentaron diferencias significativas en la frecuen- cia alelica (test exacto de fisher: r0.05). la f,, para 10s 16 loci de ambas poblaciones combinadas fuc 0.01 y la heterocigo- sidad media fue 0.76. el test combinado de fisher para 10s 16 loci mostro diferencias significativas (p<o.ool) entre 10s ecoti- pos de verano e invierno en el rio. 2. la distancia genetica basada en la estructura alelica entre 10s ecotipos de verano e invierno en el rio, fue ( s ~ ) ~ = 2 . 7 4 (nei’s d=0.035), mientras que la distancia genetica equivalente cal- culada para 10s dos ecotipos del rio y para 10s precedentes de la costa de mendocino (california) fue ( 6 ~ ) ~ = 0 5.16 (d de nei 0.378). 3. el analisis de la varianza molecular (amova) indico que solo el iyo de la varianza alelica total contribuyo a las diferencias entre las dos ecotipos. la variacion entre individuos del mismo ecotipo fue del 18.2%. el numero de migrantes por generacion para 10s dos ecotipos del rio vari6 entre 5.15 (metodo dei alelo privado) y 16.3 individuos por generacion (metoso f j . 4. el periodo de divergencia entre ambos ecotipos del rio basa- do en correlaciones publicadas entre la diversidad de alelos mi- crosatelite y el tiempo, es de 16,000-28,000 aiios. ello indica la existencia de divergencia entre 10s dos ecotipos reproductores, simpatricos en la cuenca del rio costero, a pesar de que estas publaciones estan mas relacionadas entre si que con otras po- blaciones anadromas geograficamente proximas, a lo largo de la costa californiana. acknowledgments numerous people were instrumental in collecting tissue, clarify- ing analytical and laboratory techniques or performing labora- tory analyses for this study. we
