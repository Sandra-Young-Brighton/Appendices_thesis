1999 abstract -we present results from an experiment testing for the existence of genetically based phenotypic differences among populations of brown_trout (sulmo trutta l.) born and raised under entirely natural environ- mental conditions. genetically tagged individuals from two stocks (a and b) were introduced into a drainage system in sweden previously void of brown_trout, and the first generation (f,) progeny were sampled from two lakes during nine consecutive years. phenotypic differences among groups of progeny (a, b, and the ab hybrid) are expected to reflect genetically determined dissimilarities between the introduced stocks. phenotypic dif- ferences among progeny groups were observed for age at maturity and for migratory and reproductive behavior, and these characters are appar- ently determined by genetic factors to an extent that permit their detec- tion even in the presence of confounding and naturally occurring sources of variation such as lake, age, cohort and year of sampling. there was also significant variation among offspring groups with respect to body size (length), but only a small proportion of the total variation in size could be attributed to stock differences. these genetically based stock character- istics may represent local adaptations, and the fishery management im- plications of these findings are discussed. s. palm, n.

the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for variation in pheno- typic characters is important in the contexts of management, conservation and evolutionary bio- logy. during the past few decades, the application of molecular genetic techniques has contributed a wealth of information regarding the distribution of genetic variation within and among natural popu- lations in a large number of species (e.g. avise 1994). nevertheless, studies using molecular tech- niques have added relatively little to our under- standing of the genetic basis for variation in phenotypic traits (lewontin 1991). for example, it is largely unclear to what extent differences among natural populations at “biochemical loci” reflect differentiation at loci influencing various morpho- logical, physiological and behavioral character- istics (e.g. hard 1995; lynch 1996). salmonid fishes are characterized by the exist- ence of numerous local populations which often exhibit a large degree of genetic differentiation at loci that can be studied by means of molecular techniques (allendorf & utter 1979; ryman & ut- ter 1987). likewise, the existence of striking phenotypic differences among local populations of salmonids has long been a well established fact (e.g. alm 1939; behnke 1972, ricker 1972; hindar et al. 1991). although it is commonly believed that much of the observed variation in morphology and life-history characteristics among conspecific salmonid populations represents adaptations to lo- cal environments, this presumption is typically based on little direct evidence (e.g. hindar et al. 1991, taylor 1991). a basic problem associated with the demon- stration of local adaptation is to show unambigu- ously that population differences with respect to phenotypic characters affecting fitness (i.e. charac- ters thought to be under selection) have a genetic basis. the reason for this problem is that most 169 palm & ryman quantitative traits are known to also be influenced by environmental factors (falconer 1989; roff 1997). in fishes the difficulties encountered when trying to clarify the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors may be particularly pronounced because fishes typically exhibit higher levels of phenotypic variability and lower herita- bilities than other vertebrates such as mammals and birds (allendorf et al. 1987). in spite of this obvious lack of information on the genetic basis for observed phenotypic differ- ences among local stocks, fisheries management to a large extent focuses on morphological traits such as body weight and length. when selecting ma- terial for stocking, for example, donor populations which display fast growth and large adult size in their original environment have traditionally been preferred. this preference is typically based on the assumption that the growth pattern is genetically determined and that the population will maintain its characteristics in a new environment. empirical evidence for such a presumption is generally lack- ing, however. here we present results from a “common gar- den” experiment testing for the existence of genet- ically determined phenotypic differences between two populations of brown_trout (sulmo truttu l.) introduced into a water system previously void of this species. the transplanted stocks originate from two geographically isolated lakes and exhibit behavioral and ecological differences in their orig- inal environments. they are also genetically diver- gent at several allozyme loci, and at one locus they were fixed for different alleles which made it poss- ible to identify their first-generation progeny with respect to parental stock origin (genetic marking). the fact that the offspring from the transplanted fish had spent their entire life under environmental conditions as identical as can possibly be obtained under natural conditions permitted us to test for genetically based stock differences for a number of phenotypic traits. genetically and ecologically distinct stocks of arti- ficially introduced brown_trout. the study was performed in two small and inter- connected mountain lakes, lilla and stora baver- vattnet (lakes i and 11; fig. l), belonging to the river indalsalven drainage system. the elevation is 698 and 668 m, respectively, which corresponds roughly to the tree line in this area. both lakes are shallow (average depths less than 5 meters), oligo- trophic, and generally covered by ice from novem- ber until may or june. prior to the brown_trout introduction, the only fish species present in the upper part of the water system was arctic char (sulvelinus alpinus l.). previous studies have shown that lakes i and i1 harbored large popula- tions of small-sized (stunted) char with average weights of about 50 and 95 g, respectively (unpub- lished data). natural brown_trout populations are present below a waterfall located about 6 km downstream of the study area (fig. 1). in the summer of 1979 a total of 1000 fry (age 0+) fronk each of the two parental stocks a and b (see below) were introduced at two locations up- stream of lake i (fig. 1). a total of 500 fry from each stock (a and b) was introduced simul- taneously at each location in order to treat both stocks as similar as possible. the released fish ap- pear to have spawned for the first time in 1982, and the fish analyzed in this study represent the f1 progeny born (hatched) during 1983-1988 and caught in lakes i and i1 during the period 1988- 1996. \ i \lake i1 lake i u ofstocks a and b

environment between genetically divergent stocks which were ecologically and morphologically dis- tinct in their original environments. more specifi- cally, we wanted i) to compare a “local” stock with a non-local one, and ii) one of the stocks to repre- sent a population with a solid reputation for being “large-sized” in order to focus on a character that is generally considered of great importance in the context of management. in addition, we wanted the stocks to be fixed for different alleles at (at least) one locus to permit identification of single progeny fish with respect to parental stock origin. population a is a landlocked hatchery stock originally derived from lake kallsjon, a large lake (156 km2; elevation 380 m) located about 100 km west of the study area. this stock has been used extensively for stocking in this area of sweden, and it is renowned for being a “very large-sized stock with weights in the range 12-14 kg” (bergman et al. 1989, p. 51). in its original environment this population was piscivorous, it matured at a rela- tively late age, and had a potential for long dis- tance migration (ryman et al. 1986). initiation of hydroelectric exploitation during the early 1940s resulted in reduced water flow in the river provid- ing the natural spawning area for this population (river kallstrommen, the major inlet to lake kallsjon). since then, the number of returning spawners declined steadily, and in the early 1980s the stock was considered extinct in the wild. from spawners collected a hatchery stock representing population a was founded in river kallstrommen in the early 1940s and onwards for production of fish for stocking to compensate for the loss of natural reproduction. the stock has been maintained by stripping fish raised to ma- turity in the hatchery and by collecting additional spawners from the river kallstrommen (personal communication, po. jonsson, indalsalvens vatten- regleringsforetag, ostersund, sweden). during the first 10 year period, an average of about 35 female and 20 male large-sized wild spawners (average weight about 6 kg) appears to have been stripped each year. the steady decline of the natural popu- lation resulted in continuously fewer wild spawners being used, and after the early 1950s such fish were available only occasionally. population b represents a landlocked “local” stock originating from one of the lakes falpfjalltjarnarna, a small mountain lake (< 1 km2; elevation 645 m) located only about 10 km north of the study area. the ecological and morphological characteristics of this population transplanted brown_trout are typical for brown_trout inhabiting thousands of similar small lakes in the mountain area of northern scandinavia. this trout feeds mainly on insects and other invertebrates, grows slowly, only rarely attains a weight exceeding about 0.5 kg, and matures at a rather early age (ryman et al. 1986). lakes falpfjalltjarnarna and lake kallsjon be- long to the upper parts of neighboring major drainage systems (river anger manalven and river indalsalven, respectively) that both drain into the baltic sea. the source populations (a and b) are separated by more than 500 km of waterway (in- cluding creeks, streams, lakes, rivers, and water- falls) that most likely has prevented gene flow be- tween them since about the end of the most recent period of glaciation (5000-9000 years ago). previous electrophoretic studies had shown that stocks a and b exhibit significant allele frequency differences at several protein coding loci (unpub- lished data). at one particular locus (g3pdh-2; earlier denoted agp-2, coding for a-glycero- phosphate dehydrogenase; e.g. st&hl & ryman 1982) stock a was close to fixation for the 100 al- lele, whereas two alleles (100 and 50) segregated at about equal frequencies in stock b. the g3pdh-2 locus was used to genetically mark the fish released in the study area such that stocks a and b were homozygous for different alleles (100/100 and 50/ 50, respectively). extensive electrophoretic screening of the stock a progeny that hatched in 1979 indicated fixation for the 100 allele in this year-class, which made it possible to use such fish for release within the experiment (they were all 100/100 homozygous). the hatchery records do not permit assessment of the number of male and female spawners used to produce the batch of progeny from which the 1000 fish to be released were sampled; however, the in- formation available indicates that more than 100 stock a potential breeders (males + females) were accessible in the preceding fall (1978), and that over 100,000 eggs were produced. within stock b wild spawners were collected and caged in the field during the spawning season in september 1978. the fish were transported alive to the hatchery where stripping and protein electro- phoresis was performed (see stahl & ryman 1982, for details). a total of 102 spawners from stock b were genotyped, and the electrophoretic analysis identified 6 females and 11 males as 50/50 homozy- gotes. all of these 17 individuals were used to pro- duce fish for release. the number of males used to fertilize each female varied between 1 and 5. both stocks were handled by the same hatchery (bonashamdsemlan) from stripping and onwards. during the spring of 1979 the newly hatched fry from stock a and b were exposed to slightly 171 palm & ryman heated water in order to speed their growth and thereby increase the initial survival in the wild. in late july the 1000 fry from each stock were trans- ported to the study area by helicopter in water tanks bubbled with oxygen. materials by means of gill netting approximately 100 trout have been collected annually (july-september) from each lake starting in 1988 in lake i and 1989 in lake 11. in each lake a set of 10-15 sinking gill nets was set overnight at depths varying from 0.5 to 5 m at roughly the same places every year; the nets were 27-30 m long and 1.5 m high with mesh sizes ranging from 1.65 to 3.40 cm. in most cases one night of gill netting was sufficient to obtain the targeted number of fish (100 from each lake), but in some years one or two additional nights were required. for each fish we measured body weight (to the nearest 5 g) and total length (to the nearest 0.5 cm), determined sex and maturation (breeding the year of collection or not; recorded since 1989j, and collected otoliths for age determi- nation as well as tissue samples for protein electro- phoresis (white skeletal muscle, eye, and liver; jor- de & ryman 1996). this study deals with a total of 1187 fish repre- senting the first generation of progeny (f,) from the introduced fish. in this generation only three groups of progeny are possible, viz. the zoo/zoo and 50/50 homozygotes derived from matings within stocks a and b, respectively, and the “hy- brid” 100/50 heterozygotes resulting from matings between stocks (subsequently referred to as groups a, b, and ab). there are two reasons for re- stricting the present analysis to the fi generation; ij most of the fish that have been caught by now (1996) can be classified as representing this gener- ation with a high degree of reliability, and ii) in subsequent generations (f2 and later) additional groups will most likely occur as a result of back- crosses (e.g. a xab) making group identification less straightforward. fish born in the period 1983- 1988 were considered to belong to the fi gener- ation; this criterion for classification was based on observations on the year for the first appearance of an f1 fish and on the earliest age of breeding noted for that generation. statistical analysis statistical comparisons between groups a, b, and ab are complicated because several confounding factors such as age, locality, and sex have a signifi- cant effect - separately and in combination on body size and other variables of interest. in ad- ~ 172 dition, the present data set is markedly unbalanced with respect to the number of fish observed within groupings corresponding to the various sources of variation. therefore, in order to avoid spurious significances we have in some instances applied several different procedures to test the same null hypothesis as explained in the context of the separ- ate comparisons. variance components for body size (length and weight) were assessed by means of both nested and factorial analyses of variance using satterthwaite’s approximation for unequal sample sizes when evaluating levels of significance (e.g. sokal and rohlf 1981). the computer programs applied were biom (rohlf 1987), spss 8.0 (1997), and stat- istica (1998). exact tests for random association of genes from stocks a and b were performed ac- cording to the procedures of vithayasai (1973). results fish representing each of the three f1 groups (a, b, and ab) were found in both lakes although the proportions of those groups differed between lakes (table 1; x2=286, df=2, p40.001). most strik- ingly, progeny from parents of stock b dominated in lake i whereas the majority of the fish in lake i1 descended from stock a parents. in lake 11, for example, the total number of fish representing a, ab, and b was 211, 166, and 67, respectively, and the proportion of genes contributed from stock a parents therefore 66% ([211 x2+ 166]/[2x444]), whereas the proportion of a-genes in lake i was only 25% (table 1). the relative contribution from the two stocks changed over time, however. the proportion of a-genes in- creased in both lakes over the period considered here, and the overall dominance of b-genes seems to be due largely to successful reproduction of stock b parents during the first few years. thus, it appears that stock b started reproducing earlier than stock a, and at this point it is unclear if the present representation of a and b will persist. this sample was to in both lakes there were significantly fewer hy- brids (group ab) than expected under random mating among the introduced fish with respect to stock origin (table 1). for the total of lake i, for instance, the proportions of genes contributed by a and b parents were 25% and 75%, respectively; under random mating we therefore expect 37.5% (2x0.25x0.75=0.375) of the progeny to be hybrids whereas only 27.1% (201/743) of the fish in this lake was found to be of the ab type (p40.001). the general deficiency of hybrids can be ex- plained either by non-random mating with respect to stock or by a lower survival of the hybrids (or some other selective mechanism resulting in the table 1. number of fish in the three groups of f, generation offspring (a, b, and ab) and results of exact tests (p) of the hypothesis that matings among the parents occurred at random with respect to stock origin (a or 8). expected numbers of fish under random mating are given in parentheses. f(a) is the frequency of genes from stock a. see text for details.

reduced hybrid survival. first, the latest two cohorts in lake i1 display a statistically significant hybrid excess (table 1) that is incompatible with a consistently lower survival in this group. second, we can see little or no indi- cation of differential survival after the fish have attained catchable size (age), and any conceivable difference among the offspring groups in this re- spect would actually hint at a slightly better sur- vival among hybrids (see below). in the absence of selection, non-random mating may result in either an excess or a deficiency of hybrids depending on the type of assortative mat- ing that occurs. preferential mating within stocks is expected to produce a deficit of hybrids, whereas the opposite behavior will lead to an excess. the overall deficiency of hybrids indicates that fish be- longing to the same stock have mated among themselves more frequently than would be ex- pected by chance. there are indications in both lakes, however, that this general tendency is be- coming weaker over time, and as noted above there is actually a significant excess of hybrids in lake i1 in the 1987 and 1988 cohorts (table 1). presently we can only speculate about the reason for this observation, but we note that the significant ex- cesses coincide with an almost complete absence of group b fish in these cohorts. the number of par- ents belonging to stock b may therefore have been fairly small for these cohorts, and it is possible that a skewed sex ratio among the b parents has re- sulted in more matings between fish of the different stocks. it should be noted, though, that care should be taken when interpreting the present type of data, where random mating between a small of number of parents may generate statistically sig- nificant deviations from theoretical expectations among the offspring solely due to the potentially large number of progeny produced from each mat- ing (allendorf & phelps 1981). body size the variability patterns for

presentation of results to those for length. as indicated by the growth curves (fig. 2), there appears to be a tendency for the hybrids to be somewhat larger than fish in groups a and b. the statistical comparison among groups is complicated, however, by the fact that body length is affected by virtually all factors that can be accounted for in the present data set. it is obvi- ous, for example, that the growth rate has been higher in lake i1 than in lake i (fig. 2). when analyzing the length variation statistically, we first treated each source of variation separately and assessed its relative importance by means of one-way analysis of variance disregarding any po- tential interactions. the magnitude of the relative variance components estimated in this way were 0.70, 0.07, 0.04, 0.02, and 0.02 for age, lake, co- hort, group (a, b, ab), and sex respectively, all of them being larger than zero at the p<o.ol signifi- cance level (also when applying the bonferroni correction for multiple testing; rice 1989). the sig- nificant effect of “group” in this initial analysis cannot be taken at face value, however, without taking the effect of other factors into account. ne- glecting the effect of lake on length, for example, may result in spurious significances if the fact that 174 the groups occur in different frequencies in the two lakes is disregarded (see below). in order to account for the effects of age, lake, cohort, and sex we collapsed the data set into col- lections of fish that were identical with respect to these four factors and tested for a trend with re- spect to the ranking of mean lengths among groups a, b, and ab within these collections. this procedure resulted in 45 collections of fish (the ma- jority from lake i) where all three groups were represented by at least one individual. group ab was found to have the largest mean body length in 22 of these 45 collections, whereas groups a and b were largest in 17 and 6 collections, respectively. the observed distribution (22: 17:6) deviates sig- nificantly from the uniform one (1 5: 15: 15) ex- pected under the null hypothesis of equal group means (x2=8.93, df=2, p<0.05). further, in an analogous comparison of groups a and b only, group a was found to have the largest mean body size in 38 out of 60 collections (x2=4.27, df=l, p<0.05). thus, there appears to be a true effect of “group” on size, the hybrids generally being largest and group b fish smallest. the length differences observed are fairly small in absolute terms, however. in order to provide a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of absolute size differences we computed the largest difference between offspring group means within each of the 91 collections with more than one group repre- sented (when only two groups were represented within a collection the difference between the cor- responding two means was also the largest one). the median value of these 91 "largest differences" is only 2.7 cm, the difference being smaller in young fish (median=o.8 cm in 9 collections of fish of age 3+) than among older ones (median=5.2 cm in 11 collections of fish of age 8+; cf. fig. 2). the relative importance of the various sources of variation was quantified by means of both nested and factorial analyses of variance (table 2). the presentation of estimates from both designs was chosen because it is not immediately obvious how to regard a data set like the present one with respect to alternatives such as design (nested vs. factorial), the hierarchical order of factors in the case of a nested design, and type of treatment (fixed vs. random). further, there is no universally "best" approach for both assessing variance com- ponents and testing their levels significance when the design is markedly unbalanced (e.g. shaw 1987). as seen from table 2, however, the overall results are reasonably consistent regardless of choice of approach. clearly, all the main factors considered (age, lake, cohort, offspring group, and sex) represent real sources of variation, age and lake being the most important ones which in combination ex- plain about 70% or more of the total variation (table 2). in contrast, the effect of the factor of transplanted brown_trout primary interest - offspring group - is fairly small and of the same approximate magnitude as those of cohort and sex (less than 5%). further, as indi- cated by the rightmost column of table 2, a con- siderable proportion of the variation is due to in- teractions rather than to plain additivity of the main effects. for example, there is no perfectly consistent relationship between the mean lengths of fish from groups a, b, and ab of the same age and lake that are born in different years (cohortx- offspring group interaction; see also fig. 2, right panels). similarly, the relation among groups is not the same at all ages (age x offspring group interac- tion; see also fig. 2, left panels). the variance components in table 2 were estimated using type i and i11 sums of squares (spss 1997) for the nested and factorial designs, respectively; applying a maximum-likelihood approach (ml or reml) yields estimates that are very similar. sex ratio and age at maturity the overall sex ratio was very close to 1:1, but there was a slight tendency towards a higher pro- portion of females in lake i than in lake i1 (52.6% vs. 46.8%; exact p=0.055). in contrast, there were no indications of different sex ratios among groups a, b, and ab within lakes or among age classes within the groups. males matured earlier than females in both lakes (table 3). further, there were indications of differ- ential age at maturity among offspring groups (a, b, and ab). the proportion of mature fish differed table 2.

individuals, group b the highest, whereas the ab fish tended to be inter- mediate, and this trend was consistent in both sex- es (table 3). there also was a tendency for mature fish to be somewhat older in group a than in the other two groups although this difference was not statistically significant within any combination of sex and lake. survival it is difficult to estimate age specific mortality rates in populations like the present ones which have not attained stable age distributions (e.g. vetter 1988), and we searched for indications of differential sur- vival through testing for age distribution differ- ences among the a, b, and ab groups. consider- ing the total material, there were no apparent ten- dencies of age differences among groups that would indirectly suggest the existence of different survival rates (the median age was 5 years in all groups). the information from this kind of com- parison of grand totals is restricted, however, with- out accounting for the variable contribution of groups to separate cohorts (table 1). thus, in a next step we attempted to reduce the effect of such potential bias through comparing the age of fish from the same lake that were born in the same year. this subdivision of data yielded 10 combi- nations of lake and cohort (excluding the 1983 co- hort in lake i1 that only comprised three fish). 176 contingency tests for independence between group and age within each of the ten lake-cohort combinations yielded four significant results (p<0.05, exact tests), and the binomial probability of obtaining that many significances by random chance is only about 0.001. thus, it appears that within separate cohorts the age distribution is not identical among groups. it is more difficult, how- ever, to identify a consistent direction for this lack of independence, possibly with the exception for a slight tendency of ab fish to be older than others. in three out of the four significant lake-cohort combinations the ab fish were older (mean and median age) than the a and b fish; similarly, vari- ance analyses, rank order, and median tests for identical mean ages (sokal & rohlf 1981) consist- ently identified ab as the oldest group in the ma- jority of lake-cohort combinations yielding statisti- cally significant results. all in all, however, the age differences are fairly small and commonly associ- ated with large standard errors. discussion this study is, to our knowledge, the first one that compares the performance of genetically distinct local populations of fish under environmental con- ditions which are both common and entirely natu- ral. further, by use of genetic marking and a water system previously void of the study species we have been able to make those comparisons over multiple lakes, cohorts, and years of sampling. previous ex- periments testing for genetically based phenotypic differences among salmonid populations have either i) been performed completely or partially under culture conditions, ii) been designed in a way that makes it difficult to separate the effects of a common environment from those of genetic fac- tors, or iii) included only a single or a very re- stricted number of cohorts and environmental con- ditions (e.g. alm, 1939; reisenbichler & mcintyre 1977; refstie & steine 1978; larsson et al. 1979a, b; svedang 1990; skulason et al. 1996; naslund & henricson 1996). before going into details it should be noted that our interpretation of results rests on the assump- tions i) that the marker locus can be regarded as selectively neutral and without a direct influence on the characters under study, and ii) that the number of parents to the f1 generation examined is not so small that potential heterogeneities reflect family rather than stock differences. with respect to the possible effects of the g3pdh-2 locus, stiihl & ryman (1 982) found no indications of dif- ferential growth rates among young brown_trout of different g3pdh-2 genotypes reared under identical environmental hatchery conditions. simi- larly, jorde & ryman (1996) tested for the exist- ence of selection in natural populations of brown_trout inhabiting lakes closely located to the present study area and found no evidence of deviations from neutrality at g3pdh-2 or other allozyme loci included in their extensive set of data. finally, g3pdh-2 was one of the first detected poly- morphisms in the brown_trout (engel et al. 1971); variation at this locus has been examined in a large number of studies, but to our knowledge it has never been suggested as a locus under selection. with respect to the number of families we have estimated the effective number of parents to the present f1 generation from allele frequency differ- ences among cohorts (in preparation). those re- sults indicate that the minimum number of effec- tive breeders per stock has been in the order of 10- 30 during each spawning season. thus, we con- sider it unlikely that stock differences are con- founded by family effects in the present material. our main result is the demonstration of a gen- etic basis for differences in a number of phenotypic characters between two stocks of brown_trout. the most apparent genetic components were found for age at maturity and for migratory and repro- ductive behavior, whereas only a relatively small component could be observed for variation in body size. we assume that most of these genetically based differences observed between the stocks re- flect local adaptation, although the present experi- ment has not been designed to answer how these traits may have enhanced survival and repro- duction in the original local environments of the two stocks (cf. taylor 1991). our experimental approach has the advantage of permitting the study of characters, such as mi- transplanted brown_trout gratory behavior, which can usually not be exam- ined under laboratory or culture conditions. in ad- dition, the fact that the fish analyzed (the f, gener- ation) were spawned and spent their entire lives in nature also permits the detection of differences among groups that may have been established al- ready during the earliest life stages. most import- ant, however, the present design allows assessment of the variation across multiple lakes, cohorts, and sampling years, sources of variation that must be considered for a reasonably realistic depiction of the role of genetic factors under natural conditions. in an experiment of the present type, the en- vironmental component of the phenotypic vari- ation is expected to be larger for many traits than it would have been under more constant culture conditions. thus, the detection of a genetic com- ponent of variation can depend critically on access to a substantial amount of data. smaller samples sizes would have made it difficult to notice the “signal” of genetic factors across variation due to lakes, cohorts, etc. in addition, a less comprehen- sive collection of data could easily have resulted in erroneous conclusions. for example, if sampling had been restricted to lake i this would have sug- gested that stock b had been much more successful than stock a in survival and reproduction, whereas the incorporation of data from lake i1 has provided a more balanced picture in this re- spect (table 1). similarly, if an evaluation of body size had been based on only the first few years of sampling the difference between lakes would have been severely underestimated; confining the sam- pling to, e.g., the years 1988-1990 would have re- sulted in a “lake” component of variation of only about 5% (of questionable significance) as com- pared to the highly significant estimates in the ap- proximate range of 15-30% for the entire period 1988-1996 (cf. table 2). our data suggest the existence of behavioral dif- ferences between the two stocks a and b. the con- trasting proportions of a and b genes in lakes i and 11 are most easily explained by dissimilar mi- gratory behavior. a preliminary analysis of some additional samples from other places in the same water system shows that genes from stock a pre- dominate at locations downstream of lake 11, whereas the frequency of genes from stock b is close to 100% upstream of lake i at the sites for the introduction (unpublished data). the seem- ingly simplest explanation is that stock a has a more pronounced tendency for downstream mi- gration than stock b. similar heritable differences in migratory behavior between populations have been found previously in brown_trout (jonsson 1982) and in other salmonids (bams 1976; kelso et al. 1981). 177 palm & ryman it also appears likely that the overall deficiency of hybrids in the f1 generation reflects behavioral dif- ferences between stocks a and b that for some rea- son have resulted in some degree of reproductive isolation between them (assortative mating). at present, however, we can only speculate about the nature of the mechanism involved. it is possible, for example, that differences with respect to spawning time or preferred spawning habitat (e.g. upstream or downstream) have resulted in fewer hybrids being produced than expected under random mating. fu- ture studies, including sampling of offspring (o+) at potential nursery grounds in the area, may provide information on this matter. in addition to behavioral dissimilarities between stocks a and b there seem to be heritable differ- ences in age at maturity and growth. the lower proportion of mature fish in group a most likely reflects a tendency for stock a to mature later than stock b. such a difference would be compatible with the observation that most of the reproduction in the parental generation appears to have oc- curred later in stock a than in stock b (table 1), and the differences in mean age among the mature fish also point in this direction (table 3). in contrast to the apparent differences in behav- ior and age at maturity only a small proportion of the variation in body size can be explained by stock/ group differences. clearly, there are size differences between groups a and b; we also note that the group a fish, i.e. the descendants from the popula- tion that was large-sized in its original environment, tend to be larger than the group b fish descending from a population that is small-sized in its native setting. the absolute magnitude of those differences is quite small, however. in a series of classical experi- ments, alm (1939,1949) made a similar observation when comparing the growth of marked progeny from small- and large-sized brown_trout stocks re- leased into human-made ponds. the most apparent size difference, however, re- fers to the hybrid (ab) being somewhat larger than the other groups on average. this relation prob- ably represents a heterotic effect (“hybrid vigor”), caused by the masking of recessive alleles that have accumulated because of inbreeding and genetic drift in the two parental populations (e.g. falconer 1989; lynch 1997). such an explanation is compat- ible with the recent observation of jorde & ryman (1 996) who found that the genetically effective size of natural brown_trout populations may com- monly be small enough to rather quickly accumu- late the inbreeding necessary for expression of het- erosis upon interbreeding. such a mechanism may also explain the tendency towards a higher mean age (i.e. better survival) of the hybrids relative to that of groups a and b. 178 it is import to realize, finally, that it is unclear to what extent the original stocks and the differences between them will persist in future generations. the introduction took place in an environment lacking brown_trout, and it will probably take some time before the fish has occupied the whole niche available for this species. during an initial phase of colonization, competition for available re- sources may be comparatively restricted and, hence, the environmental conditions different from those in a more crowded situation. management implications large fish are considered exceedingly more valu- able than small ones in many species, and there is an apparent focus on body size in the management of such species. populations for stocking or con- servation are frequently selected exclusively on the basis of the average or maximum size, and the underlying rationale generally rests on the pre- sumption that body size is to a large extent genetic- ally determined in fishes. it is believed that popula- tions producing large-sized individuals in a par- ticular environment or at a particular occasion will continue to do so under a majority of other en- vironmental conditions; the empirical evidence supporting this belief, however, is generally weak or nonexistent. the small difference in size between stocks ob- served in this study suggests that most of the diver- gence observed in the original environments of the two populations reflect contrasting environmental conditions (e.g. in feeding opportunities) rather than genetic differences at loci affecting body size. our results indicate that the conjecture of a strong hereditary basis for size in brown_trout in natural systems is not well supported, especially when re- lating genetic effects to those caused by other nat- urally occurring sources of variation such as age, location, or year of birth or capture. in contrast to the results for body size, however, there are ap- parent stock differences with respect to life history characteristics such as migratory and spawning be- havior. our present data are unique in that they account for the variability pattern under completely natu- ral conditions during several years, but other pieces of information collectively indicate that the hereditary component for body size may generally be fairly weak in many or most fishes, particularly when under the influence of the environmental per- turbations of a natural setting. for example, allen- dorf et al. (1987) noted that heritabilities of morphological traits are typically much lower in fishes than in many other vertebrates, and the re- sults of alm (1939, 1949) on brown_trout clearly suggested that size was more related to environ- ment than to the genetic make-up of the popula- tion. similarly, when reanalyzing data on size re- lated production characteristics in sea-ranched at- lantic salmon (sulmo sulur l.), ryman (1983) found that the presumed genetic component for differences among stocks appeared much smaller than anticipated previously after taking the vari- ation within stocks into account. an excessive management focus on the doctrine that “big is beautiful and heritable” may both be precarious to the outcome of many management activities and harmful from the perspective of con- servation. in the context of stocking, for example, it appears that selecting the introduced population on the basis of life history characteristics such as spawning or migratory behavior may be poten- tially more rewarding than focusing on size. the migratory behavior may be critical for whether or not the fish will remain at the site of release. this circumstance may be essential to the success of the program, particularly when considering the pres- ent results indicating that the size of the stocked fish may depend only marginally on the donor population. from a conservation perspective, the practice of using only one or a few populations for stocking may be devastating to genetic diversity within the species. such a policy may easily result in excessive genetic homogeneity over large areas previously hosting a multitude of distinct populations. fo- cussing on size and ignoring, e.g., behavioral characteristics that may be genetically determined to a larger extent, can also be harmful to biological diversity on the gene level. a pronounced tendency for long distance migration, for example, would be a particularly undesirable characteristic of the released fish in many situations because of the ap- parent risk for hybridization with native popula- tions in areas far beyond the one targeted for stocking. with respect to the present observations, for instance, it appears that stock b has a much stronger site fidelity than stock a, and the “genetic risk” associated with releases would be corre- spondingly smaller. resumen 1. en este trabajo presentamos 10s resultados de un experimen- to realizado para comprobar la existencia de diferencias fenoti- picas de origen genetic0 entre varias poblaciones de sulrno truttu nacidas y criadas enteramente en condiciones naturales. para ello marcamos gentticamente individuos de dos grupos (a y b) que introdujimos en una cuenca fluvial de suecia, previa- mente vaciada de truchas. durante nueve afios consecutivos muestreamos, en dos lagos distintos, individuos de la primera generacion (f,). esperamos que las diferencias fenotipicas entre las progenies a, b e hibridos (ab) reflejaran diferencias deter- minadas genkticamente. transplanted brown_trout 2. observamos diferencias fenotipicas entre las progenies, tanto en la edad en la primera madurez como en el comportamiento migratorio y reproductivo. aparentemente, estos caracteres es- tan determinados por factores genkticos, de tal manera que pueden ser detectados incluso bajo la presencia de factores de confusion tales como fuentes naturales de variacion como el lago, la edad, la cohorte o el afio de muestreo. entre 10s grupos de descendientes, tambien detectamos variaciones significativas en la longitud, aunque solamente una pequefia proporcion de la variacion total observada pudo ser atribuida a diferencias entre 10s stocks. 3. estas caracteristicas de poblaciones, determinadas genetica- mente, pueden representar adaptaciones locales. por ello, discu- timos nuestros resultados en el context0 de la gestion pesquera: para repoblaciones de truchas parece mas recomendable selec- cionar poblaciones por caracteristicas biologicas tales como el comportamiento reproductivo o migratorio, en lugar de selec- cionarse en caracteristicas “econbmicas” tales como el tamafio de 10s individuos. de la misma forma, seria preferible utilizar poblaciones locales que contribuyan a la conservacion de la diversidad genttica. acknowledgments we thank per erik jorde, linda laikre, peter a. bisson and two
