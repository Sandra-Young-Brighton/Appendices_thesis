dolly varden char; secondary sexual characters; sperm concentrations; sperm longevity; sperm velocity introduction investment in testes (i.e., in males, sperm competition (parker 1970) for eggs during reproductive events is known to occur in a variety of taxonomic groups (birkhead & møller 1998). according to parker’s (1990) theory of sperm subordinate males would exhibit a competition, higher increased sperm than dominant males, number and concentration) because they are exposed to more intense sperm com- petition. in fishes, such sperm characteristics have been compared between subordinate and dominant males (particularly within species), where subordinate males use alternative reproductive tactics to gain access to mates. for example, larger males (parental males) dominate females and spawn, while smaller males to fertilise eggs (sneaker males) attempt simultaneously when females spawn with parental males (stockley et al. 1997; leach & montgomerie 2000; yamamoto et al. 2015). as sneaker males are in an unfavourable reproductive situation, they appear to invest in better ejaculating characteristics to com- pete with fertilisation from parental males. in fact, several studies have demonstrated that sneaker males have a higher sperm concentration than parental males (leach & montgomerie 2000; neff et al. 2003), which was positively associated with repro- ductive success (stoltz & neff 2006). since the late 1990s, it has been accepted that sperm quality traits (sperm velocity and longevity) have also evolved as a consequence of sperm compe- tition (snook 2005). ball & parker (1996) hypothe- sised that sperm swimming speed (velocity) would increase with increasing sperm competition and that, correspondence: t. yamamoto, department of veterinary nursing and technology, nippon veterinary and life science university, musashino, tokyo 180-8602, japan. e-mail: tyamamoto@nvlu.ac.jp doi: 10.1111/eff.12283 397 yamamoto et al. under conditions of limited energy, there would be a trade-off between sperm swimming speed and long- evity. in fact, some studies have shown that sperm velocity in sneaker males, which experience greater sperm competition, was higher than in parental males (burness et al. 2004; locatello et al. 2007). sperm velocity is thought to negatively affect sperm longev- ity; however, experimental and comparative analyses have resulted in inconsistent outcomes (negative: neff et al. 2003; positive: pitcher et al. 2009; jan- hunen et al. 2009). characters, secondary sexual in contrast to the numerous studies examining the associations between adult body size and sperm char- acteristics, few studies have focused on the associa- tions of such as breeding colour, snout length and hump length, with the sperm characteristics (masvær et al. 2004; jan- hunen et al. 2009; pitcher et al. 2009). the domi- nance hierarchy of salmonidae within reproductive groups is determined not only by their body size but also by their secondary sexual characters (fleming & gross 1994). moreover, dominant males are able to take the favourable position closest to females and gain with high fertilisation success (dickerson et al. 2002; yamamoto & edo 2002). therefore, one could predict that males with undeveloped secondary sexual characters, who are generally subordinate within reproductive groups, are investing more energy in the quality and quantity of sperm. the subject of this study, the dolly varden char salvelinus_malma, is widely distributed around the pacific rim (dunham et al. 2008). the proportions of resident individuals, which mature in the river without descending to the sea, are inversely correlated with latitude. nearly all dolly varden char inhabiting hok- kaido, japan, the southern limit of distribution, are resident individuals (morita et al. 2005). the age and size at maturity of resident males are generally 1–5 years and 90–250 mm respectively. the repro- ductive success of male dolly varden char generally depends on the body size of resident males, as females have shown preference for the largest male in the breeding group as a mating partner (kitano 1996). in this study, we investigated the associations between body size, secondary sexual characters (snout length, hump height and breeding colour), and sperm characteristics in male dolly varden char to test whether males improve the sperm characteristics at the level of individual gametes. material and methods study site and collection sampling was conducted in the makkari river 0 (42°45 e), a tributary of the shiribetsu 0 n, 140°45 398 river, located in mid-western hokkaido, japan. this river is a spring-fed tributary that is approximately 20 km long and has an average stream gradient of 0.8%. water temperature is fairly constant (7–10 °c) throughout the year. in addition to dolly varden char, other salmonid species found in the makkari river include masu salmon (oncorhynchus_masou), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) and white spot- ted char (salvelinus_leucomaenis). twenty-one newly matured (1-year-old) male dolly varden char were captured using a backpack elec- trofisher (smith-root inc., vancouver, wa, usa) in late november 2011. upon capture, fish were pho- tographed to measure fork length, hump height and snout length to the nearest 0.1 cm, according to flem- ing & gross (1989). moreover, semen samples were collected from each male by pressing their abdominal regions. using a micropipette, 1 ll of each semen sample was combined with 99 ll of sperm preserva- tion solution (110 mm nacl, 30 mm kcl, 1.6 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 10 mm nahco3; ph 8.0; 307.8 mosm/l) and stored for a maximum of 2 h at 4 °c, until sperm activity was assayed (stoss & holtz 1981; ohta et al. 2000). scales were also collected from each fish and used to determine age by counting year-rings under a stereoscope. evaluation of breeding colour to evaluate the breeding coloration of males, all fish were anaesthetised individually and photographed on their left side (fig. 1) using a nikon d90 digital cam- era (nikon corporation, tokyo, japan) within hours of field capture. to ensure original colour display on photographs, colour correction was performed before- hand using a colour chart. to reduce light-shade dif- ferences, fish were bilaterally irradiated with strobe lights (sb-600; nikon corporation) angled at 45° to the fish. recorded images of the males were trans- ferred to a pc and analysed using the yamacolor ver. 2.0 imaging analysis software (nippon veterinary and life science university, musashino, japan). this software produces information on the pixels within a specified range from a central point on an image. in this case, the range was specified as a circle with a radius, and 10 circles were randomly five-pixel superimposed on each photo so that they entirely covered the abdominal region displaying evident breeding colour (fig. 1). in salmonids, the colours of this region are considered an ornament that signals important information in reproductive behaviour (masvær et al. 2004; janhunen et al. 2009). in this study, three colour properties, hue (°), saturation (%) and brightness (%), were obtained as values of breed- ing colour (liljedal et al. 1999; pitcher et al. 2007). the range of the mean values for hue, saturation and (a) (b) 5 cm fig. 1. colour photographs of the dolly varden char (salvelinus_malma).

(1981): mt ¼ mo  ðl=loþb where mt is the transformed snout and hump height, mo is the observed morphological size, l is the over- all mean standard length (152.5 mm), lo is the observed standard length and b is the regression coef- ficient of log mo on log lo obtained from analysis of covariance. correlations between sperm characteristics, and body size and secondary characters (breeding colour, transformed snout length and hump height) were analysed using a generalised linear model (glm; mccullagh & nelder 1989). the correlation between the proportion of motile sperm at 1 min postactiva- tion and velocity was also analysed using a glm. as the data from measurements of sperm concentration and the proportion of motile sperm at 1 min postacti- vation were overdispersed, we used negative binomi- nal errors and the logit link function. sperm velocity was used the gaussian error. the significant indepen- dent variables were assessed using likelihood ratio tests. p-values inferior to 0.05 were considered to indicate significant differences. all analyses were performed using r version 3.1.1 software (r devel- opment core team 2013) results range, 153  14 mm (mean  sd; the 21 newly matured male dolly varden char, esti- mated to be one-year-old fish by the scale, were col- lected from the makkari river. their mean body size 129– was 181 mm). transformed snout length and hump height were 8.5  0.9 mm and 29.3  1.6 mm respec- tively. sperm flagellar length ranged from 34.2 to 41.1 lm. no significant correlation was detected between flagellar length and body length (s =  0.19, p = 0.23) or between flagellar length and sperm velocity (s = 0.10, p = 0.55). moreover, body length was not significantly correlated with the three colour 399 yamamoto et al. table 1. results of likelihood test between sperm characteristics, and body length and secondary sexual characters in dolly varden char. variables coefficient model for sperm concentration body length hump height snout length hue saturation brightness model for sperm swimming speed body length hump height snout length hue saturation brightness model for sperm longevity body length hump height snout length hue saturation brightness 0.09  0.03  0.61  0.01  0.56  0.48  0.31 9.15 6.43 1.37  54.23 26.50 0.03  0.75 1.43  0.02 1.89 0.31 p-value <0.01 0.93 0.31 0.27 0.40 0.48 0.84 0.52 0.78 <0.001 0.02 0.30 0.50 0.13 0.07 0.24 0.02 0.75 sperm longevity indicates the proportion of motile sperm at 60 s postactivation. properties (hue, saturation and brightness) (p > 0.05 in all cases). body length was significantly correlated with sperm concentration (glm, v2 = 0.09, p < 0.01; table 1 and fig. 2a), but not with sperm velocity (v2 =  0.31, p = 0.84). on the other hand, sperm velocity was negatively correlated with breeding col- our hue and positively correlated with saturation (fig. 2b,c), but not with brightness, body length, snout length and hump height (table 1). in addition, a negative and significant correlation was noted between sperm velocity and the proportion of motile sperm at one minute postactivation (longevity) (glm, v2 = 13.98, p < 0.001; fig. 2d). discussion for salmon reproduction) and small several studies on other salmonids compared sperm concentrations between large anadromous males (which migrate to the sea and return to the natal river resident males (which mature without going to the sea). these studies have shown that small resident males have higher sperm concentrations than anadromous males in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) (gage et al. 1995), nerka) (foote et al. 1997) and masu salmon (koseki & maekawa 2002; yamamoto et al. 2015), indicating that small resident males invest a greater amount of energy in increasing sperm concentration compared with large anadromous males. the results of the present study also showed that, in male dolly (oncorhynchus sockeye 400 varden char, sperm concentration increased with decreasing body length. the sperm of less colourful males (i.e., fish dis- playing lower hue and higher saturation values) swam faster than those of brightly coloured males. these results suggest a trade-off between sperm velocity and an investment in breeding colour. a negative correlation between sperm swimming speed and breeding colour has also been detected in coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch) (pitcher et al. 2009). however, although the mechanism responsible for this trade-off remains unclear, a study involving male chum salmon (oncorhynchus_keta) reported that mus- cle carotenoids migrate to the skin to produce a colourful phenotype during the reproductive season, while trace amounts of astaxanthin also migrate to the testes (kitahara 1983). the amount of astaxanthin in semen also affects its characteristics, where higher amounts increase the rate of fertilisation (blount et al. 2001; ahmadi et al. 2006). thus, the above- mentioned trade-off could be related to an allocation of astaxanthin from the muscles to the testes. a detailed investigation of astaxanthin distribution would reveal the mechanism for this trade-off. the present study also detected a trade-off between sperm swimming speed and longevity. the high- energy consumption required to increase sperm velocity could result in the shortened longevity of sperm. many studies have examined the relationship between sperm velocity and longevity in various fish species. to our knowledge, a negative correlation between these two variables has only been detected in the bluegill (lepomis macrochirus), in a study involving comparisons of alternative reproductive tactics between groups rather than between individu- als (neff et al. 2003). the sperm of small sneaker males exhibited shorter longevity and faster swim- ming speed than those of large bourgeois males (bur- ness et al. 2003; neff et al. 2003). conversely, a positive correlation was detected between these two characteristics in arctic char that matured in breeding environments (janhunen et al. 2009). however, no correlation was noted between sperm velocity and longevity in coho salmon (pitcher et al. 2009). this discrepancy in results could be explained by the dif- ferent astaxanthin amounts available to the different groups of fish. for example, in farmed environments, where fish obtain larger amounts of astaxanthin through feeding, energy can be invested in breeding colour and sperm quality. on the other hand, in envi- ronments with limited carotenoid-containing food resources (e.g., amphipods), such as in native envi- ronments, energy allocation is of critical importance. this could also explain the negative correlation between the swimming speed and longevity of sperm observed in the present study. the relationship sperm traits of small male with dull breeding colour fig. 2. associations between secondary sexual characters and sperm characteristics in dolly varden char (salvelinus_malma).

and (d) association between sperm velocity and longevity. statistical analyses were per- formed using a glm with a likelihood ratio test, considering a significance level of p < 0.05. between the swimming speed and longevity of sperm should be thoroughly investigated in environments with different food resources. moreover, the effect of ph on sperm motility has been reported in other sal- monids (billard 1983; perchec et al. 1993). although the effect of changes in ph on spermatozoa was not observed in this study, this relationship should be investigated in future research to for a better under- standing of how this determinant factor affects the longevity of sperm in the dolly varden char. in the present study, males with small bodies and weak breeding colours were characterised by: (i) a higher sperm count/concentration, (ii) a faster swim- ming sperm and (iii) a shorter sperm lifespan than large males with bright colours. our results suggest that small males with dull colours, which are gener- ally subordinate within reproductive groups, invest more energy in sperm quality and quantity to enhance their chances of reproductive success. acknowledgements we
