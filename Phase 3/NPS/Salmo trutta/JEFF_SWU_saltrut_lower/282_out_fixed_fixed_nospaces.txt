planeri) has been repeatedly questioned due to the high morphological similarity of these species. here, we report a high frequency (54%) of communal spawning involving both species in the lampetra redds of a french coastal river. these observations suggest that reproductive isolation between the two species may not be as strong as previously supposed. e. lasne1,2,3, m.-r. sabatie´ 1, g. evanno2

ﬂuviatilis l. and brook lampreys l. planeri (bloch) are closely related species also called ‘paired species’ that show con- trasting migration and feeding strategies (docker 2009). the river lamprey has an anadromous and parasitic life style, whereas the brook lamprey is nonmigratory and nonparasitic. they are morpho- logically very similar from larval to macrophthalmia stages but when adults, river lampreys are larger than brook lampreys (hardisty & potter 1971). there is still much debate about the level of speciation between both species, which could either be distinct species or different ecotypes of a single species (docker 2009). using allozyme data schreiber & engelhorn (1998) suggested that gene ﬂow occurs between the two forms but recent studies based on mitochondrial dna failed to disentangle the two competing hypotheses (espanhol et al. 2007; blank et al. 2008). according to hardisty & potter (1971), the lack of observation of successful interspeciﬁc mating in the ﬁeld supports the theory of two distinct species. during mating, a male attaches dorsally to the female’s head and loops his tail around her body their genital openings are closely aligned so that (cochran et al. 2008). interspeciﬁc hybridization would be mainly prevented by body size differences between the two species precluding any successful mating (hardisty 1963; salewski 2003) by: (i) reducing the number of ova a male could squeeze from females of a very different size (beamish & neville 1992) and ii) reducing the ova fertilization success due to a too large distance between the genital openings of both mating partners (hardisty & potter 1971; malmqvist 1983). as a result, lampreys usually mate with individuals of similar size and homogamy is supposed to be the rule (hardisty & potter 1971; beamish & neville 1992; docker 2009). conversely, postzygotic isolation seems weak as interspeciﬁc artiﬁcial crosses yielded viable larvae interspeciﬁc communal (hardisty & potter 1971). spawning in the same nest is therefore the ﬁrst prerequisite for hybridisation to occur between l. ﬂuviatilis and l. planeri. however, whilst such nest association has been already observed (huggins & thompson 1970) the frequency of its occurrence has still never been investigated. the aim of this doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00428.x 323 lasne et al. fig. 1. map of the study area with locali- zation of the lamprey redds monitored. study was to quantify the proportion of interspeciﬁc spawning sites among the lampetra redds from a french coastal river. the oir river is a tributary of the se´lune river that ﬂows into the english channel in the mont saint michel bay (fig. 1). this small river (24.9 km long) is located at 8 km from the estuary and is inhabited by diadromous ﬁshes including atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), eels (anguilla anguilla), sea and river lampreys (petromyzon marinus and l. ﬂuviatilis). previous observations (spawning counts, electroﬁshing and ﬁsh traps surveys) suggested that anadromous lampreys are conﬁned to downstream reaches (probably due to barriers to migrations, e.g., water mills, see fig. 1), whereas brook lampreys (l. planeri) occupy both small tributaries of the upper basin and downstream reaches of the oir river (pers. obs.). in early april 2009, good environmental conditions (medium water levels and high water transparency) allowed us to monitor the lampreys redds in a 1620 m long section of the oir river (fig. 1). we found a total of 13 lamprey redds among which, six were occupied solely by l. ﬂuviatilis, and seven by both species (table 1). we did not detect any sites with only l. planeri individuals. in most redds where both species occurred, the ratio of the number of brook to river lampreys was below one except in one redd where l. planeri was the dominant species (table 1). interspeciﬁc and monospeciﬁc spawning sites were not spatially separated and rather randomly distributed interspeciﬁc in the study area (fig. 1). notably, spawning sites were not all located immediately table 1. behaviour and number of lampetra ﬂuviatilis and l. planeri individuals observed in 13 lamprey redds from the oir river (see

female (cf. video s1 in the online supplementary material). we also observed another brook lamprey male and two river lamprey males trying to copulate with a single river lamprey female. it was however not possible to check whether any ova were successfully fertilised during these mating attempts. overall these observations show that, at least in some systems, interspeciﬁc communal spawning of l. planeri and l. ﬂuviatilis can be frequent (here 54% of l. ﬂuviatilis redds). poor observation conditions, (e.g., high water turbidity) during the lamprey mating season may explain why such observations were rarely reported. the high frequency of nest association we observed suggests that interspeciﬁc hybridisation may occur in the oir river especially in sites where l. planeri males are more numerous than l. ﬂuviatilis males. satellite male behaviour may facilitate such interspeciﬁc fertilization (cochran et al. 2008). satel- lite males circle about the urogenital area of a mating pair before releasing sperm to gain fertilizations in a similar way as sneaker males do in a variety of other ﬁsh species (review in gross 1984). this behaviour has been observed in l. planeri and l. ﬂuviatilis (malmqvist 1983 and wu¨stel et al. 1996), but we did not notice it in the oir river. finally our results show that interspeciﬁc nest association can be common in l. planeri and l. ﬂuviatilis but a deﬁnitive clariﬁcation of their taxonomic status will require estimates of gene ﬂow among sympatric populations. acknowledgements we are grateful to l. valery, a. vøllestad and three
