south dakota state agricultural experiment station abstract processes influencing fish recruitment are often highly complex and inherently difficult to understand. invasive species may complicate recruitment through habitat and food web modifications resulting in competitive bottlenecks. common carp cyprinus carpio have been distributed worldwide, and their introductions have resulted in destructive effects on aquatic ecosystems and food web dynamics. common carp are highly fecund, and high densities of age- 0 carp may occur in some years that may reduce invertebrate prey resources and adversely affect native age- 0 fishes. we used enclo- sures and field observations to examine potential effects of age- 0 common carp on growth and survival of age- 0 yellow perch perca flavescens and bluegill lepomis macrochirus. yellow perch and bluegill were stocked into enclosures with and without common carp (31 fish/m3) using a substitution experimental design, and fish growth and survival and invertebrate prey resources were assessed. common carp reduced growth of yellow perch but not bluegill and did not affect survival of either species in mesocosms. next, we used patterns of common carp, bluegill, and yellow perch abun- dance and total length across 38 lake- years to evaluate potential interspecific interac- tions in natural systems. age- 0 common carp abundance was not negatively related to size or abundance of bluegill or yellow perch. however, adult common carp and age- 0 yellow perch abundance were inversely related, suggesting a potential competitive bottleneck. thus, age- 0 common carp may suppress growth of yellow perch when prey is limited, but adult common carp may have larger effects than early life stages on native juvenile fishes. k e y w o r d s cyprinus carpio, interspecific, intraspecific, invasive species, invertebrates 1 |  introduction recruitment processes of fishes are highly variable and difficult to pre- dict. recruitment success is commonly determined during early life stages and is regulated by a suite of biotic and abiotic factors (houde, 1987). competitive interactions among species during early life stages for limiting resources are one biotic process that may affect recruitment dynamics (persson & greenberg, 1990; prout, mills, & forney, 1990). fishes often share similar prey resources during early life stages (i.e., zooplankton followed by benthic invertebrates) and may compete for prey if it becomes limited (garvey & stein, 1998; persson & greenberg, 1990; welker, pierce, & wahl, 1994). competition during early life stages may result in reduced growth and survival during this critical life stage that may ultimately reduce year- class strength (rice et al. 1987; devries, stein, miner, & mittelbach, 1991; letcher et al. 1996; garvey & stein, 1998). as such, competition during early life stages may result in competitive bottlenecks where resource limitation limits recruitment to adult stages (neill, 1975; persson & greenberg, 1990). 216  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:216–224. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd﻿wewer and eerr﻿a invasive fishes often occupy similar ecological niches as native fishes with the possibility for resource overlap and competitive inter- actions, cumulatively resulting in native species population declines. common carp cyprinus carpio is a prominent component of many aquatic ecosystems throughout the world and has been associated with numerous deleterious ecosystem effects due to population abundance and benthic foraging that can reduce benthic and pelagic invertebrates (koehn, 2004; lowe et al. 2004; weber & brown, 2009). in some locations, such as the upper great plains and midwestern usa and australia, common carp can achieve high densities and are associated with the displacement of native fishes through perceived competitive interactions (howell, weber, & brown, 2014; jackson, quist, downing, & larscheid, 2010; letvin et al., unpublished data; weber & brown, 2011). yet, little information is available address- ing potential interactions between invasive common carp and native fishes, particularly during critical early life stages. because recruitment potential in freshwater fishes is typically regulated during the first year of life (houde, 1987), evaluating potential interspecific interactions between common carp and native fishes may provide critical insights into recruitment dynamics of these species. competitive bottlenecks occur primarily during planktivorous early life stages in fishes (persson & greenberg, 1990; werner, 1986). age- 0 common carp initially consume zooplankton and can deplete these prey resources before switching to benthic macro- invertebrates between 50 and 120 mm total length (britton et al., 2007; howell et al., 2014; khan, wilson, & khan, 2003; weber & brown, 2013). similarly, most native fishes also consume zooplank- ton when they begin exogenous feeding but eventually transition to benthic macroinvertebrates during juvenile stages. for instance, age- 0 bluegill lepomis macrochirus and yellow perch perca flavescens, common native fishes across the midwest and upper great plains usa where common carp are abundant, both initially consume zoo- plankton with yellow perch generally switching to benthic macroin- vertebrates as juveniles (lott, willis, & lucchesi, 1996; mittelbach, 1984; werner, 1967). when bluegill and yellow perch are sympatric with common carp, prey resource overlap between age- 0 common carp and bluegill and yellow perch can be high (howell et al., 2014) with carp altering food web dynamics (letvin et al., unpublished data). thus, great potential exists for age- 0 common carp to compete with bluegills and yellow perch during early life stages. however, competitive interactions between invasive common carp and native fishes have received little attention. combined manipulative laboratory experiments and field observa- tions can be complimentary to one another using controlled replication in the laboratory to identify important mechanisms resulting in eco- logical patterns observed in nature (carpenter, 1996; tilman, 1987). herein, we examined the effect of age- 0 common carp on growth and survival of age- 0 bluegill and yellow perch using a substitution- design enclosure experiment. first, we hypothesise that the addition of common carp would result in a reduction in bluegill and yellow perch growth and survival. second, we collected age- 0 common carp, bluegill and yellow perch in 13 lakes across 3 years to examine abun- dance and growth relationships among these species. third, because     |  217 adult common carp are often associated with declines in water quality and pelagic and benthic invertebrate prey resources (weber & brown, 2009), we also evaluated relationships between adult common carp and age- 0 bluegill and yellow perch relative abundance. we hypothe- sised that despite environmental variation among lakes, abundance of age- 0 and adult common carp would be inversely related to abundance and size of bluegill and yellow perch. combined, this work contributes to ecologists’ understanding of competitive bottlenecks between inva- sive and native fishes during early life stages. 2 |  methods 2.1 | enclosure experiment sixteen wire mesh enclosures (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.8 m) were placed in the littoral zone (0.75 m deep) of a shallow pond in brookings, sd, usa, and were allowed to develop invertebrate assemblages for 2 weeks. experimental fish were collected by boat electrofishing with pulsed- dc output at low amperage (~1–3 a), measured for total length (mm) and weight (g), and released into the enclosures on 18 august 2009. we used a substitution design and replaced native fish biomass with biomass of common carp to avoid differences across treatments as a result of density- dependent processes. each enclosure was ran- domly assigned with 20 bluegills, 10 bluegills + 10 common carp, 20 yellow perch, or 10 yellow perch + 10 common carp (31 fish/m3). all fish were removed and measured for total length and weight, and sur- vival was calculated as the percentage of fish remaining on 5 and 28 september 2009. (i.e., zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates food resources) were measured within each enclosure in addition to three adjacent locations outside the enclosures which served as controls on three occasions, once before the enclosures were stocked with fish (august 18) and concurrently with fish measure- ments (september 5 and 28). zooplankton was sampled with an integrated column sampler (5 cm diameter, 100 cm length), filtered through 63- μm mesh and preserved with lugol’s solution in the field. macroinvertebrates were collected with a mini ponar dredge (240 cm2), washed from sediments and macrophytes into a 500- μm mesh bucket and preserved in 90% ethanol. in the laboratory, zoo- plankton were identified and enumerated to suborder or family and total density (number/l) was estimated. all macroinvertebrates and aquatic insects were identified to family and enumerated to esti- mate total density (number/m2). fish length and weight and zooplankton and macroinverte- brate densities were log10 transformed whereas percent fish sur- vival was arcsin transformed prior to analysis to normalise residuals. differences in response variables (total length, weight, and survival of bluegills and yellow perch and zooplankton and macroinvertebrate densities) were compared using repeated- measures analysis of vari- ance where the partitions were treated as replicates and fishes were treated as subreplicates. when significant main effects were detected (α = 0.05), tukey’s lsd test was used to detect differences among treatments. 218  |     2.2 | field observations adult common carp and age- 0 common carp, bluegill, and yellow perch were collected in backwater habitats within each lake using pulsed d.c. electrofishing (200–250 v, 4–8 a) along three 15- minute tran- sects during the last week of the month from july through september in lakes brant, campbell, diamond, east and west oakwood, fish, goldsmith, herman, madison, oak, sinai, thompson, and whitewood in sd, usa, during 2008–2010. whitewood was not sampled in 2009 due to low water levels and difficulties accessing the lake. yellow perch occurred in all 13 lakes resulting in 38 lake- year observa- tions whereas bluegills only occurred in seven lakes resulting in 21 lake- year observations. the first 100 fish collected of each species were measured to the nearest 1 mm total length (tl); if fewer than 100 individuals were collected on a given date, all individuals were measured. mean total length of each species in august per lake was calculated as an index of growth. relative abundance of each spe- cies was calculated as the number of individuals collected per hour of electrofishing (cpue) within each lake on a monthly basis that was then averaged within a year. inverse relationships between popula- tion characteristics of species may be indicative of competition (seip, 1997). thus, pearson product moment correlations were used to evaluate relationships between mean relative abundance and total length at the end of august (i.e., growth) among all species as a test of interspecific versus intraspecific interactions. a bonferroni correction factor was used to adjust for multiple comparisons, and correlations were deemed significant at α = 0.05/9 = 0.006. visual assessment of the relationship between adult common carp and age- 0 yellow perch ﻿wewer and eerr﻿a relative abundance indicated a threshold relationship. thus, we fit- ted an inverse first- order polynomial regression to the relationship instead of correlation analysis. 3 |  results 3.1 | enclosure experiment age- 0 bluegill size and abundance was similar with or without age- 0 common carp. bluegill total length increased throughout the experi- ment (f2,12 = 333.66, p < .0001) and were of similar size regardless of common carp presence (f1,12 = 0.20, p = .66; figure 1). bluegill weight also increased throughout the experiment (f2,12 = 139.07, p < .0001), but weights were similar between treatments with or without com- mon carp (f1,12 = 0.07, p = .80; figure 1). bluegill mortality was high during the first 2 weeks of the experiment (~50%). however, bluegill survival did not decline from 5 to 28 september (f1,12 = 0.23, p = .64) and was not affected by common carp (f1,12 = 1.22, p = .29; figure 1). in contrast, age- 0 yellow perch were affected by the presence of common carp. yellow perch total length increased through time (f2,12 = 7.45, p = .009) and individuals had shorter mean total lengths when common carp were present (f1,12 = 8.08, p = .01; figure 1). yellow perch weight also increased through time (f2,12 = 6.43, p = .02), and fish weighed less in the presence of common carp as opposed to when carp were absent (f1,12 = 13.71, p = .003; figure 1). however, yellow perch survival was near 100% throughout the experiment (f1,12 < 0.0001, p = .99) and was similar with or without common carp (f1,12 = 0.001, p = .99;

α = 0.006). intraspecific interactions between bluegill mean total length and abundance were also not detected (figure 5a). similar to age- 0 common carp, few relationships were identified between adult common carp and age- 0 native fish abundance or growth. adult common carp relative abundance ranged between 0 and 26 fish per hour of electrofishing and was not inversely related to blue- gill abundance (figure 6a) or growth (figure 6b) or yellow perch growth (figure 6d). however, an inverse relationship occurred between adult common carp and age- 0 yellow perch relative abundance; few age- 0 yellow perch were captured when adult common carp abundance surpassed 8 individuals per hour of electrofishing (figure 6c). 4 |  discussion introduced and native fishes often occupy similar niches and consume similar prey items that may result in interspecific competitive interac- tions and competitive bottlenecks (persson & greenberg, 1990; prout et al., 1990; matthews, gelwick, & hoover, 1992; sutton & ney 2002). however, for competition to occur between species, habitat and prey resource overlap must exist. age- 0 common carp use similar prey resources (e.g., zooplankton and benthic invertebrates) as many native fishes including age- 0 bluegills and yellow perch (gisbert, cardona, & castellό, 1996; howell et al., 2014; specziar, biro, & tolg, 1998) and can successfully reduce invertebrate prey resources (khan et al., 2003; weber & brown, 2015). additionally, these species occupy similar hab- itats during their early life history (weber & brown, 2012). thus, tem- poral and spatial overlap in resource use suggests that these species may experience competitive interactions if resources become limiting. here, we discuss the potential for competition to exist between inva- sive common carp and native bluegill and yellow perch. ﻿wewer and eerr﻿a 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 110 100 90 80 70 60 ) m m ( h t g n e l l a t o t l l i g e u l b  0 - e g a ) m m ( h t g n e l l a t o t  h c r e p w o l l e y  0 - e g a r = 0.11 p = 0.51 1200 1400 1600 r = –0.40 p = 0.04 0 200 400 800 600 age-0 bluegill cpue 1000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 age-0 yellow perch cpue figure 5 relationships between age- 0 bluegill abundance and total length (top panel) and yellow perch abundance and total length in august (bottom panel) 4.1 | enclosure experiment planktivorous fishes are size- selective foragers and typically con- sume and reduce abundance of large- bodied zooplankton (brooks & dodson, 1965). results presented here and elsewhere (khan et al., 2003; weber & brown, 2015) indicate that age- 0 common carp can significantly reduce abundance of large- bodied cladocerans. in con- trast, copepod abundance was reduced by the presence of fish but was not reduced further due to the addition of common carp. cladocerans are typically reduced to a greater extent than copepods by fish pre- dation because copepods are more successful at evading predation (persson, 1987). in contrast, rotifers benefited from reductions in cla- docera and copepod densities as rotifer densities were higher in all fish treatments compared to controls. the reduction of cladocera and copepod densities in the presence of planktivorous fish can release rotifers from competition with larger zooplankton (matsuzaki, usio, takamura, & washitani, 2009). treatments with yellow perch, com- mon carp or their combination also reduced chironomid densities. common carp sympatric with bluegills reduced chironomid densities below bluegill only treatments, but carp did not reduce chironomids when sympatric with yellow perch compared to yellow perch only     |  221 treatments. these results suggest that bluegills were foraging primar- ily on zooplankton prey whereas yellow perch were likely reliant upon both zooplankton and chironomids as prey. these foraging patterns are supported by diet analysis literature (lott et al., 1996; mittelbach, 1984; werner, 1967) and suggest that common carp may have a greater effect on growth and survival of yellow perch than bluegill. reductions in cladoceran densities in enclosures are critical to understanding the potential effects of age- 0 common carp on early life stages of fishes. common carp, bluegill and yellow perch all con- sume large- bodied zooplankton prey early in life before switching to different prey items as these prey items are depleted and fish attain larger body sizes (gisbert et al., 1996; howell et al., 2014; lott et al., 1996; mittelbach, 1984). cladoceran densities were lower in enclo- sures containing both yellow perch and common carp compared to yel- low perch only enclosures which may have prematurely forced yellow perch to forage on macroinvertebrates. yellow perch can experience reduced growth rates when they are forced to switch to macroinverte- brates due to competition for pelagic prey (persson & greenberg, 1990; prout et al., 1990). similarly, yellow perch total length and weight were reduced in the presence of carp that may have implications for overwin- ter survival due to increased predation and starvation rates through the “bigger is better” hypothesis (miller, crowder, rice, & marschall, 1988). when common carp do not reduce invertebrate prey resources, they may not affect native fish populations (haines, 1973). similarly, we did not detect an effect of common carp on bluegill growth when cladocera densities were not suppressed by carp. in other instances, age- 0 bluegill growth has been suppressed by age- 0 common carp when zooplankton densities were reduced (carey & wahl, 2010), suggesting prey abundance in the highly productive systems used in this study was not sufficiently limiting for competitive interactions to occur. additionally, high bluegill mortality between stocking and the first sampling event (~50%) dramatically reduced bluegill density that may have removed density- dependent processes, further releasing individuals from intraspecific competition. both interspecific and intraspecific competition are important mechanisms occurring during early life stages that may structure recruitment processes. similarities in age- 0 bluegill and yellow perch growth and survival with or without common carp suggests that interspecific competition with common carp may be comparable to intraspecific competition with conspecifics. we used a substitution experimental design to evaluate competition, meaning the number of native fish used in treatments with common carp was reduced to maintain similar overall mesocosm fish densities among treatments (i.e., always 20 fish per cage regardless of species combination). thus, if common carp were not competing with native fish, one could hypothesise an increase in bluegill or yellow perch growth and survival in the presence of common carp due to reduced intraspecific compe- tition. however, this hypothesis was never supported, as growth and survival of bluegill and yellow perch with carp were always similar to or lower than in the absence of carp. therefore, our results could be interpreted as interspecific competition of native fish with common carp is comparable to intraspecific competition. further experiments that vary the density of both carp and native fishes would help to 222  |     1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 55 50 45 40 35 30 e u p c l l i g e u l b 0 - e g a ) m m ( h t g n e l l a t o t l l i g e u l b  0 - e g a ﻿wewer and eerr﻿a (a) (b) r = 0.14 p = 0.40 (c) yep cpue = 35.65 + (94.61/coc cpue) r = 0.48, p = 0.002 (d) r = –0.005 p = 0.99 r = 0.09 p = 0.66 0 5 10 15 20 30 5 25 adult common carp cpue 0 10 15 20 25 30 500 400 300 200 100 0 110 100 90 80 70 60 e u p c h c r e p w o l l e y 0 - e g a ) m m ( h t g n e l l a t o t h c r e p w o l l e y  0 - e g a figure 6 relationships between adult common carp relative abundance and age- 0 bluegill and yellow perch abundance (panels a and c) and mean total length in august (panels b and d). the inverse first- order polynomial (solid line) and equation are presented for the relationship between adult common carp and age- 0 yellow perch relative abundance (c) clarify the effects of fish species in combination with density on com- petitive interactions. 4.2 | field observations although mesocosm experiments indicated that competition between invasive age- 0 common carp and age- 0 yellow perch is possible under certain conditions, few interspecific interactions were observed in eutrophic natural lakes. in the field, age- 0 common carp were typi- cally as abundant or more abundant than bluegill or yellow perch, although some exceptions were observed. although significant rela- tionships between common carp abundance and bluegill and yellow perch abundance were not detected, abundant year- classes of native fishes (>50 cpue) rarely occurred when age- 0 common carp were abundant (>75 cpue). additionally, yellow perch intraspecific com- petition may be more important than interspecific competition with age- 0 common carp. a negative relationship existed between yel- low perch abundance and mean total length in august, suggesting density- dependent growth rates, as noted in other systems (irwin et al., 2009). lack of detectable evidence of interspecific interactions between age- 0 common carp and bluegill and yellow perch in the field may be the product of several factors. first, lakes evaluated in this study are highly productive and typically support abundant inverte- brate assemblages (weber & brown, 2012; weber, brown, & willis, 2010). thus, prey resources for age- 0 fishes may not have been limit- ing. indeed, age- 0 common carp can reduce growth rates of native fishes in less productive environments where prey resources are more limited (carey & wahl, 2010). second, year- class strength of bluegill and yellow perch is highly variable and regulated by numerous com- plex processes that are difficult to predict (edwards, phelps, graeb, & willis, 2007; isermann & willis, 2008) that may have overridden competitive interactions with age- 0 common carp. third, resource competition among species can lead to niche segregation (matthews et al., 1992; persson & greenberg, 1990) resulting in species coexist- ence (werner & hall 1976). although common carp, bluegill, and yel- low perch are all found at greatest abundance in the littoral zone, they tend to occupy different microhabitats (weber & brown, 2012) that may reduce interspecific interactions. thus, these factors, in addition to other environmental variation among lakes, may result in reduced interspecific competition between age- 0 common carp and bluegill and yellow perch in these systems despite dietary and habitat overlap (howell et al., 2014; weber & brown, 2012). inverse relationships between abundance of adult common carp and native fishes (weber & brown, 2011) may instead be attributed to ﻿wewer and eerr﻿a interactions between adult common carp and early life stages of native fishes (letvin et al., unpublished data; wolfe, santucci, einfalt, & wahl, 2009) rather than interactions between age- 0 common carp and native fishes. adult common carp abundance was inversely related to age- 0 yellow perch abundance, suggesting they may impose a competitive bottleneck on yellow perch recruitment. similarly, common carp can induce food web shifts (letvin et al., unpublished data), reduce juvenile growth rates (wolfe et al., 2009) and impose recruitment bottlenecks (cardona, hereu, & torras, 2008; gisbert et al., 1996). interestingly, inverse threshold relationships have been identified between adult common carp and adult bluegill but not yellow perch in the great plains (weber & brown, 2011), suggesting common carp may be interacting with native fishes through different pathways or during later life stages. invasive species can exert strong effects on native species through competitive interactions (persson & greenberg, 1990; prout et al., 1990; matthews et al., 1992; sutton & ney 2002). common carp impose a wide range of negative ecosystem effects (weber & brown, 2009, 2015) and use similar habitats (weber & brown, 2012) and prey resources (howell et al., 2014; letvin et al., unpublished data) as native fishes, indicating the potential for competitive interactions when prey resources are limited. however, results presented here suggest few interspecific competitive interactions occur between age- 0 common carp and bluegill or yellow perch in highly productive systems where prey resources may not be a limiting factor. thus, declines in native fish populations associated with increases in common carp abundance (jackson et al., 2010; weber & brown, 2011) may occur during later life stages or are a result of different mechanisms. acknowledgements we thank the technicians who helped collect and process samples for this project. partial funding for this project was provided by through the federal aid in sport fish restoration act study 1513 adminis- tered through south dakota department of game, fish, and parks and the south dakota state agricultural experiment station. references britton, j. r., boar, r. r., grey, j., foster, j., lugonzo, j., & harper, d. m.
