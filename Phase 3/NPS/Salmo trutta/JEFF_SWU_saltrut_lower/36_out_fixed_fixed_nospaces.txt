however, the lower migratory benefits and costs for mainstem- run individuals question whether the same mechanisms can be applied for stream- dwelling salmonids. in this study, we investigated main stem- run timing and body condition of partially migratory stream- dwelling dolly varden charr (salvelinus_malma) in the shiisorapuchi river in central hokkaido, japan. based on commonly observed patterns in sea- run and lake- run salmonids, we predicted that migration would occur during spring and consist predominantly of age 1 + females with some small subordi- nate males. traps were placed at the mouths of two small tributaries along the shiisorapuchi river periodically from may to december 2015. adipose fin samples were taken for dna to sex the individuals. consistent to initial predictions, down- stream movement occurs only once in the spring, dominated by age- 1 + females. trapped fishes (presumed migrants) were slightly longer but slimmer compared to the fish caught in the tributaries (presumed resident), which may be equivalent to smolts in anadromous populations. regardless of migratory habitat, mechanisms driving par- tial migration in salmonids may be the same as long as production between natal stream and feeding habitats is significantly different. k e y w o r d s alternative reproductive tactics, conditional strategy, fluvial-adfluvial, potamodromous, sex-biased migration, sex-linked marker 1 |  introduction partial migration, the division of a population into a migratory and a resident component, is a common phenomenon in many animal taxa, especially insects, birds, fishes, and some ungulates (chapman et al., 2012; jonsson & jonsson, 1993). elucidating the mechanisms main- taining residents and migrants within single populations provides significant insights into why migration has evolved and why different phenotypes can coexist without apparent genetic divergence (gross, 1987; morita, tamate, kuroki, & nagasawa, 2014; morita, yamamoto, & hoshino, 2000). in most instances, partial migration is governed by physiological tolerances, reduced competition, trophic polymorphism, niche shifts, and trade- offs between enhanced growth and increased mortality (brönmark et al., 2010; chapman, brönmark, nilsson, & hansson, 2011; dodson, aubin- horth, thériault, & páez, 2013; gross, coleman, & mcdowall, 1988; jonsson & jonsson, 1993). because of their biological characteristics, as well as commercial importance, partial migration has been extensively studied in salmo- nids (chapman et al., 2012; dodson et al., 2013; mcdowall, 1988). salmonids are one of the best examples of partial migration as migra- tory individuals undergo long- distance migration and exhibit extreme morphological dimorphism, often growing to be many times larger than ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:247–254. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  247 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd248  |     the residents, as well as developing more prominent secondary sexual characteristics (gross, 1985; jonsson & jonsson, 1993; régnier et al., 2015). a common pattern in partially migratory salmonids is female- biased migration. because size and fecundity (fertility also to a lesser extent) are strongly correlated, few female fish become resident when given the option to migrate (morita et al., 2014). small resident males, on the other hand, can realise high reproductive success by sneaking into large migratory pairs (fleming, 1996; thériault & dodson, 2003). therefore, both resident and migratory tactics (i.e. sneaking vs. fight- ing) may be maintained through disruptive selection (gross, 1985; koseki & maekawa, 2000). the mechanisms for coexistence of alternative reproductive tac- tics in male salmonids are explained by status- dependent conditional strategy, in which the body size at a juvenile stage determines whether individuals become residents or migrants (dodson et al., 2013; gross, 1996; morita et al., 2014). individuals with high growth rates in their early life, thus maturing early, become residents, whereas individ- uals with low growth rates continue growing and delay maturation by migrating, improving growth and potential fitness by moving to an area which provides better feeding opportunities (gross, 1996; thériault & dodson, 2003). another interpretation of the status- dependent decision- making is that the larger dominant individuals can hold territories within streams, thus becoming residents, whereas smaller subordinates need to seek other options by migrating (gross, 1996; morita et al., 2000, 2014; thériault & dodson, 2003; see also tachiki & koizumi, 2016). such decision- making likely occurs summer or autumn half a year before migration (metcalfe, 1991; metcalfe & thorpe, 1990). during the time of ocean migration, which normally occurs in spring, body size of migratory individuals often exceeds that of resident counterparts by compensating growth rates during winter (metcalfe, huntingford, & thorpe, 1988). such migratory individuals exhibit silvering (smolting) and more slender body shape (folmar & dickhoff, 1980). while partial migration has been mostly studied in sea- run or lake- run salmonids, migration within single river systems, such as between a tributary and its mainstem, is also common among stream- dwelling salmonids (northcote, 1997). migration within freshwater systems is often called “potamodromy,” but this includes lake- run populations. alternatively, migration within running water can be called “fluvial” migration. this terminology, however, is not widespread and often ambiguous. thus, in this paper, we used just common terms, such as migration and residency, and defined stream- dwelling populations as those using only running water habitat throughout their life. in such stream- dwelling populations, the existence of resident and migratory counterparts is suggested (bagliniére, maisse, lebail, & nihouarn, 1989; gresswell, 1997; meka, knudsen, douglas, & benter, 2003; northcote, 1997) but not often empirically substantiated mainly due to little morphological differences between residents and migrants (koizumi, yamamoto, & maekawa, 2006). lower migratory benefits and costs for main stem- run individuals compared to sea- run or lake- run individuals question whether the same mechanisms can be applied between these systems. for example, it is possible in stream- dwelling populations that mainstem- run could result merely from passively ayer et al. drifted individuals via water current often associated with intra- specific competition (chapman et al., 2011; dingle, 1996; mcdowall, 1988). in this case, this downstream movement is not a part of migration (i.e. directed movement often physiologically controlled, mcdowall, 1988), and adaptive mechanisms, such as trade- offs between growth and survival, are not applied. dolly varden charr salvelinus_malma in the shiisorapuchi river, central hokkaido, japan, is suitable to compare partial migration be- tween anadromous and stream- dwelling salmonids being one of only a few examples of partial migration recorded in wild stream- dwelling salmonids (koizumi et al., 2006). due to the environmental differences between small tributaries and larger mainstem, size dimorphism is observed between residents and migrants, although the difference is much smaller (i.e., 70–120 mm in fork length for residents and 130–200 mm for migrants) compared to those observed in sea- run or lake- run populations (koizumi et al., 2006). in addition, female- biased migration is also apparent in this population; roughly half of males be- come migrants, whereas more than 80% of females become migrants (koizumi et al., 2006). in this study, we investigated downstream movement patterns of partially migratory stream- dwelling dolly varden to infer the mech- anisms for the coexistence of tributary residents and mainstem mi- grants. specifically, we tested three major hypotheses based on the findings from sea- run or lake- run salmonids. first, if the mainstem- run is physiologically controlled rather than passive downstream drift, age- and/or season- specific movement will be observed. most salmonids smolt during spring to maximise the duration of their main growing season (jonsson et al., 1991; metcalfe & thorpe, 1990; rowe & thorpe, 1990). thus, we expected that migration predominantly oc- curs during spring with age- 1 + individuals as age- 2 + or older fish are rare in the small tributaries of the shiisorapuchi river (koizumi et al., 2006). passive downstream movement of age- 0 + is also common in salmonids, especially during high flow (dingle, 1996; mcdowall, 1988). this passive movement is likely to occur throughout much of the year, and we expected that small numbers of passive dispersers would be caught moving to the mainstem throughout the summer and autumn. in anadromous populations, nonsmolting passive dispersers will most likely die upon reaching the sea; however, in stream- dwelling populations, such individuals do not need to adapt for salinity con- straints and may be able to attain increased size/fitness like any other migrant. second, we tested if downstream movement is biased to females, which is commonly observed in sea- run and lake- run pop- ulations, although this is already shown from the patterns of return- ing adults (koizumi et al., 2006). finally, we examined if difference in body size or condition is observed between residents and migrants. as mentioned earlier, migrating individuals are often longer (but maybe skinner) during migratory season in anadromous populations (folmar & dickhoff, 1980), which might hold true for the stream- dwelling pop- ulation. alternatively, because no drastic preparation like smolting would be required for migration between the mainstem and tributary habitat, mainstem- run individuals may simply be small subordinates forced to leave tributaries. to test these predictions, we set down- stream traps periodically at the confluence between mainstem and ayer et al. two small tributaries in the shiisorapuchi river. individual fish caught by the traps, which are presumed to be migrants, were compared to those caught by electrofishing in the tributaries, which are presumed as resident. we also employed a recently developed sex- linked marker (yano et al., 2012) to investigate the sex ratio of potential migrants and residents. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study site the shiisorapuchi river is located in central hokkaido, japan, and is one of the several major branches of the sorachi river system, all of which combine and empty into the kanayama reservoir (figure 1). the shiisorapuchi river possesses a number of small tributaries, usually between 0.5 and 2 metres in width and less than 500 m in total length, which flow into the mainstem (koizumi & maekawa, 2004; koizumi & shimatani, 2016). these are categorised into two main groups: spring fed and nonspring- fed tributaries. dolly varden dominate in spring- fed tributaries, whereas other species coexist in nonspring- fed tributaries, such as white- spotted charr s. leucomaenis (koizumi & maekawa, 2003). dolly varden charr salvelinus_malma distributed widely in fresh and salt water throughout the north pacific and into the arctic. although many landlocked populations have been observed, dolly varden are primarily migratory, and these individuals are morphologically distinct from resident/landlocked individuals in size and appearance (froese & pauly, 2014). in the shiisorapuchi river system, dolly varden use small tributaries as spawning and nursery habitats and the mainstem as feeding habitat, similar to anadromous salmonids which use rivers for nurseries and the ocean for feeding (koizumi et al., 2006). they are restricted to the tributaries and mainstem (i.e. stream- dwelling pop- ulation, not lacustrine, or lake- run), as there are no records of dolly varden being caught by fishing or gill- net in the kanayama reservoir and individuals rarely exceed 200 mm (koizumi et al., 2006). figure 1 location of the shiisorapuchi river and the study tributaries kumanosawa (ku) and sikanosawa (si)     |  249 field survey was conducted in two of the tributaries, kumanosawa (ku) and sikanosawa (si), which are both originated from spring- fed sources (figure 1). the total length (i.e. from the confluence to head- water), mean width, water discharge, and temperature are 129–322 m, 1.4–3.2 m, 0.03–0.4 m3/s, 6°c in ku and si respectively (koizumi & maekawa, 2003). ku and si were chosen for field sampling because both are typical spring- fed tributaries in this river system and good nurseries for dolly varden with high density (koizumi, yamamoto, nomoto, & maekawa, 2008; koizumi et al., 2006). in the lower reaches and the main stem, several other fish species can also be found, such as: white- spotted charr s. leucomaenis, freshwater sculpin cottus nozawae, sakhalin taimen parahucho_perryi, brook lamprey lethenteron sp., and siberian stone loach barbatula toni (koizumi, hasegawa, & kishi, 2012). 2.2 | field sampling to monitor seasonal timing of downstream movement, we set traps periodically from may to december 2015 in tributaries ku and si. the first sampling term was a short period in early may (15- 17), followed by a long period at the end of may (22- june 1), and also from june to december, sampling was conducted for 6 days (traps in the water for 5 days) at the end of every month. during sampling periods, the first day was used for placement, and then roughly every 24 hr afterwards, the traps are checked for fish and cleaned to prevent blockages or overflow. we constructed a fyke net trap, with the wings blocking access downstream and shaped to direct migrating fish towards the basket (40 by 20 cm, 5- cm- radius opening, 5- mm square mesh) located ap- proximately in the centre of the tributary’s flow. traps were positioned to the confluence with the mainstem in ku; however, due to the lack of suitable site near the confluence in si, we set the trap 70 m up- stream from the confluence. fish captured were anaesthetised with fa100 (ds pharma animal health co., ltd.), measured (fork length to the nearest 1 mm), weighed (to the nearest 0.1 g), and their adipose fins were clipped and stored in 70% ethanol for the subsequent dna analysis for sexing. we dis- tinguished age- 0 + , age- 1 + , and older fishes based on the length frequency distribution and previous experiences based on mark- recapture methods (e.g. koizumi et al., 2006). although there may be some overlap between age- 1 + and older fishes, the estimation error should not change the results qualitatively. sampled fish were released below the trap to avoid recapture. we considered the fish captured by the downstream traps as potential migrants, although it may include passive and/or random downstream dispersal. to compare body size, weight, and sex ratio between potential migrants and residents, we also sampled fishes in the tributaries by a backpack electrofisher (smith- root, model 12b- pow). fish caught in the tributaries are considered as potential residents, although it in- cludes migrants yet to leave. we collected fish from the entire reach of both tributaries using the electrofisher. two electrofishing sur- veys were conducted, the first during the final day of the late may sampling after traps were removed, and the second during an annual dolly varden population census (e.g. koizumi et al., 2008) after june 250  |     ayer et al. sampling traps were removed. in the annual census in june, we esti- mated the population sizes by three- pass removal methods with dif- ferent age classes separately (koizumi et al., 2008). in may sampling, only one- pass electrofishing was conducted, and we targeted age 1 +  and 2 + because age 0 + were often difficult to collect due to small body size. because most individuals caught by the traps were in may (see results), we compared body size and condition of putative mi- grants and residents using may samples. age composition was com- pared between the individuals caught by the traps in may and the age composition estimated from the removal method in june. of the samples collected by trap during may, 96% and 85% were of the 1 + age group in ku and si respectively (table 1). for other sea- sons (june- december), 58% were age- 0 + (11 fish for age- 0 + , 7 for age- 1 + , and 1 for older, combining both ku and si due to small sample size). the age compositions of trapped fish in may were significantly skewed to age- 1 + compared to those collected by electrofishing in the tributaries (chi square test, p < .001 for both tributaries; table 1). therefore, we considered the active migration was the age- 1 + fish in may, and subsequently compared the length, weight, and sex ratio between putative migrants and residents in this category. 2.3 | sex determination total dna was extracted from collected fin tissues by the puregene dna isolation kit (applied biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sexing was done through pcr targeting loci on the male y- chromosome (sdy e2s1 and sdy e2as4) and x- chromosome (18s s and 18s as) following the protocol of yano et al. (2012). after pcr, products were electrophoresed with 2% agarose gel; individuals with both the sdy and 18s loci present were counted as male, whereas indi- viduals with only the 18s loci present were considered as female. sex- linked marker has potential biases in salmonids, for example, by the mismatch of phenotypic and genotypic sexes (brykov, kukhlevsky, & podlesnykh, 2010; yamamoto, kitanishi, tamate, & suzuki, 2012). the markers developed by yano et al. (2012), however, are highly reliable within and across species. we also confirmed with an initial 10 adults with known sexes, and then multiple tests of previously sexed individu- als were performed with randomly chosen positive controls to insure consistency. thus, the methodological bias should be minimal if any. 2.4 | data analysis sex ratios and fork length between putative migrants and residents were compared using chi square test and t test respectively. to compare body condition between migrant and resident, we initially used ancova with the body length as a covariate (figure 2). however, the slopes were significantly different between the two categories. thus, we calculated body condition using fulton’s condition factor (k) as k=105 × bw/fl3 (barnham & baxter, 1998; nash, valencia, & geffen, 2006). because the k was no longer dependent on body length, we compared the condition factor between residents and migrants with t test. all the statistic tests were performed on r 3.2.1 (r core team 2015). 3 |  results figure 2 length–weight relationship of age-1 + putative migrants (i.e. caught by trap) and residents (i.e. caught by electricfisher) in ku (top) and si (bottom). regression lines of migrants (solid line) and residents (dashed line) and their equations and r-square values are also described table 1 age compositions of putative migrants (i.e. fish collected by the downstream trap) and residents (fish collected by the electrofishing) in ku and si 0+ 1+ >=2+ over the total sampling period, we collected 26 dolly varden in ku and 81 in si from the traps. peak of the downstream movement oc- curred only once in may (figure 3). in ku, 81% of the fish were col- lected during may with the daily average of 1.6 individuals, whereas the daily average was just 0–0.6 in other months. similarly, 83% of the fish were collected during may in si with the daily average of 4.8 fish, whereas the daily averages in other months were 0–0.6. ku si migrant resident migrant resident 2 (9%) 325 (79%) 0 (0%) 258 (78%) 17 (81%) 65 (16%) 64 (96%) 65 (20%) 2 (10%) 3 (<1%) 3 (4%) 8 (2%) ayer et al. figure 3 seasonal timing of downstream movement in stream- dwelling dolly varden. the cpue (individuals/day) of traps for each sampling period in ku (top) and si (bottom). may sampling was conducted in early may (e) and late may (l) table 2 sex ratios of putative migrants (i.e. fish collected by the downstream trap) and residents (fish collected by the electrofishing) in ku and si. p- values of chi- square tests (from 1:1) are also shown male female p- value ku si migrant resident migrant resident 8 33 25 36 8 21 42 27 1.00 .10 .04 .26 of the age- 1 + dolly varden collected by the traps during may, 50% and 63% were female in ku and si respectively (table 2). on the other hand, in a total of 82 and 80 dolly varden collected by electrofishing in ku and si, 39% and 43% were females in ku and si respectively (table 2). thus, trapped fish were biased towards fe- males compared to fish caught in the tributaries for both tributaries, although the difference was only statistically significant for trapped fish in si (chi square test, p = .04). in the age- 1 +  dolly varden collected during may, when both sexes were combined, only si had a difference in fork length between fish caught by trap and those by electrofishing, with the trapped fish being significantly longer, while ku had no difference (t test, p = .01 and .92 for si and ku respectively; figure 4). however, condition     |  251 factor was significantly higher in fish caught by electrofishing than those caught by traps in both tributaries (t test, p < .01 for both tribu- taries; figure 4, see also figure 2). when analysed each sex separately, there was no significant difference in length in both si and ku (t test, p = .22 and .98 for si and ku respectively), but condition factor was significantly higher in males for both tributaries (t test, p < .01 for both tributaries; figure 5). 4 |  discussion this is the first study to explicitly examine the mechanisms for life history divergence in partially migratory stream- dwelling salmonids inferred from the patterns of downstream movement. downstream movement occurred predominantly in spring, and most individuals were age- 1 + females. putative migrants tended to be longer but slim- mer than residents. these results are largely consistent with the previ- ously reported migration patterns in sea- run and lake- run salmonids. although there certainly are some differences, such as the needs for smolting, the mechanisms driving partial migration may be essentially the same in salmonids as long as the productivity of primary and sec- ondary feeding habitats is significantly different (gross, 1987; gross et al., 1988). two alternative hypotheses existed in explaining the coexistence of small tributary residents and large mainstem forms in the stream- dwelling dolly varden. the first hypothesis is the adaptation to local environment, in which alternative phenotypes use low- risk, low- return (i.e. tributary) and high- risk, high- return (mainstem) habitat respec- tively (koizumi et al., 2006). the alternative hypothesis is that main- stem individuals are merely passively drifted individuals that survived by chance in the mainstem. the directed movement patterns in this population (i.e. peak in spring, female- biased) support the adaptive hypothesis. while there is a possibility that some age- 0 + managed to slip through the mesh of our traps, it is likely not significant, as traps were capable of catching fish well within the age- 0 + size range (at least fish larger than 40 mm, koizumi, unpublished data). in may, age- 0 + fish are small (30–40 mm), and some might have left the tribu- taries, but they would rarely become large mainstem- run type because such small fish would face lower survival in the mainstem (e.g. strong water current, high predation pressure): in fact, few age- 0 + fish were collected in the mainstem in june (koizumi et al., 2006). in summary, although some mainstem- run may result from nonadaptive passive dispersal events, most mainstem- run would result from individuals that migrate to the mainstem at age- 1 + spring. finding a female bias among migratory individuals may have been expected, but finding an overall difference in condition among males and females within tributaries was somewhat of a surprise because no such pattern has been reported in stream- dwelling sal- monids. it is likely that sexually dimorphic behaviours and feeding regimes start when salmonids are juveniles (nagata & irvine, 1997; greenberg & giller, 2001; johnsson, sernland, & blixt, 2001; but see dittman, quinn, & volk, 1998); however, there is still little data on sexual dimorphisms in juveniles from wild populations (régnier 252  |     ayer et al. figure 4 fork length (upper panels) and condition factor k (lower panels) of age- 1 + putative migrants (i.e. caught by trap) and residents (i.e. caught by electricfisher) in populations ku (left panels) and si (right panels) p-values of t-tests are also shown figure 5 fork length (upper panels) and condition factor k (lower panels) of age- 1 + males and females in populations ku (left panels) and si (right panels) p-values of t-tests are also shown et al., 2015). elucidating sexual differences at juvenile stages has required the dissection of individuals, which significantly limits ap- plications. findings of this study can therefore be seen as a useful field test on the feasibility of the sdy gene primers on distinguish- ing male and female wild juvenile salmonids. the reason why males were heavier than females in this study may be related to the high proportion of females among migrants. as migrants are lighter than residents, the females are therefore more likely to be of lighter than the males. the most notable result in the present study is the difference in body size and condition between residents and migrants. putative migrants were of similar or longer fl but slimmer than residents, which could be equivalent to smolts in anadromous populations (jonsson & jonsson, 1993; nicieza & metcalfe, 1997). during early life, poten- tial smolts are smaller than residents but go through increased growth prior to migration (metcalfe et al., 1988), which is linked to higher sur- vivorship among migrating fish (thériault & dodson, 2003). if this is the case for the dolly varden, life history divergence should be deter- mined during summer or autumn of age- 0 + , which seems very early considering the apparent lack of preparation for mainstem migration in aget- 1 + spring (e.g. short migration distance, no osmoregulation). alternatively, the longer and slimmer migrants are not smolt- like ayer et al. individuals but may be those who have high metabolic rates. small tributaries provide lower growth opportunity (koizumi et al., 2006), which is probably due to limited food resources or lower temperature. therefore, individuals with high metabolisms cannot get adequate nourishment to maintain the same rate of body condition in the trib- utaries and may need to move to the mainstem. in this scenario, mi- gratory individuals should be always larger than residents even during early life stages. in fact, this pattern is also known in anadromous pop- ulations, especially in northern ranges where productivity in stream environments is poor and most individuals migrate to the ocean (rowe & thorpe, 1990; nicieza & metcalfe, 1997; forseth, næsje, jonsson, & hårsaker, 1999; see also jonsson & jonsson, 1993). these alterna- tive mechanisms can be tested by monitoring the growth trajectory of individuals from early life stages (e.g. summer of age- 0 + ), although individual identification for such small fish is challenging. although sil- vering was not observed, migratory dolly varden may change some physiology similar with anadromous migrants. cortisol, growth hor- mone, and thyroxine (t4) are considered three of the most import- ant hormones in premigratory juvenile fish (munakata, amano, ikuta, kitamura, & aida, 2007; munakata, miura, & matsuda, 2014) and may prove useful in future studies. as salmonids have evolved from stream- dwelling fishes, the study of partial migration in stream- dwelling populations may shed light on the ancestral conditions which prompted the development of anad- romous behaviour (gross, 1987; gross et al., 1988; mcdowall, 1988). however, it remains unknown whether partial migration of the dolly varden in this population evolved from an entirely resident population (from the viewpoint of genetic architecture) with similar mechanisms to anadromous salmonids (i.e. parallel evolution), or that it is achieved by retaining characteristics from recent ancestors (i.e. standing genetic variation). this population should have originated from anadromous dolly varden that had colonised hokkaido and were subsequently landlocked after glacial periods (yamamoto et al. 2014). recent de- velopment of genomic analysis would reveal further details of migra- tory behaviour in salmonids (pearse, miller, abadía- cardoso, & garza, 2014). acknowledgements we appreciate valuable comments from drs. t. noda, t. takada, and two anonymous reviewers on earlier versions of the manuscript. this work was partially supported by a grant- in- aid for young scientists (b) to i.k.
