lake_trout; ecosystem management; deepwater cisco; great lakes introduction understanding recruitment variability is a high prior- ity for fishery managers and scientists given the dis- proportionate impact that recruitment can have on fisheries production (houde 1987; myers & barrow- man 1996; walters & martell 2004). although spawning stock size (best characterised as population egg production) must play some role in shaping recruitment, nearly a century of research has demon- strated that additional factors underlie recruitment variation. for example, the importance of overlap between first-feeding larvae and their prey (hjort 1914; cushing 1968), the role of predation on early life stages (mills et al. 1987; leggett & deblois 1994; mason & brandt 1996; riley & marsden 2009), as well as the impact of climatic variables (leggett et al. 1984; brown et al. 1993; hurst 2007) each has explained recruitment variability in fish pop- ulations. incorporating these variables into models that traditionally were based only on spawning stock size also is consistent with the move towards ecosys- tem-based fishery management. bloater coregonus_hoyi is a freshwater fish ende- mic to four of five laurentian great lakes. as an adult, it occupies the offshore, hypolimnetic waters and undergoes diel vertical migrations within this hab- itat to feed upon benthic macroinvertebrates and zoo- plankton (tewinkel & fleischer 1999). it spawns in this cold environment between january and march, and its eggs incubate for up to 4 months (rice et al. 1987b). up to the 4th week of life, larvae remain ben- thic; then, larvae undergo an ontogenetic shift to the warmer pelagic waters for up to their first year or two (crowder & crawford 1984; rice et al. 1987b) before shifting back to the hypolimnion as an adult. in the three lakes where it remains extant (superior, michi- gan and huron), bloater has exhibited a synchronous correspondence: david b. bunnell, usgs great lakes science center, 1451 green rd, ann arbor, mi 48105, usa. e-mail: dbunnell@usgs.gov 604 doi: 10.1111/eff.12112 table 1. factors that have been hypothesised to influence recruitment of bloater in lake michigan female predominance: too few males cause females to not spawn or limit fertilisation of eggs that are spawned. condition-dependent fecundity: reduced condition of adults has reduced size-dependent fecundity. climate: cold winters could prolong egg incubation period and increase vulnerability of eggs to predators. starvation of first-feeding larvae: too few zooplankton available to feed upon after yolk-sac absorption is complete; starvation could also increase vulnerability to predation. cannibalism: bloaters increase egg predation as spawning stock size increases and also can consume their own larvae in the laboratory. egg predation by other species: slimy sculpin and deepwater sculpin consume bloater eggs. predation on larvae and juvenile age-0 bloater by other species: nonindigenous adult alewife and rainbow smelt consume bloater up to 76 mm total length. references brown et al.

(2008) recruitment pattern (bunnell et al. 2010) that is some- what unusual among fish populations. unlike most populations that exhibit strong interannual variability, bloater populations undergo 10–15 years of relatively strong recruitment followed by 10–15 years of rela- tively weak recruitment (bunnell et al. 2006). several explanations for this pattern have been pro- posed (table 1), and although some have been evalu- ated, the key underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. conventional stock/recruitment models cannot be applied to the lake michigan bloater popu- lation given its nonstationary recruitment pattern (i.e., the relationship between population egg production and recruitment varies with time; see walters 1987). in essence, similar numbers of eggs were produced in the mid-1980s and late 1990s, yet recruitment was two orders of magnitude higher in the mid-1980s (bunnell et al. 2006). even accounting for changes in size-specific fecundity over these years failed to remove the nonstationary pattern (bunnell et al. 2009). time series models that accounted for nonsta- tionarity revealed adult sex ratio to be the strongest predictor of recruitment in both lake michigan (bun- nell et al. 2006) and lake huron (collingsworth et al. in press): years with a higher proportion of females (could exceed 90% in some years) among all adults tended to produce weaker year-classes. none- theless, the mechanism by which an excessive num- egg predation effects on bloater recruitment ber of females (or a relatively low number of males) could limit recruitment success has yet to be eluci- dated, in part, because of the lack of knowledge of bloater-spawning behaviour. starvation of first-feeding larvae could be hypothes- ised given the shifts in zooplankton community com- position that have occurred during the past decades, including declines in small cladoceran zooplankton (barbiero & tuchman 2004; barbiero et al. 2012) that can be an important prey for first-feeding larvae. yet, bloater hatch at relatively large sizes (~10 mm, auer 1982), which should confer reduced risk of starvation (miller et al. 1988). furthermore, laboratory studies have revealed that 50% of bloater larvae can survive without food for up to 25 days after hatch (rice et al. 1987a). finally, the recruitment synchrony that was observed across lakes superior, michigan and huron suggests that some broad regional climate variable could be driving the long-term recruitment variability (bunnell et al. 2010). yet no regional climate index (e.g., pacific decadal oscillation, el ni~no-southern oscillation and arctic oscillation) was synchronised with the regional bloater recruitment pattern (d. b. bunnell, unpublished data), and time series analyses within lakes michigan and huron revealed minimal explanatory power of climate variables (bunnell et al. 2006; collingsworth et al. in press). herein, we sought to evaluate the hypothesis that predation on early life history stages could be regu- lating bloater recruitment variability in lake michi- gan, with the assumption that if it were found to be important in this lake, then it might also be important in lakes huron and superior. in theory, predation could regulate bloater recruitment under three differ- ent scenarios. first, nonindigenous adult alewives al- osa pseudoharengus are effective predators of fish larvae (hoagman 1974; rice et al. 1987a; krueger et al. 1995), and when bloater recruitment in the late 1970s began increasing while alewife densities declined, some hypothesised that predation by adult alewife on bloater larvae had been a recruitment bot- tleneck (e.g., eck & wells 1987). more recent stud- ies, however, have discounted this hypothesis given the limited spatiotemporal overlap between adult ale- wife and pelagic bloater larvae (madenjian et al. 2008) and the lack of explanatory power of adult ale- wife in bloater recruitment models (bunnell et al. 2006). juvenile and even adult bloater also can com- prise relatively small proportions of the diets of rain- bow smelt osmerus mordax (stedman & argyle 1985), lake_trout (madenjian et al. 1998) and even burbot lota lota (fratt et al. 1997), yet these are not believed to be sufficiently high to negatively affect their population dynamics. the second and third sce- narios involve predation on incubating bloater eggs or even benthic yolk-sac larvae. cannibalism could 605 bunnell et al. be occurring given that fish eggs (though not con- firmed as bloater) were observed in bloater diets during april (wells & beeton 1963). although can- nibalism could explain poor recruitment at high spawning stock sizes, it fails to account for the non- stationary recruitment pattern (i.e., under similar lev- els of egg production, why would cannibalism be high during some periods and low during others). additionally, native slimy sculpin cottus cognatus and deepwater sculpin myoxocephalus thompsonii are known to consume fish eggs during march and april (wells 1980), and a companion study to ours confirmed that bloater were included among the spe- cies of eggs consumed by sculpins in 2009–2010 (mychek-londer et al. 2013). in this article, we evaluated the hypothesis that egg predation by slimy and deepwater sculpin regulated the recruitment of bloater in lake michigan between 1973 and 2009. first, we used a long-term data set to demonstrate that bloater recruitment to age 3 was inversely related to the biomass of slimy, but not deepwater, sculpin. second, to determine whether this relationship was causal, we developed models to pre- dict annual consumption of bloater eggs by slimy sculpin dating back to 1973 and compared the pro- portion of bloater eggs consumed with corresponding bloater recruitment three years later. although no field relationship was uncovered between deepwater sculpin and bloater recruitment, we also modelled consumption by deepwater sculpin given that both deepwater and slimy sculpin were found to consume bloater eggs during february through may, 2009– 2010 (mychek-londer et al. 2013). methods relationship between bloater recruitment and sculpin biomass biomass and abundance of bloater, slimy sculpin and deepwater sculpin were derived from a u.s. geologi- cal survey (usgs) bottom trawl study that has annu- ally sampled up to 11 depths (ranging from 9 to 110 m in approximately 10-m strata) at seven sites during the day in lake michigan in the fall since 1973 (for additional details see bunnell et al. 2006). at each depth and site combination, a 12-m yankee bottom trawl was fished for up to 10 min. area swept (in ha, width of the net multiplied by actual time on bottom) was estimated as a function of fish- ing depth (d, in min) according to the following equation (bunnell et al. net = 3.232 + 7.678 2013): (1   e bottom = tt   0.945 + (0.056 9 d). the catch from each haul was sorted to species, weighed to the nearest g, in m) and tow time (tt, width  0.0449d); time the of actual on 606 and up to 100 individuals were randomly selected for the measurement of total length (tl) to the nearest mm. when catches exceeded 20 kg, the total catch was weighed and a random subsample was processed as previously described and extrapolated by direct proportion. to index bloater recruitment, age for fish captured from four sites (frankfort, mi; manistique, mi; sau- gatuck, mi; waukegan, il) were determined using scales. between 1973 and 1982, scales were removed from a random selection of bloaters at each site, whereas after 1982, scales were removed from the first 10 fish encountered from each 10-mm-length class. age was estimated counting the number of annuli on a projected scale image. bloater ages ran- ged from 0 to 13 years, but we assume that scales provide an unbiased age estimate only up to age 6 (bunnell et al. 2012a). abundance of age-3 bloater was used as an index of recruitment because interpre- tation of catch curves revealed that individuals do not fully recruit to the bottom trawl until that age (bun- nell et al. 2006). even though age-3 abundance is rel- atively late to assess year-class strength, abundance of age-0 bloater in lake michigan was positively related (r = 0.68; bunnell et al. 2010) to the number of age-3 bloater sampled three years later. to estimate the abundance of age-3 bloater in a given year, we developed ‘keys’ that assigned proba- bilistic distributions of fish age and sex for each 10- mm-length bin (for details see bunnell et al. 2006). to calculate ‘lakewide’ abundance for each age class (including those older than 6 years), we first calcu- lated the average numeric density (number of fish per ha) for each depth stratum, multiplied by the repre- sentative surface area, and summed across depth strata (which included depths from 5 to 114 m). to estimate the mean ‘lakewide’ biomass (kgha  1) of slimy and deepwater sculpins, we used a similar approach to bloater, in that, we first calculated the average density (kgha  1) for each depth stratum. we then calculated the weighted average biomass across depth strata, where the surface area of each depth stra- tum was the weighting factor. finally, we plotted den- sity of age-3 bloater recruits as a function of slimy or deepwater sculpin biomass density three years earlier, when the eggs were incubating for that particular year-class. given the pattern in the scatterplot, we fit  bx) using non- an exponential decay function (y = ae linear regression, where y equals bloater recruitment and x equals sculpin biomass. evaluating egg predation mechanism through simulation modelling to estimate bloater egg production in each year, we calculated mean size and abundance of females in all age classes. we assumed that abundance and size dis- tribution of bloaters in autumn were unchanged by the time spawning began 4 months later. for each age class, we multiplied the proportion of females that were mature (estimated in bunnell et al. 2012a) by the numeric abundance and applied one fecundity versus weight relationship (using average weight per year) between 1973 and 1983 (when bloater condi- tion was high) and another relationship between 1984 and 2009 (when bloater condition was low, bunnell et al. 2009). population egg production equalled the sum of eggs produced across age classes. we generated a lakewide bloater egg consumption estimate for both slimy and deepwater sculpin during 2009 using two methods. the first method used an individual-based modelling (ibm) approach to incor- porate empirically based variability in the sizes, diet proportions and daily rations of each sculpin species. alternatively, the second method modelled the con- sumption of an average individual. we found that these two different estimates produced nearly identi- cal results (appendix s1); hence, we used the second (simpler) method to estimate lakewide bloater egg consumption between 1973 and 2010 and provide those details below. consumption of bloater eggs by an average indi- vidual sculpin was dependent upon a series of equa- tions (fig. 1, table 2). first, the average size for each sculpin species was calculated using data from the usgs bottom trawl survey. specifically, for each species, we calculated the mean tl among those individuals that were larger than the minimum size average size sculpin that consumes bloater eggs average daily ration average proportion bloater eggs in diet number of days bloater eggs consumed sculpin population abundance weight/number of bloater eggs consumed by population egg predation effects on bloater recruitment that consumed bloater eggs in 2009–2010: ≥40 mm tl for slimy sculpins and ≥91 mm tl for deepwater sculpins. sculpin lengths were not regularly measured in the survey prior to 1999. therefore, we applied the mean tl of slimy sculpins between 1999 and 2012 (68.9 mm, which did not vary across those years: f1,12 = 1.6; p = 0.23) to earlier years. for deepwater sculpin, mean tl declined annually between 1999 and 2012 (f1,12 = 12.2; p = 0.005), which led us to apply the mean tl of deepwater sculpins between 1999 and 2002 (118.8 mm) to earlier years. the index of fullness (g dry prey consumed per g dry fish) was estimated as a function of the mean weight (table 2) of sculpin in each year. predicted daily ration (g dry prey consumed) was then estimated by multiplying index of fullness by 24 and the labora- tory-based gastric evacuation rates (mychek-londer & bunnell 2013) developed for each species (table 2). the proportion of the diet that included bloater eggs was based on field-collected samples of sculpin, where eggs in the diets were assigned to species through genetic techniques (mychek-londer et al. 2013). bloater eggs occurred in 11% of both slimy (n = 1016) and deepwater sculpin (n = 735) diets in 2009–2010. to explore whether the presence of bloater eggs in the diet was influenced by day of the year, depth of capture or fish size, we used logistic regres- sion. details of these analyses can be found in appen- dix s2, and the results led us to ignore these effects. as a result, we multiplied the mean proportion of bloater eggs in the diet of each species by its daily ration and then divided by the dry/wet weight ratio of bloater eggs (table 2) to estimate the wet weight of bloater eggs consumed by an average individual per day. to extrapolate to the population, for each species, we multiplied the daily bloater egg consumption (by an average individual) by the lakewide abundance of those larger than the minimum size that consumed bloater eggs. to convert from daily to seasonal con- sumption for each species, we multiplied the average daily consumption by 90; pooling both 2009 and 2010, diets were analysed at monthly intervals rang- ing between 12 january and 11 june for deepwater sculpins and between 12 january and 20 may for slimy sculpins, yet bloater eggs were found no earlier than 18 february and no later than 18 may, which spanned 90 days. to convert to the total number of bloater eggs consumed by sculpins in a given year, we divided the weight of bloater eggs by 0.004 g (the average wet weight of one bloater egg, j. my- chek-londer, unpublished data). fig. 1. steps undertaken to estimate the number of eggs con- sumed by the deepwater or slimy sculpin population when ignor- ing individual variability (for contrast see appendix s1 that incorporated observed variability). results using the long-term data set, recruitment of age-3 bloaters was inversely related to the biomass of slimy 607 bunnell et al. table 2. equations and constants used to predict consumption of bloater eggs by slimy and deepwater sculpin in lake michigan between 1973 and 2010 (for further details see mychek-londer & bunnell 2013). wet weight (ww, in grams) to total length (tl, in mm) regression daily ration (g dry weight prey per day) dry weight (dw)/ww ratios slimy sculpin deepwater sculpin  6 tl3.330  24  0:0115  dw ww = 3.195  0:47 1.60 dw 100 0.216  6 tl3.210  24  0:0147  dw ww = 3.627  0:55 1.58dw 100 0.209 mean proportion (dry weight) of bloater eggs in diet smallest size (tl) in which bloater eggs were found in the diet range of dates over which bloater eggs were found in the diet 0.034 40 18 february–18 may 0.017 91 18 february–18 may ) 3 - e g a ( s t i u r c e r r e t a o b l f o s n o i l l i m 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0.0 (a) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 kg/ha, slimy sculpins 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 (b) 25 (c) 0 10 5 kg/ha, deepwater sculpins 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 25 kg/ha, all sculpins fig. 2. bloater recruitment (indexed at age 3) in lake michigan for the 1973 through 2009 year-classes as a function of the bio- mass of (a) slimy sculpin, (b) deepwater sculpin and (c) deepwater and slimy sculpins.

(fig. 2c, f1,35 = 0.0; p = 1.00), pin biomass was combined, no relationship was apparent likely because deepwater sculpin biomass was, on average, 43 times greater than that of slimy sculpin between 1973 and 2010. between 1973 and 2005, deepwater sculpins were always predicted to consume more bloater eggs than slimy sculpins (fig. 3). between 2006 and 2010, however, the pattern was reversed in every year except 2007. in general, only years early (1975– 1980) and late (2008–2010) in the time series did the combined consumption by sculpins comprise a sub- stantial (≥0.25) proportion of egg production. only in 2009 did the estimated consumption of eggs exceed the estimated bloater egg production, and in this year, consumption was estimated to be 2.3 times greater than bloater egg production. despite the occurrence of substantial consumption in some years, the correlative relationship identified from field sampling was not reproduced when the mechanistic modelling results were applied. for slimy sculpins (fig. 4a), bloater recruitment was highly variable when the proportion of bloater eggs consumed was extremely low (i.e., <0.03), and then, ) s n o i l l i m ( s t i u r c e r r e t a o b 3 -

(2010) reported slimy sculpin densities on offshore, rocky reefs in lake michigan that were two orders of magnitude higher than the highest annual estimate in our survey. finally, bottom trawl sam- pling during the day does not capture 100% of bloa- ters or sculpins in its path, owing either to gear avoidance or behaviours that cause fish to either be 609 bunnell et al. burrowed in the substrate below where the net passes or above the height of the net. comparisons between day and night bottom trawls in lakes michigan and superior have revealed that night-time estimates for slimy and deepwater sculpin abundances are at least five times greater than daytime ones (brandt et al. 1980; yule et al. 2008). in contrast, daytime esti- mates for bloater abundance were not different from those that summed estimates from night bottom trawls and acoustics with mid-water trawls (yule et al. 2007). sources of variation beyond sculpin abundance influenced our consumption estimate. for example, the number of days over which we assumed sculpins were consuming bloater eggs was constrained by our sampling, which was approximately monthly. more frequent sampling may have improved the accuracy of this estimate. additionally, we assumed that diets of sculpins in 2009–2010 could be applied back to 1973. although no previous studies identified fish eggs to species, coarse comparisons can be made between pro- portion of all fish eggs in the diet in 2009–2010 (janu- ary–may, mychek-londer et al. 2013) and in the 1960s and 1970s (march–november, wells 1980) at comparable depths. for slimy sculpins, the proportion of all fish eggs was comparable (0.04 in 1965–1966; 0.06 in 2009–2010), although the per cent occurrence declined between 1965 and 1966 (27%) and 2009 and 2010 (14%). for deepwater sculpins, the proportion of all fish eggs was over three times higher in 2009–2010 (0.07) than in 1965–1966 and 1974–1975 (0.02), and the per cent occurrence was also higher in the latter years (25% vs. 14%). hence, we can speculate that applying the 2009–2010 diet proportions to earlier years seemed reasonable for slimy sculpins but may have overestimated the importance of bloater eggs for deepwater sculpins prior to 2009. we acknowledge that our estimate of egg con- sumption did not include other possible egg preda- tors, including bloater, round goby and invertebrates such as mysis spp. and crayfish. although wells & beeton (1963) reported a relatively high per cent occurrence of fish eggs from lake michigan bloater diets in april 1962 (30% in depths 49–77 m, 56% in depths 78–110 m), we quantified the diets of 294 lake michigan bloater from january through may, 2009–2010 (at the same offshore depths where scul- pins were sampled) and found only 1 individual that consumed fish eggs (0.3% occurrence); 10 of 180 eggs in that diet were randomly sampled for genetic analysis and, all were determined to be bloater (w. stott, michigan state university, personal com- munication). similarly, diets from 552 round gobies sampled during winter and spring, 2009–2010 (at the same depths as sculpins and bloaters) revealed only rare (1%) occurrence of fish egg consumption 610 (mychek-londer et al. 2013). examination of mysis diets has revealed their capability to eat prey far lar- ger than bloater eggs, yet no fish eggs have ever been found in their diets (e.g., johannsson et al. 2001; nordin et al. 2008). finally, although crayfish can be effective egg predators in the great lakes (fitzsi- mons et al. 2002), they likely do not occur at depths where bloater spawn. thus, our focus on slimy and deepwater sculpin likely included the most important egg predators in offshore lake michigan. given these above caveats, how might future research improve our understanding of the relation- ship between sculpin predation and bloater recruit- ment? first, researchers should seek to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the abundance estimates for bloater and sculpin through expanding sampling efforts to include greater depths, hard substrates (i.e., offshore rocky reefs), and comparing day versus night density estimates. second, researchers need to identify preferred bloater-spawning habitat. for example, if bloater preferentially spawn on offshore reefs or seek abrupt changes in bathymetry, that would further prioritize the need to estimate densities of sculpin egg predators in those habitats. third, improved knowledge regarding bloater-spawning behaviour could reveal why male bloater die at a higher rate than females (see bunnell et al. 2012a) or why bloater eggs appear less vulnerable to predation by an individual sculpin than deepwater sculpin eggs (i.e., for a given individual sculpin, the maximum number of eggs found in any one stomach was only 14 for bloater eggs but 90 for deepwater sculpin eggs, mychek-londer et al. 2013). although many caveats to our estimates can be raised, previous research in freshwater ecosystems has reported similarly high proportions of population egg production being consumed. for example, jones et al. (1995) modelled the proportion of lake_trout eggs (and fry) consumed under different scenarios of predation and reported values ranging 0.47–1.00. empirical studies that have tracked the fate of incu- bating fish eggs have found that as many as 79–99% of eggs will succumb to some source of mortality before hatching (johnson 1961; rupp 1965; fitzsi- mons 1995; perkins & krueger 1995), and threats beyond predation can be prevalent. for example, ben- thic eggs can be subjected to disturbance by wind- driven currents that may cause them to be buried under shifting sediments (fitzsimons 1995; perkins & krueger 1995; fitzsimons et al. 2007), and cool water temperatures can extend incubation and possi- bly increase the risk of mortality (e.g., rice et al. 1987b). in the hypolimnetic waters of lake michigan where bloater eggs are incubating and temperatures are relatively stable yet cold, we suspect that preda- tion would be the primary source of egg mortality, although disturbance by currents remains a possibility (gottlieb et al. 1989). temperature likely has no direct effect on bloater egg survival given that rice et al. (1987b) reported normative survival at 2 °c. that our work contributes to the body of knowledge that seeks to determine the population-level impact of egg predation relative to other key drivers of fish recruitment. for example, a model included atlantic herring clupea harengus biomass (which are known to prey on eggs and larvae) and the abun- dance of copepod prey best explained variation in the recruitment of atlantic cod gadus morhua in the north sea over a 44-year time series (fauchald 2010). similarly, the population dynamics of atlantic herring in georges bank were explained by a model that included egg predation by haddock melanogram- mus aeglefinus and fishing mortality (richardson et al. 2011) and an approach similar to ours that cou- pled empirical diet information, daily ration, and pop- ulation modelling revealed substantial egg predation by two clupeid species on baltic cod eggs (k€oster & m€ollmann 2000). in freshwater ecosystems, predation on eggs, but not larvae, likely regulated recruitment of lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens in the peshtigo river (a tributary to lake michigan in wisconsin, united states, caroffino et al. 2010) and the abun- dance of invasive common carp cyprinus carpio in a series of interconnected lakes in the upper missis- sippi river basin (bajer et al. 2012). these popula- tion-level studies that have revealed the importance of egg predators are also bolstered by experimental work that has revealed that predation by fish or inver- tebrates to be the most important driver of the num- ber of eggs that ultimately are hatched (e.g., bouwes & luecke 1997; steinhart et al. 2004; etheridge et al. 2011; setzer et al. 2011). in our study, egg predation by sculpins could not singularly explain the recruitment variability exhib- ited by the 1973–2009 bloater year-classes. at the same time, our results provided an evidence that egg predation regulates bloater recruitment during some periods within the long time series and found that consumption could even exceed bloater egg produc- tion in 2009, when slimy sculpin were near record high levels of abundance (bunnell et al. 2013). hence, should recruitment by bloater continue to be weak in the 2010 and later year-classes and slimy sculpin densities remain at above-average levels (although they have declined since 2009, bunnell et al. 2013), we argue that egg consumption by native benthivores could be an important contributor to poor bloater future research will be required to explore what might have limited bloater recruitment during 1995–2005 when predation by sculpins was extremely low. of the factors listed in table 1, female predominance was in addition, recruitment. egg predation effects on bloater recruitment relatively unique over this period as females ranged 73–86% of the adult population. hence, future simu- lation models could explore how skewed sex ratios or some other factor intrinsic to the bloater popula- tion could cause bloaters to cycle in abundance (see madenjian et al. 2002). approaches the recently high levels of slimy sculpin biomass in lake michigan, coupled with our modelling results predicting their potential negative impact on bloater recruitment, demonstrate the importance of consider- ing a broader ecosystem perspective when consider- ing management to restore bloater populations. in particular, given previous knowledge demonstrating the top-down effects of piscivorous juvenile lake_trout on slimy sculpin (madenjian et al. 2005), one could hypothesise that if juvenile lake_trout had attained higher densities since 2005, then slimy sculpin densities would have been reduced to a level that would have increased bloater egg survival and recruitment. interestingly, managers in lake michigan recently developed a new strategy to reha- bilitate lake_trout populations (bronte et al. 2008), and our findings could provide additional justification for those efforts. beyond bloater population dynamics in lake michigan, the synchrony that was observed among bloater populations in lakes michigan, huron and superior between 1978 and 2006 (bunnell et al. 2010) appears to have weakened, based on recent bottom trawl surveys. age-0 bloater density mea- sured by the usgs lake huron bottom trawl survey was markedly higher between 2005 and 2009 relative to the 1990s (roseman et al. 2013), and comparable surveys in lakes michigan (bunnell et al. 2013) and superior (gorman et al. 2013) detected no similar increase. the recent strong recruitment in lake huron led to a record high estimate of adult bloater abundance in 2012 (since the survey began in 1976). why increased recruitment was detected in lake huron but not in the other two lakes is unknown. given our modelling results and the observation that mean biomass of slimy and deepwater sculpins in lake huron between 2005 and 2009 were only 0.1 and 13.4% respectively, of the mean biomass in lake michigan (s.r. riley, usgs, unpublished data), future research should explore whether the recovery of bloater in lake huron was a function of relatively low egg predation. beyond these three lakes, yearling bloaters were stocked in lake ontario in 2012 to re- establish an endemic prey fish, and further stocking is planned for future years. we believe that improved understanding of the primary bottleneck to bloater recruitment in lakes michigan, huron or superior should ultimately be of use to managers in lake ontario so that the probability of building naturalised and sustainable populations can be maximised. for 611 bunnell et al. example, if egg predation is, in fact, identified as one of the key bottlenecks, then managers would want to continue stocking bloaters as yearlings and to con- sider densities of sculpin egg predators when estimat- ing the spawning stock biomass required to produce measurable levels of wild bloater recruits. acknowledgements funding was provided by the great lakes fishery
