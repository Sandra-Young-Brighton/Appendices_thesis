however, little is known about the foraging habits of this species and its interactions with co-occurring predators. here, we quantify northern snakehead diet in comparison with the diets of naturalised largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides), and native american eel (anguilla rostrata) and yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens) collected from tidal freshwaters bordering virginia and maryland near fort belvoir, virginia. over 97% of northern snakehead gut contents were ﬁshes, with fundulid and centrarchid species consumed most frequently. dietary overlap was biologically signiﬁcant only between northern snakehead and largemouth bass. aquatic invertebrates were >10 times more common in native predator diets, reducing dietary overlap with northern snakehead. ontogenic shifts in adult northern snakehead diet were also detected, which may be explained by optimal foraging rather than true prey speciﬁcity. northern snakehead may be occupying a novel niche based on a piscivorous diet, therefore limiting competition with resident predators in the lower potomac river. further research into interactions between largemouth bass and northern snakehead is needed to inform management decisions and understand the ecological impacts of this non-native species. key words: northern snakehead; channa argus; non-native species; diet; lower potomac river introduction non-native ﬁshes are a major cause of declines in the diversity of native freshwater ﬁsh worldwide (lassuy 1995; courtenay 2007; ricciardi & macisaac 2011). impacts of non-native species on native biota include predation, competition, habitat alteration, hybridisa- tion and transmission of novel disease-causing patho- gens (see gozlan et al. 2010 and references therein). interestingly, chronicling the impacts of non-native species introductions has only recently (i.e., the last two decades) become commonplace in scientiﬁc literature (gozlan 2008; ricciardi & macisaac 2011). investigations into potential impacts are par- ticularly important because incidences of introductions continue to increase. for example, in the last decade, 73 new species of foreign freshwater ﬁshes were the usa (courtenay discovered within waters of correspondence: r. k. saylor, department of biology, university of west florida, 11000 university parkway, pensacola, fl 32514-5750, usa. e-mail: rks8@students.uwf.edu present address: nicolas w.r. lapointe, department of biology and institute of environmental science, carleton university, 1125 colonel by dr., ottawa, on, k1s 5b6, canada. paul l. angermeier, virginia cooperative fish and wildlife research unit. united states geological survey and virginia tech, blacksburg, va 24061-0321, usa. the virginia cooperative fish and wildlife research unit is jointly sponsored by the u.s. geological survey, virginia polytechnic institute and state university, virginia department of game and inland fisheries, and wildlife management institute. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00563.x 443 saylor et al. 2007). in certain ecosystems, the ratio of non-native to native species can be very high. the potomac river is particularly highly invaded, with up to 35% of ﬁsh species considered non-native (starnes 2002; starnes et al. 2011). knowledge of the basic ecology of introduced species, including dispersal ability, ﬁtness, fecundity, habitat use and diet, informs management decisions when a non-native species is identiﬁed in a naı¨ve ecosystem. successful management and mitiga- tion of non-native species is therefore contingent upon the timely investigation into, and dissemination of information on, their basic ecology. northern snakehead (channa argus) is one of the newest non-native species identiﬁed from freshwaters in north america, although it has been established for decades in parts of eastern europe. northern snake- head is native to freshwaters of korea, china and russia, where it typically inhabits shallow, vegetated, slow-moving waters (courtenay & williams 2004). air-breathing and parental guarding of young make it an effective invader outside its native range (courten- ay & williams 2004; usgs nas database et al. 2012). established populations of northern snakehead have been conﬁrmed in at four open-river systems within north america (usgs nas database 2012), with the ﬁrst reproducing population in the united states found in a pond near crofton, maryland, in 2002 (courtenay & williams 2004). northern snakehead was ﬁrst documented in the potomac river in 2004 (odenkirk & owens 2005) and continues to disperse so that it now occurs in 200 km of the mainstem potomac river (starnes et al. 2011). man- agement concerns for include potential impacts to recreational ﬁsheries and native ﬁshes (courtenay & williams 2004; usgs nas database 2012). this recent invader least northern snakehead can reach large sizes (i.e., 350– 450 mm total length) within 4 years, and >800 mm overall (courtenay & williams 2004; odenkirk & owens 2007), making it one of the largest predatory ﬁshes in the freshwater littoral zone of the potomac river. approximately 22 predatory ﬁshes inhabit the potomac river catchment (starnes et al. 2011); few are native, consistently large and abundant in habitats where northern snakehead is found (warren et al. 2000; lapointe et al. 2010; starnes et al. 2011). largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides), an eco- nomically valuable ﬁsh in the system, was introduced in the early 1800s (uhler & lugger 1876, as cited by starnes et al. 2011). tournament and recreational ﬁshing of largemouth bass is a multimillion dollar industry for the chesapeake bay watershed (j. love, maryland department of natural resources, personal communication). additional knowledge of interactions between northern snakehead and other predatory ﬁshes in the lower potomac river catchment would better 444 inform management actions to control established ﬁsheries and native ﬁshes. impacts on northern snakehead is carnivorous throughout its life, foraging on a wide variety of prey (courtenay & williams 2004). diet analysis of a native population in huanghua lake, china, showed that fry and juveniles primarily consumed invertebrates, whereas adults were predominantly piscivorous (wu et al. 2000). simi- larly, adults of an introduced population in russia primarily consumed ﬁshes, along with terrestrial invertebrates, crayﬁshes and frogs (dukravets & machulin 1978). odenkirk & owens (2007) found that frequently consumed by the potomac river population was banded killiﬁsh (fund- ulus diaphanous), white perch (morone americana), pumpkinseed (lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (lepomis macrochirus) and goldﬁsh (carassius auratus). pre- dators such as yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), american eel (anguilla rostrata) and largemouth bass were also occasionally found among gut contents. the prey most piscivores can directly (e.g., predation) or indirectly (e.g., competition) affect other ﬁsh populations (moyle & cech 2000; persson 2002). non-native piscivores commonly act as novel selective forces on native ﬁshes, which can decrease the distribution and abun- dance of native species (findlay et al. 2000; white & harvey 2001; latini & petrere 2004; mitchell & knouft 2009). for example, introduced nile perch (lates niloticus) greatly decreased cichlid species richness in lake victoria (kaufman 1992; stiassny & meyer 1999), and jang et al. (2006) found that sites with non-native largemouth bass had lower native ﬁsh abundance. additionally, the introduction of a non- native predator may force native predators to change trophic position (moyle & cech 2000; vander zanden et al. 1999; persson 2002; ricciardi & macisaac 2011). evidence of biotic interactions between non- native piscivores and co-occurring biota may be an early warning of detrimental impacts that warrant management actions. knowledge of the diet speciﬁcity of a non-native predator can help identify native species most likely to be affected by its introduction. for example, non- native largemouth bass in the san juan river, new mexico, consumed signiﬁcantly more native than non- native species, even though the latter comprised >80% of the potential forage biomass (pilger et al. 2008). by identifying such interactions early in the invasion process, research can be directed towards native species at greatest risk of exploitation by non-native predators. preferential foraging on recreationally important species or those in a documented state of decline is among the greatest concerns of managers monitoring the effects of an introduced predator. estimating diet speciﬁcity can also provide ecologists with direction for further research, especially if the preferred prey is also consumed by native predators and may be a limiting resource. dietary overlap is commonly considered an indica- tor of competition and has been widely used to describe the interactions between potential native and non-native competitors (lorenzoni et al. 2002; bach- eler et al. 2004; clarke et al. 2005). for example, diets of introduced largemouth bass in lake trasimeno, italy, overlapped signiﬁcantly with native northern pike (esox lucius) of all sizes (lorenzoni et al. 2002). dietary overlap analysis can provide insight into competition between species, but only under certain conditions, such as when prey items identiﬁed from both predators are a limiting resource (zaret & rand 1971; abrams 1980). at these indices provide estimates of diet similarity and identify which resources are used the most by both predators (krebs 1999). identiﬁcation of biologically signiﬁcant dietary overlap may prompt ecologists to include aspects of native predator growth rates, habitat usage or prey relative abundance into future research to better elucidate these interactions. the least, the objectives of this study were to (i) describe the diet of northern snakehead in the lower potomac river, (ii) estimate ontogenic shifts in diet preference among adult northern snakehead, (iii) estimate dietary overlap between northern snakehead and co-occurring predatory ﬁshes and (iv) draw inferences about the potential effects of northern snakehead on co-occur- ring predatory ﬁshes. in addition to northern snake- head, we collected diet data on largemouth bass, yellow perch, american eel and longnose gar (lep- isosteus osseus). our results clarify which species are most susceptible to predation by northern snakehead in the lower potomac river catchment. materials and methods study location fishes were collected from the lower potomac river catchment in virginia and maryland (fig. 1). we targeted shallow bays and creeks near fort belvoir, virginia, where northern snakehead was most abun- dant (odenkirk & owens 2007). the lower potomac river is tidal with water-level ﬂuctuations of 1 m and salinity <0.4 &. diet of non-native northern snakehead northern snakehead during 2007. because feeding rates were highest during the prespawn season (gascho landis et al. 2010), sampling dates focused on this period in 2008 to maximise the number of stomachs containing food. all predators were targeted via day- and night-time collections to increase the chances of capturing ﬁshes containing food, given that peak feeding times were unknown, and to maximise sample sizes. fishes were predominantly collected by boat electroﬁshing (coffelt and smith-root boat electroﬁshers, 6–12 a) in shal- low water, typically £2 m. backpack and tote-barge electroﬁshing were occasionally used in tributaries. all sizes of northern snakehead and largemouth bass were collected except young-of-year. yellow perch >150 mm (total length, tl) and large american eel (‡350 mm, tl) were collected to maximise the chance of observing dietary overlap. additionally, only long- nose gar ‡450 mm (tl) were captured. largemouth bass was the most abundant predator species in our study area; thus, we attempted to collect them in a one- to-one ratio with northern snakehead. northern snake- head, longnose gar, american eel and small yellow perch (<250 mm, tl) were immediately euthanised and placed on ice to stop digestion. all largemouth bass and large yellow perch were stored in a live well for gut content processing via pulsed gastric lavage (see below). diet content collection total length (mm) and weight (g) were recorded for every ﬁsh captured, so that mean ± standard deviation could be reported for each species. euthanised ﬁshes were dissected to remove the gut contents. gut contents from largemouth bass and large yellow perch were removed via pulsed gastric lavage (pgl; hartleb & moring 1995). pgl is generally >90% efﬁcient at removing gut contents from ﬁsh (light et al. 1983; hakala & johnson 2004); however, we examined ﬁshes that died and randomly selected and euthanised individual largemouth bass and yellow perch to conﬁrm pgl efﬁciency. all gut contents were ﬁxed with 10% formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol prior to identiﬁcation. all food items were identiﬁed to the lowest practical taxon, and blotted wet weight (g) of each food item was recorded. species collection diet analysis fishes were collected april–july 2007 and may–june 2008. northern snakehead, largemouth bass, yellow perch and american eel were collected during both sampling seasons, whereas longnose gar was collected only in 2008. longnose gar was collected in 2008 because we observed them in the same habitat as per cent composition of diet by weight, number, frequency of occurrence and mean per cent weight was calculated for each prey item, then by resource category. we delineated 13 resource categories to group similar prey types. resource categories included families (anguillidae, centrarchidae, for ﬁshes 445 saylor et al. fig. 1. map of the lower potomac river catchment where northern snakehead and co-occurring predators were collected. fishes were collected from embayments and creeks bordering virginia and maryland. clupeidae, cyprinidae, fundulidae, ictaluridae, mo- ronidae and percidae), crayﬁshes, other invertebrates (mostly aquatic insects), eggs and other vertebrates (frogs, turtles and mice). highly digested and uniden- tiﬁable ﬁshes were placed into a separate category (unid fish). stomachs that contained only vegetation or other odd items (e.g., ﬁshing lures) were eliminated from analysis. mean per cent weight of each resource category was used to examine the diet overlap of northern snakehead with other species according to schoener’s (1970) overlap index, given by. a ¼ 1   0:5 x n  !  pij   pik i¼1 where a is schoener’s overlap index for species j and k, n is the number of resource categories, pij is the proportion of resource category i used by species j, and pik is the proportion of resource category i used by species k. index values range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no dietary overlap and 1 indicating com- plete dietary overlap. dietary overlap is generally considered biologically signiﬁcant if a ‡ 0.6 (wallace 1981; bacheler et al. 2004). additional dietary overlap analyses were performed because biologically signiﬁcant dietary overlap was found between largemouth bass and northern snake- head. these analyses tested the sensitivity of results to changing resource classiﬁcations and alternative over- lap indices. resources were (i) simpliﬁed into general categories (i.e., ﬁshes, invertebrates, other vertebrates and miscellaneous items; n = 4) and (ii) categorised by lowest practical taxon (n = 52) and reanalysed. alternative indices included pianka’s (pianka 1973), 446 morisita’s (morisita 1959), simpliﬁed morisita (horn 1966), horn’s (horn 1966) and hurlbert’s (hurlbert 1978) measures of niche overlap (table 1). all alternative indices used the same 13 resource catego- ries (n), expressed proportion of each resource cate- gory and predator (pij & pik, respectively) as mean percentage weight, and were interpreted the same way as schoener’s overlap index described above. how- ever, morisita’s index was calculated by expressing the proportion of each resource category as percentage number but was interpreted using the same scale as schoener’s overlap index. hurlbert’s overlap index was used assuming resource abundances were the same, and values equal to 1 indicate resources are used proportional to their abundance, values close to 0 indicate no resources are shared, or values >1 indicate that some resources are used more intensively and diet preferences of both species for resources tend to coincide (hurlbert 1978; krebs 1999). we present only detailed results and discussion for schoener’s overlap index because it is optimal when resource availability is unknown, mean per cent weight is used for calculations, and it is not affected by how resources are categorised (wallace 1981; krebs 1999). alterna- tive indices were used to further support or refute biologically signiﬁcant dietary overlap detected using schoener’s overlap index. lastly, we examined ontogenic shifts in prey speciﬁcity based on the length of adult northern snakehead. data were prepared by removing diet items that were not identiﬁed to species or found in <5 northern snakehead, leaving 11 common prey species. all ﬁsh with empty stomachs or without any common prey species in their gut were excluded, leaving 134 table 1. results for

(536–641 mm) and large (642– 797 mm). indicator species analysis (isa) was used to determine whether prey species differed among sizes. the isa calculated an indicator value (iv) for each prey species from their relative frequencies of occur- rence in each size category, and tested for signiﬁcance. a perfect indicator species (iv = 100) would be found in every ﬁsh in a size category and in no ﬁsh in any other category (mccune & grace 2002). species were indicators for the size category in which they had the highest iv, and signiﬁcance (at a = 0.05) of ivs was determined by monte carlo permutation (4999 per- mutations). indicator species analysis was performed using pc-ord v5.2 software (mccune & mefford 1999). results we collected 403 northern snakehead (range: 203– 809 mm tl, x = 595 ± 128 mm and wet weight of 64–6072 g, x = 2366 ± 1287 g), 371 largemouth bass (x = 373 ± 74 mm tl, x = 857 ± 411 g), 148 yellow perch (x = 237 ± 36 mm tl, x = 175 ± 81 g), 21 (x = 556 ± 84 mm tl, x = 382 ± american eels 150 g) and 43 longnose gar (x = 774 ± 148 mm tl, x = 1604 ± 783 g). diet items were found in 49% of northern snakehead, 46% of largemouth bass, 68% of yellow perch, 57% of american eels and 9% of longnose gar. dissections of deceased and randomly selected largemouth bass (n = 21) and yellow perch (n = 6) showed that pgl was >96% efﬁcient at removing diet items from both species. northern snakehead predominantly consumed ﬁshes, which made up >97% of their diet (table 2). fifteen ﬁsh taxa were identiﬁed from northern snake- head stomachs (14 identiﬁed to species). the most common prey by weight was bluegill (20.3%), whereas banded killiﬁsh was consumed with the greatest frequency (25.4%) and abundance (33.7%). the heaviest diet item was a 216.2-g goldﬁsh collected from a 3624-g male snakehead, while the longest was a 288-mm american eel from a 656-mm female. additional gut contents included crayﬁsh, earthworms, a snail, nematodes, vegetation, a frog and a plastic lure. crayﬁshes were the most frequently consumed invertebrate (2.5%), but they accounted for only 0.3% by weight and 1% by the number of northern snakehead diet. largemouth bass, yellow perch and american eel all occurred in northern snakehead gut contents but represented small portions of overall diet. largemouth bass, yellow perch and american eel all consumed invertebrates 10–20 times more fre- quently than northern snakehead (table 3). although largemouth bass most often consumed ﬁshes (61.5% by weight, 66.9% by number and 77.8% by fre- quency), invertebrates (mainly crayﬁsh) were up to 60 times more important to largemouth bass (expressed as %w) than to northern snakehead. largemouth bass also ate a wider variety of vertebrates other than ﬁshes, including turtles, frogs, a snake and a mouse. fishes and invertebrates each made up 50% of yellow perch diet, expressed as weight. aquatic invertebrates other than crayﬁsh were consumed by yellow perch more frequently than by any other predator and were found in 50% of all individuals containing food. uniden- 447 saylor et al. table 2. diet composition of northern snakehead (n = 195, 203–809 mm, total

identiﬁed from northern snakehead gut contents that was not described by odenkirk & owens (2007). tiﬁed eggs were found in 12% of yellow perch containing food items but not in any other predator in this study. american eel predominantly consumed invertebrates (87.1% by weight and 84.4% by number) and few ﬁshes (13% by weight and 15% number). crayﬁshes were the single most common diet item for largemouth bass, yellow perch and american eel by weight respectively), number (21.2%, 19.9% and 46.2%, respectively) and frequency (33.5%, 33.7% and 75%, respectively). (31.7%, 36.8% and 76.7%, based on schoener’s index, biologically signiﬁcant diet overlap was detected only between northern snakehead and largemouth bass (a = 0.66). overlaps between northern snakehead and yellow perch (a = 0.36) or american eel (a = 0.37) were nonsig- 448 niﬁcant. longnose gar was excluded from dietary overlap analysis because most gar had empty stomachs. overlap values between largemouth bass and northern snakehead ranged from 0.53 with the exten- sive analysis (categorised by lowest taxon) to 0.73 in the general analysis. biologically signiﬁcant overlap between largemouth bass and northern snakehead was detected in all analyses based on alternate indices (table 1). hurlbert’s overlap index also indicated that resources were not used proportional to their abun- dance and diet preferences for resources of both predators were similar. indicator species analysis showed that small adult killiﬁsh northern large northern (iv = 29.1, p = 0.0028), whereas snakehead (iv = 24.5, p = 0.004). no prey species was a signiﬁcant indicator for medium northern snakehead. yellow perch preferred snakehead preferred banded discussion if diet overlap was biologically signiﬁcant between northern snakehead and largemouth bass. fishes (mainly fundulids) were prevalent in largemouth bass and northern snakehead diets. the main difference between the species was the greater importance of crayﬁsh in largemouth bass diet. both species prefer littoral habitats with abundant vegetation and structure (warren 2009; lapointe et al. 2010), thereby increas- ing chances of competition. in this case, dietary overlap seemed to highlight the use of abundant forage species by northern snakehead and largemouth bass. sharing abundant resources may limit competition according to diet; however, food availability becomes limited, comparable levels of diet similarity may lead to competition (zaret & rand 1971; abrams 1980). for example, bacheler et al. (2004) suggested that competition was occurring between native big- mouth sleepers and non-native largemouth bass because forage resources in the study reservoir were limited. this study also found that dietary overlap varied according to predator size which allowed them to further reﬁne their analysis and discussion of potential effects of dietary overlap between predators (bacheler et al. 2004). we cannot infer competition between northern snakehead and largemouth bass because we did not have estimates of prey relative abundance or data suggesting that prey was a limiting resource. furthermore, we pooled predator gut con- tents together because sample sizes were insufﬁcient to support the analyses of diet according to the predator size. all overlap indices are sensitive to samples size and underestimate dietary overlap if sample size is <100 or as the number of resource categories increases (smith & zaret 1982; krebs 1999). additional anal- yses were robust to various methods of measuring table 3. diet composition of largemouth bass (lmb, 140–1246 mm total length, tl), yellow perch (yp, 137–335 mm tl) and american eel (ae, 358–670 mm tl) expressed as percentage

collected during both sampling seasons. dietary overlap and supported our conclusion that overlap is biologically signiﬁcant between northern snakehead and largemouth bass. invertebrates the importance of no biologically signiﬁcant overlap was found between northern snakehead and yellow perch or american eel. low dietary overlap with yellow perch reﬂects (mainly aquatic insects) in perch diet. low overlap with american eel was in part an artefact of small sample size, which may not have adequately described eel diet. the overlap in diet that did occur between northern snakehead and these two native predators reﬂected their shared use of abundant fundulid and centrarchid ﬁshes. both yellow perch and american eel routinely use littoral habitat similar to that of northern snakehead (scott & scott 1988; jansen & mackay 1992; lapointe et al. 2010). lastly, the prevalence of empty stomachs suggests that longnose gar was not actively foraging when in the same littoral habitat in late spring (robison & buchanan 1988; etnier & starnes 1993; mcgrath 2010), and this species was not observed in the same habitat as northern snakehead during other seasons (n. lapointe, personal observation). overall, we found little evidence for potential direct competition between northern snakehead and native predators included in this study. 449 saylor et al. northern snakehead diet differed ontogenically and may be explained by optimal foraging of adults. northern snakehead is a suction feeder and swallow prey whole; therefore, gape limits the consumption of large, deep-bodied or spiny prey by small adults (nilsson et al. 1995; nilsson & bro¨nmark 2000). gape size generally increases with total length of a predator, so that large adult snakeheads have sufﬁcient gape to consume larger forage species such as yellow perch while avoiding smaller species (hughes 1997; ward-campbell & beamish 2005). conversely, small northern snakehead must forage on small, shallow- bodied, yet abundant prey (e.g., fundulids). adult northern snakehead may be targeting certain species over others; however, without estimates of prey relative abundance, it seems more likely that northern snakehead is foraging on prey encountered with the greatest frequency. northern snakehead in the lower potomac river catchment may be occupying a somewhat novel niche based on a nearly exclusive piscivorous diet, which may limit the degree of competition with co-occurring predators. largemouth bass and northern snakehead share similar diets and have the highest potential for competition if prey resources become limited. in contrast, the potential for competition between north- ern snakehead and native predators is low because of marked differences in diet or feeding activity of these native species. a wide variety of prey species were consumed by northern snakehead including the other predators in this study; however, these species were only a minor component of northern snakehead diet. further insight could be gained by studying the diets of all life-history stages of northern snakehead and co-occurring predators in this system. estimates of prey abundance would help reﬁne and interpret dietary overlap, and laboratory trials could be used to estimate snakehead dietary preferences. investigation into largemouth bass ecology (i.e., growth, reproduction, survival or recruitment) in relation to northern snake- head introductions would also help managers elucidate dietary overlap. such work would facilitate manage- ment decisions of this and other introduced popula- tions of northern snakehead in north america. this species because it ﬁts three of here, we have presented detailed information on the diet of non-native northern snakehead and its interac- tions with co-occurring predators in the lower potomac river. knowledge of these data is important and necessary for proper management and mitigation of the six to inﬂuence the severity of characteristics thought an aquatic invader (ricciardi & macisaac 2011). these (i) high fecundity (courtenay & williams 2004; odenkirk & owens 2007), (ii) generalised predatory diet (dukravets & machulin 1978; wu et al. 2000; courtenay & characteristics include 450 williams 2004; odenkirk & owens 2005, 2007; present study) and (iii) physiological tolerance to poor water quality and air-breathing ability (usgs nas database 2012). northern snakehead also has an extensive history of establishment and persistence in eastern europe and japan (courtenay & williams 2004). thus, detailed documentation of basic northern snakehead ecology is necessary to help develop better quantitative predictions of negative impacts on naı¨ve environments (ricciardi & macisaac 2011). current impacts of northern snakehead on largemouth bass populations in this system may be limited because the northern snakehead population size is small relative to the largemouth bass population. yet, northern snakehead abundance continues to increase, and the potential for competition may be high if prey is found to be a limiting resource. this study adds to the growing body of literature focused on understanding the basic ecology of northern snakehead. acknowledgements we thank john odenkirk (virginia department of game and inland fisheries, vdgif) for his expertise in northern snakehead
