landscape genetics; isolation by distance; fundulus; contact zone introduction genetic structure within populations can arise due to a myriad of factors, including organismal biology, habitat availability and suitability, and stochastic environmental processes. landscape features can cre- ate habitat barriers, which disrupt dispersal of indi- viduals between populations and generate genetic structure. landscape features affect dispersal capabili- ties in terrestrial taxa including insects (keyghobadi et al. 1999; kanuch et al. 2012), birds (piertney et al. 2008) and even humans (sokal & thomson 1998). in riverine systems, physical barriers such as waterfalls (gomez-uchida et al. 2009), artificial obstructions such as dams or weirs (horreo et al. 2011), and poor habitat patches (stelkens et al. 2012) can serve as barriers to gene flow in fish. even in the absence of physical barriers, there can be isolation by distance, where populations become less genetically similar with growing geographical distance. waterway dis- tance between populations is correlated with a decrease in contemporary migration in multiple spe- cies and in multiple drainages (in trout: carlsson et al. 1999; kanno et al. 2011; stelkens et al. 2012; in a variety of salmonids: gomez-uchida et al. 2009). migration distances can vary by a large degree correspondence: k. earnest, department of biology, washington university in st. louis, campus box 1137, one brookings drive, st. louis, mo 63130-4899, usa. e-mail: earnest.kate@gmail.com 572 doi: 10.1111/eff.12109 among populations of migratory fish such as trout, and these dispersal distances can be affected by envi- ronmental factors (heggenes et al. 2006; neville et al. 2006; northcote 2010; olsen et al. 2010). the fundulus notatus species complex provides opportunities to evaluate the influence of landscape on the genetic structure of populations. the species complex consists of three closely related killifish spe- cies that share similar ecological roles and overlap- ping ranges (blanchard 1996). the blackstripe topminnow (fundulus notatus) and the blackspotted topminnow (fundulus olivaceus) have large ranges stretching from the gulf coast streams from texas to western florida, northward to southern illinois and missouri for f. olivaceus, and southern wisconsin and michigan for f. notatus (thomerson 1966). the third member of this species complex, the broadstripe topminnow (fundulus euryzonus), is endemic to the lake ponchartrain drainage of louisiana and missis- sippi (suttkus & cashner 1981). in natural contact zones, hybridisation is usually rare (thomerson 1967; duvernell et al. 2007), but can vary substantially among drainages (schaefer et al. 2011; duvernell & schaefer 2013). lower bank slope, fundulus notatus and f. olivaceus are found in different habitats when examined on a whole-stream landscape level. fundulus notatus are typically found in downstream habitats with relatively low stream flow, mud or clay substrate and with aquatic vegeta- tion. fundulus olivaceus are generally more abundant in typical headwater habitats with shallower and nar- rower channels, larger substrate size, less emergent vegetation, more woody debris and increased canopy cover (braasch & smith 1965; blanchard 1996; smiley et al. 2005; schaefer et al. 2009; duvernell & schaefer 2013). previous investi- gations suggest that relative abundance of these spe- cies within contact zones is affected by ecological variation including local microhabitat factors such as substrate and amount of aquatic vegetation (braasch & smith 1965; schaefer et al. 2011). larger-scale landscape variables including position within the stream continuum may also affect relative abundance (schaefer et al. 2009) and fish community structure (hitt & angermeier 2008), especially when taking strength of ecological gradients along the river con- tinuum and contact zone structure into account (schaefer et al. 2011). braasch and smith (1965) suggested that the differences in habitat preference are due to relatively stable habitat factors such as stream velocity, substrate and aquatic vegetation rather than factors that change regularly such as tur- bidity and dissolved oxygen. given that f. notatus and f. olivaceus exist in sympatry, we wanted to determine whether interspe- cific differences association in habitat use or landscape genetics of syntopic topminnows translated into different drainage-wide genetic struc- ture patterns. to do this, we sampled from represen- tative tributaries in each of the three forks and the main stem of the saline river, a tributary of the ohio river in southeastern illinois, usa. this allowed us to assess drainage-wide genetic structure in each spe- cies and examine relationships between genetic and geographical distance, species distributions and habi- tat associations. stream systems are dendritic; there- fore, upstream locations are more isolated (i.e., headwater segments are separated by larger river hab- itats) from one another than downstream locations. because of this inherent difference between the habi- tats preferred by each species, we hypothesised that differences in species distributions would translate into a greater level of genetic structure in the headwa- ter species, f. olivaceus, than the larger river species, f. notatus. to examine how species distributions related to the landscape of the saline river watershed, we examined habitat parameters at points of fish cap- ture. we hypothesised that species relative abundance would be associated with habitat factors that corre- lated with stream size and relative position in the network (cumulative drainage area). methods site selection and sample collection the saline river drainage in south-eastern illinois, usa, marks the northern limit of f. olivaceus in the eastern portion of its range in the ohio river basin. the saline river lies along the border between the shawnee hills upland region and the mount vernon hill country prairie region (leighton et al. 1948). fundulus olivaceus is abundant in the small upland drainages of the shawnee hill country (braasch & smith 1965; duvernell et al. 2007), whereas f. nota- tus is abundant in prairie streams further to the north (braasch & smith 1965). fish were collected from 21 sites covering the three major tributary forks as well as along the main stem of the saline river in the summers of 2010– 2012. at each site, fish were sampled using dip net or seine. a caudal fin clip was taken from each fish for further dna analysis, and fish were either pre- served in formalin for morphological analysis in a separate study (duvernell & schaefer 2013) or returned to the stream at the point of capture. habitat assessment location of each sampling site was recorded using global positioning system (gps) coordinates. habitat parameters were measured at six points (three on the left bank and three on the right bank) surrounding a 573 earnest et al. location within a site where fish were captured. the habitat parameters measured were water depth (in cm), stream width (cm), flow rate (m/s), substrate size (modified wentworth scale after cummins 1962), presence or absence of aquatic vegetation and in-stream cover, bank stability and slope, and canopy cover. cumulative drainage area was extracted from the national hydrology plus database (http://www. horizon-systems.com/nhdplus) as a descriptor of stream size and local hydrology. habitat variables were averaged for each site and summarised with a principal component analysis (pca) of the correlation matrix. cumulative drainage area and the first three principal components were tested for multicollinearity using pearson’s r. parame- ters that showed correlations greater than 0.2 were entered into a stepwise regression to determine rela- tive importance in predicting proportion of species. all statistical evaluations of habitat parameters were performed using systat, version 10 (systat soft- ware, chicago, il, usa). genetic structure individuals were genotyped using seven microsatellite loci – fno112, fhatg-20, fhatg-6, fhatg-b103, fno091, fhatg-b101 and fno056 – following the studies by duvernell et al. (2008) and feldheim, k.a., kreiser, b.r., schmidt, b., duvernell, d.d. & schaefer, j.f. (in review) (table 1). polymerase chain reactions (10 ll volume) for microsatellite analysis contained approximately 50 ng dna, 200 mm of table 1. forward (f) and reverse (r) primers used to amplify microsatellite sequences in this study. locus names with fno were developed using fundulus notatus genomic sequences (feldheim, k.a., kreiser, b.r., schmidt, b., duvernell, d.d. & schaefer, j.f. in review). fh loci were developed using f. heteroclitus genomic sequences (duvernell et al. 2008). one primer was developed in f. heteroclitus, and then a modified reverse primer was optimised using f. notatus sequence. locus sequence (5′–3′) genbank accession number gaccaaccgtttgtcaatgcaac aacccacatgttcaagactgc tcaatagataaggtcatttgttttcaa aaagcttatttatccttccactgc tgggtgtgagtgcatatggt

systems inc., foster city, ca, usa). electrophero- grams were analysed using genemapper, version 4.0 (applied biosystems inc.). raw microsatellite genotypes were converted to structure format using convert, version 1.31 (glaubitz 2004). individuals were assigned to species using structure, version 2.3 (pritchard et al. k = 2, 2000). modelling parameters used were 1,00,000 mcmc repetitions and a burn in period of 10,000. individuals were assigned as pure species (no hybrid ancestry) if they exhibited an admixture pro- portion greater than 0.95 to either f. olivaceus or f. notatus. individuals with admixture values less than 0.95 were treated as putative hybrids and not used in subsequent analyses. determination of genetic structure within species was performed using structure, version 2.3. modelling parameters used were k = 1 through k = 20 with 1,00,000 mcmc repetitions and a burnin of 10,000. this analysis was repeated 10 times per k value. the evanno method was used to determine the most likely k for each species and was carried out using structure harvester, version a.1 (evanno et al. 2005; earl & vonholdt 2012). analysis of molecular variance (amova) was performed for each species using arlequin, version 3.5 (excoffier & lischer 2010). genetic and geographical distance correlations determination of fst values for each pair of popula- tions within species and tests for hardy–weinberg equilibrium were performed using genepop, ver- sion 4.0 (raymond & rousset 1995; rousset 2008). geographical distance between each population-pair was determined by plotting gps coordinates for each collection site and measuring river distance (km) in google earth (google, mountain view, ca). mantel tests were performed on genetic and geo- graphical distances using the isolation by distance web service, version 3.23 (jensen et al. 2005), with 10,000 randomisations. pairwise habitat distances were compared by computing euclidean distance between site pc scores. these scores were used in partial mantel tests with genetic and geographical distance to control for the effects of habitat differ- ences using zt, version 1.1 (bonnet & van de peer 2002). comparisons of genetic and geographical distance at the level of the individual were made using the spatial autocorrelation function in genalex, version 6.5 (peakall & smouse 2012). this test used the squared distances measure to estimate genetic dis- tances between pairs of individuals and then com- pared those genetic distances to the same waterway distances used for mantel tests. individuals collected from the same site were assigned a waterway distance of zero. to assess nonrandom genetic structure at the individual level, a correlogram of the autocorrelation coefficient indicating relatedness of individuals (r) was plotted as a function of distance class using 15 km increments. results we collected fundulus sp. individuals and measured habitat variables at seventeen sites throughout the saline river drainage. sample sizes for each species at each site ranged from 6 to 93 with a median sam- ple size of 25 (table 2), and a total of 228 f. nota- tus, 258 f. olivaceus and 37 individuals of putative hybrid ancestry were identified. fundulus olivaceus individuals were most abun- dant in upstream reaches of each tributary fork with f. notatus individuals more common in the larger river habitats. however, both species were present at many sampled locations, and f. olivaceus individuals were absent in only two sites throughout the drainage (fig. 1). f. notatus individuals were absent from five sampled sites, all occurring in the smallest headwater sites with the lowest cumulative drainage area. puta- landscape genetics of syntopic topminnows fig. 1. map of saline river watershed

where both species were sampled. genetic structure only one locus in one population showed a signifi- cant deviation from hardy–weinberg equilibrium fol- lowing a sequential bonferroni correction (rice 1989). pairwise site fst values for both f. notatus and f. olivaceus are shown in tables 3 and 4, respec- tively. a significant pattern of isolation by distance was found among f. olivaceus population samples (r = 0.48, p = 0.005), but not among f. notatus sam- ples (r = 0.12, p = 0.31) (fig. 2). this correlation table 2. sample site identification numbers, drainage fork designation,

due to differences between forks (p = 0.005), 1.5% was due to differences between samples within forks (p < 0.001), and 96.4% was due to differences between individuals within sample sites (p < 0.001). amova for f. notatus showed 1.3% of variation due to differences between forks (p = 0.03), 2.7% was due to differences between samples within forks (p < 0.001), and 96% was due to differences between individuals within sample sites (p < 0.001). overall, fst values were small but significant in both species (fst = 0.036, p < 0.001 for f. olivaceus, and fst = 0.040, p < 0.001 for f. notatus). analysis of data by the structure clustering algorithm suggested only one distinct genetic cluster within each species. spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a shift towards less relatedness among indi- viduals than expected at random as distance increased between sites within both f. notatus and f. olivaceus populations (fig. 3). fundulus notatus individuals demonstrated significant positive relatedness in the 0–15 km distance class only, while f. olivaceus showed positive relatedness in both the 0–15 and 15–30 km classes. beyond 30 km, both species showed significant negative relatedness values. 576 habitat variables the 23 sites used for microhabitat collection included the 17 sites sampled in this study, plus six additional sites for which genetic data were reported in the study by duvernell and schaefer (2013). of these, 12 sites were dominated by f. olivaceus and 11 sites were dominated by f. notatus. the first three axes of the pca explained 73% of between-site variation in microhabitat variables. as this investigation exam- ined only two species, relative abundance of f. nota- tus was used for a measure of species composition. cumulative drainage area showed a strong negative relationship with the first pc axis (r =  0.57) and a moderate positive relationship with the second pc axis (r = 0.37). cumulative drainage area and inter- actions between cumulative drainage area and the first two pc axes were associated with the proportion of f. notatus (table 5). the first pc axis was associ- ated with relative abundance of f. notatus (r2 = 0.482, p < 0.001) (fig. 4a). the second and third pc axes did not significantly associate with relative abundance of species (r2 = 0.007, p = 0.49 for pc2, r2 = 0.05, p = 0.07 for pc3). cumulative drainage area was associated with relative abundance of f. notatus (r2 = 0.221, p = 0.021) (fig. 4b). the first pc axis described relative stream position (high (a) (b) fig. 2.

shiners: franssen 2012). at a regional scale, populations of the congener f. sciadicus showed high levels of fst, suggesting high levels of 578 genetic structure among drainages (li et al. 2009). within the watershed, lack of isolation by distance pattern in f. notatus could be due to high levels of gene flow (hutchison & templeton 1999), although gene flow was not directly evaluated in this study. a subset of pairwise estimates among f. notatus popu- lation samples appeared as outliers with unusually high fst values (fig. 2b). each of these outliers included site 15, our only f. notatus sample from the north fork of the saline river (fig. 1). an explana- tion for this apparent outlier f. notatus population sample will require additional sampling in the north fork drainage. the f. olivaceus samples from the north fork (sites 12 and 13, fig. 1) did not exhibit the same outlier pattern. bayesian analysis of population structure using structure (pritchard et al. 2000) indicated no genetic structure in either species. the structure model has been shown to perform poorly at levels of fst lower than 0.05 (latch et al. 2006), which may explain why results from bayesian analysis do not agree with data from mantel tests or spatial autocor- relation. the pattern of species distribution met expectations that f. olivaceus would dominate upstream sites with a transition to f. notatus in larger downstream habi- tats. in most drainages throughout the range of the two species, contact zones are typically disjunct and associated with tributary/river confluences (duvernell & schaefer 2013). in this study, f. olivaceus was found in nearly all sites throughout the drainage including the largest part of the saline river immedi- ately upstream of its confluence with the ohio river. likewise, f. notatus was found in a majority of sites, including all but the uppermost reaches of tributary streams where water flow was often intermittent. this distribution pattern agrees with previously published studies in the saline river system and demonstrates that the contact zone between these two species is diffuse in all tributary forks in this drainage (braasch & smith 1965; thomerson 1966). species distributions correlated with microhabitat parameters where f. olivaceus-dominated sites had shallow bank slopes, more in-stream cover and more canopy cover; and f. notatus-dominated sites had steep bank slopes, less in-stream cover and less can- opy cover. cumulative drainage area also correlated with species distribution and microhabitat factors. our study agreed with results from schaefer et al. (2011), which demonstrated that changes in cumula- tive drainage area between tributary and river levels are the best predictor of proportion of fundulus spe- cies in contact zones. cumulative drainage area dif- ferences upstream versus downstream of a confluence can act as a metric of amount of habitat change. hab- itat parameters may be instructive in determination of in a between populations. the breadth of species distribution overlap in this drainage in all habitats could facilitate gene flow. in addition, fundulus have the potential to exhibit large exploratory movements, which may result in homog- enisation previous mark–recapture study, f. notatus and f. olivaceus individuals were shown to move hundreds of metres in a matter of a few days (alldredge et al. 2011). similar exploratory movements have been observed in both f. notatus and f. olivaceus in syntopy within the saline river watershed (duvernell, d.d., unpub- lished data). therefore, high levels of gene flow could be the reason that we fail to detect genetic structure among these populations. suitable patches within regions of contact zones where both species occur in similar proportions. dif- ferences in habitat preference may also drive patterns of genetic structure in these species. we saw evidence for very limited genetic structure in fundulus populations within the saline river watershed. we attribute interspecific differences in isolation by distance patterns to the distributions of the species within the dendritic stream system. within this drainage, we also saw changes in patch characteristics that correlate with changes in relative abundance as we move from upstream to down- stream. it is possible that patch quality drives the spe- cies distributions within this system and thus also drives the isolation by distance pattern of f. olivac- eus. species distributions and population genetic structure arise through interaction of multiple abiotic and biotic factors. greater understanding of how these patterns arise can be gained by evaluation of the potential underlying drivers of diversification including movement patterns and patch preferences.
