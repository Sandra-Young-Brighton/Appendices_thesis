institute for environmental research, heidelberg, vic., australia, 2po box 86, queenscliff 3225, vic., australia abstract – the fast-start swimming performance of juveniles of an australian freshwater (warm-water) ﬁsh, golden perch, was examined in the laboratory at six water temperatures ranging between 10 and 25 °c. fast-start swimming performance of ﬁsh was considerably reduced at temperatures less than 15.5 °c. temperatures of less than 15 °c are typical of the thermal regime downstream of large dams in south-eastern australia, where conditions are more suited to introduced cold-water ﬁsh species. we conclude that the swimming performance of native warm-water ﬁsh such as golden perch is likely to be negatively affected by cold-water releases from deep outlets in thermally stratiﬁed dams. key words: fast start; temperature; dams; hypolimnial releases; macquaria ambigua jarod lyon, department of sustainability and environment, freshwater ecology section, arthur rylah institute for environmental research, 123 brown st, heidelberg 3084, vic., australia; e-mail: jarod.lyon@dse.vic.gov.au accepted for publication march 21, 2007 introduction the effect of large dams on the downstream ecology and chemistry of rivers in australia has been well documented (walker et al. 1978; walker 1980; astles 2001). one of the main detrimental effects of dams on native warm-water ﬁsh populations is caused by the hypolimnial release of cold water from dams, leading temperatures below 15 °c during peak to river agricultural irrigation season (august–may) which coincides with the warm spring and summer period in australia (gehrke et al. 1995; astles 2001). figure 1 shows a comparison of river temperatures above and below a large freshwater in south- eastern australia (lake hume) during the irrigation period 2000/2001. at a time when streams would naturally be warming, water temperatures downstream of dams can remain low, often below 15 °c (fig. 1), as a direct consequence of cold-water releases. impoundment effects of reduced water temperature on native ﬁshes in australia include reduced growth rates, increased competition from introduced cold-water species such as salmonids, and lowered spawning success (gehrke et al. 1995; astles 2001). a poten- tially important factor that has, for the main, been overlooked in australia is the effects of cold-water releases on ﬁsh swimming performance. the swimming activity of ﬁsh can be categorised into three basic modes: sustained (>200 min), pro- longed (15 s to 200 min) and burst (<15 s) (blake 1983; domenici & blake 1997). sustained swimming generally includes activities such as foraging and schooling, while prolonged swimming is regarded as periods of cruising interspersed with stints of more energetic swimming (blake 1983). while these modes make up the vast majority of swimming time, the burst mode is important for high-speed movements of short durations (weihs 1974; blake 1983; domenici & blake 1997). one component of burst swimming is the fast start, which generally lasts for less than 1 s, and is of great importance in predator avoidance and prey capture (taylor & mcphail 1985; domenici & blake 1993, 1997). in general, the total distance covered, and the maximum velocities attained during fast starts is positively correlated with ﬁsh length (fry & cox 1970; howland 1974; taylor & mcphail 1985). 184 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00244.x ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 aug sep oct nov dec jan feb mar apr may fig. 1. average daily

recognised, with recording dome-shaped relationships between physiological performance variables (such as swimming speed) and temperature (huey & stevenson 1979; angilletta et al. 2002). at temperatures below a physiological opti- mum fast-start swimming performance of ﬁsh is likely to be reduced (temple & johnston 1997). further- more, rapid ﬂuctuations in the water temperature may exacerbate this effect: rapid reductions in the water temperature lead to a more severe depression of fast- start performance (hochachka & somero 1973; tanck et al. 2000). the aim of the study was to examine the effect of water temperature on the fast-start performance of a common native australian freshwater ﬁsh, golden perch (macquaria ambigua richardson 1845). golden perch populations have suffered dramatic reductions in their distributions, attributed partly to releases of cold water (cadwallader 1978; koehn & o’connor 1990). the species is the most commonly stocked freshwater species in south-eastern australia. materials and methods juvenile m. ambigua were sourced from commercial hatcheries and transported to the laboratory (arthur rylah institute, melbourne, australia) in large plastic containers. fish were held in groups of six in 50-l glass aquaria and maintained on a ﬂow-through system )1. fish were fed at a ﬂow rate of approximately 3 læh to satiation each day with a commercially prepared food and tanks were cleaned daily to remove excess food and waste. acclimation temperatures were achieved by changing the tank water temperature at )1 from the original hatchery a rate of 1 °cæday temperature. temperature was controlled (±0.1 °c) using commercially available water mixing units. fish effects of temperature on fast starts were not fed for 24 h before the commencement of an experiment. at the time of testing the ﬁsh were four months old. six m. ambigua were acclimatised to each of the following temperatures: 24.5, 21.5, 18.5, 15.5, 12.5 and 10.0 °c and were held at these temperatures for a period of 3 weeks. at the time of testing, all ﬁsh were similar in size, with an average fork length of 47 ± 3.9 mm (mean ± sd). fish were randomly assigned to the temperature treatments, and mean ﬁsh lengths did not differ signiﬁcantly between tempera- ture treatments (anova, f5,30 ¼ 0.419, p ¼ 0.832). fast-start performance for each ﬁsh was assessed at the temperature to which it had been acclimatised. in a out glass carried fast starts were measured by ﬁlming the response of each ﬁsh to brief electrical shocks (<0.1 s, 1.4 v) with up to two separate tests per ﬁsh (30 min recovery period between tests). electric shocks were used to elicit fast starts as it was possible to reliably duplicate this stimulus between tests, leading to consistent responses by the ﬁsh. each fast-start behavioural response was tank (900 mm · 300 mm · 300 mm), over which a mirror was positioned at an angle of 45 ° to allow ﬁlming using a sony ccd-tr3400e video camera (sony corporation, new york, u.s.a.), recording at 25 frames per second. frame rates of between 25 and 30 frames per second have been found to be adequate in several recent studies of ﬁsh swimming performance (garenc et al. 1999; rajotte & coutre 2002; arendt 2003; bailey et al. 2003; ojanguren & brana 2003). each fast start was analysed by tracing the midline the ﬁsh (after 10· magniﬁcation with a data of projector) frame by frame until it was evident that the maximum velocity had been achieved (i.e., the total distance moved per frame was decreasing after a peak). the approximate centre of mass for a stretched- straight ﬁsh (comssf) was then marked on each image (37% of the length of the ﬁsh, measured from the snout [j.p. lyon, unpublished data]). the coms- sf is preferable to other possible anatomical reference points such as the snout tip, as it exhibits less lateral movement during swimming than other anatomical points (webb 1976; arnott et al. 1998). distances between comssf in successive frames were meas- ured and recorded. the maximum swimming velocity attained by each ﬁsh was determined by measuring the maximum distance that each ﬁsh travelled in a set period of time (i.e., 1/25th of a second) during each fast-start trial. each ﬁsh was tested a maximum of two times. a set of candidate statistical models were ﬁtted to the data using markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods within the bayesian statistical modelling package openbugs, version 2.2.0 (thomas et al. 2006). the models represented various plausible 185 lyon et al. relationships between fast-start velocity and acclima- tion temperature. the set of models included formu- lations where the mean fast-start velocity was constant and unaffected by temperature, was a linear function of temperature, a quadratic function of temperature, a step function of temperature or where a different mean fast-start velocity occurred at each acclimation tem- perature. in addition, the possibility that fast-start velocity was linearly inﬂuenced by ﬁsh length was also considered, by including models in the candidate model set which had ﬁsh length as a covariate. the nonindependence of repeated measurements of fast- start velocity made on individual ﬁsh (most ﬁsh were tested twice) was accounted for in the models through inclusion of a random effect term in all statistical models (peek et al. 2002). the relative parsimony of the alternative models was assessed by calculating the normalised deviance information criterion (ddic) for each model (spie- gelhalter et al. 2002). in general, models with smaller ddic values are considered more parsimonious. model selection weights (denoted w), which sum to one, and represent the relative support for each of the models in the set of candidate models were also calculated from the ddic values following the formulae in burnham & anderson (2002). values of ddic and w for each of the candidate models are given in table 1. rather than basing statistical inferences regarding expected fast-start velocities at different temperatures on a single ‘best’ model, expected velocities at each test temperature were inferred using model averaging. table 1. descriptions of the 18 candidate models ﬁtted to the data, and the relative support for these models, expressed as normalised deviance information criteria (ddic), and model

that the inherent uncertainty in the choice of models for the data is explicitly accounted for in the inferential process (burnham & anderson 2002). the expected velocities at each acclimation temperature were calculated by weighting the expected velocities under each candidate model by the model selection weights, w (burnham & anderson 2002). hence, each model contributed to the inferences in proportion to its degree of support in the data. results comparison among the set of candidate statistical models revealed that the best supported model for the relationship between fast-start velocity and tempera- ture was described by a step function with a switch point between 12.5 and 15.5 °c, and no inﬂuence of ﬁsh length on fast-start velocity (table 1). on the basis of model selection weights, w, this model was more than twice as well supported as the next best model, which was also a step-function model with a switch point between 12.5 and 15.5 °c, but including the effect of ﬁsh length. all of the other candidate models were poorly supported by the data, with model selection weights less than 0.1 (table 1). model-averaged estimates of the expected mean fast-start velocity of individuals of m. ambigua are given in fig. 2. it is apparent that the fast-start velocity at temperatures greater than 12.5 °c is greater than that at temperatures less than or equal to 12.5 °c. expected mean fast-start velocities for temperatures above and below the switch point are approximately constant (fig. 2). the expected mean fast-start velo- city at temperatures less than or equal to 12.5 °c was )1, while at temperatures above approximately 80 cmæs 15.5 °c expected mean fast-start velocity was nearly 100 cmæs )1. discussion our results show that reduction in water temperatures commensurate with those likely to be caused by releases from dams can signiﬁcantly hypoliminial impact the fast-start swimming performance of juvenile m. ambigua. under laboratory conditions, juvenile m. ambigua recorded markedly reduced mean fast-start velocities at temperatures less than or equal to 12.5 °c, than at temperatures greater than 15.5 °c. water discharge from deep outlets in thermally stratiﬁed dams in the murray darling basin can lower downstream water temperatures by more than 8 °c in comparison to natural ambient water temperatures and can also reduce seasonal variation in water tempera- tures (astles 2001). macquaria ambigua naturally occupy warm, turbid, slow-ﬂowing lowland rivers 1 − s m c , y t i c o e v l 140 120 100 80 60 10 15 20

(harris & rowland 1996). construction of large impoundments within the natural range of golden perch has drastically altered signiﬁcant stretches of their former habitat (gehrke et al. 1995). in such regulated reaches of river, where frequent cold-water releases occur, predator avoidance and prey capture capabilities of golden perch could be reduced, due to reduced fast-start velocities of the ﬁsh (webb & skadsen 1980; weihs & webb 1984; harper & blake 1988). fast-start the introduced rainbow trout (onchorhynchus mykiss) experiences optimal swimming performance between 15 and 10 °c (webb 1978), while the results presented in this paper indicate that the fast-start capabilities of m. ambigua are signiﬁ- cantly reduced below 15 °c. previous studies have shown that an increased fast-start performace increases the probability of successfully evading a stike by a predator (walker et al. 2005). similarly, increased fast-start performance may allow more efﬁcient prey capture by predatory ﬁsh. due to their superior fast- start velocities at low temperatures, trout may be better able to avoid predation and have improved ability to capture prey items compared with native species such as golden perch. thus, under reduced temperture conditions introduced trout may be at a competitive advantage over native species such as golden perch. decreased water temperatures reduce the ability of m. ambigua juveniles to perform fast starts, which could reduce prey capture and predator avoidance efﬁciency in this species. cold water released from effects of temperature on fast starts dams can also affect breeding, growth and egg development in australian native ﬁshes (ryan et al. 2003), and as such efforts to increase water release temperatures so that they better match the physiolo- gical requirements of native warm-water ﬁsh should be given a high priority in river rehabilitation. such changes may increase opportunities for native warm- water species to recolonise river reaches below large dams. acknowledgements this work was undertaken as part of an agriculture, forestry and fisheries australia (affa) grant with funding provided under the natural heritage trust md2001 fishrehab
