(1994). exist as without information on dispersal among habi- tat patches in ﬁshes, predicting population persist- ence by using current models, including metapop- ulation models, is problematic. data that deter- mine whether ﬁshes subpopulations (restricted to habitat patches) connected by limited dispersal or as populations with relatively unre- stricted dispersal among habitat patches (one con- tinuous population) are needed before the popula- tion dynamics and effects of habitat patch iso- lation of these animals can be understood. if patch-restricted ﬁsh are acting as subpopulations, loss of habitat patches could lead to isolation and extirpation of subpopulations over time. if, how- ever, ﬁsh move freely throughout the river, loss of habitat patches might only affect population size if habitat itself was a limiting factor. if ﬁsh within habitat patches are acting as subpopulations, it would be predicted that movement should be in- frequent (the majority of ﬁsh will be recaptured where they were released) and primarily limited to adjacent patches. if ﬁsh move freely throughout the river, from habitat patch to patch, movement should be more common (ﬁsh would be found in any given patch; not necessarily where they were released) and not necessarily restricted to adjacent patches. i investigated whether the study species, the blue shiner (cyprinella caerulea), exists as sub- populations connected by limited dispersal or as one continuous population in a medium-sized ap- palachian river (a small spatial scale). speciﬁcally, i determined whether ﬁsh moved among suitable habitat patches. the study encompassed late spring, summer and early fall, a time period that includes the breeding season and periods of both high and low water discharge. the extent and fre- quency of movement determined whether blue shiners exist as subpopulations or as one continu- ous population. i also determined whether rifﬂe or blue shiner movement glide mesohabitats were barriers to dispersal, how far the ﬁsh were capable of moving, and whether there was directional bias in ﬁsh movement. methods study species the blue shiner (cyprinella caerulea) is a riverine minnow that reaches lengths of up to 90 mm in standard length (johnston, unpublished) and lives up to 2 years (krotzer 1984). the species is typic- ally found in the middle of the water column and feeds both on the surface and midwater. like other members of the genus, the species is sexually di- morphic, with males attaining a larger size, devel- oping breeding tubercles and characteristic blue breeding coloration on the body and yellow ﬁns. blue shiners are crevice-spawners that spawn eggs into crevices in logs or rocks and then abandon them (johnston & page 1992). spawning occurs from late spring to mid-summer (johnston & shu- te 1997). the typical habitat of the species is rela- tively shallow water (20–67 cm deep) with silt/sand substrate and low water velocity (0.0–0.08 m/s). blue shiners are rarely seen outside these habitat patches (johnston & damon 1996; johnston & shute 1997). the historic range of the blue shiner included me- dium to large streams in the cahaba and coosa river systems (mobile bay drainage) in georgia, alabama and tennessee. the species is thought to be extirpated from the cahaba river system (ram- sey 1984), and in the coosa river system, the cur- rent range of the blue shiner is thought to be re- stricted to six populations (u.s. fish and wildlife service 1995). as a result of this range reduction, the blue shiner is one of the rarest members of the relatively large minnow genus cyprinella (27 spe- cies). the ﬁsh was designated as a threatened species in 1992 (u.s. fish and wildlife service 1992). study area the conasauga river (coosa river system), geor- gia and tennessee, is an unimpounded river that retains good water quality in the headwaters. tur- bidity in the headwaters is consistently low enough to allow surveys for aquatic organisms by snor- keling. due to the high quality of habitat in these areas, the river is the last refuge of at least nine aquatic species that have been extirpated in other parts of their range. the study was conducted 0.8 km upstream of the conﬂuence of the jack’s river with the con- asauga river, murrary co., ga. the segment of the river used for the study was approximately 1.1 km long (fig. 1). the river at this point averages 171 johnston fig. 1. location and relative sizes of habitat patches used for study. intervening habitat included rifﬂes and glides. the num- bers indicate the numbers of blue shiners that moved among indicated patches. 11 m in width and is of moderate gradient. the habitat consists of series of pools, glides and rifﬂes, and the substrate ranges from cobble, gravel and boulders in rifﬂes to gravel, sand and mud in pools and glides. procedures since blue shiners are an imperiled species, every effort was made to reduce the impact of this study 172 on the population. fish were collected for marking only once. although this reduced the sample size of marked ﬁsh, enough animals were marked to assess the questions of the study. also, marking all of the animals at one time allowed any effects of time on movement to be investigated. low recapture rates are typical for most studies of ﬁshes due to the inherent difﬁculty in collecting ﬁshes (gowan et al. 1994) (e.g., 26%, hill & grossman 1987; 8% and 20% freeman 1995), and this effect was compounded by sampling and marking ﬁsh only once in this study. also, to main- tain the connectivity of patches in the study, small habitat patches with very few individuals were in- cluded. the probability of recapture of these indi- viduals was remote. to address the criticisms as- sociated with low recapture rate of ﬁsh and methods used for movement studies (e.g., failure to detect long-range movements), efforts were made in 1998 to account for the proportion of ﬁsh not recaptured. population estimates were made for ﬁve patches chosen for continued study in 1998: (total . ﬁsh marked) (. caught in subsequent sample)/(total . recaptures). sampling efﬁciency was determined as the number of ﬁsh observed/ estimated population size. expected recaptures was estimated as (sampling efﬁciency) (. ﬁsh marked). blue shiner habitat patches were identiﬁed by snorkeling surveys on 4 june 1997. fifteen con- secutive habitat patches were selected for study over a 1-km section of river in 1997; ﬁve habitat patches were monitored in 1998. an area was con- sidered to be a viable habitat patch if more than one blue shiner was present. patches were delin- eated by observing the distribution of shiners for 15–30 min and were marked using weighted ﬂoats. the length and width of each patch was measured. three transects were run in each patch, and three measurements were made for water ﬂow (marsh- mcbirney digital meter) and water depth. the sub- strate composition of each patch was also char- acterized. blue shiners were collected from each patch by seine (permit . – sa 97–21 – u.s. fish and wild- life service endangered/threatened species subper- mittee authorization). fish were held in aerated water for processing. prior to marking, individual ﬁsh were anesthetized in a 200 mg/l solution of tricane methanesulfonate. fish were then meas- ured to the nearest mm standard length (sl), sexed when possible (in may, males can be distinguished from females by breeding coloration and breeding tubercles) and given a batch mark unique to the habitat patch of capture. marks were applied by injecting a small amount of non-toxic paint under the skin using a 3 cc syringe and 20 gauge needle. the marks for each habitat patch were made table 1. number of blue shiners marked and

due to pro- cessing or collecting occurred during this study. snorkeling surveys for marked blue shiners were made 4, 18, 54 and 84 days post-marking (8 june, 23 june, 25 july and 26 august 1997) in 1997 and 15, 24, 34, 40, 45, 52, 59, and 82 days post-marking in 1998 (29 may, 7 june, 17 june, 23 june, 6 july, 13 july and 5 august). the study period included moderate to low water levels (late spring to early fall). the snorkeler moved slowly through the habitat patch, counting both marked and un- marked blue shiners, and identifying marks, when present. results were tabulated on underwater writing pads. between 10 and 45 min was spent surveying each patch; time varied with patch size. areas between patches were also examined for the results a total of 180 blue shiners were marked in 15 habi- tat patches (table 1, fig. 1) in 1997; 172 were marked in ﬁve habitat patches in 1998. the mean sl of females was 58.4 mm (sd‰6.1, n‰95) and of males was 72.3 mm (sd‰9.7, n‰80) (ﬁve indi- viduals were classiﬁed as juveniles). this difference was signiﬁcant (t‰11.5, p‰0.0001), and the sex ratio was slightly female biased, 1.17 females:1 male. the size of habitat patches ranged from 7.6 to 163.2 m, and the distance between patches ranged from 3.1 to 93.5 m (fig. 1). habitat patches were separated by two types of mesohabitat: glide or rifﬂe. recapture (marked ﬁsh observed) rates of blue shiners ranged from 0 to 58% per habitat patch (average 18%, adjusted for two patches with no re- captures during the study period). these recapture rates are typical for this type of study (hill & grossman 1987; gowan et al. 1994; freeman 1995). the majority of blue shiners observed did not move from the habitat patch where they were originally captured (fig. 2). the proportion of the population that moved in 1997 was 15% 4 days post-marking, 17% 18 days post-marking, 21% 51 days post-marking and 33% 84 days post-marking. only six individuals moved in 1998; of 164 recap- tures, this represents 4% of the recapture popula- tion. seven individuals were marked in 1997 and recaptured in 1998; four of these had not moved from the patch where originally marked, two had moved to an adjacent patch, and one had moved six patches upstream. eighty-three percent of these ﬁsh moved to adjacent habitat patches. since ﬁshes could not be identiﬁed individually, these are cumulative estimates; e.g., these ﬁgures contain table 2. numbers of ﬁsh marked, estimated population size (total no. marked (cid:192) no. caught in subsequent sample/total no. of recaptures), proportion of

large individuals were observed feeding in rifﬂes ad- jacent to habitat patches. the average distance traveled by mobile ﬁsh was 130.7 m; the shortest distance was 3.1 m, and the longest distance was 332.0 m. fish traveled over both glide and rifﬂe mesohabitats. most moves were to adjacent patches, but some ﬁsh moved as far as six habitat patches. fish moved both up- stream and downstream in approximately equal numbers (fig. 2). the estimated population size in ﬁve habitat patches ranged from 31–106 individuals (table 2). between 47% and 71% of ﬁsh were marked per patch, and between 30% and 56% of the expected numbers of recaptures were actually observed. discussion although the majority of blue shiners observed in this study did not move from the habitat patch were they were originally captured, a proportion of ﬁsh did move from one patch to another. this proportion is less than expected (equal chance of being in any given patch) if the ﬁsh are randomly distributed throughout the river, however. these ﬁndings are similar to the results of other studies on ﬁsh movement that conclude that most individ- 174 uals are primarily sedentary, with only small num- bers of individuals moving (gerking 1959; gun- ning & shoop 1963; power 1984; hill & grossman 1987; freeman 1995). the cumulative proportion of ﬁsh that moved after 84 days represented only about a third of the study population. at any given time, the proportion of ﬁsh that moved among habitat patches is lower (15% at the ﬁrst sample). studies of ﬁsh movement have been criticized re- cently for methodologically biasing results towards the recapture of ﬁshes in areas of release and for the inability to account for ﬁsh that are not recap- tured (gowan et al. 1994; gowan & fausch 1996). in this study, areas outside the study patches were searched for marked ﬁsh, and none were found. if blue shiners make common long-range move- ments, some ﬁsh would have been observed outside of the study area during these moves. approxi- mately half of the blue shiners expected to be re- captured were observed, on average, in this study. where are the rest of the ﬁsh? given that, at any given time, some ﬁsh move (15–33%); tagging mor- tality accounts for 0.05%; and a conservative esti- mate of natural mortality is 50% of the adult population during the summer (krotzer 1984), it can be assumed that most of these ﬁsh are not making rapid long-range movements out of the study area. low recapture rates can be accounted for, primarily, by mortality and movement. there are also species differences in movement patterns, and all species cannot ﬁt one model. even within cyprinids, some species have been shown to have long-range migrations (e.g., leuciscus leuciscus, clough & ladle 1997; barbus barbus, lucas & batley 1996), while others are relatively sedentary (e.g., notropis lutipinnis, goforth & foltz 1998). the average distance moved by blue shiners was 130.7 m, and the greatest distance traversed was 332.0 m, by just one ﬁsh. blue shiners were only rarely observed outside of habitat patches. these results suggest that blue shiners do not range freely throughout a continuous stream system, a view of ﬁsh movement held by linﬁeld (1985) based on ﬁndings for european cyprinids. only a small pro- portion of the blue shiner population moves among habitat patches at a given time, and move- ments are largely restricted to nearby habitat patches. blue shiners are capable of longer range movements, however, but these events are relatively rare, and ﬁsh may use intervening habitat patches as stepping stones as they travel. these results sug- gest that blue shiners exist as a series of relatively isolated subpopulations within the riverine eco- system. rifﬂe and glide mesohabitats are not barriers to movement by blue shiners, which moved through these areas to get to new habitat patches. fish were also able to move both upstream and downstream. these results suggest a probable mechanism for dispersal of adults in this species. at any given time, a small number of individuals move short distances to adjacent habitat patches. the factors that inﬂuence ﬁsh movement are not known, but may include any number of biotic or abiotic fac- tors: food resources, reduced competition, pre- dation pressure or better quality physical habitat. it is this dynamic that may be responsible for colonization of new or vacant habitat patches and may also be responsible for maintaining contact between subpopulations along a continuum. this mechanism for maintaining connectivity among subpopulations highlights the importance of pro- tecting continuous habitat patches for this species. although blue shiners can move as far as 332.0 meters, movement of even this relatively short dis- tance is rare. more often, mobile ﬁsh were found in adjacent habitat patches, suggesting that they may move from patch to patch. without suitable intervening habitat, blue shiners may not be able to successfully move to the next suitable habitat patch, and movement may be even more rare, dis- rupting the connection between subpopulations. movement patterns may also change according to habitat quality, but this has yet to be investigated. nothing is known about larval dispersal in this species. eggs hatch while hidden in crevices, and it is likely that the fry and larvae do not move far blue shiner movement from where they hatch. this proposal is based on the observation of numerous cyprinid fry and in the study area, but this aspect of blue shiner ecol- ogy needs investigation. the results of this study emphasize the import- ance of protecting habitat quality throughout the course of a river or stream. subpopulations of aquatic organisms in the same river may become isolated if appropriate intervening habitat is de- stroyed. without a source of immigrants, stochas- ticity may be responsible for local extinctions, and over time the extirpation or extinction of species. resumen 1. cyprinella caerulea es un ciprı´nido amenazado que vive en ha´bitats discretos en mosaico, aunque se desconoce si estas po- blaciones representan subpoblaciones distintas o una poblacio´n continua. 2. durante 1997 y 1998, estudiamos los patrones en los movi- mientos de individuos adultos entre habitats en mosaico en el rı´o conasauga (tennessee-georgia, usa) para determinar si el desplazamiento entre distintos mosaicos son restringidos o si cada mosaico representa una subpoblacio´n relativamente dis- creta. los movimientos se restringieron a una pequen˜a propor- cio´n de individuos en cada momento y la mayor parte se movie- ron entre ha´bitats adyacentes. la distancia media recorrida por los peces durante los dos an˜os de estudio (1997–1998) fue´ de 130.7 m. meso-habitats tipo ra´pidos y tablas no suponen barre- ras para la dispersio´n. nu´meros muy similares de individuos se movieron aguas arriba o abajo. 3. se sugiere que los peces que se mueven en un momento dado son responsables de la recolonizacio´n de los mosaicos que reali- zan a trave´s de movimientos acumulados por pasos entre ha´bi- tats adyacentes, y que los ha´bitats intermedios son necesarios para mantener la conexio´n de la poblacio´n entera. 4. la especie existe en el rı´o conasauga como subpoblaciones relativamente discretas. este descubrimiento enfatiza la impor- tancia de proteger la integridad del ha´bitat a lo largo del curso del rı´o para prevenir el aislamiento de las subpoblaciones. esta especie se podrı´a utilizar como modelo para la
