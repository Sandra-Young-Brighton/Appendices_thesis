mean pacific lamprey cpue in off-channel habitats was 4 and 32 times greater than in pools and riffles respectively. restoration and conservation strategies that improve fish passage, enhance natural hydrologic and depositional processes and increase habitat heterogeneity will likely benefit larval pacific lamprey. key words: pacific lamprey; willamette river (usa); native species; habitat associations; conservation introduction anadromous fishes are inextricably linked to environ- mental conditions in both freshwater and marine habi- tats (mcdowall 1988), and conservation of these fishes requires an understanding of how factors inter- act within both environments (parrish et al. 1998; naiman & latterell 2005). on the west coast of north america, freshwater habitats provide the migra- returning tion corridor to spawning locations for anadromous adults (e.g. beamish & levings 1991; goniea et al. 2006; clemens et al. 2012), rearing locations for juveniles (bjornn & reiser 1991; reeves et al. 1995; jolley et al. 2012) and migratory routes to the ocean for emigrating juveniles (e.g. mueller et al. 2006; petrosky & schaller 2010). although marine habitat and environmental conditions influence sur- vival and growth of maturing fishes (e.g. bisbal & mcconnaha 1998; levin et al. 2001; murauskas et al. 2013), understanding the importance of environmental correspondence: l. d. schultz, oregon cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, department of fisheries and wildlife, u. s. geological survey, 104 nash hall, oregon state university, corvallis, or 97331-3803, usa. e-mail: luke.schultz@oregonstate.edu acurrent address: rural aquaculture promotion, peace corps, lusaka, zambia. bcurrent address: north santiam, south santiam and calapooia watershed councils, po box 844, brownsville, or 97327, usa. ccurrent address: oregon department of fish and wildlife, corvallis fish research, 28655 highway 34, corvallis, or 97333, usa. this draft manuscript is distributed solely for purposes of scientific peer review. its content is deliberative and predecisional, so it must not be disclosed or released by reviewers. because the manuscript has not yet been approved for publication by the u.s. geological survey (usgs), it does not represent any offi- cial usgs finding or policy. doi: 10.1111/eff.12207 261 schultz et al. conditions in freshwater ecosystems is also critical to the management of anadromous stocks. life as tridentatus and subsequent semelparous in freshwater pacific lamprey entosphenus is a native, anadromous fish in the pacific northwest with a historic distribution that ranged from baja mexico to the bering sea of alaska (scott & crossman cycle 1973). consists of its 3–8 years filter-feeding larvae (ammocoetes), followed by a physiological and mor- phological transformation into outmigrants (macroph- thalmia), emigration to marine environments (clemens et al. 2010). the parasitic marine stage lasts <3 and a half years (reviewed in clemens et al. 2010), where individual lampreys can range as far north as the northwest pacific ocean and bering sea (sviridov et al. 2007; orlov et al. 2008) before returning to freshwater to hold prior to spawning. the freshwater holding period can last from <1 month up to 2 years until making a final migration to their ultimate spawning areas (clemens et al. 2010, 2012, 2013; starcevich et al. 2013). because freshwater rearing makes up a relatively large fraction of the life cycle of pacific lamprey, this stage is generally viewed as critical for the viability of the species (e.g. critfc 2011). across its range in western north america, pacific lamprey has declined considerably over the last half century (luzier et al. 2011), including extirpation from multiple drainages (ward et al. 2012). returns to the first upstream dam on the columbia river (bonneville dam) averaged >100,000 adults between 1939 and 1969, but have declined to an average of <40,000 between 1997 and 2010 (murauskas et al. 2013). similarly, annual returns at the only major dam on the north umpqua river, oregon (winches- ter dam) in 2013 were estimated to be 1044 adults (k. crispen coates, cow creek band of umpqua tribe of indian, personal communication), whereas historic returns (1965–1971) were estimated to be 14,532–46,785 adults (goodman et al. 2005). despite the many important ecological and cultural roles of pacific lamprey (outlined in close et al. 2002), con- servation efforts have been hampered by a negative association with invasive sea lamprey petromyzon marinus (clemens et al. 2010), a perceived threat to commercial fisheries (e.g. beamish & levings 1991) and numerous knowledge gaps in its biology (mesa & copeland 2009; clemens et al. 2010; luzier et al. 2011; critfc 2011). larval pacific lamprey abundance in streams is a function of rearing habitat quality, as well as accessi- bility for returning adults. adult passage at hydro- electric facilities has received substantial research attention, and management actions have prioritised this potential limiting factor (e.g. moser et al. 2002a; keefer et al. 2010). however, the habitat require- 262 ments and ecology of the larval stage have been rela- tively understudied (moser et al. 2007; critfc 2011) but see torgersen & close 2004; jolley et al. 2012). previous work has evaluated larval habitat requirements within individual streams (e.g. torger- sen & close 2004); however, there is a pressing need for broader evaluations, which can weigh the relative importance of fine-scale habitat characteristics against such as spawning distribution-related variables, migration distance and the presence of smaller obstructions (e.g. culverts, diversions, cascades). tribes for pacific northwest across the range of pacific lamprey, the willam- ette river, oregon (usa), has one of the largest adult returns and is one of the few remaining harvest locations (critfc 2011). although the willamette river basin appears to contain a relatively robust pacific lamprey popula- tion, the basin contains habitat perturbations that commonly impair stream habitats across the pacific northwest [e.g. loss of large woody structure, land use conversion, stream diversion and channelisation, point and nonpoint source pollution, and fish passage issues (sedell et al. 1990; naiman & bilby 1998; mulvey et al. 2009)]. because pacific lamprey have persisted in this mix of impaired and relatively intact habitat conditions, insights into the ecology of wil- lamette river basin pacific lamprey may be readily applied to other freshwater habitats across its range. our objective was to estimate the effect of fine-scale habitat characteristics, landscape disturbance indices and putative barriers on the abundance of larval paci- fic lamprey. our multiyear study addressed critical knowledge gaps about the larval stage that have been identified in conservation planning, (e.g. luzier et al. 2011) and can be used to make broader inferences about limiting factors for larval pacific lamprey and other western lampreys (e.g. western brook lamprey lampetra richardsoni and pacific brook lamprey l. pacifica) in the pacific northwest. methods larval lamprey and habitat sampling we sampled wadeable locations in 14 tributary sub- basins of the willamette river from july to october in 2011—2013 (fig. 1). we sampled clear, crabtree, deep, marys and thomas sub-basins in 2011; abiqua, butte, clear, crabtree, deep, marys, mill, thomas and willamina sub-basins in 2012; and calapooia, clear, luckiamute, marys, mckenzie, mohawk, tho- mas and tualatin sub-basins in 2013. in each of these sub-basins, we tried to sample three locations on the mainstem stream channel: one located near the down- stream end of wadeable stream habitat, one near the cascades mountains or coast range ecotone with the larval pacific lamprey habitat fig. 1. sampling locations for larval pacific lamprey in the willamette river basin, oregon (usa), 2011–2013. closed symbols indicate reaches where pacific lamprey were sampled, and open symbols indicate areas where pacific lamprey were not detected. each reach consisted of four habitat units and additional off-channel habitat units, if present (see methods for more details). willamette valley ecotype (from omernik 1987) and one roughly equidistant between these two locations. the exception was the tualatin and mckenzie rivers, where the mainstem was mostly nonwadeable, so we sampled locations in wadable tributaries near the con- fluence with those larger rivers at similar positions within their respective watersheds. this approach was an attempt to capture a variety of habitat types and examine potential differences in relative abundance with landscape position and stream size longitudinally in these sub-basins. at each of these locations, we sampled larval lam- preys and quantified physical habitat characteristics in sample reaches. each reach consisted of two pool and two riffle habitat units, with a nonsampled riffle/ pool between to avoid recapture of the same individ- uals if sampling was completed over multiple days. if an off-channel habitat type (e.g. side channel, back- water, isolated pool) was present within a sample reach, it was sampled separately as an additional hab- itat unit. although subjectivity is common in stream habitat classification, we selected habitat units that were representative of the surrounding stream habitat conditions within the vicinity of the sample reach (i.e. ~150 m up/downstream). we used backpack electrofishing to sample larval lampreys from habitat units to estimate abundance. we moved upstream through each habitat unit using a single electrofishing pass to sample the entire unit with an abp-2 backpack electrofisher (engineering technical services, madison, wi, usa). netters fol- lowed the electrofisher and were equipped with 3/16- mesh dip nets, 500-lm d-frame invertebrate nets and fine mesh aquarium nets. the electrofisher applied a pulsed burst train (3 on: 1 off) with a 25% duty cycle to induce larval lamprey emergence from the substrate and a fast pulse at 30 pulsessec  1 to temporarily im- mobilise individual larvae and facilitate capture. these electrofisher settings are commonly used in other lamprey research (e.g. torgersen & close 2004; moser et al. 2007). following electrofishing of each habitat unit, captured lamprey were anesthetised using 263 schultz et al. 50 mgl  1 tricaine methanesulfonate (ms-222) buf- fered with 125 mgl  1 sodium bicarbonate (nah- co3), measured (total length, in mm), enumerated and allowed to recover before being returned to the stream near their capture location. we used caudal pigmenta- tion characteristics as described in goodman et al. (2009) and a regional dichotomous field key (s. reid, western fishes, unpublished data) for identification. identification of pacific lamprey macrophthalmia was aided by the presence of large emergent/emerged eyes and silver body coloration. only individuals >60 mm were identified to species because accurate keys for species identification have not yet been developed for lamprey <60 mm (goodman et al. 2009). we did not attempt to identify brook lampreys to species because differentiating between these two species (i.e. western brook lamprey and pacific brook lamprey) requires an examination of trunk myomeres (reid et al. 2011). to verify our identification of species, we submitted 272 samples from putative pacific lamprey (size range 60—141 mm) for genetic analyses (hess et al. 2014). species identification was important for meeting our goal because differences in the relative catch rate of pacific and brook lampreys provided insight into the influence of adult migration barriers. pacific and brook lampreys are thought to have similar habitat associations and are commonly sympatric (beamish & lowartz 1996; torgersen & close 2004; schultz et al. 2014); thus, areas that contain solely brook lamprey could suggest limited access for returning pacific lam- prey adults. because the sampling area varied between different units, we measured the relative abundance of pacific lamprey in each habitat unit using catch-per- unit-effort (cpue), calculated as the number of fish sampled per square metre (fish m2). we measured geomorphic characteristics of each habitat unit by establishing five evenly spaced tran- sects perpendicular to the stream channel along the length of each habitat unit. at each transect, we mea- sured wetted stream width and dominant substrate at five evenly spaced points along the transect starting at the wetted stream margin. the percentage of fine sub- strate area was computed by dividing the number of points on transects with sand or finer substrate by the total number of points measured within a habitat unit. for each reach, we also summarised large-scale variables to evaluate the potential effects of anthropo- genic disturbance, migration distance and barriers on larval pacific lamprey abundance. anthropogenic dis- turbance was quantified using a cumulative distur- bance index obtained from data layers in the national fish habitat partnership data system (wang et al. 2011). these disturbance indices provide a composite index for a stream reach that accounts for multiple types of anthropogenic disturbances and combine dis- turbance scores from local catchment areas and all 264 et al. (esselman upstream catchments 2011). disturbance scores range from one to four, with one being highly disturbed and four being undisturbed. we computed the distance from each sampling loca- tion to the columbia river to assess the influence of adult migration distance on the abundance of larval pacific lamprey. finally, we evaluated the effect of barriers by determining whether or not individual habitat units were upstream of natural or anthropo- genic obstructions. barriers were identified using the oregon fish passage barrier data standard data set (ofprbs; oregon department of fish and wildlife 2012). the ofprbs contained a georeferenced list of 30,000 statewide natural and anthropogenic obstructions in streams (e.g. bridges, cascades, cul- verts, dams). of these, the willamette river basin contained ~7000 barriers, most of which were on first or second order tributaries in the headwaters of for- ested stream networks, so only four barriers were present reaches (described in detail in schultz et al. 2014). although obstructions were given standardised passability rat- ings which include complete, partial and unknown, we classified reaches as barrier-influenced if obstruc- tions of any kind, and with any passability rating, existed downstream. we included all barriers because passability is often judged based on teleost swimming abilities and because lamprey passage requirements differ from other fishes (moser & mesa 2009; keefer et al. 2010). although some of these barriers may provide partial passage, we were interested in how any degree of impaired passability influenced larval populations above these potential barriers. interspersed amid our sample we used an information theoretic approach to examine the relative influence of habitat characteris- tics, measured at different spatial scales, on the cpue of larval pacific lamprey (burnham & anderson 2002). candidate models represented nested and com- peting hypotheses regarding predictors of larval lam- prey cpue. we ranked models using akaike’s information criterion, adjusted for small sample sizes (aicc), and akaike weights wr. all models contained a random effect for ‘sub-basin’, which was used to account for the lack of spatial independence among sub-basins (see schultz et al. 2014). a fixed effect for ‘year’ was also included in all candidate models. although interannual cpue was not of great interest to our study, ‘year’ was included as a fixed effect because a random intercept could not be reliably esti- mated with the 3 years of sampling in this data set. the candidate set consisted of a global model with large-scale (i.e. disturbance, migration distance, bar- rier presence) and fine-scale habitat variables (i.e. hab- itat unit type, mean sediment depth, percentage of fine substrate; table 1). models with only the suite of large-scale or fine-scale variables were included along table 1. candidate models, number of parameters (k), log-likelihood, aicc, daicc and wi

(habitat unit, sediment volume). reduced models included suites of fine-scale and large-scale predictors, and single-predictor models. the null model consisted of a random effect for sub-basin and a fixed effect for sampling year. with models that contained individual predictors. a null model was also included to assess goodness of fit (i.e. the support of candidate models versus a model of annual mean cpue). the null model contained a ‘sub-basin’ random effect and a ‘year’ fixed effect. a generalised linear mixed modelling approach was used to describe the influence of habitat variables on pacific lamprey cpue (venables & dichmont 2004; bolker et al. 2009). we fitted negative binomial mixed-effects models using larval lamprey catch within each habitat unit as the response variable and area sampled (m2) as an offset (irwin et al. 2013). negative binomial regression is one of several pre- ferred methods for modelling overdispersed count responses and for handling a high number of zero counts (ver hoef & boveng 2007; zuur et al. 2009). all continuous predictors were standardised by sub- tracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation, which allowed effect sizes of continuous variables to be compared on the same scale. fit of top models was assessed by examining anscombe residu- als (hilbe 2008; irwin et al. 2013). we interpreted parameters of top ranking models by calculating the exponential function of parameters, which describes the multiplicative effect of a single standard deviation increase of a continuous predictor or a different level of a categorical predictor on the expected cpue of larval lampreys (mccullagh & nelder 1989). results we captured a total of 11,153 larval lamprey between 2011 and 2013, 7574 pacific lamprey (67.9%), 1128

were captured after the middle of august. we sam- pled 267 main-channel units and 16 off-channel units accross a variety of habitats in sub-basins in the wil- lamette river basin (table 2). in general, reaches located further upstream in tributary sub-basins were narrower, shallower and characterised by coarser sub- strates than reaches lower in sub-basins. reaches upstream of identified barriers generally appeared to contain physical habitat similar to reaches without barriers. pacific lamprey were sampled from nearly all sample reaches (84.1%), but not all habitat units. larval pacific lamprey and brook lamprey were not detected at 29.5% of the sampled habitat units, pri- marily in abiqua, dairy, deep, gales, horse, mckay and quartz creeks, all of which contained down- stream barriers (fig. 1). model selection showed the greatest support for the global model, which contained all large-scale and fine-scale predictors (table 1). although all predic- tors were included in the top model, estimates of effect sizes varied considerably (table 3). the vari- able with the greatest influence on larval cpue was habitat unit type. parameter estimates from the top model lamprey cpue was higher in pools than in riffles, but highest in off- channel habitats (fig. 2). larval pacific lamprey cpue estimates were 4 [2.83, 5.78 (95% lcl, 95% ucl)] times higher in off-channel habitats than pool habitats and 32 (14.12, 71.01) times higher in off- channel habitats than riffle habitats. indicated that larval the presence of downstream barriers appeared to

barriers indicated that larval pacific lamprey cpue upstream of natural and anthropogenic barriers was 45.26% lower than in areas without downstream barriers (fig. 3). the vari- able effect of downstream barriers was strongly influ- enced by a particular stream that was sampled in 2011 (i.e. clear creek). we sampled fewer reaches upstream of barriers in 2011 than in 2012 and 2013, and one of the three reaches above barriers that were sampled in 2011 contained high numbers of larval lamprey and substantially influenced the parameter estimate for barriers across all 3 years. in 2012 and 266 2013, we sampled twelve reaches upstream of barri- ers. if these years are analysed separately, the esti- mated reduction in larval pacific lamprey cpue upstream of barriers was substantial and more precise (64.69%; 95% confidence interval: 45.11, 77.3). all reaches where pacific lamprey were not collected were upstream of barriers, although individuals <60 mm could not be identified to species and may have been pacific lamprey. in several sub-basins (e.g. tualatin river), brook lamprey cpue was relatively high, but pacific lamprey densities were substantially lower than other sub-basins. densities were associated with relatively minor predictors of larval cpue were cumulative disturbance index, substrate characteris- tics and migration distance. interestingly, higher lar- val greater anthropogenic disturbance (fig. 3). distance to the columbia river had a slightly negative effect on lar- val pacific lamprey cpue, but was highly variable. percentage fine sediment was positively related to larval pacific lamprey cpue. the 95% confidence interval for ‘year’ parameters overlapped zero consid- erably, indicating that pacific lamprey cpue did not differ substantially between years. discussion the relative abundance of larval pacific lamprey in the willamette river basin was best explained by habitat unit type (i.e. pool, riffle, off-channel) and, to a lesser degree, reach-scale habitat features. at larger scales, the cpue of larval pacific lamprey in the willamette river basin was driven primarily by migration barriers to adults. similar patterns of habi- tat use and distribution have been described for other lamprey species (e.g. slade et al. 2003; torgersen & close 2004; clemens et al. 2010; jackson & moser 2012). the findings from this study emphasise the importance of restoration activities that provide paci- fic lamprey with increased access to streams with high habitat heterogeneity and channel complexity. the density of pacific lamprey was substantially higher in off-channel habitats; thus, streams with higher channel complexity (e.g. side channels, back- water pools) are likely to support greater abundances. common mitigation measures for pacific lamprey include barrier removal/modifications and transloca- tion of adult fish above barriers (e.g. close et al. 2009, ward et al. 2012). our study suggests that both of these approaches will be more valuable in streams with relatively high proportions of low-velocity habi- tats (i.e. pools and off-channel habitats), because these habitats can sustain higher densities of larvae. in fact, we estimate that 1 m2 of low-velocity habitat is equivalent to roughly 11 m2 of riffle habitat. our research concurred with other work on pacific larval pacific lamprey

future larval pacific lamprey monitoring might consider additional habitat variables of interest such as sub- strate organic matter or chlorophyll a, which have been related to the distribution of other lampreys (e.g. geotria australis; potter et al. 1986). returning pacific lamprey often encounter passage issues from anthropogenic barriers, and their passage requirements differ from salmonids (moser et al. 2002b; keefer et al. 2010; jackson & moser 2012). improving passage efficiency for pacific lamprey has been prioritised at large hydropower dams in the columbia river system (e.g. keefer et al. 2010; mesa et al. 2010; luzier et al. 2011), but the influ- ence of smaller and more prevalent dams as potential migration barriers has received much less attention (critfc 2011 but see jackson & moser 2012). in the tualatin and mckenzie river sub-basins, larval pacific lamprey were sampled in several reaches above putative barriers, suggesting that some of the barriers that were identified in the study were not complete barriers to lamprey migration. conversely, our evidence suggests that the abiqua creek sub- basin may contain a complete barrier to pacific lam- prey (fig. 1). opportunistic sampling above a ~5 m high municipal water supply diversion dam in 2014 failed to detect any larval pacific lamprey (l. schultz, unpublished data). the ability of an adult lamprey to pass a barrier is likely dependent upon hydraulic fea- tures and flow conditions within the obstacle (reviewed in stillwater sciences 2014), as well as attributes of individual spawners (keefer et al. 2009). future studies should incorporate barrier type into models of to determine where barrier removals or modification lamprey density and abundance would be most valuable for reconnecting lamprey habitat. released by larval although physical barriers are widely recognised as challenges to the conservation of pacific lamprey (e.g. moser & mesa 2009; clemens et al. 2010; keefer et al. 2010), chemical barriers may also present pas- sage issues. upon entry into freshwater, pacific lam- prey do not home in the strict sense (spice et al. 2012). instead, adult pacific lamprey are attracted to bile acid chemicals lamprey (robinson et al. 2009; yun et al. 2011). environmen- tal pollutants can disrupt physiology and behaviour of other fishes (e.g. scott & sloman 2004; hughes et al. 2014), but the extent to which many chemicals effect migration of pacific lamprey is unknown. the tuala- tin river sub-basin contained relatively few larval pacific lamprey, but brook lamprey catch rates were consistent with other sub-basins that we sampled. although the tualatin river contained a putative physical barrier near its confluence with the willam- ette river, 27% of the sub-basin’s watershed is also urbanised and it contains the greatest stream length with impaired water quality of all the 14 willamette river sub-basins (mulvey et al. 2009). numerous stream segments within the watershed are listed on the 303d (impaired waterways) list of the united states environmental protection agency (epa 2014. for example, disturbances associated with land use practices that occur in the urbanised (downstream) reaches of the tualatin river might contribute to water quality conditions that deter adult pacific lam- prey from moving into this sub-basin or otherwise prohibit successful reproduction, despite habitat con- ditions being suitable for lampreys in the upstream reaches of the sub-basin. although some chemicals have been identified that alter the behaviour of adult pacific lamprey (e.g. atrazine, smith 2012), is it 267 schultz et al. possible that a combination of multiple chemicals work in concert to impede lamprey migratory cues. to restore pacific lamprey to areas where they have been extirpated, anthropogenic physical and chemical migration barriers must be identified and management actions need to improve adult passage at these loca- tions to seed suitable upstream habitats. our top model suggested that larval pacific lam- prey density was higher in catchments with greater anthropogenic disturbance, which is contrary to what we predicted. however, the habitat requirements of larval lamprey are very different from the fish species the cumulative disturbance index is designed for (e.g. mostly teleost sport fishes; esselman et al. 2011), which may explain the effect we observed. another interpretation is that pacific lamprey in the willam- ette may not be negatively affected by riparian habitat degradation and could actually benefit from addi- tional nutrients and sediments associated with distur- bances this hypothesis conflicts with numerous studies that have identified a link between anthropogenic development and habitat degradation (e.g. bjornn & reiser 1991; roni 2003; naiman & latterell 2005; mulvey et al. 2009). more direct evaluations of disturbances from land use and additional investigations in other areas within the pacific lamprey range will help to eluci- date this relationship. from land use practices. however, our study also found that a consideration of habitat structure may be useful for improving the efficiency of sampling designs. sampling programmes can pro- duce more precise estimates if auxiliary variables that partition variability are included (thompson 2012). all habitat units must be included in the survey if a study’s goal is to make inferences about the entire population of lamprey, but more precise estimates can be obtained if more samples are gathered from habitat units with higher variability in the response. variance in lamprey counts increases with the number of indi- viduals sampled; thus, researchers can obtain more precise cpue estimates with the same number of samples if a larger proportion of samples are allocated to low-velocity habitats (slade et al. 2003; moser et al. 2007). several variables, including a few that we measured in this study (e.g. fine sediment percent- age), could also be used to model variable detection probability among sites and improve estimates of effect sizes (mackenzie et al. 2006; royle & dorazio 2008). acknowledging imperfect detection of lam- preys is important because field research often finds that animals have an affinity for habitats that are the most difficult for researchers to sample effectively. in the case of this study, it is conceivable that greater sediment volumes in a low-velocity area might increase the density of lamprey, but at the same time reduce electrofishing capture efficiency. we believe 268 to measure or that future research should attempt account for habitat-specific detection probability, because this might help to better resolve the effects of fine-scale habitat variables. these methods would increase the realism of density models and allow for a continual refinement of the sampling process. immediate management action might address the decline of pacific lamprey, and our findings suggest that improving stream accessibility and habitat com- plexity will help to restore the historic distribution of pacific lamprey (critfc 2011). freshwater habitats across the pacific northwest have been highly influ- enced by current and historic land use practices (bis- son et al. 1992; mcintosh et al. 2000) that limit the availability of larval rearing habitat for pacific lam- prey. conservation strategies that improve watershed conditions and restore riparian communities will set the physical template for habitat restoration (naiman & latterell 2005). instream projects that stabilise stream channels and retain fine substrates and woody structure might increase available rearing habitat for lamprey species (e.g. roni 2003). effective monitor- ing of the responses of physical habitat in these treat- ments will be necessary to inform subsequent management actions. evaluating and addressing migration barriers followed by mitigation actions to improve adult passage will help increase the distribu- tion and abundance of larval pacific lamprey across its historic range. finally, continued monitoring of the occurrence and relative abundance of larval pacific lamprey will document changes in its distribution and increase the understanding of its ecology. acknowledgements funding for this study was provided by the columbia river inter-tribal fish
