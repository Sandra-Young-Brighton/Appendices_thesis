perhaps due to the fairly small catchment area of the reservoir and the highly regulated discharge at igarapava dam. p. m. bizzotto1, a. l. godinho2, v. vono2, b. kynard3, h. p. godinho1 1graduate program on vertebrate zoology, pontiﬁcal catholic university of minas gerais, belo horizonte, mg, brazil, 2fish passage center, federal university of minas gerais, belo horizonte, mg, brazil, 3u.s. geological survey, leetown science center, s.o. conte anadromous fish research center, turners falls, ma, usa key words: vertical-slot ﬁsh ladder;

e-mail: hgodinho@ ufmg.br accepted for publication february 25, 2009 introduction the neotropical region is a home to a major compo- nent of the global freshwater ﬁsh fauna, including about 6000 of the world’s 13,000 ﬁshes (reis et al. 2003). as in other parts of the world, this rich natural resource has been subject to severe anthropogenic impacts because many rivers have been dammed for hydropower generation and other purposes (karr 1993). among many impacts on riverine ﬁshes and their habitat, dams interfere with the innate drive of migrant species to move between various habitats during their life history (mcmahon & matter 2006). the ﬁrst attempt to reconnect essential habitats of migratory ﬁshes in dammed rivers in brazil was made less than one century ago. since then, over 50 ﬁshways (mostly pool and weir ﬁsh ladders) have been constructed in brazil. however, only a small number of these ﬁshways were evaluated speciﬁcally with respect to selectivity and efﬁciency (godinho et al. 1991; agostinho et al. 2002, 2007a; alves 2007; makrakis et al. 2007). other aspects of ﬁsh passage equally important for management success (e.g., downstream migration, ﬁsh delays at dams, passage mortality, motivation for migration, etc.) still remain unclear or not studied. upstream ﬁsh passage at dams has recently re-attracted attention in brazil because novel laws mandated their construction with any new hydroelectric dam in two major states. as a result, several their contribution to ﬁsh conservation is unknown, a situation that stresses the need for studies evaluating existing facilities. recent ﬁshways are operational, but vertical-slot ﬁsh ladders are currently the best type of technical ﬁshway in situations where there are many diverse species of ﬁsh (fao ⁄ dvwk 2002). with a doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00361.x 461 bizzotto et al. low slope, low water velocities, and low turbulence, they have great potential to pass the diverse migratory ﬁsh fauna of subtropical and tropical rivers (stuart & mallen-cooper 1999; stuart & berghuis 2002). nev- ertheless, few vertical-slot ﬁsh ladders have been installed in south america and no comprehensive evaluation of passage by ﬁshes in this type of ﬁshway has been published from this region. monitoring ﬁsh passage is an important tool for evaluating the performance of any ﬁshway, for establishing operational and management protocols, and for producing improved future designs (travade & larinier 2002; morgan & beatty 2006). the use of video monitoring of ﬁsh passing in a ﬁshway is an effective and inexpensive tool for analysing ﬁsh passage (haro & kynard 1997). as a noninvasive method of observing ﬁsh, this technique does not interfere with behaviour or movements of ﬁsh. com- parison of ﬁsh counts between in situ human visual observations and video images of passing ﬁsh at the igarapava fish ladder (ifl), grande river, brazil, demonstrated that video monitoring is an accurate method of counting ﬁsh during passage (bowen et al. 2006). this study is the ﬁrst evaluation of ﬁsh passage in the ifl, the ﬁrst vertical-slot ladder built in brazil. using video monitoring, the study was aimed to (i) identify the taxa using the ladder; (ii) determine the abundance of each taxon; (iii) investigate relationships between ﬁsh counts and six environmental factors: season, diel, moon phase, rainfall, dam discharge, and water temperature. materials and methods study area the ifl was built at igarapava dam (19°59¢36¢s, 47°45¢32¢w) mainly due to the demand of local ﬁsher communities. it is located on the middle grande river, a major tributary of the upper parana´ river. there are 130 hydroelectric power plants at dams higher than 10 m operating in the upper parana´ river basin (agostinho et al. 2003). the 12 large dams along the 1300 km grande river have divided the once rapid-ﬂowing river into a succession of human-made reservoirs with varying amount of riverine habitat between the reser- voirs and dams. igarapava dam is located at river km 425 (from the mouth), 76 km upstream from volta grande dam and 46 km downstream jaguara dam (fig. 1a). the igarapava reservoir is 40 km long and inundates an area of 39 km2. the ifl (fig. 1b–d) started operation in 1999. it is 282 m long, 17.5 m high, and has a slope of 6%. as swimming capability of local ﬁshes was unknown at the time of the ifl construction, it was designed with 462 a low slope for moderate–poor swimming ﬁshes. this would allow more ﬁsh taxa to pass around the dam due to the low water velocity at the slot, which is in the )1 (viana 2005). the ladder has range of 1.1–1.9 m æ s 87 pools (each, 3 m wide · 3 m long · 3 m high) interconnected by a vertical slot, which is 40 cm wide, with a mean hydraulic head of 19 cm per slot (junho 2004). in normal operation, the ﬂow through the )1 and the energy dissipation rate is ladder is 1.5 m3 æ s )3. an auxiliary water ﬂow system (up to 145 w æ m )1) exits at the ladder entrance to attract ﬁsh 6 m3 æ s (junho 2004). a counting window made of transparent acrylic, 1.5-m high and 1.0-m wide, placed near the exit of the ladder allowed visual counts of ﬁsh that successfully passed upstream in the ladder. in front of the counting window, the ﬂume was narrowed to force ﬁsh to pass near the window so all ﬁshes could be detected. video monitoring of ﬁsh )1, 7 day week fishes were recorded moving upstream past the ifl window using a sanyo vcc-4594 camera (sanyo, san diego, ca, usa) coupled to a time-lapse video cassette recorder sony svt-lc300 (sony brasil, )1. manaus, brazil) running 24 h day an infrared lamp (chill chaser deluxe, infrared and heatlamp, ge) was installed facing the window to observe ﬁsh passing at night (hiebert et al. 2000). the time-lapse video cassette recorder was set to allow a regular vhs tape of 2 h to record up to 102 h. the camera was positioned so all ﬁshes passing from the top to the bottom of the water column were viewed. fishes passing from 1 june 2003 to 31 may 2004 were recorded. video recording was not performed when the ifl was not operating, which occurred 38 days scattered throughout the study. the exceptionally clear water allowed identiﬁcation and counting of ﬁshes during the entire year except during 1 day (18 february 2004) due to high water turbidity caused by heavy rains. video tapes were observed using a video cassette recorder and a kv21s85 color sony tv set (sony brasil, manaus, brazil). fish images were viewed by trained ﬁsh biologists who identiﬁed, counted, and recorded the time and date of passage for each ﬁsh on all video tapes. occasionally, ﬁsh would swim back and forth in front of the window before passing upstream, and in those cases, care was taken to avoid recounting. the small numbers of ﬁsh observed moving downstream were not counted. the year of analysis of ﬁsh counts the analyses were performed for all species, except leporinus elongatus. seasonal variation of passage was analysed using monthly ﬁsh counts. fish counts upstream ﬁsh passage in igarapava fish ladder (a) 48 00’ igarapava dam 20 00’ jaguara dam 20 km volta grande dam (b) (c) (d) pp ir * fig. 1.

ﬁshway by different taxa. variation in diel time of passage (day vs. night) using ﬁsh counts at each hour of the 24-h day was examined. civil twilight, which is deﬁned as beginning in the morning and ending in the evening when the centre of the sun is geometrically 6° below the horizon (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/rst_ defs.php accessed in september 2007), was used for the daytime period. the civil twilight for the ifl area is available at http://zenite.nu/ (accessed in september 2007). the daily number of ﬁsh that passed in each moon phase was determined by dividing the lunar cycle into four phases according to the percentage of illuminated area of the moon disc based on the ephemeris available at http://www.ﬁsica.ufmg.br/~astrof/docs/efemerides/ efemerides.html (accessed in september 2007). the relationship between daily ﬁsh counts, daily rainfall, and mean daily discharge at igarapava dam (hereafter, dam discharge) was investigated by count- ing all ﬁshes. igarapava dam did not spill water during the study period; therefore, all river ﬂow downstream of the dam attracting ﬁsh was from the power plant. data on rainfall (measured 46 km upstream at jaguara dam) and igarapava dam discharge were provided by cemig (minas gerais state power company). the effect of water temperature on ﬁsh counts h )1 was examined by grouping ﬁsh counts into ﬁve temperature classes: 16–18, 19–21, 22–24, 25–27, and 28–30 °c. water temperature was recorded every hour by a data logging thermometer (onset stow- away, onset computer, bourne, ma, usa) placed in the ladder at the viewing window during 19 september 2003–31 may 2004. data analyses null ﬁsh counts, which included structural and random null counts, were excluded from all analyses related to moon phase, rainfall, dam discharge, and water tem- perature following andersen (1997). structural null counts (counts with expected value = 0) did not belong to the phenomena under study and were excluded. random null counts (counts where the expected value was >0, but the observed value was zero) did belong to the phenomena and should not be excluded. however, it was not possible to use objective criteria to distinguish between structural and random null counts in order to exclude only the former. this problem was solved by excluding all null counts from the analyses. the inﬂuence of moon phase, rainfall, dam dis- charge, and water temperature on ﬁsh counts (regard- less of ﬁsh species) was tested using nonparametric tests because variables were not normally distributed 463 bizzotto et al. even after data transformation (sokal & rohlf 1995). kruskal–wallis test was used to test the inﬂuence of the four moon phases and ﬁve classes of water temperature on ﬁsh counts followed by the nonpara- metric tukey-type test modiﬁed by dumm (zar 1999). spearman coefﬁcient of correlation was used to examine the inﬂuence of rainfall and dam discharge on ﬁsh counts. the inﬂuence of each environmental factor on ﬁsh counts for each taxon was analysed using effect size. effect size is a term used for a family of indices that measure the degree to which the phenomenon under study is present in the population (cohen 1988). it also denotes the degree to which a null hypothesis is false (cohen 1992). the effect size was determined in the present study following cohen (1988). thus, the g effect size of season (wet vs. dry) and diel (day vs. night) was calculated according to the test that a proportion is 0.50. pearson coefﬁcient of correlation (r) was used as a measure of effect size of rainfall and )1. anova was dam discharge on number of ﬁsh day used to measure the f effect size of moon phase on )1. anova was also used to number of ﬁsh day measure the f of water temperature on number of )1. the effect size was classiﬁed according to ﬁsh h (g, r, and f = 0.0), small cohen (1988) as null (g = 0.05, f = 0.10), medium and (g = 0.15, large (g = 0.25, r = 0.50, and f = 0.40). leporinus elonga- tus was excluded from these analyses because only two ﬁsh were registered at the ifl viewing window during the period of study. r = 0.10, r = 0.30, and f = 0.25), and sas (1999) was used for statistical tests and to calculate g and r. a speciﬁc algorithm was written in sas for the nonparametric tukey-type test. borenstein & cohen (1988) was used to calculate f. hierarchical inﬂuence of environmental factors scales: the inﬂuence of environmental factors on ﬁsh counts was classiﬁed according to the following hierarchical and multitemporal long-term inﬂuence (months), mid-term inﬂuence (days), and short-term inﬂuence (1 day or hours). season was classiﬁed as a long-term inﬂuence, moon phase was classiﬁed as a mid-term inﬂuence, and all other environmental fac- tors were classiﬁed as a short-term inﬂuence. results taxa passing the ladder the ifl a total of 61,621 ﬁshes were counted at window, of which 93.5% were identiﬁed to genus or species belonging to 15 taxa (table 1). most of the ﬁshes (77.4%) belonged to migratory taxa, and the remaining (22.3%) belonged to nonmigratory taxa, which are thought not to migrate to any large extent (explanations about the categorisation of these groups are given in the discussion section). the main taxa of the migratory group were pimelodus maculatus (33.6% of all ﬁsh counted), leporinus octofasciatus (31.4%), leporinus friderici (4.5%), and prochilodus lineatus (3.1%). among the group of nonmigratory ﬁshes, bryconamericus stramineus (12.7% of all ﬁsh counted) was the most abundant. due to morpholog- ical similarities, individuals of astyanax, cichla, and hypostomus were only identiﬁed to genus. nonmigratory table 1. migratory and ﬁshes (n, %) passing the igarapava fish ladder in the wet season (october 2003–march

vono et al. 1997; v. vono, unpublished data), 13 species are listed as migratory and the remaining nonmigratory. however, a clear- cut categorisation is difﬁcult to make between migratory and nonmigratory ﬁshes because migratory behaviour has only been studied in some grande river ﬁshes. prochilodus lineatus, s. hilarii, p. mesopotamicus, and l. elongatus are among those long-distance migratory species that move up to 600 km from feeding to spawning grounds (godoy 1975; agostinho et al. 2003). all of these species were rare in the ifl, except for p. lineatus. other the same category that were rarely species of observed in the ifl during previous work, i.e., pseudoplatystoma corruscans, salminus brasiliensis, brycon orbignyanus, and zungaro jahu (v. vono unpublished data), were also not observed in this study. in addition to the 15 taxa observed in this study, other species may have passed because 6.5% of the ﬁshes recorded on the video tapes were not identiﬁed. the construction of the low abundance of long-distance migratory ﬁsh in the middle river grande was known even before ifl (braga & gomiero 1997; vono et al. 1997). the shortening of free-ﬂowing segments of the grande river due to hydroelectric dam constructions may account for this low abundance. the comparative higher abundance the upstream ﬁsh passage in igarapava fish ladder table 3. number of ﬁsh day)1 in each moon phase counted in the viewing window of the igarapava fish ladder, during 1 june 2003–31 may 2004. moon phase new first quarter full last quarter n 79 83 86 79 number of )1 (mean ﬁsh day ± standard error) 89.7 ± 8.6a 124.9 ± 11.8a,c 377.6 ± 62.1b 148.8 ± 16.3c n = number of days;

agostinho & ju´ lio 1999; agostinho et al. 2003, 2007b). pimelodus maculatus is the most abundant native ﬁsh in several brazilian reservoirs (agostinho et al. 2007b), including the volta grande reservoir (braga & gomiero 1997) and igarapava reservoir (v. vono, unpublished data). its widespread presence in different reservoirs sug- gests that it may not require a large free-ﬂowing river stretch upstream of the reservoir to spawn (agostinho et al. 2007b). leporinus octofasciatus has also been differently categorised in the literature (migratory: godoy 1975; nonmigratory: lamas 1993; agostinho & ju´ lio 1999). it is relatively abundant in the volta grande reservoir (braga & gomiero 1997), but it occurs as the dominant species in only one of 77 brazilian 2007b). although the species was clearly migratory in the ifl, further studies are needed to understand the migratory status of this ﬁsh. although less numerous recognised migratory species, some taxa not to be migratory, mainly b. stramineus and astyanax spp., were abundant in the ifl. large numbers of nonmigratory ﬁshes have also been detected in other neotropical ﬁshways (godinho et al. 1991; borghetti et al. 1994; oldani & baigu´ n 2002; fernandez et al. 2004; britto & sirol 2005; pompeu & martinez 2006). these are usually small-sized ﬁsh and may inhabit rivers (fernandez et al. 2004) in addition to reservoirs. in the northern hemisphere, many species of riverine ﬁshes migrate relatively short distances between habitats during their life history (lucas & baras 2001). an innate drive to move upstream at the appropriate time and during the appropriate condi- tions persists even after river damming, and the construction of a ﬁshway again allows these species to move to upstream habitats. this is the likely explanation for ‘nonmigratory’ using the ifl. that is, their innate migratory drives were previously not apparent due to the presence of the barriers and this than the thought 467 fig. 3. diel passage of the ﬁve most abundant ﬁshes counted in the viewing window of the igarapava fish ladder, from 1 june 2003 to 31 may 2004. of p. lineatus might have resulted from re-stocking programmes conducted in the area since the early 1980s. bizzotto et al. )1 (mean ± standard error) in each moon fig. 4. number of ﬁsh day phase of the ﬁve most abundant ﬁshes counted in the viewing window of the igarapava fish ladder, from 1 june 2003 to 31 may 2004. 468 table 4. number of ﬁsh h)1 at different classes of water temperatures counted in the viewing window of the igarapava fish ladder, during 19 september 2003–31 may 2004. water temperature (°c) 16–18 19–21 22–24 25–27 28–30 n 101 213 738 2,735 528 number of ﬁsh h ± standard error) )1 (mean 3.4 ± 0.2a 4.8 ± 0.3ª 8.5 ± 0.4b 12.7 ± 0.6c 19.6 ± 2.4c n = number of observations; different superscripts in the column indicate signiﬁcant differences (p £ 0.05; kruskal–wallis test followed by dunn test). study suggests they should be considered migratory species. seasonal inﬂuence most ﬁshes (circa 78%) passed the ifl during the wet season, which is the spawning season of many ﬁshes in southeastern brazil (agostinho et al. 2003; sato & godinho 2003). a similar pattern has been observed in a ﬁsh ladder in the upper parana´ river (fernandez et al. 2007a). many of the migrants in the ifl during this period had maturing or mature gonads (maia et al. 2007, v. vono, unpublished data), suggesting that upstream migration occurred to access spawning grounds. conversely, during the dry season, most ﬁsh were not reproductively mature (v. vono, unpublished data); thus, migration was likely for dispersal, forag- ing, or staging for future spawning. diel passage for the ifl allowed ﬁsh with any pattern of diel movement to enter and pass around the dam. nocturnal passage was the dominant behaviour the siluriformes hypostomus spp. and p. maculatus, and diurnal passage was dominant for the characiformes astyanax spp., b. stramineus, m. maculatus, and l. octofasciatus and the perciformes cichla spp. similarly, pompeu & martinez (2006) determined that siluriformes passed at night whereas fernandez et al. (2007b) found that characiformes tended to pass during the day. although l. friderici and p. lineatus passed in larger numbers during the day, their nocturnal passage was also strong, which suggests a dualistic type of behaviour. lunar inﬂuence association of ﬁsh migration and spawning with moon phase has been described in tropical freshwater ﬁshes. in the pilcomayo river, in bolivia and argentina, the number of the upstream migrant prochilodus platensis upstream ﬁsh passage in igarapava fish ladder (=p. lineatus) signiﬁcantly increases during the full moon (bayley 1973). in the brazilian pantanal region, migration of ﬁshes that leave the ﬂoodplain lakes to enter the main rivers occurs in april–june during a full moon (petrere 1989). also, the spawning migration of white ﬁshes (e.g., cirrhinus auratus, osteochilus hasselti, pangasius sutchi, and others) in the mekong river, southeast asia, is strongly inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst quarter to full moon (welcomme 1985). thus, different from marine ﬁshes, in which migration may occur in various moon phases (takemura et al. 2004), the literature indicates that tropical freshwater ﬁshes tend to migrate in periods of the greatest moon illumination. some ﬁshes using the ifl followed this pattern. locomotor activity is likely mediated by rhythmic production of melatonin (lo´ pez-olmeda et al. 2006). to our knowledge, melatonin production has not been studied in any neotropical ﬁsh. considering that p. maculatus, a nocturnal ﬁsh, increased locomotion activity during full moon (this study), a possible synchronisation of melatonin production to moon phases should be investigated in this ﬁsh. pimelodus maculatus, having proportionally large eyes, as is the characteristic of visually oriented ﬁsh, may take advantage moving at night in the clear waters of the grande river during full moon. this hypothesis is reinforced by the fact the moon phase did not inﬂuence the number of p. maculatus lifted by the funil fish lift, which is also located in grande river, but in a stretch of highly turbid waters (a. godinho, unpublished data). for the various diurnal ﬁshes of the grande river, there are no obvious reasons to synchronise their daytime movements with the full moon. inﬂuence of rainfall and dam discharge migration and spawning of riverine neotropical ﬁshes have been related to changes in river discharge due to rainfall (godinho et al. 2007). however, this seems not to be the case at the ifl because the passage of only a few taxa was moderately to strongly inﬂuenced by either dam discharge or rainfall. the reason for this result might be related to the highly regulated discharge at igarapava dam that dampens the range of discharge and the fairly small catchment area of the reservoir to drastically change dam discharge. it will take more research to determine if there is a relationship between ﬁsh passage and river ﬂow. that does not collect enough water inﬂuence of water temperature water temperature variation likely induced signiﬁcant changes in the number of ﬁsh passed. most ﬁshes passed when the temperature was ‡25 °c. at £21 °c, 469 )1 (mean ± standard error) at classes of fig. 5. number of ﬁsh h water temperatures of the ﬁve most abundant ﬁshes counted in the viewing window of the igarapava fish ladder, from 19 september 2003 to 31 may 2004. bizzotto et al. the passage of ﬁshes was greatly reduced. fernandez et al. (2007a) also found a clear pattern of seasonality for temperature in a ﬁsh ladder at the upper parana river. the passage of l. friderici and l. octofasciatus closely paralleled the increases in water temperature with the peak passage of these anostomid ﬁshes, coinciding with the highest water temperature. greater captures of ﬁsh in the volta grande reservoir (braga 2001) were associated with high temperature, appar- ently indicating a positive correlation between ﬁsh activity and water temperature. hierarchical inﬂuence of environmental factors in general, the long-term inﬂuence of season strongly determined the passage of most taxa, and within the preferred season, the passage of some taxa markedly peaked during the day and others at night. for some taxa, a third environmental factor (moon phase) also played an important role in determining passage. only three taxa (pimelodus maculatus, p. mesopotamicus, and s. nasutus) did not follow this pattern because they were primarily inﬂuenced by other short-term environmental factors. management and conservation implications video monitoring enabled the identiﬁcation of most ﬁsh to species or genus and allowed the study of the various passage patterns at the ifl. all results indicate that the ifl should operate in both seasons (dry and wet) and for 24 h each day to allow passage of the diverse ﬁshes that greatly differ in passage patterns. fishways in brazil have always aroused discussion among scientists about the appropriate role of ﬁsh passage in ﬁsh conservation and management, and this discussion continues (pelicice & agostinho 2008; godinho & kynard in press). recently, a south american international symposium on ﬁshways demonstrated that many important issues are still controversial or have not been addressed (editors 2007). to the present there is a widespread concept in brazil that ﬁshways are needed only to facilitate upstream spawning migrations. however, upstream ﬁshways provide pas- sage for other ﬁsh migrations, such as foraging, as found in this study. thus, all up- and downstream migrations during life history need to be addressed at dams to conserve ﬁsh resources (godinho & kynard in press). the ifl does not play a speciﬁc function of reconnecting fragmented populations of long-distance migratory species, as the limited catchment basin of the igarapava reservoir does not offer spawning and ⁄ or nursery grounds for these species. on the other hand, it has established a source (volta grande reservoir) and sink (igarapava reservoir) system by which local 470 extinctions have been avoided and a renewable ﬁsh- eries resource established in the sink habitat (godinho & kynard in press). in this scenario, ifl operational protocols should provide regulations to monitor and maintain downstream migrant stocks at volta grande reservoir. this study has shown that sampling a brazilian ﬁshway to monitor passage is complex and can produce many unexpected results. in order to have representative samples, any sampling design needs to incorporate seasonal, diel, moon phase, as well as dam discharge and temperature monitoring. studies on ﬁsh ladder usage in brazil frequently dewater, use cast nets, or apply other invasive techniques to sample the ﬁsh (e.g., godinho et al. 1991; borghetti et al. 1994; britto & sirol 2005; agostinho et al. 2007a). these techniques likely only give a snapshot of ﬁsh use of the ﬁshway, and most likely, the sampling is highly biased both for species presence and abundance. video observations of migrant ﬁshes not only has advantages (e.g., low cost, noninvasive technique), but also has disadvantages (e.g., turbidity makes it difﬁcult to see ﬁsh and small ﬁsh can be hard to identify). thus, the only way to minimise selectivity of the sampling technique would be the simultaneous use of different independent methods. the identiﬁcation of environ- mental factors that inﬂuence ifl usage in this study have direct implications for: management of the ifl, selecting ﬁshways for other rivers, and providing a better identiﬁcation of the suite of migratory taxa and their migratory patterns that seek upstream passage in the grande river. acknowledgements we thank igarapava hydroelectric consortium for allowing us to collect data at the igarapava fish ladder; to the staff of igarapava dam for their willing help; to v. c. amorim
