bark, williams, & knights, 2007; daverat et al., 2005; feunteun, 2002; iglesias & lobón- cerviá, 2012; laffaille et al., 2003; vøllestad & jonsson, 1986). in ireland, eels were formerly the focus of important commercial fisheries, but more recent- ly, due to widespread population decline, large- scale conservation pro- grammes have become a priority research action (mccarthy, 2014). on the irish river shannon, commercial exploitation of resident yellow eels and migratory silver eels occurred throughout the catchment, and both life history stages have been intensively researched there (arai, kotake, & mccarthy, 2006; macnamara & mccarthy, 2012; mccarthy & cullen, 2000; mccarthy, cullen, & o’conner, 1999; yokouchi et al., 2009). in 2009, ireland’s eel management plan specified closure of the river shannon eel fishery and development of a silver eel ‘trap and transport’ conservation programme to mitigate for the adverse impact of hydro- power regulation near the tidal limit (macnamara & mccarthy, 2014). at lough sheelin, a moderate sized lowland lake located in the upper river shannon catchment, the yellow and silver eel populations have been monitored since 1993 and a valuable time series of eel biological data is available. in this study, we present minimum production estimates from lough sheelin, analyse the population changes in terms of abundance (yellow eel) and size structure (silver eel) in the lake over this period and determine whether these two distinct indices can be alternatively used for stock monitoring purposes. 2 |  material and methods 2.1 | study area the river shannon is ireland’s largest river (18,000 km2 catch- ment area, 186 m3/s mean annual discharge;

kelly et al., 2012; kerins, monahan, & champ, 2007; toner et al., 2005). the lake’s fish assemblage includes the following: brown_trout (salmo_trutta), perch (perca fluviatilis), roach (rutilus rutilus), pike (esox lucius), tench (tinca tinca), three- spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus), nine- spined stickleback (pungitius pungitius), bream (abramis brama) and european eel (anguilla anguilla). 2.2 | monitoring and sampling until 2008, commercial yellow eel fishing in the lake took place using longlines and fyke nets. between 1993 and 2008, a series of stand- ardised longline surveys were undertaken in summer. the survey protocol involved setting an earthworm- baited (lumbricidae) longline (680–1,000 hooks, 1,360–2,000 m length) on one night annually (dusk to dawn). the catch per unit effort (cpue) is expressed as the number of yellow eels captured per 100 hooks. lines were bottom set (1 m snood length), and during line lifting an onboard scientific observer noted which hooks caught eels. further details of this sam- pling technique are provided by mccarthy, cullen, & o’connor (1999) and yokouchi et al. (2009). in this study, eel life stage was determined based on the capture method (i.e. longline for yellow eels and stow net for silver eels) and by visual examination (coloration and eye size). fishing for seaward- migrating silver eels on the upper shannon is traditionally undertak- en in late autumn (mccarthy & cullen, 2000; mccarthy, cullen, & o’connor, 1999). at the outlet of lough sheelin, this involved the use of winged stow nets set in the river inny immediately downstream of the lake outlet (6 m3/s mean annual discharge). in selected years between 1993 and 2014, representative samples of the catch were measured (to the nearest mm) during these short peak migration events, ensur- ing that potential bias due to seasonal variation in eel size (e.g. durif & elie, 2008; macnamara & mccarthy, 2014) was minimised. silver eel migration in upper shannon tributaries, such as the river inny, is strongly affected by variation in lake levels, and lake- outlet fishing site figure 1 river shannon catchment with the lough sheelin and killaloe eel fishing sites indicated macnamara et al.604  |     catches reflect the associated increase in discharge. the underlying lunar monthly cycle, typically involving three migration events at such sites, is reflected in catch patterns. however, the relative size of the lunar dark- phase peak is influenced by within and between year pat- terns of rainfall and river discharge (fig. 2). in the lower river shannon, peak migration is typically late in the season and frequently an extended high discharge winter pattern (i.e. due to hydropower regulation) over- rides the tendency of eels to migrate during monthly lunar dark peri- ods. the interactions of environmental factors affecting catch patterns at the important lower catchment research site killaloe eel fishing weir (cullen & mccarthy, 2003) are thus more complex that those noted upstream at lough sheelin (fig. 2). a catch depletion experiment, which involved fishing an extra net behind the primary fishing net, was undertaken in 2014 to evalu- ate the efficiency of the silver eel stow nets at the lake outlet (which had remained consistent between 2009 and 2014) so as to esti- mate production from lough sheelin. as required by ireland’s emp, a conservation silver eel fishery is operated at this and other river shannon sites and all catches are transported overland for release downstream of the hydropower dams in the lower river shannon (i.e. ‘trap and transport’). this is carried out to partly mitigate for mortalities associated with turbine passage. 2.3 | statistical analysis differences in eel length between years were tested using a kruskal– wallis test, with post-hoc pairwise mann-whitney tests (applying bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons). differences in abundance were tested with a χ2 test. regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between mean silver eel size and catch per unit effort (cpue long lines) over the time series. 3 |  results 3.1 | production estimates over a four- day period in 2014, multiple nets were fished at the out- let of lough sheelin. the depletion experiment which was used to obtained efficiency of the silver eel stow net was as follows: day 1 resulted in a capture efficiency of 90% (net 1 = 18 kg, net 2 = 2 kg), day 2; 73% (net 1 = 22 kg, net 2 = 8 kg), day 3; 80% (net 1 = 32 kg, net 2 = 8 kg), day 4; 97% (net 1 = 34 kg, net 2 = 1 kg). mean net effi- ciency of 85% was subsequently used for the estimation of produc- tion (kg/ha) from full season catch data in 2009–2014. silver eel production from lough sheelin was estimated based on catch data and the efficiency of fishing nets at the outlet site. to facilitate comparisons with other studies, annual silver eel production from lough sheelin from 2009 to 2014 was expressed in terms of lake wetted area (1,855 ha). based on these catch data, production from lough sheelin for the period 2009–2014 ranged between 0.79 and 1.84 kg/ha (table 1). 3.2 | yellow eels in 1993 longline surveys were undertaken in 8 years during 1993– 2008. as indicated in fig. 3a, yellow eel cpue in the lake was considerably higher (62.1 eels/100 hooks) and 1997 (52.2 eels/100 hooks) than 2002–2008 (mean ± standard devia- tion = 10.3 ± 6.2 eels/100 hooks), when surveys were undertaken annually (except in 2006). despite the variable cpue recorded during 2002–2008 (1.9–15.8 eels/100 hooks), the values are still less than a third of those recorded in the 1990s and a significant negative decline was observed over time (r2 = .80 p < .05). figure 2 silver eel catches at an upper catchment site (lough sheelin) in comparison with lower catchment site (killaloe) in 2009 and 2010. solid line denotes discharge, dashed line denotes lunar illumination and solid bars denote nightly catch macnamara et al.3.3 | silver eel silver eel size monitoring was undertaken over 11 years during 1993–2014. in each year, male silver eels (i.e. those <430 mm in body length; macnamara & mccarthy, 2012, 2014) constituted <2.5% of the catch and were therefore excluded from the analysis. the mean female silver eel body length increased significantly (k–w test, df = 10, p < .001), from 659 ± 56 mm in 1993 to 825 ± 64 mm in 2011. post hoc pairwise comparisons between all years are shown in fig. 3a, with significant differences (all p < .01) indicated by different letters. the shift in female silver eel size structure is further illustrated in fig. 3b, where body length frequency distributions for four selected years (1993, 2005, 2011 and 2014) during the time series are given. table 1 full season silver eel catch (kg) and minimum production estimates (kg/ha) from lough sheelin 2009–2014.

rosell, evans, & allen, 2005). robust estimates of silver eel production from across europe are sparse and vary considerably between locations and habi- tat types. reported production estimates in rivers, lakes, coastal catchments and tidal lagoons varied from; 2.27 kg/ha (vøllestad & jonsson, 1986); ~6 kg/ha (bilotta, sibley, hateley, & don, 2011); 2.4–6.3 and 4.7–26.8 kg/ha (acou, gaelle, feunteun, & laffaille, 2009); 30–34 kg/ha (amilhat et al., 2008); 13.2 kg/ha (charrier et al., 2012); 4.42 kg/ha (derouiche, habbechi, kraïem, & elie, 2015); and 3.5–9.1 kg/ha (cucherousset et al., 2007). thus, pro- duction estimates can differ significantly and examples from previous studies suggest that they change depending on habitat type and pro- ductivity of systems. the importance for reproductive contribution of eels produced from a waterbody based on body size is also important to note (macnamara & mccarthy, 2014). in this regard, lough sheelin compares favourably with productive irish waterbodies and represents an important source of spawners, producing large female silver eels. eel catch time series data often span different spatial and/or tem- poral scales (e.g. de lafontaine, gagnon, & côté, 2010), making inter- pretation of abundances difficult. however, the yellow eel cpue data for lough sheelin provides a historical index of eel abundance from a single location, using a standardised sampling protocol. yellow eel abundance in the lake decreased markedly between the 1990s and 2002–2008 (fig. 3a). various environmental changes have occurred on the river shannon during this period, and lough sheelin in particu- lar has been under considerable pressure from eutrophication (kerins, monahan, & champ, 2007; millane, kelly-quinn, & champ 2008). however, nutrient enrichment may potentially be beneficial for eel production (e.g. andersson, florin, & petersson, 2012; bark, williams, & knights, 2007). a decrease in the total phosphorus loadings to the lake between 1988 and 2005 has been observed, suggesting that the phosphorus losses from the catchment are slowly declining (kerins, monahan, & champ, 2007). it is plausible that the introduction of zebra mussels may also have affected fish populations within the lake (nalepa & schloesser, 1992). the effect that an introduction of this nature could have on lacustrine dynamics (e.g. by altering food supply and habitat quality; see macisaac, 1996) cannot be discounted as a factor affecting eel growth and abundance within the lake. however, the most probable explanation for changes in abundance in lough sheelin in recent decades is that of juvenile recruitment dynamics on the river shannon. due to hydropower regulation of the lower catch- ment, recruitment upstream of the hydropower structures is depen- dent on stocking (macnamara & mccarthy, 2014; mccarthy, cullen, & o’connor, 1999; quigley & o’brien, 1996). a detailed account of the number of juvenile eels stocked to lough sheelin is given by quigley & o’brien (1996): approximately 10.7 million eels were stocked between 1968 and 1978, and an additional 0.9 million and 0.2 million eels were stocked in 1982 and 1986 respectively. these eels (11.8 million) repre- sent 17.1% of the total eels (201.6 million) stocked to the entire catch- ment during this period (quigley & o’brien, 1996). however, between 1987 and 2008, stocking decreased dramatically due to the collapse in recruitment to the river; the mean number of eels stocked to the entire catchment was ~0.6 million annually (macnamara & mccarthy, 2014). the majority of these were released immediately above the hydropow- er structures and allowed to disperse naturally throughout the catch- ment. eel age data for lough sheelin and similar upper shannon lakes (arai, kotake, & mccarthy, 2006; mccarthy, cullen, & o’connor, 1999; yokouchi et al., 2009) suggest that the eels stocked directly to the lake (i.e. in 1968–1978, 1982 and 1986) would have matured and migrated prior to the 2002–2008 surveys, and the natural dispersion of juvenile eels from the lower catchment post- 1986 appears insufficient to main- tain the previously recorded high abundance levels in lough sheelin. direct assessment of eel population parameters in a waterbody is not always possible. interannual variation in silver eel size struc- ture has been shown to be an indicator of the population status (de lafontaine, gagnon, & cote, 2010). closure of the irish eel fishery stopped the continuation of longline surveys as a monitoring tech- nique (i.e. considered a destructive sampling approach), so yellow eel surveys were not undertaken in recent years. even though only four corresponding yellow and silver eel data points are available, there appears to be a link between yellow eel abundance and female silver eel size at lough sheelin: yellow eels were significantly more abundant in 1993 / 1997 compared to 2005, whereas female silver eels were smaller in 1993 and 2005 than 2011 and 2014 (fig. 3b). as male silver eels were rare in lough sheelin (comprising 0–2.5% of eels sampled in each year), the observed population structure changes are not related to sex ratio shifts, as reported in some other irish rivers (e.g. parsons, vickers, & warden, 1977; poole, reynolds, & moriarty, 1990). we hypothesise that density- dependant processes associated with low- ered abundance (e.g. increased prey and habitat availability, reduced competition) may have allowed silver eels attain greater sizes prior to migration, as illustrated for the year’s post- 2005 in fig. 3a and fig. 3b. future monitoring of this site, or comparable data from elsewhere, will be needed to definitively validate this hypothesis. on the saint lawrence river, decreases in various american eel anguilla rostrata (lesueur) abundance and recruitment indices have occurred concurrent with increases in silver eel size (de lafontaine, gagnon, & cote, 2010). they reported that the mean body length of sil- ver eels increased by 13.7% (from 818 mm to 930 mm) between 1995 and 2007. likewise, the mean body weight of a. anguilla silver eels increased from 0.6 kg to ~1 kg (1960s to late 1990s) and from 0.4 kg to 0.8 kg (1960s to 2000s) in the pound net fishery along the eastern and southern swedish coast (andersson, florin, & petersson, 2012). in the swedish river ätran, the mean body length of silver eels was esti- mated to have increased by 25.6%, from 617 mm during 1957–1966 to 775 mm during 1997–2006 (calles et al., 2010). these studies put the extent of the lough sheelin observations in context, where the mean body length of silver eels has increased by 27.2% (659–838 mm) in less than two decades. in addition to being of considerable biological interest, changes in eel size structure also have important conservation considerations in terms of fecundity/reproductive output (macnamara & mccarthy, 2012, 2014) and increasing susceptibility to hydropower passage mortality (calles et al., 2010). direct assessment of changes in yellow eel abundance is increas- ingly difficult in ireland, due to fishery closure and other restrictions macnamara et al.associated with regional eel management plans. likewise, quantitative estimates of silver eel numbers and biomass generally require more substantial monitoring and research programmes (e.g. bilotta, sibley, hateley, & don, 2011; macnamara & mccarthy, 2014; mccarthy et al., 2014). on lough sheelin, development of the ‘trap and trans- port’ conservation fishery (macnamara & mccarthy, 2014) provided an effective platform for continuation of the silver eel time series. this case study therefore provides upper catchment perspectives that complement the long- term studies on the lower river shannon, but also exhibits the potential for monitoring long- term changes in size structure as a cost- effective eel monitoring technique. if temporal changes at other sites parallel the results on lough sheelin, silver eel size structure could potentially act as a proxy of yellow eel abundance. hence, analyses of silver eel size structure obtained from traditional capture sampling, or by alternative technologies such as multibeam sonar (e.g. bilotta, sibley, hateley, & don, 2011; mccarthy et al., 2014), could be used more widely in future. acknowledgements this study was funded by esb energy international. the assistance provided by national university of ireland galway colleagues, espe- cially d nowak, a bateman and m blaszkowski, who have participated in the eel monitoring programme since 1993 and the fishing crews is greatly appreciated. references acou, a., gaelle, g., feunteun, e., & laffaille, p.
