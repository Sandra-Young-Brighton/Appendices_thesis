(2011) estimated that <1% of the total area of this region could be classified as perennial aquatic habitat. not surprisingly, this annual wetting and drying exerts a dominant influence on the ecol- ogy of the region’s rivers (king, townsend, douglas, & kennard, 2015; warfe et al., 2011). intermittent rivers are comprised of flowing, nonflowing and dry patches with dynamically varying levels of connectivity and habitat suitability for a range of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms (datry, arscott, & sabater, 2011; datry, pella, leigh, bonada, & hugueny, 2016). larned et al. (2010) suggested that patch formation associ- ated with flow cessation is a critical feature of intermittent rivers and that dry season aquatic refugia assume great importance within the 78  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:78–88. © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdpusey et al. intermittent river landscape. the processes and factors responsible for determining community assembly within such refugial aquatic habitats are varied and include assortment according to habitat struc- ture (beesley & prince, 2010; magoulick, 2000), prior dispersal (davey & kelly, 2007), recruitment (alkins- koo, 2000), resource availability (e.g. food and refuge) and interspecific interactions, including com- petition and predation (which may also include predation on aquatic organisms by terrestrial predators) (magoulik, 2000) and tolerance of poor water quality (strauch, kapust, & jost, 2015), among others. collectively, these factors regulate emigration/immigration rates, dry season persistence and consequent rates of local extinction (perry & bond, 2009; taylor & warren, 2001). antecedent flow conditions and groundwater inputs modify and determine the strength and direction of these interactions given their influence on size, longevity and acces- sibility of dry season refugia (arthington, balcombe, wilson, thoms, & marshall, 2005; arthington, olden, balcombe, & thoms, 2010). fish are an important component of the fauna present in intermit- tent rivers, and studies of the influence of flow intermittency have included those comparing community regulation across many loca- tions (i.e. space for time substitution) as well as those focussed on the dynamics over extended time within fewer locations (see magoulick, 2000; matthews & marsh- matthews, 2003). as part of a larger study on the environmental water requirements of freshwater fishes of the perennial daly river in northern australia (see chan et al., 2012; jackson et al., 2014; linke et al., 2012; stewart- koster et al., 2011), we sampled a range of locations biannually for up to 10 years. water resource use in this river is most likely to impact on the dry season flow regime of the perennial main channel and the study accordingly focussed on sites located in this part of the basin (chan et al., 2012). however, one site within an intermittent river tributary (fergusson river) was also included. the present study concerns the dynamics of the fish assemblage in this intermittent river over a 7- year period. given the widespread prevalence of intermittent streams and rivers across northern australia, insights gained from an examination of the ecology and dynamics of fish communities in this intermittent river may be applicable over a large spatial extent and provide guid- ance in assessments of the impacts of water resource development. we aimed to determine whether the fish fauna in the intermittent fergusson river was distinctive or a subset of that occurring within the perennial main channel of the daly river and the broader northern australian region. we deemed this an important first step in order to assess how spatially applicable were the results of the present study. moreover, stewart- koster et al. (2011) showed that temporal changes in abundance of some species in the perennial main channel of the daly river were not independent of processes occurring within intermittent tributaries of this drainage. thus, the development of a nuanced understanding of ecohydrological relationships across the broader hydrological spectrum and drainage network is needed when determining environmental water requirements within particular loca- tions within that network. second, we aimed to describe changes in assemblage structure during the dry season and by reference to infor- mation on the abundance of individual fish species, particularly those of a piscivorous habit, and to changes in population size structure of common fish species, to identify the processes most likely responsible for determining fish assemblage structure during this period.     |  79 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area the fergusson river is a major tributary of the daly river in the northern territory of northern australia (figure 1). the dominant land- scape in the catchment is open savannah forest (eucalyptus tetradonta and eucalyptus miniata) over highly weathered and leached, nutrient- poor, shallow soils. upstream of its confluence with the perennial groundwater- fed edith river, flow is seasonally highly intermittent (kennard et al., 2010). annual discharge (gauge g8140008, immedi- ately upstream of the study site), estimated over the 2006–2013 study period, averaged 7.85 (±1.20 [se]) × 106 ml and ranged from 5.02 × 106 ml in 2010 to 13.46 × 106 ml in 2011. one or two major wet season floods interspersed with several smaller flow pulses occurred every year between december and april (figure 2). flow typically ceased between late june and august (figure 2), depending on the size and timing of the antecedent floods. the average duration of the zero flow period was 105 days over this same period, ranging from 71 days in 2011 after the highest preceding wet season discharge to 170 days in 2010 after the lowest preceding wet season discharge. the available aquatic habitat contracted back to isolated pools during this period. the flow regime of the daly river is similarly seasonal but more predictable and further differs in that flow remains elevated throughout the dry season due to significant groundwater input (kennard et al. 2010). a study site consisting of a single riffle/run/pool sequence 200 m length and 16 m mean wetted width was established in the upper fergusson river (figure 1). the upstream catchment area of the river at this point is approximately 1,686 km2. the fish assemblage was sampled twice yearly (early and late dry season) over the period 2006– 2012, inclusive. the early dry season sampling occasion occurred in june or july (mean julian date—180 days [29th june]) just prior to the cessation of stream flow, and the late dry season occasion occurred in late september or october (mean julian date—287 days [14th october]) (table 1). movement by fish into and out of the study site was still possible in the early dry season period in all years of the study. 2.2 | sampling protocol fishes were sampled by backpack electrofishing as described in kennard et al. (2011). in short, multiple (average number of shots = 13 and 8 for the early and late dry season occasion respectively), 5- min (elapsed time) electrofishing shots were undertaken within the study site. fish were immediately dip- netted from the water and placed in a holding tank. at the end of each 5- min electrofishing shot, fish were identified and counted and the [standard length (sl) in mm] of each fish collected (up to a maximum of 30 individuals per species per sampling occasion) was recorded. fish were returned alive to the approximate point of capture after completion of sampling within each of the riffle or pool components of the study site. catch data were converted to catch 80  |     pusey et al. figure 1 the daly river catchment in the northern territory. the location of the study site (open circle) is shown as are sites located on the main stem of the daly river per unit effort (cpue—mean number collected per 5- min electrofishing shot). five replicate measures of depth and water velocity were taken for each shot. single measures of stream width, substrate composition (modified wentworth scale) and cover availability were taken for each shot. a full description of the methods employed in describing habitat structure is available in pusey, kennard, and arthington (2004). these data were used to generate average values for each parameter. 2.3 | analysis we compared the abundance of fishes in the fergusson river with that recorded for seven sites in the main channel of daly river sampled over the same period and frequency (b. j. pusey, m. j. kennard and m. douglas, unpublished data). species were ranked according to mean abundance (cpue), and a spearman rank correlation test was used to test whether ranked abundance was significantly related. we also assessed whether the species present in the fergusson river were widely distributed across northern australia by comparing ranked abundance within the fergusson river with ranked distribution extent across northern australia (kimberley region to cape york peninsula). we generated a measure of distribution extent by determining the number of basins in which each individual spe- cies has been recorded using data available in the northern australian freshwater fish atlas (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater/fishatlas/) described in pusey et al. (in press). species were then ranked according to the number of basins in which they had been recorded. intra- annual (early vs. late dry season) changes in species richness and abundance (mean cpue) were assessed by paired t test after trans- formation (log x + 1) to satisfy assumptions about normality. temporal (inter- and intra- annual) variation in assemblage structure was exam- ined by ordination (multidimensional scaling available in primer v6.1.11, primer e, plymouth, uk). abundance data were transformed (log x + 1) to downweigh the influence of abundant species, and the ordination (restricted to two dimensions) was performed on the sample- by- sample similarity matrix based on the bray–curtis measure. the anosim rou- tine in primer was used to test whether significant differences in assem- blage structure existed between early and late dry season samples. temporal changes in population size structure for abundant key species and for the entire

 results 3.1 | habitat structure intra- annual variation in aquatic habitat extent and structure was extreme. at the beginning of the dry season, just prior to cessation of flow, the sample reach consisted of a riffle, run and pool sequence. by the late dry season (mid- october), the dominant remaining aquatic habitat was a large refugial pool almost 1 m deep at its maximum with only a very small proportion of the study site classified as riffle (table 1). in essence, this small proportion of riffle habitat comprised the shared margin between habitat types and the very minor water movement recorded at this time was largely seepage from the pool. this progres- sion occurred in every year of the study. within each sampling period (i.e. early or late dry), interannual variation in habitat structure was con- trastingly minimal. that is, both the riffle/run and pool changed little year to year except in 2009 when the pool volume was greatly reduced. substratum composition was diverse but comprised a greater propor- tion of sand and fine gravel in the late dry season samples when the riffle/run component of the site was reduced. cover available to fishes was abundant on both early and late dry season sampling occasions     |  81 with temporal variation being related to mesohabitat differences in cover availability (i.e. presence of riffle). for example, filamentous alga and root masses were more abundant in the riffle/run section of the site, whereas woody debris and leaf litter were more abundant in the pool section. these changes in habitat structure with changes in flow were consistent across all years of study. physicochemical conditions remained adequate for fish health (pusey et al., 2004) on all sampling occasions throughout the study period (i.e. temperature <35°c, dis- solved oxygen >5 mg o2/l) (data not reported here). on all but one late dry season sampling occasion (october 2009, t8), the remaining area of refugial pool electrofished averaged 182 m in length, 16 m in width and 38 cm in depth. in october 2009, the area electrofished was greatly reduced to the extent that the pool itself was reduced in size to 21 m long, 7.9 m wide and 32 cm deep. it is worth noting that although the wet season discharge in this year was not the lowest over the period of study, the wet season flood was confined to a single peak event, as opposed to two floods (in 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2012). furthermore, the peak flood flow occurred slightly earlier (−6 julian days) than in all other years (average incidence = 25.8 julian days). moreover, the length of time between peak flows (either first or second peak in those years in which a second flood flow was recorded) and late dry season sampling in 2009 was the greatest over the period of study (301 days vs. an average of 215 days for all other years). 2009 was the only year over the period of study in which the refugial pool dried out completely prior to the onset of the next wet season. 3.2 | fish assemblage structure a total of 4,335 individuals from 20 species within 13 families were recorded from the fergusson river study reach (table 2). the species present in the fergusson river comprised a subset of the 41 species from 19 families recorded from the perennial main river channel of the daly river with none exclusively present in the fergusson. in gen- eral, abundant species in the main river channel were also abundant in the fergusson river (table 3) and ranked abundance was significantly correlated (rs = 0.508, p < 0.05) when only those species present in both rivers were included. although species were shared, the domi- nant species in the fergusson river (i.e. ranked <10) were much more abundant in the intermittent river than in the perennial river. for example, seven of the 10 most abundant species were at least three to four times more abundant in the fergusson river. craterocephalus stramineus, a riffle specialist, was the most abundant species recorded from the main river channel, but single individuals were recorded on two occasions only in the fergusson river. not only are the species present in the fergusson river widely distributed and abundant in the daly river, most are widespread at a regional scale. for example, 11 of the 19 species recorded from the fergusson river comprised the 10 most widely distributed species (note tied ranks in latter). early and late dry season samples were equally diverse (12.3 ± 0.6 [se] and 11.7 ± 1.3 species for early and late dry season samples respectively; paired t test = 0.691, p > 0.05). despite a twofold differ- ence in average abundance (21.9 ± 1.8 and 48.3 ± 12.4 fish per elec- trofishing shot for early and late dry season samples respectively), no 82  |     pusey et al. table 2 fish

paired t test = 2.316, p < 0.05). the total dry season abundance of potential prey species was not, how- ever, significantly correlated with piscivore abundance. rather, the relative abundance of the rainbowfish m. australis (the most abundant species present) was negatively correlated with the total abundance of these predators (log [x + 1]- transformed) (r = 0.862, p < 0.01). most of this effect was driven by the abundance of the mouth almighty g. aprion (r = 0.816, p < 0.01). although strong correlations between assemblage structure and the abundance of individual piscivore taxa were largely absent, the distribution of some late dry season samples in ordination space was correlated with an increased abundance of o. lineolata, s. kreffti and g. aprion (figure 3). moreover, the year in which predatory fish were absent (2010) is distributed well away from other late dry season samples in ordination space. the assemblage present at this time contained the least number of species recorded over the period of study and terapontid grunters made up much less of the total number of fishes present than at other times. recruitment from in situ reproduction was evident for both the early and late dry seasons. overall, and on both early and late dry sam- pling occasions, the fish assemblage present was dominated by fish <150 mm sl. fish smaller than 50 mm comprised a greater propor- tion of the sample from the late dry season than from the early dry season (65% vs. 48% respectively) (figure 4). a greater proportion of the populations of the terapontid grunters l. unicolor and hephaestus fuliginosus present in the early dry season were comprised of small individuals. in contrast, more small individuals of the terapontid a. per- coides, the melanotaenid m. australis and the goby glossogobius aureus were recorded in the late dry season samples. 4 |  discussion this study identified that the intermittent fergusson river contained a diverse assemblage of fishes, which comprised a subset of the fish fauna present in the perennial reaches of the daly river. this subset was com- posed of species widely distributed within the daly river (linke et al., 2012), extensively distributed across northern australia and character- istic of intermittent streams across the region (warfe et al., 2013). these 84  |     2 1.5 1 0.5 0 stress = 0.14 10 06 10 07 11 09 12 08 –0.5 12 –1 –1.5 –1.5 07 ma 06 na ne sk ap cs ol ga 11 08 09 early late –1 –0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 figure 3 mds ordination plot of fish assemblage structure in the early and late dry season. significant (p < 0.05) correlations of individual species with the distribution of samples in ordination space are shown. symbols are differentiated according to time of sampling (early vs. late dry season) and the year (2006–2012) in which the sample was collected. species abbreviations are as follows: ma, melanotaenia australis;

pusey & edward, 1990). the species considered here do not possess such physiological capacity, but do possess a range of eco- logical traits to cope with extreme hydrological intermittency such as high vagility, generalist feeding strategies, wide tolerance to a range of water quality extremes (e.g. water temperature, ph and dissolved oxygen con- centrations) and flexible life histories (pusey, arthington, stewart- koster, kennard, & read, 2010; pusey et al., 2004; sternberg & kennard, 2014). thus, although not intermittent stream specialists, the group of species recorded from the fergusson river form an assemblage characteristic of intermittent streams over a broad geographic range. dispersal between habitat patches is a key factor in the dynamics of metapopulations and metacommunities (larned et al., 2010) and espe- cially so in intermittent stream systems (warfe et al., 2013). changes in figure 4 cumulative frequency histograms illustrating population size structure for the entire assemblage and for six abundant species. sampling occasions are denoted by ● = early dry season and ○ = late dry season. sample sizes are given for each and are listed as early and late dry season samples respectively. note that the size ranges differ between species (i.e. x- axis) pusey et al. size structure between sampling occasions reported here suggest that fish do indeed disperse into the study site during the wet season, either from the perennial reaches of the edith and daly rivers downstream or from other dry season refugia located within the fergusson river. moreover, the high similarity in assemblage structure at the end of the wet season recorded over the 7- year study period suggests that dis- persal processes are themselves predictable or that the processes that structure fish assemblages after dispersal has occurred result in the for- mation of predictable assemblage structure. the onset in time of the wet season in northern australia is relatively predictable, although less so predictable are the magnitude and the number of floods (kennard et al. 2012). fish movement within drainages is strongly cued to this predict- able seasonal pulse in flow (bishop, pidgeon, & walden, 1995; jardine et al., 2011). warfe et al. (2013) reported that although dispersal by fishes into intermittent streams such as the fergusson river during the wet season is substantial, the ultimate determinate of fish assemblage structure in intermittent streams was not distance from the perennial dry season refuge but more a function of the requirements of individual species (i.e. their niche). assortment according to habitat structure, par- ticularly water velocity and depth, is likely an important determinant of assemblage structure in the present study as has been shown in numer- ous studies elsewhere (e.g. kennard, olden, arthington, pusey, & poff, 2007 and references therein). with the exception of extreme habitat contraction at the end of the 2009 dry season, there was little interan- nual variation in habitat structure. in all years, the early dry season reach consisted of a rocky riffle/run sequence, occupying the same portion of the larger channel, below a large pool with constant bathymetric char- acteristics. constancy of habitat structure resulted in little year- to- year variation in assemblage structure, notwithstanding that dispersal into and out of the study reach occurred and was likely substantial. species abundant in the main river are typically common in the fergusson river, but occur at higher levels of abundance. enhanced production during the wet phase in intermittent streams may support higher abundance of fish compared to perennial reaches. high inver- tebrate densities in the greatly expanded array of intermittent riffles and runs during the wet phase (douglas, townsend, & lake, 2003; garcia, dostine, humphries, douglas, & pusey, 2011) may provide abundant food for adult and juvenile macrophagous invertivores such as terapontid grunters (davis, pusey, & pearson, 2011) and plotosid catfishes (pusey et al., 2004). moreover, prolonged scour, increased turbidity and sediment deposition during the wet season in lower- order reaches of tropical australian rivers have been shown to result in reduced algal production (townsend & douglas, 2014), depressed invertebrate densities (douglas et al., 2003) and reduced food avail- ability for fishes (rayner, pusey, & pearson, 2008, 2009). garcia et al. (2015) recorded maximum periphyton chl a biomass (>1 μg/cm2), phy- toplankton chl a biomass (~3 μg/l) and macroinvertebrate biomass (~0.25 g/m2) during the early to mid- dry season in a year- long study of production dynamics in tributary streams of the daly river (which included the fergusson river). increased food availability, in real and relative terms, likely provides a powerful incentive for fishes to col- onise ephemeral habitats. increased phytoplankton production (and presumably consequent zooplankton blooms) in refugial pools provides     |  85 abundant food for microphagous invertivores such as melanotaenid rainbows, ambassid glassfish and gudgeons such as mogurnda. most dispersal into the study reach is likely ultimately related to reproduction, with patches of habitat within intermittent rivers provid- ing suitable habitat, while they last, for juvenile fishes. the increased proportional abundance of small h. fuliginosus and l. unicolor in the early dry season samples indicates spawning during the wet season, as has been reported elsewhere (pusey et al., 2004). moreover, in the case of the former species, spawning appears to be followed by emi- gration of mature individuals as almost no individuals >150 mm sl remain at the study site by the time of the late dry season sampling. the plotosid catfishes n. hyrtlii and neosilurus ater also make similar spawning migrations into and out of intermittent streams (pusey et al., 2004) and nearly all of the neosilurid catfishes recorded in the present study were juveniles (i.e. <150 mm sl). that is, all adult catfish and an unknown number of juvenile catfish had emigrated back to perma- nent waters by the time sampling commenced. the emigration of fish from intermittent streams such as the fergusson at the end of the wet season contributes to temporal variation in abundance and age struc- ture of many species in the main river channel. wet season flooding, which enables access to intermittent habitats and prolongation of the wet season, which in turn determine habitat suitability and extent in intermittent streams as well as the potential for egress as water levels drop, is correlated with the abundance of species such as h. fuliginosus in the main channel of the daly river (stewart- koster et al., 2011). in contrast, species such as m. australis, a. percoides and g. aureus recruited in the dry period during which the refugial pool was isolated. such a strategy may allow recruits to disperse widely and quickly after connectivity is reestablished with the onset of the wet season. moreover, larval development may be favoured at times of low, or in this case, no flow (humphries, king, & koehn, 1999; pusey, bird, close, & arthington, 2001). melanotaeniid rainbowfish have a very flexible reproductive behaviour, which allows them to take advantage of temporal variation in habitat at the landscape scale. in tributary systems elsewhere in northern australia, rainbowfishes have been shown to spawn during the dry sea- son and to grow and mature sufficiently rapidly to spawn upon resump- tion of stream flow, and on into the following dry season also (pusey et al., 2001). in contrast, in lowland systems, rainbowfish reproduce during the wet season coincident with flooding and expanded habitat availability (bishop, allen, pollard, & cook, 2001; pusey et al., 2004). this flexibil- ity ensures that at the population level, reproduction appears to occur year round (bishop et al., 2001). the influence of antecedent high flow events on reproduction varies greatly across the landscape depending on whether high flow events act as a disturbance or create newly expanded habitat suitable for rainbowfish recruitment (stewart- koster et al., 2011). the terapontid a. percoides has elsewhere been similarly shown to spawn during the dry season (pusey et al., 2004). across its wide range, this species is almost always sympatric with h. fuliginosus and l. unicolor and juveniles are frequently syntopic. temporal partitioning of spawning may alleviate competition between these species, the juveniles of which are morphologically and trophically similar (davis et al., 2011). the observation of dry season recruitment in g. aureus is the first published information from australia to support the notion 86  |     that this species is able to reproduce in freshwater, previously inferred only from its pattern of distribution (i.e. existence of landlocked populations). while early dry season assemblage structure varied little across the 7- year study, changes in assemblage structure as the dry season progressed were pronounced and varied between years. differential recruitment during the dry season, described above, may have been one source contributing to the observed interannual variation. elsewhere, reduced water quality, especially elevated temperature and reduced oxygen availability, has been shown to impact on fishes in residual pools within intermittent streams (strauch et al., 2015; woodward & ward, 1992) and may have been a potential determinant of variation in late dry season assemblage structure in the present study also. although we never observed water quality conditions that could be considered detrimental to fish health, it is possible that physicochemical changes at times other than during our sampling were sufficiently extreme to result in fish death. however, we do not believe that temporal variation in water quality was sufficiently extreme to exert a significant influence on species survival during the dry season in our study. for example, garcia et al. (2015) reported that water temperature in the fergusson river recorded on multiple occasions during the dry season ranged from 27 to 33°c, dissolved oxygen from 5.7 to 6.3 mg o2/l and ph from 7.5 to 8.2. such conditions are commonplace for aquatic habitats of the wet– dry tropics of northern australia. moreover, northern australian fishes, particularly those recorded from the fergusson river, are tolerant of a wide range of water quality conditions, especially to extremes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen (see pusey et al., 2004). nonetheless, temporal variation in late dry season assemblage structure was pronounced due to changes in the abundance of core species rather than total local extinction of individual species or appearance of abundant novel species. this variation may have resulted from, in addition to temporal variation in dry season recruit- ment, temporal variation in the presence and abundance of aquatic or terrestrial piscivorous organisms. we did not quantify the abundance of piscivorous birds (e.g. cormorants, egrets and heron) or reptiles (water monitor varanus mertoni) although these species (or their tracks) were observed around the study site and they may have exerted an influence on fish abundance and composition. however elsewhere in the region, avian predation upon fishes was determined to be of negligible importance in stream pools of magela creek, another savan- nah river system of northern australia (woodward & ward, 1992). moreover, the depth of the residual pool in the present study may have precluded effective predation by birds other than cormorants in most years except 2009 when the pool was greatly reduced in size. note, however, that fish abundance was high at this time, notwith- standing that it may have been higher still without any putative pre- dation by birds. fish are an important food item in the diet of water monitors (shine, 1986), and anecdotal evidence suggests that preda- tion on fish by water monitors may be substantial in late dry season pools of intermittent tributaries of the daly river (d. warfe, personal communication). monitors may play an important role in determining fish abundance and composition in refugial pools, but the extent of their influence remains to be investigated. pusey et al. piscivory by other fishes may have played some role in determin- ing the abundance of prey species within the fergusson river during both the wet and dry seasons. the barramundi l. calcarifer is the most abundant teleost predator in the daly river (chan et al., 2012), yet it is largely absent from the fergusson river (this study), in contrast to other smaller piscivores. it is widespread across northern australia, but does not, however, penetrate widely into hydrologically variable intermittent streams and rarely achieves high levels of abundance in such systems (pusey & kennard, 2012). single individuals only were recorded from the fergusson river on two occasions only during the present study, whereas an average cpue of 1.53 fish per electrofishing shot was recorded from the perennial main channel. many species of fish feature in the diet of barramundi, among which juvenile terapontids and neosilurids feature heavily (pusey et al., 2004). its low abundance in intermittent streams such as the fergusson, plus the elevated production discussed above, potentially increases the value, to other smaller species, of intermittent streams such as the fergusson river as spawning and rearing habitat. other, smaller, piscivorous fishes were recorded in the refugial pool, however, and may have played a role in influencing temporal changes in assemblage structure. the mouth almighty, g. aprion, a voracious predator of small fish, was moderately abundant on occa- sions (i.e. cpue values ~ two fish per electrofishing shot) and reduc- tion in the relative abundance of rainbowfish was negatively correlated with the abundance of this species. similarly, deviation of late dry sea- son assemblage structure away from the corresponding early dry sea- son starting point (figure 3) was correlated with the abundance of this predator and with two other partially or exclusively piscivorous species, o. lineolata and s. kreffti. thus, predatory fishes may be important in determining the ultimate trajectory taken by fish assemblages as pool volume decreases over the dry season. the influence of predation may vary in intensity and importance between years depending on whether piscivores are among the refugial community at the commencement of the dry period. accordingly, the presence or absence of predators early in the dry season may add a source of stochasticity in late dry season assemblage structure (matthews & marsh- matthews, 2006). in conclusion, this study has shown that the fish assemblage present within the intermittent fergusson river is comprised of a rich subset of that present in the main channel of the parent river and that more- over, this subset is comprised of the most widely distributed species within the broader region. that is, in a large region where the annual water deficit approaches 1 m and the most common flow regime types are characterised by intermittency, the most widely distributed species are, not surprisingly, characteristic of intermittent systems. intermittent streams such as the fergusson river provide a suitable spawning hab- itat for many species during both the wet and dry seasons. over the 7- year study period, the fish assemblage present at the beginning of the dry season was remarkably stable and likely reflected a concordant stability in habitat structure, stable dispersal dynamics into the study reach and similar recruitment dynamics of individual species. in con- trast, dry season assemblage structure was much more variable year to year. this variability was unlikely related to poor water quality or predation by terrestrial organisms. temporal variation in dry season recruitment and dispersal from the study site prior to isolation likely pusey et al. played an important role in determining the structure of the fish assem- blage present late in the year. predation by piscivorous fishes that had not dispersed back to permanent water as the dry season progressed was another potentially important source of variation in total assem- blage structure during the late dry. the factors that play a significant role in structuring fish assemblages are likely to be many and to vary in importance over time (fitzgerald, winemiller, sabaj pérez, & sousa, 2016), particularly when habitat structure is as temporally dynamic as reported here for the intermittent fergusson river. the intermittent rivers of northern australia are clearly biologically important due to the overwhelmingly large contribution they make to the size of the total regional stream network and their provision of suit- able habitat for a diverse set of fishes. the continued existence of refu- gial pools of sufficient size to persist throughout the dry season is key to ensuring the continued provision of suitable habitat and to sustained contribution of intermittent systems to maintaining freshwater biodi- versity. a future in which expanded use of the intermittent and peren- nial freshwater resources of northern australia to support the expan- sion of both novel and existing agricultural development (douglas, jackson, pusey, kennard, & burrows, 2011; king et al., 2015), coupled with the impacts of projected global climate change (morrongiello et al., 2011), is likely to be one in which intermittent streams (and refugia con- tained within them) feature less in the landscape and in which perennial streams tend more to intermittency. greater research effort is needed to better understand the relative importance of individual processes occurring within intermittent streams and rivers and to predict what changes in availability and longevity of intermittent streams means for the maintenance of biodiversity at the basin and regional scales. acknowledgements we are indebted to alison king, david crook, poncie kernoth, peter kyne, danielle warfe, ian dixon,
