(2002) determined in the ouachita mountains that instream habitat varied by basin, year, logging treatment, and basin ⁄ treatment interaction; macroin- vertebrates varied by year and basin, but basin was the only signiﬁcant factor for ﬁsh. by ﬁltering out natural spatial variability, martel et al. (2007) detected reduc- tions in long-lived, large invertebrates when <1% of the area of basins were clearcut in quebec, canada. however, temporal replication for both studies was limited to two or three years of sampling (williams et al. 2002; martel et al. 2007). when examined at the basin scale, stream hydrol- ogy may be strongly affected by forest harvest (salo & cundy 1987; chamberlin et al. 1991). for example, peak snowmelt discharge increased relative to unhar- vested watersheds for at least ﬁve years postharvest in british columbia, canada (macdonald et al. 2003). increases in snowmelt discharge may persist for 15 years postharvest in hardwood forests of the north-central usa (verry 1986). moore & wondzell (2005) provide a review of effects of forest harvest on hydrology, conﬁrming that recovery takes place on a decadal time scale. a more ﬂashy hydrograph follow- ing forest harvesting can have direct effects on ﬁsh assemblages by favouring some species over others (poff & allen 1995), and can also increase turbidity and sediment loading in streams. serengil et al. (2007a) noted that thinning only 11% of the standing timber volume with horse skidding produced a detectable increase in streamﬂow during the rainy season in turkey, as well as a signiﬁcant increase in suspended sediment (serengil et al. 2007b). forested land cover can affect not only turbidity, but also bedload, embeddedness, and channel stability (suth- erland et al. 2002). sediment in streams can have deleterious effects on stream invertebrates and ﬁsh (waters 1995). matthaei et al. (2006) added sediment directly to agricultural streams that were degraded from past land use, and found reduced densities for some common macroin- vertebrate taxa. their experimental approach was reminiscent of alexander & hansen (1986), who conducted experimental and trout numbers due to reduced documented lower egg-to-ﬁngerling survival. juvenile salmon prefer interstitial spaces that are relatively free of sediment (finstad et al. 2007). additions sediment forest harvest can also affect supplies of wood and leaf litter to streams. wood inputs may exhibit a long- term reduction after forest harvest (murphy & koski 1989), which may reduce available habitat for macr- 64 leaf litter oinvertebrates (johnson et al. 2003) and ﬁsh (crook & robertson 1999). natural levels of large wood have tremendous ecological value as providers of habitat and shapers of geomorphology (angermeier & karr 1984; beechie & sibley 1997; quist & guy 2001; johnson et al. 2003; borg et al. 2007). large wood also increases retention of (ehrman & lamberti 1992; larranaga et al. 2003; quinn et al. 2007); even if large wood is unchanged forest harvest can directly reduce leaf litter inputs (oelbermann & gordon 2000; kreutzweiser et al. 2004). in the pokegama creek system in north-central usa, litter inputs were signiﬁcantly reduced after riparian harvest, despite a 30-m riparian buffer (palik et al. 2000). in addition, forest harvest can lead to increases in light levels, periphyton, and macrophytes (kedzierski & smock 2001; kiffney et al. 2003; davies et al. 2005), and may induce changes in ﬁsh communities (bojsen & barriga 2002; nislow & lowe 2006). the objective of the current study was to examine changes in ﬁsh abundances in the pokegama creek system, minnesota, usa over an 11-year time frame in light of experimental forest harvest, habitat condi- tions, and variation in local climate. previous studies in the pokegama creek system examined effects for three years postharvest on ﬁsh and habitat (hemstad et al. 2008) and leaf litter inputs (palik et al. 2000). although few signiﬁcant treatment effects were observed at the site level in the ﬁrst few years after harvest (hemstad et al. 2008), a longer temporal scale and broader spatial scale may be more appropriate (fausch et al. 2002). we collected new data nine and ten years postharvest to examine longer-term temporal patterns in the ﬁsh community at the basin scale. we also used local weather data to determine the inﬂuence of summer air temperature and amount of spring precipitation on ﬁsh abundances. methods study area and sites )1 the study was conducted on four headwater streams in the pokegama creek system, south of grand rapids in north-central minnesota (fig. 1). the streams ﬂow into pokegama lake. the basin was forested and dominated by northern hardwoods (palik et al. 2003). prior to the study the mean basal area of forest stands was 30 m2æha (palik et al. 2003). topography included moraine hills rising 5 m above the valley ﬂoor, with hillslopes of 1–30% (unpubl. data). bank- full widths at the study sites were 2 m and stream slopes were 0.7–3.5%. soils were generally fertile with well-drained loamy sands (palik et al. 2003), including occasional gravel lenses and cobble ⁄ boulder inclusions. relations between ﬁsh abundances, summer temperatures, and forest harvest treatments control upland clearcut/riparian control upland clearcut/riparian thin fig. 1. study sites located near grand rapids, mn, usa. each site is 4.9 ha. sampling reaches are shown at two hypo- thetical sites at bottom (not to scale). rmz = 30 m wide riparian management zone. in 1997, 12 study sites were established along the four headwater streams, although one site became dry each summer and was thus excluded from analyses (fig. 1). the 11 remaining sites were each about 4.9 ha, with 2.45 ha on each side of the stream; sites were generally 200 m apart. each site included 150– 200 m of stream length. harvest treatments at each site (n = 2), upland were either unharvested control clearcut with 30-m unharvested buffers (riparian buffer, n = 3), or upland clearcut with 30-m riparian )1 basal area (thinned strips thinned to 12.3 m2æha riparian, n = 6). all forest harvests were conducted in fall and winter of 1997. the total harvested areas represented 2–11% of the four catchments, which is near the lower threshold for harvest effects in prior studies (martel et al. 2007; serengil et al. 2007a,b). as suggested by analyses using data from 1997 to 2000 (hemstad et al. 2008), the current study inves- tigated changes and relationships at the basin scale. thus, the following analyses did not differentiate between harvest treatments at the site scale, with the exception of the site-level analysis of stream warming. data collection fish were sampled during august in 1997 (prehar- vest), 1998–2000, and 2006–2007. fish were sampled 1200 meters in three 50-m reaches at each site; 50 m immediately upstream of the site, the lowermost 50 m of the site, and 50 m immediately downstream of the site (fig. 1). all sampling was conducted with a wisconsin abp-3 backpack electroﬁsher (engineering technical ser- vices, university of wisconsin, madison, wisconsin). a coldwater ﬁsh index of biotic integrity (ibi) value was calculated for each 50-m reach (mundahl & simon 1999). the ibi increases with the proportion of species that are ranked as intolerant, top carnivores, and coldwater obligates [e.g., brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis)] and decreases with the proportion of tolerant species [e.g., central mudminnow (umbra limi, kirtland) or creek chub (semotilus atromacula- tus, mitchill)]. brook_trout comprised >99% of the individuals in the southern streams (fig. 1) and were absent thus brook_trout analyses only used data from the southern stream. analyses for other individual species only used data from the three northern streams, and the ibi analyses used data from all four streams. from the other streams, abundance estimates were calculated for each species in each 50-m reach. during the ﬁrst pass, ﬁsh were electroﬁshed from the 50-m reach, identiﬁed to species, and marked with a caudal ﬁn clip. the ﬁsh were then redistributed throughout the reach. approx- imately an hour after the ﬁrst pass, a second electro- 65 merten et al. ﬁshing pass was completed through the reach. fish captured during the second pass were identiﬁed to species, and checked for a ﬁn clip. this method allowed calculation of an abundance estimate for each species using both a depletion method and a mark- recapture method (poppro; kwak 1992). if catchabil- ity (kwak 1992) for a species was ‡0.8, the depletion method was used. if catchability was <0.8, but the ratio of recaptured ﬁsh to total second-pass ﬁsh (r ⁄ c ratio) was >0.2, the mark-recapture method was used. if catchability was 0.5–0.8 or the r ⁄ c ratio was 0.15– 0.2, the method toward the higher end of its range was used. when catchability was <0.5 and the r ⁄ c ratio was <0.15, the sum of captures for the ﬁrst and second pass was used; the sum never exceeded ten ﬁsh in such cases. surﬁcial ﬁne substrates were examined in july 1997–2000 and 2006–2007 as an indicator of habitat for ﬁsh and invertebrates (hemstad et al. 2008). each 50-m reach was divided into ﬁve equal subreaches, to avoid sampling exclusively at the upstream or down- stream end of a 50-m reach. seven circular quadrats (28 cm in diameter) were assessed in random locations in each 10-m subreach to visually estimate the areal percentage of the substrate that was sand, silt, or clay (i.e., ﬁne substrates). thus, we sampled 7 quad- rats · 165 subreaches to equal 1155 quadrats per year. basin-scale relations between temporal patterns in ﬁsh and environmental variables were examined using the mean from all sites in the pokegama creek system each year. univariate regressions were used to inves- tigate temporal trends for the basin means for ﬁsh index of biotic integrity and abundances, and to investigate relationships between ﬁsh and ﬁne sedi- ment at the basin scale. univariate regressions were also used to examine the relationships between ﬁsh variables and two climate variables. the ﬁrst climate variable was summer air temperature, using the mean air temperature from june through august of each year at the nearest monitoring station 10 km to the north (minnesota state climatology ofﬁce). the second climate variable was total spring precipitation, the cumulative precipitation from april 1 through july 12 (prior to ﬁeld sampling) of each year. the proportion that each ﬁsh species contributed to total ﬁsh abun- dance was also examined with a rank abundance curve for each year sampled. temporal patterns in ﬁsh variables were examined further with multiple regressions, using surﬁcial ﬁne substrates, summer air temperature, and total spring precipitation as predictor variables. the ﬁnal regres- sion model was chosen using the stepaic function of the statistical software r to determine the model with the fewest predictors that would each make a signiﬁcant to the aic (weisberg 1985). improvement 66 site-level effects on stream temperature were exam- ined in 2006 and 2007 during august (the warmest month). an onsetò pro v2 temperature recorder (onset, pocasset, ma, usa) was placed 0–50 m upstream and another was placed 0–50 m downstream of each site. each recorder (onset, pocasset, ma, usa) was cabled to a brick in the deepest pool available and was set to measure water temperature every 15 min. the response variable examined for water temperature was the mean temperature in august for the downstream recorder minus the mean temper- ature in august for the upstream recorder (i.e., site- level warming). of the 24 recorders set each year, two became exposed to air due to low water levels, one was buried by bedload, and one was vandalized; the corresponding sites were omitted from the site-level analysis. a two-factor anova was used to evaluate site-level warming, using the software r (ihaka & gentleman 1996). the ﬁrst factor for the anova was year (2006 vs. 2007) and the second factor was treatment riparian buffer, or thinned riparian). no transformations were necessary; tukey’s hsd was used to compare mean values. (unharvested control, results the ibi scores decreased signiﬁcantly over time (table 1), as did mean abundance for brook_trout and northern redbelly dace (phoxinus eos, cope, table 1). mean abundance of brook stickleback (culaea incon- stans, kirtland) also decreased over time while creek chubs increased, although neither trend was signiﬁcant (r = )0.70 and 0.79, p = 0.12 and 0.06). central mudminnow and ﬁnesecale dace (phoxinus neogaeus, cope) showed no trend. other species [i.e., emerald shiner (notropis atherinoides, raﬁnesque), fathead minnow (pimephales promelas, raﬁnesque), iowa darter (etheostoma exile, girard), and northern pike (esox lucius, linnaeus)] were uncommon (table 1) and were not included in species-level analyses. in terms of relative abundances, brook_trout were the most abun- dant species from 1997 through 1999 but declined to fourth and third most abundant by 2006 and 2007. central mudminnows were fourth or ﬁfth most abun- dant from 1997 through 2000 and became the most abundant species in 2006 and 2007 (fig. 2). some changes occurred with ﬁne sediment and local weather. fine substrates increased after 1997 and total spring precipitation increased from 1997 through 1999 and subsequently decreased (table 2). on average, summer air temperatures increased over the study period by 0.062 °cæyear the nearest weather station (fig. 3), which is

higher abundances of both species were associated with years with colder summer air temper- atures, and surﬁcial ﬁne substrates or total spring rainfall were excluded by the aic procedure. multiple

4) were negatively related to warmer summer air temperatures; ﬁnescale dace also had a similar marginal relation (r2 = 0.49, not shown). univariate regressions showed no relations between temporal patterns in ﬁsh index of biotic integrity or abundances with ﬁne sediment or spring precipitation (table 4). there were signiﬁcant site-level treatment effects on stream warming for 2006 and 2007

sites. however, warming at the unharvested control sites was not signiﬁcantly different from the riparian buffer sites or the thinned riparian sites (p > 0.17) for 2006 and 2007. 68 discussion we found that temporal patterns in abundances of brook stickleback and northern redbelly dace were signiﬁcantly related to summer air temperatures at the basin scale. in addition, univariate regressions showed relations between summer air temperatures and ibi scores, brook_trout abundance, and ﬁnescale dace abundance. conversely, no ﬁsh variables were related to temporal patterns in ﬁne sediment or total spring precipitation. below we discuss overall changes in the ﬁsh community, followed by discussion of changes in abundance for common species. the spatial scale of the pokegama creek system likely encompassed the life cycles of the ﬁsh species (fausch et al. 2002). brook_trout were only sampled in one stream, and would need to migrate 5 km through a warmwater river to reach the nearest coldwater stream outside the study area. the other small-bodied species were considered likely to have spent their entire life cycles within the headwater stream system. ibi scores showed a signiﬁcant negative trend over the study period, and abundances of sensitive species [i.e., brook_trout, northern redbelly dace (stasiak 1972), and brook stickleback (winn 1960)] also appeared to decline. meanwhile, the abundance of tolerant creek chubs increased. overall ﬁsh numbers were markedly lower in 2006 and 2007. there are several possible explanations for the decline. first, diminished leaf litter inputs after forest harvest (palik et al. 2000) may have led to bottom-up trophic effects, as could decreased retention of leaf litter due to less large wood in the channels (ehrman & lamberti 1992; larranaga et al. 2003; quinn et al. 2007). second, another study in the poke- gama creek basin documented a decrease in macroin- vertebrate diversity from 1997 through 2000, driven largely by increasing proportions of chironomids (c. chizinski, unpubl. data). burrowing chironomids (hol- ker & stief 2005) may be unavailable as prey for the ﬁsh species in the pokegama creek system, which could potentially lead to increased mortality over time through chronic undernourishment. third, total spring precipi- tation in 2006 and 2007 was the lowest of the study period, thus low water levels (lake 2003) are another possible explanation for reduced ﬁsh numbers. the ﬁsh community in the pokegama creek system appears to have responded to different environmental relations between ﬁsh

in the pokegama creek system showed a negative relation- ship between ibi scores and ﬁne substrates from 1997 to 2000 (hemstad et al. 2008). however, our analyses showed no relationship between temporal patterns in ibi scores and ﬁne substrates at the basin scale. our multiple regressions and univariate regressions indi- cate a strong connection between summer air temper- atures and the ﬁsh community; warmer temperatures may favour some species at the expense of others (baltz et al. 1982; reeves 1985). brook_trout the abundance of brook_trout declined consistently during the study period. the reason for the decline in brook_trout is not clear, although previous research indicates changes in ﬁne sediment (alexander & hansen 1986; waters 1995; finstad et al. 2007) or large wood (johnson et al. 2003) could have reduced the habitat available for brook_trout and macroinver- tebrates. our study design could not rule out bottom- up trophic effects as an explanation for the consistent reduction in brook_trout abundance. based on univariate regressions, the most compelling explana- tion for the brook_trout decline is that increasing temperatures over the study period caused mortality (or emigration to the nearest coldwater stream 5 km south). although the highest seven-day mean water temperatures we observed (17.9 °c in 2006 and 17.4 °c in 2007) did not reach the critical thermal maximum of 22.3 °c for brook_trout (eaton et al. table 4. coefﬁcients of determination (r2) for univariate regressions between ibi scores or ﬁsh abundances and surﬁcial ﬁne

effects on ﬁsh can be subtle (boughton et al. 2007). invertebrate production may have been limited by the signiﬁcantly higher levels of ﬁne sediment following harvest (waters 1995; matt- haei et al. 2006; hemstad et al. 2008) or warming temperatures (durance & ormerod 2007), and thus precluded ﬁsh from consuming sufﬁcient quantities of invertebrates during warmer temperatures (ries & perry 1995). northern redbelly dace abundance of northern redbelly dace decreased signiﬁcantly over time. at the basin scale, higher abundances of northern redbelly dace were associ- ated with years with colder air temperatures in summer. stasiak (1972) noted that northern red- belly dace prefer streams with a constant ﬂow of cool groundwater; warmer summer temperatures in our study may have caused direct mortality or emigration. brook stickleback abundance of brook sticklebacks decreased over time, although not signiﬁcantly. as for brook_trout and northern redbelly dace, brook stickleback abundance at the basin scale was negatively related to warmer air temperatures in summer. brook sticklebacks require cool water (winn 1960), but they are also sensitive to environmental degradation (lyons 2006). as with other species, increased ﬁne sediment after forest harvest (hemstad et al. 2008) could have reduced invertebrate prey numbers (waters 1995; matthaei et al. 2006) for brook stickleback. 70 creek chub the creek chub was the only species that increased signiﬁcantly over time. contrary to previous studies, creek chub abundance was not signiﬁcantly related to spring precipitation (franssen et al. 2006) at the basin scale. the increasing temporal trend for creek chubs is not surprising, as previous studies have also documented increases in creek chub numbers after forest harvest (jones et al. 1999; sutherland et al. 2002). creek chub abundance may have increased due to less predation on their eggs and fry from other species (i.e., northern redbelly dace and brook stickleback), or less competition for invertebrate prey. it is also possible that creek chubs gained a competitive advantage from warmer water tempera- tures, as has been documented with other pairs of species (baltz et al. 1982; reeves 1985). finally, creek chubs build a clean gravel nest by exporting mouthfuls of sand and importing gravel (ross 1977), which may have made their reproductive success more resistant to the increased levels of ﬁne sediment following harvesting. central mudminnow the abundance of central mudminnows was fairly stable for the duration of the study. central mudmin- nows are eurythermal (klinger et al. 1982), generalist feeders (paszkowski 1984) and can use ﬁne sediment as habitat by burrowing into the substrate (peckham & dineen 1957). central mudminnows became the most abundant species in 2006 and 2007, as most species had declined in abundance and creek chubs, though on the rise, remained relatively uncommon. warming due to forest harvest estimated stream warming was signiﬁcantly greater in thinned riparian sites relative to riparian buffer sites, possibly due to patches of open canopy (hemstad et al. 2008). although stream warming associated with narrowed buffers has been documented in the past (beschta et al. 1987), the current study is unusual in that we have documented warming ten years posthar- vest in some treatments. removal of riparian vegeta- tion may exacerbate the effects of warmer air temperatures by reducing shade. however, the sample size was limited for testing site-scale warming, and it is not clear why warming at unharvested control sites was not signiﬁcantly different from other treatments. conclusion in summary, this study demonstrated that summer air temperatures can inﬂuence temporal patterns in ﬁsh relations between ﬁsh abundances, summer temperatures, and forest harvest communities more than ﬁne sediment or spring precipitation. studies assessing land use impacts on ﬁsh population trends should also consider inﬂuences of interannual weather patterns and climate conditions. ongoing climate change (rosenzweig et al. 2008) can be more important to ﬁsh communities than direct anthropogenic effects (daufresne & boet 2007), highlighting a pressing need to protect cool water temperatures (eaton & scheller 1996; pilgrim et al. 1998; stefan et al. 2001; chu et al. 2008). the effects of warmer temperatures on ﬁsh may be exacerbated in streams where degraded habitat prevents prey produc- tion from keeping pace with increased metabolic demands (ries & perry 1995). forest management can preserve cool water temperatures by maintaining or restoring forested buffers with sufﬁcient overstory to fully shade the stream (beschta et al. 1987). based on previous literature (salo & cundy 1987; chamberlin et al. 1991), a conservative approach would be to maintain preharvest levels of leaf litter inputs, hydro- logic ﬂuctuations, large wood inputs, and ﬁne sedi- ment in addition, practitioners restoring harvested sites should consider mitigation of warming temperatures (e.g., restoring full shade) along with other ecological processes (muotka & syrjanen 2007). loading. acknowledgements this work was
