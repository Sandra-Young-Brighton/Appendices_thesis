e-mail: mer103@msstate.edu accepted for publication november 8, 2006 introduction several theories have been constructed to promote an understanding of spatial and temporal variation in the structure and function of riverine ecosystems. biotic variation along the river continuum is well described for numerous river systems throughout the world, and is often explained by predictable changes in physical habitat along the continuum (river continuum concept, vannote et al. 1980). natural or human imposed disruptions to this continuum create ‘noise’ along predicted gradations as conditions are altered at the point of disturbance and recover with increasing distance downstream (serial discontinuity concept, ward & stanford 1983). disjunctions along the river continuum imposed by river regulation, such as impoundments or conﬂuences with artiﬁcial channels, create abrupt ecotones that in turn fragment biotas (martinez et al. 1994; pringle et al. 2000; santucci et al. 2005). thus, altered river ecosystems can be characterised as patchy and dynamic when viewed at intermediate, regional spatial scales (e.g., 100–102 km as in rice et al. 2001). the alteration of river ecosystems is a global phenomenon, threatening aquatic biodiversity world- wide (zwick 1992; dynesius & nilsson 1994; nilsson et al. 2005) as humans alter riverine systems to meet economic demands. a large-scale navigation and excavation project completed during the early 1980s considerably altered the tombigbee river, impound- ing 300 km of its south ﬂowing course and connecting it via canal to the historically separate tennessee river 250 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00216.x drainage, creating the tennessee–tombigbee water- way (ttw) in northeastern mississippi and west- central alabama. this alteration has created novel habitats in the system, as well as a corridor for the exchange of fauna between the two historically isolated systems. among the isolated tributary rivers and streams in the ttw system are an assortment of reservoirs, artiﬁcial canals, dredged river channels and cutoff bendways. the overwhelming trend of change in the system is a conversion of lotic habitat to lentic, barge-friendly waters. as a result of this large-scale disturbance, physical habitat, consumer relationships and food resources in the ttw system have been affected (boschung 1987). trophic linkages among the diverse biological communities in the altered tombigbee river system are not yet known. divergence in taxonomic composition and popula- tion abundances among communities in fragmented habitat patches ultimately occurs as environmental conditions shift (corbacho & sanchez 2001; santucci et al. 2005). such change can be viewed as a product of successive waves of local extinction and invasion that occur as communities adjust to ecosystem alter- ations (taylor 1997) that may include changes in availability of food resources. unique opportunities to investigate trophic plasticity arise when a native consumer species that persists as fragmented subpop- ulations in multiple tributary habitats, also occupies the novel and sharply contrasting habitat provided by the waterway. we collected a native, riverine specialist from both the isolated and remnant east fork of the tombigbee river and in altered ttw reaches. the crystal darter, crystallaria asprella, is endangered in mississippi and is considered a species of special concern by the american fisheries society. knowledge of the feeding ecology of c. asprella would help to establish a foundation for future conservation and river restor- ation strategies. previous feeding ecology studies have been performed on very few specimens of c. asprella, and to our knowledge no specimens from mississippi have been studied. the existing studies indicate that insect orders diptera, ephemeroptera and trichoptera are common prey (forbes 1880; becker 1983). however, invertebrate ecologies can vary greatly within an order (merritt & cummins 1996) and a higher degree of taxonomic resolution is needed to examine its trophic role among variable habitats. because the east fork most closely resembles lotic conditions observed in the historical tombigbee river, we hypothesised that feeding ecologies should be similar among these individuals. the relatively lentic environment within the ttw should foster signiﬁcant dietary divergence. whether this novel habitat can adequately support a population of c. asprella is not known, and we approached this investigation under feeding ecology of the crystal darter the general hypothesis that the waterway individuals represent a population sink (pulliam 1988) or the result of mass effects (shmida & wilson 1985). speciﬁcally, we compare c. asprella diet charac- terised from the tombigbee river prior to waterway construction to diets in two contemporary conditions, the remnant east fork of the tombigbee river and the modiﬁed main channel of the ttw, so as to describe how river regulation may have altered the trophic ecology of this imperiled ﬁsh species. materials and methods individuals of c. asprella were collected from numerous tributary and waterway reaches within the system during summer months of 2002–2005 (fig. 1), using a combination of seining and backpack electro- fig. 1. contemporary collection localities for crystallaria asprella within the east fork of the tombigbee river (ef and circles) and the river section of the tennessee–tombigbee waterway (rs and squares) in ne mississippi. the inset map displays the location of the tennessee–tombigbee drainage within the state of mississippi. 251 roberts et al. )1 at tributary localities and 0.02–0.23 mæs ﬁshing. most collections occurred at depths ranging from 60 to 148 cm as has been reported from other southeastern river systems when similar collection methods are used (e.g., george et al. 1996). stream ﬂow at collection localities ranged from 0.3 to )1 1.03 mæs at waterway localities. fishes collected in the ﬁeld were killed using ms-222 and ﬁxed using 10% formalin. these were later transferred to 70% ethanol and stored until processing in the laboratory. historical specimens were obtained from summer collections prior to waterway construction housed at the missis- sippi museum of natural science. tributary, water- way, and historical groups included 39, 33 and 24 individuals respectively. to characterise food habits, specimens were eviscerated and diet contributors present within the ﬁrst third of the digestive tract were identiﬁed to order or family (depending upon taxonomic group) and enumerated. standard length was also recorded for each individual ﬁsh. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nms, krus- kal 1964; mather 1976) was used to highlight gradients in diet composition across historical, tribu- tary and waterway groups. nms is an appropriate tool for this purpose because it is robust to non-normal and nonlinear data as well as issues of scale (clarke 1993). however, results can be inﬂuenced by data transfor- mation and these should be performed with respect to the hypothesis in question (mccune & grace 2002). we square-root transformed our data so as to apply compression to higher values in the data set. this was desirable to preclude numerically dominant diet contributors from masking dietary shifts incorporating less abundant taxa. sørensen distances were computed among all sample units and we followed the general nms procedure outlined by mccune & grace (2002). we tested for signiﬁcant separation in diet composi- tion among groups using multiresponse permutation procedures (mrpp, mielke 1984; mielke & berry 2001). unlike parametric tests used for this purpose (e.g., multivariate analysis of variance), mrpp makes no assumption of normality (smith 1998). the test provides a p-value evaluating the probability that observed differences are due to chance, as well as an effect size a. representing ‘chance-corrected within- group agreement’ (mccune & grace 2002), a is a measure of observed within-group homogeneity relative to what can be expected by chance. within- group homogeneity is greater than the random observation when a > 0 and less when a < 0. the a-value is useful in attaching ecological signiﬁcance to observed differences among groups because it is independent of sample size (mielke 1984; mccune & grace 2002). data were square-root transformed prior to analysis and we utilised the euclidean distance measure (mccune & grace 2002). 252 indicator species analysis (isa, dufreˆne & legen- dre 1997) was then used to identify taxa that were indicative of c. asprella diet for each group. isa complements mrpp by describing the value of individual variables (each diet contributor) for separ- ating groups. an indicator value is provided that is representative of the concentration of taxon abundance and the ﬁdelity of a taxon to a particular group (mccune & grace 2002). thus, an ideal indicator for a diet group is always present in the diet of consumers from that group and is exclusive to the diet of consumers from that group. isa yields an indicator value for each diet contributor ranging from 0 (no indication) to 100 (perfect indication). signiﬁcance is tested using a monte carlo procedure (fortin & gurevitch 1993) that randomly reassigns sample units to each group through 1000 permutations. we followed the general isa procedure outlined in mccune & grace (2002). all aforementioned analyses were conducted using pc-ord software, version 4.01 (mjm software, gleneden beach, or, usa). diet overlap among the three groups was assessed using a randomisation algorithm that allowed diet breadth to vary across groups while maintaining local prey availability (ecosim software, gotelli & entsminger 2001). the total number of individuals consumed for each diet contributor was entered into a matrix incorporating the historical, tributary and waterway groups. zero states were retained within the matrix such that a diet item not recorded for a particular group was not a viable prey item for that group in the randomisation. pianka’s (1973) index was used to quantify niche overlap for the observed matrix and signiﬁcance was assessed with a monte carlo procedure (fortin & gurevitch 1993) based on 1000 permutations. variation of body size across groups was examined using one-way analysis of variance (anova) on log- transformed standard length values. pair-wise differ- ences in sl among groups were determined using tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (tukey’s hsd, sokal & rohlf 1995). the anova and tukey’s hsd tests were conducted using jmp-in software, version 4.0.4 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa). results non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of c. asprella dietary items separated tributary, waterway and historical diets (fig. 2). two prevalent gradients captured most of the variance in the diet groups with axes 2 and 3 containing 38.5% and 24.7%, respect- ively, of the information in the analytical data set (cumulative ¼ 63.2%) and the model was improved very little by increasing dimensionality. axis 1 was not ecologically interpretable, but did explain about 3 s m n 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 –1.5 i e a d m o n o r i h c g n s a e r c n  i i increasing simuliidae –2 –1 0 nms2 1 2 fig. 2. non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of crys- tallaria asprella diets in tributary (open squares), waterway (closed circles) and historical samples (open triangles). per cent variance accounted by the ordination axes was 38.5% (axis 2) and 24.7% (axis 3). 18% of the data sets’ variation. a comparison of axes 2 versus 3 indicated a prevalent simuliidae–chiro- nomidae gradient driving the separation. simuliidae were most common in historical diets, chironomidae were most common in waterway diets and tributary diets were intermediate to the two (fig. 2). diet composition varied across (mrpp: a ¼ 0.105, p < 0.0001) and when examined pair- wise, all comparisons were signiﬁcantly different. historical versus waterway had the strongest separa- tion (mrpp: a ¼ 0.136, p < 0.0001) and tributary having versus (mrpp: a ¼ 0.040, p < 0.001). tributary versus waterway separation (mrpp: a ¼ 0.080, had intermediate p < 0.0001). the weakest all groups historical indicator species analysis isolated invertebrate taxa indicative of waterway specimens, as well as histor- ical/tributary specimens. waterway indicators were caenidae, daphnidae and ostracoda. shared indica- tors for the historical and tributary groups were baetidae, heptageniidae, hydropsychidae and hyd- racarina. the tributary and waterway groups shared the chironomidae as indicators, and tricorythidae were indicative of tributary diet (table 1).

(2005) observed a similar trend among yellow perch, perca ﬂavescens (mitchill), feeding upon 253 roberts et al. invertebrates in metal-contaminated canadian lakes. perca ﬂavescens in more contaminated lakes showed a greater reliance on chironomids and zooplankton than did those in relatively less impacted systems. a reduction in growth was noted for individuals from contaminated lakes and attributed to increased cost of foraging on a simpliﬁed prey base. similarly, we observed that c. asprella relying upon a depauperate, generalist prey base in the waterway were signiﬁcantly smaller than those in other groups. crystallaria asprella can be classiﬁed as a ‘lie-in-wait’ predator. miller & robison (1973) observed that when feeding, it buries itself in the sand with only the eyes protruding while waiting for invertebrates carried in the drift to pass by. lentic conditions within the waterway are not con- ducive to this type of feeding behaviour, and the energetic cost of using an alternative foraging method may have resulted in the reduced body size we observed for waterway c. asprella. river impoundment can signiﬁcantly lower the foraging efﬁciency of riverine-adapted ﬁshes (penczak 1995). according to optimal foraging theory (scho- ener 1971; charnov 1976), consumers should emigrate to other habitat patches when it becomes too energet- ically expensive to remain foraging in the present patch. greater energetic demands incurred by larger- bodied c. asprella occurring in the waterway may motivate emigration to lotic habitats that facilitate its characteristic feeding behaviour. thus, relatively free ﬂowing tributaries to the waterway (e.g., the east fork) would serve as important refugia for the species. the diet of tributary c. asprella appeared interme- diate between historical and waterway diets. while tributary and historical diets shared many indicator taxa, our null model also indicated signiﬁcantly greater diet overlap than expected between the tributary and waterway groups. furthermore, tributary diets were intermediate along the simuliid–chironomid gradient identiﬁed by nms and chironomids were a diet indicator for both groups. we interpreted this as tributary c. asprella have become indicating that increasingly reliant upon a generalist prey base. although it is not under direct inﬂuence of lock and dam structures present on waterway, the east fork maintains a direct connection to these reaches via the conﬂuence and a number of minimum ﬂow discharges that drain reservoirs on the canal section into the adjacent river. these results coincide with signiﬁcant differences in ﬂow regime found for the east fork before and after waterway construction using the indicators of hydro- logic alteration software of richter et al. (1996). as part of a concurrent study, we have documented that )1) in the east fork has increased by base ﬂow (m3æs 41% since waterway construction. considering these observations, ﬂow regime emerges as a possible 254 underlying factor inﬂuencing the dietary shift that occurred between the historical and tributary groups. it is well documented that ﬂow regime alterations can impact invertebrate assemblages (see review in bunn & arthington 2002) and invertebrate drift (see review in brittain & eikeland 1988). speciﬁcally, increases in stream discharge are known to adversely affect densities of simuliid blackﬂies (zhang et al. 1998), and increased presence in the drift has been associated with lower ﬂows rather than higher ﬂows in terms of magnitude and current velocity (de moor et al. 1986). in addition, the prevalence of stable substrates that are crucial to certain simuliid life stages (crosskey 1990) would be reduced if sedimentation has intensiﬁed in the river post-waterway. under these adverse conditions, simuliid prey may be less available to drift feeding c. asprella. conversely, the chiro- nomidae are a generalist group thriving under a wide variety of ﬂow regimes and in many different substrate types (coffman & ferrington 1996). because of this plasticity, chironomids should remain a viable food source. in spite of this, isa showed that a number of diet contributors are shared pre- and post-waterway and body size did not differ between historical and tributary individuals. this suggests that growth has not been negatively impacted by an increased reliance upon chironomid prey and relatively lotic conditions continue to facilitate the characteristic feeding strategy of the species. we put forth the general hypothesis that waterway individuals represent a population sink (pulliam 1988) or the result of mass effects (shmida & wilson 1985). our results support this hypothesis and suggest that the waterway provides habitat where c. asprella can be found, but also that this habitat is not likely to maintain a viable population. within the waterway, c. asprella were most abundant in our collections near the conﬂuences of major tributaries implicating these as harbouring source populations. waterway indivi- duals were smaller on average than those collected in the east fork and our observed average sl (45.8 mm) for waterway c. asprella is less than what is reported for size at maturity in the species in the southeast (75.8 mm sl for males and 65.5 mm sl for females, george et al. 1996). thus, immigration into the waterway appears to occur at subadult stages. as previously discussed, greater energetic demands should prompt emigration back to lotic habitats at larger body sizes as well as upon reaching reproduc- tive maturity, relegating sustaining reproductive effort to main channel tributaries. due to the existence of population sinks, situations may arise where the observed, realised niche for a species is larger than the fundamental niche (sensu in the case of c. asprella, a hutchinson 1957). consumer displaying some degree of spatial and dietary plasticity can interact with the biotic commu- nity within a habitat even when recruitment does not occur locally. the suitability of the waterway as a nursery grounds for immigrant juvenile c. asprella remains unclear and warrants further investigation. pulliam (1988) hypothesised that a species assemblage within a habitat may consist of both source and sink populations so that it may be as much or more inﬂuenced by the type and proximity of other habitats as by the resources and other conditions at the site. our study emphasises the need to examine the role of tributaries in maintaining the observed biodiversity within the altered main channel of regulated rivers. acknowledgements this research was made possible in part by grants from the national science foundation’s research experiences for undergraduates program (reu) and the mississippi
