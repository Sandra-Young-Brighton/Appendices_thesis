mazzoni & lobón- cerviá, 2000; oberdorff, guilbert, & lucchetta, 1993; suvarnaraksha, lek, lek- ang, & jutagate, 2012; torgersen, baxter, li, & mcintosh, 2006). many re- searchers have found that local species richness of stream fishes in- crease downstream, obtain the maximum at the middle reaches and decrease at the lower reaches of streams (e.g., minshall et al., 1985; ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:433–441. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  433 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd434  |     oberdorff et al., 1993; sui, lu, yan, chen, & jia, 2014). this hump- shaped distribution of fish species richness can be explained by the river continuum concept (vannote et al., 1980), mid- domain effect (dunn, colwell, & nilsson, 2006), habitat complexity (minshall et al., 1985) and anthropogenic disturbances (oberdorff et al., 1993). also, species composition varies downstream through species gain and/ or loss (matthews, 1998). over large spatial extents, streams may cross some geographic boundaries characterised by sharp physical and chemical habitat transitions, which can lead to extensive spe- cies replacement (including both species gain and loss) and commu- nity turnover (leprieur et al., 2011; matthews, 1998; mcgarvey & hughes, 2008). however, at small spatial scale (e.g., from small- sized to medium- sized wadeable streams), physical and chemical habitat may vary continuously downstream, which can allow for species ad- dition (i.e., species gain) and some degree of community nestedness (mcgarvey & hughes, 2008; taylor & warren, 2001; wang et al., 2013). comparing α and β diversity at local and landscape scales is an important yet little- understood area of basic and applied ecological research (kessler et al., 2009). however, most studies on the spatial distributions of stream fish diversity focused on α diversity (i.e., within- community diversity), whereas fewer studies have investigated β di- versity (i.e., between- community diversity) (johnson & angeler, 2014; tisseuil, leprieur, grenouillet, vrac, & lek, 2013). only jaramillo- villa, maldonado- ocampo, and escobar (2010) and tisseuil et al. (2013) have reported the longitudinal pattern of β diversity of stream fishes. jaramillo- villa et al. (2010) found that, at the colombian andes, β di- versity decrease with elevation decreasing from 1,750 to 1,000 m. tisseuil et al. (2013) discovered an overall pattern of decreasing β di- versity along the upstream–downstream river gradient at the adour- garonne basin (france). however, it is not clear that whether the discovered longitudinal patterns of β diversity of stream fishes are consistent with other unstudied regions or not. anthropogenic disturbances, such as urbanisation, agricultural ac- tivities and deforestation, have modified habitat conditions, decrease resource availability and threatened stream fishes world widely (allan, 2004; wang, lyons, kanehl, & bannerman, 2001; zhang et al., 2015). following with habitat destruction, many endemic intolerant species are replaced by cosmopolitan tolerant species (allan, 2004; chu, wang, yan et al., 2015; wang et al., 2001). from this perspective, the change in local species richness largely depends on the numbers of both en- demic species lost and cosmopolitan species introduced. in addition, this process of species loss and/or gain resulted from anthropogenic activities can increase the dissimilarity of fish assemblages between disturbed and undisturbed segments/streams, which will modify the spatial pattern of β diversity of fishes in headwater streams. in this study, we investigated fish assemblages along the upstream–down- stream gradient from three headwater streams within the qingyi river, a tributary at the lower reach of the yangzi river, china. the three study streams were influenced by different extents of anthropogenic activities, which allowed us to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on fish assemblages by comparing their among- stream variation. this study was aimed to (i) determine the among- stream li et al. variations in both α and β diversity of fishes, by which to assess how anthropogenic disturbance affected the mean α and β diversity in streams; and (ii) to examine the among- stream variations in the “diver- sity–distance from headwaters” relationship, by which to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the “upstream–downstream” patterns in both α and β diversity. the processes of endemic species losing and cosmopolitan species gaining resulted from human activi- ties may increase the between- community dissimilarity between dis- turbed and undisturbed segments. therefore, we hypothesised that the mean β diversity of fishes in the stream(s) heavily disturbed may be higher than that in the stream(s) disturbed less. also, we hypothe- sised that α diversity of fishes in stream(s) disturbed less may increase downstream as stated by roberts and hitt (2010) and β diversity may decrease downstream as supported by tisseuil et al. (2013), whereas this upstream–downstream pattern in fish diversity may change in stream(s) disturbed heavily, because the species loss and gain resulted from human activities can alter both the within- assemblage diversity and the between- assemblage dissimilarity of fishes. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study area the qingyi river originates in the northern portion of the huangshan mountain and flows northeast towards its confluence with the lower yangtze river, china. due to the influence of subtropical monsoon cli- mate, this basin is characterised by asymmetric seasonal temperature and precipitation distributions. average annual temperature is 17.8°c, with monthly mean temperature ranging from −2.1°c in january to 27.5°c in july. annual rainfall is approximately 2,000 mm/year, of which 71% rainfall occurs from april to september. in the mid- late 20th century, the chencun hydropower station was built at the middle reach of the qingyi river (chu, wang, zhu et al., 2015; li et al., 2016). the streams flowing into the chencun reservoir include the qingxi, shuxi, yangxi, maxi and puxi stream. the maxi and puxi stream are heavily polluted by human activities. the pollution emitted yearly into the maxi and puxi stream is approximately twice as much that emitted into the other three streams (li et al., 2014). also, these streams are different in the proportion of land use. the proportion of land use is the highest in the puxi stream (9.32% of urban land and 11.12% of farmland land respectively), the medium in the yangxi (1.26% urban and 7.28% farmland) and maxi stream (3.13% urban and 8.08% farm- land), and the lowest in the shuxi and qingxi streams (<1% urban and <5% farmland) (lu et al., 2014). we collected fishes from the shuxi, puxi and maxi stream, among which the shuxi is disturbed less by human activities, and the maxi and puxi stream are heavily disturbed. 2.2 | field survey within each study stream, we set sampling sites continuously with an interval of 2–3 km from headwaters to downstream segments. sampling sites were selected in the field based on habitat representa- tiveness and accessibility. each site was wadeable (<1 m depth) and li et al. encompassed at least two common habitat- patches such as pools and riffles. a total of 14 sites were sampled in both the shuxi and maxi stream, whereas 11 sites were sampled in the puxi stream because of multiple dams that uplifted water level and lessened wadeable seg- ments (figure 1). during may and october 2011, fish were collected from each site using a backpack electro- fishing unit (cwb- 2000 p, china; 12 v im- port, 250 v export) by wading in two passes without blocking nets. each fish collection was operated with a uniform sampling effort (ap- proximately 30- min sampling time for each 50- m sampling segment) by the same three persons, one operating the electro- fishing unit and the other two capturing fishes. fishes were identified in the field to species, counted and returned to the sampling sites if alive. we characterised the physical habitat of each sampling site by six habitat variables, including wetted width (m), water depth (m), current velocity (m/s), and substrate coarseness and heterogeneity. wetted width was measured along five transects equally spacing across the stream channel. water depth was measured at four equal interval points along each transect. current velocity was taken at 60% of water depth at each point (fp111, usa). substrate was quantified with a 1- m lead core divided into 10- cm sections, using the frequency size- class method of bain (1999). mean and standard deviation of dominant substrate values were regarded as indices of substrate coarseness and heterogeneity respectively. 2.3 | diversity index calculation diversity index of fishes used in this study included α diversity and β diversity. according to the fishes collected twice (during may and     |  435 october) at each sampling site, we determined the overall species composition and species richness for each site. local species richness was regarded as α diversity, which measures the within- community diversity of fishes. β diversity was estimated by the sørensen similarity index: β = (b + c)/(2a + b + c), where a is the number of species shared by the two assemblages, and b and c are the number of species unique to each assemblage. β diversity was calculated independently for each study stream. because one aim of this study was to determine how β diversity varied along the upstream–downstream gradient, we used the mean sørensen index between one specific assemblage and all other assemblages as the mean β diversity of this specific assemblage. 2.4 | data analysis we used pearson’s correlation to test the linear correlation be- tween physical habitat and distance from headwaters, which was calculated from the anhui province land- use data sets of 1:100,000 scales in 2010. mean of each habitat variable collected twice (dur- ing may and october) was used to describe the habitat character- istic of each site. because both α and β diversity of fishes varied along the upstream–stream gradient, we classified all sampling sites within each study stream into three groups of segments according to the distance from headwaters, including the upper (0–20 km of distance), middle (20–30 km) and lower segments (30–40 km). then, we used one- way anova to test the among- stream variation in both α and β diversity for the three segments independently. the student- newman- keuls test was used for post hoc comparisons after anova. to determine the spatial variations in both α and β diversity along the upstream–downstream gradient, we examined figure 1 map of the headwater streams upper the chencun reservoir of the huangshan mountain (black circles indicated the sampling sites) 436  |     li et al. the correlation between diversity index and the distance from head- waters. first, we expected to use the simple linear model to describe the “diversity–distance” relationship. pearson’s correlation was used to test this diversity–distance relationship, of which statistical sig- nificance was accepted at p < .05. second, if the “diversity–distance” relationship was not significant, we used curve estimation to test how diversity index vary with distance data. according to r value of each model, we determined the optimal model that explained the most spatial variation of diversity index. independent and depend- ent variables were all log(x+1) transformed to meet assumptions of multivariate normality and to moderate the influence of outliers. the spss 22.0 statistics package (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) was used to perform the statistical analysis. 10 3 |

decreased downstream, such as current velocity (with an exception of that in the puxi stream) and substrate coarseness. but water depth and canopy (except for in the maxi stream) showed no significant correlation with the distance from headwaters (figure 2). at the lower reaches of the study streams, the shuxi stream showed higher wetted width, substrate coarseness and heterogeneity than that in

composition a total of 30 species were collected in this study, representing 10 families and four orders. species of family cyprinidae comprised, on average, 57.1% of total species richness; 26, 25 and 23 species were collected from the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream respectively. the 30 species differed in their habitat preference. fifteen spe- cies were the native fishes preferring lotic conditions in the upland headwater streams, such as zacco platypus, acrossocheilus fasciatus and vanmanenia stenosoma. other 15 species often preferred lentic conditions at the lowland areas, such as carassius auratus, abbottina rivularis and pseudorasbora parva, which was defined as the “native invader” by chu, wang, zhu et al. (2015); 15, 11 and 10 native species were collected in the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream, and 11, 14 and 13 invasive species were collected in the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream respectively. in overall, most native species showed relatively higher frequency of occurrence in the shuxi stream and some invasive spe- cies were more frequent in the maxi and puxi stream (table 1). 3.3 | α diversity the mean α diversity was 8.0 ± 1.0 (mean ± sd) species (shuxi), 7.0 ± 1.1 species (maxi) and 7.5 ± 1.1 (puxi). after dividing each stream surveyed into the upper, middle and lower segments, we found that α diversity did not show significant among- stream variation at upper (one- way anova, f = 0.67, p > .05) and middle segments (f = 0.89, p > .05), but differed significantly at the lower segments (f = 5.27, p < .05), of which α diversity in the shuxi stream was higher than that in the maxi and puxi stream (p < .05). pearson’s correlation analysis showed that linear “α diversity– distance from headwaters” relationship was significant in the shuxi stream (r2 = .56, p < .01), of which α diversity increased downstream significantly (figure 3). however, this linear diversity–distance correla- tion was not significant in the maxi and puxi stream (p > .05). after curve estimation, we found that the quadratic model explained the most variation in α diversity in the maxi (r2 = .89, p < .01) and puxi stream (r2 = .87, p < .01). α diversity increased downstream, obtained its maximum at the middle reach and decreased in the lower reach (figure 3). 3.4 | β diversity the mean β diversity was 0.48 ± 0.03 in the shuxi stream, 0.67 ± 0.05 in the maxi stream and 0.62 ± 0.04 in the puxi stream respectively. β diversity showed significant among- stream variation at the middle (one- way anova, f = 13.17, p < .01) and lower segments (f = 16.07, p < .01), not at the upper segment (f = 1.52, p > .05). β diversity was lower in the shuxi stream than that in the maxi and puxi stream (p < .05). according to pearson’s correlation analysis, linear “β diversity– distance from headwaters” relationship was significant in the shuxi stream, of which β diversity decreased downstream significantly (r2 = .52, p < .05) (figure 3). however, this linear relationship was not     |  437 table 1 the frequency of occurrence of fishes collected in the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream species/family/order shuxi maxi puxi cypriniformes cyprinidae zacco platypusa carassius auratus opsarrichthys bidensa phoxinus oxycephalusa rhodeus ocellatus acheilognathus barbatulusa acrossocheilus fasciatusa pseudorasbora parva sarcocheilichthys parvus squalidus argentatus abbottina rivularis hemiculter leucisculus pseudohemiculter dispar pseudogobio vaillantia onychostoma barbatuluma parasinilabeo assimilisa cobitidae cobitis sinensisa cobitis rarusa misgurnus anguillicaudatus leptobotia guiiinensisa homalopteridae 92.86 7.14 28.57 21.42 42.86 28.57 85.71 21.43 7.14 28.57 7.14 14.29 / 35.71 7.14 14.29 42.86 57.14 50.00 21.42 78.57 14.29 7.14 14.29 50.00 21.43 14.29 28.57 14.29 14.29 21.43 7.14 7.14 28.57 / / 14.29 14.29 57.14 21.43 90.91 27.27 36.36 / 45.45 / 63.64 45.45 9.09 36.36 18.18 / / 27.27 9.09 / 54.46 9.09 54.55 36.36 vanmanenia stenosomaa 85.71 28.57 / perciformes mastacembelidae mastacembelus aculeatus 14.29 28.57 27.27 channidae channa argus electridae odontobutis obscura hypseleotris swinhonis gobiidae ctenogobius sp.a siuriformes amblycipitidae liobagrus styania bagridae / / / / 18.18 50.00 7.14 9.09 9.09 100.00 71.43 81.82 35.71 / / pseudobagrus truncatesa pelteobagrus fulvidraco 14.29 / / 14.29 18.18 18.18 synbranchiformes synbranchidae monopterus albus 14.29 21.43 9.09 athe species preferring lotic conditions in upland headwater streams. other fishes were the species often preferring lentic conditions in lowland areas, and these species were defined as the “native invader” by chu, wang, zhu et al.

(2010) found β diversity of stream fishes positively relate to elevation ranging from 1,750 to 1,000 m at the colombian andes. tisseuil et al. (2013) discovered an overall pattern of decreasing beta diversity along the upstream–downstream river gradient in the adour- garonne basin. we found that β diversity of fishes in the shuxi stream showed nega- tively correlation with the distance from headwater, which supported our hypothesis that β diversity of fishes decrease downstream along the “upstream–downstream” gradient in a stream disturbed less. compared with fishes distributed at the lower reaches of streams, fishes upstream are characterised by simple composition and high en- demism, suggesting a pattern of low α diversity but high β diversity of fish assemblages upstream (meyer et al., 2007; scott & helfman, 2001). for example, in the qingyi watershed, phoxinus oxycephalus and onychostoma barbatulum are the cold- water species, only dis- tributed at stream headwaters with high elevation (chu, wang, zhu et al., 2015; wang et al., 2013; yan, xiang, chu, zhan, & fu, 2011). in this study, the two species were only collected at two sampling sites at headwaters of the shuxi stream, which can increase the rate of species turnover from upstream assemblages to midstream and/or downstream assemblages, and can further result in a relatively higher β diversity of upstream assemblages. anthropogenic activities, such as urbanisation, agriculture and river regulation, may alter hydrologic rhythm, flowing and thermal regimes, nutrient and sediment input, physical and chemical condi- tions (allan, 2004; diana, allan, & infante, 2006; paul & meyer, 2001; strayer et al., 2003). following habitat modification, many endemic species are replaced by some cosmopolitan species of fishes (allan, 2004; chu, wang, yan et al., 2015; li et al., 2016; morgan & cushman, 2005; wang et al., 2001; yan, wang, zhu, chu, & chen, 2013). this species loss and gain may modify α diversity of local assemblages (mckinney, 2002). in this study area, the maxi and puxi stream are heavily polluted by cod, nh3- n and tp. the amounts of these pollut- ants are approximately twice as much that emitted in the shuxi stream (li et al., 2014). in addition, the three streams show different propor- tions in land use of urbanisation and agriculture. the proportions of urban land and farmland are the highest in the puxi stream (9.32% urban land and 11.12% farmland), the medium in the maxi stream (3.13% urban land and 8.08% farmland) and the lowest in the shuxi stream (0.63% urban land and 3.67% farmland) (lu et al., 2014). we found that the shuxi stream had more native fishes (15 species) and less invasive fishes (11 species), but the maxi and puxi stream showed less native fishes (11 species, maxi; 10 species, puxi) and more inva- sive fishes (14 species, maxi; 13 species, puxi). because of native spe- cies loss outnumbering invasive species gain, anthropogenic activities lead to the decrease in the overall and mean α diversity of fishes in the streams disturbed heavily. also, we found that the two streams dis- turbed heavily showed higher mean β diversity than that in the stream disturbed less, which is due to that the processes of endemic species losing and cosmopolitan species gaining may alter the rate of species turnover from place to place (tisseuil et al., 2013). li et al. however, the above among- stream variation in both α and β diver- sity occurred only at the mid- downstream, not the upstream segments of these study streams, which may be associated with two causes, at least, as follows. first, lu et al. (2014) have reported that the propor- tions of urban and farm lands within the basins of the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream increase gradually following slope decreasing. for exam- ple, the relative area of urban land in the puxi stream is 0.08% (>25° slope), 0.37% (15–25°), 1.53% (6–15°) and 7.33% (<6°) respectively (lu et al., 2014). we believe that anthropogenic disturbance may be too less to induce the replacement of endemic species by cosmopoli- tan species at the upstream segments. but this replacement can occur at the mid- downstream segments due to relatively heavy disturbance. second, the invasive fishes collected in this study, named the “native invader” by chu, wang, zhu et al. (2015), are from the lower reach of this study basin (i.e., the qingyi river), especially from the chencun reservoir, into which the shuxi, maxi and puxi stream flow (chu, wang, zhu et al. 2015). therefore, we consider that it is difficult for the invasive fishes to pass through some geographic obstacles, such as steep segment with high slope and even waterfalls, and to invade the upstream segments. this may also explain why no obvious replace- ment of endemic species by cosmopolitan species occurs in assem- blages upstream, whereas, because of no obvious geographic obstacle constraining the movements of fishes, it is easy for the invasive fishes to immigrate from stream mouth to the mid- downstream segments, at which invasive species will replace endemic species. this replacement process increases the mean between- assemblage dissimilarity and β di- versity of fishes at mid- downstream segments. also, because endemic species losing outnumbers cosmopolitan species gaining, this replace- ment process decreases local species richness and α diversity of fishes at downstream segments. furthermore, this sharp decrease in α diver- sity and sharp increase in β diversity at the lower segments will alter the upstream–downstream patterns of both α and β diversity, which supports our hypothesis that the spatial patterns of α and β diversity may shift from their natural patterns in the streams disturbed heavily. it has been well established that local fish assemblages in streams are not only determined by abiotic factors and historical events (hoeinghaus, winemiller, & birnbaum, 2007), but also influenced by fish movement, such as fish immigration and/or emigration (taylor & warren, 2001). at a watershed scale, a stream can be viewed as a dendritic ecological network, among which the abiotic and biotic fac- tors and their ecological processes are often spatially autocorrelated due to between- segment continuity (campbell- grant, lowe, & fagan, 2007). many researchers do not account for spatial and/or temporal dependence, and use tradition statistical tests, such as anova and correlation analysis used in this study, to determine the spatial and/or temporal variations in fish assemblages in streams. however, a simpli- fying but necessary component in the derivation of many traditional statistical tests is that the data being analysed are independent, and the statistical consequences of not accounting for spatial/temporal dependence can be severe (carroll & pearson, 2000). if the data are positively, spatially autocorrelated, the variance estimates are often biased downward (underwood, 1997), and the coefficient of determi- nation in regression analysis is biased upward (haining, 1990). in this     |  439 study, we used a common anova to test the among- stream variation in fish diversity, and used linear correlation and curve estimation to examine the “fish diversity–distance from headwaters” relationship. therefore, the among- stream variations in both α and β diversity may be biased downward (underwood, 1997), and the correlation coeffi- cient and significance of “diversity–distance” relationship may be bi- ased upward (haining, 1990). one aim of this study was to determine the among- stream variations in fish diversity and to assess how an- thropogenic disturbance affected fish diversity in streams. we found the significant variation in fish diversity in the heavily disturbed seg- ments compared to that in the less disturbed segments. given that the traditional statistical test (i.e., anova) will bias downward the vari- ance estimation, potential larger among- stream variation in diversity may occur in this study area. however, this potential bias does not conflict with our conclusion that anthropogenic disturbance decreases α diversity but increases β diversity of fishes in streams. the other aim of this study was to determine the “upstream–downstream” pattern in fish diversity and to assess the effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the longitudinal distribution of fish diversity in streams. we found that the linear “diversity–distance from headwaters” relationship in the less disturbed stream is replaced by the quadratic distribution in the heavily disturbed streams. in future research, geostatistical tech- niques (e.g., correlogram, variogram and kriging model) may provide further insights into the dependence of the data on fish assemblages collected in field and spatial and/or temporal variations of fish assem- blages in streams. in conclusion, we found that α diversity gradually increase down- stream and β diversity decrease downstream along the upstream– downstream gradient in a stream disturbed less, which suggests the different spatial patterns between α diversity and β diversity along the environmental gradient. anthropogenic activities cause that many endemic fishes are replaced by cosmopolitan fishes in streams dis- turbed heavily. this replacement alters the rate of species turnover of fishes from place to place, and substantially increases the between- assemblage dissimilarity of fishes. because of endemic species loss outnumbering cosmopolitan species, this replacement substantially decreases α diversity in these streams. also, associated with the spa- tial heterogeneity in anthropogenic disturbance along the longitudi- nal gradient in streams and the spatial accessibility for native- invasive fishes to immigrate, this replacement mainly occurs only at the mid- downstream, not upstream reaches of streams. as a result, we can observe α diversity decreasing and β diversity increasing at the mid- downstream reaches, which may further alters the upstream–down- stream patterns of α diversity and β diversity in streams disturbed heavily. acknowledgements we thank dr. jun xu from institute of hydrobiology, chinese academy of sciences for his constructive suggestions on the early draft. we thank three anonymous
