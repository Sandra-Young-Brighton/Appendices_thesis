sciences, university of helsinki, helsinki, finland abstract – seasonal variation in light intensity has strong impacts on invertebrate and vertebrate habitat selection creating trade-offs between foraging gain and risk of death. diel vertical migration (dvm) has received a particularly interest, but multitrophic level studies in lakes under polar light regime have not been conducted. here, we examined habitat selection of pelagic zooplankton, planktivores and piscivores in subarctic lake muddusja¨rvi with polymorphic whiteﬁsh (coregonus_lavaretus (l.)). seasonal change in light was hypothesized to be the most important abiotic factor inducing dvm, whereas predation was considered as an ultimate biotic factor. during period of mid-night sun in june, no dvm was observed at any trophic level, whereas during normal day and night light in september planktivores and zooplankton migrated. dvm was top-down controlled, where piscivorous brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) used pelagic habitat continuously inducing dvm of its main prey, pelagic whiteﬁsh morph, which cascaded to reverse dvm of zooplankton. top-down control of lower trophic level dvms by piscivores might be more general pattern in lakes than previously considered. key words: brown_trout; diet; habitat; predation; trophic interactions; whiteﬁsh k. kahilainen, department of biological and environmental

predation has a fundamental structuring role in ecosystems. the direct effects are related to the predation induced mortality of prey, which has an impact on prey population density, biomass and size structure. the indirect effects include changes in prey behaviour, which may have both short-term effects e.g. on habitat selection and longer-term effect on growth and fecundity (lima 1998). in the ecosystem scale, predation has a central role in structuring the food web and effects may extend over multiple trophic levels (carpenter & kitchell 1993). one such preda- tion induced effect is the habitat selection of prey species, which is often a trade-off between the foraging gain and risk of death (werner & hall 1988). the foraging efﬁciency of visually oriented predator ﬁsh is usually positively correlated with light intensity, but has large interspeciﬁc and trophic position variations (confer et al. 1978; mazur & beauchamp 2003). in aquatic ecosystems, this strong relationship between light intensity and foraging efﬁciency in ﬁshes is especially likely to induce diel and seasonal migrations in lower trophic levels. diel vertical migration (dvm) of pelagic inverte- brates and vertebrates has inspired researchers over the last 100 years and considerable progress has been achieved by examination of both abiotic and biotic factors. change in the light level is the key abiotic factor prompting dvm through the water column (clark & levy 1988; lampert 1989), but ﬁeld studies in arctic or subarctic lakes, which are subject to continuous daylight during the polar midsummer and have a distinct diel light cycle only during spring and autumn, have been surprisingly scarce (but see buchanan & haney 1980). furthermore, the marine doi:

kaartvedt 2000; fortier et al. 2001; blachowiak-samolyk et al. 2006; berge et al. 2009). the controversy of the presence or the absence of dvm during midnight sun or polar night is obviously due to limited sampling of higher trophic levels, especially ﬁsh predators, that is essen- tial for conclusive evaluation of the predation risks prevailing in food webs. predation risk is considered as the major biotic factor behind dvm in zooplankton (stich & lampert 1981; gliwicz 1986), but the actual trophic level (invertebrate predators, planktivores or piscivores) that ultimately controls zooplankton dvm has rarely been explored. cascading behavioural interactions among multiple trophic levels in food web are potentially important, as dvm has been observed at trophic levels adjacent to zooplankton i.e. phytoplankton (frempong 1981) and within many planktivores (janssen & brandt 1980; clark & levy 1988; appenzeller & leggett 1995). in general, planktivorous ﬁsh are considered to induce normal zooplankton migrations i.e. zooplankton spend the day at deeper low light environment with reduced ﬁsh predation. at night, when the foraging efﬁciency of planktivores is lowered, zooplankton ascend to forage on phytoplankton (lampert 1993). in contrast, invertebrate predators induce reverse migration, where during daytime zooplankton forage in the vicinity of the surface and descend to deeper water layers at night when predators ascend closer to the surface (ohman et al. 1983). however, most studies have focussed on the single trophic level, whereas the pelagic food web is typically more complex and studies including all trophic levels are needed to evaluate the ultimate causes of dvm (see jensen et al. 2006; gjelland 2008). the main problem in such conclusive dvm studies is that even in temperate lakes pelagic food webs can be complex and statistically relevant sam- pling of higher trophic levels is not usually performed due to time and ﬁnancial constraints. ideally, dvm patterns should be studied with experimental manip- ulations, but in practice it is impossible to include pelagic piscivores in experiments due to space constraints. subarctic lakes provide excellent natural systems to reveal the major patterns in food web structure and dvm due to limited species richness and strong seasonality in light intensity. most of the lakes were formed after the last ice age within a timeframe of circa 10,000 years, and many of them support poly- morphic ﬁsh populations across both old and new world (robinson & wilson 1994). parallel divergence patterns have been reported even in distantly related ﬁsh species, where in many lakes one pelagic (or limnetic) and one benthic morph are found (schluter & 482 mcphail 1993). in contrast to this general pattern, in some lakes, european whiteﬁsh (coregonus_lavaretus (l.)) has radiated into different morphs exploiting and dominating all major lake habitats i.e. littoral, pelagic and profundal zones (sva¨rdson 1979; bernatchez 2004; kahilainen et al. 2004; østbye et al. 2006). despite a rapidly accumulating literature on polymor- phic ﬁsh, multiple trophic levels have rarely been taken into account in polymorphic whiteﬁsh systems, we have previously shown that the sympatric pelagic morph, densely rakered (dr) whiteﬁsh, is the main predator of pelagic zooplankton (kahilainen et al. 2005), whilst brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) is the main predator of dr whiteﬁsh (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002; jensen et al. 2008). however, conclusive studies of dvm in multiple trophic levels have not been previously explored for polymorphic ﬁsh ecosystems. in niche selection studies. to address these questions, we used a well-studied subarctic lake ecosystem to (i) test whether the polar light regime governs the diel and seasonal timing of dvm at various trophic levels and (ii) determine the role of predation in dvm. first, we tested whether the light intensity is the most important abiotic factor, and predicted that during the period of continuous light (i.e. midnight sun) no dvm occurs by either zoo- plankton, planktivore, or piscivore. we further hypoth- esized that dvm would be pronounced across all trophic levels during autumn, which is a period of distinct differences in light intensity between day and night. second, we tested whether predation is the ultimate biotic factor in dvm, and extended the hypothesis to include three trophic levels (primary, secondary and tertiary consumers). third, we hypoth- esized that brown_trout predation represents the factor instigating migration at all lower trophic levels, and thus indicating the presence of top-down control. materials and methods study area lake muddusja¨rvi (hereafter l. muddus) is a large )1, (area 48 km2) oligotrophic (total phosphorus 5 lg l )1) subarctic lake in northern total nitrogen 160 lg l finland (fig. 1). the maximum and average depth is 73 m and 8.5 m, respectively. secchi depth is circa 3 m during open water season (due to humic sub- stances) and light compensation depth i.e. where 1% of surface light remains is 8 m. l. muddus has a relatively equal proportion of (59%) and pelagic (41%) habitat (fig. 1). profundal habitat accounts 41% of surface area according to compen- sation depth. profundal is characterized as dark habitat below pelagial without macrophytes and insigniﬁcant amount of primary production. in contrast, littoral and littoral (a) (b) (c) dvm patterns in a subarctic lake fig. 1. map of northern fennoscandia (a), subarctic paatsjoki watercourse

of ellipse shows zooplankton and abiotic (light, temperature, oxygen) sampling points. black lines are the echosounding transects used for the estimation of vertical distribution of whiteﬁsh. pelagic habitats have higher light intensities facilitat- ing primary production. the ﬁsh fauna of l. muddus consists of ten species: whiteﬁsh, brown_trout, arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus (l.)), grayling (thymallus_thymallus (l.)), perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.), pike (esox lucius l.), burbot (lota lota (l.)), minnow (phoxinus phoxinus (l.)), three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus l.) and nine-spined stickleback (pungitius pungitius (l.)). whiteﬁsh is the most numerous species, and has diverged into three sympatric morphs named according to body size and gillraker traits: small sparsely rakered (ssr), large sparsely rakered (lsr) and dr whiteﬁsh (kahilainen et al. 2004). dr whiteﬁsh is the most abundant morph (78%) followed by lsr whiteﬁsh (14%) and ssr whiteﬁsh (8%) (kahilainen & lehtonen 2003). dr whiteﬁsh is the only pelagic morph, whereas other morphs are benthic (kahilainen et al. 2004). lsr whiteﬁsh use littoral habitats and ssr whiteﬁsh dwell in profundal areas (kahilainen et al. 2003). brown_trout are the most abundant pelagic piscivore that use dr whiteﬁsh as their main prey (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002). field sampling field sampling was conducted under contrasting diel light cycles: 1) during the middle of the midnight sun period in june (24 h light:0 h dark), and 2) during september, when day and night length (12 h light: 12 h dark) are approximately equal (gjelland et al. 2004). in this study, we used datasets from june 2003 and september 2002. a part of september 2002 data has been published in different context (kahilainen et al. 2007). previous research experience from the l. muddus ecosystem has revealed strong similarities among different years (kahilainen et al. 2004, 2005, 2007), and the effect of different sampling years is likely to be minimal. zooplankton were sampled at noon (12.00) and midnight (00.00) from a central point (distance from the closest shoreline circa 800 m) located at the northern part of the main basin, where water depth was 12 m (fig. 1). samples were taken from surface to bottom at 1 m intervals using a tube sampler (length 1 m, volume 7.1 l). three replicate samples were taken with a distance of 15–20 m between each point. samples were immediately sieved through a zooplankton net (mesh size 50 lm) and subsequently preserved in a 5% formalin solution. abiotic sampling was conducted from a single sam- pling point (fig. 1). experimental gillnettings were conducted adjacent to the zooplankton sampling stations during the day and night in june and september using a multimesh gillnet set (total length 240 m and 1.8 m height). the gillnet set was randomly combined from eight nets having mesh sizes 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45 and 60 mm (from knot to knot) and equal sets were simultaneously used in pelagic (depth 0–8 m) and profundal benthic (>8 m) zones. this small-sized net series catch mainly whiteﬁsh and we used a larger net series to catch piscivorous brown_trout. this predator net series consisted of ﬁve nets each 5 m high and 60 m long with mesh sizes 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 mm (knot to knot). due to the low productivity of l. muddus, it is impossible to collect sufﬁcient ﬁsh data during a single diel cycle. hence, we combined diel habitat data of whiteﬁsh and brown_trout collected in june or september in years 1999–2003 (for details, see kahilainen & lehtonen 2002; kahilainen et al. 2004). for brown_trout, we used this larger dataset from june (n = 145) and september (n = 214) also in diet analyses. according to previous results in this area, the habitat and diet selection patterns of brown_trout are similar among years (kahilainen & lehtonen 2001, 2002, 2003; jensen et al. 2008). diel and seasonal habitat selection of whiteﬁsh morphs is highly consistent among different years indicated in combined results of experimental ﬁshing and echo- 483 kahilainen et al. sounding (kahilainen et al. 2004, 2007; jensen et al. 2008). the total number of whiteﬁsh individuals caught during gillnettings (1999–2003) in june and september was 1485 and 1864, respectively. gillnets were set either at daytime (circa 9.00–15.00) or at night-time (circa 21.00–3.00) to the pelagic and profundal habitats. the total number of gillnet sam- pling occasions, i.e. times of gillnets set into the lake, for whiteﬁsh and brown_trout was 87 and 123, respectively (table 1). whiteﬁsh morphs were identiﬁed in the ﬁeld according to differences in appearance and morphol- ogy of gillrakers (kahilainen & østbye 2006). dr whiteﬁsh has the highest number, the longest and the most densely spaced gillrakers of different whiteﬁsh morphs. dr whiteﬁsh has slender body shape, pointed snout and almost equal upper and lower jaw lengths (kahilainen & østbye 2006). after identiﬁcation, the total length and weight were measured with an accuracy of 1 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. fish samples were subsequently frozen at )20 °c and diet was analyzed later in laboratory. whiteﬁsh habitat use during day and night was examined also with vertical hydroacoustics by using a simrad ey-500 -echoso- under equipped with a split-beam transducer es120- 7f (details in kahilainen et al. 2004). three parallel echosounding transects (in the vicinity of zooplankton sampling stations, fig. 1) were sampled at noon and midnight in june 2003 and september 2002, in order to reveal whiteﬁsh dvm in the water column. abiotic sampling and zooplankton migrations we used light measurements at noon to calculate the depth of the pelagic ⁄ euphotic layer i.e. the depth where >1% of surface light is available. we considered that the bulk of primary producers i.e. phytoplankton is situated above this depth and that this layer should be for herbivorous zooplankton. in addition, we measured levels of uv the most preferred habitat table 1. the average habitat-speciﬁc stomach fullness values (scale 0–10, 0 = empty, 10 = extended full), and the number of times that gillnets were

(300–400 nm) and visual (400–700 nm) light at noon and midnight in the water column (ramses acc-vis photometer). we also measured water temperature and oxygen proﬁles throughout the water column (ysi- 6600 sonde). zooplankton samples were later ana- lyzed in the laboratory using a light microscope. the most abundant species in the samples were bosmina coregoni, b. longirostris, daphnia cristata, d. longiremis, cyclops scutifer and eudia- ptomus graciloides. the total length of the ﬁrst 30 individuals of each species per zooplankton sample was measured, if possible. the total number of individuals per sample was counted and pooled into four main taxa: cyclopoida, calanoida, bosmina spp. and daphnia spp. zooplankton densities were calcu- lated using 2 m high layers through the water column. for statistical analyses, we calculated the proportion of zooplankton density in each depth layer relative to that of the whole water column. fish migrations dvm was studied using proportions of ﬁsh caught in the pelagic and profundal habitats during day and night. the vertical distribution of whiteﬁsh was also studied with echo integrals (area backscattering strength, sa) from two water layers: pelagic (from 3 m below the surface to 2 m above the bottom) and benthic zone (from 0.2 m to 2 m above the bottom). sa-values were computed with ep 500-software (lin- dem data acquisition, 1995) and they should indicate the vertical distribution of whiteﬁsh accurately, as sa-values are linearly proportional to ﬁsh density (maclennan & simmonds 1992) and the proportion of other and nine-spined stickleback) was negligible (4–6%) in the catches (kahilainen et al. 2004). the catch of pelagic trawl surveys during previous studies consisted almost exclu- sively on dr whiteﬁsh and other whiteﬁsh morphs were almost never caught (kahilainen et al. 2004). (brown_trout species laboratory analyses of ﬁsh stomachs were removed and food categories identiﬁed to order or family level. individual diet was analysed using the points method (hynes 1950), where the proportions of different food categories contributing to the total stomach fullness were estimated. stomach fullness was estimated using a scale from 0 to 10, where a score of 0 is an empty stomach and a score of 10 indicates an extended, full stomach. for brown_trout, only piscivorous individuals i.e. length >30 cm (kahilainen & lehtonen 2001; jensen et al. 2008), were taken into analyses. in brown_trout diet, whiteﬁsh prey was identiﬁed to morph according to gill raker morphology, if possible. feeding selectivity of dr whiteﬁsh and brown_trout for zooplankton and white- ﬁsh morph prey only was calculated by using ivlev’s (1961) electivity index: ð e ¼ ri   pi ri þ pi ð þ þ ; where e is the electivity of whiteﬁsh or brown_trout, ri is the proportion of zooplankton group or whiteﬁsh morph i in the diet of whiteﬁsh or brown_trout r, pi is the proportion of zooplankton group ⁄ whiteﬁsh morph i in the environment. the index gives values from )1 to +1, where )1 indicates avoidance and +1 indicates active selection of prey. a value of 0 indicates whiteﬁsh selection of the prey item according to its prevalence in the lake environment. values from )0.3 to 0.3 were considered equal to 0 (lazzaro 1987). statistics analysis of variance (anova) was used for compar- ison of brown_trout, whiteﬁsh and zooplankton vertical distributions in water column at day and night-time. in vertical distribution comparisons time (day or night) and habitat ⁄ depth zone (pelagic or benthic ⁄ depth layer) were used as factors. data transformations were employed for cpue data sets [log(x + 1)] as well as for zooplankton vertical distribution (arcsinöx). pair- wise comparisons were made using tukey’s hsd tests. the mann–whitney u-test was used to compare whiteﬁsh density between day and night time esti- mated with echosounding. the differences between the day- and night-time stomach fullness were com- pared using anova and pairwise comparisons were performed with tukey’s hsd tests. results were considered as statistically signiﬁcant when p < 0.05, but we also indicated higher signiﬁcance levels using p < 0.01 and 0.001. results dvm the ambient light intensities had pronounced differ- ences between june and september (fig. 2). in june, light intensity in the whole water column was high at noon (min. 91 lux at depth 12 m). at midnight, there was no distinguishable darkness, but light intensity was lower in the whole water column than during the daytime (min. 3 lux at depth of 12 m). in contrast, during september light levels were differentiated into distinct periods of day and night. at noon, light intensity was high on the surface, and decreased towards the lake bed (min. 88 lux at 12 m), whereas at midnight light levels were ca. 0 lux throughout the entire water column. in both months, the depth at which 1% of surface light remained was located at a dvm patterns in a subarctic lake depth of 8 m at noon, deﬁning a border between pelagic and profundal zones. there was no uv- radiation (300–400 nm) below 1 m depth in june and in september. temperature and oxygen proﬁles indi- cated no stratiﬁcation in study months. in june and september, water column (0–12 m) temperatures had a range of 6.9–7.0 °c and 8.5–8.7 °c, respectively. similarly, oxygen levels in june and september had a )1, range of 12.2 –13.2 mg l respectively. taken collectively, diel ﬂuctuations in light intensity represented the most pronounced abiotic variable in both study months. )1 and 12.8–13.1 mg l (anova, f1,70 = 0.0, p = 0.95). in june, brown_trout used both pelagic and benthic habitats (fig. 2). the differences between day and night brown_trout cpues in pelagic and benthic were not signiﬁcant in contrast, dr whiteﬁsh dwelled mostly in benthic habitats both at noon and midnight. dr whiteﬁsh cpue’s were different between habitats (anova, f1,50 = 9.3, p < 0.01). benthic cpues were signiﬁ- cantly higher than those from pelagic habitats (tukey’s hsd test, p < 0.01). the preference of dr whiteﬁsh for benthic habitat was even more pronounced in echosounding data; no targets were detected during the day or night in the pelagic zone of the lake (fig. 2). according to benthic gillnet catches, the majority of dr whiteﬁsh were situated so close to the benthic sediment that they were impossible to be detected with echosounder. zooplankton taxa had a quite homoge- nous distribution in water column, and most of the individuals (55–79%) were located in the pelagic zone i.e. depth above 8 m. no signiﬁcant vertical distribu- tion differences were found between noon and mid- time*depth interactions, p = ns), night except for bosmina (p = 0.03). at noon the proportion of bosmina in depth of 10–12 m was signiﬁcantly higher than in depth of 0–2 m at midnight (tukey’s hsd test, p < 0.05). (anova’s, in september, brown_trout used more pelagic than benthic habitats during both day and night (anova, f1,45 = 6.6, p < 0.05, fig. 2). in contrast, dr white- ﬁsh used more benthic than pelagic habitat (anova, f1,29 = 4.8, p < 0.05). there was also an indication of dvm between benthic and pelagic habitat (anova, f1,29 = 4.9, p < 0.05): during daylight, dr whiteﬁsh tended to use more benthic than pelagic habitats (tukey’s hsd test, p = 0.10). echosounding data indicated that pelagic dr whiteﬁsh density was higher than day (mann–whitney u-test, during night p < 0.05). all zooplankton taxa displayed evidence of regular migrations (anova’s, time*depth interac- tions, p < 0.001), except daphnia. at noon, the lowest abundance for all taxa was recorded in the vicinity of the lake bottom (fig. 2). daytime abundance of bosmina, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods at the surface layer was signiﬁcantly higher than at night 485 kahilainen et al. fig. 2. variation in light level and vertical distribution of ﬁsh and zooplankton at noon (white bars) and midnight (black bars) in june and september. from left to right, proportional habitat distribution of brown_trout (bt) and dr whiteﬁsh (dr) calculated from the gillnet cpues and dr whiteﬁsh density calculated from the vertical echosounding data (no targets observed in june). habitat distribution of major zooplankton taxa in 2 m deep water layers of water column. the last column indicates the measured light level (lux) at noon and midnight (also as numbers).

(including adults and pupae), whereas individuals caught from benthic zone had consumed cyclopoida and bosmina, of which the latter was highly preferred (fig. 3, the feeding activity of dr table 2). generally, whiteﬁsh in june was higher in well-illuminated pelagic areas compared to benthic regions (table 1, anova, f1,153 = 33.3, p < 0.001). habitat-speciﬁc comparisons (anova, f1,153 = 8.7, p < 0.01) revealed that stomach fullness was the lowest in benthic habitats during night (tukey’s hsd tests, p < 0.05). in june, brown_trout preyed on dr whiteﬁsh in all the habitat types, whereas ssr and lsr whiteﬁsh were not found in brown_trout stomachs (fig. 3, table 2). hence, brown_trout prey selection seemed to reﬂect prey availability in the lake environment (table 2). brown_trout stomach fullness was higher during day than night (table 1, anova, f1,141 = 5.5, p < 0.05), but other comparisons were not signiﬁcant. in september, diet selection of dr whiteﬁsh and brown_trout did not vary in relation to habitat type or sampling period (fig. 3). dr whiteﬁsh was highly planktivorous, consuming more bosmina than cope- pods and avoiding daphnia (table 2). similarly to june, dr whiteﬁsh stomach fullness was signiﬁcantly higher in pelagic than benthic samples (table 1, anova, f1,152 = 19.7, p < 0.001). the stomach full- ness of dr whiteﬁsh was higher during day than night (table 1, anova, f1,152 = 14.9, p < 0.001), but no habitat-speciﬁc differences were detected in septem- ber (p = 0.81). brown_trout prey selection was even more piscivorous than in june, and predation was dvm

(fig. 3). ssr and lsr whiteﬁsh were avoided by brown_trout (table 2). in contrast to june, brown_trout stomach fullness was signiﬁcantly higher during night than day (table 1, anova, f1,210 = 10.7, p < 0.01). discussion habitat selection results from several trophic levels of l. muddus supported the hypotheses that the changes in light induce dvm of planktivores and that preda- tion risk is its most likely ultimate cause (lampert 1993). alternative dvm hypotheses, such as temper- ature-based metabolic advantages and uv-radiation avoidance (mclaren 1963; zaret & suffern 1976; rhode et al. 2001) appear to be unlikely, since the water column had homogenous temperature proﬁles and uv-radiation was extinct below 1 m depth. in contrast, polar regime changed remarkably during a short open-water period clearly inﬂuencing the dvm of zooplankton and planktivores. in this context, predation by ﬁsh was the most likely ultimate cause of zooplankton dvm, since pelagic invertebrate predators are of minor importance compared with planktivorous ﬁsh in the study lake (kahilainen et al. 2003, 2004, 2005). the risk of predation induced by brown_trout in the pelagic zone initiated dvm at lower trophic levels. light the brown_trout is a visual predator that preys on small-sized coregonid ﬁsh in many northern fenno- scandian lakes (vehanen et al. 1998; jensen et al. found in many of 2004, 2008). the fusiform body shape of brown_trout is well-adapted to continuous chasing of prey ﬁsh in the extensive pelagic areas (webb 1984; schulz & berg 1992) these ecosystems. piscivorous brown_trout are located at the apex of the l. muddus pelagic food web, which facilitates a predation risk independent habitat selection during diel cycle and season. brown_trout used well-illumi- nated pelagic habitat in june and september and preyed selectively on dr whiteﬁsh. the majority of the dr whiteﬁsh population is of a size that is vulnerable to predation by brown_trout, and trout predation represents the most important source of dr whiteﬁsh mortality (this study, kahilainen & lehtonen 2002, 2003). our results indicate that diel and seasonal habitat strongly regulated by the risk of predation. dr whiteﬁsh used almost exclusively benthic habitats during periods of daylight when the feeding efﬁciency of visually feeding piscivores is high. in piscivorous salmonids, foraging efﬁciency and reactive distance are strongly based on the light-dependent visual detection of prey, where maximum reactive distances to small prey ﬁsh (75 mm) are obtained at light intensities of 15–20 lux (mazur & beauchamp 2003). in daylight (17.8 lux in water) the reactive distances of lake_trout, salvelinus_namaycush (walbaum), are over four times higher than in dim conditions; 0.17 lux (vogel & beauchamp 1999). assuming that brown_trout’s reactive distances follow the same pattern, the predation risk of dr whiteﬁsh is highly light dependent. in addition to lower light level, the habitat selection in the vicinity of selection by dr whiteﬁsh was 487 kahilainen et al. the bottom provides efﬁcient refuge against pelagic cruising predators such as brown_trout (schulz & berg 1992). pelagic piscivores are also reluctant to attack prey located near a ﬁxed surface, such as benthic sediment (feldman & savitz 1999) and the benthic habitat may also provide refuges via structural com- plexity (werner & hall 1988). this was the most evident strategy of dr whiteﬁsh in june, when the main proportion of ﬁsh was situated along the benthic sediment according to gillnetting results. these ﬁsh could not be detected with echosounder as they were on the bottom blind zone. some larger individuals (>20 cm) above predation window of brown_trout (kahilainen & lehtonen 2003) were caught from pelagic gillnets even in full daylight, but their relative proportion compared to individuals caught from benthic gillnets was low. taken collectively, dr whiteﬁsh habitat selection is obviously a trade-off between risk of death and foraging opportunities. light intensity plays a signiﬁcant role in regulating the foraging efﬁciency of both piscivores and plank- tivores, but species speciﬁc differences are evident (beauchamp et al. 1999; scheuerell & schindler 2003; jensen et al. 2006). the foraging efﬁciency differ- ences between planktivores and piscivores at the same light intensities are especially important in determin- ing the antipredator window for planktivores (clark & levy 1988). for coregonids, the energetically most proﬁtable foraging time in the pelagic zone is during the daytime at high light intensities facilitating the highest foraging efﬁciencies (link & edsall 1996; mayr 2002; ohlberger et al. 2008), but at the same time the prevalence of pelagic brown_trout induces high predation risk. however, whiteﬁsh are able to feed at very low light intensities including also complete darkness (mayr 2002). at these light inten- sities salmonid piscivores are inefﬁcient in foraging (mazur & beauchamp 2003) likely creating antipre- dation window for planktivores (clark & levy 1988; scheuerell & schindler 2003). dr whiteﬁsh habitat selection in september suggested the presence of such antipredation window. the other factor reducing predation is the size refuge of prey. in june, almost all dr whiteﬁsh used benthic habitats and only a few large individuals (>20 cm) beyond the brown_trout predation size threshold used the pelagic zone (this study, kahilainen & lehtonen 2003). these pelagic dr whiteﬁsh individuals also had higher stomach fullness than observed in benthic ones indicating better foraging opportunities. in september nights, when brown_trout foraging efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly lower, the vulnerable-sized dr whiteﬁsh (<20 cm) were able to migrate to the pelagic zone at night to forage on zooplankton. the average stomach fullness of pelagic dr whiteﬁsh individuals was signiﬁcantly higher than that of benthic ones in important 488 september indicating a higher zooplankton resource in the pelagic zone. both results indicated that there was a clear trade-off between foraging gain and mortality risk, where the vulnerable sized dr white- ﬁsh preferred safer habitat. dr whiteﬁsh was the dominant zooplanktivore in the study lake and was responsible for the bulk of cladoceran and copepod mortality (kahilainen et al. 2004, 2005). dr whiteﬁsh habitat selection had a major importance on zooplankton migrations, where zooplankton avoided the same depths as their preda- tors by performing reverse dvm. these results are contradictory to the general pattern that reverse migration of zooplankton is induced by invertebrate predators (lampert 1993). an alternative interpreta- tion for the observed reversed zooplankton migrations (ohman et al. 1983) in september is that dr whiteﬁsh had preyed most of the zooplankton located at the same depths with predator. there is some indication of this at noon in september at the deepest depth layer (10–12 m), but at midnight dr whiteﬁsh had ascended from bottom and were widely distributed in the whole water column. the predation efﬁciency of dr whiteﬁsh should be similar throughout the water column as light intensity was 0 lux and thus all preferred zooplankton taxa should be reduced more or less equally. following this reasoning, the observed day and night distributions of bosmina and calanoids could be explained only by reversed migrations. most of the previous studies (e.g. buchanan & haney 1980; dale & kaartvedt 2000; berge et al. 2009) have overlooked the role of piscivores in controlling the pelagic food web (but see jensen et al. 2006; gjelland 2008) and our results from planktivore dominated ecosystem with reverse zooplankton migrations may be more common than the present scientiﬁc view expects. results indicated a top-down controlled pelagic food web, where habitat selection of brown_trout governs the zooplankton dvm via cascading effects through dr whiteﬁsh foraging habitat selec- tion. seasonal change in the polar light regime was the most obvious abiotic factor governing dvm in both vertebrates and invertebrates. during the period of continuous daylight i.e. the midnight sun, no dvm was observed in zooplankton and ﬁsh, whereas in autumn with distinct day and night both zooplankton and planktivores migrated. predation risk was the ultimate biotic factor inducing dvm, and top-down control of brown_trout was evident. brown_trout as an apex predator was able for predation-independent habitat selection, whereas predation risk determined the habitat selection of lower trophic levels. predation risk induced by brown_trout governed dvm of planktivorous dr whiteﬁsh, which determined the dvm of zooplankton. the present results highlighted the importance of including as many trophic levels as possible to determine ultimate trophic level controlling the dvm of other species. acknowledgements k.k. kahilainen would like to thank biological interactions graduate school as well as finnish cultural, ella and georg ehrnrooth and emil aaltonen foundations
