the aim of this study was to analyse the temporal changes in european silver eels, using a 9-year monitoring programme in the fre´mur river after the passes were installed. material and methods the fre´mur ﬂows into the channel next to saint-malo (brittany). its catchment covers about 60 km2 and the overall length of the river and its tributaries is 45 km, comprising 17 km for the main stream. the slope varies between 0.1% and 2% with an average of 0.6%. despite its small size, the fre´mur contains a wide range of habitats from high-velocity streams typical of the trout zone to lentic waters of the bream zone in downstream areas, man-made ponds and reservoirs, wetlands, etc. fishing pressure is quite low on this river with no commercial eel ﬁsheries and anglers mainly focussing on cyprinids, perch, zander and pike in ponds and reservoirs. upstream migration was monitored daily using an eel trap (see feunteun et al. 2000) from 1996 to 2004. yearly trends in silver eel abundance were analysed using a pearson correlation. the proportions of eels >450 mm were compared using a chi-square test and the simultaneous test procedure according to sokal & rohlf (1981). we collected a subsample of 114 eels (individual size ranged from 311 to 794 mm) in the trap between 2001 and 2003 to estimate ages and sex ratio of eels migrating upstream. we removed and embedded one sagittal otolith per ﬁsh in methacrylate resin. this was ground at the sagittal plane and the nucleus was exposed. then we polished until etched the sagittal surface with 5% edta (mounaix 1993). we interpreted otoliths and deﬁned the age of each eel using scanning electron microscopy (sem, jsm-6301f, jeol, tokyo, japan). the gonads of this subsample were examined macroscopically to deter- mine the sex ratio of eels migrating upstream using the method of colombo et al. (1984). results a total of 6650 silver eels were caught in the downstream migration trap. the mean length (±sd) of descending eels was 441 ± 115 mm (min: 270 mm and max: 1112 mm) (fig. 1). each year, the size structure of silver eel appeared to be bimodal: <450 and >450 mm. the examination of gonads conﬁrmed that the ﬁrst group represents mainly males (during our study only 10% of eels <450 mm were female) and the second exclusively females (fig. 2). the overlap between the male and female size distributions is common in some catchments (haraldstad et al. 1985; vollestad & jonsson 1988; rosell et al. 2005) and eel farms (holmgren 1996). ten per cent of eels caught in the downstream trap were sexually undifferentiated. gonad differentiation of eels usually begins at 150– 250 mm body length, but some individuals as long as 350 mm can still be sexually undifferentiated (bienarz et al. 1981). males were 3–6 years old (mean ± sd: 4.3 ± 0.9 years; but 74% were 4–5 years old) and measured 270–442 mm (372 ± 25 mm). females were 4–9 years old (5.5 ± 1.1 years; but 83% were 4–6 years 366–1112 mm old) (590 ± 97 mm). and measured the total number of descending eels (fig. 3) was relatively stable from 1996 to 1998 (annual mean 811 eels, range 729–885 silver eels). a peak appeared in 1999 (1362 silver eels). between 2001 and 2004, the total number declined 2.5-fold (annual mean 461, range 314–585 silver eels). the decrease from 1999 to 2004 was (pearson’s r ¼ )0.88; p ¼ 0.02) (pearson’s and r ¼ )0.87; p ¼ 0.03). but, the number of males signiﬁcant both in males females 584 fig. 1. population structure of silver eels caught in a downstream trap in the french river fre´mur (brittany) during a 9-year study (1999–2004). n ¼ 6650. sex ratio of silver eel recruitment and catchment characteristics. generally, male silver eels are more abundant at high densities, whereas females predominate at low densities in natural (parsons et al. 1977; vollestad & jonsson 1988; acou et al. in press) and farming conditions (egusa 1979; holmgren 1996). the fre´mur is a small river with high yellow eel densities (mean density 50 eels per 100 m2) in the whole river system (laffaille et al. 2005). consequently, males predominated (on average 69% of catches) in the downstream trap of the fre´mur during the whole study period. the estimated silver eel density was 4.5-fold higher in the fre´mur than in the oir river (normandy, france), a similar small neighbouring catchment (acou et al. in press). silver eels were dominated by females in the oir (79%), where mean density of eel was 16-fold lower (mean density 3 eels per 100 m2). the fre´mur eel densities are very high compared to other french catchments (conseil supe´rieur de la peˆche, personal communication) and west european catchments 585 fig. 2. sex ratio of the silver eel population caught in the downstream trap in relation to size classes. fig. 3. number of silver eels caught in the downstream trap during the 9-year study in relation to the length structure. decreased three times more rapidly than that of females. the emigrating eel population appeared to be dominated by small eels (<450 mm, mainly males) in the fre´mur catchment during the study period. in fact, on average 69% of eels were <450 mm. the larger 31%, i.e., >450 mm, were all females. however, the proportion of eels >450 mm increased signiﬁcantly v2 ¼ 212.78, over p < 0.001; fig. 3). the simultaneous test procedure separated three periods: (i) 1996; (ii) 1997–2000; and (iii) 2001–2004, when large (>450 mm) eels repre- sented, respectively, 17%, 28% and 42% of the total silver eels. in 2002, large eels were dominant (54% of the total silver eels). (chi-square test, the years discussion european eel sex determination has been related to the environment and especially to population density, laffaille et al. (moriarty & dekker 1997). for example, carss et al. (1999) reported that 71% of density estimates at 1462 sites in english rivers and streams were <5 eels per 100 m2. consequently and according to the sex ratio– eel density relationships, female silver eels are certainly dominant in some european catchments. we found a relative stability in the number of silver eels migrating downstream from 1996 to 1998 and a peak in 1999 and 2000 in the fre´mur catchment. one possible explanation for this observed escapement pattern is the provision of the eel-lift on the bois joli reservoir dam in 1992 and then passes on the pont avet and pont es omnes reservoir dams further downstream in 1996. these would have allowed eels that had accumulated below the dams to pass upriver, leading to a rapid but short-lived increase in ﬂuvial recruitment and consequently in densities upstream (feunteun et al. 1998). high densities would favour the production of males and the silver males accounted for 83–70% of catches in the downstream trap during this period. this recruitment–sex ratio relationships is supported by some results and especially because changes in recruitment have been implicated indirectly in sex ratios bias in some experimental lakes, which were stocked with cultured eels (parsons et al. 1977; wickstro¨m et al. 1996; holmgren et al. 1997) and in natural system (rossi et al. 1988; poole et al. 1990). in the fre´mur, the turnover was rapid especially for males. males stayed in the catchment area for 4– 5 years and females for 4–6 years. if the majority of silver males migrate when 4–5 years old, then high silver eel trap catches would be expected 4–5 years after the installation of ﬁsh passes (in 1996), with peaks in 1999 and 2000 as observed. these duration and results were similar to holmgren et al. (1997). during the period 1999–2004, the number of silver eels decreased with the males threefold more rapidly than females. consequently, the proportion of male silver eels has rapidly decreased to 65–46% and inversely females accounted for 42% of total silver eels. one possible explanation is still due to the decline in recruitment observed in the fre´mur (legault et al. 2004). but, there is some evidence suggesting that habitat characteristics may have an indirect role on sex ratio within a catchment. accordingly, eels may choose a habitat that best ﬁts their life history strategy (helfman et al. 1987). environmental sex determin- ation would require that the characteristics of the environment where a young eel ends up determine its ﬁnal size and consequently its sex. indeed, some studies have suggested size–habitat relationships in eels generally, large eels (the future females) are absent or rare in shallow habitats, tending to be found rather in deep waters either in streams (laffaille et al. 2003) or in marsh systems (laffaille et al. 2004). moreover, the proportion of lacustrine habitat in a 586 catchment apparently inﬂuences the sex distribution and plays a role in sex determination (bergersen & klemetsen 1988; oliveira et al. 2001). the total water area in the fre´mur system is approximately 75 ha of which 5 ha is running waters and 70 ha still waters (ponds and reservoirs). the size frequency distribution showed that female yellow eels dominate in still waters and male yellow eels dominate in streams (feunteun et al. 1998). the standing waters of the fre´mur are certainly the principal reservoir for poten- tial females and running waters for potential males. the numbers of female silver eels emigrating may have remained relatively more stable than males in the fre´mur. this may be because the 5 ha of river habitats are saturated at carrying capacity (laffaille et al. 2005), forcing relatively more eels to use the 70 ha of reservoirs (especially bois joli) that produce large eels (i.e., the future females). another possible explanation for the declines in trap catches is the variation in rainfall and river ﬂow. feunteun et al. (2000) found that few eels were caught unless the bois joli reservoir was full and they were able to pass in the ﬂow over the dam, whereas mortality occurred amongst eels passing through the compensation ﬂow discharge pipe (legault et al. 2003). however, rainfall and river ﬂow do not explain the shift in the sex ratio. other factors such as trophic status of the aquatic ecosystem may also inﬂuence sex determination. observations on european eels suggest a causal relationship between feeding conditions and/ or temperature and sex differentiation (lammens & visser 1990; holmgren 1996; beullens et al. 1997). in the fre´mur, there has been an increase in the size of silver eels and change in the sex ratio, possibly related to growth conditions resulting from an increase in the trophic status and water temperature. another possible factor in the shift of the sex ratio is the potential feminisation resulting from pollution by oestrogen-like substances that has been reported in freshwater ﬁsh in some european rivers (see for example jobling et al. 1998). however, the trophic and the chemical water quality has not changed in the fre´mur (guilloue¨t et al. 2004). given the life cycle and relative longevity of the eel, declining recruitment will have a delayed effect on eel densities in freshwater systems and the resulting spawning escapement (dekker 2003). thus, recent declines in recruitment could lead to a continuing reduction in the number of potential spawners such as in the fre´mur river. the problem is the depensatory processes that operate at low stock levels (liermann & hilborn 1997), if for example silver eels ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ﬁnd mates at low spawner densities in the sargasso sea. dekker (2003) suggested that both freshwater and spawning stocks must have declined in parallel, and insufﬁcient spawning stock biomass might have caused the recruitment collapse currently observed. consequently, the observed decrease of the silver eel stocks and gradual shift of silver eel sex ratio from male to female could continue in the forthcoming years. this trend is certainly general throughout the european eel distribution range. these consequences should be taken into account in the global and local management plan. this species is outside safe biolo- gical limits, and therefore, application of the precau- tionary principle approach for the management of the european eel is necessary (russell & potter 2003). this study has established the importance of the silver eel sex ratio monitoring that can now be used in the eel reporting card systems in use at the catchment scale (baisez & laffaille 2005). acknowledgements this study was funded by the ‘fe´de´ration de peˆche et de protection des milieux aquatiques d’ille et vilaine’, the ‘contrat de plan poissons migrateurs’ and various regional and local councils. we thank the anonymous referees for many helpful suggestions. references acou, a., gabriel, g., laffaille, p. & feunteun, e. in press. differential production and condition indices of premigrant eels (anguilla anguilla) in two atlantic coastal catchments of france. american fisheries society symposium ??: ???. baisez, a. & laffaille, p. 2005. un outil d’aide a` la gestion de l’anguille: le tableau de bord anguille du bassin loire. bulletin franc¸ais de la peˆche et de la pisciculture 378–379: 115–130. bergersen, r. & klemetsen, a. 1988. freshwater eel anguilla anguilla (l.) from north norway with emphasis on occurrence, food, age and downstream migration. nordic journal of freshwater research 64: 54–66. beullens, k., eding, e.h., gilson, p., ollevier, f., komen, j. & richter, c.j.j. 1997. gonadal differentiation, intersexuality (anguilla anguilla l.) and sex ratios of european eel maintained in captivity. aquaculture 153: 135–150. bienarz, k., epler, p., malczewski, b. & passakas, t. 1981. development of european eel (anguilla anguilla l.) gonads in artiﬁcial conditions. aquaculture 22: 53–66. carss, d.n., elston, d.a., nelson, k.c. & kruuk, h. 1999. spatial and temporal trends in unexploited yellow eel stocks in two shallow lakes and associated streams. journal of fish biology 55: 636–654. colombo, g., grandi, g. & rossi, r. 1984. gonad differentia- tion and body growth in anguilla anguilla, l. journal of fish biology 24: 215–228. dekker, w. 2003. did lack of spawners cause the collapse of the european eel, anguilla anguilla?
