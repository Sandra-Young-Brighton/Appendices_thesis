reznick & braun 1987; hutchings et al. 1999; jobling & bendiksen 2003). in ﬁshes, the major lipid classes are polar lipids and the nonpolar lipids – cholesterols, fatty acids and triacyl- glycerols (jobling 1994). polar lipids and cholesterols are important parts of structural tissue such as cellular membranes (e.g. henderson & tocher 1987). only small amounts of free fatty acids exist in animal tissues, and fatty acids are normally stored as nonpolar triacylglycerols, which is regarded the principal energy source during starvation, sexual maturation and spawning (e.g. sheridan 1988). in freshwater ﬁshes, the energy intake is low during winter, and depletion of energy is regarded a major cause of mortality (gardiner and geddes 1980; post & evans 1989; miranda & hubbard 1994; finstad et al. 2004b). total lipid content is a common measure of storage energy in ﬁshes (schultz & conover 1997; berg & bremset 1998; berg et al. 2000; finstad et al. 2003). however, survival may not only be dependent on the total lipid content, but also on the lipid class 572 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00173.x composition. a recent study (finstad et al. 2004b) indicated that depleted triacylglycerol stores might imply high risk of energy-related mortality in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). there is a general lack of knowledge on the seasonal dynamics of lipid class composition in natural ﬁsh populations (but refer jobling 1998), particularly with regard to triacylglycerols during the critical winter period. lipid class composition may vary among individuals at similar levels of total lipids (aursand et al. 1994), rendering the use of total lipid content to quantify storage energy questionable. here, we describe the seasonal variation in lipid classes in a northern (70°n) population of juvenile atlantic sal- mon, and test the assumption that total lipid content can be used to identify critical levels of stored energy, and thereby critical periods for survival. materials and methods the river alta (mean annual water discharge )1, fig. 1) in northern norway (70°n 23°e) 75 m3 s is usually ice covered from november to may. for atlantic salmon, the mean smolt age (1991–1998) is 4.0 years and mean total smolt length is 136 mm. atlantic salmon parr (cohort: 1994, n ¼ 175; 1995, n ¼ 177; 1996, n ¼ 361) were collected by electro- ﬁshing in the same area of the river from november 1996 to may 1998. the ﬁsh were weighed (± 0.01 g) and length was measured (total length ± 0.5 mm) immediately after sampling. stomach content and otoliths were removed before lipid analyses, and the otoliths were used for age determination. the carcass, including intestines with fat deposits, was homogenised before lipid analyses. before april 1997, each cohort was pooled before analysed for lipid composition (methods are described in aursand et al. 1994). after april 1997, the ﬁsh within each cohort were sorted in up to four groups according to their condition factor k (weatherley & gill 1987) before lipid class content as an indicator of critical periods lipid describing population analysed. the ﬁsh pooled in the analyses were representative samples from the population. the procedure did therefore not induce any bias in the results dynamics. although the pooling of samples reduced the degrees of freedom, and the different number of ﬁsh in the groups led to variable accuracy of the data points, the resulting test power was large enough to signiﬁcantly show the variations in lipid content. the pooling procedure that was used made it logistically feasible to study variations through the whole year and for all cohorts. we also analysed lipid composition for individual ﬁsh (n ¼ 39) sampled in may 1998, in order to test for individual variation in lipid class composition. lipids were extracted with chloroform (chcl3)/methanol (ch3oh)/distilled water (h2o) as described by blight & dyer (1959). lipid class composition was determined by iatroscan thin-layer chromatographyﬂame system (tlc-fid). all lipid levels are given as per cent of ﬁsh total fresh body mass. ionisation detector results average fresh mass of the ﬁsh in the different cohorts and sampling periods ranged from 0.95 to 25.6 g (fig. 2). growth, in terms of wet mass, was observed for parr in all three cohorts. during the study period, the 1996 year class increased from 1 to 4.5 g, the 1995 year class from 3.5 to 13.5 g, and the 1994 year class from 13.5 to 23.5 g. growth in mass started during late spring (may–july) and ended in late autumn (november) (fig. 2). during late autumn and winter, no positive mass growth was recorded (fig. 2). after there was no correction for differences in mass, signiﬁcant between-cohort variation in total lipid content or any of the lipid classes (ancova; all f2,32 < 2.35, all p > 0.266). there was no consistent pattern of increase in lipid levels among groups of ﬁsh sorted by increasing fig. 1. water temperature (hatched line) and discharge (solid line) in sautso, river alta, during 1 november 1996–31 march 1998. 573 næsje et al. content was also signiﬁcantly related to polar lipid (p ¼ 0.001, r ¼ 0.79) and cholesterol (p ¼ 0.019, r ¼ 0.38) content. free fatty acid content did not signiﬁcantly explain any of the variation in total lipid content (p ¼ 0.66, r ¼ 0.08). the mass-speciﬁc total lipid content of individual ﬁsh collected in may 1999, varied between 1.3% and 6.0% of fresh mass, while the content of triacylglyce- rols varied between 0% and 3.6%, polar lipids between 0.9% and 1.8%, cholesterols between 0.2% and 0.3%, and free fatty acids between 0.1% and 0.3%. there were signiﬁcant correlations between total lipid con- tent and content of all individual lipid classes (all p < 0.003). however, variation in triacylglycerol content explained more of the variation in total lipid content (r ¼ 0.98) than polar lipids (r ¼ 0.78), cho- lesterols (r ¼ 0.65) and free fatty acids (r ¼ 0.47). fig. 2.

(2004b) investigated the energy- dependent winter mortality in river alta juvenile salmon by comparing frequency distributions of ﬁsh with different speciﬁc energy contents. on several occasions during late winter, a disappearance of low energy individuals from the population was observed. furthermore, finstad et al. (2004b) indicated that ﬁsh mortality increased when triacylglycerol levels were low or absent. analyses of the energy status of ﬁsh are useful tools in several ﬁelds of ﬁsh research (e.g. jonsson & jonsson 1997; schultz & conover 1997; berg & bremset 1998; finstad et al. 2003; dempson et al. 2004). because of its simplicity, condition factor has been used as an index of energy status of salmonids and other ﬁsh species (weatherley & gill 1987). in accordance with previous studies (weatherley & gill 1983; simpson 1992; kadri et al. 1996), the condi- tion factor was a poor predictor of the variation in total lipid and triacylglycerol content in the present study. the present study demonstrates that measuring total in most cases, give a fair description of the temporal allocation pattern of triacylglycerols, except at very low triacylglycerol levels, where also polar lipids may be utilised as an energy source. methods separating polar and nonpo- lar lipids (dobush et al. 1985) may give some additional information of the energetic status of the ﬁsh. the most detailed information of the energetic status during critical periods, life stages or exposure to severe environmental stress will, however, be obtained by investigations of variations in the lipid class composition. lipid content will, acknowledgements the study was funded by statkraft energy as and the norwegian institute for nature research (nina). trond andreassen, bengt finstad, karstein ha˚rsaker, a˚ se kjellman, svein tore nilsen, ingrid overrein, laila saksga˚rd and marte schei contributed to different parts of the project. odd terje sandlund commented on the earlier version of the manuscript. finnmark college provided access to their laboratories. all contributors are thanked for their assistance and co-operation. references aursand, m., bleivik, b., rainuzzo, j.r., jørgensen, l. & mohr, v. 1994. lipid distribution and composition of commercially farmed atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). journal of the science of food and agriculture 64: 239–248. berg, o.k. & bremset, g. 1998. seasonal changes in the body composition of young riverine atlantic salmon and brown_trout. journal of fish biology 52: 1272–1288. berg, o.k., thronæs, e. & bremset, g. 2000. annual cycle in body composition and energy in brown_trout in a temperate zone lake. ecology of freshwater fish 9: 163–169. 576 blight, e.g. & dyer, w.j. 1959. a rapid method to total lipid extraction and puriﬁcation. canadian journal of biochemistry and physiology 37: 911–917. cunjak, r.a. 1988. physiological consequences of overwinter- ing in streams: the cost of acclimatization?
