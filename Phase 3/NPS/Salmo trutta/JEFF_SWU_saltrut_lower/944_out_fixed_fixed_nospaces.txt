predation; competition; ecosystem; prioritisation; cross-taxa comparison; carassius auratus/c. gibelio complex introduction through human activities, especially increased global trade, the number of alien (i.e. non-native) species worldwide is constantly increasing (vitousek et al. 1997; daisie 2009; hulme 2009; hulme et al. 2009). after being introduced from its native range into a new area, an alien species may establish self- sustaining populations, increase in number and spread (pysek & richardson 2010). the more individuals introduced and the more introduction events that occur, the higher the propagule pressure and the probability of successful establishment and rapid growth (colautti et al. 2006). with increasing spread, alien species affect native species and ecosystems (which can be analysed as environmental impact) and the human economy (which can be analysed as eco- nomic impact) but only negative impacts are consid- ered (nentwig 2007; vila et al. 2010; jeschke et al. 2014). at this point, the alien species is considered to be an invasive species (pysek et al. 2009), thus tak- ing impact into account as an important criterion of the last stage in modern frameworks of biological invasions (blackburn et al. 2011). invasive fish species can cause great harm to native biodiversity through herbivory (mcknight & hepp 1995), predation (almeida et al. 2012), competition (caiola & de sostoa 2005), hybridisation (h€anfling correspondence: w. nentwig, institute of ecology and evolution, university of bern, baltzerstrasse 6, ch 3012 bern, switzerland. e-mail: wolfgang.nentwig@iee.unibe.ch 646 doi: 10.1111/eff.12181 et al. 2005), disease transmission (gozlan et al. 2005) and ecosystem alteration (britton et al. 2010). more- over, they may alter ecosystem functioning (richard- son et al. 1995), ecosystem services (vila et al. 2010), community structure (alcaraz et al. 2008), habitats (crooks 1998), and food webs and/or nutrient fluxes (caraco et al. 1997; simon et al. 2004). the economic costs caused by alien invasive fish species in the usa adds up to an annual loss of $5.4 billion (pimentel et al. 2005). although invasive fish cause huge global economic costs, they are still being intro- duced for aquaculture, as ornamental fish, or for sport fishing and fisheries (gozlan 2008). alien and invasive species require different activi- ties to manage existing populations and to prevent further introductions. these actions include, among others, risk assessments and prioritisation of high impact species, early detection and warning systems (ricciardi et al. 2000), eradication and restoration programmes (wittenberg & cock 2001; genovesi 2005, 2007) and various prevention measures (hulme et al. 2008, 2009). risk assessments for fish have been developed by copp et al. (2005a, 2009), and there are a variety of different approaches and further development of such assessments; for recent over- views see essl et al. (2011) and kumschick & rich- ardson (2013). prioritisation of invasive species relies on ranking them according to their impact. in public opinion and management approaches to alien and invasive species, there is an increasing demand for such ranking because the best manner to respond to limited resources for management and eradication of alien invasive species is by cross-taxa species prioritisation. well-known approaches are the ‘100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species’ (lowe et al. 2000) and the european equivalent (daisie 2009), even if these lists are not further ranked within these 100 positions. for educational purposes, formation of opinion and general argumentation, such lists are extremely valu- able. copp et al. (2009) and savini et al. (2010) pres- ent ranked lists for fish for the united kingdom and for alien freshwater species in european aquaculture, using different assessment approaches. prioritisation of alien and invasive species is valuable for managers and decision-makers, for example related to aquacul- ture. however, in a broader context, such as the development of regulations against alien and invasive species or in the field of conservation ecology, an even wider taxonomic range and a cross-higher taxa comparison is highly desirable. here, we adapt the generic impact scoring system, so far used for mammals (nentwig et al. 2010), birds (kumschick & nentwig terrestrial arthropods (vaes-petignat & nentwig 2014), to fish species alien to europe. with this approach, we 2010) and alien and invasive fish species extend the generic impact scoring system from pri- marily terrestrial to aquatic species, and we include another common higher vertebrate taxon. we do not intend assessment approaches, but rather provide a framework for developing recommendations for control strategies against alien and invasive species. compare different risk to material and methods species list a preliminary list of 195 fish species alien to europe was compiled, based on the daisie (2013) and no- banis (2013) databases. we excluded species intro- duced to europe before the year 1492, because this is usually considered to be the beginning of globalisa- tion, human-assisted worldwide dispersal of species and biological invasions (daisie 2009). we also excluded fish species without self-sustaining popula- tions. the siberian sturgeon acipenser baerii has been introduced to nine european countries in the last decades; however, reproduction has not been con- firmed (fishbase 2013). if this status changes in the near future, this species has to be included and would probably be of concern as it is already mentioned on the black list for germany and austria (nehring et al. 2010). further, we excluded species that are native to some parts of europe, but alien in other european areas (e.g. neogobius species native to the black sea area or the pike-perch sander lucioperca, native to eastern but alien in western europe). such species may cause considerable damage, however, were not included in this study because (1) the inva- sion history of these groups is different from species originating from outside europe, and (2) conclusions cannot be drawn on a european level, thus requiring regionalisation. the information on successful estab- lishment was taken from kottelat & freyhof (2007), daisie (2013), fishbase (2013) and nobanis (2013). the native distribution of the species was taken from fishbase (2013), but see below for car- assius gibelio. according to these criteria, the initial list was reduced to 40 fish species. we defined eur- ope as the european continent including ukraine, belarus and the european part of russia, while excluding the asian part of turkey, the azores, the canary islands, madeira and cyprus. the taxonomic position and origin of two high impact species, the goldfish c. auratus and the gibel c. gibelio, is still controversial. while fishbase (2013) regards them as two species and the gibel potentially as of eurasian origin, modern molecular investigations show them as two closely related taxa, and they are often considered as subspecies. both taxa originate from north-eastern asia (china), where 647 van der veer et al. wild lines occur, which are basal to all domestic forms of c. auratus. around 1500, the goldfish was first imported to japan and then also to several euro- pean countries; with frequent releases into the wild. c. gibelio lines are also found from china, west to kazakhstan, and they have also been frequently intro- duced to europe, where they hybridise with c. aura- tus. in europe, complex modes of reproduction can be found, including polyploidy, gynogenetic popula- tions and frequent interbreeding (also with the native c. carassius), which often makes identification of wild populations very difficult. because of their high similarity, also in an ecological context, we consider this as the ‘c. auratus/c. gibelio’ complex. both taxa are of asian origin and alien to europe (vete- maa et al. 2005; komiyama et al. 2009; rylkova et al. 2010; takada et al. 2010). generic impact scoring system the generic impact scoring system, as developed by nentwig et al. (2010) for mammals and modified by kumschick & nentwig (2010) for birds, has also been applied to terrestrial arthropods (vaes-petignat & nentwig 2014). in principle, the generic impact scoring system comprises two main impact groups (environmental and economic impact), each with six categories (table 1). for each of these twelve catego- ries, there are five levels of intensity plus a zero impact level for cases where no impact is known or detectable. the scoring points represent different intensity levels and range from one (minor impact) to five (major impact), resulting in a maximum of sixty impact points for species with the highest impact (= two main impact groups 9 six categories 9 five impact points). all impact categories and levels are described in the generic impact scoring system handbook (data s2). the first published versions were devoted only to alien mammals and birds (kumschick & nentwig 2010; nentwig et al. 2010); however, the version provided here also includes impact from alien arthro- pods and fish. to achieve this, the descriptions of impact categories and impact levels had to be rephrased in a more comprehensive manner. it is now possible to assign all impact reports published for these invasive species to an appropriate impact cate- gory and impact level, which allows for the compari- son of all mentioned taxa with the same assessment procedure. the generic impact scoring system is scale-independent, is assumed that a given species occurs all-over europe in all suitable habitats. this assessment of ‘potential impact’ (nentwig et al. 2010) allows the comparison of different species independent of their individual introduction and dis- persal history. in a further step, not performed here, a thus it 648 subsequent adaptation or reduction to single countries is possible. a literature search was performed on the environ- mental and economic impact of the selected 40 alien fish species. if available, we preferentially used data from europe, otherwise data from other invaded areas or from the native area were used, assuming that a species shows in principle a similar behaviour in native and invaded areas. the scientific names were used as search terms in the isi web of knowledge. if the search result was higher than 50 hits (e.g. chum salmon oncorhynchus_keta >1400 hits), a second set of search criterion was added (herbivory, competi- tion, predation, disease transmission, parasitism, hy- bridisation, aquaculture, forestry, infrastructure, human health or human social life). this extensive literature search resulted in 185 scientific papers from various journals and books (data s1). the relevant information from these publi- cations was used to create species fact sheets, which were later used for scoring. agriculture, ecosystem, after the collection of all fish data, all species were scored by the first author. results were cross-checked by the second author. scoring was then repeated independently by four assessors which were msc and phd students in our institute. to enable them to do so, they received an oral introduction into the subject, a demonstration of the scoring assessment, and the 40 fact sheets of all species. each fact sheet listed rel- evant references per species (in total 185 articles), and the core information needed to score the species. the five sets of results from first author and four assessors were used to calculate mean values and standard deviations. this can also be seen as a mean of uncertainty between different assessors. results the 40 established alien fish species belong to 15 families (table 2). goldfish c. auratus/c. gibelio (25.4 impact points) had the highest impact score of all alien fish species, followed by topmouth gudgeon pseudorasbora parva (15.4 impact points), grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella (14.5 impact points), brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis (13.6 impact points) and the guppy poecilia reticulata (10.2 impact points). on the other hand, four species (jewel fish hemichr- omis letourneauxi, chinese rice fish oryzias sinensis, black buffalo ictiobus niger and micropercops cinc- tus) scored zero points because there was no useful data available. thus, the remaining 31 species yielded medium to low impact scores, ranging from 1 to 9.9 points. independent scoring by five assessors with the same species fact sheets resulted in a standard deviation ranging from 0 to 2.7 points per species (table 2). table 1. impact categories with respect to environmental and economic impacts. each impact category contains five intensity levels which are described in the ‘handbook of the impact scoring system for the impacts of alien species’ (supporting information). alien and invasive fish species environmental impacts impacts on plants or vegetation impacts concerns single or a few plant species (e.g. by changes in reproduction, survival, growth, abundance). in case of plants, impact may consist of allelopathy or the release of plant exudates such as oxygen or salt. in case of animals impact include herbivory, grazing, bark stripping, antler rubbing, feeding on algae, or uprooting of aquatic macrophytes. it includes restrictions in establishment, pollination, or seed dispersal of native species. impacts range from population decline to population loss and it includes also minor changes in the food web. impacts on animals through predation or parasitism impacts may concern single animal species or a guild, e.g. through predation, parasitism, or intoxication of eggs, juveniles or adults, measurable for example as changes in reproduction, survival, growth, or abundance. when the alien species is a plant, the impact can be due to a change in food availability or palatability (e.g. fruits, forage or flowers affecting pollinators), and the uptake of secondary plant compounds or toxic compounds by animals. this impact may act on different levels, ranging from population decline to population loss and it includes also minor changes in the food web impacts on plants and animals through competition impacts may concern single species, a group or a community, e.g. by competition for nutrients, food, water, space or other resources, including competition for pollinators which might affect plant fecundity (i.e. fruit or set set). often, the alien species outcompetes native species due to higher reproduction, resistance or longevity. in the beginning, this impact may be inconspicuous and only recognizable as slow change in species abundance which finally may lead to the disappearance of a native species. it includes behavioural changes in outcompeted species and ranges from population decline to population loss. impacts through transmission of diseases or parasites to native species host or alternate host for diseases (viruses, fungi, protozoans or other pathogens) or parasites, impact on native species by transmission of diseases or parasites impacts through hybridization impacts through hybridization with native species, usually closely related, leading to a loss of reproduction possibility, sterile or fertile hybrid offspring, gradual loss of the genetic identity of a species, and/or disappearance of a native species, i.e. local extinction. impacts on ecosystems impacts on characteristic properties of an ecosystem, its nutritional status (e.g. changes in nutrient pools and fluxes, which may be caused by nitrogen- fixating symbionts, increased turbidity or pollution), modification of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture, ph, c/n ratio, salinity, eutrophication), and disturbance regimes (vegetation flammability, changes in erosion or soil compacting), changes in ecosystem services (e.g. pollination or decomposition). impact on ecosystems includes modification of successional processes. such habitat modifications may lead to reduced suitability (e.g. shelter) for other species, thus causing their disappearance. impacts also include the need for applying pesticides which due to their low selectivity have side-effects on non-target organisms. economic impacts impacts on agricultural production impacts through damage to crops or plantations, but also to horticultural and stored products. impacts include competition with weeds, direct feeding damage (from feeding traces which reduce marketability to complete production loss) but also reduced accessibility, usability or marketability through contamination. impacts include the need for applying pesticides which involve additional costs, also by reducing market quality. impacts usually lead to an economic loss. impacts on animal production impacts through competition with livestock, transmission of diseases or parasites to livestock and predation of livestock. intoxication of livestock through changes in food palatability, secondary plant compounds or toxins, weakening or injuring livestock, e.g. by stinging or biting. also impacts on livestock environment such as pollution by droppings on farmland which domestic stock are then reluctant to graze. hybridization with livestock. impacts include the need for applying pesticides which involve additional costs, also by reducing market quality. impacts usually lead to an economic loss. impacts on forestry production impacts on forests or forest products through plant competition, parasitism, diseases, herbivory, effects on tree or forest growth and on seed dispersal. impacts may affect forest regeneration through browsing on young trees, bark gnawing or stripping and antler rubbing. damage includes felling trees, defoliating them for nesting material or causing floods. impacts include the need for applying pesticides which involve additional costs, also by reducing market quality. impacts usually lead to an economic loss. impacts on human infrastructure and administration impacts include damage to human infrastructure, such as roads and other traffic infrastructure, buildings, damps, docks, fences, electricity cables (e.g. by gnawing or nesting on them) or through pollution (e.g. by droppings). impacts through root growth, plant cover in open water bodies or digging activities on watersides, roadside embankments and buildings may affect flood defense systems, traffic infrastructure or stability of buildings. impacts may affect human safety and cause traffic accidents. impacts include the need for applying pesticides, their development costs and further registration or administration costs, as well as costs for research and control. impacts usually lead to an economic loss. impacts on human health injuries (e.g. bites, stings, scratches, rashes), transmission of diseases and parasites to humans, bioaccumulation of noxious substances, health hazard due to contamination with pathogens or parasites (e.g. of water, soil, food, or by feces or droppings), as well as secondary plant compounds, toxins or allergen substances such as pollen. impacts include the need for applying pesticides which due to their low selectivity and/or residues may have side- effects on humans. via health costs, impacts usually lead to economic costs. impacts on human social life noise disturbance, pollution of recreational areas (water bodies, rural parks, golf courses or city parks), including fouling, eutrophication, damage by trampling and overgrazing, restrictions in accessibility (e.g. by thorns, other injuring structures, successional processes, or recent pesticide application) to habitats or a landscapes of recreational value. restrictions or loss of recreational activities. the most substantial impact of alien fish was in the environmental categories. the greatest negative effects were associated with predation, competition, alteration of ecosystems and transmission of diseases. less pronounced are the negative effects associated with species hybridisation. no herbivory and 649 van der veer et al. table 2.

(fig. 1). carassius auratus/c. gibelio also had the highest impact (3.6 impact points) on animal produc- tion due to its transmission of the cyprinid herpesvi- rus-3 to farmed carp (el-matbouli & soliman 2011). pseudorasbora parva is the biggest direct threat to humans because it is able to transmit clonorchiasis (fan 1998). we detected only limited phylogenetic patterns in our results. seven cyprinid species had the highest impact scores (10.5 points per species), whereas three catastomid species had the lowest impact scores (1.2 points per species). most families, however, had intermediate scores (centrarchids and salmonids with 6 and 5.7 points respectively, and the remaining 11 families with an average impact of 4.3 points per spe- cies). however, there were often substantial differ- ences between species within a family; therefore, we caution against predicting impact based purely on phylogenetic relationships. discussion impact categories the greatest negative environmental effects of alien fish species were associated with predation on other animals. one explanation is that alien predators have the initial advantage that they are unknown to prey species and can cause severe decreases in local prey populations (cox & lima 2006). average impact of predation was 1.3 points, with no species scoring more than 3.5 impact points. predation relates to com- petition where alien fish also exert a high impact. it has been argued that alien species either have to occupy an empty niche or they have to be dominant (invasive) to establish a fast-growing population (ma- tsuo & ochiai 2009). therefore, we assume that com- petition with native species plays a key role (average of 1.0 impact point per alien fish species in this cate- gory) and may still be underestimated. the most prominent example was gambusia holbrooki (4.2 impact points), which is threatening iucn red listed iberian endemic fish species (caiola & de sostoa 2005; almeida & grossman 2012). alien fish received the third highest impact points for ecosystem alteration. we found that alien fish species can change a whole ecosystem by changes of the primary produc- ers (britton et al. 2010), food webs (jackson 2002), the nutrient status (cardona 2006), water clarity (rowe 2007) and water quality (keller & lake 2007). disease transmission contributed to almost 0.7 impact points per species, making it the fourth most important category. alien fish species can carry a diverse range of viruses (mcloughlin & graham 2007), bacteria (jutfelt et al. 2008) and parasites (grabner & el-matbouli 2009). pseudorasbora parva 652 poses the biggest threat through the transmission of an infectious pathogen that results in increased mor- tality or total inhibition of spawning of the endan- gered sunbleak leucaspius delineatus (gozlan et al. 2005). herbivory is a relatively less important impact cat- egory with rather limited threat to the native aquatic vegetation. nevertheless, there is documentation that c. auratus/c. gibelio and ctenopharyngodon idella, in particular, have a highly negative influence on aquatic plants. both species also alter the ecosystem by changing the abundance of primary producers (richardson et al. 1995; dibble & kovalenko 2009). only four alien fish species are at least partially capable of hybridising with native species, all others seem to be sufficiently genetically isolated from native species. carassius auratus/c. gibelio showed the highest impact points in the hybridisation cate- gory because of their ability to hybridise with c. car- assius and cyprinus carpio, which has resulted in a decline of c. carassius in great britain (hume et al. 1983; h€anfling et al. 2005; sayer et al. 2011). the second highest hybridisation impact points was achieved by s. fontinalis, which is able to hybridise with the native brown_trout salmo_trutta, resulting in so-called tiger trout (cucherousset et al. 2008). the situation is clearly different for economic impact. our data illustrate that alien fish species, in contrast to alien birds and mammals (kumschick & nentwig 2010; nentwig et al. 2010), have little eco- nomic impact. fish have so far no notable impact on agriculture, forestry, human infrastructure or human social life. this may be explained by the european focus of our study because in asian paddy fields or brazilian inundation forests fish could have an influ- ence on agriculture or forestry. only two economic impact categories are affected: animal production and human health. alien fish species can affect ani- mal production (usually aquacultures) through the transmission of pathogens, which may cause rela- tively high expenses (el-matbouli & soliman 2011). human health can be affected because some fish spe- cies transmit pathogens to humans or accumulate pol- lutants. however, with an average of 0.5 impact points per alien fish species, both risks seem to be relatively small as we found only few reports con- cerning pathogens directly affecting humans (fan 1998). we found numerous references for bioaccu- mulation of pollutants in fish as human food, but these values usually did not exceed international thresholds. origin of the alien fish species more than half of the 40 alien fish species investi- gated are native to north america or adjacent parts of the pacific. common biogeographical roots, as well as climatic and ecological similarities between both continents may explain the success of these alien fish species in the effective colonisation and establishment of self-sustaining and growing popula- tions (rago et al. 2012). six of the 11 alien fish spe- cies from the asian continent belong to the cyprinid family and three of them represent the species with the highest impact points. this leads to an overall high impact scoring of asian alien fish species com- pared with the north american species, which have a relatively low mean impact on the environment and economy, despite being well represented on the european continent. the special case of c. auratus/c. gibelio our study illustrates that the impact of alien fish var- ies strongly among species. the most substantial threat of alien fish species to our native fauna and flora was posed by three asian cyprinids, with c. au- ratus/c. gibelio clearly leading the ranking (25.4 impact points). there are different explanations for the invasiveness of this fish. carassius auratus/ c. gibelio was domesticated in china more than 1000 years ago, around 1500 it was introduced to japan, and later to further countries. it is known to have first been introduced to europe in portugal in 1611 (kottelat & freyhof 2007). beside the attractive red colouration of the goldfish, their tolerance against high temperature and low oxygen levels could be advantageous for their survival in small ponds (sollid et al. 2005). in previously fish-free ponds and other water bodies, c. auratus/c. gibelio can cause consid- erable damage through feeding on and uprooting the aquatic plants, thus, changing the conditions of the whole aquatic ecosystem through increased turbidity (richardson et al. 1995), and predation on amphibi- ans, molluscs, annelids, crustaceans and insects (richardson et al. 1995; meyer et al. 1998). caras- sius auratus/c. gibelio is known to compete and hy- bridise with native species (hume et al. 1983; h€anfling et al. 2005; copp et al. 2010) and to trans- mit diseases to indigenous or cultured fish species (el-matbouli & soliman 2011) and humans (pate et al. 2005). the combination of these negative environmental and economic impacts has made c. auratus/c. gibe- lio the worst alien fish species in europe. if we com- pare its 25.4 impact points with mammals of the highest impact group (23–32 impact points), we see that it is in the same range as the raccoon procyon lotor, the coypu myocastor coypus, the american mink neovi- son vison and the muskrat ondathra zibethicus (nentwig et al. 2010). interestingly, in germany and the grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis, alien and invasive fish species austria the goldfish c. auratus is only on the grey list (nehring et al. 2010). hybridisation with the gi- bel c. gibelio is mentioned, but the gibel is regarded as a native species and hybridisation is considered to be ‘nonthreatening’, while confusion of both species in the scientific literature has been confirmed (neh- ring et al. 2010). carassius auratus/c. gibelio is not mentioned as one of the 100 worst alien invasive spe- cies in europe (daisie 2013), and it is not among the 100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species (lowe et al. 2000). copp et al. (2009) list c. gibelio as most invasive species for the uk, but excluded c. auratus from their assessment ‘due to their long history (over three centuries) in the united king- dom’. however, vilizzi & copp (2012) classify the latter as a high-risk species for the uk. it seems that this species was in many studies, strongly underestimated. additionally, the general public should be informed about the environmental impacts of this species, as it is still being traded in high numbers as an ornamental fish, which results in frequent releases by private aquarists even in previ- ously fish-free waters (copp et al. 2005b). the impact of comparing the generic impact scoring system results with fisk and black lists in this study, we investigated the potential impact of 40 alien fish species. nineteen of these are also ranked by copp et al. (2009) for the united kingdom with their fish invasiveness scoring kit, fisk, another quantitative impact assessment tool. black, grey and white lists can be seen as another approach to score impact, but they are usually only qualitative. twenty species are common to these lists for germany and austria (nehring et al. 2010); however, they are not identical with those in the analysis of copp et al. (2009). the differences can be explained by the geo- graphical scope of the analyses, as the latter is limited to the united kingdom, and the black, grey and white lists are limited to germany and austria, while our generic impact scoring system has a european focus. both studies, just to give two examples, included the bighead goby neogobius kessleri and sander luciop- erca, both with considerable impact (copp et al. 2009; savini et al. 2010; essl et al. 2011). they had not been included in our analysis because of their east european origin. we do not intend to compare the methodological approaches of fisk or the black list approach with the generic impact scoring system applied here, because we would then also have to include other assessment methods, most of which are restricted to higher taxa or geographical areas. this is far beyond the scope of the study. for recent reviews of relevant risk assessments see essl et al. (2011) and kumschick & richardson (2013). 653 van der veer et al. conclusion in conclusion, the modified generic impact scoring system of nentwig et al. (2010) presented here can be used to assess the impact of invasive fish. following previous studies on invasive birds (kumschick & nen- twig 2010) and terrestrial arthropods (vaes-petignat & nentwig 2014), we adapted and applied the original system to another taxonomic group, in this case, fish. this allows comparisons to be drawn between major taxonomic groups and enables decision-makers to pri- oritise among these species. in contrast to the studies of copp et al. (2009) and nehring et al. (2010), focus- sing on one or two countries, we followed a european approach. one could argue that, given the restricted dispersal abilities of fish, an even better approach could be obtained by basing the analysis on major drainage systems. the advantage of our generic impact scoring system is that it can easily be broken down into smaller geographical units, such as drainage systems or countries, simply by reducing the species list to those which occur or could occur in a given regional subset. however, it is advisable not to reduce the geo- graphical scope too much, as alien fish species intro- ductions are anthropogenic and traverse political and biogeographical borders (gozlan et al. 2010). acknowledgements our special thanks go to antonio diblasi, kay lucek, esther vogel and marcel haesler who helped to assess the species impact and to tamara blattmann, myles menz and christof sch€uepp for comments on an earlier version of the manuscript. we also thank the editor bernard hugueny and two reviewers for their comments. references alcaraz, c., bisazza, a. & garcıa-berthou, e. 2008. salinity mediates the competitive interactions between invasive mos- quitofish and an endangered fish. oecologia 155: 205–213. almeida, d. & grossman, g.d. 2012. utility of direct obser- vational methods for assessing competitive interactions between non-native and native freshwater fishes. fisheries management and ecology 19: 157–166. almeida, d., almodovar, a., nicola, g.g., elvira, b. & grossman, g.d. 2012. trophic plasticity of invasive juve- nile largemouth bass micropterus salmoides in iberian streams. fisheries research 113: 153–158. blackburn, t.m., pysek, p., bacher, s., carlton, j.t., duncan, r.p., jarosik, v., wilson, j.r.u. & richardson, d.m. 2011. a proposed unified framework for biological invasions. trends in ecology and evolution 26: 333–339. bosch, j., rincon, p.o. & martınez-solano, i. 2006. effects of introduced salmonids on a montane population of iberian frogs. conservation biology 20: 180–189. bravo, r., soriguer, m.c., villar, n. & hernando, j.a. 2001. the dynamics of fish populations in the palancar stream, a 654 small tributary of the river guadalquivir, spain. acta oeco- logica 22: 9–20. britton, j.r., davies, g.d. & harrod, c. 2010. trophic interac- tions and consequent impacts of the invasive fish pseudo- rasbora parva in a native aquatic foodweb: a field investigation in the uk. biological invasions 12: 1533–1542. caiola, n. & de sostoa, a. 2005. possible reasons for the decline of two native toothcarps in the iberian peninsula: evidence of competition with the introduced eastern mosqui- tofish. journal of applied ichthyology 21: 358–363. caraco, n.f., cole, j.j., raymond, p.a., strayer, d.l., pace, m.l., findlay, s.e.g. & fischer, d.t. 1997. zebra mussel invasion in a large, turbid river: phytoplankton response to increased grazing. ecology 78: 588–602. cardona, l. 2006. trophic cascades uncoupled in a coastal marsh ecosystem. biological invasions 8: 835–842. colautti, r.i., grigorovich, i.a. & macisaac, h.j. 2006. prop- invasions. for biological agule pressure: a null model biological invasions 8: 1023–1037. copp, g.h., garthwaite, r. & gozlan, r.e. 2005a. risk iden- tification and assessment of non-native freshwater fishes: concepts and perspectives on protocols for the uk. cefas sience technical report. lowestoft, uk. copp, g.h., wesley, k.j. & vilizzi, l. 2005b. pathways of ornamental and aquarium fish introductions into urban ponds of epping forest (london, england): the human vec- tor. journal of applied ichthyology 21: 263–274. copp, g.h., vilizzi, l., mumford, j., fenwick, g.v., godard, m.j. & gozlan, r.e. 2009. calibration of fisk, an invasive- ness screening tool for nonnative freshwater fishes. risk analysis 29: 457–467. copp, g.h., vilizzi, l. & gozlan, r.e. 2010. the demography of introduction pathways, propagule pressure and occurrences of non-native freshwater fish in england. aquatic conserva- tion: marine and freshwater ecosystems 20: 595–601. cox, j.g. & lima, s.l. 2006. naivete and an aquatic-terres- trial dichotomy in the effects of introduced predators. trends in ecology & evolution 21: 674–680. crooks, j. 1998. habitat alteration and community-level effects of an exotic mussel, musculista senhousia. marine ecology progress series 162: 137–152. cucherousset, j., aymes, j.c., poulet, n., santoul, f. & cereghino, r. 2008. do native brown_trout and non-native brook_trout interact reproductively?
