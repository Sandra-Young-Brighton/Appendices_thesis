ogutu-ohwayo 1990a,b, 1993, 1994; jackson 2000; pringle 2005). although many ﬁsh stocks in lake victoria had declined prior to expansion of the nile perch population, a dramatic increase in the stock size of nile perch in the 1980s coincided with a drastic decline in populations of many indigenous species, most notably the disappear- ance of an estimated 40% of the endemic haplochro- mine cichlids (kaufman 1992; witte et al. 1992a,b; seehausen et al. 1997a,b; balirwa et al. 2003). in lake nabugabo, a satellite lake of the larger victoria, nile perch were introduced in 1960 and 1963, and the pattern of change in ﬁsh faunal structure and diversity followed that observed in lake victoria (ogutu- ohwayo 1993; chapman et al. 1996a,b). four non- indigenous tilapiines (tilapia zillii gervais, oreochr- omis niloticus, oreochromis leucostictus trewavas and tilapia rendalli boulenger) were also introduced at various points around lake victoria from 1953 onwards in response to reduced catch per unit effort (cpue) of two native tilapiines (oreochromis escu- lentus graham and oreochromis variabilis boulenger) that were the main target of the local ﬁshermen since the beginning of the lake victoria ﬁsheries. by 1960, 470 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00185.x they had also been introduced in lakes kyoga, nabugabo, and later into other lakes within the region (beauchamp 1958; welcomme 1967, 1988). of all the native and introduced tilapiines in the lake victoria region, it is only o. niloticus, the nile tilapia, that has become very abundant and commercially important in the presence of the introduced nile perch. this species now forms a critical component of the ﬁsheries of lakes victoria, kyoga and nabugabo, and is of great commercial value in many other small lakes and dams where it has been introduced. the ﬁsheries of lakes victoria and other lakes into which both o. niloticus and nile perch have been introduced (e.g., nabugabo, kyoga) now depends primarily on three species (nile perch, rastrineobola argentea pellegrin, o. niloticus). the successful establishment of non-indigenous ﬁshes, in particular the o. niloticus and nile perch in the lake victoria basin, has been attributed to several factors including their ability to respond effectively to a different and dynamic prey base. the feeding habits of nile perch are ﬂexible, such that when preferred items are depleted, the ﬁsh shifts to other available prey (hughes 1986; ogari & dadzie 1988; ogutu-ohwayo 1990b; chapman et al. 2003). likewise, the success of some tilapias in colonising a wide range of novel habitats has been attributed, in general, to opportunistic food habits, such that food is rarely a limiting factor, and their ﬂexibility in growth rate and maturation size according to prevailing environmental conditions (lowe-mcconnell 1958; balirwa 1998; le´veˆque 2002). studies on the diet of o. niloticus in both its indigenous and new habitats in east africa date back to the early 1950s. earlier studies described the diet of o. niloticus as predominantly herbivorous, comprised mainly of algae, epiphytic diatoms and bottom debris (fish 1955; lowe-mcconnell 1958; moriarity & moriarity 1973). studies undertaken shortly after the establishment of o. niloticus in the victoria region still recorded a predominantly herbivorous diet (welcomme 1967). recent studies, however, indicate a shift in the dietary composition of o. niloticus to include a broad spectrum of items (omnivorous) with high proportions of macroinvertebrates and detritus (gophen et al. 1993; balirwa 1998). the haplochro- mines of lake victoria consisted of several trophic groups including detritivores, zooplanktivores and insectivores (goldschmidt et al. 1993); and their disappearance from various waterbodies where nile perch have been introduced may have resulted in vacant leading to an increase of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and phytoplankton (their former main food sources). this would lead to increased access to a wide food base, which could potentially be exploited by o. niloticus. trophic niches, foraging ecology of nile tilapia the overall goal of this study was to explore the hypothesis that o. niloticus exhibits increased omn- ivory in response to a decline in the abundance of haplochromine benthivores. we approached this in two ways. first, we quantiﬁed variation in the habitat use and diet of o. niloticus in lake nabugabo, uganda relative to intralake variation in the abundance of haplochromines. second, we compared the diet of o. niloticus in lakes with introduced nile perch (nabugabo and victoria), and lakes without nile perch (wamala, mburo, nyamusingiri and kyasanduka). materials and methods habitat utilisation and diet of o. niloticus in lake nabugabo lake nabugabo, a satellite of lake victoria (24 km2, approximately 0°45¢s, 31°45¢e, see fig. 1 in randle & chapman 2004), is characterised by an extensive stretch of shoreline macrophytes (mainly miscanthi- dium violaceum and vossia cuspidata), interrupted by stretches of forests (dominated by ficus spp.) and sand beaches. lake nabugabo is believed to have been formed when a sand bar separated a portion of lake victoria about 4000 years ago (worthington 1932; trewavas 1933; greenwood 1965, 1966). this satel- lite lake now drains southeastward via the lwamunda swamp after which the water seeps through the sand bar into lake victoria. to quantify habitat use by different ﬁsh species in lake nabugabo and assess whether food habits of o. niloticus differ among habitat types, 15 transects (each 550 m in length) were selected to include major habitat types within the lake. this included ﬁve forest edge transects, ﬁve wetland ecotone transects and ﬁve open-water transects (350–500 m off the shoreline). two of the wetland ecotone transects encompassed ﬂoating leafed macrophytes (nymphea lotus and nymphea caerullea) extending 10–20 m off the shoreline. fish specimens, macroinvertebrate samples and a suite of physicochemical characters were collected once every 2 months in lake nabugabo over a period of 18 months (february 2000 to august 2001). fish specimens were caught using a 550-m long gillnet ﬂeet of various mesh sizes (1–5 in., in increments of 1/2 in.) set for 24 h in each transect; and captured ﬁsh were collected both in the morning and evening (12-h intervals). gillnets were set as close as possible to the shoreline for the forest edges and wetland habitats. in addition, 10 metal minnow traps were set at 50-m intervals along the shoreline for each transect. spec- imens collected from minnow traps and additional specimens from commercial catch were used to supplement numbers for stomach content analysis. 471 bwanika et al. each captured ﬁsh was identiﬁed, and all o. niloticus specimens were measured for both length (total length and standard length, 0.1 cm) and body mass (0.1 g). the stomachs of o. niloticus were dissected out, and stomach fullness was visually assessed at four levels, slightly modiﬁed from ball (1961), where: level 1, empty stomach (0%); level 2, food occupying 1/4 in. of the total volume of the stomach (25%); level 3, food occupying 3/4 of the stomach volume (75%); and level 4, a full stomach (100%). stomachs containing food were preserved in 10% formalin for subsequent analysis of dietary content. during each sampling period benthic macrofauna were collected at sites using an ekman grab (with an opening of 225 cm2 and depth of 17 cm) with one grab per transect. samples collected were washed several times using a macrofauna sieve (250 lm) and preserved in 5% formalin for subsequent analysis. macroinvertebrate samples were identiﬁed under a binocular microscope and total number of each major taxa quantiﬁed. physicochemical conditions [secchi )1) and water depth (m), dissolved oxygen (mgæl temperature (°c)] were taken at sites of ﬁsh sampling. dissolved oxygen and water temperature were meas- ured in triplicate just below surface water using a ysi oxygen meter (model 51 b; ysi environmental incorporated, yellow springs, oh, usa). secchi depth was measured using a secchi disc (20 cm in diameter) following standard procedures. in the laboratory, the mass of stomach contents was determined, and stomach contents were then diluted with water for easy visibility under a binocu- lar and compound microscope. two approaches were taken during stomach content analyses. first, the contents were viewed under a binocular microscope, identiﬁed and grouped into major dietary items and percentage contribution of each category established by eye using the subjective percentage volume assessment method outlined by hyslop (1980). second, a ﬁner categorisation of the broad categories was carried out on three subsamples viewed under a compound microscope (·400). at this stage, a major food category was further split into two or three categories depending on their relative abundances. to take into account the differences in stomach fullness, the percentage contribution of a food category was multiplied by an equivalent percentage of the stom- ach fullness score. interlake variation in the diet of o. niloticus the diet of o. niloticus was compared between lakes with nile perch (lake nabugabo and napoleon gulf of lake victoria) and lakes without nile perch (lakes wamala, mburo, nyamusingiri and kyasanduka). point-in-time ﬁsh sampling was carried out in lakes 472 wamala and mburo as part of this study. available data on food habits of o. niloticus in lakes victoria (balirwa 1998), nyamusingiri and kyasanduka (bwanika et al. 2004) were adapted from the literature for comparison. is napoleon gulf (approximately 133 km2, 0°22¢– 0°30¢n, 33°10¢–33°26¢e) lies to the northern part of lake victoria comprising several bays and islands. most of the historical data that exists on the shallow waters of lake victoria in uganda has been recorded in the napoleon gulf. lake mburo (13 km2, 0°38¢– 0°41¢s, 30°55¢–31°57¢e) is situated in lake mburo national park, western uganda. three species of tilapia (o. niloticus, o. leucostictus and t. zillii) were intro- duced into this lake, but, unlike lakes victoria and nabugabo, nile perch has not been transferred to lake mburo. other indigenous ﬁsh species including o. es- culentus, o. variabilis and haplochromine cichlids are found in the lake. lake wamala (118 km2, 0°15¢– 0°25¢n, 31°45¢–32°0¢e) located approximately 75 km north of lake nabugabo and 70 km west of kampala, uganda. the lake was stocked in 1956 with o. niloticus, o. leucostictus and t. zillii but not nile perch; and the lake was opened to commercial ﬁshing in 1960. several other indigenous ﬁsh species, inclu- ding haplochromine cichlids are found in this lake. lakes nyamusingiri and kyasanduka (approximately 0°16¢s and 0°18¢s – 30°00¢e and 30°04¢e) are shallow crater lakes (440 and 150 ha, respectively) located in the bunyaruguru cluster of crater lakes in western uganda. part of this cluster lies within maramagambo forest that acts as a catchment of the eastern escarp- ment of the rift valley (melack 1978; kizito et al. 1993). lakes nyamusingiri and kyasanduka lie at the border of this forest and grass savanna covered the hills. it is reported that tilapiines, including o. niloti- cus, were introduced to increase ﬁsheries production of these lakes (welcomme 1988; ogutu-ohwayo 1990b; kizito et al. 1993). bwanika et al. (2004) described o. niloticus as comprising 8% of experimental catch in lake nyamusinigiri and 55% of the catch in lake kyasanduka. small haplochromine cichlids dominated the remainder of the assemblage in both lakes. data analysis average monthly rainfall data for the period 1985– 1998 (meteorological department, kampala 1999) were used to divide the sampling period into two main seasons: wet and dry season using the annual rainfall mean as the dividing point. cpue was taken to represent total number of ﬁsh of a given taxa (experimental gill nets only) captured per transect, since effort was approximately 12 h in all sampling transects. a wet and dry season cpue value for each transect was derived as the average cpue of all the dry season months and all the wet season months. to assess temporal and spatial variation in cpue of o. niloticus, haplochromine cichlids and nile perch, macroinvertebrate abundance and physicochemical conditions, a repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for the effect of habitat, season (dry vs. wet) and the interaction of the two on log10-transformed mean cpue, and physicochemical conditions (dissolved oxygen concentration, water temperature and secchi depth). least-squares means were used to test for differences in mean values among habitats. to explore in more detail the potential relationships between the abundance of o. niloticus and both the abundance of haplochromines and other environmen- tal variables, we exploited variation among transects within lake nabugabo. pearson correlation was used to test for a relationship between the cpue of o. niloticus and the cpue of haplochromines among transects. both variables were log10 transformed. stepwise linear regression was then used to detect signiﬁcant environmental predictors of o. niloticus abundance among transects with log-transformed cpue of o. niloticus as the dependent variable and the following suite of independent variables: log- transformed macroinvertebrate abundance, dissolved oxygen concentration, water temperature and water transparency. mean dry and wet season values for individual transects were used in the analyses. results habitat utilisation and environmental conditions season (dry and wet) and the interaction between season and habitat type did not have a signiﬁcant effect on cpue of o. niloticus, haplochromine cich- lids and nile perch. however, for all the taxa, cpue foraging ecology of nile tilapia (table 1). oreochromis differed among habitats niloticus were more abundant in the forest and wetland ecotone habitat than in the open-water habitat (p < 0.001, fig. 1). however, no difference was detected in the cpue of o. niloticus between forest and wetland habitat (p ¼ 0.739, table 1). average size of o. niloticus differed among habitats types of lake nabugabo (anova: f ¼ 11.31, p < 0.001). oreochromis niloticus were smallest in the wetland ecotones (mean total length ¼ 17.1 ± 0.5, se, anova: f ¼ 11.30, p < 0.001), larger in the forest edges (mean total length ¼ 19.7 ± 0.5, se) and total largest length ¼ 26.0 ± 5.0, se, scheffe post hoc tests, p < 0.05). haplochromine cichlids were most abun- dant in the wetland ecotone (p < 0.001, fig. 1). there was an overall habitat effect on the abundance of nile perch; nile perch were more abundant in inshore areas (forest and wetland ecotone) than in the open water (p ¼ 0.017, fig. 1). open waters (mean in the to explore the relationship between the abundance of o. niloticus and the abundance of haplochromines, we looked at the correlation between cpue of the two taxa across transects. the cpue of o. niloticus across transects was positively correlated with the cpue of haplochromine cichlids in both the dry season (r ¼ 0.701, p ¼ 0.004) and wet season (r ¼ 0.794, p < 0.001). we detected no signiﬁcant effects of habitat, season or their interaction on dissolved oxygen concentration (table 2). water transparency was higher in the dry season than in the wet season (p ¼ 0.001), and marginally higher in the open waters (p ¼ 0.051, table 2, fig. 2). water temperature was lower in the wetland habitats than in the forest edge areas and the open water (p ¼ 0.009);

however, in the larger size classes variation in diet composition between the dry and wet periods was very modest. the average per cent difference between dry and wet season values across prey types was only 2.1% with a range of 0–9.7%. dietary composition of o. niloticus among lakes across habitats and size classes, the diet of o. niloti- cus in lake nabugabo included at least ﬁve major food categories: detritus (most dominant), followed by insects, plant material, oligochaetes and phytoplankton (fig. 4). chironomid and ephemeropteran larvae were the major insects consumed. phytoplankton comprised a relatively small component of the diet, and consisted of blue green algae (microcystis and anabaena; most followed by diatoms and green algae dominant), (scenedesmus). a similar trend was recorded by balirwa (1998) for o. niloticus from the inshore areas of napoleon gulf, lake victoria (fig. 4). detritus dominated the composition of the diet in these tilapia (43%) followed by insects (30%, primarily chirono- mids);

haplochromine cichlids were most abundant in wetland ecotone habitats. over the range of transects within the lake, the abundance of o. niloticus was positively correlated with the abundance of haplo- chromines. of the environmental variables considered transparency, (macroinvertebrate abundance, water dissolved oxygen and water temperature), water transparency was the only signiﬁcant predictor of o. niloticus cpue. although the productivity (both primary and sec- ondary) of inshore habitats has been strongly correla- ted to ﬁsh abundance (macdonald 1956; rasmussen 1988; okedi 1990), relative availability of food items does not fully explain the habitat use of o. niloticus observed in this study. the highest density of macro- invertebrates (a major dietary item) was recorded in the forest edge and open-water habitats during the dry season and in the forest edge habitats during the wet season, but there was no seasonal effect on cpue of o. niloticus. in addition, the density of macroinverte- brates was not a signiﬁcant predictor of cpue of o. niloticus among transects. however, preference for habitat conditions less favourable to the hunting efﬁciency of nile perch may, to some extent, explain this pattern of habitat use. the use of highly structured or shallow inshore areas where predation risk is reduced is common among juvenile ﬁshes (mittelbach 1981; werner et al. 1983; he & kitchell 1990; brown & moyle 1991). despite the relatively high cpue of there is good evidence to indicate that nile perch that we observed in inshore areas in this study, the structurally complex wetlands of lake nabugabo provide refuges for several indigenous ﬁsh species, and the introduced o. niloticus, from predatory nile perch (chapman et al. 1996a,b; rosenberger & chapman 1999; schoﬁeld & chapman 1999). the prevalence of o. niloticus in habitats with low water transparency may reﬂect a relationship between tilapia is correlated to water and another variable that transparency. however, it the lower transparency provides some additional protec- tion from nile perch. is also possible that in general, results from the different habitats of lake nabugabo indicate that o. niloticus has a varied diet consisting of ﬁve (offshore habitat) to eight (inshore habitat) major dietary categories. these observations agree with other recent ﬁndings suggest- ing that o. niloticus presently has an omnivorous diet in lakes with introduced nile perch (gophen et al. 1993; balirwa 1998). there were, however, distinct differences in the percentage contribution of different food categories among habitats. the large contribution of detritus and complete lack of plant material in the diet of o. niloticus from open-water habitats suggests food availability as a plausible source of the habitat effect, as plant parts are more rare in these open-water areas than the inshore habitats. similarly, the relatively greater contribution of insect larvae to the diet of o. niloticus from the forest edge habitat may reﬂect the high abundance of insect larvae recorded from this habitat. the highest consumption of phytoplankton occurred in the wetland ecotone habitat, while insect feeding was lower than in the inshore forested areas. as haplochromines were most abundant in the wetland ecotones and as the cpue of o. niloticus was positively correlated with haplochromine abundance, the diet characteristics of o. niloticus may reﬂect increased competition for invertebrates in this area. three of the six haplochromine species whose diet was investigated by greenwood (1965) in lake nabugabo predominantly fed on macroinvertebrates. higher levels of phytoplankton consumption in wetland ecotones also relates to the interaction of size and diet in o. niloticus of lake nabugabo. juvenile o. niloti- cus tend to occupy nearshore sheltered habitats (e.g., wetland ecotones, moriarity et al. 1973; balirwa 1998; gooudswaard et al. 2002; this study), and in lake juvenile o. niloticus exhibited a higher nabugabo, level of phytoplanktivory than the larger size classes. this is a particularly interesting ﬁnding that is not consistent with the study of o. niloticus in lake george, uganda. in lake george, moriarity et al. (1973) found that young o. niloticus below 6 cm in total length engaged in active pursuit and ‘pecking’ to include a variety of animal and plant materials in their foraging ecology of nile tilapia diet (omnivorous), while larger ﬁsh were mainly ﬁlter feeders characterised by a primarily phytoplanktivor- ous diet. it is possible that juvenile o. niloticus select structured inshore areas, and in doing so are using a habitat that exposes them to higher levels of compe- tition, and therefore inﬂuences their diet. cascading effects of the predatory nile perch and probable vacant trophic niches comparisons of the diet of o. niloticus among lakes indicate an omnivorous diet dominated by detritus and invertebrates in lakes nabugabo and victoria and a predominantly herbivorous diet in lakes wamala, mburo, nyamusingiri and kyasanduka. we believe that this may reﬂect the introduction of nile perch into lakes nabugabo and victoria and the cascading effects on the food web. oreochromis niloticus has been described as an herbivore in numerous earlier studies (fish 1955; lowe-mcconnell 1958; moriarity 1973; harbott 1975; getachew 1987). moriarity (1973), using 14c-labelled monospeciﬁc cultures of algae fed to ﬁsh, found that o. niloticus assimilated a maximum of 70–80% of ingested carbon from the blue-green algae microcystis sp. and anabaena sp. and the diatom nitzschia, while a maximum of 50% was assimilated from green algae chlorella sp. consequently, the dominance of tilapiine ﬁshes in tropical lakes has been attributed to their efﬁcient utilisation of blue-green algae or detritus (getachew 1987). following the introduction of o. niloticus to lake victoria their diet consisted of planktonic and bottom materials as the major dietary items (welcomme 1967; harbott 1975). oreochromis niloticus now exhibits a more diverse diet in lake victoria (balirwa 1992, 1998; gophen et al. 1993; getabu 1994) and a similarly omivorous diet in lake nabugabo. the observed omnivorous diet of o. niloticus in lakes where inshore insectivores have been reduced by the predatory nile perch suggests availability of a broader food base than was potentially available when other competitors existed (balirwa 1998). loss of ﬁsh species in lakes of the victoria basin has contributed, at least in part, to a massive change in trophic structure (balirwa et al. 2003). among the haplochromines that either disappeared or were greatly reduced from lake victoria, the detritivore–insecti- vores were the most abundant group constituting 54.5% of the haplochromine biomass followed by zooplanktivores at 27% and insectivores at 9.7% (goldschmidt et al. 1993). in the mwanza gulf of lake victoria, bottom-dwelling detritivores and the pelagic phytoplanktivores declined by a factor of a thousand or more coincident with the nile perch explosion (witte et al. 1992a,b). in the early 1990s, 30 years subsequent to the establishment of the nile 477 bwanika et al. it to small mesh-sized gill nets, perch in lake nabugabo, a drastic loss of ﬁsh species was also recorded (ogutu-ohwayo 1993). of the eight haplochromine cichlids recorded from lake nabugabo before the upsurge of nile perch (cnbs 1962), one had vanished; others were very scarce at this time and were mainly encountered in marginal macrophytes (ogutu-ohwayo 1993). although the ﬁsheries of the lake victoria basin had declined before the nile perch was introduced, mainly a result of overﬁshing and a shift is generally believed that nile perch contributed to the dramatic decline observed following its establishment in lakes victoria, nabugabo and kyoga (ogutu-ohwayo 1990a,b, 1993; witte et al. 1992a,b; chapman et al. 1996a,b; balirwa et al. 2003). the disruption and reduction of the diverse and trophically complex indigenous ﬁsh community, and most especially that of the haplochromine cichlids, seems to have initiated changes in food web structure. in lake victoria, the recent increase in algal production, decrease in water transparency (mugidde 1992, 1993) and apparent increase in the abundance of lake ﬂies (kaufman 1992) are some indicators of an altered lake trophic structure. the disappearance of haplochromines may well have allowed the increase of their former main food sources including macroinvertebrates, zooplank- ton and phytoplankton. oreochromis niloticus, a generalist feeder, seems to have exploited the wider food base and potentially food items that offer a higher caloric content. inter- estingly, blue-green algae (microcystis sp. and anab- aena sp.), the green algae (chlorella sp.) and the diatom nitzschia, well assimilated by o. niloticus (moriarity 1973) commonly occur in the lakes under study (bwanika et al. 2004; mugidde 1993), suggest- ing that o. niloticus has the opportunity to feed on phytoplankton, but selects a broader diet. whether an omnivorous diet promotes better growth characteris- tics compared to a phytoplanktivorous diet requires a better understanding of the bioenergetics of o. niloti- cus and growth/diet studies across a broader range of lakes. however, it should be noted that the growth rate of o. niloticus in lake nabugabo is signiﬁcantly greater than in conspeciﬁcs from lake wamala where they feed primarily on phytoplankton (bwanika 2005) suggesting an energetic advantage to the omnivorous diet. a growth advantage afforded by an omnivorous diet may have contributed to the success of o. niloticus in lake victoria over other tilapiines that do not exhibit such dietary ﬂexibility (e.g., o. leucostictus which is primarily a phytoplanktivore, balirwa 1998). a wider habitat tolerance for spawning and nursery grounds than other tilapiines (twongo 1995) and assumed aggressiveness towards other species on breeding grounds (lowe-mcconnell 2000) may also have 478 facilitated the success of o. niloticus in lakes with introduced nile perch. similar changes in diet as described for o. niloticus have also been observed for the cyprinid rastrineo- bola argentea in lake victoria. in contrast to many haplochromine cichlids in lake victoria, the zoo- planktivorous cyprinid r. argentea strongly increased in numbers, despite serving as prey for nile perch (wanink 1998, 1999; wanink & witte 2000). the increase has been attributed to a relaxation of competitive pressure by haplochromine cichlids sub- sequent to the nile perch upsurge (wanink & witte 2000), during which time r. argentea began to exploit the bottom areas of the lake during the daytime (a habitat previously occupied by haplochromines) and include benthic macroinvertebrates in its diet. recently, an increase in the ﬁshing pressure on the large-sized nile perch has coincided with a resurgence of some haplochromine cichlids in lakes victoria, kyoga and nabugabo (seehausen et al. 1997b; witte et al. 2000; balirwa et al. 2003; chapman et al. 2003). this study in lake nabugabo was conducted at a time when haplochromine cichlids had already begun to resurge (chapman et al. 2003). oreochromis niloticus may have exhibited a higher degree of omnivory in the early 1990s when haplochromine cichlids had been greatly reduced and will most likely shift to a more restricted diet if haplochromine cichlids re-establish at high density. interestingly, the resurgence of the zooplanktivor- ous cichlid haplochromis pyrrhocephalus in lake victoria provides additional evidence for cascading effects of the nile perch introduction. this cichlid had almost completely disappeared from lake victoria after the nile perch upsurge. the species reappeared in the late 1990s (katunzi et al. 2003), but with a diet that included a higher percentage of insects, shrimp, ﬁsh and mollusks. katunzi et al. (2003) argue that an increase in proﬁtable prey and a decline in the abundance of efﬁcient competitors may have contri- buted, at in this species. to the dietary shift least in part, management of the current ﬁsheries of the victoria region, and the aquatic systems that support them will require a greater knowledge of food web ecology. recent changes in the trophic structure of lake victoria relate, in part, to ﬁsh species introductions and cascading effects on the ecosystem. in general, much attention has been paid to nile perch in lake victoria over the past three decades, but relatively less attention on the developments of o. niloticus and in particular the implications of its feeding habits. this is despite the fact that success of this species in lakes where it has been introduced has been attributed to its ﬂexible feeding habits. oreochromis niloticus currently contributes signiﬁcantly to commercial ﬁsheries, only second in importance to nile perch. understanding the recent developments in the feeding habits of o. niloticus is critical to predicting its future success in a seemingly dynamic lake environment. the recently observed resurgence of haplochromine cich- lids and other indigenous ﬁsh species may continue to alter the trophic state of these systems. it is probable that o. niloticus may once again shift to its previously herbivorous diet if the observed resurging ﬁsh species re-establish in their former trophic positions and at high density. such a transition may impact both the growth and condition of nile tilapia in these systems.
