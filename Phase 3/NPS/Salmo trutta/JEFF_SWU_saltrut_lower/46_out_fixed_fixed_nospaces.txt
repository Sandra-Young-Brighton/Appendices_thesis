knapp et al. 2001; gunckel et al. 2002; rahel 2002), though the mech- anisms of impact vary (vander zanden et al. 1999; baxter et al. 2004; strayer et al. 2004; hasegawa & maekawa 2006; parker & schindler 2006). in this study, we focus on the potential effects that non-native brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis have on threatened juvenile chinook salmon oncorhynchus_tshawytscha in a stream in the salmon river basin in idaho, usa. non-native ﬁsh have been introduced widely throughout the paciﬁc northwest of the united states. brook_trout, a charr native to eastern north america, were ﬁrst introduced to western rivers starting in the late 1800s (maccrimmon & campbell 1969; krueger & may 1991; fuller et al. 1999). over several decades, the combination of extensive stocking effort and successful recruitment by introduced brook_trout lead to widespread establishment of many populations throughout the northwest (karas 1997; dunham et al. 2002). a number of studies have subsequently dem- onstrated that the success of non-native brook_trout has come at the cost of the native resident ﬁsh including cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarki (dunham et al. 2002; peterson et al. 2004; shepard 2004) and bull trout salvelinus conﬂuentus (nakano et al. 1998; rieman et al. 2006; rodtka & volpe 2007). however, the mechanisms and extent of displacement appear to vary by system depending on biotic and abiotic habitat characteristics, including species composition (e.g., nakano et al. 1998), water temperature (peterson et al. 2004; shepard 2004; rieman et al. 2006; rodtka & doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00398.x 139 macneale et al. volpe 2007), and elevation and gradient (e.g., rieman et al. 2006). brook_trout may also be negatively affecting populations of river-rearing stages of paciﬁc salmon. for example, in relatively pristine streams in the salmon river basin of idaho, reductions in survival of threatened chinook salmon were attributed to the presence of non-native brook_trout (levin et al. 2002). while the impacts of dams, hatchery practices, harvest and habitat degradation have been focal points of research and policy discussions (nrc 1996), less is known about how non-native ﬁshes limit salmonid population growth rates (i.e., limit recovery) and what actions may be needed to mitigate their effects now and in the future (e.g., harvey & kareiva 2005; rahel et al. 2008). the mechanisms by which non-native brook_trout affect native salmonids may vary depending upon the age and stage of the ﬁsh that are interacting. predation, exploitative competition and interference competition are often cited as potential mechanisms (moyle et al. 1986; krueger & may 1991), though identifying and distinguishing the relative importance of these can be difﬁcult without controlled experiments (fausch 1988, 2008; dunham et al. 2004; blanchet et al. 2008a,b). while predation is a likely culprit in many systems, more subtle effects, such as competition for foraging territories, may be as harmful when considering the viability of populations (moyle et al. 1986). this may be especially true for anadromous salmonids sympatric with resident salmonids, as is often the case in the paciﬁc northwest. juvenile anadromous salmonids often migrate before reaching the mean size of resident salmonids (achord et al. 2007; sanderson unpub- lished data), and consequently they may compete with and be displaced by larger resident ﬁshes in their natal streams. factors that individual growth may ultimately limit population growth (biro et al. 2003; blanchet et al. 2007; baldwin et al. 2009), because growth at the freshwater stage is critical for survival (zabel & achord 2004). while non-native ﬁsh are by no means the only predators or the only competitors affecting juvenile salmonids, their presence may increase the cumulative stress juvenile salmonids experience in their freshwater habitat. limit although brook_trout distributions overlap at least partially with threatened and endangered anadromous salmonids, little has been done to examine potential effects of brook_trout on these native ﬁsh. the few studies that have considered potential effects have focused on large scale patterns (e.g., survival over 6–9 months, habitat quality scored on landscape scale; levin et al. 2002; achord et al. 2003), and do not explicitly address mechanisms. for example, levin et al. (2002) reported that juvenile survival was 12% less for tagged juvenile chinook salmon originating from salmon 140 river basin streams in which brook_trout were present compared to chinook salmon originating from streams lacking brook_trout. the correlation of brook_trout presence and declining salmon is compelling but we currently lack an understanding of any mechanisms of effect. in addition, working with a threatened or endangered species (in this case the threatened snake river spring ⁄ summer-run chinook salmon esu, http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/esa-salmon- listings/salmon-populations/chinook/index.cfm) in the wild carries further challenges given the severe restrictions in the number of ﬁsh one can collect or handle. therefore, the objectives of our study were to evaluate the potential effects of non-native brook_trout on endangered juvenile chinook salmon with a minimally intrusive approach. we use diet data from a limited number of individuals along with extensive ﬁeld observations of salmon and brook_trout together in natural streams to quantify competition or predation interactions between brook_trout and salmon. we hope to better understand how non-native species may affect threatened native anadromous species. methods study system in august and september 2003, we observed and collected ﬁsh in a 200-m reach of summit creek in the payette national forest in idaho, usa (lat. 45°14¢n, long. 115°54¢w). summit creek is a second order the secesh river and ultimately the tributary of columbia river, and was selected for this study because of the high density of brook_trout (bt) relative to juvenile chinook salmon (ch) (2:3 bt to ch in august 2003). other potential competitors and ⁄ or aquatic predators of juvenile ﬁsh in summit creek were less abundant and include three native ﬁsh species, rainbow trout ⁄ steelhead oncorhynchus my- kiss, bull trout, sculpin cottus spp., and the idaho giant salamander dicamptodon aterrimus. in this stream, we have observed chinook salmon spawning in late summer, emerging in the following spring and outmi- grating in the late summer and fall of that year. brook_trout reside in the stream for their entire life. they spawn in the fall and fry emerge in the late spring and summer. summit creek is a relatively pristine, moderate- sized (wetted width 6.7 ± 1.9 m), low gradient stream that meanders through meadows of grass, dwarf birch betula nana and willow salix sp. discharge during our )1. mean mid-channel observations averaged 0.2 m3æs depth (±sd) and maximum depth across the reach were 0.44 m (0.28) and 1.04 m, respectively. beaver dams altered habitat upstream and downstream of the aggressive behaviours between non-native trout and endangered salmon reach, but there were no dams within 100 m of either end of our study reach. habitat area was approxi- mately 46% glide, 38% pool, 13% rifﬂe and 4% run. boulders, root wads and undercut banks provided cover for ﬁsh; there was no large woody debris in the reach. diet analysis and drift to assess the potential for diet overlap and competi- tion for food, we compared brook_trout and chinook salmon stomach contents, their diet overlap and their relative selectivity of prey items from the drift. because this chinook salmon population is listed as threatened under the u.s. endangered species act, surveying and collection permits allowed only mini- mal handling and take of all ﬁsh species and minimal disturbance to the habitat in general. fish were collected using hook and line in the late afternoon on 26 august and 27 august 2003 (nbt = 12, nch = 5), and by electroshocking early afternoon of 21 september 2003 (nbt = 5, nch = 5). we used both methods to minimise disturbance to the habitat while ensuring we collected a range of sizes for both species; however, due to the small sample size and the possibility that using different capture methods may bias diet data, we interpret diet data cautiously. fish were killed using ms222, measured (total length to nearest mm), weighed (to nearest 0.01 g), and stomachs were dissected and preserved in 70% ethanol. invertebrates in stomachs were identiﬁed at least to order using a binocular microscope and were categorised as terrestrial or aquatic (aquatic insect adults were considered aquatic). to compare the size of prey items in their diets and selectivity of prey items by size, individuals were measured (to nearest 0.1 mm). biomass of individual invertebrates in the diets and drift was calculated using taxon-speciﬁc regressions relating head capsule width to body length (a. goodwin, nwfsc, unpublished data) and body length to biomass (rogers et al. 1977; smock 1980; meyer 1989; benke et al. 1999; mercer et al. 2001, and m. wipﬂi, usda forest service, unpublished data). to compare gut fullness, we measured ash-free dry mass (afdm) of the entire stomach content for each ﬁsh (dried 24 h at 60 °c and ashed 4 h at 500 °c, weighed to nearest 0.1 mg) and calculated fullness [(afdm stomach contents, mg)æ )1]. differences between species in (wet mass ﬁsh, g) their gut fullness, mean prey size and total prey items were analysed with ﬁsh length as a covariate (anco- va). diet overlap between brook_trout and chinook salmon was calculated as schoener’s overlap index: the head capsules of all cxy ¼ 100ð1   0:5ðrjpxi   pyijþþ; where cxy is the percent overlap, and pxi and pyi are the proportions of each prey type by number (aquatic insect order or ‘terrestrial’) in the averaged brook_trout and chinook salmon diets, respectively, summed over all prey types (described in bowen 1996). overlap was calculated ﬁrst with all ﬁsh [n = 27; mean (sd) size: chinook salmon 67.2 (10.2) mm; and brook_trout 121.9 (38) mm], and then with all chinook salmon and small brook_trout (range: 60–120 mm, n = 9) to determine if diet overlap was greater between similarly sized ﬁsh. we used a canonical correspondence analysis (cca) based permutation test to determine if the two species could be distinguished by the proportions of different prey types consumed (permu- tation test for cca in the ‘vegan’ package in r http:// www.r-project.org/). invertebrate drift samples were collected within the observational reach on 29 august 2003 (two 30-min samples taken between 17:30 and 20:30 hours) and 21 september 2003 (three 15-min samples taken between 10:30 and 13:30 hours). to avoid disturbing the drift during collections, we restricted ﬁsh observations to sections at least 15 m downstream of nets on these days. drift nets (45 cm · 31 cm, 363-lm mesh) were positioned approximately 5 cm above the benthos such that drift in the water column and surface, but not the benthos, was sampled. to determine water volume through the net, we measured current velocity in front of the nets with a swoffer 3000 ﬂow meter (swoffer instruments, seattle, wa, usa), and calculated drift )3). drift invertebrate density density (invertebratesæm and composition were similar across months and samples were therefore pooled. invertebrates were measured and identiﬁed as above. fish preference for prey items was estimated for each ﬁsh as: l ¼ ri   pi; where ri is the relative proportion of prey type i in the diet and pi is the relative proportion of prey type i in the drift (strauss 1979). we compared the sizes (head capsule widths and biomasses) of prey items in the stomachs and drift (anova) to determine if consumed prey were larger than available prey. behavioural observations chinook salmon and brook_trout were observed by snorkelers to assess the distributional overlap of the ﬁsh and the nature of their interactions. the snorkeler selected individual focal ﬁsh (ff) by starting at a random point within the 200-m reach and observing every fourth chinook salmon encountered and every brook_trout encountered. because similarly sized chinook salmon could be observed at high densities, every fourth chinook salmon encountered was observed instead of every one to minimise the chance 141 macneale et al. of observing the same ff twice in 1 day. because brook_trout were more variable in size and less abundant, snorkelers could easily distinguish among individual brook_trout within the observational area. the snorkeler observed each ff for 5 min, recorded the observations, and moved upstream to locate the next ff. the following information was recorded: size (to nearest 5 mm) and species of the ff, water depth and position of ﬁsh in water column, range of distance moved, feeding strikes (including number from the benthos, mid-column and surface), time of observation and the density and composition of ﬁsh within immediate vicinity of the ff (i.e., up to 6 m2). in addition, for each ff, the snorkeler recorded the species, size and position of up to three nearest neighbouring ﬁshes (within 1–2 m), time each neigh- bour (n) spent near the ff (within 2 m), number of aggressive encounters between the ff and each n, and number of times the ff and ⁄ or n was displaced or shifted position in the stream following an encounter. the decision to make detailed observations of no more than three neighbours was based on feasibility, but conveniently, no ff had encounters with more than three neighbours during our observations. aggressive encounters included ﬂashes, nips, and chases (chap- man 1962; hartman 1965), and displacement was deﬁned as any movement away (‡3 cm) from a previously occupied position as a result of an encounter. duration of displacement was not mea- sured. water temperature for each 5-min observation was recorded with a data logging thermometer (stowaway tidbit logger; onset computer corpo- ration, bourne, ma, usa) deployed in the reach. during 18 days of observation in august and september 2003, four snorkelers observed a total of 278 ff [156 chinook salmon (ch) and 122 brook_trout (bt)]. distances and ﬁsh sizes were estimated using rulers attached to gloves and underwater clipboards. we attempted to control for potential bias among observers through extensive training. to quan- tify variation among observers, multiple observers observed the same ff at the same time and recorded data independently for eight of the ff throughout the 2 months of observations. distance and size estimates and counts of feeding strikes varied on average <5%, and there was no variation in the number of encounters recorded. these differences among observers seem reasonable given the ﬁeld conditions, but nonetheless, observer identity was included in all models to account for any error due to observer. the presence of an observer did not appear to affect ﬁsh upstream of the observer (e.g., no observed increase in movement or change in activity as snorkeler approached), but to minimise any potential inﬂuence, observers remained at least 1 m downstream of each ff throughout the observation period. 142 for the analyses described below, local ﬁsh density was deﬁned as the number of ﬁsh per m2 for each ff at the time of observation (i.e., neighbours that were watched closely and any other ﬁsh that were present for >5 s in the area during the observation). indepen- dent of observations, estimates of average ﬁsh density, composition and size distribution for the whole 200-m reach were generated from whole-reach snorkel surveys done throughout august (n = 6 day and 2 night surveys). statistical analyses field observations of ﬁsh behaviour were analysed with a series of statistical analyses, which were designed to explore how biological and environmental parameters inﬂuenced ﬁsh encounter rates, encounter outcomes and ff feeding activity. because our primary question was whether and how brook_trout affect chinook salmon, we were especially interested in interspeciﬁc differences in encounter and displace- ment rates and the potential effect these interactions had on chinook salmon feeding activity (fig. 1). parameters considered include ff species, size (total length), position of ff in the water column (depth of ﬁsh divided by total depth of water where ﬁsh was observed), the ff’s range of movement (m2), local ﬁsh density (numberæm the number of neighbours (range of 0–3), species and size of neighbours, relative position of neighbour, date, time of day and temper- ature (fig. 1). to explore potential nonlinear relation- ships, we also included a priori the quadratic terms for size, temperature and density. )2), fig. 1. three models under consideration. the environmental and biological parameters that were considered in the various models are in the text boxes, with arrows and numbers indicating if they were included in the encounter (1), outcome of encounters model (2), or the feeding strikes model (3). in addition to the parameters indicated in the text boxes, the feeding strikes model (3) also includes the number and outcome of encounters a ﬁsh experiences. rate model aggressive behaviours between non-native trout and endangered salmon rate (min regression-based models were developed in three sequential stages. the ﬁrst explored the inﬂuence of biological and environmental parameters on the encounter rate between ff and their neighbours (model 1, fig. 1). only ff that had neighbours were included in the analysis (n = 267 ﬁsh). the dependent )1), was square root variable, encounter transformed to meet assumptions of normality. all parameters that were predicted to inﬂuence potentially encounter rate (model 1, fig. 1) were included in a general linear model using backward elimination (alpha-to-enter and alpha-to-remove = 0.05). because we predicted that ﬁsh size within each species may be important, we included the interaction between size and species as a parameter as well. correlations between explanatory parameters were examined to avoid issues of multicollinearity; we choose 0.5 as a threshold and if correlation coefﬁcients were greater than that, we eliminated those that explained less of the variance from the analyses. the second model focused on the outcome of encounters between individuals and parameters that may have affected those outcomes (model 2, fig. 1). encounters included in this analysis resulted in either the ff or its neighbour being displaced from its position in the stream at least temporarily; the 3% of encounters that did not result in a displacement of either ﬁsh were not included. an encounter was considered successful for a ff if the neighbour was displaced; the encounter was unsuccessful if the ff was displaced. the response variable is the proportion of successful encounters between ff and each of its neighbours. only ﬁsh that had encounters were included (n = 155 ff; but because each ff can have more than one n, the total number of ff&n pairs that had at least one encounter was 231). fish sizes were transformed by taking the difference between each pair (nlength ) fflength in mm). because each ff could have multiple neighbours, neighbours were nested by ff but the variables measured were unique for each pair (e.g., encounters between a ff and one n were recorded separately from encounters that ff had with a different n). consequently, we used a mixed-effects model to relate these variables to the probability of a successful outcome. the models were nested logistic regression models and were ﬁt using pseudo likeli- hood techniques (littell et al. 1996). the models, therefore, explicitly account independence of observations of individual ff across time while also accounting for interactions each had with multiple neighbours. prior to analyses and based on our understanding of ﬁsh behaviour from the literature, variables were categorised into two groups based on their predicted importance. primary variables (obser- ver, species, size difference, local ﬁsh density and water temperature, fig. 1) were included initially to for account for error due to variation among observers and because these variables have been found to inﬂuence behaviour in other studies (fausch 1988; glova & field-dodgson 1995; nakano 1995; harvey & na- kamoto 1997; magoulick & wilzbach 1998; kelsey et al. 2002). these variables remained in the model while other variables were ﬁt one at a time (time of day; position in water column; range of movement; all variables relating to the neighbour; quadratic terms for size difference, density and temperature; and interac- tion between species and size difference). we used tests based on the estimate and its standard error and asymptotic normal distribution (wald-type tests). foraging effort, we did not subtract the ﬁnal analysis explored what factors inﬂuenced feeding activity of ffs (model 3, fig. 1). feeding )1) a activity is deﬁned as the number of strikes (min ff made while observed. because observing the item that a ﬁsh was striking was difﬁcult, we deﬁned a feeding strike as when a ff opened its mouth in an apparent effort to consume an item. fish rejected (i.e., to account for spit out) items while foraging, but overall the rejection rate from the strike rate in preliminary analyses. while strike rate is not necessarily a good predictor of consumption rate (biro et al. 1996; mclaughlin et al. 2000), we felt it was the best indicator of foraging activity that could be quantiﬁed through observations alone. we did compare rejection rates (% of strikes that were spit out by each species) when exploring potential explanations for discrepan- cies between strike rates calculated from observed ff and stomach fullness from killed ﬁsh (i.e., ﬁsh collected from the same reach but not necessarily ff). we square-root transformed feeding strike rate and analysed chinook salmon and brook_trout sepa- rately using general linear models with backward elimination alpha-to-re- move = 0.05). in addition to the parameters consid- ered in the other analyses, we included the encounter rate for each ff and its status based on the outcomes of its encounters (model 3, fig. 1). ff status was deﬁned as one of the following: ‘winner’ [displaced its neighbour(s)], ‘loser’ [was displaced by its neigh- bour(s)], ‘even’ (won and lost an equal number of encounters), ‘no encounter’ (had neighbours but had no encounters), or ‘no neighbour’. if a ff had an uneven number of encounters, it was a winner if it won more than it lost and vice versa. (alpha-to-enter and results distribution and size chinook salmon and brook_trout were abundant in summit creek in august, especially compared to native trout [mean (se) totals from eight snorkel 143 macneale et al. surveys of the 200-m reach: 279 (27) ch, 186 (36) bt, 2 (0) rainbow trout and 1 (0) bull trout; no differences between day and night surveys, ch p = 0.65, bt p = 0.15]. overall ﬁsh density, however, was low relative to earlier in the summer when densities of chinook salmon were greater (mean from )2 in june and august, our surveys: 2.7 and 0.4 ﬁshæm respectively). brook_trout were regularly observed lower in the water column and in shallower water compared to chinook salmon. brook_trout, regardless of size, were found closer to the stream substrate [mean (sd) distance from substrate: bt = 8.8 (7.9) cm and ch = 23.6 (18.6) cm; ancova with ﬁsh length as a covariate, fspecies = 58.6, p < 0.0001, flength = 0.7, p = 0.40]. although larger ﬁsh of both species held in deeper water, on average chinook salmon were found in deeper stream sections [mean stream depth at observation location: bt = 47.3 (22.2) cm and ch = 54.0 (22.0) cm; ancova with ﬁsh length as a covariate, fspecies = 29.1, p < 0.0001, flength = 40.8, p < 0.0001]. that said, the habitats that the two species occupied were often in close proxim- ity. for example, 55% of focal chinook salmon were within 1 m of a brook_trout. during observations, chinook salmon tended to be more active than brook_trout. chinook moved farther laterally and up- and downstream compared to brook_trout (mean lateral radius ch: 7.5 · body length and bt: 4.4 · body length, p < 0.0001; mean longitudinal radius ch: 8.4 · body length, bt: 6.5 · body length, p = 0.02). life histories and the presence of multiple age classes of brook_trout, chinook salmon were on average approximately 35 mm shorter than brook_trout [mean (sd) total length from surveys: ch = 65 (10) mm, bt = 101 (43) mm], and their size ranges were quite different (ch: 40–130 mm, bt: 20–300 mm). while 62% of the brook_trout were 85 mm or longer, only 3% of chinook salmon were that size or (likely precocious males). therefore, length (i.e., size) was often a signiﬁcant covariate in our analyses when examining species differences. because of their different longer fig. 2. mean (se) proportion of feeding strikes from the stream substrate, water column or water surface by focal brook_trout and chinook salmon. feeding chinook salmon and brook_trout fed primarily from the water column, though differences between species in their benthic and surface feeding rates suggest some partitioning of available food resources (fig. 2). overall, there was only moderate overlap in diets (39%) between the two species, and even less overlap (27%) in the diets of small brook_trout (£120 mm) relative to similarly sized chinook salmon. the cca- based permutation tests comparing proportions of prey types consumed (all ﬁsh f = 4.95, p < 0.001; simi- larly sized ﬁsh f = 7.95, p < 0.001) and the selectiv- ity indices (table 1) also indicate that diets and feeding behaviour differed signiﬁcantly between spe- cies. brook_trout selected trichoptera larvae and chinook salmon preferred terrestrial insects (table 1). although both species exhibited little preference for other prey types ()0.2 £ l < 0.2), differences in selectivity between brook_trout and chinook salmon were signiﬁcant for four of ﬁve of the main prey types (table 1). independent of prey type, both brook_trout and chinook salmon selected the largest prey available [mean (sd) head capsule width of consumed prey versus drifting prey, 0.60 (0.30) and 0.39 (0.21) mm, table 1. composition and selectivity of prey captured by brook_trout (bt), chinook (ch) and drift nets (drift samples from august and september pooled). selectivity values are mean (sd) l-values, and ** indicates a signiﬁcant difference between ch and bt in their selectivity of that prey type (mann–whitney u-test, p < 0.01 for all). other aquatic invertebrates include primarily water mites (acari). aquatic coleoptera, aquatic hemiptera and plecoptera each composed <3% of the mean number of prey items consumed by ﬁsh and captured in the drift. selectivity indicies calculated separately for ﬁsh collected in august and september did not differ for any prey type and therefore averages are presented here. prey selected (%) selectivity ch 41.0 32.2 21.2 1.8 3.9 bt 14.8 11.5 9.3 32.8 31.6 prey available (%) ch bt 10.1 34.6 21.2 14.4 19.7 0.26 (0.19) 0.01 (0.16) )0.01 (0.15) )0.12 (0.04) )0.15 (0.01) 0.06 (0.28)** )0.20 (0.17)** )0.13 (0.18)** 0.29 (0.31)** 0.01 (0.27) prey type terrestrial invertebrates ephemeroptera aquatic diptera trichoptera other aquatic invertebrates 144 aggressive behaviours between non-native trout and endangered salmon 0.25 (0.70) mg, respectively, respectively, p < 0.0001;

table 3), indicating chinook salmon were relatively aggressive for their size. overall, however, chinook salmon were displaced in 72% of the encounters with brook_trout (50 of 69 interspeciﬁc encounters, table 3). (in 5 of 55 encounters, behavioural models there was only slight evidence of multicollinearity between explanatory variables. stream water temper- ature ranged from 8.1 to 17.1 °c, and was correlated with time of day (r = 0.53) and with date (r = )0.75). therefore, only water temperature was included in the analyses. the rest of the explanatory variables had absolute correlations <0.4. residual analyses did not indicate from regression model assumptions. any departures fish encountered their neighbours often, but param- eters included in the model of encounter rate explain <20% of the variation (table 4a). brook_trout expe- rienced fewer encounters than chinook salmon [mean )1: bt = 0.33 (0.34), ch = 0.41 (se) encountersæmin (0.38), p = 0.05], but this was dependent in part on ﬁsh size (table 4a). trends in the ff size versus encounter rate illustrate that larger chinook salmon (primarily precocious males that had over wintered in the stream) had the highest encounter rates, while encounter rate decreased for the largest brook_trout (fig. 3); this pattern is supported by the signiﬁcant interaction between species and size (table 4a). ff with more nearby neighbours had slightly more encounters temperature was (table 4a). water table 2. chinook salmon (ch) and brook_trout (bt) feeding strike rates and diet analyses. feeding strike rates are calculated from observational data, and measures of prey and stomach fullness are calculated from killed ﬁsh. regression analyses were performed initially to test for an interaction between species and ﬁsh length. if the p-value for the interaction was >0.10, we proceeded with ancova, using ﬁsh length as the covariate. if the p-value for length was >0.10 in the ancova, we removed it from the analyses. bold values are signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). strike and strike)rejection rates were square-root transformed, and stomach fullness was log transformed. mean (sd) ch bt fspecies, p-value flength, p-value fspecies·length, p-value feeding strikes (strikesæmin)1) net feeding strikes [(strikes)rejections)æmin)1] number of prey (# ⁄ stomach) prey size (mean head capsule width, mm) prey size (mean calculated biomass, mg) stomach fullness 5.9 (2.9) 5.4 (3.0) 28.3 (14.5) 0.61 (0.14) 0.45 (0.63) 6.8 (3.0) 3.0 (2.4) 2.7 (2.3) 23.7 (21.6) 0.52 (0.14) 0.45 (1.49) 3.4 (3.4) 10.46, 0.001 13.09, <0.001 0.35, 0.56 4.89, 0.04 3.39, 0.06 0.55, 0.46 19.97, <0.001 19.67, <0.001 ns 3.10, 0.10 6.72, 0.01 9.84, 0.005 3.79, 0.05 5.91, 0.02 ns ns ns ns 145 macneale et al. table 3. the number and outcomes of encounters experienced by focal ﬁsh. each focal ﬁsh (ff) was observed for 5 min and the number of encounters each had with each of its neighbours (n) was recorded. there were a total of 231 ff and n pairs (i.e., some ff had encounters with more than one n). encounters between a ff and its n were either between a chinook and chinook or a brook_trout and brook_trout (intraspeciﬁc) or between a chinook and brook_trout or brook_trout and chinook (interspeciﬁc). relative size refers to whether a focal ﬁsh was smaller, equal in size or larger than its neighbour. ff species (no. observed) percent with ‡1 encounters chinook (156) 63 brook_trout (122) 53 total encounters intraspeciﬁc encounters interspeciﬁc encounters ff&n pairs relative size percent in which ff displaced n total encounters percent in which ff displaced n total encounters 140 91 25 ff < n 73 ff = n 100 ff > n sum (% of ch total) ff < n ff = n ff > n sum (% of bt total) 3 64 100 28 37 43 108 (77) 30 11 13 54 (59) 15 – 100 0 0 97 26 0 6 32 (23) 7 1 29 37 (41) table 4. final statistical models used for examining behaviour. final model for (a) the encounter rate analysis (r2 = 0.19) and (b) the outcomes of encounters analysis. the model is a nested logistic regression model with each focal ﬁsh able to have up to three neighbours, thus the varying number of degrees of freedom. final variables selected in backward elimination analyses to explain feeding activity of (c) chinook and (d) brook_trout (ch: r2 = 0.38;

however, because most brook_trout were on average 35 mm larger than their chinook salmon neighbours, brook_trout displaced chinook salmon in the majority of their encounters (table 3). chinook salmon feeding activity was inﬂuenced positively by temperature and negatively by number of encounters (based on model in table 4c and individual scatter plots). brook_trout feeding also increased with temperature (based on model in table 4d and individ- ual scatter plots), but unlike chinook salmon, brook_trout feeding activity was inﬂuenced by outcome of encounters (table 4d). brook_trout that lost encounters fed less than both the winners and those without neighbours (fig. 6). brook_trout that lost encounters struck at potential prey less often than those who won encounters and those with no neighbours (anova f = 3.41, p = 0.01, tukey hsd ‘loser’ vs. ‘winner’ p = 0.05, ‘no neighbour’ p = 0.03). although outcome was not signiﬁcant in the model analysing chinook salmon feeding behaviour, a post hoc analysis indicated that chinook salmon with ‘loser’ vs. fig. 5. logistic regression model illustrating the expected proba- bility of a successful outcome given size differences between chinook focal ﬁsh and brook_trout neighbours at three different water minimum, 11.0 °c = mean daily mean and 13.9 °c = mean daily maximum, see text for details).

included in all subsequent analyses. rate at the outcome of an encounter was inﬂuenced by several parameters, most notably the difference in ﬁsh size (table 4b). the expected probability of a suc- cessful encounter drops from one to zero very quickly when ﬁsh are the same size (fig. 4), but the species of ff and neighbours mattered as well (table 4b). chinook salmon ff displaced larger

illustrating the expected proba- bility of a successful outcome given species identities and size differences (all other variables were set at average values). the shapes of the curves reinforce visually what the model output (table 4b) reports, namely species identity and size largely determine the probability of winning or losing. when the focal ﬁsh (ff) was a brook_trout (bt), its probability of losing was greater when it encountered a chinook salmon (ch) neighbour (n) shorter than itself compared to when it encountered another brook_trout shorter than itself. while the chinook versus chinook curve falls largely on the 1:1 line, the chinook versus brook_trout line is shifted to the right, indicating smaller chinook salmon can displace larger brook_trout. macneale et al.

(anova f = 2.87, p = 0.025; tukey hsd for ‘no encounter’ and ‘winner’ comparison p = 0.03; there were no differences among other groups). results of analyses do not change when rejection rates are subtracted from feeding strike rates. in addition, brook_trout feeding increased with range of movement, and larger brook_trout struck at fewer items compared to smaller trout. the signiﬁcance of the size-squared term and the plot of those data indicate that there was a decline in feeding activity with brook_trout size, but at the largest sizes, activity increased again slightly. discussion agonistic in our study, intraspeciﬁc encounters were more frequent than interspeciﬁc encounters, and differences in ﬁsh size largely determined the outcome of the encounters. while larger ﬁsh usually displaced smaller ﬁsh, several chinook salmon displaced larger brook_trout. interestingly, chinook salmon feeding activity was reduced as encounter rates increased but was not inﬂuenced by the outcome of the encounters, suggest- interactions ing that and intraspeciﬁc encounters may limit their growth. the small size and low density of available prey suggest that there large prey items within may be competition for chinook salmon and within brook_trout, but their diets and feeding behaviours suggest that competition between species is unlikely. therefore, we speculate that intraspeciﬁc interactions may be more important in inﬂuencing chinook salmon behaviour and feeding than direct interspeciﬁc interactions with brook_trout. it is possible that brook_trout may additionally affect chinook salmon via interference competition, how- ever, we suspect this effect may be minor compared to intraspeciﬁc processes noted in this study. potential competition for food and risk of predation based on diets, there was little evidence that chinook salmon and brook_trout compete directly for prey in 148 late summer. chinook salmon and brook_trout were similar in that they selected large prey items, but differed in types of prey they selected (table 1). the minimal diet overlap and the observed differences in feeding positions (fig. 2) suggest that there was some partitioning of resources. we note that preference for trichoptera by brook_trout was probably exaggerated because selectivity values were calculated from drift only, and brook_trout were probably consuming trichoptera from the benthos as well as from drift. throughout their native and introduced ranges, brook_trout and chinook salmon feed on a diversity of invertebrates (and when larger, on ﬁsh), and often consume the largest, most abundant prey (sagar & glova 1987; rondorf et al. 1990; mclaughlin et al. 1999; mistak et al. 2003). our observations that brook_trout foraged over smaller areas, were positioned lower in the water column, and struck at fewer items than chinook salmon are consistent with other studies of brook_trout (tucker & rasmussen 1999; morinville & rasmussen 2003), and suggest that brook_trout metabolic costs are likely relatively low compared to chinook salmon in this system (tucker & rasmussen 1999; sweka et al. 2004). likewise, our observation that brook_trout fed occasionally from the benthos while chinook salmon rarely fed there further suggests different use of microhabitats (power 1980; healey 1991). the diversity of prey that each species selects across systems, however, suggests that both species are opportunistic (power 1980; healey 1991; sweka & hartman 2008). for example, brook_trout fed oppor- tunistically on aquatic insect larvae when alone but fed primarily on terrestrial insects when sympatric with atlantic salmon salmo_salar (thonney & gibson 1989; mookerji et al. 2004). chinook salmon can also respond to variation in food availability, namely switching to terrestrial invertebrates when availability of aquatic invertebrates is low (perry et al. 2003). in our study, feeding rates of both brook_trout and chinook salmon increased with temperature, but chinook salmon rates were consistently higher across all temperatures. magoulick & wilzbach (1998) found competing brook and rainbow trout both had higher prey capture rates at a high temperature (18 vs. 13 °c), but relative growth rates decreased at the higher temperature for both species as well. especially encounters, several lines of evidence point to intense intraspe- ciﬁc competition for prey. first, high rates of intra- speciﬁc among chinook salmon, indicate that feeding territories were defended aggressively. this may result from low drift density of terrestrial invertebrates (chinook’s dominant prey) compared to other salmonid bearing streams (hilder- brand & kershner 2004). in addition, prey were small; for instance, the mean head capsule width of prey aggressive behaviours between non-native trout and endangered salmon than what grant et al. items consumed by brook_trout in the north fork of the humboldt river in nevada was 2.4 mm (dunham et al. 2000), which is nearly 1 mm larger than the largest item consumed in this study. territory size may also indicate food limitation; the area over which brook_trout moved in 5 min was greater (especially the lateral distance) (1989) observed, and mean chinook salmon movements were much further than those of brook_trout. although no brook_trout consumed chinook salmon in this study, the discovery of a 35-mm sculpin in the stomach of a 178-mm brook_trout indicates that small chinook salmon may be at risk of predation when they emerge from the gravel in the spring and encounter age-1 and older brook_trout. brook_trout as small as 78 mm have been found to consume salmon fry (henderson & letcher 2003), and brook_trout ‡300 mm probably feed primarily on ﬁsh (keeley & grant 2001). potential interference competition the outcome of those encounters suggest the high intraspeciﬁc encounter rate among chinook salmon and decline in feeding activity with the rate but not that intraspeciﬁc interactions may be more important than interspeciﬁc interactions in this study. that said interspeciﬁc encounters (23%, table 3) and the dis- proportionate rate (72%) at which chinook salmon were displaced may be an additional stress. foraging territories are established and maintained through interference competition, and the importance of body size in securing and defending high quality territories has been well documented for many salmo- nids (chapman 1966; fausch 1984; nakano 1995; nakano et al. 1998; young 2004). for example, nakano (1995) found that interactions between native and sympatric white-spotted charr salvelinus leuco- maenis and masu salmon oncorhynchus_masou masou in japan were dependent on size, with size and dominance rank (i.e., the outcome of interactions) highly correlated. his results also indicate that species identity may be important. similar to our results, he found that smaller salmon were able to displace larger charr (that were up to 20% heavier) (nakano 1995). in summit creek, chinook salmon were similarly aggressive, but because they were on average so much smaller than brook_trout, their aggression was not generally great enough to overcome large size differ- ences. the effect of temperature on the outcome of encounters indicated that the chinook salmon in summit creek had a relative advantage at cooler temperatures. likewise, rodtka & volpe (2007) found that bull trout were competitively disadvantaged when paired with brook_trout in warmer water (15 vs. 8 °c), but magoulick & wilzbach (1998) found that rainbow trout were competitively disadvantaged when paired with brook_trout regardless of temperature (13 and 18 °c). others have found that salmonid activity can be affected by prey availability, hunger, presence of predators as well as social dominance (gotceitas & godin 1991; damsgard & dill 1998; blanchet et al. 2008a), and individuals may respond differently to these factors depending on their size (mccarthy et al. 1992; mclaughlin et al. 1999). for example, individ- ual differences in responses to predators, namely risky behaviours by smaller individuals, allowed for small coho salmon to grow despite a size-dominance hierarchy (reinhardt 1999). while we found no effect of density on feeding rates or on the frequency or outcome of encounters, density may affect ﬁsh indirectly by reducing the availability of large high quality prey items at the reach scale. one interesting note regarding encounter rates is that on average, ﬁsh had more than one encounter during the 5-min observation period. extrapolated over the growing season (assumed mid-may through september), typical individual chinook salmon and brook_trout may have over 40,000 and 32,000 encounters, respectively (conservatively assuming ﬁsh )1). given the inverse are active for at least 12 hæday relationship between feeding activity and encounter rate, a chinook salmon encountering one neighbour every 10 min would feed 36% more than one encountering a neighbour every minute. while these are estimates based on short observation periods and scaling these to predict effects on populations is challenging (peckarsky et al. 1997), the potential cumulative effects of such encounters may be signif- icant and affect downstream survival. for instance, zabel & achord (2004) found that the relative size of a ﬁsh within its natal population was more important for survival than its relative size among stream popula- tions. uncertainties and implications for salmon recovery the importance of brook_trout and the potential effect of removing them remain unclear. for instance, brook_trout’s consumption of rare, large prey items (e.g., large terrestrial insects) and the high rate at which they displaced chinook salmon when they encountered them may be signiﬁcant additional stresses for juvenile chinook salmon that may be primarily competing amongst themselves. but how would chinook salmon respond in the absence of brook_trout? there are no chinook salmon streams in the region that do not also contain some resident trout or charr; therefore, if brook_trout were removed, it is possible that some other resident ﬁsh would colonise the reach (or rebound in numbers). some studies suggest that 149 macneale et al. these other ﬁsh may not be functionally equivalent to brook_trout; for example, when rainbow and brook_trout were paired, brook_trout were more aggressive, captured more prey and grew faster than rainbow trout (cunjak & green 1984; magoulick & wilzbach 1998). and yet, in chinook salmon streams, the size distri- butions and aggressive behaviours of native and non- native trout are quite similar (kelsey et al. 2002). this suggests that size differences we observed between chinook salmon and trout in summit would be typical of other streams, and size differences of that magni- tude may have a greater effect than species identity (e.g., nakano 1995). identifying the mechanism(s) of impact that a non- native species has on an endangered ﬁsh may be as difﬁcult as trying to mediate the impact, but without some understanding of the mechanism, restoration efforts may fail. in general, if a population is declining coincident with the establishment of a non-native species, analyses should include observations that quantify potential risks of predation and competition, including spatial overlap among species, predator avoidance, aggressive encounters, and prey availabil- ity and selection. avoidance of non-natives or com- petition with them for food and ⁄ or territories may affect individual growth rates of endangered species and ultimately limit their population growth. ulti- mately, carefully designed brook_trout removal studies are needed to test these hypotheses. acknowledgements we thank adam goodwin, jennifer jones and annalissa ritchie for conducting many of the observations. we thank chau tran, jon drake, jon reum, tyler ritchie, adam
