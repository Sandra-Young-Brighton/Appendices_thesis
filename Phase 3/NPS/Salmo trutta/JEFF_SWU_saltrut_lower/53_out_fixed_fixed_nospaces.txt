danish lakes. ecology of freshwater fish 2006: 15: 180–190. ó blackwell munksgaard, 2006 abstract – the horizontal distribution of ﬁsh in lakes varies with species, age, predation risk, vegetation coverage and water clarity. although sporadic data are available for speciﬁc lakes, little is known about how habitat distribution generally changes along a gradient in nutrients and clarity. here we analyse littoral and pelagic ﬁsh catch data for 34 danish lakes (covering 94 lake years) with contrasting total phosphorus (tp) concentrations and mean depth levels (but mainly eutrophic and shallow). electroﬁshing was conducted during day along the shore or along the edge of the reed belt if such existed. gill nets were set overnight for 18 h in open water. we calculated a littoral proportion as: litpro ¼ (100 · number caught by electroﬁshing in the near-shore area)/(number caught by electroﬁshing in the near-shore area and nets in the open water). at all summer tp concentrations litpro was high for several ‘littoral’ species such as gudgeon (gobio gobio), rudd (scardinius erythrophtalmus) and pike (esox lucius) and low for more typical pelagic species like pikeperch (sander lucioperca), ruffe (gymnocephalus cernuus) and smelt (osmerus eperlanus). however, for many of these species including the dominant roach (rutilus rutilus) and perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) litpro increased with tp or lake water chlorophyll a (chla) for ﬁsh >10 cm, suggesting a more littoral distribution with increasing turbidity. exceptions are pikeperch and bream (abramis brama). for bream, litpro increased signiﬁcantly with mean lake depth only. for ﬁsh £10 cm litpro showed only a weak relationship to tp, chla or depth. in accordance with the tp-dependent distribution, major changes occurred in the ﬁsh community structure during the monitoring period following nutrient loading reduction. a comparison of litpro from the ﬁrst part of the monitoring period (1989–1993) with a subsequent period (1997–2003) for four abundant species showed a signiﬁcant decline in litpro over time for large- and small-sized roach and perch and large rudd. this suggests a fast response in ﬁsh distribution to improved water quality. it further demonstrates that ﬁsh monitoring in lakes should cover both littoral and pelagic habitats to describe the recovery process. e. jeppesen1, 2, z. pekcan-hekim3, t. l.

accepted for publication september 20, 2005 introduction the distribution of ﬁsh in lakes varies with species type, age and the risk of predation by piscivores and birds (werner & hall 1988; gliwicz & jachner 1992; brabrand & faafeng 1993; bean & winﬁeld 1995; persson & crowder 1997; jepsen & berg 2002; lewin et al. 2004). in addition, coverage, density and doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00142.x 180 habitat distribution of ﬁsh in late summer in danish lakes composition of aquatic plants as well as type and coverage of woody structures are important (persson & crowder 1997; jeppesen et al. 2000). also water clarity is a key factor, because high water clarity enhances the risk of predation by visually foraging piscivorous ﬁsh and birds (gliwicz & jachner 1992; jepsen & berg 2002; jacobsen et al. 2004) and indirectly also affects submerged plant growth. major are changes seen in ﬁsh community structure and abundance of predatory ﬁsh along a nutrient gradient in northern temperate lakes, ranging from dominance by percids and pike under meso- trophic conditions to exclusive dominance by cyp- rinids in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes (colby et al. 1972; persson et al. 1988; jeppesen et al. 2000; olin et al. 2002; but see mehner et al. 2005). consequently, the predation pressure from piscivores decreases and competition among planktivores and benthivores intensiﬁes (persson et al. 1988), as also suggested by a reduction in the size of perch and cyprinids (jeppesen et al. 2000). one may therefore expect pronounced changes to occur in ﬁsh habitat distribution along a gradient in total phosphorus (tp). here, we use results from the danish national monitoring programme on lakes (gill netting in open water and electroﬁshing along shores) by the national environmental research institute in cooper- ation with the 14 danish counties to describe changes in the horizontal distribution along a tp gradient in 34 lakes monitored one to three times during a 14-year study period. during this period the water quality of most lakes improved due to reduced external loading of phosphorus (jeppesen et al. 2002; søndergaard et al. 2002). this has led to profound changes in the ﬁsh community in the form of decreased abundance of plankti-benthivorous ﬁsh, a larger share of perch and a higher percentage of predatory ﬁsh (jeppesen et al. 2002, 2005a,b). thus we also wish to trace whether changes in habitat distribution of ﬁsh have occurred during this period concurrently with a decline in tp and chlorophyll a (chla). methods physicochemical and morphological data on the 34 lakes included in the study are given in table 1. the lakes covered a broad range of lake types but were mainly shallow and eutrophic. fish sampling was conducted in each lake in four to six sections, the number depending on lake area and shore line length (mortensen et al. 1990). each lake was divided into equal sized pies (four to six) with a mid-lake station acting as centre. electroﬁsh- ing was conducted with a pulsating dc generator table 1. physicochemical variables for the 34 lakes included. mean median minimum maximum area (ha) mean depth (m) total phosphorus (lgæpæl chlorophyll a (lgæl

1300 w along 300-m littoral zone stretches selected in the middle of each section or in the larger lakes along two 300-m littoral zones located 1/3 and 2/3 within the sections. in each of these zones electroﬁshing from boat was underta- ken once along the shore or, if such occurred, at the edge (inside/outside) of the reed belt. the duration of the electroﬁshing typically lasted 30–60 min depend- ing on vegetation and sediment conditions (e.g. reeds, tree roots, shore-line features). the time used was adjusted to obtain similar catch efforts at all stretches. we cannot judge if this was fully achieved, but we believe that several hours of ﬁshing per lake and the fact that most of the test ﬁshing was performed by specialised companies secure the robustness of the data. gill netting was conducted outside the littoral zone. the nets used were made of monoﬁle nylon. they were 1.5 m deep, 42 m long and consisted of 14 units of 3 m with different mesh sizes placed in random order (6.25, 8, 16.5, 75, 38, 25, 12.5, 33, 50, 22, 43, 30, 60, 10 mm). in each section sinking nets were set perpendicular to the shore with the smallest mesh size (6.25 mm) placed approximately 2 m outside the outer edge of the reed belt. other sinking nets were set parallel to the shore, from approximately 200–250 m within the same littoral zones and at a distance of c. 25 m from the shore. in addition, sinking pelagic nets, and in deep lakes also ﬂoating nets, were set 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of the distance from the shore to the lake middle, and with the 6.25 mm mesh size placed towards land. the sinking pelagic nets were set halfway towards the bottom. in lakes with thermocline and oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion, the nets were set immediately above the thermocline. the nets were set in late afternoon and retrieved the following morning (after c. 18 h). the total number of nets used per lake depended on the mean depth distribution (mortensen et al. 1990) (table 2) and ranged between 18 and 66. the nets were equally distributed in each of four to six sections. the sampling was conducted between 15 august and 15 september when ﬁsh larvae have reached a size at which they are likely caught in the gill nets (with the exception of small roach of 3– 3.5 cm). catch per unit effort of planktivorous ﬁsh was calculated as mean catch per net per sampling. we 181 jeppesen et al. table 2.

pooled data from the mid-lake and open littoral instead of analysing them separately as information on where the speciﬁc nets were set was lacking for many of the lakes. thus, we are only comparing differences between catches near shore (along areas with tree roots, reeds, stones/sand, etc.) with catches outside this zone, whether littoral or truly pelagic. for the analyses, we ﬁrst calculated an average of net catches (number per net per night for each species) and electroﬁshed catches (number per section per sampling) divided into ﬁsh £10 cm and >10 cm (fork length). we use this division among size classes as the catches for the majority of the study lakes were assigned to these two classes only. subsequently, the ratio was calculated as: litpro ¼ (100 · number caught by electroﬁshing)/(number caught by electro- ﬁshing and nets). we present the data as boxplots for six different tp groups. we performed linear regres- sions between litpro and summer mean (1 may to 1 october) concentrations of tp and mean depth – all log-transformed. for some species individuals are found that are smaller than the smallest meshes of the gill nets (i.e. <3.5–4 cm fork length), but which are caught by electroﬁshing. litpro is therefore over- estimated if these ﬁsh are present in the pelagic or perform night-time migration to the pelagic, but are not caught in the nets. to estimate the importance of including ﬁsh £4 cm in the catches, calculations were made of litpro with and without this size class for the lakes on which such information exists (table 3). with the exception of sunbleak (leucaspius delinia- tus) and bleak (alburnus alburnus) (only few lakes with data on these species) and small bream, there are no essential differences (£5% on average) between litpro when including or excluding the small size class (table 3). the same applies when analysing the individual tp classes and depth categories (data not shown). to base our analysis on a signiﬁcantly higher number of lakes, we therefore chose not to consider the potential bias. however, we omitted the most 182 2 2 (1) pikeperch (35) 37 ± 26 perch (11) 37 ± 38 ruffe tench (3) 100 ± 0

macrophyte samplings, each lake was divided into a number of areas depending on lake size, wind exposure, sediment characteristics and bottom slope (for details see lauridsen et al. 2003). within each area, the vegetation was characterised according to depth intervals ranging from 0.25 m in shallow lakes to 1.0 m in deep lakes with steep slopes. within every depth interval, at least 10 observations were made on submerged macrophyte coverage (cov), height and water mean depth using a water glass in combination with a rake. the vegetation was assigned to the following categories: 0%, 1–5%, 6– 25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, 76–95% and 96–100% coverage. macrophyte coverage was calculated for all areas and the data were subsequently used to determine the total macrophyte covered area in the lake. we also calculated plant volume inhabited (pvi) as: coverage · plant height/water mean depth for each area and subsequently for the lake as a whole. results submerged macrophytes and chlorophyll a three potentially important environmental variables for the habitat distribution of ﬁsh are cov, pvi and chla, the latter acting also as an indicator of water clarity as secchi disc readings are unreliable in many shallow clear-water lakes (because visibility exceeds depth). multiple regression including tp and mean depth as independent variables showed that cov and pvi decreased signiﬁcantly with increasing tp and increasing mean depth, while chla increased with tp but not so with mean depth, though it tended to be lower in deep lakes (fig. 1). habitat distribution of ﬁsh in late summer in

and mean depths were pooled. these species were primarily caught in the near-shore part of the littoral zone (high litpro, fig. 2) and are therefore not likely to have performed extensive nightly migration to the pelagic. litpro for these species increased signiﬁcantly with chla (table 4) and thus with water turbidity. some species, particularly the primarily pelagic pikeperch, ruffe and smelt, exhibited low litpro percentages at all tp levels and did not change with increasing chla (table 4). however, litpro for smelt did increase slightly with tp (table 4). for perch, litpro tended to increase progressively with tp, but more pronoun- cedly with chla (fig. 2, table 4). in contrast, there was a strong positive correlation with chlorophyll a for roach, tench (tinca tinca) and crucian carp (carassius carassius). litpro for pikeperch and ruffe did not change along any of the selected gradients, and only for roach and rudd was litpro related with cov(–) and pvi(–) of submerged macrophytes. for bream, only mean depth contributed signiﬁcantly (table 4). in a multiple regression chla was the most important of the ﬁve selected variables explaining variations in litpro, followed by mean depth and tp; macrophyte variables contribution (table 5). only made negligible a fish smaller and larger than 10 cm it is characteristic that only few relationships between litpro and the selected environmental variables were found for ﬁsh £10 cm, while stronger relation- ships were found for ﬁsh >10 cm (table 5). for pike, pikeperch and ruffe no relationships with any of the variables could be detected, neither alone nor in multiple regressions. for large-sized perch, we found a substantial and signiﬁcant increase in litpro with increasing tp and chla, and a decrease with increasing cov and mean depth (in a multiple regression only chla contributed), while no signiﬁ- cant changes were found for small-sized perch (table 5). for rudd, there was a distinct difference between ﬁsh > and £10 cm (fig. 4). litpro was high for small specimens, but showed a weak but non- signiﬁcant shift to lower values at higher tp. in low- tp lakes the largest individuals were apparently the most pelagic, but with increased tp their abundance in the littoral zone increased distinctively and signiﬁ- cantly (fig. 3; table 5). multiple regressions found only tp to be signiﬁcant (table 5). litpro was overall higher for small than large roach, especially so in the lowest tp categories. litpro of small roach decreased signiﬁcantly with increasing pvi of sub- merged plants, but was independent of tp and chla (fig. 3, table 5). litpro of large-sized roach was related to tp(+), chla(+), cov()) and pvi()), but in a multiple regression only chla(+) made a signiﬁcant contribution (table 5). litpro increased along the tp or chla gradient for some of the other species as well, often most signiﬁcantly for chla (table 5). these include tench and gudgeon >10 cm and smelt, while litpro for large bream was related to mean depth (+). selected ﬁsh species smaller and larger than 10 cm in deep and shallow lakes for three abundant species (perch, rudd and roach), we

was calculated. only data for the most numerous species are presented (fig. 4). for all species, litpro tended to decline over time. however, signiﬁcant (pairwise t-test) changes were only observed for both size classes of roach and perch and for large-sized rudd (table 7). discussion a comparison between catches by nets and electro- ﬁshing is ambiguous since the catch efﬁciency of the two methods differs, and because electroﬁshing can only provide a snapshot picture of the daytime distribution in the near-shore part of littoral zone. in contrast, nets are left overnight and may therefore not only catch ﬁsh living in the pelagic but also ﬁsh migrating from the near-shore part of the littoral to the pelagic at night. such migrating specimens may therefore have appeared in the daytime electroﬁshing catches as well. moreover, gill net catches are inﬂu- enced by ﬁsh activity (bohl 1980; hamley 1980) that potentially may change along the tp gradient (jacob- sen et al. 2002) and efﬁciency also varies with the duration of the ﬁshing (olin et al. 2004). therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution. yet, litpro ranged between almost zero for typical pelagic species like pikeperch to nearly 70–100% for mainly littorally foraging species, such as pike. we therefore argue that despite the obvious problems involved in comparing catches by the two methods, a very low litpro indicates that a species is mainly pelagic, the opposite being true if litpro is very high. however, if the values are in between these two extremes the picture becomes less clear because nightly migration between the two habitats may have great inﬂuence. it is also important to note that the littoral catches represent only the near-shore areas, while submerged plant zones (if any) outside these are treated as belonging to pelagic. with these reservations in mind the results revealed signiﬁcant differences between the habitat distribu- tions of the different ﬁsh species. some mainly occurred in the near-shore part of the littoral zone (e.g. gudgeon), while others were mostly pelagic (e.g. pikeperch, smelt and largely also ruffe). these results are overall in accordance with those of other studies (gliwicz & jachner 1992; brabrand & faafeng 1993; perrow et al. 1996; lappalainen & kjellman 1998; vinni et al. 2004). however, for some species, such as pike, the perception of habitat distribution differs. in accordance with our results, several other studies (chapman & mackay 1984a; eklo¨v 1997; skov & berg 1999; jepsen et al. 2001) have reported pike to be mainly associated with the vegetated parts of the lake and the near-shore part of the littoral zone. others have found that especially large pike frequently appear in the open water zone (chapman & mackay 1984b), not least in turbid lakes (grimm 1981; vøllestad et al. 1986). we found litpro for pike to increase with chla (fig. 2), which most likely reﬂects the disap- pearance of submerged plants from the lakes (fig. 1), and this is apparently of greater importance than the beneﬁt that pike may have in the pelagic of a higher turbidity in high-tp lakes. it must be emphasised that we may have overrated litpro values as pike are not well caught in gill nets (haertel et al. 2002), although this will probably not affect the pattern seen along the tp gradient. marked differences occurred in the distribution of other species along the tp gradient and with ﬁsh size. for perch, which are among the most common and abundant ﬁsh in danish lakes, the data showed a 185 all lakes shallow lakes

respectively, all, shallow and deep lakes. marked increase in litpro of specimens >10 cm with tp (or rather chla, table 5) in shallow lakes, from a median of nearly 10% in the lowest p category to 75% in the highest. several explanations of this shift can be offered. first, the extensive coverage and high pvi of submerged macrophytes outside the near- shore part of the littoral zone in shallow clear-water lakes (fig. 1) likely render this habitat more attractive to perch (macrophyte beds with open water patches) than the reed-dominated habitats near the shore. typically between 0.05 and with increasing tp, )1 (fig. 1), the submerged plants disappear 0.2 mg p l and the pelagic zone becomes less attractive as a foraging habitat and refuge against predators. second, the competition with benthivorous cyprinids such as bream and roach intensiﬁes when lakes turn eutrophic (persson et al. 1988), making the near-shore part of the littoral zone even more attractive. perch in the open water habitat are inferior competitors to cyprinids as shown, for example, by laboratory studies (persson 1983) as well as in ﬁeld experiments where large-sized perch shifted to the pelagic when released from competition by roach (persson 1986). third, in turbid lakes pikeperch were abundant in the pelagic in some of the lakes and their presence may increase the predation risk for medium-sized perch (included in the large-sized group) (do¨rner et al. 1999) and thus further encourage perch to stay in the near-shore part of the littoral zone (brabrand & faafeng 1993). in contrast, in deep lakes, large perch were often pelagic irrespective of the tp level (fig. 3). in deep lakes, however, perch may have occurred in the near-shore area as well, but escaped near-shore electroﬁshing because they tend to reside in the deeper littoral near plant beds (fischer & eckmann 1997; brosse & lek 2002). 186 habitat distribution of ﬁsh in late summer in danish lakes the difference in litpro between large perch and roach became stronger with increasing tp, likely reﬂecting the increased density of cyprinids (jeppesen et al. 2000) and thus enhanced competition among the two species as discussed above. in contrast, there were no marked differences between the pelagic and littoral habitat in deep lakes where the pelagic share was overall high for both species. pronounced differences among lake types occurred for small-sized roach. in deep lakes, small-sized roach were primarily caught in the littoral at the opposite being true in shallow lakes. most likely this reﬂects a signiﬁcantly higher risk of predation from, for instance, perch in the open water of low-tp deep lakes due to the lower coverage and pvi of submerged macrophytes than in shallow lakes (fig. 1), rendering a littoral existence more attractive for small roach. low tp, 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 50 40 30 20 10 0 l a r o t t i l n i t n e c r e p l a r o t t i l n i t n e c r e p ) % ( s e t y h p o r c a m

response to changes in tp, but litpro decreased with increasing mean depth (table 5). we would have expected a higher litpro in the eutrophic lakes as it has been shown that juvenile perch shift to feeding on benthic prey in the near-shore part of the littoral zone when roach (or bream) depress pelagic prey (persson 1986). juvenile perch are, however, known to undergo exten- sive diel migration, being more numerous in the near- shore part of the littoral zone during day and diurnal migration being most pronounced in clear lakes (post & mcqueen 1988; gliwicz & jachner 1992; lewin et al. 2004; pekcan-hekim et al. 2005). litpro may there- fore not accurately depict the actual daytime distribu- tion of small perch, because migrating ﬁsh occurring in the near-shore part of the littoral during day may have been caught in the gill nets at night. roach, the most abundant species in danish lakes, apparently change habitat distribution with age to a larger extent than perch. small roach were more commonly caught in the near-shore part of the littoral zone than in the pelagic in both deep and shallow lakes than were large-sized individuals (fig. 3). moreover, large-sized roach appeared to be more pelagic than large-sized perch in shallow lakes in all tp categories. l c h o r o p h y l l ( a m g l – 1 ) like roach, prefer bream are considered to be mainly pelagic, feeding on benthic invertebrates or zooplankton, and an inferior competitor in complex habitats (diehl 1988; persson & bro¨nmark 2002). similarly, our data show bream to prefer the open habitat in the lakes and litpro was highly positively related to mean depth but not to tp or chla. aggregation of bream in the near-shore part of the littoral zone in deep lakes has been observed elsewhere (fischer & eckmann 1997). rudd exhibited a marked habitat shift with rising tp, following the same pattern in deep and shallow lakes. especially large rudd became more littoral with increasing tp and chla. in the absence of predators, rudd, foraging in the pelagic (winﬁeld 1986; eklo¨v & hamrin 1989). therefore, the higher litpro at increasing tp probably reﬂects enhanced competition with other cyprinids, as these are inferior competitors to roach (winﬁeld 1986). while the low litpro in low-tp shallow lakes may reﬂect the higher abundance of submerged macro- phytes extending from the near-shore part of the littoral zone, it is striking that low litrpo is also found in low-tp deep lakes. in low-tp lakes, rudd is facing predators (e.g. pike) both in the littoral and the pelagic (e.g. perch). laboratory studies have shown that the capture success of pike on rudd is higher than on perch and roach (bean & winﬁeld 1995) and supporting these ﬁndings ﬁeld studies have shown rudd to select the area immediately outside the plant zone where pike can be abundant (eklo¨v & hamrin 1989). in our study rudd may have escaped the near- shore electroﬁshing but not the littoral nets resulting in low litpro values. reduced nutrient loading and improved water quality leading to changes in the ﬁsh community structure had distinct effects on the habitat distribution of some species and size classes; thus, litpro decreased notably for perch, roach and large-sized rudd (table 5). this indicates a shift towards the 187 jeppesen et al. shallow lakes deep lakes log (tp) ns ns +0.0002 ns +0.0001 +0.0005 log (chla)

included in this study. jeppesen et al. (2002, 2005a) found a rapid response by the ﬁsh community to nutrient loading reduction in many danish lakes, including a reduction in total gill nets catches and an enhanced percentage of potential piscivores, most notably perch, within 5–10 years after the reduction. similar observations have been recorded in a study of 35 european and north american lakes in recovery (jeppesen et al. 2005b). this is surprising given the high longevity of the dominant species. our data show that the ﬁsh also perform fast habitat distribution shifts according to the changes in environmental conditions overall following the reverse trajectory known from their response to eutrophication. in conclusion, we have traced major changes in habitat distribution of certain ﬁsh species (e.g. large- sized perch) along a trophic state gradient and between deep and shallow lakes (e.g. roach, perch). other species were mainly caught either in the near- shore part of the littoral in the pelagic (pikeperch, smelt) or in both zones (e.g. small roach and perch). among the four abundant species (roach, bream, perch and rudd) we recorded signiﬁ- cantly reduced preference for the near-shore part of the littoral by perch, roach and large rudd with decreasing nutrient loading. these changes are well in line with expectations derived from the general (gudgeon, pike), 188 trophic gradient pattern described and are indicative of fast adaptation to nutrient loading reduction and to new threats (risk of predation) and opportunities (food availability). the major changes in habitat distribution for quantitatively important species along the trophic state gradient further emphasise the need for conducting both electroﬁshing in the near-shore part of the littoral zone and net ﬁshing in open water when monitoring lakes responding to changes in nutrient loading. to compare electroﬁshing and gill-net data, it would, however, be preferable to match the sampling time period better than in our study. acknowledgements we thank the danish counties for access to primary monitoring data used in some of the analyses and are grateful to kathe møgelvang and anne mette poulsen for skilful technical
