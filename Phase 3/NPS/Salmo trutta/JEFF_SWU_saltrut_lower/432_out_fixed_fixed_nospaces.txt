(halvorsen & jørgensen 1996). in these lakes, salmon and trout are found to utilize the littoral and sublittoral zones, while charr util- ize the sublittoral, profundal and pelagic zones (halvorsen, jørgensen & amundsen 1997). salmon and trout are described as generalistic feeders in rivers (elliott 1970; jenkins 1971; gib- son 1988). although few detailed studies exist on the feeding habits of naturally recruited salmon in lakes, a recent study from a finnish watercourse indicated that specialization to certain prey groups was more characteristic for lacustrine than for ﬂuvial parr (erkinaro, shustov & niemelä 1998). winged insects, trichopteran larvae, and dipteran larvae and pupae were the most important prey categories for the salmon parr (erkinaro et al. 202 1998). a few studies have also been carried out on the feeding habits of salmon parr stocked into lak- es (pedley & jones 1978; morrison 1983). in the relatively acidic llyn dwythwch in wales, indigen- ous brown_trout and stocked atlantic salmon parr had a similar diet during the summer season. how- ever, certain prey groups such as chironomid pu- pae were more important for salmon, while trich- opteran larvae were more important for trout (pedley & jones 1978). arctic charr living in allo- patry in lakes have a habitat and diet choice simi- lar to brown_trout, whereas in sympatry with trout, an interactive segregation to the pelagic and pro- fundal habitats is known to occur (nilsson 1967; langeland et al. 1991). no studies have, however, been carried out comparing the resource use of at- lantic salmon parr, brown_trout and arctic charr living in the same lake. in the present study, we compare the habitat dis- tribution and feeding ecology of naturally re- cruited juvenile salmon, brown_trout and arctic charr living in sympatry in a north norwegian lake. it was hypothesized that juvenile salmon and trout would be similar both in habitat distribution and diet utilization, while charr would be segre- gated from the other two species in both niche characteristics. in addition to juvenile salmonids, adult trout and charr were also included in the study as the habitat use and diet of adults may inﬂuence the resource use of juvenile ﬁsh. material and methods study area the study was carried out in lake tennvatn (69(cid:190)12¿n, 17(cid:190)34¿e), an oligotrophic lake with hu- mic inﬂuence situated on the island of senja, troms county, northern norway (fig. 1). the drainage area (35 km2) is dominated by birch wood. the lake has a surface area of 0.13 km2, and mean and maximum depths of 6.2 m and 20 m, respectively. the ice-free period lasts from the middle of may to the middle of october. in the lake just outside the inlet- and outlet streams there is dense macrovegetation from the shore to about 2 m depth. on the west side of the lake the shore drops steeply, and is covered with rocks and stones to about 2–3 m depth. in deeper parts of the lake the bottom is soft. the lake stratiﬁes in summer at a depth of about 5–10 m, and has a cold profundal zone with only 6(cid:190)c in the summer season, whereas the epilimnic temperatures may be more than 15(cid:190)c (kristoffersen; halvorsen & jørgensen 1994). atlantic salmon and brown_trout spawn in the outlet and in two inlet streams of the lake (hal- vorsen & jørgensen 1996). the trout is predomi- nantly anadromous, whereas the arctic charr resource partitioning in salmonids population have been shown to be almost exclus- ively resident (kristoffersen et al. 1994), and spawn in the lake. in addition to the three salmonid species, three-spined stickleback (gas- terosteus aculeatus (l.)), eel (anguilla anguilla (l.)) and ﬂounder (platichtys ﬂesus (l.)) were also pres- ent in the lake. fish sampling samples of ﬁsh were taken monthly from june to september in 1990, and in may 1991. fish were caught at night (2000–0800 h) with monoﬁlament gillnets (1.5(cid:192)25 m), with individual mesh sizes of 8, 10, 12.5 and 15 mm (knot to knot). in shallow areas, individual gillnets were set perpendicular to the shore, reaching down to a depth of about 3 m. in the steep area, four nets of each mesh size were set in gangs, from the shore to the deepest part of the lake. in the pelagic zone, small mesh sized ﬂoating gillnets (6, 8, 10, 12.5 and 15 mm) were set over the deepest part of the lake in may and aug- ust, covering depths from 0–4 m. in may, june and august, larger trout and charr were caught with multi mesh gillnets (mesh sizes 10–45 mm) in con- nection with other investigations, whereas the adult trout and charr material from july and sep- tember are from the sampling with small mesh- sized gillnets (8–15 mm). the benthic area was divided into littoral and profundal parts on the basis of the average secchi fig. 1. contour map of lake tennvatn with depth interval 5 m and maximum depth 20 m 203 jørgensen et al. table 1. mean length in mm, standard

registered as littoral ﬁsh, while individuals caught deeper than 7 m were recorded as profundal ﬁsh. this depth registration of the ﬁsh was carried out in may, june and august. the total length of each ﬁsh was measured (mm), and sex and maturation stage were determined. the stomachs were removed, individually marked and kept in ethanol until analyzed. the individuals of all three species were opera- tionally divided into three length groups; small juveniles or parr (ﬁ120 mm), large juveniles or parr (121–160 mm) and adults (.160 mm) (table 1). the limit 160 mm was chosen because the largest salmon parr caught in the lake were about this size. the proportion of mature salmon parr ﬁ160 mm in august and september was 9% and 11%, respectively. for trout and charr, the pro- portion of mature ﬁsh ﬁ160 mm was insigniﬁcant (ﬁ2% for trout and 0% for charr). stomach content analysis a total of 1406 stomachs were examined, of which 364 were from salmon parr, 373 from trout parr, 198 from adult trout, 281 from juvenile charr and 190 from adult charr. the few (n‰6) stomachs from salmon parr .160 mm were excluded from the rest of the study. food items were identiﬁed to the lowest possible taxa. the volume of each taxa in a stomach was measured by the area of a mm graph paper covered 204 between two glass slides 1 or 2 mm apart, or by water displacement for large items (pedley & jones 1978). the importance of each prey category in the diet was expressed as prey abundance deﬁned as the percentage that a prey category comprising the total volume of all prey in the sample (hynes 1950, hyslop 1980). the total length of sticklebacks and benthic animals (insect larvae, molluscs and corix- idae) was measured under a binocular microscope. to express the diet overlap between size-groups or species, schoener’s percent overlap index (s) was used (schoener 1968): s ‰ 100s1»0.5 on | px, i»py, i |d i‰1 where px, i is the frequency of the ith food category for species x, and py, i is the frequency of the ith category for species y. when there is no overlap, s‰0, and when the overlap is total, s‰100%. the overlap is considered biologically signiﬁcant when s.60% (wallace 1981). the niche width (w) of each size-group or spe- cies were calculated according to the index of lev- in (1968): w ‰ 1/o pi 2, i ‰ 1 ... n where pi is the frequency of prey category i, and n‰total number of prey categories in the diet. w varies from 1 (minimum) to n (maximum). results habitat distribution of ﬁsh juvenile salmon and trout (ﬁ160 mm) and all most adult trout were caught in the

profundal and littoral zones (fig. 2). the pelagic zone was only ﬁshed in two months; may and august, and only in august a few adult charr were caught. these few individuals are not included in the rest of the study. diet of salmon and trout parr twenty-eight prey taxa were found in the stomachs of juvenile salmon and trout. five different genera of trichopteran larvae were identiﬁed: oxyethira sp., hydropsyche sp., phryganea bipunctata, and one small and one larger larvae of limnophilus sp. one species of megaloptera (sialis lutaria) and two genera of coleoptera (dytiscus sp. and haliplus sp.) were also found in the stomachs. ephemerop- teran larvae and chironomid larvae and pupae were not identiﬁed to genus or species. daphnia longispina and bosmina longispina were the domin- ating zooplankton species. the highest niche width of juvenile salmon and trout was found in may and june, while the lowest niche width was found in september for both spe- cies (table 2). with the exception of small salmon in june, large trout parr had a wider niche than the other size-groups of both juvenile salmon and trout from may to august. in contrast to the broad niche widths at the population level of both salmon and trout parr, the individuals of both spe- cies had in each monthly sample specialized on just a single or a few prey categories, and the average number of different prey categories in the stom- achs ranged from 1.2 to 2.7 (table 2). resource partitioning in salmonids in may, small trout parr (ﬁ120 mm) primarily ate corixidae, trichoptera and ephemeroptera lar- vae, followed by surface insects and chironomid pupae (fig. 3). the number of small salmon parr from may (n‰6) was too small to be analyzed. in june, small salmon and trout parr had quite differ- ent diets. small salmon predominantly consumed small insect larvae (trichoptera, ephemeroptera, simuliidae and plecoptera) and chironomid pupae, while small trout mainly ate large megalopteran and trichopteran (limnophilus sp.) larvae and mol- luscs, primarily planorbis sp. and lymnea peregra. in july and august, the diet of small salmon and trout were similar, consisting of trichopteran lar- vae, chironomid pupae, ephemeropteran nymhs and corixidae. the diets of the two species were fig. 3. the diet of small (ﬁ120 mm) and large (121 – 160 mm) atlantic salmon and brown_trout parr from may

megalopteran larvae, coleopteran larvae (dytiscus sp., haliplus sp.) and sticklebacks (fig. 4). the similarity in the diet of adult and juven- ile trout was largest in june when insect larvae were most important for both size-groups, and in september when corixidae dominated the prey for both adult and juvenile trout, as well as for salmon (table 3). diet of charr only 11 prey taxa were found in the stomachs of charr, which indicates that they had the narrowest food niche of the three salmonid species (table 2). the diets of small (ﬁ120 mm) and large (121–160 mm) juvenile charr were almost identical (table 3), and the results from both size-groups are therefore presented together (fig. 4). juvenile charr (ﬁ160 mm) had primarily eaten chironomid larvae and pupae in may and june, while zooplankton was most important from july to september. in addition, some molluscs (lymnea peregra) were taken in september. juvenile charr had a narrow diet niche, and the individuals were usually specialized on only one prey category each month. adult charr (.160 mm) predominantly utilized the same food categories as juvenile charr, but there were some differences in the seasonal pat- terns (fig. 4). adult charr primarily ate chironom- id pupae from may to july, and zooplankton was not important before august-september. adult charr also took some coleopteran larvae, molluscs and sticklebacks. jørgensen et al. table 3. diet overlap (schoener’s index) between different ﬁsh species and size-groups. the size-groups are: small parr (ﬁ120 mm), large parr (121– 160 mm) and adults

small salmon had also frequently eaten molluscs, primarily lymnea peregra. the diet over- lap between small salmon and trout parr was sig- niﬁcant in all months except june (table 3). in all sampling months, the diet of small and large trout parr was more different than that of small and large salmon parr, and the diet overlap between small and large trout parr was signiﬁcant only in september (fig. 3, table 3). large trout parr con- sumed a larger number of different prey categories, and usually more insect larvae than both small trout and salmon parr. the largest individuals of both species took on average the largest benthic prey (table 4). the large salmon smolts ate a broad spec- trum of insect larvae, dominated by large items of megaloptera, trichoptera and ephemeroptera in may. salmon also frequently took chironomid pu- pae in may. in june and august, large salmon and trout parr were partly segregated in diet, whereas in july and september, the overlap was signiﬁcant (table 3). in the period june-august, trout primar- ily consumed insect larvae, while salmon ate chiron- omid pupae and sticklebacks. in september the two species again had similar diets, with corixidae as the dominant prey. diet of adult trout compared to juvenile trout and salmon, the adult trout (.160 mm) ate larger prey items, fig. 4. diet composition of juvenile (ﬁ160 mm) and adult

of vegetation and stones, has previously been found to be the most important factor determining the distribution of small salmon and trout in lakes (halvorsen et al. 1997). juvenile charr were on the other hand primarily caught in the profundal zone, whereas larger charr also utilized the littoral zone. this vertical distribution of arctic charr in sympatry with other salmonids is in accord- ance with the ﬁndings from a number of norwegian lakes, and is probably due to interference compe- tition (langeland et al. 1991; halvorsen & jørgens- en 1996). juvenile salmon and trout seemed to be general- istic feeders in lake tennvatn, utilizing a large num- ber of prey categories. among these, trichopteran larvae were more important for trout parr than for salmon parr, whereas chironomid pupae were more important for salmon than for trout parr. the same pattern was found between naturally recruited trout and stocked salmon in llyn dwythwch, wales (ped- ley & jones 1978). the diet of juvenile charr was dominated by chironomid larvae and pupae, and zooplankton, which agrees with other studies in norwegian lakes (hindar & jonsson 1982; klemets- en, muladal & amundsen 1992). in addition, adult charr utilized benthos and sticklebacks, and this segregation in diet between different size-groups of arctic charr has also previously been found (jørgensen & klemetsen 1995). small and large salmon parr had a similar diet, and they seemed to a large extent to utilize the same resources, although in may the salmon smolts had a more diverse diet than salmon parr in the other months. the difference in diet between the two size- groups of juvenile trout was larger than that be- tween the small and large salmon parr. this was re- ﬂected in the generally wider diet niche of the large trout parr in all months, compared to the smaller trout and salmon. the restricted diet niche of salmon and small trout parr, may be a consequence of their restricted habitat utilization in the littoral zone (halvorsen et al. 1997). larger trout parr, which are generally found on deeper water and higher in the water column than salmon (halvorsen 1996), probably have access to several different kind of prey which may explain their wider diet niche. corixidae were especially important as prey in autumn for both salmon and trout in lake tennvatn, while sticklebacks were more important for salmon than for the trout parr. the smallest trout parr did not eat sticklebacks, and among trout they were most frequently eaten by adults. in llyn dwythwch in wales, sticklebacks were also more important for large than for small (,150 mm) trout, whereas salmon parr, in strong contrast to lake tennvatn, did not eat sticklebacks at all 207 fig. 5. prey (three-spined sticklebacks) length in relation to predator length of (a) atlantic salmon, (b) brown_trout and (c) arctic charr predation on sticklebacks salmon parr consumed three-spined sticklebacks all months, but most frequently in august, when trout and charr also had their main consumption of this prey. salmon parr started to eat stickle- backs when they were about 90 mm in length, trout when they were about 110 mm and charr when they were about 200 mm (fig. 5). salmon ate sticklebacks that were 10–20 mm long, trout took sticklebacks that were 15–40 mm, and charr took even larger individuals (20–50 mm). the size of the preyed sticklebacks increased with increasing pred- ator size, and were on average 12% of the predator body length for the three salmonids (fig. 5). discussion juvenile salmon and trout were all caught within one secchi depth (0–7 m) in lake tennvatn. this is a more restricted depth distribution than shown in previous studies, where lacustrine salmon and trout parr have been found down to two secchi depths (pepper et al. 1985; o’connell & dempson 1996; halvorsen et al. 1997). as the macrovegetation and the stony bottom rapidly disappear after a few meters depth in lake tennvatn, the depth distri- bution of the ﬁsh indicates that the presence of shel- jørgensen et al. (pedley & jones 1978). in lake tennvatn, salmon parr became piscivores at a length of only 90 mm, which is smaller than found for other salmonids (l’abe´e-lund, langeland & sægrov 1992). the food resource utilization of all three salmonids appeared to be dependent on the sea- sonal variation in the availability of prey. the im- portance of aquatic insect larvae for both salmon and trout in spring and early summer coincides with the high abundance of insect larvae normally found in freshwater at this time of the year (e.g. ulfstrand 1967). several chironomid species occur in the littoral zone of oligotrophic lakes (aagaard 1978a, b), and chironomid pupae are usually taken when they rise to the surface to hatch (morrison 1983; pinder 1986). the highest diversity of hatch- ing chironomids occurs in may, but the hatching of some species continues until august/september (aagaard 1978a, b), which corresponds with the continued consumption of chironomid pupae by salmon and trout throughout the whole study period in lake tennvatn. different species of trichoptera and ephemeroptera emerge at differ- ent times (lepneva 1970; hynes 1972), and this may explain why these prey categories also were consumed the whole season by salmon and trout. in september, corixidae were dominant prey for both species at a time when the corixidae are known to have their peak abundances in lakes (thorp & covich 1991). in addition, corixidae were taken in may, just before their breeding sea- son starts. permanent lake-dwellers, such as sticklebacks and molluscs, are available as prey throughout the season, but are usually eaten by ﬁsh in autumn and winter when other prey are scarce (gibson & cun- jak 1986; amundsen & klemetsen 1988; amunds- en 1989). in lake tennvatn, salmon parr took most sticklebacks in august, probably because the stickleback fry were at the most harvestable size at that time. some sticklebacks were also eaten by the large salmon parr in september and may, but when the smolt had migrated to the sea in the be- ginning of june, the 1-year-old sticklebacks may have been too large to be eaten by the remaining small salmon. the narrow diet width of juvenile charr may be associated with the low number of benthic species in the profundal zones of subarctic lakes, where one single species of orthocladin chironomidae often dominates (brundin 1949; klemetsen et al. 1992). the mass hatching of this species usually ends in july (klemetsen et al. 1992). zooplankton was the dominant prey for charr in lake tennvatn later in the season, when their abundance usually is high (hindar & jonsson 1982). in conclusion, juvenile salmon and trout had a 208 relatively high degree of overlap both in habitat and food utilization. both species were generalistic feeders, but the individuals had usually specialized on a single or just a few (ﬁ3) different prey types. the similarity in diet was highest between small salmon and trout parr, probably due to both groups being conﬁned to the parts of the littoral zone which provide the best shelter from potential predators. as the salmon grew larger, their diet did not change much, with the exception that stickle- backs became more important. as trout grew larger, their diet changed more profoundly. large trout parr had a wider diet niche than smaller parr, and included larger prey items. this tendency was reinforced by the largest trout, probably reﬂecting a wider habitat use in addition to an increased gape-size. the charr was predicted to be segregated from the other two salmonids in both habitat and diet, and this hypothesis was partly veriﬁed. juvenile charr were conﬁned to the profundal zone where they had a narrow diet reﬂecting a poor feeding habitat, but also with lower metabolic needs due to much lower water temperatures than in the littoral zone. adult charr, on the other hand, partly shared the littoral zone with salmon and trout, but were segregated from the other two salmonids in food utilization. the diet of adult charr indicated that most food items were taken in the open littoral zone. resumen 1. en un lago del norte de noruega, estudiamos la particio´n de recursos entre juveniles de salmo_salar, s. trutta y salvelinus_alpinus durante la estacio´n del an˜o libre de hielo. los juveniles de s. salar y s. trutta menores de 160 mm utilizaron la zona litoral, los juveniles de s. alpinus la zona profundal, mientras que los adultos de s. trutta y s. alpinus utilizaron ambas zonas. 2. los juveniles de s. salar y s. trutta tuvieron una dieta similar aunque las larvas de trichoptera fueron mas importantes para s. trutta y las pupas de chironomidae y gasterosteus aculeatus lo fueron para s. salar. los juveniles de s. salar y s. trutta menores de 120 mm tuvieron mayor solapamiento en las dietas que los juveniles de taman˜os 121–160 mm. los habitos alimen- ticios de los adultos de s. trutta fueron similares a la de los juveniles, pero los primeros se alimentaron de presas mayores. a nivel de poblacio´n, tanto s. salar como s. trutta fueron gene- ralistas de amplia dieta pero a nivel individual, ambas especies se especializaron en uno o en unas pocas categorı´as de presas. 3. los juveniles de s. alpinus se segregan de s. salar y s. trutta tanto en habitat como en la utilizacio´n de alimento y tuvieron una dieta menos amplia, consistente en chirono´midos y zoo- plancton que posiblemente reﬂeja su ubicacio´n en habitats pro- fundos de menor diversidad de presas potenciales. los mayores individuos de s. alpinus tambie´n se alimentaron de zoobenthos y de g. aculeatus en la zona litoral. acknowledgments we thank arne c. nilssen for help with the identiﬁcation of aquatic insects, svein jakob saltveit for comments on the manuscript and robert barrett for
