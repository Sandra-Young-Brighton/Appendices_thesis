(1904) the arctic charr, or torgoch (‘red belly’) in welsh, has been a resident of snowdonia in north wales since the end of the last ice age. four native populations have been identiﬁed (fig. 1, table 1a): three are still present today [llyn (¼lake) padarn, llyn cwellyn and llyn bodlyn] and one was extirpated around 30 years ago (llyn peris) during the construction of the dinorwic pump storage scheme (see maitland et al. 2006). in the last 30 years, translocations have resulted in the introduction of arctic charr to a further six lakes in northern snowdonia (fig. 1, table 1b). in north wales some of these translocations were deliberate, e.g., the transfer of charr from llyn peris to llyn dulyn and ffynnon llugwy during the construction of the dinorwic pump storage scheme (table 1b). however, in the last 20 years, charr have been caught in other lakes (llyn cowlyd, llynnau diwaunedd, llyn eigiau and coedty reservoir) (roberts 1995) for which no translocation records are available. the conwy lakes in the dolgarrog catchment (see fig. 1) are regulated waters [water reservoirs (dwˆ r cymru/welsh water) or part of a hydroelectric power scheme (rwe npower)] that are interconnected by a series of leats and tunnels. during the process of hydropower generation, water is moved from lakes high in the dolgarrog catchment (llyn dulyn, llyn melynllyn) in the conwy valley and from ffynnon llugwy in the ogwen valley into llyn cowlyd and llyn eigiau and ﬁnally into coedty reservoir which provides water for hydropower gen- eration directly. it is thought that charr have been moved from llyn dulyn and ffynnon llugwy into llyn eigiau, llyn cowlyd and coedty reservoir during the movement of water between these lakes. recent netting studies conducted in 2004 (november– december) and 2005 (august) have shown that resident spawning populations of arctic charr are doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00166.x 34 padarnnr perisne cwellynnr dulyntr coedtyocc eigiauocc cowlydtr ffynnon llugwytr diwauneddtr bodlynnr fig. 1. the distribution of native (n) and translocated (t) arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) populations in north wales. extinct (e) and resident (r) populations of arctic charr are indicated. arctic charr are occasionally (occ) caught in eigiau and coedty because of the movement of water within the dolgarrog catchment but there are no resident populations. the lakes containing the translocated charr populations are referred to collectively as the conwy lakes in the text. present in ffynnon llugwy, llyn dulyn and llyn cowlyd (i.d. mccarthy & i.k. berrill, unpubl. data). despite angling records (p. jones, dolgarrog fishing club, pers. comm.), no arctic charr were netted from llyn eigiau in august 2005. it is likely that any charr caught in llyn eigiau and coedty reservoir are transient because of the shallow nature of both lakes (<10 m deep) resulting in a competition with brown_trout salmo_trutta, for food, and water temperatures in arctic charr in wales for the summer that are too warm for arctic charr (>15 °c). also, the water level in coedty reservoir can ﬂuctuate quite widely as this lake is the direct supplier of water the hydropower station in dolgarrog and can experience considerable changes in water volume before replenishment with water from the other storage lakes in the catchment. in llynnau diwaunedd, it is thought that the charr were intro- duced into the lake during the peris charr translocation programme but no stocking records are available (r. brassington, environment agency wales, pers. comm.). these records may be for although the presence of arctic charr in other lakes in snowdonia has been suggested in historical records (e.g., llynnau mymbyr, llyn cwm ffynnon & llyn y bi; forrest 1907, 1919) and from anecdotal evidence of anglers (e.g., llyn melynllyn, llyn cwm bychan and llyn eiddew mawr), there is no conclusive evidence of their presence in these lakes. it is possible that some of transient populations of brook charr, salvelinus_fontinalis mitchill, which were introduced into some welsh lakes in the late 19th century, and are thought to be still present in at least one lake (llyn tarw). thus, the current arctic charr populations in wales consist of three native populations and four resident translocated populations (table 1) (see maitland et al. 2006). all native populations are (llyn cwellyn and llyn padarn) or were (llyn peris) landlocked, even though access to the sea is possible as seen by the movement of migratory salmonids (salmo_salar l. and salmo_trutta l.) through these lakes on their spawning migrations. the native charr lakes, with the exception of llyn bodlyn, are low lying (ca. 100–150 m.a.s.l.; table 1a) and of medium depth (max. depth 22–40 m; the lakes containing the table 1a). in contrast, table 1. sites of (a) native and (b) translocated populations of arctic charr salvelinus_alpinus in north wales. lake ngr (a) native populations padarn peris cwellyn bodlyn sh575610 sh592594 sh595502 sh648239 (b) translocated populations ffynnon llugwy eigiau dulyn coedty cowlyd diwaunedd sh692627 sh749619 sh700665 sh754666 sh727624 sh682537 29 34 40 22 108 111 146 385 550 375 538 277 370 371 102 37 89 16 15 46 13 5 116 7 & 5 altitude (m) surface area (ha) maximum depth (m) date of transfer status healthy extinct healthy unknown 45 10 58 unknown 68 unknown 1976–1981  –à 1982–1985  –à –à unknown resident healthy transient resident healthy transient resident healthy resident unknown the data are taken from roberts (1995) unless indicated. for each lake the following data are provided: ordnance survey national grid reference (ngr), the altitude (m above sea level), surface area (ha) and maximum depth (m) of the lake and the current status of the charr population. see text for more details.  rogers (1997). àcharr were not deliberately transferred to these lakes. 35 mccarthy translocated resident charr populations are found at much higher altitudes (ca. 350–550 m.a.s.l.; table 1b) and are deeper (max. depth 45–68 m; table 1b). the resident charr populations in north wales are found in relatively small lakes ranging in surface area from 12 ha (llynnau diwaunedd) to 116 ha (llyn cowlyd, the largest lake in snowdonia) (table 1). like the english and the scottish charr populations, with the notable exceptions of lake windermere in england (e.g., frost 1965, 1977; frost & kipling 1980; elliott & baroudy 1995) and the charr lochs in the tay catchment in scotland (e.g., walker et al. 1988; hartley et al. 1992; adams et al. 1998; fraser et al. 1998; adams et al. 2004; mccarthy et al. 2004), the welsh charr populations have not been studied much. details of the dinorwic pumped storage scheme and the charr translocation programme have been published (rogers 1980; rogers & caine 1985; closs-parry 1997; rogers 1997). also, child (1977) published the genotypic relations between the four native welsh charr populations using polymorphic allozyme loci. some aspects of the biology of charr in llyn padarn, llyn peris, llyn cwellyn and ffynnon llugwy have been reported in postgraduate research theses and unpublished reports that are not easily accessible (powell 1966; sullivan 1975; butterworth 1980; jones 1983; milner 1984; hanks 1998). there- fore, this review is to collate what information is known on the biology and ecology of the arctic charr in wales from unpublished sources and to make this information more widely available. the current status of arctic charr in wales and the possible threats to these populations are discussed in maitland et al. (2006). the aim of feeding ecology the feeding habits of charr in llyn padarn and llyn peris (powell 1966), llyn cwellyn (sullivan 1975; i.d. mccarthy unpubl. data) and llyn bodlyn (i.d. mccarthy unpubl. data) have been studied. in all lakes (native and translocated), charr live in sympatry with brown_trout and in two lakes, llyn cwellyn and llyn padarn, they live in sympatry with atlantic salmon (s. salar). these three salmonid ﬁshes usually exhibit dietary segregation when they coexist. brown_trout and atlantic salmon occupy and feed in the littoral zone of lakes with charr feeding in the pelagic or profundal zones (halvorsen et al. 1997; klemetsen et al. 2003). the available data indicate that welsh charr are planktivores feeding mainly on planktonic crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) but also on chironomid larvae and pupae (powell 1966; sullivan 1975; i.d. mccarthy unpubl. data). sullivan (1975) conducted a detailed study of the dietary habits of arctic charr, brown_trout and atlantic salmon in llyn 36 charr trout salmon e c n e r r u c c o %  100 80 60 40 20 0 c i n o t k n a l p a e c a t s u r c d i m o n o r i h c e a v r a l d i m o n o r i h c e a p u p e a p u p a r e t p i d a r e t p o e l o c e a v r a l y l f y a m s h p m y n s t c e s n i l a i r e a fig. 2. percentage occurrence of major prey categories in the diets of arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus), brown_trout (salmo_trutta) and atlantic salmon parr (salmo_salar) in llyn cwellyn, snowdonia, north wales (data redrawn from sullivan 1975). the major prey group amongst the planktonic crustacea were cladocerans. cwellyn (fig. 2). analysis of the stomach contents data showed that cwellyn charr fed mainly on cladocerans (bythotrephes longimanus leydig) and copepods (leptidora kindti and diaptomus gracilis sars) with clear trophic partitioning between the pelagic planktivorous charr and the benthivorous brown_trout and atlantic salmon feeding in the littoral zone (fig. 2). in the absence of competing species, arctic charr can exhibit trophic polymorphism with two or more forms each of which are adapted to utilise a particular trophic resource (adams et al. 1998; fraser et al. 1998; jonsson & jonsson 2001). how- ever, there are no records of trophic polymorphism occurring within the welsh charr populations studied to date (sullivan 1975; butterworth 1980). growth a comparison of the available mean length at age data for the welsh charr and for other planktivorous charr populations in the uk are shown in table 2. the growth patterns for charr in llyn cwellyn, llyn padarn and ffynnon llugwy are very similar to each other (fig. 3) and to other planktivorous charr popu- lations in the uk (table 2) with the exception of the faster growing charr in loch arkaig and in lake windermere (table 2). however, growth rates were lower in the peris charr compared with the other welsh charr populations (fig. 3). despite their interconnec- tion and close proximity, llyn padarn and llyn peris differed in their primary productivity prior to the pump storage scheme development with padarn exhibiting a 3.4-fold higher rate of primary productivity compared with peris (pentecost & happey-wood 1978) which is clearly reﬂected in the growth rates (fig. 3) and size arctic charr in wales table 2. average size (cm) at age (years) for planktivorous arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) from wales (wal), scotland (sco) and england (eng). lake wal – padarn  wal – peris  wal – cwellynà wal – ffynnon llugwy§ sco – ericht (coloured form)– sco – rannoch (coloured form)   sco – tay (fast growing form)àà sco – awe§§ sco – arkaig–– sco – garry§§ eng – windermere (autumn spawner)    eng – windermere (spring spawner)    average size (cm) at age (years) 1 7.0 7.1 9.0 5.3 12.3 6.3 5.3 2 12.4 11.2 15.4 15.5 11.5 12.5 11.6 14.4 11.7 15.8 11.6 10.2 3 16.2 14.3 18.1 17.8 16.5 17.0 21.5 16.2 18.3 18.5 18.2 17.4 4 19.6 16.3 19.8 19.8 17.5 19.0 23.7 17.8 24.1 20.3 24.0 25.3 5 21.5 18.0 21.0 20.9 18.5 19.5 25.2 19.1 26.2 19.9 27.0 29.5 6 22.9 19.5 21.3 21.4 18 21.0 25.7 18.0 27.4 28.0 31.7 7 24.2 20.7 22.8 21.0 21.5 22.5 28.2 33.0 8 25.2 21.2 20.0 22.5 33.1 9 10 21.5 20.0  butterworth (1980). àsullivan (1975) and i.d. mccarthy (unpubl. data). §jones (1983). –fraser et al.

(table 3) of the charr in these two lakes. the increased primary productivity, and hence the larger size of adult charr from llyn padarn compared with llyn peris, was attributed to increased nutrient input into padarn from the llanberis sewage works (butterworth 1980). the majority of llyn padarn adult spawners captured by butterworth (1980) in the mid-1970s in fyke nets in the afon-y-bala were between 19 and 24 cm fork length (fig. 4). this correlates well with historical records of the size of adult charr in llyn padarn in the second half of the 19th century summarised by closs- parry (1997) as 4–8 oz (114–227 g) and 6–10 in. (15– 25 cm). in the 1980s, as eutrophication of llyn padarn continued, the size of adult charr became noticeably larger (closs-parry 1997; rogers 1997). however, in the late 1980s, a phosphate stripper was installed at the llanberis sewage works to reduce nutrient input into the lake. the long-term effect of eutrophication in llyn padarn is seen very clearly in the size of adult spawning charr from padarn caught in fyke nets in the afon-y-bala in 1997 (hanks 1998; fig. 4) where the majority of charr were between 28 and 34 cm. in 20 years, the average size of adult spawning charr in llyn padarn increased from 22 to 32 cm fork length (fig. 4). however, the phosphate stripper has reduced nutrient input into llyn padarn, summer algal blooms have diminished and regular biennial fyke net surveys in the afon-y-bala conducted by the environment agency wales show that the size of the adult padarn charr is declining towards the historical size range with an average adult size of 28 cm in 2003 (r. brassing- ton, environment agency wales, pers. comm.). reproduction there is limited information regarding the reproduc- tive biology of the welsh charr. the available data suggests that welsh charr attain sexual maturation at 3 years (table 3). the ages at which 50% of the adult ﬁsh were mature (a50) were reported to be 3.8 years for males and 4.4 years for females from llyn padarn and 3.0 years for males and 4.0 years for females from llyn peris, respectively. the main spawning area for the llanberis charr populations used to be the gravel bay between the afon-y-bala and the afon hwch at the northwest end of llyn peris (butterworth 1980). 37 mccarthy lake padarn  peris  cwellynà bodlyn§ ffynnon– llugwy   cowlyd   dulyn   n, number of ﬁsh collected 773 867 189 11 147 41 58 32 fork length (cm) 12–27 10–22 10–25 12–19 14–25 9–16 16–22 7–19 body mass (g) age (year) age at maturity (year) 20–230 12–112 9–140 12–80 ? 8–35 32–93 4–58 2–8 2–8 2–7 n/a 2–6 n/a n/a n/a 3 3 3 n/a 3 n/a n/a n/a fecundity, no. of eggs (size range) 320–780 (20–27 cm) 190–416 (17–20 cm) 121–442 (17–22 cm) n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a, data not available at the time of publication.  butterworth (1980). àsullivan (1975) and i.d. mccarthy (unpubl. data). §i.d. mccarthy (unpubl. data). –jones (1983).   i.d. mccarthy & i.k. berrill (unpubl. data). table 3. summary of the available data for the size range, age range and fecundity of arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) sampled from llyn padarn, llyn peris, llyn cwellyn, llyn bodlyn, ffynnon llugwy, llyn cowlyd and llyn dulyn in north wales. mid 1970s;

partington & mills 1988). child (1977) examined the genetic variation between padarn, peris, cwellyn and bodlyn charr using four polymorphic allozymes (transferrin (tf), esterase (es), glucose phosphate isomerase (gpi) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh)). this research was conducted prior the pumped storage scheme to examine how related the four native populations were and particularly to examine whether the charr in padarn and peris were genetically distinct. the results indicated no differences in gpi and ldh between the four populations, but bodlyn, cwellyn and padarn/peris were signiﬁcantly different from each other at the tf and es loci (child 1977). no genetic differences were reported between the padarn and peris charr and as a result construction of the pumped storage scheme was allowed to continue. partington & mills (1988) compared the genetic variation of cwellyn charr at two polymorphic enzyme loci (es and malate dehydrogenase (mdh)) with the eight cumbrian charr populations (butter- mere, coniston water, crummock water, ennerdale, haweswater, thirlemere, wastwater and windermere) and one from southwest scotland (loch doon). cwellyn charr were found to be genetically distinct from the eight english and one scottish charr populations examined. to date the genetics of the translocated charr populations have not been studied. also, no modern dna-based markers have been used to examine the genetic variability in the native and translocated welsh charr populations. acknowledgements i would like to thank tristan hatton-ellis and catherine duigan (countryside council for wales) and richard brassington (environment agency wales) for their useful discussions and for access to unpublished reports;
