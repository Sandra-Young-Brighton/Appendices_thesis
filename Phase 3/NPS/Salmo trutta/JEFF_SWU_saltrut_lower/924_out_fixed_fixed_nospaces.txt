extent that the perch are not forced to compete with their older conspeciﬁcs during their ﬁrst year of life, enabling perch to become large and consequently piscivorous. key words: perch; roach;

(rutilus rutilus l.) are widely distributed over europe and are the most abundant ﬁsh species in many european lakes. the roach is an omnivorous cyprinid with the ability to utilise many food resources such as zooplankton, zoobenthos, detritus, epiphytes, phytoplankton and macrophytes (niederholzer & hofer 1980; eie & borgstrøm 1981; persson 1983a; brabrand 1985; horppila 1994; kahl et al. 2001). the high capture rate of small zooplankton and the ability to use primary producers as food resources (persson 1983a; johansson & persson 1986; persson & greenberg 1990) seems to be the reason for the dominance of roach under eutrophic conditions (persson 1983a). the perch is an exclusively carnivorous ﬁsh species with an ontogenetic niche shift from feeding on zooplank- ton to feeding on macroinvertebrates and further to piscivorous feeding (allen 1935). the dominance of perch over roach under less eutrophic conditions is feeding suggested to be caused by the superior feeding abilities of perch within the littoral vegetation (winﬁeld 1986; diehl 1988; persson & eklo¨v 1995) and the higher efﬁciency when on macroinvertebrates (persson 1987). the interactions between perch and roach were studied in numerous investigations with relatively consistent results (persson 1983b; winﬁeld 1986; persson 1987; diehl 1988; bergman 1990; persson & greenberg 1990; persson & eklo¨v 1995). the different feeding strategies together with the competitive interactions of perch and roach were used to explain the shift from a dominance of percids to a dominance of cyprinids with increasing productivity of the lakes (burrough et al. 1979; persson 1983b; persson et al. 1991). ecological studies with different ﬁsh species have shown that a species leaves its preferred habitat at the appearance of species (werner & hall 1979). in their new habitat they ﬁnd less optimal conditions, which usually lead to a reduction in growth and reproduction. from these competitively stronger a

greenberg (1990). according to the juvenile compet- itive bottleneck hypothesis, roach by its higher foraging efﬁciency in feeding on zooplankton forces juvenile perch to an earlier ontogenetic niche shift from feeding on zooplankton to feeding on macroin- vertebrates during their ﬁrst summer. this leads to a higher intraspeciﬁc competition with older age classes of perch and consequently results in slow growth, delayed or prohibited shift to the piscivorous stage and stunted populations. not only the food resources but also size and morphometry of a lake may affect the interactions between ﬁsh species. the relative importance of littoral resources is higher in small and shallow lakes than in large and deep ones (gasith 1991). the interactions of perch and roach were mostly studied in small and shallow lakes, experimental ponds, enclosures or aquaria where the two ﬁsh species and the size classes studied had no option to segregate in a spatial dimension (persson 1983b; winﬁeld 1986; persson 1987; diehl 1988; bergman 1990; persson & greenberg 1990; persson & eklo¨v 1995). though the relationship between perch and roach biomass does not seem to be dependent on lake size (olin et al. 2002), results from an investigation at eutrophic lake vesija¨rvi indicate that perch and roach are able to coexist at relatively high densities by using different habitats and diverse food resources in lakes with a large surface area (horppila et al. 2000). the aim of this study was to test assumptions about the interaction of perch and roach concerning their feeding behaviour and growth in a deep and mesotrophic reservoir with roach dominating the ﬁsh community. materials and methods the study was performed in the saidenbach reservoir, a mesotrophic drinking water reservoir situated in saxony (germany). the total surface area is 146 ha, the mean depth is 15.3 m and the maximum depth is 48 m. the reservoir is characterised by steep shores and thus by a relatively small littoral zone. the phytoplankton community is dominated by diatoms (horn & horn 2000) and the zooplankton community by copepods (horn 2000). the cladoceran population develops late in the year and never reaches dominance. the ﬁsh community is dominated by roach and perch. both species are characterised by relatively fast growth (kahl & radke, the dominating roach and perch, the ﬁsh fauna further consists of bream (abramis brama (l.)), pike (esox lucius l.), eel (anguilla anguilla (l.)) and a few other less abundant species like ruffe (gymnocephalus in press). besides niche separation of perch and roach cernuus (l.)), chub (leuciscus cephalus (l.)), gud- geon (gobio gobio (l.)) and rudd (scardinius erythrophthalmus (l.)). within a biomanipulation experiment, brown_trout (salmo_trutta forma lacustris l.) was stocked from 2000 onwards (radke et al. 2003). in addition to pike and adult perch, brown_trout thus was the only predatory ﬁsh species using perch and roach in approximately equal proportions (radke et al. 2003). no other system changes were performed within this experiment. fish were sampled by gillnetting (mesh sizes 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 60, 70 mm) once a month from april to november 1998–2001. the nets were set overnight at the surface, on the bottom in the pelagic zone and on the bottom in the littoral zone. addition- ally, in 1999 and 2000, the same gillnets were set in the metalimnion. to collect data of the vertical distribution of perch and roach in the pelagic zone of the saidenbach reservoir, vertical gillnets (hansson 1988) of mesh sizes 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 33, 38 mm were set overnight twice a month from july to november 2000 and from april to november 2001. with these nets the whole water column from the surface to a depth of 30 m was covered. nominal catches were standardised to catch per unit effort (cpue) and corrected for encounter probability according to spangler & collins (1992). the swim- ming speed of both species was assumed to be similar. after capture each ﬁsh was weighed to the nearest gram and total length was measured to the nearest millimetre. the analysis of the vertical distribution of perch and roach was separated in two periods. the period of stable stratiﬁcation is characterised by a surface temperature of more than 17 °c. surface temperatures of 17 °c or below were treated as the period of mixis or not fully developed stratiﬁcation in the saidenbach reservoir. for diet analysis random subsamples of food items were estimated. for the different size classes of perch and roach were taken from all gillnet catches every month. the stomach of perch and the anterior part of the gut (pharynx – ﬁrst bend) of roach were removed and deep frozen. the stomach and gut contents were analysed in the laboratory and the volume proportions of the different further analysis four length groups, <100, 100–149, 150– 199 and >199 mm, were treated separately for both perch and roach. because of a high variability in the recruitment of perch and roach within the study period not every length group of perch and roach were caught in every year. therefore, the data of all years were pooled. thus, a comparison of the diet between the different years could not be performed. spearman rank correlations were performed to test proportional use of important food resources against size of perch and roach. 49 kahl & radke in the absence of quantitative data concerning the resource availability, schoener’s similarity index (schoener 1970) is the most useful diet overlap index (wallace 1981): ! x s ¼ 1   0:5 n   pxi   pyi i¼1 where pxi is the proportion of food category i in the diet of species x, pyi is the proportion of food category i in the diet of species y and n is the number of food categories. thus, this index was used to calculate intra- and interspeciﬁc diet overlap between the different size classes of roach and perch. the diet of perch and roach was separated into 16 food categories. the datasets of the years 1998–2001 were pooled for the analysis. results abundance and distribution roach (all length groups) were always more abundant (>90% of the pooled numerical catch of perch and roach, table 1) than perch in the nets placed at the surface of the pelagic zone. during summer roach were only captured in small numbers in the metalim- nion of the pelagic zone. ninety percent of the perch captured in the metalimnion were juvenile and smaller than 100 mm in total length. in the net catches from the littoral zone, where generally most ﬁsh were captured, the proportions of roach were higher than those of perch during the nonstratiﬁed period. during the stratiﬁed period perch were more numerous than roach in the littoral zone. in the pelagic zone perch were dominant (>65% of the pooled numerical catch of perch and roach) in the bottom set nets during both periods. generally, there were no great differences between the stratiﬁed and nonstratiﬁed periods in the proportion of perch and roach in the different habitats. the distribution in the vertical direction differs between perch and roach (fig. 1). in both stratiﬁed table 1.

resources (niederholzer & hofer 1980; persson 1983a; brabrand 1985; horppila 1994; michel & oberdorff 1995; kahl et al. 2001) may proﬁt there. for distinctly zooplanktivorous ﬁsh species (e.g., coregonids) or zooplanktivorous life stages of ﬁsh species with an ontogenetic niche shift (e.g., perch) food conditions in the littoral zone might be limiting because of lower densities of crustacean plankton in the littoral zone of large lakes compared with the pelagic zone (boikova 1986; gliwicz & rykowska 1992; hu¨lsmann et al. 1999). therefore, these ﬁsh species or life stages often are pelagic. the appearance of roach and juvenile perch in the pelagic zone is common (bohl 1980; wang & eckmann 1994; beier 2001). furthermore, the pelagic zone is of importance in large and deep lakes

the highest values within the roach in july (0.90) between the smallest and the larger intermediate length groups. discussion the distribution of perch and roach in the saidenbach reservoir is characterised by clear spatial patterns and minor differences in habitat use between the stratiﬁed and nonstratiﬁed periods. though the proportion of the littoral zone in the saidenbach reservoir is relatively small, this habitat seems to be very important for both perch and roach (table 1). the littoral zone is often characterised by a higher structural complexity (e.g., macrophytes) and provides not only possibilities for predator avoidance but also a broad variety of food 52 table 2. interspeciﬁc food overlap values between different length groups of roach and perch in the

0.51 0.59 0.45 0.67 relation to the availability of food resources (gasith 1991). the great importance of pelagic zooplankton as a resource is reﬂected in the high proportion of zooplankton in the diet of all roach length groups as well as in the diet of small- and medium-sized classes of perch. in contrast to deep water bodies, the zooplanktiv- orous life stages of perch and roach do not have the option to segregate vertically within the pelagic zone of shallow water bodies. this lack of habitat availab- ility leads to high competition for zooplankton between perch and roach in the pelagic zone of shallow water bodies, and has been demonstrated in several studies on the interaction of both species (persson 1983b,1987; diehl 1988; bergman 1990; persson & eklo¨v 1995; bystro¨m et al. 1998). vertical segregation of perch and roach was not possible as all niche separation of perch and roach these studies were performed in enclosures and ponds or small and shallow lakes. the results of the study presented here corroborate those from the studies at lake vesija¨rvi and lake feldberger haussee, which indicate a spatial segregation of roach and perch connected with the utilisation of food resources from different water layers by these ﬁsh species (horppila et al. 2000; laude 2002). spatial separation of competition for food resources can lead to both horizontal and vertical the competing groups (werner & hall 1979) and is coupled with increasing resource partitioning (werner & hall 1979; persson 1983b). a similar consequence of the habitat separation of perch and roach in the saidenbach reservoir is the utilisation of different spatial food resources. in the reservoir daphnids as well as copepods were abundant in the upper 15 m of the water column (horn 2004). although both species were using this zooplankton as a food resource it was taken from different water depths and thus led to decreased competition. the separation of the zoo- planktonic food resources is supported by the fact that no signiﬁcant diurnal vertical migration of the daph- nids occurred in the saidenbach reservoir (horn, personal communication; rinke, personal communi- cation). persson (1983b) found that homogeneity of the environment prohibits the spatial segregation of the different year classes of perch. a large and deep pelagic zone with a vertical gradient in temperature offers the possibility of a spatial separation not only for perch year classes but also for different ﬁsh species. the segregation of perch and roach in the saidenbach reservoir is also related to the vertical temperature gradient. perch have a higher efﬁciency than roach in capturing zooplankton at temperatures below 18 °c, while roach is more efﬁcient than perch in capturing zooplankton at temperatures exceeding 18 °c (persson 1986). according to bryan et al. (1990), ﬁsh frequent the region where the most energy is available for growth. the optimal temperature range for growth of roach lies between 20 and 27 °c (van dijk et al. 2002). roach, therefore, preferred the upper water layers where temperatures were highest and in or near the optimum for growth and feeding. thus, the segregation of perch and roach along the temperature gradient the saidenbach reservoir might not only be a result of competition avoidance but also a result of selecting their optimal temperatures with respect to their species-speciﬁc foraging efﬁciency and growth. this conclusion is strongly supported by the much higher intraspeciﬁc food overlap. in the pelagic zone of the bottleneck hypothesis (persson & greenberg 1990) suggests that roach with its higher foraging efﬁciency at feeding on zooplankton would cause 53 kahl & radke juvenile perch to shift from feeding on zooplankton to macroinvertebrate prey. this results in a higher intraspeciﬁc competition between perch size classes, decreased growth and delay in their shift to the piscivorous stage, leading to stunted perch popula- tions. in the saidenbach reservoir perch up to 200 mm total length still fed on zooplankton to a large extent. the proportion of zooplankton in the diet decreased steadily with increasing size of perch and the proportion of piscivorous perch increased with increasing size. consequently, no early forcing to the macroinvertebrate stage took place. thus, we argue that the low intraspeciﬁc competition between perch size classes is a result of the low interspeciﬁc competition between roach and perch, and this, in turn, is a result of the strong habitat segregation between the species. the low interspeciﬁc and intra- speciﬁc competition should be reﬂected in fast growth. according to tesch (1955), the growth of perch in the saidenbach reservoir could be described as a fast (kahl & radke, in press). similar to perch the growth of in press) compared to other studies on roach from eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes (specziar et al. 1997; radke 1998; horppila & nyberg 1999). total lengths of >200 mm were common for both adult perch and roach, suggesting that the populations in the saidenbach reservoir were not stunted. roach is very fast (kahl & radke, from the results of this study and the results of the study at lake vesija¨rvi (horppila et al. 2000), it can be concluded that the possibility of niche separation between perch and roach in the spatial dimension and in the dimension of food utilisation can widen the juvenile competitive bottleneck to such an extent that the perch are not forced to compete with their older conspeciﬁcs during their ﬁrst year of life. a restric- tion of the juvenile competitive bottleneck hypothesis to small and shallow lakes though can only be derived from a comparative analysis of many lakes of different sizes and depths with simultaneous exclu- sion of confounding factors such as ﬁsh species composition, productivity, food resources or water transparency. thus, more investigations concerning the perch–roach interaction in large and deep lakes are necessary. it remains unclear why the ﬁsh community of this mesotrophic reservoir is dominated by roach and not by perch, despite mesotrophic conditions and low competition between these two ﬁsh species. one possible reason for this dominance of roach could lie in the age difference between perch and roach. both species achieve a size refuge from predation (e.g., by pike) in their fourth or ﬁfth year (kahl & radke, in press). roach by its higher lifespan (kahl & radke, in press) remains in this size refuge for a longer time than perch and thus can accumulate a much higher biomass. 54 as both species are r-strategists with a high potential for reproduction, only the higher mortality of perch can explain the dominance of roach. this higher mortality might be caused by selective predation of juvenile perch by older perch (christensen & persson 1993; do¨rner et al. 1999). thus, a higher mortality in their ﬁrst years together with a shorter lifespan prevents a comparable accumulation of large perch in the size refuge and consequently a dominance of perch in the ﬁsh community of the saidenbach reservoir. resumen 1. llevamos a cabo capturas con redes de agalla standard y verticales para obtener informacio´n sobre los patrones de distribucio´n, utilizacio´n de ha´bitat y alimentacio´n de perca ﬂuviatilis l.y rutilus rutilus (l.). los datos fueron utilizados para analizar premisas sobre interacciones entre estas dos especies en un embalse profundo y mesotro´ﬁco (saidenbach reservoir). 2. las capturas de redes verticales mostraron una separacio´n clara entre p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus en la direccio´ n vertical: mientras que r. rutilus preﬁrio´ la superﬁcie, p. ﬂuviatilis fue ma´s numerosa en los lı´mites ma´s profundos. r. rutilus de todos los grupos de longitud se alimentaron ba´sicamente de zooplankton (daphnias) pero tambie´n utilizaron insectos terres- tres, materia vegetal y detritus como recursos alimenticios. en la alimentacio´ n de p. ﬂuviatilis observamos que decrecio´ la proporcio´ n de zooplankton (daphnias and copepodos) e incre- mento´ la piscivorı´a al aumentar el taman˜o, de manera que no tuvo lugar un cambio al estadio de macro-invertebrados en la poblacio´ n de p. ﬂuviatilis. ambas especies mostraron un crecimiento relativamente ra´pido en relacio´n a otros estudios anteriores. 3. los resultados de este estudio indicaron que en un embalse grande y profundo, p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus son capaces de evitar la competencia separando sus nichos respectivos; prim- ero, en la dimensio´ n espacial y entonces, en la utilizacio´ n del alimento lo que resulta en una baja competencia entre ellas. una consecuencia es que la posibilidad de separacio´ n de nicho entre p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus en la dimensio´n espacial y conse- cuentemente en la utilizacio´ n de alimento, puede ampliar el cuello de botella de los juveniles. esta falta de competencia no ha resultado en una dominancia de p. ﬂuviatilis en el embalse sino que por el contrario, una acumulacio´n de varias clases de edad de r. rutilus de prolongada esperanza de vida ha causado una dominancia de ciprı´nidos. acknowledgements we wish to thank falk wieland for technical assistance. we also thank all
