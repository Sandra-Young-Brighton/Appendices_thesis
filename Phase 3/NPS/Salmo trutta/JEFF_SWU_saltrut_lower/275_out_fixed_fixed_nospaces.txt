(ii) migrations of anadromous ﬁsh with g. salaris in brackish water between watercourses (soleng et al. 1998); and (iii) human activity (johnsen et al. 1999). that have signiﬁcance for there is a need for more knowledge to elucidate the factors the long-term maintenance of g. salaris infections within a river system with several susceptible ﬁsh species. experi- mental studies indicate that some native ﬁsh species doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00184.x 99 knudsen et al. co-occurring with atlantic salmon [e.g., brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.), three-spined stickleback (gasteros- teus aculeatus l.) among others] can maintain infec- tions lasting from days to about 1 week (bakke et al. 2002). however, other species such as arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus (l.), seem to be suitable as hosts for the parasite (mo 1988) and can carry infections for several months (bakke et al. 1996). little attention has been paid to the role of these other susceptible host species (i.e., arctic charr) in maintaining g. salaris infections within the ﬁsh community in natural habitats (bakke et al. 2002). the risk of spreading of g. salaris between water- courses via migration of infected anadromous ﬁsh in brackish water is highly dependent on the salinity level in the fjord system (soleng & bakke 1997; soleng et al. 1998; paisley et al. 1999). in experimental studies with atlantic salmon parr, it has been observed that the survival of g. salaris decreases with increasing salinity and temperature (soleng & bakke 1997). low temperature of brackish water in northern fjords coinciding with the presence of anadromous ﬁsh (e.g., arctic charr) may thus facilitate the spreading of g. salaris between river systems (bakke et al. 1996). most sea-run arctic charr exhibit only a short duration of their stay in the fjord (30–60 days), and migrate only short distances from their native river (less than 30 km) (finstad & heggberget 1995; rikardsen et al. 2000). furthermore, the proportion of straying arctic charr to non-native freshwater systems or estuaries is highly variable (finstad & heggberget 1995). thus, the role of sea-run arctic charr with regard to the spreading of g. salaris is uncertain, because they spend most of their time in the inner, more brackish parts of the fjords compared to sea_trout and atlantic salmon. until 2000, river skibotnelva was the only water- course in troms and finnmark counties (north norway) infested with g. salaris, but that year the parasite was also recorded in signaldalselva, about 20 km further south but within the same fjord system. both of these atlantic salmon rivers have riverine stocks of anadromous arctic charr, which is quite uncommon in norway. arctic charr may occur as both anadromous and resident populations within the same watercourse (kristoffersen et al. 1994; klemetsen et al. 2003). bakke et al. (1996) found that a resident strain of arctic charr from south-eastern norway was less susceptible to g. salaris than offspring from the anadromous hammerfest stock from northern norway. during these experiments, groups of anadromous arctic charr remained infected over several months. the current study will focus on factors associated with the suitability of arctic charr as a host for g. salaris in the wild and the risk of brackish water dispersal of the parasite to new watercourses by infected anadromous individuals. we hypothesise that 100 juvenile arctic charr frequently acquire g. salaris, and that the parasite is able to reproduce on this ﬁsh species. secondly, we expect that within the river, both adult descending anadromous arctic charr in early spring and ascending ﬁsh in the autumn will be infected with g. salaris. material and methods the study was carried out in river signaldalselva (69°50¢n, 19°10¢e). the watercourse has its outlet in the head of storfjorden, which is a part of the lyngenfjord in troms county, north norway. the catchment area is about 441 km2, and anadromous ﬁsh are able to migrate approximately 30 km upstream. the ﬁsh species in the river system are atlantic salmon, arctic charr, brown_trout, grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.), alpine sculpin (cottus poecilopus haeckel), three-spined stickleback, minnow (phoxinus phoxinus l.), eel (anguilla anguilla l.) and ﬂounder (platichthys ﬂesus l.). in total, 117 specimens of arctic charr and 77 parr of atlantic salmon were caught from 28th september to 7th october 2003 by electroﬁshing in the river. the ﬁsh were individually preserved in glass containers in 96% ethanol. moreover, 19 and 24 potential descend- ing arctic charr were caught by ice ﬁshing in april 2003 and 2004, respectively, and nine arctic charr ascending from the sea were caught by gill-nets in october 2003. these ﬁsh were preserved (individually or in groups) in 96% ethanol. parr of atlantic salmon and arctic charr were placed in water and examined for gyrodactylus parasites under a stereo microscope. the number of worms was counted on the ﬁns and the body of the ﬁsh. from a study in signaldalselva in september 2004, gyrodactylus on atlantic salmon and arctic charr were found to be morphologic and molecular identical and belong to the g. salaris clad i, haplotype b according to hansen et al. (2003). (robertsen 2005), the terms prevalence (proportion of the population infected), mean intensity of parasites (the mean number of parasites in infected hosts) and mean abundance (the mean number of parasites in both infected and uninfected hosts) are used according to bush et al. (1997). statistical analyses were conducted (v2) and mann–whitney using chi-squared tests u-tests (systat version 10.2, systat inc. 2002). results very few atlantic salmon parr were greater than 70 mm (age 1+ or more) in length, while many arctic charr parr were older than 0+ (>70 mm) (fig. 1). the prevalence of g. salaris on atlantic salmon parr was gyrodactylus salaris in arctic charr arctic charr parr (age 0+ and 1+ combined) showed little variation between sites sampled along the studied stretch of the river, although the density of atlantic salmon parr was highly variable at different localities (fig. 3). none of the potential sea-running arctic charr (i.e., descending) were infected with g. salaris in april 2003 (n ¼ 19) and april 2004 (n ¼ 24) (table 2). however, two of the nine arctic charr caught in the river (i.e., ascending) were infected with g. salaris in the autumn (2003). discussion the high prevalence and intensity of g. salaris observed in the anadromous stock of arctic charr examined in the current ﬁeld study suggests that the parasite is able to reproduce on this species, suggest- ing that this is a suitable host in nature. these results conﬁrm earlier experimental studies, which suggested that offspring of anadromous arctic charr from hammerfest are good hosts for g. salaris (bakke et al. 1996). in contrast, a south-eastern norwegian lake resident arctic charr population appeared to be resistant against g. salaris (bakke et al. 1996). anadromous stocks of arctic charr therefore seem capable of acting as long-term hosts for g. salaris, and are probably able to maintain an infection within a river system even if the co-occurring atlantic salmon population is severely reduced or goes extinct. during the epidemic growth of the g. salaris population shortly after an invasion, atlantic salmon parr in norwegian rivers typically suffer high mortal- ity, and only a few ﬁsh recover from the infection (johnsen et al. 1999). in signaldalselva, the oldest age groups (‡1+) of parr had the highest intensities of parasites, and electroﬁshing demonstrated very low densities of ﬁsh. this pattern is similar to those found in other studies from nordland county and river systems further south (johnsen & jensen 1992; mo 1992; johnsen et al. 1999) and indicates high mortal- ity rates of atlantic salmon parr, leaving very few individuals to undergo smoltiﬁcation and migrate to fig. 1. length distribution of atlantic salmon and arctic charr caught by electroﬁshing in signaldalselva in october 2003 (n, number of ﬁsh). 93.5% and 64% on arctic charr parr collected by the electroﬁshing from the river (table 1). the highest infection of an atlantic salmon (age 1+) was 10,445 parasites and an arctic charr (age 0+) was 534 parasites. the mean abundance was 848 and 23, respectively, with variance-to-mean-ratios (s2= x ) of 4935 and 263, respectively. the atlantic salmon parr that were older than 0+ were all heavily infected with g. salaris (fig. 2). in comparison, parr of arctic charr (age 0+ and 1+) were less infected, but 9.2 % of these parr had infections of 100 or more worms. the prevalence of gyrodactylus on arctic charr of age ‡2+ was considerably less (chi- squared tests, p < 0.05) compared to both age 0+ and age 1+ arctic charr. no signiﬁcant differences in parasite abundance were found between age 0+ (n ¼ 58) and 1+ (n ¼ 40) arctic charr parr (mann– whitney u-test, p ¼ 0.355), but both these age groups (0+ and 1+) of ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly (mann–whitney u-tests, p < 0.01) more infested than

electroﬁshing in signaldalselva in october 2003 (n, number of ﬁsh). this population may act as a focal point that that inﬂicts a high infection pressure upon all susceptible host species in the riverine ﬁsh community. conse- quently, arctic charr were heavily infected with g. salaris, although the intensities were generally lower than in the atlantic salmon parr. the infection level of arctic charr parr was also relatively stable in different parts of the river, although the density of atlantic salmon parr was variable. furthermore, the high prevalence in arctic charr suggests that the suggested transmission rates from atlantic salmon and/or between conspeciﬁcs of arctic charr are high. this is somewhat surprising, as these two species utilise different habitats within the river, and juvenile arctic charr are less aggressive than the territorial atlantic salmon parr (heggberget 1984). in signal- dalselva, the atlantic salmon parr were mainly caught within restricted areas characterised by high water velocity, while small arctic charr were typically located in slow-running and shallow waters along the riverbank. the observed low overlap in habitat between atlantic salmon and arctic charr suggests that the transmission of g. salaris via the substrate and/or drift in the water column is important (soleng et al. 1999). moreover, the behaviour of heavily infected ﬁsh may increase the transmission rates between susceptible hosts, as it has been observed that atlantic salmon parr and other host species with heavy burdens of gyrodactylus behave abnormally and exhibit increased contact with other conspeciﬁcs (scott 1985; bakke et al. 1992; soleng et al. 1999; cable et al. 2002). thus, the population dynamics of g. salaris in the susceptible ﬁsh guild seem highly dependent upon processes that govern the patterns of contact both within and between the different ﬁsh fig. 3. abundance (±se) of gyrodactylus salaris on different age groups of atlantic salmon parr (age: 0+, circles; ‡1+, triangles) and arctic charr parr (age: 0+ and 1+ combined, squares) caught by electroﬁshing in different parts (lower: 9 km; middle: 18 km; upper: 25 km from the outlet)

extinct within a few years. the typical epidemic progress of the g. salaris infection observed on atlantic salmon parr means 102 populations, such as host density, behaviour and spatial distribution within the river. the prevalence of g. salaris of arctic charr peaked in 1-year-old ﬁsh and then decreased signiﬁcantly in older age groups. such a pattern may occur if the frequency of innate resistance increases either with host age or as a response to infections. in experimental studies with isolated offspring of anadromous arctic charr from the hammerfest strain and alta strain (bakke et al. 1996; harris et al. 2000), it was observed that the infrapopulations of g. salaris increased rap- idly, immediately after infection of naı¨ve ﬁsh, and then died out with time. an innate resistance against the parasite was suggested as an explanation for this progress as individuals varied from highly susceptible to highly resistant to the parasite (harris et al. 2000). similarly, a decrease in the intensities of g. salaris on individual ﬁsh was also observed in experimental studies with both grayling and rainbow trout (onc- orhynchus mykiss walbaum) (soleng & bakke 2001). however, in all these ﬁsh species (i.e., arctic charr, grayling, rainbow trout), ﬁsh held in groups sustained infections with g. salaris from one to several months (bakke et al. 1996; harris et al. 2000; soleng & bakke 2001). one possible explanation of these patterns is that an eventual acquired resistance in individual ﬁsh is of a transient nature. in other words, the ﬁsh might become capable to eliminate the infection and then possess a high degree of protection (e.g., immunity) for some time, but this protection is eventually lost and the ﬁsh again become susceptible to infection (scott 1985). according to anderson (1982), such a model (i.e., where immunity is not lifelong) may result in the maintenance of an endemic disease in a host population. studies, bakke et al. on the other hand, reduced parasite burdens in the oldest parr of arctic charr may also be attributed to excess mortality of the most heavily infected ﬁsh. from experimental (1996) observed a high mortality of young arctic charr most probably caused by high intensities of g. salaris. but in these studies, the arctic charr carried much higher intensities (>1000 worms) than the intensities we observed in the wild arctic charr (max. approx. 530). in comparison, live-caught atlantic salmon parr of similar sizes had intensities of several thousand g. salaris in signaldalselva. based on this, it is not likely that the wild arctic charr within this locality suffered high instantaneous parasite-induced mortali- ties. however, the parasite can differ between parr of atlantic salmon and arctic charr, and it is still uncertain how ‘medium intensities’ (approx. 100 worms) may affect juvenile arctic charr over long time intervals (e.g., during winter with 6–7 months of ice cover and low water temperatures), also in combination with secondary the relative tolerance against gyrodactylus salaris in arctic charr bacterial or fungus infections (busch et al. 2003). further physiological studies are therefore needed to show how chronic sublethal intensities of g. salaris inﬂuence their ﬁsh hosts. in the spring, all the large and potentially descend- ing anadromous arctic charr that were examined were uninfected, but in october, two ascending specimens carried g. salaris. it is thus most likely that these ﬁsh became infected after entering the river from the sea about 1 or 2 months prior to catch, when migrating upstream through shallow water. however, the low prevalence among large ascending charr (approx. 22%) in the autumn indicates a low risk of infection, and this may be related to their habitat choice in the river. all these ﬁsh were caught in a deep pool about 18 km upstream from the sea, and had probably spent little time within the restricted areas with rifﬂes containing heavily infected atlantic salmon parr, which are probably the most important focal points of infection in the river. on the other hand, is possible that these large arctic charr had been infected already while moving downstream in the spring and maintained the infections throughout their 1- to 2- month stay in the sea. soleng & bakke (1997) found that g. salaris is able to survive long periods in brackish water with low temperatures. similar condi- tions often occur in northern brackish fjords, during periods with high runoff from melting snow, which can coincide with sea-run arctic charr presence there. this may thus facilitate the spread of g. salaris between watercourses. it must, however, be empha- sised that our samples of large arctic charr were small, so additional studies are needed for a more thorough evaluation of the risk of further spreading of g. salaris with anadromous arctic charr through brackish water to other atlantic salmon rivers in northern norway. it in summary, the current study showed that parr of anadromous arctic charr were heavily infected with g. salaris, and may thus have the potential to act as suitable long-term hosts in a similar way to atlantic salmon in riverine ﬁsh communities/guilds. only a few large returning adult arctic charr migrants were infected in the autumn, and it is still uncertain whether sea-run arctic charr are able to spread the parasite to new watercourses. further studies on (i) the long-term dynamics of the host–parasite interactions; and (ii) sublethal physiological effects of infections upon the ﬁsh are needed to quantify the potential negative implications of g. salaris in these unique anadromous riverine arctic charr populations. acknowledgements we would like to thank many of the sport ﬁshermen
