(2003) argued that while temperature may determine potential recruitment strength, discharge determines the actual strength. however, these studies on cyprinid recruit- the study area was in the middle reaches of the river wensum (n 52°43¢5.4¢¢, e 0°59¢42.9¢¢ to n 52°38¢28.9¢¢, e 1°16¢31.7¢¢), where the channel was 15–20 m in width and 0.5–3 m in depth. fish population surveys were conducted in 1983, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1997, 2006 and 2008 by boat-mounted electric ﬁshing across ﬁve sites of 100 m in length and completing two passes. some supplementary surveys were also completed in 1989 and 1991. in these samples, r. rutilus was the most numerically correspondence: dr.j. r. britton, centre for conservation ecology, school of conservation sciences, bournemouth university, poole, dorset bh12 5bb, uk. e-mail: rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk 168 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00549.x abundant species. captured ﬁsh were identiﬁed to species, measured (fork length, mm) and three scales taken from each ﬁsh. these scales were analysed on a projecting microscope where an estimated age and the associated annuli and scale radius measurements were recorded, enabling the year-class of each ﬁsh to be determined along with its back-calculated length at age 1 using the scale-proportional method (francis 1990). in samples, ﬁsh were present between age 1+ and 13+ years old. variation in recruitment between 1970 and 2004 was estimated using the ycs method of cowx & frear (2004) that produced ycs values above 100 (strong year class) and below 100 (weak year class). the ycs values for each year class per sample were then expressed as standardised residuals, where the residual was calculated as the difference between the ycs value for that year class and the mean ycs for the sample. where a year class was present in two surveys, the mean ycs standardised residual for each year class was determined. this analysis revealed that the long-term recruitment pattern of r. rutilus was short periods of strong recruitment, generally two or three consecutive years, interspersed by several years of poorer recruitment (fig. 1a). the relationship between ycs and temperature was tested. water temperature data were available for only 756 days in the entire study period. consequently, the relationship between air temperature (at; central england temperature dataset; meteorological ofﬁce 2009) and the water temperature (wt) was determined and then used to convert daily air temperature data into water temperature data using their linear relationship (wt = at · 0.90 + 1.95; r2 = 0.87; f1,754 = 879.2, p < 0.001). these water temperature data were then used to determine the annual number of degree-days >12 °c (nunn et al. 2003), as this temperature is generally required for growth of temperate cyprinids (britton 2007). the relationship between degree-days >12 °c and ycs was then also positive and signif- regression: r2 = 0.36, f1,33 = 10.97, icant p < 0.01; fig. 1b). (linear the inﬂuence of river ﬂow on ycs was tested next. daily ﬂow data were used to construct the ﬂow duration curve, and determine the annual number of ﬂow days above the mean daily ﬂow (nunn et al. 2003) and coefﬁcient of variation of ﬂow per year (cv, standard deviation ⁄ mean ﬂow). the ﬂow dura- tion curve revealed a relatively stable hydrological regime with a mean daily ﬂow of 2.77 ± 2.10 m)3æs)1 (fig. 1c); comparison with the duration curve for the yorkshire ouse of nunn et al.

(r2 = 0.29, smaller thus, these long-term population data for r. rutilus in a chalk river revealed that years of strong recruit- ment were infrequent and, similar to the prediction, associated with summers where water temperatures were relatively high, shown by mean temperatures in july and august, and an increased number of degree- days above 12 °c in the year. that river discharge had little inﬂuence on recruitment success is in contrast to most studies that suggest periods of elevated discharge may have deleterious effects on 0+ ﬁsh and results in 169 beardsley & britton (a) 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 –0.5 –1 –1.5 –2 0 7 9 1 3 7 9 1 6 7 9 1 9 7 9 1 2 8 9 1 5 8 9 1 8 8 9 1 1 9 9 1 4 9 9 1 7 9 9 1 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 h t g n e r t s s s a l c r a e y ) l a u d i s e r d e s i d r a d n a t s n a e m ( ) 1 – s · 3 m ( e t a r w o l f y l i a d n a e m 100 (c) 10 1 0.1 0 (b) 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 –0.5 –1 h t g n e r t s s s a l c r a e y ) l a u d i s e r d e s i d r a d n a t s n a e m ( –1.5 –2 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0 8 degree days > 12 oc (d) 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 –0.5 –1 h t g n e r t s s s a l c r a e y ) l a u d i s e r d e s i d r a d n a t s n a e m ( –1.5 –2 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 exceedance percentile (%) 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 0 9 flow days above mean flow h t g n e l h s i f + 0  d e t s u j d a - n a e m l a u d i s e r d e s i d r a d n a t s n a e m ( 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 –0.2 –0.4 –0.6 –0.8 –1 (e) –2 –1 0 1 2 year class strength (mean standardised residual) fig. 1.
