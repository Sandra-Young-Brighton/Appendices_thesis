(ovidio et al. 2000), despite the considerable use of telemetry to inves- tigate the movements and habitat use of freshwater ﬁsh in australia (primarily members of the percich- thyidae), only a few examples exist where habitat provision in the context of spatial ecology is addressed (crook et al. 2001; simpson & mapleston 2002; koehn et al. 2008). as both temporal and spa- tial scale can inﬂuence results and management rec- ommendations addressing habitat management at scales relevant to each species is necessary (crook et al. 2001). there is little agree- ment, however, as to the appropriate temporal and spatial scales at which to provide habitat for a spe- cies. for example, koehn et al. (2008) recommended localised habitat management founded upon limited dispersal and restricted movement of adult trout cod (maccullochella macquariensis) using daytime telem- etry observations over coarse time intervals (weekly to monthly). other studies have found that trout cod are primarily active at night and that large-scale movement also occurs sporadically and over rela- tively short time scales (days) (thiem et al. 2008; ebner & thiem 2009), and that other percichthyids behave similarly (harris 1988; crook et al. 2001). consequently, there exists a need to document move- ment and behaviour of percichthyids at a ﬁne tempo- ral scale to capture diel preferences and also across sufﬁcient time scales to document seasonal effects on diel activity. and range including reductions macquarie perch (macquaria australasica: perc- ichthyidae) is an endangered freshwater ﬁsh endemic to the murray-darling basin and coastal drainages of south-eastern australia (ingram et al. 2000). primar- ily anthropogenic disturbances have resulted in popu- lation habitat degradation, barriers to ﬁsh passage, overﬁshing and introduced species (ingram et al. 2000; lintermans 2007; koehn & lintermans 2012). macquarie perch adults form aggregations during the spawning season, but are thought to be largely solitary at other times of the year (cadwallader & rogan 1977; ebner & lin- termans 2007; ryan 2010). despite being an obligate riverine spawner, some reservoirs now serve as ref- uge habitats for the species (ebner et al. 2011). the cotter reservoir is one such reservoir and provides suitable habitat for adults throughout much of the year, with extensive fringing macrophyte beds, result- ing from stable reservoir water levels, serving as diurnal refuge from cormorant predation (ebner & lintermans 2007). however, growing demands for urban water supply will result in an expansion of the reservoir to ~20 times its original capacity, resulting in inundation and destruction of critical refuge habitat 146 and loss of spawning habitat (lintermans 2012). despite short-term predictions of rapid population growth for ﬁsh following productivity blooms com- monly associated with newly inundated areas in res- ervoirs (o’brien 1990), concerns exist regarding the long-term fate of macquarie perch populations, including the provision of suitable refuge habitat, as previous experience with this species has demon- strated severe declines associated with reservoir age- ing (lintermans 2007, 2012). although some spatial information exists for macquarie perch within cotter reservoir (ebner & lintermans 2007; ebner et al. 2010, 2011), a more extensive knowledge of the sea- sonal movements of this species is required. this information is necessary to provide conservative guidelines for the provision of refuge habitat within the new reservoir by understanding what constitutes suitable habitat for the species under current condi- tions (lintermans 2012). this is particularly relevant in the light of changes to key refuge habitats since the study of ebner et al. (2010) resulting from a major bushﬁre event in 2003 (carey et al. 2003). further, inundation of the new reservoir and its use as a domestic water supply will result in an increase in maximum depth of 50 m, ﬂuctuating water levels unlikely to promote the establishment of new macro- phyte beds and an operational draw down of 13 m (lintermans 2012). the objectives of this study were to determine the diel movements and activity of mac- quarie perch among seasons in cotter reservoir. study area the study was conducted in cotter reservoir (35°19′s, 148°55′e), the smallest (10.6 km perimeter, 4 gl capacity, 23 m maximum depth, 501 m above sea level (asl)) and most downstream of three reservoirs on the cotter river in the australian capital territory (fig. 1). the cotter river drains a catchment area of 482 km2 and has an annual discharge of 63 ± 11 gl. the dominant substrate of the cotter reservoir is soft sediments as a result of forestry practices, and this combined with a stable water level since its decommis- sioning as a water reservoir in the 1970s has allowed establishment of (typha, phragmites and juncus). these macrophytes cover much of the shoreline, except for steep rocky banks in deeper downstream sections of the reservoir (ebner & lintermans 2007; ebner et al. 2007). macquarie perch is the only native ﬁsh inhabiting cotter reservoir, two-spined although blackﬁsh (gadopsis bispinosus) occur in the cotter river upstream of the reservoir. alien ﬁshes in the reservoir include goldﬁsh (carassius auratus), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), brown_trout (salmo_trutta), oriental weather loach (misgurnus anguillicaudatus) emergent macrophytes indigenous the diel movement of macquarie perch fig. 1. location of the study site cotter reservoir, in the australian capital territory, used to monitor seasonal movements and behaviour of macquarie perch. locations of remote monitoring stations are indicated by circles. and eastern gambusia (gambusia holbrooki) (ebner & lintermans 2007; lintermans 2012). fish in cotter reservoir are exposed to strong seasonal trends in water quality, with near surface water temperature and dissolved oxygen ranging from 8.7–24.0 °c and 8.3– 10.4 mgl  1, respectively, with both parameters exhib- iting seasons (fig. 2). depth-dependent patterns among material and methods telemetry macquarie perch were captured in gill nets (75– 125 mm stretch mesh size) soaked for ~ 6 h and checked hourly. initial capture and tagging occurred in april 2008, with additional individuals tagged where necessary to boost seasonal sample sizes in december 2008 and february, march and may 2009 (reduced sample size caused by emigration down- stream or upstream from the study area, predator removal or tag failure). a total of 93 macquarie perch >220 mm total length (tl) were surgically implanted with radio tags (ats model f1170 and f1040 internal coil radio tags, weight 2.5 and 4.0 g in air, respectively; 158 and 441 days battery capacity, respectively; advanced telemetry systems, isanti, mn, usa) by the same experienced surgeon. surgery was conducted the day following capture as most captures occurred at night and nets required constant monitoring, with individual ﬁsh held over- night in 250 l aerated containers supplied regularly with fresh water. individuals were anaesthetised in a bath containing alfaxan (cd rtu alfaxalone; jurox, rutherford, australia) at a concentration of 3–4 ml per 10 l water until loss of equilibrium and paired ﬁn movement, at which time they were measured and weighed prior to surgery. all aspects of the surgical method were identical to those previously described in broadhurst et al. (2009) for internal coil radio tags, and individuals also received an injection of antibi- otic prior to surgery (baytril 50, 0.01 mlkg  1 wet weight of ﬁsh; bayer ag, leverkusen, germany) to minimise risk of infection. release occurred after sunset the day of surgery to minimise the risk of immediate daytime avian predation following release. details are presented in table 1 for only those indi- viduals for which diel movement metrics via manual and/or remote monitoring were obtained during the study (n = 44, 350.8 ± 9.4 mm tl, 700.6 ± 45.9 g weight). manual radio tracking over a single diel period (24 h) was conducted on all macquarie perch with active transmitters within the study area in spring (november, n = 16) 2008 and in summer (january, n = 18), autumn (may, n = 13) and winter (july, n = 16) in 2009. the size (tl) of macquarie perch tracked did not signiﬁcantly differ among seasons 147 thiem et al. ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w ) 1 – l g m  ( n e g y x o d e v l o s s i d (a) (b) 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1 m 3 m 6 m 9 m 0.3 m 3 m 6 m 9 m spring summer autumn winter season fig. 2. seasonal water temperature (a) and dissolved oxygen (b) proﬁles at indicated water depths for cotter reservoir during manual radio-tracking periods. data are represented as means ± 1 se for water temperature which was collected hourly. dissolved oxygen values were only recorded once during each season. (kruskal–wallis v2 1.7672, df = 3, p = 0.6221). one day prior to manual tracking, a complete scan for radio-tagged macquarie perch was conducted to identify radio frequencies within the reservoir. in some cases, temporary emigration into upstream riv- erine habitats during this period resulted in missed seasonal information for a small number of individu- als. in a subset of cases, the same individuals were tracked in multiple seasons; however, no ﬁsh were tracked across all seasons (table 1). macquarie perch were located four-hourly from a 3 m petrol-powered boat (beginning at 1000 h and ending at 1000 h the following day), resulting in seven ﬁxes per individual for each diel period. fish were located using a scanning receiver (australis 26k, titley electronics, ballina, australia) and a handheld three-element yagi locations were antenna (titley electronics). initial obtained using triangulation whilst the boat was under power. once a location for an individual had been determined, effort was made to obtain an accu- rate location by positioning the boat directly over the ﬁsh whilst not under power to reduce the chance of 148 scaring ﬁsh. occasional visual observations made during daylight tracking in shallow water indicated this method was accurate and did not alarm individu- als. locations at each time period were recorded using a handheld gps (gps 76; garmin, olathe, ks, usa), distance from the nearest shoreline was deter- mined using a laser rangeﬁnder (elite 1500; bush- nell corporation, overland park, ks, usa) and depth of water occupied determined from depth sounder readings (eagle cuda 168 fishﬁnder), with ﬁsh assumed to be near the substrate (i.e., at the maximum depth of the location). locations were added to arcmap (esri, redlands, ca, usa) and overlaid on a base-map of cotter res- ervoir. each location was checked to conﬁrm position accuracy of gps collected points using the measuring tool in arcmap and compared with distance from shore measurements and detailed notes taken during tracking, with adjustments made where necessary by editing individual locations. movement paths were generated for each individual using the hawth’s analysis tools extension in arcmap (beyer 2004). movement paths frequently crossed land boundaries and were edited in arcmap to represent the minimum distance travelled through water between two spatial locations to produce landmass unaffected estimates (ebner et al. 2010). area use was determined from minimum convex polygons (mcp). the diel metrics calculated were diel range (the maximum linear dis- tance traversed in 24 h, generally from downstream to upstream extremities) and diel mobility (the sum of all distances moved between consecutive tracks in 24 h). the distances moved by macquarie perch between tracking intervals were used to determine differences in movements within diel periods. diurnal linear range was calculated based on the distance moved from 1000 to 1400 h across all seasons as these times represented the only full daylight tracking occasions transferable between seasons. water level was purposely maintained at a stable height of 0.5 m below full supply level during all diel assessment periods, with this water level allowing ﬁsh to access the majority of littoral macrophyte habitats. seasonal diel activity was determined remotely, by logging radio signal strength from tagged macquarie perch for 28 days in each of four seasons; from sep- tember to october 2008 (spring), january to february 2009 (summer), april to may 2009 (autumn) and june to july 2009 (winter). these periods occurred prior to spring, autumn and winter manual tracking periods and post-summer manual tracking. six ﬁxed data logging stations were positioned in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the reservoir (fig. 1) and consisted of a data logger and receiver combina- tion (dcii model d5041 and r4100, respectively, ats) connected to a three-element yagi antenna

each time a tagged macquarie perch was within detection range (~100 m radius). where macquarie perch remained within detection range of an antenna for an extended period of time (minimum three records within an hour), an hourly activity value was calcu- lated based on the variation between logged radio signal strength (thiem et al. 2010). records that did not conform to this were discarded. due to the small detection range of antennas and the comparatively uncommon. activity large distances moved by macquarie perch, continu- ous activity records for a 24 h period at a single loca- tion were records were subsequently pooled for each season, with raw data plotted in a single ﬁgure representing multiple records for individual ﬁsh, data logging stations and diel peri- ods to generate broad seasonal activity patterns for macquarie perch. in addition, loess (local regression smoother) polynomial curves were applied to the raw activity data for each season separately and overlaid on raw data. curves were applied in r (version 2.14.2; r development core team 2012) to aid visual interpretation of activity trends, with a span of 0.5 applied based on visual inspection of best ﬁt to the 149 thiem et al. raw data. water level was deliberately maintained at a stable height of 2 m below full supply level during all remote telemetry monitoring periods. this water level effectively isolated the fringing emergent macrophytes as potential ﬁsh habitat and simulated likely condi- tions of a barren shoreline in the enlarged reservoir. statistical analysis linear mixed models (lmm) were used to test for differences in movement metrics (diel range, mobility and area use) and depth occupation among seasons, based on manual tracking data. individual ﬁsh were frequently tracked across more than one season (although never among all four seasons), subse- quently lmm enabled partitioning of the random effects of individuals so that the main effect of sea- son could be analysed (field 2009). wald conﬁdence intervals of the parameter estimates were used to determine signiﬁcant post hoc comparisons. spear- man rank correlations were used to determine rela- tionships between tl (at the time of tagging) and seasonal movement metrics (diel range, mobility and area use) as length data were not normally distributed due to the probable inclusion of multiple year classes of this annual spawner. where multiple movement metrics existed for individuals among seasons, an average movement metric for that individual was used in the correlation analysis. one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (rm anova) were used to determine whether the distance moved and depth occupied by macquarie perch differed during the diel cycle, within a season, based on manual tracking. where data did not meet the assumption of sphericity for rm anova, a greenhouse-geisser correction factor was applied (field 2009). pair-wise post hoc compar- isons were conducted following a signiﬁcant rm ano- va result, using bonferroni procedures to account for the departure from sphericity and the number of multiple comparisons (field 2009). data were tested for the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality using the methods outlined by grafen & hails (2002), and were transformed where necessary to achieve approximate normal distribution and homogeneity of variance. all statistical analyses were conducted in spss (v.18; spss inc., chicago, il, usa) and a = 0.05 level of signiﬁcance used to reject null hypotheses of no statistically signiﬁcant difference. values are reported as a

2.056, p = 0.126, fig. 5c). mac- quarie perch generally exhibited increased movement during crepuscular and reduced movements during diurnal periods. in spring and summer, movements were greatest from 1800 to 2200, whereas movements were greatest from 1400 to 1800 in winter. the least movement occurred from 1000 to 1400 in spring, 1400 to 1800 in summer and 2200 to 0200 in winter. pooling diurnal movements (distance moved between 1000 and 1400 h) for all seasons identiﬁed that 75% of macquarie perch movements were <100 m and 95% of movements were <330 m during the day. remote monitoring of macquarie perch indicated largely similar patterns of activity to those detected by manual tracking (fig. 6). hourly activity was heightened at sunrise and imme- diately following sunset in spring (fig. 6a). in sum- 152 mer, macquarie perch were most active at night (fig. 6b), whereas there were no distinct peaks in activity during autumn (fig. 6c). in winter, macqua- rie perch were primarily active from just prior to sun- rise until early afternoon (fig. 6d). discussion macquarie perch exhibited signiﬁcant seasonal differ- ences in diel range in this study, although observed differences in diel mobility and the area used were not signiﬁcant. the largest movements occurred in winter, and larger movements across all seasons were typically made by smaller individuals. ebner et al. (2011) previously identiﬁed larger home ranges for macquarie perch in autumn compared with spring in cotter reservoir, but provided no comparable infor- mation from summer or winter. potential explana- tions in seasonal movements in the current study may include shifts in seasonal food availability, predation pressure or swimming performance. macquarie perch are oppor- the observed differences for (a) spring n = 19 diel movement of macquarie perch (b) summer n = 15 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 0 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 (c) autumn n = 15 (d) winter n = 20 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 ) % v c 0 1 g o l ( y t i v i t c a 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 0 5 10 15 20 0 time of day (h) 5 10 15 20 fig. 6. diel activity (log10-transformed coefﬁcient of variation (cv%) of logged hourly radio signal strength) of macquarie perch among seasons in cotter reservoir determined by remote telemetry. symbols identify contributions from different individuals, a loess smoothing curve is added to aid visual representation of data and grey shading indicates approximate night periods based on local sunrise and sunset times. tunistic generalist feeders at times (cadwallader & douglas 1986), a strategy also exhibited by other reservoir dwelling percichthyids (smith et al. 2011b). food resources in cotter reservoir vary seasonally, and although decapods still form a substantial propor- tion of macquarie perch diet in winter, decapod abundance is lower at this time of year compared to other seasons (norris et al. 2012). this may require macquarie perch to move larger distances to encoun- ter the same quantity of prey items as those encoun- tered over shorter distances in the other three seasons to meet energetic requirements, and potentially also explains the increased use of shallow water at night in winter. alternatively, the general absence of great cormorants (phalocrocorax carbo) in winter (ryan 2010) may provide a release from the movement restrictions imposed by the threat of predation, as these piscivorous birds are known diurnal predators the seasonal differences of adult macquarie perch in cotter reservoir (ebner & lintermans 2007; lintermans et al. 2011). swim- ming performance is considered an unlikely explana- tion for in movements exhibited by macquarie perch in this study. starrs et al. (2011) identiﬁed that swimming performance of macquarie perch across a range of size classes was poorer at water temperatures of 10 °c (equivalent to water temperature during winter in this study) in comparison with 16 and 20 °c. although the exact mechanism explaining the larger movements of mac- quarie perch in winter remains unresolved, prey availability and/or predation pressure appear the most likely explanations, with the combined effect possibly resulting in greater risk-taking behaviour. while the vertical position of macquarie perch was unsubstantiated in the current study, the species was recorded in deeper water habitats in summer 153 thiem et al. it for deeper water may result the summer and autumn. subsequently, (across the diel cycle) relative to other seasons. this preference from behavioural thermoregulation, predator avoidance or prey depth distribution. behavioural thermoregula- tion has commonly been documented for other spe- cies of ﬁsh in lentic waters and is often associated with bioenergetic beneﬁts (snucins & gunn 1995; biro 1998; bazarov 2011). in cotter reservoir, available lentic habitat (and subsequent depth thresh- old) is likely controlled by the seasonal interplay between optimum water temperature and the depth distribution of dissolved oxygen (e.g., stefan et al. 1995; smith et al. 2011a), since dissolved oxygen drops to below 4 mgl  1 at depths of 9 m for much is of possible that the volume of reservoir available to macquarie perch is vastly reduced during these sea- sons due to critical limits of dissolved oxygen (smith et al. 2011a), although the tolerances of macquarie perch to oxygen levels remain unknown. the high water temperatures observed in shallow waters during summer may also force macquarie perch out of preferred littoral habitats, thus further reducing the volume of available habitat. alterna- tively, use of deeper water by macquarie perch in summer may reﬂect a behavioural response to increased predation pressure. other percichthyids are known to occupy deeper water during diurnal peri- ods (e.g., crook et al. 2001; koehn 2009), and crook et al. (2001) hypothesised that this was a response to daytime avian predation pressure. while the risk of avian predation is real (ebner & linter- mans 2007; lintermans et al. 2011) and seasonal (ryan 2010), it does not explain the use of deeper water during both diurnal and nocturnal periods by macquarie perch in summer as great cormorant ﬁsh- ing periods are largely diurnal in cotter reservoir (ryan 2010). it is unlikely that prey depth distribu- tion explains macquarie perch use of deeper water in summer as seasonally abundant dietary items such as decapods are most commonly associated with lit- toral habitats at time (norris et al. 2012), although the feeding preferences of cotter reservoir macquarie perch in summer remain unknown. this manual radio tracking identiﬁed that macquarie perch were generally more active during crepuscular or nocturnal periods in the current study. this activity pattern is consistent with the ﬁndings from previous telemetry study of this species (ebner & lintermans 2007; ebner et al. 2010), and from telemetry studies of other percichthyid species (e.g., thiem et al. 2008). the exception to this occurred in winter, when macquarie perch were observed to move compara- tively large distances throughout much of the diel cycle. as discussed earlier, the large distances moved in winter are likely associated with the general 154 absence of predators during this time, or seasonal prey distribution. remote assessment of macquarie perch activity identiﬁed peak activity periods as lar- gely crepuscular in spring, diurnal in winter, noctur- nal in summer and no distinguishable activity period in autumn. whilst the remote monitoring technique used in this study has many advantages over manual tracking in terms of the temporal resolution able to be achieved and the absence of any observer effect, it is more suited to site-attached species (thiem et al. 2010). macquarie perch frequently moved on scales outside of the detection range of remote telemetry during both day and night, leading to a small number of data points and discontinuous records and thus providing a potential explanation for the lack of clear diel patterns observed. increasing transmitter power output or using radio tags with trailing antennas rep- resent options to increase spatial coverage of remote telemetry arrays. in the current study, both the body size to radio tag size constraints and the lack of suitability for species (broadhurst et al. 2009) prevented such a strategy. alternatives also include increasing the number of receiving antennas to increase spatial coverage, or utilising a whole lake array (hanson et al. 2007) in future applications. trailing antennas this for the current study has shown that adult macquarie perch can move on large scales within a single diel period (at least 4 km) and that most of this move- ment is likely to occur at night. the general absence of large-scale movement by day may be related to diurnal cormorant predation (or at least the perceived risk of such predation cf. abrams et al. 1996). cor- morants were largely absent from cotter reservoir during winter in the current study period (ryan 2010), and this may explain the elevated activity of adult macquarie perch in winter relative to other sea- sons. limited winter food supply may also facilitate greater risk taking by adult macquarie perch at that time of year. if the scale of adult macquarie perch movement is mediated by habitat availability and pre- dation threat, then ensuring refuges are available at least on a size and scale approximately commensurate with those currently existing in cotter reservoir, and provides a conservative guideline for managing the upcoming expansion of this critical refuge (linter- mans 2012). knowledge of macquarie perch spatial ecology from the current study has signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced management of cotter reservoir. installation of con- structed habitats (rock reefs) to provide diurnal cover for adult macquarie perch in the enlarged cotter res- ervoir is currently underway (lintermans 2012). the extent of individual constructed reefs has been informed by the movement metrics generated in the current study. habitats have been designed to the accommodate the extent of individuals’ diurnal move- ment without unnecessarily exposing them to cormo- rant predation. similarly, spacing between constructed reefs is informed by the estimates of diel mobility and diel range, allowing individuals to move between and/or return to reefs over a diel period. the pattern of depth preference identiﬁed in the current study has also guided the placement of constructed reefs in the inundation zone of the enlarged reservoir, with allowances made for the modelled drawdown regime. the clear link between reservoir management and new knowledge of macquarie perch spatial ecol- ogy is a valuable case study of the beneﬁts of sci- ence-based management (lintermans 2012) with such approaches applicable and likely to deliver improved outcomes for the recovery of other threatened species. acknowledgements katie ryan and dan starrs assisted with data collection. parks,
