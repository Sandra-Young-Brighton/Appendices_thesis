(2002) observed that age-0 gizzard shad grew much faster in acton lake, ohio, during a year when they fed on zoo- plankton compared with years when they fed primar- ily on detritus. this year of rapid growth coincided with lower gizzard shad biomass, which apparently enabled zooplankton to persist for a longer duration. crappies pomoxis spp., which are highly popular sport fishes (hooe 1991), are especially susceptible to gape limitation because of their relatively small body and gape size (michaletz 1997b, 1998b). crappies commonly transition from a diet of inverte- brates to fish when they reach a total length (tl) of about 150 mm (ellison 1984; o’brien et al. 1984; muoneke et al. 1992). if crappies are unable to tran- sition to fish prey, or if fish prey become no longer available, they feed on less energetically profitable invertebrates and their growth often wanes (o’brien et al. 1984; heidinger et al. 1985; michaletz et al. 2012). age-0 gizzard shad commonly outgrow their vulnerability to crappie predation in some northern (michaletz 1998b,c). conse- reservoirs missouri crappies, predominately white quently, crappies p. annularis, grow slowly most years in these systems (michaletz 1998b,c; michaletz et al. 2012). the frequency of this scenario varies between a group of three reservoirs, long branch, mark twain lakes, which are located within and thomas hill fertility. 65 km of one another and have similar white crappies grow slowly every year in long branch lake, during most years in mark twain lake, and only rarely in thomas hill lake (michaletz et al. 2012; missouri department of conservation [mdc], unpublished data). as a consequence of the slow growth of crappies, few anglers pursue these species in long branch lake (michaletz, personal observa- tion). sport fishing for crappies is very popular in mark twain and thomas hill lakes most years, but anglers are dissatisfied with the sizes of crappies during some years in mark twain lake (mdc, unpublished data). because the slow growth of white crappies in these reservoirs was linked to low prey fish availability (michaletz et al. 2012), this study sought to ascertain the reasons for the differences in prey fish availability between these three reservoirs. specifically, the objectives of this study were to 1) estimate abundance, growth and mortality of age-0 environmental influences on gizzard shad gizzard shad, 2) determine differences in these parameters among the three reservoirs and 3) identify important variables influencing these parameters. attaining this knowledge may provide insights into potential management strategies directed towards improving growth of crappies in these reservoirs. materials and methods study areas (mean depth = 8.9 m) factors influencing age-0 gizzard shad were studied in long branch, mark twain and thomas hill lakes, which are located in the fertile glacial till plains physiographic section of northern missouri. these reservoirs (hereafter termed ‘lakes’) are nutrient rich and often turbid during periods of high inflow (knowlton & jones 1995; jones et al. 2008). mark twain lake is larger (surface area = 7550 ha) and deeper than long branch lake (surface area = 980 ha; mean depth = 4.4 m) and thomas hill lake (surface area = 1781 ha; mean depth = 4.9 m). mark twain and long branch lakes are operated by the u.s. army corps of engi- neers for flood control and water supply. mark twain lake is also used for hydropower generation. thomas hill lake functions as a cooling lake for a coal-fired power plant and consequently has elevated water temperatures. all three lakes thermally stratify during the summer months and hypolimnia become hypoxic. sampling age-0 gizzard shad were sampled at night with paired 1-m2 frame trawls towed in a stair-stepped fashion from the surface to 9 m deep or to near the bottom in shallow areas in long branch, mark twain and thomas hill lakes. trawling was conducted weekly throughout the larval phase (≤25 mm total length, tl; late april/early may–late june/early july) using 500-lm mesh trawls and monthly during the juvenile phase (july–october/early november) using 6-mm mesh trawls in mark twain, thomas hill and long branch lakes during 2004–2008. tow speeds were 1 ms the 500-lm mesh trawls and 1.6 ms  1 for 6-mm mesh trawls. juvenile sampling occurred during new-moon periods to reduce net avoidance (michaletz 1997a). flowmeters were placed in the mouth of the trawls to estimate the vol- ume of water filtered by each trawl. trawls were towed at six fixed sites in each of two areas (upper and lower) of each lake to account for potential spa- tial differences in gizzard shad abundance (michaletz & gale 1999). age-1 and older fishes captured by the trawls were identified, counted and immediately  1 for 323 michaletz released. larval samples were preserved in either 10% formalin or 95% ethanol (samples used for oto- lith analysis; see below); whereas, juvenile samples were placed on ice and later stored in a freezer. in some cases when juvenile trawl samples contained thousands of fish, the entire sample was weighed and only a weighed subsample was retained for process- ing. for juvenile sampling, samples from the two trawls were pooled for each tow. in the laboratory, larval samples were rinsed to remove preservative, and fish were removed from debris and zooplankton and identified, counted and measured. for samples with <100 gizzard shad, all fish were identified and counted. for samples with ≥100 gizzard shad, samples were split into as many as four subsamples with a folsom plankton splitter, and 1–3 subsamples were completely processed until at least 100 gizzard shad were counted. larval samples taken simultaneously with each of the two trawls were pooled for analysis. twenty-five indi- viduals for each fish taxa were measured for tl (nearest mm) for each fixed site, and data from the six sites in each area were pooled to estimate size structure for each area. juvenile trawl samples were thawed and all fish were identified and counted, and 200 age-0 gizzard shad were measured for tl for each area. density (number per m3) of age-0 gizzard shad was estimated for each site using count and volume-filtered data. (chl), water quality and zooplankton data were col- lected in each of the two areas (upper and lower) in mark twain, thomas hill and long branch lakes during 2004–2008. chlorophyll turbidity, secchi depth and zooplankton abundance were mea- sured at two fixed sites per area weekly from late april to late june or early july and then once every 2 weeks through october/early november. water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were measured at one fixed site per area on the same dates. chlorophyll and turbidity were quantified from depth-integrated water samples collected from the photic zone (defined to be 1.5 9 secchi depth, bremigan & stein 1999) using plastic tubing low- ered to the proper depth and retrieved in a u-shaped fashion. turbidity (nephelometric turbidity unit, ntu) was measured on site using a turbidity meter. for chl, a portion of the water sample was immediately filtered through whatman gf/c glass fibre filters. these were placed on ice and frozen upon return to the laboratory. temperature and dis- solved oxygen were measured at the surface and at 1-m intervals to a depth of 10 m or to the bottom in shallow areas using a temperature-dissolved oxy- gen meter. zooplankton were collected at each site with a single vertical tow of a conical plankton net (30 cm in diameter 9 150 cm long with 63-lm 324 mesh). tows were made from a depth of 9 m or the bottom in shallow areas to the surface. zoo- plankton were preserved in a 10% formalin solu- tion. in the laboratory, chl (lgl  1) was measured using ethanol extraction and spectrophotometry (apha 1985). zooplankton samples were processed by identifying and counting all organisms within three subsamples for each sample. zooplankton were identified as rotifers, copepod nauplii, cyclo- poid copepods, calaniod copepods, or to genus for cladocerans. density estimates (n/l) for each taxon were extrapolated for each sample using volume-fil- tered, sample and subsample volume, and count information. body lengths of 100 randomly selected individuals excluding rotifers and copepod nauplii were measured using procedures in culver et al. (1985) from the two samples pooled by area. body lengths of 10 rotifers and 10 copepod nauplii were also measured from the pooled samples. to estimate individual zooplankter weight, body lengths were converted to dry weights using equations in dumont et al. et al. and culver (1985). zooplankton biomass (lgl  1) was estimated by multiplying mean individual dry weight times density for each taxon and then summing over all taxa. (1975), rosen (1981) initially, fish ageing larval and early juvenile gizzard shad (≤35 mm tl) were aged by counting daily growth increments in sagittal otoliths. sagittal otoliths were removed from each of five fish per 5-mm-length groups from etha- nol-preserved samples for each sampling date, lake and area. otoliths were mounted on slides with ther- moplastic cement and polished as necessary to observe the innermost rings. daily growth increments were counted at 100 or 4009 magnifications under a compound microscope. two independent counts of growth increments were made for each oto- lith. if these counts differed by more than three incre- ments or 15%, then the otolith was read up to two more times until acceptance criteria were met. if after four counts the criteria were not met, the otolith was discarded. for otoliths that met the criteria, the clos- est increment counts were averaged and fish age was assumed to be the average increment count plus 3 days, given that is deposited on the fourth day after hatching (davis et al. 1985). otoliths of gizzard shad become increas- ingly difficult to age as fish grow older, and ageing bias becomes a serious problem for older fish (michaletz 1997a); consequently, otoliths were not removed from age-0 gizzard shad after late june or early july. the first growth increment larval cohort hatch distributions, growth and mortality hatch distributions, growth and mortality were deter- mined for weekly cohorts of larval gizzard shad for each area (lower and upper) of each lake and year. all aged fish were assigned to weekly cohorts based on their estimated hatch date. hatch dates were deter- mined by subtracting the age of the fish from the date of capture (day of year). a cohort-length key (similar to an age-length key) was developed, so that all cap- tured larvae and young juveniles could be assigned to a weekly cohort for each sampling date. these data coupled with length frequencies and total density estimates provided density estimates for each cohort for each sampling date. in some cases, no aged fish were available for a particular length group that was present for fish in the formalin-preserved trawl sam- ples either due to poorly preserved samples or by chance that the ethanol-preserved samples did not contain all of the length groups that other samples had. in these cases, the appropriate cohort or cohorts were assigned to that length group based on age and growth information predicted for these cohorts or for adjacent cohorts. only data missing for the <5-, 5–9- and 10–14-mm tl groups were assigned cohorts in this way because it was more difficult to assign cohorts to larger tl groups because of more variable growth rates. weekly, hatch distributions were esti- mated using the peak density (for fish <15 mm tl) of each weekly cohort. although some larvae as small as 3–4 mm tl were collected, larvae were not fully recruited to the sampling gear until they were about 6–10 mm tl. thus, cohorts that experienced high mortality shortly after hatch may have been underrepresented in the hatch distributions. growth was modelled for weekly cohorts for which there were at least 10 aged fish that spanned a length range of >15 mm tl. three growth models were compared for each cohort: the von bertalanffy (lt = l∞[1 – exp{-k(t – t0)}]), gompertz (lt = l∞[exp {-exp(b–dt)}]) and linear model (lt = a + bt), where lt is the tl of fish at t days of age, l∞ is the theoreti- cal asymptotic tl at end of the larval phase, t0 is the theoretical tl at 0 days of age, a is the intercept, and k, b, d and b are growth coefficients. the von bertalanffy and gompertz models were fit to length- at-age data using nonlinear regression (procedure nlin; sas institute, cary, nc, usa), while linear models were fit using simple linear regression (proce- dure reg; sas institute, cary, nc, usa). growth models were compared for each cohort using the information-theoretic approach (burnham & ander- son 2002) and akaike’s information criterion cor- rected for small sample size (aicc). the model with the lowest aicc was considered the best model and was used to model growth for that cohort (but see environmental influences on gizzard shad some exceptions in results). using these models, tl at ages 7 (tl7), 14 (tl14), 21 (tl21) and 28 (tl28) days was predicted for each cohort. only cohorts that included aged fish that were smaller or equal to the predicted tl at 7 days and were equal to or larger than the predicted tl at 28 days were used to avoid extrapolations outside of the observed data ranges. average daily growth rate (mmday  1) was estimated for each of these periods (i.e., 7, 14, 21 and 28 days) by subtracting 3.5 mm from the tl at each age to account for tl at hatch (tin 1982) and dividing the difference by the age in days. for the average daily growth rate (gr) for example, 28-day-old by gr28 = (tl28 – 3.5)/28. growth rates for 7-day- (gr7), 14-day- (gr14) and 21-day (gr21)-old fish were calculated in a similar fashion. although daily growth rate varied over time for cohorts exhibiting nonlinear growth, calculating an average growth rate for a period enabled comparison of growth rates among cohorts that exhibited either linear or nonlin- ear growth. a nested analysis of variance (anova) was used to compare loge-transformed gr among lake areas. for the anova, area was nested within lake. for a significant anova (p ≤ 0.05), differences between lake areas were determined with pairwise comparisons of least-square means using bonferroni- adjusted p-values for multiple comparisons. (gr28) was determined fish instantaneous daily mortality rate (zd) was deter- mined for larval cohorts using catch curves. the slope of the regression of loge (density) versus day of year was used to estimate zd. only data from the descending limb of the curve were used, and only cohorts that were used for growth analysis were con- sidered, so that zd was estimated for most of the lar- val phase and was comparable among cohorts. other cohorts did not have a sufficient range of ages for estimating zd. because relatively few data points were used to estimate zd, a p-value of 0.10 was con- sidered significant for the regression equations. dif- ferences in zd between lake areas were assessed with a nested anova, followed by comparisons of least- square means using bonferroni-adjusted p-values if the anova was significant. environmental variables were used to explain vari- ation in growth and mortality of larval cohorts using multiple linear regressions. four explanatory vari- ables were considered in these models, available zoo- plankton abundance (either density or biomass), surface water temperature, turbidity and age-0 gizzard shad density. additionally, growth rate was consid- ered as an explanatory variable for zd. secchi depth was not included as a potential explanatory variable in larval and juvenile (see below) analyses because it was (secchi depth = 2.43 9 ntu r2 = 0.92; turbidity  0.542; n = 1240; strongly related to 325 michaletz prey on that zooplankton small-bodied from available p < 0.0001) and had a much narrower range of val- ues. larval gizzard shad are gape-limited zooplankti- vores zooplankton (bremigan & stein 1994; devries et al. 1998; michaletz 1998a). thus, available zooplankton prey was determined by calculating the density and bio- mass of zooplankton that were smaller than the gape of each larval gizzard shad cohort for each sampling week. gape size was estimated for each cohort from the predicted tl at age data coupled with an equation that related gape size to tl (weiss lake 1990 model; armstrong et al. 1998). calanoid copepods were excluded estimates because they are frequently uncommon in diets of larval gizzard shad (bremigan & stein 1994, 1997; michaletz 1998a; but see welker et al. 1994; arm- strong et al. 1998). water temperature strongly influ- ences hatch distribution and growth of fishes (rice et al. 1987; pepin 1991; betsill & van den avyle 1997; michaletz 1997a), and surface temperatures were used because larval gizzard shad inhabited water near or at the surface. turbidity can have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of planktivorous fishes, such as larval gizzard shad, that visually locate their prey (see reviews in utne- palm 2002; pangle et al. 2012). however, at extre- mely high levels of turbidity, both growth and sur- vival of fishes are compromised (newcombe & macdonald 1991). growth of gizzard shad is often density dependent (garvey & stein 1998; dettmers & wahl 1999; michaletz 1999), so age-0 gizzard shad density was included as a potential explanatory variable. especially for fishes, mortality is often related to growth; faster-growing fish com- monly experience lower mortality rates (rice et al. 1987, 1993; betsill & van den avyle 1997). for growth models, explanatory variables were averaged over for growth during the first 28 days of life, values of explanatory variables measured at approximately 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of life for each cohort were averaged. for mortality models, values of explanatory variables were averaged over the first 28 days of life. thus, values of these explanatory variables were identical to those used to explain variation in growth over the first 28 days of life. growth rate over the first 28 days of life was also included as a potential explanatory variable in mortality models. this 28-day period covers most or all of the larval phase (see results). prior to analysis, all dependent and explana- tory variables were loge-transformed to meet assump- tions of linear regression except for zd which was normally distributed. the entire growth period. for example, larval regression models explaining variation in growth and survival among larval cohorts among all lake areas and years were compared using aicc. models 326 including all possible combinations of explanatory variables were considered except that models were restricted to include only one zooplankton abundance variable (either density or biomass), because these r > 0.47; variables were highly correlated (all p < 0.002), and a maximum of four explanatory vari- ables to avoid over-fitting the models. models with aicc values that were within two units of the most parsimonious model were considered to have substan- tial support (burnham & anderson 2002). supported models were checked for multicollinearity using the diagnostics tools in proc reg (options vif, tol and collinoint; sas institute, cary, nc, usa). to determine whether values for important environ- mental variables that explained variation in growth or mortality in the regression models differed between lake areas, nested anova s were conducted followed by comparisons of least-square means using bonfer- roni-adjusted p-values for significant anova. loge- transformed mean values for the first 28 days of life for each cohort were used in the anova. juvenile growth and mortality clearly curves were as daily ages for most juveniles were not determined, growth and mortality rates were estimated for all cap- tured age-0 gizzard shad (not weekly cohort specific). growth was modelled using von bertalanffy growth curves using the mean tl of age-0 gizzard shad col- lected from mid-june to late october/early november for each area within a lake. preliminary analysis revealed that the von bertalanffy model was more appropriate than the linear or gompertz models. growth nonlinear, which excluded the linear model, and the gompertz model failed to converge in many cases when using nonlin- ear regression (procedure nlin, sas institute). instantaneous daily mortality was estimated from catch curves using loge-transformed mean densities during the same period as for growth. samples col- lected in mid-to-late june contained both late larvae and early juveniles and provided the best estimate of densities entering the juvenile stage. average growth rate (mmday  1) was computed by subtracting the predicted tl on day of year 180 from the predicted tl on day 290 and dividing this difference by 110 (the number of days in the period). mean tl on days 180 and 290 was predicted from the von bertalanffy growth curves. differences in growth rate (loge-trans- formed) and zd (untransformed) between lake areas were assessed using a nested anova. for significant anova, differences among means were determined using using bonferroni- adjusted p-values. comparisons pairwise multiple linear regression was used to explain vari- ation in both growth rate (loge-transformed) and zd among lake areas and years using mid-june to late october/early november loge-transformed mean val- ues of zooplankton abundance (density and biomass), surface water temperature, chl, turbidity and med- ian values for age-0 gizzard shad density. median values for age-0 gizzard shad density were used instead of mean values because mean values were highly influenced by high densities early in the juve- nile period that were not representative of the entire juvenile period. for zd models, juvenile growth rate was included as a potential explanatory variable because growth rate can influence mortality (miller et al. 1988; rice et al. 1993). zooplankton abun- dance included all sizes of these prey excluding cala- noid copepods because juvenile gizzard shad were capable of eating all sizes of existing zooplankton prey. calanoid copepods were excluded from zoo- plankton biomass estimates because they can escape the pump filter juvenile gizzard shad feeding of environmental influences on gizzard shad gizzard shad consume (drenner et al. 1978). in addition to zooplankton, juvenile phytoplankton (indexed by chl) and detritus (yako et al. 1996; michaletz 1998a; kim et al. 2007). turbidity is an indirect measure of suspended solids, which can be potentially consumed by filter-feeding juvenile giz- zard shad. surface water temperatures were used because similar to larvae, juvenile gizzard shad were often present at or near the water surface. models were constructed, compared and checked for multi- collinearity using the same procedures as for the lar- val models. to determine whether values for important environmental variables that explained var- iation in growth or mortality in the regression models differed among lake areas, nested anova s were con- ducted followed by pairwise comparisons of means using bonferroni-adjusted p-values for significant anova. loge-transformed mean values were used in the anova.  3,

thomas hill lake (fig. 1). densities usually peaked in upper areas of the lakes before they peaked in lower areas, and densities were typically greater in upper areas. peaks in density were mostly unimodal, but bimodal distributions occurred in a few instances. overall, peak densities were greatest in thomas hill lake and least in mark twain lake. however, peak densities were annually variable within a lake with three- to fourfold differences occurring among years. cohort hatch distribution hatch distribution of weekly cohorts varied among lake areas and years with most hatching occurring over a 6- to 10-week period (fig. 2). hatching began earlier in thomas hill lake (early to mid-april) than in long branch and mark twain lakes (late april to early may) probably because of warmer water tem- peratures. within a lake, hatching usually began ear- lier in the upper area than in the lower area, and initial densities of the cohorts were typically greater in the upper areas. most cohorts were produced when water temperatures were between 16 °c and 26 °c. initial densities of cohorts were greatest in thomas hill lake and least in mark twain lake. usually, only 2–4 strong cohorts were evident for each lake area and year. water levels were relatively stable throughout the hatching period. larval growth and mortality examination of age tl plots and comparisons of growth models revealed that some larval cohorts exhibited linear growth while others exhibited nonlin- ear growth. of the 143 weekly cohorts for which growth was modelled, the linear model was best for 70 cohorts, followed by the gompertz model for 44 cohorts and the von bertalanffy model for 29 cohorts. when the von bertalanffy model was the best model, aicc values for the gompertz model were within two units of the von bertalanffy model in all but three cases. aicc values for the gompertz model for the three exceptions were within 2.6 units of the values for the von bertalanffy model. to

for each weekly cohort. all growth models were highly significant (p < 0.0001). daily growth rates of larval cohorts averaged 0.44 mmday  1 for gr7 (range, 0.05–1.07 mmday  1), 0.63 mmday  1 for

for 7-day-old larvae, growth rates were slower in thomas hill lake than in long branch and mark twain lakes (table 1). for 7-day-old fish, gr7 did not differ between thomas hill lake and long branch lake. growth rates were similar between long branch and mark twain lakes. growth rates between areas within a lake were also similar. growth rates of larvae were influenced by zoo- plankton biomass,

was included with a positive coefficient in some models, but always explained the least amount of variation in growth rate. models explained about 50% of the variation in growth rate except for the gr7 model, which was weaker. slower growth of larvae in thomas hill lake appeared to be associated with lower zooplankton biomass coupled with high densities of age-0 gizzard shad in comparison with

the lower area of thomas hill lake than in the lower area of long branch lake and the upper area of mark twain lake (table 4). models containing environmental and larval growth rate variables explained <14% of the variation in zd (table 5). counter intuitively, when larval growth was included in the models, it was pos- itively associated with zd, indicating that faster-grow- ing larvae experienced higher mortality. however, temperature, which was positively related to growth of larvae, was negatively associated with zd as expected. also, gizzard shad density, which was neg- atively related to growth, was positively associated with zd. turbidity was included in two models and was positively associated with zd. given the small amount of variation in zd accounted for by grow rate alone (<10%), the true relationships between growth rate and zd are uncertain. juvenile growth and mortality growth of juveniles was fastest in early summer, but usually slowed through late summer and

significantly different between areas within a lake. a variety of variables were included in models explaining growth of juvenile gizzard shad (table 2). juvenile growth was negatively associated with tem- perature and age-0 gizzard shad density and posi- tively associated with potential food abundance (chl, zooplankton biomass, turbidity). the models explained more than 66% of the variation in growth. although all anova s were significant (p < 0.02), few differences in environmental variables were found between the lake areas (table 3). perhaps, a combination of high temperatures, high age-0 gizzard shad densities and relatively low food abundance (chl and zooplankton biomass) resulted in the slower growth of juveniles in thomas hill lake. instantaneous mortality rates for juvenile gizzard shad averaged 0.021 (range, 0.002–0.058) among lake areas and years. however, one-half of zd values were not significantly different from zero (p > 0.10). 330 table 4. comparisons of

was generally statistically similar areas (table 4). three variables were included in models explaining variation in zd (table 5). all models included juvenile density either by itself or paired with either juvenile growth rate or zooplankton bio- mass. mortality was negatively associated with juve- nile density and positively associated with juvenile growth rate and zooplankton biomass. however, vari- ables other than juvenile density explained <4% of additional variance in zd. an additional analysis was conducted, which included only zd values with an associated p ≤ 0.10. this analysis also indicated that environmental influences on gizzard shad bremigan & stein 1999). water-level changes can affect the temporal distribution of spawning and ini- tial cohort strength (kohler et al. 1993; michaletz 1997a). however, water levels changed little during the spawning season of gizzard shad during the study period and consequently did not appear to influence hatch distributions. growth of larvae increased with increasing water temperature and zooplankton abundance, which is consistent with findings of other studies (e.g., welker et al. 1994; betsill & van den avyle 1997; micha- letz 1997a). conversely, as reported by others (wel- ker et al. 1994; garvey & stein 1998), growth of larvae was slower when their densities were high, possibly due to intraspecific competition. larval growth was probably slower in thomas hill lake than in long branch and mark twain lakes because of greater densities of larvae and lower available zoo- plankton biomass. although turbidity can hamper for- aging by larval clupeids (kashuba & matthews 1984; matthews 1984), turbidity had positive coefficients in growth models of larvae, but was relatively unimpor- tant in explaining variation in growth. this was somewhat surprising given that turbidities occasion- ally exceeded 100 ntu during the larval period. growth was like larvae, greater food abundance enhanced growth of juveniles and greater densities of conspecif- ics slowed growth. however, unlike for larvae, juve- nile slower with warmer water temperatures. juveniles are omnivorous and consume zooplankton, phytoplankton and detritus (yako et al. 1996), all of which were positively related to growth. inclusion of zooplankton in diets appears to especially enhance growth of juveniles compared with those feeding mostly on detritus (mundahl & wissing 1987; schaus et al. 2002; kim et al. 2007). density-depen- dent growth has been commonly observed for juvenile gizzard shad (michaletz 1997a, 1999; dettmers & wahl 1999; schaus et al. 2002; kim et al. 2007) maybe because at high densities, juveniles depress zooplankton abundance and are forced to feed on less energetically profitable phytoplankton and detritus (schaus relationship between water temperature and growth of juveniles was unexpected, although welker et al. (1994) observed a negative correlation between these vari- ables in lake shelbyville, illinois. conceivably, mid- summer temperatures reached suboptimal levels for growth of juveniles. optimal and maximum tempera- tures for consumption by gizzard shad were estimated to be 25 °c and 32.4 °c, respectively (sebring 2002). pierce et al. (1980) observed mid-summer declines in body caloric content and lipids in age-0 gizzard shad elevated metabolic demand and suggested that (26–28 °c) induced by high water temperatures exceeded food energy intake. water temperatures et al. 2002). the negative 331 fig. 3. mean (se) total length (mm) and associated von berta- lanffy growth curves for age-0 gizzard shad from mid-june to late october/early november of 2004 (triangle), 2005 (upside down triangle), 2006 (circle), 2007 (square) and 2008 (diamond) in lower (open symbols) and upper (filled symbols) of long branch, mark twain and thomas hill lakes. juvenile density was the most influential variable in explaining variation in zd. discussion water temperature, food abundance and conspecific density were important influences on population dynamics of age-0 gizzard shad. water warmed ear- lier in the spring in thomas hill lake than in the other two lakes due to thermal effluent from a power plant, and consequently, hatching commenced about 2–3 weeks earlier in this lake. water also warmed more quickly in the shallower waters of the upper areas of each lake that led to earlier hatching in upper areas than in lower areas most years. most larvae hatched when surface water temperatures were between 16 °c and 26 °c, similar to findings of previous studies (bodola 1966; shelton et al. 1982; michaletz frequently exceeded 25 °c during summer, especially in thomas hill lake where juvenile gizzard shad experienced mean temperatures exceeding 26 °c (see table 3). slower growth of juveniles in thomas hill lake compared with the other two lakes was probably a consequence of higher water temperatures and gen- erally greater juvenile densities relative to available food (zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass). con- versely, food abundance was relatively high compared with juvenile densities in long branch lake where juveniles experienced the fastest growth. environmental variables usually explained little of the variation in zd among larval cohorts. temperature and zooplankton biomass, which were positive influ- ences on growth, were negatively associated with zd, consistent with the hypothesis that faster-growing lar- vae should experience lower mortality (miller et al. 1988; rice et al. 1993). also, density of conspecifics, which negatively influenced growth, was positively related to zd. contradictorily, growth rate of larvae was positively related to zd, although growth rate alone explained <10% of the variation in zd. others have also failed to document faster growth improved survival of larvae (e.g., bunnell et al. 2003; overton et al. 2012). estimating zd for larval cohorts in the field is inherently difficult, and gear avoidance by larger larvae could have caused this unexpected result (pepin 1993; betsill & van den avyle 1997). additionally, in this study zd could only be estimated for the most abundant cohorts that were collected over several sampling dates. thus, zd was undoubtedly much higher for cohorts that experienced nearly com- plete mortality early in life. mortality rates of cohorts that survived the larval stage were within the range of estimates previously reported for clupeids (crecco et al. 1983; michaletz 1997a; overton et al. 2012) and were mostly similar among the three study lakes. that explanatory variables explained more of the varia- tion in juvenile mortality than for larvae, but only one variable, age-0 gizzard shad density, explained most of the variation. age-0 gizzard shad density was negatively associated with zd. this was the opposite relationship to what was observed for larvae. for juveniles, the negative relationship between age- 0 gizzard shad density and zd was probably because juvenile period were higher median densities for associated with more juveniles being collected throughout this period, corresponding to a lower zd. as for larvae, estimating zd for juveniles is difficult because of patchy distributions and weather-related gear avoidance. many estimates of zd were nonsignificant owing to either very low mortal- ity or highly variable abundance estimates. estimates of zd for juveniles were about an order of magnitude lower than for larvae and similar to (crecco et al. 1983; deegan 1990; michaletz 1997a) or somewhat and size- 332 lower (hoffman & olney 2005) than previous esti- mates for juvenile clupeids. despite differences in densities of age-0 gizzard shad and environmental conditions between lower and upper areas within the reservoirs, growth and mortality rates for larval and juvenile gizzard shad were similar between these areas. densities of age-0 gizzard shad were frequently greater in the upper area than in the lower area within a reservoir, which is a common observation for reservoir ecosystems (siler et al. 1986; bremigan & stein 1999; micha- letz & gale 1999). upper areas of reservoirs support greater densities of gizzard shad because these areas are more productive owing to greater nutrient con- centrations and plankton densities (siler et al. 1986; thornton et al. 1990; bremigan & stein 1999; this study). upper areas also warm more quickly than lower areas in the spring because of their shallower depths and because they receive inflows of warmer water. similar growth and mortality rates of age-0 gizzard shad between these areas that greater food abundance in upper areas usually com- pensated for the greater densities of age-0 gizzard shad. alternatively, movement of age-0 gizzard shad between lower and upper areas could have masked differences in growth and mortality between areas. it larvae occurred between the two areas because larvae have poor swimming abilities and upper and lower areas were separated by >2.4 km. mixing of juveniles between lower and upper areas was more likely in long branch and thomas hill lakes than in mark twain lake where upper and lower areas were separated by >10 km. whether mixing of fish occurred between the areas remains unknown. that mixing of is doubtful suggest results from this study provide insights into why white crappies usually grew faster in thomas hill lake than in long branch and mark twain lakes. white crappies must continue to feed on prey fish throughout most of the growing season to maintain satisfactory growth (michaletz et al. 2012). in these reservoirs, age-0 gizzard shad are the main prey fish for white crappies, and when these prey fish are unavailable, white crappies switch to less energy-rich prey such as invertebrates and their growth rates decline (michaletz et al. 2012). age-0 gizzard shad remained available as prey for white crappies in tho- mas hill lake for most or all of the growing season, whereas, they commonly outgrew their vulnerability to white crappie predation in long branch and mark twain lakes (michaletz et al. 2012). because of war- mer spring temperatures, age-0 gizzard shad hatched earlier in thomas hill lake and thereby provided suitable-size prey for white crappies earlier in the year than in the other two lakes. age-0 gizzard shad were usually more abundant and grew slower in tho- mas hill lake than in the other lakes, which provided more abundant prey for white crappies. it is unclear why age-0 abundance was greater in thomas hill lake. initial cohort densities were greater in this lake apparently owing to either greater egg deposition and/or more favourable conditions for survival of eggs and young larvae. growth rates of juvenile gizzard shad in mark twain lake were intermediate to those in long branch and thomas hill lakes. in some years, juveniles grew at rates comparable to those in long branch, while in other years, growth was more similar to those in tho- mas hill lake. growth rates of white crappies were also variable in mark twain lake, apparently as a con- sequence of varying prey fish availability (michaletz et al. 2012). mark twain lake appears to be a more dynamic ecosystem than the other two lakes, conceiv- ably because it has a much larger watershed and greater water-level fluctuations. its water levels fluctuated by more than 12 m compared with <5 m for long branch and thomas hill lakes during the study period. large inflows from its primarily agricultural watershed imports high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that strongly affect nutrient and plankton dynamics within the reservoir (knowlton & jones 1995), which in turn influence population dynamics of gizzard shad (vanni et al. 2005). that require managing gizzard shad populations to ensure ade- quate abundances of suitable-size prey for sport fishes is a challenging and difficult task. many variables influence gizzard shad population dynamics are beyond the control of managers. it is fortuitous that conditions in thomas hill lake are usually favourable for producing abundant, suitable- sized prey for crappies and other sport fishes. how- ever, that is not the case for long branch lake or for most years in mark twain lake. vanni et al. (2005) suggested that managing gizzard shad populations will implementing practices within the watershed to reduce nutrient and sediment loads into the reservoir possibly in combination with stocking additional piscivores capable of effectively preying on gizzard shad. while difficult, improving land-use practices within the watershed may be the most effec- tive approach to managing reservoir gizzard shad populations. the study reservoirs, and others in northern missouri, receive large quantities of nutri- ents and sediments from their agricultural watersheds leading to rapid growth of juvenile gizzard shad. growth rates of juveniles are slower in reservoirs in southern missouri (michaletz 1997a, 1998c, 1999), where watersheds contain less cropland and conse- quently, reservoirs receive less nutrients and sedi- ments (jones et al. 2004). stocking of additional piscivores such as hybrid striped bass (striped bass morone saxatilis x white bass m. chrysops) has been environmental influences on gizzard shad used to manage abundant gizzard shad populations and to create additional fisheries (jahn et al. 1987; ebert et al. 1988; ostrand et al. 2002). these pisci- vore stockings combined with watershed manage- ment may be the most effective way to manipulate gizzard shad populations to produce suitable-sized prey for piscivorous sport fishes. acknowledgements i
