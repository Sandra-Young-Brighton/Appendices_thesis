abiotic factors; juvenile; salmo_trutta; survival; growth introduction density-dependent demographic processes contribute to the regulation of natural populations of a wide range of invertebrate, vertebrate and plant species (brook & bradshaw 2006). stream-dwelling salmo- nids are relevant biological models to study such processes because they inhabit a variety of streams, where they compete for territory via interference and/or for food via exploitative competition (keeley 2001). density-dependent processes in wild salmonid populations have been extensively studied (e.g., grant & kramer 1990; crisp 1993; elliott 1994) and may be expressed either by mortality, dispersal or an impaired growth rate. whether one of these modes of the others primarily depends on the ontogenetic stage and population density. regulation prevails over density-dependent effects on individual survival have been reported at early life stages from emer- gence to 30–70 days postemergence when young-of- the-year food and to compete for (yoy) start correspondence: alexandre richard, hepia, geneva technology, architecture and landscape, earth-nature-environment institute, university of applied sciences western switzerland, route de presinge 150, 1254 jussy (ge), switzerland. e-mail: alexandre.richard@hesge.ch doi: 10.1111/eff.12116 1 richard et al. territory (e.g., elliott 1994; jonsson et al. 1998; ei- num & nislow 2005). thereafter, as fish grow and increase their fat reserves, survival remains relatively constant and density-independent (elliott 1985), at least during the first year. meanwhile, yoy dispersal abilities increase with size, and some fish (presum- ably in poorer condition and/or hierarchically subor- dinate individuals) tend to move from high density to low-density patches (crisp 1993; einum et al. 2006). a high fish density may also involve per capita food limitation. this limitation results in a decrease in growth rate (commonly expressed by mean weight, length, or instantaneous growth rate) that is generally observed at the end of the growing season of 0+ fish (grant & imre 2005). the relationship between growth and density has been investigated both in well-designed experimental studies in artificial chan- nels (jenkins et al. 1999; keeley 2001) and in situ, by means of medium- to long-term (i.e., from eight to 14 cohorts) monitoring of natural populations (atlantic salmon salmo_salar l., imre et al. 2005, 2010; brown_trout, lobon-cervia 2005; marble trout salmo_marmoratus cuvier, 1829, vincenzi et al. 2007). most often, growth–density relationships were best fitted by negative power curves; this implies that density dependence is best observed at low densities, even though lobon-cervia (2007a) concluded that this process operated both at high and low densities. in a meta-analysis of 16 different studies on six spe- cies of resident salmonids, grant & imre (2005) pre- sented evidence for a density-dependent growth in 75% of the referred populations. the inability to relate growth to density could be either due to a nar- row density range or to the observed high mean den- sity for which density-dependent effects become negligible (jenkins et al. 1999; lobon-cervia 2007a). according to the site profitability hypothesis, as density increases, the number of slow-growing fish also increases because the best feeding sites are already occupied, thus relegating additional individu- als to lower quality sites (newman 1993). conse- quently, a higher coefficient of variation in size (cv) should be observed with increasing density. the size variation around the mean has been positively related to the yoy cohort strength in brown_trout popula- tions (newman 1993; jenkins et al. 1999; nordwall et al. 2001; lobon-cervia 2010). conversely, imre et al. (2010) did not observe a significant effect of atlantic salmon density on size variation expressed by the standard deviation. mean size and size varia- tion are site-specific and depend on several factors (e.g., interspe- cific competition), other than intraspecific relation- ships only. therefore, multiple years of monitoring data on multiple sites displaying a large span of densities may help elucidate the biotic and abiotic temperature, flow, food abundance, 2 factors that govern the observed inter-annual growth variations. the relative importance of abiotic factors on juve- nile salmonid survival and growth, such as tempera- ture (e.g., elliott & elliott 1995; jensen et al. 2000; logez & pont 2011), flow (e.g., cattaneo et al. 2002; unfer et al. 2011; nislow & armstrong 2012), habi- tat availability (armstrong et al. 2003) or a combina- tion of these factors (clews et al. 2010), has been intensively investigated. several studies focused on the joint effects of fish density and temperature (cro- zier et al. 2010; bal et al. 2011; parra et al. 2012; bærum et al. 2013) or densities and flow (lobon- cervia 2004; lobon-cervia 2007b; teichert et al. 2010; cunjak et al. 2013), but only a few have addressed the combined effects of cohort densities (intra- and intercohort relationships) and environmen- tal features (temperature and flow; but see carline 2006; vøllestad & olsen 2008; grossman et al. 2010, 2012). is crucial factors (including interactions) the concurrent analysis of biotic and environmen- tal for improving our understanding of the processes influ- encing population changes in space and time (milner et al. 2003). more precisely, the juvenile stage (i.e., first two years of life) is of major interest for popula- tion dynamics, because it corresponds to highly vari- able cohort densities and to a potential population bottleneck. while long-term series are required to improve our knowledge of regulatory processes (bio- tic or abiotic), uncertainties in population estimates should also be considered to improve the robustness of models (milner et al. 2003). in this study, we aimed to unravel the factors gov- erning the dynamics of a resident brown_trout popula- tion during the juvenile stage. based on 12 years of monitoring in 11 river reaches, we evaluated the respective effects of density-dependent and density- independent (temperature and flow) processes on ‘apparent survival’ (recapture of live individuals in the capture site), mean size and size distribution of juvenile brown_trout from their first summer (yoy, 0+) until the end of their second year (yearlings, 1+ fish). we tested with simulation analysis whether the observation of density dependence on apparent sur- vival was robust to sampling error. materials and methods study reaches and survey the boiron river is a 13.4-km-long tributary of the north edge of lake geneva in switzerland (46°29′ 29″n and 6°28′47″w at the outlet). the river origi- nates in the foothills of the jura mountains from the drainage of the old marshes, at an altitude ranging biotic and abiotic regulation of a low-density brown_trout population between 665 and 372 msl. the interannual mean flow (i.e., mean across years of annual mean daily flows) is 0.27 m3s  1. most of the watershed (catchment area = 31.6 km2) is covered by cultivated fields, mainly cereals, meadows and vineyards. only three fish taxa thrive in the boiron: brown_trout, european bullhead (cottus gobio l.) and min- now (phoxinus phoxinus l.). some indigenous cray- fish (austropotamobius pallipes lereboullet 1858) have colonised the upper reaches. at the river outlet, the species richness locally increases up to 10 species due to the presence of lake geneva. although barri- ers to migration have been progressively restored and equipped with fish passes, an impassable waterfall (fig. 1) still impedes anadromous brown_trout migra- tion from the lake. the population freely fluctuates, as no supplemental stocking has been carried out in the last 12 years. age at maturity is generally 2 years for males and 3 years for females; lifespan rarely exceeds 5 years. angling is allowed, but brown_trout harvesting has been moderate as reported by angler catch records (approx. 200 captures/year throughout the river). nine reaches (bo1 to bo9 from up to down- stream) were studied along the mainstem (fig. 1) and conditions least and mesohabitat two in the major tributaries: lecherres (le1) and boironnet (bt1). each studied reach was representa- tive of a homogeneous river section regarding mean slope (malavoi & souchon 2002). reaches bo1 to bo7 were located in the river section harbouring resident trout only. reaches bo8 and bo9 were located downstream of the impassable waterfall, where both resident and migratory individuals may spawn. reach lengths ranged between 47 and 91 m (mean  sd length = 65  12 m), and the wetted width at the median interannual flow ranged between 1.0 and 4.3 m (mean  sd width = 2.7  1.2 m). the length/mean width ratio exceeded 13 in all reaches and included at sequences (keller & melhorn 1978). habitat measurements were performed in the spring and autumn 2009 in eight of 11 reaches (all except bo3, le1 and bt1) following the simplified instream habitat model described by lamouroux & capra (2002). output curves linking habitat value (hv, ranging between 0 and 1) and flow for juvenile brown_trout (0+ and 1+) exhibited similar shapes and similar hv at median flow (q50) between reaches (range = 0.44–0.55; mean = 0.50; unpublished data). we therefore concluded that habitat two riffle-pool fig. 1. location of study reaches. 3 richard et al. availability for little differed between reaches and decided not to include this variable in the analyses. juveniles the data from four brown_trout monitoring started in november 2001. all 11 reaches were electrofished twice a year (july and november) until november 2012 following a two-run-removal method. as a severe organic pollu- tion occurred in august 2011 in the downstream sec- tion, reaches (bo6 to bo9) collected after july 2011 were subsequently removed from analyses. therefore, a total of 121 year-classes were monitored. captured fish were first anaesthe- tised with 10% clove oil (3 ml in 10 l of water), then dissolved in ethanol at a ratio of 1:10, measured length in mm) and weighed (precision =  (total 0.1 g; from july 2008). scales were collected from a subsample of fish (n = 5276 fish from 15,138 cap- tures). by combining scalimetry and length-frequency histogram analyses, each individual was assigned to one of the following age classes: young-of-the-year (0+), juveniles (1+) or adults (>1+). trout densities (individuals per 100 m2 [95% ci]) were assessed per reach and age class following the carle & strub (1978) method. the following three ontogenetic stages were considered when analysing regulatory processes: first summer (0+ from july to november in year n), first winter (0+ from november in year n to july in year n + 1) and second summer (1+ from july to november in year n + 1). because of the interval between sampling occasions (4 summer months and 8 winter months), the winter period also covered part of the previous autumn and the follow- ing spring. temperature and flow data environmental data were analysed over two periods corresponding to the above-defined stages: from 1st july to 1st november of year n (summer period, for both 0+ and 1+) and from 1st november of year (n 1) to 1st july of year n (winter period). water temperature records were initiated in november 2004 at two locations (reaches le1 and bo2). in 2008, all 11 reaches were equipped with a temperature logger (hobo water temp pro v2 data logger, onset), except bo6 and bo7, which shared the same sensor. water temperature was recorded every 10 min with a precision of 0.2 °c at 25 °c. missing data (2001– 2008) were back-calculated for each study reach from daily mean air temperatures collected at the nearby meteoswiss (federal office of meteorology and cli- matology) station of changins (long: 6°14′; lat: 46°24′; 455 m.a.s.l.) using ordinary least-square lin- ear regressions. all correlation coefficients between mean daily air and water temperatures were high (mean r2 = 0.91, range = 0.87–0.94), although a 4 lower value was obtained on the reach le1 (r2 = 0.71), which is located in a secondary spring. nine variables were computed for each reach and each period from the mean daily temperature data: the maximum (tmax), minimum (tmin), mean (tmean), and median temperature (t50), the tempera- ture variance (tvar), the temperature corresponding to the 90th (t90) and 10th (t10) percentiles, the number interannual t90 (n < t90), and the number of days above the inter- annual t10 (n > t10). bellow the days of flow data a gauging station located 300 m upstream of the bo- iron outlet has been recording flow every 10 min since 2009. during 2001–2009, a nearby gauged river (morges) displaying a similar watershed area (31.6 km2 for boiron; 35.6 km2 for morges) and col- lecting the same rainfall amount was used as a proxy to assess daily mean flow values (b. cordey, hydrol- ogist, general directorate for environment of the vaud canton, personal communication). daily mean flows of the two rivers were highly correlated between 2009 and 2012 (qboiron = 1.011 * qmorges; r2 = 0.976; n = 1249), thus allowing a reliable back-calculation of the flow on the boiron during 2001–2009. nine hydrological variables were calcu- lated for each period from daily mean flow data: the maximum (qmax), minimum (qmin), mean (qmean), and median flow (q50), the flow variance (qvar), the flow corresponding to the 90th (q90) and 10th (q10) percentiles, the number of days below the interannual q90 (n < q90), and the number of days above the interannual q10 (n > q10). statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using r (r development core team. 2012). normalised princi- pal components (pca) analyses were implemented separately on flow and temperature variables to syn- thesise the information on a small number of inde- pendent components. analyses were performed during the summer period and the winter period. flow and temperature data were first (loge + 1) trans- formed to approach normality. projections of the sample’s (year x reach) scores on the two-first pca axes were used as synthetic explanatory variables (namely, q1 and q2 for flow; t1 and t2 for tempera- ture). the densities were (loge + 1) transformed to approach normality. apparent survivals were calcu- lated as the (loge + 1) ratios between the final and initial densities for each life stage: first summer (ssum0+), first winter (swin0+) and second summer biotic and abiotic regulation of a low-density brown_trout population (ssum1+). the mean total length (lnov0+, ljul1+, lnov1+) and coefficient of variation (cvnov0+, cvjul1+, cvnov1+) for the length (i.e., the ratio between the standard deviation and arithmetic mean length) were also calculated at the end of each period and were (loge + 1) transformed in order to approach normal- ity. only samples with >3 fish were analysed. appar- ent survival values >150% (which could presumably occur as a result of immigration, in particular under low initial year-class density) were considered as out- liers and were removed from survival analyses (zorn & nuhfer 2007). because two reaches (bo8 and bo9) were located in the downstream section acces- sible to migratory trout, all apparent survival analyses were performed with and without the two reaches. because the results were unchanged, the two reaches were included in all analyses. of significant 2003) was used to display the interactive effect. the effect package (fox interactions, for analysing the apparent survival, the effect of density estimate uncertainty (due to a capture proba- bility <1) on model robustness was tested using resampling. resampling (10,000 iterations) was per- formed by randomly selecting densities (initial and final) within the 95% confidence interval provided by the carle and strub method, assuming a uniform dis- tribution within the confidence interval range. model selection and averaging were reapplied to each data set, and the significance of each variable was tested using wald z tests. results temperature the first two pca axes for the summer season, explained 85.7% of the total variance (fig. s1). the first axis (t1) correlated with the mean and maximum temperatures, while the second axis (t2) predomi- nantly correlated with the minimum temperature. the interannual average reach positions (barycentres) were mainly distributed along t1, which accounted for the thermal gradient. for the winter period, the two-first axes explained 73.0% of the variance. t1 primarily correlated with the maximum temperature and the temperature variance, whereas t2 correlated with the mean and median temperatures. the reaches were similarly distributed along t1 as in the summer period. flow during the summer, the first two pca axes (q1 and q2) explained 97.6% of the variance (fig. s2). the first axis (76.6% of the total variance) corresponded to a flow level gradient, where all 9 variables highly and positively correlated with q1. the second axis q2 (21.2% of the total variance) reflected the flow variability. during the winter period, two axes explained 91.5% of the variance and similarly accounted for the flow gradient (q1) and the flow variability (q2). the first across 12 years fish sampling at the reach scale, the mean ( sd) brown_trout den- sities in july ranged between 19.3  11 and 78.6  24.7 trout per 100 m2 (table 1), with a minimum in bo2 and a maximum in bo3. the mean ( sd) capture probability of 0+ fish (table 1) was significantly lower in july than in november (wilcoxon’s test; z = 2.86; p = 0.004). for older age classes, the mean capture probability 5 linear mixed effects models (lmm) were used to test for the respective effects of initial densities per age class (d0+, d1+ and d>1+), temperature (t1 and t2) and flow (q1 and q2) on each life trait (apparent survival, mean length and coefficient of variation for length). the year and reach were included as random effects in analyses. a top-down strategy was used for model selection (zuur et al. 2009; parra et al. 2012). a beyond optimal model (zuur et al. 2009) was first defined; it included all the main effects and only the main relevant two-way interactions (i.e., between ini- tial densities and environmental variables). the ran- dom structure was tested using reml (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation and likelihood-ratio tests; p-values were corrected as likelihood ratios fol- low a 0.5 9 v2 1 distribution (zuur et al. 2009). finally, the fixed structure was searched using the maximum likelihood estimation (ml). as variables were measured on different scales, they were standar- dised using the arm package (gelman & su 2013) to facilitate the interpretation of the relative magnitude of the estimates (grueber et al. 2011). model selec- tion and averaging were implemented using the ak- aike’s small sample size (aicc) with the mumin package (barton 2013). a top model set satisfying the criterion δaicc < 2 from the best model was selected (burn- ham & anderson 2002). model averaging was pro- cessed on the selected models using the natural average method for coefficient estimates (burnham & anderson 2002; grueber et al. 2011). this method averages the parameter estimates only over models in which the predictor appears and provides 95% confi- dence intervals and wald z tests for averaged esti- mates. the each parameter was calculated as the sum of the weights of the different models that included this parameter. a relative importance of 1 indicated that the parame- ter was included in all of the selected models. in case information criterion corrected for importance (imp) of relative richard et al. table 1. mean ( sd) brown_trout densities per reach, age class and sampling month over a

relationship. con- versely, the interaction between q1 and d0+ was significant in 97.5% of the simulations. this inter- action indicated that low-flow values, ssum0+ and d0+ exhibited a negative

because q1 primarily accounted for the mean and maximum daily flows, a low summer flow resulted in lower ssum1+. considering sampling error, parameter estimates remained fairly constant across

all 11 years. at the end of the second summer (1+ age class), the juvenile initial density (d1+), q1 and t1 were strongly selected in the averaged model of mean length (lnov1+). the main effect was due to the negative density-dependent relationship between d1+ and lnov1+. the mean summer flow q1 and mean temperature t1 both positively influenced lnov1+. random reach and year effects were significant (lr chisq = 14.68, chisq = 4.55, p = 0.016). p < 0.001; lr coefficient of variation for 0+ length the coefficient of variation for the 0+ length at the end of the first summer (cvnov0+) increased with increasing initial 0+ density (table 3). the initial density of 1+ (d1+) was also positively related to cvnov0+ (imp = 0.72). the flow variability (q2) also positively affected the 0+ size variation at the end of the summer. at the end of the winter period, the coefficient of variation for 1+ length (cvjuil1+) was positively related to the d0+ from the previous autumn and neg- atively related to the t1. per reach analysis (fig. 5) exhibited a similar pattern of positive relationships between the d0+ and cvjuil1+ in all 11 reaches. at the end of the second summer, the cvnov1+ did not correlate with the initial density of 1+ individuals but was positively related to the adult (>1+) density (table 3). the temperature variable t2 negatively influenced the size variation of 1+ fish during the 8 summer. a random reach effect was significant for (lr test, lr chisq = 7.17, this second summer p = 0.004). discussion analysis of the low-density brown_trout population of the boiron river revealed that both density-depen- dent and density-independent regulations were oper- ating on the apparent survival, mean size and size variability of 0+ and 1+ fish (i.e., from the first sum- mer to the end of the second summer). suggesting a density-dependent density-dependent mortality has been described as a major mechanism of salmonid population regula- tion that occurs shortly after emergence (elliott 1994; milner et al. 2003), when fish compete for food and space. thereafter, density-independent survival was reported (elliott 1985), at least until the second sum- mer (lobon-cervia 2012). in our study, apparent sur- the 0+ and 1+ fish was predominantly vival of affected by the initial density of the respective age class, regulation through intracohort competition. this result agrees with newman (1993), who observed that the loss rate (mortality and/or emigration) of 0+ brown_trout from their first summer to the following spring was den- sity-dependent. a bottleneck during winter occurs in some salmonid populations due to limited resources (cunjak & power 1987) or low shelter availability (armstrong & griffiths 2001) that increases vulnera- bility to predators. however, this phenomenon does not seem to be a rule, as carlson et al. (2008) did not observe additional over-winter mortality in brown_trout populations. density-dependent mortality was biotic and abiotic regulation of a low-density brown_trout population bo1 bo2 bo3 bo4 bo5 bo6 bo7 bo8 bo9 bt1 le1 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 5.2 5.0 4.8 4.6 4.4 5.2 5.0 4.8 4.6 4.4 5.2 5.0 4.8 4.6 4.4 1 + n r a e y t a ) + 1 u l j l ( g o l fig. 4. relationships per reach between 1+ mean length in the summer (ljul1+) and 0+ densities of the previous autumn. log (autumn 0+ density) also observed later in life at the yearling (1+) or adult (>1+) stages (carline 2006; vøllestad & olsen 2008; lobon-cervia 2012). survival of 1+ brown_trout at low flow, which was independent from the initial density; under intermedi- ate to higher flow, the apparent survival was density- dependent. the authors hypothesised that drought stress was the major process regulating populations, and under normal flow conditions, density depen- dence occurred. over the 12 years of the present study, no exceptional drought conditions occurred; however, low flow, especially during the first sum- mer, enhanced the strength of density-dependent reg- ulation on apparent survival. during the second summer, a negative effect of low flow on the appar- ent survival of 1+ fish was also detected, as previ- ously observed by elliott et al. (1997) for age 0+ and 1+ sea_trout s. trutta after summer droughts. low flow reduced habitat quality and quantity, which potentially lead to a higher mortality, especially in reaches with low pool areas (hakala & hartman 2004). the underlying processes explaining the density- dependent apparent survival of 0+ and 1+ fish in the 9 the models on apparent survival were tested by simulating density estimate uncertainties. in our sam- pling, most uncertainties arose from the size-bias of electrofishing (i.e., lower capture efficiency of small fish) but also from the relatively short length (in a population dynamics context; 12 years) of our time- series data (lebreton & gimenez 2013). simulations clearly demonstrated that density estimate uncertain- ties could question the strength of the relationship between survival and age class densities, especially during the first summer of the 0+ stage. however, the interaction between 0+ density and the flow vari- able q1 (accounting for mean flow over each period) remained highly significant in almost all simulations. density affected apparent survival during low-flow years, whereas low or no density dependence was detected flow. conversely, vøllestad & olsen (2008) reported a lower apparent high mean under richard et al. 1 + n r a e y t a ) l j + 1 u v c ( g o l 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 bo1 bo2 bo3 bo4 bo5 bo6 bo7 bo8 bo9 bt1 le1 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 2 log (autumn 0+ density) 0 1 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 fig. 5. relationships per reach between the coefficient of variation for length of 1+ fish in the summer (cvjul1+) and 0+ densities of the previous autumn. boiron river are unknown. the absence of signifi- cant intercohort effect suggests more spatial habitat segregation than diet partitioning between cohorts, because 0+ and 1+ fish feeding niches generally overlap (kaspersson & h€ojesj€o 2009). stream-dwell- ing salmonids generally compete via interference, while defending the most valuable feeding territories (grant 1997). in the boiron, summers are often char- acterised by long periods of low flow, therefore gath- ering fish in restricted microhabitats. this probably increased aggression and competition for food and shelters. also, the predation by avian predators, such as herons ardea cinerea and kingfisher alcedo atthis (which have both been observed along the river), may be increased during low-flow periods. finally, migration could also be responsible for the lower apparent survival observed. einum et al. (2006) dem- onstrated that the 0+ density did not affect summer survival but strongly affected dispersal. although our data did not allow disentangling the respective parts of real mortality and migration, we cannot exclude 10 that the lower apparent survival could result from a general pattern of downstream migration, even though stream-dwelling yoy brown_trout generally display restricted movement (kaspersson & h€ojesj€o 2009). density-dependent growth was reported for the three studied periods. this is consistent with other studies that revealed a negative power relationship between body size or weight and 0+ fish density in low-density brown_trout (lobon-cervia 2007a) and salmon populations (imre et al. 2005). therefore, an increase of density would yield greater effects on mean length under low densities. in our study, mean fish growth was regulated both by intra- and interco- hort competitions, especially during the first summer, and the relationships were consistent between years and reaches. yearling (1+) densities affected yoy growth, as observed in other brown_trout populations (nordwall et al. 2001; lobon-cervia 2005; kaspers- son & h€ojesj€o 2009). intercohort densities (≥1+) dur- ing the first year of marble trout life determined the biotic and abiotic regulation of a low-density brown_trout population mean length and weight of the year-class throughout their lifetime (vincenzi et al. 2008b, 2010a), suggest- ing that growth trajectories are determined early in life. however, vincenzi et al. (2008b) did not assess 0+ densities, which were reported as the major effec- tors of the growth of 0+ individuals in the present study, as well as in atlantic salmon populations (imre et al. 2005). conversely, we did not detect any effect of the 0+ density on the growth of age 1+ as reported by kvingedal & einum (2011). during the first sum- mer, 0+ and 1+ individuals presumably compete for the same feeding territories at the expense of the growth of 0+ fish. the exclusion of 0+ fish from the preferred habitats and shelters by older cohorts was usually reported during the first summer (kaspersson et al. 2012) and the first winter (vehanen et al. 1999). in our study, the mean length after the first winter and second summer were mostly related to in- tracohort density. (1993) size variation around the mean (cv of body length) was also positively related to 0+ fish density after the first summer and the first winter period, which was consistent in almost all reaches. increasing size variation with density has already been reported in low-density salmonid populations (jenkins et al. 1999; einum et al. 2006; lobon-cervia 2010), although the shape of the relationship (i.e., linear or power function) is uncertain (lobon-cervia 2010). following newman’s site-quality model, higher within-cohort densities would lead to an increase of slow-growing fish (relegated to less valu- able places), thus resulting in a greater variation in fish size. in our study, the cv was no more related to the age class density after the second summer (1+ fish). nordwall et al. (2001) demonstrated an inverse (negative) relationship between the cv and 1+ fish density in resident brown_trout populations, which was explained by an increased mortality of slow-growing fish during the first year of life. although the underlying mechanisms cannot be elu- cidated from the observed data, we hypothesise that a size-dependent mortality (i.e., impacting slow-grow- ing fish) occurred after the first winter, which miti- gated the positive relationship between cv and density. this would be in accordance with lobon- cervia (2012), who demonstrated an increased mortality after the first year. in addition to the biotic regulation, the mean tem- perature and flow were positively related to the mean fish size during the summer season. the relationship between brown_trout growth and water temperature has been widely reported and modelled (e.g., elliott & elliott 1995; nicola & almodovar 2004). parra et al. (2012) demonstrated a positive effect of water temperature on growth, even though high-temperature values provoked deleterious effects, especially during the first year of life. in the boiron river, mean daily temperatures remained in a range suitable for brown_trout growth (elliott & elliott 2010), although maxi- mum temperatures sometimes exceeded 20 °c in the downstream reaches during the summer. the positive effect of temperature was stronger during the first summer than in the two following periods. this is consistent with parra et al. (2012), who showed that temperature was a strong determinant for 0+ growth, whereas for older age classes, density-dependent reg- ulation was the primary process acting on growth. the flow level during summer was positively related to 0+ and 1+ fish length. a reduced summer flow constrains fish in a restricted habitat, where fish compete for the most profitable position. vøllestad & olsen (2008) showed that summer droughts nega- tively affected brown_trout individual growth in a norwegian stream. juvenile brown_trout generally display a drift-feeding behaviour (glova & field- dodgson 1995). with higher flows, the number of drifting preys becoming available to fish increases together with the number of favourable foraging loca- tions, thus presumably increasing mean fish growth (nislow et al. 2004; vøllestad & olsen 2008). teic- hert et al. (2010) manipulated flow and juvenile atlantic salmon in artificial streams and demonstrated a similar positive relationship between growth and discharge (or mean velocity) during the summer. conversely, during the winter, they reported negative fish growth rates, which were neither related to flow variations nor density. in the present study, flow parameters were not retained by the model during the winter season. low-flow periods during summer reduce the availability of feeding territories for juve- nile brown_trout that in turn could increase the com- petition for resources. the biotic and abiotic regulation of body size experienced at the juvenile stage (first two years of life) may have subsequent effects on population dynamics. early conditions could determine later growth trajectories (e.g., vincenzi et al. 2010a), which could influence individual fitness. body size is related to different life history traits, such as age at maturity, fecundity, egg size and survival (vincenzi et al. 2012). for example, the number of eggs pro- duced by 1+ females correlated with fish size and was determined during the first year in brown_trout populations from the esva river basin, spain (lobon-cervia et al. 1997). at a lower density, com- pensatory increases in body growth induced a faster sexual maturation and a higher per capita egg pro- duction (vincenzi et al. 2010b). jenkins et al. (1999) hypothesised that density-dependent growth could allow brown_trout populations to recover quickly after major catastrophic events leading to high mor- tality rates. vincenzi et al. (2008a) demonstrated that 11 richard et al. because density-dependent growth occurred, the resil- ience of marble trout populations increased after severe floods. we also revealed that the apparent sur- vival at the juvenile stage (0+ and 1+ fish) increased when the density was lower, which could be a power- ful mechanism to quickly restore a higher population size after a major disturbance. density-dependent mechanisms acting on both apparent survival and growth can presumably foster population recovery in harsh or occasionally disturbed environments (i.e., after floods, rain-on-snow events, droughts or point pollutions) and increase population resilience. the originality of this study relies on coupling population data collected at multiple sites over 12 years with environmental features to investigate the factors driving population dynamics. this approach did not address the causes of the observed density-dependent processes. inferring the nature of the mechanism involved (either limitation by food or space, or both) from empirical studies may be mis- leading and requires well-designed experimental studies (ward et al. 2007). however, we clearly demonstrated the major role of biotic processes in the regulation of apparent survival, mean length and cv, for three juvenile stages (first summer, first winter and second summer). the strong interacting effect of flow and trout density on apparent survival highlighted the need for jointly analysing the roles of biotic and abiotic factors. although density- dependent and density-independent processes act simultaneously on brown_trout populations, biotic processes (both intra- and intercohort) are the pre- vailing effects in the boiron river, presumably in the absence of major climatic events (extreme droughts, spates). acknowledgements this research was supported by the swiss federal office for environment (ofev) and the fisheries department of the vaud canton. we kindly thank all of the volunteers from the
