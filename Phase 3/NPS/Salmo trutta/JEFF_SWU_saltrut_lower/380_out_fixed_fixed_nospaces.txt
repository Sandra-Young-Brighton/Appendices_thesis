ve´ron et al. 2003). as young stages may reach brackish waters earlier than in the past, it is necessary to question the ability of very young larvae to osmoregulate. most teleost prelarva can osmoregulate at hatching and their ability usually increase in later stages (varsamos et al. 2005). in american shad, alosa sapisissima, the ability to enter doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00259.x 193 bardonnet & jatteau long before most into full strength sea water develops at the larval– juvenile transition (between 36 and 45 days pos- thatch), juveniles migrate into estuary (zydlewski & mccormick 1997). the ability of young allis shad larvae to cope with a range of salinities has recently been investigated in shads from 13 to 69 days posthatching (leguen et al. 2007). to evaluate the possible risk of mortality linked with an early contact of shad larvae with brackish water, the salinity tolerance of allis shad larvae having absorbed their yolk sac was experimentally assessed. in this study, we exposed larvae of different ages (from 5 to 27 days posthatching) to short-term osmotic chal- lenges and evaluated mortality rates after 2 and 20 h of exposure. materials and methods eggs were obtained from spontaneous spawning of genitors (one female and two males) caught in the wild. a few hours after spawning, eggs were collected and transferred to zoug jars (bottle for the incubation of ﬁsh eggs with water ﬂow upward to maintain eggs in suspension for adequate oxygenation). water over- ﬂowing the jars fell into small containers and then circulated through uv sterilisation system before joining a large tank where water was aerated, thermo-regulated (20 ± 1°c) and redirected toward zoug jars. after hatching, yolk sac larvae swam directly from the jars into the small containers equipped with a net at their outﬂow to prevent any larval escapement. larvae developed there until the end of hatching and then were moved to outdoor facilities on day 3 after the peak of hatching. they were poured in a small cage: 50 cm · 50 cm · 15 cm high, 500-lm mesh ﬂoating in a 0.25-m3 ﬂowing water tank. water was pumped in a nearby pond fed by the nivelle river (43°22n, 1°35w; conductivity: )1; complete ionic analysis available 150–200 lsæcm in dumas & haury 1995), then ﬂowed through a ﬁlter (1-mm mesh) and arrived directly in the cage, providing natural zooplankton. each testing day, 300 larvae (15 larvae · ﬁve replicates · four salinity conditions) were randomly collected in a glass and gently poured into test boxes at 10:00 hours. just before the test, each test box (l = 18 cm; l = 12 cm; h = 10 cm) received 400 ml of aerated water at 20 (±1°c). different salinity conditions were obtained by diluting sea water (col- lected from coastal water, biarritz, atlantic ocean) in river water (nivelle river, same origin than the one feeding the pond where larvae were reared). young larvae were subjected to four different salinity condi- )1, hereafter tions: 0, 10–12, 19–21 and 32–34 gæl called 0, 10, 20 and 30 for convenience. these salinity conditions were chosen to represent: fresh water, 194 upper estuary, lower estuary and sea water, respect- ively. survival was visually assessed 2 and 20 h after transfer for different ages (in days after hatching). tests were carried out on very young larvae (at days 5, 6, 7 and 8). additional tests were carried out on day 13 and on day 27. the standard lengths of some representative individuals at each age were: 8–9 mm for 5- to 8-day-old larvae; 10.5 mm on day 13 and 15 mm long on day 27. results results from days 5, 6, 7 and 8 were very similar. kruskal–wallis tests carried out on these four dates (d.f. = 3, ﬁve replicates, n = 20) at each time (2 and 20 h) and salinity (0, 10, 20, 30) showed that h values were lower than the critical value at p = 0.05, except at salinity 30 for the 2-h test. data were combined to make the comparisons with further dates easier (fig. 1a). survival was usually high 2 h after the transfer, except at salinity 30 (fig. 1a–c). at salinity 30, survival reached 0% after 2 h in most cases, except in very young larvae (day 5–8) where 50% survival on average was observed (fig. 1a). however, after 20 h at this salinity, mortality reached 100% irrespective of the age of larvae. by contrast, survival always ranged between 90% and 100% at salinity 10 (figs 1 and 2b). at salinities 0 and 20, a high rate of survival (80% on average) was observed in very young larvae (days 5–8, fig. 1a). on day 13, average survival declined by half to reach on average 40% and 34%, respectively, at salinity 0 and 20 (fig. 2a and c). however, survival probability did not differ between these two salinities (h0 accepted, mann–whitney u-test, u < critical at p = 0.05, fig. 1b). on day 27, survival at salinity 0 was high (83% on average), whereas it remained low at salinity 20 (43% on average, fig. 1c). at that time, difference in survival probability between salinity 0 and 20 was just at the limit of signiﬁcance (mann– whitney u-test, u = critical value at p = 0.05). at salinity 20, survival in the 20-h test was less than 50%, except in young larvae (day 5–8, fig. 2c). value discussion the consistently better survival observed in the present experiment at salinity 10 can be explained by a possible lower stress under such salinity condi- tions. indeed, mineral salt formulations can mitigate stress and improve survival (wedemeyer 1997). according to takei et al. (2006), the isosmotic salinity )1. from a physiological in ﬁsh larva is around 10 gæl point of view, isosmotic rearing conditions decrease the energy expenditure required to maintain ionic homeostasis, and this phenomenon may also explain salinity tolerance in young allis shad larvae (a) 100 ) % ( h 2  r e t f a l i a v v r u s 50 0 0 0 100 50 0 ) % (  h 0 2 r e t f a l i a v v r u s 10 salinity 20 10 20 salinity 30 30 (b) 100 ) %  ( h 2 r e t f a l i a v v r u s ) %  ( h 0 2 r e t f a l i a v v r u s 50 0 100 50 0 fig. 1. changes in per cent survival accord- ing to the salinity conditions and to the test durations (2 and 20 h) at different ages. line represents the median, and upper and lower boxes, the upper and lower quartiles. the black circle represents the mean and aster- isks represent outliers. salinity 0 represents river water; salinity 10 represents brackish water in upper estuary; salinity 20, brackish water in middle estuary and salinity 30, sea water. the upper graph represents per cent survival after 2 h and the lower graph after 20 h.

(2007) made the same observation on allis shad with 0% survival at 20 days posthatching and 20% survival at 25 days posthatching. under- standing why after transfer to sea water, 2-h mortality rates were variable only in young larvae (5–8 days old) would require speciﬁc investigations on young larvae morphology and gill development. indeed, skin 0 10 salinity 20 30 (c) 100 ) %  ( h 2 r e t f a l i a v v r u s 50 0 100 ) % ( h 0 2  r e t f a l i a v v r u s 50 0 0 10 20 salinity 30 0 10 salinity 20 30 0 10 20 salinity 30 permeability, drinking rates, chloride cells distribution are among the many factors that change rapidly during ontogeny and that may affect salinity tolerance (varsamos et al. 2005). at salinities 0 and 20, the lowest survival rates were observed on day 13. between 1 and 2 weeks after hatching, larvae that have not started to feed are especially weak and a large peak of mortality usually occurs. this phenomenon of mass mortality has also been described in a. sapidissima and concerns larvae which have failed to feed between 7 and 14 days after hatching (wiggins et al. 1985). shad larvae are highly sensitive to stress and handling (howey 1985). therefore, the quite high rates of mortality on day 13 might be due to the high stress of starved larvae. leguen et al.

(2007) showed that allis shad develop hypososmoregularity ability several months before the bulk of downstream migration. in their study of acclimation to sea water, zydlewski et al. (2003) concluded that early migration could be advantageous as the ability of juvenile american shad to osmoregulate is maximum before the effect- ive time of migration. however, further experiments would be necessary to evaluate the risk of mortality linked to predation or turbulence in tidal ﬂows. in addition, the risk of drift towards areas where marine waters penetrate the estuary has to be thoroughly evaluated. indeed, jatteau et al. (2002) showed that allis shad larvae, reared in an experimental circular ﬂowing tank, exhibit a high drifting rate during their ﬁrst 2 weeks of growth. river and ﬁsh management programmes are partly based on what we know about the biology and life-history patterns of target species. indirect tools 196 and conservation of the world’s shad. american fisheries society symposium 35: 85–102. beasley, c.a. & hightower, j.e. 2000. effects of low-head dam on the distribution and characteristics of spawning habitat used by striped bass and american shad. transactions of the american fisheries society 129: 1316–1330. belaud, a., carette, a., cassou-leins, f. & cassou-leins, j.j. 2001. choix des sites de fraie par la grande alose (alosa alosa l.) en moyenne garonne. bulletin franc¸ais de peˆche et de pisciculture 362 ⁄ 363: 869–880. dumas, j. & haury, j. 1995. une rivie`re du pie´mont pyre´ne´en: la nivelle (pays basque). acta biologica montana xi: 113– 146. houde, e.d. 2002. mortality. in: fuiman, l.a. & werner, r.g., eds. fisheries science – the unique contributions of early life stages, chap. 3. oxford: blackwell science ltd, pp. 64–87. howey, r.g. 1985. intensive culture of juvenile american shad. the progressive fish-culturist 47: 203–212. jatteau, p., bardonnet, a., belaud, a., dauba, f., sabatie´, m.r. & ve´ron, v. 2002. ecologie des jeunes stades d’alose alosa alosa contribution a` la connaissance des habitats colonise´s avant la de´valaison. contrat 2001 ⁄ 001, etude no. 76. rapport diren ⁄ grisam. 57 pp. leguen, i., ve´ron, v., sevellec, c., azam, d., sabatie´, m.r., prunet, p. & baglinie`re, j.-l. 2007. development of hypo- osmoregulatory ability in allis shad alosa alosa. journal of fish biology 70: 630–637. limburg, k.e. 1998. anomalous migration of anadromous herrings revealed with natural chemical tracers. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 55: 431–437. limburg, k.e. & ross, r.e. 1995. growth and mortality rates of larval american shad, alosa sapidissima, at different salinities. estuaries 18: 335–340. lochet, a. 2006. seaward migration and successful tactics of allis shad alosa alosa and twaite shad alosa fallax: insights from otolith microstructure and microchemistry; translated salinity tolerance in young allis shad larvae title, phd thesis, bordeaux i university ⁄ cemagref bor- deaux. 208 pp. takei, y., kawakoshi, a., tsukada, t., yuge, s., ogoshi, m., inoue, k., hyodo, s., bannai, h. & miyano, s. 2006. contribution of comparative ﬁsh studies to general endocri- nology: structure and function of some osmoregulatory hormones. journal of experimental zoology 305a: 787–798. toma`s, j., augagneur, s. & rochard, e. 2005. discrimination of the natal origin of young-of-the-year allis shad (alosa alosa) in the garonne-dordogne basin (south-west france) using otolith chemistry. ecology of freshwater fish 14: 185–190. varsamos, s., nebel, c. & charmantier, g. 2005. ontogeny of osmoregulation in postembryonic ﬁsh: a review. comparative biochemistry and physiology part a 141: 401–429. ve´ron, v., jatteau, ph. & bardonnet, a. 2003. first results on the behavior of young stages of allis shad alosa alosa. american fisheries society symposium 35: 241. wedemeyer, g.a. 1997. rearing conditions: effects on ﬁsh in intensive culture. in: iwama, g.k., pickering, a.d., sumpter, j.p. & schreck, c.b., eds. fish stress and health in aquaculture. society for experimental biology seminar series: 62. cambridge, uk: university press, pp. 35–72. wiggins, t.a., bender, t.r. jr, mudrak, v.a. & coll, j.a. 1985. the development, feeding, growth, and survival of cultured american shad larvae through the transition from endogenous to exogenous nutrition. progressive fish-cultur- ist 47: 87–93. zydlewski, j. & mccormick, s.d. 1997. the ontogeny of salinity tolerance in the american shad, alosa sapidissima. canadian journal of ﬁsheries and aquatic sciences 54: 182–189. zydlewski, j., mccormick, s.d. & kunkel, j.g. 2003. late migration and seawater entry is physiologically disadvanta- geous for american shad juveniles. journal of ﬁsh biology 63: 1521–1537. 197
