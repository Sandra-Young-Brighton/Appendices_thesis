mcmanus et al. 2000; bellwood et al. 2003). reserves or no-take areas have been proposed as a useful management tool to protect marine ﬁshes, as higher ﬁsh abundance and diversity have been reported inside reserves compared with areas subjected to ﬁshing activities (lubchenco et al. 2003). effects of ﬁshing pressure on ﬁsh communities have been far less studied on tropical freshwater lakes, but there is evidence that ﬁshing has reduced the abundance and diversity of exploited ﬁsh in southeast asia (lorenzen et al. 1998) and in the peruvian amazon (gerstner et al. 2006). in an african lake, ﬁshing gear used by ﬁshers affect the composi- tion of the ﬁsh community, because of changes in abundance of an introduced piscivorous ﬁsh (schin- dler et al. 1998). comparative studies addressing ﬁsh abundance and diversity in areas open and closed to ﬁshing are crucial to monitor the efﬁcacy of protected areas under the framework of adaptive management (hilborn et al. 2004). more of these studies are required in freshwater’s ecosystems, for example investigating the ecological effects of the common- based ﬁsheries management systems adopted in the brazilian amazon. the high ﬁsh diversity of the amazon basin sustains several small-scale artisanal ﬁsheries, which are the main economic activity of amazonian riverine populations (bayley & petrere 1989; batista et al. 1998). however, ﬁshing pressure has been increasing in amazon, and there is evidence of over-ﬁshing of some important commercial ﬁsh, such as the tambaqui 156 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00333.x (colossoma macroporum) (costa et al. 1999; reinert & winter 2002; sa´nchez-botero et al. 2005), pirarucu (arapaima gigas) (arantes et al. 2005) and large catﬁshes (pimelodidae) (petrere et al. 2004). in the brazilian amazon, most of the ﬁshing occurs along the white-water (higher organic matter) rivers, where the ﬂoodplain va´rzea lakes are regularly exploited by local ﬁshing communities. these ﬂood- plains are nutrient-rich and hold high ﬁsh abundance and diversity (junk et al. 1983; lowe-mcconnell 1987; henderson & crampton 1997; crampton 1999; saint-paul et al. 2000; silvano et al. 2000). albeit the composition of ﬁsh landings at amazonas and solimo˜es rivers usually includes about 30–40 species, most of the catch often consists of 5–10 ﬁsh species, including large catﬁsh (pimelodidae) caught in the river channel and ﬁsh caught mainly in lakes, such as the tambaqui, pirarucu, tucunare´ (cichla spp.), aruan~a (osteoglossum bicirhosum) and pacus (myleus spp. and mylossoma spp.) (petrere 1985; mcgrath et al. 1993; isaac et al. 1996; batista et al. 1998; almeida et al. 2001; rufﬁno 2002; viana 2004; maccord et al. 2007). therefore, these lakes may be viable environ- mental units to ﬁshery management because they have well-deﬁned boundaries during the low-water season and hold sedentary populations of target ﬁsh, such as the tambaqui, pirarucu, tucunare´ and aruana˜ (mcgrath et al. 1999). as a result of personnel and funding limitations to run monitoring and enforcement programs, conserva- tion initiatives in remote regions, such as the brazilian amazon, would greatly beneﬁt by including local people. indeed, one of the most recent and promising approaches aimed to locally protect and manage amazonian ﬁsh is a kind of co-management where local ﬁshermen participate in management decisions, preventing outsiders from ﬁshing in selected lakes (mcgrath et al. 1993; mcdaniel 1997; queiroz & crampton 1999; castro & mcgrath 2003). the mamiraua´ sustainable development reserve was created in 1990 to protect the biodiversity of a large ﬂoodplain area in the central brazilian amazon, actively recruiting local communities in natural resources conservation (ayres 1993; queiroz 2005). one of the main co-management measures adopted there since 1995 consists of a zoning system of lakes, which establishes two categories: lakes closed to ﬁshing (hereafter denominated as no-take) and lakes open to ﬁshing by local people only (hereafter denominated as ﬁshed) (queiroz & crampton 1999). our major goal was to compare ﬁsh abundance, diversity and species composition between ﬁshed and no-take lakes of the mamiraua´ reserve in the brazil- ian amazon, in order to investigate the potential inﬂuences of the common-based management on ﬁsh communities. we expect these parameters that all effects of ﬁsheries on amazon ﬁsh communities in particular would show higher mean values in no-take compared with ﬁshed lakes, as observed in previous surveys (lorenzen et al. 1998; gerstner et al. 2006). we also expected that ﬁsh community structure would differ between these two lake categories, no-take lakes showing higher abundance of large-sized and com- mercial ﬁshes, those more intensely exploited by ﬁshers. besides being one of the ﬁrst studies investigating both the efﬁcacy of freshwater reserves to protect food ﬁshes and the ecological consequences of common-based ﬁsheries manage- ment, this study will compliment the available surveys of ﬁsh populations in the mamiraua´ reserve (costa et al. 1999; castello 2004; arantes et al. 2005; http:// www.mamiraua.org.br). we thus provide baseline data to improve both ongoing and planned ﬁsheries man- agement approaches in amazon (mcgrath et al. 1993; mcdaniel 1997; queiroz & crampton 1999; reinert & winter 2002), as well as in other tropical freshwater ﬁsheries. study area the mamiraua´ sustainable reserve, located on the conﬂuence of solimo˜es and japura´ rivers, has a total area of 1.124.000 ha and is subdivided into nine sectors with about 60 small human settlements and 527 resident families living along the margins of main rivers (http://www.mamiraua.org.br; queiroz & crampton 1999). the two main rivers (solimo˜es and japura´) draining the reserve have predominant white- water properties (henderson & robertson 1999). we sampled ﬁsh communities of ﬁshed and no-take lakes located between the coordinates of 02°45¢–02°50¢s and 64°58¢–65°05¢w in the jaraua´ sector, which is bordered by the conﬂuence of the jaraua´ and japura rivers and is located in the core management area of the mamiraua´ reserve (queiroz & crampton 1999), where the ﬁshing village of sa˜o raimundo do jaraua (hereafter denoted jaraua´) is located (02°51¢849 s, 64°55¢750 w) (fig. s1). the mamiraua´ reserve and its management system could beneﬁt the middle solimo˜es river region, where ﬁshery is one of the main economic activities and ﬁsh is the main animal protein consumed (barthem 1999; rufﬁno 2002; viana 2004). the most exploited ﬁsh in the middle solimo˜es region are the jaraqui (semapro- chilodus spp.), curimata˜, aruana˜, tucunare´, pacu, bodo´ , pirapitinga (piaractus brachypomus) tambaqui and pirarucu; with the exception of jaraqui all others are caught in lakes (barthem 1999; viana 2004) and would thus be subjected to more intense regional ﬁshing pressure. the main ﬁshing gear used by ﬁshers from tefe´ (the major city in the region) are the seine nets and gillnets, which account for about 80% of total ﬁsh caught, gillnets being used mainly to catch ﬁsh in 157 silvano et al. ﬂoodplain lakes during the low-water season (barthem 1999; rufﬁno 2002; viana 2004). some studies show that the ﬁshing-management measures (including the zoning systems of lakes) adopted in mamiraua´ have been successful to enhance the populations of pirarucu (arantes et al. 2005) and tambaqui (costa et al. 1999), but possible management effects on the whole ﬁsh community are not yet well known. considering the ﬁshing intensity in the mamiraua reserve, during 1993–1995, jaraua´ ﬁshermen made a total of 261 ﬁshing trips, 205 of which (78%) happened in lakes and 176 (86%) in ﬁshed lakes. these ﬁshermen marketed a total of 13.8 t of ﬁsh from february 1994 to january 1995 (barthem 1999). more recently, in 2003, jaraua´ ﬁshermen caught a total of 2.3 and 17.1 t of ﬁsh during the high- and low-water seasons respectively (maccord et al. 2007). according to these studies, the main lake ﬁshes regularly caught, marketed and eaten by people from jaraua´ are pirarucu, tambaqui, aruana˜, pacu, tucunare´, bodo´ , (queiroz 1999; maccord et al. 2007), the same ﬁshes also exploited by regional ﬁsheries from tefe´ and other nearby cities (barthem 1999; viana 2004). besides the local ﬁshery, lakes in the mamiraua´ reserve, including those in jaraua´, have been regularly exploited by outside ﬁshers, but such invasions decreased in recent years as a result of a more stringent control of lakes by the reserve ﬁshers (barthem 1999; queiroz 1999; viana 2004). jaraua lakes have thus been subjected to considerable ﬁshing pressure along the last 15 years, directed mostly to the ﬁshed lakes and during the low-water season. and pirapitinga curimata˜ materials and methods fish sampling the jaraua´ sector of the mamiraua´ reserve has about 33 no-take and 49 ﬁshed lakes. we selected 14 of these lakes (seven ﬁshed and seven no-take) after a preliminary survey and advice of local ﬁshermen. we chose lakes that could be easily located and reached during the dry season, thus being logistically feasible to daily samples. we collected ﬁsh in the selected lakes during the low-water season, in october and november of 2003. although we also sampled lakes during the high-water season (june and july of 2003), we excluded these data from this survey because of the low amount of ﬁsh sampled (r.a.m. silvano, p.f.m. lopes, m.r. souza, m. clauzet, a. begossi, j.a.s. zuanon, unpublished abstract). we made one sample per lake during 14 days (one lake per day), collecting ﬁsh with two sets of seven monoﬁlament gillnets. each gillnet had a length of 158 to sample large commercial ﬁshes. 10 m, with heights varying between 1.5 and 2.5 m, and with varied mesh sizes (pairs of nets with 15, 25, 35, 50, 60, 70 and 80 mm between opposite knots). we also used two multiﬁlament gillnets with larger mesh sizes of 110 and 120 mm respectively between opposite knots, with 70 m length and about 3.5 m height in all samplings, we placed four sets of nets (two larger nets and two sets of attached gillnets) in distinct and suitable places in the lake, attaching an end of each set of nets to the marginal vegetation and lying the nets perpendicular to the marginal vegetation and crossing the lake. we left gillnets in the water during the morning (14:00– 16:00 h), for total periods ranging from 5 to 8 h (mean 6.3 h). we checked the nets at regular 30-min intervals, to avoid damage to the nets and ﬁsh by aquatic predators (e.g., caimans, piscivorous ﬁshes and river dolphins). (8:00–12:00 h) afternoon and each ﬁsh collected was measured to standard length (sl, in cm), weighed (g), preserved in a 10% formalin solution and identiﬁed to species level by one of the authors [zuanon – instituto nacional de pesquisas da amazoˆnia (inpa)] in the inpa where we deposited voucher specimens. due to logistical constraints, when many individuals of the same species in a sample were caught, we collected some and released or discarded the others. although such a procedure did work for the majority of ﬁsh, we encountered difﬁculty when trying to discern those nonretained specimens belonging to very similar species, such as serrasalmus altispinis and serrasal- mus eigenmanni (piranha branca). we dealt with this problem by assigning all the noncollected individuals to the most common species collected at a given lake, s. which was and s. eigenmanni in one lake. we also followed this procedure for two similar sardinhas (triportheus angulatus and triportheus elongates) in ﬁve of the sampled lakes. we applied this procedure to assign species for a total of 138 individuals (9.3% of all ﬁshes collected): 115 individuals of s. altispinis, 20 of t. angulatus and three t. elongates. therefore, albeit this procedure possibly overestimated the relative abundance of some species (for example, s. altispinis), we believe this did not alter our major results and conclusions. species of altispinis lakes in three simultaneous to ﬁsh sampling, we measured the temperature, ph and dissolved oxygen levels at each the same spots where we set gillnets. lake, at we measured water temperature (early morning and late afternoon), ph (only in the morning) and dissolved oxygen (morning and afternoon) near the water surface (up to a depth of 50 cm) and averaged these data in a single daily measure for each variable. data analysis we standardised ﬁsh abundance data as kilograms per hour and number of individuals per hour, in order to account for slight differences in sampling duration among lakes. we compared ﬁsh abundance, biomass, mean ﬁsh size (sl) and environmental parameters between ﬁshed and no-take lakes using t-tests. we also used pearson linear correlation analysis to check for relationships among ﬁsh community variables and environmental variables, such as oxygen levels and distance (in km) of the lake from the jaraua´ river mouth (estimated through the cartalinx software, using global positioning system coordinates of sam- pled lakes). besides indicating the distance of lakes from the jaraua´ river, such measurements might reﬂect the accessibility of lakes to ﬁshermen, as the main ﬁshing village of the region, sa˜o raimundo do jaraua´, is located at the mouth of this river. we used the f-test (variance ratio; fowler & cohen 1990) to check for homogeneity of variances of samples and the shapiro–wilk test (ayres et al. 2000) to check for data normality. we log-transformed data to achieve normal distribution and homogeneous variances; when these was not achieved, we then used the nonparametric mann–whitney test (u) and spearman rank correla- tion coefﬁcient. due to differences in the number of individuals and species collected between the two lake categories, we compared ﬁsh diversity between ﬁshed and no-take lakes through rarefaction curves, as adopted in other surveys of ﬁsh communities (silvano et al. 2000). besides comparing the abundance (in number and biomass) of total ﬁsh caught between ﬁshed and no-take lakes, we also made a separate analysis comparing the abundance of 14 ﬁsh species more intensely targeted by local and regional ﬁshermen respectively from the jaraua´ community in mamiraua reserve and tefe´, the largest city in the region (appendix s1). for such analysis, we considered as commercial or targeted ﬁsh species those that corre- sponded to 5% or more of biomass of ﬁsh caught, consumed or sold, according to the literature (queiroz 1999; rufﬁno 2002; viana 2004; maccord et al. 2007). the piranhas included several ﬁsh species, some of which are small size and seldom caught. we thus considered as target ﬁsh only the two largest and commonest piranha species, pygocentrus nattereri and serrasalmus (appendix s1). however, considering that such piranha species were abundant in our samples and usually not intensely caught by ﬁshermen, we also analysed data for the remaining commercial ﬁshes, but excluding piranhas. rhombeus we made a principal components analysis (pca) ordination to analyse ﬁsh species composition in sampled lakes, considering both number and biomass effects of ﬁsheries on amazon ﬁsh communities of the ﬁsh caught. we also made a pca ordination of lakes according to environmental parameters: temper- ature, ph, oxygen levels and distance from the conﬂuence between the jaraua´ and japura´ rivers. we made spearman correlations between the scores of lakes in the two ﬁrst-ordination axes generated by the ﬁrst pca analysis and some of the environmental variables (distance from the main river and oxygen levels) to check for inﬂuences of these variables on ﬁsh species composition. results environmental variables the mean values of dissolved oxygen, temperature, ph and distance from the jaraua´ rivers’ mouth did not differ between ﬁshed and no-take lakes (fig. 1). of these parameters, dissolved oxygen and distance showed a higher variability among lakes, the former )1 and the second ranging from 2.8 to 16.1 mgæl ranging from 3.5 to 50.4 km (fig. 1). however, considering the 14 sampled lakes, dissolved oxygen was not related to the number of specimens (r = 0.46, d.f. = 12, p = 0.098), biomass (r = 0.48, d.f. = 12, p = 0.08), d.f. = 12, p = 0.17) r = 0.13, d.f. = 12, p = 0.65) of ﬁsh. lakes’ distance was specimens neither of (rs = 0.17, ﬁsh biomass (rs = 0.5, species-richness (rs = )0.07 n = 14, p = 0.8) nor species diversity (r = 0.39, species-richness and species diversity (h¢;

(h¢) (rs = 0.1, n = 14, p = 0.74). however, we observed nearly signiﬁcant relationships (values close to p = 0.05) between distance and ﬁsh biomass and between dissolved oxygen and ﬁsh biomass. fish abundance and diversity we collected a total of 1482 ﬁsh corresponding to 603.9 kg, from 70 species and 12 families, with a diversity of h¢ = 4.2 considering all the sampled lakes (appendix s1). in ﬁshed lakes, we collected 821 ﬁsh with a biomass of 272.5 kg, from 65 species, 12 families and h¢ = 4.2. in no-take lakes, we collected 661 ﬁshes with a biomass of 331.4 kg from 42 species, 12 families and h¢ = 3.8. the rarefaction curves indicated a higher ﬁsh species-richness in ﬁshed compared with no-take lakes (fig. 2). mean values for ﬁsh abundance (fig. 3a,b) and ﬁsh sizes (fig. 4) did not differ between ﬁshed and no-take lakes. the mean abundances of the target ﬁsh species in biomass (fig. 3a) and number (fig. 3b) also did not differ between the two lake categories, even after excluding the piranhas (fig. 3a,b). it was not possible to compare the abundance of tambaqui between the two categories of lakes through statistical tests. the large variance (fig. 5) and lakes with no tambaquis (zero data) rendered samples non- normal and with heter- ogeneous variances, even after log-transformation. the nonparametric mann–whitney test could not be applied due to overlap of observations: two ﬁshed and three no-take lakes had equal values (no tambaquis), thus resulting in rank overlaps and precluding the use of this test considering the sample size (seven lakes in each category) (fowler & cohen 1990). however, the mean number and biomass of tambaqui, a very important commercial ﬁsh, were respectively 10 and 90 times higher in no-take than in ﬁshed lakes (fig. 5). 160 (a) (b) fig. 3. mean, maximum and minimum values and 75 and 25 percentiles (as in fig. 1) of ﬁsh abundance per hour ﬁshing at ﬁshed (f) and no-take lakes (n) of the mamiraua´ reserve: (a) biomass (kg) of total ﬁsh (t = 0.37, d.f. = 12, p = 0.71), only commercial (target) ﬁsh (com; t = )0.49, d.f. = 12, p = 0.63) and commercial ﬁsh excluding piranhas (excl; t = )0.313, d.f. = 12, p = 0.76); total ﬁsh (t = 0.97, individuals of d.f. = 12, p = 0.351), only commercial (target) ﬁsh (com; t = 0.08, d.f. = 12, p = 0.94) and commercial ﬁsh excluding piranhas (excl; t = )0.25, d.f. = 12, p = 0.81). (b) number of fish species composition considering the total number of specimens caught, the overall composition of ﬁsh communities was similar for ﬁshed and no-take lakes: the main ﬁsh species in both lakes categories were the piranhas (serrasalmus spp. and p. nattereri), besides the commercial ﬁsh aruana˜ (osteoglossum bicirrhosum), this same pattern being observed regarding biomass (appendix s1). the two ﬁrst axes generated by the pca analysis of lakes according to the number of ﬁsh showed eingen- values of 12.33 and 11.46 respectively, accounting for effects of ﬁsheries on amazon ﬁsh communities (a) 12 2 s x a i 8 4 0 –4 (b) 12 2 s x a i 8 4 0 –4 (c) 2.0 1.0 2 s x a i 0.0 –1.0 –2.0 f5 nn f f f nn f f n n –4 0 4 axis 1 f3 f7 8 f5 f3 f7 n nn nff n n –10 –6 –2 axis 1 2 f7 n n n n f n f5 f n f3 f f n –3 –1 1 axis 1 3 fig. 6. ordination of ﬁshed (f) and no-take (n) lakes along the ﬁrst two axes of the pca analyses based on (a) number of ﬁshes, (b) ﬁsh biomass and (c) environmental characteristics (see mate- rials and methods). the three most distinct lakes are marked (f3, f5 and f7) on each ﬁgure. number of ﬁsh caught, lacking any obvious patterns of segregation between ﬁshed and no-take lakes, the from all others same three lakes being distinct 161 fig. 4. mean, maximum and minimum values and 75 and 25 percentiles (as in fig. 1) of standard length of ﬁsh collected in ﬁshed and no-take lakes of the mamiraua´ reserve (t = )1.42, d.f. = 12, p = 0.18). fig. 5. mean, maximum and minimum values and 75 and 25 percentiles (as in fig. 1) of biomass (kg) and number of tambaqui caught per hour ﬁshing at ﬁshed and no-take lakes of the mamiraua reserve. the y-axis was broken, due to large variability of data in no-take lakes. 17.6% and 16.4% of the variance respectively, thus explaining 34% of the total variance in the data set. this analysis did not provide any distinction among ﬁsh communities of no-take and ﬁshed lakes. how- ever, two ﬁshed lakes showed higher scores along the ﬁrst axis and another one showed a high score in the second axis, those three lakes being thus distinct from all others (fig. 6a). the two ﬁrst axes generated by the pca based on ﬁsh biomass showed eingenvalues of 12.66 and 11.15 respectively, accounting together for 34% of the variance. the resulting ordination was almost identical to the previous analysis based on the silvano et al. (fig. 6b). fish species composition was more varied among ﬁshed than among no-take lakes (fig. 6a,b). those three (ﬁshed) lakes with distinctive ﬁsh assem- blages (fig. 6a,b) also showed a higher mean diversity (h¢ = 3.8) than the other 11 lakes (h¢ = 2.6) (u = 0, n = 14, p = 0.01) and a higher mean-richness (25.7 species vs. 15.4 species; u = 0, n = 14, p = 0.01). the two ﬁrst axes generated by the pca analysis of lakes according to environmental variables (tempera- ture, ph, dissolved oxygen and distance from the jaraua´ river’s mouth) had eingenvalues of 1.79 and 1.07 and accounted for 44.7% and 26.7% of the variance respectively (71.4% of the cumulative vari- ance). the resulting ordination neither revealed a distinctive pattern of lakes with peculiar characteris- tics, nor differentiated between ﬁshed and no-take lakes (fig. 6c). furthermore, the three ﬁshed-lakes that were distinct from the other with respect to their ﬁsh species composition (fig. 6a,b) were not segre- gated by the pca based on environmental conditions (fig. 6c). considering the inﬂuence of environmental vari- ables on pca analysis based on ﬁsh abundance in the lakes, the scores on the ﬁrst axis were not related to dissolved oxygen (rs = 0.13, n = 14, p = 0.67), but were positively related to the lakes’ distance (rs = 0.55, n = 14, p = 0.04). lakes’ scores on the second axis were not related to lakes’ distances (rs = 0.07, n = 14, p = 0.8), nor to dissolved oxygen (rs = )0.14, n = 14, p = 0.64). discussion fish communities we sampled ﬁsh communities through a set of gillnets with distinct mesh sizes, which are more suitable to catch open water and mobile ﬁsh in larger and deeper aquatic ecosystems (ibanez et al. 2007), such as amazonian lakes (saint-paul et al. 2000; silvano et al. 2000). indeed, most of the mobile open-water ﬁsh species are also those caught with gillnets by ﬁshermen in the studied region (maccord et al. 2007): nearly all the ﬁsh species more heavily exploited by local and regional ﬁshermen were collected (appendix s1). therefore, our sampling method is coherent with ﬁshing strategies, although ﬁshermen may use differ- ent mesh sizes and employ a higher ﬁshing effort. the 70 ﬁsh species collected comprised only a fraction of the total ﬁsh assemblage from ﬂoodplain lakes, corresponding to 24% of all 291 ﬁsh species estimated for the mamiraua´ reserve (crampton 1999). however, 20 of the ﬁsh species collected in this study were not yet recorded for the mamiraua´ reserve (appendix s1), albeit this could be at least partially attributed to changes in nomenclature. the observed 162 species-richness in this study ranged from 50% to 80% of the richness recorded in other surveys of ﬁsh communities in amazonian white-water ﬂoodplain lakes (henderson & crampton 1997; tejerina-garro et al. 1998; saint-paul et al. 2000; silvano et al. 2000; petry et al. 2003). there are usually complex relationships between environmental factors and amazon ﬁsh communities (junk et al. 1983, 1989; henderson & crampton 1997; tejerina-garro et al. 1998; crampton 1999; petry et al. 2003), and environmental parameters related to aquatic habitats may vary alongside to the manage- ment interventions (gerstner et al. 2006). the envi- ronmental parameters that we measured did not differ between ﬁshed and no-take lakes, thus not biasing our comparison between lake categories. furthermore, ﬁsh composition was not related to those measured environmental characteristics of sampled lakes. management implications contrary to other amazonian regions in brazil, the mamiraua´ reserve has not been subjected to environ- mental alterations such as deforestation, pollution or impoundments: small-scale local ﬁsheries for food and income have been the sole source of impact on ﬁsh communities there. we made a rapid and cost-effective assessment of ﬁsh communities, to provide informa- tion potentially useful to managers. contrarily to what we expected, in spite of the zoning system of lakes in mamiraua´, ﬁsh communities were not more diverse and abundant in no-take compared with ﬁshed lakes, even when comparing only the target commercial ﬁsh species. also, the composition of ﬁsh communities did not differ between the two lake categories. we also observed a higher variability in ﬁsh species composi- tion among ﬁshed lakes, which might be partially due to the higher variability among these lakes regarding their distance from the jaraua´ river mouth. the greater distance from the jaraua´ river mouth may have reduced the access of ﬁshermen to those lakes, therefore alleviating ﬁshing pressure compared with to the ﬁshing community. fisheries lakes closer management plans for amazonian’s ﬂoodplains should consider such a geographic characteristic. moreover, populations of caimans in the mamiraua reserve have been partially protected from overex- ploitation due to the inaccessibility of lakes (silveira & thorbjarnarson 1999). the ﬁshed lakes, including those more distinct lakes, also showed a higher ﬁsh diversity (fig. 2), which might be partially due to the presence of exclusive ﬁsh species. the observed lack of effects of ﬁsheries closure on ﬁsh communities in mamiraua´ might not necessarily such management actions have been mean that ineffective, as they might time to take a longer generate measurable results. the zoning system of lakes in mamiraua´ was formally implemented in 1994 (queiroz & crampton 1999), 9 years before our survey. in peruvian amazon, the abundance, diversity and biomass of ornamental ﬁshes (targeted for the aquarium trade) are lower in a more intensively exploited river compared with a river located inside a no-take reserve established about 19 years prior to the study (gerstner et al. 2006) . actual management categories of lakes in the mamiraua´ reserve may not be as distinguishable as stated by managers. the zoning system of lakes emerged from already existing conservation concepts among ﬁshing communities who were inﬂuenced by catholic missionaries (queiroz & crampton 1999). some lakes may thus have been less-intensively exploited well before 1994. on the other hand, there is evidence that some ﬁshermen, who do not fully agree with the zoning system, occasionally exploit no- take lakes (costa et al. 1999; arantes et al. 2005). however, queiroz (1999) observed in 1994 that only 14% of 205 ﬁsh landings by jaraua´ ﬁshermen are from no-take lakes. therefore, although occasional poach- ing of no-take lakes might occur in mamiraua´, we may arguably assume that no-take lakes have been less- intensively exploited than ﬁshed lakes and the degree of poaching probably did not inﬂuence our compar- ison of ﬁshed and no-take lakes. albeit several ﬁsh species move among amazonian ﬂoodplain lakes during the high-water season, either as migrating adults (junk et al. 1989; henderson & robertson 1999) or as dispersed larvae (arau´ jo-lima & oliveira 1998), we consider that such ﬁsh migra- tions did not obscure the comparison of the studied lakes. some ﬁsh may not migrate nor disperse over large distances. for example, in a ﬂoodplain lake in the amazon river, only 20 ﬁsh species out of 87 undergo lateral migrations between the river and the lake (fernandes 1997). we also sampled lakes during effects of ﬁsheries on amazon ﬁsh communities the low-water season, when ﬁsh are usually not moving and when ﬁshing pressure is most intense (queiroz 1999; maccord et al. 2007). considering the above-mentioned migrations and larval dispersion of some amazon ﬁsh species, including some commer- cial ones, such as the tambaqui (lima & goulding 1998), no-take lakes in mamiraua´ may have been exporting ﬁsh to ﬁshed lakes and the similarities in ﬁsh abundance may not be indicating a management failure at the ﬁsh community level. such process has been well documented for marine tropical reefs, where migration of adult ﬁsh (spillover) or larval dispersal (recruitment subsidy) may enhance ﬁsh populations in ﬁshed areas adjacent to reserves (gell & roberts 2003; sale et al. 2005; abesamis et al. 2006). however, ﬁsh populations could also be depleted in reserves if they are too small or ﬁshing around them is too intense (crowder et al. 2000). therefore, our results could also be indicating that both lake categories in the mamiraua´ reserve had similar and reduced ﬁsh abundance, due to an overall ﬁsh depletion. it is hard to distinguish between these two scenarios (high or low overall ﬁsh abundance in mamiraua´ reserve), due to the limited understanding about the ﬁsh-movement patterns in amazonian ﬂoodplain lakes. we thus compared ﬁsh abundance in mamiraua´ reserve to other ﬁsh surveys from the literature for amazonian white-water or clear-water lakes and rivers, sampled during the dry season with the same kind of gear (table 1). the mean catch per unit of effort (cpue) observed in mamiraua´ showed the third largest value for ﬁsh biomass. however, after excluding the data from the larger nets, which had not been employed in other studies, the cpue in mamiraua´ was the largest one regarding biomass and number of ﬁshes (table 1). furthermore, our cpue data was similar to values obtained during gillnet experimental ﬁshing in other mamiraua´ lakes 8 years before our survey (henderson & crampton 1997), indicating stable average ﬁsh table 1. mean ﬁsh abundance expressed as cpue values (g or number of ﬁsh * m)2 * h)1) from this study and from other studies in brazilian amazon. river basin source biomass number

above compar- isons suggest that the studied region was probably not over-ﬁshed yet, and the management may have been contributing to this. although there is lack of observed effects on the whole ﬁsh community, the zoning system of lakes in mamiraua´ positively affected the abundance of tamb- aqui, an important commercial ﬁsh species, which was more abundant in number and biomass in no-take lakes (fig. 5). notwithstanding the large variability on tambaqui abundance among sampled lakes, this spe- cies was the second most caught in no-take lakes (97 individuals), while only eight individuals were caught in ﬁshed lakes. such difference in management outcomes regarding ﬁsh community and target ﬁsh species is also observed in coastal reefs of kenya, where the common-based management system en- hances ﬁsh landings in managed areas, without affecting ﬁsh species diversity and ecological integrity (mcclanahan et al. 1997). this could be because of the prime goal of such co-management is to improve ﬁsheries, not to conserve biodiversity (mcclanahan et al. 1997). all tambaqui specimens that we caught in the mamiraua´ reserve were smaller than 55 cm sl (proposed size at ﬁrst maturity), thus reinforcing previous observations that no-take lakes in mamiraua reserve have been protecting juveniles of this ﬁsh (costa et al. 1999). fish landings of pirarucu in the jaraua´ sector of the mamirua´ reserve have been increasing steadily since the establishment of the zoning system, suggesting a positive effect of this management measure (queiroz & crampton 1999; arantes et al. 2005; queiroz 2005). such positive effects on the abundance of tambaqui and pirarucu may be also because of other ﬁshery regulations adopted in the mamiraua´ reserve, such as the establishment of quotas, closed ﬁshing seasons, restrictions to the use of gillnets in the ﬂoodplain lakes and exclusion of outside commercial ﬁshermen (queiroz & crampton 1999; castello 2004; maccord et al. 2007). conclusion our results indicated that no-take lakes in the mami- raua´ reserve seem to have enhanced (or at least maintained) densities of an important commercial ﬁsh, but did not affect the whole ﬁsh community. we also suggest that the zoning system could be potentially improved by protecting more distant lakes. these results should be viewed as baseline ecological data, which may be useful to monitor and to improve current common-based ﬁshery management in the mamiraua´ reserve. the rapid assessment approach adopted in the present study may also be applicable to other freshwater ﬁsheries elsewhere that tropical 164 already have or are in need of common-based management systems (begossi et al. 1999; silvano & begossi 2001; mann 1995; mcdaniel 1997; lorenzen et al. 1998; mathooko 2005).
