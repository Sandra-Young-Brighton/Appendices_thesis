ecology of freshwater fish 2009: 18: 594–602. ó 2009 john wiley & sons a ⁄ s abstract – this study of murray cod (maccullochella peelii peelii) movements in a large lowland river in south-eastern australia indicated that the species was not sedentary, but undertook complex movements that followed a seasonal pattern. while there were sedentary periods with limited home ranges and high site ﬁdelity, murray cod also under took larger movements for considerable portions of the year coinciding with its spawning schedule. this generally comprised movements (up to 130 km) from a home location in late winter and early spring to a new upstream position, followed by a rapid downstream migration typically back to the same river reach. timing of movements was not synchronous amongst individuals and variation in the scale of movements was observed between individuals, ﬁsh size, original location and years. j. d. koehn1, j. a. mckenzie1, d. j. o’mahony1, s. j. nicol1,3, j. p. o’connor1, w. g.

john.koehn@dse.vic. gov.au accepted for publication june 25, 2009 introduction for the mobility of stream ﬁshes can have profound consequences their conservation management (smithson & johnston 1999). the connectivity of habitats is thought to be critical for the long-term survival of ﬁsh populations (jungwirth et al. 2000) and knowledge of the movement patterns of stream ﬁsh is needed to manage effectively populations (gowan et al. 1994). seasonal movements are com- mon for many freshwater ﬁsh species, especially those that undertake migrations, with similar patterns being exhibited each year (lucas & baras 2001). there can, however, be considerable variation in movement patterns within ﬁsh populations (crook 2004) with differences in the movements of individual ﬁsh (white & garrott 1990) or between the sexes (parkinson et al. 1999; paragamian & kruse 2001). reasons for movement include optimization of feeding, avoidance of unfavourable conditions, colo- nisation of new habitats, optimisation of reproductive success and (for some salmonoids) nutrient enrichment of juvenile habitats (northcote 1978). movement distances and home range sizes have also been correlated to individual animal size and sex for some ﬁsh species (auer 1996; gaston & blackburn 1996; pyron 1999). consequently, movement patterns of ﬁsh cannot be understood without consideration of the species’ life history (dodson 1997) as these patterns can be related to life stage, habit, life-history strategy and environmental conditions (hutchings & morris 1985; lucas & baras 2001). such knowledge is essential for the provision of defensible scientiﬁc advice for undertaking species conservation manage- ment (caughley & gunn 1995). in australia, knowledge of movement patterns is required for the management of murray cod (maccul- lochella peelii peelii), a species distributed across most reaches of rivers in the murray-darling basin in south- eastern australia (lintermans 2007). these waterways have been signiﬁcantly degraded (murray-darling basin commission 2004) and the status of murray cod has deteriorated in parallel with this disturbance (cadwallader & gooley 1984) to the extent that it is currently listed as a threatened species under the australian federal government’s environmental 594 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00375.x protection and biodiversity conservation act (http:// www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened). in recogni- tion of this decline in murray cod and other native species, australian governments have committed to implementing management to improve the ecological health of the murray darling basin and rehabilitating native ﬁsh populations (murray-darling basin com- mission 2004). detailed knowledge of ﬁsh movements is critical for such conservation management, includ- ing the provision of ﬁsh passage as a restorative action for ﬁsh populations (mallen-cooper 1999). the study of ﬁsh movements in australian temperate lowland rivers, however, is limited (crook 2004; o’connor et al. 2005; koehn et al. 2008), although this is increasing (e.g. barrett 2008; ebner & thiem 2009). murray cod, is a large (up to 113 kg), long-lived (maximum 48 years) (lintermans 2007), apex preda- tor (ebner 2006) that utilises demersal main channel habitats dominated by instream wood (koehn 2009a,b). murray cod mature at around 5 years of age, form breeding pairs and lay adhesive eggs on hard substrata in spring, with the eggs then being guarded by the male ﬁsh (rowland 1998a). larvae hatch after approximately 5–13 days (lintermans 2007), then undergo downstream drift (humphries 2005; koehn & harrington 2006). murray cod has been considered to be a largely sedentary, non-migratory species (reynolds 1983) although a possible spawning migration was suggested by dakin & kesteven (1938). recent study has shown the movements of juvenile murray cod to be localized (jones & stuart 2007), while adults have undertaken seasonal movements (saddlier et al. 2008). assess- ments of ﬁsh movement have traditionally been undertaken using external attached tags that are reliant movements of murray cod the species (gowan et al. 1994). upon the recapture of tagged individuals, often by anglers, to determine distances moved from release locations (reynolds 1983). consequently, these meth- ods can be susceptible to biases in recapture resulting in limited capacity to measure the complete movement ecology of in previous mark–recapture studies, 69% of murray cod moved <10 km (reynolds 1983), although individual ﬁsh movements of 48 km, 214 km (reynolds 1983) and 1498 km (anon 1971) have been reported. radio- telemetry, now however, provides an effective method for collecting ﬁne scale movement and behavioural information as the movements of radio-tagged ﬁsh can be measured systematically without the need for ﬁsh recapture (e.g. o’connor et al. 2005). in this study, we use a multi-year radio-telemetry dataset collected from a large lowland river ecosystem to examine these past observations and describe the movement patterns of murray cod. methods movements of adult murray cod were studied by radio-tracking ﬁsh in the unregulated ovens river, in lake mulwala and in the regulated murray river upstream of lake mulwala (fig. 1) from 1992 to 1997. lake mulwala is a 4390 ha, shallow, man- made lake approximately 17 km long, ﬁlled by the inﬂowing unregulated ovens river (average width of 30 m) and the regulated murray river (average width 108 m) (koehn 2006). fish were captured from a 44-km reach of the ovens river downstream of wangaratta, including lake mulwala, using set- lines, drum nets or boat electroﬁshing, with capture and radio-tag implantation generally conducted lake hume 200 km fig. 1. map of study

prior to gonad develop- ment. captured murray cod of suitable size were anaes- )1 maranilò solution and had a thetized using a 5 mgæl 48–49 mhz radiotransmitter (advanced telemetry systems, isanti, mn, usa) surgically implanted into their abdominal cavity. transmitter weight never exceeded 2% of the body weight of the ﬁsh (knights & lasee 1996) in air or 1.25% of the weight in water (winter 1983) and to comply with this, only ﬁsh >450 mm total length (tl) were tagged. the surgical procedures followed schrader & jones (2000) and avoided contact with or damage to internal organs. immediately after surgery, the ﬁsh were revived and released at the point of capture. the transmitters contained a ‘mercury motion sensor’ to indicate mortality had the ﬁsh died. a summary of ﬁsh sizes, original capture locations and tracking details are given in table 1. tracking was undertaken during daylight hours and delayed for more than 1 month after implantation to avoid any non-representative behaviour from handling (guy et al. 1994). fish were tracked on approximately a monthly basis, either by boat and plane, with more frequent tracking undertaken during the spring spawn- ing season. when ﬁsh could not be located by standard boat or plane tracking (wangaratta to lake mulwala for the ovens river, and corowa to lake mulwala for the murray river), additional plane tracking was undertaken for a further 200 km upstream and down- stream. the proportion of lake ﬁsh to river ﬁsh in the sample increased over the study period. fish locations from boat tracking were determined by measurements made from river markers placed every 200 m upstream (positive number) and down- stream (negative number) of the peechelba bridge (fig. 1). once a ﬁsh was located, an anchored buoy was deployed and the distance between the buoy and nearest marker measured using a foresters hip chain. the river location was then determined from the river marker. an estimate of the distance travelled by a ﬁsh was calculated as the difference between successive locations. if the ﬁsh was located in a ﬂoodplain channel, then their position was calculated as the distance up ⁄ down this channel to the nearest conﬂu- ence with the river (measured using a foresters hip chain) and the distance from this conﬂuence to the nearest river marker. distances for locations deter- mined by plane tracking were measured from 1:50 000 maps. the accuracy of locations determined by boat was about 0.2 (±0.5 se) m, while that of locations determined by plane was about ±0.5 km in a linear direction (koehn 2006). due to the meandering river channel, this could have been a greater distance by river but was not expected to exceed 5 km. maximum upstream and downstream movement distances were calculated for each individual ﬁsh for each month. movements for each ﬁsh were zeroed to their capture site. data were analysed for 34 ﬁsh (23 from the ovens river and 11 from lake mulwala) located a total of 1633 times, 57% of which were obtained by plane (table 1). in 1992, only boat tracking was used, with greater numbers of locations determined by plane in 1993–1995. individual ﬁsh were tracked from 2 to 48 months. four ﬁsh were tracked for more than three consecutive years. fish were excluded from some analyses if records (<5), suspected transmitter failure, disappearance or capture by anglers. the size range of the ﬁsh tracked was 462– 1230 mm tl and 1400–32200 g. attempts to deter- mine the sex of the ﬁsh by inspection of the gonads during surgery were often inconclusive as capture and surgery was generally undertaken when gonads were less developed. sex was determined for a total 10 individuals (ﬁve males and ﬁve females, table 1). there were insufﬁcient the movement history of each ﬁsh was evaluated to identify periods of sedentary behaviour and site ﬁdelity, periods of larger movements and to determine the extent of any movements. as the error associated with aircraft tracking could be up to 5 km, we excluded these data from the determination of small- scale movements. ‘home’ sites were deﬁned as locations where a ﬁsh was recorded on four or more successive trackings within a 50-m river reach. large- scale movement distances were calculated from data where movements were >5 km upstream or down- stream. mean and median movement distances were calculated for each of these groups. fish were assigned as ‘lake’ or ‘river’ depending on their ‘home’ location. fish that may have been captured in the ovens river but later returned to lake mulwala were considered to table 1. summary details of murray cod ﬁtted with radio-transmitters with tag and tracking statistics. length (tl cm) weight (kg) sex tag duration (months) number of

undertaken only for the year of capture to avoid errors due to subsequent ﬁsh growth. ancova was used to examine the inﬂuence of ﬁsh size and home location and distance moved. to facilitate the com- parison between individuals which were tracked for different lengths of time, the distance moved for each individual was standardized by dividing total distance moved by the number of days the individual was tracked (i.e., if a ﬁsh was tracked for over 12 months table 2. ancova table for the model ‘standardised total distance moved (for 1 year since tagging) = home location + ﬁsh length + home location*ﬁsh length’. movements of murray cod the total distance moved in the ﬁrst year was divided by 366; if the ﬁsh was tracked for a period <1 year then the total distance moved was divided by the number of days between the ﬁrst and last tracking record). a t-test was used to test for difference in the standardised distance moved and ﬁsh sex. the resid- uals were examined after the ancova and t-test to check that the data satisﬁed the assumptions of each statistical model. the effect of month and year on large scale movement was examined using a random effects logistic regression. we ﬁtted this model using win- bugs (spiegelhalter et al. 2000) using vague normal priors for the main effects with means of zero and variances of 10 000 and a vague gamma prior for r2

an upstream and downstream direction during the period from late august to january (fig. 3). the most commonly observed pattern of movement behaviour (observed in 53% of individuals at least once) during this period was ﬁsh moving upstream, establishing a temporary home location and then moving back downstream (fig. 4). the average time spent during this ‘august–january home site’ was 42 days for lake ﬁsh and 58 days for river ﬁsh. in 83% of observations where individuals exhibited this pattern of movement, the ﬁsh returned to its pre-departure location (±2.5 km). other ﬁsh overshot their original position (17%) on their return journey to occupy a new location up to several kilometres away, returned to a different position, remained upstream in the murray river or appeared unable to ﬁnd any ‘home’ site in the following year. several ﬁsh appeared to spend time at interim locations during their upstream migra- tion. some rapid movements were observed. the fastest downstream migration reported involved one individ- ual moving 90 km in <20 days. one ﬁsh was recorded for several hours travelling at a consistent rate of about fig. 4. movement records obtained over a 12-month period that demonstrate the typical upstream then downstream large scale movements undertaken by a murray cod from the ovens river. )1, a speed faster than the river current at the 2 kmæh time. for the remaining 47% of ﬁsh where this ‘upstream then downstream’ movement behaviour was not detected, the individuals either did not move >5 km (26%) or only an upstream or downstream movement >5 km was detected (21%). examples of the different types of movement patterns are shown in fig. 5. twelve ﬁsh were tracked between 2 and 4 years and 75% of these individuals demonstrated alternate behaviours between years. similar movement patterns were, however, occurred between years (koehn 2006). )1) throughout patterns of movement with environmental corre- lates, such as river ﬂow were not detected in this study. flows in the unregulated ovens river varied consid- erably (10–40 000 mlæday the study, with high ﬂoods in august–november in 1992 and 1993 but low ﬂows in 1994 and 1995. the regulated murray river had less variable ﬂows but showed a similar inter-annual pattern to the ovens river over these years (see also koehn & harrington 2006; koehn 2009b).

daugherty & sutton 2005). upstream, spring pre-spawning migrations have also been described for a range of species (tyus 1985; koed et al. 2000) with distances of over 200 km reported (tyus 1985). the timing of the murray cod upstream movement coincided with the period imme- is plausible that diately prior to spawning in the ovens river (koehn & harrington 2006) and it this movement was related to pre-spawning activity. fur- thermore, murray cod larvae are known to undergo a drift phase immediately after hatching (humphries 2005; koehn & harrington 2006) and this upstream movement may be a mechanism to compensate for the downstream drift of larvae. hence the movements of adults may be a key life-history requirement. large ‘round-trip’ movements similar to those observed for murray cod have been recorded for other ﬁsh in large rivers (tyus 1985; o’connor et al. 2005). the downstream movements of murray cod, which occurred mainly in december ⁄ january, were more rapid than the upstream migrations. in north america, )1) downstream movements by rapid (up to 91 kmæday post-spawning ﬁsh have been reported for white sturgeon acipenser transmontanus j. but were often suggested to be passive, rather than active (schaffter 1997) and had been noted to be concurrent with increased ﬂows (kieffer & kynard 1993). patterns of movement with environmental correlates, such as ﬂow were not detected in our study, although murray cod did move into ﬂoodplain channels when they were ﬂowing and two ﬁsh were observed on the ﬂoodplain (koehn 2009b). 599 koehn et al. a common difﬁculty in studying long-distance movements is the wide variation in the movement patterns of individuals (white & garrott 1990; rodri- guez 2002). there was considerable variation in the movements of individual murray cod, with differences in timing and travel distances. major variations in movements could be attributed to several key factors. one major source of variation in movements was the ‘home’ location of the individual, with ﬁsh from lake mulwala travelling greater distances than ﬁsh from the river. some of these movements were to the upper reaches of the lake, while others were movements up the considerable distances. upstream migrations of lake ﬁsh to spawn in inﬂow- ing rivers are common for many species (scott & crossman 1973; silva & davies 1986; palstra et al. 2004; de graaf et al. 2005). not all murray cod left the lake for each spawning season, however, and as murray cod are known to spawn in ponds (rowland 1998a), such movements are unlikely to be necessary for spawning to occur. the observed increasing proportion of ﬁsh undertaking movements in each year is likely to be attributed an increased proportion of lake ﬁsh to river ﬁsh in those years. inﬂowing rivers for variation in movement was also attributed to ﬁsh size. the movement patterns for river ﬁsh >650 mm tl were substantially different to those <650 mm tl. there is considerable variation in the growth rates of murray cod with the possibility that not all ﬁsh >500 mm tl may be mature (anderson et al. 1992; rowland 1998b). consequently, it may be inferred that ﬁsh <650 mm tl may not have been mature and if movement is related to spawning this may explain their different behaviour. in a radio-tagging study conducted over 3 months, juvenile murray cod (likely to be 3-year-old ﬁsh) were found to have limited movements with a mean range of 318 ± 345 m and maximum total linear range of 864 m (jones & stuart 2007). the observation of larger ﬁsh moving greater distances than smaller ﬁsh has been demonstrated in a number of studies for other ﬁsh species (auer 1996; diana et al. 2004) but explanations for this difference have not been explored. there were also unexplained variations from the general movement pattern undertaken by individual murray cod. a minority of ﬁsh showed contrary behaviours, remaining at ‘home’ sites and not migrat- ing in some seasons, while others remained at presumed spawning sites for a considerable time or undertook unexpected ‘stray’ movements. this type of variation in behaviour is not uncommon in the literature (jackson 1980; gangl et al. 2000; knights et al. 2002; vokoun & rabeni 2005). several murray cod also appeared to switch between migratory and sedentary behaviours between years, a behaviour that has also been reported in brown_trout salmo_trutta (l.) 600 (harcup et al. 1984). it has been observed that not all murray cod spawn every year under hatchery condi- tions (brett ingram, dpi, victoria, personal commu- nication) and while it is not known if this also occurs in the wild, variability in spawning behaviour could explain changes in movement patterns. the migrations of murray cod were asynchronous across the 34 tested ﬁsh, usually beginning in mid-july until late october, although initial movements were recorded in december and january. the return migra- tions of murray cod also occurred individually, from early november until late march, and often exhibited overshooting and backtracking as described by hasler & scholz (1983) before usually settling at the original ‘home’ area. there was no apparent difference in the upstream travel these sites between male and female murray cod. assuming that the radio-tagged ﬁsh did spawn during this study, then this period presumably included time spent guarding the eggs by the male ﬁsh (rowland 1998a), and suggested that the female ﬁsh may also have remained near the ‘spawning’ site. as murray cod spawn in pairs at individual sites rather than in aggregations at common locations, this possibly negates the need for synchrony of spawning migrations. times or time spent at our observations have important implications for the conservation management of murray cod and the restoration of populations the murray-darling basin. having an informed model of ﬁsh movements is imperative for providing adequate ﬁsh passage (barrett & mallen-cooper 2006), and is a key component to plan river restoration (palmer et al. 2005). this new information, documenting movement patterns of adult murray cod, shows that our previous concepts of the movements of this species were over-simplistic. the timing, spatial extent and variability of these observed movement patterns (between individual ﬁsh and between seasons) should be incorporated into the future conservation actions for murray cod in large lowland rivers. management strategies should appro- priately recognise a more complex movement model that includes large scale movements in both upstream and downstream directions and into anabranch (ﬂood- plain) channels, pathways that are often blocked by structures such as regulators and levee banks (jones & stuart 2008). importantly, our observations also included large individuals (>1200 mm length and 32 kg weight), and ﬁshway infrastructure needs to be designed for the passage of these large ﬁsh. acknowledgements the authors wish to thank brian lawrence and jim barrett (murray-darling basin commission), alistair brown and tim o’brien (department of sustainability and environment) and graeme watson and graeme coulson (university of melbourne) for their support of this work. technical and ﬁeld support was provided by des harrington, john mahoney, russell strongman, peter fairbrother and others. john eiler (noaa, alaska) provided advice on radio-tracking gear and angus cunningham provided veterinary advice and training. aerial radio-tracking was undertaken by pilots from the wangaratta aero club. graeme coulson, ivor stuart and david crook provided valuable comments and review of the manuscript prior to submission. this research was funded by the murray-darling basin com- mission and the department of sustainability and environment, victoria and conducted under victorian fisheries scientiﬁc permit number fsp ⁄ cw ⁄ 020(5), flora and fauna guarantee act licence number f ⁄ 1994 ⁄ 003, nsw fisheries permit number f93 ⁄ 158 and the university of melbourne animal experimen- tation ethics committee register number 98089. references anderson, j.r., morison, a.k. & ray, d.j. 1992. age and growth of murray cod maccullochella peelii (perciformes: percichthyidae), in the lower murray-darling basin, austra- lia, from thin-sectioned otoliths. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 43: 983–1012. anon. 1971. murray cod takes the long distance title. the fisherman spring: 24. auer, n.a. 1996. importance of habitat and migration to sturgeons with emphasis on lake sturgeon. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 53(suppl. 1): 152–160. barrett, j.
