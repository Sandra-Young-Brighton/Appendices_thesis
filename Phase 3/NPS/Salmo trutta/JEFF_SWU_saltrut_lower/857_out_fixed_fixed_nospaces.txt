(1996) applied the concept of the operational conservation unit (ocu) to a. iberus to describe ‘a continuous area limited by geographical boundaries, and inhabited by one or more populations sharing the same genetic pattern’. in that paper, they described ﬁve a. iberus ocus: catalonian (ocu-1), levantine (ocu-2), murcian (ocu-3), atlantic (ocu-4) and villena (ocu-5). the villena ocu, located in an isolated endorrheic freshwater lagoon, represented the single inland population of the species; unfortunately, that population is now extinct in the wild (doadrio 2001). later analyses indicated that the atlantic ocu (guadalquivir river collections) belonged to a clearly differentiated lineage (perdices et al. 2001), recently described as the new species aphanius baeticus (doadrio et al. 2002). the atlantic and villena ocus accounted for the largest values of genetic differenti- ation reported in doadrio et al. (1996); once they are doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00217.x 257 araguas et al. excluded, the genetic structure of the remnant popu- lations of a. iberus is simpliﬁed (fst ¼ 0.238). in this work, we review the genetic conservation policy of a. iberus after 10 years of ocu manage- ment. we study the spatial structure of native a. iberus populations within the three remnant ocus. we also used an assignment to determine the putative native source of reintroduced populations in the northeastern range of a. iberus distribution. test material and methods sampling fourteen locations of a. iberus were collected from six marshlands on the mediterranean coast of the iberian peninsula (table 1, fig. 1) to analyse temporal and spatial components of genetic diversity in the species’ distribution area. in addition, from february 1989 to january 1990 approximately monthly sampling occurred in la rubina lagoon; all ﬁshes collected in this lagoon were aged following garcı´a-berthou & moreno-amich (1992). although a. iberus was extinguished from several lagoons, some reintroduc- tions from unofﬁcial stocks maintained by aquarists have occurred since 1994 (moreno-amich et al. table 1. collections of aphanius iberus in mediterranean marshlands. sampled areas collections native populations aiguamolls de l’emporda` marshland ocu-1 1-la rubina 2-la serpa 3-la rogera 4a-fra ramon 88 4b-fra ramon 89 5-salou salou marshland ocu-2 delta de l’ebre marshland ocu-2 6-rec canal vell 7-canal vell 8a-la tancada 88 8b-la tancada 89 9-gola de migjorn 10-albuixec stock albuixec marshland ocu-2 santa pola marshland ocu-3 mar menor marshland ocu-3 11-santa pola reintroduced populations 12-alca´zares 13-marchamalo 14-san pedro 15-remolar 16-torredembarra 17-salou 18-estany podrit 19-llastres 20-torrent del pi n 33 12 68 49 41 37 85 110 20 139 23 25 50 73 90 100 15 11 100 100 100 95 1999). therefore, we analysed collections from six reintroduced populations (designated populations 15– 20 table 1, fig. 1) to determine their putative origin. genetic analyses on native populations electrophoresis and procedures for visualising 17 presumptive loci followed the methods outlined in garcı´a-marı´n et al. (1991). the loci screened were: ak* (adenilate kinase, ec 2.7.4.3); ck-1*, -2*, -3* (creatine kinase, ec 2.7.3.2); gpi-1*, -2* (glucose-6- phosphate isomerase, ec 5.3.1.9); idhp-1* (isocitrate dehydrogenase, ec 1.1.1.42); ldh-1*, -2*, -3* (l- lactate dehydrogenase, ec 1.1.1.27); mdh-2* (malate dehydrogenase, ec 1.1.1.37); mpi* (mannose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase, ec 5.3.1.8); pep-d* (peptidase-d, phe-ala-pro substrate, ec 3.4.13.11); pep-s* (peptidase-s, leu-tyr substrate, ec 3.4.–.–); pgdh* dehydrogenase, ec 1.1.1.44); pgm* (phosphoglucomutase, ec 5.4.2.2) and sod* (superoxide dismutase, ec 1.15.1.1). however, the temporal samples from la rubina were only screened for variation at the three loci (ak*, idhp* and pgm*) previously reported to be poly- morphic in this population (garcı´a-marı´n et al. 1990). all loci were codominantly expressed, permitting (phosphogluconate date na he 11/10/88 10/17/89 10/17/89 11/18/88 08/29/89 10/06/89 10/05/89 10/05/89 07/19/88 10/05/89 07/20/88 1991 1991 1991 1991 1991 11/19/98 07/01/00 11/19/98 07/01/00 11/26/98 11/19/98 1.3 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.2 (0.1) 1.3 (0.2) 1.2 (0.1) 1.3 (0.1) 1.2 (0.1) 1.3 (0.2) 1.3 (0.1) 1.3 (0.2) 1.3 (0.1) 1.2 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.2 (0.1) 1.3 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.1 (0.1) 1.0 (0.0) 1.4 (0.1) 0.040 (0.030) 0.058 (0.039) 0.089 (0.048) 0.052 (0.031) 0.089 (0.046) 0.056 (0.034) 0.078 (0.041) 0.058 (0.034) 0.050 (0.032) 0.059 (0.039) 0.050 (0.031) 0.051 (0.027) 0.040 (0.026) 0.014 (0.011) 0.028 (0.018) 0.032 (0.024) 0.022 (0.022) 0.025 (0.025) 0.031 (0.028) 0.006 (0.005) 0.000 (0.000) 0.033 (0.021) p0.05 11.8 11.8 17.7 17.7 17.7 17.7 17.7 11.8 11.8 11.8 11.8 17.7 11.8 5.9 11.8 11.8 5.9 5.9 5.9 0 0 11.8 n, sample size; na, number of alleles by locus; he, expected heterozygosity; p0.05, proportion of polymorphic loci (95% criterion). standard error appears in brackets. populations were related to ocus according to doadrio et al. 1996. 258 management of gene diversity in aphanius iberus fig. 1. geographical locations of aphanius iberus samples (ﬁlled circles) and opera- tional conservation units (ocus) in the studied region. sample numbers refer to table 1. ocu-1, -2 and -3 were deﬁned by doadrio et al.

(1996) at the top of the hierarchy instead of the marshes. the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (upgma)-tree generated by doadrio et al. 1996, which was constructed from roger’s distance matrix, distinguished two major groups of a. iberus populations in the mediterranean lagoons: the central or levantine group and the rest of the populations that were related with geographical or ecologically marginal areas. therefore, we used gene diversity to evaluate the hypothesis that central and marginal groups exist. genetic analyses on reintroduced populations we tested for recent population bottlenecks in the reintroduced populations using the bottleneck 1.2 program (piry et al. 1999). the program checks for heterozygosity excess as a consequence of a genetic bottleneck for loci evolving under the inﬁnite allele model. a wilcoxon-signed ranks test indicates if a majority of loci with signiﬁcant heterozygosity excess 259 araguas et al. exists relative to a population having the same number of alleles in mutation-drift equilibrium. this analysis was also performed on the albuixec stock. we used an assignment test (geneclass 2, piry et al. 2004) to determine the putative sources of the six reintroduced populations of ﬁsh (15–20), which were unknown. for reference we used ﬁve known baseline populations constructed as follows: aiguamolls (ocu- 1) and delta (ocu-2) consisted of pooled genotypic data from the most recent samples collected in the respective lagoons of these two marshes (see table 1). the murcian (ocu-3) baseline population pooled genotypic data from the murcian ocu deﬁned in doadrio et al. (1996) (11-santa pola,12-alca´zares, 13- marchamalo and 14-san pedro). albuixec was the 10- albuixec stock, which originated from a population that is now extinct and was used by the autonomous government of valencia to reintroduce a. iberus in some marshlands assigned to ocu-2. because most of the reintroductions were in lagoons between the marshlands of the aiguamolls de l’emporda` and delta de l’ebre (fig. 1), we added a ﬁfth baseline population based on the genotypic data we obtained for the ancestral native population of the 5-salou lagoon, the single lagoon between the two marshlands that con- tained native populations at the beginning of our work (doadrio et al. 1996). we used the cavalli-sforza & edwards (1967) distance method to assign individuals to the ‘closest’ population. the simulation option of geneclass was used for assessing the probability of each reintroduced specimen being derived or rejected from the reference populations. results genetic variability within collections revealed signiﬁcant departures we detected allelic variation at 11 of the 17 protein- coding loci examined (table 2). only eight out of ﬁfty comparisons from hardy–weinberg expectations, and these were reduced to two after sequential bonferroni adjustment (mdh- 2* locus in 11-santa pola and 13-marchamalo collec- tions). the number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.0 in the reintroduced 19-llastres population to 1.4 in the 20-torrent del pi lagoon, which contained only reintroduced ﬁsh (table 1). thus, the monomorphic 19-llastres population exhibited the lowest levels of variability in both expected heterozygosity and pro- portion of polymorphic loci. in contrast, two native populations (3-la rogera and 4b-fra ramon 89) from the studied area showed the highest levels of variab- ility (he ¼ 0.089 and p0.05 ¼ 17.7). overall, mann– whitney u-tests indicated that genetic variability, measured either as the number of alleles (p ¼ 0.034), 260 the expected heterozygosity (p < 0.001), or the (p < 0.001), was proportion of polymorphic loci signiﬁcantly reduced in reintroduced populations. the reduced number of polymorphic loci observed in the reintroduced populations prevented deﬁnitive conclusions from bottleneck analyses. in the four least polymorphic of these (15-remolar, 16-torre- dembarra, 17-salou, and 18-estany podrit), only six comparisons for heterozygosity excess could be per- formed. three out of these six analyses indicated a heterozygosity excess relative to a population in mutation-drift equilibrium and having the same num- ber of alleles. the variability levels in the 20-torrent del pi population were similar to those observed in native populations, which allowed six comparisons. a wilcoxon signed-ranks test revealed no excess of heterozygosity (p ¼ 0.922). similarly, a wilcoxon test yielded no evidence for a bottleneck in the 10-albuixec stock (p ¼ 0.062). in samples collected monthly in la rubina lagoon (data not shown), signiﬁcant allele frequency ﬂuctu- ations were only obtained for locus ak*, but the average fst value ()0.021) was not signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.0703). when grouping all ﬁsh collected in this lagoon into their respective cohort (1987, 1988 and 1989), reduced fst and not signiﬁcant compari- sons between cohorts were obtained (1987 vs. 1988, fst ¼ )0.0030, p ¼ 0.826, and 1988 vs. 1989 fst ¼ 0.0065, p ¼ 0.191). these results suggest temporal stability and relative large population sizes of the a. iberus in this marginal lagoon. spatial structure signiﬁcant allele divergences among a. iberus popu- lations were observed in six (ak*, gpi-1*, idhp*, mdh-2*, pgdh* and pgm*) out of 11 polymorphic loci. the 3-la rogera and 11-santa pola lagoons exhibited the highest genetic differentiation, measured either as dce or fst. in fact, nj tree showed the 11- santa pola lagoon as the most distinct a. iberus population of our study (fig. 2) mainly by diagnostic variation in mdh-2* (table 2). the remaining pop- ulations mainly grouped along a latitudinal gradient. gene diversity analyses (table 3) revealed that the spatial components of genetic diversity were substan- tially greater than the temporal ones. the differenti- ation among populations within marginal or central groups was larger (20.3%) than the differentiation between these two groups (4.3%). some alleles were distributed among a. iberus populations in accordance with geographical entities — gpi-1*70 and idhp- 1*200 in aiguamolls de l’emporda`; pgm*200 in delta de l’ebre and mdh-2*0 in santa pola (table 2, see also doadrio et al. 1996; perdices et al. 2001) — suggesting the present isolation of those entities. this management of gene diversity in aphanius iberus 0 0 0 . 1 0 0 0 . 1 – – 5

(1996) after removing the guadalquivir river collections, now considered to be the new species a. baeticus, and the ecologically divergent villena population (fst ¼ 0.238). the ana- lysis based on the ocus deﬁned by doadrio et al. (1996) also indicated that some of their ocus included highly differentiated populations as indicated by the similar proportion of diversity within (11.2%) and between ocus (13.4%). overall, signiﬁcant (fst ¼ 0.247), divergences mainly reﬂected divergence among marshlands. populations among origin of introduced populations our assignment analysis was limited by low diver- gence among native populations (table 4). thus, only the aiguamolls specimens were assigned correctly in high proportion (83.8%) to their baseline population, while relatively moderate proportions (around 50%) of individuals from the other reference samples were assigned to their original group. notably, individuals from delta de l’ebre were assigned in similar proportion to their original source (35.3%) and to the native salou population (39.5%) and mainly rejected from the albuixec stock (38.1%). however, doadrio et al. (1996) originally included the three marshlands (salou, delta de l’ebre and albuixec) under the same ocu. unfortunately, the limited resolution of the assignment test made it difﬁcult to infer the origin of the reintroduced populations. in some cases the assignment for the most probable source was not clearly different from assignment to alternative origins (table 4). as a practical rule, we considered that the most probable source for reintroduction was the baseline population showing the largest difference between the assigned and rejected proportion of ﬁsh. it should be noted that the actual population in 20- torrent del pi originated from alien ﬁsh (murcian baseline, ocu-3) and the 10-albuixec stock was not involved in the reintroduction undertaken in this area. discussion status of the species aphanius iberus is listed as endangered (en) by the red list of freshwater fish of spain (doadrio 2001). however, since 1996, the red list of the iucn considered a. iberus in data deﬁcient category: ‘a taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abun- dance and/or distribution are lacking’. in this sense, during the last 10 years, distribution of a. iberus has been severely reduced because of the recognition of guadalquivir river populations as a new species, . x e d n i n o i t a x ﬁ , f ; s e i t i l i b a b o r p t c a x e g n s u i t s e t i e c n a c ﬁ n g s m u i r b i i l i u q e i g r e b n e w – y d r a h , w – h ; s t i n u n o i t a v r e s n o c l a n o i t a r e p o , s u c o management of gene diversity in aphanius iberus is worsened by the fact that cyprinodontid ﬁsh, like other brackish water species, display low levels of within population genetic variability (maltagliati 1998). the level of diversity found in our study of a. iberus (table 1) was lower than previously reported for a. iberus (doadrio et al. 1996;perdices et al. 2001) and a. baeticus (scho¨nhuth et al. 2003) but similar to that observed in its european counterpart, aphanius fasciatus (maltagliati 1999). spatial structure the level of population diversity is not the only factor to be considered when designing management programmes. the particular genes producing the observed diversity also are important because they may be related to particular population processes or meaningful evolutionary events (hurt & hedrick 2004). diversiﬁcation of the genus aphanius resulted mostly from vicariant processes that lead to restricted gene ﬂow between geographical areas; however, factors may also have been at work ecological (hrbek & meyer 2003). aphanius iberus, like a. fasciatus colonises both saline (brackish) and perma- nently freshwater the pattern of population divergence may reﬂect either the isolation of populations or the occasional opportunity to colonise free habitats. the strong genetic divergence of the villena population (doadrio et al. 1996, ferna´ndez-pedrosa et al. 1995), for example, appar- ently reﬂects its ecological divergence (perdices et al. 2001). lagoons. thus, our hierarchical gene diversity analyses suggest that a more or less homogeneous group inhabited the central region of a. iberus’s range (levantine ocu-2 according to doadrio et al. (1996), while the respect- ive genomes for marginal areas (catalonian ocu-1 and murcian ocu-3) originated from more or less independent processes. this suggests that population divergence occurred via isolation-by-distance accord- ing to a stepping-stone model, although in some cases (e.g., 11-santa pola) gene pools may reﬂect local ecological responses. such a pattern was also detected fig. 2. unrooted population tree (neighbour–joining) clustering 14 native aphanius iberus samples according to the cavalli-sforza and to the edwards’ percentage of 1000 bootstrap replications.

(1996) needs to be redeﬁned with an eye towards more detailed recognition of marshland isolation (table 3). the singularity of the santa pola population suggests its classiﬁcation as a new ocu, distinct from the murcian one and probably involving nearby populations. nevertheless, the singularity of the santa pola popu- lation did not fully explain the high diversity within ocus (table 3). we propose a new ocu structure that takes into account the genetic singularity of some of the marsh- lands (roman numbers in fig. 1). the assignment test supports maintaining the aiguamolls populations as a separate ocu (ocu-i), and to this unit it incorporates the reintroduced population from the delta del llobre- gat marshes (15-remolar). however, the original ocu- 2 and ocu-3 described by doadrio et al. (1996) are divided into several new conservation units; now salou, delta de l’ebre and albuixec are recognised as individual sources (table 4). thus, we consider the reintroduced populations related to the ancestral salou gene pool (16-torredembarra, 17-salou, 18-estany podrit, and 19-llastres) as a single unit (ocu-ii). we also distinguish the native a. iberus populations in delta de l’ebre (ocu-iii) from the remaining levantine populations (ocu-iv), here typiﬁed by 10-albuixec stock. the 11-santa pola population is the new ocu-v, and all mar menor populations are assigned to ocu-vi. our proposed ocu structure also facilitates the political management of a. iberus populations: ocu-i, ii, and iii are from the catalonian community, ocu-iv and v are distributed in the valencia community, and ocu-vi is located in the murcian community. all three commu- nities have an autonomous government with full jurisdiction over marshland conservation. south- ward, the a. iberus populations from adra river in the andalucian community probably merit their own spe- ciﬁc ocu status (ocu-vii), based on some genetic distinction described by perdices et al. (2001). the management of wildlife requires the frequent evaluation of short-term management initiatives as recently maltagliati (2002) show to be effective in a. fasciatus populations. genetic approaches, such as the ones we used, that are not based on models of long- time evolutionary stability can help in the reevaluation of existing genetic data and also in making new decisions to improve conservation without increased expenses. acknowledgements this research was supported in part by a life project; contract b4-3200/96/502 (through darp, autonomous government of catalonia, spain). two reviewers provided constructive com- ments on the manuscript. management of gene diversity in aphanius iberus references cavalli-sforza, l.l. & edwards, a.w.f. 1967. phylogenetic analysis: models and estimation procedures. evolution 32: 550–570. chakraborty, r., haag m., ryman, n. & sta˚hl, g. 1982. hierarchical gene diversity and its application to brown_trout population data. hereditas 97: 17–21. doadrio, i. 2001. atlas y libro rojo de los peces continentales de espan˜a. direccio´ n general de conservacio´n de la naturaleza-museo nacional de ciencias naturales. spain, madrid: csic/mimam. doadrio, i., perdices, a. & machordom, a. 1996. allozymic variation of the endangered killﬁsh aphanius iberus and its application to conservation. environmental biology of fishes 45: 259–271. doadrio, i., carmona, j.a. & ferna´ndez-delgado, c. 2002. morphometric study of the iberian aphanius (actinopterygii, cyprinodontiformes), with description of a new species. folia zoologica 51: 67–79. felsenstein, j. 1993. phylip (phylogeny inference package) version 3.5c. department of genetics. seattle: university of washington. ferna´ndez-pedrosa, v., gonza´lez, a., planelles, m., moya, a. & latorre, a. 1995. mitochondrial dna variability in three mediterranean populations of aphanius iberus. biological conservation 72: 251–256. garcı´a-berthou, e. & moreno-amich, r. 1992. age and growth of an iberian cyprinodont, aphanius iberus (cuv. and val.), in its most northerly populations. journal of fish biology 40: 929–937. garcı´a-berthou, e, & moreno-amich, r. 1993. multivariate analysis of covariance in morphometric studies of the reproductive cycle. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 50: 1394–1399. garcı´a-berthou, e. & moreno-amich, r. 1999. ecologı´a y conservacio´ n del fartet (lebias ibera) en las marismas del ampurda´n (catalun˜a). in: planelles-gomis, m., ed. peces ciprinodo´ntidos ibe´ricos fartet y samaruc. valencia, spain: generalitat valenciana, conselleria de medio ambiente, pp. 151–161. garcı´a-marı´n, j.l., vila, a. & pla, c. 1990. genetic variation in the iberian toothcarp, aphanius iberus (cuvier, and valenciennes). journal of fish biology 37: 233–234. garcı´a-marı´n, j.l., jorde, p.e., ryman, n., utter, f.m. & pla, c. 1991. management implications of genetic differentiation between native and hatchery populations of brown_trout (salmo_trutta) in spain. aquaculture 95: 235–249. hrbek, t. & meyer, a. 2003. closing of the tethys sea and the phylogeny of eurasian killiﬁshes (cyprinodontiformes: cyprinodontidae). journal of evolutionary biology 16: 17– 36. hurt, c. & hedrick, p. 2004. conservation genetic in aquatic species: general approaches and case studies in ﬁshes and springsnails of arid lands. aquatic science 66: 402–413. maltagliati, f. 1998. does the mediterranean killiﬁsh aphanius fasciatus (teleostei: cyprinodontidae) ﬁt the one-dimen- sional stepping-stone model of gene ﬂow?
