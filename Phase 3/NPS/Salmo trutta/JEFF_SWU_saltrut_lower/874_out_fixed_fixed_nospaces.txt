however, the form and extent of life history depends on (ii) season and (iii) life history. for individuals that adopt a smolt life history, trade-offs between freshwater survival and sea survival may lead to a convergent growth pattern, as they approach the smolt migration window. key words: atlantic salmon; compensatory growth; depensatory growth; parr; size-dependent growth; smolt introduction size-dependent growth (sdg) has long interested ecologists both in terms of identifying the underlying causes and understanding the consequences in nature (pfister & stevens 2002; bystr€om & andersson 2005). in populations of freshwater fish, there are a number of processes that may lead to the manifesta- tion of sdg. for example, ontogenetic shifts from planktivory to piscivory may lead to positive sdg where larger fish grow faster than smaller fish effec- tively increasing size variation in the population (persson & br€onmark 2002). alternatively, the scal- ing of foraging relationships may give smaller fish an advantage leading to negative sdg where smaller fish have a growth advantage (bystr€om & andersson 2005). in addition, compensatory growth has been well established in many fish species where individu- als will respond to periods of growth depression by accelerating growth, which can also result in a nega- tive sdg pattern (ali et al. 2003; nicieza & alvarez 2009) further complicating matters is variation in life history, which may also play a role in influencing the relationship between size and growth. for example, two individuals of a similar size may choose to grow or not based on a genetically predetermined life his- tory pathway (metcalfe 1998). in such cases, we may expect the form and intensity of sdg to be life correspondence: douglas b. sigourney, department of environmental conservation, university of massachusetts, amherst, ma 01003, usa. e-mail: douglas. sigourney@maine.edu *present address: department of wildlife ecology, university of maine, nutting hall, orono, me 04469, usa doi: 10.1111/eff.12042 495 sigourney et al. history dependent. despite the importance of sdg, empirical studies investigating the causes of sdg are lacking in the literature (peacor et al. 2007). in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), size and growth can interact with life history decisions in complex ways to influence freshwater growth patterns of juve- niles. early in ontogeny factors such as prior resi- dence and aggressive behaviour can result in a depensatory effect with more dominant fish segregat- ing into an upper size mode and subordinate fish entering a lower size mode (thorpe 1977; kristinsson et al. 1985; nicieza et al. 1991). later in ontogeny, larger fish usually transition to the smolt stage and migrate to sea at an earlier age than smaller slow- growing fish that remain in the juvenile parr stage for an additional year (metcalfe & thorpe 1992; whalen & parrish 1999). many of the parr that defer early migration are comprised of males that mature in freshwater during the parr stage (myers 1984). the growth dynamics of these two life histories can differ dramatically with the larger smolts showing a propen- sity to maintain fast growth overwinter, while smaller parr may defer growth (metcalfe et al. 1986; simp- son et al. 1996). the decision to grow can trade-off with survival as growth often requires risky foraging (nicieza & metcalfe 1999). although this strong correlation between growth rate and life history decisions results in a positive sdg pattern among life history groups in atlantic salmon, it is less clear how the form and intensity of sdg varies within life history groups. there is some evidence from the laboratory that although both groups will undergo a compensatory growth response when their growth rates are manipulated, the intensity of the response is stronger in smolts suggesting a life history-dependent sdg response (nicieza & metcalfe 1997). the degree to which such life history-depen- dent patterns exist under natural conditions has been less studied in the literature. there is some evidence from spanish rivers that smaller smolts will increase growth prior to the smolt window (nicieza & bra~na 1993; utrilla & lobon-cervia 1999). however, it is unclear from these studies whether this apparent com- pensatory effect is achieved through increased growth or delayed migration, and whether or not this poten- tial life history strategy is common in other systems or unique to spanish populations. understanding the interaction between sdg and life history could play an important role in the devel- opment of state-dependent life history models that predict life history decisions based on an individual’s current state (e.g., size) and expected change in state (e.g., growth rate) (thorpe et al. 1998; mangel & satterthwaite 2008). for example, thorpe et al. (1998) developed a proximate model for atlantic sal- mon that predicts what pathway an individual will 496 it smaller to be successful, however, choose based on its size and growth rate during sen- sitive ‘decision windows’ (metcalfe 1998). in order for such a model is important to identify the full range of individual strat- egies particularly with regard to how the interaction between state (size) and changes in state (growth rate) can influence life history pathways. for exam- ple, as the smolt window approaches smaller individ- uals may accelerate growth and join the smolt class or defer costly growth and remain in the river for an additional year. similarly, smolts could migrate at the same age but delay migration in the spring until they have reached an adequate size by migrating later in the year. the extent to which indi- viduals choose one pathway or the other could deter- mine annual variability in smolt production and parr maturity and potentially the overall fitness of differ- ent cohorts. future development of life history- dependent models will require further investigations from field studies to understand and estimate the extent of life history-dependent parameters such as growth rates and survival (satterthwaite et al. 2009). whether or not sdg is a common phenomenon, the shape of sdg (negative or positive) and its con- nection with life history decisions is a key component to understanding freshwater population dynamics of atlantic salmon. although a number of studies have looked at differences in growth dynamics among life history groups of atlantic salmon, few studies have focused on the pattern of sdg within groups and how it may change through ontogeny as they approach different life history ‘decision’ windows. in this article, we combine data from both the laboratory and the field to explore the interaction between sdg and life history in juvenile atlantic salmon. in both studies, there were no experimental manipulation of growth rates; hence, we did not induce a growth response unnaturally. our questions are (i) ‘is sdg (either positive or negative) common in juvenile atlantic salmon?’, (ii) ‘if so, when is it most likely to occur?’ and (iii) ‘is there an interaction among life history groups and sdg? methods laboratory study to examine whether season and life history can influ- ence the strength and form of sdg, we used a subset of the data described in obedzinzki & letcher (2004) of monthly growth rates of yearling atlantic salmon from the fall of their age 0+ year to the spring of their age 1+ year. growth trials were conducted at the conte anadromous fish research center in turners falls, ma, usa. all fish were fed ad libitum and temperatures followed ambient temperatures of atlantic salmon streams in the connecticut river basin. fish were anaesthetized with ms-222 (100 mgl  1), marked with a 12 mm passive inte- grated transponder (pit) tag and placed in to one of four 400-ml tanks. subsequently, all fish were sam- pled monthly and measured for length (mm, fork length) and weight (g, wet). to quantify growth, we focused on absolute growth in length because it tends to be linear in salmonids during juvenile development (sigourney et al. 2008; nicieza & alvarez 2009), and length measurements tend to be more accurate than weight measurements (d.b. sigourney unpub- lished data). therefore, growth was calculated as: gl ¼ l2   l1 t2   t1 where l1 is initial length at the beginning of the growth interval, l2 is final length at the end of the interval and the difference between t2 and t1 repre- sents the length of the growth interval in number of days. because we followed each individual until a life history status was expressed in the spring we could retrospectively assign all fish from all samples to a life history group based on a combination of body size and body shape variables (see pearlstein et al. 2007). using a combination of shape, length and growth as criteria, we categorised fish into two groups: (i) parr (i.e., fish that did not metamorphose into migrants in the spring) and (ii) smolts (i.e., fish that did metamorphose into migrants in the spring). sigourney et al. (2008) presented a brief analysis of this data set showing the tendency of smolts to maintain growth in the late fall, while parr exhibited decreased growth late in the season as temperatures declined. in this analysis, we take a more detailed look at the monthly growth rates focusing on the interaction between initial length and life history on growth rates over five consecutive growth intervals. because we had repeated measurements of the same individuals, we used linear mixed models (lmm) where initial length (l1) was a continuous covariate, life history and growth interval were grouping vari- ables, and individuals were treated as random effects. we initially included tank as a fixed effect, but excluded this effect from further analysis, as it did not account for a significant amount of the variation in growth (p > 0.3). all models were estimated using the lmer function in r. to estimate sdg, we used markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) integration of the full lmm model to produce estimates of the slope between initial length and absolute growth rate for each growth interval and life history group combination using the mcmcsamp function in program r (r development core team growth in juvenile atlantic salmon 2010). because we were interested in life history-spe- cific estimates of sdg for each growth interval, and we were not focused on testing competing hypotheses of growth, we only fit the full model to the data rather than comparing more constrained models with a model selection criterion such as aikaike’s infor- mation criterion (aic). we report median estimates and upper and lower confidence intervals from 10,000 mcmc draws. we considered an estimate of sdg to be significant if the corresponding confi- dence interval of the slope estimates did not overlap zero. field study to estimate sdg in situ, we used data from an ongo- ing mark-recapture study of stream salmonids. field data were collected from the west brook, a 3rd order tributary to the connecticut river located in whately, ma, usa (42°25′n 72°39′w. a number of articles detail how data were collected in the field sites so only the pertinent information is presented here (see e.g., letcher & gries 2003; horton et al. 2009). the study site was divided into 47 continuous sections of approximately 100 m2. fish were captured using standard electroshocking techniques. each section was closed off using block nets. all fish captured that were  60 mm fork length and  2.0 g in mass were individually tagged with a 12 mm passive pit tag, and a scale was taken for age determination. maturity of males was determined by applying gentle pressure to the abdomen and checking for the expres- sion of milt. in most years, the study site was sam- pled a minimum of four times a year starting in the spring when conditions allowed sampling and ending in the late fall or early winter just before freeze up. the one exception was in 2002 where we did not perform an early winter sample due to ice cover. there is no natural spawning of adult atlantic salmon in west brook, and densities are maintained by the stocking of unfed fry in the spring. in addition to the electroshocking samples, a smolt trap was installed c. 3 km downstream of the study site and was primarily used to sample migrating smolts in the spring (letcher & gries 2003). the smolt trap consisted of a picket weir and box trap fol- lowing the design of anderson & mcdonald (1978). information from the smolt trap was used to assign a life history status retrospectively. if an individual was captured emigrating at age 2+ in the spring and was known to be immature in the fall, we assigned it to the smolt life history group. if an individual matured in the fall and delayed smolting at age 2+ (i.e., was captured in the study site after the smolt migration), we assigned it to the parr life history group. some individuals matured and migrated early, and some 497 sigourney et al. neither matured nor migrated early; however, these alternative life histories were rare, and we therefore did not include them in the analyses. high flows occasionally precluded sampling of the smolt trap in the spring, and therefore, we excluded analysis of some cohorts. in our analysis of field data, we were interested in estimating sdg among life history groups for each season from age 0+ fall to age 2+ spring for a given cohort in a manner similar to our analysis of the labo- ratory data. therefore, we treated each cohort as a separate data set and analysed the effects of length, season, life history group and their interactions on growth rate using a lmm in r. individual was included as a random effect. we did not explicitly test for an interaction between cohort and sdg. for each cohort, we derived season-specific estimates of sdg for each life history group using the same mcmc procedure described above. because we could not assign a large number of individuals to the smolt life history group every year, our analysis was limited to the 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 cohorts (table 1). in addition to the seasonal changes in the field data before emigration, we also analysed the relationship between length and growth rates of smolts during the spring migration for a subset of individuals that were captured both electroshocking in the early spring sample of their age 2+ year and subsequently in the smolt trap as emigrating smolts. because we only caught migrating smolts in the smolt trap, our analy- ses of sdg over this interval was restricted to age 2+ immature smolts. we used information from the table 1. median start and end dates for electrofishing samples on the west brook. number of known smolts (ns) and parr (np) captured at both the start and end of

growth, we included date of capture in the smolt trap and number of days at large as covariates in a general lin- ear model as these factors may influence growth rates. if these covariates were not significant, we per- formed a simple linear regression with just initial fork length (i.e., fork length in the early spring sample) as a predictor variable and absolute growth rate as the response variable. our analyses were limited to age 2+ smolts from the 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 cohorts where we had adequate sample sizes (n = 11, n = 30, n = 21 and n = 16, respectively). results laboratory study results from the laboratory data suggested that the strength and direction (positive or negative) of sdg depended on both season and life history group. for both life history groups, there was a seasonal decline in growth rates as temperatures cooled over the course of the experiment (fig. 1). for the parr life history group, the relationship between length and growth rate was relatively weak and constant over time, but changed dramatically for the smolt life his- tory group (fig. 1). estimates of sdg from the lmm for the october growth interval indicated that there was little sdg in the parr group and positive size-dependent growth in the smolt group (table 2). this pattern was maintained through the november growth interval. by december, however, the relation- ship between length and growth rate changed for the smolt group with estimates of sdg becoming nega- tive with confidence intervals that did not cover zero, suggesting a compensatory growth effect in the smolt group during this growth interval (table 2). this negative relationship was maintained through both the january and february samples although the esti- mate for the february growth interval suggested a somewhat weaker effect. for the parr group, esti- mates of sdg were only weakly positive and were not significant (table 2). field study evidence of an interaction between size and life his- tory depended on the season and cohort analysed. for the 1996 cohort, there appeared to be an interac- tion between season and life history that was similar to that observed in the laboratory data (fig. 2). esti- mates of sdg for age 1+ parr were weak with confi- dence intervals that covered zero (table 3). for the smolt group, there was no evidence of sdg until the growth in juvenile atlantic

were positive for both groups during the age 1+ spring growth interval, suggesting a depensatory effect, but negative during the age 1+ summer suggesting a compensatory effect (table 3). estimates were weak during the other sea- sons as evidenced by large standard errors and 95% confidence intervals that covered zero. for the 1999 cohort, there was no evidence of sdg in the parr group, but there was a positive effect in the spring for the smolt group (fig. 4). for the 2001 cohort, there was some evidence of a life history interaction in the spring (fig. 5). estimates of sdg were posi-

estimates for the smolt group were weaker and did not appear to be significant (table 3). results from the linear regressions on subsets of emigrating smolts indicated the relationship between initial fork length and growth rate in age 2+ smolts during the spring migration depended on the cohort examined. we found a negative relationship between length and growth rate for all cohorts examined; however, the relationship was not significant for the 1997 or the 2001 cohort (fig. 6). we did not detect a significant influence of the numbers of days at large or the date of capture on growth rate except for the 1997 cohort where we found a significant (positive) relationship between date of capture and growth rate (f1,28 = 5.9, p = 0.02). these results suggest that there is a compensatory growth response in migrating smolts, but it is dependent on year. discussion although a number of theoretical and experimental studies have investigated the causes and conse- quences of size-dependent growth, there have been relatively few studies investigating the interaction between sdg and life history pathways. in this study, we found that the strength and direction of sdg and whether or not it differed among life his- 500 tory groups depended on the data set and season analysed. there was strong evidence that sdg depended on both life history and season in the labo- ratory. the smolt group displayed a compensatory growth effect in early winter even though no experi- mental treatment had been applied to induce a com- pensatory response. evidence from the field was weaker where low sample sizes partially compro- mised statistical power to detect a significant sdg response particularly in the smolt group. sdg was not strong early in ontogeny (age 0+), but there was some evidence of positive sdg during the fast spring the age 1+ depending on the growth period of cohort. similar to the laboratory data, smolts were more likely to undergo compensatory growth, as they approached the smolt window. this compensatory response in smolts was strongest just before migrat- ing in the spring. results from the laboratory study suggested an interaction between life history and season on the strength and direction of sdg. we found little evi- dence of sdg in the parr group, but a seasonally dependent sdg effect in the smolt group. some smolts that were initially small and slow growing in the fall displayed a compensatory growth response during the winter and eventually joined the smolt group. there have been a number of studies comparing the difference in growth rates among life history groups, but few have investigated the interac- table 3. estimates of size-dependent growth (sdg) estimated from a linear mixed model (lmm) for both smolts and parr from several different

rates, the response is markedly stronger in smolts. what is unknown from this study is how sdg strategies may or may not vary among life history groups in the absence of any directed manipulation of growth rates. our study demonstrates that this life history-dependent response can be manifest even in the absence of an experimen- tal manipulation of growth rates (i.e., exposure to cooler temperatures or low food ration). thus, unlike the majority of compensatory growth studies that experimentally manipulate growth rates (ali et al. 2003), our results demonstrate that compensatory growth does not necessarily need to be induced and sdg estimate (se)  0.0039 (0.0039)  0.0076 (0.0150) 0.0051 (0.0038) 0.0130 (0.0118) 0.0085 (0.0053)  0.0381 (0.0137)  0.0021 (0.0044)  0.0028

held under the same conditions. the opportunity for evidence of sdg in the field from our seasonal electrofishing surveys depended on the season and cohort analysed. there was no evidence of sdg dur- ing the age 0+ fall and winter growth intervals. this failure to detect sdg may partly be due to the fact that growth rates slow during the fall and winter, and therefore, large variations in growth rates is reduced. however, this result also suggests that initial size variation is established early on before the age 0+ fall. this pattern is consistent with other studies that have pointed out the impor- tance of early life dynamics such as prior residence effects on establishing size variation early in ontogeny (metcalfe et al. 1992; cutts et al. 1999). as salmon juveniles grow and become more mobile, certain 501 sigourney et al. fig. 3. graph of seasonal changes in the relationship between fork length and growth rate for juvenile atlantic salmon with known life his- tories captured in electrofishing surveys in the west brook, ma. data for the 1997 cohort are shown. separate regression lines for parr and smolts are provided. aspects of their growth dynamics are known to change (einum et al. 2006, 2012). the lack of sdg by the age 0+ fall interval may reflect the establishment of an ideal free distribution where mobile individuals have taken up various territories to effectively homo- genise their growth rates. movement at an early stage is known to be size-dependent where smaller fish are more mobile but can achieve higher growth rates (einum et al. 2012). this increase in movement potentially to avoid competition may partly explain the lack of any strong sdg patterns observed in this study during the latter stages of the age 0+ growth season. despite this lack of sdg at age 0+ stage, we found that sdg during the age 1+ spring was more likely to be positively size-dependent although not always sig- nificant. growth rates in the west brook increase dra- matically during the spring interval likely due to warming temperatures and a large influx of inverte- brate drift (letcher & gries 2003; grader & letcher 502 2006). this dramatic change in growth conditions may lead to increased competition for resources where larger individuals out compete smaller subordinate fish. size is known to be an important determinant of outcomes in aggressive interaction in salmon and changes in conditions from year to year may deter- mine the strength of these interactions. however, hun- tingford et al. (1992) found that social dominance in the spring is not size dependent, and therefore, size is not always a strong determinant of social dominance or faster growth. an alternative explanation for this depensatory effect may be autocorrelation in growth (pfister & stevens 2002; fujiwara et al. 2004). using simulations, pfister & stevens (2002) demonstrated that statistically independent variation in growth rates is more likely to result in depensatory growth than compensatory growth. thus, the depensatory effect observed during the fast spring growth interval may be partly driven by random variation in factors influ- encing growth such as habitat quality. growth in juvenile atlantic salmon fig. 4. graph of seasonal changes in the relationship between fork length and growth rate for juvenile atlantic salmon with known life his- tories captured in electrofishing surveys in the west brook, ma. data for the 1999 cohort are shown. separate regression lines for parr and smolts are provided. in addition to the age 1+ spring growth interval, there was some evidence of an interaction between life history and sdg later in ontogeny although our ability to detect a significant effect was partly com- promised by low sample sizes. similar to the labora- tory results, a compensatory growth response was more likely to occur in the smolt group after the age 1+ spring. this effect was strongest in the 1996 cohort where there was a significant negative relation between length and growth rate during the age 1+ winter. we also observed similar patterns in the 1999 and 2001 cohorts, but the effect was not as fall growth between strong. mature parr and immature smolts is known to diverge (letcher & gries 2003). similar life history differences in fall growth rates have been reported in a number of systems due to a decrease in feeding motivation in parr and willingness to feed in smolts (huntingford et al. 1992; simpson et al. 1996). our in the west brook, data suggest that there may also be a size effect such that this difference in growth among the two life his- tory groups is driven by smaller smolts that are try- ing to reach a size threshold before emigration in the spring. a similar pattern of growth in parr before the maturity threshold in the fall was not evident in our data. the strongest evidence for sdg was a consistent compensatory growth response within the smolt group during the spring of their age 2+ year during the spring migration. we found that age 2+ smolts captured in the smolt trap in the spring that were ini- tially small in the early spring electrofishing sample grew faster than larger smolts. for most cohorts, this effect did not seem to be influenced by the date of migration (with the exception of the 1997 cohort where there was no strong compensatory effect). this pattern of sdg corroborated evidence presented in previous studies from rivers in spain that there is a 503 sigourney et al. fig. 5. graph of seasonal changes in the relationship between fork length and growth rate for juvenile atlantic salmon with known life his- tories captured in electrofishing surveys in the wets brook, ma. data for the 2001 cohort are shown. separate regression lines for parr and smolts are provided. compensatory effect during this period (nicieza & bra~na 1993; utrilla & lobon-cervia 1999). evidence from spanish rivers suggests a similar pattern, but it was unclear from these studies if smaller smolts achieve a threshold size by accelerating growth (i.e., a true compensatory effect) or delaying migration until growth conditions improve (nicieza & bra~na 1993). utrilla & lobon-cervia (1999) suggested this growth pattern might represent an alternative life his- tory that is unique to spanish rivers where an early spring offers the opportunity to engage in accelerated growth before migrating. our results suggest that this phenomenon may be more widespread. however, similar to the spanish rivers, the west brook is located at the southern edge of the range of atlantic salmon in north america. information from more northerly latitudes is needed to confirm the true ubiq- uity of this growth strategy. this apparent life history strategy may represent a by-product of opposing selection pressures. the benefits of size early in ontogeny could influence 504 social interactions such as prior residence (letcher et al. 2004); however, fast growth during early onto- genetic stages could trade-off with negative size- dependent survival during later ontogenetic stages. there is increasing evidence from studies on survival of stream salmonids that large size may be selected against for older fish in small streams (carlson et al. 2008; letcher & horton 2008). in addition, nicieza & metcalfe (1999) demonstrated that in early migrants, there is a cost to maintaining fast growth as they are more susceptible to aggressive attacks than resident parr. however, to migrate a future smolt must attain a relatively large size for ocean survival (økland et al. 1993). these opposing selection pres- sures may give rise to two different life history pathways within the early migrant group. one is to grow fast early then maintain size until smolting. the other is to defer costly growth early on and then accelerate growth just before the migration period. this form of compensatory or convergent growth is evident in other animals that metamorphose and growth in juvenile atlantic salmon 1997 n.s. 2001 n.s. 1996 p < 0.05 1999 p < 0.05 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 ) 1 – y a d m m  ( t e a r h w o r g t  l t e u o s b a 110 120 130 140 150 160 110 120 130 140 150 160 fork length (mm) fig. 6. results of simple linear regressions of initial length (l1) versus growth rate for age 2+ smolts captured in early spring and recap- tured in a smolt trap during the spring migration. regression lines are shown for the 1996 cohort ( 0.021 l1 + 3.46, r2 = 0.333), the 1997 the 1999 cohort ( 0.0078 l1 + 1.48, r2 = 0.42) and the 2001 cohort ( 0.0079 l1 + 1.69, cohort ( 0.002 l1 + 0.72, r2 = 0.01), r2 = 0.03). change habitats (lytle 2001; tammaru et al. 2004). in the case of atlantic salmon, individuals may not necessarily be trying to attain the largest size possi- ble, but rather to converge on a target size that optimises both in stream survival before migration and ocean survival during migration. the presence of this strategy may vary among populations and lati- tudes as the ability to put on a growth spurt prior to migration will depend on the growth opportunity dur- ing this late winter early spring migration window (utrilla & lobon-cervia 1999). in their model, understanding the range of life history strategies exhibited in natural environments could be used to update state-dependent life history models such as the one proposed by thorpe et al. (1998) for atlantic salmon. for example, the model proposed by thorpe et al. (1998) allows for differences in feeding strate- gies among life history groups, but not necessarily within life history groups. they include a parameter which controls feeding in the winter that is allowed to vary among life history groups, but there is no size-dependent function; thus, there is no explicit mechanism to allow for conver- gent growth in the smolt life history. in addition, their mortality function is negatively size dependent, but recent research suggests that mortality may be positively size dependent in stream salmonids (carlson et al. 2008; letcher & horton 2008). as a result, their proximate model may predict a compen- satory response among individual smolts from differ- life history model ent cohorts but not necessarily a size-dependent response within a cohort. using information from the field on juvenile steelhead (oncorhynchus_mykiss), satterthwaite et al. (2012) describe a similar version of a state-dependent that does allow for a compensatory response but only if indi- viduals transition among habitats. our study demon- strates that small individuals can accelerate growth and join the smolt group without undertaking any major habitat transitions. the fact that this apparent growth strategy has been observed in a number of different river systems suggests that it may be wide- spread and therefore an important component to include in future state-dependent life history models. in this study, we focused on the presence of sdg and whether it was life history dependent. we did not focus on potential interactions with environmental variables that could influence this outcome. for example, the cost associated with growing fast and emigrating or deferring growth and remaining in the river may partly be density dependent. similarly, in stream survival and hence the relative fitness of delaying migration will depend on availability of appropriate refuges (finstad et al. 2009). other factors that may influence the form and intensity of sdg include temperature and food availability. vari- ation in these factors may also explain why the sdg effect was stronger in the laboratory than in the field. further research combining long-term data sets with experimental manipulations may help unravel the 505 sigourney et al. interaction between environmental variables and growth strategies. such information is valuable, as it will help improve understanding and predictability of models and may help guide management strategies. acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the many people who helped sample the study site, in particular s. carlson, j. coombs, g. gries, m. o’donnell and t. dubreuil. we would also like to thank a. varaday and t. evans for assistance in the labora- tory and g. horton for comments on early drafts of this manu- script. for the laboratory study, eggs were supplied by staff at the u.s. fish and wildlife service’s craig brook, green lake and white river national fish hatcheries and funding was provided by the national marine fisheries service. this work was also supported by the biological resources division of the u.s. geological survey. references ali, m., nicieza, a. & wootton, r.j. 2003. compensatory growth in fishes: a response to growth depression. fish and fisheries 4: 147–190. anderson, t.c. & mcdonald, b.p. 1978. a portable weir for counting migrating fishes in rivers. fisheries and marine service technical report 733: 1–13. bystr€om, p. & andersson, j. 2005. size-dependent foraging capacities and intercohort competition in an ontogenetic omnivore (arctic charr). oikos 110: 523–536. carlson, s.m., olsen, e.m. & vollestad, l.a. 2008. seasonal mortality and the effect of body size: a review and an empir- ical test using individual data on brown_trout. functional ecology 22: 663–673. cutts, c.j., brembs, b., metcalfe, n.b. & taylor, a.c. 1999. prior residence, territory quality and life-history stratefies in juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.). journal of fish biology 55: 784–794. einum, s., sundt-hansen, l. & nislow, k.h. 2006. the parti- tioning of density-dependent dispersal, growth and survival throughout ontogeny in a highly fecund organism. oikos 113: 489–496. einum, s., finstad, a.g., robertsen, g., nislow, k.h., mckelvey, s. & armstrong, j.d. 2012. natal movement in juvenile atlantic salmon: a body size-dependent strategy?
