gobies and sticklebacks dominated. smelt preyed also on isopods, cladocerans, decapods, molluscs, insects, insect larvae as well as polychaete annelids. prey composition varied monthly and depended on smelt size. the higher proportion of empty stomachs was observed during june, september and october. key words: smelt; diet; size class; seasonal variation; gulf of finland introduction small pelagic fish species, such as european smelt osmerus eperlanus, are important components in the baltic sea ecosystem (timola 1980; popov 2006; lankov et al. 2010), transferring energy to upper tro- phic levels. thus, the stock size and condition of the species can be important determinant for the status of larger fish species that are generally the main target for commercial fisheries. although the economic importance of smelt in the baltic sea is moderate compared with the baltic herring clupea harengus membras, sprat sprattus sprattus balticus and cod gadus morhua callarias, important and highly valued species in local small-scaled coastal fisheries (zhiliukiene 2002; shpilev et al. 2005; popov 2006; shvagzhdys 2009). is still it european smelt is an anadromous estuarine coastal fish species which tolerates wide range of salinities. however, the spawning areas are situated in rivers and estuaries, but also in bights and inlets of low salinity (nellbring 1989; shpilev & turovski 2003). the largest smelt stocks in the baltic sea are sepa- rated from each other by living in relatively confined sub-basins with different hydrological conditions: the gulf of bothnia, the eastern gulf of finland, the gulf of riga and the curonian lagoon with the adjacent coastal area of the baltic proper (shpilev et al. 2005; popov 2006). nonmigratory landlocked freshwater populations also occur in scandinavia and eastern europe (nellbring 1989; kottelat & freyhof 2007). in the eastern baltic sea, smelt stocks and catches fluctuate considerably (shpilev & turovski 2003; popov 2006; shvagzhdys 2009). it is probable that the periods of strong and weak year classes in the eastern baltic sea have a general background of large-scale changes in the marine ecosystem under the impact of long-term fluctuations in climate (shpi- lev et al. 2005). the smelt stock in the baltic sea can be significantly affected not only by the climate correspondence: i. taal, estonian marine institute, university of tartu, vanemuise 46a, 51,014 tartu, estonia. e-mail: imretaal@ut.ee doi: 10.1111/eff.12044 121 taal et al. change, but also by human activity (repecka 2003; shvagzhdys 2009). however, other ecological aspects of smelt biology have to be also considered in the context of smelt year class strength. to our knowledge, there are virtually no compre- hensive studies concerning seasonal diet composition of subadult and adult smelt in strictly near-shore areas of the eastern baltic. however, feeding habits of smelt, among other fish species in surf zone of the baltic proper, have been briefly described in a single data set (uzars et al. 2003; ustups et al. 2007). majority of the reports on diet and feeding habits of smelt in this area have been based on the samples from pelagic trawl and fyke-net catches in offshore feeding areas or concentrated on dietary preferences of juvenile smelt. although some of those reports are in peer-reviewed (cited by isi web of knowledge) literature (ojaveer et al. 2004; lankov et al. 2010), most are published elsewhere (vashkevichiute 1959; kostrichkina 1968, 1970, 1974; shestakov 1970; popov 1978a, 2006; urtans 1990; ojaveer et al. 1997). thus, more knowledge on the diet preferences of adult smelt, inhabiting shallow coastal areas, is still needed to understand the role of smelt in the brackish near-shore ecosystems of the baltic sea. trophic levels. smelt generally, smelt is considered as an important pred- ator on zooplankton, large invertebrates and small fish (kostrichkina 1968; shestakov 1970; j€arvek€ulg 1979; timola 1980; shpilev et al. 2005), and, at the same time, smelt is a favourable prey for piscivorous fish species (kostrichkina 1968; thiel et al. 1996; hans- son et al. 2001; vinni et al. 2004) and thus transfer- ring energy to upper is zooplanktivorous at younger ages, but gradually shifts to larger invertebrates and fish (shestakov 1970; ti- mola 1980; urtans 1990; vinni et al. 2004). thus, the food particles tend to get bigger with increasing smelt size (vinni et al. 2004). it is often observed that the diet composition of different smelt populations varies among regions and is influenced by prey availability, local environmental conditions and season (kostrichk- ina 1968; nellbring 1989; urtans 1990; popov 2006). fish often make selective decisions in their diet but mostly feed opportunistically; thus, stomach contents are reflecting the availability of food items in actual environmental conditions (murdoch et al. 1975; ger- king 1994; matthews 1998). food availability may have an effect on prey type and fish growth (lantry & stewart 1993; stritzel thomson et al. 2011) which may result in considerable variations of smelt growth rate in different areas (shpilev et al. 2005). moreover, the smelt population in the eastern part of gulf of fin- land can be divided into ‘shallow water form’ inhabit- ing the shallow coastal zone and the ‘deep water form’ populating deeper areas. these groups differ in age at sexual maturation, maximum age and growth rate, as 122 the feeding conditions of the ‘shallow water form’ are clearly inferior (popov 1978b). to the ‘deep water form’ in this study, we present data on the food composi- tion, feeding activity and seasonal dynamics of adult and subadult smelt from the brackish near-shore eco- system. in terms of ecosystem management, such studies are essential for evaluation of the ecological role of the species as well as understanding the food web structure in the shallow littoral zone. materials and methods the material was collected from eru bay (59°35′n 25°49′e) located at the southern shore of the gulf of finland (fig. 1). surface water salinity in this area is usually 4.5–6.5% which is typical for the central part of the gulf of finland (martin et al. 2003). fish samples were collected monthly during most of the ice-free season from april to june and from august to december 2008. sampling was performed using gillnets with mesh sizes 14, 17, 22 mm (knot to knot) and hand (beach) seine. the hand seine that was used had a wing length of 14 m and a mesh size baltic sea 0 5 10 20 km fig. 1. location map of the study area. s e c s p i a t c e s n i l o v . c p s . m a g t n e . s . p s . a e t o d i i a d s y m i o g n e p . c l i a v a v b i . r t s a g i v d . h ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % ) n % ( o % s e f % h t n o m . s h c a m o t s t l e m s n i y e r p f o s e c d n i i ) n % ( l a c i r e m u n d n a l ) e b a t e h t n i o % o t i d e t a v e r b b a - . o . f % ( e c n e r r u c c o , ) s e f % ( s h c a m o t s y t p m e f o y c n e u q e r f . 1 l e b a t ) 1 ( 0 1 ) 1 < ( 1 ) 8 ( 6 ) 5 1 ( 4 ) 1 ( 7 ) 1 ( 4 1 ) 5 4 ( 4 1 ) 1 ( 1 ) 3 3 ( ) 2 5 ( ) 7 2 ( 8 2 4 4 4 2 ) 7 1 ( ) 7 1 ( ) 7 2 ( ) 3 3 ( ) 9 1 ( ) 7 1 ( ) 6 2 ( ) 3 ( 1 1 7 2 0 8 9 4 6 5 8 5 6 8 4 1 ) 1 ( 3 ) 1 ( 4 ) 1 < ( ) 1 ( 4 ) 1 < ( ) 1 < ( ) 1 < ( 2 2 4 3 ) 1 ( 3 ) 1 < ( 1 ) 3 1 ( ) 1 2 ( ) 7 3 ( ) 3 3 ( ) 3 2 ( ) 4 1 ( ) 8 ( 2 4 0 7 5 8 5 8 3 6 9 3 2 4 ) 6 9 ( 0 0 1 ) 0 6 ( ) 0 5 ( ) 5 2 ( ) 5 6 ( ) 5 4 ( ) 2 5 ( ) 4 6 ( ) 2 4 ( ) 4 4 ( ) 8 2 ( ) 9 1 ( ) 6 5 ( ) 3 6 ( ) 8 4 ( ) 6 2 ( ) 9 3 ( ) 8 6 ( ) 4 7 ( ) 6 7 ( ) 6 3 ( ) 9 3 ( ) 4 4 ( ) 1 5 ( ) 3 ( 5 7 7 6 6 3 0 8 0 7 3 8 5 7 6 8 4 1 9 4 5 5 3 5 7 6 0 9 5 7 8 6 0 7 9 8 4 9 2 9 2 7 0 8 1 8 7 7 ) 1 < ( ) 3 ( 2 3 1 ) 2 ( ) 1 ( 1 1 1 2 ) 1 ( 3 ) 1 ( 5 ) 1 ( 3 ) 1 ( 8 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) 2 ( ) 5 ( ) 0 1 ( 1 5 5 1 0 2 9 3 ) 4 ( 6 ) 3 1 ( ) 2 ( ) 1 ( ) 1 < ( ) 4 ( 8 1 0 2 5 7 1 8 ) 1 1 ( ) 2 1 ( ) 5 1 ( ) 5 1 ( ) 2 2 ( ) 9 2 ( ) 8 3 ( ) 0 1 ( ) 6 1 ( ) 3 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 5 1 ( ) 3 ( ) 8 ( ) 3 1 ( 8 1 0 3 2 3 4 4 5 5 4 5 5 4 0 3 3 4 7 3 1 4 3 1 3 2 0 3 3 3 ) 4 8 ( 2 9 ) 3 7 ( 0 0 1 ) 1 6 ( ) 5 6 ( ) 4 3 ( ) 4 1 ( ) 5 3 ( ) 0 4 ( ) 5 2 ( ) 7 1 ( ) 1 ( ) 5 ( ) 6 ( ) 2 ( ) 2 ( ) 6 3 ( ) 5 2 ( ) 1 2 ( ) 2 2 ( ) 6 ( ) 9 ( ) 6 ( ) 3 ( ) 8 4 ( ) 4 1 ( ) 0 1 ( ) 7 ( ) 9 5 ( ) 3 4 ( ) 2 4 ( ) 7 2 ( 4 8 9 8 5 6 6 4 5 5 5 2 1 1 7 2 3 1 2 4 3 3 7 1 4 1 7 5 9 4 2 4 2 3 4 4 1 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 6 3 6 3 7 2 9 6 0 5 9 4 3 4 ) 1 < ( ) 2 ( 5 6 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( 6 0 1 ) 6 ( ) 4 ( ) 3 ( 5 1 1 2 2 1 ) 4 ( 1 1 ) 3 ( ) 3 ( ) 1 ( 5 3 4 1 ) 1 < ( 2 ) 1 < ( ) 1 ( 3 1 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( 3 4 3 ) 1 < ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( 7 1 3 ) 1 < ( 4 ) 3 ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( 3 3 5 4 1 0 3 2 1 0 5 2 1 0 2 6 8 3 7 5 3 7 9 2 5 2 5 2 1 1 3 1 6 5 6 3 7 3 0 1 0 4 1 2 2 2 8 4 3 5 3 9 5 1 4 1 0 l . r o t a t u o v m u h p o r o c i , l o v . c ;

ojaveer et al. 1997; ustups et al. 2007). non- digestible items like pebbles and parasites were excluded from further analysis as well as macroalgae. size classes lti (april, october, november, decem- ber), ltii (april) and ltv (april, june, september) were not included to further statistical analysis due to insufficient number of specimens in the data set. the frequency of empty stomachs (fes) was also determined. empty was defined as the absence of any measurable organic material in the stomach (arrington et al. 2002). the proportion of individuals with empty stomachs in different size classes associating with period of capture was investigated with chi-squared test. the aim of this study was to determine the composition of the smelt diet (and seasonal variation of it in different smelt size classes). we did not aim to determine the importance of the particular prey items according to their biomass due to logistical reasons. to test whether smelt diet was affected by period of capture, tl and their interaction a nonparametric randomized approach was used with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permanova test using primer per- manova+; andersson et al. 2008; individuals with empty stomachs were omitted from this data set). canonical analysis of principal coordinates (cap test using primer permanova+; andersson et al. 2008; individuals with empty stomachs were omitted from this data set) was applied for illustrating these effects. for better data visualisation, the percentages of fre- quency of occurrence (%f.o.) and numbers (%n) were calculated for each prey category according to the 1980): % f.o. = 100 9 fi/n, where: fi is number of stomachs containing a particular prey taxon; n is total number stomachs with any prey. %n = 100 9 ni/n, of following equations (hyslop 124 where: ni taxon; n is the total number of all prey identified. is total number of prey of a particular results general food composition crustaceans were the most common prey and of these, amphipods (gammarus spp., corophium volutator) and mysids (mysis spp.) were the most abundant, followed by isopods (idotea spp., saduria entomon), cladocerans (cercophagis pengoi) and decapods (pal- aemon adspersus). piscivorous feeding was also evi- dent, particularly in case of larger smelt during the summer and early autumn (august, september, octo- ber) (table 1). seven fish species were recorded in the diet, more numerously three-spined stickleback stickleback gasterosteus pungitius pungitius, sand goby pomatoschistus minu- tus and common goby pomatoschistus microps. only single specimens of baltic herring, common sand eel ammodytes tobianus and bullhead cottus gobio were recorded in the samples. smelt preyed also on mol- luscs (hydrobia spp., radix ovata, mytilus trossulus, macoma balthica), insects (corixa spp.), insect larvae (chaoborus spp., chironomidae, trichoptera) and annelids (hediste diversicolor) (table 1). nine-spined aculeatus, seasonal dynamics of diet composition main factor affecting the diet structure was tl of smelt individuals (table 2), illustrated by the differ- ences of prey item abundances in different size clas- ses statistically significant tl 9 month interaction (table 2) indi- cates that the variation in prey compositions among different size smelt has also strong seasonal basis. fig. 2). however, (table 1, in april, smelt preyed almost exclusively on mys- ids (mysis spp.) and gammarids (gammarus spp.) (table 1). in may, mysids and gammarid amphipods (gamm- arus spp.) were the most common food items. corop- hid amphipod (corophium volutator) and isopods (idotea sp.) were also consumed in relatively high numbers (table 1). diet of smaller smelt (lti, ltii, ltiii) was mainly characterised by the importance of table 2. differences in smelt diet according to period of capture (month) and fish size total length (tl). source d.f. ss month size class month 9 size class residual total 7 1 7 1158 1173 24.95 5.99 5.42 350.52 386.89 ms 3.56 5.99 0.77 0.30 pseudof p 11.78 19.80 2.56 0.001 0.001 0.002 smelt feeding ecology in the eastern baltic sea (a) g m c k i (b) g 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0 –0.05 –0.10 –0.15 –0.20 p c m –0.08 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 –0.20 –0.15 –0.10 –0.05 0 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 (d) m p i g (e) 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 –0.08 i g p 0.10 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 –0.08 –0.10 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 (c) g c p m –0.10 –0.08 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 (f) m g i –0.10 –0.08 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 –0.08 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 (g) m p g 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 –0.08 0.10 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 –0.08 –0.10 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 –0.02 –0.04 –0.06 –0.06 –0.04 –0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 fig. 2. canonical analysis of principal coordinates (cap) plot illustrating monthly [(a), may;

however, this was not the case in september. in april discussion our data indicate that the seasonal diet composition of smelt in near-shore ecosystem differs from smelt inhabiting offshore regions of the eastern baltic sea. gammarid amphipods were the most common prey of subadult and adult smelt and were important food items throughout the year in eru bay. mysids were also very important prey, especially in colder water period, from april to june and from november to december. isopods (idotea sp.) were also important prey from october to december, whereas corophid amphipod was most numerous in august. fish were mainly eaten from august to october, but the larger 126 smelt consumed them throughout the year. our results differ from previous studies which are con- duced mainly in offshore regions. in the eastern sec- tion of the gulf of finland, smelt feeds mostly on copepods in summer, mysids and to lesser extent amphipods in autumn. mysids and amphipods are also dominant prey in winter and spring (popov 1978a, 2006). near suursaar island, adult smelt additionally prey on juvenile smelt in autumn (popov 2006). in the gulf of riga, adult smelt feed predomi- nantly on mysids throughout the year. the species additionally prey on gammarids and various juvenile fish (sand goby, eelpout zoarces viviparus and smelt) and fish (baltic herring) larvae (kostrichkina 1968, 1974; shestakov 1970; urtans 1990; ojaveer et al. 1997). in the latvian coastal waters of baltic proper, the principal food for adult smelt in may, july and september are mysids. amphipods, decapods and fishes are consumed also in relatively high propor- tions (uzars et al. 2003; ustups et al. 2007). according to our data, the food composition of smaller smelt was generally different from that of bigger size groups. however, the diet of larger fish was more diversified and did not differ significantly between size groups. this pattern probably emerged because fish ability to consume different prey items depends on the individual’s size and the availability of suitably sized prey (vinni et al. 2004). whether or not the adult smelt is a serious predator on larvae and young fish has long been a subject of discussion (reviewed by nellbring 1989). present data suggests that smelt is an important predator in shallow near-shore areas of the eastern baltic sea where even the smaller length classes of subadult and adult smelt tend to feed on fish. this finding is sup- ported by previous studies which hint the same ten- dency in shallower offshore areas. shestakov (1970) found that in summer subadult smelt (100–119 mm) in relatively shallow p€arnu bay consumes predomi- nantly fish larvae and yoy fish (sand goby and her- ring). in the deeper gulf of riga, the same size class consumed mostly mysids in summer. according to (120– urtans (1990), 179 mm) preyed on fish in shallow region (6–20 m), whereas the importance of piscivory decreased with increasing depth in the gulf of riga. in the eastern section of the gulf of finland, the autumn diet of adult smelt consists mostly of mysids and amphipods. however, near island suursaar, smelt also preys on juvenile smelt in autumn (popov 2006). in contrast to our results, the importance of piscivory is relatively low in deeper offshore regions and even adult smelt tend to consume predominantly copepods, mysids, isopods and amphipods (kostrichkina 1968, 1974; shestakov 1970; popov 1978a, 2006; urtans 1990). however, according to popov (2006) piscivorous in spring the adult smelt food habits in larger smelt were evident also in dee- per areas as the specimens longer than 180 mm con- sumed also juvenile baltic herring and smelt throughout the year. in the gulf of riga, the marked increase in piscivory of bigger smelt is also reported by urtans (1990) and ojaveer et al. (1997), espe- cially concerning individuals longer than 180 mm (urtans 1990). in shallow waters of eru bay, smelt preyed on commercially nonimportant fish species (gobies and sticklebacks) but in deeper areas com- mercially important species such as baltic herring and juvenile smelt is also relatively important prey (kostrichkina 1968, 1974; shestakov 1970; urtans 1990; ojaveer et al. 1997). temporal variation in the frequency of empty stomachs is probably caused by fluctuations in abun- dance of suitable prey. however, temperature can hamper comparisons of fes in different periods as the gastric evacuation rate of smelt should be much lower during coldwater period than during warm- water period (vinni et al. 2005). the relatively low frequency of empty stomachs in april, may, novem- ber and december in our study can be also partly explained by the lower gastric evacuation rate. the highest number of empty stomachs was found in june, september and october. similar temporal trend was observed in the north-eastern part of bothnian bay by timola (1980) who suggested that, at least partly, these results could be explained by the scar- city of suitable food objects during some periods. frequency of empty stomachs (fes) increased with increasing size of smelt in april, may and june, probably due to reduced feeding activity during the spawning time and shortly after spawning (shestakov 1970; timola 1980; popov 2006). this finding is in accordance with data by vinni et al. (2005) in lake hiidenvesi where immature smelt start feeding earlier in spring than older mature specimens (vinni et al. 2004). statistically significant decrease in fes with increasing smelt size was found in september. sev- eral authors have concluded that the prevalence of feeding on other fish increases with the size of the smelt (popov 1978a, 2006; timola 1980; nellbring 1989; doherty & mccarthy 2004). so it is possible that the higher fes in smaller size classes can be explained by the low densities of suitable food objects invertebrates. moreover, according to ustups et al. (2007), sand goby and adult smelt had similar diet preferences in the surf zone of western coast of latvia. in our case, it is also possible that because of diet overlap, high abundance of other small-sized species may hamper the feeding conditions of smaller adult and subadult smelt. this hypothesis seems to be also supported by the ten- dency that most of the yoy of the fish species in the shallow littoral zone (e.g., gobies and sticklebacks) such as larger smelt feeding ecology in the eastern baltic sea reach the size that allows them to compete with the smaller smelt for the same food items during august and september (ojaveer 2003). acknowledgements we thank a. albert, r. eschbaum, m-l. barkala, k. hubel, r. kalda, k. kullasepp, u. piirisalu, m. rohtla, a. truuverk and e. ~ounap for help during fieldworks. funding for this research was provided by estonian science foundation grant 8281 and target financed project sf0180005s10. references andersson, m.j., gorley, r.n. & clarke, k.r. 2008. perma- nova+ for primer: guide to software and statistical methods. primer-e: plimouth, uk. 214 pp. arrington, d.a., winemiller, k.o., loftus, w.f. & akin, s. 2002. how often do fishes “run on empty”? ecology 83: 2145–2151. doherty, d. & mccarthy, t.k. 2004. the ecology and conser- vation of european smelt (osmerus eperlanus l.) from in southeastern ireland. biology and waterford estuary, environment: proceedings of irish academy 104b: 125–130. the royal gerking, s.d. 1994. feeding ecology of fish. san diego, ca: academic press inc. 416 pp. hansson, s., karlsson, l., ikonen, e., christensen, o., mitans, a., uzars, d., petersson, e. & ragnarsson, b. 2001. stom- ach analyses of baltic salmon from 1959–1962 and 1994– 1997: possible relations between diet and yolk-sac-fry mor- tality (m74). journal of fish biology 58: 1730–1745. hyslop, e.j. 1980. stomach contents analysis – a review of methods and their application. journal of fish biology 17: 411–429. j€arvek€ulg, a. 1979. the bottom fauna of the eastern part of the baltic sea. tallinn: valgus. 382 pp (in russian). kostrichkina, e.m. 1968. feeding relations of fishes in the gulf of riga. rybokhozyajstvennye issledovaniya v bass- ejne baltijskogo morya 4: 109–135.
