heggenes et al. 1999; armstrong et al. 2003). young salmon occur frequently in shallow open areas of the stream, compared with co-habiting trout species (brook_trout, salvelinus_fontinalis, in north america, brown_trout, salmo_trutta, in europe), which are more associated with overhanging cover or pool type habitats (gibson 1966; devore & white 1978; heggenes 1996). the water depth distributions of juvenile salmon are generally related to size of ﬁsh, and type of mesohabitat (e.g., gibson 1993; bremset & berg 1997). young salmon take refuge in coarse substrate during the day under certain conditions, for example, related to seasonal cooling water temperature towards winter (gibson 1978; rimmer et al. 1984), but also at times other than during the winter (gries & juanes 1998). like many ﬁsh species, juvenile salmon use shelter in their habitat to hide from predators (valdimarsson & metcalfe 1998). salmon parr have been also shown to compete for shelter (kemp et al. 2005), which indicates the value of this resource (armstrong & grifﬁths 2001). moreover, a recent study revealed that shelter use provides metabolic beneﬁts to juvenile salmon, and may thereforeaffecttheperformanceofvitallyimportanttraits like growth and activity patterns (millidine et al. 2006). we hypothesised that water depth itself affects hiding behaviour of young salmon. the present experimental study was undertaken to measure the effects of water depth on reactions to cover use during the summer growing season of juvenile salmon. possible changes in cover use were also tested with the presence of brown_trout, a typical cohabiting species in many salmon rivers, in which agonistic behaviour of the two species was also examined. materials and methods experimental stream tank observations were made in an ellipsoidal stream tank with re-circulated water, but with a constant inﬂow of doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00380.x 629 gibson & erkinaro water, derived from the local city supply, treated to remove chlorine. the tank had an overall total length of 9.1 m and width of 3.1 m., with an ‘upstream’ channel 1.22 m wide and 5.79 m long, entering a ‘pool’ 3.05 m wide by 1.52 m long, followed by a narrow channel 0.61 m wide and 4.27 m long (fig. 1). on the inside were glass panes along the channels, and a bent plastic window for the pool. the channels had a depth of 0.6 m, and the pool was 30 cm deeper, at 0.9 m. opposite the pool end, at the ‘downstream’ end of the narrow channel, was a paddle wheel with 24 stainless steel blades, driven by a 2 h.p. variable speed electric motor, )1 for all experimental water depths, set at 18.1 rev min sending the ﬂow in the direction of the wide channel. screens excluded ﬁsh from the machinery end, with horizontal extensions above the water surface to prevent ﬁsh leaping over them. the channels and pool did not have covers and ﬁsh rarely leaped out whilst the water was moving. water intake was at the machinery end, and a ﬂexible overﬂow arm allowed water levels to be manipulated by changing the angle. downstream of the paddle wheel was a ﬂoating styrofoam and wooden board to reduce wave motion. observations were made from the centre of the construction. the viewing areas were, 7.06 m2 for the wide channel, 4.64 m2 for the pool, and 2.60 m2 for the narrow channel. lights were suspended at a distance of 1.6 m above the bottom of the channels (30 cm higher from the bottom of the pool). incandescent lights alternated with ﬂuorescent lights (wide channel, 3 incandescent lights, 3 ﬂuorescent lights; pool, 3 incandescent lights, 1 ﬂuorescent; narrow channel, 2 incandescent, 3 ﬂuorescent). the incandescent lights (100 w) had an automatic dimmer switch, and gradually came on an hour before the ﬂuorescent lights (34 w, two to a frame), providing a photoperiod of 14 h (5 a.m.–7 p.m.). illumination was measured using a li-cor, inc. radiation sensor (li-189, spherical model spqa 1236) at a channel (lincoln, nebraska, u.s.a.) water depth of 40 cm. the centre of the sensor was 18 cm off the substrate. illumination varied from (l mol): wide channel, 4.35–8.44; pool, 3.36–9.74; narrow channel, 4.70–7.22. the whole apparatus was covered with black plastic to keep out extraneous light, and observations were made through slits in black muslin curtains, secured by a frame away from the windows. gravel and pebbles from a local beach formed the substrate, distributed to be a few centimetres deep, but deeper where it was sloped over the step to the pool. white pebbles delineated the bottom in 30 cm squares. opposite the windows, the inside of the tank was painted black with nontoxic paint, and marked off (with coloured mark- ing crayon) by vertical numbered lines at 30 cm intervals. water velocities (measured at 0.6 depth) ranged from 9–23 cm s in the wide channel, )1 in the 1–12 cm s narrow channel. since the paddle wheel rotated at the same speed for all experiments, water velocities were similar for the various experimental depths. average water temperature was 13.28 °c (se ± 0.283). )1 in the pool, and 21–37 cm s )1 covers made of opaque grey plexiglass were distrib- uted through the tank, 40 in total (fig. 1). most covers were 20 cm in length and 16 cm high. the covers were shaped like a ‘c’, with vertical bends, and one arm of the c buried in the gravel, the open part of the c facing upstream (fig. 2). cover widths (cm) were: 2.5; 5; 7.5; 10; 12.5 (table 1). ten covers were 15 cm in length, 10 cm wide and 11.5 cm high. these latter are outlined but not ﬁlled in, the locations and sizes are shown in fig. 1. five of these were oriented sideways to the current, and ﬁve were oriented downstream. the areas under cover (and proportion of cover in relation to the tank bottom, in brackets) were as follows: wide channel, 2287.5 cm2 (0.036); pool, 1425.0 cm2 (0.029); narrow channel, 1162.5 cm2 (0.033). depths of the wide and narrow channels were the same, although water veloc- ities in the narrow channel were about twice as fast as in wide channel (5.79 m ×1.22 m) – 7.06 sq.m. lower wide channel upper wide channel pool 4.64 sq.m. flow observational area flow narrow channel (4.27 m × 0.61 m) – 2.60 sq.m. 630 fig. 1. plan of the experimental stream tank, showing locations of the underwater covers. filled-in rectangles represent covers 15 cm in length and 16 cm high (with the base buried a few cms in the substrate), and with the open end facing upstream. the open ﬁgures represent covers 15 cm in le- the right-angled ngth and 11.5 cm high, structures and the double rectangles representing covers facing sideways. facing downstream, depth-cover responses of juvenile salmon (a) (b) fig. 2. covers, being used by a salmon (a), and a brown_trout (b). fish are facing upstream. table 1. types of cover and usage (%) by ﬁsh. types of cover (widths, cm) numbers of covers (%) salmon salmon fry trout trout fry 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 s (10) dn (10) 3 (7.5) 6 (15.0) 12 (30.0) 6 (15.0) 3 (7.5) 5 (12.5) 5 (12.5) 2.2 16.3 43.1 12.6 12.3 9.5 4.0 2.0 16.0 20.0 10.0 8.0 16.0 28.0 0 45.5 50.0 30.7 12.5 2.3 0 12.0 4.0 36.0 8.0 8.0 0 24.0 s covers were facing sideways;

salmon fry, 5.87 cm (±0.22) – 2.24 g (±0.23); brown_trout, 11.56 cm (±0.61) – 18.22 g (±3.72); brown_trout fry, 6.59 cm (±0.44) – 3.48 g (±0.76). ranges in f.l. were as follows: 9.2–15.3 for salmon parr; 4.5–6.9 cm for salmon fry; 9.1–16.5 cm for trout; and 4.9–8.6 cm for trout fry. fish were measured when placed into the stream tank and at the end of an experiment. speciﬁc growth rate was measured as an instantaneous rate of increase in weight (logew2)logew1) per day ·100, where w1 was weight (g) of a ﬁsh at introduction into the tank, and w2 was the weight at the end of the experiment. experimental procedures six salmon parr and four salmon underyearlings (fry) were used in each experiment. in experiments with trout brown_trout, six trout and four fry were introduced with the salmon, both species were intro- duced at the same time. fry were not marked, but salmon and trout were marked with individual brands in anterior, mid or posterior parts of the body, for individual recognition (gibson 1981), so that they could be identiﬁed in behavioural observations and for individual growth. fish were introduced to the tank 5 days before observations were made to allow behavioural stabilisation. fish were fed to excess daily, about 50 ml, after observations, with a mixture of chopped frozen squid (illex illcebrosus) and frozen capelin (mallotus villosus) eggs, the machinery end of the tank, between the screens. these items were suspended and circulated around the tank for some time, allowing distribution of the food to all ﬁsh. introduced at an experiment consisted of 10 observations, gen- erally, two observations being made per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. in analyses, these times were not differentiated. position of each ﬁsh was recorded on a diagram of the tank for each observa- tion. occasionally, a ﬁsh would be moving, in which case, its ﬁnal resting. spot for the observation period would be recorded. estimated height above the substrate, and other pertinent observations were recorded on the diagram sheet. behavioural observa- tions were made during ﬁve observation periods in each of four experiments. in two experiments, salmon were the sole species, and in two, both salmon and trout were present. each ﬁsh was observed for 10 min, with a total observation time for individual ﬁsh of 200 min. agonistic interactions were recorded on a hand held tape recorder. the agonistic acts recorded were those suggested by gibson (1973), hartman (1965) and keenleyside & yamamoto (1962). juvenile salmon are capable of adjusting their skin colouration according to their surroundings in their habitat substratum of the river. colouration can also change rapidly in relation to dominance hierarchy, e.g., in connection with aggressive encounters (keen- leyside & yamamoto 1962; o’connor et al. 1999). in connection with observing the agonistic behaviour, the 631 gibson & erkinaro skin colouration of dominant and subordinate ﬁsh was noted as described by keenleyside & yamamoto (1962). experimental treatments were made at three water depths, measured above the substrate of the channels: 40 cm; 30 cm; 20 cm. salmon alone were tested at 40 cm for ﬁve replicates, at 30 cm with two replicates, and at 20 cm with two replicates. salmon alone were tested at the three depths of 40 cm, 30 cm and 20 cm in two sets (same ﬁsh in a set, but different ﬁsh in each set). two replicates at 40 cm water depth were carried out with different ﬁsh, and one after trout were removed from a previous experiment. in the two sets of 40 cm, 30 cm and 20 cm, the ﬁsh were in the tank for 20 days. in the other two 40 cm replicates, the ﬁsh were in the tank for 10 days, and in one for 45 days. salmon in association with brown_trout were tested at 40 cm with three replicates, and at 30 cm and 20 cm with one treatment each. the same ﬁsh were used in a set of 40 cm, 30 cm and 20 cm depths, and were in the tank for a total of 32 days. two replicates at 40 cm depth, each was performed with new ﬁsh, ﬁsh being in the tank for 13 days in one, and 10 days in the other. statistical tests were performed using spss sigmastat 3.0. results distribution of salmon more salmon parr were in the channels than in the pool: 93.6%; 96.8%; 90.9%, at 40 cm, 30 cm and 20 cm depths respectively. at 40 cm channel depth, 36.4% of salmon parr in all sections of the tank were under covers. at 30 cm channel depth, the proportion of parr under covers increased to 60.7%, and at 20 cm channel depth 79.4% of parr were under covers (table 2; fig. 3). a kruskal–wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks showed that the differences in the median values amongst treatment groups were greater than would be expected by chance, and that there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference (p = < 0.001). salmon fry used the covers less at 40 cm channel depth (p = 0.011, k–w). mean numbers under covers in the channels (± se) were: 0.91 (0.539) at 20 cm; 0.70 (±0.163) at 30 cm; 0.39 (±0.095) at 40 cm. unfortunately, only 71% of salmon fry were seen, so that their distribution that we recorded in relation to covers is not precise, but we present it as a probable trend. it the unobserved fry were concealed amongst the pebbles. is likely that with their small size, distribution of salmon with trout in the presence of brown_trout, the proportion of salmon parr under covers in all sections at the three channel depths of 40 cm, 30 cm, 20 cm, were, respec- tively: 53.9%; 53.3%; and 63.3%. however, in these experiments, greater proportions of salmon parr were in the pool than in the experiments with salmon alone (fig. 4, table 3). the differences in relative numbers of salmon parr in the pool between salmon parr alone and with trout present were signiﬁcant at 20 cm depth (p = < 0.001; mann–whitney u-test), 30 cm (p = < 0.001) and 40 cm (p = 0.008). also there was a signiﬁcant difference (p = < 0.001, k–w) between numbers of salmon parr in the pool at the three depths. if only the salmon parr in the channels are considered, the proportions under cover for the 40 cm, 30 cm and 20 cm depths were: 56.4%; 75.8%; and 100%, respec- tively (fig. 5). however, most salmon parr were in the pool. there was a signiﬁcant difference (p = < 0.001, m–w) between numbers of salmon under cover alone and with trout at the 20 cm depth, and at the 30 cm depth, but no signiﬁcant difference at 40 cm (p = 0.306, m–w). there appeared to be a tendency for trout in the channels to use cover more at the shallower depths (69.6% at 20 cm, 65.5% at 30 cm and 45.3% at 40 cm), but the use of cover by trout in the channels was not signiﬁcantly different at the three depths (p = 0.651, k–w), although the use of cover in the pool at the three channel depths was signiﬁcantly table 2. the distribution (mean numbers, with ± se) of salmon parr at three channel depths (40 cm, 30 cm, 20 cm), in each section, and mean total (and %) for ﬁsh in the open, or under cover. type selection upper wide channel lower wide channel narrow channel pool channel depth (cm) 40 40 30 30 20 20 632 open n = cover n = open n = cover n = open n = cover n = 1.52 ± 0.193 82 0.83 ± 0.133 45 0.909 ± 0.211 10 1.59 ± 0.244 86 1.20 ± 0.178 65 1.091 ± 0.251 12 1.455 ± 0.282 2.091 ± 0.343 16 23 0.46 ± 0.132 0.31 ± 0.087 25 0.19 ± 0.088 10 17 0 0.273 ± 0.141 0.091 ± 0.091 3 0 mean total for all sections 3.88 (63.6%) 270 2.22 (36.4%) 120 2.36 (39.3%) 26 1 0.091 ± 0.091 3.64 (60.7%) 1 40 0.273 ± 0.195 0.455 ± 0.157 0.091 ± 0.091 0.455 ± 0.157 1.27 (20.6%) 6 10 2.091 ± 0.285 2.545 ± 0.312 46 56 1 0 10 0.091 ± 0.091 2 27 4.73 (79.4%) 104 (a) 2.0 40 cm depth (b)  r r a p n o m a s . l o n  n a e m open cover open 64% (n = 210) cover 36% (n = 120) 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0  r r a p n o m a s . l o n  n a e m depth-cover responses of juvenile salmon 30 cm depth open 39% (n = 26) cover 61% (n = 40) 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 upr wide ch lwr wide ch pool nrw ch upr wide ch lwr wide ch pool nrw ch location (c) 3.0 20 cm depth location r r a p  n o m a s . l  o n n a e m 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 open 21% (n = 27) cover 79% (n = 104) upr wide ch lwr wide ch pool nrw ch location fig. 3. the relative use of covers by salmon parr (mean number of ﬁsh ± se) at the three channel depths (a, 40 cm;

1.30 (±0.260) at 30 cm; and 0.75 (±0.123) at 40 cm, when only salmon were present; compared with: 0.70 (±0.153) at 20 cm; 0.90 (±0.10) at 30 cm; 0.724 (±0.156) at 40 cm when trout were present. the difference at the 20 and 30 cm depths with and without trout presence was signiﬁcant (p = 0.023; k– w). when trout were present, salmon fry showed more frequent occurrence in the lower wide channel at 40 cm channel depth than when alone (1.241 (±0.162) cf 0.436 (±0.0958) (p = 0.009, m–w). however, only 63.3–66.7% of salmon fry were seen when trout were present, so that these observations should be accepted with caution. trout fry were seen most frequently in the upper wide channel (1.0 (±0.149) – 1.3 (±0.153), and their use of covers did not change signiﬁcantly with depths. however, only 64.5%–76.7% of trout fry were seen. the widest covers were used mostly, related to their availability (table 1). the covers facing downstream were little used by the larger ﬁsh, but were used relatively more by the fry. fish using these down- stream covers faced downstream, towards the light. fish using the other covers faced upstream. agonistic behaviour trout dominated the salmon, and initiated more attacks than the salmon (fig. 6). the difference in the median values between salmon and trout displace- ments is greater than would be expected by chance (p = 0.006, m–w). agonistic behaviours were used in different pro- portions by the two species (fig. 7). salmon used ‘charge’ (40.4%) more often than the other acts, and ‘lateral display’ was only 8.8% of the agonistic acts. ‘frontal display’ was not seen at all by salmon in these observations. trout used ‘charge’ as 22.5% of the acts, but in contrast to salmon ‘lateral display’ was 14.7% of the acts, and ‘frontal display’ 17.8% of the acts. ‘approach’ had a greater proportion with trout (27.7%) than with salmon (17.5%). a dominant brown_trout generally was of a light fawn colour, silver underneath. other trout were relatively light coloured, but none of the trout displayed the blotchy dark colouration that can be seen in subordinate trout (personal observation). in contrast, when the trout 633 gibson & erkinaro (a) 1.2 l r r a p n o m a s f o n o i t r o p o r p 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 (b) 1.0 r r a p n o m a s f l  o n o i t r o p o r p 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 salmon alone channels pool 20 30 40 water depths (cm) salmon with trout present channels pool 20 30 40 water depth (cm) fig. 4. the relative use of the channels and the pool by salmon when the sole species (a), and when trout were present (b), at 20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm channel depths. were present, all the salmon showed subordinate colouration. this changed when the trout were removed, and the dominant salmon became light coloured, associated with territorial behaviour and feeding. the salmon showed variation in light colour- ing of dominant ﬁsh to the dark and mottled colour- ation of subordinate ﬁsh, with a gradation indicating relative dominance. the dominant ﬁsh was generally at the upper end of the wide channel. distance of the alpha ﬁsh to its nearest neighbour was estimated with brown_trout, with mean distance of 1.08 m (se ±0.067), and with salmon (no trout present), with a mean distance of 1.11 m (se ±0.087). station and biomass in general, salmon held station closer to the substrate than trout, and frequently in contact with the substrate, both in the open and under cover (table 4; fig. 2). the wide channel was the preferred section. with )2) salmon as the sole species the mean biomass (g.m in this section at the three depths ranged from 21.6 (se ±0.984) to 22.6 (se ±0.915) (fig. 8). with salmon and trout together, at the shallower depths dominant trout displaced ﬁsh to the pool. at 40 cm depth, the mean biomass in the wide channel of the two species was )2 (se ±1.415), but at 20 cm depth mean 24.6 g.m biomass was less, 10.7 g.m )2 (se ±1.431). salmon as the sole species had a mean speciﬁc growth rate of 0.667, with a range of 2.557 to – 0.479. the mean speciﬁc growth rate for weight of salmon parr with trout was 0.623, with a range of 1.225 to – 0.313. that for the trout, with salmon, was 0.705, with a range of 2.045 to – 0.384. dominant ﬁsh showed best growth. discussion cover use some salmon used covers at all experimental depths. however, the increase in cover use with reduced water depths shows that water depth itself can be considered as cover for juvenile salmon. although this may be implied in other studies, where depth is considered as a variable inﬂuencing distribution of young salmon (e.g., gibson 1993;

(2007) found in an experimental stream tank instream cover use declined with increasing that sediment and was not observed above )1 ( 22 nephelo-metric turbidity units), and 60 mg l suggested that from predators. the salmon parr alone in our experiments preferred the wide (upstream) channel to the pool at all depths, but unexpectedly had a higher proportion in the pool when brown_trout were present, most likely due to greater aggression of the trout in the channel. the use of cover by stream ﬁsh is probably a response to avian predators at the surface and other turbid water provides cover levels predators in the stream itself, such as other ﬁsh species. power (1984) describes such a mechanism for distribution of armoured catﬁsh (loricariidae) in a panamanian stream, where water depth was consid- ered as cover from predatory birds. small catﬁsh were restricted to shallow water by predation from pisciv- orous ﬁsh in deeper water, and larger loracariids avoided shallow water where they were vulnerable to ﬁshing birds, although the preferred attached algal food was more abundant in the shallower water. millidine et al. (2006) concluded that shelter use not only reduces the risk of predation, but also affects metabolic advantages, and that standard metabolic rate of juvenile salmon can be a function of habitat structure in a stream. this implies that habitat complexity, including sheltering elements, may have major implications for growth and survival. similarly, speciﬁc intermediate depths have been shown to maximise the carrying capacity and recruitment of brown_trout (lobo´ n-cervia´ 2007). ice cover, provid- ing shelter, has been shown to reduce resting metab- olism of juvenile atlantic salmon by one-third compared with ﬁsh kept without ice cover (finstad 635 gibson & erkinaro table 4. mean heights, cm (± sd), held above the substrate by salmon and trout, in the open and under cover, from all experiments. tank area trout (open) wide channel pool narrow channel 2.23 ± 1.09 3.27 ± 3.32 0.50 ± 0.71 trout fry (open) 2.04 ± 0.67 2.54 ± 1.51 0 (0) salmon (open) 0.39 ± 0.68 0.08 ± 0.20 0 (0) salmon fry (open) 0.64 ± 0.72 0.20 ± 0.45 0 (0) trout (cover) 4.78 ± 3.17 1.65 ± 1.06 2.18 ± 1.81 trout fry (cover) 2.76 ± 1.50 2.17 ± 1.18 2.50 ± 2.12 salmon (cover) 0.64 ± 0.70 0.14 ± 0.22 3.72 ± 2.56 salmon fry (cover) 0.71 ± 0.87 0 (0) 0 (0) depth (cm) 40 30 20 40 30 20 30  e s ± ) 1 – m . q s g ( l e n n a h c e d w s s a m o b i i 25 20 15 10 5 0 salmon salmon + trout fig. 8. the mean biomasses in the wide channel of salmon and trout at 20, 30, 40 cm depths (± se). et al. 2004). an increased metabolic rate owing to the lack of adequate shelter may therefore inﬂuence survival of juvenile salmon since the depletion of energy stores is the major source of winter mortality (huusko et al. 2007 and references therein). intra-speciﬁc competition bremset & berg (1999) suggest that young salmon are excluded from most proﬁtable feeding areas by larger and more competitive individuals. they concluded that water depth per se was of little importance for stream dwelling salmon and brown_trout, and that river bed substrata were more important for the habitat use of pool-dwelling salmon and trout than water depths and water velocity. however, the present study shows that water depth can be an important factor inﬂuencing distribution of young salmon. stream, in an experimental in newfoundland, salmon underyearlings had higher densities and range in habitat when older year classes were not present (gibson et al. 1993), and large salmon parr had a negative effect on salmon fry in later years (gibson 1995). similarly, symons & heland (1978) found that the proportion of underyearling salmon to yearlings decreased as depth increased between 20 and 40 cm, and that yearlings (>10 cm) reduced the number of underyearlings by chasing them and with predation. in an arctic river, ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 636 (2005) found that all juvenile salmon size classes were closely associated with deep and low-velocity habitats in cold water in winter and spring, and therefore, this time of year may represent a size- selective bottleneck for juvenile salmon population through intra-speciﬁc competition. young salmon are considered to be mainly diurnal feeders in the summer, but during the winter they shelter in coarse substrate during the day and become nocturnal feeders (fraser et al. 1993). however, gries et al. (1997) and gries & juanes (1998) found at temperatures ranging from 13 to 23 °c in streams of vermont, u.s.a., during the summer, a high propor- tion of young salmon shelter during the day, and feed at night, especially in a shallow stream. they presumed this behaviour was related to intra-speciﬁc competition rather than shelter from predators, but, judging from the present study, the available water depths may have had an inﬂuence on this behaviour. inter-speciﬁc competition for protection from a more the use of shelter aggressive species was shown in the experiments with brown_trout. also in the present study brown_trout displaced both salmon parr and fry from their previous distributions. brown_trout have been reported to be more aggressive than young salmon in a number of studies (e.g., kalleberg 1958; bremset & heggenes 2001; harwood et al. 2002). salvelinus_fontinalis (locally called brook_trout) is the indigenous eastern north american trout, and is less aggressive than salmon (gibson 1973), so may not have the same effect of increasing sheltering behaviour of salmon. although interspeciﬁc interactions occur, brook_trout and salmon parr cohabit in some mesohabitats, and frequently cohabit pools (e.g., gibson 2002), whereas brown_trout tend to displace salmon from slower and deeper water habitats (bremset & heggenes 2001), suggesting that brown_trout are dominant over brook_trout. also, in a stream tank study, dewald & wilzbach (1992) found that brown_trout had negative effects on brook_trout, reducing their aggression and feeding. these and other observations suggest that brown_trout are more likely to change distributions of young salmon than brook_trout, possibly including an increase in sheltering behaviour. biomass and growth concluding remarks depth-cover responses of juvenile salmon )2 to 27.3 g.m in previous experiments in a similar stream tank (gibson 1988), but at a depth of 45 cm in the channels (and 75 cm in the ‘pool’), without instream covers, the mean biomass in the wide channel varied from )2, with unlimited food, related 3.9 g.m to the species present and territorial behaviour. the )2 mean biomass in the present experiments (10.7 g. m )2) may not have been signiﬁcantly to 24.6 g.m the deeper depth, but increased by the covers at covers may do so at the shallower depths. such biomass is relatively high for a natural stream. nevertheless, salmonid biomass in enriched streams can exceed these ﬁgures (gibson & haedrich 1988; gibson & colbo 2000), probably related to ample food and a reduction of the ﬁeld of view of individuals through greater habitat heterogeneity in the natural stream (dolinsek et al. 2007). trout. similarly, in the absence of water temperature, ﬁsh size, and level of energy intake have been shown to be the most important variables affecting the growth and energetics of brown_trout (elliott 1994), which probably also applies to other salmonids. however, growth rate may be suppressed by dominant ﬁsh, probably related to suppression of feeding and to stress in subordinate ﬁsh. in the present experiments, growth of salmon was superior in a previous stream tank study with juvenile salmonids of parr size (gibson 1981), in which 24 experiments were conducted in all, using totals of 54 atlantic salmon, 46 coho (oncorhynchus_kisutch), 13 steelhead (oncorhynchus_mykiss) and 25 brook_trout, the dominant species in an experiment showed the best growth. in most situations, the dominant ﬁsh has the best growth. li & brocksen (1977) found that dominant rainbow trout as a group grew faster, grew more efﬁciently, and contained greater lipid content than the rest of the population. however, certain subordinate individuals were noted to grow faster and more efﬁciently than the alpha trout, which they thought might reﬂect greater energy expenditure in territorial defense by the alpha trout. salmon parr are frequently in contact with the substrate. however, dominant salmon hold position higher above the substrate than subordinate ﬁsh and have larger territories (gibson 1981). bremset & heggenes (2001) remark on both the horizontal and the vertical segregation of the different cohorts of salmon and brown_trout, three- dimensional habitat segregation is probably due to subordinate ﬁsh being excluded from the most proﬁtable feeding areas by higher ranked individu- als, and note that spatial segregation is an important mechanism for decreasing direct competition for resources. and that this the present study suggests that experimental stream tanks should have a depth of at least 40 cm, or with shallower depths have some form of cover, such as surface turbulence or shade cover, if the ﬁsh are to behave as they would in a natural environment. in shallow water without cover, ﬁsh may be under stress. for example, fausch & white (1986) devised a stream tank which had depths in rifﬂes at 5 cm, and maximum depth of 15 cm in the ‘pool’, with no cover. this would provide very marginal habitat of a natural stream. in their experiments they found that juvenile coho salmon grew well, and dominated both brook and brown_trout. however, most lost weight, and the highest laboratory growth rates of both trout species were much less than those measured in natural streams. also, unexpectedly, the brook_trout dominated the brown_trout, which has only been reported in a situation where brook_trout has been introduced to the natural distribution area of brown_trout in europe (korsu et al. 2007). it is possible that the experimental depths were suitable for the coho, but that the two trout species were under stress from unnatural conditions. the preferred depths of stream salmonids probably varies with ﬁsh size, species and season. further work on suitable depths as cover for other species and size classes would be useful. trout acknowledgements t. knight designed and placed most of the instream covers. the stream tank was constructed by r.f. goosny.
