miranda & hodges, 2000). increased eutrophication of freshwater systems via anthropogenic activities re- inforces naturally low oxygen levels, intensifying effects on aquatic organisms (diaz, 2001). low oxygen concentrations strongly influence fish behaviour and distribution (eby & crowder, 2002; suthers & gee, 1986; wannamaker & rice, 2000). fish select habitats containing op- timal oxygen levels to facilitate metabolic processes (kramer, 1987). in response to low do levels, fish commonly exhibit behavioural avoid- ance through horizontal and vertical migration and habitat switches (kramer, 1987; magnuson, beckel, mills, & brandt, 1985; petrosky & magnuson, 1973; spoor, 1990; wannamaker & rice, 2000). fish typically demonstrate avoidance behaviours in hypoxic waters (<2 mg/l o2), but they also avoid slightly higher suboptimal concen- trations (whitmore, warren, & doudoroff, 1960; burleson, wilhelm, & smatresk, 2001). in low do environments, fish switch habitats and diets from preferred benthic prey (macroinvertebrates) found in hypoxic areas to energetically inferior pelagic prey (zooplankton) in oxygenated areas (aku & tonn, 1999; roberts et al., 2009). although many fish avoid hypoxic waters, individuals may venture into hypoxic areas for brief foraging forays. species considered to be intolerant of hypoxic conditions have been captured in hypoxic bottom waters (roberts et al., 2009). additionally, their diets contain benthic prey items that are only located in hypoxic zones (rahel & nutzman, 1994; roberts et al., 2009, 2012). chronic exposure to hypoxic water ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:559–569. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  559 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd560  |     is detrimental to fish physiology (pollock, clarke, & dube, 2007); how- ever, limited exposure can have little effect (vanlandeghem, wahl, & suski, 2010). physiological responses such as reducing cardiovascular activity or increasing haemoglobin and haematocrit levels may help fish compensate for low do concentrations (gaulke, dennis, wahl, & suski, 2014; stecyk & farrell, 2002). fish employ several behavioural modifications to help them endure brief exposures to hypoxia without inducing phenotypic adaptations, an act that is energetically expensive (huey, hertz, & sinervo, 2003). in addition to vertical and horizontal migration, fish alter locomotory activity levels during hypoxia. swimming activity in atlantic cod, gadus morhua, and sole, solea solea, decrease in re- sponse to hypoxia (schurmann & steffensen, 1994; via, van den thillart, cattani, & cortesi, 1998). by reducing unnecessary activ- ity, less oxygen is required for metabolic processes, allowing fish to subsist longer in hypoxic waters (pauly & kinne, 2010). conversely, activity may increase with exposure in other species (petrosky & magnuson, 1973), presumably indicating attempted avoidance. gill flaring (increasing ventilation rates) circulates a larger amount of water across the gill surface in order to extract a higher amount of oxygen from the water. both of these behaviours tend to increase as oxygen concentrations decrease (hasler et al., 2009; petrosky & magnuson, 1973). aquatic surface respiration (kramer & mehegan, 1981) also increases as oxygen concentrations decrease (petrosky & magnuson, 1973). like locomotory activity, consumption is expected to decrease with oxygen as metabolic demands associated with feeding (pursuit, digestion, and assimilation) are more difficult to meet in low oxygen environments (brandt, gerken, hartman, & demers, 2009; buentello, gatlin, & neill, 2000; carlson, blocher, & herman, 1980; kramer, 1987; roberts et al., 2011). hypoxia can also act as a barrier, decreas- ing consumption by limiting access to resource- rich benthic areas (eby, crowder, mcclellan, peterson, & powers, 2005; ludsin et al., 2009; roberts et al., 2012). decreased consumption can negatively impact growth and survival of fish and can be especially consequential for juvenile fishes that need to make ontogenetic diet shifts and need to reach a greater size at age to avoid overwinter mortality or predation (eby et al., 2005; ludsin & devries, 1997). effects of low do concentrations have been well studied with re- spect to habitat selection, movements and respiration of fish (burleson et al., 2001; hasler et al., 2009; petrosky & magnuson, 1973; spoor, 1990; wannamaker & rice, 2000). however, few studies have ex- amined the influences of do on foraging behaviour. furthermore, many laboratory studies analysing effects of do fail to simulate nat- ural limnological conditions. past experiments observed effects of do on behaviour by subjecting fish to a single oxygen concentration (brandt et al., 2009; hasler et al., 2009; petrosky & magnuson, 1973) or two discrete oxygen concentrations (wannamaker & rice, 2000; whitmore, warren, & doudoroff, 1960), when in a natural setting fish are typically exposed to a gradient of oxygen concentrations. although some studies have developed oxygen gradient chambers (burleson et al., 2001; spoor, 1990), these designs do not resemble natural lim- nological water columns. largemouth bass are a popular freshwater sport fish species that are both economically and ecologically important (noble, 2002; otis, piette, keppler, & rasmussen, 1998). as generalist predators, largemouth bass use the entire water column to feed, including hy- polimnetic benthic resources (hodgson & kitchell, 1987). benthic prey resources are particularly valuable to juvenile fish that have not yet made the switch to piscivory (galarowicz, adams, & wahl, 2006; graeb, mangan, jolley, wahl, & dettmers, 2006; olson, 1996). juvenile fish may be forced to forage in hypolimnetic areas due to their smaller size. juvenile largemouth bass consumption and foraging activity decrease in the presence of predators (parkos & wahl, 2010). adult largemouth bass (a common predator) forage inshore during optimal feeding hours (sammons & maceina, 2005) while inshore movements by juvenile bass are made at night (irwin & noble, 2000). thus, juve- niles could be pushed to offshore habitats during the day to forage on benthic invertebrates located in the hypolimnion instead of littoral in- vertebrates which are difficult to locate at night (mcmahon & holanov, 1995). similarly, juvenile bluegills conducted horizontal diel migrations between littoral and pelagic areas avoiding habitat overlap with pred- ators (shoup, boswell, & wahl, 2014). lower prey resources in littoral areas may also be responsible for offshore benthic foraging (eby et al., 2005). additionally, zooplankton, invertebrates and fish species use the hypoxic hypolimnion as a refuge from predators potentially mak- ing the hypolimnion a resource rich area for hypoxia- tolerant pred- ators (domenici, lefrançois, & shingles, 2007; larsson & lampert, 2011; rahel & nutzman, 1994). although largemouth bass behaviour has been shown to be affected by low do concentrations (burleson et al., 2001), oxygen effects on foraging behaviours have not been in- vestigated. using juvenile largemouth bass, micropterus salmoides, we quantified in a laboratory, the effects of low do concentrations on foraging behaviour in a simulated summer water column (warm oxy- genated epilimnion, cool hypoxic hypolimnion). our objectives were to quantify and compare (i) consumption and (ii) feeding activities (effi- ciency, movements, and behavioural modifications) in oxygenated and deoxygenated environments. we evaluated the hypothesis that low do concentrations commonly occurring in the hypolimnion of aquatic systems during the summer can affect behaviour and decrease con- sumption by juvenile largemouth bass. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | laboratory design effects of low hypolimnetic do levels on fish were evaluated in a controlled laboratory setting by utilising stratified water columns (figure 1) similar to those created by bodamer and bridgeman (2014). to create a stratified water column, semi- clear 155 cm high, light- weight polymer fibreglass cylindrical tanks (46 cm diameter) with a sealed bottom were submerged to a third of their height (52 cm) inside of fibreglass rectangular tanks (213 × 61 × 56- cm; 530 l total volume). experimental cylindrical tanks were filled with conditioned water and deoxygenated by bubbling nitrogen gas throughout the tank column until the desired oxygen concentration was reached. french and wahlfigure 1 diagram showing tank stratification design where thermal stratification (control) was achieved using a chiller to reduce water temperature of the submerged portion of the cylindrical tank while a heater increased water temperature of the upper water column. oxygen stratification (experimental) was created by bubbling nitrogen gas throughout the tank water column to reduce oxygen content and then re- oxygenating the upper water column once thermal stratification was complete. containers placed in both the bottom and top of tanks were used to hold prey control cylindrical tanks were oxygenated by bubbling oxygen throughout the tank column. thermal stratification was achieved by decreasing water temperature inside the rectangular tanks using a water chiller (1 hp), causing water temperature inside the submerged portions of the cylindrical tanks to also decline. an 800 watt titanium heater connected to a digital temperature controller was used to heat the epilimnion upper section of the cylindrical tank, creating tempera- ture and density differences between the bottom and top areas of the tanks sufficient to maintain stratification. in experimental tanks, once stratification was complete, the epilimnion was re- oxygenated (via low- pressure flow of pure oxygen introduced with an air stone) to a saturated concentration. the resulting tank water column simu- lated lake and reservoir water columns during the summer consisting of a warm oxygenated epilimnion, transitional metalimnion and cool deoxygenated hypolimnion. for trials, six cylindrical tanks were placed in three rectangular tanks (two per tank) each containing a chiller unit. temperature re- gimes of water columns used in tanks were established to reflect those observed in water columns of several freshwater illinois lakes during summer months (june, july, august) over a 5 year period from 2007 to 2012. the epilimnion (upper section) of the tanks was kept at 28°c, whereas the hypolimnion (lower section below the thermocline) was kept at 15°c. the metalimnion (middle section directly above the ther- mocline) was unregulated. 2.2 | study animals juvenile largemouth bass used in the experiment were collected from central illinois lakes and transported to the kaskaskia biological station, sullivan, il, usa in large (378 l) aerated tanks. bass were held inside of fibreglass rectangular tanks (530 l) where water tem- perature was maintained at 21 ± 2.0°c, and do concentrations were maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 mg/l. a total of 144 bass ranging from 70 to 90 mm total length (mean 77.5 ± 0.54 mm se) were used for trials. fish were held and fed a diet of frozen and live bloodworms,     |  561 chironmus, and california blackworms, lumbriculus variegatus, for at least fourteen days before use. fish were moved from rectangular tanks to thermally stratified, uniformly oxygenated cylindrical accli- mation tanks and fed for 3 days prior to their use in trials. they were then moved to thermally stratified treatment tanks with the appro- priate oxygen treatment and starved 24 hr prior to the start of each trial to ensure similar acclimation and hunger levels. preliminary tri- als confirmed this acclimation period to be sufficient for fish to be- come familiar with the tank and exhibit normal foraging behaviour. only healthy individuals, with no visible disease or malformations, and observed to have normal swimming and feeding behaviour were used in the experiment. tanks were surrounded by opaque curtains to prevent fish from being disturbed during acclimation and trial peri- ods. california blackworms, a palatable, live prey source that exhibits movement and burrowing behaviour similar to other aquatic benthic macroinvertebrates, were used as prey during trials. 2.3 | experimental protocol to test foraging behaviour, we used a 3 × 6 factorial design with three distinct hypolimnion oxygen concentrations each occurring with six different feeding treatments. each treatment combination was repli- cated eight times for a total of 144 trials. trials were ordered using a balanced incomplete block design generated using statistical software (proc plan; sas® version 9.2) to ensure that treatment combina- tions were randomly assigned and interspersed throughout blocks. to control for temporal variation, week was used as a blocking fac- tor. all trials were conducted in one of six identical tanks described previously. treatments used hypolimnetic oxygen included 1.5 mg/l, 3.0 mg/l, and a saturated concentration that does not stress large- mouth bass lowest oxygen concentration (1.5 mg/l) is below the critical oxygen tension of largemouth bass and is a level that largemouth bass markedly avoid (whitmore et al., 1960; yamanaka, kohmatsu, & yuma, 2007). studies have also shown (8.0–9.0 mg/l). the french and wahl562  |     that largemouth bass exhibit avoidance of oxygen concentrations near 3.0 mg/l, but not above 4.0 mg/l (burleson et al., 2001; hasler et al., 2009; whitmore et al., 1960). as generalist predators, largemouth bass feed in both littoral and benthic areas (garcía- berthou, 2002). feeding treatments consisted of six treatments with prey occurring in the epilimnion, hypolimnion or both layers of the cylindrical tanks. to hold prey, two square plastic containers (10.5 × 10.5 × 6- cm) were placed in each cylindrical tank. one container was set on the bottom of the tank in the hypolimnion and the other container was suspended in the epilimnion using clear monofilament line attached to the outside of the tank. containers were filled with a thin layer of sand to simulate substrate and allow the prey to burrow. the six feeding treatments included: (1) similar densi- ties (1.25 g) of prey in top and bottom containers (equal prey amounts), (2) prey (2.50 g) in the bottom container only (bottom only), (3) prey (2.50 g) in the top container only (top only), (4) no prey in either con- tainer (no prey), (5) a low prey density (0.50 g) in the bottom container only and (6) a high prey density (4.50 g) in the bottom container only. the first treatment (1) was to test juvenile largemouth bass foraging behaviour with an equal amount of prey in both layers. the next two treatments (2 and 3) tested foraging behaviour in each the hypolim- nion and epilimnion when prey were absent in the other layer. the fourth treatment (4) tested bass distribution among different oxygen concentrations in the absence of prey. the last two feeding treatments (5 and 6) in combination with feeding treatment 2 were used to test the effects of varying prey densities on bass foraging in the hypo- limnion. prey densities for treatments 1–3 were established through feeding trials conducted in 38 l aquaria to determine how much prey could be consumed by juvenile largemouth bass (70–90 mm) during a trial period. then, 0.50 g of prey was added to that amount to ensure food was not limited. the high prey density used in treatment 6 was chosen to ensure there was enough prey available for consumption, and perception of a high prey density area for the duration of the trial (abrahams & dill, 1989). additional trials were conducted to test tank effects on juvenile largemouth bass positional and foraging preference (i.e. was there a bias towards occupying and foraging in the top or bottom portions of the tank). these trials included two feeding treat- ments, (1) and (4) from above, a uniform temperature (21 ± 2.0°c) and a saturated oxygen concentration (8.0–9.0 mg/l) throughout the en- tire water column. each feeding treatment was replicated eight times. trials lasted for 1 hr and consisted of one fish per trial. to avoid any bias relating to experience, no individual fish was used more than once. directly prior to the beginning of a trial, heaters were removed and temperature and oxygen readings were taken in the epilimnion, met- alimnion and hypolimnion of the trial tank to ensure levels were con- sistent with set treatment levels (ysi 85 temperature and do meter; ysi incorporated. columbus, oh, usa). prey were carefully placed into the appropriate containers using pvc pipes to ensure prey were only located inside containers. cameras (auc- 75, atlantis camera, englewood, nj, usa) suspended directly above the tanks captured movements and foraging behaviours of fish for the duration of the trial. temperature and oxygen levels were measured at the end of each trial to ensure consistency throughout the trial duration. remaining prey in bottom and top containers were siphoned and weighed to the nearest 0.001 g. consumption was determined by subtracting post- trial prey weight from pretrial prey weight. any prey that fell from the top container to the bottom were identified on video and corrected in consumption values by adding or subtracting the weight of the num- ber of prey that fell. trial recordings were used to quantify forays and time spent below the thermocline, strikes and rejections (expelling or escapement of prey) and foraging behaviour of fish. quantified be- haviours included gill flaring, aquatic surface respiration and trans- porting prey above the thermocline for consumption, herein termed vertical prey transfer. tanks were siphoned for debris, and a partial water replacement was performed after each trial. additionally, tanks were cleaned with a full water replacement every two weeks. 2.4 | statistical analysis for tank effect (positional and foraging preference) trials, differences in consumption (treatment 1) and occupation time (treatments 1 and 4) by fish, between the top and bottom portions of the tank were tested using paired t tests. all other analyses were performed using a linear mixed model incorporating fixed effects of oxygen concen- tration, feeding treatment, interactions between these factors and a random blocking factor (week). when significant main effects were found for the fixed factor oxygen, post hoc comparisons between levels were assessed within feeding treatments using fisher’s lsd tests which preserves experimentwise type 1 error rate when the number of treatment groups is equal to three (meier, 2006). when feeding treatment or oxygen by feeding treatment interactions were significant, comparisons between levels of feeding treatments within an oxygen concentration were made using linear contrasts with a tukey modification to control family- wise error rates. for consump- tion and foraging analysis, total fish size (mm) was used as a covariate. consumption was calculated as the proportion of available food con- sumed. time spent below the thermocline was calculated as a propor- tion of the trial time fish remained below the thermocline. effects of prey density were examined by comparing fish distribution at each oxygen concentration across prey densities. behavioural data from feeding treatments 1, 2, 5 and 6 were compared across oxygen con- centrations. all errors were tested for assumptions of normality using a shapiro–wilk’s test and homogenous variances using levene’s test. in cases where model residuals did not conform to a normal distribu- tion, an arcsine transformation was applied to proportion data and a square root transformation was applied to count data. all analyses were performed using the sas® system version 9.2 (sas institute inc., cary, nc), and all tests were considered significant at an alpha of 0.05. 3 |  results dissolved oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion did not fluc- tuate more than ±0.15 mg/l from treatment levels (1.5, 3.0, 8.0– 9.0 mg/l) during trial periods. dissolved oxygen concentrations within the epilimnion remained between 8.0 and 9.0 mg/l, whereas french and wahl    |  563 (f2,47 = 0.78, p = .47). consumption in the epilimnion did not change through time (week;

f11,47 = 1.47, p = .20) or with fish size (p = .12). when prey were equally available in the top and bottom, consumption at all three hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations was different from each other (p < .02; figure 2a). consumption in hypolimnion was less than con- sumption in the epilimnion at all hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations (p < .05). when prey were only in the bottom, consumption at all three hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations was again different from each other (p < .04; figure 2b). when comparing feeding treatments with prey in the bottom only to feeding treatments with prey in the top only, consumption in the hypolimnion of the bottom- only treat- ments was less than consumption in the epilimnion of the top only treatments at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/l (p < .01), indicating reduced consump- tion at lower oxygen concentrations. however, consumption in the hypolimnion was not significantly different from consumption in the epilimnion at saturated concentrations (p = .34), suggesting that while reduced oxygen concentrations were responsible for decreased con- sumption, reduced temperatures had no effect on consumption. 3.2 | distribution below thermocline time spent by fish below the thermocline was significantly affected by oxygen concentration (f2,95 = 38.13, p < .01) and feeding treat- ment (f3,95 = 12.05, p < .01) as well as the interaction between these two factors (f6,95 = 3.83, p < .01; figure 3a). in feeding treatments with prey in both the top and bottom or no prey in either area, time spent below the thermocline significantly decreased with oxygen at each concentration (p < .01). when prey were in the bottom only, fish spent less time below the thermocline at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/l than at saturated levels (p < .01). similarly, when prey were in the top only, fish spent less time below the thermocline at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/l than at saturated levels (p < .01). time spent below the thermocline within an oxygen concentration was not significantly different among feeding treatments at oxygen concentrations of 1.5 or 3.0 mg/l. at saturated concentrations, time spent below the thermocline in feeding treat- ments with prey in the bottom of the tanks was significantly higher than in those without prey located in the bottom (p < .01; figure 3a). furthermore, time spent below the thermocline was higher when prey density was higher (feeding treatment 2 compared to 1; p = .05). fish also made fewer visits below the thermocline when oxygen concentrations were lower. number of trips below the thermocline was affected by oxygen concentration (f2,95 = 19.93, p < .01) and feed- ing treatment (f3,95 = 8.96, p < .01), but not the interaction between these two factors (f6,95 = 1.26, p = .29). when prey were available in both the top and bottom, the number of trips below the thermocline significantly decreased with oxygen concentration (p < .05; figure 3b). when prey were in the bottom only, the number of trips was fewer at figure 2 consumption (proportion consumed) of available prey across three oxygen concentrations (saturated, 3.0 mg/l and 1.5 mg/l). different letters indicate significant differences in consumption in the hypolimnion (dark bars) and epilimnion (grey bars) across oxygen concentrations when prey were available in both the top and bottom of the tank (treatment 1; a) and when prey were available in only the top (grey bars) or bottom (dark bars) portions of the tank (treatments 2 and 3; b). asterisks indicate significant differences in consumption between the hypolimnion and epilimnion within each oxygen concentration in the metalimnion, they ranged from 7.0 to 9.0 mg/l. temperature measurements remained constant in the hypolimnion at 15°c were between 27 and 29°c in the epilimnion and ranged from 20 to 24°c in the metalimnion. in tank effect (positional and foraging preference) trials, fish showed no foraging preference towards the top or bottom portions of the tank as consumption values between the two areas did not differ (treatment 1; t = −1.31, p = .23). time spent in the top of the tank also did not differ from time spent in the bottom when prey were equally available in both areas (treatment 1; t = 1.42, p = .20) or in the absence of prey (treatment 4;

carlson et al., 1980; stewart, shumway, & doudoroff, 1967; wu, 2002). however, these studies assume that fish are chronically exposed to a single oxygen concen- tration and consumption declines through decreased appetite and ac- tivity (kramer, 1987; pauly & kinne, 2010). in contrast, our findings largely suggest decreased consumption through limited access to prey (i.e. avoidance behaviour of hypoxia) as fish spent a greater amount of time below the thermocline at saturated oxygen concentrations than at reduced concentrations. in addition to avoidance behaviour, we observed decreased prey handling efficiency at hypoxic oxygen concentrations. fish were over four times less likely to successfully capture prey at 1.5 mg/l than at saturated concentrations. reduced foraging ability in response to hypoxia has been observed in green crabs (brante & hughes, 2001), but is seldom documented in fish, es- pecially freshwater species. however, largemouth bass contain less food in their stomach during hypoxic periods (brown, aday, & rice, 2015). furthermore, swimming activity can increase as fish are initially subjected to hypoxic waters, likely in the search for oxygenated wa- ters (pollock et al., 2007; brandt et al., 2009). reductions in foraging efficiency coupled with rapid swimming activity to limit time spent in hypoxic waters most likely contribute to decreased hypolimnetic consumption at low oxygen concentrations. distribution below the thermocline was largely influenced by oxy- gen concentration; although prey availability and density also played a role. however, the effect of prey availability and density was only ap- parent at saturated concentrations. in feeding treatments containing prey in the saturated hypolimnion, fish made more trips and spent a larger proportion of time below the thermocline compared to feeding treatments without prey. furthermore, fish spent a larger proportion of time in the hypolimnion when it contained a greater prey density. when prey were located in the hypolimnion at reduced oxygen con- centrations, differences in distribution were only observed between feeding treatments with high prey densities. at high prey densities, fish made more trips and spent more time below the thermocline com- pared to feeding treatments containing lower prey densities. these results suggest that although reduced oxygen strongly deterred fish from the hypolimnion, high prey densities were able to offset some of the effect of low oxygen on distribution. similarly, sufficient amounts of prey offset the effect of predation risk on foraging fish (abrahams & dill, 1989). several studies documented fish willing to endure hypoxic conditions in order to consume energetically rich macroinvertebrate prey (rahel & nutzman, 1994; roberts et al., 2009, 2012). presumably, the costs of venturing into these hypoxic environments are offset by the benefits obtained from increased prey density or energetically su- perior prey resources found in benthic areas. juvenile largemouth bass displayed several behaviours at low ox- ygen concentrations that were not observed in normoxic conditions. behavioural modifications in response to low do concentrations are documented for various freshwater fish species, including largemouth bass (hasler et al., 2009; petrosky & magnuson, 1973). presumably, in an attempt to maximise oxygen uptake, fish were observed utilising gill flaring and aquatic surface respiration during or directly after hy- poxic exposure. altered behaviours may serve as coping mechanisms when fish are exposed to hypoxia and can also be utilised by fish to exploit hypoxic waters (hasler et al., 2009; rahel & nutzman, 1994). however, these behaviours are energetically expensive and may make juvenile bass more vulnerable to predation (pollock et al., 2007). we also observed a unique behaviour, vertical prey transfer, which has not been documented before. individual fish were frequently observed using vertical prey transfer as a means of consuming prey located in the hypoxic hypolimnion. other studies exploring consumption in response to reduced oxygen concentrations may have missed this behaviour due to use of a uniform oxygen concentration, uniform tem- perature, mobile prey source or by conducting field studies where such observations are not possible. by bringing invertebrate prey above the thermo/oxycline for consumption and digestion, fish conceivably re- duce energetic costs associated with prolonged exposure to hypoxic conditions and increase food conversion efficiency, which is reduced at concentrations <4.0 mg/l (stewart et al., 1967). vertical prey trans- fer may not be feasible in deeper lakes where the costs of repeated dives in and out of the hypoxic zone could outweigh the benefits of captured prey. in stratified lakes, differences in temperature are often observed above and below the thermocline. temperature, like do, is a major de- terminant of fish distribution and behaviour (carter, weber, dettmers, & wahl, 2012; hanson, hasler, cooke, suski, & philipp, 2008; kramer & smith, 1962). intra- seasonal temperature fluctuations in aquatic systems elicit vertical and horizontal migration by fish seeking to maximise their energetic intake and growth by experiencing various optimal thermal regions (wurtsbaugh & neverman, 1988). for large- mouth bass, optimal growth temperature is around 25°c (niimi & beamish, 1974). we did not measure the effect of temperature, but there was evidence of a temperature bias highlighted by bass prefer- ence for the epilimnion (20–28°c) at saturated hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. preference towards the epilimnion was not observed in trials with a uniform temperature. largemouth bass were acclimated to 21 ± 2.0°c before trial use, so it is expected they would select for warmer epilimnetic temperatures. temperature biases were further reflected in consumption values between the hypolimnion and epilim- nion when prey location varied and oxygen concentrations were satu- rated. when prey were equally available in both the top and bottom, consumption was lower in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion. however, when prey were limited to the bottom only, consumption was not different compared to when prey were limited to the top only. in our study, largemouth bass preferred to forage in an environment with warmer temperatures if prey types and densities were similar both above and below the thermocline. however, when prey were located in the bottom only (15°c), bass disregarded temperature preference to french and wahlforage. in contrast, we did not observe the same trade- off at reduced oxygen concentrations. although there was decreased consumption by fish at low oxygen concentrations, such environments do not act as absolute barriers to fish foraging. fish were observed swimming into the hypolimnion at our lowest oxygen concentration to consume prey. previous studies found evidence of fish foraging in hypoxic environments (rahel & nutzman, 1994; roberts et al., 2012). however, these hypoxic for- aging forays tend to be brief, energetically expensive, and may not occur commonly in environments with extreme hypoxia (rahel & nutzman, 1994). thus, low concentrations of do have the potential to limit access to prey resources below the oxycline, which may have repercussions on the timing of ontogenetic diet shifts to piscivory and overwinter survival of juvenile bass (ludsin & devries, 1997). these effects would be expected to become more substantial in lakes with small or resource depleted littoral zones. resource depletion can occur through increasing fish densities in littoral areas due to hypoxia avoid- ance behaviour (campbell & rice, 2014). in such systems, reliance on offshore benthic prey resources can be considerable (lewin, okun, & mehner, 2004). juveniles could also be displaced from heavily vege- tated littoral zones that are typically hypoxic and can become particu- larly heated during the summer, making them an unfavourable habitat for fish or prey (miranda & hodges, 2000). low concentrations of hypolimnetic do are prevalent in lakes and reservoirs for several months during the summer due to stratification. increases in anthropogenic inputs to these systems may intensify and extend periods of bottom hypoxia. we could only reduce hypolim- netic oxygen concentration in tanks to 1.5 mg/l and still have stable stratification between layers. our hypoxic zone depth was also limited to the submerged portion of the tanks. natural levels of hypoxia can occur at both lower and deeper levels than we could generate in this experiment. however, our results still clearly demonstrate low oxy- gen effects on juvenile largemouth bass consumption and behaviour. consumption should be expected to decrease further at levels of ex- treme hypoxia, deeper hypoxic areas or as a result of other environmen- tal factors such as turbidity (rahel & nutzman, 1994; vanlandeghem, carey, & wahl, 2011). decreased consumption through exposure to reduced oxygen levels likely lead to subsequent decreases in growth. our trials were too brief to measure growth, but juvenile largemouth bass exposed to low oxygen concentrations exhibit reduced consump- tion and growth compared with bass kept at higher oxygen concentra- tions (stewart et al., 1967). density- dependent reductions in growth can also occur through crowding of oxygenated areas (campbell & rice, 2014). future research should investigate growth rates and ener- getic costs related to foraging behaviour in stratified systems to better understand consequences of reduced oxygen concentrations on fish populations. acknowledgements funding for this project was provided in part by federal aid in sport fish restoration project f- 135- r administered through the illinois department of natural resources (idnr) division of fisheries. we     |  567 thank d. stephenson, j. ferencak, j. mick and d. bruce for coordi- nating activities within the division of fisheries, idnr. we thank the staff and students of the kaskaskia biological stations, particularly l. einfalt for her laboratory assistance. we also thank betsy bodamer- scarbro (university of toledo) for providing insight into design of the stratification system and the several reviewers who provided valuable feedback. references abrahams, m. v., & dill, l. m.
