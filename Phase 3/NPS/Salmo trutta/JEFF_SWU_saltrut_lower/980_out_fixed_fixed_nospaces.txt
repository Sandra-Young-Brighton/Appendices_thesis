usually vulnerable to various aquatic and avian predators. to compromise between foraging and antipredator activity, they need exact and reliable information about current predation risk. among direct predator-induced cues, visual and olfactory signals are considered to be most important. food intake rates and prey-size selectivity of laboratory-reared, naive young-of-the-year (yoy) perch, perca ﬂuviatilis, were studied in experiments with daphnia magna of two size classes: 2.8 and 1.3 mm as prey and northern pike, esox lucius, as predator. neither total intake rate nor prey-size selectivity was modiﬁed by predator kairomones alone (water from an aquarium with a pike was pumped into the test aquaria) under daylight conditions. visual presentation of pike reduced total food intake by perch. this effect was signiﬁcantly more pronounced (synergistic) when visual and olfactory cues were presented simultaneously to foraging perch. moreover, the combination of cues caused a signiﬁcant shift in prey-size selection, expressed as a reduced proportion of large prey in the diet. our observations demonstrate that predator-induced olfactory cues alone are less important modiﬁers of the feeding behaviour of naive yoy perch than visual cues under daylight conditions. however, pike odour acts as a modulatory stimulus enhancing the effects of visual cues, which trigger an innate response in perch. v. n. mikheev1, j. wanzenbo¨ck2, a. f. pasternak3 1a.n. severtsov institute of ecology and evolution, russian academy of sciences, moscow, russia, 2institute of limnology, austrian

accepted for publication december 20, 2005 introduction young ﬁsh are continually faced with conﬂicting time demands imposed by foraging and predator avoidance (werner & gilliam 1984; lima & dill 1990; mikheev 2000) and often exhibit threat-sensitive trade-offs between foraging and antipredator responses (godin 1990; lima & bednekoff 1999). prey may respond to predation risk by a reduction in time spent foraging (e.g., hiding); however, this can only be sustained for a ﬁnite period of time before other constraints (e.g., hunger) make it necessary to resume foraging activity (lima & bednekoff 1999). natural selection should favour individuals that can reliably assess local current predation risks, as this would allow them to optimise the ratio between gains and losses of ﬁtness (lima & bednekoff 1999; golub & brown 2003). for ﬁsh, direct predator-induced cues, especially visual (karplus & algom 1981) and olfactory signals (chivers & smith 1998; wisenden 2000) are consi- dered to be most important. however, there is still limited knowledge concerning independent contribu- tions of both visual and chemical cues (mathis et al. 1993), as well as their interaction (bouwma & hazlett 2001) on foraging characteristics. moreover, in spite of the growing number of publications on the role of doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00140.x 111 mikheev et al. predator-induced chemical cues in ﬁsh foraging and other behaviours, their importance as a factor inﬂuen- cing foraging behaviour is still debatable. some studies have shown that ﬁsh signiﬁcantly reduce their intake rate in response to kairomones released by sympatric predators (jachner 1995, 1997; kats & dill 1998) and even naive ﬁsh could distinguish between different piscivores on the basis of chemical cues only (hirvonen et al. 2000). however, others have shown that juvenile ﬁsh do not respond to chemical stimuli from piscivores if they had no previous contacts either with the predators or with alarm substances from conspeciﬁcs (chivers & smith 1994; utne-palm 2001). foraging response to local predation risk is usually expressed as a reduction of total food intake, which could be caused either by avoidance of proﬁtable but dangerous microhabitats (cerri & fraser 1983; fraser & gilliam 1987; utne et al. 1997; utne-palm 2001) or by reducing time spent foraging (fraser & hunting- ford 1986; jachner 1995, 1997) and engaging in other activities, e.g., hiding. as a more subtle response, a shift in prey-size selectivity has been observed in the guppy, poecilia reticulata, which changed preference from large to small prey after visual contact with a predator (godin 1990). it is unknown if young-of-the- year (yoy) perch exhibit similar responses to various predator-induced cues. young-of-the-year eurasian perch, perca ﬂuviatilis, is a daylight forager with relatively high food demands (thorpe 1977; persson 1983). it is vulnerable to various predators, including ﬁsh and birds (goldspink 1990; winﬁeld 1990; eklo¨v 1992). it is a particulate feeder with pronounced prey-size selectivity that varies temporally and spatially (guma’a 1978; mills et al. 1986; bergman 1988; our unpublished data); however, the behavioural mechanisms of this variab- ility have received little attention. differences in the feeding response to different cues of predation risk could depend on intraspeciﬁc variability in risk taking (fraser & huntingford 1986; metcalfe 1986; wilson 1998; westerberg et al. 2004), or might also be affected by the type of predator-induced cues available to foraging ﬁsh (brown et al. 1997). our aim was to study the responses in feeding rate and prey-size selectivity of laboratory-reared, naive yoy perch subjected to inﬂuences of cues induced by northern pike, esox lucius. the perch originated from a lake where it naturally coexists with pike. specif- ically, we studied changes in total intake rate and prey- size selectivity of perch in relation to impacts of pike kairomones, of visual contact with pike and simulta- neous presentation of both cues. we expected that a combination of visual and olfactory cues might elicit stronger feeding responses than separate cues alone. we also tested the prediction that reduction in food 112 intake rate caused by pike-induced cues was primarily related to reduced consumption of larger prey. materials and methods predators and prey perch juveniles were obtained from egg strands collected from lake wallersee (austria). a mass culture was kept in ﬂow-through tanks at 20 ± 1 °c and a dark–light regime that imitated the seasonal changes of illumination. the ﬁsh were raised on a diet of living brine shrimp artemia salina nauplii, lake zooplankton and daphnia magna. fish used in the experiments had a mean standard length (sl) of 22.1 ± 1.77 mm (mean ± sd) and a mean dry weight (dw) of 39.6 ± 9.78 mg. a dense culture of d. mag- na was maintained in plastic basins on a mixture of green algae and yeast. two prey sizes were produced by sieving: large prey having a mean body length (±sd) of 2.81 ± 0.22 mm and a mean body width of 1.85 ± 0.15 mm and small prey having a mean body length of 1.35 ± 0.24 mm and a mean body width of 0.83 ± 0.17 mm. size distributions of the two classes did not overlap, and large and small prey were easy to discriminate visually. dw of d. magna was calcula- ted from the regression equation, dw ¼ 8.47l2.6 (j. wanzenbo¨ck, unpublished data, institute of limnology, austrian academy of sciences). thus, large prey had an average body weight of 124 lg; small prey weight was 25 lg. gape width (gw) of perch juveniles was calculated using the equation, gw ¼ )0.176 + 0.099 sl, where sl (kurmayer & wanzenbo¨ck 2.21 ± 0.18 mm (mean ± sd). equalled 1996) longer the relative size (the ratio of prey width to mouth gape of the predator) of large prey (0.84) was slightly higher than optimal (werner 1974; kislalioglu & gibson 1976). handling of a prey of this size takes 14 times than handling small prey (relative size ¼ 0.38). handling time (ht, s) was calcu- equation, ht ¼ 1 + lated 0.0229 exp(8.061 ps/ms), where ps/ms is the prey size/mouth size ratio (werner 1974). ht was 21 s per large prey and 1.5 s per small one. according to the experimental procedures and treatments experiments were carried out at the institute for limnology, mondsee, austria in 2001. they were run in glass aquaria of 30 · 20 · 20 cm ﬁlled with 10 l of ﬁltered lake water at 20 ± 1 °c. for each of the three treatments (where foraging yoy perch were exposed to either predator-induced chemical and visual cues or a combination of both), 60 ﬁsh were randomly chosen from the ﬂow-through holding tank and distributed in three instead of groups of three among 20 aquaria (10 test and 10 control aquaria) before experimentation. fish were tested in groups of individually because pilot observations demonstrated ﬁsh in groups calmed down and started feeding much earlier than isolated individuals. overhead lighting was provided by two 36-w ﬂuorescent tubes on a 16:8 h light:dark regime providing 400 lx at the water surface. aquaria were permanently aerated except the short periods of the feeding tests. a day before the test, ﬁsh were fed with d. magna ad libitum for an hour in the experi- mental aquaria. after that, the rest of prey were removed and ﬁsh were left without food in the same aquaria for 20 h prior to the treatment. consumption of large and small prey was estimated in 15-min trials with 100 large and 200 small daphnia per aquarium. the high concentration of prey mimicked feeding in a dense zooplankton patch (mikheev 1987). according to our pilot observations, consumption rate of hungry yoy perch was highest during the ﬁrst 15 min. to test the impact of predator- induced chemical cues, water from the ﬂow-through 40-l aquarium with a pike was allowed to drip through a plastic tube into test aquaria at a rate of 150–200 ml per 15-min period during the feeding test. the same amount of pure ﬁltered lake water was introduced in the same manner into the control aquaria. the pike of 20-cm length had been food deprived for 3 days. before that, it was fed with laboratory-reared yoy roach, rutilus rutilus. after 15-min feeding, test perch were removed with a hand net, anaesthetised with ms-222 and measured. the remaining d. magna were collected from each aquarium with a sieve of 0.2-mm mesh and counted under a dissecting microscope. the impact of visual predator-induced stimuli was tested using the same experimental procedure and another group of 60 yoy perch. to produce visual contact, a small (11- to 12-cm total length) pike, e. lucius, was kept isolated within a transparent plastic bag in the corner of the same test aquarium. for controls, the bags were ﬁlled with pure lake water. the last test in the sequence of treatments was a combination of visual and olfactory cues. the third group of 60 perch was treated simultaneously either with visual contact (pike in the plastic bag) and pike odour in the test aquaria or with the empty bag and ﬁltered water in the control. all experiments were run between 11:00 and 17:00 hours at a temperature of 20 °c. the whole sequence of experiments, together with the periods of acclimation and starvation between the tests, took 5 days. data analysis the number of consumed prey items was assessed as the difference between introduced and remaining effects of predator-induced cues d. magna after perch feeding. large and small d. magna were counted separately. in trials without ﬁsh, no losses of either large or small prey caused by manipulations and sieving were found. calculated numbers of large and small prey consumed in each test and control aquarium were transformed into the intake rate (dw of prey ingested per individual ﬁsh for 15 min). ivlev’s electivity index (ivlev 1961) was used to assess the preference for large prey. data were transformed [arcsine transformation for the ivlev’s electivity index, e; ln(x + 1) for food intake rate data] to meet the assumption of normality and homogeneity of variance required by anova tests. two-way anova was conducted to assess the effects of predation threat (predation and no predation) and type of cues (odour, visual contact and visual + odour) as factors. diffe- rences between treatments were assessed using tukey’s post hoc honestly signiﬁcant difference tests. analyses of intake rate were performed with large prey, small prey and with the two sizes of prey pooled. the results of anova and tukey’s tests in the three sets of analyses were similar (i.e., effects were identical on small daphnia, on large daphnia, and on total intake) and therefore only results of the analyses of total food intake are presented below. results factors was signiﬁcant food intake rate of yoy perch was signiﬁcantly reduced under the impact of predation threat (two-way anova: f1,54 ¼

effect of chemical cues on the perch intake rate was signiﬁcant only when both signals of the predator were present (tukey’s test: p ¼ 0.0001; fig. 1). when chemical cues were present alone, they produced no noticeable impact on the intake rate in comparison to the control (tukey’s test: p ¼ 0.9989). visual contact with the predator signiﬁcantly reduced perch feeding relative to the control (tukey’s test: p ¼ 0.0063) even when it was present alone, but its impact was much less pronounced compared with the combined effect of both predator cues (tukey’s test: p ¼ 0.0003; fig. 1). large prey assessed by ivlev’s electivity index, e, was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the threat of predation (two-way anova: f1,54 ¼ 5.57, p ¼ 0.0218). the type of predator-induced cues had selectivity also

diet compared with the control, was combined presence of visual and olfactory cues (p ¼ 0.0241; fig. 2). discussion our laboratory experiments with naive yoy perch clearly demonstrated that the presence of predator- induced chemical cues alone did not cause any signiﬁcant changes in foraging behaviour of hungry ﬁsh. neither total food intake nor proportion of large and small prey in the diet changed when perch in groups of three ﬁsh were exposed to northern pike kairomones during 15-min feeding bouts. although chemical predator-induced cues are known to elicit innate antipredator responses for a range of aquatic animals (kats & dill 1998; tollrian & harvell 1999), our naive ﬁsh showed no response when ﬁrst presented with a novel predator odour (chivers & smith 1994, 1998; brown et al. 1997; utne-palm 2001; but see hirvonen et al. 2000). however, naive ﬁsh that were exposed simultaneously to novel 114 1 + e , x e d n i y t i v i t c e e s l 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 odour

10). predator-induced cues and conspeciﬁc alarm cues, or physical presence of a predator, learned to associate risk with novel stimuli (e.g., magurran 1989; chivers & smith 1994; utne-palm 2001). in our experiments, laboratory-reared perch were not familiar with con- speciﬁc alarm cues either before or during tests. other chemical cues related to injured or ingested perch could not be available to experimental ﬁsh because the pike used as a source of predator odour had no food for 3 days before the experiment, and before that it was fed with yoy roach from laboratory mass culture. visual contact with a predator signiﬁcantly reduced consumption of both large and small prey by naive yoy perch. this ﬁnding is consistent with a large number of previous studies, which have demonstrated that vision may convey to ﬁsh accurate and reliable information about predator location and behaviour (e.g., dill & fraser 1984; metcalfe et al. 1987; utne-palm 2001; kelley & magurran 2003). there is some evidence that ﬁsh have an innate ability to respond to particular visual cues and are predisposed to recognise predatory ﬁsh (utne-palm 2001; kelley & magurran 2003). although chemical cues may be considered more important in predator detection when vision is restricted by high turbidity, low illumination or dense vegetation (brown et al. 1997; bro¨nmark & hansson 2000), it does not seem to be the case with our yoy perch. at the age they were used in our experiments, perch inhabit predominantly littoral and sublittoral zones of lake wallersee (upper austria) with usually transparent water; however, dense vegetation and low illumination during night-time could impair vision. the upper layer of water, which is mainly used for foraging, is rather turbulent because of wind-induced currents. as a result of the turbulent nature of the water, predator-released odours are dispersed in any direction and detectable directional gradients of a chemical signal are unlikely (moore et al. 1994; webster & weissburg 2001). determining the relia- bility of information is recognised as a primary challenge to foragers (curaco & gillespie 1986; wiskerke et al. 1993), and if information provided by the chemical cue is of low quality (no exact indication on the direction and distance to a predator), the best choice for a forager may be not to alter its foraging behaviour (brown 1988). the most pronounced changes in foraging caused by simultaneous introduction of visual and olfactory stimuli suggest that laboratory-reared perch can detect kairomones released by pike, but respond to them only if they are presented in combination with visual predator cues. in this case, the highest reduction in total food intake as well as the stronger shift of prey- size selection towards the smallest prey was observed. in ﬁsh, the combination of chemical and visual cues has yielded several outcomes compared with single cues. there are additive effects (e.g., brown et al. 1997), hierarchical fashion of interaction (e.g., hartman & abrahams 2000; smith & belk 2001) when ﬁsh ignore the cue in the modality that is least salient or reliable and a synergistic interaction between sensory modal- ities when the effect of the combination is greater or different from the sum of effects of the individual components (e.g., wisenden et al. 2004). the results of our experiments demonstrate the synergistic interaction between visual and olfactory predator cues modifying foraging of naive yoy perch. rather than inducing an immediate behavioural response, the detection of pike kairomones merely strengthens the feeding response of perch to visual predator input. predator odour thus acts as a modulatory stimulus (holldobler 1999) affecting the magnitude of responses to other inputs. however, the changes in perch foraging behaviour caused by the combined inﬂuence of olfactory and visual pike cues were not only quantitative, but a signiﬁcant change in prey-size selection was also observed expressed in the marked reduction of the proportion of large prey in the diet. the disproportional reduction in consumption of large prey, which is costly in terms of time spent for their ‘handling’ that included pursuing, capturing and processing (in our experiments, calculated ‘ht’ of large prey was 14 times higher than that of small prey), suggests that under increased safety demands, ﬁsh avoid the most risky activities confronting vigilance. because of limited attention and sensory overload (milinski 1990; clark & ducas 2003), foragers are most vulnerable while engaged in a difﬁcult behaviour- al task (godin & smith 1988; krause & godin 1996), which in our case is the pursuing, capturing and processing of large prey. prey-size selectivity is known effects of predator-induced cues to be inﬂuenced by ﬁsh satiation (hirvonen & ranta 1996). however, according to our observations with food-deprived yoy ﬁsh (mikheev & wanzenbo¨ck 1999 for roach; our unpublished data for perch), the in prey-size selection most pronounced changes occurred during 5–10 min after the beginning of feeding. after that, ingestion rate markedly decreased and selectivity stabilised. our estimates obtained for 15-min trials can be considered as representative averages. our results suggest that a shift in prey-size selection towards smaller prey observed in juvenile percids foraging under daylight conditions (mills et al. 1986; our unpublished data – respective: wanzenbo¨ck et al. 2006) can be related to the impact of predator-induced cues in a period of high predation risk, rather than merely to more favourable conditions for vision (mills et al. 1986). our ﬁndings are most applicable to the period of the ﬁrst summer during the transition of yoy perch from pelagial to littoral zones when naive ﬁsh encounter large piscivores like northern pike more often and the contact is closer. acknowledgements we are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their helpful
