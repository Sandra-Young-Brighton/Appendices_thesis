dace, leuciscus leuciscus; barbus petenyi; and burbot, lota lota) were signiﬁcantly over- represented in pool habitats. we hypothesized that pool specialists (i.e., chub and rare species) were responding primarily to the increased depth of these habitats. nevertheless, our data did not demonstrate the presence of separate pool and rifﬂe habitat guilds. in conclusion, we believe that our understanding of stream ﬁsh ecology will be greatly facilitated by use of a ‘patch-based approach’. ¤s1, z. botta-duka¤ t2, t. ero¤ g. d. grossman3 1hungarian danube research station of the hungarian academy of sciences, ja¤ vorka u. 14, h-2131 go« d, hungary, 2institute of ecology and botany of the hungarian academy of sciences, alkotma¤ ny u. 2^4, h-2163 va¤ cra¤ to¤ t, hungary, 3d.w. warnell school of forest resources, university of georgia, athens, ga 30602, usa key words: riffle;

kotliar & wiens 1990; levin 1992; thompson et al. 2001). streams have long been recognized as patchy habitats (hynes 1970), and several studies have shown that patchiness has substantial effects on 141 ero´ ´ s et al. the organization of aquatic communities (e.g., poff & ward 1990; schlosser 1993; townsend & hildrew 1994). nonetheless, organisms differ in their perceptual abilities which determine the level and extent of environmental patchiness they can detect (kotliar & wiens 1990; thompson et al. 2001). because species probably respond to envir- onmental patchiness in a unique manner, exam- ining assemblage organization and habitat use at multiple spatial scales should yield insights into how both species and assemblages respond differ- entially to environmental gradients (addicott et al. 1987; wiens 1989; kotliar & wiens 1990). studies of the responses of stream ﬁshes to habitat patchiness generally have been conducted at either the microhabitat (i.e., position of the ﬁsh; grossman & freeman 1987; grossman & de sostoa 1994; grossman et al. 1998) or macroha- bitat (rifﬂe-pool sequence; schlosser 1987; gel- wick 1990; capone & kushlan 1991; taylor 1997; martin-smith 1998) scale. investigations at the macrohabitat scale link individual-level microha- bitat studies with ﬁsh assemblage organization at the landscape scale. most studies of stream ﬁshes that relate patchi- ness to either habitat use or assemblage organiza- tion have been conducted in north america. in europe, there is scant information on the relation- ship between environmental patchiness and either ﬁsh assemblage structure (but see jones 1975) or habitat selection patterns within these assem- blages (grossman & de sostoa 1994; prenda et al. 1997). this is particularly true for young- of-the-year (yoy) ﬁshes (copp 1993; mann 1996; watkins et al. 1997; baras & nindaba 1999), although it is known that yoy abundance can have strong effects on stream ﬁsh assemblage structure (grossman et al. 1982). furthermore, these studies generally have been conducted dur- ing just one season (mainly summer); seasonal changes in habitat use by european stream ﬁshes have received little attention (ma¨ ky-peta¨ ys et al. 1997). consequently, studies detailing the res- ponses of european stream ﬁshes to environmen- tal and temporal patchiness at both the species and assemblage level (schlosser 1991, 1995) should signiﬁcantly improve our ability to manage and conserve these ﬁshes. our study examined several characteristics of a stream ﬁsh assemblage in a generally undisturbed, submontane hungarian stream. speciﬁcally, we addressed the following questions: (i) how do visually identiﬁed patches differ in their physical characteristics? (ii) is there a relationship between the physical characteristics of patches and ﬁsh assemblage structure? (iii) how do ﬁshes utilize habitat across macrohabitat patches? and (iv) do 142 the numerically dominant ﬁsh species display seasonal or size/age related differences in habitat use? materials and methods study sites our study site was the second order bernecei stream (4880009900n, 1885603900e) located in the bo¨ rzso¨ ny mountains (maximum height 938 m), hungary. the bernecei stream, located in the danube drainage, ﬂows over volcanic terrain and is 12 km long. stream width in the study section averaged 3 m. the bernecei stream mean- ders through an oak-hornbeam woodland (querco- carpinetum) with riparian vegetation dominated by alder, alnus glutinosa. the overstory provides exten- sive shading which leaves little light for stream primary production. hence, most secondary pro- duction in the bernecei stream probably is based on allochthonous sources. the bernecei stream has a moderately well-developed rifﬂe-pool morphology with gravel as the dominant substratum. the stream has an unaltered ﬂow regime, although a 1-km section ﬂows through a small village (bernecebar- a´ ti), just above its conﬂuence with the kemence stream. nonetheless, the bernecei probably is rea- sonably representative of unmodiﬁed submontane streams of the carpathian region in central europe. this conclusion is supported by the fact that the ﬁsh assemblage in the bernecei is composed entirely of native species. sampling regime we selected two study sections, both approxi- mately 100 m in length and about 2 km apart. these were chosen randomly from ﬁve sections of similar length, which represented the range of habitat types found in the bernecei. between august 1999 and june 2000 we measured abiotic and biotic parameters in these sites in: summer 1999 (12–19 august), autumn 1999 (25 october  12 november), early spring (30 march 11 april), and late spring (30 may 1 june). based on general physical characteristics (i.e., depth, velocity, and substratum), we identiﬁed 13 macro- habitat patches in the two study sections (six and seven, respectively). each patch had relatively homogeneous within-patch physical characteris- tics, but also was separated from adjacent patches by geomorphological breaks that altered ﬂow, depth, and substratum patterns. patches were a minimum of 5 m in length with a minimum mean depth of 5 cm. our protocols for patch identi- ﬁcation and measurement of habitat structure followed gorman & karr (1978), schlosser (1982), and bart (1989). first, we placed transect markers at 2-m intervals perpendicular to the main axis of stream ﬂow. beginning 10–30 cm from the right bank of the stream, and continuing at 1-m intervals across the stream, we measured: water depth, and visually estimated substratum composition, percent coverage by roots and leav- es, and number of branches in a 50 cm 50 cm quadrat. we also estimated the percent coverage of debris, although this was negligible in the bernecei. we classiﬁed substratum particles based on their maximum dimensions, using a modiﬁed version of the method of grossman et al. (1998): rock, >30 cm; stone, <30 and 6 cm; gravel, <6 and 0.2 cm; sand, >0.2 mm; silty sand, sand plus material that was readily suspendable in the water column. a special substratum category for hard clay bottoms was also established (i.e., claystone). we measured maximum water depth to the nearest centimeter using a straight edge, and water velocity by timing a neutrally buoyant object along 5 m of reach (gelwick 1990). habitat and ﬁsh sampling were conducted on the same day. because our study only covered one year, we also compared rainfall (i.e., ﬂow conditions) dur- ing the sampling period with those obtained from a 20-year series of daily rainfall values from a rain gauge in danube-ipoly national park (a´ . bezeczky, personal communication). this gauge is located approximately 4 km from our study sites. rainfall data in this region should be strongly correlated with ﬂow levels in streams (ero´ ´ s & bezeczky, personal observation). we captured ﬁshes in macrohabitat patches by ﬁrst blocking the upper and lower end of each macrohabitat patch with seines (2 mm bar mesh), anchored with chain, and then used a two-person backpack electroﬁshing (350 v dc) team to col- lect specimens. following schlosser (1982) and bart (1989), we derived abundance estimates by making three electroﬁshing passes of equal effort in each macrohabitat patch, with depletion occur- ring on each subsequent pass. a preliminary study indicated that three passes were sufﬁcient to yield accurate population estimates for these species (i.e., comparisons between estimates from three and ﬁve passes of electroﬁshing yielded highly correlated estimates (r > 0.90; ero´ ´ s 2001). we measured the standard length of ﬁshes after each pass. finally, ﬁshes were held in buckets of water until sampling was completed and then returned to the patch in which they were caught. we used length frequency data to identify age classes (0þ yoy, 1þ, and 2þ) for each species. only two species, the stone loach and the minnow, assemblage structure of fishes in a european stream displayed three age classes, although older min- nows (2þ) were so rare that it was impractical to treat them as a separate age class. for simplicity and to compensate for low sampling efﬁciency of ﬁsh less than 3 months of age, we created two classes for ﬁsh habitat use analyses: juveniles (yoy between 3 and 11 months of age) and adults (1þ and older). given these sampling criteria, we only examined habitat use of juvenile stone loach and minnows during autumn 1999 and early and late spring 2000 when they were close to entering the adult age class. populations of the remaining species (chub and rare species) were dominated by adults (2þ), and hence, habitat use analyses involve just this life history class. although most sampling occurred under stable ﬂows, to ensure coverage of all seasonal condi- tions, we had to make early spring 2000 collection during a period of high discharge, typical of carpathian streams. during this period, we lim- ited sampling to days when both visibility and velocity permitted efﬁcient sampling. we do not believe that this seriously biased our results; none- theless, density data for early spring 2000 may be less accurate than data for other seasonal samples. consequently, early spring data only were used for assemblage structure comparisons among macrohabitats (i.e., they were deleted from ﬁsh habitat use density analyses). statistical analysis we used principal component analysis (pca) for habitat structure comparisons among macroha- bitat patches. we normalized data using either natural log (velocity, depth, and amount of wood) or square-root arcsine (substratum composition, root, and leaf coverage) transformations (gross- man & freeman 1987). to obtain robust and readily interpretable results, all samples were combined (four sampling times 13 macrohabi- tat patches¼ 52 data points), and run in a single analysis. data for within-patch samples were pooled to obtain an average for that patch. we evaluated among patches differences in habitat structure along principal components using one- way analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey’s test for pairwise comparisons (ma¨ ky- peta¨ ys et al. 1997; grossman et al. 1998; zar 1999). we plotted tukey’s test results as lsd ranges (see fig. 2). due to its high stability and robustness we used correspondence analysis (ca) to indirectly ordi- nate ﬁsh assemblages on macrohabitat patches (ter braak 1985; wartenberg et al. 1987; oksanen 1988; jackson 1993; podani 2000). relative abun- dance (i.e., percentage) data were used in the ca. 143 ero´ ´ s et al. as with the pca, ﬁsh data were combined and ordinated in one analysis, then averaged for each patch. we used a ca biplot for presentation of results, to display both object scores and variable scores in one graph. we used 0.5 as the scale parameter value (a) ca (ter braak 1985). we test- ed for correlations between physical characteris- tics of macrohabitat patches and ﬁsh assemblage structure, using spearman’s rank correlation test (rs). this test is most appropriate for correlation analyses when sample sizes are less than 30 (zar 1999). we also used spearman’s rank correlation test to detect signiﬁcant correlations between the phy- sical characteristics of macrohabitat patches (pc scores) and: (i) seasonal density data for the entire ﬁsh assemblage, (ii) seasonal density values for the dominant species, and (iii) on pooled density data of rare species. to normalize density data we used a square root (xþ 0.5) transformation. results physical structure of macrohabitat patches rainfall data demonstrated that our study encompassed both high- and low-water periods, and hence, our results should have some general- ity for the bernecei stream (fig. 1). the pca produced four signiﬁcant components (81.5% variance explained); however, only the ﬁrst two components identiﬁed clear, ecologically relevant habitat continua. these two components explain- ed a majority of variance in the data set (57%). component 1 accounted for 41% of the var- iance in the data set and described a gradient between rifﬂe (i.e., erosional) and pool (i.e., (fig. 2). depositional) macrohabitat patches patches with strong positive loadings were: deep with low average velocity, with a substratum dominated by silty sand and roots (little rock or stone). conversely, patches with strong nega- tive loadings were: shallow with high average velocity and a substratum dominated by rock and stone (little silty sand or roots). based on the average characteristics of patches (within- patch data pooled over seasons), some rifﬂe patches were statistically distinguishable, whereas pool patches generally formed a single indistin- guishable clump (fig. 2a). the largest pool was the sole exception to this pattern, and the loading of this pool on component 1 differed signiﬁcantly from all other pools. component 2 (16.7%) also elucidated substra- tum characteristics of patches, especially sand (positive loadings), number of branches, logs (wood), and leaf coverage (negative loadings). macrohabitat patches did not differ signiﬁcantly on axis two (fig. 2a); however, this component did separate autumn samples from those collected during other seasons (fig. 2b). assemblage structure in macrohabitat patches of the eight ﬁsh species collected in the bernecei stream, stone loach, barbatula barbatula (l.); minnow, phoxinus phoxinus (l.); and chub, leu- ciscus cephalus (l.) were most abundant, compris- ing 54, 29, and 13% of total ﬁsh abundance, respectively. the remaining species (i.e., gudgeon, gobio gobio (l.); dace, leuciscus leuciscus (l.); barbus petenyi (heckel, 1852); and burbot, lota lota (l.)) represented only 4% of the total ﬁshes collected. we captured one schneider, alburnoides bipunctatus (bloch, 1782) in late spring 2000, which was omitted from analyses. mean (sd) 144 fig. 1. mean monthly rainfall data (se) collected at bernecebara´ ti approximately 4 km from our study sites. we present data for the period 1974–94, 2001 and january–march 2002. monthly means for 1991 and 2000 are graphed separately and the arrows denote sampling periods. assemblage structure of fishes in a european stream r e b m u n h c t a p 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 i s e c e p s . l s e p m a s l a n o s a e s r u o f l l a r e v o h c t a p h c a e r o f d s  ) 2 m / r e b m u n ( y t i s n e d h s i f n a e m l 1. e b a t fig. 2. the principal component ordination (pca) of macro- habitat patches based on their physical characteristics. we present mean pc scores with anova least significant difference (lsd) ranges to test for significant differences among: (a) patches pooled over seasons and (b) seasons pooled over patches. abbreviations in panel (b) are as follows: su, summer 1999;

p < 0.001). none of the other correlations were signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 level, with the exception of the relationship between pca2 and ca3 axes. although signiﬁcant, this correlation was very weak (rs¼ 0.322; p < 0.01), and its ecological interpretation problematical. fish assemblage structure in patches showed some seasonal varia- . . . . . . 2 6 0  4 9 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 3 0 0  2 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 9 1 0  1 2 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 1 0  1 2 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 4 0 0  3 0 0 9 0 0  4 2 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 3 1 0  5 2 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 1 0  0 4 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 2 1 0  3 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 3 1 0  1 3 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 3 0  2 6 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 5 0 0  4 0 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 4 0  7 5 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 7 3 0  9 3 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 1.  9 8 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 5 2 0  2 2 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 4 0  8 5 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 5 0 0  4 0 0 8 0 0  6 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 1 5 0  5 6 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 8 0  5 9 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 6 0 0  9 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 6 3 0  6 3 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 1 0  4 2 0 3 0 0  4 0 0 6 0 0  8 0 0 1 1 0  1 4 0 2 0 0  2 0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 6 3 0  4 3 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 5 0  1 6 0 1 5 0  1 0 0 3 0 0  0 0 0 1 1 0  8 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 6 1 0  0 2 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 4 0  1 7 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 5 0 0  4 0 0 2 1 0  6 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 1 5 0  0 8 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1 0  1 3 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 3 0 0  4 0 0 6 0 0  2 1 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 2 0 0  1 0 0 8 1 0  9 2 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 2 0  1 5 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 3 1 0  4 1 0 1 1 0  5 2 0 3 0 0  2 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 6 4 0  7 6 0 . . . . . . . . ula t a b r a b ula t a b r a b s u xin o h p s u xin o h p s u c cis u le l. a t lo a t o l s alu h p e c s u c cis u e l yi n te e p s u b r a b bio o g bio o g 145 ero´ ´ s et al. fig. 3. correspondence analysis (ca) biplot of fish assemblage structure data in macrohabitat patches. we graphed mean ca scores of patches (solid circles) and fish species (open circles). species abbreviations: bb, stone loach;

p < 0.01). intraspecific habitat use species displayed both similarities and differences in habitat use within the bernecei stream. for stone loach, the sole signiﬁcant habitat correla- tions involved both juvenile and adult densities 146 (juveniles: rs¼ 0.928; p < 0.001; adults: rs¼  0.560; p < 0.05), which were negatively corre- lated with pc1 in late spring 2000 (fig. 5a,b). consequently, stone loach were more abundant in rifﬂe patches during this season. the abun- dance of juvenile minnows was positively corre- lated with pc1 (rs¼ 0.555; p < 0.05) in autumn, suggesting that minnows were more abundant in pool-like patches (fig. 5c). neither abundance of juvenile nor adult minnows were signiﬁcantly correlated with pc1 in other seasons (fig. 5c,d). by contrast, adult chub abundance was positively correlated with pool-like patches (i.e., positive pc1 scores) in every season (fig. 5e): summer 1999 (rs¼ 0.833; p < 0.001), autumn 1999 (rs¼ late spring 2000 (rs¼ 0.712; 0.591; p < 0.05), p < 0.01). because chub are predators, we com- pared their density to the density of potential prey species (i.e., juvenile stone loach and minnow, fig. 6), and found an inverse correlation between stone loach density and chub density (rs¼  0.651; p < 0.001). minnows, however, did not display this relationship (p > 0.05). because of their rarity, density–habitat correlations were not made for gudgeon, dace, b. petenyi, and bur- bot. nonetheless, the distribution of these species along pc1 (fig. 5f) indicated that they preferred deeper patches and avoided shallow, rifﬂe-like patches. discussion our study is one of the ﬁrst for european streams that utilized a ‘patch-based’ approach to examine both assemblage structure and habitat use by stream ﬁshes. fish assemblage characteristics in the bernecei stream remained relatively stable, both within and among patches, despite substan- tial variation in ﬂows. we also found that ﬁsh fig. 4. seasonal changes in fish assem- blage structure (ca1 score) within macro- habitat patches versus the physical characteristics of patches (pc1 scores). seasonal data belonging to the same patch are connected with lines:^ summer 1999; &, autumn 1999; ~, early spring 2000; , late spring 2000. if seasonal chan- ges in assemblage structure are stronger than those associated with the physical characteristics of patches, points should cluster by season rather than by patch. stone loach dominated patches with ne- gative values on the vertical axis (ca1), minnows dominated patches with inter- mediate values, and chub and rare species dominated patches with strong positive values. see fig. 3 for further details. assemblage structure of fishes in a european stream fig. 5. seasonal density values (square root transformed) for fish species plotted against the physical characteristics of macrohabitat patches (i.e., riffle to pool gradient identified by pc1). data are as follows: (a) juvenile stone loach, (b) adult stone loach, (c) juvenile minnow, (d) adult minnow, (e) adult chub, (f) rare species (gg: gudgeon, lle: dace, bp: barbus pe- tenyi, llo: burbot). data sets presented as solid points represent significant correla- tions (spearman rank correlation test) between density and physical characteris- tics of patches. see results for correla- tions and p-values. the three seasons. the sole difference (i.e., late spring 2000) was attributable to recruitment of juvenile stone loach in rifﬂe patches. habitat use analyses indicated that two of the three dominant species (stone loach and minnow) had very gen- eral patterns of habitat use, whereas chub and rare species were specialized pool residents. these results conﬁrm the patterns observed in assem- blage structure analyses. although there are a number of published studies on the ecology of ﬁsh assemblages in small streams, there is substantial disagreement over the properties manifested by these assemblages (see bart 1989 and martin-smith 1998). some researchers argue that pools and rifﬂes have dis- tinct faunas (i.e., that habitat guilds are present, gorman & karr 1978; herbold 1984; martin- smith 1998), whereas other investigators suggest that most temperate stream ﬁshes display rela- tively generalized macrohabitat use patterns (i.e., habitat guilds are uncommon) (grossman et al. 1985; bart 1989). our results mirror those of prenda et al. (1997) who examined a similar assemblage of 12 species in two small chalk streams in england. prenda et al. (1997) did not observe separate rifﬂe and pool habitat guilds and also found that half the species in their assemblage 147 fig. 6. juvenile fish density (bb: stone loach, pp: minnow) plotted against chub (lc) density. see fig. 5 for further details. assemblage structure exhibited relatively contin- uous change over the major habitat gradient (rifﬂe-pool continuum) (fig. 3). both increased chub abundance and the occurrence of rare spe- cies (gudgeon, dace, b. petenyi, burbot) in pool- like patches were the dominant factors producing shifts in ﬁsh assemblage structure. nonetheless, there were no detectable differences in overall ﬁsh density between rifﬂe and pool macrohabitat patches in two (summer and autumn 1999) of ero´ ´ s et al. were habitat generalists. both our ﬁndings and those of prenda et al. (1997) suggest that ﬁsh assemblages occupying pool-rifﬂe macrohabitat gradients in small european streams represent a continuum. these assemblages contain a small number of habitat specialists that respond to environmental gradients and a set of habitat generalists that do not. our results also demon- strate that the habitat responses of the most abundant species (i.e., generalists) strongly inﬂu- ence assemblage structure at the macrohabitat patch scale. members of the bernecei ﬁsh assemblage do vary in habitat use among streams, however. for example, both prenda et al. (1997) and mack- enzie & greenberg (1998) found stone loach in pools, whereas jones (1975) observed them in rifﬂes. although these results are contradictory, several factors may inﬂuence habitat use by stone loach, including prey availability (welton et al. 1991), presence of refuges from predatory ﬁshes (mackenzie & greenberg 1998), and depth and water velocity (zweimu¨ ller 1995). adult stone loach primarily are nocturnally active and spend daylight hours under shelter (smyly 1955; welton et al. 1983). given our daylight sampling regime, it is possible that the high availability of shelter in both pool (dense roots) and rifﬂe (stones and rocks) patches led to our conclusion that stone loach were habitat generalists. in contrast to stone loach, habitat use by minnows in the bernecei was very similar to patterns displayed by minnows in english chalk streams (prenda et al. 1997). juvenile stone loach, unlike adults, are active ´ s 1997), throughout the day (zweimu¨ ller 1995; ero´ and the abundance of this life history class was inversely correlated with chub abundance. recent works (schlosser 1987, 1988; harvey & stewart 1991) demonstrate that predation can have a major impact on habitat use patterns of juvenile ﬁshes in headwater streams, including stone loach (mackenzie & greenberg 1998). chub can prey upon juvenile ﬁshes (grossman et al. 1987; wat- kins et al. 1997), and this species may have inﬂu- enced habitat use by juvenile stone loach in the bernecei stream. in contrast, chub did not appear to affect habitat use by juvenile minnows. none- theless, it is also possible that the inverse correla- tion between chub and juvenile stone loach abundances represent innate differences in habitat preferences of the two species. the rare species in our system (chub, gudgeon, dace, barbus petenyi, and burbot) all were found in pool-like macrohabitat patches. because these species generally maintain dense populations in the lower sections (third to sixth order) of hun- garian streams (harka 1997), we hypothesize that 148 the limited availability of deep macrohabitats affected their distribution in the bernecei stream. this would account for their more specialized habitat use patterns in this system. several studies demonstrate that european streams generally have lower ﬁsh species richness than north american streams of similar size (e.g., schlosser 1987; bart 1989; gelwick 1990; penczak & mann 1990; zalewski et al. 1990; lusk 1993; przybylski 1993). although the bernecei stream feeds into a tributary of the danube, the river with the highest ﬁsh diversity in central europe, spe- cies richness in the bernecei was less than 10. there may be a lack of adequate reproductive habitat for most species in this stream because we only observed spawning of stone loach and min- now (between early and late spring samples, ero"s, personal observation). in addition, these were the only species which showed strong recruitment of juveniles. juveniles of chub and rare species (gud- geon, dace, barbus petenyi, and burbot) were uncommon, which suggests that these individuals immigrated from lower reaches (e.g., kemence stream) or were resident but unable to spawn. most of the rare species in this assemblage, how- ever, are more abundant in third to ﬁfth-order streams (blachuta & witkowski 1990). apart from signiﬁcantly higher abundances of juvenile stone loach in rifﬂe habitats in late spring 2000, we did not observe strong seasonal differ- ences in: (i) assemblage structure, (ii) ﬁsh density, or (iii) habitat use of ﬁshes. in fact, assemblage structure within macrohabitat patches varied little over the course of our study, despite the presence of extremely high ﬂows in june and july 1999 and extremely low ﬂows in may and june 2000. this underscores the highly adaptable nature of these species, especially stone loach and minnow. stone loach and minnows may ﬁnd refuge under or behind large substratum particles in rifﬂes during ﬂoods (hildrew 1998) or move into the hyporheic zone (stone loach only, jurajda & rulı´ k 2001). it is possible that undercut banks and dense root clusters in pool-like patches can provide refuge for larger species (e.g., chub), whereas such habi- tats are lacking in rifﬂe-like patches. additive patterns of ﬁsh species richness along a downstream continuum are often associated with increased pool development (sheldon 1968; schlosser 1982, 1987; taylor 1997). our observa- tions suggest that the availability of pool macro- habitats may have affected the use of upstream reaches by chub and rare species in the bernecei stream. the colonization of patchy habitats in upstream reaches may best be examined by patch- based theories such as island biogeography or metapopulation dynamics (schlosser 1995). such approaches are underutilized in stream ﬁsh ecol- ogy, although several investigators have used patch-based approaches to the study of habitat use and population regulation in individual stream ﬁshes (petty & grossman 1996; petty 1998; thompson et al. 2001). we believe there is a need for more intensive testing and use of patch-based approaches in stream systems, because these approaches have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase our understanding and abil- ity to conserve stream faunas. resumen 1. examinamos patrones de composicio´ n de ensamblaje de peces y uso de habitat a nivel de macrohabitat-mosaico en las cuatro estaciones del an˜ o en un rı´ o submontano de segundo orden de la cuenca del danubio (hungrı´ a). los datos de lluvia indicaron que nuestro estudio incluyo´ periodos de niveles altos y bajos de agua y por ello, nuestros resultados podrian ser aplicables a una mayor escala temporal. 2. analisis de componentes principales (pca) para los datos de habitat ﬁsico de 13 mosaicos indico´ un continuo de corriente-pozas. un analisis de correspondencia (ca) para los datos de estructura de ensamblaje de peces de estos mosaicos identiﬁco´ un continuo de composicio´ n del ensam- blaje que estuvo positivamente correlacionado con el con- tinuo del habitat. 3. la fauna de corrientes estuvo dominada por barbatula barbatula mientras que leuciscus cephalus fue la especie mas abundante en pozas. detectamos poca estacionalidad tanto en la estructura del ensamblaje de peces como en el uso de habitat. la densidad de peces no diﬁrio´ signiﬁcativamente entre mosaicos en dos (verano y oton˜ o del an˜ o 1999) de los tres muestreos estacionales aunque los mosaicos de corriente mostraron abundancias de peces signiﬁcativamente mayores al ﬁnal de la primavera del an˜ o 2000. esta diferencia fue fundamentalmente debida a una mayor abundancia de juve- nile de b. barbatula en corrientes. b. barbatula y phoxinus phoxinus mostraron patrones de uso de habitat generalizados mientras que l. cephalus y las especies menos comunes como gobio gobio, l. leuciscus, barbus petenyi y lota lota, estu- vieron sobre-representados en habitats de pozas. planteamos que los especialistas en pozas (l. cephalus y las especies menos comunes) respondieron fundamentalmente a mayores profundidades de los habitats. sin embargo, nuestros datos no demuestraron la presencia de guilds de pozas y corrientes separados. 4. como conclusio´ n, creemos que comprender la ecologı´ a de los peces de rı´ o se verı´ a facilitada utilizando nuestra apro- ximacio´ n macrohabitat-mosaico. acknowledgements we are especially grateful to the following individuals for their material and moral support during completion of
