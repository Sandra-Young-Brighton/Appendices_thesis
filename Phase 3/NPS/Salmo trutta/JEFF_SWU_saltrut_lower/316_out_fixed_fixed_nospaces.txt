(2004) reported ﬁshery-induced evolution toward an earlier age or smaller size at maturation. conover & munch (2002) illustrated experimentally that artiﬁcial size-dependent selection changes the body size of ﬁsh within a few generations. thus, evolutionary change in ﬁsh body size may be no longer negligible when considering ﬁsh body-size dynamics. in the case of evolution toward a smaller body size, ﬁshery pressure is frequently found to be the main cause, because ﬁshery managers tend to target larger ﬁsh (law 2000; heino & godø 2002). large body size achieves many advantages, e.g., superiority in fora- ging and reproduction. therefore, trade-off between the merits of large body size and the low growth rate favoured by ﬁshery pressure is signiﬁcant (ga˚rdmark et al. 2003). the in the case of evolution toward a larger body size, the main cause appears to be natural piscivores. piscivores can more efﬁciently consume smaller than larger prey ﬁsh (christensen 1996; cowan et al. 1996; olsen 1996; lundvall et al. 1999; kristiansen et al. 2000) because of the gape limitation of piscivores and good avoidance ability of large prey ﬁsh. 2000). furthermore, however, evolution toward a larger body size is still the subject of extensive debate; in particular, the cost of a high growth rate remains elusive (see review by blanckenhorn interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes are very intricate (thompson 1998; law 2000), which also makes the problem more troublesome. therefore, when prey ﬁsh body size is observed to increase with increases in predation pressure, to determine whether the main causal factor is reduced intraspeciﬁc competition or size evolution. as blanc- kenhorn (2000) argued, empirical data and theoretical work are required to resolve this problem. it is difﬁcult in this study, we ﬁrst report the long-term body-size dynamics of the annual goby gymnogobius isaza in lake biwa, japan (fig. 1). the population of the largemouth bass, micropterus salmoides, in this lake has continued to grow since its introduction in 1974 (nakanishi & sikino 1996; fig. 2a), and native ﬁsh communities have subsequently suffered dramatic declines and changes (yuma et al. 1998; nakai 1999). one of the most affected species is the endemic goby (fig. 2b). the goby population decreased remarkably in the 1990s, during which the largemouth bass population increased explosively (see below). furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to consider a long-term change in body size of semelparous ﬁsh from an evolutionary viewpoint. here, we assumed that the change in body size would larger body size with higher predation rate onoe 136 e lake biwa 35 n n 45 40 35 japan 130 135 140 145 e fig. 1. location of lake biwa and sampling site.

the minimum standard body length (45 mm) in 1995, when mean body size was maximised, was larger than the maximum (41 mm) in 1975, when mean body size was minimised. therefore, the change in body size cannot be explained by the simple reason that the introduced piscivore shifted the average prey body size by remov- ing the smaller prey, i.e., ‘apparent growth’. the goby body size was negatively correlated with the cpue (standard body length: r ¼ 0.690, n ¼ 26, n ¼ 26, p < 0.001; wet weight: p < 0.001). this suggests that the goby experienced intense density-dependent effects from 1975 to 2002. this result is consistent with that of nagoshi (1981), who reported the body-size dynamics of the goby in the 1950s to 1970s. r ¼ 0.680, the cpue of the goby was not signiﬁcantly correlated with the ﬁshery catch of largemouth bass (r ¼ 0.266, n ¼ 16, p ¼ 0.319). however, there are no available data for the largemouth bass abundance between its introduction in 1974 and 1986; the relationship may be signiﬁcant if the largemouth bass abundance was low during this period. considering that the increase in goby body size was extremely large and that the goby is an annual ﬁsh, and thus has a potentially high evolutionary rate, we cannot exclude the possibility of rapid evolution. thus, we developed a mathematical model to consider such a body-size increase from an evolutionary viewpoint. mathematical model first, we developed a consumer–resource model that included the size dynamics of the consumer for the process without evolution to analyse cohort size, growth of individual consumers and resource dynam- ics within the consumer life span. here, the consumer is the prey ﬁsh. in the model, we did not consider the piscivore density explicitly, because the largemouth bass is a generalist and thus is not greatly affected by the condition of one prey species. the model is: drðtþ rðtþ   arðtþcðtþw ðtþx dt dw ðtþ dt dcðtþ dt  ¼ r 1   rðtþ ¼ barðtþw ðtþx   cw ðtþy ¼  zcðtþ ð1bþ ð1aþ ð1cþ  k where r(t), w(t) and c(t) represent the amount of resources, the body size and the surviving population of the prey ﬁsh, respectively, at time t within the life span of the prey ﬁsh. body size was measured as the mass of individual prey ﬁsh. the resource grows logistically and is consumed by the prey ﬁsh following a linear functional response for simplicity (eq. 1a). the resource consumption rate of the prey ﬁsh is proportional to the amount of resources, the prey ﬁsh cohort size and the xth power of the body size of the prey ﬁsh, where a represents the coefﬁcient of consumption. for individual growth (eq. 1b), we applied the growth expression of von bertalanffy (1938), which is often used in ﬁshery studies (e.g., charnov et al. 1993). the ﬁrst and second terms of the right-hand side represent assimilation and metabolism, respectively. because ar[t]w[t]x is the resource con- sumption rate per individual prey ﬁsh, b is the gross assimilation rate. metabolism is proportional to the yth power of body size. we ﬁrst assumed a constant mortality rate z in eq. (1c). in this case, survivorship follows a type-ii curve, which is frequently observed in ﬁsh populations (deevey 1947). we also modelled size-dependent predation avoid- ance as the evolutionary force that increases the prey ﬁsh body size such that larger individuals have lower larger body size with higher predation rate predation mortality. as an evolutionary trade-off, we considered that the cost of rapid growth is an increase in natural mortality other than predation (arendt 1997; blanckenhorn 2000), assuming that a larger body size is attained by a higher assimilation rate b. we then divided mortality m into two terms: predation and natural mortality other than predation, ð2þ z ¼ pf½w ðtþ þ m½b where predation mortality is the product of predation pressure p and a function f[w] that expresses size- dependent predation avoidance; and natural mortality m[b] is a function of the assimilation rate b. the trade- off is that larger individuals with higher assimilation rate can avoid piscivory more efﬁciently, but natural mortality increases, i.e., f ¢[w] < 0 and m¢[b] > 0. the size-dependent predation rate in ﬁsh is usually expressed in terms of the relative body length of prey ﬁsh to the body length of piscivores (paradis et al. 1996; see also turesson et al. 2006). for example, log p ¼ a þ b1 log q þ b2ðlog qþ2 þ  ð3þ where p is the predation rate and q is the relative body length. using only the ﬁrst and second terms and assuming a constant predator body size for simplicity, the size-dependent predation rate is expressed as f½w ðtþ ¼ gw ðtþh ð4þ where g > 0 and h < 0 because f¢[w] < 0. we assume that the natural mortality term is a function similar to that in eq. (4): m½b ¼ kbl where k > 0 and l > 0 because m¢[b] > 0. ð5þ in this study, b is the most important parameter, considering that the ecological process without evolu- tion (when the assimilation rate is constant) and the evolutionary process (when the assimilation rate evolves) have different effects on changes in prey body size. we deﬁne the former effect as the ‘ecolog- ical effect’, which is caused by release from intraspe- ciﬁc competition. in the evolutionary process, prey body size changes with both release from intraspeciﬁc competition and the evolutionary response of the assimilation rate. we deﬁned the difference between the two effects as the ‘evolutionary effect’, which is generated only by the evolution of the assimilation rate. we analysed the evolutionary process by establish- ing two types of prey ﬁsh strains with differential assimilation rates (i ¼ 1 and 2). the dynamics of these two types of prey ﬁsh are represented as drðtþ dt  ¼ r 1   rðtþ rðtþ   arðtþ x  k i¼1;2 ciðtþwiðtþx ð6aþ 365 nakazawa et al. dwiðtþ dt dciðtþ dt ¼ biarðtþwiðtþx   cwiðtþy ¼  fpf½wiðtþ þ m½bigciðtþ ð6bþ ð6cþ where i refers to the two competing phenotypes. later, we will treat one as resident and the other as a mutant. t denotes generation time. here, we assume semelparity for the goby; thus, t is also the time of reproduction, after which all adults die. alternation of generations is expressed as rjþ1ð0þ ¼ rjðtþ wi;jþ1ð0þ ¼ w ci;jþ1ð0þ ¼ v ci;jðtþwi;jðtþ ð7aþ ð7bþ ð7cþ w we simulated eqs where j is the generation number or year number if prey ﬁsh reproduce annually. equation (7a) represents the continuous connection of resource dynamics over prey generations. reproductive investment by a parent vwi,j(t)/w is proportional to its body size and is allocated evenly to individuals of the next generation with an initial body size of w for egg size. therefore, parameter v in eq. (7c) is the product of reproductive investment and the hatching probability. we assumed asexual reproduction for simplicity; thus, hybridisation between the two types was not considered. this is an expedient assumption for the analysis of evolutionary dynamics. (6a–c) and (7a–c) to examine whether the mutant (i ¼ 2) spreads or disappears after invading the resident population (i ¼ 1). for each simulation, we set the predation pressure to a value between 1 and 100 and the resident and mutant assimilation rates (b1, b2) to a pair of values between 0.0 and 1.0, with a minimum difference of 0.01. the the resident c1(0) was the initial cohort size of equilibrium value of the system without the mutant. under this equilibrium state, we obtained cyclic within-generation prey ﬁsh population dynamics, which is the stable equilibrium state for between- generation dynamics. we set the initial frequency of mutant individuals at 0.001. the subsequent mutant frequency in this model is expressed as vc2ðtþw2ðtþ=w ½vc1ðtþw1ðtþ=w þ ½vc2ðtþw2ðtþ=w ¼ c1ðtþw1ðtþ þ c2ðtþw2ðtþ c2ðtþw2ðtþ ð8þ in several trials using the parameter set (b1, b2), we observed that once the mutant invades, its frequency decreases to 0.0 or increases to 1.0 progressively, without oscillation;

therefore, we chose values by trial and error so that the prey ﬁsh would have moderate mortality rates (f[w] and m[b]) and numerical simulations would run well within a reasonable range of predation pressure, p (0 < p < 100). we examined the parameter sensitiv- ities by changing some parameter values after analysis using the default parameters. finally, we provide a theoretical framework to evaluate the relative effects of ecological and evolu- tionary processes over the long term. however, we did not assume evolutionary speed, which is determined by intraspeciﬁc variation, selection differential and heritability. therefore, the model can be used for between-population comparisons or time-series analy- ses accompanying rapid evolution. in either case, it must be assumed that population dynamics are at equilibrium, and in the evolutionary process, the prey ﬁsh population has already adapted to the predation pressure. in the purely ecological process, the assim- ilation rate does not change, but body size increases with predation pressure because the resource con- sumption rate per individual, ar[t]w[t]x, increases due to the reduced population size. in the evolutionary process, both the resource availability per individual and the assimilation rate b increase with predation pressure. we calculate the equilibrium body size, population size and population biomass (i.e., body size · population size) at various predation pressures in the absence or presence of assimilation rate evolution using the default parameter set. results to evaluate the evolutionary dynamics, we drew pairwise invasibility plots (pips; geritz et al. 1998), where the horizontal and vertical axes represent values of the assimilation rate b for the resident and mutant, respectively. pips illustrate whether the mutant can invade the resident population (fig. 4). we always obtained similar patterns of pips for different values of predation pressure p. the assimil- ation rates (b*) at the nodes of the patterns were convergent stable because any mutant strategy between a resident strategy and b* could invade (eshel 1983), and they were evolutionarily stable because no mutant strategy could invade (maynard-smith & price 1973). the optimal assimilation rate b* varied with predation pressure and the values of other parameters. the resident was unviable at extreme values of b, which were indicated as grey areas in the pips. we called the system ‘unviable’ when the population went to extinction at initial equilibrium. populations with an extreme assimilation rate were unviable for the following reasons. when the assimilation rate was extremely low (<bmin), size-dependent predation mor- tality was very high and reproductive investment was reduced because of the small body size at reproduc- tion. by contrast, when the assimilation rate was extremely high (>bmax), natural mortality increased markedly because the assimilation rate was too high. figure 5 illustrates the relationship between the optimal assimilation rate b* and the predation pressure p, where b* increases gradually with p. the borders between the white and grey areas are bmax and bmin. with greater predation pressure, the range of viable values becomes narrower, i.e., b*, bmax and bmin are closer. the intersection of these three lines is the maximum predation pressure above which the popu- lation is not viable at any assimilation rate. next, we examined the parameter dependence of the relationship between optimal assimilation rate and predation pressure by substituting various parameter sets. for changes in any parameter, a positive relationship between predation pressure and b* always appeared (fig. 6). the closed circles were obtained using the default parameter set;

(1b). the evolutionary effect on population size was negative for almost all values of p because prey ﬁsh with an evolved large body size suffered high natural mortality (fig. 7b). for the highest values of p, however, the evolutionary effect was positive and the population was viable until p * 100 in the evolutionary process, whereas it reached zero at p * 90 in the pure ecological process (small panel in fig. 7b). the evolutionary effect on population biomass was always positive, but near zero for lower values of p because the positive effect of body size and negative effect of population size cancelled each other out (fig. 7c). the population biomass peaked at a certain predation pressure and then declined because moderate predation pressure relaxes intraspeciﬁc competition and promotes the growth of individual prey ﬁsh. we conducted the same simulations for the different parameter sets. for parameter changes that caused increases in the slope of the optimal assimilation rate curves, the evolutionary effects increased relative to the ecological effects, but we obtained results quali- tatively similar to those for the default parameter values (not shown). therefore, we concluded that the tendencies for the ecological and evolutionary effects (fig. 7) are robust. discussion we ﬁrst reported the long-term body-size dynamics of the goby (fig. 3). a negative relationship between body size and abundance is common in ﬁsh (e.g., tonn & paszkowski 1986, 1992; damsga˚rd & langeland 1994; bro¨nmark et al. 1995; millner & whiting 1996). therefore, many researchers have found positive relationships between prey ﬁsh body size and predation pressure (e.g., tonn & paszkowski 1986, 1992; damsga˚rd & langeland 1994; bro¨nmark et al. 1995; olsen et al. 2001). however, we think our data are outstanding for the following reasons. first, sampling was conducted over 28 consecutive years. intraspeciﬁc competition within the goby population was also reported for the 1950s to 1970s (nagoshi 1981). compiling the data of nagoshi (1981), it is suggested that goby body size has been consistently affected by intraspeciﬁc competition for over 50 years. secondly, we observed that goby body size increased considerably (about 1.5 times in length and four times in weight). finally, there is a possibility of size evolution (see also below). it would be of signiﬁcant interest to conﬁrm size evolution in a natural ecosys- tem. in future, we will explore the possibility of size larger body size with higher predation rate evolution in the goby. the body-size dynamics of the goby will be one of the clearest and longest measured examples of this subject. we also developed a mathematical model to con- sider the increase in body size with increases in predation pressure from an evolutionary viewpoint. the model provided several qualitative predictions. first, we obtained a positive correlation between the optimal assimilation rate and predation pressure (fig. 7). the optimal assimilation rate increased when prey ﬁsh were more likely to die through predation than through natural mortality (higher p, g, h and l, and lower k), when resource availability was low (lower r and k) or when resource consumption was less efﬁcient (lower a and higher c). we did not change g because it is equivalent to a change in predation pressure p [see eqs (2) and (4)]. because v and w cancelled each other out in eq. (7), changes in these parameters would not affect the optimal assimilation rate. we set y ¼ 1 following the original von bertal- anffy growth equation (von bertalanffy 1938), but y ¼ 3/4 is more common (mcmahon 1973; dodds et al. 2001; but also see peters 1983). if y ¼ 3/4, the optimal assimilation rate would decrease because it becomes easier to grow larger. although it is imposs- ible to conﬁrm the robustness of the positive relation- ship between optimal assimilation rate and predation rate by examining exhaustive parameter space, these interpretations seem to be quite reasonable. the mode of correlation will naturally depend on the detailed model assumptions. we think that satura- tion of the optimal assimilation rate curve with increasing predation pressure is attributable to the functional forms of size-dependent predation avoid- ance f[w] and natural mortality m[b]. if we assume different shapes for the functions, we would obtain different results (e.g., exponential curve). although some studies have examined size-dependent predation (paradis et al. 1996; turesson et al. 2006), none have investigated the actual form of the function m[b] for natural mortality caused by rapid growth. is important to obtain such data to predict body-size evolution more precisely. we obtained another interesting evolutionary insight. the range of assimilation rates assuring a viable population over the long term decreased with increasing predation pressure (fig. 5). we can predict the viability of the prey ﬁsh following an increase in piscivore abundance using fig. 5. for example, sup- pose that predation pressure is constant (p ¼ 1) over some long term, and the assimilation rate reaches and remains at the optimal level corresponding to the value of p. when p increases, the assimilation rate should evolve toward the optimal value corresponding to the new value of p. if p continues to increase slowly enough to an extremely high value (p > 100), the it 369 nakazawa et al. assimilation rate can change along the curve deﬁned by the optimal values. if p increases fairly rapidly, however, the population may not be viable because (p, b*) shifts horizontally and enters the region where the system is ‘unviable’. this suggests that the prey ﬁsh population could become extinct if a piscivore increases rapidly, whereas it would be viable if the predation pressure increased slowly or the prey ﬁsh evolved rapidly such that an ‘evolutionary rescue’ would be possible. the positive evolutionary effect on the population size (small panel is explained by this evolutionary rescue effect. the introduction of piscivores into freshwater ecosystems and their subsequent ecological effects have sparked serious concern worldwide (rahel 2002); in many cases, they are the top predators (eby et al. 2006). our result suggests that we should focus on both the absolute value and the rate of change of the abundance of introduced piscivores to conserve native prey ﬁsh populations. in fig. 7b) we proposed a theoretical framework to evaluate the relative effects of ecological and evolutionary processes over the long term by calculating the body size and abundance at equilibrium (fig. 7). this is a previously introduced method of extracting the evolutionary effect by ﬁxing the parameter values (yamauchi & yamamura 2004). we found that the prey ﬁsh body size grew to a certain limit value under high predation pressure in ecological process, whereas there was no limit in evolutionary process. this may be helpful in judging size evolution; when population size is extremely small, body size would ﬂuctuate with predation pressure if evolution is present, but be saturated if absent because the resource is superﬂuous. from this viewpoint, the goby body size appears to be ﬂuctuating in early 1990s (fig. 3) despite that the cpue was almost zero (fig. 2b), which may suggest the possibility of size evolution. although this is a speculation, further research would be motivated. obtaining life-history parameters, we could determine whether the causal factor is reduced intraspeciﬁc competition or size evolution. to evaluate the relative effects of evolu- tionary process over a short period of the evolutionary speed must be considered explicitly. a model selection differential and heritability, such as size-structured model, is necessary for this type of analysis. including intraspeciﬁc variation, time, the model contains several assumptions that may require modiﬁcation for application to other cases. first, we assumed the prey ﬁsh, the goby, was semelparous. this can be changed easily to iteroparity. in fact, we obtained similar patterns for the relation- ship between optimal assimilation rate and predation pressure by assuming an iteroparous prey ﬁsh (not shown). however, this altered model will only work if 370 the assimilation rate remains constant throughout the life span and there are no trade-offs between other characteristics, which may not be satisﬁed in iterop- arous cases. therefore, many previous studies have considered an evolutionary response in growth rate or age at maturity caused by size- or stage-dependent predation pressure. for example, day et al. (2002) suggested that high size-dependent predation pressure would select for faster growth when productivity is high, assuming a trade-off between resource availab- ility and fecundity. ga˚rdmark et al. (2003) suggested that the age at maturity would evolve depending on the size-dependent predation pressure relative to the pressure of ﬁsheries targeting large ﬁsh. however, most studies assumed reduced fecundity or growth rate in later than increased natural mortality, as the evolutionary cost of rapid growth or precocity. these assumptions would be inappropriate in semelparous species because they have only one reproductive opportunity. life stages, rather next, we only considered the evolutionary response of the prey ﬁsh population, because the largemouth bass is a generalist that is affected very little by the condition of one prey species. the generation cycle (and thus, evolutionary timescale) of the predator is much longer than that of the prey ﬁsh. therefore, this assumption is not strict. in some cases, however, piscivores may adapt their foraging behaviour evolu- tionarily or phenotypically according to characteristics or behaviour of the prey ﬁsh community (stephens & krebs 1986). therefore, we should also consider the evolutionary and ecological response of the predator in such cases. furthermore, we did not address inter- speciﬁc competition with other prey ﬁsh because intraspeciﬁc competition within the goby population was very intense (nagoshi 1981). for the purpose of generalisation, however, it may be better to develop a food web model that considers the body-size dynamics and adaptive foraging. we assumed a linear functional response, as in many other theoretical studies. it is difﬁcult to analyse the invasion process using models that contain non- linear interactions. size-structure, spatial structure and environmental ﬂuctuations were also neglected for the purpose of facilitating the analysis. these problems should be addressed in future work. in considering evolutionary dynamics; we used pips to analyse the evolutionary process (geritz et al. 1998), but other methods may also be useful for example, the qualitative genetics model is one of the most popular methods (bulmer 1985). however, it is very difﬁcult to derive a ﬁtness equation when working with high-dimensional models, e.g., contain- ing body-size dynamics. likewise, it is also difﬁcult to work with canonical equations (dieckmann & law 1996) in models that contain body-size dynamics. pips would produce results similar to those obtained by calculating invasion ﬁtness directly using the equilib- rium value of the resident population (c.f. geritz et al. 2002 for numerical analysis). there is still debate over what constitutes an evolutionary cost of high individual growth rate. an increase in natural mortality rate as the cost of high individual growth rates is one of various possible costs. as blanckenhorn (2000) suggested, there are many unknowns, and we do not yet fully understand the goby case. however, we think it may be possible to understand what happened to the goby using our model by obtaining life-history parameter values and using more realistic model assumptions. finally, we insist upon the necessity of long-term monitoring. catch data and ﬁsh specimens collected over long periods in freshwater ﬁsheries provide opportunities to detect not only the ecological, but also the potential evolutionary effects of environmen- tal changes on ﬁsh species. the data will provide signiﬁcant insights into ecological and evolutionary aspects of ﬁsh body size. acknowledgements we thank two anonymous referees and the editor for their valuable comments. this research was partly supported by a grant for
