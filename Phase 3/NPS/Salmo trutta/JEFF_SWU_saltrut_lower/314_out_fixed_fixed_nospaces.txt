(2002), who studied the population-dynamic consequences of size-dependent predation using a model of a size-structured, canni- balistic perch population (claessen et al. 2000, 2002). these authors suggested that the lower limit of the predation window has a major impact on population doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00223.x 307 do¨rner et al. dynamics, whereas the upper limit mainly affects the population structure and individual life history. the present study focuses on predator–prey rela- tionships between pikeperch and four prey ﬁsh species, namely perch, pikeperch, roach and ruffe. special attention is given to the relationships between predator lengths and prey lengths and the relationship between predator gape widths and prey body depths as well as to prey size/predator size ratios. as the four prey ﬁsh species are known to differ in morphology and habitat use, predation windows of pikeperch for the four prey ﬁsh species should also differ. based on the results the impact of pikeperch on prey populations is discussed. study site bautzen reservoir (51°13¢n; 14°27¢e) is a man-made lake (ﬁrst impoundment 1974) situated about 70 km northeast of dresden (germany). the surface area of the reservoir is 533 ha, its mean depth of 7.4 m, and its maximum depth is 12 m. only a small area of the littoral zone is sparsely vegetated with submerged macrophytes and, because of high exposure to wind, thermal stratiﬁcation normally develops only for short periods. the phosphorus level of the reservoir is very )1 in 1997) and high (mean summer tp: 140 lgæl intensive recreational use is at least seasonally restric- ted due to extensive algal blooms and low water transparency. biomanipulation of the reservoir started in 1977 (benndorf et al. 1988). the enhancement of the piscivorous ﬁsh stock by stocking with pikeperch, pike, eel and european catﬁsh (silurus glanis l.) in combination with catch restrictions, led to a top-down control of the food web. consequently, the proportion of piscivores in the total adult ﬁsh biomass increased: the biomass being dominated by percids rather than cyprinids (do¨rner 2002) and age-0 perch is the dominating planktivore (mehner et al. 1996a; wagner et al. 2004; table 1). table 1. juvenile ﬁsh community in bautzen reservoir within the three investigated years. numbers represent the proportions of the total ﬁsh stock (abundance) as based on average cpue (individuals (100 m2 net)æ)1æh)1). specimens of other species were only occasionally caught. data are combined from kahl et al.

three samplings per area, average )1). in both years, ﬁshing was sampling speed 1.2 mæs carried out at weekly intervals from may to july starting immediately after twilight. after the middle of july, sampling occurred every 2 weeks. the speciﬁc study presented here was not the main reason for the intensive sampling effort. subsamples of pikeperch were taken from sampling schemes on detailed inves- tigations on spatial and temporal ﬁsh habitat use, stock assessments, stock developments, and predator–prey interactions. no mass removal of planktivorous ﬁsh took place during the trawl ﬁshing as most of the ﬁsh caught were released after length measurements. pikeperch were killed and placed on ice immedi- ately after capture. all pikeperch were measured to the nearest 1 mm total length (tl). the largest internal dimensions of the predator mouth (hereafter referred to as gape width) were measured (nearest mm) using a calliper rule. the calliper rule was inserted into the ﬁsh mouth in horizontal (gape width) direction until a marked resistance was reached. in this position, gape width could be read directly from the calliper rule. pikeperch stomach contents were analysed by counting and measuring prey organisms under a binocular and a compound microscope. if prey ﬁsh were partly digested, total lengths were back calcula- ted, based on measurements of ﬁve abdominal vertebrae (mehner 1990). corresponding maximum body depths (bd) of the age-0 prey ﬁsh total lengths (perch, pikeperch and roach) were calculated based on equations taken from do¨rner & wagner (2003). maximum bd of ruffe and older than age-0 perch, pikeperch and roach were measured (nearest mm) using a calliper rule. this was performed at the position of the anterior edge of the dorsal ﬁn. based on these measurements, bd was calculated using tl-bd equations (table 2), and bd values were plotted with the data of predator gape widths. table 2. equations for the relationships between the prey ﬁsh total lengths (tl, in mm) and body depths (bd, in mm) for pikeperch prey ﬁsh in the bautzen reservoir (ci, conﬁdence interval). prey species size range perch pikeperch roach ruffe 75–205 mm tl 70–220 mm tl 72–220 mm tl 71–155 mm tl equation (95% ci) bd ¼ 0.18*tl1.05 (0.16–0.20;

p > 0.1 in each case), i.e., the range of prey sizes eaten increase in larger predators (fig. 2). predator gape width and prey body depths (bd) were positively and linearly related (fig. 3b–d). maximum tl and bd for perch as prey were the highest for pikeperch >400 mm tl but no correlations between pikeperch tl and mean tl or bd of consumed perch were found (predator tl vs. prey tl: fig. 2a, n ¼ 805, p ¼ 0.34;

do¨rner & wagner 2003 for other percids; mittelbach & persson 1998 for fresh- water piscivores and scharf et al. 2000 for marine piscivores). in addition, ppr decreased in relation to pikeperch in this study as shown for several marine piscivores (scharf et al. 2000) and for pikeperch in freshwater systems (keskinen & marjoma¨ki 2004; lappalainen et al. 2006). the decline in ppr in pikeperch may be explained by size-selective preda- tion on age-0 ﬁsh (do¨rner et al. 1999; turesson et al. 2002). in contrast, hansson et al. (1997) detected a constant ppr in the baltic sea, which may indicate a continuous size spectrum and suitable good feeding conditions for pikeperch. in common with other piscivores such as pike (nils- son & bro¨nmark 2000), pikeperch are gape-limited 311 do¨rner et al. and frequently swallow prey ﬁsh tail ﬁrst in contrast to other predatory species such as brown_trout (salmo_trutta) (vehanen et al. 1998). therefore, both prey size and prey body depth should be correlated with gape size of the pikeperch, because prey is swallowed whole. consequently, comparisons of the relationships between pikeperch and their prey ﬁsh species with respect to the sizes of predator and prey should provide valuable information about the interactions in the food web. in a review about the ontogeny of piscivory and its ecological consequences, mittelbach & persson (1998) stated that piscivores with relatively large mouth gapes switch to piscivory at smaller sizes and were larger at age-1. the results of our study did not corroborate this statement. pikeperch have smaller mouth gapes at the same sizes when compared to perch (mean gape width at 200 mm tl: pike- perch ¼ 20 mm, perch ¼ 25 mm; do¨rner & wagner 2003; this investigation), and both species become at least partly piscivorous within their ﬁrst year in the bautzen reservoir (mehner et al. 1996b; do¨rner et al. 1999). surprisingly, pikeperch fed on larger and therefore deeper prey ﬁsh than similar-sized perch, although the pikeperch had smaller mouth gapes. this unexpected variation in size-speciﬁc diet patterns between the two predators is probably not attributed to the spatial distribution of available prey because the larger part of the pikeperch and perch populations in the bautzen reservoir use similar habitats (do¨rner et al. 1999). instead, other factors, such as signiﬁcant differences in feeding capacity associated with differ- ences in gape morphology (craig 1987), foraging behaviour and capture success (turesson & bro¨nmark 2004), should also be taken into account. similar-sized pikeperch fed on larger roach than ruffe and pikeperch, and on larger pikeperch than perch. for ruffe as prey this pattern is not surprising and reﬂects their natural size distribution with ruffe reaching a lower maximum size than, e.g., roach. the dominance of small perch in the diet of pikeperch indicates the importance of age-0 perch as prey for pikeperch which has also been shown in other studies (e.g., peltonen et al. 1996). in line with this, the impact of size-dependent predation on population dynamics and individual life history of eurasian perch was intensely studied by claessen et al. (2002). they identiﬁed different types of perch population dynamics which were, at least partly, determined by the lower limit of the predation window. with a low threshold in the predation window, cannibalism should regulate recruitment, resulting in coexistence of many year classes (claessen et al. 2002). it should be taken into account that the analyses by claessen et al. (2002) apply only to single species populations and depend on competition on shared resources and cannibalistic interactions between small and large 312 the same species. individuals of in multispecies systems, such as the present one, alternative prey ﬁsh for adults are present making the population dynam- ics less likely to be strongly affected by recruitment per se. the observed minimum size of perch (18 mm tl) and pikeperch (26 mm tl) captured by pike- perch >70 mm tl are higher than those observed for perch as predator (perch: 12 mm tl, pikeperch 23 mm tl; do¨rner & wagner 2003) in the bautzen reservoir, but average prey size is low if compared to similar sized predators investigated in other studies (mittelbach & persson 1998). the relatively low size limit in combination with a low average prey size indicates that pikeperch has the capacity to affect recruitment success strongly and thus year class strength of both perch and pikeperch. this is further supported by ﬁndings in previous studies on pike- perch and perch in the bautzen reservoir, which have shown that: (i) several year classes coexist (do¨rner 2002); (ii) both species become piscivorous very early in their life (mehner et al. 1996a,b); (iii) pikeperch and perch feed size- and species-selective on age-0 perch and age-0 pikeperch (do¨rner et al. 1999, 2003) and; (iv) that age-0 percid abundance was controlled by piscivorous perch and pikeperch (do¨rner et al. 1999). the minimum size of roach captured by pikeperch was at 27 tl mm rather high, and, in contrast to perch and pikeperch (as prey), pikeperch is probably not an important predator on age-0 roach. this is illustrated by the fact that the strong age-0 roach cohort in 1998 (table 1) was not reﬂected in an increased consump- tion of age-0 roach by the pikeperch. this could be due to spatial separation of the age-0 cohorts of roach and predatory percids. age-0 roach predominantly use the littoral zones of lakes (persson et al. 2000), and are therefore probably not available for the more pelagi- cally orientated pikeperch. in line with this, age-1 perch have been described as the most important predators of age-0 roach in the bautzen reservoir (do¨rner 2002), whereas pikeperch becomes an import- ant predator of roach later when roach get to age-1 and start to occupy the more the pelagic areas of the reservoir. acknowledgements we would like to thank j. benndorf, t. mehner, h. schultz, u. kahl and f. wieland for support. doug beare checked the language. two anonymous reviewers gave very helpful
