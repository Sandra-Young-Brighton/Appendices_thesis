divergence; habituation; acclimation; troglobite introduction while it has long been accepted that geographic isolation can lead to speciation (i.e., allopatric specia- tion; mayr 1963; coyne & orr 2004), a number of mechanisms, including sexual (maan & seehausen 2011) and natural selection (schluter 1993; riesch et al. 2011b), can lead to population divergence and eventually to ecological speciation even in sympatry (rundle & nosil 2005). once populations show signs of phenotypic and genetic divergence, and are on an evolutionary trajectory that could lead to speciation, mechanisms must be in place to reduce the probabil- ity of reticulation, or the collapse of the nascent spe- cies (woehrer et al. 2012). mechanisms responsible for maintaining species separation were potentially in generating divergence (but see also important coyne & orr 2004), and thus studying these mechanisms in detail likely also advances our under- standing of how sympatric speciation occurs. abiotic factors often play an important role in maintaining population separation and divergence (tobler et al. 2006). however, these factors often represent soft gradients, than sharp clines rather (i.e., abrupt demarcation with presence of a factor on one side and absolute absence of that factor on the other), along which populations are positioned. it is important to understand to which degree these differ- ent gradients contribute to divergence, and a sharper cline is thought to lead to conditions under which divergence can evolve easier (nosil et al. 2009a,b). classical work in botany, for example, has estab- lished how important sharp clines in soil composition can be in population divergence (dickinson & antonovics 1973; antonovics & thrall 1994). a combination of sharp and soft gradients, on the other correspondence: i. schlupp, department of biology, university of oklahoma, 730 van vleet oval, norman, ok 73019, usa. e-mail: schlupp@ou.edu 228 doi: 10.1111/eff.12017 hand, along which organisms can potentially move up and down, occur in a cluster of populations of the atlantic molly (poecilia mexicana) from tabasco, mexico (tobler & plath 2011). here, a population of atlantic mollies has colonised a toxic cave, the cueva del azufre (or cueva de villa luz), that has been under study since its scientiﬁc discovery in the 1960s (gordon & rosen 1962; parzefall 2001). the cueva del azufre is divided into 13 different cham- bers, with chamber xiii being the innermost chamber (gordon & rosen 1962). several springs in the cave (mainly in chamber x) release water that is extremely rich in hydrogen sulphide, thus forming a toxicity gradient within the cave that varies in levels of hydrogen sulphide depending on the relative position to the springs (tobler et al. 2006). as the toxic water ﬂows downstream in the cave, it is oxygenated and, as a result, becomes less toxic with greater distance from the springs. the creek that ﬂows through the cave eventually leaves the cave and becomes the toxic el azufre, a surface creek also containing hydrogen sulphide. while toxicity represents a some- what soft gradient, the change from darkness within the cave to light at the mouth of the cave is abrupt. the community of organisms inhabiting the waters of the cueva del azufre and el azufre is extremely depauperate given its geographic location in the tro- pics (gordon & rosen 1962). the atlantic molly is the only ﬁsh species that has permanently colonised the spring habitats within the cave (tobler et al. 2006; riesch et al. 2009). populations of p. mexicana inhabiting the toxic cave are fundamentally different from surface-living populations in almost every aspect of their natural history (e.g., behaviour: plath et al. 2004; morphology: tobler et al. 2008a; life his- tory: riesch et al. 2010b), and using common-garden experiments, these differences have repeatedly been shown to have a strong heritable component (e.g., behaviour: parzefall 2001; morphology: tobler et al. 2008a; life history: riesch et al. 2011a; physiology: plath & tobler 2010). thus, the combined evidence indicates a system in which ongoing, incipient specia- tion is occurring (plath et al. 2007a; tobler & plath 2011). clearly such early splitting events are labile and vulnerable to collapse if conditions change (wu & ting 2004; hendry 2009; nosil et al. 2009a,b; bolnick 2011; yeaman & whitlock 2011; woehrer et al. 2012), although so far we have no evidence for this happening in p. mexicana. in fact, we have strong evidence indicating that population divergence is relatively stable because phenotypic and genetic divergence has remained strong even if faced by strong temporary disturbance due to natural catastro- phes (like extreme ﬂooding events; plath et al. 2010). this said, there are other outcomes possible, includ- ing stable divergence with limited gene ﬂow and translocation of cave ﬁsh selection, which would enable us to study the under- lying genomic architecture of divergence (nosil 2012). previous work on mechanisms isolating the cave and the surface populations has documented that sud- den translocation of surface ﬁsh into nonfamiliar hab- itat (i.e., toxic to nontoxic and vice versa) leads to high mortality (tobler et al. 2009; plath et al. 2010), while sudden translocation within toxic habitats (i.e., toxic surface to toxic cave and vice versa) yielded no measurable mortality (tobler et al. 2009). thus, toxicity limits successful migration and promotes iso- lation between ﬁsh from nontoxic and toxic habitats. the proposed mechanism behind the high mortality is physiological incompatibility with the new condi- tions for either form (tobler et al. 2009). nonethe- less, this result comes as somewhat of a surprise, because over the last couple of decades, experimental populations of p. mexicana have successfully and repeatedly been established from toxic (surface and cave) habitats in benign (i.e., nontoxic) laboratory environments after acclimation to nontoxic water. why then was mortality in the ﬁeld experiments so high? this could be due to the sudden exposure to either relatively high levels of hydrogen sulphide (for ﬁsh from nontoxic waters) or relatively high levels of oxygen (for ﬁsh from toxic waters) following translo- cation (tobler et al. 2009). thus, while previous translocation experiments have addressed how well individuals would fair after rapid transport into a foreign environment, the more plausible scenario of slow and gradual acclimation of individuals to a new habitat has so far not been considered experimentally. as toxicity in the cave molly system represents a gradient, one can hypoth- esise that slower, more gradual movement along the gradient would allow individuals a higher probability of survival when migrating from more toxic to less toxic conditions. this question is also important relative to the surprisingly strong genetic structuring within the toxic cave. while there is strong genetic structure even between chambers within the cueva del azfure, there is, nonetheless, evidence for low levels of gene ﬂow between different cave chambers. on the other hand, we have so far found no evi- dence for any gene ﬂow from migrants between the toxic surface and toxic cave on one side and the nontoxic surface habitats on the other side, further corroborated by fst values that are usually above 0.2 for any possible pairwise comparison (plath et al. 2007a, 2010; tobler et al. 2008a, 2009). for example, tobler et al. 2009 were able to demon- strate that, based on microsatellite dna, less than 10% ﬁrst-generation migrants move from the inside of toxic surface stream, while ﬁrst-generation migrants within the cueva del azufre into the adjacent 229 schlupp et al. these habitats (e.g., between different cave cham- bers) ranged anywhere from 5 to 35%. interestingly, a study investigating the population genetic struc- ture, following a millennium ﬂood in 2007 (plath found slightly higher numbers of et al. 2010), migrants within the cave immediately after the event, pointing to a potential role of rare but cata- strophic events. what maintains population structur- ing between (and within) the cueva del azufre and the nontoxic surface habitats (plath et al. 2007a, 2010; tobler et al. 2008a)? are individuals so well adapted to the local conditions that dispersal even within the cave is limited? gradient (darkness) in this study, we addressed the following ques- tions: how do ﬁsh fair if they are translocated along the toxicity gradient within the cave, where the other environmental remains unchanged? furthermore, does acclimation to the local conditions play a role when ﬁsh are transferred from the toxic cave to nontoxic surface waters? finally, do the sexes respond differently to transloca- tions? to tackle these questions, we conducted three separate translocation experiments, all of which were designed to take individuals from higher toxicity to lower toxicity. in the ﬁrst experiment, we translocat- ed ﬁsh from the very toxic chamber x to the less toxic chamber v. in our second experiment, we moved individuals from chamber v to the even less toxic chamber ii, and ﬁnally, in a third experiment, we translocated ﬁshes from chamber v to a nontoxic surface habitat after acclimating them to nontoxic water overnight. materials and methods study system all experiments were conducted in january 2010 near tapijulapa, tabasco, mexico. we selected ﬁsh from habitats containing high hydrogen sulphide concentrations (chamber x: 91.5 ± 32.3 lm), low concentrations of hydrogen sulphide (chamber v: 28.4 ± 15.3 lm) and very low concentrations of ii: 24.0 ± 21.6 lm) hydrogen sulphide (chamber (tobler et al. 2006). additionally, ﬁsh were translo- cated to a nontoxic surface stream, the arroyo bonita (17o25′37.42″n, 92o45′6.98″w). the arroyo bonita is approximately 2 km upstream from where the outﬂow of the cueva del azufre connects to the río oxolotán, and does not contain hydrogen sul- phide (tobler et al. 2008a). local adaptation and natural selection fish were collected by hand with small dip nets in each cave chamber to minimise stress from handling 230 for the experiment in which chamber v ﬁsh were translocated to the surface habitat, we used a modi- ﬁed protocol. fishes were collected as described, kept in two 19-litre coolers in their habitat-speciﬁc water. this water was aerated for 4 h using portable air pumps, which slowly removed hydrogen sul- phide and oxygenized the water. after 4 h, we grad- ually replaced the cave water with river water from the nearby río oxolotán, a freshwater surface habi- tat. the next morning ﬁsh were then placed in indi- vidual surface habitat, arroyo bonita, a small tributary to the río oxolotán (both the río oxolotán and the arroyo bonita are natu- rally populated by the surface form of p. mexicana). overnight mortality was low; during our overnight acclimation period of chamber v ﬁsh, only one male died. containers in a and because seining is impossible due to the topogra- phy of the cave. fishes were subsequently moved to individual containers (30.48 9 8.89 9 17.78 cm) (l 9 h 9 w) and placed in cave chambers that featured lower concentrations of h2s than the local area of collection (i.e., chamber x ﬁsh were moved to cham- ber v; chamber v ﬁsh were moved to chamber ii and chamber v ﬁsh moved to the surface habitat). as a control, ﬁshes from chamber v were captured and placed in individual containers within the same chamber. we aimed for an even sex ratio in the experimental ﬁsh, but were somewhat limited by the ﬁsh available in the respective chambers (table 1). previous studies have utilised large containers (buckets with holes drilled into them) with multiple ﬁsh in the same container (tobler et al. 2009). how- ever, we chose to use smaller individual containers to minimise any stress that may be associated with crowding. additionally, small holes were drilled in each container to allow for the circulation of water. each container contained one ﬁsh and was weighed down with small rocks that were gathered locally. containers were placed in a shallow area with low ﬂow to avoid having the containers washed away. due to the low oxygen concentrations in the cueva del azufre, cavernicolous p. mexicana spend the majority of their time at the water’s surface perform- ing aquatic surface respiration (asr) to exploit increased oxygen levels (tobler et al. 2006). there- fore, we did not fully submerge our containers to avoid mortality that could be attributed to behaviour- al limitations. once all ﬁsh were placed in individual containers, we allowed 1 h for acclimatisation and subsequently checked the condition of the ﬁsh in each habitat (see table 1). at the termination of each experiment (after 24 h), ﬁsh were removed from containers, sacriﬁced and preserved in 5% formalde- hyde to avoid inadvertent mixing of populations. all individuals used in the experiment were adult. for table 1. detail of the translocation experiments. experiment date from → to sample size (males/females) mortality (males/females) 1a 1b 2a 2b 3 4 090111 100111 090111 100111 120111 130111 x → v x → v v → ii v → ii v → v v → bonita 7/13 9/11 9/11 10/10 10/10 21/19 2/2 2/1 0/0 0/0 0/0 6/0 logistical reasons, we were unable to conduct a study that would have measured mortality over a longer term. similarly, we were unable to conduct a control experiment within chamber x. statistical analysis we used a stepwise-backwards cox regression based on likelihood ratios to analyse individual survival of p. mexicana as implemented in ibm® spss® statis- tics 19.0.0 (ibm corporation). in the original model, ‘treatment’ (psx-to-psv, psv-to-psv, psv-to-psii and psv-to-ab), ‘sex’ (male vs. female) and the interaction of ‘treatment-by-sex’ were included as covariates. results the covariates ‘treatment’ survival of term ‘treatment-by-sex’ when analysing the cave-dwelling p. mexicana in different habitats, the covariate ‘sex’ (p = 0.868) was removed from the ﬁnal cox regres- sion model during the stepwise-backwards approach. (b = 0.84, only se = 0.39, wald = 4.69, d.f. = 1, p = 0.03) and the (b =  0.58, interaction se = 0.29, wald = 3.91, d.f. = 1, p = 0.048) were retained as statistically signiﬁcant in the ﬁnal model ( 2 log likelihood = 127.42). overall we detected very low mortality across treatments. no mortality was uncovered in two treat- ments (psv-to-psv and psv-to-psii), while some mortality occurred in the other two treatments (psx- to-psv and psv-to-ab, fig. 1; signiﬁcant ‘treat- ment’ effect). furthermore, while males and females suffered roughly similar mortality rates when trans- ferred from highly toxic waters (psx) to low levels of toxicity (psv), only males were negatively affected by being transferred from low levels of toxicity (psv) (ab, fig. 1; signiﬁcant ‘treatment-by-sex’ effect). to

likely to aid population separation than soft gradients (nosil et al. 2009a,b), as exempliﬁed by the hydrogen sulphide gradient known for the cave molly within the cueva del azufre. in our particular system, we examined how differences in hydrogen sulphide toxicity affect the survival of immigrants, and therefore population structuring, between populations within the cueva del azufre. previous research indicated that abrupt changes in water conditions (i.e., toxic to nontoxic and vice versa) lead to very high mortality in translo- cated ﬁshes, but that translocation between chamber ii and the el azufre (i.e., toxic cave and toxic sur- face) resulted in no measurable mortality (tobler et al. 2009). in the experiment presented here, in which we tested for survivorship during gradual migration from highly toxic to lesser toxic microhabi- tats (i.e., cave chambers) within the cave, we found low levels of mortality in two of four treatments. this indicates that differences in toxicity found within the 231 schlupp et al. cave do not fully explain the genetic structure uncov- ered by previous studies (plath et al. 2007a, 2010; tobler et al. 2008a). clearly, factors other than the toxicity gradient must play a role here in limiting between-chamber movement, and we can only specu- late that they could include sexual selection, preda- tion and age-speciﬁc mortality. furthermore, we found that translocation from a toxic cave habitat to a nontoxic surface habitat results in relatively low mor- tality if the water is slowly detoxiﬁed and ﬁsh have time to adjust to the new conditions. interestingly, males turned out to be signiﬁcantly more likely to die than females, when translocated from toxic waters within the cave to a nontoxic surface water habitat. sex-speciﬁc responses to physi- ological stress are widespread among animal taxa (e. g., insects: freitak et al. 2012; rats: sterrenburg et al. 2011; humans: verma et al. 2011), and even though this depends on the taxa under investigation and the stressors involved, males often seem to be more sen- sitive to stressful conditions (freitak et al. 2012; but see riesch et al. 2011b). in our system, it is not clear what exactly is causing this. nonetheless, our ﬁnding is congruent with data from previous ﬁeld experi- ments in this system in which males usually also per- formed worse than females (plath et al. 2007a,b). likely males are physiologically less capable of buf- fering adverse conditions than females, potentially due to the lower body condition of cave molly males exhibited within the cueva del azufre, indicating the males might be more energy limited than females (riesch et al. 2010b, 2011a,b). additional indirect evidence for this comes from studies investigating male–male aggression and the propensity of males to engage in sexual harassment of females (e.g., parze- fall 2001; bierbach et al. 2012). while these behav- iours are widespread in p. mexicana from benign habitats, such costly behaviours are highly reduced in the cueva del azufre, likely as an adaptation to pre- serve much needed energy for reproduction (parzefall 2001; bierbach et al. 2012). finally, while our results could also indicate that buffering ability might poten- tially increase with size (and p. mexicana males are on average smaller than females; riesch et al. 2010b, 2011a,b), this interpretation is unlikely because a pre- vious study has shown that smaller adults actually have a higher sulphide tolerance than larger individu- als (tobler et al. 2011b). in summary, our experiments indicate that under certain conditions (i.e., gradual transfer along the gradient from toxic to nontoxic), factors other than toxicity must also play an important role in maintain- ing reproductive isolation reported on by previous studies (plath et al. 2007a, 2010; tobler et al. 2008a). clearly, sudden translocation as it is possible during extreme ﬂooding events (plath et al. 2010) or human- 232 induced translocation during a religious ceremony, in which cave ﬁshes are poisoned and immobilized resulting in passive downstream drifting (tobler et al. 2011a), is not likely to lead to successful gene ﬂow due to the high mortality induced by rapid transloca- tion between extreme and benign environments (to- bler et al. 2009). under the scenario that we investigated here that envisions gradual movement along a gradient allowing for potential acclimatisation, previously described additional selective forces acting against migrants (e.g., predation: tobler 2009; riesch et al. 2010a; sexual selection: tobler et al. 2008b) are likely to contribute more to reproductive isolation than previously assumed (tobler 2009). finally, the higher survival of females, nonetheless, raises the interesting possibility of sex-speciﬁc dispersal that should be investigated further in future studies. acknowledgements we are very grateful to the people and authorities of tapijula- pa
