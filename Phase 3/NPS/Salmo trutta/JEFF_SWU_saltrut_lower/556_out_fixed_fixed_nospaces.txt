7.73 g) and 86 mm tl (5.57 g), respectively. sex ratio was 1.09 females:1 male. batch fecundity ranged from 46 to 454 (mean 167.5 ± 25.7 se). estimates for the length at which 50 and 95% of females ﬁrst spawned were 36.4 and 44.3 mm tl, respectively. craterocephalus cuneiceps is essentially a detritivore, but also feeds on aquatic invertebrates. rainfall in the murchison river catchment is unpredictable and ph, salinity and temperature are variable. a specialised diet, small size and young age at maturity and protracted spawning period, coupled with serial spawning and high fecundity, allows the numerical dominance of this species in competitive, harsh, arid and unpredictable desert environments. m. g. allen, d. l. morgan, h. s. gill centre for fish and fisheries research, school of biological sciences and biotechnology, murdoch university, western australia, australia key words: atherinidae;

allen 1989; ivantsoff 1994; nelson 1994; allen et al. 2002). the family has a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate waters between approximately 50°n and 50°s (ivantsoff 1978; merrick & schmida 1984; allen et al. 2002). while the majority of species inhabit shallow, coastal marine and/or estuarine waters, some are diadromous and about 50 are restricted to freshwaters (ivantsoff 1978; nelson 1994; allen et al. 2002). almost half of the world’s doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00088.x 209 allen et al. freshwater atherinids belong to the australian–new guinean genus craterocephalus (crowley & ivantsoff 1992; crowley et al. 1995; allen et al. 2002). craterocephalus has been the subject of extensive studies regarding its taxonomy, systematics and zoo- geography (ivantsoff 1978; patten 1978; ivantsoff et al. 1987a,b; crowley & ivantsoff 1988, 1989, 1990a,b, 1992; crowley 1990; crowley et al. 1991, 1995). this extensive focus on taxonomy saw the number of known craterocephalus species increase from 12 to 25 between 1986 and 1995 (crowley et al. 1995). although various studies have examined spe- ciﬁc aspects of the biology of some species, for example, reproduction and development (llewellyn 1979; semple 1986; ivantsoff et al. 1988), reproduc- tion, age and growth (prince et al. 1982; milton & arthington 1983; prince & potter 1983; potter et al. 1986) and population genetics (mcglashen & hughes 2000), no biological data are available for the four western australian freshwater members. three of these species are found in the kimberley region of western australia, i.e., drysdale hardyhead (crater- ocephalus helenae ivantsoff et al. 1987a), prince lentiginosus regent ivantsoff et al. 1987b), and the strawman (cratero- cephalus stramineus (whitley, 1950), the ﬁrst two of which are endemic to that region, while a fourth the murchison river hardyhead (cratero- species, cephalus cuneiceps) is endemic to the indian ocean (pilbara) drainage division of western australia. craterocephalus cuneiceps is the sole freshwater atherinid in the indian ocean drainage division, and its distribution is apparently fragmented (allen 1989) with records indicating that the species is conﬁned to the northernmost river and the four largest southern- most rivers, with no records of this species from the mid-region of its range. however, as there have been limited surveys of inland ﬁshes in the indian ocean drainage division, the apparently fragmented distribution is real or an artefact of low sampling effort. is not known whether it hardyhead (craterocephalus the indian ocean drainage division, which extends from the greenough river in the mid-west of western australia to the degrey in the north-west, is one of the hottest, driest and most isolated areas of australia (unmack 2001; morgan & gill 2004; fig. 1). perennial surface waters are scarce and most of the region’s rivers are a series of disconnected pools for much of the year, with many rivers running only after major ﬂood events associated with tropical cyclones. interspeciﬁc variation in life-history parameters such as spawning periods, cues and length/age at maturity in ﬁshes can vary enormously, yet wootton (1984) suggested that a particular geographical region limits the types of reproductive strategies possible with environmental constraints, morphology and phylogeny 210 determining their evolution. it is hypothesised that, unlike more southern western australian freshwater ﬁshes, which undergo discrete seasonal spawning periods during the consistently wet winters that the region experiences (e.g., pen & potter 1991; morgan et al. 1995, 2000), species found in the northern desert regions of western australia, such as c. cuneiceps, would spawn following erratic and epizootic rainfall events to which the region is exposed. the ﬁrst aim of this study was to determine whether the apparently fragmented distribution of c. cuneiceps is real or an artefact of low sampling effort and, if the former is the case, to develop hypotheses regarding the current distribution of this species. the second aim was to describe the reproductive biology of c. cuneiceps and thereby test the hypothe- sis that, as c. cuneiceps inhabits one of the hottest and most arid regions of australia that experiences irregular rainfall events, spawning is likely to follow ﬂood events. this study represents one of only two comprehen- sive biological studies of a freshwater atherinid from the australia–new guinea region and the ﬁrst for any freshwater ﬁsh species from the indian ocean drain- age division of australia. materials and methods sampling methods each of the main river systems between the degrey and irwin rivers (between latitudes 20°25¢s and 29°15¢s) in the indian ocean drainage division of western australia was sampled for ﬁsh (fig. 1). fish were captured using seine nets made from 3-mm woven mesh that were 10 or 15 m in length and ﬁshed to a depth of 1.5 m. a handheld global positioning system device was used to determine the latitude and longitude at each individual sampling site, and the software package mapinfo (mapinfo corporation 1998) was used to generate a distribution map for c. cuneiceps (fig. 1). murchison river study site a location in the murchison river on the eastern boundary of kalbarri national park (27°49¢s, 114°29¢e), where c. cuneiceps was always present in large numbers, was chosen as the study site for the biological investigation of the species (fig. 1). the murchison river, whose headwaters arise in the little sandy desert approximately 500 km inland (near meekatharra) from the mouth at kalbarri, is large by western australian standards. the catchment, most of which is arid to semi-arid scrubland, covers approxi- mately 120 000 km2 and is largely unpopulated. murchison river hardyhead, distribution and biology australia degrey river wa museum this study not captured gascoyne river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river wooramel river murchison study site study site study site study site study site study site study site study site study site manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra meekatharra murchison river kalbarri hutt river greenough river fig. 1. the distribution of craterocephalus cuneiceps (from this study and the western australian museum records). the murchi- son river study site and precipitation data localities are included. the study site was a large, shallow (approximately 1.5–2.5-m deep) permanent pool (approximately 20-m wide) with a substrate consisting of ﬁne silt overlying coarser sand and intermittent sandstone boulders. dense stands of aquatic vegetation (predominantly ruppia sp.) were present in the siltier sections of the stream bed. monthly sampling was undertaken between december 2000 and november 2001. in addition to the seine nets, a sweep net with a mesh size of 500 lm and a diameter of 800 mm was used to capture larvae near the edge of the river. on collection, a subsample of between 75 and 131 ﬁsh was taken. these ﬁsh were then anaesthetised in benzocaine, placed in 100% ethanol and transported to the laboratory for processing. environmental variables three to ﬁve replicate measurements of temperature, ph and salinity were recorded on each sampling occasion at the murchison river study site. 0 100 200 kilometres data for monthly precipitation at i.e., kalbarri the mouth of (27°42¢46¢¢s, the murchison river, 114°09¢41¢¢e), located approximately 45 km west of three upstream sites (i.e., murchison (26°53¢41¢¢s, 115°57¢17¢¢e), manfred (26°26¢46¢¢s, and meekatharra (26°36¢48¢¢s, 118°32¢14¢¢e)) were obtained from the western australian bureau of meteorology (see fig. 1). the study site, and at 116°32¢51¢¢e) salinity tolerance during the study it was noted that at some sites where salinity was obviously high (i.e., salt deposits present), the resident c. cuneiceps varying proportions of population were observed to be dead or dying. to explore the possibility of a relationship between salinity level and mortality, a logistic equation was ﬁtted to the percentages of dead c. cuneiceps at the recorded salinity levels using a nonlinear subroutine in the spss package (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) 1 211 allen et al. (saila et al. 1988). the logistic equation, used to estimate the salinity at which 50 and 95% mortality occurred was, ps ¼ 1/[1 + e ) ln 19(s)s50)/(s95)s50)], where ps is the proportion of dead c. cuneiceps at salinity s. s50 and s95 are the salinities at which 50% and 95% mortality of the c. cuneiceps population occurred respectively. 2 length–weight relationships, age and growth the total length (tl) and standard length (sl) of each ﬁsh was measured to the nearest millimetre. the preserved weight was measured to the nearest milli- gram. the relationships between these variables were determined. the sagittal otoliths of each ﬁsh were removed, placed in a black dish containing glycerol and examined using reﬂected light under a dissecting microscope. however, as no single, annual decline was evident in the mean monthly marginal increments (for rationale see campana 2001) of c. cuneiceps in the murchison river, they were unable to be aged using otoliths. age and growth was therefore esti- mated using cohort progression in the monthly length– frequency histograms. as the dominance of one sex over another in different months obscured the analysis of cohort progression in length–frequency histograms plotted separately for each sex, the data for both sexes were combined (see results). reproductive biology the sex of each ﬁsh was determined by examining the gonad under a dissecting microscope. it was possible to sex all ﬁsh >14 mm tl. the stage of development of each gonad was recorded based on its macroscopic appearance. six categories, modiﬁed from laevastu (1965), were used to describe the stage of gonadal development, i.e., stage i/ii, virgin or maturing virgin; iii, developing; iv, developed; v, gravid; vi, spawning; vii, spent. eighty female gonads from different stages of development were ﬁxed in bouin’s, dehydrated in a series of alcohols, sectioned at 6 lm embedded in parafﬁn wax, and stained using mallory’s trichrome. these sec- tions were then used to verify the macroscopic staging. the gonadosomatic index (gsi) for the different sexes was calculated according to the formula: gsi ¼ w1/w2·100, where w1 is the weight of the gonad and w2, the weight of the ﬁsh. the fecundities of 19 ripe (i.e., early stage vi) females, ranging in length between 45 and 87 mm tl, were estimated using a modiﬁcation of the methodo- logy of llewellyn (1979). counts of large-sized (>0.90 mm diameter) and medium-sized ova (0.11– 212 0.90 mm diameter) were made. only females that had a high gsi (i.e., >4.0) were used, as they were considered less likely to have already released many eggs. batch fecundity was calculated from the counts of the large oocytes, while the potential fecundity was obtained from the total counts of the large and medium-sized ova. the spss package was used to generate equations for the above relationships and test their signiﬁcance (saila et al. 1988). lengths at maturity a nonlinear subroutine in the spss package (saila et al. 1988) was used to ﬁt a logistic equation to the percentages of c. cuneiceps that had begun maturation (i.e., gonad stage iii or higher) in sequential 2 mm tl increments. the logistic equation was used to estimate length at commencement of maturation for both sexes and had the form: pl ¼ 1/[1 + e ) ln 19(l)l50)/(l95)l50)], where pl is the proportion of c. cuneiceps with a gonad at stage iii or above at length interval l, l50 and l95 are the lengths at which 50 and 95% of the c. cuneiceps population commence maturation respectively. sem of mature oocytes hydrated oocytes were removed intact from a stage vi ovary, dehydrated in a series of alcohols, critical point dried and coated with gold prior to inspection under a philips xl 20 scanning electron microscope (sem; philips, eindhoven, the netherlands) . characteristics of the chorionic ﬁlaments were then measured from the sem images. 3 diets the intestinal tracts of 50 ﬁsh from the mid-month of each season (i.e., january in summer, april in autumn, july in winter and october in spring) were removed and examined. as the intestinal tract of c. cuneiceps lacks a well-deﬁned stomach, the foregut was exam- ined (see for example pen et al. 1993). gut fullness was estimated on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing an empty foregut, eight representing a full foregut and 10 representing a fully distended foregut (hynes 1950). proportional volumetric contri- bution estimates of the various food items in the foregut were made. as the diet of c. cuneiceps consisted largely of detrital matter, appearing as brownish-orange sludge, a small sample of the mater- ial was placed on a slide and examined at high magniﬁcation. proportional volumetric estimates of the various components of the detritus were then recorded. the percentage occurrence of the different food types was calculated. results distribution of craterocephalus cuneiceps craterocephalus cuneiceps was collected at 37 of the 171 sites sampled in the indian ocean drainage division of western australia (i.e., between the irwin and degrey rivers; fig. 1). river systems from which the species was collected during the study included the greenough, hutt, murchison, gascoyne and degrey. while the western australian museum has further records of this species from the wooramel river, this river was not sampled as permanent water was not readily accessible during this study and all of the sites visited were dry river beds. )2 (±1.67 se). it is worth noting that the species was most commonly encountered in the murchison river (captured at 15 of 16 sites sampled), at a mean density of approximately 4.3 individu- als m in the murchison river, the only site where it was not recorded was in the estuarine reaches. although less frequently encountered in the greenough river (cap- tured at nine of 21 sites sampled), when captured, it was more abundant here than in any other system )2 [mean density approximately 16.8 individuals m (±2.18 se)]. in the gascoyne river it was recorded at four of the seven sites sampled, at a mean density of )2 (±1.88 se), while approximately 3.2 individuals m in the hutt river, it was recorded at only two of seven )2 captured. the sites, with only 0.09 individuals m relative abundances of c. cuneiceps in the northern- most part of its range were relatively low. it was encountered at only seven of 25 sites sampled in the degrey river system (fig. 1) and, at the sites where present, a mean density of approximately 0.5 individ- uals m )2 (±0.34 se) was recorded. environmental variables monthly precipitation data for kalbarri (at the mouth of the murchison river) reﬂects its mediterranean climate with the bulk of precipitation occurring from late autumn to winter, i.e., between may and august. mean annual precipitation is low (375.1 mm) and during the study period (346.9 mm) was below the 30-year average. nearly half of the rain fell in july. the inland sections of the murchison river catchment experienced drier conditions, with precipitation during the at murchison (245.7 mm, mean ¼ 262.5 mm), but above average at both manfred (287.6 mm, mean ¼ 201.3 mm) and meekatharra (308.2 mm, mean ¼ 238.6 mm). during the course of the study three separate ﬂow pulses were observed, i.e., in january, july and october. the pulse inland in january was associated with signiﬁcant rainfall, whereas precipitation recorded near the study being below average murchison river hardyhead, distribution and biology coastal town of kalbarri accounted for the ﬂow pulse in july. the ﬂow pulse in october was associated with relatively high rainfall the catchment during that month. throughout mean water temperature reached a maximum of 27.2 °c in february before declining to a minimum of 15.6 °c in august, after which it increased steadily. water temperatures were above 20 °c from october to april. waters were generally alkaline, with ph ﬂuctuating between approximately 7 and 10. declines in ph coincided with two of the three aforementioned ﬂow pulses. salinity was extremely variable at the study site. a minimum salinity of 0.8& was recorded in march, while salinity was highest (13.9&) in september. major declines occurred between december and january and september and october, both of which coincided with considerable inland rainfall. salinity increased between may and september, a period when coastal rainfall was high. salinity tolerance while all c. cuneiceps at salinities <30& were alive, many of those at higher salinities were dead. a logistic curve ﬁtted to the percentage of dead c. cuneiceps at varying salinities gave an estimated s50 of 30.4& (±0.09 se) and s95 of 31.7& (±0.25 se). sex ratio, length–weight relationships and length– frequency distributions the size range for the 1211 c. cuneiceps captured at the murchison river study site, and used for the biological study, was 6–96 mm tl (fig. 2). the longest female recorded was 96 mm tl (approxi- mately 79 mm sl) and weighed 7.73 g, while the longest male captured was 86 mm tl (approximately 70 mm sl) and weighed 5.57 g. the overall sex ratio of ﬁsh that could be sexed was 1.09 females:1 male. although this ratio is close to parity, in some months it was skewed towards males and in others towards females (e.g. 1 female:2.14 males in august and 2.26 females:1 male in september). the relationship between total length (tl) and standard length (sl) for c. cuneiceps in the murch- ison river was sl ¼ 0.821 tl ) 0.228, (r ¼ 0.999), for females, and sl ¼ 0.815 tl ) 0.179 (r ¼ 0.999) for males. the relationship between tl and preserved weight (w) was w ¼ 4(10) )6 tl3.159 (r ¼ 0.997) for females, and w ¼ 5(10) )6 tl3.193 (r ¼ 0.997) for males. larvae and small juveniles (<12 mm tl) were present in all months of the year suggesting that recruitment occurred in each month (fig. 2). as 213 allen et al. 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 15 10 5 0 15 10 5

those ﬁsh representing over 30% of the population in most months (fig. 3). this protracted spawning period and concomitant recruitment of larvae were reﬂected in the occurrence of small immature ﬁsh <12 mm tl in all months (figs 2 and 3). trends for the the mean monthly gsi for developing and mature ﬁsh were similar for females and males (fig. 4). gsi ﬂuctuated slightly but remained under 2.0 for both sexes between decem- ber and june, with females exhibiting a higher monthly mean than males. mean monthly gsi increased dramatically for both sexes after june, peaking in august at 5.6 (±0.44 se) and 3.5 (±0.14 se) respectively. while these notable peaks in gsi suggest that the spawning period is from august to november, the fact that larvae and spawning and/or spent gonads were observed in every month contradicts this view. these peaks may in fact reﬂect a reduced spawning activity during the colder months (figs 2 and 3). and males females for the estimated numbers of large- and medium-sized oocytes in the ovaries of ripe females ranged between 46–454 and 1281–14600 respectively. thus, it would appear that c. cuneiceps has a batch fecundity of between 46 and 454 (mean ¼ 167.5 ± 25.70 se) and can possibly release up to approximately 15 000 eggs. the females used for these estimates had a length and gsi range of 45–87 mm tl and 4.19–9.34 respect- ively. there were signiﬁcant relationships (p < 0.001) between total lengths and batch and potential fecund- ities. batch fecundity (bf) was described by the equation bf ¼ 3.186 e0.0521tl (r ¼ 0.76), and total fecundity (f) by

an environmental explanation for such extinctions is unlikely given that climatic conditions are fairly uniform throughout the region, and physicochemical characteristics of rivers in which the species does not occur (e.g. ashburton, fortescue) are very similar to those in rivers where it is extant (d. morgan, unpublished data). another reason for the loss could be through competition with other ﬁshes, and in particular the related species, the western rainbow ﬁsh (melanotaenia australis (castelnau 1875)) for habitat and spawning substrate, and the bony herring (nematalosa erebi (gu¨nther 1868)) for food. however, in the degrey river c. cuneiceps was found in mixed schools with m. australis while elsewhere rainbow ﬁshes and hardyheads thrive together (hansen 1988; g. allen personal communi- cation). in the case of competition with n. erebi for food, a species that is known to consume large proportions of algae and bioﬁlm (morgan et al. 2004a), our ﬁeld work experience suggests that these resources are unlikely to be limiting. to support the remaining hypothesis that would explain the disjunct contemporary distribution is that c. cuneiceps has simply never inhabited the rivers from which it is so conspicuously absent (e.g. ashburton and fortes- cue). a body of biogeographical, geological and palaeoclimatic evidence does exist this hypothesis. as noted above it is believed that the ancestor of the eyersii species group invaded a vast inland sea that covered much of the australian continent via the canning basin (fig. 7). this route would have taken the ancestral stock of c. cuneiceps within close proximity of the contemporary degrey river drainage, explaining why the species is now found in that river (fig. 7). from there, it probably dispersed southwards through the inland sea along the eastern fringe of the emergent ‘pilbara’ block and colonised palaeo-rivers that drained the eastern side of the ‘pilbara’ block (fig. 7) during the period leading up to the mid-miocene (12–15 ma), when the pre- vailing climate was much wetter than it is at present (van de graaff et al. 1977). dispersal into the greenough, murchison and gascoyne rivers may have been facilitated by massive ﬂooding resulting in the connection of these westward- ﬂowing rivers with those of the eastward-ﬂowing palaeo-rivers. alternatively, the dispersal may have the headwaters of 217 allen et al. early cretaceous ~ 110–95 ma initial route of invasion by marine ancestor of c. cuneiceps marine transgression early eocene ~ 60–50 ma hypothetical distribution of ancestral c. cuneiceps areas of high relief inhibiting dispersal hypothesised dispersal route major drainage divide mid-miocene – present day ~ 15–0 ma present distribution of c. cuneiceps degrey r. fortescue r. ashburton r. gascoyne r. wooramel r. murchison r. hutt r. greenough r. paleodrainages marine transgression ephemeral salt lakes 0 100 200 kilometres 9,10 9,10 fig. 7. diagrammatic representation of the hypothesised route of dispersal of ances- tral craterocephalus cuneiceps based on ivantsoff (1978); crowley (1990) and this study. maps modiﬁed from brown et al. (1968) and van de graaff et al. (1977) . resulted from the capture of palaeo-river headwaters by these westward-ﬂowing rivers following epeiroge- nies (i.e., crustal warping events) associated with the separation of the australian plate from the antarctic plate c. 55 ma (van de graaff et al. 1977). the absence of c. cuneiceps in the ashburton and fortescue rivers is probably the result of the fact that the mountain ranges (e.g. chichester, hammersley, collier) that surround these rivers are the highest in western australia and, because of their high relief, it is 218 unlikely that connections with eastern ﬂowing palaeo- rivers through ﬂooding or eastward-ﬂowing stream capture ever occurred in this part of the pilbara. this may also explain why c. cuneiceps is also absent from some of the smaller coastal drainages in the southern part of its range as, even in the event of crustal warping, it is extremely unlikely that the headwaters of the palaeo-rivers that drained the eastern side of the ‘pilbara’ were captured by these small coastal systems. given reports of the ability of c. cuneiceps to tolerate marine conditions (allen 1989) and even salinities up to twice that of sea water, it is reasonable to expect the species would be more widely distributed than it is at present. however, data gathered in the ﬁeld during this study demonstrated that the upper salinity tolerance for the species is approximately 30& (sea water is approximately 35&), indicating that survival in, and dispersal via the marine environ- ment are highly unlikely. laboratory trials should be conducted to validate these ﬁeld observations. that considering that there has been no connection between the southern rivers in which c. cuneiceps is found and the degrey river in the north for at least the past 12–15 million years (and possibly for up to 60 million years) it may be that the degrey ﬁsh represent a distinct species. however, it must be noted that utilising both morphological and electrophoretic data crowley & ivantsoff (1992) considered ﬁsh from the murchison and degrey rivers to be c. cuneiceps. analyses utilising appropriate mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data collected from all known populations of c. cuneiceps should permit estimates of divergence times and the history of the population structure to be developed, and thus the testing of the above hypotheses. age and growth as otoliths of c. cuneiceps in the murchison river could not be used to reliably age ﬁsh, cohort progression analysis was adopted to estimate age and growth. however, in the present study cohorts were generally indistinct (fig. 2). this was, in part, because of the constant recruitment of larvae into the popula- tion during the protracted breeding period, which resulted in a considerable overlap between the size ranges of the neighbouring cohorts. despite the unavoidable drawbacks in the analysis of growth, progression of one cohort suggests that ﬁsh would be approximately 36–37.9 mm tl at approximately 8 months of age. if it is assumed that growth continues at approximately the same rate, at 1 year of age ﬁsh lengths would roughly equate to 54–57 mm tl. thus, the large number of ﬁsh captured between 57 and 80 mm tl are likely to be in their second or even third year of life. the fact that few ﬁsh >80 mm tl were murchison river hardyhead, distribution and biology captured during the study suggests that the majority of ﬁsh may die before reaching the end of their second year of life. higher mortality of these larger ﬁsh may be, in part, because of the fact that these ﬁsh are more conspicuous due to their larger size and suffer greater losses through predation by sympatric ﬁsh (i.e., spangled perch (leiopotherapon unicolor (gu¨nther 1859)) and yellowtail trumpeter [amniataba cauda- vittata (richardson 1845)] and birds (e.g. cormorants, see for example humphries et al. (1992) and gill et al. (1996)). reproductive biology the results of this study offer compelling evidence that the population of c. cuneiceps in the murchison river spawns throughout the year. this spawning period was considerably longer in duration than those reported for wild populations of congeneric freshwater species. for example, craterocephalus stercusmu- scarum stercusmuscarum (gu¨nther, 1867) and crat- erocephalus marjoriae whitley, 1948, from the brisbane river (queensland, north-eastern australia) and craterocephalus stercusmuscarum fulvus ivants- off et al. (1987a), from the murray river (new south wales, eastern australia) were shown to have a spawning season that commenced in spring (septem- ber or october) and lasted for approximately 5 months (llewellyn 1979; milton & arthington 1983). of the estuarine congeners, craterocephalus honoriae (ogil- by, 1912) from smith’s lake (new south wales) commenced a 6-month breeding season in august (potter et al. 1986) and craterocephalus mugiloides (mcculloch, 1913) from the swan river (western australia) commenced a 5-month breeding period in september (prince & potter 1983). menidia beryllina (cope 1867) from florida and membras vagrans (goode & bean 1879) from veracruz, both estuarine inhabitants, are also reported to breed year round (flores-coto 1983; middaugh & hemmer 1992). semple (1986) considered an increase in water temperature above a certain threshold to be the essential cue for three species of craterocephalus (i.e., c. marianae, c. stercusmuscarum and c. marjoriae) to commence spawning. data from the present study indicate that, for c. cuneiceps, breeding and thus recruitment may be reduced when water temperatures are below 20 °c. s. histological examination of female gonads indica- ted that c. cuneiceps is a serial spawner, i.e., produces numerous batches of eggs during the breeding season. craterocephalus cuneiceps in the murchison river had a higher mean batch fecundity (167.5 compared with 52.4, 122.0, 136.8 and 70.5) than four fresh- water congeneric species (llewellyn 1979; milton & arthington 1983). an inspection of the histological 219 allen et al. sections of the ovaries of spent females (i.e., stage vii) revealed that not all the oocytes in the ovary are ovulated, indicated by the fact that many vitellogenic and hydrated oocytes were in a state of atresia in such gonads. so, while estimates of total fecundity suggest that individual female c. cuneiceps have the potential to release up to approximately 15 000 eggs in a single breeding season, the number actually released is probably much lower. notwithstanding this observa- tion, it would appear that c. cuneiceps is, for such a small ﬁsh, extremely fecund, again a strategy that helps to ensure its continuing survival in an arid and hostile environment. serial spawning is a common reproductive strategy employed by species of the atherinidae (e.g. hildebrand & schroeder 1927; hubbs et al. 1971; turnpenny et al. 1981) and is regarded as an effective means by which small ﬁsh species can maximise the number of eggs produced during a breeding season (prince & potter 1983; molsher et al. 1994). such a reproductive strategy is considered to offer a selective advantage for individ- uals that are subjected to intense predation (prince & potter 1983). preliminary investigation of the diets of the larger sympatric species (i.e., spangled perch and yellowtail they predate heavily on c. cuneiceps (d. morgan unpublished data). the combination of a continuous breeding season and the strategy of serial spawning would maximise survival of offspring despite heavy preda- tion. as historical precipitation data for the murchison river catchment suggests that rainfall is sporadic and can occur throughout the year, an ability to spawn year round may favour recruitment during increased ﬂows, with associated higher turbidities and increased water volume (i.e., habitat) possibly reducing predation. revealed that trumpeter) the size of mature oocytes (i.e., approximately 1–1.4 mm diameter) of c. cuneiceps is well within the range recorded for all other atherinids (white et al. 1984). like most other atheriniforms, mature eggs of c. cuneiceps were spherical in shape and possessed chorionic ﬁlaments (llewellyn 1979; white et al. 1984; semple 1986; howe et al. 1988). morphologi- cal characteristics of the egg and chorionic ﬁlaments of c. cuneiceps were not appreciably different from those of distantly related pseudomugil spp. (howe et al. 1988). they could be distinguished, however, by the lack of a basal collar on their ﬁlaments. chorionic ﬁlaments are adhesive and facilitate the attachment of the egg to the foliage of aquatic vegetation. this probably serves to prevent dispersal and buffeting of the egg in strong currents, a particularly useful adaptation considering that breeding can coincide with erratic ﬂow pulses. furthermore, deposition of eggs among aquatic vegetation would also afford some protection from predators (llewellyn 1979), ensure that the eggs remain in a section of the water column 220 that is usually well aerated, and reduce the likelihood of bacterial infection than would be the case if eggs were deposited on the substrate (g. allen personal communication). the smallest mature (stage v) female c. cuneiceps captured during the study was approximately 33 mm tl (approximately 27 mm sl and approximately 6 months old). thus, sexual maturity is attained at a slightly smaller size and considerably younger age than for females belonging to three congeneric species, i.e., c. s. stercusmuscarum, c. marjoriae and c. marianae, which attained sexual maturity at the end of their ﬁrst year of life at a length of 29, 35 and 32 mm sl, respectively (milton & arthington 1983; semple 1986). the similarity in length at sexual maturity for all these species may reﬂect both their relatedness and the fact that they are all subject to heavy predation in their respective environments. the rapid attainment of sexual maturity affords these species an increased likeli- hood of continuing survival in the face of adversity. diets patten (1977) reported the remarkable length of the intestine of c. cuneiceps, which is wrapped several times around the gonad in the body cavity, and assumed that this indicated that the diet of this species included plant material. the results of the current study conﬁrmed this assumption. while essentially a detritivore, c. cuneiceps was also found to prey on invertebrates such as ostracods and dipteran larvae. although other australian atherinid species have been found to consume some detrital matter, they typically rely more heavily on invertebrate prey and are best described as omnivores (prince et al. 1982; humphries & potter 1993). omnivorous diets have also been reported for other atherinid species (including crater- ocephalus spp.) from around the world (e.g. hildeb- rand & schroeder 1927; ivantsoff & glover 1974; bahamondes et al. 1979; llewellyn 1979; prince et al. 1982; azevedo-bemvenuti 1990). the fact that these ﬁsh occur in a drought susceptible region where abundances of ‘fodder’ invertebrates are likely to ﬂuctuate greatly, probably necessitated diversiﬁcation of the diet to include alternative sources of nutrition such as detritus and plant matter. thus, development of an intestinal tract longer in length and capable of assimilating nutrients from a broader range of food items would have offered a tremendous selective advantage for c. cuneiceps in such a marginal and unpredictable environment. the fact that their primary nutritional source (i.e., detritus) is available in prac- tically unlimited supply, together with reproductive strategies such as serial and protracted spawning, appear to have lead to the numerical dominance of c. cuneiceps in the murchison river. conservation issues and threats in particular, to the species. the loss or degradation of habitats and competition/ predation by introduced ﬁshes potentially pose a great threat land clearing associated with broad-acre agriculture is likely to result in increased salinity, possibly leading to local extinctions. such a situation is already evident in the southern parts of its range (e.g. greenough, hutt and murchison rivers), and also throughout numerous inland aquatic habitats in both south-western and south-eastern australia (beresford et al. 2001; morgan et al. 2003). the dramatic increase in salinity at the study site between may and september coincided with heavy rainfall in the agricultural area immediately surrounding the site and was a likely result of salt- laden runoff from the salt-affected lower catchment. further land clearing is likely to further exacerbate salinisation of the river. two introduced teleost species, namely the mos- quitoﬁsh (gambusia holbrooki girard (ex agassiz) 1859) and tilapia [oreochromis mossambicus (peters 1852)], were found to occur with c. cuneiceps in a number of rivers, and their presence poses a serious threat. gambusia holbrooki was captured with c. cuneiceps in the greenough and hutt rivers and was by far the more abundant of the two in the hutt river, but the roles were reversed in the greenough river. of the 21 sites sampled in the latter river during the study, these species were found together at only one site. these observations suggest that some degree of interspeciﬁc competition may be occurring. as g. holbrooki is essentially a carnivore (pen et al. 1993), is unlikely that dietary competition has resulted in the above observation. a more likely explanation is that c. cuneiceps has been excluded from sites in which g. holbrooki occurs because of the aggressive nature of this introduced species and the fact that both species attain a similar size and utilise the shallows as nursery and feeding grounds. gambusia holbrooki has been shown to prey on ﬁsh larvae and have deleterious impacts on ﬁn condition, reproductive success and survival rate of similar-sized australian ﬁsh species (howe et al. 1997; gill et al. 1999; aarn & ivantsoff 2001). it oreochromis mossambicus was found to occur with c. cuneiceps in the gascoyne river. feral populations of tilapia in western australian rivers (i.e., chapman, gascoyne, minilya and lyndon rivers) are thought to have become established from the deliberate or accidental release of aquarium specimens and/or escape from ornamental ponds (merrick & schmida 4 1984; blu¨hdorn et al. 1990; morgan & gill 2004 ). the species was ﬁrst recorded in the gascoyne river in 1981 (allen et al. 2002), where it is now widespread and very abundant (morgan & gill 2004). the relative murchison river hardyhead, distribution and biology abundance of c. cuneiceps in the gascoyne river is certainly much lower than in the nearby murchison river, a river that is free from introduced ﬁshes. this variation suggests a deleterious impact of o. mossam- bicus on the population of c. cuneiceps in the gascoyne system. such an impact may be the result of both the agonistic territorial behaviour that mature male o. mossambicus exhibit during the breeding season (turner 1986; h. gill personal observation), and the high degree of dietary overlap, i.e., tilapia is generally a detritivore but also ingests invertebrates (bruton & boltt 1975; maddern unpublished data from the gascoyne river). unfortunately, in the absence of data for the relative abundance of c. cuneiceps in the gascoyne river prior to the introduction of o. mossambicus, the presumed negat- ive impact of the introduced species cannot be conﬁrmed. the most robust population of c. cuneiceps occurs in the murchison river, where it is the most abundant freshwater teleost present (morgan & gill 2004). this river is devoid of introduced species, which is remarkable when it is considered that all nearby river systems are plagued by them. the range of o. mossambicus in western australia, where it was previously thought to only occur in the gascoyne river, has expanded considerably in the past 20 years to now include the lyndon, minilya and chapman rivers (morgan & gill 2004; morgan et al. 2004b). particularly worrying is the fact that this species is now present in rivers both north (i.e., in the gascoyne, minilya and lyndon rivers) and south (i.e., in the chapman river) of is important that every possible measure is taken to ensure that this river remains pest free. the murchison river. it resumen 1. craterocephalus cuneiceps es una especie ende´mica de las cuencas del oce´ano indico (i.e., pilbara) de australia occi- dental. se encuentra en los rı´os greenough, hutt, murchison, wooramel, gascoyne y degrey pero esta´ ausente en numerosos rı´os dentro de su a´rea de distribucio´ n. la explicacio´n ma´s probable para esta distribucio´n separada en la actualidad es que c. cuneiceps no ha habitado nunca los rı´os en los que esta ausente tales como los rı´os ashburton y fortescue. presentamos evidencia bio-geogra´ﬁca, geolo´gica y paleo-clima´tica para soportar esta hipo´tesis. 2. en el rı´o murchison, la reproduccio´n es extremadamente prolongada con reclutamiento a lo largo de todo el an˜o. los mayores machos y hembras capturados alcanzaron 96 mm lt (7.73 g) y 86 mm lt (5.57 g), respectivamente. la proporcio´ n de sexos fue 1.09 hembras: 1 macho. la fecundidad vario´ entre 46 y 454 (media 167.5 ± 25.7 se) y la longitudes a la que el 50 y el 95% de las hembras se reproducen por primera vez alcanzaron 36.4 y 44.3 mm lt, respectivamente. 3. c. cuneiceps es esencialmente detritı´voro pero tambie´n se alimenta de invertebrados acua´ticos. la lluvia sobre la cuenca 221 allen et al. del rı´o murchison es impredecible y el ph, la salinidad y la temperatura son variables. una dieta especializada, pequen˜o taman˜o, una edad joven en la madurez, y un perı´odo reproductivo prolongado, ademos de una freza seriada y alta fecundidad, permiten la dominancia nume´rica de la especie en ambientes competitivos, duros, a´ridos e impredecibles. acknowledgments study was this funded by the natural heritage trust, department of fisheries western australia, water and rivers commission of western australia and murdoch university. we thank the department of conservation and land management for providing access to the national parks of the pilbara region. thanks to stephen beatty, charlotte morgan, simon visser, david john, lynn gill, steven head and jamie jurjevich for help with the ﬁeld work. we also thank gerry allen for revising the manuscript. references 5 aarn & ivantsoff, w. 2001. predation on native ﬁshes by gambusia holbrooki in the orara river, new south wales. fishes of sahul 15: 726–732. allen, g.r. 1989. freshwater fishes of australia. neptune city: t.f.h. publications. 240 pp. allen, g.r., midgley, s.h. & allen, m. 2002. field guide to the freshwater fishes of australia. perth, australia: csiro/ western australian museum. 394 pp. azevedo-bemvenuti, m. 1990.
