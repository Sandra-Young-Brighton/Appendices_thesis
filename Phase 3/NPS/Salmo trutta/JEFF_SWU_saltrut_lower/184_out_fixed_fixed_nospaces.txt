feminella & matthews 1984; matthews 1987; matthews & robison 1988; brown 1989; smale & rabeni 1995a, b). however, conflicts exist between empirical data and predic- tions derived from evolutionary hypotheses about physiological adaptation. theory predicts that or- ganisms adapt to a milieu of local physical con- ditions (levins 1968; pianka 1988), yet some authors have suggested that physiological traits may be relatively static or variation may not necessarily be adaptive for limiting environmental factors (reviews in hertz et al. 1983; feminella & matthews 1984). although extensive research of north american stream fishes has focused on tol- erances to environmental stressors, the extent to which physiological and behavioral responses re- late to distributional ecology is often unclear and confounded by the complexity of interactions 84 among physicochemical conditions. temperature is one major physical factor that is especially integral to the distribution of aquatic ectotherms and has received substantial attention because it is amen- able to quantitative, testable hypotheses (mat- thews 1987). to address how intra- and interspecific physio- logical differences affect distributions or have been driven by selection for local environmental con- ditions, various authors have tested for adaptive tolerances of north american fishes across lati- tudinal or elevational gradients or among popula- tions inhabiting drastically different microhabitats (sumner & lanham 1942; brown & feldmeth 1971; otto 1973; ultsch et al. 1978; bulger & schultz 1982; matthews 1987; brown 1989; peterson 1993). particular attention has focused on taxa in relatively stable or benign habitats, having minimal physicochemical extremes and rates of change, versus those inhabiting fluctuating or harsh habitats, with potential exposure to tempor- ally variable, unpredictable, and maximal extremes of physicochemical stress. examples include studies of species living in headwater and intermit- tent streams versus those in large tributaries and main river channels, or species in springs and spring-fed tributaries versus those inhabiting more thermally variable stream habitats (otto & gerk- ing 1973; matthews & maness 1979; swaidner & berra 1979; hirshfield et al. 1980; feldmeth 1981; matthews & styron 1981; feminella & matthews 1984; kaya et al. 1992). most comparisons have concentrated on species assemblages of western and midwestern north american ecosystems, with very few physiological studies of the freshwater fish fauna in the southeastern united states. the gap in geographic coverage is especially pronounced given the heterogeneity of regional habitats and the phylogenetic diversity of southeastern fishes, including many upland forms and a number of species that obligately or facultatively exploit ther- mally stable spring environments. based on theoretical and empirical criteria, matthews (1987) hypothesized three basic patterns of tolerance (=ability to survive acute stress) and selectivity (=relative distributional breadth of a population in an environmental gradient) of fishes in stable versus fluctuating environments: type 1, fishes in fluctuating habitats with broad tolerance limits and low selectivity; type 2, fishes in fluctuat- ing habitats with narrower tolerance and greater selectivity resulting from evolutionary trade-offs for optimizing physiological performance, and; type 3, fishes in stable environments with narrow tolerance limits and low habitat selectivity, result- ing in diminished capacity for avoiding stressful conditions. sculpin thermal biology using comparative methods, we examined vari- ation in thermal tolerances and metabolic rates among sculpins (family cottidae) of the southeast- ern united states inhabiting stable (spring) or fluctuating (stream) habitats. the objectives were to determine whether there are significant physio- logical differences among populations of sculpins in habitats with contrasting thermal character- istics, and, if so, how these differences relate to geographic or local distributions. based on avail- able distributional and microhabitat information, we addressed the following questions: (1) are there significant intra- or interspecific differences in ther- mal tolerance or routine metabolism among the species and populations of sculpins studied? (2) if so, do species or populations occupying fluctuating habitats (streams) exhibit greater tolerance and higher metabolic variability than those inhabiting relatively constant (spring) habitats? (3) do species or populations from fluctuating environments cor- respond to matthews' (1 987) type 1 or 2 tolerance- selectivity patterns, and those in stable environ- ments correspond to the type 3 pattern? (4) are there significant differences in thermal tolerance and metabolism at different acclimation tempera- tures among the populations studied, and, if so, do any such differences follow a consistent pattern? species studied sculpins are among the most abundant freshwater fishes in many northern temperate lotic and lentic habitats, and they are important organisms of many aquatic communities. due in part to their cryptic morphology, sculpin identification is diffi- cult and many undescribed taxa and unresolved systematic problems exist (robins 1954; strauss 1980; jenkins & burkhead 1993). the family is most diverse and widespread at northern latitudes, but a few species occur below 35"n in eastern north america. sculpins in the central and eastern united states are distributed primarily in upland streams and rivers, broadly ranging from the oz- ark and ouachita highlands to the appalachian mountains. in the southeast there are wide rang- ing taxa and species with very limited distri- butions. all sculpins are confined to relatively cool- to cold-water habitats, and temperature may be one important determinant of distribution within a given drainage for at least some species (baltz et al. 1982; brown 1989). however, sym- patric species are often segregated locally by vari- ous demographic, ecological, or other physical microhabitat factors (finger 1982; matheson & brooks 1983; anderson 1985; daniels 1987; brown 1991; jenkins & burkhead 1993). five species were selected for this study: the 85 walsh et al. mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi girard); the talla- poosa sculpin (cottus tallapoosae williams & mayden j; the banded sculpin (cottus carolinae zopherus (jordan)); the ozark sculpin (cottus hyp- selurus robins & robison); and the pygmy sculpin (cottus pygmaeus williams). c. bairdi is one of the most widespread, disjunct, and geographically variable freshwater fishes of north america and consists of an unresolved complex of taxa (robins 1954; jenkins & burkhead 1993). c. tallapoosae is closely related to c. bairdi and is confined to the upper tallapoosa river drainage in alabama and georgia. c. carolinae is limited to the central and eastern united states, and, like c. bairdi, is morphologically variable and represents a species complex. members of both the c. bairdi and c. carolinae species groups typically inhabit cool, clear creeks, streams, and rivers in the eastern united states and also occur in cold springs and their effluents, and, rarely, in caves. in general, c. carolinae is considered to be more tolerant of warm riverine conditions, whereas c, bairdi is more frequently limited to cooler, high-gradient, montane habitats (robins 1954; jenkins & burk- head 1993). c. hypselurus is found in upland rivers, streams, and springs of the ozark highlands of ar- kansas and missouri (robins & robison 1985). in areas of sympatry, c. hypselurus is thought to pre- fer cooler waters than c. carolinae, but may be dis- placed from colder microhabitats by c. bairdi (robins & robison 1985: robison & buchanan 1988). c. pygmaeus is the smallest member of the family and has the most limited distribution, oc- curring within the valley and ridge physiographic province of alabama in a single spring and short effluent that varies in temperature less than 1°c annually (williams 1968). because of its limited distribution and small population size, c. pyg- rnaeus is considered threatened by the united states fish and wildlife service. phylogenetic relationships among sculpin spe- cies are not well understood. most authors recog- nize two distinct groups (bairdi and carolinae) in eastern north america, each containing several putatively related species (robins 1954; jenkins & burkhead 1993). however, there is weak evidence for monophyly of each of these species groups on the basis of morphometric, electrophoretic, and mitochondria1 dna data (strauss 1980, 1989; cla- baugh et al. in press). jenkins & burkhead (1993) chose to recognize these two species groups "as a working hypothesis for understanding sculpin bi- ology." c. pygmaeus and c. hypselurus have been placed in the bairdi species group since being rec- ognized as distinct species (williams 1968; robins & robison 1985). c. tallapoosae was rec- ognized as a subspecies of c. curolinae by robins 86 (1954), but is closely related to c. bairdi based on allozyme evidence (williams & mayden, in press), samples of c. bairdi used in this study were from a population inhabiting a relatively high gradient, semi-montane tributary of the etowah river. c. tallapoosae samples were from a medium-gradient stream. banded sculpins were from a spring in the conasauga river drainage, designated hereafter as c. curolinae-cs, and from a stream population in the coosawattee river drainage, designated as c. carolinae-cw. methods sculpins were studied from three stream and four spring localities (table 1). fish were collected by seine and transported live to the laboratory in in- sulated coolers that were aerated and maintained near the ambient water temperature of each collec- tion site. in the laboratory, fish were held in glass aquaria or large fiberglass tanks (57-570 liters) supplied with nonrecirculating, chilled well water, and exposed to a 12: 12 h photoperiod. groups of fish were quarantined initially and prophylactically treated for pathogens with dilute formalin (three treatments of 10 ppm every 2 days). fish were fed live california blackworms ad libitum every other day. groups of fish were acclimated to various ex- perimental temperatures by increasing water tem- perature 1.0"c * day-' in holding tanks, and held for a minimum of one week at the final acclimation temperature prior to tolerance or metabolic experi- ments. fish were held in captivity at stable tem- peratures for 2-72 weeks (most 6-24 weeks) to maximize acclimation to laboratory conditions (es- pecially at colder temperatures) and to minimize possible seasonal and prior temporal effects (hut- chison 1961). temperature temperature tolerance was measured by the critical thermal maximum (ct,n,,) method, using a 18°c h-' (0.3"c . min-l) as recommended by becker & genoway (1979). the ct,,, endpoint is usually recorded as the temperature at which an individual loses complete equilibrium (hutchison 1961 ; pala- din0 et al. 1980). we used the failure of a fish to immediately right itself when it rolled over or spas- modic flaring of the opercula as the ct,,, final endpoint, as kowalski et al. (1 978) found that scul- pins did not consistently undergo violent muscular spasms. ct,,, was measured by placing fish in 1- liter glass beakers with 500 ml of aquarium water at ambient acclimation temperature. beakers were immersed in a water bath consisting of a glass aquarium with 10 liters of water. the temperature of the bath was maintained with a programmable temperature controller (omega

the lighted por- tion of the acclimation photoperiod. limited samples allowed for metabolic compari- sons only between c. bairdi, c. carolinae-cs and c. pygmaeus. resting routine metabolic rates were measured in open flow-through respirometers (150 and 400 ml), constructed from cylinders of lucite plastic and similar in design to apparatus de- scribed by febry & lutz (1987). respirometry chambers were submerged in a 2 0 x 2 0 ~ 1 0 2 cm glass aquarium (with 22.4 liters of h20) serving as an external water bath. a separate aquarium (32x32x60 cm, with 37.5 liters of h20) was used as a water source for the respirometer chamber. water was circulated through the respirometer via aquarium tubing stoppered at each end and at- tached to an external, adjustable manostat minis- taltic@ pump. flow was measured with an in-line flowmeter and maintained within 2 2 ml * min-' in a range of 14-30 ml min-' during experiments. water in each aquarium was vigorously aerated and temperature was carefully controlled (k0. l°c) with programmable, circulating water baths. oxy- gen consumption was measured with a strathkel- vin instruments model 781@ oxygen meter con- nected to a microcomputer with automated data acquisition software (sable systems datacan*). the oxygen electrode was calibrated to saturation in a beaker of aerated water submerged in the water bath surrounding the chamber, and the metabolic rate was measured as the difference in oxygen partial pressure between the afferent and efferent sides of the chamber. individual fish had food withheld at least 24 h prior to to being placed in the respirometer. fish were then allowed to ad- just to the chamber for about 13-16 h prior to metabolic measurements, which were taken in a darkened, environmentally controlled room be- tween 0900 and 1400. mass-specific metabolic rates (expressed as mg o2 consumption . g - h-l) were determined using the following formula: vw" pw02(pw02aff- pwo2eff) m02= bw (i - min-')=flow where moz (mg 0 2 - g * h-')=oxygen consumption per unit body mass; vw rate through respiration chamber; pw02 (mg o2 . liters of h 2 0 . atm-')=capacitance coefficient of oxygen in water; pw02 (mmhg)=partial pressure of oxygen in water (afferent and efferent sides of chamber); bw (g)=wet mass of fish. 87 walsh et al. statistical analyses were performed with su- peranovas (version 1.1 1d) software on a mac- intosh@ computer. all analyses of variance (ano- va) were one-way tests using scheffe's s post hoc comparison (a=0.05). because of intra- and inter- specific variation in body mass, metabolic data were weight adjusted using the standard allometric relationship m02 = a(bw)b, where m 0 2 = meta- bolic rate (mg 0 2 ah-'), a=mass coefficient, bw= body mass (g), and b=mass exponent (fry 1971; cech 1990). we used a mass exponent of 0.67, a value that is empirically supportcd from a broad array of standard metabolic data on fishes (heusn- er 1982a, b; cech 1990). mass-independent meta- bolic rates were converted to mg o2 * kg-0.67 * h-l for statistical analyses and to facilitate compari- sons with published data for other species. we tested for unequal variances in anova compari- sons by visually examining plots of residuals versus fitted (uncorrelated) values of dependent variables (body mass or metabolic rate). in cases where vari- ance heterogeneity was suspected, data were log,, transformed and the analysis repeated. resu i ts temperature tolerance we observed qualitative interspecific differences in mortality of fish entered into temperature acclim- ations. in general, at acclimation temperatures above 20"c, fewer c. pygmaeus and c. bairdi sur- vived than fish from the other populations (limited samples of c. hypselurus precluded any compari- son of that species with the others at temperatures except 15°c). less than one-fourth of all c. pyg- rnaeus entered into a 25°c acclimation sequence survived to or beyond the minimum 1-week hold- ing period. during prolonged exposure to warmer temperatures, individuals of c. pygrnaeus were lethargic and reduced their feeding, suggesting that the higher mortality of this species was directly at- tributable to chronic elevated temperatures. heat stress during ct,,, trials elicited similar behavioral responses among all species. fish were initially calm or motionless. as the temperature approached to within about 3-5°c of the upper thermal limit, an individual typically became agi- tated, swam sporadically within the test beaker, and occasionally gasped deeply or broadly flared its opercula. spasmodic swimming often immedi- ately preceded loss of equilibrium, which was usually indicated when an individual rolled onto its side or back. mean ct,,, values among all acclimation tem- peratures differed significantly (p<0.05) within each species or population, except for c. bairdi at lo" and 15°c. in all cases, increased acclimation temperature resulted in higher ct,,, (table 2). body mass was not a significant covariate of ct,,, across all acclimation temperatures in c. pygmaeus, c. carolinae-cs or c. tallapoosae, and means were compared using anova. however, body mass was a significant covariate in c. bairdi and c. carolinae-cw, so mean ct,,, comparisons were made across acclimation temperatures using analysis of covariance (ancova). body-mass means of c. bairdi among acclimation groups were not significantly different. however, regression of mass on ct,,, of c. bairdi at each acclimation revealed a slight negative relationship, with smaller in contrast, the fish having higher relative ct,,,. covariance effect of mass on ct,,, of c. carolinae- cw across acclimations was probably due to a smaller overall size of fish in the 15°c group table 2. variation in

carolinae-cw, ancova re- sults indicate ct,,, values were significantly dif- ferent across all acclimations (i.e., regression lines of ct,,, on body mass had statistically equal slopes and unequal y-intercepts among acclim- ation groups). mean ct,,, values for c. pygmaeus acclimated to 10, 20 and 25°c and c. hypselurus acclimated to 15°c were significantly lower than samples of c. bairdi, c. tallapoosae and c. carolinae at corre- sponding acclimation temperatures (tables 2, 3). at 15"c, c. pygmaeus was not significantly differ- ent from either c. bairdi or c. tallapoosae, but both c. pygmaeus and c. hypselurus differed from the two samples of c. carolinae. mean ct,,, values across all acclimation temperatures ranged from 27.05"c for c. pygmaeus at a 10°c acclimation to 34.34"c for c. carolinae-cs at 25°c. relative values among samples of c. carolinae, c. bairdi, and c. tallapoosae at each acclimation were not significantly different (tables 2, 3). metabolic data adult pygmy sculpins are much smaller than other species of cottus, and thus metabolic rate com- parisons were confounded by differences in body mass and limited sample sizes at some acclim- ations. sizes of fish from combined temperature- acclimation groups (15, 20 and 25°c) for each spe- cies were (range, followed parenthetically by mean2se): c. bairdi, 2.34-6.54 g (4.15k0.21); c. carolinae-cs, 2.08-13.15 g (5.21 t0.60); c. pyg- maeus, 0.44-1.42 g (0.94k0.06). at each of the three acclimation temperatures and for all groups combined, c. bairdi and c. carolinae-cs did not differ significantly from each other in mass, but both differed significantly (anova, fy0.042) from c. pygmaeus. plots of residuals versus fitted (uncorrelated) values of body mass revealed some possible heterogeneity of variances within each temperature group and across combined samples. an anova on log,, transformed body mass con- firmed significant (p<o.oool) differences in body mass between c. pygmaeus and the other two species. there were highly despite moderate variation of mean body mass that 89 mlsh et al. within each species (table 4). there were no signifi- cant intraspecific body mass differences (pb0.072) among temperature acclimation groups. neverthe- less, ancova indicated that body mass was a sig- nificant covariate of log,,-transformed routine metabolic rates (mg o2 * h-l) across acclimation temperatures in c. pygmaeus, but not in c. bairdi or c. carolinae-cs. expected trends in oxygen con- sumption with increasing temperature were incon- sistent among all species. mean mass-adjusted metabolic rates were nonsignificant across all ac- climation temperatures in both c. bairdi (p=0.250) and c. carolinae-cs (p=0.069). c. pygmaeus had a very high metabolic rate at 15"c, followed by a sharp and dramatic decrease in oxygen consump- tion at higher temperatures. the differences in mean mass-independent metabolic rates of c. pygmaeus between 15°c and both 20 and 25°c was highly sig- nificant (p<o.ool), with mean values at the upper two temperatures not significantly different from one another (p=0.257). none of the species ex- hibited a significant increase in metabolic rate with increasing acclimation temperature as is generally expected among ectotherms. there was a highly significant (p=0.0008) inter- specific difference in mass-adjusted metabolism at 15"c, due to the much higher rate of c. pygmaeus relative to c. bairdi and c. carolinae-cs; the latter two species did not differ significantly between each other at this temperature (table 4). mean metabolic rates among all three species did not differ signifi- cantly at either 20°c (p=0.96) or 25°c (p=0.73). discussion results of this study provide mixed conclusions re- garding hypotheses addressed earlier. possible sea- sonal effects may have confounded our results, as discussed below. all species showed expected sig- nificant intraspecific differences in temperature tol- erance across acclimation temperatures. c. pyg- maeus at most acclimations and the spring-dwelling population of c. hypselurus differed interspeci- fically in temperature tolerance from c. bairdi, c. tallapoosae and c. carolinae. we found no signifi- cant differences in routine metabolism among samples of c. bairdi and c. carolinae at all tempera- ture acclimations, whereas c. pygmaeus at 15°c dif- fered from conspecifics at other temperature acclim- ations and interspecifically from both c. bairdi and c. carolinae-cs. based on these results, c. pyg- maeus and our sample of c. hypselurus have narrow- er tolerances and appear to conform to matthews' (1987) type 3 pattern of species in stable (spring) habitats, while c. bairdi, c. tallapoosae, and c. carolinae have broader tolerances and thus corre- spond to the type 1 or 2 pattern of species in fluc- 90 tuating (stream) habitats. however, information on the interrelationship of selectivity or avoidance of available thermal habitats, tolerance limits, and possible seasonal effects is needed to better eluci- date the role of physicochemical factors in regulat- ing distributions of these species. our results sug- gest that (1) the observed interspecific differences among the taxa studied may be consistent in part with a hypothesis that the physiological features have evolved as adaptive traits; and (2) these traits may be correlated with distributional differences among the taxa at different spatial scales, but vari- ation in thermal physiology does not explain such differences completely. relative survivorship during acclimation periods and mean ct,,, values among all samples indi- cated that c. pygmaeus and spring-dwelling c. hyp- selurus were significantly more stenother ma1 than c. bairdi, c. tallapoosae, and c. carolinae from the populations studied. overall survival of fish in each temperature acclimation group of c. carolinae was similar between fish from the two populations studied. in contrast, individuals of c. bairdi, repre- senting a population from a moderately high-elev- ation, semi-montane creek, had consistently greater mortality at chronic higher acclimation tempera- tures than the related c. tallapoosae taken from a lower-elevation stream in the tallapoosa river drainage. however, these two species did not differ significantly in ct,,,, thus yielding no evidence that the headwater form is more tolerant as has been found in some stream fishes (matthews & styron 1981). both streams from which c. bairdiand c. tal- lapoosae were collected may fluctuate similarly and be buffered from thermal extremes by seep drainage of upland areas. c. pygmaeus had significantly lower mean ct,,, values than the other species at all acclimation temperatures and also had much higher mortality rates during acclimation periods, especially at 25°c. thus, c. pygmaeus was the least tolerant of chronic elevated temperatures (>25"c) among the groups in our study, excluding c. hypsel- urus. based on our ct,, data, c. hypselurus from cold spring sites presumably would be as equally in- tolerant of chronic high temperatures as c. pyg- maeus. brown (1989) found similar interspecific dif- ferences and overall heavy mortality of freshwater sculpins (c. pitensis bailey & bond, c. klaman- thensis gilbert, and c. asperrimus rutter) from the pit river drainage of california at chronic acclim- ation temperatures of 27.5"c. c. hypselurus samples were from spring localities where little annual temperature variation probably occurs, but fish from these populations have easy access to adjacent stream reaches where water tem- peratures would be expected to fluctuate seasonally. our limited data suggest that ozark sculpins from the spring populations we sampled have narrower acute tolerance limits than other species (c. bairdi and c. carolinae) that occur in both spring and stream habitats. this observation is also supported by our finding that banded sculpins from a spring- fed creek (c. carolinae-cw) did not differ signifi- cantly in temperature tolerance from their stream- dwelling conspecifics. although there is no infor- mation available on movements of sculpins into or out of springs, our results suggest that at least some spring-inhabiting ozark sculpins may have reduced physiological tolerance that could be the result of long-term selection for stable, cool- or cold-water conditions. robins & robison (1985) reported that c. hypselurus occurs in a variety of habitats, but shows a preference for swift-flowing, rocky stream areas, and spring habitats with thick growths of submergent aquatic macrophytes. however, they also stated that in missouri, where both c. hypsel- urus and c. bairdi occur sympatrically, c. hypselurus is often found in deeper, warmer, and faster flowing areas. thus, although our results indicate possible temperature adaptation in spring-dwelling ozark sculpins, there may be other physical or biological factors involved in regulating the species' intrad- rainage and microhabitat distribution. the rank order of mean ct,, values for c. bairdi, c. tallapoosae, and c. carolinae samples at different acclimations may be somewhat indicative of relative tolerances to elevated temperatures, de- spite there being no statistically significant differ- ences among these taxa. in comparing only these species, there was no consistent pattern across all temperatures. however, it may be notable that c. bairdi had a lower ct,,, at 20°c and 25"c, and that samples of both c. bairdi and c. tallapoosae had lower means than the two c. carolinae samples at 15"c, and, especially, at 25°c. this potentially supports a general assertion that c. carolinae is more tolerant of warmer waters than members of the c. bairdi species group (jenkins & burkhead 1993), an assumption that is most often based on distributional information rather than on physio- logical or ecological data. however, this con- clusion should be tempered by noting that c. carolinae is often found in high densities in cold spring and cave habitats (jenkins & burkhead 1993), and possible intraspecific physiological vari- ation among populations inhabiting areas with dif- ferent thermal characteristics may constrain any general conclusions about inter specific differences. contrary to our prediction, samples of c. carolinae from spring and stream habitats ex- hibited no differences in temperature tolerance. we expected that c. carolinae-cw fish from a small spring-fed stream (crane eater creek) would have lower tolerances than c. carolinae-cs fish. which sculpin thermal biology were from a somewhat larger stream with no obvi- ous spring inflow. the main stream boil contribu- ting inflow to crane eater creek is relatively large (5.7-14.1x lo6 1 - day-'; cressler 1974). callahan (1958) reported a late october temperature of 15.6"c for the spring that was very close to the temperature (15.0"c) we measured in april 1993. the spring originates in an area where relatively deep subsurface waters drain upland regions to nearby streams through the knox and conasauga formations of middle and late cambrian age (cressler 1974). presumably, these geological and hydrological conditions mitigate fluctuations in annual water temperatures within crane eater creek. thus, the c. carolinae-cw population showed no evidence of a diminished capacity for compensatory acclimitization or directional selec- tion for reduced temperature tolerance despite liv- ing in this putatively stable spring environment. the metabolic responses of the three species studied here were unexpected and discordant with previously published data. mass-corrected and raw values of oxygen consumption were in the approxi- mate range reported for other cottids and many cool water temperate species (brett & groves 1979; brown 1989). the nonsignificant effect of tempera- ture on mass-independent metabolic rates, however, was not consistent with general patterns found in most fishes (precht 1958; fry 1971; brett & groves 1979). metabolic rates measured in this study were con- sidered to be routine (fry 1957), where fish were quiescent but capable of spontaneous activity. rou- tine metabolic rates are most likely to be exhibited by sedentary sculpins in the wild, but measures of routine metabolism are highly influenced by activ- ity. laboratory observations of fish in acclimation tanks indicated that c. pygmaeus and c. carolinae were most active diurnally, while c. bairdi and c. tallapoosae were most active nocturnally. c. pyg- maeus exhibited decreased activity at elevated tem- peratures (>20"c) in holding tanks. we were unable to observe sculpins in the respirometers, but meta- bolic measurements at some temperatures may have been influenced by spontaneous activity. thus, our results may possibly indicate a metabolic response to altered temperature that combined both intrinsic physiological and behavioral components. both c. bairdi and c. carolinae-cs exhibited tem- perature compensation (temperature-independent metabolism) in the 15-20°c acclimation range, fol- lowed by an apparent but statistically nonsignificant increase in metabolic rate from 20-25°c. brown (1989) found areas of thermal compensation within a temperature range of 10°c to 15°c for three spe- cies of sculpins in california, but in each of those species the metabolic rates increased significantly 91 wsh et al. from 15°c to 20°c before exhibiting another area of compensation from 20°c to 25°c. the decline in metabolic rate from 15°c to 20°c by c. bairdi was similar to a decline from 10-1 5°c in rough (c. asper- rimus) and marbled (c. klumuthensis) sculpins re- corded by brown (1989), who suggested that metab- olism of the latter two species might be most ef- ficient at the lower temperature. observed declines in metabolic rate with elevated temperature and the temperature compensation zones in this study and brown’s (1989) are in contrast to the results of baltz et al. (1982), who found that metabolism of riffle sculpin (c. gulosus (girard)) increased steadily with temperature. small sample sizes in this study and variable activity patterns may explain some of the above differences, but both c. bairdi and c. carolin- ae-cs exhibited nearly complete temperature inde- pendence in metabolic rate over the entire range from 15°c to 25°c. hence, our combined tempera- ture tolerance and metabolic data suggest that mottled and banded sculpins are moderately eury- thermal and apparently less temperature sensitive than rough and marbled sculpins studied by brown (1 989). c. pygmaeus also showed temperature indepen- dence in metabolism from 20°c to 25°c and ex- hibited a decrease in metabolism between 15°c and 20°c. unlike c. bairdi, however, the decline in meta- bolic rate of c. pygmaeus was large and statistically significant. greater activity of pygmy sculpins at lower temperatures could account for these results. however, as discussed by brown (1 989) for rough, marbled, and mottled sculpins, it also seems likely that metabolism of pygmy sculpins may be most ef- ficient at lower temperatures, especially those ap- proximating that of their spring habitat (17°c). the underlying mechanisms of thermal compensation in coldwater fishes is inadequately understood (dav- enport & sayer 1993), and the possibility that greatly elevated temperatures may cause metabolic depression in some sculpins merits further study (brown 1989). our methods did not address temporal variability in either thermal tolerance or routine metabolism, and it is likely that seasonal effects may have masked possible physiological differences among some of the taxa studied. various authors have found significant seasonal changes in physiological traits of fishes, including temperature tolerance and oxygen consumption (dickson & kramer 1971; ho- kanson 1977; kowalski et al. 1978; evans 1984; hlohowskyj & wissing 1985; facey & grossman 1990). moreover, results of many studies are often not directly comparable due to differences in meth- odology and complex interactions of proximate en- vironmental cues (evans 1984; ingersoll & claussen 1984; hlohowskyj & wissing 1985). most evidence 92 the suggests that modulation of endogenous circannual cycles of temperature-independent metabolic pro- cesses occurs primarily through stimuli received via photoperiod cycles (evans 1984). we feel that long acclimation periods under symmetrical photocycle used in this study should have mini- mized the confounding effects of seasonal changes in temperature tolerance and routine metabolism. kowalski et al. (1978) did not find any seasonal vari- ation in ct,,, of c. bairdi acclimated in the labora- tory for four weeks at a 12:12 h photoperiod. how- ever, facey & grossman (1990) found significant seasonal variation in standard metabolic rates of c. bairdi, naturally acclimatized and held under simi- lar conditions in the laboratory, and attributed tem- poral differences temperature-independent changes in reproductive condition. future studies of sculpin incorporate methods designed to more fully evaluate seasonal effects on physiological processes. thermal ecology should to paradoxical information exists regarding adap- tive intra- and interspecific variation in thermal tol- erance among fishes and other ectotherms (hirsh- field et al. 1980; hertz et al. 1983; feminella & mat- thews 1984). based on our limited data, at least some populations of the c. bairdi and c. carolinae species groups are physiologically labile. under en- vironmentally stable conditions, such as the spring study site inhabited by c. carolinae-cw, our results provide no evidence of directive selection in re- sponse to steady thermal conditions. in contrast, c. pygmaeus and, possibly, some spring populations of c. hypselurus appear to have diminished physiologi- cal capacity resulting from constant thermal con- ditions, as has been found in a number of other spe- cies (feder 1978; hirshfield et al. 1980; feminella & matthews 1984). for c.pygmaeus these results were not unexpected, given the presumed long history of postglacial genetic isolation and relatively stable thermal environment of this species (williams 1968). however, our results do not support common assumptions that temperature alone may be the pri- mary factor accounting for general distribution pat- terns of banded, mottled, or ozark sculpins. bio- logical factors are integral in regulating sculpin populations (baltz et al. 1982; matheson & brooks 1983; daniels 1987), whereas physical factors other than temperature may also play a role, such as sub- strate, available shelter, gradient, or water velocity (becker 1983; matheson & brooks 1983; facey & grossman 1992). macro- and micro-scale distri- butions of sculpins in streams and springs of the eastern united states, especially in areas of sympa- try, are undoubtedly the result of complex interrac- tions of physical and biological factors that warrant further investigation. a very limited distribution and evidence that c. pygmaeus is relatively more stenothermal than other taxa warrants consideration in conservation of this species, and other sculpin populations with simi- larly restricted distributions in cold-water habitats. personnel of the alabama department of conser- vation and natural resources and the u.s. fish and wildlife service (r. larson, personal communi- cation) have proposed introducing c. pygmaeus to nearby springs, as a means of safeguarding the spe- cies by establishing refugial populations. such ef- forts should first include a thorough evaluation of thermal characteristics of targeted springs, and pre- vention of land-use activities that might potentially alter hydrological conditions required by c. pyg- maeus. 1.
