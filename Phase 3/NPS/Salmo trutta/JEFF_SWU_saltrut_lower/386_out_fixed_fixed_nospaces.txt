however, there was no subsequent effect on recruitment of young in this or in the other two experiments. despite individual-level effects in short-term experiments, repeated exposure to alarm substances over a season had no measureable impact at the population scale. key words: alarm substances; fathead minnow; pimephales promelas; pond experiments; recruitment; reproductive behaviour introduction prey species have evolved a variety of methods to reduce the risk of predation, including changes to behaviour, morphology, physiology, and life history (fuiman & magurran 1994; kats & dill 1998). these indirect effects of predation, although nonlethal, can be as important as direct effects as they typically occur chronically and can have impacts at the population level (lima 1998; peacor & werner 2001). changes to behaviour can be elicited by alarm signals from conspeciﬁcs and heterospeciﬁcs even in the absence of predators (kats & dill 1998). chemical signals are particularly important in aquatic environments, where chemicals are easily transmitted and vision is often limiting (bro¨nmark & hansson 2000; wisenden 2000). alarm substances are chemical cues that are stored in the epidermis of many ﬁsh species and released only upon injury (pfeiffer 1963). the presence of alarm substances in the environment can function as an alarm signal, indicating an increase in predation risk. short-term laboratory studies consistently report strong anti-predatory behavioural responses from a variety of ﬁsh species in response to alarm substances (chivers & smith 1998). common responses include ﬂeeing from the area, changes to activity schedules, decreased movement, increased vigilance, and shel- tering (smith 1992). although these induced behav- iours can reduce the immediate risk of predation and thereby increase short-term survival, they require time and energy that could otherwise be devoted to foraging or reproduction. reduced foraging behaviours in laboratory studies because of the presence of alarm substances can persist for several days after a single exposure and consequently reduce growth and body condition (ficke 1987; chivers & smith 1998; jachner & janecki 1999). such responses to increased preda- tion risk may prevent individuals from acquiring sufﬁcient energy resources needed to survive and reproduce, particularly in regions like northern alberta that experience long, harsh winters and short breeding and growing seasons (danylchuk & tonn 2001, 2006; divino & tonn 2007). reproductive behaviours, such as guarding territo- ries, ﬁnding mates and caring for young, can be risky and may be compromised in a high-risk environment correspondence: w. m. tonn, department of biological sciences, university of alberta, edmonton, alberta t6g 2e9, canada. e-mail: bill.tonn@ualberta.ca 220 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00481.x (lima & dill 1990; jones & paszkowski 1997a; steinhart et al. 2008). reproductive strategies can also change in response to predation risk. for example, females may become less choosy, employ mate copying more often or choose to lay eggs in sheltered nesting sites (wisenden 1993; briggs et al. 1996). exposure to alarm signals have resulted in earlier breeding, shortened gestation time, decreased brood intervals and increased brood sizes in laboratory experiments (lima & dill 1990; magnhagen 1991; dzikowski et al. 2004; evans et al. 2007). earlier reproduction could, in turn, extend the growing season for the offspring, potentially increasing their end- of-summer size and subsequent overwinter survival (grant & tonn 2002; divino & tonn 2007). reduced growth, survival and reproduction can have detrimental demographic effects (danylchuk & tonn 2003). however, most research on alarm substances in ﬁsh has focused on short-term responses of individuals, typically measured on the scale of minutes or hours, conducted in small-scale laboratory experiments. however, such short-term responses by individuals to alarm substances may not transfer to the natural environment (magurran et al. 1996; wisenden et al. 2004) or scale up to the population level with meaningful demographic effects. to better understand the potential population-level consequences of alarm substances, we designed a set of pond- and mesocosm-scale experiments to deter- mine if exposure to alarm substances will reduce reproduction and recruitment of ﬁsh populations over an entire summer breeding season. fathead minnow (pimephales promelas) was used as a model species to assess the effects of alarm substances on reproductive effort of adults, and recruitment and growth of young- of-year (yoy). based on the laboratory behavioural studies discussed earlier, many of which were con- ducted on fathead minnow, we expected that exposure to alarm substances would (i) decrease body condition and survival of breeding ﬁsh, (ii) reduce male breeding and nesting behaviours, (iii) accelerate the spawning season, but reduce its duration, and ultimately (iv) result in fewer, but larger, yoy recruiting into the population. methods study organism fathead minnow ranges over much of north america and is commonly found in small lakes of boreal alberta (nelson & paetz 1992). as with other cyprinids, the epidermis contains club cells, which are the proposed storage location of alarm substances (pfeiffer laboratory-based behavioural studies, fathead minnows are well docu- numerous 1963). in limited effects of alarm substances mented to respond to alarm substances by increasing schooling and sheltering, decreasing movement and ﬂeeing from the area (e.g., smith 1992; chivers & smith 1998). in june, when mean temperatures the spawning season in northern alberta typically begins reach approximately 15 °c, and extends through to august (danylchuck & tonn 2006). males normally establish breeding territories under submerged or ﬂoating objects such as logs, rocks or lily pads, but will readily accept artiﬁcial surfaces (nelson & paetz 1992). male fathead minnows court females to lay eggs in their nesting territory, and will actively guard and care for the eggs in their nest until hatching (mcmillan 1972; jones & paszkowski 1997a). experimental design volume = 2.65 m3). we conducted three population-level experiments at the university of alberta’s meanook biological re- search station (mbrs; 54°37¢n, 113 °35¢w), where successful protocols to quantify reproduction and recruitment in populations of fathead minnow has previously been established (e.g., grant & tonn 2002; divino & tonn 2007). two pond experiments were conducted in 2007 and 2008, using four and six constructed ponds (width · length  10 · 25 m, volume  110 m3), respectively. the 2008 mesocosm experiment was conducted using 10 cattle troughs (diameter = 2.55 m, cattle troughs were provided with 5 cm of silty sand substrate and ﬁlled with pond water. water was not added during the experiments; however, both the ponds and cattle troughs were open to the environment and would have received rain water to compensate for evaporative loss. prior to stocking ponds and cattle troughs, existing potential nesting substrate (woody debris and aquatic vegetation) was removed and replaced with ﬂoating artiﬁcial nesting surfaces to facilitate reproductive monitoring. these nesting surfaces consisted of fence boards (55 · 14 · 2 cm) covered in black tarpaulin and anchored at the ends with bricks and approxi- mately 0.5 m of twine. twenty nest boards were placed along the perimeter of each pond and three were added to each cattle trough. fathead minnows were collected with minnow traps in late-may from rochester lake (ca. 35 km se of mbrs), transported to mbrs, housed temporarily in large (approximately 1500 l) outdoor tanks and main- tained on ﬁsh ﬂakes. fish were sorted into three life- history categories: mature females, mature males, and juveniles (deﬁned as ﬁsh lacking distinguishable secondary sexual characteristics; danylchuk & tonn 2001). females, males and juveniles were divided by length into two or three 3-mm size classes. total )1 clove oil) ﬁsh were batch anaesthetised (30 mg l 221 jung & tonn marked based on size and life-history category by subcutaneous injection with acrylic paint for later identiﬁcation when monitoring reproduction and growth (unger 1983; danylchuk & tonn 2001). ponds were stocked on june 8 in 2007 and june 13 in 2008 with equal proportions of females, males, and juveniles at a total density of approximately 1 )3. five females and ﬁve males were individ- ﬁsh m ually marked and stocked into each cattle trough on )3. june 23, 2008, resulting in a density of 3.8 ﬁsh m both densities are within the natural range observed in boreal alberta lakes (danylchuk & tonn 2003). minnows were not fed during the experiments, but relied on food present in and colonising the ponds and cattle troughs. treatments in all three experiments, alarm substances were added as a chemical cue to signal an increase in predation risk. alarm substances were derived by homogenising fathead minnow skin, following the methods of ferrari & chivers (2006). donor fathead minnows were euthanised by a blow to the head and ⁄ or decapitation. skin ﬁlets were removed from both sides and homogenised using a tissue grinder to release alarm substances. only skins from female and juvenile ﬁsh were used, as males do not produce alarm substances during the breeding season (smith 1976). quantifying alarm substances is imprecise because their chemical identity is unknown (e.g., brown et al. 2003; carreau-green et al. 2008). behavioural exper- iments commonly quantify concentrations as the area of skin extract (centimetre square) per volume of water; however, there is no standard concentration applied in behavioural assays. concentrations used in the literature range from 1 cm2: 25 l to 1 cm2: 1,776,000 l, with concentrations up to 1 cm2: 296,000 l consistently eliciting anti-predatory behav- iour in fathead minnow (ferrari et al. 2005, 2006; ferrari & chivers 2006). during preliminary trials using minnows from rochester lake, freezing and sheltering behaviours were observed at concentrations as low as 1 cm2: 40,000 l (j.a. jung, unpublished data). based on literature values, preliminary trials, and the use of logistically feasible numbers of donor ﬁsh, we used average concentrations of 1 cm2: 20,000 l in 2008 (ponds and troughs). in 2007 (ponds) and 1 cm2: 10,000 l ponds were assigned to alarm substances or control treatment. alarm substances were added every fourth day in 2007. based on results from 2007 and the development of more efﬁcient protocols, we were able to increase the treatment regime in 2008, and added alarm substances every second day. doses were prepared in advance and frozen until needed (e.g., 222 smith 1992). each dose of alarm substances was thawed and mixed into approximately 15 l of pond water. an equal volume of pond water was added to control ponds. in 2007, doses were added from a boat along a transect down the middle of the pond. in 2008, doses were divided into 20 portions and added between nesting boards from shore. cattle troughs were randomly assigned to alarm substances or control treatment. alarm substances or water were added every second day. doses were frozen into 4.5-l aliquots until needed and were added by suspending the frozen blocks above the cattle troughs and allowing the blocks to melt into the troughs, approximate a 6–16-h period depending on the weather conditions. a black bucket was placed on top of the frozen blocks to protect against photo- degradation (ferrari et al. 2008). data collection stage was nest boards were monitored every second day in 2007 and every day in 2008. average start date of the nests and number of nests established in the troughs and ponds were calculated from the date eggs appeared in each nest. eggs were counted to determine the size of each nest and total productivity. the number of times new eggs appeared at a nest determined the number of egg batches acquired per nest. to determine the percentage of eggs successfully hatching, develop- mental recorded at each observation following vandenbos et al. (2006). fathead minnow eggs progress through three distinguishable develop- mental stages: clear, black eye and gold eye. eggs disappearing prior to reaching the third stage were recorded as predated and those disappearing after reaching the gold-eyed stage were recorded as successfully hatched. evidence of fungal infection was quantiﬁed as percentage of nests per trough or pond showing evidence of infection. we deﬁned nest failure as a nest with no eggs surviving to hatching (divino & tonn 2008). we calculated spawning season as the number of days between the laying of the ﬁrst and last egg for each pond or cattle trough, peak date was the day with the highest number of eggs present, and end date was the last day new eggs were laid per cattle trough or pond. while monitoring nests, we recorded characteristics of nest-guarding males by adapting protocols from divino & tonn (2008). the percentage present was calculated from the number of times a male was present during nest-monitoring periods divided by the total number of observations made over the course of his nest. we deﬁned guarding levels as 0 (male not present at nest), 1 (male present but ﬂed on approach), 2 (passively guarding: male neither ﬂed nor was aggressive), and 3 (actively guarding: male head butted, nipped, or otherwise attempted to repel the observer from the nesting site). maximum parental care was the highest recorded level of guarding observed for each male. we terminated experiments when no nests were present for ten consecutive days. fish were removed to determine recruitment, growth and survival. we set minnow traps in the ponds for three consecutive days to remove the majority of stocked ﬁsh. ponds were then drained to approximately 30 cm in depth, and remaining ﬁsh were removed by repeated seining until three consecutive passes captured less than ﬁve ﬁsh. the cattle troughs were drained to approximately 10 cm depth, and ﬁsh were removed by dip netting until no ﬁsh were seen by two observers. fish were euthanised with clove oil and frozen for later process- ing. we counted, weighed and measured (tl) stocked ﬁsh prior to stocking and again at the end of the summer to determine changes in body condition )3) · 100) and survival. (k = (mass (g) length (cm) because of a data recording error, separate measure- ments of body condition and survival for males, females and juveniles were not available from the 2008 ponds. in addition, gonadosomatic index (gsi = (gonad mass )1) · 100) was measured in the (g) total body mass (g) 2008 pond experiment on a sample of females in june (n = 16 per pond), july (n = 6) and august (n = 6). we counted all yoy from the ponds and cattle troughs to determine ﬁrst-summer recruitment. mass and total length were measured for all yoy from the cattle troughs and for a sub-sample (approximately 500) from the ponds to determine mean length and total biomass. analyses data from each pond and cattle trough experiment were analysed separately for effects of alarm sub- stances on several reproductive and recruitment parameters. we analysed comparisons among treat- ments at the pond or cattle trough level with welch’s t-tests for length of spawning season, peak and end dates, number of nests, total production of eggs, percentage of infected and failed nests, percentage of eggs hatched, change in body condition, and survival of stocked ﬁsh, and length, biomass and total recruit- ment of yoy. square root, log or arcsin-square root transformations were applied to data prior to analysis, as appropriate. we analysed female gsi and egg production rates at the pond or cattle trough level using repeated-measures anova. parameters that were affected by localised differences at the nest level were analysed using nested anovas, with nests nested within pond or cattle trough, using a satt- erthwaite subgroups. these parameters included average start date, number of egg batches, average nest size, observed male approximation for unequal limited effects of alarm substances presence and maximum parental care. signiﬁcance level was set at p £ 0.05. statistical analyses were performed using s-plus 8.0 (insightful corp., seattle, wa, usa). results female reproductive investment eggs began appearing on nest boards 1–4 days after ponds were stocked and 5–20 days after cattle troughs were stocked. no eggs were produced in two cattle troughs (one of each treatment), which have been excluded from the relevant analyses. the timing and rate of egg production was similar between the alarm substances and control treatments in the pond exper- iments (repeated measures anovas: 2007 f1,2 = 0.05, p = 0.84; 2008 f1,4 = 0.10, p = 0.76; fig. 1a,b). in contrast, most eggs were laid earlier in the spawning season in the alarm substances treatment relative to the water control in the cattle trough experiment (repeated measures anova (treatment · time): f39,39 = 2.60, p < 0.001; fig. 1c). treatments did not differ in the duration of the spawning season in either the 2007 or 2008 pond experiments (p ‡ 0.25; table 1). peak date (p ‡ 0.50) and end date (p ‡ 0.12) were also unaffected by the addition of alarm substances in either pond experiment (table 1). similarly, exposure to alarm substances had no effect on the spawning season duration (p = 0.12), peak date (p = 0.29) or end date (p = 0.23) in the cattle trough experiment, although end date was 11 days earlier in the alarm substances treatment than the water control (table 1). female gsi did not differ between treatments in the 2008 pond experiment (repeated-measures anova: f1,4 = 2.86, p = 0.17; fig. 2), nor were there differ- ences in total egg production between treatments in either pond experiment (p ‡ 0.73; table 1). despite different temporal distributions of egg production in the cattle trough experiment, treatments were similar in overall production of eggs per female (p = 0.41; table 1). there was no difference in the change in body condition or survivorship of females between treatments in the 2007 pond experiment or the cattle trough experiment (p ‡ 0.23; table 2). females were not analysed separately for the 2008 pond experiment; there were no differences in the pooled however, (female, male, juvenile) change in condition or survival for stocked ﬁsh (p ‡ 0.48; table 2). male reproductive investment exposure to alarm substances had no measurable effect on the courtship performance of males. starting date of nests ranged widely, from 1 to 39 days 223 jung & tonn (a) (b) (c) fig. 2. comparison of female gonadosomatic index (gsi = (gonad )1) · 100);

table 3). similarly, alarm substance and control treatments did not differ in either number of nests per male (p ‡ 0.76) or number of egg batches (p ‡ 0.14; table 3). as a consequence, per nest exposure to alarm substances had no effect on the total number of eggs per nest in any of the experiments (p ‡ 0.25;

table 3). males exposed to alarm substances also showed similar levels of guarding behaviour to those in the water control (p ‡ 0.46). male body condition was reduced by 15% in the 2007 pond and 28% in the cattle trough experiment, but was independent of exposure to alarm substances in either. there was a 66% male mortality table 1. metrics of female reproductive activity for fathead minnow populations stocked in ponds and cattle troughs exposed to alarm substances or water as a control. spawning season (days) peak date (days poststocking) end date (days post-stocking) total production (eggs ⁄ female) experiment 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs control 26.5 ± 0.5 28.0 ± 6.6 13.5 ± 3.0 22 ± 2 12 ± 2 14 ± 4 31 ± 3 31 ± 6 24 ± 5 1,993 ± 304 2,613 ± 179 571 ± 182 alarm substances statistical test 39.5 ± 5.5 32.3 ± 8.0 7.3 ± 1.3 23 ± 1 12 ± 2 9 ± 1 45 ± 5 35 ± 7 13 ± 1 2,159 ± 294 2,616 ± 427 405 ± 174 t1.02 = )2.35 t3.85 = )0.43 t4.14 = )1.93 t1.74 = )0.83 t4.00 = )0.27 t3.41 = )1.26 t2.00 = )2.83 t3.80 = )0.34 t4.38 = )1.40 t2.00 = )0.39 t2.68 = )0.01 t5.71 = )0.88 spawning season is deﬁned as the duration of time which eggs were laid. peak date is the day with the greatest number of new eggs laid, and end date is the last day new eggs appeared. data are averaged across ponds and cattle troughs in each treatment and given as mean ± se, followed by welch’s t-statistic. none of the metrics differed between treatments (p > 0.10;

2008, p = 0.74; table 3). conversely, the percentage of nests failing to pro- duce any live young was lower overall in 2008 than 2007, but neither nest failure (p ‡ 0.59) nor hatching success (p ‡ 0.28) were affected by alarm substances (table 3). in the cattle trough experiment, no nests showed signs of infection, although two nests exposed to alarm substances failed to hatch young (% failed, p = 0.19; table 3). hatching rates in the cattle troughs were comparable to those observed in the pond experiments; overall hatching success of eggs was not affected by exposure to alarm substances in the troughs (p = 0.89; table 3). the quantity and quality of the yoy surviving to the end of the summer was not affected by exposure to alarm substances. there was no difference between treatments in the number of yoy recruited to the end of the summer in either pond experiment or in the cattle trough experiment (p ‡ 0.63; table 2). like- wise, in none of the experiments did exposure to alarm substances have an effect on the yoy length (p ‡ 0.26) or total biomass of young produced (p ‡ 0.31; table 2). discussion prey ﬁshes respond to alarm substances in laboratory experiments with strong anti-predatory behaviours, including reduced feeding, growth and earlier repro- duction (lawrence & smith 1989; chivers & smith 1998; jachner & janecki 1999; pollock et al. 2005). in nature, similar responses to repeated exposure to alarm substances throughout the summer growing and breeding season could have population-level conse- quences on reproduction and recruitment. however, with a few minor exceptions, population-level effects 225 jung & tonn table 3. measures of male reproductive effort and nest success from fathead minnow populations stocked into experimental ponds and cattle troughs exposed to alarm substance and water (control). experiment control alarm substance statistical tests courting no. of nests ⁄ male average starting date (days poststocking) no. of egg batches ⁄ nest average nest size (no. of eggs) male nest defence percent of observations present max parental care nest success percent of infected percent of hatched percent of failed 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 2007 ponds 2008 ponds cattle troughs 0.93 ± 0.08 0.69 ± 0.01 0.32 ± 0.08 12 ± 1 9 ± 0.5 14 ± 3 2.4 ± 0.1 4.2 ± 0.3 4.9 ± 0.9 2,138 ± 166 2,907 ± 260 1,783 ± 380 59.2 ± 3.0 26.0 ± 2.5 49.0 ± 10.2 2.0 ± 0.1 1.7 ± 0.1 1.8 ± 0.3 2 ± 1 36 ± 20 0 58 ± 6 77 ± 3 63 ± 13 32 ± 18 9 ± 3 0 0.93 ± 0.02 0.73 ± 0.12 0.32 ± 0.08 15 ± 1 12 ± 1 6 ± 1 2.2 ± 0.1 3.5 ± 0.3 2.6 ± 0.5 2,317 ± 171 1,793 ± 220 1,276 ± 306 56.1 ± 2.9 33.7 ± 2.9 35.6 ± 12.3 2.0 ± 0.1 1.5 ± 0.1 1.3 ± 0.4 14 ± 1 44 ± 15 0 46 ± 2 77 ± 2 67 ± 22 36 ± 7 12 ± 5 21 ± 13 t1.11 = 0.05 t2.03 = )0.35 t6.00 = 0.00 f1,2.00 = 0.31 f1,3.95 = 0.98 f1,4.00 = 4.42 f1,2.00 = 0.09 f1,3.83 = 3.82 f1,5.00 = 3.29 f1,2.00 = 0.11 f1,4.00 = 0.13 f1,2.00 = 2.60 f1,1.99 = 1.06 f1,3.93 = 0.57 f1,6.00 = 0.75 f1,1.99 = 1.28 f1,3.91 = 0.19 f1,6.00 = 0.54 t1.51 = )8.83* t3.70 = )0.35 n ⁄ a t1.26 = 1.84 t3.17 = )0.22 t4.98 = 0.15 t1.34 = )0.20 t2.84 = )0.61 t3.00 = 1.67 batch is deﬁned as a new group of eggs added to a nest. the % of observations present is the percentage of daily nest observations that a male was present at his nest. maximum parental care is the highest recorded level of guarding (0 absent, 1 ﬂed, 2 passive and 3 active;

(2005) who observed no change in egg production when convict cichlids were exposed to alarm substances. this contrasts with mammalian females, who generally suppress reproduction when the risk of predation is increased (fuelling & halle 2004; creel et al. 2007). reduced foraging is often the underlying cause of reproductive suppression. however, alarm substances did not appear to limit foraging of fathead minnows in our the latter 226 experiments, as the average body condition and survival of both females and males did not differ between treatments. similarly, alarm substances did not affect the average date of nest establishment. however, egg- laying in the cattle trough experiment was concen- trated earlier in the breeding season when fathead minnows were exposed to alarm substances. greater synchrony of eggs at the population-level may provide better protection for young by swamping predators (ims 1990). in addition, females would be gravid for a shorter period of time, potentially decreasing their own risk of predation (sih 1994). earlier reproduction did not, however, result in differences in the quality or quantity of yoy between treatments. furthermore, the pattern of early, more synchronous reproduction was not observed in the pond experiments, so one must be cautious not to over-interpret this result. the increased size and more complex habitat structure in the ponds troughs) likely provided a safer, (vs. less risky environment, e.g., by reducing visibility and providing structural refuges. in addition, given the larger abso- lute number of ﬁsh in the ponds, females would have been able to form larger schools, which may have provided a measure of security against predation when foraging and searching for potential mates (wisenden et al. 2003; pollock et al. 2006). male reproductive investment in laboratory experiments, exposure to alarm sub- stances increased nest abandonment and shelter time by male fathead minnows (jones & paszkowski 1997a). however, in our population-level experiments, male behaviours were unchanged when exposed to alarm substances. males that are better able to maintain a good nesting territory and court females will have greater reproductive success, but likely incur higher predation risks (unger 1983; sargent 1988). compared to individual behavioural experiments con- ducted in the laboratory, males in our experiments may have accepted higher levels of predation risk, as they were confronted with a more complex environment. despite reduced foraging activities during the breeding season (unger 1983), males in social environments need to be present at to defend against conspeciﬁcs and other egg predators (divino & tonn 2008) and ⁄ or compete for nesting territories regardless of the risk of predation. high postspawning mortality in male fathead minnows results in added pressure to reproduce, as many males will have only one breeding season (becker 1983). in our experiments, the pres- ence of alarm substance did not affect male investment in reproduction. under more natural conditions and over an entire reproductive season, males may be more willing to accept the additional risks associated with repeated exposure to alarm substances by remaining at, or returning quickly to, their nests and actively guarding them against egg predators (lima & bed- nekoff 1999). the nest treatment, egg infection rates were lower in the 2007 pond experiment relative to our previous experiments in the mbrs ponds (e.g., divino & tonn 2008), but nevertheless were signiﬁcantly higher in the alarm substances treatment. this may suggest that although in the alarm males may be present at substances in maintaining their nests. this would be consistent with reduced nest maintenance by male fathead in the presence of a caged predator, minnows northern pike (jones & paszkowski 1997b). in contrast, in the 2008 pond experiment, when addi- tion of alarm substances was more concentrated and frequent, infection rates were higher (and similar) in both treatments. they were the nest less active limited effects of alarm substances hatching success of eggs is largely dependent on male parental care in fathead minnow (divino & tonn 2008). although changes to reproductive and nesting behaviour may have been more subtle than could be measured at the larger scale of our ﬁeld experiments, the addition of alarm substances did not alter the hatching success or the rate of nest failures. regardless of the sensitivity of our monitoring, any effect of alarm substances on male breeding behaviour was irrelevant at the population level. issues with scale the effects of alarm substances are stronger in environments that are small and contained. because the effective space (i.e., volume avoided by ﬁsh) from 1 cm2 of homogenised epidermis is estimated to be 58 m3 (lawrence & smith 1989), a small aquarium can be completely inundated within seconds (smith 2000). although this should also be true for our cattle troughs, the size and complexity of our ponds likely resulted in a heterogeneous distribution of alarm substances. a heterogeneous environment with areas of higher and lower perceived risk may dampen the effect of alarm substances at the population level. for example, wisenden (2008) found that traps labelled with alarm substances from 2 cm2 of epidermis were avoided by ﬁsh at a distance of 2 m, but not 8 m, in small lakes. alarm substances have not been chemically iden- tiﬁed; consequently, measurements of concentration and exposure frequency in natural environments are lacking. concentrations of alarm substances in labo- ratory studies often seem unnaturally high and can be impractical for larger-scale studies. for example, daily doses of 1 cm2: 20 l (pollock et al. 2005) would require approximately 51,000 and 44,000 donor ﬁsh per pond for our 2007 and 2008 experiments, respec- tively. total minnow densities in our regional lakes are orders of magnitude less (danylchuk & tonn 2003; nasmith et al. 2010). in addition, homogenised skin likely produces far greater alarm substances than would be released if a minnow was actually consumed by a predator. nevertheless, our experiments used concentrations 15–30 times higher than consistent minimum effective values (ferrari et al. 2005, 2006; ferrari & chivers 2006). maximum laboratory-based consumption rates of fathead minnow by northern pike (seaburg & moyle 1964; bevelhimer et al. 1985) suggest minnows may detect alarm substances in their environment as frequently as several times a day. however, such maximum consumption rates are not likely maintained in nature throughout the summer in alberta, where ﬁsh represent <15% of the diet of northern pike (venturelli & tonn 2006). repeated but not constant 227 jung & tonn exposure to alarm substances, as in our experiments, is likely the norm wherever predators and prey coexist in nature. although fathead minnows can continue to respond to alarm substances for up to 24 h after exposure (jones & paszkowski 1997a), the lack of measurable behavioural effects in our study may have been, in part, because of some degradation of the alarm substances prior to our observations. wisenden et al. (2009) observed that individuals from various species responded to alarm substances aged for three, but not six, hours. behavioural responses of individual ﬁsh in laboratory experiments are often measured within minutes after chemical stimulus addition. in contrast, our measures were taken after several hours and many repeated alarm substance additions. complete cessa- tion of normal behaviours, laboratory behavioural experiments, is unlikely to occur through- out the summer season in natural populations. typical of conclusion our results suggest that short-term behavioural res- ponses of individual ﬁsh to brief exposures to alarm substances, which are well measured in small-scale experiments, will not easily predict population-level effects. strong behavioural responses within minutes of alarm substances exposure may greatly decrease the probability of predation in the short term; however, ﬁsh in natural populations need to balance predation risk with other essential activities such as foraging and reproduction in the face of repeated encounters with alarm substances over the course of days and months. given the size and complexity of natural environments relative to small aquaria, and the temporal scales meaningful at is probably not surprising that there is debate about the function of alarm substances in the natural environment (magurran et al. 1996; irving & magurran 1997; wisenden et al. 2004). to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst examination of population-level effects of chem- ical signals of increased predation risk and more work needs to be carried out. future directions may focus on how ﬁsh compensate for any short-term trade-offs between predator avoidance and other activities, such as foraging and ⁄ or reproduction, and how to incorpo- rate demographic effects of increased survival when examining population-level effects. the population level, it acknowledgements we thank j. perdue, t. howatt, a. moenting, h. yee, l. lorenz, and j.
