sku´ lason et al. 1996; taylor 1999; robinson & schluter 2000; robinson & parsons 2002). growth polymorphisms are one of the most common types of polymorphism and result in multi-modal size-at-age distributions within popula- tions (noakes et al. 1989). typically, two growth forms will co-exist, a dwarf form and a normal form, and they will diverge in some aspects of their ecology. in some cases, co-occurring morphotypes have arisen through sympatric divergence (sku´ lason et al. 1996; smith & sku´ lason 1996), whereas others have resulted from secondary contact between divergent allopatric lineages (bernatchez & dodson 1990; bernatchez & wilson 1998). the dwarf-normal diversiﬁcation of freshwater ﬁshes is strongly related to trophic or resource ecology (smith & sku´ lason 1996; lu & bernatchez 1999; ylikarjula et al. 1999; trudel et al. 2001), but the effects of divergence in growth on reproductive traits may be just as important. body size can play an important role in the quantity and quality of gametes that individuals produce (roff 2002), and so divergence in growth rates and adult body size should affect reproductive traits of the growth forms in polymorphic populations. reproductive traits can vary widely between sym- patric morphs in many populations of ﬁshes, indicat- can evolutionarily and ⁄ or ing that developmentally respond to different ecological con- these traits 52 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00457.x ditions experienced by different forms. in salmonids for instance, egg number (fecundity) can be three times higher in larger anadromous than smaller nonanadromous forms (gross 1987). body size also strongly inﬂuences variation in arctic charr (salveli- nus alpinus) reproductive traits, including gonadoso- matic index (gsi) and egg size (jonsson & jonsson 2001). larger anadromous brown_trout (salmo_trutta) often have higher gsi but lower gonad lipid content than smaller resident brown_trout (jonsson & jonsson 1997). in white-spotted charr (salvelinus leucomae- nis), however, egg sizes did not vary between sea-run and resident forms even though individuals of the former morph are much larger than those of the latter (morita & takashima 1998). in non-salmonids, the larger benthic three spine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) form has larger eggs than the smaller limnetic form (baker et al. 2005). in pumpkinseed sunﬁsh (lepomis gibbosus), gsi did not vary between coexisting littoral and pelagic morphs (gillespie & fox 2003). in male bluegill sunﬁsh (lepomis macro- chirus), ‘sneakers’ have increased sperm quality and performance over the typical ‘parental’ males (neff & cargnelli 2004; stoltz & neff 2006), although the opposite relationship was found in rose bitterling (rhodeus ocellatus) (kanoh 2000). thus, sympatric forms of ﬁshes are not uniformly distinguished by variation in reproductive traits nor when such variation occurs is it necessarily related to size. the goal of this research was to better understand the reproductive life history consequences of a growth polymorphism in walleye (sander vitreus) in lake winnipeg (manitoba, canada). life history theory predicts several reproductive beneﬁts for larger indi- viduals that could limit the evolution of dwarf forms (roff 2002). in many ﬁshes, strong positive relation- ships exist between maternal body size and egg number (fecundity) (ricker 1954; hilborn & walters 1992; baccante & colby 1996; morita & takashima 1998) as well as between body and egg size (cham- bers & leggett 1996; johnston 1997; johnston & leggett 2002; hendry & day 2003). relationships between body size and other aspects of egg quality are less consistent (johnston 1997; wiegand et al. 2004; kamler 2005), although some positive relationships have been reported (huang et al. 1999; heino & godo 2002; bunnell et al. 2005). body size may also be an important factor in male reproductive effort. larger individuals on average have larger testes, including individuals exhibiting alternative reproductive strate- gies (stoltz et al. 2005). body size may also affect the aspects of sperm quality (stockley et al. 1997; cass- elman 2003); this does not appear to be universal (rakitin et al. 1999). the positive reproduc- tive ﬁtness consequences of larger body size should disadvantage dwarf forms unless offset by ﬁtness though, reproductive divergence of walleye morphotypes beneﬁts such as reduced risk of mortality or longer reproductive lifespan. and (s. v. vitreus), (sander canadensis) we tested for differences in reproductive traits between dwarf and normal morphotypes in the polymorphic walleye (s. vitreus) population of lake winnipeg. this is the only walleye population known to exhibit a growth polymorphism (johnston et al. 2010; moles et al. 2010) and may parallel the lake erie walleye population where a now-extinct subspe- cies, blue walleye (s. v. glaucum), once lived symp- atrically with walleye the congeneric sauger (hubbs & lagler 1964). dwarf and normal walleye in lake winnipeg also live sympatrically with sauger (john- ston et al. 2010). the two walleye forms differ in both growth rate and body shape, but appear to overlap in trophic ecology (moles et al. 2010). we predicted that the divergence in adult body size of the two forms would be accompanied by a divergence in their reproductive strategies. furthermore, we predicted that the nature of this divergence would resemble that observed between the normal walleye morphotype and the closely related sauger. compared to normal morphotype walleye, lake winnipeg sauger grow more slowly, have higher fecundity and produce smaller and more lipid-rich eggs (johnston et al. 2010). we predicted that the dwarf form walleye would exhibit similar reproductive differences relative to the normal form. we compared these reproductive traits, as well as some additional indices of reproduc- tive investment, between dwarf and normal walleye forms of both sexes. within populations, phenotypic divergences can result from plastic developmental responses of traits to variation in local environmental conditions that do not change gene frequencies (west-eberhard 1989). alter- natively, in some divergent populations, the differing responses to selection either result in or are accompa- nied by population segregation, drift and genetic divergence (bolnick et al. 2007). distinguishing among these hypotheses is important because it provides insights into the proximal mechanisms that generate observed phenotypic variation, and also because examples of genetically divergent forms may provide insights into the very early stages of ecological speciation (smith & sku´ lason 1996; taylor 1999). we also extended our understanding of polymorphic walleye in lake winnipeg by evaluating the phylog- eographic origins and population genetic structure of dwarf and normal forms. the polymorphism of lake winnipeg walleye may represent two glacial lineages that either diverged separately or following their secondary contact after colonising lake winnipeg, as has been reported for other morphotype pairs (bernatchez & dodson 1990). analysis of mitochon- 53 moles et al. drial dna has shown that lake winnipeg walleye are dominated by two main haplotype groups, one originating from the mississippi glacial refugium, the other from the missouri refugium (billington et al. 1992; backhouse 2009). we examined the genetic origins and divergence of walleye growth forms using mitochondrial and microsatellite dna markers. these complementary neutral genetic marker systems enable the joint assessment of the historical origins and contemporary relationship between the two morpho- types (billington et al. 1992; jarne & lagoda 1996; bernatchez & wilson 1998), thereby helping to resolve the ecological and evolutionary factors inﬂu- encing the co-occurrence of this unique pair. materials and methods field sampling and ﬁsh processing we sampled mature, normal form walleye during the spring of 2002, 2003, and 2004 near spawning shoals along the northwest shore of the south basin of lake winnipeg. immature, normal form walleye, as well as mature and immature dwarf form walleye, were sampled at this same location in the spring of 2004 only. at this time, spawning had just begun, and most mature females were unovulated (i.e., eggs not free- ﬂowing). large individuals were lethally sampled using 100–150 mm stretched mesh monoﬁlament gill nets. dwarf individuals and smaller normal walleye were sampled using 25–62 mm stretched mesh monoﬁlament gill nets. subsamples of both males and females were randomly taken from the large mesh net samples, whereas all mature females and males and a random subsample of immature ﬁsh were taken from the small mesh net samples. all individ- uals were killed by a blow to the head and packed on ice, then transported to the laboratory for further processing. inspection of the gonads, each individual ﬁsh was identiﬁed for sex and maturity by visual then weighed (total mass, ±1 g wet) and measured from the tip of the snout to the fork of the caudal ﬁn [fork length (fl), ±1 mm]. at this point, walleye sampled in 2004 were placed whole in labelled plastic bags and frozen so that they could be photographed for morphometric analyses (moles et al. 2010) before processing. for each mature male, testes were removed, weighed (±0.1 g wet) and frozen. for mature unovulated females, ovaries were removed and weighed whole (±0.1 g wet), then two subsamples were removed from the mid-region, weighed (±0.1 g wet) and frozen. for mature ovulated females, two subsamples of ripe ova were collected, weighed and frozen. for females that were frozen whole prior to processing, we removed and subsampled the ovaries in 54 a frozen state to ensure that ova remained intact prior to freeze-drying (see below). the subsequent processing was similar for both sexes. the carcass was weighed without gonads (somatic mass, ±1 g wet), then the liver was removed, weighed (±0.1 g wet), and frozen. all collected tissue samples were stored in small plastic bags at )20 °c, except for one series of the ovary ⁄ ova subsamples from 2004 that were stored at )70 °c for fatty acid analyses. for molecular analy- ses, tissue from the caudal ﬁn of each ﬁsh was collected and stored in 95% ethanol. for age determi- nations, sagittal otoliths were removed from each ﬁsh, rubbed clean, then placed into plastic vials, and allowed to air dry. gonad and ova samples stored at )20 °c were freeze-dried for 7 days and reweighed (±0.1 g dry) to estimate moisture contents. two subsamples of 30 freeze-dried ova were weighed (±0.01 mg dry) to estimate mean egg size. fecundity was then estimated as the product of ovary wet mass and ovary dry matter content divided by mean egg size. all freeze-dried tissues were ground to a coarse powder using a ball mill. total lipids were then extracted from the ground tissues using a chloroform:methanol procedure as outlined previously (kaufman et al. 2007; moles et al. 2008) and expressed on a dry mass basis. for the ovary ⁄ ova subsamples that were stored at )70 °c, fatty acid proﬁles were determined on total lipids using ﬂame ionisation gas chromatography as outlined previously (wiegand et al. 2004, 2007). fatty acids were expressed on a relative abundance basis (i.e., percentage of total fatty acids). ages were determined by counting annuli on sections of the sagittal otoliths. otoliths were set in epoxy and sectioned through the nucleus and perpen- dicular to the longitudinal axis using a isomet (buehlerò, lake bluff, il, usa) low speed saw. sections were mounted in clear epoxy on a glass microscope slide and viewed under a compound microscope. the outer edge of the section was always counted as a complete annulus because ﬁsh were sampled at spawning season (i.e., near their birthdates). individuals were classiﬁed as either dwarf or normal using criteria developed from age- and sex-speciﬁc length-frequency distributions generated from stock assessment survey data (johnston et al. 2010). specif- ically, our criteria discriminated the two morphotypes at the least frequent fl value, or the midpoint in any range of frequent values, between the two observed modal lengths in each of the age- and sex- speciﬁc length-frequency histograms. thus, male walleye collected in this study were classiﬁed as ‘dwarf’ if their fl was <260 mm at age four, <280 mm at age ﬁve, or <350 mm at any age older than ﬁve. female walleye were classiﬁed as ‘dwarf’ if their fl was <320 mm at age four or ﬁve, or <350 mm at any least age older than ﬁve. males and females that were larger at age than these thresholds were classiﬁed as ‘normal’. molecular analyses genomic dna was extracted from the pectoral ﬁsh tissue of 100 individuals (mature and immature) of both forms using a rapid lysis method. approximately 10 mg of ﬁn tissue was lysed overnight with sds and proteinase k, followed by isopropanol precipitation and a 70% ethanol rinse (wilson et al. 2007). pelleted dna was resuspended in 200 ll of te, and dna quality and quantity were determined by horizontal agarose electrophoresis alongside molecular mass standards. working solutions were made to a concen- )1 and used for both dna sequenc- tration of 6 ngæll ing and microsatellite ampliﬁcations. multilocus microsatellite genotypes were obtained from each sample for nine previously identiﬁed micro- satellite loci (borer et al. 1999; wirth et al. 1999). fluorescently labelled loci were co-ampliﬁed in two 10 ll polymerase chain reactions (pcr) containing sterile deionised water, 1x pcr buffer with 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2–0.6 pmol of each primer pair, 200 lm dntps, 0.25 units taq polymerase, and approximately 6 ng of genomic dna. multiplex 1 contained svi2ned, svi4 hex and svi6ned, (borer et al. 1999); multiplex 2 consisted of svi7hex (borer et al. 1999), svil4 hex, svil56fam, svil6ned, svil7ned and svil86fam (wirth et al. 1999). the pcr cycling programme consisted of 11-min initial denaturation at 94 °c, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °c, 1 min at 59 °c, 1 min at 72 °c, and a ﬁnal extension time of 45 min at 60 °c. ampliﬁed products were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel on an abi prism 377 dna sequencer and sized using rox 350 size standards (applied biosystems inc., carlsbad, ca, usa). genotypes at each locus were scored using genotyper 2.0 (applied biosystems inc.) and conﬁrmed by manual proofreading. a 640-base portion of the mitochondrial control region was ampliﬁed and sequenced via pcr to assess the allopatric or sympatric origin of the two walleye forms. the partial control region was ampliﬁed using primers hw1 (gatt et al. 2000) and ln20 (bernatchez et al. 1992). target dna was ampliﬁed in 10 ll reaction mixture containing sterile deionised water, 1 ll of 1x pcr buffer with 1.5 mm mgcl2, 3 pmol of each primer, 200 lm dntps, 0.5 units of taq polymerase and 6 ng of genomic dna. ampliﬁed dna was treated with exosap (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) to remove excess primers and unincorpo- rated nucleotides, and sequenced via cycle sequencing with bigdye 3.1 dye terminator chemistry (applied biosystems) using the manufacturer’s protocol. se- quence products were visualised on an abi377 automated sequencer; sequence electropherograms reproductive divergence of walleye morphotypes were aligned and proofread using sequencer 4.7 (genecodes) using genbank accession af162272 (gatt et al. 2000) as a reference sequence. statistical analysis variation in reproductive traits between dwarf and normal morphotypes were assessed by analysis of covariance (ancova) using fl as the covariate (glm procedure) (sas institute inc. 2009). only mature individuals were used in these analyses. we examined differences between growth forms in liver size and lipid content, and gonad size and lipid content for both sexes, and differences in fecundity, egg size and egg fatty acid proﬁles for females. liver size was repre- sented by the hepatosomatic index (hsi = 100 · liver mass ⁄ somatic mass), and gonad size was represented by the gonadosomatic index (gsi = 100 · gonad mass ⁄ somatic mass). variables were loge-transformed as required to linearise relationships and ⁄ or stabilise variance. mature female body length did not overlap between dwarf and normal forms in this dataset (dwarf females <350 mm fl; normal females >350 mm fl) and so ancova analyses of female reproductive traits that used fl as the covariate made minor extrapola- tions of each group to a mid-point fl of 350 mm. mature male body length overlapped between dwarf and normal forms and so estimates adjusted to a common fl of 350 mm involved an extrapolation for dwarf but not normal males. variation in the fatty acid proﬁle of egg total lipids was ﬁrst summarised by covariance-based principal components analysis (pca) of the 28 fatty acid relative abundances pooling all females. variation between forms was then assessed by ancova for each of the three principal components, as well as for selected individual fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid (22:6(n-3), dha), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(n-3), epa), arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6), ara), palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1(n-9), oa), palmitoleic acid (16:1(n-7)), and a-linolenic acid (18:3(n-3), ala). these were selected because of their prominent structural or functional roles or because they contrib- uted greatly to among-female variation based on our pca results. fatty acid percentages were arcsine- square-root transformed prior to analyses. genepop version 4.0 (raymond & rousset 1995; rousset 2008) was utilised to test for hardy–weinberg equilibrium (hwe) and linkage equilibrium (le) within morphotype groups and to test for genotypic differentiation between forms. both mature and immature individuals were used in these analyses. signiﬁcance for the above tests was estimated using fisher’s exact test, employing the markov chain method (guo & thompson 1992) (1000 dememorisa- tions, batches and iterations per batch) as implemented 55 moles et al. (1984) fst estimator in genepop. sequential bonferroni correction (rice 1989) was also used to compensate for the increase in type one error due to multiple pair-wise testing. fstat 2.9.3.2 (goudet 1995) was used to estimate (h); weir & cockerham’s signiﬁcance was tested using 1000 permutations. to complement the population-level analyses, the indi- vidual-based, multi-locus bayesian clustering pro- gramme structure version 2.2 (pritchard et al. 2000, 2007) was used to estimate the most likely number of populations (k) given the genotypic data. under combined assumptions of hwe and le, the pro- gramme aims to assign individuals probabilistically to populations based on their multi-locus genotypes. ten independent runs were performed at k = 1–3, each consisting of a burn-in period of 100,000 iterations, followed by 100,000 markov chain monte carlo iterations using no prior information and assuming admixture and the correlated allele frequencies model (falush et al. 2003). phylogeographic ancestry of the walleye morpho- types was assessed by comparing mtdna haplotype sequences to published data (billington & strange 1995; stepien & faber 1998; gatt et al. 2000; stepien et al. 2009). divergence among haplotypes was esti- mated using kimura’s 2-parameter model in mega 3.1 (kumar et al. 2004). haplotype associations with morphotypes were assessed using a row-by-column g-test (sokal & rohlf 1981) to test their sympatric versus allopatric ancestry. results reproductive trait variation a total of 181 mature normal form (100 males, 81 females) and 60 mature dwarf form (47 males, 13 females) walleye were sampled from 2002 to 2004. both dwarf and normal ﬁsh were spawning in the same location and appeared to be at the same stage of their spawning periods based on visual gonad inspec- tion. all mature males had free-ﬂowing semen. most mature females were unovulated, but some of both forms were ovulated and partly spent. only mature individuals were used in comparisons of reproductive traits, including liver traits. ovulated females were not included in analyses of gonad size and fecundity, but were used in all other analyses. females generally had higher hsi than males for both forms, but the relationship between hsi and body size appeared to differ between morphotypes (fig. 1). there was no signiﬁcant morphotype · fl interaction in males (ancova, heterogeneity of slopes, f1,143 = 0.26, p = 0.61), but signiﬁcant interaction in females (f1,90 = 5.32, p = 0.023). the female hsi versus fl relationship was positive for the dwarf form but

ties did not differ signiﬁcantly between the two forms (ancova, main effects, f1,64 = 0.10, p = 0.75). egg logefl in size increased linearly with maternal both forms (fig. 3b) with no signiﬁcant

re-examined morphotype differences in female gsi, fecundity and egg size using age rather than fl as the covariate. in all cases, the interaction between age and morphotype was not signiﬁcant, and all dependent variables increased with age. when adjusted to an age of 8 years, gsi was signiﬁcantly higher and egg size was signiﬁcantly larger in dwarf than normal females, but fecundity was signiﬁcantly lower in dwarf than normal females.

the eighteen hwe tests within sample groups exhib- ited signiﬁcant deviations after sequential bonferonni correction at p < 0.05 (svi2-normal, p = 0.0003; svil4-normal, p < 0.0001; svil4-dwarf p = 0.0001). across all nine loci, signiﬁcant genotypic frequency differences were detected between the dwarf and normal forms (p = 0.018); however, locus-by-locus testing revealed no signiﬁcant genotypic differentia- tion between forms at any given locus after correction for multiple nominal tests (rice 1989). in addition, post hoc testing of genotypic differentiation, utilising only the seven loci found to conform to hwe, found no forms (p = 0.055). genetic differentiation between morpho- types was not signiﬁcant based on weir and cocker- ham’s (1984) analogue of fst (h = 0.003; p = 0.1). differentiation signiﬁcant between population genetic structure no evidence of signiﬁcant linkage disequilibrium was detected between loci across all samples and within morphotype groups; however, both groups exhibited signiﬁcant deviations from hwe at p < 0.05 (dwarf p = 0.0005, normal p < 0.0001). per locus, three of individual-based analyses yielded congruent results indicating a single interbreeding population. analysis of the genotypic data using the program structure version 2.2 (pritchard et al. 2000, 2007) failed to ﬁnd genetic substructure between walleye morphotypes. the highest mean ln likelihood was found at k = 1 (ln = )2897.46). mean ln likelihood estimates at 59 moles et al. k = 2 and 3 were )2909.61 and )3166.19, respec- tively. mean variance of ln likelihood values also increased at k > 1; mean variance for k = 1, 2 and 3 were estimated at 41.34, 103.11 and 656.48, respec- tively. furthermore, at k > 1, the proportion of membership of each individual (q) for each cluster was largely symmetrical (1 ⁄ k) which is indicative of an absence of genetic subdivision (pritchard et al. 2007). sequencing of the partial mitochondrial control region (approximately 640 bases) detected a total of 12 haplotypes among the ﬁsh sampled (table 2). within each form, eight haplotypes were detected, with four of these shared between the two forms (table 2). the three most common haplotypes were found in 79% of the ﬁsh that were analysed and were present in both forms of walleye. statistical analysis showed no signiﬁcant differences in haplotype distribution be- tween the two forms. although two of the three most common haplotypes appeared to be more common in adult dwarf versus normal walleye (table 2), inclusion of immature ﬁsh from both forms resulted in a failure to reject the null hypothesis of equal representation (v2 = 11.8; p > 0.05). comparison with published phylogeographic data for walleye (billington et al. 1992; gatt et al. 2000) indicated that the walleye in lake winnipeg originated from missourian and mis- sissippian glacial refugia, with approximately equal contributions from both sources (table 2). discussion given the positive relationship between reproductive investment and body size observed in many ﬁshes, we expected that a shift towards slower growth and smaller adult body size would be accompanied by concurrent changes in reproductive strategy. previous research has shown that the walleye population of lake winnipeg exhibit two growth forms, a normal form which exhibits a growth rate and size at maturity similar to other walleye populations, and a slower- growing dwarf form which matures at a much smaller body size than any known walleye population (john- ston et al. 2010; moles et al. 2010). not only have the two forms diverged in body morphometry (moles et al. 2010), but the current study has demonstrated a divergence in several reproductive characteristics as well. despite this differentiation with respect to phenotypic traits, microsatellite dna and mitochon- drial analyses suggested that the two growth forms are part of a single gene pool. reproductive trait divergence between walleye forms we examined the size and lipid content of the liver because of its key role in many physiological 60 l s a u d v d n i i i e p y t o h p r o m h t w o r g l a m r o n d n a f r a w d f o s r e b m u n d

nor lipid content differed between male growth forms. similarly, hsi did not vary between female forms. however, liver lipid content declined with increasing body size in both dwarf and normal forms and was signiﬁcantly lower in the dwarf form. the decline in liver lipid content with body size may represent an increasing contribution of lipid energy to reproduction (at the expense of maternal stores) over the reproductive lifetime. similarly, the lower lipid content in dwarf female livers suggests a greater depletion of hepatic reserves to support reproduction in the dwarf form. an alternate explanation is that the observed differences in liver lipid concentration, either with body size or between growth forms, could reﬂect differences in lipid storage strategies. examining seasonal trends in hepatic lipid concentrations, relative to other body lipid concentrations, could resolve which of these mechanisms most likely explains the observed patterns. gonad size (expressed as gsi) increased with body size in both dwarf and normal forms and was larger in the dwarf form for both sexes. thus, dwarf walleye appear to make a larger gonadal investment at a given body size. larger testes often produce more sperm in birds (møller 1988), mammals (møller 1989) and ﬁshes (billard et al. 1995), and the relatively larger testes of dwarf males likely enhance their sperm production. this may be advantageous for success- fully competing for mates with larger normal form males on the spawning grounds. the relatively larger ovaries of dwarf females result from a stronger investment in egg size at the expense of egg number. we found little difference in size- adjusted fecundity between dwarf and normal indi- viduals, but dwarf females produce much larger eggs than would be predicted from their body size. whereas one would predict smaller individuals to produce smaller eggs (chambers & leggett 1996; johnston 1997; johnston & leggett 2002; hendry & day 2003), this is not the case for dwarf walleye. the range of observed egg sizes produced by the dwarf form was roughly similar to that for normal walleye, suggesting a minimal egg size below which the egg becomes unviable or less ﬁt. however, the congeneric sauger in lake winnipeg produces smaller eggs than either walleye form (johnston et al. 2010). a developmental or physiological correlation between maternal body size and egg size may have been overcome by selection in these walleye. an alternate explanation is that egg size is a much less evolutionarily or developmentally responsive trait than gonad size or fecundity, so changes to egg size lag behind the divergence of other phenotypic traits. consistent with this idea, we note that egg size generally shows much reproductive divergence of walleye morphotypes lower variation than fecundity (johnston & leggett 2002). reproductive investment may not only be a func- tion of gonad size but also related to energy or nutrient status. individuals have a limited energy and nutrient budget with which to fulﬁl their current and future requirements for maintenance, growth and reproduc- tion (adams 1999). lipid energy allocated to the gonads is strongly correlated to the growth and survival of offspring and so likely enhances ﬁtness (march 1993; wiegand 1996; brooks et al. 1997; rainuzzo et al. 1997; tocher 2003). we found no difference in testes lipid content between the male growth forms. however, the relationship between ovary lipid content and body size varied between female forms, and ovary lipid content was slightly higher in the dwarf than the normal form when compared at an intermediate body size. this difference was not related to differences in somatic lipid reserves between forms (moles et al. 2010), but did reﬂect the lower concentration of lipid in the livers of dwarf females at spawning. divergence in gonad lipid allocation could arise from selection pressures that favour higher quality eggs over greater numbers of eggs. an alternate, developmental explanation is that gonad lipid differences may arise from variation in parental diet (navas et al. 1997). at this point, the evidence for differences in trophic ecology between the walleye morphotypes is equivocal (moles et al. 2010), and so the causes of observed differences in ovary lipid content between walleye growth forms remain unclear. we also examined variation in the fatty acid proﬁles of ovary lipid between the walleye forms and found many similarities, and some subtle but potentially signiﬁcant differences. like the normal form walleye of lake winnipeg, the dwarf form produced eggs with much lower percentages of ara than seen in other populations of this species (wiegand et al. 2004, 2007). we found some evidence that dwarf and normal forms produce eggs that differ in ala and epa percentages and the epa ⁄ ara ratio. as with gonad lipid content, variation in fatty acid proﬁles may arise from differences in diet between the forms (navas et al. 1997). regardless, these egg fatty acid differ- ences could affect offspring survival (rainuzzo et al. 1997). high levels of epa or high epa ⁄ ara ratios in eggs have been linked to lower viability of juveniles in several species, including walleye (czesny et al. 1999). these ﬁndings suggest that individuals with less epa and lower epa ⁄ ara ratios, such as these dwarf females and the older, larger normal females may enhance offspring survival. the biological signiﬁcance, if any, of the relationship between ala and fl (fig. 6) is unclear, as is the quantitative signiﬁcance of epa and dha synthesis from ala in 61 moles et al. this species. finer scale analyses will be necessary to disentangle the environmental sources and life history effects of variation in fatty acids in lake winnipeg walleye. the ability to convert individual fatty acids, such as ara, epa and dha, are dietary ‘essentials’ in some vertebrates because they have speciﬁc metabolic or structural roles and are not synthesised by the animal in adequate amounts (march 1993; wiegand et al. 2004). ala and 18:2 (n-6) are precursors to the c20 and c22 fatty acids in the (n-3) and (n-6) families, respectively (sargent et al. 1995). however, the c18 precursors to the c20 and c22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) varies among ﬁsh taxa. marine ﬁsh do not make this conversion even though the required genes are present, perhaps because there is no selection pressure to do so with high dietary levels of c20 and c22 pufa (sargent et al. 2002; tocher 2003). by contrast, several freshwater ﬁsh taxa have this capability (sargent et al. 2002; tocher 2003). interestingly, hepatocytes of northern pike (esox lucius), a piscivore like walleye, have the ability to make epa and dha from ala (buzzi et al. 1997). however, such conversions were not found in vivo, suggesting that this capacity is restricted or down- regulated in pike (henderson et al. 1995). the situa- tion in walleye remains to be investigated. a common intermediate at body the normals, or some consideration should be given to our statis- tical extrapolation of estimates beyond the range of body size in some of our results. our approach was to use body size as the covariate, and to compare growth forms size (fl = 350 mm). in females, this approach involved a comparison between a near-maximum size of repro- duction for the dwarfs and a near-minimum size of reproduction for in other words, between the end of the dwarf’s reproductive lifespan, and the beginning of the normal’s reproductive lifespan. because the two morphotypes appear to have similar ages of maturity and longevities (moles et al. 2010), age could be considered a more appropriate covariate of comparison; many of the reproductive traits we examined covary with age as well as body size (bernardo 1996; abdoli et al. 2005). however, when age rather than size was used as the covariate in our analyses, we still observed signiﬁcantly higher gsi and egg size in the dwarf relative to the normal form though fecundity was lower, as would be expected. our initial prediction for reproductive differences between dwarf and normal form walleye was that they would parallel the variation observed between sauger and normal form walleye in lake winnipeg. this prediction appeared to be correct in some respects but not others. like sauger, the dwarf form walleye grow more slowly, mature at a smaller body size and 62 produce more lipid-rich eggs relative to the normal form walleye. however, unlike sauger, the dwarf form walleye have a larger size-adjusted gsi, similar size- adjusted fecundity and larger egg size than normal form walleye. in addition, sauger spawning generally peaks 10–15 days after walleye spawning in lake winnipeg, whereas dwarf and normal form walleye appear to spawn at roughly the same time (t.a. johnston, personal observation). using the divergence in life histories of walleye and sauger as a model to predict divergence in life histories of walleye growth forms appears to be overly simplistic; a shared direction of divergence in growth rates is not neces- sarily accompanied by similar changes in other life history traits. the evolutionary separation of sauger from walleye is older than that between walleye growth forms, and so the dissimilarity in divergence of life history traits may reﬂect different patterns of selection on a variety of traits during divergence or subsequent trait evolution following speciation. many life history traits are interrelated and covary. for example, high reproductive investment per spawn event may be linked with fewer lifetime reproductive events, and larger eggs (and hence, offspring) may be linked to spawning earlier in the spring when juvenile food resources may be limited. population structure most models of ecological speciation begin with the ecological separation of phenotypes based on some form of specialisation (smith & sku´ lason 1996; bolnick et al. 2007). reproductive isolation arises either as a byproduct of diversifying selection acting on traits favourable in each environment that indirectly affect reproduction, or selection directly disfavours intermediate forms, leading to the genetic differenti- ation of populations using different habitats. with regard to the gene ﬂow between sympatric morpho- types, studies have shown that the degree of repro- ductive isolation can vary widely, both within and among populations, in many species (robinson & wilson 1994; lu & bernatchez 1999). in the lake winnipeg walleye population, the combined evidence from microsatellite and mitochon- drial dna supports the hypothesis that the phenotypic diversity of dwarf and normal forms has arisen in situ, as a result of either adaptive divergence or plastic responses to environmental cues. while there was some limited evidence for genotypic differentiation between morphotypes, the fst estimate suggests that the genetic variability between these subpopulations is low. furthermore, the individual-based bayesian multi-locus cluster analysis indicated that a single population model ﬁt the genetic data with the great- est likelihood in comparison with two and three population models. this is strong evidence of contin- uing gene ﬂow between growth forms and is consis- tent with recent microsatellite analyses of lake winnipeg walleye from across the entire lake showing very little genetic differentiation among spawning aggregations (backhouse 2009). dwarf and normal walleye in the south basin appear to spawn at roughly the same time and at the same location based on the results of our ﬁeld sampling. however, the morpho- types might rely on other mechanisms of pre- or post- zygotic reproductive isolation that are exhibited by ﬁsh populations (kodric-brown 1990). for instance, size-assortative mating many populations exhibit preferences whereby individuals are most likely to spawn with similar-sized individuals (basolo 2004). the occurrence of a single interbreeding population of phenotypically divergent walleye suggests that development, morphology and life history all respond to local environmental conditions that generate the dwarf-normal polyphenism in the walleye of lake winnipeg. we propose that adult dwarf and normal walleye inhabit different lake habitats (dwarf individ- uals never leave a juvenile niche) and that niche use has a strong inﬂuence on the expression of many complex traits, such as growth (moles et al. 2010). if this is the case, then walleye polyphenism in lake winnipeg is a local phenomenon maintained as long as walleye continue to occupy different adult niches. although in situ divergence of the two walleye forms is the most parsimonious explanation, is also possible that secondary contact of previously isolated groups was followed by sufﬁcient interbreeding to eliminate any evidence of their separate phylogeo- graphic origins that could be detected using neutral genetic markers. adaptive differentiation despite high gene ﬂow has been observed between sympatric ecotypes of rainbow smelt (osmerus mordax) (saint- laurent et al. 2003). to determine whether the two morphotypes represent phenotypic diversity or diver- gent adaptive forms, breeding experiments and rearing under controlled conditions will be required to quan- tify the heritability of morphological and life history traits. it reproductive traits are powerful determinants of ﬁtness because of the extremely high mortality rates experienced by gametes and young-of-the-year indi- viduals. the quantity and quality of gametes produced likely depend in complex and indirect ways on environmental components that affect parents. dwarf individuals, particularly the females, are disadvan- taged in the number of gametes and therefore number of offspring that they can produce in one spawning season. in order for dwarf walleye to increase in frequency in the population, this strong negative effect must be mitigated by other ﬁtness advantages. dwarf individuals may have at least two advantages. first, reproductive divergence of walleye morphotypes their small size may allow them to experience longer lifespan than their normal counterparts who are much more likely to be caught in the size-selective gear of one the largest freshwater ﬁsheries in canada. second, dwarf individuals may increase the quality of the gametes they produce. here, we have shown convinc- ing evidence that this does occur. acknowledgements field assistance
