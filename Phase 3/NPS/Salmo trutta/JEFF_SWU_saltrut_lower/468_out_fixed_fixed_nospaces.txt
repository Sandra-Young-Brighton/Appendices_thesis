again, the only signiﬁcant diel difference was in sympatry. post hoc tests between treatments revealed that there were no differences at night, but during the day, there were differences between allopatry and visual trials, sympatry and visual trials, and sympatry and odour trials. no predation or other aggressive behaviour by eels towards bullies was observed in any trial. it was concluded that the presence of eels affected both bully activity and use of rocks, but this response was not solely due to either visual or odour cues. changes in movement and the use of rocks appear to require multiple cues, and denial of either visual or odour cues was insufﬁcient to elicit a response. key words: allopatry; sympatry; visual cues; odour; interactions; predation introduction fish populations are mediated by a series of biotic and abiotic mechanisms. although abiotic mecha- nisms have been suggested as the predominant inﬂuence on ﬁsh populations (jackson et al. 2001), biotic mechanisms such as predation have been shown to impact on ﬁsh communities (townsend & crowl 1991). predation is an important top-down mechanism (e.g., nystro¨m et al. 2003) in maintain- ing a healthy ﬁsh population in balance with the carrying capacity of the environment – reduced predation can result in higher survival but decreased growth and condition of individuals. prey species often exhibit to predation including the use of behaviours that may reduce adaptations speciﬁc their chances of capture by a potential predator (kriestensen & closs 2004). within new zealand freshwater ecosystems, the longﬁn eel anguilla dieffenbachii is the largest species and an apex predator. while this species can often form >90% of the total ﬁsh biomass in small streams (hicks & mccaughan 1997), growth is relatively slow, averaging 2–3 cm per year (jellyman 2009), so such high biomass is achieved by low productivity over many years. a commercial eel ﬁshery com- menced in the mid-1960s (jellyman 2007), and as late as the 1990s, the average annual catch of longﬁns was around 500 t per year. in response to increasing the status of stocks (e.g., hoyle & concern about jellyman 2002; jellyman 2009), there have been recent moves to reduce the harvest of longﬁns, and correspondence: d. j. jellyman, national institute of water and atmosphere, p.o. box 8602, riccarton, christchurch 8440, new zealand. e-mail: d.jellyman@ niwa.co.nz doi. 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00523.x 57 jellyman et al. the present total catch is <100 t per annum (ministry of fisheries 2010). eels can impact on populations of other ﬁsh species, especially prey species, and longﬁns in particular are known predators of common bullies (gobiomorphus cotidianus; e.g., cairns 1942; jellyman 1989, 1996). thus, rowe (1999) recorded reduced abundance of common bullies in lakes containing eels. to date, there have been two studies on the effects of removing longﬁns from freshwater ﬁsh populations. burnet (1969) removed longﬁns from a small south island stream and recorded a signiﬁcant increase in numbers of the introduced brown_trout salmo_trutta, although the average size deceased markedly. removal of large longﬁns from a north island stream (chisnall et al. 2003) resulted in an increase in the density and habitat utilisation of juvenile shortﬁn eels (anguilla australis). both studies concluded that removal of large eels, especially longﬁns, regulated the density and structure of the resident eel population. it there is is generally accepted that there has been longﬁns widespread reduction in the density of throughout new zealand, largely associated with commercial ﬁshing but also loss of habitat and upstream access (jellyman 2009). however, apart from the aforementioned studies, little understanding of how the presence of longﬁn eels inﬂuences ﬁsh communities, including inﬂuences on the behaviour of smaller ﬁsh that represent potential prey. the present study was designed to investigate this by studying the behaviour of common bullies with the presence of a longﬁn eel (sympatry) and without an eel (allopatry). further, the inﬂuence of either olfactory or visual cues was investigated by isolation of the eel from the bullies. our hypothesis was that while longﬁn eels and common bullies frequently coexist, bullies would show some avoid- ance response to the presence of an eel, especially at night, and that at night, odour cues would be more inﬂuential than visual cues. methods longﬁn eels and common bullies (hereafter referred to as bullies) were collected on three occasions from the selwyn river in canterbury using electric ﬁshing. however, ﬂooding of this river necessitated collection from the lower styx river using baited g-minnow traps on a further ﬁve occasions. bullies were selected within a size range of 48–56 mm (mean length 51 mm), while longﬁn eels ranged from 535 to 553 mm (mean length 544 mm), well above the minimum size range of 300–400 mm where they include ﬁsh in their diet (jellyman 1989). fresh experimental ﬁsh were collected on the morning of day 1 and left to acclimate to the experimental conditions for 48 h. they were then ﬁlmed for the following 48 h before being released back into the wild. all handling procedures complied with niwa’s animal ethics protocols. the trials used 44-l aquaria (fig. 1) with each tank having its own water and air supply. water was sourced from the christchurch city reticulated supply and was high-quality, untreated artesian water. water from the top tank could be either directed into the bottom tank or run to waste, depending on the trial requirements. tanks were equipped with an overﬂow, and a complete exchange of water took place approx- imately every 2 h. the bottoms of the tanks were covered with light-coloured gravel to a depth of 25 mm. to add some habitat variety, two rocks (70 · 70 mm and 130 · 60 mm) were placed in the centre of the tank, separated by a small gap. as bullies needed to be observed at all times, the rocks did not in the out carried fig. 1. the experimental set-up. filming was left-hand (experimental) tank using an overhead video camera and a side-mounted infrared light as shown. the the experimental tank is shown along the left- hand edge of this tank. flow was from right to left. partition glass in 58 impacts of longﬁn eels on the behaviour of common bullies provide concealment. the sides of the tanks were covered with white paper to further isolate the ﬁsh from their surroundings. the experiments were conducted within a temper- ature-controlled room; water temperature and light levels were recorded with a hobo datalogger. water temperature averaged 16.9 °c (se 0.025), range 15.6– 18.0. lighting was via cold source ﬂuorescent tubes, which provided ‘day’ illumination (252 lux), while dusk ⁄ dawn lighting was from a small lamp (12 lux). apart from infrared, no lights were used at night. photoperiods were follows: daylight 07:00– 18:00 h, dusk 18:00–19:00, night 19:00–06:00 and dawn 06:00–07:00. for simplicity, dawn observations were incorporated into the daytime results and dusk results into the night results. as fish were fed 3 g of frozen tubifex worms once daily at random times. the amount of food equated to 0.6% biomass, slightly less than the 1% assumed to be a maintenance feeding ration for longﬁn eels (burnet 1952; graynoth & taylor 2000). during the 48-h ﬁlming of each trial, entry to the experimental room was once daily for feeding and usually once to check cameras – on each occasion, care was taken to minimise disruption to ﬁsh behaviour. treatments were bullies only (‘allopatry’), bullies and eel (‘sympatry’), bullies with the eel in a separate upstream tank (‘odour’) and bullies with eel alongside in a separate compartment (‘visual’). for the odour treatment, bullies could not see the eel in the upstream tank, but during the trial, overﬂow water from the eel tank entered the bully tank. for the visual treatment, bullies could see the eel in the alongside compartment, but there was no ﬂow of water from the compartment to the bully tank. each trial was replicated four times. filming used a sony handycam hdr xr520 with a 240-gb hard drive that enabled 48 h of continuous ﬁlming. night ﬁlming used an infrared illuminator (dennard, 12 v 4.2 a). to compare behaviour between treatments, the ﬁrst 5 minæh of each 48-h period was analysed. for this, bully behaviour recorded was the total activity of bullies in 5 min. (activity was deﬁned as a period of time when at least one of the bullies was moving; hence, zero activity was no movement by any individual.) use of rocks was deﬁned as the number of bullies in contact with the rocks, which was determined from a single freeze frame taken half way through the 5-min analysis period. a note was also made on any aggressive behaviour of eels towards bullies (e.g., chasing, biting, predation). to ensure parametric statistical tests could be used to analyse data, a levene’s test was used to check whether data met the assumptions of homogeneity of variance while a kolmogorov–smirnov test was used to check whether data met the assumptions of normality (sokal & rohlf 1995). where appropriate, data were log10(x + 1)-transformed to meet parametric statistical assumptions. repeated measures anova was used to compare differences between treatments with diel cycle used as a nested term. any between- or within-treatments that statistically differed were fur- ther explored with paired t-tests or bonferroni post hoc comparisons to identify pairwise differences. results time moving did not differ between treatments (d.f. = 3, f = 2.371, p = 0.122), but signiﬁcant dif- ferences were observed within treatments (d.f. = 1, f = 8.463, p = 0.013). paired t-tests between day and night for each treatment showed that the only differ- ence was in sympatry (table 1) when activity at night was greater than that during the day (fig. 2). the use of rocks by bullies differed signiﬁcantly (repeated measures anova, between treatments d.f. = 3, f = 6.633, p = 0.007) and within treatments (d.f. = 1, f = 10.005, p = 0.008). post hoc compari- sons (paired t-tests) showed that the only diel differ- ence within treatments was for the use of rocks in sympatry (table 2). bonferroni post hoc tests showed that the use of rocks during the day differed between allopatry and visual treatments, sympatry and visual treatments, and sympatry and odour treatments, but the use of rocks during the night did not differ between any pairwise combinations of the treatments (table 3, fig. 3). table 1. paired t-test comparisons of between day and night for each treatment (bold, p £ 0.05). the total time moving by bullies treatment bully sympatry odour visual t )2.498 )3.532 0.307 )0.703 d.f. 3 3 3 3 p 0.088 0.039 0.779 0.533 fig. 2. mean (+se) time moving during the day (grey) and night (black) by bullies for each treatment. 59 jellyman et al. table 2. paired t-test comparisons of the use of rocks by bullies between day and night (diel) for each treatment (bold, p < 0.05). treatment allopatry sympatry odour visual t 2.324 4.692 )1.277 )0.147 d.f. 3 3 3 3 p 0.103 0.018 0.291 0.893 table 3. bonferroni post hoc comparisons of the use of rocks by bullies for various treatments during day and night (bold, p < 0.05). treatment combination allopatry · odour allopatry · sympatry allopatry · visual odour · sympatry odour · visual sympatry · visual day 0.261 1 0.01 0.007 1 0.003 night 1 0.22 0.18 0.67 0.54 1 fig. 3. comparison of diel use of rocks (mean ± se) by bullies between the four treatments (light bars = day, dark bars = night). discussion time moving in allopatry, there were no diel differences in the activity (time moving) of bullies, indicating that the species is equally active by day and night. mcdowall (1990) describes common bullies as the least secretive and cover-seeking of the new zealand freshwater ﬁshes, although larger individuals are more cover- conscious than smaller ones. dietary investigations into this species show that while feeding is mainly during the day, some feeding also takes place at night (sagar & glova 1994; rowe et al. 2001), a ﬁnding consistent with our diel activity results. in contrast to common bullies, longﬁn eels are negatively phototaxic, and their foraging and feeding activity is almost exclusively at night (glova & jellyman 2000; jellyman & sykes 2003). while both longﬁn eels and bullies are described as opportunistic feeders (sagar & eldon 1983; jellyman 1989), longﬁn eels as small as 300–399 mm are known to include 60 ﬁsh in their diet, while ﬁsh dominate the diets of longﬁn eels >700 mm (jellyman 1989). thus, the longﬁn eels used in our trails were potentially piscivorous. eels do not have tearing or slicing teeth and engulf small prey items whole, so their ability to consume particular species is governed by prey size and the eel mouth gape (helfman & clark 1986). the size of bullies used in our study meant that they would have been unlikely to be consumed whole, and any negative interactions associated with the eel would have probably been conﬁned to intimidation (with associated avoidance behaviour) and possibly biting. however, we did not observe any aggressive behav- iour or physical contact by the eels towards bullies, meaning any such impacts would have had to be expressed by less direct changes in bully behaviour. our experiments independently tested the role of vision and odour as possible means of common bullies detecting a potential predator, with the assumption that detection would manifest as changed behaviour. odour and vision are two key senses used by predators to sense prey and vice versa. whereas species like brown tout (s. trutta) rely on vision for drift feeding (hayes et al. 2000), many native species can feed in highly turbid waters (hayes & rutledge 1991; rowe et al. 2003) where they must rely on senses other than vision for location of prey. eels have a highly developed olfactory system (tesch 2003), and odour is probably their primary means of detecting prey. the role of odour has been widely researched in freshwater ﬁsheries, as it is a cue used to variously locate predators or prey, and conspeciﬁcs. the odour of conspeciﬁcs has been shown to be attractive to various new zealand native ﬁsh species, i.e., eels: mccleave & jellyman (2002); bluegill bullies gobiomorphus hubbsi, atkinson & joy (2008), and a range of galaxiid species (baker & montgomery 2001; baker & hicks 2003). odour is also used by potential prey species to detect the presence of a predator, and there are a number of ﬁeld observations and experi- ments that record the antipredator responses of inver- tebrates to ﬁsh odour (e.g., mcintosh & peckarsky 1996, 2004). in new zealand, differential responses of invertebrates to the presence of predatory ﬁsh have been observed (mcintosh & townsend 1995a,b) although the mechanisms have yet to be determined. the role of odour as a cue to the presence of predators has been demonstrated for several native species. thus, three ‘types’ of nonmigratory galaxiids all exhibited changes in behaviour in the presence of juvenile brown_trout (edge et al. 1993), and whitebait (galaxias maculatus) avoided water containing short- ﬁn eel (a. australis) odour but not rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) odour (mclean et al. 2007). in contrast to the latter study, adult g. maculatus displayed antipredator behaviour when they were impacts of longﬁn eels on the behaviour of common bullies exposed to visual or chemical stimuli from rainbow trout (milano et al. 2010). freshwater crayﬁsh (para- nephrops zealandicus) modiﬁed their behaviour in the presence of brown_trout but especially in the presence of longﬁn eels, and high local concentrations of longﬁn skin mucus alone produced some response (shave et al. 1994). in the present study, the presence of an eel affected bully activity such that night activity was greater than day activity. while it was uncertain what this increased activity represented, one possibility was that in the presence of a potential predator, bullies were more wary and spent time avoiding contact with the eel. common bullies exhibited changed behaviour in the presence of perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) odour (kriestensen & closs 2004); higher levels of bully activity appeared to be a fright response to the presence of this potential predator. the changes in activity between day and night in the present study could not be attributed to either lack of odour or visual cues alone. reliance on a single cue could be a risky strategy as the effectiveness of vision is limited by turbidity, light levels, and visual acuity (wisenden 2000), while predators can also use concealment to approach prey. while odour is not affected by these factors, it is directional and does not provide adequate warning of the approach of a predator from downstream. the lack of response to denial of either odour or visual cues in our trials leaves open the possibility that a response by bullies requires multiple cues. thus, while bullies were generally unaffected by the presence of an eel, when they were denied either visual or olfactory cues, they became somewhat uncertain. perhaps the cue available to them indicated the possible presence of an eel, but the lack of reinforcement by way of another cue meant they were unable to conﬁrm the eel’s presence, and this resulted in a level of uncertainty. multiple cues can reinforce behavioural responses – for instance, juvenile pike (esox lucius) and stickle- backs (gasterosteus aculeatus) were able to detect a predator by chemical signals, but combined chemical and visual cues resulted in stronger and more diverse responses (lehtiniemi 2005). it is also highly likely that tactile perception is another conﬁrming cue for bullies, as freshwater ﬁsh perceive information about their surroundings through their lateral line system (e.g., montgomery et al. 1997; lundvall et al. 1999); this cue was also absent from both the visual and olfactory trials although we were not able to isolate it in our experimental design. use of rocks the rocks in the present study appeared to offer a vantage point, and there were frequent interactions by bullies to displace an incumbent. again though, the only signiﬁcant outcome of this analysis was a daytime increased use of rocks in sympatry and allopatry as opposed to when either visual or odour cues were denied. seemingly, absence of a complete ‘suite’ of cues to the bullies resulted in some changed behaviour, but behaviour was unchanged when the eel was present (sympatry) or not (allopatry). the lack of difference at night was unexpected as it was antici- pated that odour cues would be more inﬂuential at night, whereas visual cues would be noneffective. again, the lack of response to odour may have been because bullies require additional cues to respond to the presence of an eel. a possible explanation for the lack of difference in response to sympatry and the visual in separate compartment) at night could be that bullies have substantial night vision and even in virtual darkness were able to see the eel. certainly, bullies are known to feed in very low light conditions associated with turbid lakes (rowe 1999; rowe et al. 2003) when are assumed to use nonvisual senses to feed (rowe & dean 1998). (i.e., denial of odour but eel treatment an unexpected result was the overall lack of obvious avoidance behaviour by bullies in the pres- ence of a potential predator. this contrasts with the behavioural changes shown by common bullies in response to the odour of perch, another potential predator (kriestensen & closs 2004). overall, our study suggests that the relationship between medium- sized longﬁn eels and common bullies is relatively benign, and both species are able to coexist with apparently little negative interaction despite bullies sometimes being predated upon by longﬁn eels in the wild (cairns 1942; jellyman 1989). longﬁn eels of the size used are not obligatory piscivores, but are opportunist scavengers, and ﬁsh is only one compo- nent of their diet. we were unable to fully prove our hypotheses as we did not observe deliberate avoidance of eels by bullies although there was increased nocturnal activity of bullies in sympatry with an eel. the use of rocks was different during the day when either odour or visual cues were denied, but there was no evidence that odour cues were more inﬂuential at night than during the day. there are a number of mechanisms that could reduce the risk of predation to bullies: avoidance of cover during the day, diel habitat shifts and the ability of bullies to perceive whether an eel is satiated or hungry. as longﬁn eels are largely ambush predators and use cover-like weed beds for concealment (burnet 1969), avoidance of such areas, especially during the day, could reduce the likelihood of bullies being eaten. different day- and night-time habitat preferences are known for longﬁns with a much higher use of rifﬂes during night (jellyman & sykes 2003) – whether 61 jellyman et al. common bullies show diel habitat shifts is unknown, but such shifts have been recorded from other native species including upland bullies (davey et al. in press) and nonmigratory galaxiids (crow et al. 2010). a number of studies on olfactory cues in ﬁsh have shown that prey species are often able to detect when the diet of a predator includes their own species (brown & zachar 2002; brown 2003; brown & magnavacca 2003); it would be interesting to see whether bullies exhibit such a response – if bullies are able to do this, they might be less concerned by the presence of an eel when its odour (or odour of faeces) did not contain odour of their conspeciﬁcs. given the relative indifference of bullies to the presence of an eel in the present study, it would be of interest to see whether larger longﬁn eels elicited a greater response. acknowledgements we thank our niwa colleagues mark crump, rod mckay and steve de lima for assistance with the electronics and brian fredric and josh bean for help with
