university of benghaazi; libyan embassy - uk; mexican council for science and technology (conacyt) abstract the development of the respiratory surfaces was compared in two sympatric, lacus- trine morphs of arctic charr. a macrobenthic invertebrate feeding specialist, that for- ages in the littoral benthic zone, had a gill cavity that was 54% larger in volume and had 31% greater respiratory surface area than that of a zooplankton feeding morph that forages in the pelagic zone. the large respiratory surface area in the benthic- feeding form was the result of longer gill arches, more and longer gill filaments and more nu- merous secondary lamellae. the difference in gill cavity volume and filament length appears to be the result of a larger head, but not body size, in the benthic- feeding form. this suggests that differences in these characteristics may have arisen as a by- product of the expression of larger head size commonly described in macrobenthos foraging specialist charr. the other differences, particularly the more numerous sec- ondary lamellae and the length of the gill arches, were not the result of head size dif- ferences between morphs, and thus, these are most likely an adaptation to greater respiratory requirements. benthic- feeding fish may have a greater respiratory capacity to allow them to forage in areas with lower levels of dissolved oxygen and/or engage in a more active lifestyle compared to the pelagic- feeding form. in any event, the strik- ingly larger respiratory surface is likely to impose an additional ionoregulatory stress on the benthic- feeding and thus may represent a hidden physiological cost of speciali- sation for foraging on benthic prey. k e y w o r d s divergence, ecomorphs, evolution, polymorphism 1 |  introduction trophic polymorphisms, the coexistence of individuals of a single species exhibiting different phenotypes and specialising in differ- ent food resources (noakes, 2008), provide useful insights into the costs and benefits of alternative niche utilisation. in addition, as they represent an early step in the process of speciation, trophic polymorphisms also provide an important model contributing to our understanding of the role of feeding ecology in the speciation process (bolnick et al., 2003; maerz, myers, & adams, 2006; white, ernest, kerkhoff, & enquist, 2007). sympatric trophic morphs are relatively common among fish, particularly in high latitude post- glacial lakes, being reported in, for example, three- spined stickle- back (gasterosteus aculeatus) (schluter & mcphail, 1992), whitefish (coregonus_lavaretus) (bernatchez, vuorinen, bodaly, & dodson, 1996; kahilainen & ostbye, 2006; siwertsson et al., 2012) and 732  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:732–736. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdarctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) (klemetsen et al., 2003; snorrason et al., 1994). specialisation for feeding on either littoral macrobenthos or pelagic- living zooplankton prey in fish is associated with anatomical differences in the structures required to find and process food. in gen- eral fish that feed mainly on small pelagic prey have smaller, less robust heads, larger eyes and longer, more numerous gill rakers than do those feeding on larger benthic prey (adams et al., 1998; fraser, adams, & huntingford, 1998; lavin & mcphail, 1986; snorrason et al., 1994). as utilising different types of prey frequently take foragers into different habitats, there may also be associated differences in biological sys- tems that are not directly related to feeding. for example, feeding on benthic rather than pelagic- living prey might potentially expose fish to water with low levels of dissolved oxygen (wetzel & likens, 1991). on the other hand, the active lifestyle of pelagic- feeding fish may generate higher oxygen requirements. both of these effects to could potentially increase the need to acquire oxygen, so specialisations for benthic and pelagic feeding may also include differences in respiratory structures. although overall gill architecture is conserved among teleost fish, considerable between- species variation has been reported in fine structure, related both to the metabolic demands of the fish concerned and to the oxygen content of the water in which they live (palzenberger & pohla, 1992). in general, active fishes with high ox- ygen requirements have longer gill filaments (primary lamellae) and more secondary lamellae than do sedentary fish (hughes, 1984). species that live in water with low- oxygen concentrations tend to have a relatively large gill surface area, gained through increases in the number and length of both gill filaments and secondary lamellae (chapman, gales, & shinn, 2000; timmerman & chapman, 2004). given the likelihood that the respiratory requirements and/or the oxygen availability of specialists foraging on macrobenthos and zoo- plankton are likely to differ, the main aim of the study presented here was to quantify and compare the respiratory apparatus of two sympatric specialist feeding morphs of arctic charr. 2 |  materials and methods the fish used in this study were arctic charr belonging to two sympa- tric, lacustrine forms from loch awe, scotland, that exhibit temporal segregation in spawning times (alexander & adams, 2000; kettle- white, 2001), are genetically segregated and differ in body and head shape (garduño- paz, adams, verspoor, knox, & harrod, 2012). the spring spawning morph feeds primarily on macrobenthos (henceforth, the benthic- feeding form); the autumn spawning morph specialises in foraging on zooplankton in the pelagic zone (henceforth the pelagic- feeding form (garduño- paz et al., 2012)). ten pelagic- feeding and 14 benthic- feeding fish were collected during the spawning seasons of 2006/2007. the fish were killed by an overdose of benzocaine fol- lowed by a blow to the head, frozen and transported to the laboratory (glasgow university’s scottish centre for ecology and the natural environment) for subsequent morphometric analysis.     |  733 for each fish, body length and head length were measured. the four gill arches from each side of the head were then dissected out, placed in 0.9% formal saline and the gills excised, keeping the fila- ments intact. using a binocular microscope at a magnification of 3x (after hughes, 1984), the following measurements were then made for each of the right and left side gill arches: arch length and number and length (to the nearest 0.01 mm) of all gill filaments. in addition, for every tenth gill filament, the secondary lamellae were counted over a random 1 mm length of the filament and measurements taken of the length of three lamellae (to the nearest 0.01 mm) located at each of the tip, middle and base of the filament. correlations between left and right gill arches and across the four gill arches were positive and high for all variables (p < .05), so these were combined into a single mean value for further analysis. the overall development of the respiratory surface was estimated using an adaptation of hughes’ (1984) formula: a = l.n.b.l where: a is total gill surface area in mm², l is the total (summed) length of all the filaments (mm), n is the number of the secondary lamellae on both sides of the filaments (mm) and b.l is the average bilateral area (breadth x length) of the secondary lamellae (mm²). as b could not be measured, b = 1 was used for all fish. as a result “a” provides an index of relative gill surface area, rather than an absolute measure of gill area. gill cavity volume was estimated using a method modified after okuda, miyazaki, and yanagisawa (2002). a mould of the buccal and gill cavity combined was prepared by injecting silicon into the fish mouth under constant pressure until the entire mouth cavity was full, leaving the mouth slightly opened and the operculum closed. the mould was left to dry for 20 mins with the fish on ice. the buccal and gill cavity sections of the mould were separated by dissection and the volume of the gill cavity (ml) determined by water displacement. duplicate mea- surements were taken for each mould and the mean used for further analysis. all data were checked for normality and transformed where nec- essary. although body length did not differ significantly between morphs (table 1), the mean for the benthic- feeding form was slightly higher than that of the pelagic form. to examine more clearly the mechanisms that may be driving any differences in respiratory struc- ture between morphs, respiratory variables showing a significant dif- ference between morphs as uncorrected variables, were regressed on body size and for those variables showing significant regressions, residuals were derived providing a measure of the respiratory vari- able independent of body size (reist, 1985; adams & huntingford, 2004; table 1). to test further for the potential influence of head size (independently of body size) on the respiratory variables which showed significant between- morph differences when corrected for body size, respiratory variable on body size residuals were then regressed on head length. for those variables showing significant regressions, residuals were derived providing a measure of the respiratory variable independent of both body size and head size (reist, 1985;

residuals were used to provide measures corrected for both body size and head length (table 1). following this, benthic- feeding fish still had significantly longer gill arches, and because the number of secondary lamellae was not correlated with body or head size, significantly more secondary lamella and as a consequence more extensive overall gill development than did pelagic- feeding fish. 4 |  discussion although small sample sizes, the analysis here provides relatively clear and consistent results. this study shows that, in the loch awe sys- tem, benthic- feeding arctic charr have a more extensively developed jenjan et al.respiratory structure than the sympatric pelagic- feeding fish. thus gill cavity volume, gill arch length, filament length and number and secondary lamella number all contribute to a greater gill surface area in the benthic- feeding charr. evans and colleagues (evans, praebel, peruzzi, amundsen, & bernatchez, 2014) have shown a similar effect in lake whitefish, where, across multiple sites, a “dwarf” morph feeding in the pelagic zone had consistently more extensive respiratory capac- ity than sympatric morphs living in the benthic zone. although in the study described here most of the respiratory anatomy features were correlated with body size, once the effect of size was accounted for morph differences (with the exception of filament length) remained. however, the benthic- feeding morph here, in common with similar morphs described elsewhere (see e.g. adams et al., 1998, 2006; fraser et al., 1998) had a larger head size for a given body length than the pelagic- feeding morph. the evidence of this study is that the larger respiratory structures in the benthic- feeding morph are partly associ- ated with this larger head. thus, the length of the gill filaments and longer secondary lamellae is correlated with head size and when head length is allowed for, between- morph differences for these variables disappears. this indicates that these between morph gill structure dif- ferences are by- product of the larger head size in benthic- feeding fish. other differences (in arch length and the number of secondary lamel- lae, and consequently in overall gill development) remain, indicating that, for these structures, differences are occurring independently of the available room for accommodating larger structures in these fish. the observed difference in respiratory development (independent of head size) may well constitute an inherited specialisation (as it is in the sailfin molly, poecilia latipinna (timmerman & chapman, 2004)). if so this has emerged relatively recently, over the 12,000- year period during which these morphs have diverged (garduño- paz et al., 2012). alternatively, they may reflect plastic changes in gill structure in re- sponse to oxygen conditions during development, as reported in rain- bow trout, (oncorhynchus_mykiss) (peters, hoffmann, & klinger, 1984). data from this study do not allow these possibilities to be distinguished, but however, these differences have arisen, they probably reflect dif- ferential oxygen demands and availability amongst the two special- ist feeding morphs. in terms of energy expenditure, pelagic- dwelling charr feeding on zooplankton patches probably swims more actively to find food than littoral dwelling macrobenthos feeders. “dwarf” lake whitefish that occupy the pelagic zone and are active swimmers have higher expression of genes involved in energy production and muscle contractility compared to “normal” whitefish that forage on benthic prey and are less active (derome, duchesne, & bernatchez, 2006; evans et al., 2014; st- cyr, derome, & bernatchez, 2008). on the other hand, the clumped, predictable and thus defensible nature of the food of benthic- feeding fish potentially makes monopolising food both possible and profitable (grant, 1997). evans and colleagues showed that of red blood cells in profundal feeding european white- fish (coregonus_lavaretus) were larger than those of sympatric littoral arctic charr specialised for feeding in macrobenthos are more aggres- sive towards conspecifics than are zooplankton feeding fish from the same lake (mikheev, adams, huntingford, & thorpe, 1996). fighting is energetically expensive, so the more extensive respiratory surface in     |  735 benthic- feeding fish in the present study could reflect this behavioural difference (neat, taylor, & huntingford, 1998). alternatively, or addi- tionally, it could arise because their foraging habitat (among detritus in shallow water at the lake edge) may expose them to low- oxygen levels (wetzel & likens, 1991). conversely constant swimming activity in the pelagic zone might also allow a pelagic- living charr to use ram ventilation to actively perfuse gills thus reducing the need for a large gill surface area. steffensen (1985) showed a 10% reduction in en- ergy costs associated with ram ventilation in rainbow trout compared with active ventilation. in addition a larger gill surface area imposes a greater ionoregulatory and osmoregulatory challenge for the fish con- cerned. in some cases up to 40% of the energy expenditure of teleosts is related to osmoregulation and ionoregulation (see e.g. febry & lutz, 1987). this plus the high costs of gill tissue maintenance resulting from very rapid protein turnover in this tissue (lyndon & houlihan, 1998) mean that there are significant energetic costs in maintaining a large gill structure. thus, there should be considerable energetic advantage in reducing gill size if, as seems to be the case for the pelagic- feeding morph examined here, respiratory needs can be met. we speculatively conclude that this is possible for the pelagic- living morph because it reducing highly energetically costly food resource defence, utilising the efficiencies of ram ventilation and/or occupying habitats with higher dissolved oxygen. whatever the underlying driving force, gill size has potentially important implications for the balance of costs and benefits of adopting alternative feeding specialisations and hence for the evolution of trophic polymorphism in teleost fishes. acknowledgements we thank alan kettle- white, richard mckenzie, the argyll fishery trust and the loch awe improvement association for sampling support. hussein jenjan was supported financially by the libyan embassy- uk and by the university of benghazi (garyounis), monica garduño- paz was supported by was supported by a mexican council for science and technology (conacyt) scholarship. orcid colin e. adams http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2470-9754 references adams, c. e., fraser, d., huntingford, f. a., greer, r. b., askew, c. m., & walker, a. f.
