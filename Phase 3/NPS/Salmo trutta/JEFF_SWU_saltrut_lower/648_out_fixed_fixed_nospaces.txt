(1994) characterised the ‘restricted movement paradigm’ in which individuals, usually adult ﬁsh, remained within the stream reach (20– 50 m) of original capture throughout most of their lives. contrary to this characterisation, funk (1957) advocated that populations are comprised of sub- groups with most individuals remaining sedentary and a smaller group of individuals dispersing long distances. however, recent studies have shown that individual ﬁsh exhibit plastic movement responses to various factors (smithson & johnston 1999; petty & grossman 2004; alldredge et al. 2011). stream ﬁshes exhibit high variability in movement related to various environmental and biological fac- tors (albanese et al. 2004; petty & grossman 2004; roberts & angermeier 2007). stream ﬂow and den- sity of conspeciﬁcs have been reported to inﬂuence movement of mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi) in a southern appalachian stream (petty & grossman 2004). many ﬁshes also undergo ontogenetic shifts in feeding habits, and changing resource requirements may necessitate use of a broad array of habitats to survive and mature (schlosser 1995; henderson & johnston 2010). resource requirements of different species and size classes are often met through move- ment from ‘lower’ quality habitats to habitats more conducive to increased growth and reproduction (schlosser 1991; matheny & rabeni 1995; schlosser & angermeier 1995; smithson & johnston 1999). overall, headwater streams are highly dynamic; creating variable habitat patches that may uniquely inﬂuence a ﬁsh’s movement response (labbe & fausch 2000). we studied the movement patterns of a small cyprinid, southern redbelly dace (chrosomus erythrogaster), indicative of headwater streams of the ozark mountains, usa. the objectives of the study were to (i) describe ontogenetic variation in move- ment patterns between juvenile and adult dace and (ii) to examine the movement patterns of a ﬁsh adapted to headwater streams within a complex tem- plate of isolation and connection. materials and methods study area an in situ mark–recapture study was conducted between august 2009 and july 2010 in an intermittent, headwater reach of north sylamore creek, a second- order tributary of the white river. north sylamore creek is located in the ozark-st. francis national forest and ﬂows eastward through baxter and stone county, arkansas, usa (fig. 1). this region was characterised by karst geology, resulting in springs largely dependent on recent rainfall to increase sur- face ﬂow and connectivity. streams within north syl- amore creek watershed were relatively undisturbed and ranged from having clear, perennial, spring-fed sections consisting of rifﬂes, runs, glides and pools to sections having intermittent surface ﬂow with isolated pools. several species of ﬁsh were abundant through- out north sylamore creek: stoneroller (campostoma spp.), southern redbelly dace (chrosomus erythrogas- ter), duskystripe shiner (luxilus pilsbryi), horneyhead chub (nocomis biguttatus), creek chub (semotilus atromaculatus), rainbow darter (etheostoma caeru- leum) and orangethroat darter (etheostoma specta- bile). the mark–recapture study reach, located in the upstream portion of north sylamore creek, consisted of longitudinally oriented sections in cole fork and birmingham hollow (tributary of cole fork; fig. 1). north sylamore creek was characterised as a year- round mid-reach drying stream with a predictable hydrologic regime. a mid-reach drying stream is cre- ated by an upstream and downstream contiguous reach with a considerable distance of dry streambed in between that is only connected via surface ﬂow following heavy rain events (lake 2003). the entire study reach was approximately 5 km long from the lowest pool in cole fork to the farthest upstream pool in birmingham hollow. the study reach was divided into stream sections comprised of pools grouped together based on their hydrology (i.e., con- nected and isolated) and longitudinal position. the most downstream section (1) of cole fork was spring-fed and comprised of four connected pools (fig. 1). sections 2 and 3 were upstream in cole fork and consisted of three and six pools, respec- tively, that were hydrologically isolated from each other. section 4 was located in birmingham hollow and included three isolated pools. sections 5 and 6 were hydrologically connected via surface ﬂow; how- ever, they were separated by a 4-m vertical barrier, which inhibited upstream movement but did not limit downstream movement. sections 5 and 6 consisted of two and ﬁve connected pools, respectively. for data analyses, sections 1, 5 and 6 were grouped as ‘con- nected sections’. sections 2, 3 and 4 were grouped as ‘isolated sections’ because pools in these sections remained isolated from one another until heavy rain events increased surface ﬂow. throughout the study, connected pools always remained connected, while isolated pools were only connected when discharge 217 walker et al. n natural barrier 6 5 4 b i r m i n g h a m h o l l o w  3 2 cole fork 1 0 0.3 0.6 1.2 km fig. 1. map of study reach in north sylamore creek showing sections sampled during the mark–recapture study from august 2009 to july 2010. numbers represent stream section in ascending order from downstream to upstream. connected sections of the stream are represented by solid black lines, while isolated sections are represented by the broken grey lines. exceeded approximately 2825 m3s  1 on the down- stream united states geological survey gauge 07060710 located near fifty six, ar. when dis- charge exceeded 2825 m3s  1, all habitats became longitudinally connected and these connection events generally lasted 3–5 days depending on the duration and magnitude of precipitation events. when ﬂows decreased back to base ﬂow conditions, isolated pools once again became isolated. all stream sections were comprised of that large amounts of gravel shifted during high ﬂows and exposed bedrock. collecting and marking southern redbelly dace larger than 30 mm sl (stan- dard length) were given pool-speciﬁc batch marks (northwest marine technology, inc.). pools were 218 differentiated using combinations of six body loca- tions and six elastomer colours (total = 36 codes). the initial marking sample began august 2009; every pool within the study reach (n = 23) as well as all runs and rifﬂes between pools in connected sections were sampled. fish collections began in section 1, progressing upstream to section 6. in the connected sections, block nets were placed at upstream and downstream ends of each pool to keep ﬁsh contained during sampling. a three-pass 1.52 9 4.57 m seines depletion method, (3.18-mm mesh), was utilised. each seine haul was placed in separate ﬂow-through mesh containers that allowed ﬁsh to remain in ambient water condi- tions until further processing. captured ﬁshes were then anesthetised with ms-222, weighed (0.01 g) and measured for sl (1.0 mm). following recovery using movement patterns of southern redbelly dace in an ozark stream from anaesthesia, all ﬁshes were released back into the pool of capture. subsequent mark–recapture samples were con- ducted in all pools during january, march and may 2010, with a ﬁnal recapture sample in july 2010. methodology similar to the initial marking sample in august 2009 was used during subsequent samples. recaptured ﬁsh that did not exhibit movement were measured without further marking. fish recaptured in a different pool were given an additional mark unique to the new pool of capture, and unmarked ﬁsh were given the unique mark to identify the pool of capture. all ﬁsh were then released back to the pool of capture. recapture data in ‘march’ dace movement patterns were examined on a per interval basis with month of recapture (january, march, may and july) used to reﬂect movements that occurred between each mark–recapture sample. for example, reﬂect movements between the january and march mark– recapture samples. fish recaptured outside the pool of previous capture were classiﬁed as ‘movers’, while those persisting in the pool of previous cap- ture were considered ‘residents’. residency was cal- culated as the total number of residents divided by the total number of marked individuals from the previous sampling event and multiplied by 100 (petty & grossman 2004). ontogenetic patterns- residency rates were calcu- lated for juveniles (individuals 30–39 mm sl) and adults (individuals  40 mm) for each mark–recap- ture sample. size groups were deﬁned based on a study carried out on the reproductive biology of southern redbelly dace in a kentucky stream (settles & hoyt 1978). residency rates were compared between juvenile and adult dace and examined sepa- rately for each size group to test for differences among mark–recapture samples using log-likelihood goodness-of-ﬁt tests (bonferroni adjusted; a = 0.025) (petty & grossman 2004). kurtosis patterns (displacement) were estimated by size group for each mark–recapture sample. follow- ing skalski & gilliam (2000), gilliam & fraser (2001) and petty & grossman (2004), kurtosis val- ues for each size group were analysed using the advection–diffusion framework. individuals recap- tured in the pool of previous marking were given a movement distance of zero, while individuals recap- tured outside their pool of previous marking were attributed a positive (upstream) or negative (down- stream) distance value (m) equal to the distance between the midpoint of their original pool to the midpoint of their recapture pool. one-sample t-tests were used to examine deviations from zero of mean signed distance moved (m), calculated for each size group and mark–recapture combination sample (a = 0.05). standard deviation of signed movement was calculated by size group for each mark–recap- ture sample to compare variation in population spread. comparisons of mean unsigned distance moved were conducted to explore additional varia- tions in movement. abiotic factors- to investigate potential relation- ships between hydrology and movement, we exam- ined movement within and among connected and isolated sections. analyses were conducted separately for juvenile and adult dace using data combined across all mark–recapture samples to investigate overall movement patterns including residents in iso- lated and connected stream sections, proportion of movers between pools within the same section (intra- movement) and proportion of movers from one section to another (intermovement). comparisons were made using log-likelihood goodness-of-ﬁt tests (a = 0.05). in addition, the proportion of adult immi- grants and emigrants was calculated for each mark– recapture sample to qualitatively assess temporal changes in movement patterns between sections. temporal patterns in the proportion of juvenile immi- grants and emigrants were not assessed due to limited intermovement. transects handheld dissolved cross-sectional following each mark–recapture event, a suite of water quality and habitat variables were measured. number of high-ﬂow event days, those above 2825 m3s  1 on the usgs gauge (07060710), was calculated corresponding to each recapture sample. using the number of high-ﬂow event days between mark–recapture samples provided a conservative estimate for the number of days ﬁsh in isolated pools could move to another pool. dissolved oxy- gen and water temperature were measured using a ysi-85 oxygen/conductivity instrument. habitat variables were measured along multiple in each pool, where the number of transects varied (3–5) based on pool size. measurements of depth (cm), sub- strate and cover will be taken at 0.5-m intervals along each transect. during the initial marking sam- ple, velocity was measured in connected habitats at each point along the lowest transect using a marsh- mcbirney model 201m portable water current meter. discharge was then calculated as the sum of the products of depth, width and velocity. total ﬁsh density was calculated as the number of ﬁshm  2 within each pool based on the three-pass depletion method. correlation analyses were then used to determine whether there were any signiﬁcant associ- ations between the proportion of intermovers in connected and isolated habitats and any of the mea- sured water quality or habitat variables. alpha lev- els comparisons were bonferroni adjusted. for multiple 219 walker et al. results  2) between august 2009 and july 2010, we marked 7546 individual southern redbelly dace within the the mark–recapture 5-km study reach. throughout study, average abundance of dace was signiﬁcantly higher in connected (2802.75  388.1) stream sec- tions compared with isolated (377.75  103.5) sec- tions (two-sample t-test; d.f. = 3.4, t = 6.04, p = 0.006). furthermore, ﬁsh density was signiﬁcantly higher on average in connected (2.07  1.55 ﬁsh  2) sections compared with isolated (1.14  1.56 m ﬁshm (two-sample t-test; d.f. =79.2, t = 2.75, p = 0.007). number of recaptures varied temporally and was highest in may (70%), intermedi- ate in march (51%) and lowest in january (23%) and july (31%; table 1). within recaptured dace, per- centage of residents varied across mark–recapture samples, ranging from 57% in july to as high as 84% in march (table 1). overall, most recaptured dace were considered residents (68%), while 32% were movers. of those individuals that moved, 84% were recaptured in neighbouring pools within the same stream section, while 16% moved greater distances. sections overall, pool characteristics (average depth and volume) and water quality were more stable in con- nected pools compared with isolated pools. pool characteristics were similar for both connected and isolated pools during the january, march and may mark–recapture samples. during the july mark– recapture sample, pool characteristics and water qual- ity decreased in isolated pools compared with con- nected pools. in january, average depth of isolated pools (25.51  6.85 cm) was slightly higher than in connected pools (22.90  9.03 cm). by july, aver- age depth had reduced in isolated pools (15.64  5.09 cm) compared with connected pools (26.13  13.12 cm). pool volume was similar in connected and isolated pools during the january sample (41.97  25.71 m3 43.96  27.84 m3, respectively). by july, volume of isolated pools (33.62  25.34 m3) was much lower on average than the volume of connected pools (50.42  31.20 m3). and on in isolated average connected compared with in situ dissolved oxygen values during the summer months (july) tended to be lower in isolated pools (6.27  0.41) pools (8.76  0.28). additionally, water temperatures were higher pools (26.05  2.38 °c) compared with connected pools (20.63  2.53 °c). ontogenetic patterns –each size group displayed variability in residency rates, kurtosis values, dis- tances moved and population spread (sd). although juvenile residency rates tended to be higher than adults for all mark–recapture samples, they were not signiﬁcantly different from an expected 1:1 ratio within each mark–recapture sample (log-likelihood goodness-of-ﬁt; table 2). furthermore, residency rates were not signiﬁcantly different across mark– juveniles (g = 4.62; recapture samples for either d.f. = 3; p = 0.202) or adults (g = 5.88; d.f. = 3; p = 0.117). variability in kurtosis depended upon size group as well as mark–recapture sample. kurtosis values of both juvenile and adult dace movement revealed lep- tokurtosis patterns for all mark–recapture samples (table 3; fig. 2). juvenile displacement (as indicated by kurtosis) varied ranging from 5.77 in july to table 2. residency rates for juvenile and adult southern redbelly dace in the headwaters of north sylamore creek. residency rate refers to the proportion of individuals that remained sedentary. p-values resulted from a comparison of juvenile and adult residency rates within a mark–recapture sample (log-likelihood goodness-of-ﬁt). n residency rate (%) p-value january juveniles adults march juveniles adults may juveniles adults july juveniles adults 143 746 211 681 57 1107 250 752 0.72 0.67 0.88 0.83 0.75 0.65 0.60 0.55 0.734 0.094 0.579 0.139 table 1. number of southern redbelly dace >30 mm sl captured in north sylamore creek during each mark–recapture sample. number newly marked was based on the number of individuals captured and marked for the ﬁrst time. values in parentheses represent percentages. sampling trip fall 2009 january 2010 march 2010 may 2010 july 2010 number captured number (%)* of recaptures number (%)† of residents number (%)† of movers number (%) newly marked 3884 1745 1664 3202 1339 889 (23) 893 (51) 1166 (70) 1002 (31) 601 (68) 749 (84) 768 (66) 571 (57) 288 (32) 145 (16) 398 (34) 431 (43) 856 (49) 770 (46) 2036 (64) *percentage of total number recaptured from previous mark–recapture sample †percentage of total number recaptured for each mark–recapture sample. 220 movement patterns of southern redbelly dace in an ozark stream table 3. summary statistics of southern redbelly dace movement from north sylamore creek. signed movement reﬂects mean upstream (+) and downstream ( ) movements. kurtosis represents the displacement distribution exhibited by each size group for each mark–recapture sample. unsigned movement refers to the absolute value of distance moved. signed movement unsigned movement mean (m) n sd kurtosis mean (m) se median january juveniles adults march 143  2.19 13.86 746 45.66 522.96 juveniles adults 211 681 2.34 16.01 43.43 235.30 may juveniles adults july juveniles adults 57 10.67 1107 16.60 250  2.53 88.08* 752 81.28 411.32 53.97 531.91 one-sample t-test, p < 0.001 6.30 62.06 28.00 87.26 29.59 49.73 5.77 33.31 20.4 104.2 3.4 18.8 62.0 67.0 12.2 43.2 2.8 8.9 84.0 135.0 25.5 99.7 10.3 12.0 32.0 135.0 26.6 148.2 3.0 18.9 32.0 122.5 29.59 in may. adult dace demonstrated greater vari- ability in displacement, ranging from 33.31 in july to as high as 87.26 in march (table 3; fig. 2). more- over, kurtosis was numerically greater for adult dace compared with juveniles (table 3). movement distances and population spread ﬂuctu- ated across mark–recapture samples for both juveniles and adults. actual distances moved for juveniles ran- ged from as short as 18.0 m to as far as 523.0 m (fig. 2). in contrast, adult movement ranged from 18.0 to 5791.0 m, spanning the entire study reach. mean signed distance moved was not signiﬁcantly different from zero for juveniles in any mark–recap- ture sample and ranged from  2.19 to 10.67 m (one- sample t-test; all p > 0.326; table 3). adult dace had higher variability in mean signed distance moved, ranging from 13.86 m in january to 88.08 m in july and displayed a signiﬁcant upstream bias only in the july mark–recapture sample (one-sample t-test, d.f. = 751, p < 0.001; table 3; fig. 2). juvenile dace dis- played consistently lower population spread (sd of signed movements), ranging from 43.43 m in march to 81.28 m in may, while adults exhibited higher population spread from 235.30 m in march to 531.91 m in july (table 3). juveniles also moved shorter distances, with mean unsigned distance moved ranging from 12.2 m to 26.6 m compared with adult dace (ranging from 43.2 to 148.2 m) (table 3). abiotic factors- the overall proportion of resident juvenile (g = 0.74; d.f. = 1; p = 0.390) and adult (g = 2.43; d.f. = 1; p = 0.119) dace was similar in isolated sections compared with connected sections (fig. 3). when examining movers, both juvenile and adult dace displayed variability in movement patterns as identiﬁed within and among isolated and connected sections. when juvenile movement occurred, it was character- (intra = 172 and ised primarily as intramovement inter = 4; 98%; fig. 3). adult movement was also predominantly intramovement (intra = 914 and inter = 169; 84%). the proportion of intramovement by adult dace in isolated and con- nected stream sections was not signiﬁcantly different (g = 1.64; d.f. = 1; p = 0.201). however, a signiﬁ- cantly higher proportion of adults exhibited intermov- ement isolation compared with connected sections (g = 25.30; d.f. = 1; p < 0.001; fig. 3). from sections of intermovement of adult dace was further examined by qualitatively comparing the proportion of immi- grants and emigrants between stream sections for each mark–recapture sample (see fig. 1 for stream section designation). during january and march, a high proportion (71% and 77%, respectively) of migrants were recaptured in isolated sections 2 and 4, primarily emigrating from the closest connected sections 1 and 5 based on batch tags (fig. 4). while migration in january and march occurred primarily from connected to isolated sections, in may, adult emigration occurred from all stream sections with a trend for upstream migration (upstream emigra- tion = 70%). during the july mark–recapture sample, the proportion of immigrants increased dramatically to 76% for section 5, with 90% of the immigrants migrating upstream from downstream sections and only 10% migrating from section 6. of emigrants in july, 25% migrated from section 1 into section 2, 7% migrated from both sections 2 and 3 into section 5, while 31% migrated from section 4 into section 5. section 1 was the furthest downstream section, and movements downstream of this section could not be detected due to lack of sampling downstream. throughout the mark–recapture study, no immigra- tion occurred into section 6 because of the natural barrier; however, emigration downstream from sec- tion 6 did occur during every interval, but at very low proportions (1–6%; fig. 4). although there were no statistically signiﬁcant associations between the proportions of intermovers from connected and isolated sections and measured water quality and habitat variables, noteworthy trends were observed and these trends were always stronger for connected sections (table 4). the proportion of intermovers in connected sections was negatively associated with number of high-ﬂow event days (r =  0.82, p = 0.18), while the number of high- ﬂow event days was positively correlated with pro- portion of intermovers in isolated sections (r = 0.56, p = 0.44). a positive association existed between average water of (r = 0.87, intermovers in temperature connected and sections proportion 221 walker et al. juveniles 103 186 43 156 y r a u n a j h c r a m y a m l y u j 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 y c n e u q e r f 0 0 6 – 0 0 5 – 0 0 4 – 0 0 3 – 0 0 2 – 0 0 0 1 – 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 adults 498 562 723 416 0 0 8 – 0 0 6 – 0 0 4 – 0 0 0 2 – 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 – 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 > 0 0 0 2 – > displacement (m) fig. 2. displacement distributions of movement distance by recaptured juvenile and adult southern redbelly dace within the entire study reach in north sylamore creek. upstream movements are represented with positive numbers, while negative numbers represent down- stream movements. numbers above the bar at 0 m indicate the actual number of resident individuals during that sample. p = 0.13). there was a moderate negative association between the proportion of intermovers in isolated sec- temperature (r =  0.55, tions and average water p = 0.45). the proportion of intermovers from con- nected sections was negatively correlated with aver- age dissolved oxygen (r =  0.91, p = 0.09). there was a weak positive correlation between the propor- tion of intermovers in isolated sections and average dissolved oxygen (r = 0.46, p = 0.54). there was a 222 and pool and area in isolated average p = 0.25) positive correlation between the proportion of inter- movers connected (r = 0.68, (r = 0.75, p = 0.32) stream sections. total ﬁsh density was negatively associated with the proportion of intermovers from both connected and isolated stream sections (r =  0.95, p = 0.05 and r =  0.36, p = 0.64;

petty & grossman 2004; roberts & an- germeier 2007). many ﬁshes undergo ontogenetic shifts to reduce intraspeciﬁc competition for necessary resources (funk 1957; matthews 1998; petty & grossman 2004; henderson & johnston 2010). petty & gross- man (2004) observed increased movement by juve- niles in relation to increased ﬂow and density of larger adults. although differences in residency rates of southern redbelly dace were not found between size groups for any mark–recapture sample or within size groups across sample dates, each size group exhibited variable movement responses. adults dem- onstrated larger ranges of values for kurtosis, median and sd of distances moved than juveniles. future 50 40 30 20 10 0 50 40 30 20 10 0 40 30 20 10 0 80 60 40 20 0 n o i t r o p o r p 1 downstream january march may july 2 3 4 5 6 upstream immigrant emigrant fig. 4. proportion of adult immigrants and emigrants from each stream section across each mark–recapture trip in north sylamore creek. section numbers are based on longitudinal position from the most downstream to the most upstream section. table 4. results of correlation analyses between independent environmental intermovers from both the connected and variables and proportion of isolated stream sections over the study. correlation coefﬁcients and p-values are provided. the course of section independent variable connected isolated high-ﬂow event days average water temperature (°c) dissolved oxygen (mgl  1) average pool area total ﬁsh density (# ﬁshm high-ﬂow event days average water temperature (°c) dissolved oxygen (mgl  1) average pool area total ﬁsh density (# ﬁshm  2)  2) r2  0.82 0.87  0.91 0.75  0.95 0.56  0.55 0.46 0.68  0.36 p 0.18 0.13 0.09 0.25 0.05 0.44 0.45 0.54 0.32 0.64 studies of ﬁsh movement should consider differences based on size class to fully understand movement dynamics for an entire population. adult dace displayed increased variability in move- ment among individuals compared with juveniles for every mark–recapture sample, based on kurtosis values (skalski & gilliam 2000; fraser et al. 2001; petty & grossman 2004). recent studies have shown that 223 walker et al. individuals exhibit plastic movement responses in rela- tion to different environmental and biological parame- ters (smithson & johnston 1999; alldredge et al. 2011). conﬁrmation of individual variability in the current study was limited because individuals could not be distinguished; nevertheless, kurtosis remains to be a useful analytical tool for assessing variability in movement within a population (i.e., differences between size classes). although we could not distin- guish individuals, it was evident that some individuals did exhibit plastic movement responses. for example, several dace that were marked and recaptured in downstream sections remained sedentary for two con- secutive samples and were then recaptured over 4,000 m upstream during the ﬁnal recapture event. to meet general life history requirements and avoid potential environmental stressors, a species may undergo exploratory movements to assess addi- tional habitats that may beneﬁt an individual’s ﬁtness (clapp et al. 1990; smithson & johnston 1999). as described by the proportion of immigrants and emi- grants between sections for the january and march mark–recapture sample, dace displayed a pattern of movement into the nearest neighbour pool when pos- sible. this behaviour was similar to the ﬁndings of smithson & johnston (1999) for green and longear sunﬁsh in little glazypeau creek in the ouachita highlands, arkansas. high-ﬂow connection events in north sylamore creek generally last 3–5 days, leav- ing a limited amount of time for dace to move and assess alternative habitats. we expected to see more intramovement of adults within connected sections compared with isolated; however, there was no signiﬁcant difference. one limitation of the current study is that intramovement between pools within connected sections could have potentially been underestimated due to the fact that ﬁshes may have been able to move back and forth between pools at anytime during the year. during the initial marking sample in august 2009, ﬁshes were captured and marked in all connecting habitats. we did not, however, sample the connecting habitats dur- ing subsequent mark–recapture samples. even though ﬁshes were observed, they were generally conﬁning to small pockets of water. although connected pools had ﬂow connecting them, habitats were shallow with an average depth of 11.1  4.3 cm and an average discharge of 0.16  0.07 m3s  1, potentially acted as natural barriers except following heavy rain events. schaefer (2001) demonstrated that low current veloc- ity and average depth across rifﬂes in artiﬁcial streams restricted movement and inﬂuenced dispersal capabilities of a species by acting as a natural barrier. fish originating in isolated stream sections exhib- ited greater intermovement compared with ﬁsh origi- nating in connected stream sections, predominately 224 during the months of may and july (fig. 4). increased movement has been correlated with unsuit- able or ‘low-quality” habitats in other ecological studies (power 1987; gilliam & fraser 2001). for example, albanese et al. (2004) showed that 82.4% of nocomis leptocephalus marked in intermittent reaches were capture at downstream perennial sites and moved longer distances through less suitable habitats than those marked in reaches with perennial ﬂow. although resource availability was not exam- ined in the current study, isolated habitats were gen- erally smaller and had lower water quality values compared with connected habitats. the pattern of increased movement from sections of isolation may reﬂect the quality and quantity of resources found in isolated habitats during certain times of the year. in contrast, movements into isolated habitats, found pre- dominately during january and march, may reﬂect exploratory behaviours to ﬁnd additional resources that are required for increased ﬁtness of the individ- ual. unfortunately, this behaviour also comes with the risk of becoming stranded in low-quality habitats that may completely dry (pers. obs.). in addition to seasonal variation in movement between isolated and connected sections, we also observed directional seasonal movement across the study reach. the proportion of immigrants migrating upstream increased during may and july mark–recap- ture samples. several researchers have acknowledged directional bias by stream ﬁshes, and these studies identiﬁed factors inﬂuencing directional bias in a spe- cies (freeman 1995; schlosser 1995; gowan & fausch 1996; skalski & gilliam 2000; roberts & angermeier 2007; copp et al. 2010; alldredge et al. 2011). two potential factors, reproduction and sum- mer drying, could have inﬂuenced upstream move- ment of dace in may and july. reproductive southern redbelly dace have been found in arkansas between mid-april and mid-may, which overlaps with the may and july mark–recapture samples (rob- ison & buchanan 1988). most adult dace were sexu- ally mature during the may sample; however, by july, few individuals were visibly mature. furthermore, the inverse associations between the proportions of inter- movers and ﬁsh density, especially in connected pools, may be explained by the reproductive behav- iours of southern redbelly dace. considering that dace are often aggregate nest associates, this may elucidate the trend found between fewer intermovers from con- nected sections and ﬁsh density with the progression of the reproductive season (settles & hoyt 1978; robison & buchanan 1988). during summer drying in small headwater streams, ﬁsh can be subjected to intense environmental constraints and may respond in accordance with availability of refugia. (taylor 1997; schaefer 2001; hodges & magoulick 2011). during movement patterns of southern redbelly dace in an ozark stream the july recapture sample, average pool volume was in connected sections (52.83  35.08 m3) greater compared with isolated sections (22.34  21.90 m3). between may and july, 76% of the immigrants had moved upstream into connected section 5. dace may have responded to summer drying in north sylamore creek by migrating upstream to higher quality habi- tats. further studies are warranted to determine the role of refuge availability and quality of intermittent streams on ﬁsh movement. ecological correlates affecting ﬁsh movement have been identiﬁed from many different stream ecosys- tems (albanese et al. 2004; petty & grossman 2004; roberts & angermeier 2007; hodges & magoulick 2011). for example, variability in temperature, hydro- logy and availability of refugia during ﬂooding or drought (hall 1972; schlosser 1995; gowan & fausch 1996; labbe & fausch 2000; hodges & magoulick 2011), as well as a ﬁsh’s size, life history and presence of other stream ﬁshes, may play a role in the move- ment of many stream ﬁshes (schaefer 2001; albanese et al. 2004; petty & grossman 2004). during our study, temporal changes in temperature and discharge had a greater inﬂuence on the proportion of intermov- ers in connected pools compared with isolated pools. movement tended to increase with increasing water temperature and decrease with increased number of high-ﬂow event days in connected pools. these trends were the opposite and weaker in isolated pools. despite the lower temperatures and highest degree of connectedness in march and january, ﬁsh in isolated pools may have utilising the increased number of con- nection events for exploratory behaviours to ﬁnd more suitable habitat (e.g., isolated habitats in the study reach tend to have decreased water quality and fewer macroinvertebrate resources from march to july; pers. obs.). these ﬁndings suggest that movement may have been affected by the coupling of temperature and hydrology, and the factor of habitat isolation may also play a role in determining the movement response of ﬁshes. additionally, because dissolved oxygen is lar- gely controlled by temperature and is typically inver- sely related (r =  0.99 in both habitats), the trends found between the proportion of intermovers from connected and isolated sections and average dissolved oxygen could be attributed to this factor. previous studies have found that population turn- over resulting from increased movement and lower recapture rates is a common characteristic of many stream ﬁsh populations (scalet 1973; hill & gross- man 1987; gowan et al. 1994; rodriguez 2002; petty & grossman 2004). dace recapture rates ﬂuctuated throughout this study (23–70%), and there are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. move- ments downstream of the study reach likely occurred; however, these movements could not be determined because samples were not collected downstream of the study reach. if mortality affected recapture rates, it was likely due to natural senescence. in a 125-day laboratory study, ﬁsh survival and growth was not inﬂuenced by our handling and marking. ninety-two dace (89%) survived the duration of the study, and no ﬁsh died within the ﬁrst 82 days of the experi- ment. mark loss was low with 91% of marked indi- viduals retaining their marks, suggesting that mark loss had limited inﬂuence. given that small-bodied, non-game species domi- nate most aquatic communities, and knowledge of most species’ movement patterns is limited (relative to salmonids); further studies are needed to better understand the inﬂuence of various abiotic and biotic factors on movement responses for individual spe- cies. in addition, the inﬂuence of barriers, including those occurring in naturally complex environments such as intermittent headwater streams, is rarely addressed. this is especially important when we con- sider that 59% of total stream length is made up of intermittent streams in the usa, excluding alaska (nadeau & rains 2007), and this is predicted to increase with global climate change (sabater & tockner 2010). southern redbelly dace are uniquely adapted to intermittent headwater streams and may provide some insight into the adaptations and plasticity needed to survive in these habitats. acknowledgements we thank c. johnson, l. stearman, j. larson, s. entrekin, d. mitchell, b. earleywine, g. smith, n. jensen, a. fuell, o. herbst, r. pandey, t. branaman, r. predal, m. uffenbeck, e. kluender, h. richardson, c. miller, l. martindale and c. ful- ler for assistance in the ﬁeld. we would especially like to thank keith whalen and katherine furr from the u.s. forest service for research support and ﬁeld help. funding for this project was provided by the u.s. forest service and univer- sity of central arkansas biology department. references adams, s.b. & warren, m.l. 2005. recolonization by warm- water ﬁshes and crayﬁshes after severe drought in upper coastal plain hill streams. transactions of the american fisheries society 134: 1173–1192. albanese, b., angermeier, p.l. & dorai-raj, s. 2004. ecolog- ical correlates of ﬁsh movement in a network of virginia streams. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 61: 857–869. alldredge, p., gutierrez, m., duvernell, d., schaefer, j., brun- kow, p. & matamoros, w. 2011. variability in movement dynamics of topminnow (fundulus notatus and f. olivac- eus) populations. ecology of freshwater fish 20: 513–521. berra, t.m. & gunning, g.e. 1972. seasonal movement and the longear sunﬁsh, lepomis megalotis home range of 225 walker et al.
