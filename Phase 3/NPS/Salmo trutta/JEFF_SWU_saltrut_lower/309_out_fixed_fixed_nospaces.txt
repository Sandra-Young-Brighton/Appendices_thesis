van densen et al. 1996; xu et al. 2001). size-related differential prey availability may result in different growth rates over time among individuals of the same age-class (keast & eadie 1985; van densen et al. 1996). to grow as fast as possible during the ﬁrst summer is assumed to be a substantial advantage because: (i) it enhances the availability of proﬁtable food that cannot be captured by smaller siblings (e.g. keast & eadie 1985), and (ii) vulnerability to predation by piscivorous birds or ﬁsh strongly decreases with size (e.g. persson et al. 2004). in temperate waters, energy reserves are mainly built up during summer (e.g. hurst et al. 2000), when tem- perature and light intensity enhances primary produc- tion that can be used on higher levels of the food web (wetzel 1983). during times of food shortage in winter, depletion of accumulated energy reserves occurs that could lead to increased mortality risk if unfavourable conditions continue (oliver et al. 1979; post & evans 1989; schultz & conover 1997). especially overwinter mortality is suggested to be a substantial bottleneck for juvenile ﬁshes in temperate waters due to shortage of food in winter. larger individuals within one age-class tend to have relatively larger energy stores (oliver et al. 1979; thompson et al. 1991) which, coupled with mass-dependent metabolic requirements, means that mortality is often size selective on the smaller individuals (post & evans 1989; grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995). 198 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00212.x recent studies have described how young-of-the- year (yoy) perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) grew extre- mely fast while preying on ﬁsh from a size of 28 mm onwards, and developed a bimodal length–frequency distribution until the end of the growing season (beeck et al. 2002). a part of the yoy perch population fed on bream larvae (abramis brama l.) between june and july 1999 and grew at a mean rate of 1.2– 1.4 mmæday thus close to the maximum rate )1, observed at time the smaller beeck et al. 2002). during that perch fed on zooplankton and only grew with )1, which is, nevertheless in the about 0.5 mmæday range of maximum growth rates of juvenile perch feeding on zooplankton (bystro¨m & garcia-berthou 1999). laboratory conditions (1.5 mmæday )1, the lower rhine: with respect to our earlier studies on yoy perch in lake speldrop (borcherding et al. 2000; beeck et al. 2002; beeck 2003), the present study focuses on the relationship between the diet of yoy perch, the corresponding growth rates and its effects on the lipid content. therefore, we extended the ﬁeld studies of lake speldrop with two additional gravel pit lakes at (i) lake pfeiffer, where piscivory was known to be even much more pronounced and elongated compared with lake speldrop, leading to a large size cohort of yoy perch with a mean of 150 mm in total length (tl) after the ﬁrst growing season (beeck 2003); and (ii) lake reeser meer, where early piscivory was never observed and the yoy perch grew signiﬁcantly slower compared to lake speldrop. as ﬁeld studies and stomach analyses can only provide some snap- shots of the ongoing development during the season, we also conducted laboratory experiments, in which yoy perch were fed with different food items and rations. these experiments under controlled laborat- ory conditions should allow a ﬁrst estimation on the quantitative relationship between a certain amount of food, the accompanied growth rate and its effects on the lipid content for yoy perch. based on these results we wanted to get ﬁrst cues how far different food conditions may affect size and lipid content after the ﬁrst summer, and probably the year-class strength in the lakes studied. table 1. main characteristics of the three lakes. growth and lipid content of yoy perch materials and methods study lakes the study was conducted in three gravel pit lakes of the lower rhine, germany, where mining stopped approxi- mately 25–40 years ago (table 1). lake pfeiffer is located in the ﬂoodplain of the river rhine and is temporarily connected with the rhine via an oxbow lake during high water levels. lake pfeiffer ﬂoods annually, regularly in winter or early spring, and was last connected to the river rhine in this way before the current study in march 2002. both lake speldrop and lake reeser meer lie behind dykes, situated out of the ﬂoodplain area. their water level can change by c. 1.5 m, depending on the varying ground water levels. lake pfeiffer is mesotrophic and shallow compared with the other lakes, with a maximum depth of 5 m and the water body does not stratify during summer. lake speldrop is highly eutrophic (based on chlorophyll a concentrations, table 1) with a strong stratiﬁcation and a small epilimnion of about 5-m depth between july and october (beeck et al. 2002). in contrast, lake reeser meer is mesotrophic, with a small anaerobic hypolimnion only. the mean summer temperatures at the surface of all three lakes are in the same range (table 1), as conﬁrmed by biweekly temperature proﬁles over the spring/summer 2006 (w. scharf, university of cologne, personal communication). all three lakes have high secchi depths during summer (3– 4 m) and the shorelines mostly consist of steep banks especially at lake speldrop (slope of 15–45°). they differ in the extent of submerged macrophytes and the complexity of the littoral zone. lake speldrop has no submerged macrophytes with the exception of a small area of reed and the shore consists mainly of sand and gravel. in contrast, the littoral zone of lake pfeiffer and lake reeser meer supports continuous macrophyte stands consisting mainly of elodea to a depth of approximately 3 and 6 m, respectively. in addition, large areas of characeae are found in lake reeser meer to a depth to about 8 m. in lake pfeiffer the shore line includes mainly willow trees, and submerged branches of dead and overthrown trees provide areas of structural complexity in the littoral zone. location (n, w) surface area (ha) maximum depth (m) mean summer chl a (lg l) mean summer secchi depth (m) mean surface (0- to 3-m depth) temperature (°c), summer submerged vegetation lake pfeiffer 51°38¢, 6°28¢ 51°46¢, 6°22¢ lake speldrop lake reeser meer 51°45¢, 6°28¢ 7.4 7 28.5 5.5 <5 16 17 10–50 <5 2.9 3.4 3.8 21.4 22.2 21.3 dense beds of elodea nuthallii absent dense beds of elodea nuthallii and characeae 199 borcherding et al. food availability zooplankton samples were taken in each lake at night with a vertical haul 250 lm plankton net (25-cm diameter opening) parallel to the ﬁsh samples. three parallel samples were taken randomly between the surface and 5 m in the middle of each lake. all samples were preserved in 4% sucrose–formalin (haney & hall 1973). zooplankton samples were resuspended in 500-ml ﬂasks, from which three 10 ml subsamples were analysed under a binocular micro- scope. all organisms were identiﬁed by species, counted and the lengths of about 10 individuals of each species from each sample were measured, if available. lengths were transformed to biomass (wet weight) using the same regressions as in the diet analysis (see below). in contrast to lake speldrop (early piscivory only during spring and early summer) and lake reeser meer (early piscivory was never observed), the major food items of yoy perch in lake pfeiffer during summer and autumn were known to be juvenile ﬁsh and larger crustaceans (e.g. beeck 2003). therefore, the density of prey ﬁsh in the littoral zone of lake pfeiffer was estimated by a modiﬁed point abundance sampling method using electroﬁshing (persat & copp 1989; beeck et al. 2002). at ﬁve sampling dates between july and november 2002 we used a portable electroﬁshing apparatus (deka 3000 lord, deka- gera¨tebau, marsberg, germany) with a small ring anode (10 cm in diameter). at least 50 sampling points were randomly selected in the littoral zone. a general description of the method is given in beeck et al. (2002). we also used this method to estimate the abundance of larger crustaceans (atyaephyra, mysid- acea) (king & crook 2002). yoy perch young-of-the-year perch were sampled with gill nets (mesh sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20 mm). nets were set 1 h before sunset and hauled after 2 h. fish wet weight (g) and tl (mm) were recorded and subsamples for stomach content analysis were stored in 4% formaldehyde. a sample of 20 yoy perch was selected if available and deep frozen for subsequent lipid analysis. as the sizes of perch increased during the season, we used the daily growth coefﬁcient (dgc) according the following equation: dgc ¼ w ð1=3þ t   w ð1=3þ dt i  100; where wt is the weight at time t, wi is the initial weight and dt is the duration of the experiment (iwama & tautz 1981). one major advantage with dgc is that the index is independent of the initial ﬁsh body weight. diet the stomach content of 20 yoy perch was analysed regularly for each sampling date (see table 2 for dates). the stomach was dissected and weighed before the food items were removed. by weighing the empty stomach again, the weight of the food was calculated. to compare the stomach fullness between different samples, the wet weight of the food was related to the perch’s weight and is expressed as the index of stomach fullness (isf), where isf % ¼ (stomach content wet weight/perch wet weight) · 100. stomach contents were identiﬁed to order, family or species and up to 10 prey of each prey category were measured, if available. lengths were converted to wet weight using published length–weight relationships (bottrell et al. 1976; mehner et al. 1995; benke et al. 1999) and for ﬁsh prey lake-speciﬁc length–weight relationships were used. laboratory experiments all perch for laboratory experiments were collected from lake speldrop with a beach seine. fish were subsequently transported to the laboratory where an acclimation period of at least 2 days in the experi- mental tanks followed before each perch was meas- ured to the nearest mm and weighed with a precision length (tl) and mean table 2. mean total biomass at the sampling dates and the daily

one perch per tank. a low but steady ﬂow rate was produced by a ﬁltering pump. in the ﬁrst series of feeding experiments, yoy perch had a mean tl of 43.5 ± 2.4 mm (sd) and a body mass of 0.7 ± 0.1 g (sd), and the experiments were conducted at a temperature of about 22 °c. one group (n ¼ 38) was fed with a low density of zooplankton (c. 7% of perch wet weight every day) to simulate food deﬁciency. the other group (n ¼ 36) was fed ad libitum with small cyprinid ﬁsh [bream, sunbleak (leucaspius delineatus heckel)] at a mean ration of at least 50% of the perch biomass every day. the experiments lasted for 16 days. in the second series of experiments yoy perch had a mean tl of 80 ± 5.9 mm and a body mass of 4.8 ± 1.2 g. the experiment was conducted at a temperature of about 24 °c and lasted also for 16 days. mysidacea were added as a food item because of the results obtained from lake pfeiffer. four feeding treatments were used: (i) small ﬁsh (mainly chub, leuciscus cephalus l.; white bream, blicca bjoerkna l.; gudgeon, gobio gobio l.), fed at an ad libitum ration (approximately 30% of the perch wet weight every day, n ¼ 15); (ii) mysidacea (mainly hemimysis anomala g.o. sars) fed at an ad libitum ration (approximately 25% of the perch wet weight every day, n ¼ 16); (iii) zooplankton at an ad libitum ration (approximately 30% of the perch wet weight every day, n ¼ 20); and (iv) at a ration that zooplankton designed to simulate food deﬁciency (c. 1.5% of perch wet weight every day, n ¼ 20). the lipid content of the yoy perch at the start of the experiment was derived from related ﬁeld samples from lake speldrop, where the perch were caught at the same time for the experiments. at the end of all experiments, each perch was measured and weighed again to calculate individual growth rates. as the mean size of all groups at the start of each experiment was equal, daily growth rates in length or weight were calculated for comparisons. fish were then deep frozen for analysis of the lipid content. lipid analysis from each yoy perch, 1 g of muscle tissue was separated and homogenised in 19 ml of distilled water. if not enough muscle tissue was available from one ﬁsh, the tissue of two to three perch of the same size was pooled for analysis. lipids were analysed accord- ing to the method described by meyer & walther (1988). the method was calibrated with a cholesterol standard and the results are expressed as lipid content in percent of the dry weight of the yoy perch. growth and lipid content of yoy perch statistical analyses all comparisons were statistically analysed using anova, with bonferroni post hoc tests using spss 12.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). for analysis of the lipid content the data were ﬁrst normalised by the square root arcsine transformation. because lipid content was expected to covary with length (cf. post & evans 1989; grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995), tl was added as a covariate (ancova) when equal regression slopes allowed the application. to gain some information at what food ration the perch begin to grow or to increase lipids in the muscle tissue, the growth rate as well as the changes in the lipid content (dlipid content ¼ individual estimated lipid content at the start ) measured lipid content at the end of the experiment) were correlated with the food )1, rations (calculated as caloric value: jæg ww

sp., bosmi- na sp.). in lake speldrop, larvae of chaoborus also contributed with a higher amount to the zooplankton biomass. the highest zooplankton biomasses (8– )1) were found in lake pfeiffer and lake 9 mgæl speldrop (fig. 1). in contrast, the zooplankton bio- mass in lake reeser meer was c. 20 times lower, and )1. zooplankton biomass never exceeded 0.4 mgæl decreased dramatically in lake

season, yoy perch in lake speldrop had a mean size of 107 mm tl. lowest growth rates and the lowest mean size of after the ﬁrst growing season (83 mm tl) were recorded in lake reeser meer. diet fig.

remained at a comparatively high level in lake speldrop until october, but were low in january. in lake pfeiffer, the analysis of the zooplankton prey was complemented by point abundance sampling on small cyprinid ﬁsh and crustaceans, namely the freshwater shrimp atyaephyra desmaresti millet and the invasive mysidacea hemimysis anomala g.o. sars (fig. 2). both species were found in areas with woody debris or ﬂooded willow roots throughout the summer. yoy bream were only caught until august. in contrast, larvae and small juveniles of bitterling were found until late summer in all shallow areas with refuge structures like submerse vegetation or woody debris. growth young-of-the-year perch from lake pfeiffer grew extremely fast and reached a mean size of more than 150 mm tl at the end of the ﬁrst growing season (table 2). a comparable growth rate expressed with the dgc was found in lake speldrop only from july to august. during the following weeks, however, it and the large in the beginning of july, yoy perch from lake pfeiffer fed nearly exclusively on cyprinid ﬁshes in august, a diet mix of zooplankton, (fig. 3). macrozoobenthos crustaceans (atyaephyra, hemimysis) was found in the stomachs. until november, mysids increasingly dominated the food of the yoy perch in lake pfeiffer. this considerable change in the diet contrasts with the yoy perch in lake speldrop, who largely consumed zooplankton over the entire summer. in lake spel- drop, only two of a sample of 20 perch had fed on cyprinids in july. on the winter sampling, macrozoo- benthos became more prominent in the diet of the yoy perch in lake speldrop. this diet mix was similar in lake reeser meer for all samples. the biomass of food in the stomach in relation to the perch biomass (isf), was always highest in lake pfeiffer (fig. 3). considerable lower values in autumn than in summer should be due to some methodical problems, as gillnet had to be ﬁshed longer to ensure a suitable sample size and we therefore assumed a higher degree of digestion. the isf for yoy perch from lake speldrop continuously decreased from one sampling date to the next. nevertheless, it was always higher than the isf for perch from lake reeser meer where the lowest values were observed. in both lake pfeiffer and lake speldrop, empty stomachs were rarely recorded: exceptions are the 30th of september at lake pfeiffer (same reason as described above) and the winter sampling date at lake speldrop, when 30% of yoy perch had empty stomachs. in contrast, the percentage of empty stomachs in lake reeser meer

lake speldrop (8.92 ± 0.08% se) and lake reeser meer (8.78 ± 0.13% se; table 3, ancova, d.f. ¼ 1,187, bonferroni size-cor- rected p < 0.05). although the absolute lipid content of the perch from lake pfeiffer increased steadily through the sampling period (fig. 4), the size-correc- ted post hoc comparisons (based on an mean size of 118 mm tl) revealed a signiﬁcantly reduced lipid content for samples in mid-august (9.52 ± 0.13% se) and the beginning of september (9.46 ± 0.13% se) compared with the other samples (at least ‡10.3%, table 3, ancova, d.f. ¼ 1,86, bonferroni p < 0.05, fig. 4).

ﬁrst series of experiments resulted in signiﬁcantly higher growth rates in size and weight for those perch fed on ﬁsh (one-way anova, d.f. ¼ 1,47, bonferroni p < 0.05, fig. 5). after 16 days, the lipid content of the perch that were fed with ﬁsh was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the start population and perch fed on a low zooplankton ration (table 4, ancova, d.f. ¼ 1,65, bonferroni p < 0.05, fig. 5). four experimental groups in the second series of experiments were fed either with ﬁsh, two zooplank- ton rations or with mysids from lake pfeiffer. growth rates were lowest for the low zooplankton ration and highest for the group of yoy perch that had fed on ﬁsh. although the high zooplankton ration was slightly but not signiﬁcantly higher than that for the mysids, those ﬁsh that fed on mysids grew signiﬁ- cantly faster (one-way anova, d.f. ¼ 1,67, bonferroni p < 0.05, fig. 6). the statistical analysis revealed a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the lipid content of the yoy perch that fed for 16 days on the different food rations (table 4, ancova, d.f. ¼ 1,85). although there was a decreasing tendency between the lipid content at the start and those experimental groups that had fed

beeck 2003), was not observed. in lake pfeiffer, the consistent availability of high-quality food (e.g. mysids), for all size classes of yoy perch without gape size limitations, is assumed to be a major reason why the whole yoy perch cohort grew with comparably high rates. this is in accordance with other in which the consumption of mysids correlated with high growth rates for eurasian perch (houthuijzen et al. 1993), pikeperch (sander lucioperca l.) and eurasian perch (willemsen 1977; van densen et al. 1996) and juvenile weakﬁsh (cynoscion regalis bloch & schnei- der, lankford & targett 1997). invasive mysids were not available in lake pfeiffer in 2001, when only the piscivorous cohort of the yoy perch reached a mean tl of about 150 mm at the end of the growing season (beeck 2003). studies than in 1999 for in lake speldrop, no larger crustaceans were available, however, the biomass of zooplankton in 2002 remained on a comparatively high level through- )1). out the whole summer (mean density c. 8 mgæl this food was available for all yoy perch and resulted in mean sizes at the end of the growing season that were lower the large and piscivorous cohort (mean tl 125 mm at the end of october, beeck et al. 2002), but above comparable values in lake speldrop in 2000 (98 mm tl in october, beeck 2003). the mean biomass of )1) zooplankton in lake speldrop was low (c. 2 mgæl during the summer of 1999 and even lower in 2000 (cf. beeck et al. 2002; beeck 2003). in 2000, only a short period of piscivory at the beginning of june was recorded in lake speldrop that was, however, long enough to provide a certain part of the yoy perch a growth spurt. this competitive advantage over their smaller siblings enabled the larger perch to feed on larger and probably more proﬁtable plankton organ- isms, such as chaoborus and leptodora, in compar- ison with the small growth cohort which fed mainly on daphnids and copepods (beeck 2003). the develop- ment of the bimodal size distribution is therefore not necessarily dependent on long-term feeding on ﬁsh, but can be triggered by early piscivory and then develop further through selective planktivory (beeck 2003). nevertheless, our results from the three lakes in 2002 in combination with the laboratory experiments may be considered as further evidence that not only the availability of high-quality food (e.g. cyprinids or 205 fig. 7. changes in the daily growth coefﬁcient and daily changes in the lipid content in relation to the amount of daily available energy for young-of-the-year perch (all values ±se) of both feeding experiments. the ﬁtted curves are based on the logarithmic regressions as indicated. differences. on the other hand, the same amount of two different food items can lead to signiﬁcantly different growth rates, as it was also demonstrated by the second laboratory experiments. here, yoy perch grew signiﬁcantly better with mysids than with zooplankton as food, although the food ration on the high zooplankton treatment was slightly higher than that for the mysids. the quantity of consumed food as well as the selection of certain food particles, i.e. the quality of available food, are assumed to be the main factors that affect growth of yoy perch (van densen et al. 1996; xu et al. 2001; beeck et al. 2002). besides this, other factors, e.g. temperature can inﬂuence the growth of yoy perch (cf. grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995). tem- perature not only enhances growth rates through biochemical and physiological processes (e.g. mehner & wieser 1994; hanel et al. 1996), it is also a major factor for the seasonal succession of the food organ- isms in temperate areas, like phytoplankton and zooplankton (wetzel 1983). we assume only a low inﬂuence of temperature on growth of the yoy perch in the present study, as there were no distinct differences in the lakes studied. in general, tempera- ture has to be included in a growth model, as it was revealed in several studies (e.g. bacon et al. 2005). in contrast to controlled temperature conditions in the laboratory or studies in rivers where more homogen- ous temperatures are to expect, lake temperatures may differ considerably in relation to depth, especially in temperate areas during the summer stratiﬁcation (wetzel 1983). because all temperatures layers may be used by perch (e.g. daily vertical migration, cech borcherding et al. levels of zooplankton mysids) but also different throughout the season are an important factor to determine growth rates of juvenile perch (e.g. mehner et al. 1996). the mean size at the end of the ﬁrst growing season as described in the present study for the yoy perch of lake pfeiffer is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest ever published. it is only comparable with the size of a piscivorous/cannibalistic cohort of yoy perch that were obtained from an experimental study in ﬁsh ponds (urbatzka 2002). mean sizes above 100 mm tl has been observed in the ﬁeld only three times, for perch feeding on mysidacea (houthuijzen et al. 1993) or on ﬁsh (beeck et al. 2002; beeck 2003), and for perch held in aquaculture (thorpe 1977). the elevated growth rates demonstrated here for the ﬁeld and for laboratory conditions are in the same range as maximum growth rates in the labor- atory reported for piscivorous juvenile perch with )1 1.5 mmæday for planktivorous perch (bystro¨m & garcia-berthou 1999). )1 (beeck et al. 2002) and 0.6 mmæday such growth differences within an age-class may be manifested in bimodal or even multimodal length– frequency distributions (shelton et al. 1979). the bimodality in the size distribution is a common phenomenon for piscivorous ﬁsh species (deangelis & coutant 1982) that is regularly accompanied by differential use of food resources, e.g. in pikeperch (van densen et al. 1996), largemouth bass (micropte- rus salmoides lacepede, shelton et al. 1979; tim- mons et al. 1980), striped bass (morone saxatilis walbaum, sutton & ney 2001) and walleye (sander vitreum mitchill, mcintyre et al. 1987). a bimodal length–frequency distribution within one age class disambiguates that a part of the population is growing much faster than the rest. in accordance with sutton & ney (2001), beeck et al. (2002) suggested increased overwinter survival of the large yoy perch cohort in lake speldrop due to higher energy reserves. allocation of lipids food uptake and growth of the comparison of the three lakes studied revealed a signiﬁcant higher lipid content for perch from lake pfeiffer and overall lowest values for perch from lake reeser meer. this is in agreement with our estimates of the yoy perch. although the absolute lipid content increased for yoy perch from lake pfeiffer between july and august, the statistical analysis revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in the size-corrected lipid content, which occurred parallel with the period of highest growth rates. in contrast, the size-corrected lipid content of the yoy perch from lake speldrop and lake reeser meer did not change during the summer, but decreased 206 in autumn when perch from lake pfeiffer increased lipid content. assumingly, food uptake of the yoy perch from lake speldrop and lake reeser meer was not sufﬁcient to permit energy storage beneath the energy consumption for maintenance and relatively low growth rates, but also a certain part of the allocated energy was consumed. again, this is in good correlation with the reduced uptake of food recorded from lake speldrop and lake reeser meer in late summer and autumn. the allocation of a lipid store is, like growth, related to the quantity and quality of food (kirjasniemi & valtonen 1997a,b; niva 1999). several studies have highlighted the importance of lipids in the life cycle of ﬁshes, especially with regard to the seasonal adapta- tions to changes in lake productivity. the lipid content in brown_trout was signiﬁcantly higher in specimens feeding on ﬁsh than on insects (niva 1999). a high lipid content was also related to fat- and protein-rich food in eurasian perch (xu et al. 2001) and juvenile red drum (sciaenops ocellatus l., craig et al. 1999). because larger individuals within an age cohort tend to have relatively larger energy stores (e.g. oliver et al. 1979; thompson et al. 1991; hurst et al. 2000), size-corrected comparisons are necessary to compare different samples. in the present study, the use of an ancova allowed the interpretation of the results independently of the different sizes of the yoy perch during the season (cf. grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995). depending on the sampling dates, the observed and signiﬁcant differences recorded from the ﬁeld samples demonstrate changes over periods of 4–6 weeks. however, the laboratory experiments revealed that lipid content can also change signiﬁcantly over relatively short periods as well. in both feeding experiments, ﬁsh prey was associated with increased allocation to lipid stores, whereas zooplankton fed at only slightly lower rations resulted in signiﬁcantly lower growth rates and a decrease of the lipid store. this is in correlation to the caloric value of both food items that is distinctly lower for daphnidae compared with cyprinid ﬁshes (e.g. cummins & wuycheck 1971). the second experiment revealed that perch feeding on mysids had similar lipid concentrations to those feeding on ﬁsh, which may depend on a relatively high mean caloric value (chipps & bennett 2000). in addition, the lipid content of mysis mixta lilljeborg was found to increase considerably during the summer season (richoux et al. 2004), indicating that mysids may be a valuable food for ﬁsh (e.g. horppila et al. 2003). how far the allocation of energy to lipid storage throughout the summer and autumn was always in relation to calculated growth rates and/or to the size of the yoy perch remains unclear (cf. schultz & conover 1997). although large yoy perch from lake pfeiffer grew rapidly in summer, allocation of lipids decreased. in contrast, the smaller and slower growing perch from lake speldrop and lake reeser meer did not reduce their lipid store. comparing the results of both feeding experiments that were conducted with small perch (43.5 mm tl) in july and larger ones (80 mm tl) in august/september, no clear differ- ences became obvious, because growth rates as well as the allocation of energy to the lipid store were in the same range. conclusions the year-class strength of most ﬁsh populations is determined during the ﬁrst year of life (craig 1980; henderson et al. 1988), with body size as a major factor known to inﬂuence recruitment, particularly during the ﬁrst winter (post & evans 1989; sutton & ney 2001). reduced predation pressure (e.g. persson et al. 2004) and the ability to reach larger and more proﬁtable food items (e.g. keast & eadie 1985; beeck 2003) are considered as an advantage for fast growing yoy ﬁsh. in addition, the capacity for energy storage is directly dependent on ﬁsh body size, where lipid content comprise a greater portion of total body mass in larger individuals, reducing mortality due to food depletion in winter (e.g. miranda & hubbard 1994; grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995; pangle et al. 2004). the differences in growth and allocation of energy to lipid stores in yoy perch was clearly related to the quantity and quality of the food resources in both, ﬁeld samples from three different lakes and the laboratory experi- ments. in agreement with many other studies and with respect to a preliminary starvation experiment and its consequence for the lipid reserves (murawski 2003), we assume that yoy perch from lake pfeiffer should be able to survive their ﬁrst winter better then those from lake speldrop, and especially lake reeser meer where depletion of the energy reserves is assumed (hermasch 2003). thus, the increased growth poten- tial associated with early piscivory of yoy perch or the availability of energetically proﬁtable food like mysids, as described in the present study should be considered as an important factor that could have far-reaching consequences for the ﬁsh community (houthuijzen et al. 1993; brabrand 2001), as demon- strated for the eutrophic lake speldrop with its perch- dominated ﬁsh community (beeck et al. 2002). acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge the help of peter beeck, lisa heermann, simone murawski and andreas scharbert in the ﬁeld. the comments of erin
