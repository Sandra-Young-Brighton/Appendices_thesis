e-mail: julien.cucherousset@univ-rennes1.fr accepted for publication june 2, 2006 introduction invasive species constitute a major threat to biodiver- sity and ecosystem integrity and cause substantial economic damage (vitousek et al. 1997; kolar & lodge 2001; lee 2002, pimentel 2005). freshwaters are considered one of the most severely degraded ecosystems in industrialised countries (oberdorff et al. 2002) and have been the recipient of many invasions, in particular by ﬁsh species (see copp et al. 2005; garcı´a-berthou et al. 2005 for review). the success of nonindigenous ﬁsh has been widely studied and attributed to several factors including speciﬁc life history traits (olden et al. 2006), phylogeny (alcaraz et al. 2005) and environmental characteristics inclu- ding abiotic factors or human use (moyle & light 1996; alcaraz et al. 2005). environmental disturbance is known to greatly facilitate ﬁsh invasions (moyle & light 1996). habitat modiﬁcation and fragmentation (e.g., water pollution, construction of dams and water diversions) threaten native ﬁsh faunas while favouring the invasion of more tolerant non-native species (marchetti et al. 2004). in the case of some artiﬁcial ecosystems, the decline of traditional human activities can impact local species diversity by favouring the loss and fragmen- tation of habitat (wolter 2001). studies of invasive ﬁsh species in artiﬁcial environments are particularly rare, although such species often dominate these areas that are now common throughout the landscape. it is the case for the black bullhead [ameiurus melas (raﬁn- esque)], which was introduced into france from north america in 1871, and is now widespread in europe (wheeler 1978), notably with recent records in spain and portugal (elvira 1984; doadrio 2001; gante & santos 2002). despite its classiﬁcation as a ‘species liable to cause biological disequilibrium’ by the french legislation (article r. 232–3 code rural, see guevel 1997), few ecological studies have been conducted in its european non-native range (but see boe¨t 1980). in the present article, we study the distribution and habitat selection of young-of-the-year (yoy) and adult a. melas in an artiﬁcial wetland in western doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00199.x 589 cucherousset et al. france. we use an integrative approach (copp 1989; poizat & pont 1996) to examine the response of a. melas to habitat heterogeneity at two spatial scales: ditch network level and local microhabitat. material and methods study area the brie`re wetland ﬂows in the estuary of the loire river (northwest france, 47 °22¢n, 02 °11¢w) and represents a large freshwater marsh (9000 ha, fig. 1). it is composed of a complex network of permanently ﬂooded ditches within a patchwork of temporary habitats that ﬂood in winter and progressively dry during spring and summer as a result of the rainfall regime and water level regulations. since the last transgression (8000 bp), peat lands have developed and reed beds have progressively settled. furthermore, the brie`re marsh has rapidly changed during the last century as a result of a 3-year ﬂood period during the second world war and a continuous decrease of many agricultural activities. for instance, grazing decreased greatly (200 bovines and horses in the early 1980s vs. 3000 animals in the early 1900s) and peat extraction ceased completely in the 1950s, whereas 100,000 hl of peat were extracted in the 1880s. the combination of changes in human activities has favoured the development and expansion of reed beds mainly composed of the common reed [phragmites australis (cav.) trin. ex steud.] (bernard & rolland 1990). during the last century, the surface area covered by vegetation type: reed bed marsh meadow ditch network outflow sampled sites: ditch section reed bed marsh meadow brière marsh loire france france n fig. 1. map of the brie`re marsh illustrating the ditch network and the matrix of temporary habitats (marsh meadow and reed bed). location of ) and temporary habitats sampled in april 2004, where reed beds are represented as (d) and permanent habitats sampled in august 2004 ( marsh meadows as ( ). 590 2 km reed beds increased from 2% to 85% of the total area, and marsh meadows, mainly composed of other poaceae, decreased from 83% to 10%, the rest being covered by open waters (bernard & rolland 1990). these changes in human activities have played a signiﬁcant role in the loss of native plant and animal species (bernard & rolland 1990; eybert et al. 1998). at the same time, the brie`re marsh has experienced several invasion events, and notably that of a. melas. historical data indicate that a. melas was introduced in 1929 (maillard 1972). it is now widely distributed throughout the entire wetland. fish sampling and safety precautions fish sampling was performed using an electroﬁshing (feg 8000, efko, leutkirch, germany) apparatus (400–600 v and 6–10 a) with a 30-cm diameter anode. this sampling technique was chosen because it is the least destructive, most cost-effective and least biased (good efﬁciency for capturing all species and most life stages, persat & copp 1990). fish were sampled in two periods of 2004, which were dictated by the pattern of ﬂoods, the seasonal conﬁguration of habitats associated with electroﬁshing. all ﬁsh species inhabit the ditch web during drought (hereafter called permanent habitats), and some of them colonise reed beds and meadows (hereafter called temporary habitats) during the ﬂood- ing season for the purposes of nursery, growing or spawning areas (carpentier et al. 2004). these latter habitats (10 reed beds and 12 meadows) were sampled in april (fig. 1) during the recession of water levels (average water depth of 51.0 cm ± 19.1 sd) and before spawning of most species. given that the efﬁciency of electroﬁshing is limited in deeper waters, permanent habitats (25 ditches, fig. 1) were sampled in august when the water level was low (average water depth of 52.4 cm ± 29.0 sd). importantly, ﬁsh sampling was performed using the point abundance sampling (pas) method (nelva et al. 1979). this procedure involves throwing the anode from a boat to a distance of 5–10 m to limit ﬁsh escape and sampling at an interval of ‡50 m. furthermore, the anode must be thrown in shallow waters to surprise the ﬁsh and minimise sampling bias (persat & copp 1990). fish were collected with a net, identiﬁed to species, measured to the nearest mm [fork length for all species except length for european eel anguilla anguilla (linnaeus)] and immediately re- leased back into water. we followed recommendations of copp & garner (1995) concerning the number of pas per site: 30.0 pas ± 3.8 per temporary habitat and 26 pas ± 4.1 per ditch. each pas was located using a global positioning system to perform spatial analyses. we used size-class distribution proﬁles to total habitat use of artiﬁcial wetland by ameiurus melas distinguish yoy from adults for each ﬁsh species (carpentier et al. 2004). a threshold of 70 mm was used to distinguish the two age classes in a. melas. this ﬁsh-size threshold agrees with the ﬁndings of hanchin et al. (2002). based on speciﬁc length– weight relationships deﬁned in situ (cucherousset, unpublished data), we calculated the relative biomass of each ﬁsh species. environmental characteristics of permanent habitats we classiﬁed ditch size into two categories: those belonging to the primary network (main river or large ditches directly connected to the main river, mean width ¼ 19.7 ± 6.0 m) and those belonging to the secondary network (ditches connected to the primary network level, mean width ¼ 8.9 ± 2.6 m). a set of descriptors of the ditch network in the vicinity of each sampled ditch (ditch network variables) was extracted from a geographical information system (arcview 3.2, environmental science research institute inc., redlands, ca, usa) using land cover and hydrog- raphical network information. these variables repre- sent the degree of connectivity of the ditch network. the number of ditches (nd), number of connections (crossroads between ditches, nc), length of ditches belonging to the primary (ldi) and the secondary (ldii) network levels and total length of ditches (tld ¼ ldi + ldii) were calculated for each ditch at different radius values (buffer area, calculated at the central part of each site): 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 m. this range of radius values corresponds to the mean linear home range values (0.5–2.1 km, sakaris et al. 2005) for the closely related species, brown bullhead [ameiurus nebulosus (leseur)]. four ﬁne-scale (microhabitat) variables were meas- ured at each pas during ﬁsh sampling. water depth (wd) was transformed into two classes (0–50 cm and >51 cm, after inspection of the distribution frequency of values), substrate (su) was classiﬁed into two types (peat, not peat), vegetation cover (vc) was visually estimated as the percentage of area covered by plants and transformed into two classes (absence or presence) for analyses and adjacent habitat type was categorised as reed beds or marsh meadows. data analysis the pas from each ditch were analysed collectively at the ditch network scale and punctually at the micro- habitat scale (copp 1989). at the ditch network level, we conducted a series of preliminary analyses to quantify the degree of multicollinearity among con- tinuous variables [length of ditches were ln(x + 1) transformed]. next, a principal components analysis was performed on the resulting independent variables 591 cucherousset et al. (nd_200, tld_200, nd_600, tld_600, 77.5% of the variation in the ditch network descriptors ex- plained by the ﬁrst two axes) to classify ditches into two groups highlighted by the signiﬁcant contribution of nc_600 [inertia analysis procedure (legendre & legendre 1998), see values in table 1]. the resulting variable was called ‘ditch connectivity’ (table 1). at the same time, we analysed the relationships between three ﬁsh descriptors, i.e., abundance (catch per unit effort, cpue ¼ number of individuals/pas), relative abundance (%) and relative biomass (%), for yoy and adults of a. melas using linear regression analysis. the relationships between the abundance of each size-class of a. melas (dependent variable) and the habitat descriptors at the two spatial scales (independ- ent variables) were analysed separately using general linear models. in these models, a forward selection procedure was applied to the variables with a prob- ability of entry of f of <0.15 and to exclude of >0.20. we also tested for differences in the abundance of table 1. summary statistics for the ﬁnal set of habitat variables used to model ameiurus melas abundance. reported values are proportions

normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the kolmogorov–smirnov/lilliefors test and levene’s test, respectively, before performing a t-test. when deviations from normality were detected, nonparamet- ric mann–whitney tests were performed. the statis- tical analyses were performed using statistica (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa) and a critical alpha level of 0.05 was used for all tests. results distributional patterns of ameiurus melas in permanent habitats in total, 11,921 individuals (9650 adults and 2271 yoy) belonging to 17 species were captured in permanent habitats (646 pas), including 5334 indi- viduals of a. melas (4524 adults and 810 yoy) (table 2). ameiurus melas largely dominated the ﬁsh assemblage in terms of abundance, relative abundance and relative biomass for

and 33.8% of the relative abundance and 20.6% and 35.2% of the relative biomass of the ﬁsh assemblage, respectively. how- ever, adult abundance varied greatly between sites table 2. details on ﬁsh

0.81, p ¼ 0.002, respectively) and yoy (linear regression, r2 ¼ 0.99, p < 0.001 and r2 ¼ 0.53, p ¼ 0.042, respectively), we used abundance (cpue) values to investigate the relationships between a. melas abundance and the suite of environmental variables. associations between ameiurus melas and environmental characteristics of permanent habitats at the ditch network level, we found no signiﬁcant relationship between abundance of yoy and adults and the two habitat descriptors, although a. melas abundance was marginally lower in large ditches (table 3). at the microhabitat scale, yoy and adults were more abundant in locations with peat substrate (table 4; fig. 2). we found a number of subtle differences for yoy and adults. whereas abundance of adults increased with the presence of adjacent reed beds (fig. 2), this relationship was not observed for yoy (table 4). yoy abundance was negatively related to water depth (table 4; fig. 2), whereas adult abundance was not (table 4). the vc · wd

20.5, p ¼ 0.008) when compared with marsh meadows. discussion in the present study, we found that the contemporary the brie`re marsh is ﬁsh assemblage of largely dominated by the invasive a. melas. our results provide strong evidence that a. melas prefer reed bed habitats, a habitat type that has rapidly invaded the marsh because of the decline of agricultural practices in this artiﬁcial ecosystem (bernard & rolland 1990). this suggests that a. melas may have beneﬁted from the expansion of reed beds in view of (i) the positive relationships found between its abundance and the presence of adjacent reed beds, (ii) the selection of peat substratum in small ditches and (iii) the prefer- ential use of reed beds (vs. marsh meadows) during the ﬂooding period. although some differences were found between yoy and adult individuals as a consequence of the ontogenetic shift in habitat use from yoy (pelagic habits) to adult (benthic habits) life stages (e.g., boe¨t 2001). in general, yoy and adult abundance in permanent habitats was both positively correlated with trends derived from the development of reed beds. indeed, reed beds are highly productive aquatic habitats. they likely affect habitat structure 593 cucherousset et al. adult n = 298 n = 348 meadow reed bed adjacent habitat n = 437 n = 209 ) e u p c ( e c n a d n u b a ) e u p c ( e c n a d n u b a 1.4 1.2 1

resources because of the large amounts of detritus produced, which can remain standing for one or more years in the litter (see details in mason & bryant 1975). ameiurus melas may preferentially occupy reed beds during the ﬂooding season for trophic cues, notably the presence of a speciﬁc invertebrate assemblage associated with reed bed litter (bedford & powell 2005). moreover, a. melas is a species with limnophilic habits (gante & santos 2002) and is tolerant to the harsh conditions imposed in many wetlands; therefore, it is likely to beneﬁt from such changes in the abiotic environment. in the same way, we found that a. melas illustrates a strong afﬁnity to reed beds as temporary ﬂooded habitats. further- more, a. melas abundance increases when decreasing water depth (brown et al. 1999) and the production of a large amount of litter by the reed beds might favour a. melas by limiting water depth. while we are unsure of the speciﬁc mechanisms that have led to the invasion success of a. melas, it is likely that the presence of other invasive animals has played a facilitative role. for example, we believe that the 594 recent introduction of the invasive red swamp crayﬁsh [procambarus clarkii (girard)] in the brie`re marsh may have favoured the establishment of a. melas by modifying the physical characteristics of the habitat. in fact, p. clarkii is known to impact substrate compo- sition (rodrı´guez et al. 2005), which may favour limnophilic species like a. melas that depend on speciﬁc substrate conditions for spawning and nest construction (braig & johnson 2003). moreover, p. clarkii might represent a more proﬁtable prey item for a. melas compared with smaller invertebrates. empirical evidence for such patterns would provide support for the invasional meltdown hypothesis of simberloff & von holle (1999), whereby the presence of particular invasive species facilitates the subsequent establishment of other nonindigenous species. future research addressing these questions is warranted. during the last 10 years, an active management plan has been undertaken in the brie`re wetland to restore marsh meadows through clear-cutting opera- tion and promoting the grazing of reed beds. these restoration activities have already positively affected the density and species richness of waterfowl assem- blage (eybert et al. 1998). because physical habitat can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and control invasion success and subsequent impacts (byers 2002), it would be of interest to investigate whether the restoration of marsh meadows could increase the resistance of this ecosystem to future spread of a. melas. furthermore, the study of the functional use of these temporary ﬂooded habitats and its seasonal variability (crain et al. 2004) is needed to better evaluate their effects on ﬁsh assemblage composition. at the very least, we cite the need to increase our understanding of the autoecology of a. melas to better understand the ecological introduced freshwater ﬁsh in artiﬁcial environments that are now prevalent across the landscape. impacts of acknowledgements we are grateful to e. feunteun and three anonymous reviewers
