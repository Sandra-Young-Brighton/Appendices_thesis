(1980) formalised the hypothesis that systematic habitat changes along a downstream gradient have predictable consequences for biological processes ranging from energy ﬂow to community structure (rosenfeld et al. 2007). thereafter, several studies focused on identifying the functional relationships between either ﬁsh community or population traits and their habitat (e.g., blanck et al. 2007). in salmonids, spatio-temporal variations in population abundance and production are closely related to differences and changes in physical habitat conditions (milner et al. 2003; lobo´n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004). further, together with other essential biotic and abiotic factors, habitat quality and quantity inﬂuence many population traits such as survival (harvey et al. 2005; lobo´ n- cervia´ 2007), growth (harvey et al. 2005; dineen et al. 2007) or migration rates (belanger & rodriguez 2002), as well as pervasive biological processes like to understand how individuals adapt self-thinning (lobo´n-cervia´ 2008), that affect popu- lation dynamics. habitat selection is perceived as an adaptive complex behaviour faced by organisms at the individual level, but shapes many key biological processes whose patterns emerge at higher organisa- is then tion levels (grimm & railsback 2005). it essential to different habitat conditions to predict the effects of habitat changes on stream ﬁsh population dynamics. habitat selection patterns of brown_trout salmo_trutta are well established in broad terms (armstrong et al. 2003), although this species can ﬂexibly modify selection behaviour as a function of habitat features (klemetsen et al. 2003). it is suggested the species occupy a relatively wide spatial niche with different optima within tolerable limits (heggenes et al. 1999). brown_trout show a great plasticity in habitat selec- tion, not only on a regional basis (heggenes 2002) but also at a river (ayllo´ n et al. 2009). consequently, the transferability of habitat selection models is generally limited given the complexity to reach level 420 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00426.x factors varying at separate the effects of local physical conditions from those of larger spatial scales (lamouroux et al. 1999). mediterranean-type streams are characterised by seasonal events of ﬂooding and drying and strong intra and interannual ﬂow variations (gasith & resh 1999). in these systems, aquatic organisms have developed different modes of adapta- tion (life history, behaviour) in response to the seasonal timing (and its predictability) of ﬂow events (lytle & poff 2004). river hydrology may be an important driving force for trout population dynamics in southern europe (lobo´ n-cervia´ 2009; nicola et al. 2009). given that physical habitat is much determined by the interaction of the structural features of the channel and the hydrological regime (maddock 1999), brown_trout may display a higher plasticity in habitat selection in variable environments than in stable ones. however, this question remains largely unknown despite its implications are essential when deﬁning measures for strategic conservation and management of mediterranean salmonid populations, which are increasingly threatened by habitat degradation and other anthropogenic impacts (almodo´ var & nicola 1999, 2004; almodo´ var et al. 2006a,b). speciﬁcally, implementation of the european water framework directive (wfd; 2000⁄ 60 ⁄ eec) to assess the ecolog- ical status of rivers implies a clear knowledge of how species habitat selection patterns adapt to the prevalent habitat conditions at typiﬁed river typologies. the objectives of this study were: (i) to deﬁne brown_trout habitat selection patterns at river reach plasticity of brown_trout habitat selection types differing in physical and environmental charac- teristics and (ii) to determine the factors driving selection patterns and the spatial scale over which they operate. for this purpose, habitat selection patterns were expressed as univariate microhabitat preference curves by age-class, so that they could be readily used in physical habitat simulation models. in addition, multivariate resource selection functions (rsf) were developed by age-class and river reach type, as ﬁsh typically do not features independently, but proﬁtable combinations of them (e.g., turgeon & rodrı´guez 2005; ayllo´ n et al. 2009; dixon & vokoun 2009). select physical habitat study area brown_trout habitat selection patterns were analysed in 44 study sites located in 20 rivers and streams from the ebro river basin, a mediterranean drainage, and 12 rivers and streams from the bay of biscay drainage (fig. 1). the study area was situated between latitudes 42°29¢ and 43°21¢n and longitudes 0°43¢ and 2°20¢w. selected sites cover the existing variability of envi- ronmental and geo-morphological conditions within the area. sampling sites corresponded to ﬁrst to fourth- order streams and were located at an altitude ranging from 115 to 870 m. median summer discharge ranged )1 and mean daily summer from 0.05 to 1.77 m3æs temperature ranged between 11.6 and 16.6 °c. as selected rivers ﬂow in a relatively small area, the differences in water ionic content do not cover a range fig. 1. map of the study area showing the sampling sites. 421 ayllo´n et al. wide enough to induce differences in growth and other life-history traits. materials and methods data collection the study was carried out during the summer (from 20 july to 11 august) of 2004. fish were sampled in each site by electroﬁshing using a 2200-w dc generator. captured trout were measured (fork length, to the nearest mm) and weighed (to the nearest g). scales were taken for age determination, so that each individual could be assigned to one of three age- classes, young-of-the-year (yoy, 0+), juvenile (1+) or adult (>1+). the ﬁsh were placed into holding boxes to recover and then returned back to the stream. numbered tags were dropped wherever a trout was captured, and depth, current velocity, substrate and cover were measured afterwards in a 1 m2 quadrat. the froude number of each occupied position was calculated later according to the following equation fr = v ⁄ (gæd)0.5, where (gordon v = mean column velocity, g = acceleration due to gravity and d = water depth. 2004): et al. physical habitat availability data were collected concurrently with ﬁsh sampling at each site. habitat availability was estimated every 1 m along transects placed perpendicular to the ﬂow. transects were selected to best describe the longitudinal distribution of all types of mesohabitats present within each site. for this purpose, at least two transects were located at each mesohabitat type. sample length at study sites was 5–7 times the average channel width, in accord- ance with the general precepts of alluvial river morphology on the spacing of successive rifﬂes (leopold et al. 1964). average length of study sites was 55.2 ± 19.6 m, and average assessed area of study sites was 502.7 ± 285.7 m2. total depth (cm), current velocity (mæs )1), substrate composition and cover were measured. the proportion (%) of substrate and cover was visually estimated in a 1 m2 quadrat. substrate was classiﬁed according to modiﬁed categories from classiﬁcation by platts et al. (1983) as silt (particle size <0.8 mm), sand (0.8–4.7 mm), gravel (4.8–76.0 mm), cobble (76.1– 304.0 mm), boulder (more than 304.0 mm) and bedrock. we deﬁned cover as any element other than substrate that can provide protection to ﬁsh against predators or adverse environmental conditions. the type of cover was classiﬁed as vegetation (aquatic or overhanging), woody debris, undercut bank, combined (combination of vegetation and woody debris), pools and under cascade. river reach classiﬁcation river reach types, sites were to deﬁne different grouped following a hierarchical, multiple-scale clas- siﬁcation approach. for this purpose, 14 climatic, environmental, geological, morphological and hydrau- lic variables measured at different spatial scales were used (table 1). morphological and geological vari- ables were employed to describe physical character- istics at higher spatial scales (watershed and river segment). variables were calculated by means of arcgis 9.1 software (esri inc., redlands, ca, usa). at the reach level, in addition to typical descriptors such as channel wetted width and mean and maximum water depth, the reach froude number (ratio sensitive to the proportion of rifﬂes vs. pools in reaches) and reynolds number (indicator of the level of turbu- lence), the width to depth ratio (descriptor of channel shape) and the slow (pool) to fast (turbulent and ﬂat) waters (flosi & reynolds 1994) ratio were used to compare the channel morphology and hydraulic geometry among study sites. the site average froude and reynolds numbers were calculated

(°c) % of shadowed area in the channel lamouroux & capra (2002). water temperature and percentage of shadowed wetted channel area were considered as a result of their inﬂuence in microhabitat selection as individuals may seek thermal refugia under extreme temperature conditions. a principal component analysis (pca) was performed then to summarise physical and environmental complexity, to explain spatial variability and to group similar sites. alternatively, grouping of sites was also explored by means of a cluster analysis using ward’s method and manhattan distances. microhabitat preference curves first, differences in habitat use among age-classes by reach type and among sites by age-class were evaluated. we also compared habitat availability and use at each reach type to test for the existence of habitat selection. continuous variables (water depth and velocity) were contrasted using a one-way anal- ysis of variance (anova), with a subsequent tukey’s test for comparison of means. a log-likelihood ratio test (g-test) was used for contrasting the categorical variable (channel index). as previous studies (e.g., parra et al. 2009) have shown spatial variations in brown_trout body size within the study area and habitat use is generally not only age but also size-dependent, individual length was included as a covariate in comparisons of habitat use among reach types by age- class. for all analyses, signiﬁcance level was set at a = 0.05. univariate preference curves for water depth, cur- rent velocity and channel index were developed by age-class. the channel index is a categorical variable used in habitat simulation models to describe the structural characteristics of the stream channel (see bovee 1986). in this study, the channel index was established as a combination of the substrate and cover features previously deﬁned. channel index was clas- siﬁed in seven categories as some of the deﬁned substrate and cover classes were merged into func- tional groups. hence, cobble and boulder categories were grouped and considered as substrate velocity shelters. silt and sand were treated as common category (ﬁnes). all cover categories were grouped as they refer to elements which mostly provide visual shelter against predators in locations near banks. channel index preference curves were built accord- ing to standard procedures (bovee 1986), while univariate rsfs were developed to calculate depth and velocity preference curves. rsfs described the relationship between water depth and current velocity availability and the relative probability of habitat use. a rsf is then a probabilistic form of habitat suitability criteria (ahmadi-nedushan et al. 2006). rsfs were preferred over traditional standard methods as they are plasticity of brown_trout habitat selection logistic regressions, statistically and quantitatively more rigorous (boyce et al. 2002). functions were developed by means of following the procedures described by hosmer & lemeshow (2000). linear and polynomial functions were ﬁtted to data. signif- icance level was set at a = 0.1. area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of developed models. finally, rsfs were normalised so that the minimum value was 0 and the maximum was 1. finally, we established three descriptors (optimum value, range of suboptimal values and usable range) to characterise the shape and position of calculated preference curves. the optimum value was deﬁned as the value of the microhabitat variable that matches the maximum preference index, the range of subop- timal values as the range of the microhabitat variable having a preference index >0.6 and the usable range as the full range of conditions presenting a preference index over 0. pair-wise correlation analyses (pearson r) between descriptors of preference curves and hydraulic and physical variables were performed to determine factors driving possible differences in developed habitat suitability criteria among river reach types. multivariate resource selection function the best selection, multivariate rsfs were also developed by means of multiple logistic regressions, according to the same procedures described for univariate rsfs. depth, current velocity and froude number were used as continuous predictors. the categories of channel index were included as categorical independent variables. a univariate analysis of each variable was performed to test for individual signiﬁcance and to assess nonlinear effects. meaningful interactions between microhabitat variables were also tested. for ﬁnal model subsets variable selection method was used, competing models being compared by means of the akaike’s information criterion adjusted for small samples (aicc; burnham & anderson 2002). the aicc allows objective selection of the model most consistent with the data while balancing the trade-off between precision and bias. the model with the lowest aicc was consid- ered the best ﬁt. following recommendations from hosmer & lemeshow (2000), signiﬁcance level was also set at a = 0.1, as the use of a more traditional to identify variables level (such as 0.05) may fail for brown_trout habitat known to be relevant selection. area under the roc curve and cross- validated classiﬁcation accuracy were used to eval- uate ﬁnal models, the prediction threshold being chosen as the value where model sensitivity equalled speciﬁcity. 423 ayllo´n et al. results river reach classiﬁcation the pca revealed three main axes accounting for 70.3% of the total variance of physical and environ- mental characteristics among study sites (table 2). the ﬁrst factor was highly correlated to all variables describing geo-morphological features of sites at large spatial scales (watershed and river segment) as well as to variables measured at the reach scale that covariate with those ones, such as channel wetted width or reynolds number. all variables characterising mor- phological and hydraulic attributes of river channel at the reach level scored highly in the second factor, except wetted width and reynolds number. finally, the third factor loaded heavily on water temperature and shadowed channel area, reﬂecting environmental characteristics that may affect position choice under extreme weather conditions. visual inspection of the plots of the ﬁrst and second components differentiated eight river reach types (rt; fig. 2), this differentiation being conﬁrmed by the cluster analysis. scores of pc1 (anova, signiﬁcantly f7,35 = 49.15, p

adults selected similar water depths except in pool-dominated reach types, rt4 and 7 (anova, p < 0.05). however, 1+ trout never occupied positions at the deepest areas of the stream channel. all age-classes occupied positions with similar water velocities across different river typologies except in reaches presenting deeper pools, rts 4, 5 and 7 (anova, p < 0.05). in these reach types, water velocities used by juveniles were signif- icantly lower than those used by yoy, while were signiﬁcantly higher than those used by adults. in rt2, adult trout used signiﬁcantly lower water velocities than younger individuals (anova, p < 0.001). finally, yoy trout used habitats presenting different structural attributes than habitats occupied by older individuals in all rts (g-test, p < 0.001). similarly, the use of structural elements of the channel differed between juveniles and adult trout in all rts (g-test, p < 0.05). length, yoy ﬁsh used signiﬁcantly different water depths (ancova, velocities (ancova, f7,427 = 8.45, p < 0.001) and structural elements (g-test, g42 = 148.76, p < 0.001) among the diverse rts. water depths (ancova, f7,368 = 8.32, p < 0.001) and velocities (ancova, f7,368 = 7.29, p < 0.001) as well as substrate and cover features (g-test, g42 = 152.04, p < 0.001) used by juvenile trout differed among rts too. finally, adults occupied habitats differing in depth (ancova, f7,474 = 9.05, p < 0.01), velocity (ancova, f7,474 = 10.81, p < (g-test, g42 = 241.85, p < 0.001) and structural 0.001) conditions across different rts. after controlling for the effects of

velocities used by yoy trout differed from its reach types (anova, p < 0.05) availability in all except in rt3 and 7. juvenile trout showed a differential use of water velocity (anova, p < 0.05) at rts 2, 3 and 6, while adult individuals used a narrower range of water velocities than what was available (anova, p < 0.05) at all reach types except at rts 5, 7 and 8. all age-classes highly selected

of pools in the reach, and hence mean depth, and with the maximum depth of pools (table 4). in yoy trout, the range of suboptimal and usable water depths also increased with increasing proportion of pools in the reach. optimum depth was not related to the slow to fast waters ratio, but increased when increasing the maximum reach depth, although this trend was only marginally signiﬁcant (pearson’s correlation analysis, 0.05 < p < 0.1). the area under the roc curve of the estimated models for yoy trout ranged from 0.67 to 0.77, while ranging between 0.68 and 0.94 for juveniles’ models and between 0.70 and 0.96 for adults’ functions. these values indicated from exceptional (c > 0.90) to low (c < 0.70) discrimination accuracies. the spatial variations observed in the water velocity preference curves were also related to variations in reach-speciﬁc morphological and hydraulic conditions (table 4). optimum water velocity for yoy trout was higher and the range of suboptimal and useable velocities shrank in reaches presenting higher mean and maximum water depth, and hence lower width to depth ratio. juvenile trout showed constant velocity optima, but range of suboptimal velocities increased when decreasing the froude number. in contrast, adults showed a growing preference for slower water velocities as the proportion of pools in the reach increased and thus the

and availability of devel- oped models was very low, indicating no selection but a higher use of most available water velocities by trout. young-of-the-year trout showed the greatest prefer- ence for positions dominated by substrate velocity shelters in all rts, while selectivity for gravels and cover elements increased with pc1 scores (table 5). preference for pool habitats increased with maximum reach depth. juvenile trout mainly selected habitats characterised by presence of cover elements in all rts (table 5). preference for pool habitats increased with their increasing proportion in the reach, as well as with mean and maximum reach depth. selectivity for gravel and substrate velocity shelters varied with attributes operating at large spatial scales (summarised by pc1), though in opposite directions. adult trout showed maximum preference for either pool habitats or positions dominated by cover elements depending on reach-speciﬁc conditions (table 5). contrarily to selectivity

classiﬁcation rate values indicated a good discrimina- tion between habitat use and availability for all obtained multivariate models, although in a few cases the discriminatory power of developed functions was low (c < 0.70). multivariate rsfs were consistent with the spatio-temporal patterns of habitat selection described by univariate preference curves, accurately detecting the most determinant microhabitat variables and their selection (table 6). interestingly, the froude number was the best predictor to describe the interactive nature of hydraulic variables in almost all rts for all age- classes. at channel positions where the froude number was low, the categorical variable pool (po) allowed us to discriminate between pool habitats and areas of low water velocity located at shallow river margins. relative inﬂuence on habitat discussion in this study, we observed broad spatial differences in brown_trout habitat selection. our results deﬁned brown_trout as a habitat generalist species and suggested that spatial variations in habitat selection patterns are driven by physical and environmental factors operating at multiple spatial scales. we also observed variations in habitat selection through onto- geny that were consistent across reach types, although the overlap levels in habitat preferences between life stages varied with reach type. ontogenetic changes in habitat selection have been widely described in brown_trout (see reviews by armstrong et al. 2003 and klemetsen et al. 2003; and references therein) and other species of freshwater ﬁshes (e.g., schlosser 1985; sempeski & gaudin 1995; mann 1996; hedger et al. 2005). further, variations in habitat selection patterns have been observed in brown_trout popula- tions at shorter temporal scales, from seasonal (rinco´ n & lobo´ n-cervia´ 1993; ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 1997; bremset 2000; riley et al. 2006) to diel (harris et al. 1992; shuler et al. 1994; bremset 2000; bardonnet et al. 2006) time periods. the larger ﬁsh-deeper habitat pattern held true across river reach typologies, as did the selection of slower water habitats as trout increased in size. these patterns are consistent with the ontogeny of habitat selection previously observed in the species, i.e. yoy trout trout occupy deeper and slower water habitats (e.g., hegg- enes 1996; armstrong et al. 2003). the results of multivariate rsfs corroborated univariate patterns observed as yoy trout maximised habitat selectivity fast-ﬂowing rifﬂes while older inhabit table 6. multivariate resource selection

pool dwellers, whereas juvenile trout show a context-dependent behaviour. the observed spatial segregation between age-classes may be explained by the trade-off between energy gain and predation risk which tends to drive position choice in salmonids (railsback & harvey 2002). thus, growing increasingly deeper habitats to trout would select obtain higher territory volumes to fulﬁl increasing metabolic demands (ayllo´ n et al. 2010) and reduce predation risk (harvey & stewart 1991). furthermore, the froude value of positions selected by different age- classes was highly correlated with the selection of substrate and cover elements. kemp et al. (2000) showed that the occurrence of different structural elements in a river could be described by the froude number. the range of froude values that maximised habitat selectivity of brown_trout in this study matches with that of the range of optimum values reported by kemp et al. for substrate and cover conditions most frequently selected by different age-classes. individuals selected substrate in homogeneous fast-ﬂowing reach types, interco- hort niche overlap was high, competition being relaxed with increasing stream size, as adult trout occupied covered positions at deep banks while younger sheltered microhabitats. irrespective of stream size, intercohort segregation along the depth and velocity gradients increased with increasing proportion of pools relative to fast-ﬂowing habitats and maximum depth. how- ever, selectivity of pool habitats by adult trout was largely related to maximum depth of pools and interaction with stream size. that is, adults tend to select shallow pools in small streams, but not so in more exposed wide rivers in which only deep pools were selected. besides, preference for pools by adults increased with the proportion of pools avail- able in a given reach in a nonlinear fashion. this is consistent with the notion that ﬁsh density in deep habitats rifﬂes available in a reach due to habitat partitioning between yoy and older trout (baran et al. 1997), probably as a result of pool isolation (lonzarich et al. 2000). increases with the proportion of multivariate rsfs identiﬁed substrate shelters as the most determinant structural feature of yoy trout habitat, whereas cover elements were highly selected only in headwater streams and homogeneous reach types. the analyses also showed that cover elements and pool habitat, when present, were the preferred structural features of juvenile and adult brown_trout. the lack of pool habitat has been considered the main limiting factor for large trout, especially in small streams (heggenes 1996). however, our results sug- plasticity of brown_trout habitat selection gest that cover structures may play a similar role. recent studies have also highlighted the pervasive function of cover elements in structuring the spatial distribution of brown_trout individuals within streams (e.g., o¢connor & rahel 2009). considering the evolution of habitat selection through ontogeny observed in our study, cover availability may be regarded as the single most important attribute deter- mining salmonid abundance, as suggested by arm- strong et al. (2003). the observed positive effects of restoration instream cover enhancement on ﬁsh populations support that point (smokorowski & pratt 2007). performing projects previously reported hydraulic and structural features selected by brown_trout (e.g., greenberg et al. 1996; ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 1997; vismara et al. 2001; hegg- enes 2002; strakosh et al. 2003) differed between streams, but are within the ranges described in our study. these differences are not surprising, as habitat selection may change with variation of physical and environmental factors across geographic regions. in addition, many biotic factors that inﬂuence habitat selection may vary over space as well. in salmonid populations, different forms of competition and pre- dation drastically alter habitat selection patterns (grand 2002). on one hand, the type, number and size of predators affect prey size distribution (bystro¨m et al. 2003), promoting behavioural responses of life stages concerning habitat selection. on the other hand, habitat for salmonids in sympatry as opposed to salmonids in allopatry (na¨slund et al. 1998; blanchet et al. 2007) and differs between populations closed to anadromy and populations where resident and anadromous forms coexist (morinville & rasmussen 2006). selection varies differential the observed broad differences in habitat selection across reach types suggest a ﬂexible habitat generalist strategy. heggenes (2002) previously described such plastic behaviour in brown_trout atlantic populations and our study extends it to mediterranean streams. the hierarchical ‘landscape ﬁlters’ concept by poff (1997) predicts that distribution and abundance of species reﬂect their speciﬁc traits that allow them to pass through multiple habitat ﬁlters. at very large spatial scales, a wide variation in habitat selection patterns is expected for habitat generalist species when biotic and abiotic constraints differ between regions. in this study, we observed differences in selection patterns in streams within a relatively small study area and even within the same river basin, or stream. optimal and suboptimal habitat preferences widely varied within usable limits among reach types, this variability being explained by changes in both local site features and catchment-scale variables. variations in selection patterns the morpho-geological watershed-scale gradient may represent the adaptation observed along 429 ayllo´n et al. of individuals to downstream patterns of physical and biological factors along the river continuum. site- speciﬁc hydraulic and morphological features ﬁnally shape general selection trends into reach type-speciﬁc patterns. this study represents a step forward from previous works (e.g., heggenes 2002) it provides the general functional links between main physical attributes deﬁning reach types and related habitat selection patterns. however, special emphasis should be placed in deﬁning those links in a wider range of river typologies to improve results from physical habitat simulations or predictive population models. in that acknowledgements this study was funded by the government of navarre by means of an
