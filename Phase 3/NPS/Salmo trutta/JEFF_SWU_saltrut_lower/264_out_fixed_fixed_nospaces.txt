heins & baker 1992) that occur across a number of widespread gulf coastal plain drainages in the southern united states. based on these ﬁndings and on the general correlation between ovum size and offspring size in ﬁshes (heins & baker 1987; roff 1992), heins & baker (1987), heins (1991), and heins & baker (1992) of streamﬂow causing density-independent mortality among larval or young ﬁsh exerts a greater effect in streams with higher runoff, and that larger egg size increases individual female ﬁtness where these effects are greater. the hypothesis is consistent with bet-hedging models of life history (murphy 1968; stearns 1976, 1980) that predict selection for larger offspring and other co-adapted life history traits in environments with increased or ﬂuctuating juvenile mortality relative to adult mortality. hypothesized aspect the relationship of runoff to ﬂow regime and, in particular, to ﬂows that theoretically could cause density-independent mortality among larval or young ﬁshes is unknown. the mean annual runoff for a given point in a stream is calculated by divid- ing the total discharge for an entire year by the drainage area (united states geological survey, usgs). when two streams with equal drainage area but unequal mean annual runoff are com- pared, more water will pass along the stream with greater runoff over the course of an average year. annual runoff is not correlated with annual dis- charge (authors, personal observation) because unlike average discharge, differences in runoff are related to characteristics other than the size of the catchment (m.l. plunkett, usgs, personal com- munication). the most important of these charac- teristics is precipitation, especially in the southern united states (geraghty et al. 1973). the slope, soil type and vegetation type of the drainage basin also inﬂuence runoff. unless these characteristics change along the length of a stream, the mean an- nual runoff of successive reaches will remain rela- tively constant from site to site. these character- istics will also affect certain physicochemical prop- erties of the ﬂow regime, which will be related to mean annual runoff in a limited geographical re- gion (poff & ward 1989). thus, runoff integrates a number of physical and physicochemical factors, and any one or combination thereof could be the selective agent inﬂuencing egg size in cyprinids. here we compare egg size variation of cyprinella venusta from populations within a single drainage, the pascagoula river system, mississippi. we re- 12 late egg-size variation to variation in mean annual runoff and stream size as represented by average annual discharge and drainage area. our purpose was to ascertain whether the relationship of ovum size and runoff that has been observed at the mac- rogeographical, inter-drainage scale also exists at the smaller, intra-drainage spatial scale. we also analyzed relationships of body size and clutch size with egg size for the purpose of factoring out their potential inﬂuences on egg size. contrary to an earlier study on cyprinella venusta (heins & baker 1987), our use of populations from a single drain- age minimized potential confounding effects of populations with differing genetic structures re- sulting from drainage isolation. all the popula- tions (sites) studied here are potentially capable of dispersal leading to gene ﬂow because the blacktail shiner is continuously distributed throughout the pascagoula river system. the design of our study also avoided potential confounding effects of dif- fering physiographic factors associated with inter- drainage comparisons. we treated measures of variation in discharge and extreme ﬂows as dis- turbance factors in an attempt to identify those particular environmental factors that may have se- lected for differences in egg size. although herita- bilities of life history traits average less than other characteristics, there is sufﬁcient additive genetic variance to allow an evolutionary response to dif- fering environments (roff, 1992). previous studies of populations in different drainages provide in- direct support for the hypothesis that differences in egg size have a genetic basis (endler 1986; heins 1991; heins & baker 1992). in addition, observed stability in ovum size across temporal and macro- geographic scales (endler 1986; heins & baker un- published data) provide strong indirect support of a genetic basis for the observed variation in ovum size. material and methods life history traits cyprinella venusta were collected from eight popu- lations (sites) on streams within the pascagoula river drainage, mississippi, from 11 to 15 june 1993 (fig. 1). collections were made with a 3-m- long, 4.8-mm-mesh seine. specimens were ﬁxed in 10% formalin for 2 weeks, rinsed for 2 days in water and stored in 50% isopropyl alcohol. voucher specimens were deposited at the tulane university museum of natural history. we estimated clutch size (i.e., clutch fecundity or clutch number) and ovum size using mature, fol- licular oocytes from reproductively mature females (wallace & selman 1981; heins & rabito 1986; heins & baker 1988). using mature females allows ovum size in the blacktail shiner usgs streamﬂow gauging stations located on streams in the pascagoula river drainage, mis- sissippi (fig. 1). using mean daily discharge from the years 1970–1991 (usgs 1991), we calculated a number of ‘‘derived’’ discharge variables for each station. derived discharge variables included measures of annual and monthly variation in dis- charge as well as the average number of days with extreme high and low ﬂows per month. we quantiﬁed annual variation in streamﬂow as the predictability of the streamﬂow regime with colwell’s methods for comparing temporal ﬂuctu- ation in periodic phenomena (colwell 1974; stearns 1980; resh et al. 1988). the more invariant the annual pattern of streamﬂow is from year to year, the more predictable the streamﬂow regime, regardless of whether the pattern is strongly sea- sonal (e.g., discharge in a stream where the rainy and dry seasons are well deﬁned) or very constant (e.g., discharge in a spring fed stream). colwell’s methods give separate measures of predictability due to seasonality (contingency), predictability due to constancy, and overall predictability (sum of the predictabilities due to seasonality and constancy). the matrices we used in computing these measures had time intervals equal to one day and logarith- mic discharge intervals (stearns 1980; resh et al. 1988) that had lower bounds equal to 1.8x and upper bounds equal to 1.8x„1, where x‰0»19. coefﬁcients of variation in ln transformed and untransformed discharge data were calculated for each month and averaged over all years, resulting in monthly average coefﬁcients of variation. coef- ﬁcients of variation in raw discharge data are more sensitive to single, large-ﬂood peaks, whereas coef- ﬁcients of variation in log transformed data are more sensitive to smaller amplitude ﬂuctuations in discharge and droughts (horwitz 1978). to deﬁne more accurately spatial and temporal stream ﬂow patterns, and more speciﬁcally to de- termine when and exactly how ‘‘extra’’ water in streams with higher mean annual runoff is dis- charged, temporal patterns of average and extreme ﬂows were compared among streams. numbers of extreme ﬂows (extremely high and extremely low mean daily discharges), like coefﬁcients of vari- ation in discharge, were calculated on a monthly basis and averaged over all years, resulting in monthly averages of the numbers of ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ ﬂows. our low-ﬂow estimates were based on low-water discharges, which were extremely sensitive to watershed (i.e., catchment) size. we expressed these discharges as functions of drainage area to ensure that low ﬂows were deﬁned the same in streams with similar drainage area, regardless of differences in mean annual runoff and average annual dis- 13 fig 1. collection sites for cyprinella venusta (open circles with letters) and streamﬂow gauging stations (rectangles) in missis- sippi (ms) and alabama (al). letters were assigned to popula- tions in order of increasing runoff. accurate determination of clutch size (heins & ra- bito 1986; heins & baker 1993). moreover, in min- nows ripe eggs are rarely obtained from ﬁeld- caught samples (heins personal observation), and mature oocytes appear to demonstrate accurately variation in the size of ripe eggs (heins & baker 1988). to be concise, we refer to mature oocytes as eggs or ova in this article. following methods used in the earlier study on cyprinella venusta (heins & baker 1987), ten fe- males bearing clutches were randomly chosen from each sample, and their standard lengths (sl) were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm. we extruded eggs from ovaries and counted them to determine clutch size (cs) (heins & rabito 1986; heins & baker 1993). the entire clutch was dried to con- stant mass at 40(cid:190)c and weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g (baker & heins 1994). mean ovum mass (om) for each female was determined by dividing clutch mass by clutch size. in a previous study in- volving 16 populations of cyprinella venusta, heins and baker (1987) found the coefﬁcient of variation in egg size within individual females was always less than the population coefﬁcient of vari- ation, showing that individual females produced eggs of a relatively consistent size. streamﬂow data we obtained estimates of average annual discharge and mean annual runoff (usgs 1991) for 19 machado et al. charge. we deﬁned mean ‘‘low-ﬂow’’ days as the average number of days per month when mean daily discharge was less than 0.281% of the drain- age area value. this cutoff was chosen because it is roughly equivalent to 10% of average annual ﬂow, plus or minus up to 3% depending on the mean annual runoff. so, for example, if the drain- age area was 100 km2, we computed the average number of days that ﬂows were below 0.281 m3 ` s»1. the average annual ﬂow for a stream this size was approximately 2.8 m3 ` s»1.1 the number of ‘‘high-ﬂow’’ days in each month was deﬁned for each station as the average number of days each month when mean daily ﬂow ex- ceeded 75% bankfull discharge (bfd). this was estimated using station-speciﬁc plots (1991 data) of gauge heights (measures of river heights) versus the corresponding instantaneous discharges on log-normal graph paper, and ﬁnding the discharge value at which the rate of increase in gauge height begins to diminish. at this point, stream ﬂow ex- ceeds the capacity of the natural levees and begins to enter the ﬂood plain. we regarded discharges exceeding 75% of this stage as high ﬂows and de- termined the average monthly frequency of occur- rence of these stages for the 19 gauging stations over the 21-year stream ﬂow record. this high-ﬂow measure always exceeded the high extreme of nor- mal seasonal variation in discharge („2 sd) rec- ommended by resh et al.(1988). moreover, be- cause it is based on stream channel proﬁle, it is effectively adjusted to basin size (the larger the stream’s drainage area, the higher its 75% bfd). we also examined the relationship of runoff to the average streamﬂow characteristics (21-year an- nual and monthly means). since runoff is based on watershed area above the point at which it is measured, we adjusted our average discharge measures for drainage area. statistical analysis biom-pc (rohlf 1983), bmdp (dixon 1990), and sas (sas institute 1998) were used for stat- istical analyses. life-history variables were all log10 transformed prior to analysis to satisfy the as- sumptions of anova and ancova (sokal & rohlf 1981). we used regression and correlation analyses to determine the relationships between om and sl of females within each population, among populations (using population means), and among all females combined. differences among populations (sites) in mean 1when using usgs data, which are published using english equivalent mea- sures, the cutoff can be found by multiplying the drainage area in square miles by 0.2. 14 om and sl were tested for signiﬁcance using a one-way analysis of variance (anova). post-hoc comparisons of means were made with newman- keuls (nk) multiple range test. differences among populations in mean clutch size adjusted for the covariate female size (adjusted cs) were tested with analysis of covariance (ancova) and com- pared using the gt-2 multiple range test. because the number of derived variables was large in comparison to the number of gauging sta- tions and populations, multivariate statistics were not used in analyses. population means of life his- tory traits were regressed on average discharge and mean annual runoff separately. relationships be- tween streamﬂow variables, average annual dis- charge, and mean annual runoff were examined using correlations and regression analysis. we used regression analysis to adjust our 21-year annual and monthly mean discharge estimates to a com- mon basin size, and tested the relationship of the residuals from this analysis to runoff. results life-history traits we analyzed the data at three levels: females within populations, means among populations, and all fe- males combined. intrapopulational regressions of om on sl for individual females were non-sig- niﬁcant for seven populations (f‰0.00–3.12;df‰7, p,0.05 for all cases) and signiﬁcant for one popu- lation (population e, f‰6.10, df‰7, p,0.05). re- gression of om on sl using population means was not signiﬁcant (f‰2.45, df‰7, p.0.10). when all females were combined, however, the regression of om on sl was highly signiﬁcant (f‰9.52, df‰79, p,0.01). therefore, we controlled om for sl in subsequent analyses. within populations, regressions of cs on sl were highly signiﬁcant for six populations (f‰ 11.81–45.67; df‰9, p,0.01 for all cases), signiﬁ- cant for one population (population a, f‰8.43, df‰9, p,0.05) and signiﬁcant at p‰0.10 for one population (population h, f‰4.24, df‰9). there were signiﬁcant correlations between cs and sl among population mean values (f‰6.27, df‰7, p,0.05) and all females combined (f‰129.29, df‰ 79, p,0.01). within populations, none of the par- tial correlations of cs and om was signiﬁcant (r‰ »0.458–0.165, df‰7, p.0.05). among population means, however, the correlation between adjusted cs and om was negative and signiﬁcant (r‰ »0.782, df‰5, p,0.05). thus, populations with a greater average om also had a smaller cs when the effects of female size were removed. among populations, there were signiﬁcant dif- ferences in mean om (anova: f‰5.93, df‰7, ovum size in the blacktail shiner p,0.01) and sl (anova: f‰5.09, df‰7, p,0.01). the variances of om (levene’s test: f‰ 0.83, df‰7, p.0.10) and of sl (levene’s test: f‰ 0.55, df‰7, p.0.10) among populations were ho- mogeneous. nk tests identiﬁed three groups of populations (fig. 2) that differed signiﬁcantly for each trait. slopes for within-population regressions of cs on sl were not signiﬁcantly different (ancova: f‰0.7103, df‰7, p.0.05). differences in adjusted cs among populations were signiﬁcant (anco- va: f‰9.263, df‰7, p,0.01). three overlapping subsets of populations differing in adjusted cs were identiﬁed by gt-2 test (fig. 2). relationships between life history traits and streamﬂow parameters regressions of sample means of life history traits on average annual discharge and on mean annual runoff are summarized in table 1. runoff was a signiﬁcant predictor of om, and average discharge was a signiﬁcant predictor of sl. none of the indi- vidual regressions of population variances of life history traits on runoff or average discharge was signiﬁcant. because of the signiﬁcant relationship of om to sl, we tested the residuals from the re- gression for a signiﬁcant relationship to runoff. we found that the residuals showed a highly signiﬁcant relationship df‰79, p,0.0005; r2‰0.245), showing that runoff ex- plains variation in egg weight that cannot be attri- buted to body size differences between popula- tions. (f‰25.25, to runoff streamﬂow parameters overall predictability and predictabilty due to con- stancy were not signiﬁcantly correlated with either mean annual runoff or stream size as indicated by average annual discharge (table 2). predictability due to contingency (seasonality) was highly and negatively correlated with mean annual runoff (table 2), suggesting that, as mean annual runoff increases, there is less predictability in the seasonal pattern of streamﬂow. average annual discharge was highly, signiﬁ- cantly and negatively correlated with all of the monthly coefﬁcients of variation in discharge (r‰ »0.879 to »0.616; df‰17, p,0.01 for all cases) and ln transformed discharge values (r‰»0.920 to »0.783; df‰17, p,0.01 for all cases). the corre- lations between mean annual runoff and the coef- ﬁcients of variation in untransformed discharge in december (r‰»0.476, df‰18, p,0.05) and jan- uary (r‰»0.549, df‰18, p,0.05) were negative and signiﬁcant. when the linear effects

particular ﬂow for all the stations com- bined is represented by the solid line with squares. in all months except january and april, the cor- relations between the average number of low-ﬂow days and average annual discharge were high and negative (fig. 3). from june through november the average number of low-ﬂow days was signiﬁ- cantly and negatively correlated with mean annual runoff (fig. 3). correlations between runoff and the monthly average number of high-ﬂow days were nonsigniﬁcant in all months, but showed a trend of increasing correlation in the low-ﬂow months of august (r‰0.304, p‰0.22), september (r‰0.320, p‰0.19), and october (r‰0.359, p‰ 0.14). in contrast, the correlation for january–ap- ril averaged 0.171 (range, 0.148–0.173), whereas the mean correlation for may–july was 0.265 (range, 0.249–0.281) and the mean correlation for november–december was 0.250 (range, 0.233– 0.266). residuals from the regression of average annual discharge on drainage area were highly sig- niﬁcantly related to runoff (f‰25.53, df‰16, p,0.0005; r2‰0.615), indicating that ﬂows are in- deed higher on average in high-runoff streams. the higher ﬂows apparently are not conﬁned to par- ticular months of the year because none of the drainage-area adjusted, average monthly discharge estimates was signiﬁcantly related to runoff. table 1. results of regressions of life history traits

observations of variation among life history traits are generally consistent with prior studies of cyprinids from the gulf coastal plain. the lack of a signiﬁcant relationship between egg size and fe- male size within populations is in agreement with previous observations for cyprinella venusta (heins & dorsett 1986; heins & baker 1987). al- though we did not ﬁnd a trade off between egg size and clutch size within populations, there was one among populations, as was the case in the study of c. venusta by heins & baker (1987). we found correlations between egg size and mean annual runoff among populations within a single drainage system, whereas correlations in previous studies have involved populations from different drainages (heins & baker 1987; heins 1991; heins & baker 1992). our results for sl and mean annual runoff differ from those of the pre- vious studies in which sl also was correlated with mean annual runoff among populations of differ- ent drainages. in the pascagoula river drainage, high runoff is associated with low predictability in the seasonal pattern of ﬂow (predictability is low overall), less tendency for extreme ﬂows (as measured by cv) december–march, fewer low ﬂow days june–no- vember, and a tendency for more high ﬂows aug- ust–september. discharge integrates complex environmental conditions because it determines, in part, current velocity (statzner et al. 1988), habitat volume, channel geomorphology, and substratum stability (poff & ward 1989; resh et al. 1988). conclusions about relationships between measures of variation in discharge and disturbance regime should be drawn with caution (statzner et al. 1988; poff 1992). the results of the present study suggest that simple coefﬁcients of variation in discharge (as compared to differences in measures of extreme ﬂows, i.e. the number of ﬂoods) are less than ideal disturbance measures. although the coefﬁcients of variation in discharge were lower in winter in streams with greater mean annual runoff, these streams did not experience signiﬁcantly fewer dis- turbances in the form of extreme ﬂows at this time of year. the results of correlations of mean annual runoff and predictability measures were consistent with results obtained from correlations of mean annual runoff and extreme ﬂows but not nearly as informative. at larger geographical scales, meas- ures of variation in discharge may be more useful, because differences in streamﬂow variation due to factors other than stream size may be large (e.g. poff & ward 1989). the increase in the average number of high ﬂows from august to september could represent disturb- ance along an environmental axis deﬁned by mean annual runoff for organisms that are negatively affected by high discharge or high mean water velocity. we found no evidence that high-runoff streams are more prone to ﬂow shortages during seasonal periods of low ﬂow. thus, it is unlikely that selection on egg size in high-runoff streams is the result of reduced cover for prey (resh et al. 1988) or increased competition for space and re- sources (glova & duncan 1985). high discharges can have detrimental effects on minnow populations (starrett 1950; schlosser 1985) and the benthic fauna (power et al. 1988; resh et al. 1988). harvey (1987) reported that lar- val ﬁshes less than 10 mm sl suffered substantial downstream displacement (in both ﬁeld and lab- oratory), and mortality (ﬁeld only) after ﬂoods. fishes greater than 10 mm sl were much less sus- ceptible to ﬂoods and relatively high discharge. newly hatched walleye and suckers are also dis- ovum size in the blacktail shiner placed downstream at stream velocities greater than 7 cm ` s»1 (corbett & powles 1986). eggs, larvae, and small young of c. venusta are present from summer to fall, a time when high- runoff streams show higher sustained ﬂows than low runoff streams and a trend toward more high ﬂows. blacktail shiners favor ﬂowing, open-water habitats at all life-history stages, including during spawning (baker et al. 1994). the species is not known to use quieter ﬂood-plain habitats at times of ﬂooding, as seen in other cyprinids (ross & baker 1983; turner et al. 1994). if c. venusta larvae and young are susceptible to higher mortality in high-runoff streams, larvae from larger eggs may be at reduced risk due to larger body size and greater swimming strength relative to larvae and young from smaller eggs, or they may more quickly attain a size at which high discharge is less likely to cause mortality. large eggs have a higher energy content (quattro & weeks 1991) and result in larger offspring (e.g. blaxter & hempel 1963; wallace & aasjord 1984; beacham & murray 1990) than small eggs. there is evidence that larger offspring are stronger (har- vey 1987) and have higher rates of survival when fed (hutchings 1991) and when starved (blaxter & hempel 1963; marsh 1986; hutchings 1991). marsh (1986) found that larvae from larger eggs of etheostoma spectabile were able to survive longer without food, but, if the larvae were fed the differ- ences disappeared. marteinsdottir & able (1992) found that differences among larvae from different sized eggs of fundulus heteroclitus (l.) were main- tained after 42 weeks. previous research has shown geographical vari- ation in life history traits within species to be as- sociated with ﬂuctuations in stream ﬂow (con- stantz 1979; baltz & moyle 1982; heins & baker 1987), differences in climate and temperature (marsh 1984; mills 1988; vollestad & abe´e-lund 1990), distributions of predators (reznick & endler 1982) and reservoir ﬂuctuations (scribner et al. 1992). in the latter two studies the differences were shown to be heritable. we do not as yet know whether the microgeographical variation in egg size we observed for c. venusta has a genetic basis, although there are indirect indications of a genetic basis for the macrogeographical differences ob- served in other studies. if variation in ovum size is genetically determined, selection for egg size as- sociated with mean annual runoff may be strong, as the potential for dispersal and gene ﬂow within the pascagoula river drainage is greater than among the drainages that have been used in pre- vious studies of ovum size variation in minnows (heins & baker 1987; heins 1991). we conclude that there are aspects of streamﬂow 17 machado et al. related to mean annual runoff that potentially could act as a selective agent causing adaptive vari- ation in egg size. flows are generally greater in high-runoff streams, and high ﬂows that could cause density-independent mortality of ﬁsh larvae tend to occur more frequently in these streams at times when larval and young c. venusta are pres- ent. the larger egg sizes seen in these streams might reduce the chances of ﬂow-related mortality for young c. venusta. alternatively, the variation in egg size we observed in this study may be due to the effects of genetic drift or phenotypic plasticity (endler 1973, 1986; mann & mills 1985; lobon´- cervia´ et al. 1997). resumen 1. estudio previos pusieron de maniﬁesto una fuerte correlacio´n positiva

una correlacio´n similar entre el taman˜o del hue- vo y la escorrentı´a. ası´, la relacio´n entre el taman˜o del huevo y la escorrentı´a existe a una escala espacial mucho menor (den- tro de la cuenca) que la apuntada en otros estudios (basados en variacio´n entre cuencas). 3. intentamos tambie´n establecer un enlace entre la escorrentı´a media anual y las alteraciones producidas por el caudal tal y como indica el grado de predictibilidad del caudal total, los coeﬁcientes de variacio´n medios mensuales del caudal y el nu´- mero de dias entre el caudal mayor y menor. aunque la predic- tibilidad del caudal no diﬁrio´ entre rı´os, aquellos con una ma- yor escorrentı´a anual media se caracterizaron por tener meno- res coeﬁcientes de variacio´n en invierno, menos dias de caudal extremadamente bajo y tendencia hacia mayores caudales al ﬁnal del verano o principios de oton˜o. mayores coeﬁcientes de variacio´n a escala de cuenca, no reﬂejaron con precisio´n el nu´- mero de caudales extremos. estos resultados cuestionan el uso de coeﬁcientes de variacio´n de caudal como indicador de altera- ciones. 4. dado que tanto los huevos como las larvas y juveniles de c. venusta esta´n presentes durante el ﬁnal del verano y el principio del oton˜o cuando los caudales de los rı´os con mayor escorrentı´a tienden a ser mayores que los rı´os con menor escorrentı´a, con- cluimos que estos grandes caudales pueden actuar como fuerza selectiva capaz de causar evolucio´n hacia mayores taman˜os de huevos. alternativamente, la variacio´n en el taman˜o de huevo observada en este estudio podrı´a ser debida a efectos de deriva gene´tica o plasticidad fenotı´pica. acknowledgments we thank j. michael guill for assistance with ﬁeld collections. mike taylor processed the deposition
