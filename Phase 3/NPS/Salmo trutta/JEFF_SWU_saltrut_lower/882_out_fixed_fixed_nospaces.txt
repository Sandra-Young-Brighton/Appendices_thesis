connell 1975; sih et al. 1985; power 1992). the structuring role of predation is particularly evident when predators are introduced outside their native range (thorp 1986). although only a small minority of nonindigenous species signiﬁcantly affect invaded biotas (simberloff 1981; williamson 1996), when deleterious impacts occur, they often involve predation (lodge 1993a). in particular, predation has been implicated as a major mechanism for species extinctions in invaded com- munities (simberloff 1981; moyle & light 1996a; mooney & cleland 2001). in aquatic systems, top predators have been shown to exert the greatest negative impact on invaded com- munities (courtenay & moyle 1992). the best-known example involves the introduction of the nile perch lates niloticus to lake victoria, which resulted in the extinction of over 200 of the 400 native haplochro- mine cichlids (ogutu-ohwayo 1999). in the united states, introductions of predatory centrarchids to western states have decimated native ﬁsh species already impacted by habitat alteration (moyle 1976; minckley 1991). in the great lakes, predation by introduced lamprey, alewife and rainbow smelt has dramatically altered ﬁsh assemblages (moyle 1986) facilitating further invasion of the ecosystem (pres- ently more than 140 nonindigenous species) (mills et al. 1993). serious predatory impacts, however, not only result from large piscivorous species, but also from smaller omnivorous ﬁshes (moyle & light 1996b). predation by introduced mosquitoﬁsh, gambusia afﬁnis and gambusia holbrooki, has been implicated in the extir- pation of native ﬁshes, amphibians and invertebrates 352 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00109.x (myers 1965; schoenherr 1981; meffe 1985; courte- nay & meffe 1989; lloyd 1989; gamradt & kats 1996; howe et al. 1997; goodsell & kats 1999). mosquitoﬁsh are aggressive foragers, feeding on a variety of prey, including the eggs, fry and larvae of native biota (goodell et al. 2000). this is presumably the reason why they were widely introduced as a biocontrol agent against mosquitoes (and mosquito- borne diseases) in the early and mid- 1900s (krumholz 1948). presently, they are considered among the 100 worst invasive species worldwide (lowe et al. 2000). in this study, we examined the foraging behaviour of these two highly invasive species in an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying their high invasion success and impact. the impact that invaders have on invaded com- munities should be intimately related to the invad- ers’ niche breadth (shea & chesson 2002). invading species with wider ecological niches will likely interact with a greater number of species (goodell et al. 2000). for impacts via predation, diet breadth should be of particular interest. diet generalists should have greater impacts than specialists (ehrlich 1986; ebenhard 1988; but see bøhn & amundsen 2001) and greater overall invasion success as prey resources may be rarely limiting (moyle & light 1996b). to explore how diet breadth and feeding behaviour relate to invasiveness and impact, we compared feeding rates, feeding prefer- ences and diet breadths of the highly invasive (and high impact) mosquitoﬁsh species to two noninva- sive congeners. comparisons of closely related species are an insightful approach to the identiﬁca- tion of key traits conferring invasiveness (mack 1996; e.g., rejmanek & richardson 1996). two gambusia species of relatively low invasive poten- tial, g. geiseri and g. hispaniolae, were chosen for comparison. we hypothesized that g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki should exhibit both greater feeding rates and greater diet breadth (i.e. less diet prefer- ence) than g. geiseri and g. hispaniolae. in general, methods we quantiﬁed the feeding behaviour of 12 females of each gambusia species in a sequence of four individ- ual feeding trials. in the ﬁrst three trials, maximum feeding rates on three different live prey items were quantiﬁed (one prey type per trial). in the fourth trial, the three prey items (in the same quantities as in ﬁrst three trials) were offered to females simultaneously and total maximum feeding rates, feeding preferences and diet breadths were measured. females used in the experiment consisted of wild, gravid adults collected from within each species native range in the summer and fall of 1999. in gambusia foraging behaviour gambusia, males typically reduce foraging and growth when sexually mature (krumholz 1948) and may have a more specialized diet than females (crivelli & boy 1987; blanco et al. 2004). thus, females have a greater potential to impact prey communities. adult females are also the gender and age class of interest in an invasion context. female gambusia are multiple-inseminated and able to store sperm for long periods of time (zane et al. 1999), which allows them to start populations on their own without negative founder effects (chesser et al. 1984). gambusia geiseri and g. afﬁnis females were collec- ted from comal springs and the comal river, respect- in comal county, tx. gambusia holbrooki ively, females were collected from leon hines lake, escam- bia county, al, and g. hispaniolae females were collected from la azufrada spring, lake enriquillo, dominican republic. the prey chosen for the study differed in micro- habitat use and size; therefore, we maintained prey biomass constant (approximately 0.020 g) and varied prey number. in each trial, we used 40 daphnia pulex (planktonic, 2.0 mm approximate length), 20 ﬂightless drosophila melanogaster (neustonic, 3.5 mm approxi- mate length), and 15 isopods lirceus fontinalis (benthic, 4.0 mm approximate length). daphnia were collected from pond cultures at the university of kentucky ecological research facility, lexington, ky, and lirceus isopods were collected from glenns creek, woodford county, ky. drosophila were obtained from laboratory colonies also at the univer- sity of kentucky. feeding trials were conducted in 6 l plastic tanks in two 9-day blocks (24 ﬁsh per block) in december 1999 and january 2000. once isolated from stock tanks, females were given 48 h (days 1 and 2) to acclimate to individual tanks and were fed tetraminò ﬂakes (tetra werke, melle, germany) ad libitum. prior to the experiment, females were not fed the experi- mental prey; instead, females consumed ﬂakes and brine shrimp nauplii ad libitum. on days 3, 5 and 7, we conducted feeding trials with each single prey type. the order of the trials was randomized, so that for each species, two females experienced each of the six possible sequences. to standardize hunger levels, we conducted ad libitum feedings in between trials (days 4, 6 and 8) followed by a starvation period. fish were allowed to consume ﬂakes for 30 min, and then ﬂakes were removed (23.5 h prior to next trial). on day 9, we conducted preference trials with all prey combined. no refuges or substrate were provided for either the prey or the gambusia. for the duration of the experiment, temperatures were maintained at 22.5 °c water (±0.77) and photoperiod was kept constant at 14 h light:10 h dark. periodic water changes (50% of volume) were conducted to maintain water quality 353 rehage et al. instead of using aeration or ﬁlters that might interfere with prey or gambusia foraging behaviour. trials ran for either 10 min or until all prey were consumed. from observations conducted during trials, we calculated maximum feeding rates (number of prey consumed divided by trial duration). to quantify feeding preferences in the fourth trial, we computed selection indices wi for each prey item (manly et al. 1993): wi ¼ ci ai ð1þ where ci is the proportion of prey i consumed and ai is the proportion of prey i available. selection indices were then standardized (so that they add up to 1.0) by dividing each selection index by the sum of the three indices: si ¼ wip wi ð2þ as three prey were available to gambusia, selection indices above 0.33 indicate relative preference, whereas values below 0.33 indicate relative avoidance. to assess diet breadth, we then calculated hurlbert’s (1978) measure of niche breadth, n: n ¼ 1p i =aiþ ðc2 ð3þ where ci and ai are as deﬁned above. diet breadth was also standardized using the following equation: b ¼ n   amin 1   amin ð4þ where amin is the smallest proportion of prey available. statistical analyses a repeated measures ancova with female size (standard length) as a covariate was used to test for a species effect on the four feeding rates. species differences on the feeding preference and diet breadth measures were tested with a manova followed by anovas or ancovas if female size was a signiﬁcant covariate. female size distributions overlapped among the four species (figs 1 and 2). mean female size was intermediate for the invasive species (30.0 cm for g. holbrooki, and 35.0 cm for g. afﬁnis), largest for g. hispaniolae (36.7 cm) and smallest for g. geiseri (27.4 cm). to meet parametric test assumptions, feeding rates were log-transformed (ln of observed value + 1) and selection indices and diet breadths were arcsin square-root transformed prior to analysis. t-tests were used to test whether mean selection indices for each gambusia species differed from 0.33 (the no-preference value). simple linear regressions were used to test the nature of the relationship between female size and the foraging variables if size was a signiﬁcant covariate. preliminary analyses indicated no effect of prey sequence or the time blocking factor (a) 60  a i n h p a d n o r f 50 40 30 20 10 0 20 invasives non-invasives (b) 20 a l i h p o s o r d n o r f 15 10 5 0 25 30 female sl (mm) 35 40 45 20 25 30 female sl (mm) 35 40 45 (c) s u e c r i l n o r f  5 4 3 2 1 0 (d) 10 y e r p l l a n o r f  8 6 4 2 0 20 25 35 30 female sl (mm) 40 45 20 25 35 30 female sl (mm) 40 45 354 female standard length (sl) fig. 1. feeding rates (fr) in numbers of prey consumed per minute of trial time on (a) daphnia, (b) drosophila, (c) lirceus and (d) on all three prey combined as a function of in cm. separate least-squares regression functions were ﬁtted to the invasive g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki (solid lines;

fig. 1a–c). on average, gam- busia females consumed eight daphnia, two dro- sophila, and one lirceus per minute of trial time (bonferroni pairwise comparisons, all p < 0.0001). feeding rates on all three prey combined during trial 4 were comparable with feeding rates on daphnia alone, but higher that rates on the other two prey (all three prey combined versus daphnia: p ¼ 0.198, other comparisons: p < 0.0001). feeding rates also varied among gambusia species (table 1). orthogonal con- trasts showed that feeding rates were consistently higher for invasive gambusia than their noninvasive relatives (f1,42 ¼ 6.8, p ¼ 0.012). feeding rates on daphnia were two and a half times higher for the invasive females (fig. 1a). similarly, feeding rates on drosophila and lirceus were 50% and 70% higher respectively for invasives (fig. 1b and c). feeding rates when all three prey types were available were 30% higher for g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki compared with g. geiseri and g. hispaniolae (fig. 1d). we detected no difference in feeding rates between the two invasive species (g. holbrooki versus g. afﬁnis: f1,42 ¼ 0.04, p ¼ 0.844), nor between the two (g. geiseri versus g. hispaniolae: noninvasives f1,42 ¼ 1.2, p ¼ 0.273). the manova comparing the preference and diet breadth measures showed no species effect (wilks’ lambda, f12,101 ¼ 0.7, p ¼ 0.75) indicating that inva- sive and noninvasive gambusia exhibited similar feeding preferences and diet breadth. individual anovas and ancovas conﬁrmed this result (species effects: daphnia, f3,40 ¼ 0.4, p ¼ 0.73; drosophila, f3,41 ¼ 1.0, p ¼ 0.38; and lirceus, f3,40 ¼ 1.1, p ¼ 0.38). in general, all species preferred daphnia, consumed drosophila in proportion to their availab- ility, and avoided lirceus (fig. 2a). for daphnia, table 1. summary of results from a repeated measures ancova performed on feeding rates measured on the three individual prey items (daphnia, drosophila and lirceus sp.) in trials 1–3, and on all prey combined during trial 4. effect species female size feeding rates feeding rates · species d.f. 3, 42 1, 42 3, 129 9, 129 f 2.9 13.2 61.1 1.5 p-value 0.047 0.001 0.0001 0.16 355 rehage et al. selection indices of all gambusia were consistently higher than 0.33 (t-tests; g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki: p ¼ 0.001, g. hispaniolae: p ¼ 0.036, and g. geiseri: p ¼ 0.003), whereas for lirceus, selection indices were consistently lower than 0.33 (p ¼ 0.0001 for all species). diet breadths also did not differ signiﬁcantly among the species (f3,40 ¼ 0.6, p ¼ 0.60; fig. 2b). hurlbert’ measure of diet breadth averaged 0.72 for g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki and 0.68 for g. geiseri and g. hispaniolae reﬂecting the fact that females con- sumed primarily two of the three prey items available (daphnia and drosophila) (fig. 2a). foraging behaviour. generally, as may be expected, ﬁsh size affected most measures of larger gambusia fed at higher rates, although the relationship between size and foraging rates seem to be more consistent in invasive gambusia. all four invasive feeding rates were positively related to ﬁsh size; whereas for the noninvasives, only rates on dro- sophila and all prey combined were signiﬁcantly related to size (fig. 1). when given a choice, larger ﬁsh also had broader diets (covariate in ancova: f1,40 ¼ 8.0, p ¼ 0.007), although the relationship between size and diet breadth was not particularly strong (r2 ¼ 0.18, p ¼ 0.003) (fig. 2b). as female size increased, preference for lirceus, the largest increased (covariate in ancova: f1,40 ¼ 8.3, prey, p ¼ 0.006; regression: r2 ¼ 0.10, p ¼ 0.021); and preference for daphnia, the smallest prey, decreased (covariate in ancova: f1,40 ¼ 8.0, p ¼ 0.007; regres- sion: r2 ¼ 0.18, p ¼ 0.002). only larger gambusia appeared able to incorporate the larger prey items into their diets, thus increasing their diet breadth. discussion the foraging behaviour of predatory species is expected to be a key factor affecting their invasiveness and impact in invaded communities (lodge 1993b). species or organisms that are opportunistic foragers and diet generalists are typically expected to achieve greater invasion success and impact. however, few studies of foraging behaviour (and of behaviour in general) have tested this expectation (holway & suarez 1999). furthermore, few invasion studies address empirically (parker & reichard 1998; williamson 1999) or comparatively (vermeij 1996). in invasive gambusia, research on foraging behaviour is clearly needed to better under- stand the impact of their introductions (garcia-berthou 1999). the results from this simple comparative study invasive gambusia species provide evidence that might be superior foragers relative to noninvasive congeners. gambusia afﬁnis and g. holbrooki exhibited higher feeding rates on all prey tested compared with their noninvasive relatives, g. geiseri and these questions 356 g. hispaniolae. in a previous study with the same prey, g. afﬁnis and g. holbrooki also foraged more efﬁciently and consumed more prey than g. geiseri and g. hispaniolae (rehage et al. 2005). however, diet preference and breadth results con- tradict the classic notion that invasive species, espe- cially those with signiﬁcant predatory impact, should have broad diets (ehrlich 1986; lodge 1993b; moyle & light 1996a). selection indices on the three prey used in the experiment and overall diet breadth were identical for invasive and noninvasive gambusia. all gambusia preferred daphnia, the smallest prey item, exhibited no signiﬁcant preference for drosophila, and avoided lirceus. this lack of variation among species is an artefact of the particular prey used or the small number of prey items included in the study. alternatively, strong differences in prey proﬁtability and density may have resulted in females of all species making similar foraging choices (see below). future work should include preference assays with a greater variety of prey in conjunction with gut content and stable isotope analyses to better elucidate the link between diet breadth and mosquitoﬁsh invasiveness and predatory impact. is plausible that it whereas little is known about the foraging beha- viour of noninvasive gambusia, invasive mosquitoﬁsh are considered generalist predators (farley 1980). the mosquitoﬁsh diet is typically composed of zooplank- ton, drifting and benthic invertebrates, and terrestrial and neustonic prey (lloyd et al. 1986; garcia-berthou 1999). mosquitoﬁsh are known to signiﬁcantly alter aquatic communities because of their direct predatory effects on these organisms, particularly zooplankton (hurlbert et al. 1972; hurlbert & mulla 1981; harris 1995; margaritora et al. 2001; blanco et al. 2004). stomach-content analyses show that crustaceans inclu- ding daphniids often constitute a signiﬁcant proportion of the diet (hurlbert & mulla 1981; crivelli & boy 1987; blaustein & karban 1990; garcia-berthou 1999). the higher feeding rates and strong preference for daphnia pulex seen in ﬁsh in our experiment concur with these dietary observations. that females, we expect although, our study only examined the foraging behaviour of the higher foraging rates of invasives females are representative of other life stages, at least juveniles. male mosqui- toﬁsh signiﬁcantly reduce foraging once mature (krumholz 1948; blanco et al. 2004), and we would expect the same to be true for other gambusia species. invasive juveniles may be expected to feed more voraciously than noninvasive juveniles, although not necessarily on the same prey items as adults. diet overlap among life stages may be high, but during the reproductive season female diet has been shown to shift signiﬁcantly (crivelli & boy 1987). ontogenetic diet shifts have been documented in invasive gambusia; juveniles consume smaller prey such as diatoms, rotifers and copepod nauplii, and as adults may switch to larger prey, such as chironomids and cladocerans (garcia-berthou 1999; blanco et al. 2004). responses or in invaded areas, mosquitoﬁsh feed opportunisti- cally on naive prey that have no evolutionary history with mosquitoﬁsh predation. naive prey, often eggs and larval stages of amphibians and ﬁshes, either completely lack antipredator show responses that are ineffective against novel predation by mosquitoﬁsh (e.g. gamradt & kats 1996). this trophic opportunism allows mosquitoﬁsh to decimate local prey populations and threatens the long-term persistence of many aquatic species in invaded communities (meffe 1985; courtenay & meffe 1989; arthington 1991). the higher foraging rates of invasive gambusia across different prey noted in our trials are consistent with this opportunistic foraging style. alternatively, these higher foraging rates may have resulted from a prior preference or experience with similar prey since we used wild females. it is also plausible that differences in energetic requirements stemming from their experiences in the wild may underlie this variation in foraging rates. future studies in this and other examining foraging behaviour systems would beneﬁt from removing potentially confounding effect of experience and condition by using laboratory-reared individuals the have been fed standardized diets. feeding preferences were highest for daphnia, intermediate for drosophila, and lowest for lirceus. these results contradict the simple expectation that large prey should be preferred because of their higher energy content (werner & hall 1974). however, larger prey may not necessarily be more proﬁtable. prey proﬁtability (energy per unit handling time) may decrease with increasing prey size if handling and/or digestion times become disproportionately large (bence & murdoch 1986; kaiser et al. 1992; sih & christensen 2001). this may explain the strong preference for daphnia in all four gambusia species. daphnia may have been in fact the most proﬁtable prey, (although not directly quantiﬁed) seemed virtually instantaneous for daph- nia, but were relatively long for drosophila and even longer for lirceus (j. s. rehage, personal observa- tion). previous studies on invasive gambusia foraging behaviour have shown that these ﬁsh often preferen- tially consume small prey (bence & murdoch 1986; arthington 1991; garcia-berthou 1999). as handling times the strong preference for daphnia may have also resulted from a prey density effect: gambusia were attacking and consuming the most frequently detected prey. encounter rates were most likely higher and search times lower for daphnia relative to the other gambusia foraging behaviour two prey species, not only because daphnia were in the highest density, but also because daphnia were in the water column whereas ﬂies and isopods were limited to either the water surface or the tank bottom. these differences in prey distribution may have resulted in distinct prey patches, in which case prey density may matter. although optimal foragers are typically expected to ignore density and choose prey according to proﬁtability only (macarthur & pianka 1966), if prey are patchy, foragers should respond to density by spending more time in the most proﬁtable patches (i.e. the water column) where prey are aggregated (hassell & may 1974). regardless of the mechanism and contrary to our predictions, invasive and noninvasive gambusia seemed to be making identical foraging choices, and thus exhibiting very similar diet preferences and equal diet breadths, at least at the scale of this experiment. although size distributions were similar among invasive and noninvasive gambusia (and mean sizes were intermediate for invasives), female size affected all foraging variables. the effect was similar for the invasive and noninvasive species. larger ﬁsh of both species types consumed more prey per unit time and were able to include larger prey items into their diet, increasing diet breadth. this result may have important implications for gambusia impact in light of recent research documenting body size changes in invaded communities. several studies have reported greater body sizes for invaders in their invaded range relative to their native range (crawley 1987; willis & blossey 1999; grosholz & ruiz 2003; leger & rice 2003), presumably a response to a release from natural enemies in the introduced range (keane & crawley 2002). introduced gambusia have been shown to have lower loads of parasites than either ecologically similar native ﬁshes in the invaded range or their native populations (dove 2000). this enemy release could allow gambusia to achieve greater sizes in invaded areas; and according to our results, these larger ﬁsh will also have higher feeding rates and diet breadth, and the potential for greater impact. a few studies have examined whether diet or diet breadth is a key correlate of invasion success and impact. among them, studies on birds introduced to oceanic inlands provide some of the best evidence on the relationship between species-speciﬁc traits and invasion success given that detailed records exist on both failed and successful introductions (kolar & lodge 2001). in such studies, the relevance of diet as a predictor of invasion success has mixed support. mclain et al. (1999) reported diet to be a signiﬁcant predictor (among other traits) of introduction success for 132 bird species brought to nine oceanic islands. bird species that incorporated both seeds and fruit into their diets were more likely to establish than more 357 rehage et al. restricted foragers. duncan et al. (2001) found that omnivorous and carnivorous diets were good predic- tors of establishment success for birds introduced to australia but were unrelated to the amount of spread of these species. diet breath was not correlated with establishment in birds introduced to new zealand (veltman et al. 1996). found that neither among ﬁshes, evidence on the signiﬁcance of diet breadth as an important ecological trait conferring invasiveness is also conﬂicting. marchetti et al. (2004) showed that for nonindigenous ﬁshes in california, diet breadth was not a good predictor of establishment but was positively correlated with spread and abun- dance (surrogates for impact) in invaded watersheds. kolar & lodge (2002) the establishment, spread, nor impact of nonindigenous ﬁshes in the great lakes region was predicted by diet breadth. these studies seem to indicate that the predictive power of diet breadth in the context of invasion success and impact might be limited. this may be especially true when we compare diet breadth to life-history characters (sakai et al. 2001) and characteristics of the invasion effort (i.e. propagule pressure) (williamson 1999), which seem to consis- tently correlate with measures of invasion success. future studies on the foraging behaviour of invasive species might focus not just on diet breadth, but on other aspects of foraging, such as voracity per se and other measures of foraging plasticity (e.g. foraging innovations; sol et al. 2002). resumen 1. los efectos negativos causados por especies introducidas e invasoras generalmente ocurren a trave´s de la predacion. para estas especies, la magnitud de sus efectos esta ı´ntimamente relacionada con caracterı´sticas de su comportamiento de forrajeo y dieta. en esta investigacio´ n, comparamos el comportamiento de forrajeo de dos especies de peces invasoras y de gran impacto en comunidades acua´ticas invadidas, gambusia afﬁnis y gambusia holbrooki, a dos especies muy relacionadas pero no invasoras, g. geiseri y g. hispaniolae. comparar especies muy relacionadas es un me´todo u´ til para detectar su habilidad para invadir nuevas comunidades. 2. en tres experimentos, cuantiﬁcamos tasas de alimentacio´ n ma´ximas en tres presas diferentes, daphnia pulex, drosophila melanogaster y lirceus fontinalis, ofrecidas individualmente a hembras de cada especie de gambusia. en un cuarto experi- mento, las tres presas fueron ofrecidas a la vez, sobre las que calculamos las tasas de alimentacio´ n totales, preferencias diete´ticas y amplitud de dietas de las especies de gambusia. 3. las especies invasoras g. afﬁnis y g. holbrooki consumieron las tres presas (ofrecidas individualmente o juntas) en tasas consistemente mas altas que g. geiseri y g. hispaniolae. en contra de nuestra expectativa, no encontramos diferencias ni en los ı´ndices de preferencia ni en la amplitud de dieta entre las especies invasoras y no invasoras. las cuatro especies de gambusia demostraron preferencia por las presas ma´s pequen˜as 358 i.e., daphnia, consumieron drosophila en proporcio´ n a su existencia y evitaron consumir las presas mas grandes i.e. lirceus. el taman˜o de las hembras afecto´ a la mayorı´a de las variables medidas en nuestro estudio. los individuos mayores de gambusia demostraron tasas de alimentacio´n ma´s altas y consumieron presas ma´s grandes, incrementando ası´ la ampli- tud de sus dietas. acknowledgements we thank e. maurer, p. crowley and h. yan for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript, and c. hubbs and c. rodriguez for their assistance with ﬁsh collections. this work was supported by a nsf graduate research fellowship to jsr and nsf ddig deb-0206542 to jsr, as and p. crowley. references arthington, a.h. 1991. ecological and genetic impacts of introduced and translocated freshwater ﬁshes in australia. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 48: 33– 43. bøhn, t. & amundsen, p.-a. 2001. the competitive edge of an invading species. ecology 82: 2150–2163. bence, j.r. & murdoch, w.w. 1986. prey size selection by the theory. ecology relation to optimal diet mosquitoﬁsh: 67:324–336. blanco, s., romo, s. & villena, m-j. 2004. experimental study on the diet of mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia holbrooki) under different ecological conditions in a shallow lake. international review of hydrobiology 89: 250–262. blaustein, l. & karban, r. 1990. indirect effects of the mosquitoﬁsh gambusia afﬁnis on the mosquito culex tarsalis. limnology and oceonography 35: 767–771. chesser, r.k., smith, m.w. & smith, m.h. 1984. biochemical genetics of mosquitoﬁsh. iii. incidence and signiﬁcance of multiple insemination. genetica 64: 77–81. connell, j.h. 1975. some mechanisms producing structure in natural communities. in: cody, m.l. & diamond, j.m., eds. ecology and evolution of communities. cambridge, ma: belknap, pp. 460–490. courtenay, w.r. & meffe, g.k. 1989. small ﬁshes in strange places: a review of introduced poeciliids. in: meffe, g.k. & snelson, f.f., eds. ecology and evolution of livebearing ﬁshes (poeciliidae). englewood cliffs, nj: prentice hall, pp. 319–331. courtenay, w.r. & moyle, p.b. 1992. crimes against lasting legacy of ﬁsh introductions. biodiversity: transactions of the north american wildlife and natural resources conference 57: 365–372. the crawley, m.j. 1987. what makes a community invasible?
