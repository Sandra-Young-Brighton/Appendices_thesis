ecology of freshwater fish 2013: 22: 257–267 ó 2013 john wiley & sons a/s ecology of freshwater fish body size distributions in north american freshwater ﬁsh: small-scale factors and synthesis david grifﬁths school of environmental sciences, university of ulster, coleraine bt52 1sa, uk accepted for publication november 26, 2012 abstract – the ecosystem size/trophic structure hypothesis predicts that the shape of body size distributions will change with ecosystem size because of increases in the relative importance of large, predatory, species. i test the hypothesis by examining the statistical moments, as measures of shape, of species body size distributions of north american freshwater ﬁsh assemblages in lakes. species lists, coupled with dietary and body size information, are used to document the patterns. body size distributions in small lakes are unimodal and right-skewed, but distributions become more symmetrical and bimodal in large ecosystems. in small lakes, body sizes are generally small and ﬁsh trophic levels low, but size and trophic level increase up to lake volumes of about 0.001 km3, and change little in larger lakes. adding trophic level to the analysis greatly improves the variance explained by the body size–lake size relation. the conclusions of grifﬁths (2012, global ecology & biogeography 21: 383-392), that postglacial recolonisation and evolutionary change are important determinants of body size distributions at regional and larger scales, are combined with those of this study. mean body size in local assemblages of lake- dwelling species is larger than in regional and continental ones. overall, body size distributions are affected by processes operating at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, with the type, size and duration of the ecosystem probably playing a central role by inﬂuencing the proportions of vagile and predatory species, the species which dominate the large size mode. key words: ecosystem size; trophic structure; skewness; kurtosis; bimodality introduction a variety of energetic, evolutionary, biogeographic and ecosystem processes have been suggested to inﬂuence the shape of species body size distributions (allen et al. 2006). both physical constraints and biotic interactions affect the body size distributions of the species assemblages that occur in aquatic, and other, ecosystems. large species require large home ranges (minns 1995; woolnough et al. 2008) and tend to be predatory (brose et al. 2006; cohen 2007; romanuk et al. 2010). physically larger ecosystems support more (the species-area relation; rosenzweig 1995) and larger species, for both energetic and pop- ulation dynamic reasons, while food chain length (fcl) has been suggested to increase with ecosystem size and/or ecosystem productivity (schoener 1989; cohen & newman 1991; holt 1993; vander zanden et al. 1999). tests, mainly in lakes and streams, but also in experimental microcosms, pitcher plants and islands, have found support for the ecosystem size hypothesis (spencer & warren 1996; vander zanden et al. 1999; post et al. 2000; thompson & townsend 2005; takimoto et al. 2008; doi et al. 2009; mchugh et al. 2010; baiser et al. 2012). i extend this hypothesis by predicting a correlation between the shape of body size distributions and eco- system size. the moments of size frequency distribu- tions, i.e., mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, can be used to describe distribution shape. the greater range of trophic levels, and consequently higher mean trophic levels, in large ecosystems should, because of the link between body size and trophic level, be accompanied by a greater body size range. the smallest ecosystems will support few, probably small, species, low population sizes of large species increasing the risk of stochastic extinction (gaston 1994). as ecosystem size increases larger correspondence: david grifﬁths, school of environmental sciences, university of ulster, coleraine bt52 1sa, uk. e-mail: d.grifﬁths@ulster.ac.uk doi: 10.1111/eff.12023 257 david grifﬁths species can persist, so the mean and standard devia- tion of assemblage body size will increase. as some of these larger species will be predatory, they will tend to reduce the abundance and/or occurrence of smaller species (rahel 1984; robinson & tonn 1989; chapleau et al. 1997; magnuson et al. 1998; pace et al. 1999), thereby reducing skewness and kurtosis if the modal sizes are more likely to be eaten. grifﬁths (1986) and marquet et al. (2008) have suggested that this process (termed species stacking and hitch-hiking, respectively) can generate bimodal distributions. hence, species stacking occurs because most predators consume prey that are distinctly smal- than themselves (vezina 1985; cohen et al. ler 1993), so that a basal mode of small abundant prey can support distinctly larger size modes at higher tro- phic levels. marquet et al. (2008) simulated this pro- cess: initially uniform and overlapping predator and prey size distributions diverged over time to generate a bimodal distribution (their ﬁg. 4.5). hence, the inclusion of trophic structure in the ecosystem size model suggests that once predators can be maintained (above an ecosystem size-dependent threshold), there will be a change in body size distribution shape and number of modes. here, i consider the role of ecological (ecosystem scale) processes in determining species assemblage body size distributions of north american freshwater ﬁsh (naff). i document how ﬁsh size distributions vary with ecosystem size in lakes and evaluate the ecosystem size hypothesis as a predictor of those pat- terns. to test the model, ﬁsh body size distributions and trophic structure are examined across a wide range of lake sizes. grifﬁths (2012) concluded that postgla- cial recolonisation by large, habitat generalist, migra- tory species was the main determinant of latitudinal size distribution trends while new, small, species were most likely to evolve in small streams. a ﬁnal section examines the contributions of those regional and con- tinental scale factors and the more local processes examined here in determining ﬁsh size distributions. methods data this article follows the procedures described in grif- ﬁths (2012). size distributions were determined from published species lists from 387 lakes (supporting information table s1). page & burr (1991) was the primary source of information on maximum ﬁsh (total) lengths. species with log length  1.5 (31.6 cm), the the trough between modes (grifﬁths position of 2012), were identiﬁed as large mode species. to test the ecosystem size/trophic structure hypoth- esis, i determined how the moments of species size 258 frequency distributions and diet changed with ecosys- tem size. fish can show considerable intraspeciﬁc size variation across ecosystems, but because of the scarcity of system-speciﬁc body size measures, i used species values. in one test, maximum lengths for ﬁsh caught in multipanel gill nets in lough neagh, north- ern ireland (grifﬁths, unpublished) were correlated with the europe-wide values recorded by maitland (2000)(r = 0.86, n = 11, p < 0.001), suggesting that continental values are adequate. maximum, rather than mean, species length is preferred as, because prey size increases with body size, it is more likely to reﬂect the maximum trophic level attained by the spe- cies. these two size measures are linked: from data in maitland (2000) for european ﬁsh, ‘typical’ spe- cies length is strongly correlated with maximum length (r = 0.96, n = 203, p < 0.001). although size distributions can be examined at a variety of taxo- nomic levels, i used the species level for pragmatic reasons (more data are available). species stacking depends on the abundances of different-sized species. there is an extensive literature on size–abundance relations, with larger aquatic species (strayer 1994; cyr 2000; schmid et al. 2002; jonsson et al. 2005) and individuals (kerr & dickie 2001; de eyto & irvine 2007) being rarer, so species size also contains, admittedly crude, abundance information. as post et al. (2007) make clear, deﬁning ecosystem size is not straightforward. in all but the smallest lakes, water depth has a signiﬁcant structuring inﬂuence (moss 1998). when testing the hypothesis, volume, estimated as the product of lake area and the most widely available depth measure, maximum depth, was used: maximum depth is strongly correlated with mean depth (r = 0.86, n = 184, p < 0.001). isotope analyses the ecosystem size hypothesis argues that longer food chains occur in larger ecosystems. fcl, i.e., the number of times energy is transferred from the bot- tom to the top of the food web, has usually been cal- culated from stable although thompson & townsend (2005) calculated it from food web structure. i used broad dietary categories to identify trophic levels and the range of trophic levels within a system to estimate fcl. from information in scott & crossman (1973), coker et al. (2001) and fishbase (fishbase 2004) adult ﬁsh were scored as plant feeders (1), invertebrate feeders (2) or pisci- vores (3): species consuming more than one of these categories as adults were given median scores. this is a crude measure of diet as, for example, a species consuming all three food categories would receive the same score as one specialising on zooplankton or on benthic invertebrates, and it ignores size-linked shifts in diet: nevertheless, it gives an indication of the species trophic position. as a check on the valid- ity of this procedure, i regressed these diet scores against the trophic levels estimated from the more detailed diet composition in fishbase (fishbase 2004, p181). scores and trophic levels are correlated (r = 0.79, n = 137, p < 0.001), but i used the score data because they included a greater range of species. lake assemblage trophic level scores were calculated as means of species diet scores. for practical and theoretical analyses in line with previous studies, body sizes were log10- transformed, reasons (grifﬁths 2012). the shapes of body size distribu- tions are described by their moments [mean, variance (sd2), skewness (g1) and kurtosis (g2)]: for practical reasons, i used the standard deviation (sd) as a mea- sure of the second moment. positive values of skew- ness indicate right-skewed distributions. positive kurtosis (leptokurtosis) indicates distributions, which are more peaked than a normal distribution while negative values (platykurtosis) occur when frequen- cies around the mean are less than expected for a nor- mal distribution: negative kurtosis might indicate bimodality in the data. it is more difﬁcult to detect signiﬁcant kurtosis than signiﬁcant skewness as the standard error of g2 is twice that of g1 for a given sample size. statistical tests for deviations from unimodality, e.g., hartigans’ dip test tend to be con- servative, sensitive to nonnormality and spatial sepa- ration of the modal groups, and to sample size (jackson et al. 1989; cheng & hall 1998)(supporting information fig. s1). analysis of dip statistic values for large lakes (which are expected and tend to exhi- bit bimodal size distributions) shows that they vary with kurtosis and sample size, but are very conserva- tive (supporting information table s2). conse- quently, i report only values of kurtosis and note that platykurtic distributions are not necessarily bimodal. to test whether trends in body size moments were simply due to changes in species richness, 100 sam- ples for lakes with 2–128 species, a richness range which covers the range of lake sizes in the data, were taken at random from the observed lake continental species pool and the means of moments calculated for each richness class. i also tested whether the moments could be generated by randomly sampling from different body size ranges (log size ranges from 0.2–2.2, in steps of 0.2) of the size distributions for naff species found in lakes. all lengths are in cm, logarithmic transformations are to the base 10, all interval estimates are standard errors, all correlations are parametric (r) and all non- linear trend lines in the ﬁgures are ﬁtted by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess). to test for nonlinearity, the ﬁts of piecewise (toms & lesperance 2003) and linear regression models were body size distributions in freshwater ﬁsh compared using the small sample akaike information criterion (aicc). results there are clear relationships between the moments of the size distributions in lakes (fig. 1, left). broadly similar, although less extreme, relationships are pro- duced by random sampling from different size ranges of lacustrine species (fig. 1, right), i.e., the observed trends are, at least in part, a consequence of the shape of the source species size distributions. kurtosis is strongly correlated with skewness, but note that platy- kurtic assemblages tend to be of average size (fig 1c) and symmetrical in size (fig 1d): inspection of histo- grams conﬁrmed these assemblages to be bimodal (see supporting information fig. s2 for examples). mean body size rises with lake volumes up to about 0.001 km3, but it and the other moments show little change in larger lakes (fig. 2). species richness (fig. 3a) and maximum body size in assemblages increase rapidly with lake volume, whereas minimum size shows a less-marked, but signiﬁcant, decline r = 0.61,  0.31, n = 261, p < 0.001, (fig. 3b; respectively). as with the moments, these trends are not linear, but change in slope at lake volumes of about 0.001–0.01 km3: for all these variables, two- line piecewise models show better ﬁts than one-line models (daicc 7.8–86.0). increases to the model there is considerable variability in the mean ﬁsh size–lake volume relationship, particularly in small lakes. the hypothesis predicts that this relationship is a consequence of changes in trophic level rather than species richness. in both small and large lakes, mean size increases with lake size and mean trophic level (proportion of predatory species), as predicted by the hypothesis (table 1). trophic level has about three times the effect of lake size and addition of mean tro- phic level the variance explained considerably, whereas richness has no effect (daicc small and large lakes 208.3, 105.7, respectively). kurtosis shows a u-shaped relation with mean body size (fig. 1c) with the majority of leptokurtic assemblages dominated either by small or large mode ﬁshes. assemblages in the smallest lakes are dominated by small mode ﬁshes (fig. 2a; log means around 1.1–1.2), but in large lakes, ﬁsh size distributions are platykurtic (fig 2d) and bimodal (fig. 4). across north american lake-dwelling spe- cies, diet score increases with body size (r = 0.49, n = 183, p < 0.001). the mean trophic level of ﬁsh assemblages varies with lake volume (fig. 3c) in a similar way to mean size, with a piecewise model showing a better ﬁt than a linear one (daicc 32.0). this is unsurprising given the strong relationship between mean assemblage trophic level and mean 259 david grifﬁths observed (a) 0.6 predicted 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 (b) s s e n w e k s 3 2 1 0 –1 –2 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 (c) i s s o t r u k 5 3 1 –1 –3 –5 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 mean length 1.8 2.0 (d) i s s o t r u k 5 3 1 –1 –3 –5 –2 –1 1 0 skewness 2 3 –2 –1 0 1 skewness 2 3 fig. 1. observed (left) and modelled (right) relationships between the mean and (a) standard deviation (sd), (b) skewness, (c) kurtosis and (d) between skewness and kurtosis, for body lengths of ﬁsh found in lakes. lowess smoothers (tension 0.5) have been ﬁtted to the data points. 0.6 0.5 0.4 d s 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 s s e n w e k s i s s o t r u k i s s o t r u k 3 2 1 0 –1 –2 5 4 3 2 1 0 –1 –2 –3 –4 –5 5 4 3 2 1 0 –1 –2 –3 –4 –5 260 h t g n e l n a e m s s e n w e k s fig. 2. the moments of ﬁsh size distributions vary with lake size in 387 n. american lakes. lowess smoothers (tension 0.5) have been ﬁtted to the data points.  ) 1 + s e c e p s f i o r e b m u n ( g o l 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 3 2 1 0 –1 –2 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 l e v e i l c h p o r t 3 2 1 fig. 3.

(2010) have shown that introduced species tend to be larger than their native counterparts (medians 33 vs. 12 cm respectively). these values roughly correspond to the modal sizes observed in assemblages (e.g., fig. 4) and raise the possibility that the bimodality is simply a consequence of intro- ductions. however, the great majority of assemblages analysed here consist only of, or are dominated by, native species. the observed and modelled relations between the moments of the ﬁsh size distributions are of similar shapes: a closer ﬁt should not be expected given the very crude model employed and the use of a conti- nental than regional pools. finally, many factors vary with lake size (see below) and potentially confound the analysis: the conclu- sions presented here must be regarded as preliminary until more comprehensive data become available. species pool rather local factors naff body size distributions change with lake size. fishes in small water bodies are small and unimodal while the size range is greater in larger ecosystems, with distributions tending to bimodality. is, the ecosystem size hypothesis, that fcl increases in larger ecosystems, has found support in both lentic and lotic environments (see references in the intro- duction) and in my lake data. the evidence presented here for species stacking, while indirect (nonlinear increases in assemblage mean, sd and mean trophic level, declines in skewness and kurtosis), is consistent with expectation. the marquet et al. (2008) model generates bimodal species distributions while kerr & dickie (2001) present what in essence, a size- based stacking model, where the production of a predator mode depends on the production of its prey and the relative sizes of predator and prey. studies of particular systems have shown that ﬁsh growth rates and body size distributions depend on the availability of different-sized prey. for example, popova (1978) describes a model by menshutkin (1964) of a lake population where perch is the only ﬁsh present. cyclical changes occur between uni- and bimodal age (size) structures. these result from cannibalism by large ﬁsh on small, the increasing numbers of large perch eventually reducing the abundance of small planktivorous perch, with a subsequent reduction in the numbers of predators. persson et al. (2003) describe and model a similar situation, also involving perch. kerr (1979) noted that differences in growth efﬁciencies of lake_trout feeding on large (ﬁsh) and small prey (plankton) could generate a bimodal size distribution while kerr & dickie (2001) outline other examples where species stacking is probable. the degree of isolation and duration of the ecosys- tem, its short-term environmental variability and the threats experienced (both abiotic and biotic), habitat heterogeneity, species richness, assemblage composi- tion and population sizes all vary with lake size (cohen & johnston 1987; wellborn et al. 1996; søndergaard et al. 2005). for example, larger ecosys- tems probably contain more habitats than small ones. small lakes, which are generally shallow, are likely to be dominated by littoral habitat, but with increas- body size distributions in freshwater ﬁsh ing lake size, profundal and pelagic habitats will also occur and in the deepest lakes, some ﬁsh species occupy a midwater zone. consequently, larger eco- systems can potentially support more species (kerr et al. 2001; triantis et al. 2003; fløjgaard et al. 2011) and possibly a greater body size diversity. there is little information on habitat-speciﬁc species size distributions, but i can think of no obvious rea- son why profundal and pelagic zones in large lakes should, on average, support larger species than lit- toral habitats. on the contrary, profundal habitats usually (hindar & jonsson 1982; l’abee-lund et al. 1993), although not always (power et al. 2009), sup- port smaller morphotypes (of salvelinus_alpinus and coregonus_lavaretus) than littoral habitats, i.e., habi- tat heterogeneity per se does not appear likely to gen- erate the observed size trends. small species are probably less prone to extinction in small ecosystems than large species, simply because they potentially have larger population sizes (gaston & blackburn 2000; rosenﬁeld 2002).  3 to 10 in naff species, maximum and mean species sizes increase with lake size (fig. 3b). predation affects size structure in lakes (for example, chapleau et al. 1997). in naff, changes in body size moments and trophic structure (figs 2 and 3) occur at lake vol-  2 km3 (area about 0.1–1 km2, umes of 10 maximum depth 5–10 m, mean depths about one- third of these values): the species richness–lake area relationship also changes slope at about this lake size (fig. 3a; grifﬁths 1997). the smallest, species poor, lakes are dominated by low trophic level species, with right-skewed and unimodal size distributions. larger lakes support more species, including some piscivorous ones: hence mean size, mean trophic level and trophic level range increase with lake size (fig. 3). however, piscivores can exclude or reduce the abundance of smaller, prey, species, generating less right-skewed (or even left-skewed) and more platykurtic distributions (fig. 2c, d). prey species might persist in lakes with piscivores because of defensive spines and/or large adult size or spatial ref- uges, although the latter are less likely to occur in small lakes. in the wisconsin assemblages studied by magnuson et al. (1998), only 29% (n = 31) of spe- cies were small (<1.5 log length) in lakes with pike (esox lucius)/largemouth bass (micropterus salmo- ides) compared with 67% (n = 15) in piscivore-free lakes (z = 2.46, p < 0.05). all trophic levels occur in the largest lakes and, possibly as a consequence of greater habitat heterogeneity, ﬁsh assemblages are more symmetrical and platykurtic in size. spencer et al. (1999) suggested an ecosystem size threshold above which the proportion of predatory species is more or less constant, consistent with the data pre- sented here. 263 david grifﬁths a number of authors (schoener 1989; holt 1993; vander zanden et al. 1999; post et al. 2000; takim- oto et al. 2008; doi et al. 2009) have produced evi- dence for the ecosystem size hypothesis, where food chain length, and hence the importance of large pre- dators, increases with ecosystem size. both vander zanden et al. (1999) and post et al. (2000) demon- strated increases in fcl with lake size, although the relationship levelled off for the two largest lakes in the vander zanden et al. (1999) data, consistent with the ﬁsh trophic level pattern in fig. 3d: these studies cover similar lake size ranges to that analysed here. thompson & townsend (2005) and mchugh et al. (2010) found an ecosystem size effect on food chain length in streams, suggesting that there will also be an effect on body size structure. synthesis this article and grifﬁths (2012) have found evidence for biogeographic, evolutionary and biotic inﬂuences on ﬁsh size distributions. the size, long-term stabil- ity, persistence and connectivity of ecosystems affect species characteristics, particularly vagility (grifﬁths 2010). ecosystem size and persistence, which are generally regarded as correlated (russell-hunter 1978; cohen & johnston 1987; wellborn et al. 1996), have an important inﬂuence on size distribu- tions by determining the range of body sizes, and consequently of trophic interactions, found. specia- tion and extinction rates also vary with ecosystem size. olden et al. threatened freshwater species are generally small (unlike most taxa: gaston & blackburn 2000; purvis et al. 2000) while grifﬁths (2010) concluded that small naff species tend to occupy headwaters and have geo- graphically restricted distributions, making them potentially more vulnerable to extinction, but also, because of reduced gene ﬂow, to greater speciation. latitudinal trends in the moments of the size distribu- tions reﬂect recolonisation abilities of vagile, generally large, species (knouft 2004; grifﬁths 2012). knouft & page (2003) and grifﬁths (2010) concluded that species diversiﬁcation was most likely to occur in small channels and, con- in small species. endemics are smaller sequently, the greater postglacial (2007) showed that than more widespread species (grifﬁths 2012) and their numbers decline rapidly with increasing latitude (grifﬁths 2010), and this could also contribute to lati- tudinal shifts in mean size. the shape of naff body size distributions varies with spatial scale, mean body size increasing, sd decreasing and kurtosis increasing to zero (table 2), mainly because there are fewer small species at the local scale. others have produced evidence for (brown & nicoletto 1991) and against (gaston & blackburn 2000) this conclusion. these scale-depen- dent effects could be due to biotic interactions, result- ing in the loss of smaller species because they are competitively inferior, more vulnerable to predation or have higher extinction rates, and/or to small spe- cies showing greater turnover (beta) diversity because they are more specialised (brown & nicoletto 1991) or have smaller ranges (grifﬁths 2010). although competition in ﬁsh assemblages can affect small-scale species distributions (matthews 1998; jackson et al. 2001), there have been few demonstrations of species exclusions. however, predation can affect the size composition of lake ﬁsh assemblages. locally, eco- system size affects body size distributions via physi- cal small species with large population sizes to reduce extinc- tion risk) and biotic interactions (large ecosystems harbour large, often predatory, species, which can reduce the number of small species) while, region- ally, body size distributions in glaciated areas are determined by changes in the relative importance of small resident versus large vagile species. ecosystems constraints (small favour it is now recognised that many body size distribu- tions have more than one mode. a variety of mecha- nisms have been proposed that could generate multimodal distributions. as discussed above, naff species size distributions are consistent with the eco- system size/trophic structure hypothesis. a number of major ﬁsh taxa have shown reductions in body size as species move from large to small channels over evolutionary time (references in grifﬁths 2010), a trend consistent with an ecosystem size effect. the changes in body size and trophic structure with eco- system size suggest that bimodality in lake assem- blages stacking, whereas bimodality in some rivers and in habitat generalists from species results table 2. effect of sampling scale on the moments and size
