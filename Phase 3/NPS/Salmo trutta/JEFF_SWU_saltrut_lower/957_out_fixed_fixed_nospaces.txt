klemetsen et al. 2003). this variation takes the form of distinct phenotypic variation between populations inhabiting unconnected freshwater systems (adams et al. 2006a). however, systems supporting sympatric polymorphic groups exhibiting distinct ecological, morphological and doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00179.x 20 arctic charr in britain and ireland recently, kottelat (1995, 1997) has challenged the single species views of behnke and savvaitova, arguing for a pragmatic approach to the taxonomic difﬁculties posed by charr: ‘to me it does not make sense to recognise different stocks as biological species and to manage them as species, but not to call the coherent way to handle the problem is that an entity recognised as species using one or the other species concept be called species and be handled as such, in systematics, ecology and resources management.’ expression of such views have led to calls for a re-evaluation of the taxonomic status of the arctic charr. them species; although for practical purposes, most modern ich- thyologists accept a single species in europe (s. alpinus) (fig. 1), historically, 15 additional species of charr have been described from waters in britain and ireland; ﬁve by gunther (1862, 1863, 1865), one by maitland (1881) and nine by regan (1908, 1909a,b) (table 1). kottelat (1997) provisionally accepted these 15 plus one further, salvelinus_youngeri (previously described as a subspe- cies; friend 1956) but in a cautionary note points out these putative species needs that the status of re-examining and if independent lineages can be established, then they should be accepted as valid species. to add further to the confusion, wheeler et al. (2004) added 15 of kottelat’s (1997) tentative species (but not s. youngeri) to the widely used list of the common and scientiﬁc names of ﬁshes of the british isles (wheeler 1992) before the taxonomic review called for by kottelat (1997) has taken place. here, although we do not undertake the taxonomic review of the charr of britain and ireland which is clearly required, we do examine the criteria used to deﬁne the putative species from this region and the historical circumstances under which they were deﬁned, with the aim of examining their taxonomic validity. fig. 1. a ‘typical’ charr? a drawing of a plankton feeding charr from loch doon, scotland. life-history traits which, in at least some places, exist as noninterbreeding units, are also common across its range (gı´slason et al. 1999; klemetsen et al. 2003; adams et al. 2006b). this pattern of variation has led to genuinely held and contradictory views on the status of the arctic charr, s. alpinus as a single species. behnke (1972, 1989) argues that european charr are monophyletic having derived from a relatively recent common ancestor and are a single subspecies salvelinus_alpinus alpinus whose differentiation has occurred during the past 60,000–70,000 years. the only exception to this being the ‘teifseeaibling’ of bodensee, which behnke (1972) regards as a full species, salvelinus_profundus. similarly, savvaitova (1995) argues that charr morphotypes should be regarded as ‘nontaxonomic adaptive types’ manifesting phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variability. without this approach, argues savvaitova (1995), it would be possible to deﬁne a new species for every waterbody containing charr. in contrast, some taxonomists consider that there is a logical taxonomic basis for subdividing the arctic charr. in russia for example, viktorovskii (1978) and glubokovskii & chereshnev (1981) have argued that there are up to 23 separate species (savvaitova 1995). table 1. comparative morphological data on the 15 species of charr originally described from britain and ireland. species colii ﬁmbriatus gracillimus grayi inframundus killinensis lonsdalii mallochi maxillaris obtusus perisii scharfﬁ struanensis trevelyani willoughbii 1 ? ? 17 25 <20 <20 <20 <20 <20 ? <20 ? <20 ? <20 2 ter ter ter ter inf inf ter? inf ter? inf ter? ter inf ter ter? 3 66–88 75 100 85–117 67–88 75–100 83 75–88 66–83 71–88 75–80 75 75–88 80 67–88 4 9–10 10 8–9 8–10 10 9–11 9 8–9 9–11 9–11 9–10 9 9 9 8–10 5 7–9 7–9 7–8 7–9 8–9 8–9 8 8 8–10 8–11 8–9 7–9 8–9 7–9 7–9 6 fee/mod mod mod fee/mod mod mod mod fee/mod mod fee/mod str mod fee str mod 7 8–12 10 9 9–12 9–11 9–12 9–11 10 10–11 9–12 10–11 10 10–11 9–10 9–12 8 12–16 18–19 13–14 12–15 13–14 14–16 13 13–14 14–15 12–15 13–16 13–14 13–14 12–16 11–16 9 138–168 160 164–186 128–162 188–200 182–215 166–182 158–180 168–186 142–166 156–188 186 178–195 138–168 160–194 10 62–63 ? 62 58–60 63–64 62 ? 62 64 62 61 ? 59 ? 59–60 1, greatest depth of body as a % of length; 2, position of mouth (ter, terminal; sup, superior; inf, inferior); 3, pectoral ﬁn as a % of head length; 4, dorsal ﬁn rays; 5, anal ﬁn rays; 6, dentition (str, strong; mod, moderate; fee, feeble); 7, branchiostegals; 8, gill rakers; 9, lateral scales; 10, vertebrae. 21 adams & maitland table 2. numbers of specimens used in early descriptions of salvelinus species.

(2004) based on species descriptions from the early 20th century is also unsustainable. the argument for full speciﬁc status for the 15 putative species examined here is, at best, poor. there are several reasons for this: 1 seven of the species are described from just one or two specimens whereas there is known to be signiﬁcant variation within charr populations. 2 many of the characters used to describe the putative species are subjective. 3 ichthyologists a century ago had little awareness of sympatric populations of arctic charr. for example, 26 loch rannoch, from which maitland (1881) described s. struanensis, is now believed to hold three separate populations (adams et al. 1998). 4 a number of the charr populations which were known at the time were only somewhat casually ascribed to a particular species. for example regan (1911) notes arctic charr from seven scottish lochs which ‘have their peculiarities’ but which he was ‘not inclined to separate speciﬁcally from s. at present willoughbii.’ 5 in addition, many new charr lochs have been discovered since the original 15 charr species have been discovered and so it could be assumed that quite a number of new ‘species’ have not yet been described. less than 100 charr populations were known in great britain and ireland around 1900, whereas by 2000, well over twice that number had been recorded (maitland 1995). there have been at the arctic charr situation in this region is not unique. historically, least 15 species of salvelinus described from north america; up to 29 species or subspecies described in europe; and 12 from siberia and the far east (see discussion in behnke 1972 and savvaitova 1995). both historical and more contemporary evidence (see, e.g., alexander & adams 2000; adams et al. 2006b) does provide the consensus that arctic charr in britain and ireland are highly variable to an extent that differs very signiﬁcantly from other species and that it is highly likely that under any modern objective criteria for the deﬁnition of species, several distinct species would be deﬁned in this region. however, until this taxonomic review takes place there is little evidence to support full speciﬁc status for the charr reviewed here. in reality, there is more objective evidence for full speciﬁc status for the sympatric populations which have only been discovered relatively recently (adams et al. 1998; fraser et al. 1999; kettle-white 2001; adams et al. 2006a). as kottelat (1997) points out ‘… the data… do not allow a determination of the exact number of involved species …’ thus we conclude that a taxonomic and populations status review of british and irish charr is now urgently required. the urgency for this review is compounded by the fact that we are gradually losing populations (maitland 1995; maitland et al. 2006) and the loss of three of the populations of the above type ‘species’ together with many other charr stocks is a matter of considerable concern. what is required is a concerted programme to (i) check the status of all stocks, especially those which have not been examined for many decades; (ii) survey for populations which have not yet been recorded; and (iii) use the material so gathered to deﬁne the nature of each stock in both phenotypic and genotypic terms. in our view, such a review is highly likely to lead to the identiﬁcation of populations that meet the criteria for full species status. until this is completed, we agree with the sentiments of seeley (1886) ‘… that the constituent varieties of those species should be kept distinct, and treated as though they were species in process of development, still showing their connection with the parent stock.’ acknowledgements figs. 1 and 4–16 were derived from originals published by regan (1911); the picture in fig. 7 was originally published by gunther 1865. fig. 1 was drawn by robin ade. fig. 3 was kindly provided by f. igoe. this work was supported by ec grant qlri-ct-2001-00007. references adams, c.e., fraser, d., huntingford, f.a., greer, r.b., askew, c.m. & walker, a.f. 1998. trophic polymorphism in the arctic charr from loch rannoch, scotland. journal of fish biology 52: 1259–1272. adams, c.e., hamilton, d.j., mccarthy, i., wilson, a.j., grant, a., alexander, g., waldron, s., snorrason, s.s., ferguson, m.m. & sku´ lason, s. 2006a. does breeding site ﬁdelity drive phenotypic and genetic sub-structuring of a population of arctic charr?
