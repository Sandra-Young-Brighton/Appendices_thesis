(biomod; thuiller a wide variety of statistical methods have been used to build sdms: glm (pont et al. 2005), quartile regression (vaz et al. 2008), gam (buisson et al. 2008a), mars (leathwick et al. 2008), regression tree (elith et al. 2008), neural networks (brosse et al. 2001) and approaches that combine several of these methods et al. 2009). the selection of a statistical method to use generates passionate debate around sdms and has led to several studies comparing the predictive power of different models on either theoretical systems (elith & graham 2009) or ﬁeld data (grenouillet et al. 2011). the results of these comparisons are highly dependent not only on the relationship between species occurrence and environmental conditions (linear or nonlinear) but also on the dataset used (elith & graham 2009). in his review of different methods that can be used for sdms, austin (2007) emphasised the importance of selecting a statistical method that matches the goal of the study. logistic regression (hosmer & lemeshow 2000; collett 2002) including quadratic terms for the environmental variables the most appropriate method to estimate the species’ niche (hutchinson 1957; austin 2007). moreover, this method’s goodness-of-ﬁt measures are often similar to other statistical methods, in estimating the relationship between environmental conditions and the pres- ence ⁄ absence of species (elith & graham 2009; grenouillet et al. 2011). is previous authors used logistic regression to estimate the habitat requirements of several ﬁsh species at the scale of france (oberdorff et al. 2001; pont et al. 2005). for some species, the environmental conditions covered by these studies only represent a segment on the environmental conditions in which these species could occur (kottelat & freyhof 2007). indeed, the spatial extent of the dataset used to estimate the species’ requirements is one of the major criticisms of sdms (sinclair et al. 2010). if the data used to calibrate the models come from only a restricted part of the species’ distribution area, the estimated niches would only represent a small part of the species’ realised niche. the use of such models to predict the future distribution of species would lead to extrapolating species’ occurrence on environmental conditions not in the model calibration. the recent study of barbet-massin et al. (2010) clearly demonstrated the importance of using data that cover the species’ distribution area. the extent of the climatic niche and species richness was underestimated, while the rates of species extinction were overestimated when using a spatially restricted dataset. the whole range of taken into account moreover, using a spatially restricted dataset could lead to high levels of uncertainty when predicting species occurrence in environmental conditions that are rarely encountered. several studies focused on the uncertainty related to the types of model used (elith & leathwick 2009; buisson et al. 2010), but the levels of uncertainty associated with the species–environment relationships are rarely addressed. the recent study conducted by grenouillet et al. (2011) showed that the uncertainty associated with ﬁtted species occurrence varied with the environmental conditions. therefore, it could be valuable to estimate the uncertainty associ- ated with the model’s expected values to deﬁne the environmental conditions in which species occurrence is or is not accurately predicted. compared with other statistical methods, logistic regression can compute theoretical conﬁdence intervals around expected val- ues (hosmer & lemeshow 2000; collett 2002). (ii) is very similar this study were (i) the main objectives of to estimate the habitat requirements of 21 riverine european freshwater species using logistic regression and slightly impacted sites located in the current species distribution area, to estimate species’ optimum along an environmental gradient, (iii) to estimate species’ thermal range, (iv) to compute the uncertainty associated with the models and (v) to assess the reliability of the sdms along the different environmental gradients. the habitat requirement of a species (pont et al. 2005) to the organism’s tolerances to environmental conditions of the niche concept (hutchinson 1957; begon et al. 2006). nevertheless, as we do not consider the requirements for other resources such as food, we use the term ‘habitat requirement’ rather than niche. the european fame and efi+ projects provided the opportunity to assess the species’ habitat require- ment at a continental scale. to our knowledge, for freshwater ﬁsh, this type of analysis has never been conducted over such a large spatial extent. working at the european scale enabled us to take into account a wide variety of the environmental conditions (tockner et al. 2009) that ﬁsh species encounter within their current distribution areas (banarescu 1989; kottelat & freyhof 2007). europe has the advantage of encom- passing a great variety of streams and climatic conditions (tockner et al. 2009). moreover, because of the precise description of the human pressures used in the efi+ project, we were able to select sites that were not or only slightly impacted, considering various types of pressures, and to observe the absences of species that were not inﬂuenced by human activ- ities. compared with data for other organisms such as terrestrial plants (e.g., hanspach et al. 2010), the ﬁsh data were collected over a smaller spatial extent and thus species occurrence could be more inﬂuenced by local pressures. 267 logez et al. material and methods all the data used were gathered during the european efi+ project (contract number 044096, http://eﬁ-plus. boku.ac.at/). data were gathered from national ﬁsh surveys conducted by several laboratories and govern- mental environmental agencies (1981–2007, 96% after 1990). the sites were sampled using electroﬁshing methods either by wading or by boat, depending on stream depth. all ﬁsh caught were identiﬁed to the species level. to homogenise the sampling effort between regions, only ﬁsh collected during the ﬁrst pass were considered. site selection the estimated accurately deﬁning the sites used is of major impor- tance because all outcomes depend on the precision of the pres- ence ⁄ absence of species and the environmental fac- tors. it the habitat requirement of the species and to avoid ‘false’ absence owing to nonenvironmental factors. is necessary to select sites that reﬂect relationships between as human activities can modify assemblage species composition, only sites not or only slightly impacted were selected (pont et al. 2005, 2006, 2007). sites were selected based on the objective criteria (stoddard et al. 2006) following logez & pont (2011) deﬁnition of slightly impacted sites. sites were also selected to limit spatial autocorre- lation because spatial factors could inﬂuence assem- blage composition (grenouillet et al. 2004) and observations are not compatible with glm require- ments (mccullagh & nelder 1989). to limit spatial autocorrelations, which affect stream ﬁsh assemblage composition and reduce the independence between sites, a grid of 0.2 decimal degrees of longitude and latitude was deﬁned and one site per cell was randomly selected. a total of 1548 sites spread over 14 countries were selected, covering more than 4 · 106 km2 (fig. 1). within this dataset, for each species, only the sites that were located in their distribution areas were retained so as to limit the effect of biogeographic factors on the absence of species. for each species, the calibration dataset was only composed of sites located in the main marine region where the species is considered as native (kottelat & freyhof 2007; reyjol et al. 2007). selected species

km2) to estimate the habitat requirements of the 21 ﬁsh species, four environmental factors that can inﬂuence the spatial distribution of ﬁsh species were considered. is a descriptor of the position of the stream reach along the hydrographic network (oberdorff et al. 2001; pont et al. 2005) and also reﬂects habitat diversity because stream complexity increases along the longitudinal gradient (matthews 1998). the uda inﬂuences the spatial distribution of freshwater ﬁsh species (mcgar- vey & hughes 2008; mcgarvey & ward 2008) in europe (pont et al. 2005). stream power (stp, wattæm)1) is ‘the rate of potential energy expenditure over a reach or stp per unit of stream length’ (gordon et al. 2004). stp reﬂects the power of a stream to move bed substrate and varies with both stream slope and discharge. the importance of hydraulics for ﬁsh was previously demonstrated (obe- rdorff et al. 2001; pont et al. 2005; buisson et al. 2008a), but these authors used an estimation of stream velocity based on stream width and depth. stp provides a more reliable and reproducible estimation because depth and width are inﬂuenced by human alterations. stream power was computed as stp = qgqs, with q the density of water (taken to 1000 kgæm)3), g the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 mæs)2), q the mean annual discharge (m3æs)1) and s the slope (mækm)1). run-off was used instead of the observed water ﬂow to avoid hydrological alteration induced by human activ- ities. q was computed as the multiplication of the uda and the mean annual run-off (mar, mm per year): q ¼ maruda . mar was estimated by ﬁrst com- ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ puting the annual potential evapotranspiration (pet, mm) using turc’s formula (1954): pet ¼ , lð þ2 0:9þ p with p the mean annual precipitation (in mm) and l the temperature factor derived from the mean annual temperature (t, °c) (turc 1954): l = 300 + 25t + 0.05t 3. then, mar was computed as mar = p ) pet. q 31536 p temperature is a key climatic factor (somero 1997; begon et al. 2006) inﬂuencing ﬁsh species distribution (matthews 1998; wehrly et al. 2003; pont et al. 2005; buisson et al. 2008a). the mean air temperature in july (tjul, °c) was used as an alias for water temperature (allan & castillo 2007). the thermal amplitude between july and january (tdif) was also included in the model. these the multicollinearity factors were chosen to limit between explanatory variables in the model. in addition to their ecological relevance, modelling approach logistic regression relates the probability of the presence of a species (p) to the environmental factors (x) through the logit function (hosmer & lemeshow 2000; collett 2002): p   log p 1 p ¼ a þ bixi , p ¼ i¼1;p p 1 bixiþ, 1þe ðaþ with a the intercept and bi associated with the

2007). the complete logit(p)  uda + uda2 + stp + stp2 + tjul + tjul2 + tdif. for each species, the most relevant variables were selected through a stepwise procedure based on aic (agresti 2002). models’ goodness of ﬁt the models’ goodness of ﬁt was estimated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, auc (hosmer & lemeshow 2000), kappa (agresti 2002), sensitivity (% presence correctly predicted), speciﬁcity (% absence correctly predicted) and the overall correct classiﬁcation rate (fiedling & bell 1997). a threshold probability, computed to maximise the sum of sensitivity and speciﬁcity (fiedling & bell 1997), was used to convert proba- bilities into presence ⁄ absence (buisson et al. 2008b). an internal validation based on the bootstrap method (efron & tibshirani 1993; davidson & hinkley 1997) was performed to check for the models’ robustness and stability towards outliers. for each species, 200 new training datasets were deﬁned by randomly selected sites with replacement (a site could be selected several times). these new datasets were used to re-estimate the models’ coefﬁcients. then, kappa and the correct classiﬁcation rate were estimated on both the training datasets and the initial dataset, leading to two vectors of 200 values: one for the training datasets and one for the initial dataset (test). the difference between the mean of these two vectors is an estimation of optimism (harrell 2001). to assess the predictive performance of the models, cross-validation was performed. we used a method derived from split-sampling (harrell 2001), by split- ting the calibration dataset into two subsets, training and test, containing 70% and 30% of the calibration sites, respectively. the models’ coefﬁcients were re-estimated using the training dataset, and the goodness-of-ﬁt statistics were computed on the test 269 logez et al. datasets. this operation was repeated 200 times leading to a vector of 200 values for each statistic. in summary, internal validation checks the stability of the models, whereas cross-validation assesses the predictive power. effect of the environmental variables the independent (i) and joined (j) contributions of the environmental variable on species occurrence were assessed using hierarchical partitioning (chevan & sutherland 1991; mac nally 2000). hierarchical partitioning is ‘based on the theorem of hierarchies in which all possible models in a multiple regression setting are jointly considered to attempt to identify the most likely causal factors’ (pont et al. 2005). we performed hierarchical partitioning using the reduction of deviance (pont et al. 2005). the models’ complexity will limit the perception of the relationship between a given environmental vari- able and the probability of the presence of a species. therefore, we used graphic effect display (fox 1987, 2003) to represent the speciﬁc marginal effect of an environmental factor on species occurrence. these graphs are drawn by computing the probability of the presence of a species along an environmental gradient. the values of the other environmental factors were ﬁxed at their medians observed on the calibration sites where the species occurred. uncertainty around environment–occurrence relationships the conﬁdence interval (ci) was used to assess the uncertainty in the relationships between environmental factors and species’ probability of presence (drawn on the graph effect display). cis ‘quantify our knowledge, about a parameter of a population, based upon a random sample’ (hahn & meeker 1991, p. 29). the ci is used as an indicator of model precision (de jong & heller 2008) and estimates the uncertainty of the expected probability of the presence of a species in a given

þ 2b2  tjul ¼ 0, such where b1 was the coefﬁcient associated with tjul and b2 the coefﬁcient associated with tjul2. the optimum was equal to  b1 if b2 was positive. the 2b2 estimations of the species’ optima were independent of the other environmental variables. that species thermal range thermal range was deﬁned as the minimal and maximal temperatures for which species are estimated to occur in a given location. these temperatures were computed such that logit pð þ ¼ logitðcþ, where c is the previously computed threshold probability (probability deﬁning the presence ⁄ absence of a species). thermal ranges depend on the values of the other environmen- tal variables selected in the models. thermal ranges were computed for 12 combinations of low to high stp and small to large uda, while tdif was set at the median of the calibration sites where the species was recorded. all statistical analyses were performed using r 2.11.2 (r development core team 2008). results the calibration dataset (1548 sites) encompassed a large variety of environmental conditions: tjul varied between 11.3 and 25.1 °c (mean, 18.1, sd, 2.16), tdif from 8.4 to 28.8 °c (mean, 16.9, sd, 4.3), uda from 0 to 11.5 (in log, mean, 4.5, sd, 1.8) and stp from 3.9 to 17.4 (in log, mean, 11.2, sd, 1.54). two-thirds of the 21 species were recorded in fewer than 25% of the sites (table 1). gudgeon (gobio gobio, l.), bullhead (cottus gobio, l.), stone loach (barbatula barbatula, l.) and minnow (phoxinus phoxinus, l.) were caught in more than 30% of the sites located in their distribution area. brown_trout

>0.8, 17 models had a kappa statistic >0.3, and the mean correct classiﬁca- tion rate was equal to 0.754. only three models had a low goodness of ﬁt: minnow, stone loach and bullhead with an auc lower than 0.8, a correct classiﬁcation rate lower than 69% and in particular low speciﬁcity values (<61%). conversely, bleak (alburnus alburnus, b.), barbel (barbus barbus, l.), nase (chondrostoma nasus, l.), common dace (leuciscus leuciscus, l.), ninespine stickleback (pungitius pungitius, l.), roach (rutilus rutilus, l.) and souﬁe (telestes soufﬁa, r.) had models with relatively high goodness of ﬁt: the auc was always >0.85, with a correct classiﬁcation rate varying from 0.769 to 0.855 and high speciﬁcity and sensitivity values (some >0.9), which indicate a good discriminant power (table 1). on average, presence was better predicted than absence. the sensitivity values (mean, 0.796) were greater than the speciﬁcity values for 13 species of 21 (mean, 0.739), e.g., barbel, nase, perch (perca ﬂuvia- tilis, l.) and bitterling (rhodeus amarus, b.). on the other hand, the speciﬁcity values for dace and souﬁe were higher. stone loach, bullhead, perch, minnow and bitterling displayed the highest discrepancy between their speciﬁcity and sensitivity (table 1). the average kappa statistics and correct classiﬁcation rates computed using the bootstrap method were consistent with the values observed on the initial calibration datasets (appendix s1). the estimated optimisms never exceeded 6.1%, indicating that model estimations were stable and robust to outliers. the cross-validations displayed high consistency between the statistics computed on the validation datasets (30% of the randomly selected calibration sites) and the values computed on the initial calibra- tion datasets (appendix s2). this indicated that the error rates associated with new predictions and an independent dataset should be comparable to the error rates observed for the calibration datasets. bitterling and souﬁe showed the highest differences between initial and validation dataset speciﬁcities (appen- dix s2). among the ﬁve statistics tested, the area under the roc curve showed the highest variability. inﬂuence of environmental factors stream power was the only variable selected for all species, and tjul and uda were selected for 20 species and tdif for 16 species. the hierarchical partitioning revealed that the inﬂuence of each envi- ronmental factor was highly variable between species. the uda had the highest independent contribution (i) for 15 species (on average 44.4%), followed by tjul and tdif together for six species and stp for only two species (table 2). 271 logez et al. table 2. hierarchical partitioning of the reduction (r) of deviance owing to the

(from 7.3% to 74.7%) and accounted for more than half of the independent contribution for spirlin (alburnoides bipunctatus, b.), bleak, northern pike (esox lucius, l.), common dace, burbot (lota lota, l.), perch and roach (table 2). the independent contribution of temperature (tjul or tdif) was always >17.5% and on average equal to 42.6%. tjul and tdif accounted for more than 50% of the independent contribution for european eel (anguilla anguilla, l.), bullhead, souﬁe and bitterling. eel was the only species for which tdif was the main environmental factor (table 2). compared with tjul and uda, the independent contribution of stp was relatively low (mean, 15.2%; range, 1.4–54.4%). stp was the main environmental factor for only european brook lamprey (lampetra planeri, b.) and ninespine stickleback (table 2). species’ optimum, tolerance and habitat requirement the great majority of species had a bell-shaped response curve along the tjul gradient (fig. 2), but some species had different response patterns. the estimated probability of bleak and bitterling constantly increased along the tjul gradient (fig. 2). brown_trout had the most singular pattern with a sharply decreased presence over 19 °c (fig. 2). responses to uda were more diverse. spirlin, stone loach, barbel, nase, bullhead, european brook 272 lamprey, souﬁe, minnow, bitterling and grayling (thymallus_thymallus, l.) displayed bell-shaped response curves (fig. 3) but with different optima and ranges (table 3). the probability values of bleak, pike, chub (leuciscus cephalus, l.), dace and roach increased along the uda gradient. brown_trout was the only species to prefer small to intermediate uda (fig. 3). eel, pike, european brook lamprey, ninespine stickleback, bitterling and roach were estimated to prefer low-energy streams (low stp values). in contrast, the probability of the presence of nase, souﬁe, brown_trout and grayling increased with increasing energy. the other species presented bell- shaped responses to stp gradient with different optima and ranges: stone loach and gudgeon preferred low-energy streams, whereas barbel occurred mainly in high-energy streams (fig. 4 and table 3). the probability of the presence of a species either increased or decreased along the tdif gradient. eel preferred low thermal amplitude. stone loach, gud- geon and brown_trout only slightly responded to tdif variations (fig. 5). species’ habitat requirement brown_trout was clearly a cold-water species and had one of the largest thermal ranges but with a thermal tolerance depending on the other environmental con- ditions (table 3). modelling the habitat requirements of ﬁsh species at the european scale a. bipunctatus a. alburnus a. anguilla b. barbatula b. barbus c. nasus c. gobio e. lucius

in black, and the conﬁdence interval bands are in grey. grayling (t. thymallus) was a cold–cool-water species (optimum about 16 °c) with a relatively narrow thermal range, occurring in large high-energy streams. burbot (l. lota) and european brook lamprey (l. planeri) preferred low-energy streams. their preference differed for uda and tdif (burbot in larger udas and more variable tdif) and tjul (lower optimum for lamprey). bullhead (c. gobio), minnow, (p. phoxinus) and stone loach (b. barbatula) occurred mainly in cold- to cool-water streams (optimum, about 16.4, 17.6 and 18.3 °c), with wide uda ranges, but a different stp optimum (lower for stone loach). ninespine stickleback (p. pungitius) had among the narrowest thermal range. this species preferred cool- (optimum about 18.2 °c) and low-energy water streams. perch (p. ﬂuviatilis) and pike (e. lucius) were located mainly in large low-energy streams and cool to warm water, but with a narrower thermal range for perch. dace (l. leuciscus) occurred mainly in cool- to warm-water and in medium to large streams. spirlin (a. bipunctatus) and roach (r. rutilus), both located in large rivers, preferred cool to warm temperatures (optimum, about 19.4 °c). roach could have substantial thermal tolerance depending on the other environmental conditions, and spirlin seemed to prefer high-energy streams. gudgeon (g. gobio) occurred in cool- to warm- water streams with a large uda but with a rather low level of energy. nase (c. nasus), chub (l. cephalus) and barbel (b. barbus) preferred large warm streams, but with different thermal range: narrower for nase and wider for barbel. chub was more ubiquitous. the occurrence of eel (a. anguilla) was mainly associated with a narrow thermal amplitude. souﬁe (t. soufﬁa) occurred mainly in warm-water mid-sized streams with high tdif. bitterling (r. amarus) and bleak (a. alburnus) clearly preferred warm-water streams, but with a greater thermal range and larger low-energy rivers for bleak. 273 logez et al. a. bipunctatus a. alburnus a. anguilla b. barbatula b. barbus c. nasus e c n e r u c c o f o y t i l i b a b o r p 1 8 . 0 6 . 0 4 . 0 2 . 0 0 1 8 . 0 6 . 0 4 . 0 2

probabilities of the presence of 21 european freshwater ﬁsh species. the model’s expected values are in black, and the conﬁdence interval bands are in grey. thermal ranges variability with other environmental conditions for bleak, eel, pike, gudgeon, chub, perch and brown_trout, their ranges varied greatly depending on stp and uda (table 3). conversely, spirlin, nase, gud- geon, minnow, ninespine stickleback, souﬁe and grayling had relatively stable thermal ranges along these two gradients (table 3). uncertainty the uncertainty values associated with model estima- tions (conﬁdence bands in figs 2–5) were generally low for tjul, except for some species on the edge of this gradient, leading to higher level of uncertainty for this environment. spirlin, barbel, pike, bitterling and roach conﬁdence bands widened once their thermal optima were reached, implying better precision of the model close to lower thermal limits. grayling showed the opposite pattern (fig. 2). 274 uncertainty values associated with uda and stp were higher (figs 3 and 4). the uncertainty was higher with low stp for bleak, stone loach, lamprey and perch and higher with high stp for barbel. spirlin, bullhead, souﬁe and to a lesser extent bitterling had high uncertainty all along the stp gradient. for uda, the high uncertainty values were mainly associated with large values (e.g., stone loach, barbel, bullhead, lamprey, roach and bitterling). souﬁe was the only species for which the uncertainty was relatively high all along the uda gradient. in general, high uncertainty values for a given environmental gradient were observed when the independent effect of this variable on species occur- rence was limited (table 2). discussion these results highlighted the effects of climatic factors, drainage basin and stp on 21 riverine modelling the habitat requirements of ﬁsh species at the european scale 5 . 4 2 – 3 3 1 . . 9 4 2 – 9 . 2 1 . 7 5 2 – 1 . 2 1 2 . 2 2 – 6 5 1 . . 9 2 2

which tended to be overestimated by the models. this is consistent with a previous study conducted at the country scale in france (pont et al. 2005). other environmental and biotic factors may control the distribution of these species within river networks. on the contrary, two 276 rheophilic cyprinids, barbel and nase, had models with high goodness of ﬁt and both presence and absence were accurately predicted. generally, the goodness-of-ﬁt statistics are lower than for sdms ﬁtted at the lower spatial extent (e.g., buisson et al. 2008a; buisson & grenouillet 2009). for instance, auc varied between 0.67 and 0.93, while several authors computed aucs > 0.9 (buisson et al. 2008b; sundblad et al. 2009). this pattern should not be related to the logistic regression because the predic- tive power of the glm is often similar to other statistical methods (elith & graham 2009; grenouil- let et al. 2011). one hypothesis to explain this result could be the ubiquity of certain species. for instance, minnow can inhabit not only small in western europe but also large streams in central europe (logez m., bady p. & pont d., unpublished data). indeed, it could be more difﬁcult to predict the occurrence of generalist species, because of their large ranges (evangelista et al. 2008; buisson et al. 2010; grenouillet et al. 2011). streams modelling the habitat requirements of ﬁsh species

probabilities of the presence of 21 european freshwater ﬁsh species. the model’s expected values are in black, and the conﬁdence interval bands are in grey. moreover, auc is commonly used to assess the predictive power of sdms. this statistic is simple to compute, and it does not depend on a threshold probability, unlike the statistics derived from the confusion matrix (matching matrix between observed and predicted presence ⁄ absences; hosmer & leme- show 2000; agresti 2002; collett 2002). nevertheless, we are convinced that this statistic alone is not sufﬁcient to judge the sdm’s discriminating power: the auc tends to be optimistic, to provide an excessively favourable perception of the model’s performance, and is not sufﬁcient to estimate the error made on a species’ posterior classiﬁcation. the threshold probability has to be estimated to derive the probabilities of the presence ⁄ absence of a species (buisson et al. 2008b) and to estimate the future species distribution or turnover (buisson et al. 2008b; barbet-massin et al. 2010). therefore, speciﬁcity and sensitivity must be provided because high discrepan- cies may be observed between these two statistics (pont et al. 2005). habitat requirement the 21 species display very different responses to temperature, uda and stp. as already shown (pont et al. 2005; buisson et al. 2008a), both the shape of the response and the relative effect of each environ- mental variable varied between species, but the responses observed here were different from those previously observed. see appendix s3 salmo_trutta is a widespread species in europe ([1–2]; references corresponding to the numbers), occurring in various types of streams [3–7]. not surprisingly, this species has the most singular habitat requirements and the largest tolerances in terms of uda and stp. brown_trout occurrence in stream is probably more related to spawning substrate and oxygen concentration than to hydraulic conditions (brown_trout occur in lakes; [8]). salmonids have a high physiological demand for oxygen [9–10] and cold fast-ﬂowing waters have a high oxygen concentration [11], which could explain for the 277 logez et al. brown_trout’s afﬁnity for these environmental condi- tions [12]. thymallus_thymallus and t. soufﬁa display similar habitat requirements, occurring mostly in medium and large streams with high energy. these species are rheophilic and live in fast-ﬂowing streams [13–14] and are stenothermal species. nevertheless, grayling oc- curs in cold-water streams [15], while souﬁe occurs in warm-water streams. lota lota is a cold stenothermal eurytopic species [16–17] that occurs mainly in large streams [18–19] and which is considered as rheophilic [20]. some of our ﬁndings are in contradiction with its known ecology. tjul was not retained for this species, whereas a bell-shaped response with a low-tempera- ture optimum would be expected, and burbot is estimated to prefer low-energy streams. lampetra planeri inhabits cool-water streams with [20–24] whose its larvae needing ﬁne sediment deposition occurs at low velocities [25]. this is consistent with lamprey’ afﬁnity for low stp and small uda. cottus gobio, b. barbatula and p. phoxinus are three rhithronal species [26], often associated with brown_trout in cool-water streams [5, 27]. temper- ature is the main driver of bullhead occurrence in streams [28]. while these species can also live in lakes [29–31], minnow and stone loach are also inﬂuenced by uda and stp. they both mainly occur in medium-sized streams with cool tempera- tures [32], but minnow seemed to prefer higher- energy streams. pungitius pungitius was estimated to prefer small and low-energy streams, characterised by low slope and ⁄ or low discharge [33–34]. this is consistent with the inverse relationship between stp and its proba- bility of occurrence. its narrow thermal range demon- strates how stenothermal this species is. esox lucius and p. ﬂuviatilis prefer cool-water streams with a large uda and low energy. this type of river is, in general, characterised by ﬂoodplain development, which provides them suitable spawning habitat and nurseries for their juveniles [35–36]. the habitat requirements estimated for l. leuciscus partially match its known ecology. dace is a rheophilic species [37–38] that occurs in middle and lower reaches [39] and needs a gravel substrate to spawn [40] but its probability of occurrence is highest in large streams with low energy, although postspaw- ning dace adults seem to prefer low ﬂow and shallow areas [41]. in agreement with their known ecology, a. bipunct- atus and a. alburnus occurrences are mainly driven by uda and tjul. spirlin is a rheophilic species that occurs mainly in small and medium streams [42-43]. spirlin occurs in cooler streams than bleak. bleak is a 278 limnophilic and planktivorous [23], and plankton is commonly abundant in the most down- stream, larger, warmer, part of rivers [11, 44–45]. this is in agreement with bleak’s probability of presence increasing as uda and tjul increase. species gobio gobio and r. rutilus requirements are close. they occur in high uda and within the same thermal ranges. consistent with their ecology, gudgeon is rheophilic and prefers low to intermediate stp, whereas roach is more limnophilic and prefers a low-energy stream [23, 46–49]. chondrostoma nasus, b. barbus and l. cephalus are rheophilic species that have lithophilic reproduc- tion [17, 20, 50]. they exhibit different optima along the uda and stp gradients. nase occurs in medium to large streams with high energy, barbel in interme- diate- to low-energy streams and chub in large streams with average energy [26]. the estimated requirements of a. anguilla did not reﬂect its known ecology. eel is mainly inﬂuenced by tdif. this is probably due to the dataset used to calibrate the model and of its migratory behaviour [51]. because eel is catadromous, its distribution is directly linked to the sea and thermal amplitude increases along the oceanic–continental climate gradi- ent (ward 1985). tdif probably acts as a proxy for the distance from the sea. rhodeus amarus is a limnophilic and thermophilc species feeding mainly on algae [52–53], with an ostracophilic reproduction [52, 54]. accordingly, bitterling was estimated to occur mainly in medium to large warm streams with low energy. thermal species optima according to their thermal optima, the 21 species are distributed along the entire tjul gradient (15.4– 21.9 °c). these optima are not comparable with those in the literature because the latter were estimated in laboratory conditions (jobling 1981; mann 1996; ku¨ttel et al. 2002; tissot & souchon 2010). nevertheless, the species ordination along the thermal gradient is consistent with the literature. salmonids have the lowest thermal optimum followed by bullhead, european brook lamprey and stone loach, while souﬁe and bitterling have the highest optima (smith et al. 2004; van damme et al. 2007). bleak’s thermal optimum is probably the highest, but it could not be computed because the tjul quadratic term was not selected. comparisons with previous habitat requirement estimations for 13 species, the results can be compared with their habitat requirements estimated at the scale of france, because the environmental variables used measure the same gradients and the methodologies were similar. by working at a larger spatial extent, we were better able to disentangle the relative effect of each environ- mental factor than pont et al. (2005): our i ⁄ j ratios are higher than the ratios in their study (the lowest value is equal to their highest value). modelling the habitat requirements of ﬁsh species at the european scale a given level of conﬁdence 100(1 ) a)% (hahn & meeker 1991). ideally, one should expect to predict the presence ⁄ absence of species in new locations using the prediction interval (hahn & meeker 1991). providing the uncertainty associated with the projec- tions using various scenarios would be useful to relativise the conclusions concerning the potential effects of climate change. the major differences between our studies concern the estimation of the effect of temperature and the thermal range. high discrepancies can be observed between the independent effects of temperature: they observed a low contribution of temperature for stone loach, minnow, perch and barbel, while the temper- ature contribution exceeded 24% in our study. more- over, the average independent effect of temperature was up to 15% in the pont et al.’s study versus 34% in this study. in addition, the response patterns were different. with few exceptions, we observed bell-shaped responses along the thermal gradient (as in theory; hutchinson 1957; begon et al. 2006), whereas pont et al. (2005) mostly observed monotonous positive relationships between temperature and the probability of presence. these discrepancies are probably due to the different thermal ranges considered in the studies. the annual mean air temperature varied in the present study from )2.3 to 17.2 °c versus only 4.5–14 °c for pont et al. consequently, the results of pont et al. (2005) only account for a segment of the realised niche of these species. uncertainty in our opinion, it is valuable and relevant to assess and provide the uncertainty associated with the expected probability of presence of a species in a given environment. to our knowledge, cis are rarely or never provided. the accuracy of the models varies between species and environmental factors. for temperature, the rela- tionship seems relatively accurate with a narrow ci. several species such as spirlin, northern pike, gud- geon, barbel, nase and roach have narrow cis up to warm temperatures, their pres- ence ⁄ absence is better predicted for cold- to cool- water streams. grenouillet et al. (2011) observed a greater mismatch between predictions and species’ current occurrences in the south of france. we hypothesise that this is because of higher uncertainty in warmer temperatures and ⁄ or of the species occur- ring in french southern streams. suggesting that from a forecasting point of view, it would be even more valuable to compute the prediction interval rather than the cis. the ci is associated with a parameter of the statistical population: the expected probability of the presence of a species in a given environment with the estimated thermal ranges were highly variable. for instance, ninespine stickleback and the grayling were clearly stenothermal, while brown_trout was clearly eurythermal. this result contrasts with numer- ous studies considering brown_trout as stenothermal (blanck et al. 2007; holzer 2008). the width of the thermal range strongly inﬂuences the current distri- bution of ﬁsh in lotic hydrosystems and will deter- mine the ability of these species to adapt to climate change (buisson et al. 2008b; buisson & grenouillet 2009): stenothermal species should be more sensitive than eurythermal species (hering et al. 2009). the expansion or the contraction of the species distribu- tion areas will depend on the magnitude of the climate change (buisson et al. 2008b) and on species vagility (reynolds et al. 2005; grifﬁths 2006; van damme et al. 2007); species with a high ability to disperse will be better able to reach suitable stream reaches than species with low mobility (tudorache et al. 2008). modiﬁcations in precipitation (milly et al. 2005) will also be of major importance for the distribution of ﬁsh in future, as revealed by the effect of stp on species occurrence. precipitation should be taken into account when establishing projections. moreover, the consequences of precipitation changes could be even more important in that water temperature depends on air temperature (petts & amoros 1996) and stream hydrology (webb 1996; caissie 2006; olden & naiman 2010). in conclusion, we successfully modelled the habitat requirement of 17 widespread riverine ﬁsh species in europe. overall, the estimated relationship between environmental conditions and the probability of the presence of a species was consistent with their ecology or their distribution within the hydrosystems. we also showed the importance of (i) using a dataset covering a large spatial extent, (ii) using sites only located in the species’ distribution area, (iii) using sites not or only slightly impacted and (iv) considering both tempera- ture and precipitation to estimate the habitat require- ment of ﬁsh species. acknowledgements we are grateful to all the members of the european efi+ project, which provided all the data. this paper is a
