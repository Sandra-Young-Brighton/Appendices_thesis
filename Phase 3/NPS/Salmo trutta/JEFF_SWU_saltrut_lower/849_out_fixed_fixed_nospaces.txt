therefore, evaluating interspecific relationships is vital for conservation and management of ecosystems with introduced fishes. priest lake, idaho, supports a number of introduced species, including lake_trout salvelinus_namaycush, brook_trout s. fontinalis and opossum shrimp mysis diluviana. in this study, we used stable isotopes (d13c and d15n) to describe the food web structure of priest lake and to test hypotheses about apparent patterns in lake_trout growth. we found that isotopic niches of species using pelagic-origin carbon did not overlap with those using more littoral-origin carbon. species using more littoral- origin carbon, such as brook_trout and westslope cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarki lewisi, exhibited a high degree of isotopic niche overlap and high intrapopulation variability in resource use. although we hypothesised that lake_trout would experience an ontogenetic diet shift, no such patterns were apparent in isotopic signatures. lake_trout growth rates were not associated with patterns in d15n, indicating that variation in adult body composition may not be related to adult diet. understanding trophic relationships at both the individual and species levels provides a more complete understanding of food webs altered by non-native species. key words: stable isotopes; individual variability; trophic position; niche space introduction trophic interactions are one of the fundamental mechanisms by which niche partitioning occurs in aquatic environments. predators can have strong effects on ecosystem structuring through both direct (goldschmidt et al. 1993) and indirect (h€olker et al. 2007) pathways, especially in lentic ecosystems (northcote 1988; jackson et al. 2001). therefore, introduced predators can have an outsized effect on lacustrine systems (sala et al. 2000; eby et al. 2006; mitchell & knouft 2008), causing cascading effects on ecosystems (carpenter et al. 2001; sakai et al. 2001; cucherousset & olden 2011). evaluating inter- specific trophic relationships is therefore vital for conservation and management of ecosystems where introduced species have altered dynamics between coevolved native species. understanding how individual trait variation leads to population-level patterns can provide further insight into the dynamics of introduced species (bol- nick et al. 2003, 2011; ruffino et al. 2011; svanb€ack et al. 2015). for example, individuals of an intro- duced species may not equally contribute to negative interactions (e.g. predation) with other species. indi- viduals can respond differently to competition and novel environmental conditions (araujo et al. 2008) due to differences in phenotype and behaviour (svanb€ack & bolnick 2007). furthermore, feedback between behaviour and growth rate can reinforce individual foraging patterns (huss et al. 2008), lead- ing to correlation between phenotype and diet. as a correspondence: elizabeth l. ng, idaho cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, department of fish and wildlife sciences, university of idaho, 875 perimeter drive m.s. 1141, moscow, id 83844, usa. e-mail: ng1262@vandals.uidaho.edu doi: 10.1111/eff.12273 271 ng et al. result, generalist and specialist (e.g. piscivorous) individuals may exist within non-native fish popula- tions and contribute disproportionally to negative interactions with native species. these individuals may be identifiable by growth rates, body condition or other phenotypic traits (svanb€ack et al. 2015). therefore, linking dietary and phenotypic patterns at the individual level may provide a more complete understanding of the population-level effects of non- native species. lake_trout salvelinus_namaycush have been intro- duced widely, often to provide a trophy component to recreational fisheries (crossman 1995; martinez et al. 2009). lake_trout are apex predators (ryder et al. 1981) and introductions often cause conflicts with other sport fish and fishes of conservation con- cern (ruzycki et al. 2003; quist & hubert 2004; martinez et al. 2009; syslo et al. 2011). conflicts may be direct, via predation (eby et al. 1995; schoen et al. 2012), or indirect, via niche partitioning and competition with other predators (donald & alger 1993; meeuwig et al. 2011). over longer periods of time, the introduction of lake_trout can cause trophic cascades (tronstad et al. 2010), especially in systems with introduced opossum shrimp mysis diluviana (bowles et al. 1991; ellis et al. 2011). remained at trout o. clarki lake_trout were introduced to priest lake, idaho, in 1925, but low abundance until m. diluviana were established in the early 1970s. as a result, kokanee oncorhynchus_nerka, bull trout salvelinus_confluentus and westslope cut- throat lewisi abundance declined dramatically (venard & scarnecchia 2005; mallet 2013). despite these changes, little is known about the current trophic relationships between species in priest lake. lake_trout are also known for their plasticity (pazzia et al. 2002; zimmerman et al. 2006; mcdermid et al. 2010; muir et al. 2015) and undergo ontogenetic diet shifts (martin & olver 1980); individuals are not expected to contribute equally to effects on other species. phenotypic or behavioural traits may also affect individuals’ ability to respond to reduced prey fish abundance (stafford et al. 2013), further contribut- ing to divergence in diet and ultimately interspeci- fic interactions in priest lake. therefore, in this study, we used stable isotopes to describe current food web characteristics in priest lake and to test hypotheses about patterns in individual lake_trout diets. specifically, we hypothesised that lake_trout would experience ontogenetic shifts from a diet dom- inated by m. diluviana to one that included more lit- toral prey fishes (vander zanden & rasmussen 1996). we also hypothesised that the shift in diet would result in increasing trophic position of lake_trout with increasing length. finally, we hypothesised 272 fast-growing lake_trout would have elevated that d15n values relative to slow-growing individuals. methods priest lake is a 9,461-ha oligotrophic, dimictic lake located in the columbia river basin of northern idaho (fig. 1). thermal stratification generally occurs mid-july through the end of october, with a thermo- cline at a depth of about 35–50 m and summer sur- face water temperatures reaching 26 °c in shallow areas (kemmerer et al. 1924; bjornn 1957; rieman et al. 1979). the native fish assemblage includes bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish prosopium_williamsoni, pygmy whitefish p. coulterii, largescale sucker catostomus macrocheilus, longnose fig. 1. location of priest lake in the northern panhandle of idaho. northern c. catostomus, sucker pikeminnow ptychocheilus oregonensis, redside shiner richardso- nius balteatus, peamouth mylocheilus caurinus and slimy sculpin cottus cognatus (bjornn 1957; rieman et al. 1979; maiolie et al. 2011). in addition to lake_trout and kokanee, at least seven other fish species have been introduced: brook_trout s. fontinalis, tench tinca tinca, largemouth bass micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass m. dolomieui, northern pike esox lucius, green sunfish lepomis cyanellus and yellow perch perca flavescens (fredericks et al. 2009). fishes were collected from priest lake in spring and summer 2013 and 2014, and in autumn 2013. profundal fishes were sampled using bottom-set monofilament gill nets (depth: 20–240 m; ng 2015). nearshore areas were sampled with overnight-set floating monofilament experimental gill nets (1.8 m deep 9 45 m long; 38, 50, 64, 76, 102, and 128-mm stretch mesh) and with night-time boat-mounted elec- trofishing (smith-root inc., vancouver, wa, usa). samples of kokanee were also collected during a creel survey. finally, a large trap net was used to col- lect spawning lake_trout. zooplankton was sampled from priest lake in summer 2013 and 2014. in august 2013, m. dilu- viana were collected during a sampling effort target- ing kokanee with a midwater trawl (rieman & myers 1992). in june 2014, a 500-lm mesh (0.5 m diame- ter) plankton net and a 300-lm mesh (0.2 m diame- ter) plankton net were used to sample m. diluviana and zooplankton in priest lake. vertical tows were conducted at night through the layer of m. diluviana that was identified with sonar. and field processing immediately captured fish were measured and a small sample of white muscle tissue was removed from the anterior dorsal musculature. samples were placed on ice dur- ing frozen ( 24 °c) in the laboratory until further processing. m. diluviana were isolated from other zooplankton in the laboratory, then separated by length (small, <1 cm; large >1 cm), as diets can vary by size (chipps & bennett 2000). individual m. diluviana were combined to reach a mass of approximately 5 g wet weight per sample. bulk zooplankton samples (with m. diluviana removed) were separated into samples of roughly 5 g. observation of bulk samples indicated that they were composed primarily of cladocerans and copepods. all samples were processed for stable isotope anal- ysis by the washington state university stable iso- tope core laboratory. samples were dried at 60 °c to constant mass and ground to a fine powder. one to 2 mg of each sample was placed into a tin cup and processed for d13c and d15n values using an elemen- tal analyzer (ecs 4010; costech analytical, valen- cia, ca, usa) and a continuous flow isotope ratio food web structure and lake_trout ecology mass spectrometer (delta plusxp, thermofinnigan, bremen; brenna et al. 1998; qi et al. 2003). results were expressed as the relative difference between iso- tope ratios of the sample and a standard: d ¼ rsample   rstandard  1; 000 rstandard where d (&) is the difference, rsample is the isotopic ratio of the sample, and rstandard is the isotopic ratio of the standard (vienna pee dee belemnite for 13c/12c and atmospheric n2 for 15n/14n). samples were checked for calibration using three running stan- dards: acetanilide, corn zea mays and keratin. because lipids are generally depleted in 13c relative to proteins and carbohydrates, variation in fat content can bias estimates. we therefore used a mathematical normalisation for lipid content using the c:n ratio (post et al. 2007). priest lake trophic structure was evaluated qualita- tively by comparing individual and average d13c and d15n values using bi-plots (france 1995; vander zanden et al. 1997). sample sizes for individual taxa precluded statistical tests of differences between sea- sons and years, but visual observation indicated no major differences among sampling events. therefore, all analyses were conducted with samples pooled across time and location. trophic position of individ- ual taxa and overall food chain length was estimated by converting d15n values to trophic position. we assumed that zooplankton fed at trophic position 2 and determined successively higher trophic positions using the following equation: þ 2 tpi ¼ d15ni   d15npc 3:4 where tpi is the trophic position of the ith taxon, d15ni is the nitrogen signature of the ith taxon, and d15npc is the nitrogen signature of primary consumers (zooplankton; post 2002). stable isotope bayesian ellipses in r (siber; jackson et al. 2011) were used to estimate standard ellipse area (i.e. niche size) for members of the priest lake food web because they are robust to differences in sample size. in addition to niche size, we also evaluated the area of niche overlap between taxa in priest lake. linear regression was used to test hypotheses regarding patterns in the lake_trout population. specifically, we tested for significant increases in d13c and d15n with length to evaluate dietary parti- tioning by lake_trout that may undergo ontogenetic diet shifts. all analyses were conducted in r (version 3.1.2; r core team 2014). finally, we evaluated the relationship between lake_trout growth and trophic position. sagittal otoliths and fin rays were collected from lake_trout sampled in 2013. otoliths were 273 ng et al.  kðt t0þ mounted in epoxy, thin-sectioned with a low speed saw (buehler, lake bluff, il, usa) and viewed under a dissecting scope using transmitted light (quist et al. 2012). a von bertalanffy growth model was fit to observed length-at-age at capture data: lt ¼ l1½1   e where lt is the length at age t, l∞ is the asymptotic length, k is a growth constant, and t0 is the theoretical age when length is 0 mm (gallucci & quinn 1979). standardised residuals were used as an indicator of individual growth rate. we compared the mean d15n values of lake_trout in the upper versus lower 25th percentiles of growth by age. results over the course of the study, 15 taxa were sampled from priest lake (table 1). the food chain was rela- tively short, with a difference of only 2.3 trophic table 1. month and year of collection of stable isotope samples from taxa in priest lake, idaho, along with length range (total length, mm) for fishes. taxa brook_trout bull trout cutthroat trout kokanee lake_trout largescale sucker longnose sucker mountain whitefish mysis northern pikeminnow peamouth smallmouth bass tench yellow perch zooplankton total year month 2014 2013 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2014 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 june may october november june may october november may june april may may april may november june may november october november june august june may november june june june november june november june length 119–308 244–551 165–482 240–410 257–932 293–585 280–452 295–460 178–491 197–349 270 374–457 318 n 6 2 1 1 15 2 3 8 4 3 97 273 46 4 1 2 1 2 1 6 10 1 8 15 5 1 12 10 1 1 4 1 11 558 taxa were collected by gill nets, electrofishing, angling, zooplankton tows. trawling and 274 positions between zooplankton and the highest member, lake_trout (table 2). trophic position of bull trout (4.1) was nearly as high as for lake_trout. m. diluviana had an average trophic position of 2.7, but trophic position of smaller individuals (2.3) was lower than for large individuals (2.8). little niche overlap occurred between species using pelagic versus littoral carbon sources (fig. 2;

lake_trout had the smallest niche area (fig. 3). a cluster of species with more enriched d13c values was centred around  25.0& and included brook_trout, mountain white- longnose suckers, fish, westslope cutthroat trout, fig. 3. plot of 95% credible intervals for estimated ellipse area of taxa sampled in 2013 and 2014 from the priest lake food web. shaded boxes (from dark to light) represent 50, 75 and 95% credi- ble intervals. taxa codes are brook_trout (bkt), mountain white- fish (mwf), northern pikeminnow (npw), largescale sucker (lss), peamouth (pea), longnose sucker (lns), tench (ten), westslope cutthroat (blt), kokanee (kok), mysis diluviana (md), zooplankton (zoop), and lake_trout (lkt). (wct), bull trout trout largescale suckers, peamouth and tench. these species exhibited a high degree of niche overlap (table 3), had the most variable d13c values and tended to have larger niche sizes (fig. 3). westslope cutthroat trout had an intermediate-sized niche area, but high overlap with six other species, including three non-native species (table 3). yellow perch and smallmouth bass had the most enriched d13c values (fig. 2); however, low sample sizes precluded further analysis. total length of lake_trout was positively related to d13c value, but the relationship accounted for only 9% of the variability in d13c values (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.092). neither lake_trout length (p = 0.184, r2 = 0.005) nor growth rate (fig. 4) indicated strong relationships with d15n. although not significantly different, faster growing individuals tended to have lower d15n values. discussion priest lake was characterised by the presence of decoupled pelagic and littoral food webs; further- more, species using littoral carbon sources fed at a similar trophic level and had higher diet variability and larger niche size than species using pelagic car- bon sources. diet breadth tends to increase with increasing competition for resources (werner & hall intermediate trophic 1974) and may be highest at levels intraspecific diet variability coupled with a high degree of niche over- lap potentially indicates the presence of competition among species using littoral carbon sources in priest lake. similar patterns were observed in nearby lake pend oreille, idaho, which has a similar

2005). future studies could explore spatial, temporal and intraspecific (e.g. ontogenetic) resource partitioning (bearhop et al. 2004; matthews & mazumder 2004) to better understand these interac- tions and the role of non-native species (e.g. brook_trout, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch) in structur- ing the littoral fish assemblage. lake_trout in priest lake were apex predators; however, their trophic position was lower than in other lakes containing m. diluviana and pelagic prey fishes. trophic position of lake_trout in priest lake was nearly half a trophic position lower than in lake pend oreille, despite the presence of m. diluviana and kokanee in both lakes (clarke et al. 2005). simi- larly, lake_trout in priest lake more closely resem- bled canadian populations without access to pelagic prey fishes, which exhibited lower average trophic positions than those with access to prey fishes (van- der zanden et al. 2000). reduced lake_trout trophic position is also associated with the establishment of m. diluviana (vander zanden et al. 2003), decreased fish species richness (vander zanden et al. 1999b) 276 and increased diet generalisation (post et al. 2000). given the historical declines in kokanee abundance in priest lake (bowles et al. 1991), these patterns may reflect low prey fish abundance and reliance of lake_trout on m. diluviana in priest lake. previous work has found that ontogenetic niche shifts and intraspecific niche partitioning can be detected using stable isotopes, but we did not identify resource partitioning within the lake_trout population in priest lake. we hypothesised that low pelagic prey fish abundance in priest lake would lead to increased use of littoral fish resources, especially for larger, piscivorous individuals (vander zanden & rasmussen 1996). the poor relationship between length and d13c indicated that lake_trout of all sizes feed consistently on prey of predominantly pelagic- origin carbon signatures. the narrow niche space of lake_trout further supports the observation that indi- viduals feed similarly. the lack of observed differ- ences seen in our study contrasts with many other studies that identified patterns in d13c with length (clarke et al. 2005; keyse et al. 2007; zimmerman et al. 2009; power et al. 2012). lake_trout in priest lake either lack sufficient pressure to seek alternative prey resources (svanb€ack et al. 2015) or they may face cognitive limitations to prey switching (ishii & shimada 2010). lake_trout in priest lake did not exhibit patterns in d15n enrichment with length or growth rate, which are commonly associated with ontogenetic diet shifts in a number of fish species (grey 2001; eloranta et al. 2010; gallagher & dick 2010). however, these patterns are not always identifiable in lake_trout popu- lations (vander zanden et al. 2000; johnson et al. 2002; clarke et al. 2005). shifts in lake_trout d15n signatures may be confounded by prey signatures (vander zanden et al. 2000; keyse et al. 2007; zim- merman et al. 2009) or may reflect dietary homo- geneity. reduced consumption of m. diluviana should be detectable with stable isotopes because of substantially different signatures from that of fish. dietary homogeneity is the likely cause because prey resources are limited in priest lake (bowles et al. 1991; ng et al. in press) and intraspecific competition may prohibit individuals from increasing the propor- tion of fish in their diet. field observations of lake_trout stomach contents in priest lake indicate that many individuals, size, consumed m. diluviana (ng 2015). analysis of d15n values and growth rate provided further evidence that larger or faster growing lake_trout do not exhibit dietary differ- ences in priest lake. other factors, such as early onset of piscivory (mittelbach & persson 1998) or the confounding effect of rapid growth (hesslein et al. 1993), could be tested by examining isotopic signa- tures closer to the period of transition to piscivory. regardless of stable isotopes provide time-integrated perspectives on diet and niche partitioning, which can be used to evaluate the role of intra- and interspecific diet vari- ability in food web structure and species interactions (vander zanden & rasmussen 1999). as such, these methods provide considerable insight into the com- munity- and individual-level effects of introduced species (vander zanden et al. 1999a; svanb€ack et al. 2015). we found disjoint trophic pathways based on pelagic and littoral carbon sources that also exhibited different underlying patterns in niche size and over- lap. although lake_trout are a highly mobile predator, the narrow niche size and lack of trophic partitioning contributed to the isolation of the pelagic-based food web. given the importance of piscivores in structur- ing lacustrine ecosystems, this information enhances understanding of the food web structure in systems with non-native piscivores. acknowledgements we thank w. ament, w. harryman, j. johnson, n. porter, r. ryan and s. whitlock for their assistance with field research, and hickey brothers fisheries for
