trophic level abundance in a wastewater enriched river. ecology of freshwater fish 2007: 16: 343–353. ó 2007 the authors. journal compilation ó 2007 blackwell munksgaard abstract – it is generally accepted that nutrient enrichment of aquatic systems will lead to increased production at the top trophic level (ﬁsh). we found that in the wastewater enriched bow river, alberta rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) biomass increased over 25-fold, and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) biomass increased 5-fold, however total sportﬁsh biomass did not increase below the nutrient input point source. this was due to a dramatic downstream decrease in mountain whiteﬁsh (prosopium_williamsoni) biomass to 2% of the average biomass upstream of the municipal efﬂuent source. the spatial pattern over a 177-km river section encompassing the city of calgary, showed that the increase in trout abundance approximately tracked the expected nutrient concentrations in the river, but with a downstream lag of 20–30 km. mountain whiteﬁsh biomass over the 177 km was inversely related to the dominant trout species, rainbow trout. invertebrate abundance, macrophyte biomass and phytoplankton biomass all increased below the wastewater treatment plant outfalls. however, periphyton data were highly variable and showed no response. we propose several hypotheses as regards the factors that may have led to the decrease in mountain whiteﬁsh, based on the data from all trophic levels and the spatial pattern for ﬁsh biomass. proposed factors inﬂuencing the mountain whiteﬁsh decline were; altered competitive ability because of macrophyte abundance, ammonia toxicity and barriers to movement (weirs). p. j. askey1, l. k. hogberg1, j. r. post1, l. j. jackson1, t. rhodes2, m. s. thompson1

university dr. n.w., calgary, ab, canada; e-mail: pjaskey@ucalgary.ca accepted for publication december 15, 2006 introduction the effects of nutrient enrichment on aquatic systems have received much attention in the literature over the last several decades. many studies focus on the anthropogenic eutrophication of lakes and rivers, and the associated negative effects, such as nuisance macrophytes, algae and the associated potential for hypoxia (chambers et al. 1997; sosiak 2002; cham- bers et al. 2006). other studies use experimental fertilization (peterson et al. 1993; koning et al. 1998; johnston et al. 1999) or correlations across lakes (mcqueen et al. 1986; persson et al. 1992; mazumder 1994; brett & goldman 1997) to examine food web properties and ﬁsh production response to enrichment. of these, few studies examine food webs and ﬁsh production responses to enrichment by municipal wastewater (de bruyn et al. 2003). the majority of data and empirical tests that involve food web response to enrichment come from lakes. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00221.x 343 askey et al. analyses are often correlations that compare many lakes that differ in productivity. in general, these studies ﬁnd patterns similar to classic theoretical predictions (oksanen et al. 1981) where standing stock biomass of the top trophic level and alternating levels below increase because of enrichment (mcqu- een et al. 1986; persson et al. 1992; mazumder 1994; brett & goldman 1997; ginzburg & akcakaya 1992). to correlation analysis across systems, in contrast experimental fertilisation of aquatic systems has generally led to increases in adjacent trophic levels. this is expected, as the time scale at which many experiments are performed is often not sufﬁcient to allow populations and communities to equilibrate. in the short time frame over which most manipulations are performed, standing stock increases in the lowest trophic level(s) and individual growth responses in the top trophic level(s) are expected and observed (peterson et al. 1993; harvey et al. 1998; koning et al. 1998; johnston et al. 1999). it is not possible to conclude from such studies whether top-down effects will occur in the longer term, after ﬁsh have numer- ically equilibrated. however, two studies of systems with long-term nutrient alteration have also resulted in increases for all trophic levels (ginzburg & akcakaya 1992; de bruyn et al. 2003). the unidirectional ﬂow of rivers allows for the spatial partitioning of potential productivity within a single system. the response of nutrient perturbations may be displaced downstream because of nutrient spiralling and downstream ﬂow of plant and inverteb- rate organisms (newbold et al. 1981; anderson et al. 2005). furthermore, unlike closed systems, mobile organisms such as ﬁsh can move across productivity gradients. this changes the mechanism of biomass accumulation at from local reproduction to movement plus reproduction. how- ever, if ﬁsh compete exploitatively following an ideal free distribution, then ﬁsh density should be correlated with resource production as in closed systems (power 1984; wooton & power 1993; oksanen et al. 1995). experimental tests of trophic level interactions have been extended to rivers; however, many of these studies used enclosures that eliminate ﬁsh movement (rosemond et al. 1993; deegan et al. 1997; golden & deegan 1998; forrester et al. 1999). the top trophic level in this paper we examine the spatial patterns of three species of sport-ﬁsh in a river that receives substantial municipal nutrient inputs. the bow river originates in the rocky mountains of alberta and ﬂows east to the city of calgary as a low productivity river. while ﬂowing through calgary the river is transformed by a large point source inﬂux of nutrients that has been because of municipal wastewater relatively constant (sosiak 2002). further, we have incorporated available data since the late 1980s 344 for nutrients, primary producers and macroinverte- brates to infer potential food web processes that lead to the spatial biomass pattern observed for the top trophic level, ﬁsh. study system the bow river has a 25,430 km2 watershed and ﬂows 619 km from its headwaters in the rocky mountains to its conﬂuence with the oldman river on the southern alberta prairies. it ﬂows through the city of calgary, which has two wastewater treatment plants (wtps) that discharge their efﬂuent directly into the )1) and bow river; bonnybrook (380 million læday )1) (city of calgary fish creek (fc) (70 million læday 2002). efﬂuent from these two wtps comprises 97% of the municipal efﬂuent entering the bow river. wastewater efﬂuent input is typically 2–5% of river discharge. efﬂuent total phosphorus (tp) concentra- )1) are 30–40 times larger than back- tions (0.8 mgæl ground phosphorus concentrations (city of calgary 2002). total daily phosphorus loading is 360 kg, which is mainly from bonnybrook wtp, 304 kg tp per day (fc contributes 56 kg). our analysis uses available tp data as an indicator of nutrient enrich- ment. as phosphorus and nitrogen are associated with the same primary point source, our analysis using phosphorus should be very similar to results based on nitrogen limitation. as the bow river ﬂows through calgary, it is a typical mid-order river that is relatively wide (30–60 m) and shallow (1–3 m maximum depth), and is therefore typically considered to be nutrient, not light, limited. there are two weirs and associated water diversions within the section of river sampled for ﬁsh abundance. the purpose of the weirs is for diversion of water to irrigation canals used for agricultural and rural water supply. a telemetry study (rhodes 2005) showed that mature rainbow trout are able to bypass both of the weirs. however, the ability of other species and smaller rainbow trout to move past these weirs remain unknown. methods fish sport ﬁsh abundance [rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), brown_trout (salmo_trutta) and mountain whiteﬁsh (prosopium_williamsoni)] was estimated over a 177-km section of river, encompassing loca- tions ‘a’ to ‘b’ (fig. 1). the river was divided into 1-km subsections for which a total of 170 river sections were boat electroﬁshed. the entire length of the lower bow river study area was sampled at least once, with the

running sections of the river simultaneously. the boats used were a smith-root sr18 and a roughneck tunnelhull. each boat was equipped with a gpp 5.0 electroﬁsher unit and two ﬁxed boom anode arrays. the electroﬁsher units were set to a frequency of 30 hz and a pulse width of 3.5 ms, yielding a total power output ranging from 3.5 to 4.2 a. effort was recorded as the number of seconds electroﬁshed per 1 km of river. random subsamples of ﬁsh were measured and weighed, and a further subsample was aged from each species. the central portion of the study area (45–93 km) was sampled four times to mark and recapture ﬁsh to estimate catchability. the proportion of marked individuals recovered per unit effort of electroﬁshing provided an estimate of the efﬁciency of the boat electroﬁshers (q)

seconds per km. fish <150 mm were much less catchable, and were eliminated from the analysis as there were no data available to assess the probability of capture for ﬁsh of this size. invertebrates macroinvertebrate abundance was estimated at three sites above, and three sites below the wtps, corres- ponding to sites 1–6 of the nutrient and primary producer dataset (fig. 1). sampling occurred over a 2-day period in july, 2002 and 2003. at each site, three invertebrate samples were collected using a surber sampler with 500 lm mesh size. the surber sampler restricted the potential sample locations to the edges of the river where depth did not exceed 30 cm. each 345 askey et al. sample was preserved in 70% ethanol, and individuals were enumerated and classiﬁed to family. families were assigned to herbivorous or carnivorous feeding groups according to merrit & cummins (1996) with regard to genera found in alberta (clifford 1991). phosphorus and primary producers samples for phosphorus concentration, phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, periphyton biomass and macrophyte biomass were collected over a 3-day period in july 2003. thirteen locations, with sites on each bank of the river, were chosen to sample water above and below the wtps (fig. 1). two extra locations were sampled immediately downstream of the wtps where efﬂuent had not fully mixed across the river. water samples were collected in acid-washed polyethylene bottles, stored on ice in coolers in the ﬁeld, and refrigerated until analysis. samples were processed within 24 h for tp, following digestion with potassium persulphate, by spectrophotometry using the molybdate- blue technique (menzel & corwin 1965 as modiﬁed by prepas & rigler 1982). chlorophyll a concentration was measured after ﬁltering a known volume of water through a glass gf/c ﬁbre ﬁlter. the chlorophyll on the ﬁlter was extracted into 90% acetone and measured ﬂuorometrically (turner designs model 10, sunnyvalle, ca, usa) with correction for phaeopigments (detection limit 0.05 lgæl )1) (arar & collins 1997). periphyton biomass was estimated by assessing chlorophyll a concentration. periphyton was collected from natural rock substrata at each sampling location at a depth of 30 cm. five individual stones from each side of the river were randomly chosen at each location. a 1-cm2 area of periphyton was brushed loose with a toothbrush and collected in a sample container with as little distilled water as possible. these samples were stored on ice in a closed cooler in the ﬁeld until in the lab, periphyton samples were ﬁltered through a gf/c ﬁlter. when necessary samples were diluted with distilled water and subsampled. chlorophyll a concentration was determined as for phytoplankton. they could be frozen. macrophyte biomass was estimated by removing all above substrate macrophyte tissue within ﬁve 1-m2 quadrats, which were randomly located in the river on the left and right banks of each sampling location. samples were stored on ice in the ﬁeld and frozen until analysis. samples were washed with water to remove any attached sediments, epiphytes or invertebrates, then weighed and identiﬁed to species. analysis we examined the relationships between phosphorus and and (periphyton, macrophytes primary 346 phytoplankton), secondary (herbivorous and carnivor- ous invertebrates) and tertiary (mountain whiteﬁsh, rainbow and brown_trout) producers using regression analysis. although all variables were continuous, the abrupt change in phosphorus concentration below the wtps, caused some of the trophic components to cluster into high and low ranges of the log phosphorus concentration. despite this clustering we chose a regression approach, as we were inferring continuous processes and some plots did contain intermediate points. however, a similar result would be obtained if we used the anova analogue and an f-statistic to test the hypothesis that the cluster means increased with a categorical assessment of low and high phosphorus. the phosphorus and primary producer data were collected from the same 13 sites (on both banks, n ¼ 26). data at the two sites between the wtps (sites x1 and x2, fig. 1) where the efﬂuent had not mixed completely were not included in the regression analysis. the invertebrate samples were taken from a single bank at the ﬁrst six (most upstream) primary producer sites for 2 years (n ¼ 12), and can be directly cross-referenced with tp at those sites. the ﬁsh data were collected in 1-km sections along the river beginning below the ﬁrst study site for the lower trophic levels. thus, the ﬁsh data were contrasted with the tp of the last 12 study sites by using the ﬁsh abundance data for the corresponding kilometre location of the study site (n ¼ 12). all data were log transformed to eliminate heteroscedasticity. the macrophytes, phytoplankton and trout datasets contained zero values and were therefore transformed as log(x + 1). the different our data were collected over a spatial gradient, and represent a temporal ‘snapshot’. therefore, our data required the assumption that the system approximates equilibrium conditions to combine data across years for trophic levels. we believe the assumption to be plausible, because little change has occurred in phosphorus loading to the river since 1983 and nitrogen loading since 1988 (sosiak 2002). sosiak (2002) also showed a consistent pattern in increased macrophyte abundance below wtps from 1981 to 1996. the patterns in relative ﬁsh abundance above and below the wtps seen in this paper have long been recognised by anglers as guided trips primarily occur below the wtps. trout abundance surveys in the early 1980s show the abundance of trout to be 3–4 times higher at a single site below the wtps compared with a single site above the wtps (fernet et al. 1988). results spatial variation in ﬁsh species composition and biomass there was a clear spatial pattern in trout biomass over the 177-km sampled section of the bow river. trophic level abundance in an enriched river rainbow trout brown_trout ) 1 – · m k g k ( s s a m o b i 1500 1000 500

loess tricube weight functions (polynomial degree ¼ 1, sampling proportion ¼ 0.3 and sigmaplot 2001). note the differences in scale on the y-axis. rainbow and brown_trout density was low above the wtps, but there was a large initial increase down- stream of the wtps followed by a gradual decrease with distance from the city (fig. 2). biomass increased over 25-fold and over 5-fold at peak locations below the wtps for rainbow trout and brown_trout, respect- ively. the spatial trends (loess tricube weight func- tion) indicate that rainbow trout biomass reached a peak at 60 km, whereas brown_trout biomass was at a maximum at 48 km (fig. 2). we calculated the spatial lag for which the nutrient perturbation manifests in trout abundance as the distance between the peak nutrient concentration and the peak in ﬁsh biomass. bonnybroook wtp is the primary source of phospho- rus loading, and was used as the nutrient input location (27 km), and distance from fc wtp (41 km) is reported in parentheses. we estimated that there is a 21 km (7 km to fc) lag in brown_trout response and a 33 km (19 km to fc) lag for rainbow trout. the shorter response distance by brown_trout is followed by a quicker decline in biomass downstream than for rainbow trout (fig. 2). the spatial pattern in whiteﬁsh biomass was the inverse of the pattern for the two trout species. a cross-correlation analysis (systat statistical package, version 8, san jose, ca, usa) revealed that mountain whiteﬁsh were inversely related to rainbow trout (r ¼ )0.266, n ¼ 170 and p < 0.001), but not brown_trout (r ¼ 0.022, n ¼ 170 and p ¼ 0.781). the two trout species were positively correlated (r ¼ 0.336, n ¼ 170 and p < 0.001). whiteﬁsh abundance declined rapidly below bonnybrook wtp and reached a minimum at 75 km (loess tricube weight function, fig. 2). there is a small increase in the whiteﬁsh at 95 km, which corresponds to the carseland weir. no such trend was noted at the weir located at 23 km, suggesting that this weir did not impede movement. the whiteﬁsh biomass was very high upstream of the wtp and declined rapidly below the wtp where rainbow trout abundance was increasing rapidly. the opposing spatial patterns of trout and whiteﬁsh led to abrupt changes in relative species abundance. at 1–20 km whiteﬁsh made up 98% of total sportﬁsh biomass, however, by 71–90 km the two trout species 347 askey et al. made up 97% of sportﬁsh biomass. the increase in trout biomass was primarily because of rainbow trout, as this species constituted the majority of sportﬁsh biomass below the point source inﬂux of nutrients. however, after the carseland weir at 95 km, the relative abundance of mountain whiteﬁsh increased to comprise about half of the sportﬁsh biomass for the remaining 74 km of the study section. trophic structure response to enrichment despite a fourfold difference in tp concentration, there was no response of periphyton biomass to enrichment when comparing the sites above the wtps with sites in well mixed water below the wtps (table 1, fig. 3). however, data were also obtained at two locations where the water had not mixed completely and phosphorus concentrations were much higher on the right bank than on the left (fig. 1). at these sites there was a more than 28-fold increase in tp from upstream values, and periphyton biomass increased over fourfold from upstream estimates. thus periphyton was signiﬁcantly correlated to tp concen- tration when the unmixed locations were included (r2 ¼ 0.578, n ¼ 30 and p < 0.05). unlike periph- yton, phytoplankton signiﬁcantly increased with tp concentration (table 1, fig. 3). macrophytes were only present at sites below the wtps and therefore macrophyte biomass was signiﬁcantly correlated to phosphorus concentrations (table 1). macroinvertebrates were classiﬁed into herbivores and carnivores; however, herbivores comprised 98.6% of the biomass. herbivorous macroinvertebrate abun- dance increased below the wtps (table 1, fig. 3). carnivores did not show a signiﬁcant response to phosphorus concentration. in general, macroinverte- brates responded positively to enrichment, with almost all orders increasing in abundance below the wtps for 2002 and 2003. the only exception, plecoptera, was a small percentage of the invertebrate community and was not encountered below the wtps in 2002 (table 2). the relative increase in abundance was not constant across orders and the relative species composition changed above and below the wtps (table 2). mountain whiteﬁsh, rainbow trout and brown_trout were the dominant species in the catch over the entire 177-km sample section (total catch 6653 ﬁsh). their combined biomass did not increase in response to enrichment as predicted by food web theory, in fact, total biomass showed a slight, but nonsigniﬁcant negative response (fig. 3, table 1). however, signiﬁ- cant relationships did occur when total ﬁsh biomass was divided into trout and whiteﬁsh. combined trout biomass increased signiﬁcantly (table 1, fig. 3) and whiteﬁsh decreased signiﬁcantly (table 1, fig. 3) in response to enrichment. discussion the advective nature of rivers leads to a net dispersal of nutrients, primary producers and invertebrates that is unidirectional. thus there is an expected spatial lag in the response of river food webs to perturbations (anderson et al. 2005, 2006). the most extensive data available for our study were for the sportﬁsh abundance, which allowed for spatial visualisation over a 177-km river section. unlike lower trophic levels, ﬁsh are able to move freely over large distances and track available resources. it is known that over 80% of mature the rainbow trout migrate into the highwood river, a tributary of the bow river, to spawn (rhodes 2005). therefore, the spatial pattern in our ﬁsh data must be reset annually and maintained through movement. we expect that the trout biomass pattern tracks invertebrate production, and that the downstream spatial lag in response to nutrient inputs represents the net impact of advection, nutrient spiralling and energy ﬂow

which these processes interact in lotic systems. unfortunately, our invertebrate data do not have sufﬁcient spatial distance or detail to assess rigorously the underlying mechanisms. the phospho- rus data do not extend to the spatial scale of the ﬁsh data, and do not noticeably decline downstream within the sampling area. however, the broader spatial scale for which sosiak (2002) measured total dissolved phosphorus indicated that phosphorus does decline downstream within the spatial range of our ﬁsh data. 349 askey et al. table 2. the changes in numerical density (numberæm)2) and

0.01 0.01 1.00 values are expressed as means of three sites with associated standard error (se). the change in abundance below the nutrient input is summarised as an increase (+) or decrease ()). relative composition is the proportion of numerical density represented by a given order. the most unexpected result of this study was that the aggregated top trophic level did not increase with enrichment. this result contradicts theory based on trophic levels as ecological units and has rarely been documented (persson et al. 1991; hulot et al. 2000). although the three ﬁsh species are not exact ecological equivalents, all rely on the invertebrate trophic level as a primary food source (scott & crossman 1973; nelson & paetz 1992). the overall negative trend in ﬁsh biomass was driven by mountain whiteﬁsh, which rapidly declined below the city of calgary and overwhelmed the increase in the two trout species. the spatial cross-correlation analysis showed that rainbow trout and whiteﬁsh are inversely related. thus the large decline in whiteﬁsh abundance could be due to a change in the relative competitive abilities of the two species associated with the wastewater efﬂuent. although we do not have the data necessary to investigate interaction between trout and whiteﬁsh, our data for the lower trophic levels allow us to infer processes that may affect this competitive interaction. explicitly the competitive a change in competitive advantage could occur because of changes in species composition at the trophic level below ﬁsh. for example, invertebrate composition could change to favour species that are less vulnerable to whiteﬁsh than trout. peterson et al. (1993) reported a decrease in the second most 350 species, abundant macroinvertebrate blackﬂies (prosimulium martini), in the experimentally enriched section of an artic river. change in community composition within the macroinvertebrate trophic level appears to be a consistent pattern among enriched lotic systems (peterson et al. 1993; harvey et al. 1998; de bruyn et al. 2003). in our study there was a switch in the dominant species from diptera above the wtps to ephemeroptera below the wtps (in 2003 only). however, although the relative abundances of inver- tebrate orders did change, the numerical abundance of all invertebrate orders increased. therefore, all inver- tebrates preferentially consumed by mountain white- ﬁsh were more abundant below the wtps. thus, the spatial pattern of whiteﬁsh is not simply driven by prey limitation. the presence of macrophytes below the wtps may be an important factor which alters the instream habitat, and thereby inﬂuences predator–prey interac- tions (diehl 1993). mountain whiteﬁsh morphology allows them to forage effectively for invertebrates amongst rivers (scott & crossman 1973). the presence of macrophytes may inhibit foraging behaviour and would thus decrease the competitive ability of mountain whiteﬁsh. periphyton is usually the focus of stream food web studies, as it is the main food source for macro- invertebrates (angradi 1994; france 1995). however, the rocky substrate of this macrophytes are an important part of the primary producer data because of their role in habitat structure. the hypothesis that macrophytes are altering the interaction between trout and whiteﬁsh is supported by the lag in trout and whiteﬁsh response below the wtps. macrophyte abundance is lagged because of the distance needed for nutrients to spiral and be incorporated into sediments where macrophytes derive their nutrients (jackson et al. 1991). predation could also be a factor in the negative spatial correlation between rainbow trout and moun- tain whiteﬁsh. although brown_trout tend to be more piscivorous than rainbow trout (nelson & paetz 1992), predation by adult trout on young whiteﬁsh may depress whiteﬁsh abundance in the enriched reaches of the river. unfortunately, we do not have the empirical data necessary to assess this hypothesis more fully. we feel it is unlikely that the spatial pattern in ﬁsh abundance can be explained by changes in habitat quality. we do not have data on any abiotic habitat variables; however, no abrupt changes in habitat were apparent during ﬁsh sampling. furthermore, a trout habitat suitability index for the bow river from 0 to 70 km presented in anderson et al. (2006) does not correlate with the ﬁsh biomass patterns in our study. there are two potential abiotic factors that may have inﬂuenced the apparent negative effect of nutrient enrichment on whiteﬁsh. first, the carseland ﬁsh weir at 95 km appears to inhibit mountain whiteﬁsh movement, as abundance below the weir is substantially higher than directly above it. however, the low abundance above the weir extends for a large distance of approximately 40 km, thus it does not appear that the weir is the primary factor inﬂuencing abundance. furthermore, although our macrophyte data do not extend below the carseland weir, sosiak’s (2002) basin wide survey found a few submerged macrophytes further downstream. therefore, higher whiteﬁsh abundance below the weir could be due to the absence of macrophytes. a second abiotic factor that may explain the low mountain whiteﬁsh abun- dance downstream of the wtp is ammonia loading from the municipal efﬂuent. the concentration of ammonia producing 50% mortality (lc50) for moun- )1, range: 0.143–0.473) is tain whiteﬁsh (0.289 mgæl approximately half of the lc50s reported for rainbow and brown_trout (environment canada 2001). sosiak (2002) reported the highest ammonia concentrations at his ﬁrst sampling site below the wtps, corresponding to approximately 60 km of our study. at that site, median ammonia concentrations between 1989 and )1, however, 1996 were in the range: 0.11–0.28 mgæl )1 this concentration dropped to only 0.01–0.06 mgæl at the carseland weir (96 km). therefore, it is possible that ammonia concentrations in the section of river near and above the 60 km sampling site were trophic level abundance in an enriched river sufﬁcient to affect mountain whiteﬁsh negatively. however, the lowest abundance of whiteﬁsh is well below 60 km where the ammonia concentrations have decreased. given the available data, we cannot conclude to what extent abiotic factors and/or the proposed competition–predation processes can explain the spatial pattern of whiteﬁsh abundance. in the bow river, we did not observe a positive enrichment response at the top trophic level and alternating responses at lower trophic levels, as would be predicted by classic theory (oksanen et al. 1981). however, it is now recognised that predicting food web response to enrichment is more complicated and requires data on relative biomasses and interaction strengths of trophic groups (abrams 1993; biggs et al. 2000). from a management standpoint it may be more realistic to try to predict at what stage speciﬁc detrimental changes, such as, nuisance periphyton and macrophytes occur (sosiak 2002). our data indicate that macrophytes may be an important factor that led to the switch in dominant ﬁsh species. if nutrient inputs to the bow river continue to increase, then macrophyte biomass could potentially reach a level where large-scale ﬁsh mortality occurs because of hypoxia. this would lead to a new community state dominated by ﬁsh species with greater tolerance for low oxygen levels below the wtps. this documentation of effects of enrichment of the bow river system by municipal wastewater is an example of a common situation. many major cities are located near water bodies, and a greater understanding of the effects of enrichment because of land use practices on aquatic systems is needed. furthermore, fertilization projects have been implemented in some aquatic systems with the objective of increasing ﬁsh production. the rainbow and brown_trout ﬁshery in the bow river has apparently beneﬁted from the increase in abundance because of enrichment from sewage efﬂuent. however, the drastic change in dominant ﬁsh species above and below the wtps is troublesome. if anglers preferred whiteﬁsh over then the enrichment of the bow river would be viewed much more negatively. our study is one example by which enrichment may increase or decrease abundance of species at the top trophic level. trout, acknowledgements we
