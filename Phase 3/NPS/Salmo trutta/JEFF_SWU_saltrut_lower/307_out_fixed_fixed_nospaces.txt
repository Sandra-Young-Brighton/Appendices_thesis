and landscape and local factors in 20 backwaters of the seine river ﬂood plain. using multiple linear regression, we tested the importance of three types of variable for explaining total species richness (tsr), phytophil species richness (psr) and lithophil species richness (lsr): (1) colonisation–extinction processes, (2) habitat heterogeneity and (3) productivity. at the local scale, no variables describing habitat heterogeneity correlated with tsr, psr or lsr. productivity was correlated only with tsr according to a polynomial model. in contrast, variables relating to the colonisation–extinction process correlated with tsr, psr and lsr: tsr varied mainly with backwater size, which is a surrogate of extinction, whereas psr and lsr correlated with the relative longitudinal position of backwaters and the size of their connection to the main channel. in conclusion, it seems that the total ﬁsh richness varies as a function of local factors, whereas the components of ﬁsh diversity are rather inﬂuenced by landscape factors. key words: ﬁsh species richness; backwaters; connectivity; habitat diversity; productivity e. tales, cemagref, unite´ de

species diversity are inﬂuenced by historical and geographical circumstances as well as by ecological factors (schluter & ricklefs 1993). diversity can be inﬂuenced by historical events, such as tectonic processes, glaciation and climatic changes (brown et al. 2001). history inﬂuences large-scale patterns of species richness, across large biogeographic regions. when patterns of species richness are considered within a single ecoregion, inhabited by species drawn from the same regional species pool, biogeographic factors are less evident. in this case, patterns of local diversity are thought to depend mainly on contemporary eco- logical factors operating at a local or landscape scale. at the landscape scale, particularly in patchy environments, the coexistence of species and the resulting local diversity is maintained by the exchange of individuals between different habitat patches (holt 1993). thus, species richness of a particular habitat patch depends on the characteristics of the adjacent landscape. consequently, explanations of local com- munity richness must include a hierarchical framework integrating both landscape and local ecological factors, which are determinants of the number of co-occurring species (angermeier & winston 1998; brown et al. 2001; lomolino & smith 2003). thus, an appropriate scale for investigating the importance of these two factor types is a mesoscale where assemblages form a metacommunity (ricklefs & schluter 1993). based on the metapopulation concept, a metacommunity can be deﬁned as a set of local communities coupled by dispersal of potentially interacting species (see leibold et al. 2004 for a review). fish assemblages in riverine landscapes provide a suitable model for examining this issue. indeed, a 144 doi:

isolated aquatic patches among a terrestrial matrix, connected only through the main channel (i.e., a ﬂuvial corridor) (amoros & bornette 2002). fish require these ﬂood plain water bodies as complementary habitat to complete their life cycle (schlosser 1995). their functional role as spawning and nursery grounds is well known for ﬁsh inhabiting large european lowland rivers, e.g., in the upper rhoˆne (copp 1989), the austrian danube (schiemer & waidbacher 1992), the lower rhine (neumann et al. 1996), the lower seine (tales et al. 1996) and the lower garonne (gozlan et al. 1998). in these large lowland rivers, adult ﬁsh (espe- cially cyprinids) migrate in spring every year, from the main channel to adjacent backwaters where they spawn (molls 1999; borcherding et al. 2002). the resulting young-of-the-year (yoy) ﬁsh spend their ﬁrst summer in the backwaters, where they feed on the higher abundance of plankton (baras & nindaba 1999). habitat shifts of yoy ﬁsh between backwaters and the main channel occur later (baras & nindaba 1999; borcherding et al. 2002), because backwaters provide protection against high current velocity (gaudin 2001). therefore, accumulations of yoy ﬁsh in ﬂood plain water bodies are testament to the reproductive success, which initially depends on the effective selection of reproductive sites by adult ﬁsh. we assume that this selection is constrained by features of ﬂood plain water bodies at both landscape and local scales. thus, focusing on yoy ﬁsh in ﬂood plain water bodies, our general goal is to determine what factors are likely to inﬂuence ﬁsh biodiversity in lowland riverine landscapes. we accounted for colonisation and extinc- tion assuming that (1) the probability of colonisation decreases with increasing distance from the source of potential colonists (i.e., increasing isolation) and (2) the probability of extinction increases as habitat size decreases (macarthur & wilson 1967). therefore, we expected that yoy ﬁsh species richness will be associated with the relative longitudinal position of backwaters, their connectivity to the main channel and their size. alternatively, the effect of habitat size on species richness can be explained by the passive sampling hypothesis. it holds that the increase in species number is simply the result of sampling effort, as greater numbers of samples contain greater numbers of individuals (connor & mccoy 1979). therefore, we examined the effects of sampling effort on estimates of ﬁsh species richness in ﬂood plain water bodies. we also tested two hypotheses relating species richness to local processes: (1) the habitat heterogene- ity hypothesis (ricklefs & schluter 1993) and (2) the energy hypothesis (wright 1983). the ﬁrst hypothesis holds that species richness increases with an increasing variety of habitat types (i.e., spatial variability). the second hypothesis predicts that species richness is linearly or curvilinearly correlated with productivity (wright et al. 1993). we estimated local habitat heterogeneity of ﬂood plain water bodies as the variability of multiple microhabitat characteristics and, to test the productivity hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between yoy ﬁsh species richness and primary productivity in ﬂood plain water bodies. methods study area the study area is located in the alluvial ﬂood plain of the seine river, about 100 km upstream from paris (fig. 1). the study sector is 25 km long, between two weirs: this reach has been bypassed with a shipping canal since the second half of the 19th century. presently, this canal is not functional. at this location, the seine river is ﬁfth order, 50 m wide on average, with an annual mean ﬂow of 25 m3æs )1. the study reach encompasses various kinds of lateral ﬂood plain water bodies, which result from natural displacements of the minor bed of the seine river. in late june 1995, at the end of the spawning season for the ﬁsh species considered, we inventoried downstream 17 16 18 19 20 gauging station 15 14 13 11 12 channel backwater 10 upstream 1 89 7 4 5 6 2 3 10 weir at conflans-sur-seine fig. 1. location of the study reach of

channel, which were expec- ted to contain the most diverse ﬁsh assemblage (tockner et al. 1998). hydrological connectivity between the ﬂood plain and the main channel varies with seasonal water levels, according to ﬂow. an analysis of daily ﬂow measured between 1979 and 2001 at the gauging station at pont-sur-seine (fig. 1) )1 during the showed that mean ﬂow was 84 m3æs spawning season (april to june) in 1995, and occurred on average every 2 years during this period. among 43 water bodies permanently connected to the main channel (secondary channels, cut-off mean- ders and backwaters), 20 backwaters were selected for study. these backwaters were connected to the main channel by just one downstream connection, and therefore were lentic and could be considered as large inshore bays. they formed a homogeneous set of backwaters according to their geomorphological origin. fish sampling fish in all 20 backwaters were sampled twice in 1995, between 31 july and 4 august and between 4 and 8 september. this repeated sampling encompasses with- in-season variability of the yoy ﬁsh community, although during this period it is relatively stable. this period separates two phases of high mortality, the early larval phase and the overwintering juvenile phase (copp & penaz 1988). fish were collected by electroﬁshing from a boat using the point abundance sampling method (persat & copp 1990). the number of sampling points in each backwater varied relative to its surface area (surf). following copp (1989), we used a portable electroﬁshing apparatus ﬁtted with a smaller ring-shaped anode (diameter 10 cm) for higher efﬁciency in catching small ﬁsh. each sample point was randomly located and consisted of a submersion of the activated anode roughly 50 cm deep. stunned ﬁsh were then collected using a dip net (1-mm mesh). captured ﬁsh were identiﬁed, measured for total length to the nearest millimetre and returned to the water. fish that were not identiﬁable in the ﬁeld were immediately preserved in a 5% formaldehyde solution and subse- quently identiﬁed and measured in the laboratory. yoy ﬁsh were distinguished from older ones by analysing length–frequency distributions. when species abun- dance was too low to conduct this analysis, we referred to the literature on species growth. estimate of species richness we considered the two ﬁshing occasions as replicate samples allowing an estimate of cumulative species richness in each backwater. indeed, the ranking of backwaters with respect to ﬁsh species richness is 146 rank freely at: correlation coefﬁcient: similar in both series of samples, as indicated by a signiﬁcant positive correlation between the two series (spearman 0.587; p ¼ 0.0120). however, estimates of species richness are sensitive to sampling effort and typically, species richness increases asymptotically with sampling effort (angermeier & smogor 1995). to avoid bias resulting from different sampling efforts and to consider the passive sampling hypothesis, we examined how species richness accumulated with increasing number of sampling points for each backwater. we analysed sampling efﬁciency for each backwater by estimating a potential maximum species richness using estimates software application (colwell 2004. estimates can be obtained http://purl.oclc.org/estimates). estimates computes estimators of species richness based on random resampling of data sets and functional extrapolations. thus, we ran 100 randomisations, which were averaged to compute mean cumulative species richness curve for each backwater: the ﬁnal value (i.e., the value of the asymptote) is an estimate of potential maximum species richness. hence, we could compare this value with the recorded species richness. as recent studies have emphasised using species traits rather than taxonomic units (i.e., functional diversity vs. species diversity) because species traits have a functional signiﬁcance (poff 1997; townsend et al. 1997; lamouroux et al. 2002), we accounted for species richness of various functional groups. here, we selected the species trait reﬂecting reproductive strategies of ﬁsh species, and we thus estimated the species richness of reproductive guilds, according to balon’s classiﬁcation (balon 1975). habitat diversity we evaluated habitat diversity from three variables: the mean depth of each backwater (depth) directly recorded in the ﬁeld and two habitat diversity indices (sd1 and sd2) resulting from a multivariate character- isation of the physical habitat. first, during july 1995, depths were recorded at several locations in each backwater along linear transects, placed perpendicu- larly to its maximum length. the number of transects varied from four to eight, according to backwater size. for each transect, depth was recorded at 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of its width. from all these measurements, we then calculated the ﬁrst variable of habitat diversity, depth (mean: 0.73 m; range: 0.30–1.20 m). secondly, during ﬁsh sampling (i.e., in august and september 1995), we visually estimated ﬁve environmental features at each ﬁsh sampling point, in order to characterise physical habitat: bank type (steep sloped, beach, open water), substratum (silt, clay, sand/gravel) and abundance of aquatic vegetation, woody shelters and riparian cover (scarce, medium, dense). the abundance of vegetation and woody shelters was estimated according to their cover projected on the bottom, over the surface area of ﬁsh sampling points. similarly, the abundance of riparian cover depended on the shoreline length covered by shrubs and trees, at the location of ﬁsh sampling points. we omitted current velocity in our study because it was not relevant, given the strictly lentic nature of the backwaters, although this variable usually contributes to ﬁsh habitat diversity (matthews 1998). we believed that sampling points yielded a good description of habitat diversity in backwaters, as they were randomly distributed and their number was proportional to backwater size. instead of using directly environmental data, we performed a multivariate analysis (not presented here) of the ﬁve environmental variables to reduce dimen- sionality and eliminate collinearity in these variables. as they were qualitatively coded, we conducted a multiple correspondence analysis (mca) on the data · points matrix (5 environmental variables · 575 sampling points) using the mca module of the ade-4 software (thioulouse et al. 1997. the ade4 library can be obtained freely at: http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ ade-4). mca is a factor analysis method: it is similar to principal components analysis with categorical variables instead of continuous variables. this multi- variate analysis resulted in a synthesis of the overall variability of environmental parameters on several axes. the ﬁrst two axes were retained as synthetic independent variables for further analyses. indeed, to obtain the two others variables characterising habitat diversity, we calculated the standard deviations (sds) of scores of sampling points on these two axes (sd1 and sd2), for each backwater, according to an approach used by grossman et al. (1998). sd and habitat diversity are positively related. productivity we used chlorophyll-a concentration (chloro) as a measure of productivity. we previously analysed a data set of physicochemical parameters measured in backwaters, which included chloro, total organic carbon and nutrients contents (no  4 ). a principal component analysis of this data set empha- sised a strong association between all these parameters and primary productivity as measured by chloro. therefore, we selected the latter parameter for further analyses as a synthetic indicator of productivity. 3 and po3  this parameter was measured from samples collec- ted on three occasions during the summer of 1995 (18 july, 24 august and 19 september). duplicate surface water samples were taken in the pelagic zone of each backwater and were then ﬁltered through 1.2-lm mesh in the ﬁeld. filters were immediately frozen and later analysed in the laboratory by molecular absorption controls of local yoy ﬁsh species richness in ﬂood plain water bodies )1, )1) was calculated according to spectrometry. mean chloro (mean: 40.2 lgæl range: 5.4–200.9 lgæl lorenzen’s method (lorenzen 1967). colonisation and extinction we used surrogate measures of colonisation and extinction. we used the cross-sectional surface of the connection between backwaters and the main channel (connec; mean: 1208 m2, range: 150–4680 m2) as a measure of isolation of backwaters, because we assumed that the probability of a connected backwater being colonised by adult ﬁsh for spawning is positively related to the size of its connection with the main channel. that is, colonisation probability should be inversely related to isolation from the main channel. thus, yoy ﬁsh species richness was expec- ted to be higher in backwaters with larger connections. connec was evaluated from direct ﬁeld measures in july 1995, before ﬁsh sampling. width and depths were measured along one transect placed across the connection to calculate connec for each backwater. we also retained a variable locating backwaters along the longitudinal gradient of the study reach. this variable, measured on maps (1:25,000), was the distance separating a backwater from the upstream weir range: 0.77–23.56 km). a hydraulic gradient occurs along the study reach as a result of the presence of weirs and potentially inﬂuences the longitudinal distribution of ﬁsh species. this inﬂuence was proved on the yoy ﬁsh densities of various reproductive guilds in this sector of the seine river (berrebi-dit-thomas et al. 2001). we assumed that dist could thus inﬂuence colonisation events, because a backwater is close to various sources of potential colonists according to its position in the study reach. finally, we included water surface area, surf (mean: 1511 m2, range: 267–5350 m2) as a surrogate measure of extinction. yoy ﬁsh species richness is expected to be higher as backwater size increases. it is expected to be lower in the smaller backwaters, reﬂecting either true mortality or more likely the failure to establish. surf was also evaluated from ﬁeld measures in july 1995, using the same design as for depth estimate. (dist; statistical analysis multiple regression analyses were used to determine how habitat diversity and colonisation–extinction processes, represented by six independent variables, could explain species richness or richness of repro- ductive guilds in backwaters. to discern the relation- ship between richness and productivity level, we ﬁrst performed polynomial regression because hump- shaped relationships predominate in aquatic systems (mittelbach et al. 2001). 147 tales & berrebi as the number of samples was rather low in comparison with the number of tested variables (n ¼ 20 for seven variables), we chose to examine separately the effects of habitat diversity, productivity and colonisation–extinction processes on richness. hence, there was no need to correct for multiple comparisons when we tested the different hypotheses. as surf is an important predictor of species richness, not removing its effects may obscure relationships with other variables. this is why we performed a second series of multiple regressions, with accounting for surf as explanatory variable. thus, we checked a posteriori its potential inﬂuence on the relationships between species richness and variables of habitat diversity and productivity. to reduce non-normality of distribution and hetero- geneity of variance of variables, initial data were log transformed [log (x) or log (x + 1)] prior to analysis. all the statistical analyses were performed using systat (spss, chicago, il, usa), using the general linear model (glm procedure). results general results 18 species in the overall study reach (table 1). all the captured species but one (lepomis gibbosus) are native and very representative as ﬁsh community of european lowland rivers. total yoy ﬁsh species richness (tsr) observed in each backwater ranged from 5 to 14 species. our sampling incorporated 80– 100% of the potential maximum species richness in all backwaters (table 1). therefore, as estimates of species richness did not depend on the number of sampling points in backwaters, we concluded that we adequately estimated total species richness, even for the less sampled backwaters. five reproductive guilds were represented in this community. we excluded two guilds (ostracophilous and nest guarder spawners) from our analysis because they were represented by only one species. in addition, we did not take into account the phytolithophil guild because its species have no speciﬁc requirements for spawning. finally, we retained the richness of only two reproductive guilds for subsequent analysis, the lithophils (lsr) and phytophils (psr), each represen- ted by six species in the yoy ﬁsh community. the species of require mineral and vegetal substratum for deposing their eggs. psr and lsr ranged from one to ﬁve species and one to six species, respectively. these two guilds, respectively, a total of 575 points were sampled in the 20 backwaters. we collected 9057 yoy ﬁsh representing before

relationships were signiﬁcant, indicating a corre- lation between (1) dist and sd2 (r ¼ )0.5660; p ¼ 0.0093) and (2) sd1 and sd2 (r ¼ 0.7512; p ¼ 0.0001). therefore, we omitted sd2 for subse- quent analysis to avoid biased results via multicollin- earity problems. we expected a relationship between surf and habitat diversity (as expressed by depth, sd1 and sd2), but no such correlation was signiﬁcant. richness versus habitat diversity in backwaters, species richness was not related to habitat diversity (no model was signiﬁcant). no independent variable was correlated with tsr, psr or lsr (tables 2–4). including surf in multiple regression analysis did not modify the relationships between species richness and the variables of habitat diversity except for psr: (r2 ¼ 0.726; the psr model became signiﬁcant p < 0.001) with a signiﬁcant contribution of surf (p < 0.001) and sd1 (p ¼ 0.0104) to the psr variance. whereas surf positively correlated to psr, sd1 exhibited a negative correlation with psr. richness versus productivity level no relationship was signiﬁcant. however, the scatter plot of tsr against chloro exhibited an outlier (fig. 2a). there was no particular reason to explain this outlier (e.g., ﬁsh or chlorophyll sampling problems), but we decided to remove it from the previous analysis. then, we retested relationships with the following results. a signiﬁcant model occurred (table 2), explaining a rather low proportion of variance (31.4%). tsr was particularly variable at low levels of productivity (fig. 2a). however, the p-value asso- ciated with the squared term in this relationship was not signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.1474). although scatter plots of psr and lsr against chloro tended to exhibit a curvilinear trend, none of these models was signiﬁcant (tables 3 and 4). the relationship between psr and chloro was only marginally signiﬁcant (n ¼ 19; r2 ¼ 0.289; p ¼ 0.0649). all the relationships between species richness and chloro remained unchanged after accounting for surf as independent variable. however, a signiﬁcant model occurred for psr (r2 ¼ 0.619; p ¼ 0.019) when surf was included, but only surf signiﬁ- cantly contributed to psr (p ¼ 0.0026). richness versus colonisation–extinction variables the three models for tsr, psr and lsr were signiﬁcant. however, the contribution of each inde- pendent variable varied with the dependent variable considered. table 2. results of (1) multiple regression analy- sis of total species richness (tsr) versus varia- bles of habitat diversity (depth and sd1), (2) polynomial regression analysis

correlated with tsr (table 2), whereas neither dist nor connec explained tsr. this relationship corresponded to the classical species–area relationship (fig. 2b). this model accounted for 66.4% of the variation in tsr. the same signiﬁcant trend between psr and surf was observed, meaning that more phytophil species inhabit large backwaters (fig. 3). further, psr was signiﬁcantly explained by dist (table 3). psr increased as dist increased, that is more phytophil discussion our analysis pointed out the effects of local and landscape factors on local yoy ﬁsh species richness in ﬂood plain water bodies, in identifying inﬂuences of both productivity and colonisation–extinction dynam- ics. in contrast, we observed no consistent effects of habitat diversity on local yoy ﬁsh species richness. previous studies on yoy ﬁsh communities in riverscapes emphasised the role of species ecological 150 controls of local yoy ﬁsh species richness in ﬂood plain water bodies 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3

or at multiple scales (poizat & pont 1996; gozlan et al. 1998). finally, microhabitat conditions for the early life history phase are thought to be decisive for successful ﬁsh recruitment (schiemer 1999). although these conditions constrain community composition, they seemed not to inﬂuence the overall community diversity. in our study, habitat diversity, based on microhabitat measures, never affected ﬁsh richness in backwaters of the seine river. furthermore, our results contrast with those of previous studies that have exhibited positive relationships between ﬁsh diversity and habitat diversity in panamanian streams (gorman & karr 1978), stream (schlosser 1982) and in virginia streams (angermeier & winston 1998) and at a more global scale, in 292 rivers across continents (guegan et al. 1998). a positive effect of depth on ﬁsh species richness has also been demonstrated in a recent multiscale study of ﬁsh assemblages in the midwestern usa (marsh- matthews & matthews 2000). however, all these studies were not focused on yoy ﬁsh. in an illinois in our richness we suggest that habitat heterogeneity did not affect ﬁsh species study, because the backwaters were rather homogeneous with respect to habitat. they likely contained similar habitats or at least, the same level of habitat variability. our omission of a key factor describing habitat diversity seems unlikely because we used a combination of ‘classical’ parameters (depth and substratum), which are known to inﬂuence ﬁsh diversity (matthews 1998). a rather unexpected relationship occurred when we accounted for the surf of backwaters in the regres- sion analyses: richness of phytophil species and habitat diversity were negatively correlated. we can explain this negative relationship just because greater habitat diversity does not necessarily include an increase of vegetation shelters, which almost support phytophil species. in contrast, our study seems to support the global relationship between species richness and productivity, although this relationship occurred only after exclu- sion of an outlier. despite numerous studies, this relationship remains controversial because (1) it can exhibit various shapes (positive, negative or unimodal) (wright et al. 1993) and (2) several mechanisms are involved in its explanation (rosenzweig & abramsky 1993). however, a recent review clariﬁed this relation- ship and concluded that in aquatic systems, hump- shaped curves are the most common (mittelbach et al. 2001). our results are congruent with this observation, although the relationship between yoy ﬁsh diversity and productivity was curvilinear rather than hump shaped. moreover, in our data, tsr was particularly variable at low levels of productivity. thus, ﬁsh species richness should be higher at an intermediate level of productivity. richness of reproductive guilds does not vary as a function of productivity level. even if the psr model was signiﬁcant after including the surf of backwa- ters as supplementary variable, only this latter variable signiﬁcantly contributed to phytophil species richness. this probably reﬂects that the species richness– productivity relationship is a global pattern. we can assume that results should be different if we consid- ered trophic guilds instead of reproductive guilds. diversity of trophic guilds is expected to be inﬂuenced by level of productivity in aquatic systems (leibold 1999). colonisation and extinction play a major role in explaining yoy ﬁsh species richness in our study, because of their high contribution to all richness variables. notably, we can conclude that their inﬂu- ence is important for controlling yoy ﬁsh species richness, because our results seem not to support the passive sampling hypothesis. this hypothesis was likely in our study because the number of sampling points in each backwater varied according to its area. thus, we could suppose that a positive relationship between yoy ﬁsh species richness and backwater area (i.e., the variable surf) just occurred as a result of this variable sampling effort. in contrary, yoy ﬁsh species richness was adequately estimated even in the less sampled backwaters and we could discard the passive sampling hypothesis. obviously, in our study, colonisation and extinction are not considered in their strict sense, but rather as potential factors controlling how yoy ﬁsh species occur or not in particular sites. extinction processes (i.e., effects of the variable surf) almost always 151 tales & berrebi contribute to species richness (except for lsr), whereas colonisation processes (i.e., effects of the variables connec and dist) inﬂuence predomin- antly yoy species composition (psr and lsr). accordingly, taylor (1997) studying ﬁsh assemblage in isolated and connected pools in an oklahoma stream concluded that in connected pools, composition of ﬁsh assemblages differed depending on colonisation potential, whereas the number of coexisting species was determined by pool size. in contrast, eros & grossman (2005), in their study of ﬁsh species richness in hungarian streams, suggested that coloni- sation processes were more important in determining species richness in pools than were extinctions. indeed, they found that species richness in pools was inﬂuenced ﬁrst by their position in the longitudinal gradient and second by their volume. however, their study included only connected pools, located within the main channel. in addition, in our study, we could consider water surface area (i.e., the variable surf) as a measure of both extinction and colonisation. indeed, yoy ﬁsh species richness just reﬂects species richness of adult ﬁsh migrating into backwaters for spawning. if large backwaters are more attractive for spawning than small ones, a positive relationship between yoy ﬁsh species richness and backwaters size may be expected just as a result of a better colonisation of larger backwaters. nevertheless, probability of backwaters to be colonised by adult ﬁsh is more inﬂuenced by connectivity than backwaters size. this is why we assumed that backwaters size was not a relevant indicator of colonisation in our study. the fact that species richness seems to be extinction driven rather than colonisation driven may be general in insular environments. this result has been found in aquatic systems as well as terrestrial systems, and for various taxonomic groups (magnuson et al. 1998). additionally, in our study, the importance of extinction processes has at least two possible expla- nations. first, patchiness in the system studied results from a natural phenomenon (i.e., ﬂuvial dynamics) and hence, species have evolved in such a patchy system. they are used to coping with such a range of backwater isolation. secondly, our initial assumption that probability of backwater colonisation varied according to its size of connection with the main channel may be not relevant in this context, because all the studied backwaters are connected. results should be different if the range of backwater isolation was more contrasted. previous studies on ﬁsh assemblages in isolated wetlands from south carolina (snodgrass et al. 1996) and florida (baber et al. 2002) support the second explanation. in these wetlands, colonisation events following connec- tivity with a potential source of colonists determine 152 species occurrence, whereas there is no correlation between wetland size and species richness. in contrast, taylor (1997) found that the only predictor of species richness for isolated and connected pools in an oklahoma stream was the volume, which is an estimate of size. otherwise, in our study, local factors seem to be better predictors of local yoy ﬁsh species richness than landscape factors. indeed, tsr seems only to depend on either productivity of backwaters or extinction, which is a phenomenon resulting from local conditions. in contrast, richness of reproductive guilds reﬂects both local and landscape factors. in fact, the inﬂuence of the latter factors only arises when considering richness of reproductive guilds. therefore, it seems that at a coarse level, the connectivity of backwaters (i.e., relationships between backwaters and the adjacent riverscape) inﬂuences yoy ﬁsh assem- blage composition (i.e., relative contribution of differ- ent functional groups), whereas the overall number of coexisting species only varies as a function of local factors. this observation is consistent with the tendency of ﬁne scale factors to regulate persistence of local populations, whereas landscape level proces- ses control species occurrence (labbe & fausch 2000). in sum, our ﬁndings seem to support the importance of the energy hypothesis and colonisation–extinction dynamics in controlling local yoy ﬁsh species richness. in contrast, the habitat heterogeneity hypo- thesis appeared ineffective in our context. further- more, our study highlights the advantage of using functional diversity in addition to taxonomic diversity, as they have different responses with respect to the same ecological factors. notably, taking into account richness of reproductive guilds emphasised the relative role of local versus landscape factors. considering local and landscape factors together through such a multiscale analysis is a more comprehensive approach. although further studies are needed to conﬁrm our results, they may have practical implications for ﬁsh biodiversity management in the ﬂood plain water bodies with a conservation and rehabilitation objec- tive. in the seine river ﬂood plain, natural backwaters tend to be replaced by artiﬁcial backwaters such as sandpits or cut-off meanders (boe¨t et al. 1999). these newly excavated backwaters could be partly designed to offer suitable spawning habitats for ﬁsh species. until now, a great deal of research, focusing on the relationships between yoy ﬁsh and microhabitat characteristics, has practical local habitat design. our results, putting ﬁsh in a riverine landscape perspective, suggest is important: larger connected backwaters support great- er ﬁsh species richness. in addition, the particular response of reproductive guilds to landscape factors that mesohabitat implications for controls of local yoy ﬁsh species richness in ﬂood plain water bodies implies that their location and degree of connectivity are important to promote components of ﬁsh biodi- versity. however, our study is quite limited because we have not accounted for broad temporal dynamics, which is important for ﬁsh via ﬂow variability (taylor & warren 2001). a priori, studying yoy ﬁsh avoids the inﬂuence of interannual ﬂow variability, because they reﬂect short-term events. furthermore, habitat variability does not inﬂuence yoy ﬁsh species richness without data on the habitat state (merigoux et al. 1999). nevertheless, ﬂow variability may inﬂu- ence both size and connectivity of backwaters and potentially modify colonisation–extinction patterns as well as their own functioning. depending on water level, backwaters can likely be either isolated or connected some years. a complementary analysis would be to estimate effects of the permanency of these ﬂood plain water bodies on yoy ﬁsh species richness, which would require a broader temporal survey.
