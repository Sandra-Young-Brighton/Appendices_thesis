restricted-movement paradigm; salvelinus_fontinalis; oncorhynchus_tshawytscha; intentional species introductions introduction salmonids are among the most widely introduced aquatic vertebrates on earth (lomnicky et al. 2007; crawford & muir 2008). as a result, ecological impacts resulting from interactions between intro- duced salmonids and native species are widespread (simon & townsend 2003; korsu et al. 2008). native trout are among those species most strongly affected by introduced salmonids, with impacts including disease transmission, habitat displacement, reduced growth and survival, and modiﬁed behaviour (e.g., krueger & may 1991; crawford 2001). in the laurentian great lakes, chinook salmon (oncorhyn- chus tshawytscha walbaum), coho salmon (oncorhyn- chus kisutch walbaum) and rainbow (steelhead) trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss walbaum) have been stocked as a sport ﬁsh and for biological control of invasive alewife (alosa pseudoharengus wilson; crawford 2001), and today salmon are an integral part of the region’s $4 billion sport ﬁshery (stein et al. 2003). a number of studies in the great lakes have evaluated the effects of salmon introductions on lake- resident ﬁsh and the interactions between juvenile salmon and stream-resident ﬁsh (reviewed by craw- ford 2001), but comparatively little is known about the effects of spawning salmon on stream-resident ﬁsh. research in native ranges suggests that the effects of salmon spawners on resident ﬁsh may include energy provision from eggs (eastman 1996; foote & brown 1998) and physical displacement as salmon establish and aggressively defend spawning redds (quinn correspondence: d. j. janetski, 100 galvin life sciences center, university of notre dame, notre dame, in 46556, usa. e-mail: djanetsk@nd.edu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00479.x 209 janetski et al. 2005). while resident ﬁsh in native ranges have presumably evolved to beneﬁt from the resources supplied by salmon runs (e.g., foote & brown 1998), the response of resident ﬁsh to salmon spawners in the great lakes, where they have co-existed for only 50 years, remains unclear. brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis mitchill) are among the most widespread stream-resident ﬁsh in the great lakes basin and could be impacted by introduced salmon because of overlapping distribu- tions, habitat requirements, and spawning times (huckins et al. 2008). brook_trout are adapted to cold-water, low-order streams (behnke 2002), similar conditions to those preferred by spawning salmon (quinn 2005). furthermore, brook_trout are most active during fall spawning periods when discharge and water temperature vary (e.g., smith & saunders 1958; curry et al. 2002), which coincides temporally with salmon spawning. even during these active periods, typically <40% of the individuals within a trout population move more than 200 m (shetter 1968; gowan & fausch 1996; hilderbrand & kershner 2000; peterson & fausch 2003; but see schrank & rahel 2004), which has been referred to as the ‘mobile’ portion of the population (sensu hilderbrand & kershner 2000). since salmon spawn in great lakes tributaries at roughly the same time as brook_trout, salmon may alter normal mobility patterns during this critical period, which may have conse- quences for brook_trout behaviour, bioenergetics and population dynamics. our objective was to determine whether introduced salmon spawners inﬂuence the distance and direction of movements by resident brook_trout in a great lakes tributary. we examined temporal patterns in the frequency and rate of brook_trout movements in relation to brook_trout size and presence of salmon spawners. we predicted that (i) brook_trout would be more mobile when salmon spawners were present compared to brook_trout in a nonsalmon stream over the same time period, (ii) brook_trout movements would increase during periods of declining temper- ature and variable discharge regardless of salmon presence, and (iii) movement patterns would be similar for all sizes of brook_trout. finally, we estimated the net bioenergetic impact of salmon on brook_trout from the energetic cost of measured movements and the energy acquired from consuming salmon eggs. methods study area we conducted our study in the manistee river watershed, which is located in the northern lower peninsula of michigan, usa. brook_trout movements were monitored in pine creek (44.209311°n, 85.986672°w) and peterson creek (44.227128°n, 85.755672°w), two second-order tributaries of the manistee river with similar hydrological and geo- morphological conditions (fig. 1, table 1). pine creek receives a fall run of chinook salmon from late september through october, whereas peterson creek does not receive salmon because migration is blocked by a dam on the main stem of the manistee river (see fig. 1). both study streams have resident populations of brook_trout, mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi girard) 210 fig. 1. map of study locations: pine creek (with salmon) and peterson creek (no sal- mon), mi, usa. salmon spawner effects on brook_trout movement table 1. hydrological and geomorphological characteristics of pine creek and peterson creek, michigan. stream pine peterson drainage area (km2) 124.6 145.4 elevation (m) 227 290 channel width (m) water temperature (°c) 6.0 2.7 2.4–13.9 1.4–11.2 discharge )1) (m3æs 0.14–0.64 0.04–0.25 sediment size (cm) salmon biomass (kgæm )2) 4.6 2.1 0.34 0 values are means except for when a range is given. temperature ranges are monthly average minima and maxima. and blacknose dace (rhinichthys atratulus hermann). pine creek also has a resident population of rainbow trout, and peterson creek contains brown_trout (salmo_trutta linnaeus). study design and equipment we used passive integrative transponder (pit) readers to track the distance and direction of brook_trout movements in pine creek, the stream with salmon, and peterson creek, the stream lacking salmon (cf. kus- nierz et al. 2009; pratt et al. 2009). movements were monitored from september 5 to november 23, 2009, which included periods before, during and after the salmon run. in each stream, an 800-m reach was delineated into three subreaches: upper (300 m in length), middle (200 m) and lower (300 m) (fig. 2). middle reaches were ﬂanked by paired antennas for a total of four antennas per stream. the 200-m distance between antenna pairs is the maximum impedance allowed for accurate performance by the readers. each antenna consisted of copper wire (10awg multi- strand) connected to a remote antenna tuner box. at each stream, antennas were wired to a stationary reader (high performance lf hdx radio-frequency identiﬁcation [rfid] reader) using twinaxial cable (9207 beldenô) as recommended (warren leech, personal communication; oregon rfidò, portland, or, usa). readers were powered by grid power at (sharpô, pine creek and a 123-w solar panel memphis, tn, usa) at peterson creek. in july 2009, brook_trout were collected by single- pass electroﬁshing in the 800-m reach of each stream, and each individual >10 cm in length was implanted with a uniquely coded read ⁄ write tag (23 mm hdx rfid tag; oregon rfidò). tags were surgically inserted into the abdominal cavity immediately pos- terior to the pectoral ﬁns (prentice et al. 1990). retention rates for abdominal cavity tag insertions are generally 70–95% (carlson et al. 2004; dieterman & hoxmeier 2009). a total of 59 brook_trout were tagged in pine creek (lower subreach n = 34, middle n = 12, upper n = 13; mean length 19.2 cm, range 14.9–28.6 cm; see appendix s1) and 30 in peterson creek (lower n = 11, middle n = 7, upper n = 12; mean length 17.2 cm, range 13.3–22.9 cm). the weight (±0.1 g) and total length (±0.1 cm) of each tagged ﬁsh was also recorded. distance and direction of brook_trout movements we tracked the distance and direction of brook_trout movements in both study streams before, during and after the salmon run. distance travelled was divided into two categories: movements >200 m, termed ‘longer’ movements, and movements <200 m, termed ‘shorter’ movements (cf. similar designations by hilderbrand & kershner 2000; peterson & fausch 2003). longer movements were counted when a tagged ﬁsh moved through all four antennas within a 48-h period. shorter movements were counted any time a ﬁsh moved through two adjacent antennas in succession but not the second pair (see fig. 2). the direction of movements was determined by the timing of reads through each antenna. for example, passage from antenna d to antenna a would be tallied as a longer upstream movement, whereas movement from d to c or b to a is a shorter upstream movement (fig. 2). fig. 2. relative placement of passive integrative transponder tag reader and antennas for monitoring movements of stream-resident brook_trout. movement from antenna d to a was considered a longer movement (>200 m); movement from d to c or b to a was considered a shorter movement (<200 m). distance of movements we estimated the percentage of tagged brook_trout moving a long distance (t) each day (n) by summing the proportion of longer upstream movements (u) 211 janetski et al. longer downstream movements (dn) from the lower subreach (w) with the proportion of from the upper subreach (z), calculated separately for each stream: tn ¼ un nw;n þ dn nz;n  100 ð1þ   where n represents the total number of tagged brook_trout for a given stream. we summed percentages because longer movements detected in either subreach were assumed to be representative of all tagged ﬁsh. to illustrate, suppose that 5 of 33, or 12%, of the brook_trout in the lower subreach moved a longer distance upstream on a given day. as longer upstream movements occurring from the middle and upper subreaches are undetectable because they are not registered by both antenna pairs, we assumed that this 12% movement from the lower subreach was repre- sentative of the entire reach. after we similarly estimated the percentage of longer downstream move- ments, the sum of the upstream and downstream percentages yielded an estimate for the entire reach on a given day. prior to each daily calculation, we updated the distribution of tagged brook_trout among the three subreaches to reﬂect previous movements and provide up-to-the-day totals in each reach. to compare shorter and longer movements between the two study sites, we tallied the number of brook_trout registering a movement and the number of brook_trout not registering a movement for each week for each stream, resulting in a 2 · 2 matrix (i.e., move, no move · pine, peterson) for each of the 11 weeks of the study (week 11 consisted of 10 days rather than 7). weekly totals, as opposed to monthly or daily totals, were used to provide sensitive temporal resolution without severely altering the power of the test, such as by inﬂating a. to test for differences in brook_trout movements between the salmon and nonsalmon stream, we analysed each 2 · 2 matrix using the fisher exact test (bonferroni corrected a = 0.00417; zar 2009). longer movements were analysed sepa- rately from the shorter movements. direction of movements to compare the direction of longer brook_trout movements between streams, we calculated the cumu- lative proportion of tagged brook_trout (m) moving upstream (u) or downstream (d) for each day (n) in each stream (y): mn;y ¼ x¼1 ux   dx ny ð2þ p n where x represents all days prior to day n. thus, positive m indicates net upstream movements and 212 negative m indicates net downstream movements. we tested for differences in the slope of regression lines generated from plots of m versus x for each stream using student’s t-test (a = 0.05; zar 2009). assessment of potential drivers of brook_trout movements salmon abundance salmon spawner abundance was estimated from weekly to biweekly counts of live salmon within three 100-m demarcated subreaches in pine creek (cf. chaloner et al. 2007; lrboi 2009). daily spawner abundance on nonsurveyed dates was approximated by interpolation assuming a linear relationship be- tween consecutive count dates. pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (a = 0.05; zar 2009) was used to assess the association between salmon abundance and the pro- portion of brook_trout moving each day. stream discharge and temperature in addition to salmon abundance, we examined stream discharge and temperature as potential explanatory variables of brook_trout movements. in pine creek, stage height was measured every 30 min using an odyssey water capacitance meter (dataﬂow systems, inc., christchurch, new zealand). stream discharge was measured twice each month in both study streams with a marsh-mcbirney flo-mate ﬂow meter (hach company, loveland, co, usa) using the midsection method (gore 2006). water temperature was contin- uously monitored in both streams using hoboò water temp pro v2 data loggers (onset computer corporation, bourne, ma, usa). pearson’s correla- tion coefﬁcient (a = 0.05) was used to assess the association between mean daily discharge, mean daily temperature and the proportion of brook_trout moving each day. diel and seasonal movements we used several approaches to examine temporal patterns in the frequency and rate of movements and the relationship of these patterns to brook_trout size. for diel movements, movement frequency refers to the number of longer movements per hour over the course of the study. movements were summed for each hour of the 24-h daily cycle (i.e., 0000–0059, 0100–0159, etc.), and the time of day of each movement was deﬁned as day or night based on the average sunrise (0800) and sunset (1900) times during the study period. for seasonal movements, each longer move- ment was converted to the time, in minutes, that each movement occurred since the start of the study, referred to as ‘date’. movement rate was deﬁned as the time taken to travel 200 m; i.e., the difference in minutes between passage through each antenna pair. we used analysis-of-variance (anova, a = 0.05; zar 2009) to determine (i) the response of brook_trout longer movements for each hour of the 24-h cycle to stream (pine and peterson) and time of day (day and night) and (ii) the response of movement rate to date (in min), brook_trout length, and salmon abundance. pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (a = 0.05) was used to assess the association between brook_trout size (length) and the number of longer movements accrued for each individual through the duration of the study. we tested each dataset for normality and equal variance using shapiro–wilk tests and residual plots and used appropriate transformations when necessary. all statistical analyses were conducted using r v2.8.0 (crawley 2007). energetic costs to estimate the bioenergetic inﬂuence of salmon on brook_trout, we applied energy conversion values from previous studies (e.g., brett 1995; meka & margraf 2007; garner et al. 2009) to our data and calculated energy budgets under different scenarios of energy acquisition and expenditure. energy acquisition was assumed to be predominantly in the form of salmon eggs (as opposed to salmon ﬂesh), and energy expenditure was assumed to be mainly from displace- ment into faster water and movement upstream and downstream (cf. garner et al. 2009). salmon spawner effects on brook_trout movement stream lacking salmon. without adjustment using eq. (1), we directly observed that 64% of all tagged brook_trout in pine creek (the stream with salmon) moved a long distance at least once during the study compared to 30% in peterson creek (no salmon; fisher exact test, p < 0.01). the difference between the two streams was driven by the period september 19–25 (week 3), the week that salmon arrived, when a substantially higher proportion of brook_trout moved more than 200 m in pine creek (42%, 25 of 59) than in peterson creek (0%; fisher exact test, p < 0.0001; fig. 3a). when we include approximations of unde- tectable movements (per eq. 1), we estimate that 52% of the tagged brook_trout in pine creek made a long- distance move during september 19–25. longer movements increased dramatically in pine creek on september 23, the day salmon arrived, but after 72 h returned to movement frequencies similar to peterson creek. of the 25 brook_trout that moved a long distance in pine creek between september 23–25, 15 (60%) did not register a longer movement at any other time during the course of the study. in fact, when movements occurring on september 23–25 are excluded from the pine creek dataset, the total percentage of brook_trout that moved a long distance drops to 39% and does not differ statistically from test, p = 0.10), peterson creek (30%; fisher exact suggesting that brook_trout movements differed between streams only during this 3-day period. scenarios varied by egg consumption and water velocity. egg consumption levels were 0, 1.7, 3 and 4.5 g, and water velocities varied between 0 and )1. egg consumption levels were set a poste- 0.5 mæs riori based on the mean (1.7 g) and maximum egg consumption (4.5 g) observed by brook_trout. for each of these scenarios, we assumed that salmon eggs had )1 with 30% lost to an energy content of 18.7 kjæg faeces (brett 1995; meka & margraf 2007; cf. garner et al. 2009), that the energy consumed by brook_trout for movement was 4.98 kjækg (based on values for age-1 sockeye salmon [brett 1995]), and that brook_trout weigh 127 g (based on average weight of tagged ﬁsh from pine creek). we used gastric lavage to estimate the amount of salmon eggs consumed by brook_trout (sweka et al. 2004). brook (n = 11) were captured during the salmon_trout spawning run by electroshocking and the stomach contents removed and weighed (±0.01 g). )1ækm )1 results distance and direction of brook_trout movements distance of movements the number of brook_trout travelling longer distances was higher in the stream containing salmon than in the over all time periods, the frequency of shorter movements did not differ between the two study test, p > 0.01, a = 0.00417; streams (fisher exact fig. 3b). overall, 10% and 23% of the tagged ﬁsh in pine and peterson creeks, respectively, moved exclu- sively short distances (i.e., did not register a longer movement), and 25% and 47% were not read, indicating that these individuals either exhibited site ﬁdelity or expelled their tags. direction of movements the direction of brook_trout movements also differed between streams. in the 24 h following the arrival of salmon, 89% (16 of 18) of the longer brook_trout movements in pine creek were upstream. addition- ally, within 48 h after the arrival of salmon, 59% (20 of 34) of the brook_trout from the lower subreach in pine creek moved at least 200 m upstream (fig. 4), although 30% (6 of 20) of those moved back downstream within 48 h. by the end of the study, 50% (17 of 34) of the brook_trout from the pine creek lower subreach had moved upstream of the upper antenna pair, compared to 9% (1 of 11) in peterson creek. the pulse of brook_trout movements imme- diately after the arrival of salmon was reﬂected in the slope of the regression line for pine creek, which differed from the slope of the peterson creek regression 213 janetski et al.

black) and peterson creek (no salmon; grey). positive values indicate upstream movements, and negative values indicate downstream movements. 214 seven of these moves took <20 min. second, we found evidence that individual ﬁsh can be highly habitual. for example, for 11 consecutive days, one individual in peterson creek arrived to the same location (the antenna) at roughly the same time each day (between 2023 and 2059), remained near the antenna throughout the night while taking one to four short (10 min to 3 h) ventures upstream and then moved back downstream at roughly the same time before dawn (between 0552 and 0709). drivers of brook_trout movements salmon abundance the arrival of spawning salmon occurred on september 22–23 (fig. 3c), coincident with the ﬁrst high discharge event observed during the study (fig. 3d). salmon abundance was highest on october 10, when 110 individuals were counted, equivalent to approximately )2 1 salmon per 3 m of stream length or 0.34 kgæm (average salmon size was 4.2 kg). no live salmon were seen in the stream on november 15, and based on the trend of previous observations, we estimate that the end of the salmon run was october 30. in pine creek, brook_trout movements were correlated with salmon abun- dance (r = 0.42, d.f. = 78, p < 0.001), although when considering only data recorded during the salmon run movements were not correlated with salmon abundance (r = 0.16, d.f. = 36, p = 0.34), suggesting that the signiﬁcant correlation is driven by zero values. stream discharge and temperature overall patterns in discharge and temperature were similar in both streams. seven high discharge events occurred over the course of the study, while at both sites, stream water temperatures decreased progres- sively by 4–6 °c with the onset of fall (fig. 3d,e). periodic discharge measurements in peterson creek were strongly correlated with discharge estimates for pine creek (r = 0.96, d.f. = 3, p = 0.01), suggesting that discharge patterns were similar between the two sites. daily mean temperatures (°c) in pine creek ranged from 12.0 to 18.1 in september, 7.3 to 12.1 in october and 5.6 to 10.3 in november (fig. 3e). in peterson creek, mean daily temperatures (°c) ranged from 9.8 to 13.6 in september, 6.5 to 12.1 in october and 5.6 to 9.5 in november. daily trout movements in pine creek and peterson creek were not strongly correlated with mean daily discharge (pine: r = 0.21, d.f. = 78, p = 0.06; peterson: r = 0.19, d.f. = 74, p = 0.10, pearson’s correlation). in peterson creek, brook_trout tended to move more frequently at lower temperatures (r = )0.30, d.f. = 74, p = 0.008), but no relationship was observed in pine creek (r = 0.10, d.f. = 78, p = 0.40). salmon spawner effects on brook_trout movement fig. 5. predicted relationships between net energy gain (positive y-axis values) or loss (negative values, in grey shade) and water velocity under varying levels of egg consumption (at right above lines) by brook_trout. the maximum per capita egg consumption observed in pine creek was 4.5 g, and the maximum water velocity was 0.44 mæs )1. day than night )1, xnight = 6.9 movesæh diel and seasonal movements diel patterns in brook_trout movements were detected in both streams. brook_trout moved longer distances more often at night than during the day in pine )1, creek (xday = 0.8 movesæh stream*time: f1,44 = 34.6, p < 0.0001;

(xday = 4.1 movesæh movement rate did not differ between night and day (f1,89 = 1.7, p = 0.19) or between upstream and downstream directions (f1,89 = 0.2, p = 0.69), and no relationship was detected between movement rate (r = )0.09, d.f. = 32, p = and salmon biomass 0.59). however, brook_trout tended to move faster in peterson creek than in pine creek (xpine = 8.6 h, xpeterson = 4.9 h; f1,89 = 13.1, p < 0.001), with 55% of longer moves taking <1 h and 81% taking <6 h in peterson creek, compared to 33% <1 h and 64% <6 h in pine creek. we note that in peterson creek, 74% of moves occurring in <6 h were attributed to two individual brook_trout. the fastest long-distance move was 7.5 min and occurred in peterson creek. weak seasonal patterns were detected for some aspects of brook_trout movement. in pine creek, larger (r = )0.21, brook_trout tended to move faster 215 janetski et al. in the and earlier d.f. = 82, p = 0.05) season (r = )0.23, d.f. = 82, p = 0.03) than smaller brook_trout. also, brook_trout moved more slowly later in the season than early in the season (r = 0.22, d.f. = 85, p = 0.04). no relationship was detected between brook_trout size and total number of longer movements per individual (r = 0.02, d.f. = 41, p = 0.88). energetic costs under most scenarios of movement and diet, we found that bioenergetic effects on brook_trout by spawning salmon result in a net beneﬁt in terms of energy; only under scenarios of low egg consumption and displace- ment into very fast water do brook_trout experience net energy losses (fig. 5). in terms of absolute swimming distance, an average-sized brook_trout would require 0.13 kj (equivalent to 0.01 g salmon eggs) of energy to )1. however, move 200 m at a water velocity of 0 mæs because the average water velocity in pine creek was 0.2 mæs took 83 min, a brook_trout would actually require 0.76 kj (0.06 g salmon eggs) of energy to move 200 m upstream. over a 24-h period, an average-sized brook_trout consuming an average amount of salmon material (1.7 g) would experience a net energy gain provided )1 they hold in water with a velocity less than 0.4 mæs greater than their original holding position. thus, given our observations for egg consumption and water )1), scenarios where brook velocity (maximum 0.44 mæs trout lose energy during the salmon run are unlikely. )1 and an average longer movement discussion distance and direction of brook_trout movements our results suggest that interactions with non-native salmonids can strongly inﬂuence the distance and direction of resident trout movement. because physical conditions were similar in both streams throughout our study, the stark contrast in brook_trout movements at the start of the salmon run suggests that salmon, rather than climatic or hydrological forces, triggered brook_trout movement. previous studies also support the conclu- sion that the pulse of brook_trout movements that we observed was an atypical occurrence. salmonids often move downstream to overwinter and upstream in preparation for spawning (e.g., chapman & bjornn 1969; chisholm et al. 1987), although some have reported roughly equal frequencies of upstream and downstream movements (e.g., gresswell & hendricks 2007). such movements, however, typically occur during periods of climatic or hydrologic variability. in our study, as the brook_trout movement pulse was before the decline in summer temperatures leading 216 towards spawning time, the upstream migration appears to have been triggered by salmon. the triggering of trout movements by non-native salmon has relevance to the ‘restricted-movement paradigm’. this paradigm states that stream-resident salmonids are generally sedentary (gerking 1959; gowan et al. 1994), but evidence suggests that trout can be more mobile than previously thought (gowan & fausch 1996). if brook_trout that moved >200 m are considered ‘mobile’ (cf. hilderbrand & kershner 2000), then, after adjusting for tag retention rate, we estimate that 66–73% of the brook_trout tagged in our salmon stream were mobile during the late-summer ⁄ fall period. these results suggest high mobility in trout that can be further increased by interactions with non-native species. we note, however, that while many brook_trout were active at some point during the study, the vast majority of mobile individuals moved a long distance three or less times during the study (86% for pine creek and 87% for peterson creek), suggesting that most trout were usually sedentary (appendix s1). finally, our results suggest that failure to consider the inﬂuence of non-native species, such as spawning salmon, may result in underestimates of trout movements. drivers of brook_trout movement salmon spawning and temperature appeared to strongly inﬂuence brook_trout movements in our study streams. we attribute the pulse in brook_trout move- ment in pine creek (with salmon) to salmon rather than discharge or temperature because a corresponding movement pulse was not observed in nearby peterson creek (no salmon). thus, our initial prediction that spawning salmon would increase brook_trout move- ments over the full duration of the run was only partially correct; instead, salmon appear to stimulate brook_trout movement for 3–4 days. after this initial perturbation, brook_trout appear to quickly adjust to the presence of salmon. brook_trout in both streams moved more often in october, when water temperature was optimal for spawning (7–11 °c; hokanson et al. 1973). our ﬁndings are consistent with a number of previous studies, where changes in water temperature have been linked to increased movement and spawning in anadromous brook_trout and inland cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus_clarkii richardson) (smith & saun- ders 1958; gresswell & hendricks 2007). our failure to detect a relationship between discharge and move- ment, however, contrasts with previous studies (e.g., smith & saunders 1958; gowan & fausch 1996), but may be an artifact of the short duration of our study. if conducted over a longer time frame (cf. smith & saunders 1958; gresswell & hendricks 2007), seasonal differences in movements driven by dis- charge may have become apparent. interspeciﬁc salmonid interactions in the great lakes salmon effects on brook_trout life history, such as the distance and direction of movements, may have implications for habitat enhancement and species conservation (cf. gowan et al. 1994). for example, the potential impacts of invasive species on upstream communities are considered an important trade-off in dam removal (stanley & doyle 2003), an issue that may be relevant to great lakes tributaries with healthy brook_trout populations upstream of dams. in cases where salmon impacts are undesirable, dams could be left in place to preserve the integrity of upstream communities (cf. fausch et al. 2009). another perhaps less intrusive option than leaving dams in place is to prevent upstream salmon migration using selective barriers, based on salmon size or swimming ability, which would maintain some degree of stream con- nectivity (cf. pratt et al. 2009). whatever the manage- ment strategy, our results provide information that may help preserve sensitive brook_trout populations from potentially undesired salmon impacts. our study builds upon previous ﬁsheries research by providing the ﬁrst examination of interactions between brook_trout and paciﬁc salmon spawners. previous studies show that non-native brook_trout can compete for food and space with native trout (nakano et al. 1998; dunham et al. 2002) and displace native juvenile chinook salmon (macneale et al. 2010). in native ranges, brook_trout compete with non-native juvenile coho salmon for feeding positions (fausch & white 1981, 1986). our results suggest that brook_trout also compete for habitat with adult salmon introduced to the great lakes. furthermore, brook_trout movements increased at the start of the salmon run before eggs were present in the stream, suggesting that movements were driven by interference compe- tition for holding positions and not by egg consump- tion (cf. hasegawa & maekawa 2006). displacement by salmon, however, may not adversely affect brook_trout energy stores, as our bioenergetics model predicts that energy lost to movement is very likely regained by subsequent egg consumption. our results suggest that introduced paciﬁc salmon may have broader effects on stream-resident ﬁsh than has previously been acknowledged. for example, little is known about the impacts of paciﬁc salmon on resident ﬁsh in new zealand, where salmon were introduced in the early 1900s (quinn et al. 2001), and in chile and argentina, where salmon have been present since the 1980s (becker et al. 2007). in locations such as these where introduced salmon co-exist with native ﬁsh, further study into their effects salmon spawner effects on brook_trout movement may be warranted. given the broad geographic distribution of paciﬁc salmon outside of their native range (crawford & muir 2008), effects on stream- resident ﬁsh may be a signiﬁcant component of the overall ecological imprint of salmon introductions. acknowledgements marty holtgren, stephanie ogren, chris eilers, and grant poole of the little river band of ottawa indians assisted with data collection and
