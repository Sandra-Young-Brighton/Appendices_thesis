(1996) found that size, rather than age, was strongly related to migration date of sea_trout (salmo_trutta). at the tem- poral scale of hours, size and energetic status may also influence whether individuals are nocturnal in daily activity and seasonal migratory behaviour (metcalfe et al. 1998; ibbotson et al. 2011). collectively, these studies suggest that physiological differences among individuals mediate the relative costs and benefits of behavioural trade-offs related to migratory timing. in arctic freshwater fish species, migrations gener- ally include seasonally occurring movements from overwintering areas to shallow foraging and spawning areas (craig & poulin 1975; west et al. 1992). at correspondence: kurt c. heim, alaska cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, school of fisheries and ocean sciences, university of alaska fairbanks, fairbanks, ak 99775, usa. e-mail: kurtcheim@gmail.com 156 doi: 10.1111/eff.12199 northern latitudes, overwintering habitats must be deep or spring fed to provide adequate unfrozen water, whereas summer habitats must provide ample food in order to replenish energy reserves before the often- extensive (up to 9 month) overwintering period (buz- by & deegan 2000). in some cases, growth may only occur for 3 months during the short arctic summer when spring spawning adult fish must also acquire energy necessary for overwinter gonadogenesis (arm- strong 1986; buzby & deegan 2000). as a result of these strong selective pressures, many populations have developed locally adapted migratory strategies to coordinate migration timing and habitat use with sea- sonal conditions in order to maximise growth, while minimising exposure to predation and likelihood of getting stranded in unsuitable overwintering habitat. arctic grayling (thymallus_arcticus) are a wide- spread and abundant migratory freshwater fish occur- ring throughout the n. american and eurasian arctic and subarctic (scott & crossman 1973). due to their importance as a sport fish, there has been a consider- able effort to understand their general ecology and migration patterns (tack 1980; northcote 1995). arctic grayling move among spawning, foraging and overwin- tering habitats as seasonal conditions change (craig & poulin 1975; west et al. 1992; northcote 1995) with many individuals showing interannual fidelity to spe- cific summer foraging locations (buzby & deegan 2000). in many watersheds, such as those along the arctic coastal plain of alaska, overwintering areas are few in number and can severely limit the distribution of fish during winter (craig 1989), as nearly all bodies of water <1.5 m deep freeze solid by the end of winter (jones et al. 2009). this restricts the use of productive shallow-water habitats to the short summer, and timing migration out of such habitats is critical to avoid becoming stranded in unsuitable winter habitat (tack 1980). however, even within suitable overwintering areas, overwintering is generally considered the most critical period for northern populations of arctic gray- ling due to predation and accidental overwintering star- vation (reynolds 1997). in the kuparuk river in the foothills of the brooks range of northern alaska, mean annual survival rate of adult arctic grayling averaged 0.75  0.05 (range 0.39–1.0) over 17 years; however, estimates are not available for juveniles (buzby & dee- gan 2004). juvenile survival is likely considerably lower, as it is generally established that overwintering mortality rates are higher for juvenile salmonids (quinn & peterson 1996; sogard 1997; biro et al. 2004). recent research indicates that low-order beaded stream habitats are used extensively by arctic gray- ling during the short arctic summer, although the ecology of this stream type is poorly understood. beaded streams are characterised by regularly spaced elliptical pools connected by narrow channel runs, variability in arctic grayling migration appearing as ‘beads-on-a-string’ (oswood et al. 1989; arp et al. 2014), and are a dominant stream morphol- ogy across alaska’s arctic coastal plain (arp et al. 2012). beaded streams offer good foraging opportuni- ties during the summer (hemming 1996) and gener- ally lack large piscivorous fishes. however, with the exception of deep pools or ‘beads’, shallow reaches of beaded streams freeze completely during winter (jones et al. 2013). furthermore, despite the persis- tence of some liquid water through winter, these habi- tats often become anoxic towards late winter (lilly et al. 2010) and are generally not believed to support overwintering salmonids. thus, prolonged use of these habitats into autumn as water temperatures approach freezing is a substantial risk, although they may provide additional time for growth and accumu- lation of energy necessary to endure the winter. the goal of this study was to gain a better under- standing of the factors influencing individual variabil- ity in migration timing towards overwintering habitats from summer foraging grounds in an arctic beaded stream. specifically, our primary objective was to (i) determine whether there is a relationship between refuge migration timing of individual juve- nile arctic grayling out of crea creek and fork length (fl) and body condition index (bci), a proxy for growth and lipid reserves (pope & kruse 2007). given that higher lipid content and larger body size at the onset of winter have been shown to positively influence survival of other salmonids (quinn & peter- son 1996; biro et al. 2004), we predicted that large fish will migrate earlier than smaller fish and fish in good condition relative to conspecifics will migrate earlier than those in poor condition. our predictions are based on the premise that smaller fish in poor condition will accept greater risks (i.e. later migration timing) than fish that have already accumulated energy reserves for winter or are physiologically less susceptible to overwintering mortality. secondary objectives were to (ii) examine seasonal trends in body condition and (iii) estimate growth of juvenile fish within crea creek, in order to better understand the seasonality of winter starvation and mass accumu- lation related to our hypotheses. in addition to testing these hypotheses in a relatively pristine aquatic envi- ronment, we begin to build a better understanding of the ecology of this stream type, which is at potential risk to anthropogenic impacts of petroleum develop- ment and climate change. methods study area this study was conducted in crea creek (70°17 151°20 n, tributary in the fish creek w), a small 0 0 157 heim et al. watershed, which is approximately 20 km west of the colville river delta in alaska’s arctic coastal plain (figure 1). crea creek is a beaded stream that initiates from a headwater lake and flows 4.5 km through three other lakes before reaching the ub- lutuoch river, an important overwintering area and migratory corridor for arctic grayling, broad white- fish (coregonus_nasus) and burbot (lota lota) (morris 2003). the creek generally flows from june through september and freezes completely during winter except in deep ‘beads’ and two lakes that are approximately 2.5 m deep (jones et al. 2013). the stream does not constitute quality as such, overwintering habitat to salmonids, and review of 2 years of movement data collected by k. heim does not show any evidence of arctic grayling suc- cessfully overwintering within the stream. the stream provides excellent foraging opportunities from june to september, with both adults and juve- niles relying heavily on the small-bodied ninespine stickleback (pungitius pungitius), as well as various aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (j. mcfarland, university of alaska fairbanks, unpublished data). arctic grayling migrate out of the stream before ice formation blocks access to overwintering areas in the ublutuoch river and elsewhere within the fish creek watershed. fish sampling and tagging fish were captured within crea creek from june to august in 2012 and 2013 using fyke nets as our pri- mary sampling method. additional fish were captured within crea creek via opportunistic angling with fly-fishing gear and three single-pass electrofishing surveys in collaboration with an ongoing food web study during 2012. in this analysis, we used only arctic grayling 120–280 mm fl, a size at which most arctic grayling in the area are still immature, although females generally tend to mature at a smal- ler size than males (l. moulton, personal communi- cation). mature adults were excluded from analysis because length–mass-based measurements of body condition are confounded by sex and allocation of fig. 1. location of the crea creek drainage in northern alaska (inset) to the confluence of the ublutuoch river, a deep overwintering area for arctic grayling. also shown are the locations of the two passive integrated transponder (pit) antenna stations used to monitor migration timing. dashed lines between lakes indicate seasonal connections and the solid lines indicate permanent connections during the open-water season. 158 body weight during spawning periods (morgan 2004). because mature arctic grayling within and nearby crea creek spawn in june, and most migrate out of our study area by mid july, there would be little time to capture unbiased bci measurements prior to the peak of migration. tags (pit) arctic grayling were anaesthetised in a clove oil solution, measured to the nearest mm in fl and weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram. arctic grayling 120 mm through 179 mm were tagged with 12-mm (0.1 g) half-duplex passive integrated transponder (oregon rfid, portland, or, usa), and those ≥180 mm through 280 mm were tagged with 23-mm (0.6 g) half-duplex pit tags to ensure tag/body mass ratio did not exceed 2% (winter 1996). once a fish became unrespon- sive, a small incision was made and a tag was inserted into the body cavity with a syringe. after handling, fish were released into slow water near the sampling location to recover. in total, 1052 fish were captured within this size range and 781 were pit tagged. body condition index we used residuals from a length–mass regression as a bci (pope & kruse 2007; bentley & schindler 2013). we used ordinary least squares regression to estimate parameters a and b, using the linear length– mass equation, loge ðwiþ ¼ a þ b  loge ðliþ; where wi is the weight of an individual (g) and li is the fl of an individual (mm). this process results in a bci for each fish where positive and negative val- ues indicate a fish is heavier or lighter relative to oth- ers at this allows for comparison of relative weight among individuals of different lengths, as residual values are independent of fish length (bentley & schindler 2013). length. furthermore, that to identify seasonal trends in bci, we first fit a length–mass regression using all 1052 fish captured between 120 and 280 mm to estimate a and b. we then plotted the bci values, as calculated from this pooled regression, against month and year of cap- ture. differences in monthly mean bci values within years were determined using one-way anova and tukey’s post hoc hsd test (zar 1999). because seasonal and annual trends were clearly evident (figure 2), we subset fish into six groups (by year and month captured) and refit length–mass regressions separately to estimate six sets of param- eters a and b and reassigned bci values (table 1). this separation was needed due to the strong sea- sonal if we used bci values trends; for example, variability in arctic grayling migration (a) (b) fig. 2. log transformed length mass regression for arctic gray- ling using all 1052 fish between 120 and 280 mm captured during this study (a), and the resulting distributions of body condition index values separated by month and year of capture (b). fish in poor condition have negative bci values; fish in good condition have positive bci values. the boxes display quartile 1–3, and whiskers display maximum and minimum. table 1. regression coefficients loge(weight) regressed on loge(length) using subsets of fish caught during different time periods, and all fish captured during this study. and sample sizes for subset jun 2012 jul 2012 aug 2012 jun 2013 jul 2013 aug 2013 all n 192 296 71 231 166 96 1052 a (intercept) b (slope)  13.13  11.63  13.53  12.89  12.16  12.85  12.34 3.29 3.04 3.41 3.25 3.14 3.27 3.16 r2 0.97 0.98 0.98 1.00 0.99 0.98 0.97 generated from the pooled regression (figure 2) to predict migration timing, nearly all fish tagged in june would be assigned low bci values. as we were interested in the condition of fish relative to conspecifics during the time period prior to migra- tion, interval specific bci values (as generated by regressions presented in table 1) are more appropri- ate to test our hypotheses. 159 heim et al. growth although not a primary objective of this study, we were interested in estimating individual growth rates over the summers of 2012 and 2013 to make general predictions on the potential for mass accumulation during late summer. specifically, we were interested in quantifying the potential mass gain if fish extended residency within crea creek (late migration). we cal- culated absolute (expressed as g per day) and instan- taneous (expressed as the change in natural logarithm of weight per day) growth rates (hopkins 1992) for all fish recaptured during the same year it was tagged within the 2-year study period. migration timing we used two stream-width swim-through pit tag antenna stations to determine migration timing out of crea creek (figure 1). these consisted of an antenna loop with the bottom anchored to the substrate and the top suspended above water level, connected to a solar-powered data logging system (oregon rfid) that recorded the date, time and id of fish as they passed through an antenna. antenna station #1 was located 500 m upstream in crea creek from its con- fluence with the ublutuoch river, and station #2 was located in crea creek at the confluence with the ublutuoch river. data logging timekeepers were syn- chronised to the nearest second, allowing for the direction of fish movement to be determined from the sequence of detections. antennae were in operation nearly continuously during the summers of 2012 and 2013. both antennae encompassed the entire stream width during peak periods of downstream migration and proved to be highly efficient (98–99%) according to detection efficiency calculations similar to those presented by zydlewski et al. (2001) (heim et al., in review). we defined a migratory movement as an individual fish’s final movement from antenna station #1 to antenna station #2 in the year it was tagged (a move- ment out of crea creek, figure 1). as some fish exited and entered the stream several times, or made several movements across antenna station #2, we used this specific sequence to isolate migratory movements from diel or random movements. thus, each fish was only assigned a single migration date. fish not detected moving across antennae in this sequence were not included in analysis, which could indicate that fish (i) did not migrate out of the system (ii) died during the summer or (iii) lost its pit tag. in 2013, many fish tagged in 2012 returned to the stream (i.e. showed interannual site fidelity to crea creek, n = 156); however, we excluded these fish from the migration models in 2013 because the 160 length and weight information for these individuals collected in 2012 is not representative of their condi- tion in 2013. furthermore, fish that migrated <7 days after being tagged were not used to remove fish that may have potentially migrated out of the stream in response to the stress of capture, handling and tag- ging. of the 781 tagged fish over the 2-year study, we assigned migration dates to 297 based on the above criteria. data analysis the distribution of migration dates for fish tagged in june displayed a binomial distribution; we therefore used logistic regression to determine whether a binary migratory response (early migrant or late migrant) was related to fl or bci for fish tagged in june. early migrants were defined as those that migrated before august 15 and late migrants those that migrated after august 15. although not of interest to test hypotheses, year (2012 or 2013) and tagging date (julian date) were also included as predictors in the model to control for the additional variability generated by annual trends or those related to tagging date. the distribution of migration dates for fish tagged in june and july was conducive to a linear model; we therefore used multiple linear regression to predict migration date (julian date) with bci, fl, year and tagging date for fish tagged in july and august in two separate models. in logistic and linear regressions, all continuous predictor variables were centred and standardised (divided by two standard deviations), resulting in coefficient estimates that were interpreted as standardised magnitude of the effects of variables on the response (schielzeth 2010). because we included a categorical variable (year), we used two standard deviations to standard- ise continuous variables, which allows for compari- son and (gelman 2008; schielzeth continuous variables 2010). we calculated the variance inflation factor val- ues for covariates in all models and found none >1.3, indicating no violations of model assumptions due to multicollinearity (zuur et al. 2013) and consider co- variates significant in models when p < 0.05. coefficients between of categorical results body condition index using the pooled regression to estimate bci, we found that within both years, there was a significant effect of month captured on bci of arctic grayling (2012 anova f2,557 = 256.1, p < 0.001, 2013 anova f2,490 = 223.6, p < 0.001). the mean bci of fish measured in june (mean  se, 2012 =  0.133  than those measured (2012 = 0.064  0.014, 0.008, 2013 =  0.066  0.004) was significantly lower july during (2012 = 0.075  0.005, 2013 = 0.049  0.004) and 2013 = 0.062  august 0.009) within both years, although mean bci values of fish measured in july did not differ from those measured in august within either year (tukey’s post hoc hsd, p < 0.001) (figure 2 b). due to these trends, we subset fish captured by month and year and performed separate length–mass regressions to generate bci values used in migration modelling (table 1). after transformation, all of the six length– mass relationships were strongly linear with r2 values ≥0.97. growth the absolute and instantaneous growth of recaptured fish (n = 41) averaged 0.83  0.25 gday  1 and 0.006  0.001 day  1 in 2012 respectively. in 2013, absolute and instantaneous growth of recaptured fish (n = 11) averaged 0.58  0.12 gday  1 and 0.006  0.002 day  1 respectively. migration timing the majority of tagged fish migrated out of the stream in september in both years (table 2, fig- ure 3) although we did observe a distinct group of larger fish migrating in early july (figure 3, early migrants). we observed fish migrating as late as october 9th in 2012 and september 26th in 2013. all three migration models indicated that fish migrated earlier than smaller fish, although only the model for fish tagged in august indicated a signifi- cant relationship with bci (table 3; figure 3). the negative coefficient of bci in the august model indi- cated that on average, fish in poor body condition migrated later than fish in better body condition. in this model, the effect of fl was twice as great as that of bci, as determined by comparing coefficient val- larger table 2. sample size of subsets of fish tagged in june, july and august in 2012 and 2013 showing the mean fork length (fl) and standard error (se), median migration date, and range of migration dates for individuals within that group and year. subsets shown exclude fish that migrated <7 days after being tagged and are the same data used in monthly migration models. subset jun 2012 jul 2012 aug 2012 jun 2013 jul 2013 aug 2013 n 83 60 10 77 34 33 mean fl  se median migration date range of migration dates 206  4 191  5 203  18 199  5 181  6 179  6 sep 4 sep 7 sep 14 sep 10 sep 20 sep 21 jun 30–oct 9 jul 22–oct 7 sept 1–sept 26 jun 23–sept 25 aug 23–sept 24 sept 6–sept 26 variability in arctic grayling migration ues. the august model refit using only fl as a pre- dictor yielded a r2 value of 0.33. adding bci increased r2 to 0.42, explaining an additional 9% of variability in exit timing by individual fish. year was only found to be a significant predictor in the july model and predicted that on average, fish tagged in july 2012 migrated earlier than those tagged in july 2013. all models indicated that migration date was not influenced by tagging date. discussion conditions (e.g. environmental the pattern of juvenile migration out of the shallow beaded stream study area in the fall is driven by the selective pressures of the harsh arctic environment, where seasonally available streams provide habitat for summer foraging but often freeze solid during winter (craig & poulin 1975; west et al. 1992). within this population of individuals experiencing similar rapidly decreasing stream temperature as fall approaches), we documented variability in migratory timing that was strongly related to fish size and weakly correlated to body condition. using a recently validated metric of relative body condition for arctic grayling (bentley & schindler 2013), we also found fish condition dra- matically increased from june to july and august during the brief arctic growing season. we interpret these findings in the context of a size and physiologi- cal state mediated functional response to the selective pressures of a short growing season and differential rates of overwintering mortality. size-dependent overwintering mortality provides a possible mechanistic explanation for why smaller fish would remain in crea creek later into the fall. over- wintering mortality is often much higher for smaller individual fishes (oliver et al. 1979; henderson et al. 1988), and a commonly suggested mechanism is size-dependent starvation endurance. for example, biro et al. (2004) found that small rainbow trout (on- corhynchus mykiss) had lower lipid reserves, starved earlier and experienced higher rates of mortality than larger fish in both field and laboratory conditions. smaller salmonids with a higher per mass metabolic demand than larger individuals (paloheimo & dickie 1966; miranda & hubbard 1994) may be more likely to exhaust energy reserves during the extensive over- wintering period in arctic environments. this would produce a strong selective pressure for rapid early life history growth to reach a size at which annual sur- vival rates are higher. for younger age classes of fish and smaller individuals within age classes, extending the length of time in high-quality foraging habitats (e.g. later migration), such as beaded streams, may increase body size and prewinter lipid reserves, thereby increasing odds of overwinter survival. lar- 161 heim et al.

reist et al. 2006). in 2012 for example, september water temper- atures flowing from the mouth of crea creek ranged 162 table 3. monthly models predicting migration timing of arctic grayling with predictors fork length (fl), body condition index (bci), tagging date (julian date) and an indicator variable for year. the june model predicts early versus late migration in a logistic model (n = 160), while july (n = 94, r2 = 0.33) and august (n = 43, r2 = 0.40) models are linear and predict julian date of migration. all continuous predictor variables were centered and standardized to allow for interpretation of estimates as effect size. model predictor june july august fl bci tag date year fl bci tag date year fl bci tag date year estimate  2.88 4.27  0.06 0.69  14.58 1.11 0.20 13.739  9.08  4.47 0.08 1.32 95% ci  3.91 to  1.98  1.26 to 10.25  0.08 to 1.49  0.87 to 0.73  20.62 to  8.53  4.95 to 7.17  5.94 to 6.34 7.51 to 19.97  12.85 to  5.30  8.05 to  0.86  3.26 to 5.90  3.67 to 3.84 p <0.001 0.14 0.08 0.88 <0.001 0.72 0.95 <0.001 <0.001 0.02 0.97 0.56 from 6.06 to 1.39°c and averaged 3.57 (k. heim, university of alaska fairbanks, unpublished data). while within season growth and temperature relation- ships are not established for adult arctic grayling, these temperatures should be well within the range for growth of a cold-adapted salmonid (reist et al. 2006). furthermore, the physical and thermal com- plexity of beaded stream habitats with interconnected lake systems (arp et al. 2014) may provide opportu- nities to behaviourally thermoregulate to maximise assimilation and growth (e.g. armstrong et al. 2013) as temperatures decrease in late summer. although not unanimously supported by all three of our monthly migration models, we found a signifi- cant negative relationship between migration date and body condition in the august model. with other vari- ables in the model held constant, fish in poor condi- tion were predicted to migrate later than fish in good condition, suggesting that a condition-dependent mechanism may regulate fine-scale migratory timing. given that the time constraint of a short growing sea- son can result in greater risk taking by individuals preparing for winter (rowe & ludwig 1991), and hungry individuals often accept higher to maximise foraging (pettersson & br€onmark 1993; brown & kotler 2004), this explanation is plausible. fish within crea creek that have had a successful foraging season and accumulated adequate lipid reserves to survive the winter may migrate earlier, thus avoiding the potential to be stranded in poor overwin- tering habitat, whereas those that lack sufficient lipid reserves continue to forage within crea creek at con- siderable risk. while we did not explicitly test this mechanism through experimental manipulation, our results build a basis for future studies to test these rela- tionships in unaltered arctic watersheds. risks variability in arctic grayling migration a potential reason that our body condition hypoth- esis was not more strongly supported is that the met- ric of body condition used may not be representative of accumulated lipid reserves and recent growth for fish that were measured long before they migrated (e.g. fish measured in june, but migrating in septem- ber). for example, a fish of average relative weight measured in july may have had excellent foraging success in early august increasing its body condition in this and then migrated in early september. instance, our bci time of capture) would fail to represent true physiological condition during the time frame when that fish made the deci- sion to migrate. if this were the case, one would expect fish tagged and measured in august to most accurately reflect physiological condition of fish prior to migration in september. indeed, our august model is the one in which bci proved to be significantly related to migration timing. (measured at although the use of length–mass-based indices as a proxy for growth and lipid reserves is often controver- sial, we believe adequate precautions were taken to account for potential biases and its use is justified here. length–mass-based condition indices can be influenced by many factors, including maturation sta- tus (morgan 2004), diet (pothoven et al. 2001), seaso- nal variability due to fluctuating environmental conditions (gabelhouse 1991), and are not appropriate for species with nonlinear length–mass relationships (green 2001). we initially used all 1052 fish to calcu- late regression parameters and found that fish mass was much lower per given length for fish measured earlier in the summer within both years. this was expected, as fish in june have only recently moved out of overwintering areas (craig & poulin 1975) and are likely in a state of growth compensation (jobling et al. 1994; ali et al. 2003) where they forage heavily after a period of starvation. in itself, this was an important result and strengthens the notion that over- wintering periods may exert strong selective forces on arctic fish populations through starvation. buzby & deegan (2004) noted that adult arctic grayling may lose an average of 10% body mass during overwinter- ing (range 0–20%) in the kuparuk river. it can be expected that juvenile arctic grayling mass loss over winter is similar, if not greater, in our study popula- tion, being nearly 200 km north and at the northern extent of the range of this species. the results of this study indicated that late migrat- ing juvenile arctic grayling (and perhaps those in poor body condition) are vulnerable to the environ- mental changes that lead to reduced late season aqua- tic connectivity. for example, increased rates of evapotranspiration associated with climate change may lead to reduced run-off and disruption of sur- face–water connectivity and habitat access (rouse 163 heim et al. et al. 1997; reist et al. 2006; lesack & marsh 2010), although adequate flows are necessary for upstream or downstream movement (jonsson 1991; reist et al. 2006; bradford & heinonen 2008) to reach overwintering areas. while arctic grayling appear to be well adapted to time migrations with seasonal environmental cues (e.g. photoperiod, tem- perature, flow reduction, see tack 1980), reduced late season connectivity in tundra watersheds could greatly reduce seasonal access to productive shallow foraging habitats such as beaded streams. if some threshold level of prewinter lipid reserves or mini- mum size determines overwinter survival similar to other salmonid populations (lund et al. 2003), attain- ing this state could become more difficult in future climate scenarios. however, earlier ice break-up tim- ing and a longer open-water period are also predicted in future scenarios that may mitigate reduced late sea- son foraging opportunities by providing earlier access to seasonal habitats in spring (reist et al. 2006; prowse et al. 2011). this study was conducted in an area with current and expanding petroleum development that may impact relatively pristine beaded stream habitats whose ecological function remains poorly studied. in fact, recent legislation has approved the construction of an access road into the eastern national petroleum reserve-alaska, which is planned to intersect crea creek (usdoi blm 2014). our work in the crea creek drainage and ongoing work within the fish creek watershed (jones et al. 2013; arp et al. 2014) have demonstrated that beaded streams are important as both seasonal foraging habitats and as migratory pathways linking lake systems to larger tundra watersheds that provide overwintering habitat. as beaded streams are widely distributed across can- ada, alaska and russia (arp et al. 2014), further research is strongly warranted to better understand their ecological role in the life histories of migratory fish. although diminutive in size by late august (<0.5 m in width and 20 cm in depth), a large popu- lation of arctic grayling requires passage through the channel of crea creek for refuge in deeper connected habitats, and care should be taken to provide late sea- son small-stream connectivity here, and elsewhere as access roads and drilling areas are constructed across the hydrologic landscape. in summary, we found that size and body condi- tion are important in determining the migratory behaviour of an arctic fish. we also highlighted the dramatic seasonal changes in relative mass per unit length that can occur in a species that spends up to 9 months in isolated overwintering areas and the potential complications this has on length–mass- based bci. our study adds to the growing body of literature examining the relationship between individ- 164 ual attributes and migratory behaviour among fresh- water fish and provides empirical evidence to support condition and size-dependent migration timing. acknowledgements this work
