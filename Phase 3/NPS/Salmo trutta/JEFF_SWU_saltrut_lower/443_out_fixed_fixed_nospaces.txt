sturgeon chub, 85%), whereas most ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow were captured in the shallow, low-velocity channel border habitat with the bag seine (¯athead chub, 99%; western silvery minnow, 98%). best-®t regression models correctly predicted the presence or absence of sickle®n chub, ¯athead chub, and western silvery minnow more than 80% of the time. sturgeon chub presence and absence were predicted correctly 55% of the time. best-®t regression models ®t to ®sh number data for ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, and sturgeon chub and ®sh catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) data for ¯athead chub also provided good ®ts, with r2 values ranging from 0.32 to 0.55 (p < 0.0001). the higher density and catch of the four native minnows in the yrs and bcs suggest that these two segments are better habitat than the acs and mzs. t. l. welker, d. l. scarnecchia college of natural resources, department of fish and wildlife, university of idaho, moscow, usa key words: flathead chub;

barila et al. 1981). alterations of these river characteristics have led to subsequent in ®sh populations (walker & thoms 1993; duque et al. 1998) and ®sh community structure (bain et al. 1988; layher 1994; schmidt et al. 1998; penaz et al. 1999). in many large river systems, dams have been respon- sible for changes in downstream river physical habitat characteristics (e.g., depth, turbidity, and water temperature), resulting in changes in native ®sh species distribution, abundance, and commu- nity structure (minckley 1991; ligon et al. 1995; gehrke et al. 1999). historically, most sections of the missouri and lower yellowstone rivers possessed very similar physical characteristics, including high sediment loads, meandering channels, and ¯uctuating hydrographs (hesse et al. 1989). today, the hydrological, physical, and biological character- istics of many missouri river segments have been altered from dam construction, bank stabiliza- tion, and other actions. impacted river segments often exhibit very different environmental char- acteristics and ®sh communities from those of unaltered segments (hesse et al. 1989). the con¯uence of the missouri and yellow- stone rivers (hereafter referred to as the con¯u- ence) occurs in north-west north dakota near the montana±north dakota border. many native species of ®sh are abundant in the con¯uence area, but are considered at risk or threatened in other portions of the missouri river basin (hesse et al. 1989). the lower yellowstone river below the intake diversion dam (114.4 river kilometer (rkm)) is still very turbid and productive, with no dams. conversely, the missouri river above the con¯uence has been impacted by fort peck dam; this segment has an altered hydrograph, a reduced sediment load, and a colder temperature regime (leopold et al. 1964; young et al. 1998). the missouri river below the con¯uence is in¯u- enced by both the lower yellowstone river and the fort peck dam. additionally, at the con¯u- ence of the yellowstone and missouri rivers, there is a mixing zone of the two rivers resulting in a habitat with physical attributes unlike the other three con¯uence river segments. these four seg- ments of river thus exhibit different physical and, perhaps, biological characteristics. the distinc- tiveness and close proximity of these segments provide an opportunity to examine the relation- ship between an array of environmental variables and distribution, abundance, and habitat use of habitat use and population structure of minnows various ®sh species constituting the native ®sh community. several small cyprinid species common to the con¯uence area have diminished in distribution and abundance in many other segments of the missouri river and its tributaries (p¯ieger & grace 1987; hesse 1994). these species include the ¯athead chub (platygobio gracilis richardson), sickle®n chub (macrhybopsis meeki jordan and evermann), sturgeon chub (macrhybopsis gelida girard), and western silvery minnow (hybo- gnathus argyritis girard). concerns over reduc- tion in range of the sickle®n and sturgeon chubs prompted petitions to the united states fish and wildlife service in 1994 to list both species as endangered. although the ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow have not been considered for federal listing as endangered spe- cies, they are listed by most missouri river basin states (montana, north dakota, south dakota, iowa, kansas, and missouri) as threatened or species of concern (hesse et al. 1989). even though numerous researchers have provided information on the microhabitat preferences of these native cyprinid ®shes (p¯ieger 1975; reigh & elsen 1979; stewart 1981; werdon 1992; hesse 1994; grisak 1996; gould, unpublished report; ozanne, unpublished paper), detailed quantita- tive assessments concerning their habitat use in relation to environmental features of large rivers are absent. for conservation of these species, it is important to understand the habitat characteris- tics that are most important to them, and how habitat differences in river segments may be mani- fested in differences in ®sh abundance or density. such comparison is best obtained over a restricted geographic range, where problems with con- founding factors are fewer. the objectives of this study were to: (i) examine habitat use of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, stur- geon chub, and western silvery minnow during summer; and (ii) to determine the comparative importance of four distinct large river segments in close proximity to the yellowstone±missouri river con¯uence as habitat for these four native cyprinids. study area the con¯uence of the missouri and yellowstone rivers is located in north-west north dakota, approximately 8 km from the north dakota± montana border (fig. 1). all four study segments were within the con¯uence area. two study seg- ments were in the missouri river, one segment was in the yellowstone river, and the fourth segment was the mixing zone of the missouri 9 welker & scarnecchia fig. 1. map depicting study area location and the four study segments (acs, above confluence segment; bcs, below confluence segment; mzs, mixing zone segment; yrs, yellowstone river segment). and yellowstone rivers (fig. 1). the ®rst segment of the missouri river extended 8 km up-river from the missouri river and yellowstone river con¯uence (missouri river 2546 rkm) and is hereafter referred to as the above-con¯uence seg- ment (acs; fig. 1). the second missouri river segment extended 48.3 km down-river from the con¯uence to the headwaters of lake sakakawea (2470.3 rkm) and is hereafter referred to as the below-con¯uence segment (bcs; fig. 1). the yel- lowstone river segment (yrs) extended 24.0 km up-river from the con¯uence and is hereafter referred to as the yrs (fig. 1). the mixing zone, hereafter referred to as the mixing-zone segment (mzs), extended from the con¯uence down-river approximately 800 m in the missouri river. materials and methods data collection two habitat types, main channel and main chan- nel border, were sampled to characterize segment ®sh communities and to examine the relation- ships among ®sh and select physiochemical var- iables. main channel habitat paralleled the river shoreline at and immediately adjacent to the thalweg. channel border habitat was shallower, 10 and extended from the river shoreline toward the thalweg to a maximum depth of 1.5 m. eight 250-m sample units, each of which contained both habi- tat types, were selected near the con¯uence in each of three segments of the river (acs, bcs, and yrs). a sample unit was de®ned as a 250-m stretch of the river with its longitudinal bound- aries as the shoreline. sample units were con®ned within the main-stem river, located between but not within, inside±outside bend complexes. only two sample units of this length existed in the mzs (the shortest segment), so only these two sample units were used. data were collected in the period july±september 1997 and 1998. two sample units were randomly selected, without replacement, in each of the summer months from each study region. both available sample units in the mzs were sampled once in each of the 3 months. in each month, sample units were sampled within four consecutive days. fish collection two gears were used to sample ®sh within sample units. fish in main channel habitat were sampled with a benthic beam trawl (2 m in width 0.5 m in height 5.5 m in length; 0.32 cm inner mesh; 3.81 cm outer cha®ng mesh; 16.5 cm cod-end opening) and ®sh in channel border habitat were sampled with a bag seine (10.7 m in length 1.8 m in height; 1.8 m3 bag; 5 mm ace mesh). three trawl subsamples were taken in main channel habitat in each selected sample unit. for each subsample, the trawl was attached to the bow of the boat and towed downstream (in reverse) beginning at the upstream lateral bound- ary and proceeding downstream parallel to the shoreline, ending 150 m downstream from the upstream lateral boundary. the ®rst subsample was taken in the thalweg, and a coin toss was used to determine whether the second or third subsam- ple was to the left or right of the ®rst. a buoyed 150-m anchored line marked the upstream and downstream lateral boundaries and the distance to be towed for each subsample. two bag seine subsamples were taken in each sample unit. the ®rst was taken on either shore- line at the one-third point upstream of the down- stream lateral boundary of the sample unit and the second was taken on the same shoreline at the two-third point upstream from the downstream lateral boundary. the seine was deployed by holding one end stationary and pulling the other end upstream until it was fully extended along the shoreline. the upstream end was then pulled downstream through the water in a 1808 arc, keeping the net fully extended or until the water column exceeded a depth of 1.5 m. at the end of the arc, the net was pulled to shore. the number and type of ®sh captured were recorded. all ¯athead chubs, sickle®n chubs, stur- geon chubs, and western silvery minnows were measured for total length (mm). one seine haul or one trawl tow de®ned one unit of sampling effort. catch densities of the four minnow species were calculated by segment. habitat characterization five physiochemical variables (depth, velocity, turbidity, temperature, and substrate) and one biological variable (invertebrate drift density) were measured after each benthic trawl and each bag seine subsample. an additional biological variable, benthic invertebrate density, was mea- sured after each bag seine subsample. these seven variables were a priori believed to be important characteristics of habitats used by the four minnows. in main-channel habitat, preliminary observations indicated a uniformity of the physiochemical and biological variables among 150-m benthic trawl subsamples; it was therefore decided that single-point measurement of these variables, with the exception of depth and velocity, adequately represented the conditions encountered by ®sh. depth and velocity were habitat use and population structure of minnows measured at points one-third, one-half, and two-thirds of the tow length upstream from the downstream tow lateral boundary, and were then averaged. after completing a trawl, the boat was anchored at the center of the trawl path and current velocity was measured with a marsh± mcbirney ¯ow meter. the probe of the ¯ow meter was suspended near the bottom with an a55 metric sounding real and 22.7 kg sounding weight. current velocity was measured to the nearest 0.1 m s 1. water temperature was measured with a ysi 30 temperature/conductivity meter. the meter probe was held 1±2 feet under the water surface, and temperature was measured to the nearest 0.18c. water depth was measured with a lowrance sonar device to the nearest 0.1 m. for turbidity measurements, a sample of water was collected approximately 0.5 m below the water surface and analyzed with a hach 2100p turbidity meter. turbidity was measured to the nearest 1.0 nepha- lometric turbidity unit (ntu). a bottom substrate sample was collected with an iron pipe (61.0 cm in length 10.2 cm in dia- meter) that had one end closed. the pipe was attached to a rope and dragged upstream with the boat through the path of the trawl tow. the pipe contents were emptied onto the boat and the percentages of silt (particle size 0.06 mm), sand (particle size 0.06 and 2.0 mm), and gravel (par- ticle size 2.0 mm and 16 mm) were estimated visually. in main-channel habitat, invertebrate drift was collected with a wisconsin-style plankton net (10.8 cm diameter, 80 mm mesh), ®tted with a general oceanics ¯ow meter. the plankton net was lowered from an anchored boat with the sounding reel and remained suspended near the bottom for 2 min. the quantity of water that passed through the net was used to calculate the invertebrate density, expressed as number of organisms per liter. in channel border habitat, the ®ve physiochem- ical variables and benthic invertebrate drift were measured with the same devices at each bag seine subsample. water column depth and water velo- city were measured at 2, 6, and 10 m from the shoreline along a transect perpendicular to the shore at the mid-point of the 1808 bag seine arc and were averaged to obtain an estimate of depth and velocity for the subsample. water tempera- ture, turbidity, and conductivity were measured at the center of the area seined. a substrate sample was collected with the iron pipe by ®rst placing it at the deepest point seined and dragging it towards the shore along the seine midpoint. 11 welker & scarnecchia percentages of sand, silt, and gravel were then estimated from the pipe contents. benthic drift invertebrates were sampled by attaching the wisconsin-style plankton net to a wooden pole and towing the net by hand at the site for a period of 3 min. benthic macro- invertebrates were sampled with a ponar dredge (22.9 cm 22.9 cm). three ponar grabs were made at the 2, 6, and 10-m points along the transect perpendicular to the midpoint of the seine sample. the three samples were combined and washed in a bucket ®tted with a 541 mm sieve screen bottom. the remaining sediment, debris, and macro- invertebrates were placed into a container and preserved with 95% ethanol. in the lab, benthic invertebrates were identi®ed in most cases to family. invertebrate density was expressed as number of organisms per square meter. analyses segment and habitat characterization the degree of physiochemical similarity among the four segments was examined with cluster analysis. cluster analysis was performed on physiochemical data (depth, current velocity, turbidity, temperature, substrate composition, and discharge) measured in each study segment. in each year and segment, averages of physio- chemical variables within each habitat type were weighted by habitat area and then averaged across the habitat types. yearly means for seg- ments were then converted to standard scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable (hair et al. 1995). finally, standardized scores were averaged across years and a 4 8 (4 segments 8 variables) matrix was formed for analysis. a joining clustering method was employed, with a single linkage amalgamation rule and a euclidean-type distance measure used to form clusters (hair et al. 1995). two of the physio- chemical variables, depth and velocity, were highly correlated (r > 0.90), so a type of euclidian distance measure, mahalanobis distance, was used (mahalanobis 1936). habitat differences among segments were examined with a multivariate technique. multi- variate analysis of variance (manova; johnson & wichern 1992) was conducted across segments for each habitat type. segments and years served as the independent variables and physiochemical categories of water (depth, current velocity, tur- bidity, temperature, percent silt, and percent sand) served as the dependent variable. the equal variance±covariance assumption for the manova was checked with the box test (box 12 1949). residual plots for each dependent variable were constructed to examine homoscedasticity. multicollinearity between dependent variables was examined by computing the variance in¯ation factor. an appropriate transformation, such as arc-sine (square root (y)), log (y 1), or square root (y)), was applied to dependent variables that violated any of the assumptions (hair et al. 1995). distribution, abundance, and structure at the time of data collection, the area (m2) of each habitat type in a sample unit was measured with a pair of laser range ®nding binoculars. this information was used to estimate the relative abundance of each ®sh species in a segment's ®sh assemblage. in each year, the catch-per-unit- effort (cpue; number of ®sh per square meter) for each species from each habitat type in a sample unit was multiplied by the total area estimated for the habitat in a sample unit, and then summed, yielding an estimate of the number of ®sh in that sample unit. estimates from the sample units were then summed, yielding the total estimated number of ®sh in the segment for that year. relative abundance of each species was computed by dividing the total number of estimated ®sh for a species by the total number of ®sh estimated for the segment. the relative abundance computed for each species was then averaged across years to obtain the 2-year average. length±frequency histograms were constructed for ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow to examine the popu- lation structure and assess year class strength within each study segment. habitat use habitat use by ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow was characterized by computing the cpue for each species by habitat type and by determining the number of ®sh captured and the relative abun- dance for each species by segment. predictive models multiple regression models were developed for each species to evaluate ®sh presence and absence, ®sh number, or ®sh density in relation to a variety of environmental variables. three types of multi- ple regression models were developed: logistic regression, poisson regression, and linear regres- sion. logistic regression models had ®sh presence (1) or absence (0) as the dependent variable and environmental variables as predictor variables. the relationship between environmental variables and ®sh presence or absence was described with the logit form of the logistic regression model. logit pry  1  b0 2j1 bjxj  j  1, , n environmental variables) where logit is the transformation of the probabil- ity pr(y 1), b0 is the y-intercept, bj is the slope for each environmental variable, and xj repre- sents the environmental variables. models were developed by combining data from all four segments and used to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in habitat characteristics where ®sh were sampled and not sampled. predictor variable multicollinearity was examined prior to analysis. depth and velocity were highly correlated (r > 0.90; n 238); there- fore, principal components analysis was used to derive a new vector for depth and velocity and used in each logistic regression analysis (dunte- man 1989). akaike's information criterion (aic; akaike 1987) was computed for all possible com- binations of predictor variables and used to iden- tify the one best-®t model for a species. the hat matrix diagonal was used to detect outlier values, and pearson residuals were used to identify obser- vations that were not well explained by each best- ®t model (kleinbaum et al. 1998). final model reliability was examined by using the chi-square test for covariates (p < 0.05 for signi®cance). poisson regression models using ®sh count data were developed for sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow instead of linear regression models using cpue because of the large number of samples that contained zero ®sh; this result caused the normality assumption to be violated for the linear regression models. poisson regression had ®sh counts as the depen- dent variable and environmental variables served as predictor variables. the relationship between environmental variables and ®sh abundance was described with the following form of the poisson regression model. log ey i  b0 2j1 bjxj  j  1, , n environmental variables) where e(yi) is the expected number of ®sh, b0 is the y-intercept, bj is the slope for each environmental variable, and xj represents the environmental variables. data from all four segments were combined for model development for sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow and used to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in habitat use and population structure of minnows habitat characteristics based on ®sh number. prior to analysis, predictor variable collinearity was examined with a correlation matrix and multicollinearity was examined by computing variance in¯ation factor. a goodness-of-®t statis- tic, known as deviance (kleinbaum et al. 1998), derived from maximum likelihood ratios, was used to identify variables that contributed signif- icantly to ®sh counts. poisson regression models were developed separately by gear type for ®sh species. differ- ences in gear selectivity prevented analysis across gear types. the sickle®n chub and sturgeon chub poisson regression models were developed from ®sh count data obtained from the benthic trawl in main channel habitat. the western silvery min- now poisson regression model was developed from ®sh count data obtained from the bag seine in channel border habitat. for ¯athead chub, a linear regression model was developed using cpue from the bag seine (measured in channel border habitat) as the dependent variable and environmental variables served as predictor variables. the relationship between environmental variables and ®sh cpue was described with the following form of the multiple regression model. y  b0 2j1 bjxj  j  1, , n environmental variables) where y is ¯athead chub cpue, b0 is the y- intercept, bj is the slope for each environmental variable, and xj represents the environmental variables. the model was developed by combining data from all four segments and was used to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in habitat characteristics based on ®sh cpue (num- ber of ®sh per square meter). predictor variable collinearity and multicollinearity were examined in the same manner as for poisson regression models. in¯uential observations were identi®ed with cook's distance. heteroscedasticity was examined with residual plots and normality of the error term distribution was examined with normal probability plots. the dependent variable was square-root transformed to more closely approximate a normal distribution. aic was used to identify the one best-®t model. the predictive ability of best-®t logistic regres- sion models and best-®t poisson regression mod- els was tested against an external data set from the same location in which the data were collected with the same gears in 1997 and 1998 (galat et al. 2002). however, before logistic regression model 13 welker & scarnecchia testing could begin, each model's optimum deci- sion rule probability for ®sh presence or absence was determined. for the logistic regression mod- els, 60 observations from the external data set were randomly selected that included 30 observa- tions that were present and 30 that were absent for a species. a ®sh was determined to be present at an observation when the predicted probability was greater than the optimum decision rule prob- ability. tables depicting the percent correctly and incorrectly classi®ed were developed to examine how well each model predicted ®sh presence and absence. for poisson regression models, 45 observa- tions, where each species was present, were ran- domly selected from the external data set and run through each model. graphs comparing the num- ber of ®sh predicted by the model to the observed number of ®sh were generated to examine how well each model predicted ®sh cpue. for all regression analyses, the data were analyzed using the statistical analysis systems (sas 1989) soft- ware package. results length (fig. 2). most ®sh ranged from 60 to 90 mm in length with chubs less than 40 mm found in the bcs, mzs, and yrs. no sickle®n chubs less than 60 mm were captured in the acs. sturgeon chub the highest relative abundance of sturgeon chubs was found in the yrs, where the greatest number of this species was also captured (table 1). stur- geon chubs ranged from 20 to 80 mm in length (fig. 2). length±frequency distributions were irregular in the acs, bcs, and mzs. fish less than 40 mm were captured in all study segments, with the highest proportion in the yrs. western silvery minnow the greatest number of western silvery minnows was captured in the bcs; this segment also had the highest relative abundance of the species (table 1). western silvery minnows ranged from 13 to 96 mm in length in the four segments (fig. 2). length±frequency distributions were irregular in all study segments. both the bcs and the yrs had high proportions of ®sh less than 30 mm. distribution, abundance, and structure habitat use flathead chub flathead chub was the most abundant species in each of the four segments (1611 ®sh) representing from 33 to 65% of the catch in any one segment (table 1). most ¯athead chubs in all study seg- ments ranged from less than 40 to 60 mm in length (fig. 2). the bcs and yrs had high proportions of ¯athead chub less than 40 mm in length. sicklefin chub the greatest number of sickle®n chubs was cap- tured in the bcs (table 1). however, this species had its highest relative abundance in the acs. sickle®n chubs ranged from 30 to 120 mm in in the four segments, 99% of the 1611 ¯athead chubs were captured in the shallow channel bor- der habitat. in this habitat, the highest cpue for ¯athead chub was in the bcs and the lowest in the mzs (table 1). cpue of ¯athead chubs was low in main channel habitat in all four segments. ninety-seven percent of the 147 sickle®n chubs were captured in the deep, high-velocity main channel habitat. the highest cpue found for sickle®n chub in this habitat was in the yrs and the lowest in the acs and mzs (table 1). sickle®n chubs were not captured in the shallow channel border habitat except for four ®sh (3%) in the bcs. table1. catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) with the benthic trawl in main channel habitat (mc) and the bag seine in channel border habitat (cb) and catch (no. of fish) and percent relative abundance (%rel. abun.) for the four minnows in the four study regions (cpue expressed as number per 100 m2 in mc and number per m2 in cb). acs bcs mzs cpue mc catch %rel. abun. cpue cb mc catch %rel. abun. <0.1 138 54.8 20.4 <0.1 725 65.1 0.2 0.1 0.0 23 27 18 9.1 9.7 2.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.2 49 27 4.4 <0.1 169 8.6 1.9 9.8 cb 4.4 0.0 0.1 0.6 cb 4.1 0.0 0.1 1.1 species flathead chub (platygobiogracilis) sicklefin chub (macrhybopsismeeki) sturgeon chub (macrhybopsisgelida) western silvery minnow (hybognathusargyritis) 14 cpue mc catch %rel. abun. yrs cpue cb mc catch %rel. abun. <0.1 125 32.7 18.0 <0.1 623 46.4 0.2 <0.1 <0.1 28 9 31 7.4 2.2 5.9 0.0 0.3 1.1 0.4 0.7 <0.1 47 92 42 5.8 12.1 2.2 habitat use and population structure of minnows fig. 2. length frequency distributions for flathead chub, sicklefin chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow by river segment (acs, above confluence segment;

bcs, below confluence segment; mzs, mixing zone segment; yrs, yellowstone river segment). segment and habitat characterization the two segments that were most physiochemi- cally similar were the yrs and mzs, with the acs being the most dissimilar (fig. 3). among the segments, channel border habitat was similar in depth, current velocity, and turbidity (table 2). the mean water temperature was nearly 28c cooler in the acs and both the acs and the mzs contained two times the mean percent composition of silt as compared to the other two study segments. current velocity and sub- strate composition were similar among the four study segments in the main channel habitat (table 2). mean depth (5.4 m) and turbidity (239.4 ntu) were greater in the mzs than the other three study segments. mean water tempera- ture was lowest in the acs (19.08c) and highest in the yrs (21.68c). signi®cant differences in physiochemical char- acteristics were found among segments in both habitat types (main channel, manova, wilk's lambda 0.5641, p < 0.0001; channel border, manova, wilk's lambda 0.6324, p < 0.001), but not years (main channel, manova, wilk's lambda 0.2142, p 0.71; channel border, man- ova, wilk's lambda 0.2334, p 0.11). no sig- ni®cant interaction was found between study segments and years for either main channel habi- tat (manova, wilk's lambda 0. 1764, p 0.22) (manova, wilk's or channel border habitat lambda 0.2875, p 0.09). predictive models for ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow, we rejected the null hypothesis that there was no difference in habitat characteristics where ®sh were sampled and not table 2. summer physiochemical characterization (mean, range, sd) of main channel and channel border habitat. physiochemical variable acs bcs mzs yrs acs bcs mzs yrs main channel habitat channel border habitat depth (m) range sd range sd current velocity (ms 1) turbidity (ntu) range sd temperature (celsius) range sd substrate composition (%) silt sand gravel 3.7 1.2^6.2 1.2 1.0 0.6^1.7 0.2 122.0 46.0^423.0 93.4 19.0 13.9^21.5 2.0 3.9 0.9^7.2 1.5 1.1 0.5^1.5 0.2 188.9 41.0^522.0 113.0 20.9 16.3^25.4 2.1 5.4 2.3^8.5 1.6 1.1 0.4^1.7 0.3 239.4 24.0^969.0 266.9 21.0 15.1^27.6 2.9 4.0 2.1^6.2 1.2 0.9 0.5^1.2 0.2 224.1 21.0^605.0 200.9 21.6 18.1^24.5 1.8 0.4 0.2^0.7 0.2 0.2 0.0^0.4 0.1 144.3 57.0^306.0 77.8 20.2 18.4^23.0 1.5 0.3 0.1^0.8 0.2 0.1 0.0^0.4 0.1 179.4 38.0^326.0 93.0 21.4 16.3^25.4 2.5 0.5 0.2^0.8 0.2 0.2 0.0^0.4 0.1 183.5 21.0^423.3 126.9 22.0 18.1^25.5 2.4 0.5 0.2^0.9 0.2 0.1 0.0^0.5 0.1 167.0 30.0^673.0 150.4 21.7 17.8^24.5 1.8 6.6 91.4 1.9 <0.1 97.2 2.5 5.3 91.0 3.7 2.7 90.9 6.4 66.8 33.2 0.0 37.3 62.4 0.3 68.7 31.2 0.1 38.3 61.7 0.0 acs, above-confluence segment;

number (sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, western silvery minnow) or cpue (¯athead chub). the environmental variables retained by each poisson regression model and the linear regression model were sig- ni®cantly (p < 0.0001) related to ®sh number and cpue, respectively (table 3). the sickle®n chub and sturgeon chub poisson models showed close agreement between the num- ber of ®sh observed and the number of ®sh pre- dicted by both models (sickle®n chub, r 0.45; p < 0.05; sturgeon chub, r 0.52; p < 0.05). the predictive ability of the poisson regression model for western silvery minnow and the linear regres- sion model for ¯athead chub were not tested because one of the environmental variables retained by these models (benthic invertebrate density) was not measured for the external data set. however, the r2 value for each model indi- cates that they are good predictors of the depen- dent variable (table 3). discussion segment and habitat characterization the physiochemical differences among the study segments indicated the presence of distinctly dif- ferent habitat conditions for ®shes among study segments, especially between the acs and the other segments. for example, the yrs was char- acterized by high turbidity, high summer water temperatures (in the main channel), and high discharge. in comparison, the acs of river exhib- ited lower main channel turbidity, lower water temperature, and lower discharge than the other study segments. many of the differences are a result of the strong in¯uence of the yellowstone river on downstream segments and the in¯uence of fort peck dam on the acs. fort peck dam acts as a sediment sink, trapping in-¯owing sus- pended sediment, and limiting downstream move- ment of the river's suspended load (leopold et al. 1964). as a result, turbidity is reduced in the acs. hypolimnetic withdrawals from fort peck dam also reduced the summer water temperatures in the acs. peak water temperatures in the acs were from 4.9 to 6.18c cooler than the other segments (table 2). the in¯uence of the missouri river above the con¯uence on the physiochemical characteristics of the mzs and bcs was dam- pened by the higher discharge exhibited by the yellowstone river for most of the study period 18 (july±september), in both 1997 and 1998, causing the acs to be greatly different from the other segments. habitat use flathead chub and western silvery minnow used similar depths, velocities, turbidities, tempera- tures, and substrates. we found that in samples containing western silvery minnows, ¯athead chubs were also present 83% of the time and in samples containing ¯athead chubs, western silv- ery minnows were present approximately 40% of the time. gould (1985) also frequently captured these two species together in the musselshell river, montana. in this study, both species com- monly used depths less than 1 m and current velocities less than 0.25 m s 1, with few indivi- duals of either species captured in the deeper, swifter main channel. habitat models for both species also included depth and velocity as signi®- cant variables in predicting ®sh presence or abun- dance, with decreasing depth and velocity resulting in increasing ®sh number or presence probability. p¯ieger & grace (1987) documented the pre- cipitous decline in both ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow in the lower missouri river over a 40-year period. they hypothesized that the decline in ¯athead chub was related to reduced turbidity and competition with other ®sh species and the reduction in western silvery minnow was because of reduced sediment transport and loss of silty backwater habitat. results of this study indicate that shallow, is important for ¯athead chub. the near absence of this habitat in the lower missouri river result- ing from dredging and channelization and revet- ment structures (hesse & sheets 1993) may also be a contributing factor responsible for the decline of both species. low-velocity habitat sickle®n chub, in contrast, were more asso- ciated with the main channel. they commonly used sand substrate and depths greater than 3 m and current velocities greater than 0.5 m s 1. grisak (1996) found that sample sites containing this species averaged 0.58 m s 1 current velocity, 3.4 m depth, and 70% sand substrate. in this study, the mean depth occupied was similar (3.7 m) as in his study. sites where chubs were found in the present study contained 1.3 times more sand (90.8%) and exhibited an average current velocity (0.9 m s 1) that was 1.6 times swifter than sites in grisak's (1996) study. habitat models predicting either presence or abundance for this species included percent sand, current velocity, and discharge as signi®cant variables, with an increase in percent sand and current velocity and a decrease in discharge, positively in¯uencing ®sh presence or abundance. similar results were obtained by everett (1999) for sick- le®n chub in the con¯uence area in 1995. the in¯uence of discharge on ®sh presence or abun- dance must be its effect on trawl cpue. for sickle®n chub, discharge and cpue are nega- tively correlated (r 0.30). perhaps at high dis- charge, a greater amount of suitable habitat is available, thereby reducing ®sh density and nega- tively affecting cpue. sturgeon chub commonly used sand substrate and depths ranging from <1±4 m and current velocities ranging from 0 to 1.0 m s 1. habitat models for this species included percent gravel, current velocity, and discharge as signi®cant vari- ables in predicting ®sh abundance, with an increase in percent gravel and a decrease in cur- rent velocity and discharge positively in¯uencing ®sh number. everett (1999) also found that a decrease in current velocity positively in¯uenced the presence of sturgeon chub. other researchers found that gravel was the primary substrate used by sturgeon chub (davis & miller 1967; baxter & simon 1970; elser et al. 1980; burr & warren 1986; gelwicks et al. 1996; gould, unpublished report). we found that the primary substrate used by sturgeon chub was sand. however, increasing percent gravel at sample sites positively in¯uenced sturgeon chub density. the negative in¯uence of discharge on cpue (r 0.34) is similar to that observed for sickle®n chub. distribution, abundance, density, and structure the higher density and catch for ¯athead chub, western silvery minnow, sickle®n chub, and stur- geon chub in the yrs and bcs, in addition to length-frequency distributions for three of the species (¯athead chub, western silvery minnow, and sturgeon chub) that contained a broader range of ®sh sizes when compared to the other two segments, indicate that these two segments are better habitat for these species of ®sh than the acs and mzs. most individuals of ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow were captured in channel border habitat in all four study segments. this habitat exhibited lower current velocities and a greater percentage of sand substrate in the yrs and bcs than in the acs and mzs. habitat models predicting ®sh abundance and density included both these variables, with abundance of both species increasing as velocity decreased and percent sand increased. in the four segments, main channel habitat yielded the highest densities and catches of sick- le®n chubs. a habitat model using sickle®n chub habitat use and population structure of minnows abundance data from this habitat included cur- rent velocity and temperature, with abundance of sickle®n chubs increasing as velocity increased and temperature increased. approximately 72% of sickle®n chub were captured in current velo- cities between 0.75 and 1.25 m s 1. high propor- tions of trawl subsamples in both the yrs (86%) and bcs (77%) fell within this velocity category; lower proportions of trawl subsamples in the acs (62%) and mzs (56%) were within this range of current velocity. similarly, water temperatures were highest in main channel habitat in the yrs, where this species achieved its highest cpue. most sturgeon chub samples were collected in august and september of 1998 in main channel habitat within the yrs. at this time, the river discharge was lower in the yrs than in the other three segments, which explains the inclusion of this variable in both sturgeon chub models. coar- ser substrates (more sand and gravel) were found in both habitat types in yrs and bcs than in the other two segments. the habitat models predict- ing ®sh presence and ®sh number included both these variables, with the presence of sturgeon chub increasing with decreasing discharge and increasing coarseness of substrate. as of 2003, the status of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow is a subject of debate. in the lower missouri river, the abundance of these four species has declined precipitously since the onset of dam construction and channelization (p¯ieger & grace 1987) and each has received considerable support for listing as endangered under the united states endan- gered species act (werdon 1993a,b; hesse 1994). however, studies conducted in the upper mis- souri and lower yellowstone rivers (grisak 1996; young et al. 1997; everett 1999; gould, unpub- lished report) suggest that the status of these species may be a cause of less concern in montana and north dakota, based on their widespread distribution and abundance. in this study, these four species made up over 65% of the catch, indicating that their status is better in the con- ¯uence area than in many portions of the middle and lower missouri rivers. further, even in the con¯uence area, the density and catch of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, and sturgeon chub in the quasi-natural yrs and the bcs were higher than in the acs which was the segment most impacted by fort peck dam. for sustainable populations of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow in the upper missouri and lower yellow- stone rivers, natural river characteristics, such as a naturally ¯uctuating hydrograph and a high sedi- ment load, that produce a diversity of habitats 19 welker & scarnecchia and habitat conditions should be preserved and, if possible, improved in altered river segments. channel modi®cations, such as bank stabilization and additional irrigation withdrawals, that would alter natural river habitat should be discouraged. summary in 1997 and 1998, sampling was conducted on the missouri and yellowstone rivers, north dakota to obtain information on the distribution, abun- dance, and habitat use of the ¯athead chub (p. gracilis richardson), sickle®n chub (m. meeki jordan and evermann), sturgeon chub (m. gir- ard), and western silvery minnow (h. argyritis girard), four declining ®sh species (family cypri- nidae) native to the missouri river basin. the study area consisted of four distinct river seg- ments near the con¯uence of the missouri and yellowstone rivers ± three moderately altered segments and one quasi-natural segment. catch rates with the trawl for sickle®n chub and sturgeon chub and catch rates with the bag seine for ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow were highest in the two least altered segments (the quasi-natural segment and one least altered segment). most sickle®n chubs and sturgeon chubs were captured in the deep, high-velocity main channel habitat with the trawl (sickle®n sturgeon chub 85%), whereas chub 97%, most ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow were captured in the shallow, low-velocity chan- nel border habitat with the bag seine (¯athead chub 99%, western silvery minnow 98%). best-®t regression models predicted sickle®n chub, ¯athead chub, and western silvery minnow presence and absence correctly greater than 80% of the time. sturgeon chub presence and absence was predicted correctly 55% of the time. best-®t regression models ®t to ®sh number data for ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, and sturgeon chub and ®sh cpue data for ¯athead chub also pro- vided good ®ts with r2 values ranging from 0.32 to 0.55. the presence and density of sickle®n chub and sturgeon chub at collection sites was signi®can- tly (p < 0.0001) related to current velocity, sub- strate, and river discharge. for ¯athead chub and western silvery minnow, ®sh presence was signi®- cantly (p < 0.0001) related to depth and velocity. in this study, these four cyprinids made up over 65% of the catch, indicating that their status is better in the con¯uence area than in many por- tions of the middle and lower missouri rivers. further, even in the con¯uence area, the density and catch of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, and sturgeon chub in the quasi-natural yrs and the bcs were higher than in the acs, which was the 20 segment most impacted by fort peck dam. for sustainable populations of ¯athead chub, sickle®n chub, sturgeon chub, and western silvery minnow in the upper missouri and lower yellowstone rivers, natural river characteristics, such as a naturally ¯uctuating hydrograph and a high sedi- ment load, that produce a diversity of habitats and habitat conditions should be preserved and, if possible, improved in altered river segments. channel modi®cations, such as bank stabilization and additional irrigation withdrawals, that would alter natural river habitat should be discouraged. resumen 1. durante los anä os 1997 and 1998, llevamos a cabo mues- treos en los rios missouri y yellowstone (dakota del norte, usa) para obtener informacioâ n sobre la distribucioâ n, abun- dancia y uso del habitat de cuatro cypõâ nidos en declive, nativos de la cuenca del missouri (usa): p. gracilis richar- son, m. meeki jordan and evermann, m. gelida girard e hybognathus arguritis girard. 2. el area de estudio consistioâ en cuatro segmentos distintos cerca de la con¯uencia de los rios missouri y yellowstone. un segmento quasi-natural y tres moderadamente alterados, in¯uenciados por un embalse. uno de los segmentos alter- ados estaba localizado en la con¯uencia de los dos rios (segmento de zona mezclada, mzs). los otros dos segmen- tos moderadamente alterados estaban en el rio missuri cerca de mzs, uno aguas arriba (segmento sobre la con¯uencia, acs) y otro aguas abajo (segmento por debajo de la con- ¯uencia, bcs). el segmento quasi-natural estaba aguas arriba de mzs en el rio yellowstone (segmento del rio yellowstone, ysr). 3. las tasas de captura con redes de arrastre para m. meeki y m. gelida y las tasas de captura con redes de bolsa para p. gracilis y h. argyritis fueron mayores en bcs y yrs. la mayor parte de los m. meeki y m. gelida fueron capturados en el habitat profundo y de alta velocidad de agua del canal principal con redes de arrastre (m. meeki 97% y m. gelida 85%) mientras que la mayor parte de p. gracilis y h. argyritis fueron capturados en el habitat de los bordes del canal, de menor velocidad y aguas someras (p. gracilis 99%, m. gelida 98%). 4. la presencia o ausencia de m. meeki, p. gracilis y h. argyritis fue correctamente predicha por modelos mod- elos de regresioâ n en mas del 80% de las veces y la presencia o ausencia de m. gelida, en el 55% de las veces. modelos de regresioâ n ajustados a la abundancia de p. gracilis, m. meeki y m. gelida tambien produjeron buenos ajustes con valores de r2 en el rango 0.32±0.55 (p < 0.0001). la alta densidad y captura de estos cuatro ciprõâ nidos en yrs y bcs sugirioâ que estos segmentos son mejores habitats que acs y mzs. acknowledgements this research was part of the missouri river benthic fishes project,
