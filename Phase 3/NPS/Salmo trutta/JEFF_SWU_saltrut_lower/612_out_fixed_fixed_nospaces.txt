spotﬁn chub; tennessee; hierarchical; streams; conservation introduction stream ﬁsh select microhabitat locations based on various features such as depth, velocity and substrate (e.g., labonne et al. 2003; hazelton & grossman 2009; midway et al. 2010). identifying the multidi- mensional microhabitat niche of stream ﬁsh is required for assessing their stream habitat and ﬂow require- ments (ahmadi-nedushan et al. 2006; petts 2009). such research is valuable as many stream ﬁshes continue to decline in their distribution and abundance (jelks et al. 2008). microhabitat use of stream ﬁsh often changes seasonally and spatially. temperate streams are char- acterised by distinct seasonality (e.g., stream discharge and temperature). such seasonality affects the avail- ability of habitat and food, energetic requirements and predation risk for stream ﬁsh, which respond actively or passively by shifting their microhabitat locations (grossman & ratajczak 1998; david & closs 2003; labonne et al. 2003; gillette et al. 2006). lotic habitat also changes spatially in key broad-scale habitat features (e.g., stream size), but many stream ﬁshes occupy a range of habitat conditions that exist longi- tudinally. spatial heterogeneity in broad-scale habitat templates may interact with microhabitat selection of stream ﬁsh, resulting in frequently observed spatial variation in microhabitat use (heggenes 2002;

copp & vilizzi 2004). accord- ingly, studies of microhabitat use of stream ﬁsh should aim to quantify ecological patterns over space and time. hierarchical or mixed models provide a useful framework to quantify variation in microhabitat use among stream sites and seasons. they accommodate and quantify inherent variability among groups (i.e., stream sites and seasons), while accounting for the overall pattern across groups (wagner et al. 2006; gelman & hill 2007; zuur et al. 2009). plus, group- level covariates (i.e., factors that change seasonally and spatially such as stream discharge and tempera- ture) can be included in the model to assess their inﬂuence on the effect size of microhabitat-level covariates (e.g., stream depth and velocity). thus, these models are suitable for quantifying the hierar- chical organisation of stream habitats (fausch et al. 2002; lowe et al. 2006) and their interactions across scales (descheˆnes & rodrı´guez 2007; ebersole et al. 2009). the spotﬁn chub (erimonax monachus) is a small, rare cyprinid endemic to the tennessee river drain- age, usa (jenkins & burkhead 1984). it is typically found in clear, warmwater streams or rivers with moderate gradients. the species is historically known from ﬁve states: alabama, georgia, north carolina, tennessee and virginia. today, spotﬁn chub popula- tions are considered extirpated in two states, and they are restricted to only few tributary systems in north carolina (little tennessee river), tennessee (emory, buffalo and holston rivers) and virginia (north and middle fork holston rivers) (etnier & starnes 1993; jenkins & burkhead 1994; boschung & mayden 2004). spotﬁn chubs were federally listed as threa- tened in 1977 under the u.s. endangered species act, and it is considered endangered in all three states that harbour remaining populations. the declining population status of spotﬁn chub has led to conservation and reintroduction efforts in several rivers within the species’ historical range, but ecological information that can guide species recovery is limited for spotﬁn chubs. adults measure 55-90 mm in standard body length (jenkins & burkhead 1994), and sexual maturity is attained in 1–2 years (boschung & mayden 2004). spawning occurs between may and august, and this crevice-spawning minnow utilises narrow slots and ﬁssures on boulder and bedrock substrate (jenkins & burkhead 1984, 1994). spotﬁn chubs are sight-feeding insectivores, preying predom- inantly on immature benthic aquatic insects (jenkins & burkhead 1984). general habitat descriptions are available in regional ichthyological references (etnier & starnes 1993; jenkins & burkhead 1994), and macro-habitat use was quantiﬁed by russ (2006): spotﬁn chub selected run habitats over boulder and bedrock substrates from spring to fall, but few winter 364 indicated that observations they shifted to pool habitats over sand substrate. microhabitat use of spotﬁn chubs has not been previously quantiﬁed to our knowledge. the goal of this study was to quantify microhabitat use of spotﬁn chub among eight stream sites and three seasons (early summer, late summer and fall) in the emory river watershed, tennessee, usa, one of the last remaining populations of this species. present and absent microhabitats of the species were identiﬁed via snorkelling observations, and an array of microhabitat characteristics were measured (e.g., stream depth, velocity and substrate). a bayesian generalised linear mixed model was used to quantify variation in microhabitat use among stream sites and seasons, and assess the effect of macrohabitat features (stream size and temperature) on the expression of microhab- itat use. in addition to gaining ecological knowledge of this rare stream ﬁsh, this study was motivated by the need to inform conservation and management of aquatic resources in the study area. in particular, a multispecies habitat conservation plan (hcp), a provision under the authority of the u.s. endangered species act, to balance environmental conservation and land devel- opment in this rapidly growing region. the spotﬁn chub is one of the target species that should beneﬁt from the implementation of the multispecies hcp, but effective conservation actions need to be based on the best available scientiﬁc knowledge. is in the process of development materials and methods study areas this study was conducted in 2006 at eight 200-m sites in the emory river watershed located in the cumber- land plateau and cumberland mountain regions of central tennessee, usa (fig. 1). the emory river watershed is generally characterised by clear and conﬁned streams that run through the rugged topog- raphy of the plateau. regional geologic formations are typiﬁed by pennsylvanian-age conglomerate, sand- stone, siltstone and shale covered chieﬂy by well- drained, acidic soils of low fertility. the watershed is predominantly forested along with agriculture, coal mining and urban development, and it is home to a handful of endemic and rare aquatic species, including four mussel species that are federally listed as endangered and one ﬁsh species that is federally listed as threatened (spotﬁn chub). the study area contains characteristic natural areas represented by the obed wild and scenic river and catoosa wildlife man- agement area (fig. 1). a recent watershed-wide survey indicates that it retains ﬁsh community char- acteristics comparable to historical records (russ jjett briddge !!! obed wsr llillyy briddggee !!!!! ooobbedd jjunction !!!!! !!!!! daaaadddddddddyyyss jjunction spotﬁn chub microhabitat use ! study sites streams public land 0 1.25 2.5 ´ 55 kilometers ooollddd rraiillrrooadd briddge !! !!!!!!!!!! nnemo catoosa wma usa e tet nne ssee deeerrmont !!! ooakdddaale !!! fig. 1. map of study sites in the emory river watershed located in tennessee, usa. 2006), but it is faced with an increasing pressure from population growth and land development. late summer eight study sites were selected based on known occurrences of spotﬁn chubs and accessibility, and each site was sampled once in early summer (june 6– 21), (july 24–august 9) and fall (september 17–october 10). the study sites were characteristic of spotﬁn chub macrohabitats in the region (jenkins & burkhead 1984; etnier & starnes 1993). notably, substrate was primarily characterised by bedrock (solid rock) and boulder (256–512 mm) (>50% in each site) with rifﬂe-run-pool sequences. stream size differed among study sites and seasons, ranging 8.8–38.9 m in wetted stream width (table 1). stream temperature at study sites tended to be cooler range, 16.0–25.1 °c) during fall compared to early summer (mean, 26.3 °c; range, 21.0–30.0°c) and late summer (mean, 28.9 °c; range, 26.7–31.0 °c) (table 1). (mean, 19.3 °c; data collection present and absent microhabitats of spotﬁn chubs were identiﬁed via snorkelling at eight 200-m sites across three seasons (early summer, later summer and fall) in 2006. the winter season was not included because russ (2006) observed a total of only 24 individuals during the winter survey despite signiﬁcant efforts to locate ﬁsh in his macrohabitat study. stream snorkel- ling was a reliable and efﬁcient technique for detecting this minnow species, and a noninvasive sampling method was required for the federally threatened species. deep (>1.0 m) and shallow (<0.1 m) areas prevented thorough examinations by snorkelling, and where possible, deep areas were examined by diving and shallow areas were observed from above the water’s surface. this limitation was not considered a signiﬁcant hindrance because spotﬁn chubs are typi- cally found at depths of 0.3–1.0 m (jenkins & burkhead 1984), and pools are not typically occupied except during winter (russ 2006). snorkelling was conducted once per season at each stream site between 0800 and 1700 h and during periods of low turbidity. prior to snorkelling, under- water lateral visibility measurements were recorded using a secchi disc in a nonshaded area. one individual held the secchi disc stationary and com- pletely submerged, while another individual wearing a snorkelling mask moved laterally away from the disc until black and white sections were no longer distin- guishable underwater. followed a snorkelling observations two-step approach, in which present microhabitats were iden- tiﬁed in the ﬁrst snorkelling attempt and then absent microhabitats were determined in the subsequent attempt. during the initial attempt, snorkelling pro- ceeded upstream (larger streams or high gradients) or downstream (smaller streams or low gradients) to locate spotﬁn chub individuals. snorkelling was conducted in a zig-zag fashion by one (smaller sites) or two individuals (larger sites), and snorkelers moved at an average rate of about 100 m per 40 min and communicated to avoid duplicate counts. upon encountering spotﬁn chubs, the snorkeler placed a lead-weighted (142 g) ﬂuorescent ﬂag on the sub- strate, marking the microhabitat location where a ﬁsh or a group of ﬁsh was ﬁrst observed. when multiple individuals were observed within <24 cm of each 365 table 1. macrohabitat characteristics of

points on each of the seven transects. §stream temperature was the mean value across absent microhabitat locations (£21) for each site. other, as visually estimated by the snorkeler, a single ﬂag was placed at the approximate centre location. distances > 24 cm between individuals necessitated the placement of an additional ﬂag. this distance threshold was chosen because direct behavioural interaction was not common when individuals was >24 cm apart (c.u. schmidt, personal observation). a maximum number of 40 markers were placed for present microhabitat locations at each site. number of adults (>50 mm tl) and subadults (<50 mm tl) was recorded at each ﬂag location using a pvc sleeve with a #2 pencil, but the two size classes were lumped together for analysis (see statistical analysis below). two size classes were reliably identiﬁed during snorkelling, and it follows descriptions by jenkins & burkhead (1994). absent microhabitats were identiﬁed following the initial snorkelling attempt for locating present micro- habitats. at each 200-m site, eleven permanent transects (20-m intervals) were established, placed perpendicular to stream ﬂow. seven of eleven tran- sects were selected by discarding four transects in the closest proximity to the greatest number of present microhabitat locations. the wetted width at the seven transects was measured, and ﬁve equidistant points were established along the transects. three of the ﬁve points were randomly chosen as absent microhabitat locations (i.e., maximum of 21 absent locations per site). each absent microhabitat was observed by 366 snorkelling for a minimum of one minute to ensure absence of spotﬁn chubs within a 50-cm radius (turgeon & rodrı´guez 2005). when a spotﬁn chub was observed, the location was discarded and replaced by another randomly selected location along the transect. absence was not recorded on rare occasions when no new suitable absent locations could be established. few sampling occasions had <21 absent microhabitat locations. an identical set of microhabitat variables was recorded at present and absent microhabitats. they were stream depth, velocity, substrate, habitat unit and distance to nearest bank. depth was measured to the nearest cm with a pvc pipe marked in 1-cm increments. velocity was measured at the substrate and at 60% of stream depth (marsh-mcbirney flow- mate model 2000, hatch inc., loveland, co, usa). a single predominant substrate category was visually estimated at the location of each lead weight according to the modiﬁed wentworth scale (mcmahon et al. 1996): bedrock (solid rock), boulder (256–512 mm), cobble (64–256 mm), gravel (2–64 mm) and sand (<2 mm). habitat unit was visually identiﬁed as a rifﬂe, run or pool. distance to nearest bank was calculated perpendicular to ﬂow by measuring from the surface location above the ﬂagged microhabitat to the nearest bank using a bushnell yardage pro rangeﬁnder (bushnell inc., overland park, ks, usa) or a tape measure. statistical analysis the objective of our analysis was to identify micro- habitat covariates that are correlated with pres- ence ⁄ absence of spotﬁn chubs among eight study sites across three seasons. adults (>50 mm tl) and subadults (<50 mm tl) were combined for statistical analysis because of the predominance of adults in our ﬁeld observations. of the total of 507 present micro- habitat observations across stream sites and seasons (see results), <10% (48 observations) were based on microhabitat use of subadults only, while 358 obser- vations were based on adult ﬁsh only and 101 observations included both adults and subadults observed together. in addition, subadult spotﬁn chubs were absent from a stream site (jett bridge) or some seasons at several sites (daddys junction, obed junction and lilly bridge). as a result, adults and subadults data were combined and analysed together in all subsequent analyses. to determine whether categorical microhabitat covariates were assessed by chi-squared tests their proportional composition differed between present and absent locations. data were pooled across stream sites and seasons, and this analysis was intended as an approximate measure of habitat unit and substrate type preferences. a bayesian generalised linear mixed model (glmm) was used to quantify site- and season- speciﬁc effect size of microhabitat covariates on the probability of spotﬁn chub presence and to assess the inﬂuence of macrohabitat covariates (stream size and temperature) on the effect size of microhabitat cova- riates. mixed models can appropriately handle the variance structure when individual observations are nested within broader groups (e.g., microhabitat use observations among stream sites and seasons). it should be stressed that our model does not predict probability of spotﬁn chub presence in an absolute term, but rather it modelled the probability of presence relative to observed absent microhabitats. this is because maximum numbers of observations were (£40 observations) and absent bound for present (£21 observations) microhabitats at each site (see above); therefore, an unknown fraction of available microhabitats was occupied by spotﬁn chubs at each site. a subset of measured microhabitat covariates was used in the glmm to avoid colinearity. the micro- habitat covariates used in the glmm were stream depth (continuous), current velocity at 60% depth (continuous), distance to stream bank (continuous) and substrate type (binary). substrate type was a binary covariate, where it was 1 if bedrock or boulder, and 0 otherwise. the categorisation was because of the preference of spotﬁn chubs for bedrock and boulder spotﬁn chub microhabitat use substrate (see results, and also russ (2006)). to address the issue of potential outliers in continuous microhabitat-scale covariates, the range of values that included 95% of observations was identiﬁed for each continuous covariate. the observations smaller than the 2.5 percentiles were ﬁxed at the 2.5 percentile value, and those larger than 97.5 percentiles were ﬁxed at the 97.5 percentile value. all microhabitat covari- ates were then standardised by subtracting their mean and dividing by two times their standard deviation, so that a one-unit change in the newly created covariates correspond to a change in twice the standard deviation on the original scale. this standardisation is an effective approach when continuous and binary cova- riates are included (gelman & hill 2007). no single pair of standardised microhabitat covariates was strongly correlated with one another (spearman’s rank correlation: rs < 0.2), and the lack of pair-wise correlation was visually conﬁrmed with a scatter plot. the glmm model consisted of two parts. first, the multiple logistic regression model at the microhabitat scale was a ‘varying-intercept, varying-slope’ model (gelman & hill 2007). speciﬁcally, the intercept (a(site[i],season[i])) and slopes (b(site[i],season[i])) were allowed to vary among site · season combinations and speciﬁed as random effects: pr yi ¼ 1 logit pið þ ¼ aðsite½i;season½iþ þ xibxðsite½i;season½iþ ð1þ ð2þ þ ¼ pi ð where yi = 1 denotes the presence of spotﬁn chubs and pi denotes the probability of presence for observation i (i = 1, 2, 3, …, 1003: the total number of present and absent observations among sites and seasons), and xi represents a vector of microhabitat covariates includ- ing stream depth (linear and quadratic terms), current velocity at 60% depth (linear and quadratic), distance to bank (linear and quadratic) and substrate (linear term only) (i.e., vector length of xi = 7). naturally, the vector length of bx was similarly seven (i.e., b1, b2, …, b7). the second component of the glmm was a that quantiﬁed the effect of multiple linear model macrohabitat covariates on the effect size of linear terms of microhabitat covariates: bxðsite;seasonþ ¼ g0:x þ g1:x stream size indexðsite;seasonþ þ g2:x temperatureðsite;seasonþ ð3þ where bx corresponds to site- and season-speciﬁc regression coefﬁcients of linear terms (depth, velocity, distance to bank, and substrate; i.e., x = 1–4) in eq. (2); g0.x indicates intercept terms; g1.x represents 367 kanno et al. coefﬁcients for the ‘stream size index’; and g2.x represents coefﬁcients for stream temperature at each site and each season. the stream size index was calculated as a function of mean wetted width and mean depth for each site · season combination. speciﬁcally, values of each covariate were divided by the maximum observed value for the covariate, and they were then multiplied to assign a measure of stream size for each site · season combination. this was the best available approximation to stream discharge at each site and season in the absence of gauging stations at every stream site. macrohabitat covariates were similarly standardised by subtracting their mean and dividing by two times their standard deviation. the glmm was ﬁtted using markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods in winbugs 1.4 (spiegel- halter et al. 2003) called from r (r development core team 2010) with the r2winbugs package (sturtz et al. 2005). ‘vague’ priors were used throughout the bayesian model; most notably, normal distributions with a mean of zero and a wide variance were used for regression coefﬁcients. marginal posterior distribu- tions of model parameters were estimated by 20,000 iterations of three chains after discarding 5000 burn-in iterations. model convergence was checked by visu- ally examining plots of the mcmc chains for good mixture and using the brooks and gelman diagnostic (brooks & gelman 1998). this statistic compares variance within and between chains, and model was considered to have converged when the value was <1.1 for all model parameters (gelman & hill 2007). effect of microhabitat and macrohabitat covariates was considered statistically signiﬁcant when the 95% credible interval did not overlap with zero. we constructed microhabitat response curves for stream depth and velocity by setting the values of other continuous microhabitat variables at their mean (i.e., 0 because of the standardisation above). the curves were constructed for each stream site and season by specifying the substrate type (bedrock ⁄ boulder or not). results underwater lateral visibility was excellent for snorkel- ling observations, averaging 5.2 m across all stream sites and seasons (range: 1.8–8.6 m). spotﬁn chubs were observed at all eight study sites during all seasons; however, they were more common at downstream sites (nemo, deermont and oakdale) and rare at some upstream sites (jett bridge and lilly bridge) (table 2 and fig. 1). across the eight study sites, we recorded a total of 155 present microhabitats (660 individuals) during early summer, 195 present microhabitats (753 individuals) during late summer and 157 present microhabitats (552 individuals) during fall (table 2). 368 table 2. count of present and absent spotﬁn microhabitats at eight stream sites during three seasons. early summer late summer fall stream site present absent present absent present absent nemo deermont oakdale old railroad bridge daddys junction obed junction jett bridge lilly bridge total 16 39 40 15 15 20 6 4 155 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 168 40 40 40 24 26 8 7 10 195 18 9 21 21 21 21 21 21 153 40 40 40 11 14 5 5 2 157 16 18 21 21 21 21 21 21 160 spotﬁn chubs occupied a wide range of stream depth, current velocity and distance to stream bank. across the eight study sites, spotﬁn chubs were present at stream depths ranging 9–85 cm (mean 33 cm), current velocity at 60% depth ranging 0–0.88 mæs)1 (mean 0.24 mæs)1) and distance to bank ranging 0.9–25.0 m (mean 8.3 m) during early sum- mer. in late summer, they were observed at depths 5–73 cm (mean 31 cm), current velocity at 60% depth 0–1.05 mæs)1 (mean 0.20 mæs)1) and distance to bank 0.9–19.0 m (mean 7.1 m). in fall, they were observed at depths 9–82 cm (mean 37 cm), current velocity at 60% depth 0–0.61 mæs)1 (mean 0.19 mæs)1) and distance to bank 0.3–22.1 m (mean 7.0 m). during the course of this study, spotﬁn chubs were observed at all types of habitat units (runs, rifﬂes and pools) and all types of substrate (bedrock, boulder, cobble and gravel) except sand, which was inherently limited in the study stream sites (fig. 2). however, spotﬁn chubs were more likely to be present at runs (v2 = 193.2827, d.f. = 2, p-value < 0.0001; data pooled across sites and seasons), and bedrock and boulder substrates (v2 = 173.2029, data pooled across sites and seasons) (fig. 2). d.f. = 4, p-value < 0.0001; the bayesian glmm identiﬁed some general microhabitat use patterns exhibited by spotﬁn chubs, but patterns also varied among stream sites and seasons. in general, spotﬁn chubs were more likely to be present in microhabitats characterised by boul- der ⁄ bedrock substrates, high to medium velocity, and medium depth (table 3; figs 3 and 4). bedrock and boulder substrate was the most consistently used microhabitat across stream sites and seasons, and its regression coefﬁcient was signiﬁcantly positive in 18 of 24 site · season combinations (table 3). this pattern is graphically observable when the predicted probabil- ity of spotﬁn chub presence is compared between bedrock ⁄ boulder versus cobble ⁄ gravel ⁄ sand substrate (compare left versus right columns on figs 3 and 4). the middle range of stream depth was generally favoured by spotﬁn chubs. the quadratic term of stream depth was signiﬁcantly negative in half of 24 fig. 2.

leading to the dome-shaped relationship between stream depth and predicted probability of spotﬁn chub presence (fig. 3). the linear term of stream depth was signiﬁcantly positive at nemo and old railroad bridge sites in fall, but it was signiﬁcantly negative at obed junction site in late summer (table 3). a seasonal pattern was observed for the effect of current velocity. high-velocity microhabitats were used in early summer, when the linear term of current velocity at 60% depth was signiﬁcantly positive at six of eight study sites (table 3 & fig. 4). spotﬁn chubs occupied high-velocity microhabitats in late summer as well (four sites with signiﬁcantly positive effect size), but no stream sites were characterised with signiﬁcantly positive coefﬁcients in fall (table 3). similar to stream depth, the quadratic term of current velocity was predominantly negative, but only a total of four sites had statistically signiﬁcant values across seasons (table 3). distance to stream bank was by far the least important microhabitat covariate tested in the glmm. only one linear and one quadratic term were statis- tically signiﬁcant for this microhabitat covariate, and the direction of coefﬁcients had a mixture of positive and negative signs (table 3). the bayesian glmm identiﬁed a couple of inter- actions between microhabitat and macrohabitat cova- riates (table 4 and fig. 5). first, the stream size index, a macrohabitat covariate, was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with the logistic regression coefﬁcient of bedrock ⁄ boulder substrate (table 4). it indicated that 369 kanno et al. boulder/bedrock substrate in spring cobble/gravel/sand substrate in spring 8 . 0 4 . 0 0 . 0 e c n e s e r p f o y t i l i b a b o r p 8 . 0 4 0 . 0 . 0 8 0 . 4 . 0 0 0 . 8 . 0

spotﬁn chubs more likely used bedrock ⁄ boulder substrate at smaller stream sites, but substrate type did not inﬂuence microhabitat use as strongly at larger stream sites (fig. 5a). second, while nearly statisti- cally signiﬁcant, stream temperature (a macrohabitat covariate) tended to be positively correlated with the effect size of current velocity (table 4). that is, spotﬁn chubs tended to select higher velocity micro- habitats at warmer stream temperatures (typically early and late summer: see table 1), but velocity was less important at cooler temperatures (fall) (fig. 5b). discussion overall, spotﬁn chubs were more likely to be present in microhabitats characterised by boulder ⁄ bedrock substrates, high to medium velocity, and medium 370 depth. however, our analysis highlighted variation in microhabitat use of spotﬁn chubs among stream sites and seasons. spatial and temporal variation in micro- habitat use of stream ﬁsh, particularly stream salmo- nids, has been commonly reported (e.g., heggenes 2002; ayllo´n et al. 2010). however, plasticity in microhabitat use has been observed less frequently for rare stream ﬁsh (e.g., labonne et al. 2003; copp & vilizzi 2004), although the lack of such ﬁndings may be due partly to the sampling issue of rare species such as geographically limited distribution and low detec- tion rates. the general patterns of microhabitat use identiﬁed by the glmm are congruent with previous ﬁndings that spotﬁn chubs prefer run habitats from spring to fall (jenkins & burkhead 1984; etnier & starnes 1993; russ 2006). relative to rifﬂe

relationships between macrohabitat covariates and microhabitat covariates: (a) stream size index versus mean regression coefﬁcient values of stream depth, and (b) stream temperature versus mean regression coefﬁcient values of current velocity at 60% depth. were inherently characterised by medium depth, high- velocity and bedrock ⁄ boulder substrate in the study sites. it is then not surprising that these microhabitat covariates were identiﬁed as important in the glmm. stream ﬁsh typically select microhabitat locations based on a combination of microhabitat characteristics (mattingly et al. 2003; hazelton & grossman 2009) to maximise survival or growth rates during nonspaw- ning seasons (skalski & gilliam 2002; sotiropoulos et al. 2006). it can be assumed that this benthic insectivorous minnow maximises food intake and minimises predation risk by occupying medium depth and mid to high-velocity microhabitats from early summer to fall. in addition, spotﬁn chubs spawn within narrow slots and ﬁssures on boulder and bedrock substrate between may and august (jenkins & burkhead 1984, 1994), which corresponded to early and late summer in this study. during these seasons, spotﬁn chubs may have preferentially selected boulder and bedrock for spawning as well. 371 kanno et al. that the observed interactions between microhabitat and macrohabitat covariates suggest research on microhabitat use and other ecological responses of stream ﬁsh should consider the ‘contextual’ effect (holm et al. 2001; vilizzi et al. 2004; xu et al. 2010). substrate type was the most consistently important microhabitat covariate across stream sites and seasons, but its importance still varied by stream size. specif- ically, spotﬁn chubs were more likely to use bed- rock ⁄ boulder substrate at smaller stream sites (where they were less common), but they were less selective of substrate type at larger stream sites (where they were abundant). this pattern of microhabitat use may be either active or passive. in smaller stream sites, suitable microhabitats may be inherently limited, and few individuals that the most suitable microhabitat available associated with bed- rock ⁄ boulder substrate. in contrast, higher densities of spotﬁn chubs at larger stream sites may indicate overall favourable environmental conditions, and individuals may occupy seemingly less preferred microhabitats (e.g., cobble and gravel). this may be why the importance of bedrock ⁄ boulder substrate was not evident at larger stream sites in our analysis. remain may select spotﬁn chubs tended to use higher velocity micro- habitats at warmer stream temperatures, although this pattern was not statistically signiﬁcant. stream tem- perature at study sites was nearly comparable between early summer and late summer, but it was noticeably cooler during fall (see table 1). early and late summer were the spawning season for spotﬁn chubs (jenkins & burkhead 1984, 1994), and our results suggest that they may select and deposit eggs within bedrock and boulder ﬁssures with high current velocities to avoid egg suffocation from potential sedimentation. in the meantime, the reduced importance of high-velocity microhabitats during fall is likely indicative of lower activity levels under cooler temperatures. russ (2006) found that spotﬁn chubs were hard to locate under- water during winter, but they were found in pool habitats over sand substrate on the few observed occasions (stream temperature range: 2.2–3.8 °c). a similar seasonal shift in microhabitat use has been observed in other lotic ﬁsh, particularly stream salmonids (bardonnet & baglinie`re 2000; huusko et al. 2007). this study aimed to assess as many microhabitat covariates as practicable, but other unmeasured factors may also inﬂuence microhabitat use of spotﬁn chubs. first, interspeciﬁc interactions were not assessed in this study, but they may or may not affect microhabitat use of stream ﬁsh (santos et al. 2004; hazelton & grossman 2009; crow et al. 2010). only occasionally did other species of minnows behaviourally compete with spotﬁn chubs during the course of this study (c.u. schmidt, personal observation). however, in the 372 emory river watershed, spotﬁn chubs would likely face competition from species such as whitetail shiners (cyprinella galactura), spotﬁn shiners (cyprinella spiloptera) and warpaint shiners (luxilus coccogenis). these species exhibit more aggressive and ﬂexible feeding behaviour relative to spotﬁn chubs (jenkins & burkhead 1984; etnier & starnes 1993). in addition, spotﬁn chubs would be at greater risk of predation from species such as smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu) and could avoid microhabitats with preda- tory ﬁsh. second, we combined data from adults (>50 mm) and subadults (<50 mm) because the majority of ﬁeld observations were made on adults, and subadults were not present in all study sites. however, ontogenetic microhabitat shifts are common among stream ﬁsh (copp & vilizzi 2004; henderson & johnston 2010). subadults were commonly ob- served to school with adults in this study (c.u. schmidt, personal observation), but the predominance of adults in our observations in itself may suggest that subadults utilise microhabitats that are difﬁcult to locate underwater. microhabitat use data of stream ﬁsh are frequently collected to inform stream habitat and ﬂow manage- ment decisions. for example, the physical habitat simulation (phabsim) combines ﬁeld-collected data on microhabitat use and physical habitat models to quantify weighted useable habitat areas over a range of discharge levels (jowett 1997). in this application, microhabitat suitability of stream ﬁsh is typically assumed to remain unchanged across space and time, but habitat suitability models often perform poorly when they are applied to different streams or seasons (holm et al. 2001; anderson et al. 2006). the varying importance of some microhabitat covariates as a function of macrohabitat characteristics observed in the current study explains partly why such an approach might not be transferable across space and time. the glmm provided a useful framework for understanding potential interactions between micro- habitat and macrohabitat covariates. without macro- habitat-level predictors (i.e., stream size index and temperature), this important pattern would have been masked and instead it would have been treated as unexplained variation among stream sites and seasons. in fact, conclusions on microhabitat use of stream ﬁsh may much depend on study designs. that is, when data are collected in a spatially and temporally extensive manner and when they are analysed to account the researcher may likely ﬁnd spatial and temporal heterogeneity in microhabitat use and conclude that the studied stream ﬁsh is a habitat generalist (e.g., ayllo´n et al. 2010). however, studies based on a limited set of locations and times may well highlight site- or time-speciﬁc patterns, and the species may be for patterns across space and time, considered as a habitat specialist (e.g., van snik gray & stauffer 1999). we recommend that studies of microhabitat use attempt to understand patterns across space and time where possible and quantify how such patterns are explained. the federally threatened status and continuing decline of spotﬁn chubs argues for conservation actions based on the best available science. a major conclusion of this study is that spotﬁn chubs are associated with microhabitat characteristics most typ- ical of runs between early summer and fall. therefore, maintaining the integrity of type is paramount and relevant in this ‘water-limited’ region of the cumberland plateau. streams in the study region receive little groundwater input because of its well-drained soils, and wadeable streams are typically characterised with series of isolated pools during summer baseﬂow. hydrological alteration such as water withdrawals could reduce and degrade suitable run habitats for spotﬁn chubs. this habitat this study also highlights the importance of seasonal- and site-speciﬁc patterns of microhabitat use by spotﬁn chubs. the somewhat ﬂexible micro- habitat use suggests that scientiﬁc efforts should focus on identifying and protecting available suitable habitat across space and time. prudent conservation measures would discourage alteration of the range of microhab- itat conditions used by spotﬁn chubs in our study. it should also be noted that winter habitat use of this species appears to differ; russ (2006) observed spotﬁn chubs in pools over sand substrate during winter. finally, additional research needs to be conducted to evaluate if anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., land development and water withdrawals) impact micro- habitat use of spotﬁn chubs in the emory river watershed. for example, increased suspended sedi- mentation is known to affect physiology and growth of spotﬁn chubs (sutherland & meyer 2007; sutherland et al. 2008), thereby potentially affecting microhabitat use and subsequently altering population-level pro- cesses (e.g., survival). in conclusion, spotﬁn chubs were, in general, more likely to be present in microhabitats characterised by bedrock and boulder substrates, medium to high velocity, and medium depth (most typically run habitats). the greatest afﬁnity was observed for bedrock and boulder substrate. however, the patterns were not necessarily consistent among the stream sites and seasons, and spotﬁn chubs appear to exhibit ﬂexible microhabitat use to some extent. this study suggests that some variation in microhabitat use among stream sites and seasons may be explained by macrohabitat characteristics that change spatially and temporally. quantifying this type of interaction across scales can advance our understanding of complex species-habitat relationships. spotﬁn chub microhabitat use acknowledgements this
