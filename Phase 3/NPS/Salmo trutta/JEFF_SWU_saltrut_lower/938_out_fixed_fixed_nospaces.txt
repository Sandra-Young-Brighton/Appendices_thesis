(sex ratios throughout this article are given as (male num- berdfemale numbers)). methods detailed accounts of the fishing and processing methods for the windermere perch and pike fisheries are given by bagenal (1972), frost & kipling (1959, 1961, 1967), le cren (1987) and le cren et al. (1977). sampling has occurred in both the north and south basins of the lake. temperature records (from 1941 to 1990) were taken from the windermere database of the freshwater biological association (fba) / insti- tute of freshwater ecology (ife). lake surface temperature records were collected daily and weekly mean temperatures calculated. the week- ly records of the calendar year were then aver- aged (arithmetic mean) into five 10-week blocks (quintiles) approximately corresponding to the lake’s winter, spring, early summer, late summer and autumn respectively. perch perch have been collected by trapping for a 6-week period, normally from mid-april to may or june each year from 1941 to the present. a commercial fishery lasted until 1947 in the north basin and un- til 1964 in the south basin of the lake, since when a limited scientific sampling programme has con- tinued. fishing effort has been measured as the number of traps used over a 6-week period and since 1965 has remained approximately constant at 20. five traps are laid at each of three sites in the south basin of the lake and at one site in the north basin. the traps are set in perch spawning areas and whilst not size selective within a 90- to 300- mm range (le cren et al. 1977), are strongly male biased as males appear first and persist longer on the spawning grounds. primarily, adults are caught with occasional immature females. the smallest catch analyzed consisted of 134 fish in 1977 but in most years there were in excess of 1000 fish. the data analyzed here were from 1965 to 1997, giving a total of 33 years. individual mass data were avail- able from 1969 to 1986. sex ratio changes in windermere pike pike were fished using gill nets (64-mm mesh) nor- mally within the period 1 october to 1 march the following year. from 1980, nets have generally been set from mid-october to mid-december. each season is referred to by two years e.g., 1944- 1945. the duration and area of the net set and hence fishing effort has varied from year to year (measured as net days; a 30-yard (27.43 m), 3-m- deep net set for 24 h), but fishing methods have remained essentially the same. windermere pike gill netting is generally biased for females as they grow faster and have greater girth than males (frost & kipling 1967). in the early years of the fishery when removal of pike was the main aim (worthington 1950), nets were set in areas where pike were caught regularly and relocated when no more pike were caught at that locality (frost & kipling 1967). in more recent years, nets were usually placed in the same localities each year re- gardless of the number of fish caught. since 1992- 1993, fishing effort has been constant. pike netting started in the winter of 1943-1944, and data were collected every year. however, only catch data and no effort statistics are available for the season 1946-1947, when the nets were temporarily frozen in position by extensive ice cover. the smallest an- nual catch analyzed consisted of 59 fish but catches were normally easily in excess of 100 fish. the latest available data were from the season 1997- 1998; therefore, the total number of years in the pike catch analysis was 54. in addition to the calculation of the sex ratio of the annual catch, the sex ratio was also derived from the accumulated pike of known year classes from 1935-1984. year class data were available up to 1989, but as females were caught earlier than males because of their faster growth, the later years were omitted to avoid biasing the results. pike catch per unit effort (cpue) per year class per annum was also analyzed as a test of vulner- ability changes (see below). statistical analysis long-term trends in sex ratios were tested using armitage’s method for the analysis of linear trends amongst proportions (zar 1996). this test is sensi- tive to differences in sample size between years un- like a linear regression of sex ratio against time. sex ratio data were cross-correlated with fishing effort and temperature as well as autocorrelated. as there is evidence of separation between the populations of perch in windermere (kipling & le cren 1984; bodaly et al. 1989), perch data were analyzed separately for each basin of the lake as 79 paxton et al. well as for the lake as a whole. as pike move be- tween basins (kipling 1984), only the sex ratio of pike for the whole lake was considered. sex ratio and catch-derived (cpue, fishing effort etc.) data were in (x) transformed prior to parametric analy- sis to normalize the residuals. the timing of the start of the fishing season was investigated as a factor affecting sex ratio. this has varied through time and may be correlated with changes in capture efficiency related to the early appearance of one sex at the sampling sites, or with physical, or chemical changes in water quality, such as water transparency, which varies through time but which shows marked periodicity (ife/ fba unpublished data). similarly, mass and cross- sectional area (csa, approximated as madlength) of the individual fish were also investigated within the pike fishery as changes in these variables would reflect the well documented changes in pike growth rate through time (frost & kipling 1967) and may well affect capture efficiency. after the majority of a year class has reached sufficient size to be fished, there should be a de- cline in cpue from year to year as fewer fish are available to catch (c.f. perch, le cren et al. 1977). the in (cpue) of each year class of pike (1943- 1985) was analyzed after its peak catch (4 growing seasons, or aged 3 years for females, 5 growing sea- sons or aged 4 for males) for any non-systematic decline as a test of significant yearly changes in vulnerability. data (in cpue per year class per year) were analyzed separately for each sex in a general linear model of a two-way analysis of vari- ance with sample order (year of modal catch of that year class and 2 years thereafter) as a covari- ate and year class as a discrete variable (software: minitab v. 12). where x variables showed significant evidence of autocorrelation or a trend, which can lead to spurious significant cross correlation with similarly autocorrelated or trendy y variables (jenkins 1979), such effects were removed either by taking residuals of the variable by regression against the relevant lag or by placing the appropriately lagged data in the model. this was the case for the in (perch sex ratio), in (pike sex ratio), the first four quintile temperatures, in (cpue) of pike, in (male pike mass/ female pike mass), in pike (male pike csa/female pike csa), in (pike fishing effort), (in catch pike) and the week of commencement of pike fishing. results perch sex ratios through time are given for the north and south basins and for the entire lake (fig. 1). the 80 '1 - 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 fishing season fig. i. changes in the in (sex ratio) perch from 1965 to 1997 from the trap fishery. solid line: all lake sex ratio; long dashed line; north basin sex ratio; short dashed line: south basin sex ratio. geometric mean sex ratio (maledfemales) was 9.65. there was negligible evidence for a trend in sex ratios through time for either the separate basins or over the entire lake until a steep fall in 1977 following a sharp reduction of the population by perch disease in late 1976 (bucke et al. 1979), which seems to have differentially affected male catch (fig. 1). this fall appears to be followed by a slow fluctuating recovery back to pre-disease levels (fig. l., north basin from 1977: linear trend x2= 937, df=l, p<o.ool, south basin from 1977: x2= 1339, df=l, p<o.ool, all lake from 1977: linear trend x2=2303, df= 1, p<o.ool). sex ratios of the perch of the north & south ba- sins were strongly correlated (df=31, r=0.71, p<o.ool). over the whole lake and in the two ba- sins, there was a significant autocorrelation be- tween sex ratio for the sample year and the two previous years (all lake: previous year; df=30, r= 0.53, p<o.ol, previous year but one; df=29, r= 0.53 p<o.ol, north basin: previous year; df=30, r=0.56, p<o.ol, previous year but one; df=29, r= 0.57, p<o.ol, south basin: previous year; df=30, r=0.36, p<0.05, previous year but one; df=29, r= 0.39, p<0.05). the effects of these autocorrela- tions were removed prior to further parametric analysis. over both basins (north basin: r= -0.47, df= 16, p<0.05; south basin: r= -0.53, df= 16, iy0.05) and the whole lake (r=-0.52, df=16, p<0.05) perch sex ratio was inversely related to the ratio of mean individual mass of males to the mean indi- vidual mass of females. the years of low sex ratio (the immediate aftermath of 1976) supported rela- tively more females than males than before but with individual female mass relative to males sharply reduced. from 1976 to 1986, the mean mass of males and females trapped was approxi- mately equal. hence, it is unlikely that the changes in sex ratio were due to males simply falling below the 90-mm lower threshold for the traps and so not being caught, but rather to differential mortality or behaviour of males relative to females through time. over the south basin and the whole lake, cpue in a given year was highly correlated with sex ratio, (all lake: df=29, r=0.52, p<o.ol, south basin: df= 29, r=0.67, p<o.ol), although no correlation was found in the north basin (df=29, r=0.28, ns). as the coefficient of variation for male cpue over the whole lake (0.72) was larger than that for fe- males (0.61), it is reasonable to conclude that the variation in sex ratio was due more to fluctuating male numbers than to fluctuating female numbers. there was no evidence that the occasional minor changes in fishing effort had any effect on the sex ratio in the catch year or in subsequent years. there was no evidence that mean temperature in any of the five quintiles (winter and spring of sample year, previous early and late summer and autumn quintiles of previous year) predicted perch sex ratio in either the whole lake (r2=0.12, f5,23= 0.66, ns), north basin (r2=0.06, fs,23=0.29, ns) or south basin (?=0.16, f5,23=0.86, ns), nor was there any cross-correlation of seasonal tempera- ture and subsequent sex ratio. perch sex ratio generally altered within the sam- pling season, with proportionately more females caught later in the season (all lake: f1,130=48.7, p<o.ool), although the exact trend varied from year to year (all lake: f3,,,,,=3.0, p<o.ool). de- spite this, the small amount of variation in com- mencement of the sampling period had no effect on the overall sex ratio for the year (all lake: f,,29= 0.27, ns, north basin: f1,,,=0.03, ns, south basin: f1,29=0.01, ns). pike the sex ratio in the catches of the pike fishery is given in fig. 2. the pike catch data show a geo- metric mean sex ratio (male/female) during the period of study of 0.763. there was no evidence of any significant periodicity in the pike catch sex ratio time series, except for a correlation with the sex ratio of the previous year (r=0.31, df=50, p<0.05). the effect of this autocorrelation was re- moved prior to further parametric analysis. there was a just insignificant upward trend in the proportion of males (1943-1997: x2=3.1, df= 1, p<o.l) through time. however, if the first three years of data are omitted (comprising the initial response of a largely unexploited population and the break in data for 1946-1947), then there is a significant trend (from season 1947-1948: x2= 14. i, sex

p<o.ool). despite this putative linear trend, there was significant deviation around it in some years (from season 1947-1948: x2=250.5, df=49, p<o.ool). pike sex ratio was uncorrelated with fishing effort both in the sample year (r=0.16, df= 50, ns) and the previous year (r=0.01, df=48, ns). sex ratio was uncorrelated with either the spring, early or late summer, autumn or winter temperatures immediately prior to and during sampling. sex ratio was negatively correlated with cpue (r=0.34, df=50, p<0.05) but there was no significant regression of fishing effort, total catch or their interaction upon sex ratio (r2=0.092, f3,48=1.63, ns). there was no significant corre- lation between the start of gill netting and sex ratio but there was a significant relationship between the ratio of male mass to female mass at capture and sex ratio (r2=0.097, f1,50=5.34, p<0.05). how- ever, the effect is negative and thus cannot explain long-term changes in the catch sex ratio. similar results were found for cross-sectional area (csa), where there was a just nonsignificant negative re- lationship of sex ratio to male csnfemale csa (r2=0.069, f1,4,=3.6, p<o.l). there was the possi- bility that male and female size increased but be- cause of the size threshold of the gill nets this would lead to an proportional increase in the num- ber of males in the gill nets but no change in the size based sex ratios (i.e. mass and csa). however, there was no significant relationship between sex ratio and male csa alone (r2=0.066, f1,48=3.4, p<o. 1). year (i.e. the trend) and cpue, despite signifi- cant effect (f2,49=6.57, p<o.ol), together ex- plained only 21.1% of the variation in pike fishery sex ratio. changes in the sex ratio of pike by year class are given in fig. 3. unsurprisingly, the sex ratio of pike by year class correlated with the pike fishery sex ratio 3 years later (r=0.41, df=42, p<o.oi), as 81 paxton et al. to year (females: f41,42=2.2, p<o.ol). both year class (males: f42,43= 10.4, p<o.ool, females: f41,42= 12.8, p<o.ool) and sample order (males: f1,43= 259.4, p<o.o01, females: f1,42=493.3, p<o.ool) were significant. 0 1940 1950 1960 t970 1980 1

geometric mean sex ratio (male/female) during the period of study of 0.797. the sex ratio of pike by year class was significantly correlated with the year class sex ratio from the previous year (r=0.46, df=47, p=o.ool). the effect of this autocorrelation was removed prior to further parametric analysis. there was no overall trend in proportion to- wards greater numbers of males from the 1935 year df=l, ns), but class males (all years: ~ ~ ~ 0 . 0 1 , there was an upward trend from the 1943 year class (x2=7.60, df= 1, p<o.ol), the first year class to be hatched during the fishery. there was also a sig- nificant deviation from the linear trend in some years (x2=98.9, df=40, p<o.ool). year class sex ratio was predicted by the quintile temperatures in the natal year (r2=0.26, f5,39=2.7, p<0.05), al- though because of covariance between seasonal (quintile) temperatures, it is difficult to determine which period(s) are important. however the sec- ond quintile (spring) temperatures have the largest positive (i.e. higher temperatures lead to pro- portionately more males) single effect (r2=0. 13, f1,43=6.2, p<0.02). year class sex ratio was corre- lated with the ratio of male mass to female mass (r2=0.09, f1,47=4.6, p<0.05) and male csa to fe- male csa mass (r2=0.092, f1,47=4.7, p<0.05), but again the relationship was negative. there was no relationship of year class sex ratio and csa of males alone (r2=0.002, f1,47=0.1 1, ns). analysis of the decline in pike cpue for the year classes 1943-1985, males and 1944-1985 fe- males (fig. 4) revealed no evidence of any changes in male vulnerability (i.e. in terms of numbers caught) between different year classes across differ- ent years (i.e. the interaction of sample order and year class (f42,43= 1.5, ns)). in contrast, females showed weak but significant change in vulner- ability (measured as changes in cpue) from year 82 discussion there have been long-term changes in sex ratio of both perch and pike during parts of the present study period. it is not directly possible to deter- mine the actual population sex ratio from year to year but, given that the effects of growth and changes in the timing of sampling have been ac- counted for, it is reasonable to assume that the analyses presented here reflects relative changes in the behavior or the demographics of the fish popu- lations. even ignoring the effects of the 1976 disease event, the perch fishery sex ratio showed consider- able fluctuation. these fluctuations were correlated across basins within a given year and autocorrelat- ed from year to year. this implies that they were not solely caused by local changes in vulnerability to the traps, but may have reflected lake-wide characteristic(s). male perch appear first on the spawning grounds, and spawning in perca is at least partially initiated by rising spring temperatures (hokanson 1977). therefore, it might be thought that high spring temperature would bring forward spawning, which would mean that sampling occurred effec- tively later in the spawning run and thus lead to proportionately more females being trapped. how- ever, none of the observed changes in sex ratio ap- pear to represent such an artifact caused by sam- pling period varying within the spawning season. there is no evidence for any long-term trend in i -7 1 , 3 i 4 age (years old) 5 1- - 6 fig. 4. mean decline in pike gillnet in (cpue) for each year class (males 1943-1985, solid line between 4 and 6, females 19441985, solid line between 3 and 5 ) and four of the most variable female year classes (dashed lines with symbols) the sex ratios of the perch fishery except from 1977 after the effects wrought by the perch disease in late 1976. this increased the proportion of females in the fishery and it took at least 15 years for the population to return to the pre- 1976 proportions (figure 1). such male-biased disease mortality is not unknown in perch. it may be that, as in other animal species, males are more immunosuppressed than females (folstad & karter 1992), leading to a higher occurrence of disease especially during breeding. for example, male mortality is higher than female mortality among percaflavescens mit- chill of lake dauphin, manitoba, and this appears to be associated with higher infestation of the liver/ intestinal nematode, raphidascaris acus among males (szalai & dick 1991). within the pike fishery, despite the almost con- sistently female-biased sex ratio, there was a drift to- wards proportionately more males through time (both in the annual fishery catch and since 1943, in year classes). there were also considerable fluctu- ations, as has been reported from other localities (e.g. lake oahe, usa, june 1971). the overall fe- male bias reflects the larger size and faster growth of females and greater susceptibility to capture (frost & kipling 1967), although the true sex ratio within the lake was not known. kipling & frost (1970) estimated that the real sex ratio (maledfe- males) varied around 1 , rising to as high as 1.78 in 1963. data from other lakes suggest a slightly male- biased or equal sex ratio especially at younger ages, with perhaps a slight female bias at larger sizes (re- viewed by raat 1988). kipling & frost (1970) pro- vided evidence from tagged fish that there was greater male than female natural mortality. not- withstanding greater male mortality, the earlier maturation of male pike would, all other things being equal, lead to a male biased operational sex ratio, which has been reported from the field else- where (e.g. franklin & smith 1963; clark 1950). do at least some of the fluctuations in pike sex ratio observed within the fisheries reflect real changes within the population? the data were cor- related from year to year. this suggests that changes in the sex ratio of the fishery were due to real changes in the population or some other biological feature, rather than to transient changes in vulnerability. this was partially supported by the steady exponential decline in male cpue seen in every year class (fig. 4). even in the case of females, despite significant abnormal years (fig. 4), decline is normally exponential and unvarying. what is the explanation for the long-term trend in pike sex ratio? there was no detectable evidence of increases in biomass or cross-sectional area on the part of one sex more than the other that might cause such a trend. there has also been a decreas- sex ratio changes in windermere ing fishing effort through time, but the intensity of fishing effort does not correlate with the sex ratio within a given year. a relatively high cpue in the sample year was associated with a higher pro- portion of females, but there has been no down- ward linear trend in cpue through time (e.g. fba/ife unpublished data). initially, cpue was high because the largely unexploited population was abundant. then cpue sharply declined be- cause of high fishing effort, but has generally in- creased in recent years. with a lack of alternative hypotheses for the long-term trend in pike sex ratio it would appear that the apparent changes were due either to an alteration in the true sex ratio of the windermere pike population or to an artifact caused by a change in behavior. there remains the intriguing correlation of year-class sex ratio and spring temperature of the natal year, and the spring and summer temperatures of windermere have increased significantly over the last 50 years (personal observation on ife/fba unpublished data), and there is now considerable evidence for temperature-based sex determination amongst fishes (see introduction). alternatively, there could be some temperature based differential mortality early in life. further investigation of the sex ratios of 0-year fish would be useful, as would analysis the relative year class strengths of males and fe- males. in addition to temperature changes, there has been sustained selective pressure by the fishery against the faster-growing, larger female pike. thus a long-term shift towards to proportionately more males may reflect an evolutionary response (either by behavior or by an alteration in sex deter- mination mechanisms) to sex-selective “predation” from the pike fishery, if this hypothesis is correct, sex ratio may continue to drift towards a greater proportion of males even if fishing effort and tem- perature remain constant. the results indicate that the normally unstated assumption of short-term fluctuations around a stable mean sex ratio needs to be re-evaluated in at least two widespread temperate fish species. this would appear to be especially the case in dynamic environments where there can be disease, sex-selec- tive “predation” or long-term environmental change. resumen 1. los datos de pesquerias de percafluviutilis (1965-1997) y esox lucius (1943-1997) en windermere ponen de manifiesto la existencia de grandes variaciones en la
