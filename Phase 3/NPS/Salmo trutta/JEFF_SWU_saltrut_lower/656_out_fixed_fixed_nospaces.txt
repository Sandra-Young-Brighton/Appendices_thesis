shoaling; minnow; inter-individual variability; chub introduction the amount of time an animal devotes to different daily activities (e.g., feeding, resting, exploring, and courtship) may be inﬂuenced by extrinsic factors such as temperature, light intensity, food availability and predators (metcalfe et al. 1999; belovsky et al. 2011; nowicki et al. 2012), and by intrinsic factors such as body size, sex, physical condition and group size (sharpe & rosell 2003; pelletier & festa-bian- chet 2004; white & warner 2007). extrinsic and intrinsic factors may operate independently or in con- cert to inﬂuence individual behavior (belovsky & slade 1986; alan€ar€a et al. 2001; david & closs 2003), though the nature and strength of these inﬂu- ences remains poorly understood. clarifying the fac- tors that inﬂuence behavior may be particularly it important for endangered species for it may provide information required for proper and effective conser- vation (buchholz 2007). despite recent advances in the study of ﬁsh activity patterns, very little is known about individual behav- iors of non-game species, especially cyprinids. this is unfortunate because cyprinids represent one of the most diverse taxa of freshwater ﬁshes worldwide (nelson 2006). most studies of activity patterns have focused on sport or commercially important species such as salmonids (e.g., fraser et al. 1993; bradford & higgins 2001; breau et al. 2007; baktoft et al. 2012), which differ substantially from most cyprinids in life history attributes, ecological requirements and population dynamics (rochet et al. 2000). conse- quently, to infer general patterns of behavior solely from information on these species. is difﬁcult correspondence: joana martelo, centro de biologia ambiental, departamento de biologia animal, faculdade de ci^encias de lisboa, campo grande, bloco c2, 1749-016 lisboa, portugal e-mail: jmmartelo@fc.ul.pt doi: 10.1111/eff.12027 307 j. martelo et al. moreover, there is a lack of information on the fac- tors that inﬂuence the amount of time individuals spent on any speciﬁc activity, even for commercial ﬁshes. hence, there is a great need for studies that help advance our understanding of freshwater ﬁsh behavior. because ﬁshes are ectotherms, they generally become more active when temperatures increase, either spending more time foraging or exhibiting fas- ter swimming and attack rates (weetman et al. 1998; marchand et al. 2002; linløkken et al. 2010). how- ever, the effects of temperature on activity may vary, with some species shifting from nocturnal to diurnal foraging as temperatures rise (fraser et al. 1993; greenwood & metcalfe 1998; breau et al. 2007), although many species retain fairly constant activity patterns regardless of temperature (gries et al. 1997; david & closs 2003; baktoft et al. 2012). besides temperature, other extrinsic factors may inﬂuence ﬁsh activity. many streams experience strong and unpre- dictable ﬂuctuations in physical and biological condi- tions. variation may occur in the form of both seasonal and annual changes in ﬂow as well as the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as ﬂoods and droughts (moyle & vondracek 1985; grossman & ratajczak 1998; lake 2000). this may cause ﬁsh activity to vary both seasonally and annu- ally (thompson et al. 2001), although most studies have focused only on analyzing seasonal variation in behaviors within a single year (e.g., lucas & batley 1996; bremset 2000; david & closs 2003; reeves et al. 2010). intrinsic factors such as body and shoal size also are important factors to include in analyses of activity patterns of ﬁshes. because metabolic rates and the scope for growth decline with increasing body size (brett & groves 1979), smaller individuals may spend more time foraging than larger individuals (bradford & higgins 2001; imre & boisclair 2004; busch & mehner 2012). shoal size may inﬂuence an individual’s perception of potential competitors (pitcher & parrish 1993; grand & dill 1999), with ﬁsh in large shoals experiencing a reduction in food intake and typically allocating more time to foraging and searching than ﬁsh in smaller shoals (pitcher et al. 1982; pitcher & parrish 1993; white & warner 2007; ward 2012). concomitantly, because of risk dilution and collective threat detection, per capita pre- dation risk frequently is lower for ﬁsh in large than small shoals, and may result in less time spent in threat-sensitive activities (pitcher & parrish 1993; grand & dill 1999; stenberg & persson 2005; magn- hagen & bunnefeld 2009). nevertheless, the manner in which body size and shoal size interact among themselves and with other factors remains poorly understood. 308 here, we examine the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the daily activity patterns of the mira chub squalius torgalensis (henceforth chub) in a mediterranean stream in sw portugal, in spring 2009 and 2010. the chub is a critically endangered species (rogado et al. 2005), and behavioral informa- tion should aid in the development of conservation strategies for this species (buchholz 2007). we also chose chub because it is the most abundant ﬁsh in the study site and exhibits life-history attributes rep- resentative of many mediterranean ﬁshes, i.e., small body size, fast growth, early maturation, and spring spawning (doadrio 2002; magalh~aes et al. 2003; vila-gispert et al. 2005). the speciﬁc aims of our study were to: (1) quantify daily activity patterns of individual chub, (2) determine whether these patterns varied between years, and (3) quantify the effects of extrinsic (i.e., water temperature, year) and intrinsic factors (i.e., body size and shoal size) on activity patterns. methods study site rainfall timing of is predictable, our study site was an 80 m long section in the down- stream portion of the torgal stream (sw portugal, 37°38′n, 8°39′w), a small, undisturbed mediterra- nean stream that has been previously described in detail in magalh~aes et al. (2007). brieﬂy, the torgal stream is strongly inﬂuenced by the mediterranean climate type characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers (gasith & resh 1999). mean monthly air temperature ranges from 11 °c (decem- ber) to 24 °c (august). about 80% of annual rainfall occurs in october-march, and virtually none in the hot summer months (july-august). although the sea- sonal the total amount of rain varies considerably among years (205 –1121 mm). by contrast, annual variation in mean air temperature is relatively low (15–18 °c). the ﬂow regime is greatly dependent on annual rainfall; headwaters are ephemeral and downstream reaches typically dry to isolated pools and runs in summer. in dry years, there are no signiﬁcant ﬂoods and surface water persists in the deepest pools only. conversely, in wet years there are major ﬂoods, and ﬂows may persist in downstream reaches through summer. the underlying bedrock is siliceous igneous rock and the vegetation is dominated by cork oak quercus suber woodlands and eucalyptus eucaliptus globulus plan- tations interspersed with pasture and dry grain ﬁelds. riparian vegetation is dominated by well developed galleries of alder alnus glutinosa and ash fraxinus angustifolia, with an understory of mediterranean scrub. the study site encompassed a relatively shallow run (<80 cm deep), dominated by a bedrock outcrop with a mixture of boulder, cobble and ﬁne substrata. we choose this site because it typically retained water over summer, which reduced potential con- founding effects of emigration/extinction and coloni- zation processes on ﬁsh activity patterns. chub dominated the ﬁsh assemblage, but co-occurred with native southwestern arched-mouth nase iberochond- rostoma almacai (coelho et al. 2005), western three- spine stickleback gasterosteus gymnurus, southern iberian spined-loach cobitis paludica and the inva- sive pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus (fox et al. 2007). environmental data and daily activity patterns we analyzed the daily activity of individual ﬁsh in may 2009 and may-early june 2010. october 2008 to september 2009 was the driest 12 month period on record in the torgal stream since 1931 (205 mm), and rainfall in the following year, october 2009 to september 2010, also was substantially lower than the long-term annual median (446 versus 643 mm). mean air temperature in 2009 (16.7 °c  1.4, mean  se) and 2010 (17.4 °c  1.6) were similar to the long term mean (1972 - present, 16.9 °c  0.2). air temperature in may 2009 was 19.0 °c, identical to the long-term monthly 75% quartile (18.7 °c), and in may-early june 2010 increased to 19.5 °c, slightly below the long-term 75% quartile for those months (21.0 °c). we obtained air temperature and rainfall data from two gauging stations located near the study site (37°30′n, 8°24′w and 37°42′n, 8°32′w respec- tively). we conducted behavioral observations using the methods of grossman & freeman (1987) and gross- man & ratajczak (1998). we entered the site at its lower-most border, snorkeling from downstream to upstream, in a zigzag fashion to minimize distur- bance. both the substratum and the water column were scanned to locate ﬁsh, and undisturbed individ- uals identiﬁed for observation. disturbed ﬁsh were recognized by their characteristic escape responses (i.e., ﬂeeing and sustained darting movements). we identiﬁed each subject to species and visually esti- mated their standard length (sl). fish less than 5 cm (sl) were not observed because they were not reli- ably identiﬁable to species. we also visually esti- mated the number of individuals in each shoal and identiﬁed them to species. a shoal was deﬁned as individuals that were within approximately four body lengths of each other (pitcher & parrish 1993). we divided the study site in three equal sections and observed one section per day, for 1.5 h, at dawn (07:02 h  00:00 to 08:34 h  00:01, mean  se), daily activity of a mediterranean cyprinid mid-day (12:16 h  00:01 to 13:56 h  00:01) and dusk (18:35 h  00:00 to 20:02 h  00:01). we selected these observation times to cover a broad range of water temperatures, but restricted observa- tions to day light hours because chub appeared quies- cent at night (martelo et al., personal observations). efforts were made to not resample the same individu- als by observing less than 50% of the total during a sampling period. hence, although it is possible that some chub were observed more than once during a sampling period, the majority of observations are likely independent. we measured temperature at the water surface every 20 min during observations, using a hi 198129 probe (hanna instruments, woon- socket, ri, usa). we used instantaneous sampling (altmann 1974) to record the behavior of individual ﬁsh, every 30 sec for 3 min. observational times were recorded by an assistant. we made observations until we lost sight of a ﬁsh and only analyzed data that included at least 3 min of continuous observations (84% of all obser- vations). during observations we recorded the fol- lowing speciﬁc behaviors: (1) orienting (holding in the current or towards a shelter, e.g., tree roots, branches), (2) cruising (swimming movements not oriented towards an object or food), (3) benthic for- aging (feeding on tree roots, branches, boulders, cob- bles or submerged macrophytes), (4) drift foraging (feeding on organisms carried by the current), (5) searching (approaching and orienting towards an object food), and (6) other, which included non-oriented holding (generally holding position but not oriented towards the current or shelter) and agitated (short abrupt movements typi- cal of fright, caused by the observer, other ﬁshes or the red swamp crayﬁsh procambarus clarkii). in search for invasive statistical analyses our statistical approach focused on explaining varia- tion in daily activity patterns for individual chub by creating a suite of explanatory models that included both extrinsic (water temperature and year) and intrinsic (ﬁsh size and shoal size) explanatory vari- ables. year was coded as a dummy independent vari- able. although shoal size may be inﬂuenced by extrinsic factors, we classiﬁed it as intrinsic for it also may integrate intrinsic factors, such as social interac- tions or behavioral motivations that may depend on individual properties (flierl et al. 1999). shoal size included solitary individuals, and when mixed-spe- cies shoals were observed (74% of shoals), it was determined by the number of chub in the shoals. mixed-species shoals were always composed of more than 50% of chub, with one exception, in which chub 309 j. martelo et al. comprised 30% of the individuals in the shoal. we used the total number of times that each individual performed a given behavior during a 3 min observa- tion period to derive our response variables. prior to analyses, both explanatory variables and counts of behavioral acts were log transformed for normality and to reduce kurtosis (legendre & legen- dre 1998). we calculated pairwise correlation coefﬁ- cients between explanatory variables to identify multicollinearity. analyses were conducted in the r 2.14.1 software using mumin (barton 2011) and statistica 10.0 with signiﬁcance at p < 0.05. we found no evidence of strong correlations between explanatory variables (pearson’s r  |0.30|), thus all were retained in analyses. we tested for signiﬁcant differences in explanatory variables between years using mann-whitney and fisher’s f tests on the mean and variance of each variable, respectively (zar 1996). to quantify variation in chub activity patterns we conducted a principal components analysis (pca) on the counts of behavioral acts, pooling 2009 and 2010 data. we used pca because several behav- iors were signiﬁcantly correlated and pca is designed to handle intercorrelated data (grossman et al. 1991; legendre & legendre 1998). to avoid unstable ordination results and spurious patterns, we excluded behaviors representing less than 5% of the total from analyses, and the only category that this represented was other behaviors (legendre & legendre 1998). following grossman & de sostoa (1994a,b) we tested the null hypothesis that activity patterns did not differ between 2009 and 2010 by calculat- ing mean component scores and 95% conﬁdence ellipses for these years. a lack of overlap of the 95% conﬁdence ellipses demonstrated signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level (grossman & de sostoa 1994a,b). we tested for signiﬁcant differences in activity patterns between years to decide whether year should be included as an explanatory variable in our modeling exercise. (table 1) we then developed 13 a priori, mechanistic regres- sion models including extrinsic and intrinsic explana- tory variables to explain variation in activity patterns based on pca scores, using general- ized linear models with a normal error distribution (crawley 2007). all explanatory variables were trea- ted as ﬁxed effects. even though year may be consid- ered a random effect conceptually, pragmatically we must treat it as a ﬁxed effect because we only had two treatment levels (2009 and 2010), which would lead to imprecise estimates of variance (douglas bates, personal communication). the set of candidate models included four models evaluating the individ- ual effects of temperature, year, ﬁsh size and shoal size. the set also included additive models to describe the combined effects of pairs of the extrinsic and intrinsic variables. in addition, two-way interac- tion terms were included in some models to account for possible differences in responses based on ﬁsh size and shoal size due to temperature and year effects shoal size 9 year). finally, a global model with all main effects and interactions, and a null model including the intercept only were evaluated. size 9 temperature or (e.g., shoal we used an information-theoretic approach as a model selection procedure, whereby the plausibility of each candidate model was assessed using akaike information criteria adjusted for small sample sizes (aicc; burnham & anderson 2002). we assessed the relative performance of candidate models using daiccs and akaike weights (wi). akaike weights quantify the amount of information lost in the origi- nal data through use of a given model (burnham & anderson 2002). we only interpreted models with akaike weights >10% of the model with the best ﬁt (burnham & anderson 2002; grossman et al. 2006). to quantify model selection uncertainty, we calcu- lated model-averaged coefﬁcient estimates and evalu- ated the precision of these estimates using 85% conﬁdence intervals (arnold 2010). estimates whose table 1. a priori mechanistic explanatory models relating daily activity patterns of chub to extrinsic and intrinsic variables. hypothesis model activity pattern is explained by changes in temperature activity pattern is explained by year activity pattern is explained by changes in ﬁsh size activity pattern is explained by changes in shoal size activity pattern is explained by changes in extrinsic variables activity pattern is explained by changes in intrinsic variables activity pattern is explained by changes in extrinsic and intrinsic variables activity pattern is explained by temperature and changes with ﬁsh size activity pattern is explained by temperature and changes with shoal size activity pattern is explained by year and changes with ﬁsh size activity pattern is explained by year and changes with shoal size activity pattern is explained by all main variables and interactions activity pattern is independent of extrinsic and intrinsic variables 310 y = temperature y = year y = ﬁsh size y = shoal size y = temperature + year y = ﬁsh size + shoal size y = temperature + year + ﬁsh size + shoal size y = temperature + ﬁsh size + temperature x ﬁsh size y = temperature + shoal size + temperature x shoal size y = year + ﬁsh size + year x ﬁsh size y = year + shoal size + year x shoal size conﬁdence intervals included zero were viewed as having lower explanatory power. finally, we esti- mated the relative importance of explanatory vari- ables by summing their akaike weights over all interpretable models where the variable was included (burnham & anderson 2002). results daily activity patterns we obtained activity data for 231 chub, 120 in 2009 and 111 in 2010, with an average of 40 (sd = 5) and 37 (sd = 5) individuals per observation period in 2009 and 2010, respectively. during the day chub allocated their time to a variety of behaviors, although foraging behaviors were most common. individuals spent half of the time foraging, either on benthic (27%) or drifting (23%) organisms, but also often ori- ented towards the current or shelter (21%). cruising (16%) and searching for food (11%) were less fre- quent, whereas other behaviors were rare (2%). both explanatory variables and activity patterns dif- fered signiﬁcantly between 2009 and 2010. tempera- ture was lower, and both ﬁsh size and shoal size were larger and more variable in 2009 than in 2010 (table 2). the pca identiﬁed three behavioral patterns with eigenvalues >1, however, we only interpreted the ﬁrst (pc1) and second (pc2) components because they explained most of the variation in the data, 39 and 26% respectively, whereas the third component (pc3) explained 20% and added little new information. prin- cipal component 1 contrasted drift foraging and orient- ing from benthic foraging and searching, and pc2 discriminated cruising from searching (fig. 1a). pc1 scores indicated that chub drift foraged and oriented more and benthic foraged and searched less in 2009 than in 2010, whereas pc2 scores underlined that in 2009 chub tended to display more searching and less cruising than in 2010 (fig. 1a). extrinsic and intrinsic inﬂuences on behavior variation in activity patterns for chub was affected by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. the analysis revealed two interpretable models for pc1; the model daily activity of a mediterranean cyprinid with the greatest explanatory power included year, shoal size, and the year x shoal size interaction (aicc = 624.69, wi = 0.78), whereas the second included temperature, shoal size and their interaction (aicc = 627.49, daicc = 2.80, wi = 0.19) and was 4.1 times less likely to be true given the data, than the best model. there were variations in the relative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic variables in explaining activity patterns data for chub (table 3). there was strong support (wi = 0.80) for chub to spend more time benthic foraging and searching than drift foraging and orienting in 2010. in addition, there was strong support (wi = 1.00) for individuals in small shoals to spend more time benthic foraging and search- ing and less time drift foraging and orienting than those in large shoals (table 3). however, shoal size had a model-averaged coefﬁcient estimate that overlapped zero, and consequently this result should be interpreted with caution. the effect of shoal size varied strongly with year (year x shoal size, wi = 0.80), and less time was allocated to benthic foraging and searching as shoal size increased in 2010, however this pattern was not present in 2009 (fig. 1b). finally, there was weak support for the effects of temperature (wi = 0.20) and the temperature x shoal size interaction (wi = 0.20), indicating a tendency for benthic foraging and search- ing to increase slightly with temperature, but only when shoals were small (fig. 1c). this effect was evi- dent only when temperature was above 14 °c, and was strongest at 18 °c (fig. 1c). year, ﬁsh size and shoal included temperature results for pc2 scores were similar to those for pc1, with two interpretable models also differing about 4.0 times in explanatory evidence given the data. the best model included the additive effects of temperature, size (aicc = 643.45, wi = 0.77), whereas the second best model year (aicc = 646.23, daicc = 2.78, wi = 0.19). all variables had strongly supported associations with pc2 scores (wi > 0.80, table 3). in 2010, and as ﬁsh size increased and temperature decreased, chub cruised more and searched less. individuals in larger shoals also cruised more and searched less than those in small shoals, though the model-averaged coefﬁ- cient estimate for shoal size overlapped zero and needs to be interpreted with careful. and table 2. variation in temperature, ﬁsh size and shoal size in 2009 and 2010;

(martelo observations). although our study provides valuable empirical evidence on activity patterns for a cyprinid in the wild, our results were potentially affected by several factors. for example, data collection occurred in a single site and season (spring) although we did observe chub in two years. observations in other sea- sons were not possible due to high ﬂows and turbidi- ties in addition, during the two years of observations condi- tions were dry, and thus our results may not be com- pletely relevant to wet or perhaps average water years (magalh~aes et al. 2007). even though inter- annual variability in activity patterns was evident, it might have been greater if behavioral data also had been collected in wet years, because variation in ﬂow may affect ﬁsh movement and foraging behavior (petty & grossman 2004; kemp et al. 2006). fur- thermore, we excluded ﬁsh less than 5 cm (sl) from analysis, which may have weakened the association between ﬁsh size and activity patterns. however, this was unavoidable because we could not identify small ﬁsh to species underwater. finally, we never observed reproductive behaviors, probably because sampling occurred at the end of the spawning season (see magalh~aes et al. 2003); consequently, it is unli- kely that our results were inﬂuenced by reproduction processes. et al. personal table 3. model averaged parameter

affected by differences in food availability. chub allocated more time to drift forag- ing in 2009 and largely shifted to benthic foraging in 2010. the abundance of drifting macroinvertebrates declined in 2010 in the study site, whereas the abun- dance of benthic organisms remained very similar between years (martelo et al., unpublished data). variations in prey availability produce changes in foraging modes for several species (e.g., nakano et al. 1999; katano 2011), and also affect the diet of (e.g., magalh~aes many mediterranean cyprinids 1993; gomes-ferreira et al. 2005). nonetheless, it also is possible that random processes played a role in the differences observed between 2009 and 2010. chub spent more time feeding on and searching for benthic organisms when in small groups than in large groups in 2010. this suggests that intraspeciﬁc interactions may affect activity patterns of this spe- cies (pitcher & parrish 1993; grand & dill 1999). it is curious, however, that shoal size did not affect activity patterns in 2009, when shoals showed greater variation in size. reduced shoal size in 2010 was apparently related to the decrease in abundance of small adults (martelo et al., unpublished data), which probably reﬂected the inﬂuence of the severe drought in 2009 (magalh~aes et al. 2007). temperature also inﬂuenced the activity patterns of chub, probably through its effect on metabolism. it is likely that increased temperatures resulted in an increase in the metabolic rate of chub and hence they spent more time searching for prey and less time cruising. these results are concordant with previous studies of ﬁsh activity patterns that demonstrate a relationship between diel activities and water temper- ature (fraser et al. 1993; greenwood & metcalfe 1998; bremset 2000), however, few of these studies examined foraging behaviors in the ﬁeld. in labora- tory studies, search, capture rate and swimming char- acteristics (i.e., speed and angle of turn) may be positively related to temperature (persson 1986; marchand et al. 2002; linløkken et al. 2010). despite the strongly supported effect of temperature on searching behavior, its effect on foraging was weak, which may have been related to the low range of temperature values observed during the study. food. the inﬂuence of smaller individuals spent more time searching for prey and less time cruising than larger individuals. it is possible that this occurred because individuals with smaller body sizes have higher energetic demands than larger members of the same species (brett & groves 1979). another potential explanation for these differences is that intraspeciﬁc competition between small and large adults limited small adult access to high-quality prey, forcing them to spend more time searching for intraspeciﬁc competition on daily activity and habitat use has been documented in studies of salmonids (hughes & dill 1990; nakano 1995; alan€ar€a et al. 2001), cyprinids (hazelton & grossman 2009b) and cottids (petty & grossman 2007), and on foraging success in cypri- nids (hazelton & grossman 2009a). nonetheless, small and large chub occurred in the same shoal without intraspeciﬁc aggression. in addition, small and large chub occupy similar habitat patches and changes in abundance did not affect habitat use in this system (martelo et al., unpublished data). little is known about the behavior of european cyprinids, especially members of the widespread genus squalius. extant studies focus on patterns of movement, habitat use and feeding, and, in accor- dance with our ﬁndings, have shown that individual behavior can be highly variable and affected by mul- tiple factors, including temperature and ﬁsh size. changes in habitat use in relation to temperature may include increasing use of shallow or low-velocity habitats in periods of high temperatures (santos et al. 2004; santos & ferreira 2008), and use of vegetation as shelters as temperatures drop (baras & nindaba 1999). size-related differences in habitat use may be small (martelo et al. unpublished data), or, substan- tial, with larger individuals generally associating with 313 j. martelo et al. deep, high velocity habitats with little cover (gross- man & de sostoa 1994a,b; santos et al. 2004; santos & ferreira 2008). movements may increase with both temperature (santos et al. 2002, 2005) and ﬁsh size (pires 2012). finally, size-related shifts in feeding behavior also have been reported, with larger ﬁsh preying on a higher percentage of hard-shelled prey than smaller ﬁsh with a concomitant decrease in die- tary breadth (magalh~aes 1993). although temperature and ﬁsh size seem to inﬂuence the behavior of squa- lius spp., the effects of annual environmental varia- tion and shoal size variation require further study. daily activity patterns of chub were affected by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, individual behav- iors varied between years, and were dependent on shoal size, body size and temperature. similar to other ﬁsh species (e.g., reebs 2002; david & closs 2003; breau et al. 2007), activity was variable at an individual level indicating that the behavior of chub display substantial behavioral ﬂexibility. this likely is of adaptive value given that mediterranean streams are highly variable and heterogeneous. despite this ﬂexibility, given their rarity it is possible that chub will be vulnerable to the long and intense droughts (magalh~aes et al. 2007), predicted for the mediterra- nean region by climate change models (santos & miranda 2006). in conclusion, our results suggest that conservation and management efforts for chub should include the maintenance of natural temperature and ﬂow regimes and continued evaluation of environ- mental change on shoal and ﬁsh size distributions. moreover, given that behavioral studies are increas- ingly recognized as important in species conservation (buchholz 2007), a better understanding of the fac- tors inﬂuencing the behavior of chub is needed. we believe that our results provide one of the ﬁrst efforts to remedy this shortcoming. acknowledgements we thank amy oliver, antonio martins,
