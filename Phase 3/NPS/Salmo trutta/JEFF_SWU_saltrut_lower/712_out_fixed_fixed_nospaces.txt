dispersal; environmental flows; otolith chemistry; recruitment introduction in rivers subject to flow regulation, knowledge of the effects of hydrology on ecosystem functioning is increasingly driving water management decisions, including efforts to return more natural flow regimes through targeted environmental water allocations (ewas) (arthington et al. 2006; king et al. 2010). such allocations can confer substantial ecological ben- efits to aquatic and terrestrial biota; for example, through enhancing spawning, recruitment and abun- dances of native fishes (marchetti & moyle 2001; king et al. 2009; bradford et al. 2011), promoting breeding of waterbirds and frogs (leslie & ward 2002; o’connor et al. 2007) and maintaining the health of native vegetation communities in floodplain habitats (sienbentritt et al. 2004). notwithstanding the value of these positive outcomes, delivery of ewas may also advantage resident alien species by creating, or facilitating access to habitats that favour their repro- duction, survival and/or dispersal (propst & gido 2004; stuart & jones 2006; conallin et al. 2012). correspondence: j. i. macdonald, faculty of life and environmental sciences, university of iceland, sturlugata 7, 101 reykjavık, iceland. e-mail: jedimacdonald@ gmail.com current addresses: *faculty of life and environmental sciences, university of iceland, sturlugata 7, 101 reykjavık, iceland †research institute for the environment and livelihoods, charles darwin university, darwin, nt 0909, australia doi: 10.1111/eff.12075 269 macdonald & crook common carp (cyprinus carpio) (hereafter referred to as carp) is an extremely successful invader of freshwaters across the world (koehn 2004; zambrano et al. 2006) and the species’ capacity to detrimentally impact ecosystem structure and function is well recognised (see review by weber & brown 2009). the influence of hydrology on spawning, larval dis- persal and recruitment in carp has been investigated in both flow-regulated and unregulated river systems (e.g., crivelli 1981; gehrke et al. 1995; king et al. 2003; propst & gido 2004; driver et al. 2005; humphries et al. 2008). this work has demonstrated that off-channel wetlands and inundated floodplain habitats are especially important habitats for carp reproduction. indeed, peak larval abundance appears closely linked to periods shortly after major flood events in spring and summer (king et al. 2007), and there is some evidence that larval dispersal and overall carp production is highest during years when floodplain habitats are inundated for an extended time (gilligan & schiller 2003; brown et al. 2005; stuart & jones 2006). the scale of identification of key spawning and nursery areas for carp and measurement of their relative contribu- tions to recruitment can provide a platform for exploring the spatial and temporal dynamics of carp populations (e.g., connectivity between sources and sinks within metapopulations – fagan 2002;

crook et al. in press) and for understanding recruitment strength and dispersal of early life stages (durham & wilde 2006). such information is particularly rele- vant in flow-regulated systems, where opportunities may exist to minimise negative ecological impacts of the species through strategic water delivery (e.g., valdez et al. 2001). of the barmah-millewa forest (bmf), which covers 66,000 ha and comprises the largest river red gum eucalyptus camaldulensis forest in australia, has been identified as a major spawning and nursery area for carp in the mid-murray river region of south-east australia (nicol et al. 2004; brown et al. 2005; crook & gillanders 2006; stuart & jones 2006; fig. 1). pre- vious work suggests that the scale, timing and dura- tion of floodplain inundation in the bmf can markedly influence regional carp production, as well as the dispersal of young recruits (stuart & jones 2006; king et al. 2007, 2010). an analysis of the otolith chemistry of young-of-the-year (yoy) carp collected from the mid-murray river and nearby tributaries found that the bmf was the most likely source of 98% of yoy carp collected from a down- stream location in the main channel of the murray river in a single year (crook & gillanders 2006). here, we measure trace element concentrations in post-larval and yoy carp otoliths to identify nursery sources in the mid-murray river region over multiple years and under varying hydrological conditions. these data are combined with catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) information collected from a site downstream to examine the influence of river flow on yoy cohort strength in each year and the relative contribu- tions of the nursery sources to yoy recruitment. carp sources and recruitment in regulated rivers materials and methods fish sampling for otolith chemistry analysis post-larval carp (< 1 month of age – vilizzi 1998; villizi & walker 1999) were captured in early novem- ber 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 following the onset of spawning each year. post-larvae were targeted using a small, fine-mesh seine net in slow-flowing, backwater habitats in major tributaries of the mid-murray river (campaspe river, goulburn river, broken creek), inundated benches in the murray river main channel both upstream and downstream of the bmf, and floodplain habitats within the bmf (fig. 1, table 1). upon capture, fish were immediately killed by over- dose in aqui-s® (aqui-s new zealand ltd, lower hutt, new zealand) and preserved in 95% ethanol for transport to the laboratory, where they were measured for standard length (sl, nearest 1 mm). yoy carp were sampled using a smith-root (7.5 kva) boat-mounted electrofishing unit at tor- rumbarry weir between march and may in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. the specific objective was to collect yoy fish (i.e., 4–6 months old) of the same cohort as the post-larvae sampled in the previous november of each year to retrospectively determine their source nursery using otolith chemistry analyses. torrumbarry weir was treated as a potential down- stream receiving habitat for dispersed larvae and juveniles (see crook & gillanders 2006; fig. 1). all fish captured were measured for fork length (fl, nearest 1 mm), and those < 200 mm fl were killed by overdose in aqui-s® and immersed in an ice- slurry for transport to the laboratory (table 1). aste- riscus otoliths were dissected from each fish and table 1. nursery source and codes, numbers (n) and lengths of post-larval and yoy carp used for otolith chemistry analyses in 2005/2006, 2006/2007, 2007/ 2008 and 2008/2009. nursery post-larvae barmah lake moira lake hut lake morning glory tocumwal torrumbarry weir larissa road mcdonald’s road shepparton yambuna loch garry strathallan yoy torrumbarry weir yambuna n analysed mean length (range) mm code 05/06 06/07 07/08 08/09 05/06 06/07 07/08 08/09 bl ml hl mg to tw lr mr sh ya lg st tw ya 24 9 33 16 14 18 7 10 16 10 27 60 42 19 20 19 17 9 12 21 18 20 3 25 8 23 17 22 24 14 6 6 23 19 24 26 9 22 23 1 19 18.6 (13–20) 19.8 (16–21) 19.1 (19–20) 18.5 (15–21) 15.5 (12–21) 18.6 (13–20) 18.0 (13–19) 14.3 (13–15) 20.0 (13–23) 15.5 (13–17) 13.0 (12–17) 76.0 (49–155) 71.9 (40–111) 16.1 (12–20) 17.8 (12–20) 14.4 (10–18) 13.8 (10–17) 18.4 (15–23) 15.8 (12–22) 15.7 (11–20) 11.1 (10–12) 12.9 (11–20) 10.9 (7–12) 14.0 (10–17) 12.6 (10–15) 14.5 (13–16) 13.7 (11–17) 15.6 (12–18) 16.8 (14–19) 14.6 (11–18) 14.3 (10–17) 13.9 (11–16) 13.8 (10–17) 13.4 (11–19) 14.6 (12–16) 19.2 (17–22) 13.0 (8–19) 97.5 (93–111) 93.5 (73–108) 130 87.1 (74–105) length refers to sl for post-larvae, fl for yoy. 271 macdonald & crook examined to confirm that they lacked annual incre- ments, and hence, were in their first year of life (brown et al. 2004). in addition to the torrumbarry weir samples, we opportunistically obtained yoy carp otoliths from yambuna on the lower goulburn river in may 2006 (fig. 1). these fish were col- lected by boat electrofishing as part of a separate study (koster et al. 2006) and were included in the analysis as a second potential receiving habitat for yoy carp. assignment of yoy to nurseries was lim- ited to the 2006 collections as insufficient numbers of yoy were captured from 2007–2009. otolith preparation lapillus from each post-larva was we analysed the lapillus otoliths of carp as they have been shown to be useful for spatial discrimination of riverine carp populations (macdonald et al. 2012; crook et al. in press) and, unlike the sagittae and aste- risci, have daily increments that can be used to pre- cisely sample specific regions of the otolith using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry (la-icpms). lapillae were dissected from each fish, cleaned of adhering tissue, rinsed several times in milli-q water (millipore, billerica, ma, usa) then stored in 0.5 ml polypropylene microtubes. one embe- dded whole, proximal surface downwards, on an acid-washed glass slide in a two-part epoxy resin (epofix®, struers, denmark). otoliths from all nurser- ies were combined and arranged randomly on the slide to remove any systematic instrument-related bias. prepared slides were rinsed in milli-q water and air- dried overnight in a class 100 laminar flow cabinet at room temperature. yoy otoliths were mounted individually, proximal surface downwards, on an acid- washed glass slide in thermoplastic glue (crystal- bondtm, aremco products inc., ny, usa) and polished to within approximately 20 lm of the primordium using a graded series of wetted lapping films (9, 5, 3 lm) and alumina slurry (0.5 lm). the slide was then reheated and the polished otolith transferred to a master slide, on which otoliths from both collection sites were arranged randomly. after polishing, otoliths were rinsed in milli-q water and dried as before. chemical analysis and data selection we used la-icpms to measure trace element con- centrations in the otoliths. a resonetics lpx120i arf 193 nm excimer system (resonetics, nashua, nh, usa) coupled to an agilent 7500s icp-ms (agilent technologies, inc., santa clara, ca, usa) located at the australian national univer- sity, canberra, australia was used (eggins et al. 1998), with laser operating parameters, ablation con- laser 272 ditions and data reduction procedures used following closely those described by macdonald et al. (2008). briefly, otolith mounts were placed in the sample cell and the primordium of each otolith located using a video imaging system. each otolith was drilled in a vertical transect from the distal surface to the proxi- mal surface through the primordium using a 71 lm ablation spot, with the laser operated at 90 mj and pulsed at 10 hz. ablation occurred inside a sealed chamber in pure he (flow rate: 0.3 lmin  1) with the vaporised material transported to the icpms in the ar carrier gas (flow rate: 1.23 lmin  1) via a signal- smoothing manifold. otoliths were analysed for sev- eral isotopes including 25mg, 43ca, 55mn, 88sr and 138ba. ca was used as an internal standard to account for variation in ablation yield among samples. data processing was performed offline using the iolite version 2.13 software (school of earth sci- ences, university of melbourne) (see woodhead et al. 2007; paton et al. 2011). subtraction of background ion counts from otolith counts was followed by the normalisation of each element to ca using an external calibration standard (national institute of standards technology, nist 612, gaithersburg, md, usa) which was analysed after every 10 otolith samples. data were then expressed as molar ratios to ca (i.e., mg:ca, mn:ca, sr:ca, ba:ca). mean precision (% rel- ative standard deviation) based on analyses of a sec- ondary certified reference standard (nist 610) and averaged across the analysis days for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, were as follows: mg:ca: 5.1, 6.8, 2.2, 2.0; mn:ca: 11.2, 9.2, 2.1, 1.5; sr:ca: 3.4, 4.1, 2.0, 1.6; ba:ca: 6.2, 7.6, 2.2, 2.2. based on previous studies of larval development, movement and nursery habitat preferences in carp (villizi & walker 1999), otolith material accreted between 3 and 10 days of life post-hatch was selected to represent the period of nursery residence prior to dispersal. following the methodology of macdonald et al. (2008), this ‘target’ otolith region was identified along the vertical ablation transect by (i) examination of daily increment positions in the second lapillus from 30 post-larvae used in this study; (ii) measure- ment of the amount of material removed with each laser pulse; and (iii) the location of the maximum value of the mn peak along the transect, which has been widely used as a proxy for identifying the otolith primordium (brophy et al. 2004; ruttenberg et al. 2005; munro et al. 2009). during data processing, only ablated material representing days 3–10 (i.e., the target otolith region) was retained for analysis. annual yoy cohort strength standardised boat-mounted electrofishing was con- ducted at torrumbarry weir on 21 and 22 march 2006, 1 may 2007, 15 and 16 april 2008, and 21 and 22 april 2009 to estimate annual yoy cohort strength. cpue was calculated based on the number  1 of electrofishing (power-on) of carp captured h time. eighteen electrofishing shots, each of 10 min total duration, were conducted each year using a smith-root (7.5 kva) boat-mounted electrofishing unit. the unit was operated at 1000 v, a pulsed dc frequency of 120 hz and 55% duty cycle. all habitat types were sampled, and shot location, operators, sam- pling equipment and unit settings were kept consistent among years. the distance covered was 332  29 m (mean  se) and the time power was applied was 223  17 s (mean  se) per 10 min shot. data analysis spatial variation in otolith core chemistry (i.e., mg: ca, mn:ca, sr:ca, ba:ca) of post-larvae among nurs- ery sources was investigated using single-factor mul- tivariate anova (manova) and quadratic discriminant function analysis (dfa). analyses were conducted for each of the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 post-lar- val cohorts separately. data were natural log trans- formed to meet the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality. pillai’s trace statistic was used for multivariate tests. classification success for the dfas was calculated by jackknife cross-valida- tion matrices and standardised coefficients for the discriminant functions were used to measure which elements contributed most to group separation. ran- domisation tests were used to determine if the jack- knife classification estimates differed significantly from random (white & ruttenberg 2007). the proba- bility of obtaining the observed classification rate due to chance alone was estimated using uniform prior probabilities and 10,000 randomisations of the data. interannual variation in otolith core chemistry of post-larvae captured at each nursery site was exam- ined using single-factor manova, with the sampling year treated as a fixed factor. a linear dfa was then run to estimate classification success of post-larvae to their source nursery among years. jackknife cross- validation and randomisation tests were used to assess classification rates as described above. these analyses were run in r 2.12.2 (r core team 2011). maximum likelihood estimation (mle) was used to estimate the nursery of origin for the yoy fish col- lected in autumn 2006. as nurseries in close proxim- ity (e.g., within the bmf) exhibited high overlap in otolith core chemistry based on the jackknife classifi- cation outputs from the dfas, the 11 sampled nurs- ery sites were grouped into six zones for the mle analysis (i.e., barmah – barmah lake, moira lake, hut lake, morning glory; murray river upstream – tocumwal; broken creek – mcdonald’s road, carp sources and recruitment in regulated rivers larissa road; campaspe river – strathallan; lower goulburn river – loch garry, yambuna; shepparton; table 5). the mle was conducted using the mixed- stock analysis program hisea (millar 1987, 1990), and the direct maximum likelihood estimator was used for all calculations. to examine the variance in the estimator, 1000 simulations were run on the base- line data (comprising post-larval otolith core chemis- try from the november 2005 collections), with the baseline resampled at each simulation. the estimated % compositions were then compared with known % compositions. following the simulations, hisea was run in analysis mode to estimate the nursery zone of origin for the yoy fish captured in 2006. results spatial and temporal variation in otolith chemistry the otolith core chemistry of post-larvae varied sig- nificantly among nursery sites in each year of the study (fig 2, table 2). classification accuracy of post-larvae to their capture site was moderate to high in 2005 and 2006 (overall 71 and 68% correctly clas- sified, respectively), particularly at nurseries in the murray river tributaries (e.g., 100% correctly classi- fied at shepparton and loch garry on the goulburn in 2005, and strathallan on the campaspe in 2006, 2007 and 2008) and at the most upstream nursery sampled on the murray main channel at tocumwal (100% correctly classified in 2006) (table 3). post- larvae captured from nurseries within or immediately downstream of the bmf (i.e., barmah lake, hut lake, moira lake and morning glory) had very sim- ilar otolith core chemistry in most years, which reduced classification accuracy at these sites (fig. 2, table 3). success in classifying post-larvae captured in both 2007 and 2008 was moderate (55 and 53% correctly classified, respectively). most misclassifica- tions occurred between the lower broken creek site at mcdonald’s road and morning glory located on the murray river main channel approximately 10 km downstream of the broken creek/murray river con- fluence, and between barmah lake and the nursery sampled near tocumwal (table 3). variation among nurseries in each year was driven primarily by differ- ences in sr:ca and ba:ca along the first discriminant function which accounted for 68.1, 65.7, 79.2 and 88.5% of the total among-site variance in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. post-larval otolith core chemistry differed signifi- cantly among years at all nurseries (fig. 3, table 2). classification success to the sampling year was rela- tively high for all nurseries, ranging from 90% at barmah lake and larissa road to 64% at mcdon- 273 macdonald & crook 6 4 2 0  2 n o i t c n u –2 –4 2005 lg lr sh mg hl ya mr to bl ml st –5 0 5 10 f t n a n m i i r c s d i 2007 6 2 –2 mg sh mr lr bl ml to –4

tured [2007: n = 4 (10%), 2008: n = 4 (11%), 2009: n = 1 (2%)] and larger individuals dominated the catch (85% of fish > 300 mm fl) (fig. 4). cpue  1) for each year was: 42.8 – all fish, (carp

connections between these sources and adult populations are now wide- carp sources and recruitment in regulated rivers spread in studies of freshwater, estuarine and marine fishes (e.g., hamer et al. 2005; woods et al. 2010; standish et al. 2011). studies of this nature rely upon discernible differences in otolith chemistry being present among sampled habitats, irrespective of the many underlying mechanisms (e.g., ambient chemis- try, temperature, salinity, diet, ontogeny) that influ- ence elemental incorporation (bath et al. 2000; elsdon & gillanders 2003; martin & wuenschel 2006; macdonald & crook 2010; walther et al. 2010). here, we have shown that sufficient spatial variation in otolith chemistry exists to discriminate between carp recruits from different nurseries, within years, in the mid-murray river and nearby tributar- ies. our use of post-larvae to characterise nursery sources is an important refinement to the method described by crook & gillanders (2006) who used yoy fish (up to 150 mm fl) for a similar purpose. as newly hatched larvae and juveniles (< 1 month post-hatch) tend to remain within inundated flood- plain nursery habitats close to their natal sites during early growth and development (gilligan & schiller 2003; brown et al. 2005; stuart & jones 2006), the otolith core chemistry of post-larvae captured within such nursery habitats is more likely to reflect the per- iod of residence in these areas than that of older yoy fish that possess stronger swimming and dis- persal capabilities (see jones & stuart 2007). use of post-larvae, therefore, may provide a more reliable representation of nursery sources for carp. previous studies have shown that chemical signa- tures in otoliths collected from the same geographical location can vary substantially within and between spawning seasons (feyrer et al. 2007; walther & thorrold 2009; cook 2011) or exhibit some degree of temporal stability (campana et al. 2000; rooker et al. 2003). the otolith core chemistry of post-larval carp exhibited strong interannual variability in the present study, differing significantly among years at all of the sampled nursery sites. this temporal insta- bility precludes the use of a single post-larval cohort as a baseline upon which to assign the origin of yoy fish from any cohort, and instead necessitates matching of yoy carp to their specific post-larval cohort to remove the potential to confound spatial differences in otolith chemistry with temporal differ- ences (gillanders 2002; hamer et al. 2005; cook 2011). a key assumption of the mle procedure we employed is that all potential nurseries were sampled. if the otolith chemistry at a particular nursery was not characterised and included in the analysis, fish origi- nating from that nursery would by necessity be errone- ously classified to one of the sources that has been included. this issue highlights the importance of incorporating knowledge of the study region and the 277 macdonald & crook y

and sample carp nurseries in bmf, the mid-murray and its tributaries during the late spring–early summer spawning period, and we are confident that the major nurseries in the study area were characterised. in situations where unknown sources could potentially contribute to recruitment, bayesian approaches and monte carlo markov chain (mcmc) algorithms can be employed to account for uncertainty in the baseline data (munch & clarke 2008; white et al. 2008; stan- dish et al. 2011). however, mle was our preferred assignment approach as it has been shown to perform as well, and often

identified the bmf floodplain as a key spawning and nursery ground for carp in the mid-murray river (brown et al. 2005; crook & gil- landers 2006; stuart & jones 2006). the bmf was estimated as the primary source for yoy carp sampled in the murray river at torrumbarry weir and the lower goulburn river at yambuna in 2006, with secondary contributions from other nurseries in the lower goulburn river. as the bmf and lower goulburn nurseries were observed to contribute similar proportions of recruits to these geographically distant receiving habitats, it appears that considerable mixing may occur across a large spatial scale within the first year of life. this finding is broadly in agree- ment with the hypothesis of stuart & jones (2006), who described a downstream dispersal of larvae from nurseries in bmf and an active movement into tribu- taries (e.g., goulburn river) upon reaching a size that permits swimming against river flow. our findings also demonstrate the importance of hydrology in influencing both the relative contribu- tion of nursery sources and recruitment strength in carp sources and recruitment in regulated rivers riverine carp populations (crook & gillanders 2006; stuart & jones 2006). the 2005/2006 spawning sea- son was characterised by a series of elevated flows through the bmf, due to high natural inflows and a managed release of 513 gl of water from lake hume (a major upstream water storage) as part of an ewa aimed at increasing the duration of floodplain inundation at the bmf (king et al. 2010). these flows resulted in daily discharges downstream of lake hume that were above the threshold for forest  1) (chong & flooding in the bmf (10,600 ml day ladson 2003) for almost the entire spring and early summer 2005 (fig. 5a). concurrently, the lower goulburn river downstream of shepparton received regular pulsed flows through staged intervalley trans- fers in addition to high tributary contributions, result- ing in extended periods of overbank flooding in the lower reaches (fig. 5b). by contrast, extreme low flow conditions were observed in the mid-murray tributaries during the last three summers of the study. there was no use of the ewa for the bmf and little floodplain inundation in the bmf or the tributaries in these years (fig. 5). of availability higher-quality timing of flows in 2005/2006 coincided with the peak carp spawning period in the region, and given their amplitude and duration, it appears likely that the increased nursery habitats in the lower goulburn river and the bmf may have offered greater opportunities for spawning and subsequent recruitment in 2005/2006 compared with other low flow years in which tributary contri- bution to recruitment is small (see crook & gilland- ers post-larvae were collected from most key nursery areas in the region each year, localised spawning took place each spring, the standardised catch data from torrumbarry weir are indicative of very poor yoy recruitment under the low flow conditions present in 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. inferring that although indeed, 2006). despite the suboptimal spawning and rearing con- ditions encountered during low flows, recent work has suggested that even small flow spikes that inun- date vegetated benches within the main channel dur- ing spring or early summer (like those occurring in the murray river near bmf during spring 2007 and 2008) may promote spawning and enhance survival of recruits (king et al. 2008; tonkin & rourke 2008; rourke & tonkin 2009). in the absence of significant flows following such spawning events, however, downstream dispersal of larvae away from nursery sites may be severely limited or at least delayed, and retention close to better quality nursery areas may predominate. extending the present to incorporate estimates of nursery contribution at a basin-wide scale (i.e., river networks within the murray-darling basin) under a range of flow scenar- analysis 279 macdonald & crook ios could provide further insights into dispersal dynamics during early life and the degree of connec- tivity among riverine carp populations. conclusion developing environmental as the provision of ewas to support biological pro- cesses proceeds apace in australia and other parts of the world (see king et al. 2010), there is growing awareness of the need to integrate empirical infor- mation on the ecological consequences of flow alter- ation when flow management targets (arthington et al. 2010; poff et al. 2010). chemical analysis of fish otoliths pro- vides a means of obtaining informative estimates of larval relative contribution to recruitment under varying hydrological conditions. when combined with standardised catch data and assessed over multiple years, this approach has the potential to provide valuable information on the dynamics of fish populations, both alien and native, and their responses to the alteration or restoration of natural flow regimes. sources and their acknowledgements for financial support this research was provided by the murray-darling basin authority and the victorian department of sustainability and
