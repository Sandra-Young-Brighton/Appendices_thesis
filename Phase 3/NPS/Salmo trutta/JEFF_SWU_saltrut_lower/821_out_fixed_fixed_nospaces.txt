climate change; european perch; feeding efficiency; sexual size dimorphism introduction aquatic ecosystems are changing. increased nutrient loading, increased water colour and dissolved organic matter are large-scale global issues (vuorenmaa et al. 2006; monteith et al. 2007; weyhenmeyer 2008; karlsson et al. 2009; zhang et al. 2010). as a conse- quence, the water transparency of lakes has decreased (hongve et al. 2004; erlandsson et al. 2008), which has strong and wide ranging effects on lake ecosys- tems and aquatic animals (winder & schindler 2004; ranaker et al. 2012). low water transparency may decrease food availability for fish. most fish species are primarily visual predators, and decreasing water transparency reduces their ability to detect and select prey (e.g. pekcan-hekim & lappalainen 2006; pek- can-hekim & horppila 2007), resulting in decreased growth through reduced feeding efficiency (estlander et al. 2010). decreasing visibility also results in indirect effects on fish prey availability by reducing the number of suitable foraging habitats (diehl 1988), as low trans- parency influences the productivity of littoral areas (estlander et al. 2010) and the thickness of the oxy- genated water layer and thermal stratification (rask et al. 2000). these direct and indirect effects reduce the size of the fish (tandler & mason 1983; batty et al. 1986; boeuf & le bail 1999). species for correspondence: s. estlander, biological centre, academy of sciences of the czech republic, hydrobiological institute, na sadkach 7, 37005 ceske budejovice, czech republic. e-mail: satu.estlander@helsinki.fi 544 doi: 10.1111/eff.12167 which predation is dependent on the sense of sight are more affected (estlander et al. 2010), but the effects of decreasing water transparency on fish may also vary within species (horppila et al. 2011). large individuals require more food to maintain bodily functions and are probably more sensitive to resource and food scarcity, due to higher metabolic demands to achieve the larger size (gotthard et al. 1994; blanckenhorn 1998). however, the size of a fish is also strongly dependent on a variety of other environ- mental variables, particularly developmental tempera- ture (atkinson 1994). in addition to deterioration of the optical properties of water, the temperature in aquatic ecosystems has also been predicted to rise (livingstone 1997; korho- nen 2006; jackson et al. 2007). for fish, water tem- perature is one of the major environmental factors affecting overall ecological performance (coutant 1987). for example, growth, feeding and activity are strongly associated with temperature (jobling 1994; p€ortner & peck 2010). it is well known that the rate of feeding and growth of fish increase with increas- ing temperature to some optimum value and decrease thereafter, as temperature continues to rise towards the upper temperature limits (jobling 1994, 1997; wootton 1998). differences in preferred temperatures vary not only between species but also within spe- cies, such as with size and age (jobling 1994; woot- ton 1998; p€ortner & peck 2010). overall, rising temperatures increase the metabolic rate, which leads to an increase in oxygen demand (e.g. cheung et al. 2013; verberk & atkinson 2013 baudron et al. 2014), and therefore, larger individu- als are thermally more sensitive, due to progressively falling oxygen supply capacity in relation to demand (p€ortner & peck 2010). such observations have inter- esting implications for fish, because size-specific responses to environmental gradients are also sex- dependent in species that exhibit sexual size dimor- phism (ssd) (teather & weatherhead 1988; ander- son et al. 1993; vedder et al. 2005). furthermore, sex-specific sensitivity may even have consequences at the population level, as many fish species show female-biased (females outgrow males) ssd and the reproductive success of females increases more rap- idly with size than in males (henderson et al. 2000). this female-biased size is a crucial factor in formulat- ing the community structure of fish populations, as large females are especially important in regulating reproductive success (birkeland & dayton 2005; venturelli et al. 2010; olin et al. 2012). here, we determined with laboratory experiments whether the effects of decreasing water transparency and increasing temperature on the feeding rate of individual fish are sex-dependent. european perch (perca fluviatilis l.) were selected as a model species sex-dependent effects of perch of a vision-oriented selective predator with female- biased ssd (craig et al. 1996; imsland et al. 1997) and a widespread key species in boreal lakes and europe (lehtonen et al. 2008). rennie et al. (2008) and horppila et al. (2011) suggested that in perch, the strategy applied in the trade-off between preda- tion threat and food acquisition may be gender- dependent. female perch need to maximise their feeding activity to ensure rapid growth, but males are less active and consume less, because male size is less important in reproduction (chambers & leggett 1996). in addition, fontaine et al. (1997) showed in a sister species, the american yellow perch [perca flavescens (mitchill)], that the growth rate of females decreased more steeply than that of males, in response to decreased feeding rate. we expected that the response to decreasing trans- parency would be stronger in females and reflected as a steeper decline in the feeding rate than in males, as prey detection is impaired at low transparency. we also expected that the response to temperature varia- tion would be stronger in females, due to higher met- abolic costs, than in males (rennie et al. 2008). as restricted feeding rates may reflect growth (hung & lutes 1987; hung et al. 1989; fontaine et al. 1997) and females require more energy to achieve a larger size than males, reduced visibility may have a rela- tively greater impact on female than male growth. as feeding rate experiments represent only short-term energy acquisition, we estimated the perch population size and gender-dependent lengths in lakes of differ- ent water transparency, to reveal the effect of reduced visibility on growth. horppila et al. (2011) found that gender-specific growth differences decrease with decreasing water transparency at the onset of matu- rity. therefore, we reanalysed the field data from lakes (2.2–13.8 ha; secchi disk nine small depth varies between 10 and 400 cm) to determine the gender-specific effects of water transparency on ssd at the population level. forest materials and methods experimental fish perch (n = 576) were captured with wire traps in lake majaj€arvi (area 3.8 ha, mean depth 4.6 m) dur- ing the end of the spawning season (early may) when their sex was easily detectable (the males were still running milt, and the newly spawned females could be detected from their soft belly and widened genital pore). fish of the same size were selected for the (length 10.9  0.60 cm and weight experiments 12.4  0.3 g), such that the difference in size would not affect the results. no differences in length [analy- sis of variance (anova), f1,575 = 0.602, p = 0.438] 545 estlander et al. or weight (f1,575 = 2.976, p = 0.195) were observed between the sexes. after capture, the fish were accli- mated under laboratory conditions for 1 week at 10 °c. to adapt fish to certain temperature treat- ments, the fish were moved to acclimating units, and temperature was raised from 10 °c to the water higher levels (max 5 °c/24 h) with aquarium heaters. we found no difference in the feeding rate between fish originating from clear or humic water (anova, f1,575 = 0.041, p = 0.839) in preliminary experi- ments. therefore, fish originating from humic water were chosen for the experiments, as they were more resistant against water mould (meinelt et al. 2007).  2s 0 n, 25°8 0 (61°13 experimental setup the experimental study was conducted in 1000–l experimental units (100 9 100 9 100 cm) in 2011. the experiments consisted of two levels of water transparency (clear: 5 mg ptl  1 and humic water: 340 mg ptl  1) at seven different temperatures, repre- senting cool (12, 14 °c), present average (16, 18, 20 °c) and forecasted higher (22, 24 °c) summer conditions of northern europe (carter et al. 2004; benestad 2005; elo 2005). the water transparency treatments represented naturally occurring levels (ku- llberg 1992; ojala & salonen 1999). the clear water 0 was taken from lake syrj€analunen (61°12 e) from lake majaj€arvi and humic water n, 0 25°8 e). the water was filtered in the experimental tanks through a 50-lm mesh net to remove food items. the light levels above the water surface of the experimental tanks were adjusted to represent twilight conditions (0.1 lmolm  1) (li–1400 datalogger with an li–192sa quantum sensor; li–cor bio- sciences–biotechnology, lincoln, ne, usa), because perch often show activity peaks at twilight (craig 1977; pekcan-hekim et al. 2005), regardless of water transparency (prchalova et al. 2010). the light atten-  1 in the clear tanks uation coefficient was 0.63 m  1 in the humic tanks. and 2.45 m instar length larvae fourth the 10  0.5 mm) of the phantom midge chaoborus flavicans (meigen) used as prey were collected with net density (1 ind.l the natural assemblage in majaj€arvi, where chaoborids are signif- icant planktonic prey for perch, as well as in other humic lakes in the area (estlander et al. 2009, 2010). after starvation for 2 days and acclimation to the temperatures given, the fish were moved to the exper- imental tanks (three males + three females per tank) and were left to acclimate for 6 h before the trials. at the beginning of each trial, 1000 individuals of c. flavicans were released into the tanks. the time of the trials (20 min) was set according to preliminary  1) was adjusted to represent from majaj€arvi. the (body hauls prey 546 experiments to ensure that the prey density would be sufficient and not all prey individuals would be con- sumed during the experiments. after the trials, the perch were removed from the tanks, weighed to the nearest milligram, measured to the nearest millimetre (total length) and their stomach contents analysed for the number of c. flavicans consumed, by counting the number of head capsules (horppila et al. 2004) in the stomachs. at each combination of water transpar- ency and temperature, six replicate experiments were conducted simultaneously. taking into account all necessary preparations for experiments, the total duration of laboratory experiments was approxi- mately 14 days. the experiments followed the regu- lations of the finnish animal welfare commission. field data 0 n, 25°12 the reanalysed data on perch length (horppila et al. 2010; olin et al. 2010) were from nine forest lakes 0 in the evo district (61°13 e) in southern finland, where the perch population sizes were esti- mated annually during 2005–2008 by the schnabel method (schnabel 1938; krebs 1999), using wire traps of 12-mm square mesh that capture perch of >8 cm (total length). these lakes are relatively small (2.2–13.8 ha), and most of them have been thor- oughly studied (estlander et al. 2009, 2010; horppila et al. 2010; olin et al. 2010) for abiotic and biotic factors, perch diet composition and fish assemblages. the study lakes are situated adjacently; the maxi- mum distance from one lake to another is 6 km. the possibility of fish dispersal between the lakes is low. the secchi disk depth varies between 10 and 400 cm and the mean values of annual water colour from 10 to 340 [95% confidence interval (ci)  10] mg ptl  1. the reanalysed perch data were taken from 2227 to 9815 individuals per lake. to describe the degree of ssd in lakes, 100 mature males and 100 mature females, length ranging from 120 to 190 mm, were selected randomly per lake for analysis. sexual dimorphism indices (sdis) were calculated, using the method of lovich & gibbons (1992):   a b   1 where a is the mean size of the largest sex, and b is the mean size of the smallest sex, arbitrarily defined as positive when females are larger and negative when males are larger. ssd indices (sdi) were plot- ted against the surface area, water transparency, total phosphorus concentration (total p) and perch popula- tion densities, because these factors affect the size of perch (olin et al. 2012). statistical analysis in the experiments, the differences in feeding rates of fish were assessed with a three-way full-factorial anova model. all the covariates (transparency, tem- perature and gender) were taken as categorical, as the feeding rate of fish and the temperature showed non- linear dependency. the model is as follows: feeding rate = gender (two levels) 9 temperature (seven lev- els) 9 transparency (two levels). the adjusted resid- uals were normally distributed, and the model explained (adjusted r square = 0.775), indicating a good fit for the model used. in the field data, pearson’s correlation coeffi- cient r was used to explore the association between the sdis and the measured biotic or abiotic factors of the lakes. all other variables were normally distrib- uted, but the perch population density was log-trans- formed to meet normality requirements. 77% of the variance results there was a significant interaction between tempera- ture, transparency and gender on the feeding rate of perch (fig. 1; table 1). a significant negative response transparency was detected in both sexes (table 1), but the response was significantly steeper in females than in males (fig. 1a, to decreasing water sex-dependent effects of perch b; table 1). the temperature variation significantly affected the feeding rates of both sexes (table 1), but differently depending on the water transparency (fig. 1a,b; table 1). in humic water, both sexes showed similar responses to temperature. the maxi- mum feeding rates of both genders were observed at 20–22 °c (males 97  51 larvae per fish; females 74  54 larvae per fish) (fig. 1b), but in clear water, the highest feeding rates of females were at 14–20 °c (179  23 larvae per fish) and males at 18–24 °c (147  11 larvae per fish) (fig. 1a). the response to temperature was different between the sexes (fig. 1a, b; table 1). at the temperature range 14–20 °c, the interaction between temperature and gender was not significant (f3,88 = 0.13, p = 0.946), whereas within the temperature range 20–24 °c in clear water, the interaction was significant (f2,30 = 14.27, p < 0.001), indicating a threshold at 20 °c (fig. 1a). in the field data, sdi correlated negatively with water transpar- ency (r =  0.781, p = 0.013), whereas no significant correlation was found with other factors (lake surface area; r = 0.174, p = 0.655, perch density; r = 0.299, p = 0.472, total p; r =  0.602, p = 0.086) (fig. 2). discussion due to higher energy demand for parental investment (e.g. henderson et al. 1996), the feeding activity of (a) (b) ) 1 – h s i f e a v r a l ( k n a t r e p e  t a r g n d e e i f e g a r e v a fig. 1. female (open circles) and male (open squares) perch average feeding rates on chaoborus flavicans (95% confidence intervals) at different summer temperatures (cool 12, 14 °c;

(2008) and horppila et al. (2011) also proposed that the smaller size of male perch compared with females is a result of decreased activity to reduce predation risk but at the expense of lower foraging rate. male perch may have shown lower feeding rates in the clear water treatments, in which the danger of being detected by predators is higher than in humic water, as low visibility may provide refuge to prey fish (skov et al. 2002). hence, the sexes may show different selective pressures regarding the trade-off between predation threat and food acquisition (rennie et al. 2008). there were no predators present in the experiments, but the fish used were wild-caught with learned fright responses to predator cues, and species- specific responses are detectable for at least 1 month without reinforcement (mathis et al.1996). in the highest temperature the gender-dependent response to temperature was detected distinctly in clear water, where the feeding rate of females was markedly higher than in males, except treatments (22–24 °c), where a contrasting trend was detected with a steep decline in female feeding efficiency and an increase in male feeding activity. in humic water, both sexes showed a typical response towards tem- perature variation described with ectothermic pro- cesses: an inverted u-shaped function with gradual descent from the maximum at the extremes (lin & regier 1995). these temperature-related differences 548 in feeding rate may be explained by gender-specific activity peaks caused by varying metabolism between the genders (rennie et al. 2008), as there was no size difference between the genders (p€ortner & peck 2010). at the higher temperatures, the females probably decreased their activity more than the males to pre- vent unnecessary energy loss due to foraging (e.g. wootton 1998), while the males were capable of maintaining and increasing their activity, due to lower metabolic costs (rennie et al. 2008). our results suggest a threshold at 20 °c, after which tem- peratures have divergent effects on the sexes. inter- estingly, shewmon et al. (2007) showed that perch cultured at constant high temperature (23 °c) also showed less ssd than perch cultured under lower, varying temperatures (approximately 5–25 °c). low water transparency appeared to be the single important factor limiting the feeding rate of most both genders, as temperature had no notable sex-spe- cific effect on feeding rates in the humic water treat- ments (fig. 1). however, as sex-specific submodels for estimating consumption and metabolism currently do not exist (rennie et al. 2008) and our study did not measure metabolism or activity as such, open questions on the gender-dependent responses to tem- perature still remain. in metabolic processes in our experiments, we measured the gender-spe- cific feeding rates representing short-term energy acquisition, and the acclimation periods to certain temperatures were relatively short. this could have affected the results by increasing feeding rates due to adjustment (e.g. bullock 1955). despite this possible effect, we discovered peak in feeding rate in the intermediate temperatures suggesting that the experiments still described the typical response to temperature variation (lin & re- gier 1995). the sex-dependent differences in feeding rate results presented in this study cannot be directly applied to changes in growth rate, because of the pos- sible experimental artefacts, and because individual fish may compensate for feeding rates by longer feeding durations, while growth is the result of the long-term net balance of energy acquisition and energy expenditure (wootton 1998). there are also several other variables such as season, diseases, nutrition, past thermal history of the fish which may affect fish (mccauley1977). the fish in the experiments were collected from the same lake at the same time, which reduce the possible bias from above factors. still, our experiments were supported by field data in which the magnitude of ssd in perch was strongly associ- ated with water the feeding activity may be the main factor affecting perch growth in the studied lakes. temperature preference and activity of transparency, suggesting that lower sex-dependent effects of perch 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 100 300 water transparency (µg pt/l) 200 400 0 0 5 10 15 lake surface area (ha) 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 6000 0 0 10 20 30 40 total p (µg p/l) ) i d s (  d s s f o e d u t i n g a m 0 0 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 2000 4000 perch density (ind./ha) fig. 2. relationship between the magnitude of ssd (sdi) in perch population and humic concentration (lg ptl perch density (ind.ha  1) and total p (lg pl  1) in nine forest lakes.  1), lake surface area (ha), fontaine et al. (1997) showed that limited food resources in yellow perch decrease the magnitude of ssd, as the growth rate of females decreases more steeply than that of males. for example, in the lakes studied here, the limitation of food may have been due to poor visibility, lack of suitable foraging habi- tats or other factors, such as fish density. however, as we analysed only the linear relationship between sdi and the abiotic and biotic factors selected, water trans- parency could also have indirectly regulated the ulti- mate factors behind ssd. especially in humic lakes, water transparency is one of the major factors that modify the productivity and availability of food (kar- lsson et al. 2009; estlander et al. 2012). it should also be noted that the results we presented may only be valid in small lakes with relatively simple ecosystem, but the factors affecting ssd in perch may be much more complicated in larger lake ecosystems. growth and production of perch were forecasted to be stimulated by rising water temperatures in north- ern europe (fobert et al. 2011), as long as the food supply is sufficient. however, the stimulative effect on fish growth may be revoked, because of decreas- ing water transparency. moreover, decreasing water transparency may cause changes in the thermal stratification and surface temperature of lakes, thus affecting overall lake productivity. for example, the heat content of lakes is negatively correlated with water colour (houser 2006). the present study suggests that decreasing water transparency and rising temperatures in aquatic eco- systems may potentially affect the mean size of fish populations, reflected as gender-specific responses, through feeding rate and growth. similar effects of habitat disturbances are likely to occur in many ani- mal taxa (dodd & dreslik 2008). sex-dependent environmental sensitivity is a well-known phenome- non in birds (e.g. velando 2002; brommer et al. 2003; raberg et al. 2005) and spiders (høye & ham- mel 2010). in species that exhibit ssd, the larger sex often suffers more than the smaller one when food sources are restricted (hipkiss et al. 2002). thus, we suggest that gender-specific responses should be anal- ysed separately in studies on the ecological effects of changing environment. acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the r. erik serlachius
