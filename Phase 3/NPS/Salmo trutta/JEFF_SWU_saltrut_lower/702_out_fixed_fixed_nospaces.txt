lateral-line; gobiomorphus; adaptation; plasticity introduction through natural selection, species have developed adaptations which allow them to thrive in particular environments. many species of plants and animals, termed ‘specialists’, have specialised morphologies for a narrow niche, and as a result are only found in habitats with a particular set of conditions. however, some species are able to fill a range of niches, surviv- ing in diverse habitats, and are thus known as ‘gener- alists’. there are many examples of generalist and specialist fish, with habitat-specialists often only associated with particular velocities, sub- strate, water chemistry or food sources, and with hab- itat-generalists occurring across a much wider range of conditions (e.g., bain et al. 1988; jowett & richardson 2003; griffiths 2006, 2010). behavioural freshwater and phenotypic variation amongst individuals of these broad-niche generalist species may allow indi- viduals to adapt to the more specific conditions of their particular habitat (see bolnick daniel et al. 2003; devictor et al. 2010). behavioural adaptations in feeding, learnt individually or socially (see brown & laland 2003; kelley & magurran 2003), may include changes in diel feeding activity and habitat use to avoid predators (e.g., reebs 2002; stuart- smith et al. 2007; martin et al. 2010), and changes in feeding strategy and prey selectivity in response to available cover and levels of turbidity (e.g., savino and stein 1989a; 1989b; carter et al. 2010). pheno- typic specialisation may, for example include changes in body shape, fin size and sensory structures that enhance feeding abilities in a particular environment (e.g., ehlinger 1990; matthews et al. 2010; wellenreuther correspondence: j. p. vanderpham, vanderpham consulting, 4752 25th ave. sw, seattle, wa, usa. e-mail: info@vanderpham.com 596 doi: 10.1111/eff.12064 et al. 2010; gerry et al. 2011). specialisation may arise through adaptive phenotypic plasticity whereby variation in the extent of gene expression allows rapid morphological adaptation within an individual or in one or two generations to changing biotic and abiotic conditions (e.g., pigliucci 2001; imre 2002; mccauley et al. 2008; dunn 2011). phenotypic spe- cialisation may also be a result of natural variability in morphology within a population, with those indi- viduals with inappropriate phenotypes being excluded from certain habitats (see edelaar et al. 2008). fluid-filled in new zealand, the habitat-generalist common bully (gobiomorphus cotidianus), a small (generally 60–100 mm total length), benthic, freshwater fish, is widespread in rivers and lakes (mcdowall 2000). in contrast, the closely related redfin bully (gobiomor- phus huttoni), also a small (commonly up to 80– 100 mm total length), benthic, freshwater fish, is a fluvial habitat-specialist occurring only in rivers (mcdowall 2000). these two species often co-exist in rivers (jowett & richardson 2003) and provide a good comparison for investigation of interspecific variation in feeding abilities. the common bully also provides a good test-species for intraspecific habitat- related behavioural and phenotypic variation, particu- larly with regard to variation in the mechanosensory lateral-line system. the lateral-line system of fish comprises a network of clustered mechanoreceptor organs, called neuromasts, used to detect mechanical motion in a fish’s environment. they may be located externally on the epidermis of the head and body of the animal (superficial neuromasts), or within subepi- dermal neuromasts) connected to the epidermal surface by pores (mont- gomery et al. 2000; coombs & braun 2003; janssen 2004). recent studies have identified greater varia- tion in lateral-line morphology in common than red- fin bullies, which may relate to the wider breadth of habitat-niche of the common bully (vanderpham 2012; vanderpham et al. 2013). within common bul- lies, studies have identified more total oculoscapular canal pores in fluvial populations compared to lacus- trine ones (michel et al. 2008; vanderpham et al. 2013), and thus, this increase may serve as an adapta- tion to riverine conditions. the canal neuromasts associated with such pores are used to sense water displacement and are important in locating prey, par- ticularly in high turbulence and high velocity condi- tions where superficial neuromasts (i.e., those on the surface of the fish rather than enclosed in canals) may be compromised by over-stimulation (see engel- mann et al. 2002; coombs & braun 2003; kanter & coombs 2003; janssen 2004; bleckmann & zelick 2009). bassett et al. (2006) showed that a common bully superficial neuromasts is most sensitive in still water, and com- canals (canal lateral-line system of only feeding ability of a habitat-generalist promised in flowing water. this suggests that the pat- tern of more oculoscapular canal pores in fluvial common bullies may be a result of habitat-related selective pressures and may influence their ability to feed in varied hydrodynamic conditions. the first aim of this study was to test the feeding abilities of common and redfin bullies under varying hydrodynamic conditions to provide a measure of the adaptive value of different physical or behavioural adaptations. we predicted that feeding by redfin bul- lies would be less affected by turbulence than com- mon bullies as redfin bullies, being fluvial-habitat specialists, are expected to be specialised to cope with such conditions. the second aim was to test for habitat-related intraspecific variation in feeding suc- cess amongst common bullies from different habitat types as an indication of habitat-specific adaptations amongst individuals or populations. following the first prediction, if the redfin bully is specialised to fluvial conditions, we predicted that, similarly, com- mon bullies from higher velocity, turbulent fluvial habitats would be less affected by turbulence than those from still-water habitats. the final aim of this study was to investigate relationships between varia- tion in oculoscapular canal pores and feeding abilities of common bullies in particular hydrodynamic condi- tions. we predicted a positive correlation between total oculoscapular canal pores and feeding ability in turbulence as more pores have been associated with riverine conditions in past research (vanderpham et al. 2013). methods to investigate the feeding abilities of a fluvial habi- tat-specialist and a habitat-generalist, we compared feeding (defined in this study as the proportion of prey consumed) by redfin and common bullies in still and turbulent aquaria. intraspecific habitat-related variation in feeding was tested by comparing the pro- portion of prey consumed in still and turbulent aqua- ria by common bullies from all habitat types in which they occur – coastal rivers (with no down- stream lake habitat), lakes and rivers upstream of lakes. inclusion of both fluvial habitat-types (coastal rivers and rivers upstream of lakes) was important in our analysis of the relationship between feeding abil- ity and lateral-line system variation, as previous stud- ies have observed differences in the number of oculoscapular canal pores between these two habitat types (michel et al. 2008; vanderpham et al. 2013). we investigated the relationship between lateral-line system variation and feeding abilities by conducting all experiments in the dark to prevent the use of visual cues in feeding, thus requiring use of a mechanosensory system to locate prey. previous 597 vanderpham et al. research has demonstrated common bully feeding by use of nonvisual cues in the dark (rowe 1999; rowe et al. 2001; vanderpham et al. 2012). in our analysis of lateral-line system morphology, we have only included total oculoscapular canal pores, as no habi- tat-related patterns of variation in dorsal head superfi- cial neuromasts were found in previous research (vanderpham 2012). collection and maintenance of study organisms all common and redfin bullies were collected from coastal otago on the south island of new zealand. coastal river common bullies were collected by back- pack electrofishing in the tokomairiro river at a location approximately five kilometres upstream of its outlet to the sea (see linz. 2009a). additional coastal river common bullies were also collected by backpack electrofishing in sawmill creek (also known as duckbend creek), a small stream approxi- mately one kilometre south of the taieri river mouth (see linz. 2009b). the collection area of sawmill creek was within 300 m of its outlet to the sea and was a large main-channel pool with the appearance of a still-water habitat, having no visible surface tur- bulence and no flow for extended periods as a result of the natural formation of a downstream sand-dune berm (lill et al. 2012). this site allowed for further investigation of habitat-specific feeding abilities and adaptations as it presented a relatively still habitat within a river. lake common bullies were collected by seine netting along the western shoreline of lake waihola, a medium-sized (5.4 km2 surface area), shallow (mean depth 1.3 m, maximum depth 2 m) tidally influenced lake (main & irwin 1987; schallen- berg et al. 2003), approximately 10 km inland from the sea via the taieri river (see linz. 2009b). upstream river common bullies were collected by backpack electrofishing approximately one and a half kilometres upstream of lake waihola in alex creek, a small 2nd-order stream that drains to the south-east side of the lake (see linz. 2009a). redfin bullies were also collected from alex creek from the same reach as the common bullies. the fish collected ran- ged in size from 29 to 80 mm standard length (sl) (table 1). all bullies were acclimated to the conditions of the experimental room in the department of zoology at the university of otago, dunedin in plastic holding tanks (internal dimension of 39 cm length by 29.5 cm width by 30 cm height) for a minimum of one week before beginning experimental trials. between 20 and 30 fish of each species and from each collection location were held in separate tanks filled to a depth of approximately 25 cm with 5% saltwater/95% spring-water solution. the saltwater was added to the spring-water to minimise bacterial infections in fish. the holding tanks each contained 10 randomly scattered 10 cm length sections of 3.2- cm-internal-diameter pvc tubes that provided cover. to maintain water quality, one air-driven activated carbon and polyester batting filter was continually run in each holding tank, and twice weekly, detritus on the bottom of the tanks was suctioned out and about 25% of the water replaced with fresh water. while in holding tanks, fish were fed once a day on a diet of thawed bloodworms and live mysid shrimp (tenagomysis spp.) to satiation. mysid shrimp were collected from the kaikorai lagoon, an estuary south of dunedin, and kept in a separate holding tank with 5% saltwater:95% spring-water solution for a mini- mum of 3 days before being used in experiments. the holding room was on a reversed 12-h dark:12-h light-cycle to acclimate fish to the running of experi- ments in the dark during daytime hours. tenagomysis spp. are widespread in coastal lowland habitats throughout new zealand and represented a readily available prey item of approximately uniform size table 1. summary of total redfin and common bullies collected from each location, experimental treatment applied to them and mean standard length (sl) with standard deviation (sd). location redfin bullies alex stream habitat type experimental treatment river upstream of lake common bullies tokomairiro river coastal river sawmill creek coastal river ‘pond’ lake waihola lake alex stream river upstream of lake 598 still turbulent still turbulent still turbulent still turbulent still turbulent n 13 14 8 8 11 11 23 23 22 24 mean sl (mm) sd 60.32 60.08 37.66 36.97 44.49 45.33 35.97 35.32 54.58 47.21 8.11 9.11 6.33 6.85 4.22 11.10 4.28 3.31 9.44 8.59 that was likely to be encountered by both species at least occasionally in their natural habitat. although common bully would be more likely to encounter this prey item naturally, both species readily ate this prey without any apparent bias in the holding aquaria. experimental design to compare the relative effect of turbulence on feed- ing by common and redfin bullies, we set up a series of 12 still and 12 turbulent aquaria. turbulence can be defined as variation in the direction and magnitude of velocity vectors with time (see davidson 2004; lesieur 2008), and using forced air, we created turbu- lent conditions in experimental aquaria. the 24 aqua- ria (internal dimension of 39 cm length by 29.5 cm width by 30 cm height) were filled to a depth of 13.5 cm with 18 l of fresh 5% filtered saltwater: 95% spring-water solution. a 10 cm length section of 3.2-cm-internal-diameter (+0.3 cm thickness) pvc was placed lengthwise in the bottom of each tank and secured in place using black duct tape (fig. 1) to provide a source of cover for fish. in 12 of our exper- imental aquaria – ‘turbulent aquaria’, a 0.5-cm- diameter air hose was positioned in each corner fac- ing straight down two cm from the bottom of the aquaria and secured in place with black duct tape. two electromagnetic air compressors (boyu, model acq009, 240 v, fre 50 hz, 185 w power, 160 lmin  1 output) each pumped air into separate one cm diameter tubing to a 16-hose splitter to the 0.5 cm diameter tubing in the corners of the turbulent aquaria. in the remaining aquaria – ‘still aquaria’, a feeding ability of a habitat-generalist to the turbulent 0.5-cm-diameter hose was placed into each corner, identical tank set-up, but not connected to the air compressors, and thus not receiv- ing forced air. all aquaria were also aerated with a single air-stone taped to the front lower left corner of each aquarium, connected to a small electric air pump to ensure ample oxygenation. to compare the relative levels of turbulence in the still and turbulent aquaria, we compared variation in water velocities in one ran- domly selected turbulent and one randomly selected still aquarium with a marsh mcbirney, inc. flo-mate, model 2000, portable flow-meter. with the bottom of the open-channel-velocity sensor 1.5 cm off the bot- tom of the aquarium (the lowest setting), five two- second velocity readings were taken at each of 28 locations in each aquarium (fig. 1), and the level of variation in velocity at each location was calculated. overall variation in velocity was significantly higher in the turbulent aquarium than the still aquarium (tur- bulent aquarium variance = 0.006, still aquarium var- iance <0.001), (f-test of variance; f279, 279 = 0.0793, p < 0.0001) (see ‘data analysis’ section below). variation in velocity was significantly higher at 23 of the 28 velocity recording points in the turbulent aquarium compared to the still aquarium (f-test of variance; p < 0.050 for comparisons at 23/28 loca- tions). we present variation in velocity (rather than mean velocity) as the more meaningful statistic, as variation in the direction of water flow (positive and negative water velocities were continuously recorded) rendered meaningful measurement of mean water velocities experienced at small scales impossible with the equipment available. air hose aeration stone direction of water movement measured pvc fig. 1. overhead schematic view of an experimental aquarium set-up and locations of water velocity readings. arrows indicate the direc- tion of water movement (i.e., velocity) recorded. in still tanks, the air hoses are present but with no air being pumped through them. 599 vanderpham et al. fish were placed at random into each of the indi- vidual experimental aquaria, with one fish per aquar- ium, alternating between turbulent and still aquaria for fish from each location to achieve an approxi- mately equal number of fish in each treatment from each location per trial. they were allowed to accli- mate to experimental aquaria conditions for 24 h before beginning the experiment. all fish were fed in the holding tanks immediately prior to being put into experimental aquaria but were not fed during the acclimation period to ensure they were not satiated during the experiment. each experimental period began at 10:00 am, immediately after which the lights were turned off, and concluded 6 h later at 4:00 pm. at the start of an experimental period, 15 mysid shrimp (between 5 and 8 mm total length) were placed into each aquarium as a source of prey. at the conclusion of each experimental period, red lights were used to assist fish removal from the tanks with minimal light disturbance, and fish were euthan- ised in a solution of 2-phenoxyethanol and then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for later morpholog- ical analysis. at the end of an experimental period, the numbers of remaining mysid shrimp in each aquarium were counted to determine the proportion consumed during the experimental period as an indi- cation of feeding success. between experimental tri- als, the aquaria were thoroughly rinsed with fresh spring-water and then refilled to remove potential conspecific chemical cues. laboratory analysis in the laboratory, fish were preserved in 70% ethanol before handling. under a dissecting microscope, two morphological measurements were taken: (i) standard length (sl) in mm and (ii) a count of the number of lateral-line system oculoscapular canal pores on the dorsal surface of the head from immediately posterior to the eyes and dorsally to the anterior tip of the snout. additionally, recent studies have identified asymmetry in oculoscapular canal pores (michel et al. 2008; vanderpham et al. 2013). to assess the relationship between pore asymmetry and feeding ability under varying hydrodynamic conditions, we recorded the difference in the number of pores between the left and right sides of the head for all fish and recorded this difference as the level of asym- metry. data analysis all statistical analyses were conducted in the open source statistical environment r (version 2.13.0; r development core team 2011). comparisons of aquaria conditions under the two treatments were 600 made with two separate variance tests using f statis- tics to: (i) compare heterogeneity in variance of water velocity between all individual measurement points in still and turbulent aquaria and (ii) compare overall heterogeneity of variance in water velocity between still and turbulent aquaria (see ‘experimental setup’ above). species and location relationship to feeding to compare the effect of turbulence on redfin and common bully feeding, we used ageneralised linear mixed-effect model with penalised quasi-likelihood (glmmpql, in the mass package, version 7.3-16, venables & ripley 2002) and quasi-binomial error distribution (logit-link). in this analysis, the propor- tion of prey consumed was fitted as the response var- iable (proportion of prey consumed was the response variable in all models) and species, treatment (turbu- lent or still aquaria), and the interaction of species and treatment as the fixed effects. we also fitted stan- dard length (sl) of fish as a fixed effect to control for individual variation in length; this fixed effect was fitted to all models in our analyses. additionally, the collection location of individuals (e.g., tokomair- iro river) was fitted as a random effect, which modelled nonindependence arising due to some indi- viduals being sampled from the same location. direct comparisons in feeding between species (i.e., total amount consumed) cannot be made as there are numerous reasons why different species may feed at similar or different rates. therefore, we have limited the analysis to comparisons of feeding response, within species, in relation to the change in hydrody- namic conditions. we were also interested in testing the effect of local adaptation on feeding ability in common bullies in still and turbulent conditions. to do this, we used a generalised linear model (glm) with quasi- binomial error distribution (logit-link) with data only from common bullies. we fitted our response vari- able (proportion of prey consumed) against collection location (e.g., tokomairiro river), treatment (turbu- lent vs. still) and the interaction between collection location and treatment as fixed effects. this glm was repeated with each collection location as the intercept (i.e., four locations, thus glm run four times) for comparisons between all locations of the effect of turbulence on feeding success. lateral-line pores relationship to feeding we also investigated whether pore morphology directly affected feeding ability in common bullies. to analyse for a relationship between the total num- ber of oculoscapular canal pores and feeding in com- mon bullies, a glmmpql with quasi-binomial error distribution was run. this glmmpql fitted the total oculoscapular canal pores, response variable (proportion of prey consumed) against treatment (turbulent vs. still) and the interaction of total oculo- scapular canal pores and treatment as fixed effects. this model also included sl as a fixed effect and collection location as a random effect. an analysis of the relationship between pore asymmetry and feeding was conducted by running a final glmmpql with quasi-binomial error distribution with our response variable against asymmetry level, treatment and an interaction between asymmetry level and treatment as fixed effects. again, we also included sl as a fixed effect and collection location as a random effect. to test for a difference between total oculoscapular canal pores between collection locations for common bul- lies, we ran a glm with quasi-poisson error distribu- tion (log-link) with total pores against location, and sl as a fixed effect. results species and location relationship to feeding (mean proportion significant (glmmpql; common bullies fed less in turbulent (mean propor- tion consumed = 0.34, se = 0.04, n = 66) than still consumed = 0.48, conditions se = 0.03, n = 64) (fig. 2), a difference that was sta- b =  0.56, tistically se = 0.22, t =  2.58, df = 149, p = 0.011). in con- trast, redfin bully feeding was not significantly differ- ent between treatments (mean proportion consumed in turbulent aquaria 0.31, se = 0.07, n = 14;

bleckmann & zelick 2009; tritico & cotel 2010). with the fluvial-specialist redfin bully, we were unable to detect a significant affect of turbulence on feeding which may be a reflection of more specia- lised morphological and behavioural adaptations to turbulent conditions. the improved abilities of redfin bullies in fluvial habitats compared to common bul- lies are further demonstrated by redfin bullies’ stron- 602 ger climbing abilities (baker 2003; baker & boubee 2006) and greater inland penetration in diadromous populations (mcdowall 1998). additionally, this study and other recent research showed almost no variation in the number or arrange- ment of oculoscapular canal pores or superficial neu- romasts in redfin bullies but a large amount of variation in common bullies (michel et al. 2008; vanderpham 2012; vanderpham et al. 2013). this refinement in pore morphology implies their impor- tance in the fluvial habitat-specialisation of redfin bullies and may play a role in their feeding abilities in turbulent, flowing waters. on average, redfin bul- lies possess more oculoscapular canal pores than common bullies (vanderpham et al. 2013). pores and associated canal neuromasts are known to be impor- tant in feeding, particularly in turbulent conditions where superficial neuromasts may be over-stimulated (e.g., engelmann et al. 2002; bassett et al. 2006). the difference therefore, in pore morphology between the two species may be largely responsible for a decreased effect of turbulence on redfin bully feeding compared to the common bully. there are many examples of generalist species being able to survive in a wide range of habitats, but within any particular habitat-type being less successful at extract- ing resources than specialised species (e.g., partridge & green 1987; wilson & yoshimura 1994; caley & munday 2003). however, as we identified a rela- tively greater increase in feeding by common bullies in still conditions, compared to redfin bullies, the common bully may be better adapted to lower turbu- lence habitats. therefore, in rivers, common bullies may have a competitive advantage in lower turbu- lence microhabitats, such as pools, interstitial spaces of substrate and stream margins, allowing them to successfully co-exist with the fluvial-specialist redfin bully (see bolnick daniel et al. 2003; gabler & amundsen 2010). common bullies from all locations showed wide variation in the proportion of prey consumed in both still and turbulent aquaria. this result demonstrates a greater range in feeding abilities within populations than predicted, and the ability to feed successfully in turbulent conditions regardless of their natural habi- tat. the feeding abilities of common bullies from three of the four locations appear to be negatively affected by turbulence, but from one coastal river location, the tokomairiro river, they fed on average more in turbulent than still aquaria. this plasticity in feeding abilities is likely an important characteristic of the species, which allows it to occur across a range of hydrodynamic conditions. however, we found no clear, statistically significant pattern of habitat-related variation in feeding abilities to support our prediction of a decreased effect of turbulence on fish from flu- vial habitats. there was also no relationship between locations and total oculoscapular pores to explain variability in fish feeding. the only significant effect of turbulence we identified was on the feeding of common bullies from sawmill creek, our coastal river pool site. this may relate to their development in a pool with minimal turbulence and little or no flow (see lill et al. 2012), thus experiencing minimal selective pressures fluvial morphological or behavioural adaptations. the site was also located within 300 m of the sea, greatly limiting the distance of upstream migration of amphidromous juvenile common bullies to this pool. amphidromous bullies further inland likely experience greater selective pres- sures for turbulent, fluvial specialisation with more time spent migrating up rivers regardless of the type of habitat (i.e., pool or riffle) selected as adults (see mcdowall 2000; closs et al. 2003; hicks 2011 for details of common bully diadromy). for feeding ability of a habitat-generalist this study provided no evidence to support our prediction of increased feeding ability in turbulence by common bullies with more developed lateral-line pore morphology. this result is surprising given the particular importance of canal neuromasts (and asso- ciated pores) in feeding in other species (e.g., coo- mbs et al. 2001; coombs & braun 2003; janssen 2004) and the compromised function of common bully lateral-line systems that comprise only superfi- cial neuromasts in flowing water (bassett et al. 2006). the results may reflect the equal or greater importance of other morphological traits in feeding in the turbulent conditions we created. more detailed morphological analyses may shed light on other feed- ing-related phenotypic adaptations. for example, superficial neuromasts are important in swimming and orientation, and variations in these structures may relate to the differences in feeding we identified (see montgomery et al. 2000; coombs & braun 2003). furthermore, a study by montgomery et al. (2002) showed the importance of integration of superficial neuromasts and canal neuromasts in prey capture in the dark. additionally, variation in the physiology of individual canal neuromasts may be related to feeding abilities (see coombs et al. 2001; coombs & braun 2003), and not necessarily to the pore structures alone. a distinction between canal neuromasts and superficial neuromasts should also be noted here. during embryogenesis and through larval development, formation and differentiation of superfi- cial and presumptive canal neuromasts (those located superficially but with canal neuromasts physiology) occurs. subsequent canal formation occurs during the larval and early juvenile phase, enclosing neuromasts within canals linked by pores to the external environ- ment (see webb & shirey 2003). however, in com- mon bullies, is possible that some presumptive canal neuromasts remain on the surface into adult- hood (see vanderpham et al. 2013). thus, while pores are an indication of canal neuromasts, caution must be used when using this as an indication of canal versus superficial neuromast developmental adaptation. further investigation of individual neuro- mast structure and function in common bullies may prove valuable in understanding the relationships between canal and superficial neuromasts variation as habitat-related adaptations. it the effect of turbulence on the common bully may reflect a trade-off limitation of a habitat-generalist life- history, as we were unable to identify a significant effect of turbulence on a closely related habitat-spe- cialist. our data also suggests some intraspecific habi- tat-related variation in feeding abilities of a generalist and their adaptability to varied hydrodynamic condi- tions. however, the great deal of variation we identi- fied in feeding by common and redfin bullies from all 603 vanderpham et al. locations in both still and turbulent conditions demon- strates complexity in the abilities of individual fish, possibly related to phenotypic variation or microhabi- tat use. for example, the variation present in common bully pore morphology, even within a single habitat- type and sampling location (see michel et al. 2008; vanderpham et al. 2013), may reflect adaptation of individuals to microhabitats, such as pools, interstitial spaces in the substratum or along stream margins where turbulence is reduced (see bourke et al. 1997; bolnick daniel et al. 2003). our artificial experimen- tal environment may have inhibited use of specialised adaptations important to feeding in particular biotic or abiotic conditions, as differing habitat preferences have been documented in both common and redfin bullies (jowett & richardson 1995, 2003). for exam- ple, interstitial spaces of large cobble in rivers may provide refuge from flow, while simultaneously allow- ing the ambushing of prey (see inoue et al. 2005). fur- thermore, the hydrodynamic conditions we created in the aquaria will differ from those occurring in rivers. for example, common bullies typically inhabit reaches where water velocity is more uniform and relatively unidirectional, in contrast to the chaotically turbulent aquarium conditions. therefore, they may have adap- tations to riverine environments, but not specifically to turbulence. additionally, the feeding success of indi- viduals in turbulent tanks may result from their use of pockets of less turbulent water within each tank. fur- ther experiments with a range of hydrodynamic condi- tions may provide a greater understanding of habitat- specific adaptations in common and redfin bullies. there are likely clear differences in the prey choice of bullies between natural habitats and experimental aquaria. fluvial bullies may, for example have feed- ing adaptations geared towards benthic prey (sagar & eldon 1983; mcdowall 2000), rather than prey which moves within the water column like the mysid shrimp used in this experiment (see larkin et al. 2007). sta- tistically significant differences in interspecific and intraspecific feeding abilities may also have been masked by the large amount of within-location varia- tion we identified, and more distinct patterns may become evident with more replication and longer experimental periods. further experimentation includ- ing fish from additional sampling locations – particu- larly more extremely still or turbulent habitats and microhabitats, and including other biotic and abiotic factors, as well as broader morphological analyses, may provide additional into habitat-related adaptations of generalist and specialist species. insight acknowledgements the department of zoology at the university of otago pro- vided all field and laboratory equipment for this
