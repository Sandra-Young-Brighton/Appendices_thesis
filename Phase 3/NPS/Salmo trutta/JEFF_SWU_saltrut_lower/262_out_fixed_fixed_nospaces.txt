university of jyväskylä, finland abstract – an 11-year time series of hydroacoustic ﬁsh density estimates and ﬁsheries statistics of vendace (coregonus_albula (l.)) from four zones of a lake differing in trawling intensity was analyzed in order to test the hypothesis that intensive trawling has detrimental effects on pelagic ﬁsh stocks, especially vendace recruitment. the standardized ﬁsh density esti- mate in trawled zones showed no decrease in comparison to the non- trawled zone. no signs of recruitment failure associable with trawling intensity were found. the growth of vendace at the end of the study period was slower than that at the beginning, indicating a higher density, most clearly so in the zone with highest trawling intensity. no signiﬁcant corre- lations were detected between 3-year mean trawling intensity and yield per unit effort of over-1-year-old vendace or ﬁsh density in any zone. thus, no evidence to support the hypothesis was found. this was sug- gested to be due to density-dependent compensatory processes in recruit- ment and/or natural mortality effectively counteracting the population change induced by exploitation. key words: vendace; coregonusalbula;

tra- ditional seining in commercial ﬁshing for vendace in finnish lakes. the number of trawling units in- creased from less than 20 in 1982 (niskanen 1985) to about 100 in 1990 (muje & lahti 1992). as a consequence, the ﬁshing effort expended on pel- agic ﬁsh stocks has increased markedly in many lakes, and concern for the potential negative ef- fects of trawling on pelagic ﬁsh stocks has emerged. on the one hand, trawling has been dem- onstrated to cause considerable mortality of young-of-the-year vendace that escape through the cod end (suuronen et al. 1995). on the other hand, the trawl has been claimed, mostly by recreational, subsistence and semi-commercial ﬁshermen, to be too effective for harvesting vendace stocks, both in terms of recruitment and growth overﬁshing. how- ever, no cases of such effects have yet been docu- mented. the trawling conﬂicts often prevail due to the lack of basic knowledge on effects of long-term ex- ploitation. a prerequisite for this knowledge is analysis of time-series data from ﬁsh stocks under different levels of exploitation. lake puulavesi in central finland offers good opportunities for this type of study. there, the pioneering trawling attempts took place in autumn 1986, and the ﬁrst commercial trawling enterprise was set up in 1987. the number of trawls increased to ﬁve within a few years. in 1996, three trawling units ﬁshed regularly 65 marjoma¨ki et al. in the lake. the intensity of trawling has varied within the lake due to the ﬁshing cooperatives’ variable policies towards trawling licenses, from areas of no trawling to intensive trawling. the pel- agic ﬁsh density and vendace population structure has been monitored by hydro-acoustics, catch and effort statistics and catch samples in the lake since 1986, i.e., from the time before the onset of traw- ling. the objective of this study was to compare the 11-year time series of acoustic ﬁsh density esti- mates and vendace stock indices from four zones of a lake differing in trawling intensity. it was ex- pected, assuming no effective compensation in population parameters, that pelagic ﬁsh density and yield per unit of effort (ypue) of vendace would decrease along with the increase in trawling effort resulting in lowest densities and ypues in the zones of highest trawling intensity. material and methods study area and its ﬁsh stocks lake puulavesi in central finland covers an area of 325 km2. this study was carried out in a 200- km2 sector of the lake (fig. 1), which has a mean depth of 12 m and a maximum depth of 70 m. the study area is morphologically heterogeneous, consisting of two large and many minor basins, and also some archipelagic areas with narrow straits. the lake is oligotrophic, with a total phos- phorus content of 3–7 mg ` l»1, a total nitrogen content of 400–500 mg ` l»1 and color content of 20 mg pt ` l»1. the pelagic ﬁsh assemblage consists mainly of vendace and smelt (osmerus eperlanus (l.)). the transition zone between littoral and pelagic areas is inhabited by whiteﬁsh (coregonus_lavaretus (l.) s.l.). exploratory gill netting and trawling surveys indicate that populations of perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) and roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)) in pelagic areas are negligible. the vendace population ﬂuctuates considerably. according to seining catch statistics, abundant year classes emerged in 1988, 1992, 1994 and 1996 (marjomäki & huolila 1994, 1995a, and own un- published data). the stock was very low in 1990– 1991. the vendace reach sexual maturity during their second autumn at the age 1„. in addition to trawling, vendace are ﬁshed with gill nets and seines. during 1984–1996, the annual yield of vendace varied between 20 and 120 metric tons. recently, the proportion of this yield caught by trawl has exceeded 70%. vendace biology and ﬁsheries in lake puulavesi has been described in more detail by marjomäki (1990) and mar- jomäki & huolila (1995b). 66 fig. 1. study area in lake puulavesi. zone codes a-d refer to the study zones in table 1 the study area was divided into four zones on the basis of trawl ﬁshing intensity (fig. 1, table 1). the borders of the zones were set to shallow straits and, therefore, migration of ﬁsh between zones was assumed to be minor. if a distinct basin was not clearly connected to any particular zone, its area was divided between all the zones bordering it. thus, the division of the lake is somewhat subjec- tive and, therefore, the areal indices should be re- garded merely as rank-order variables rather than absolute ﬁgures. hydroacoustic survey a hydroacoustic survey was carried out annually from 1986. the data were collected with a sim- rad ey-m echo sounder and a 70–24-f trans- ducer. the settings of the equipment were: sound frequency 70 khz, pulse duration 0.6 ms, pulse fre- quency 182 min»1, half power beam width 11.2(cid:190), pelagic ﬁsh stocks and trawling intensity table 1. characteristics of the study zones. all

transect routes were set according to location possibilities, sailing safety and coverage of the deeper parts of the basin. secondly, eight of the basins were further stratiﬁed by depth structure into 10- to 20-m-deep and over-20-m-deep areas. the echoes from these areas were analyzed separ- ately. the area over 20 m in depth, as indicated in maps, was very inaccurate in some basins and those basins were therefore not stratiﬁed by depth. the echo-sounding estimate of ﬁsh density (individuals ` ha»1) in a depth stratiﬁed basin b in certain year was calculated by db‰ab,d10/ab ` db,d10„ab,d20/ab ` db,d20 symbols d10 and d20 refer to 10- to 20-m-deep and over-20-m-deep sections of the area a. for an un- stratiﬁed basin, a simple average ﬁsh density was used. the mean ﬁsh density of the section of the zone over 10 m deep consisting of many surveyed basins was then estimated by dz ‰ onb (ab ` db)/ onb ab b ‰ 1 b ‰ 1 where ab‰ the area of over-10-m-deep water in the

ex- ample, systematic over or underestimation of den- sity due to unrepresentative transect route setting. the annual (y) density estimates of different zones were standardized (std) in relation to average den- sity in 1986 and 1987 by stdz,y‰dz,y/((dz,86„dz,87)/2) fisheries statistics trawl ﬁshing was monitored by daily ﬁshing rec- ords of three trawling units and annual postal in- quiry of one unit. the annual index of the trawling intensity was calculated by 67 the survey was carried out during four nights of mid-august from 2.5 h after sunset to 1 h before sunrise. the thermocline was located at depth of 10–20 m during the survey. fish echoes were very seldom detected in areas shallower than 10 m. therefore, the analysis of pelagic ﬁsh density was restricted to areas with bottom depth deeper than this. the recorded data were digitized and analyzed by the hydroacoustic data acquisition system (lindem data acquisition), which was calibrated with a standard copper sphere of »39.2 db nom- inal target strength. the system produced the ﬁsh density estimates and target strength distribution using the modiﬁed craig & forbes (1969) method. most of the echo data were analyzed in 2- to 3-m depth intervals, and the analysis was restricted to the depth layer from 2 m below the surface to 1 m above the bottom. the lowest target strength class considered as ﬁsh was »56 db. it was not possible to divide the targets into length classes or species on the grounds of target strength distribution be- cause of the overlapping length distribution of dif- ferent species and subpopulations and the small size of ﬁsh in relation to accuracy of target strength estimation (marjomäki & huolila 1995a). in years of highest ﬁsh densities, the single ﬁsh resolution of certain transects was less than 10%. therefore, it is questionable whether the hydro- acoustic ﬁsh density is a linear index of the true density. it is, however, assumed that the index is at least generally increasing, permitting rank or- dering of the results. fish density estimation was carried out accord- ing to two-way stratiﬁed sampling design. first, the study area deeper than 10 m, as indicated by bathymetric maps, was divided into 14 separate basins, ten of which were selected for echo-survey. the selected basins included large pelagic areas as well as narrow straits. the length of survey tran- sects in a basin was determined by the area of that marjoma¨ki et al. tiz ‰fz/az‰swaz/az‰on i‰1 (wi ` vi ` ti)/az where fz‰the ﬁshing effort of trawls in zone z, az‰ area over 10 m deep (ha) in

sounding estimates were from the middle of august. the yield (y) of vendace per unit of trawl ﬁshing effort (ypue, kg ` swept ha»1) of certain trawling unit i in august-september was used as an index of vendace biomass at the time of echo sounding. it was estimated by: ypuez,i‰yz,i/swaz,i . ypue was calculated from daily ﬁshing records of one trawling unit ﬁshing in zone b and another ﬁshing in both of the zones c and d. ypue was divided into young-of-the-year and older ﬁsh by their proportions in trawl catch samples. when comparing the ypues from different years the following facts should be noted. the width of the trawl operating in zone b was 30 m during the whole study period, but the width of the trawl in zone c and d increased gradually from 13 m in 1987 to 75 m during the study period, which may have affected the catchability per width unit of trawl. the codend mesh was also changed during the study. in 1987–1992, diamond-shape codends ,10 mm from knot to knot were used. after 1993, square mesh codends of 10–14 mm were used in order to prevent young-of-the-year vendace and other species such as smelt from being caught. the ypue of autumn seining was calculated by

ypue of vendace was ana- lyzed by relating the ﬁsh density and ypue to the average trawling intensity during the 3 previous years. three years was selected as a period of effect of ﬁshing as the pelagic ﬁsh community consists mostly of ﬁsh less than 3 years old (e.g., mar- jomäki & huolila 1994). the abundance of smelt could not be monitored successfully by ypue of trawl because of the pre- viously mentioned changes in the trawl codend. the by-catches were also poorly recorded by the seine ﬁshermen. length comparison the length of vendace after two growing seasons was used as an index of their density because the growth is strongly inversely density dependent (marjomäki & kirjasniemi 1995). it was measured in 1986 (year class 1985) and 1996 (year class 1994) in different zones. in 1986, sample average of ﬁsh two growing seasons old was estimated from seine catch samples in october. in 1996, sample averages were estimated mostly from winter seine samples. in some areas, catch samples were available only from the summer 1996 and in those cases the length after two growing seasons (l2) was back calculated from the length of age 2„ ﬁsh by mona- styrsky’s (1930) formula

back-calculation results are in this case rather insensitive to value of b as typically (s2/s).0.8. pelagic ﬁsh stocks and trawling intensity fig. 3. time series of standardized ﬁsh density estimate in four zones of lake puulavesi results trawling intensity varied considerably between the zones and years from 0 to 2.67 swept ha ` ha»1, being highest in zones c and d (table 1, fig. 2). the indices of ﬁsh density and vendace biomass declined at the beginning of the 1990s and in- creased again from 1992 to 1993 onwards in every zone (fig. 2). a signiﬁcant correlation (spearman’s rank correlation, all rsﬂ0.6, p,0.05, one-tailed) was found in annual hydroacoustic estimates of ﬁsh densities in all pairwise comparisons between zones. the trawl yield of young-of-the-year ven- dace and other ﬁshes (mostly smelt) declined to- ward the end of the study period, as intended by the ﬁshermen, due to the increase in the codend mesh size of the trawls. no signs of recruitment failure associable with trawling intensity were found as the most abun- dant vendace year-classes were detected in every zone. the high abundance of year-classes 1994 and 1996 can be interpreted from changes in acoustic ﬁsh

between 3-year mean trawling effort and ypue of over-1-year-old vendace (spearman r, all p.0.1, 1-tailed) (fig. 4) or ﬁsh density (spearman r, all p.0.1, 1-tailed) (fig. 5) at the end of each 3- year period. discussion the basic assumption that the zones can be ana- lyzed separately as they harbor isolated populations is crucial to the approach of this study. all mark-re- capture studies on vendace in finnish lakes clearly indicate that migrations between basins separated by shallow straits can be considered negligible (vil- janen 1978, valkeajärvi 1983, jurvelius et al. 1995). however, no mark-recapture study of a scale large enough to conﬁrm the isolation could be made in lake puulavesi. instead, indirect support for this assumption was gained from growth comparison between different basins. the growth of vendace dif- fered signiﬁcantly between some adjacent zones and these differences prevailed during the study period (table 3). furthermore, growth differences could be detected even between basins within a particular study zone. vendace reproduction occurs in every zone according to extensive sampling of larvae since 1987; in spring 1999, the larval densities in zone d were among the highest in the whole lake (own un- published data). thus, it is unlikely that the persist- ence of the vendace stocks of the most intensively ﬁshed zones depends on immigration from the other zones. no evidence to support the expectation that trawling induces a detrimental effect on pelagic ﬁsh stocks was detected in any of the ﬁsh density or vendace biomass indices in lake puulavesi. it is notable that trawling did not prevent the strong vendace year classes from emerging as often in the heavily exploited zone as in the control zone, de- spite the fact that trawling has been estimated to induce mortality of over 50% of escaping young- of-the-year ﬁsh in late evening and night ﬁshing (suuronen et al. 1995). in 1986–1991, most of the young-of-the-year vendace falling into the com- mercial trawls could not escape through the dense diamond mesh of the trawl codend. thus, it seems that trawl-induced mortality has not played major role in the typically high and unpredictable total mortality of young-of-the-year vendace. according to karjalainen et al. (2000), the mean instan- taneous total mortality (z) of vendace from the age of 3 weeks to their ﬁrst autumn varied between 0.94 and 3.9 in different lakes and the standard deviation typically exceeded 1. in addition, a major proportion of the young-of-the-year ven- dace population may have inhabited the peripheral areas of the basins where no trawling took place. 71 fig. 4. relationship between 3-year mean trawling effort and trawl yield per unit of effort of over 1-year-old vendace at the end of each 3-year sequence fig. 5. relationship between 3-year mean trawling effort and acoustic ﬁsh density estimate at the end of each 3-year sequence trawled zones in comparison with the no-trawling zone was detected (table 2, friedman analysis c2‰ 6.360, df‰3, p‰0.095, two-tailed, kendall coef- ﬁcient of concordance‰0.424, p,0.1). quite the opposite, the standardized density estimates were even higher in zones c and d than in zone a in 4 of 5 years, implying a greater increase in relative density there. interestingly, the interannual vari- ation in density also seemed to be highest in zones c and d. the length of ﬁsh after two growing seasons was smaller in 1996 (year class 1994) than in 1986 (year class 1985) (table 3), indicating a higher density at the end of the study period, the growth being negatively density dependent. the decrease in growth was greatest implying the greatest increase in ﬁsh density there. in zone d, also contrary to expectations, no statistically signiﬁcant negative correlations were detected in marjoma¨ki et al. long as average ﬁsh density and yield per unit of effort, the index of ﬁsh biomass, were expected to de- crease along with the increase in ﬁshing effort. the fact that this was not detected may be explained partly by the pure chance event of strong year- classes emerging during the latter part of the time series, thereby masking the effect of cropping. however, one could have expected that despite the general increase in ﬁsh density the density in the trawled zones would have decreased in relation to the control. the lack of such a decrease suggests that density-dependent compensatory processes ef- fectively counteract the population change. the re- lationship between the spawning stock and recruit- ment of vendace has been suggested to be dome- shaped in many lakes (e.g., auvinen 1978, valto- nen & marjomäki 1988, viljanen 1988). in such case, higher exploitation would lead on average to more abundant year-classes as the spawning stock remained higher than the stock producing the highest average year-class. interest- ingly, in lake puulavesi, the strong year classes were detected in every zone, independent of ﬁshing intensity, which is in accordance with the sugges- tion of marjomäki & huolila (1994) that most of the interannual variation in recruitment of lake puulavesi vendace is determined by unpredictable climatic factors. in such case, an increase in the variability of ﬁsh density may result from increased exploitation (e.g. beddington & may 1977, may et al. 1978) especially as the unpredictable recruit- ment variability accounts for an ever-increasing proportion of whole stock variability when the stock consists of ever-fewer year classes along with the increase in exploitation (e.g. buijse et al. 1994). in addition to compensation in recruitment, there are indications that natural mortality of coregon- ids may be inversely proportional to ﬁshing mor- tality and/or ﬁsh density (miller 1949, hamrin 1979), compensating for the increase in ﬁshing mortality. in addition, a negatively density-de- pendent growth rate (marjomäki & kirjasniemi 1995) and the small size of vendace at the end of the study period suggest considerable potential for compensating the effects of exploitation (e.g. hea- ley 1975). in lake puulavesi, the weight of 2-year- old vendace during the low-stock period was more than double that when stocks were highest (mar- jomäki & huolila 1994). due to the short history of commercial trawling for vendace in finland, comparable studies on its consequences are scarce. muje & lahti (1992) studied areally restricted trawling in lake south kallavesi. during the study period of 9 years, no negative consequences of trawling on vendace stock were detected. there have, however, been several studies stressing the ability of vendace to withstand 72 heavy exploitation. the most extreme example comes from lake pyhäjärvi (western finland) (helminen et al. 1992, 1993), where the annual yield of vendace has ranged from 8 to 26 kg ` ha»1 for many years despite the mean annual survival of far less than 50%, instantaneous ﬁshing mortality of about 2.7 years»1 of immature ﬁsh during some winters and instantaneous total mortality even over 5 from autumn to next (survival 0.4%), mainly due to winter seine ﬁshing. in lake puulavesi, the level of ﬁshing mortality has been much lower. mar- jomäki & huolila (1995a) estimated the catchability (q) of trawl on vendace to be about 50% of the fully recruited ﬁsh in the trawling area. derived from this, the instantaneous ﬁshing mortality by trawl (f‰q ` f) in zone d was on average 0.7 years»1 from august 1992 to 1996 and the maximum 1.3 during the season 1995–1996. auvinen (1987) compared the population struc- ture of vendace between a zone of high and low seine ﬁshing pressure in lake pyhäjärvi (eastern finland). the pattern of occurrence of strong year-classes differed from zone to zone, strong year-classes emerging more often in the heavily ﬁshed zone than in the zone of minor ﬁshing press- ure. interestingly, ﬁsh density in the heavily ex- ploited zone was higher than that in the zone of low ﬁshing pressure (jurvelius et al. 1987), which is in accordance with our ﬁnding. information on exploitation effects from other ﬁshes of large northern hemisphere lakes has re- cently been gained from intensive ﬁshing experi- ments aiming at lake restoration. in lake vesijärvi, ﬁshing mortality closely comparable to zone d of our study area induced a major decline in stocks of roach and smelt (horppila & peltonen 1994, horppila et al. 1996). in lake puulavesi, the stock of smelt could not be monitored successfully by trawl ypue, but experience from seine ﬁshery im- plies a decline in their stock. the smelt stock is likely to decrease due to trawling sooner than ven- dace because smelt reaches sexual maturity later, grows slower and therefore is a target of predation mortality for longer, its growth is not clearly den- sity-dependent (horppila et al. 1996) and the mor- tality of smelt escaping from a trawl is high due to physical injuries (suuronen et al. 1995). there are some reasons why the results from lake puulavesi must be applied with caution when developing trawling for vendace in other lakes. first, due to mosaicism of the lake and areas per- mitting trawl ﬁshing, large areas of lake have pre- sumably served as refuges for the young-of-the- year vendace. secondly, the stocks of predators of small vendace, especially perch, are sparse, sug- gesting low predatory mortality of young ﬁsh, thus permitting high ﬁshing mortality. conclusions and recommendations for vendace stock assessment in the light of present data, pelagic trawling seems to be a sound technique for vendace harvesting in that it did not induce a mortality of pre-recruit ﬁsh high enough to endanger the future productivity of the stock. however, the trawl is a highly efﬁcient and ﬂexible gear with a potential for much higher ﬁshing intensity than the present level. therefore, constant monitoring of ﬁshing effort and ﬁsh stocks during the expansion and intensiﬁcation of ﬁshing is necessary to detect the symptoms of un- desired development as early and indisputably as possible. due to the great interannual variation in recruitment masking the effects of ﬁshing, moni- toring of non-trawled areas adjacent to trawled ones is essential to achieving this goal. resumen 1. una serie temporal de 11 an˜os de estimas hidro-acu´sticas de densidades de peces y estadı´sticas pesqueras de (coregonus al- bula (l.)) de cuatro zonas de un lago ﬁnlande´s que diﬁeren en la intensidad de pesca de arrastre, fueron utilizadas para anali- zar si el arratre actu´a en detrimento de los stocks de peces pela´- gicos, especialmente sobre el reclutamiento de c. albula. 2. estimas estandarizadas de densidades de peces en zonas de arrastre no mostraron reducciones relativas a zonas no sujetas a arrastre. no aparecieron signos de fallos en el reclutamiento asociados con la intensidad del arrastre. el crecimiento de c. albula al ﬁnal del perı´odo de estudio fue menor que al principio, indicando una mayor densidad mas claramente detectable en la zona con mayor intensidad de arrastre. en ninguna zona detectamos correlaciones signiﬁcativas entre la intensidad me- dia de 3 an˜os y la produccio´n por unidad de esfuerzo de c. albula de 1 an˜o de edad o sobre la densidad de peces. conse- cuentemente, no hubo evidencia para soportar la hipo´tesis. ello puede ser debido a procesos conpensatorios denso-dependien- tes en el reclutamiento y/o en la mortalidad contra-actuando sobre los cambios inducidos en la poblacio´n por explotacio´n. acknowledgments we thank the vendace ﬁshermen of lake puulavesi for provid- ing us
