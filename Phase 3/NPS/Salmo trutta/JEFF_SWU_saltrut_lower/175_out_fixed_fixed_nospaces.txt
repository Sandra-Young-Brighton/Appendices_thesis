show substantial differences in length for a given age. for example, a sample of shortfinned eels from a small mesotrophic lake varies up to 60 cm for a given age, while a sample of longfinned eels from a high country lake varies up to 40 cm per age class (fig. 1). unfortunately, original age data for individual eels are not available to me for most of the stud- ies discussed here. to compare length-at-age, the mean length per age class is used, calculated from either regressions or graphs presented by the various authors. for the lake pounui data, a log-transformed relationship was used to describe the growth rate. length-at-age for both species from various stud- ies within new zealand (tables 1,2) are arranged in variability in eel growth rates fig. 2. location of study sites in new zcaland order of increasing latitude of the study sites (fig. 2). most studies have been carried out within the waikato catchment, which supports the largest eel fishery within new zealand (jellyman 1993). the large sample of shortfinned eels from lake elles- mere represents intensive research over many years. also given in the tables is the habitat type of the area sampled. for both species, there is considerable variability in growth rates within similar types of habitat. for example, at age 15, shortfinned eels in lowland lakes ranged from 36 cm (lake pounui) to 69 cm (lake waikare), while in pastoral streams they ranged from 20 cm (south branch) to 60 cm (doy leston drain). with the exception of pukepuke lagoon, lake pounui, the south branch, and doyleston drain, growth rates of new zealand eels have been consid- ered linear. this is partly because samples have usu- ally been collected by fyke net, with the result that smallest size classes, or individuals <25-30 cm of any age class, are under-represented or absent. for eels larger than this, slopes of the age-length rela- tionship (fig. 2) rarely cut the y-axis at lengths equivalent to that of arriving glass-eels (5.7-6.8 cm, jellyman 1977a), meaning that growth of eels <25- 109 jelly man 3 1 0 m c 0 south i and finned eels in four studies, and in the remaining three studies both species grew at the same rate. new zealand extends over 1300 km of latitude. associated climatic differences could be expected to affect the length of growing season, which could, in turn, affect growth rates. to examine the influ- ence of latitude on length of growing season, com- mercial eel catches are used as an index of species activity, as eel fishing is carried out year-round in the northern north island, and only ceases in colder southern areas when catches diminish to uneconom- ical levels. fig. 3 shows mean monthly catches (1982-1990) for 3 eel-fishing areas within new zealand-northland is the northernmost area, hawke bay is a central north island area, while southland is the southernmost area. catches show a strong cor- relation with average water temperature, indicating that cool temperatures inhibit the activity and avail- ability of eels. correlations of catch against temper- ature for the 3 areas combined are highly significant (p<o.ool), whereas correlations for hawke bay and southland, where fishing is seasonal, indicate that eel activity ceases at 6 and 5.5"c respectively. tables 1 and 2 show no obvious pattern of de- creasing growth rate with increasing latitude. to test this further, two indices of growth rate per species were plotted against latitude. the first index was the slope of the age-length regression (for lengths >30 cm), and the second was the mean length at age 1.5 for shortfinned eels and age 20 for longfinned eels, the best represented ages per species. none of the four regressions was significant (b0.05). jan feb mar apr may jun jut aug sep

best considered to describe the growth of eels >25-30 cm. a significant feature of fig. 1 is the considerable age and associated slow growth rate of these popu- lations. maximum ages recorded to date for short- finned and longfinned eels respectively are 60 and 106 years. where both species coexist, neither spe- cies grows consistently faster than the other. for ex- ample, of the 10 studies in tables 1 and 2 where both species were recorded, and defining significant differences in growth as >o. 1 cm-year-', then, short- finned eel growth rates exceed those of longfinned eels in three studies, longfinned eels exceed short- discussion several factors characterize growth of new zealand freshwater eels: i.e., for each species, both intra- and interpopulation variability in growth rates is high, and rates are usually linear and slow. linear growth is at variance with the classical growth models of fish, where growth rate declines as the asymptotic length is approached, but has also been recorded from studies of a. anguilla (sinha & jones 1967; vollestad & jonsson 1986; bar& & mason 1992) and a. rustrata (hansen & eversole 1984). jellyman (199.5) has suggested that linear growth in eels is largely a result of the not having to invest energy in annual spawning. a number of factors could influence growth rates and these are discussed as either density-indepen- dent or density-dependent factors. density-independent factors both species of new zealand eel have the poten- tial to grow rapidly. for instance, results from 110 variability in eel growth rates table 1.

cordingly, it is unlikely that new zealand eels are genetically predisposed to slow growth. because of the difficulty in determining sex in 111 jelly man table 3. biomass of eels recorded from

(harries 1974; todd 1974). the results from both studies showed that females grew at slightly faster rates than males. todd found that female shortfinned eels were 2-10 cm longer than males of equivalent age, but differences were less pro- nounced for longfinned eels. in contrast, harries found clear differences in length-at-age of long- finned eels of both sexes. faster growth of females than males has been widely reported for other spe- cies of anguilla, such as a. anguillu (vollestad & jonsson 1986) and a. rosrrutu (helfman, bozeman & brothers 1984). water temperature is known to affect foraging and feeding activity (jellyman 1991) and has been suggested as the most important factor causing hab- itat-specific growth differences in longfinned eels (chisnall & hicks 1993). commercial catch data were strongly correlated with water temperature and predicted that the activity of eels would cease at 5.5-6°c; this is similar to the results from woods (1964) and jellyman (1 991) who found that feeding of both species ceased at temperatures of 5 6 ° c . the lack of relationship between growth rate and latitude indicated that there is no simple direct rela- tionship between water temperature and growth rate. density-dependent factors new zealand eels are opportunistic scavengers, consuming a variety of aquatic and terrestrial foods, with the latter being especially important during floods (burnet 1952a; ryan 1986; jellyman 1989). for each species, diet has been shown to differ with size (cairns 1942a; burnet 1969b; jellyman 1989), with larger individuals of both species become partly piscivorous (jellyman 1989). where both species co-exist, similar-sized shortfinned and long- 112 mean ~ reference biomass (kg . ha-’) range 205-1 020 1 19-1

food availability on growth rates of new zealand eels has not been specifically studied, although most authors have assumed it to be impor- tant, either quantitatively or qualitatively. for exam- ple, fish provide a high energy diet (ryan 1982) and in a small lowland lake a change to a fish-dominated diet by longfinned eels >40 cm resulted in acceler- ated growth (author’s unpublished data). when considering whether growth was likely to be food-limited, jellyman ( 1989) concluded that “given the diet of both species is broad and flexible enough to exploit periodically available feeding op- portunities, and that eels are an energy-conservative species, it is difficult to imagine that food availabil- ity is a factor which would frequently limit growth”. this is supported by the observation of burnet (196913) that removal of eels in a small spring-fed stream did not lead to an increase in the invertebrate fauna preyed upon by eels. it seems reasonable to assume that at low eel densities, food is not nor- mally limiting, while at high densities food may be- come limiting either in absolute terms (insufficient food to achieve maximum potential growth) or in relative terms (interactions with other fish, including eels, may inhibit feeding). although both species often co-exist, especially in lowland rivers and lakes, they do have recogniz- able habitat preferences. longfinned eels are mainly a species of running waters, and penetrate well in- land to inhabit high country lakes and rivers (mc- dowall 1990). shortfinned eels are more coastal in distribution, dominating populations in lowland lakes and slow-flowing rivers, but are also capable of extensive inland penetration. several studies within new zealand have concluded that adult eels remain in the same area of stream for considerable periods (burnet 1969a; chisnall & kalish 1993). comparisons of growth between different habitats can therefore be made with some confidence that eels are resident there rather than transient. within a single catchment like the waikato river, growth rates can vary considerably between different habitats (tables 1, 2). for example, growth rates of longfinned eels in forested streams are considerably less than in pastoral streams in the same sub-catchment (chisnall & hicks 1993). the authors considered such differences were due to temperature, food production, predation, as well as the availability of pools. certainly, streams in na- tive forest have lower invertebrate biomass than pastoral streams (hanchet 1990; quinn & hickey 1990). unfortunately the number of samples within each habitat type were too few (1-10) to test for signifi- cant differences in average growth rates (slopes of age-length regressions) between habitats. however, for both species there were indications of differ- ences, with slowest growth recorded from lowland rivers, and most rapid growth from hydro lakes. eels dominate new zealand freshwater fish popu- lations. records of fish occurrence at 4453 sites throughout new zealand showed that longfinned eels were the dominant native species, being present at 44% of sites, while shortfinned eels were the third most frequently encountered native species, being present at 19% of sites (minns 1990). as well as be- ing widespread, eels frequently dominate the biom- ass of a fish community; data from hopkins (1970) show that 75-91% of the total fish biomass of a small north island stream comprised eels, while equivalent figures for a small south island stream were 83 and 91% for winter and summer respec- tively (g.j. glova, niwa, unpublished data). biomass estimates from various lotic sites, calcu- lated from progressive removal trapping (burnet 1952a, b) or quantitative electric fishing (other au- thors), are given in table 3. for lakes, castle (1972) estimated a biomass of at least 1120 kg-ha-' for a small coastal dune lake. compared with estimates from europe and north america (tesch 1977), bio- mass estimates from new zealand are extremely high. the growth rate data (tables 1,2) include two se- ries of hydro lakes: lakes karapiro and arapuni on the waikato river, and lakes matahina and ani- whenua on the rangitaiki river. in each case, the dam impounding the lower lake (karapiro and ma- tahina respectively) provides an obstacle to the sum- mer upstream migration of elvers (jellyman 1977b), with resultant reduced recruitment and density to these lakes. subsequent recruitment to the upstream lakes is very limited in the case of arapuni, and nil in the case of aniwhenua except for intermittent variability in eel growth rates small-scale stocking (chisnall 1993). for both catchments, density of eels will decrease in an up- stream direction, but growth rates increase (tables 1, 2). given the physical similarity and mode of op- eration of the lakes within each catchment, it is con- cluded that the differences in growth rates between these lakes are principally due to differences in eel density. further evidence of density-dependent growth rate comes from the increased growth rates of shortfinned eels in lake waikare that has accom- panied extensive commercial fishing between 1980 and 1987 (chisnall & hayes 1991). while the most likely mechanism for density to affect growth is via food availability, species inter- actions may also be important. longfinned eels are predators on both eel species (cairns 1942; jelly- man 1989), to the extent that chisnall & hicks (1993) noted that their removal lead to high densi- ties of small eels. these authors also considered that both interspecific and intraspecific competition may influence growth rates of eels in small streams. competition for space is also probable. thus chi- snall & hicks (1993) found that in a pastoral stream containing large individuals of both species, eels were evenly distributed throughout the stream. in contrast, in a pastoral stream dominated by large longfinned eels, smaller shortfinned eels were dis- placed to runs and riffles whereas many of these lat- ter eels would normally occur in pools. such dis- placement to non-preferred habitats can be expected to reduce growth rates. in summary, growth rates of both new zealand species are extremely variable, but slow relative to other temperate species of anguilza. although water temperature constrains the growing season, by itself it does not appear to be the primary determinant of variation in growth rates. it is assumed that at low eel density, food availability is not a factor limiting growth, but is probably limiting at high densities. given that diets of both species are broad and flexi- ble, this limitation is more likely to be expressed through interspecific interactions (predation and habitat displacement) than through an absolute shortage of food. resumen 1. las dos especies de anguilas de nueva zelanda (anguillu australis y a. dieflenbachii) son abundantes y estin amplia- mente
