lande 1993), and second genetic, with small populations supporting a high level of consanguinity and genetic drift and therefore becoming more subject to genetic diversity loss and inbreeding depression (ellstrand & elam 1993; lynch et al. 1995). fish are potentially highly impacted by fragmentation. indeed they are strictly aquatic organisms, and their relatively large size requires large spaces for population maintenance. this is of major importance for migratory species for which migration is necessary to complete their entire life cycle. therefore, many studies have been conducted to understand the impact of dams and weirs on migratory in particular amphihalin species, ﬁsh populations, investigating either individual difﬁculties clearing obstacles (ovidio & philippart 2002; croze 2005) or the results of fragmentation on populations (dunham et al. 1997; neraas & spruell 2001; morita & yamamoto 2002; ). when not focused on migratory species, other studies principally dealt with salmonid species (e.g. meldgaard et al. 2003). however, frag- mentation may also be important for non migratory species with low clearing capacities such as cypri- nids. it has been shown that entire ﬁsh communities can be affected by weirs (miranda et al. 2005; poulet 2007), and cyprinid species often make up the major part of ﬁsh communities of the middle and lower reaches of temperate rivers (winﬁeld & townsend 1991). moreover, many cyprinids may have to cover considerable distances for reproduction and feeding (mckeown 1984; northcote 1984), and one can hypothesise that such species would be sensitive to smaller obstacles than salmonids, since they are generally smaller themselves and less able to clear obstacles (bainbridge 1958; ovidio & philippart 2002). finally, cyprinids are also subject to the risk loss of genetic of population decline and local diversity (e.g. knaepkens et al. 2004). yet, few studies have investigated the impact of the fragmen- tation caused by dams and weirs on cyprinid populations. moreover, those studies commonly suf- fer from two weaknesses: ﬁrstly, most of them are limited to small-scale observations, with only one obstacle considered; secondly, the effects of obstacles are generally assessed on individual-scale processes, i.e. survival and ⁄ or migration (e.g. lucas & frear 1997; ovidio & philippart 2002). yet is the population-scale which is mainly used for ecosystem management and environmental policies. therefore, insights are needed into the fragmentation effects on populations, i.e. on processes such as persistence and dispersal. it 268 it in this study, we were interested in analysing the impact of weirs and dams on populations of chub (squalius cephalus) using a large-scale approach. chub was chosen as a model because it is a cyprinid, not necessarily migratory but able to cover distances of about 15 km to spawn (fredrich et al. 2003). by its size (commonly from 5–30 cm (keith & allardi 2001)) and its swimming ability (about twice its size per second (bainbridge 1958)), chub can be consid- ered to be representative of the cyprinids inhabiting european rivers. is also a ubiquitous species (laroche et al. 1999), very common in european rivers and therefore easy to sample, and it is not subject to manipulation such as stocking, which could interfere with natural processes (brusle´ & quignard 2001). to understand the effects of dams and weirs, we used microsatellite markers to measure population differentiation (see balloux & lugon-moulin (2002) for a review on this molecular tool) and explored how fragmentation shapes the chub population’s genetic structure in the durance river (france). the objec- tives were: (i) to test whether fragmentation induces a population’s genetic differentiation; (ii) to record the cumulative effect of multiple obstacles on the popu- lation’s genetic structure on the upstream–downstream riverine gradient; and (iii) to assess the differential barrier to the dispersion effect of dams and weirs. materials and methods study area the durance is a river in southern france, 302 km long for a drainage basin of about 14,250 km2. this study only considered the lower part of the durance delimited upstream by the reservoir of serre-ponc¸on and downstream by the conﬂuence with the rhoˆne river. indeed, the upper durance is dominated by trout (salmo_trutta) while cyprinids such as chub are very rare (bouchard et al. 1998). conversely, the lower parts are mainly inhabited by cyprinid species (e.g. alburnoides bipunctatus, barbus barbus, leu- ciscus soufﬁa, phoxinus phoxinus, squalius cepha- lus). the 219 km of interest are fragmented by thirteen artiﬁcial weirs (works creating rapid or small waterfall zones and supposed to limit mainly up- stream dispersion) and eight hydroelectric dams (works stopping the water ﬂow and supposed to limit upstream and downstream dispersion; fig. 1). note that four weirs (downstream) and two dams (up- stream) are actually beyond the sampled river segment. therefore they were not used in the statistical analyses. five main tributaries feed this segment of the durance: the bue¨ch, the ble´one, the asse, the verdon, and the coulon, from upstream to downstream. genetic isolation in chub fig. 1. durance basin and sampling site location. dots indicate the location of the 11 electroﬁshed sites; ﬂashes represent hydroelectric dams and lines represent weirs. sampling eleven sampling points were electroﬁshed from july 2008 to april 2009 (fig. 1). the sites were chosen for their potential to accommodate chubs (presence of lentic and lotic zones and vegetable shelters) and for their accessibility. each sampling site was about 500 m long and all habitats were sampled downstream to upstream until at least 29 chubs had been caught. approximately 25–50 mm2 of tissue at the inferior extremity of the caudal ﬁn were collected and stored in alcohol until laboratory analysis. individuals were released immediately at their catch site. sample extraction and genetic patterns the dna of a total of 333 chubs was extracted using the chelex protocol (estoup et al. 1996). five micro- satellite loci were then ampliﬁed by pcr, using the lcecb (larno et al. 2005), lc32, lc27, n7g5 and lc288 (vyskocilova et al. 2007) primers. these markers were chosen for their quite high allelic richness reported in the characterisation studies (eight to 14 alleles for 20–24 genotyped individuals). pcr ampliﬁcations were carried out as follows: 5 min at 94 °c; 35 cycles composed of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °c, 30 s at the annealing temperature (table 1) and 30 s at 72 °c; and 5 min of ﬁnal elongation at 72 °c. table 1. microsatellite speciﬁcities. pcr conditions: annealing temperatures with corresponding number of pcr cycles in brackets. size range: minimum and maximum sizes of observed alleles, as base pairs (bp). locus lcecb lc32 lc27 n7g5 lc288 pcr conditions size range (bp) 65 °c to 60 °c (10 c.);

(1977), and fst values, overall and between pairs of samples, were calculated from corrected genotype frequencies and restricted to visible allele sizes (ena method), using freena (chapuis & estoup 2007). the 95% conﬁdence intervals for fst values estimated by a bootstrap resampling procedure over loci are given by the software. relatedness, due to sampling of a limited number of families, or actual high level of inbreeding in the sampling sites could also lead to such an offset to hardy-weinberg equilibrium. to test whether such bias are likely in our dataset, we performed analyses developed by castric et al. (2002). mean genetic relatedness estimated with the pairwise identity coef- ﬁcient of mathieu et al. (1990) was compared for each sample with its expected distribution under the hypothesis of no relatedness obtained by random permutation of alleles in 1000 randomised popula- tions. signiﬁcancy on the whole dataset was tested by combining individual probabilities using fisher’s method (sokal & rohlf 1994). the hypothesis that heterozygote deﬁciencies are due to the presence of inbred ﬁsh in samples was tested by comparing the distribution of mlh (multilocus heterozygosity), i.e. the number of individuals heterozygous at 0, 1, 2 to 5 loci, with its expectation under random mating using a permutation test. the number of ﬁsh in each mlh interval within each sample was compared with its random distribution obtained from 1000 randomised populations in which alleles were randomly associated within individuals (castric et al. 2002). probabilities of observing fewer individuals in a given mlh interval than expected at random were then combined across the eleven samples using fisher’s method (sokal & rohlf 1994). isolation by distance, i.e. the correlation between the matrix of genetic distances expressed as fst ⁄ (1–fst), as recommended by rousset (1997) for populations along linear habitats, and a matrix of geographic distances, was tested using the mantel test followed by a permutation procedure (9999 permuta- tions) with the spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient as statistical test (mantel 1967). geographic distance between sampling sites was expressed in ﬁve ways: waterway distance in kilometres (d), number of obstacles limiting upstream dispersion (weirs and dams; ou), number of obstacles limiting both up- 270 stream and downstream dispersion (dams; od) and two connectivity indices (iu and id) calculated as iu = d + x · ou id = d + x · od. the follows: former considers weirs and dams, while the latter considers only dams. all the values of the multiplying factor x from 0 to 100 were tested and the value maximising the correlation was identiﬁed. since x was added to the waterway distance once for each obstacle, its value can be considered to be equivalent to a virtual distance added by the presence of one obstacle. the best model was then identiﬁed on the basis of the spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient values and the corresponding distance considered the best explan- atory variable. if the upstream ⁄ downstream genetic structure was then explored by performing linear regressions between mean allelic richness and distance to the most upstream site. d, ou, od, iu and id were alternatively used as distance measurements, and, as above, the best correlation was then identiﬁed on the basis of the coefﬁcient of determination (r2) values. because allelic richness could be inﬂuenced by sampling size and differential efﬁciency of genotyp- ing, hypothetical allelic richness was extrapolated for thirty-two successfully genotyped individuals by sam- pling site following the methodology of van loon et al. (2007). we also checked whether the observed trend could be explained by an inverse trend in the null allele’s richness: the observed allelic richness increased from upstream to downstream while the null allele’s richness decreased, then true allelic richness could be constant. thus, considering that less the null allele’s richness would be more or proportional linear regressions were also performed between the mean null allele’s frequency estimated with freena and the ﬁve upstream ⁄ downstream variables. finally, the same procedure was also carried out between the multilocus non-biased heterozygosity (i.e. assuming samples at the hardy-weinberg equilibrium and corrected for sampling biases (nei 1978)) estimated using genetix 4.05.2 (belkhir 1997) and d, ou, od, iu and id. relatedness and inbreeding tests, linear regressions, mantel tests and allelic richness extrapolations were performed using r 2.9.1 (r development core team 2009). to the null allele’s frequency, results cleaning the genetic dataset for each locus, some of the 333 individuals were not genotyped successfully; therefore, statistical analyses had to be done on 254–327 genotypes per locus. each locus was polymorphous, with eight to 14 alleles found on the whole dataset (table 2). 11 were private genetic isolation in chub table 2. genotyping results, heterozygosity and inbreeding coefﬁcient. ntot: number of individuals ﬁshed by sampling site;

table 5; fig. 2d). in this case, dams were equivalent to adding a distance (x) of 95 km. discussion dataset quality and potential bias from upstream to downstream, the sampling scheme our sampling strategy was to have as many samples as possible between successive obstacles but many river sections were not electroﬁshed, mainly because of difﬁcult access. therefore, the effects of certain obstacles, among which many weirs, were not assessed individually. this could have led to biased measurements of the inﬂuence of each obstacle on the genetic differentiation and the genetic structure of the durance’s chub population. however, since weirs were assumed not to be major barriers to dispersion, at least the genetic differentiation between the two sides of one weir is very improbable, although a cumulative effect of several weirs was expected. the main objective of this study was to test whether fragmentation induces a population’s genetic differentiation. analysing the effects of fragmentation ideally involves comparing fragmented and unfragmented systems or being able to disentangle the obstacles’ effects from the water- way distance effects. the durance was chosen because of its high fragmentation, but one conse- quence of this pattern is that the number of obstacles is strongly correlated with the waterway distance. indeed, dams and weirs are positioned such that the distance between two consecutive obstacles is about 10 km on average, for a maximum of 38 km. the consequence of this spatial conﬁguration is that it was not possible to assess the effects of waterway distance and the number of obstacles independently using procedures such as multiple linear regressions. for this reason, as it has been done in previous studies (coulon et al. 2004; perez-espona et al. 2008), the best explanatory variable was identiﬁed comparing pearson or spearman coefﬁcients. this statistical weakness must be kept in mind when interpreting the results. lastly, only sampling points of the durance river per se were considered in this study whereas tributaries could also be involved in the demographic and genetic dynamics of the durance genetic isolation in chub population. indeed, tributaries are known to have major inﬂuences on communities inhabiting the main stream of a drainage basin (hitt & angermeier 2006). however, carlsson et al. (1999), using microsatellite data, observed fewer exchanges between an afﬂuent and the main stream than inside the main stream itself for brown_trout populations. thus, one can suppose tributaries are ecologically differentiated and that support locally adapted populations which scarcely disperse into the main stream, and vice versa. furthermore, in the durance basin, chub populations are probably very small in the tributaries (except in the verdon), as problems catching this species tend to prove. thus, considering only the durance population is an efﬁcient way to study the genetic structure of ﬁsh populations, although it would be interesting to investigate the role played by the tributaries in future studies. the microsatellite loci the ﬁve microsatellite loci were efﬁciently ampliﬁed with on average 91% of the individuals successfully genotyped. they did not present signiﬁcant linkage disequilibrium, and the samples were possibly at hardy-weinberg equilibrium, once allelic frequencies were corrected for null alleles. moreover, with seven to 14 alleles observed per locus, they were polymor- phic enough to detect population differentiations. however, even if correction for null alleles is efﬁcient enough to no more have a signiﬁcant disequilibrium, others causes can have lead to such a deﬁcit in heterozygous. first of them is known as wahlund effect (wahlund 1928), i.e. the eventuality that what we consider to be a genetically homogeneous sample is actually two sympatric entities. such coexistence of two reproductively isolated groups of the same species, or pair of species, generally needs an ecological differentiation between those groups (tay- lor 1999). to our knowledge such coexistence of ecotypes has never been reported for chub. as noted by castric et al. (2002), relatedness and inbreeding can also be invoked. analyses performed on our original dataset (before correction for null alleles) indicate that those two biases are likely in the durance chub samples. relatedness is a sampling bias, result- ing from non random spatial the families. for chubs, and ﬁsh in general, this can occur, in particular concerning juveniles which swim in cohesive groups after hatching (castric et al. 2002). consequently, it could be advised to preferentially sample big individuals when searching to characterize genetic of ﬁsh populations. inversely, inbreeding is a structural feature of the populations. non random mating biased toward preference for related mates could be due to reproduction site ﬁdelity. added with the fact that some loci appeared to be highly affected repartition of 273 dehais et al. by null alleles and one by reading uncertainties due to stuttering, results of the analyses have to be consid- ered with care. the population’s genetic structure chubs belong to a genetic differentiation of the populations estimation of the overall fst value, considering all the samples, revealed a low level of differentiation. even if fst values are difﬁcult to interpret, it is often accepted that values lower than 0.05 indicate little genetic differentiation (balloux & lugon-moulin 2002). in this study, a fst value of 0.015 signiﬁ- cantly different from zero seems to indicate that the durance single population, although this population is not genetically homoge- nous. fact that structure (pritchard et al. 2000) failed to distinguish any genetically differentiated groups in the dataset (analyses not shown) combined with low frequency of private alleles tend to conﬁrm this conclusion. the same holds true for the fst values between pairs of samples: with a maximum fst value of 0.055 and 37% of these values signiﬁcantly different from zero, we can conclude that differentiation occurs, but that sampling sites cannot be considered independent populations stricto sensu. isolation by distance the fst values show that differentiation does not occur randomly: signiﬁcant isolation by distance was observed among the samples. because we sampled only in the main channel of the durance river, our sampling sites are lined up and the system functions in accordance with the stepping-stone model (kimura 1953). according to kimura & weiss (1964), the genetic distance between samples (i.e. fst values) increases as geographical distance increases. they even predicted that in the one-dimensional case the genetic correlation should fall off exponentially with distance. qualitatively, this means that even if the genetic correlation between two adjacent populations is quite high, the genetic correlation between two distant populations can be low. our observations are in accordance with this predicted pattern, with adjacent samples not signiﬁcantly differentiated but differenti- ation appearing as the distance increased. upstream–downstream structure the variation in genetic diversity along the upstream– downstream gradient is another parameter potentially inﬂuenced by damming. we observed that allelic richness and heterozygosity increased from upstream to downstream. these two variables are somewhat redundant. however, if allelic richness is an eloquent descriptor of genetic diversity, it suffers from a high 274 sensitivity to sampling bias; obviously, with only about 30 individuals at each sampling site, all the alleles of each were probably not caught, and the presence of a rare allele in a sample is not meaningful, detected mostly by chance. furthermore, the presence of null alleles biases the estimation of allelic richness. the variation in heterozygosity on the upstream– downstream riverine gradient is therefore a useful complementary parameter. indeed, we used multilocus non-biased heterozygosity (nei 1978), which was developed to compensate for the small sample sizes. two hypotheses can explain such an increase in genetic diversity along the riverine gradient, also observed by raeymaekers et al. (2008) on three- the population size may spined stickleback. first, increase from upstream to downstream. indeed, the frequency of heterozygotes is assumed to be correlated to the population size (wright 1931 1937, in robert- son 1962; frankham 1996; ). in the case of the chub population of the durance river, this hypothesis is very likely: (i) the upper part of the durance section studied is characterised by a narrower channel than the lower one, and ﬁsh population sizes are often corre- lated to the amount of available habitat (frankham 1996; hanﬂing et al. 2002); (ii) the ﬁsh community of the durance shifts gradually from cyprinid to salmonid dominance (bouchard et al. 1998), which indicates that the upper parts of the river are suboptimal for cyprinids such as chubs and that a range-edge effect (arnaud-haond et al. 2006) can occur; and (iii) it was to catch enough chubs in the most more difﬁcult upstream sites. the second hypothesis is that the asymmetrical dispersion between the sampling points, due to the river ﬂow and the obstacles, implies that downstream samples received more new alleles com- ing from upstream than the contrary. thus, this process maintains a high genetic diversity downstream by dispersion, while genetic drift is less compensated in upstream sampling sites (see lacy (1987) for the relative effects of genetic drift and immigration on the genetic diversity of small populations). combining these different observations, it can be supposed that the chub population of the durance is organised as a metapopulation, i.e. is composed of local populations exchanging individuals by immigration ⁄ emigration processes (levins 1970; hanski & gilpin 1991). local populations are lined up in the river following the stepping-stone model. since overall genetic dif- ferentiation is low, dispersion is likely not null or has recently been limited. however, differentiation occurs gradually along the riverine gradient: close local populations are genetically similar, but distant ones are signiﬁcantly differentiated. moreover, asymmetric dispersion seems to cause upstream local populations to supply downstream local populations in individuals and genetic material, while being smaller. effects of fragmentation waterway distance, dams and ⁄ or weirs it was explained above that distinguishing the respec- tive effects of waterway distance and obstacles (dams and weirs) was statistically difﬁcult. however, this study provides some insights into the role fragmenta- tion plays in the genetic structure of ﬁsh populations. we observed that considering the number of dams separating two sampling sites combined with distance was more effective for predicting the genetic structure of chub populations than waterway distance alone. few studies investigated the effects of both distance and fragmentation. meldgaard et al. (2003) observed isolation by weirs but no isolation by distance in european grayling (salmonidae: thymallus_thymallus) populations. they explained this result by the salmo- nids’ ability to disperse widely. considering that cyprinids have weaker swimming capacities (bain- bridge 1958), shorter distance can probably induce detectable genetic differentiation among cyprinid populations, even if larval and juvenile drift can also lead to dispersal among populations. one of the laroche et al.’s (1999) observations tends to corrob- orate this idea that short distances can induce genetic differentiation in cyprinids : they observed a weak isolation by distance trend among close chub popula- tions (maximum distance of 100 km) of a river basin less impacted by fragmentation than the durance basin. however comparisons with our results are difﬁcult, ﬁrst because of methodological differences (allozymes versus microsatellites) and then because they considered populations inhabiting different trib- utaries, potentially enhancing genetic differentiation (carlsson et al. 1999). moreover, they did not observe any isolation by distance effect in chubs in two other sub-basins, nor on the other cyprinid species (roach, rutilus rutilus) they studied. without fragmentation, isolation by distance among cyprinid populations of a single river may be lower, and it can be supposed that, for the durance chub population, waterway distance alone would not have led to the isolation by distance observed. laroche et al. (1999) also observed that a single dam can cause a slight decrease in polymor- phism (chub and roach) and heterozygosity (chub). the results reported herein, by considering the cumu- lative effect of multiple obstacles, conﬁrm their observation. in our analyses, dams were identiﬁed as an explanatory variable but not weirs. considering already quoted potential biases, no clear conclusion can be drawn from this result. supposing the validity of our analyses, it would mean that genetic differen- tiation is greater with dispersion limited on both sides: weirs, which are supposed to prevent only downstream to upstream movements, seem to be insufﬁcient obstacles to induce detectable genetic consequences. genetic isolation in chub however, this does not mean that weirs have no inﬂuence on populations. it has been proved that small obstacles (about 20 cm high) can prevent upstream movements for small species such as bullhead (cottus gobio) (utzinger et al. 1998), and that barbel (barbus barbus) individuals are stopped or slowed in their upstream dispersion by a 40 cm high weir (lucas & frear 1997). such limitations undoubtedly have con- sequences on the dispersion rate from downstream populations to upstream ones, and even if we did not detect it statistically, weirs probably participate in the asymmetry of the dispersion and thus in the observed decrease in heterozygosity from upstream to down- stream. quantiﬁcation of the dam effect obstacles, and in particular dams, seem to participate in the shaping of the genetic structure of ﬁsh populations in a watercourse. we did not assess the respective explanatory power of dams and waterway distance, but the way our connectivity indices (iu and id) were calculated could provides some information. considering the regression between non-biased het- erozygosity and id, we observed that each dam adds a virtual distance of 95 km. this distance was 34 km in the mantel test of isolation by distance. with regard to the home range and the migration ability of chubs, respectively estimated around a few hectometres and 15 km (fredrich et al. 2003), these values are quite high. dams have the effect of biologically distancing populations, which is precisely the original deﬁnition of fragmentation in a terrestrial landscape. with regard to the geographic distance between two successive sampling sites ranging from 6.8 to 44.1 km, this value is also high. mathematically this means that in the construction of the index id, optimised to predict heterozygosity variation, dams play a greater role than waterway distance. conclusion this study suffers from multiple potential biases: no sampling between all the obstacles, nor directly upstream and downstream of each, no possibility of comparison of fragmented and unfragmented seg- ments, and disequilibrium in regard of the hardy– weinberg model which can have at three nonexcluding causes. among them two do not rely on actual biological processes: null-alleles, due to genotyping difﬁculties, and relatedness, likely due to non efﬁcient sampling strategy. consequently, conclu- sions about the durance chub population are difﬁcult, and results reported therein only allow hypotheses. fragmentation by dams seems to participate in ﬁsh population isolation and differentiation. preventing movements, totally from downstream to upstream, and least 275 dehais et al. partially from upstream to downstream, dams would enhance the natural isolation by distance effect and the asymmetry of the dispersal ﬂows. consequently, populations, and especially the most upstream, would have very low immigration rates and are more subject to genetic impoverishment. finally, even if this study brings few proven insights about the genetic and ecological characteristics of the durance chub popu- lation, one can pull out from it methodological guidance. sampling a long river segment is certainly a more efﬁcient way to assess ﬁsh dispersal behaviour than only consider one obstacle, and use a connectivity index such as the one developed in this study allow to assess cumulative and differential effects of multiples kinds of obstacles. however, in order to improve the power of the analyses, one should take care to sample nonrelated individuals by avoiding sample of grouped juveniles. and an optimal sampling scheme would imply sampling directly upstream and downstream of all the obstacles. acknowledgements we would like to thank sophie dubois for her help in the laboratory work, and the hydrobiology team of the cemagref for
