habitat use; diet shift; morphological constraints j. p. barriga, quintral 1250, (8400) san carlos de bariloche, rı´o negro, argentina; e-mail: barriga@ crub.uncoma.edu.ar accepted for publication february 7, 2009 introduction during ontogeny, body size increases and new func- tional systems are acquired continuously in order to reach adequate performance levels for survival (osse 1990). mainly, early life stages of indirect deve- lopment undergo very complex processes of morpho- genesis and differentiation (balon 1984). the challenges that ﬁsh larvae must face are numerous and especially arduous due to their relatively small size, which on many occasions constrains their ability to avoid predators, capture preys and withstand starvation. in this context, changes in ontogenetic states often coincide with niche shifts (balon 1990, 1999). therefore, the comprehension of these chang- ing relationships between organism and environment is crucial not only for ecological knowledge of a species, but also for its future conservation. the saltatory ontogeny theory (balon 1999) considers development as a sequence of stabilised states separated by rapid changes. these fast changes have been conﬁrmed at morphological, anatomical and growth level (osse 1990; osse & van den boogart 1995; loy et al. 2001), and have been related to behavioural habitat (simonovic´ et al. 1999; barriga et al. 2002) and diet (balon 1984) shifts. transition from one period or phase (sensu balon 1975) to the next one has usually been detected employing relative growth analyses (gisbert 1999; kova´cˇ et al. 1999; simonovic´ et al. 1999). allometric growth changes have been more frequently detected at larvae–juvenile transition (coop (gisbert & ruban 2003), doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00356.x 395 barriga & battini than at et al. 1999) transition, as juveniles have already acquired the deﬁnitive pheno- type. juvenile–adult the native ichthyofauna of patagonia is very scarce (baigu´ n & fe´rriz 2003); however, basic traits of several species are nowadays still unknown. particu- larly, in relation to siluriform ﬁshes, little is known about their life cycles and early ontogeny (ludberg et al. 2004). hatcheria macraei (girard 1855) is a rheophilic and negatively phototactic catﬁsh (menni 2004) inhabits fast ﬂowing, clear, cold and well-oxygenated waters (ringuelet et al. 1967). an important size-related habitat shift has been reported for this species (arratia & menu-marque 1981), which makes h. macraei a good subject to evaluate whether this shift is related to ontogenetic periods. that the relationship among life-history traits, such as reproductive characters, is other important point to consider in order to understand how a given species maximises its ﬁtness in a particular habitat (matthews 1998). the trichomycteridae life-history strategies seem to be very variable, from precocial type in troglobitic catﬁshes (trajano 1997, 2001) to altricial forms in other trychomicterus of brazil (casatti 2003). small changes in life traits can trigger great changes in ﬁtness (hutchings 1997) and also alterna- tive life histories (e.g., salmonidae ﬁshes, klemetsen et al. 2003). consequently, the generation of basic population data in h. macraei is the ﬁrst step towards a general species understanding. the from patagonia, the focus of this study was on a h. macraei southernmost population distribution for trychomicteridae species (arratia & menu-marque 1981). the main goals of this work were: (i) to estimate the ontogenetical periods by means of relative growth, morphogenesis changes and gonad examination, (ii) to establish both the habitat and diet preferences during the development and (iii) to relate these niche shifts to morphological and functional constraints. materials and methods study area hatcheria macraei individuals were collected from the caleufu´ river in the northern patagonian steppe. this river is originated by the conﬂuence of meliquina and filo-hua-hum rivers, and empties its water into the piedra del a´ guila reservoir on the limay river (atlantic basin). the caleufu´ annual mean discharge )1, with a wide ﬂuctuation in the is 64.5 ± 49.7 m3æs )1 in february to 173 m3æs )1 in year from 4 m3æs october (aepn (anuario estadı´stico de la provincia del neuque´n) 2003). the sampling stations on the caleufu´ river were located in the steppe, where the 396 climate is arid (200 mm rainfall per year), approxi- mately 4 km upstream from the (at 40°20¢10¢¢s, 70°45¢12¢¢w; 595 m.a.s.l.). the riparian vegetation consists mainly of shrubs such as discaria chacaye (g. don) and berberis buxifolia lam. and the grass cortaderia araucana stapf. reservoir fish collection and habitat preference fish were captured by means of a 24 v dc backpack electroﬁshing unit, model 12-b (smith-root, inc., vancouver, wa, usa), and always in upstream direction. in the marginal areas of the rifﬂes, where water was the shallowest, ﬁsh were found hidden beneath rocks and then caught using a hand net (1 mm mesh size). captured ﬁsh were sacriﬁced in a carbon dioxide-saturated water solution and stored in 4% formaldehyde. fourteen sampling sessions were conducted from september 2002 to august 2003, and were performed at least every 3 weeks from november to april, and at least once every 6 weeks for the rest of the year. to evaluate habitat preferences, data were grouped rifﬂes and into three habitat categories: pools, marginal rifﬂes. pool areas were characterised as having slow and deep water (from 30 to 70 cm deep), with a smooth-surface appearance and patches of aquatic macrophytes, mainly myriophyllum sp., on silty bottom. this habitat was not considered in the analysis because a single individual was caught. rifﬂe areas were distinguished by fast and shallow water (from 10 to 40 cm deep), with a broken-surface appearance and a rocky bottom substrate characterised by cobbles (64–256 mm) and boulders (>256 mm). marginal rifﬂe areas were present during the drought season and were characterised by having the shallow- est water (<10 cm depth) at the edge of the river with nearly still water with the same rifﬂe bottom substrate. conductivity was registered by means of a multi- range portable conductivity meter, hi 8733 (hanna instruments buenos aires, argentina) )1), and water temperature (±1 °c) was (±0.1 lsæcm measured using a tes 1302 digital thermometer (tes electrical electronic corp., taipei, taiwan). average water velocity was recorded with a digital ﬂowmeter with back-run stop, model 438 115 (hydro-bios, kiel, germany) in the rifﬂe areas where ﬁsh were caught. inc., life periods assessment three approaches were applied to estimate the size range of each ontogenetic period: by means of relative growth, morphogenesis and gonadal examination. all captured ﬁsh (n = 117) were photographed in dorsal, ventral and left lateral views, and 26 body measurements were recorded (fig. 1) using an image ecological signiﬁcances of ontogenetic shifts in hatcheria macraei each ﬁsh was examined under stereomicroscope, model wild m3c (leica ag corp., heerbrugg, switzerland), to verify the morphogenesis and differ- entiation status (the formation, transformation or loss of different external body structures) in relation to the size. the presence ⁄ absence of the following structures was recorded: dorsal and ventral median ﬁnfold, splitted into anterior (from anterior to dorsal or anal ﬁns) and posterior (from dorsal or anal ﬁns to caudal ﬁn) sections, anlagen of hypural bones, pterigiophores and rays of each ﬁn, anlagen of ventral ﬁn and caudal ﬁn shape (from rounded to truncated) as well as pigmentation. the presence of a stomach was recorded after dissection. a binary logistic regression model was used (norusis 1986) to establish at what size these ontogenetical shifts occur. in this model, the depen- dent variable takes binary values, presence or absence (1 and 0, respectively) of each structure and the independent variable is the sl. y ¼ ½eðcxþþd½1 þ eðcxþþd 1; where y represents values between 0 and 1, x is the sl, and c and d are the parameters estimated by the model. the point where y = 0.5 represents the tran- sition size for a speciﬁc body structure. when the transition was recorded in individuals of consecutive size we calculated the mean point between their respective sizes. sex and gonad condition (gc) of ﬁsh without any external larval structure, bigger than 30 mm sl, were recorded on the basis of macroscopic examination of the gonads. the gc was staged according to the criteria of marraro et al. (2005) and chapman et al. (2006) simplifying ﬁve or seven states into two categories: 0 for virgin or maturing virgin individuals, and 1 for developing, developed, mature or gravid, spawning and spent individuals. as in the morpho- genesis analysis, the juvenile–adult size transition was estimated using a binary logistic regression model based on gc. due to the small number of individuals captured (female = 34, male = 41), this analysis was carried out using individual ls–gc data rather than the classical approach that uses percentages of size ranges. to estimate the spawning season, the gonado- somatic index for h. macraei was calculated as )1. both gsi = 100 · gonad mass · (total body mass) gonad and total body (tm) masses were recorded with an electronic balance (±0.002 g; ohaus corp., florham park, ny, usa). diet analysis the stomach, or the ﬁrst portion of the gut in larvae, of each specimen from the caleufu´ river was dissected for food contents under a examination of its 397 fig. 1. measurements used in hatcheria macraei morphometric analysis. standard length (sl), head length (hl), head width (hw), interorbital distance (iod), eye diameter (ed), mouth width (mw), prepectoral length (ppd), predorsal length (pdd), preanal length (pal), preventral length (pvl), pectoral–ventral distance (pvd), ventral–anal distance (vad), pectoral ﬁn length (pfl), ventral ﬁn length (vfl), dorsal ﬁn length (dfl), anal ﬁn length (afl), dorsal base ﬁn length (dbfl), anal base ﬁn length (abfl), caudal peduncle depth (cpd), body width in pectoral ﬁn (bwp), body width in ventral ﬁn (bwv), body width in anal ﬁn (bwa), body depth in pectoral ﬁn (bdp), body depth in dorsal ﬁn (bdd), body depth in ventral ﬁn (bdv) and body depth in anal ﬁn (bda). analysis software, image-pro plusò, version 4.0 for windows (silver spring, maryland, usa). relative growth (sensu fuiman & higgs 1997) of h. macraei was calculated as a power function (fuiman 1983) of standard length (sl) using nontransformed data: y = axb, where y is the independent variable (each measurement other than ls), x the dependent variable (ls), a the intercept and b the relative growth coefﬁcient. when proportions between measurements remain constant (isometric relative growth) b = 1, and when proportions change (allometric relative growth) b „ 1, resulting positive or negative when it is greater or minor than 1, respectively. thresholds in the life history of ﬁshes (e.g., larvae– juvenile transition) have commonly been estimated by means of inﬂexion points (ips) in relative growth analysis (see kova´cˇ et al. 1999; simonovic´ et al. 1999). with this aim, linear regressions were performed on log-transformed data using the sl as the indepen- dent variable. inﬂexion points growth curves were determined according to van snik et al. (1997) and gisbert (1999) and relative growth coefﬁcients were compared statistically by means of the t-test (zar 1999). barriga & battini stereomicroscope ﬁtted with an ocular micrometer. empty guts (15%) were registered but not considered into the diet analysis. recently eaten preys (appeared undigested) were identiﬁed up to the minor taxa as was possible following ferna´ndez & domı´nguez (2001). prey width was measured in the broadest rigid part of each consumed prey excluding all appendages; e.g., on the thorax in ephemeroptera nymphs or on the cephalic capsule in chironomidae larvae. also prey volume was estimated by means of volumetric displacement of water (for big preys, ±0.001 ml) or estimated according to botrell et al. (1976) using different body lengths. to describe diet we calculated the frequency of occurrence (%fi), percentage by number (%ni) and percentage by volume (%vi) as, %fi = 100 ni ⁄ nt, where ni is the number of ﬁsh containing prey category i in the stomach, and nt is the total number of ﬁsh containing food in the stomach. %ni = 100 ni ⁄ nt, where ni is the total number of items of prey category i, and nt is the total number of items of all prey categories. %vi = 100 vi ⁄ vt, where vi is the total volume of items of prey category i, and vt is the total volume of items of all prey categories. p next, we estimated the index of relative impor- tance (pinkas et al. 1971) as, irii = (%ni + %vi) · %fi. this index was then expressed in percentage as, %irii = (irii ⁄ irii) · 100. diet overlaps were

macraei (n = 117) was from 9 to 127.4 mm sl. all individuals could be grouped into larval, juvenile and adult periods according to their relative growth, anatomical changes and gonadal development.

the growth changed to isometric (b  1) or negative allometric (b < 1). the ventral–anal distance was the only mea- surement that showed negative to positive change in the relative growth. the six remaining characters without ip presented a relative growth close to the isometry with the exception of the mouth width that showed a negative allometric relative growth (b = 0.666). all the ips were

no dark pigmentation on the body. an early develop- ment of the sensory system was also registered, all individuals had barbels and dark pigmented eyes. the anlagen of caudal ﬁn rays were the ﬁrst to be detected (9.4 mm sl) on the median ﬁnfold, then dorsal and anal ﬁn pterigiophores (10.4 mm sl), dorsal and anal ﬁn rays (a.c.11.2 mm sl), the pelvic ﬁn primordium (12.9 mm sl) and ﬁnally the pelvic ﬁn rays (20.3 mm sl). the absence of ﬁnfold was registered in individ- uals equal or larger than 29.4 mm sl as well as the presence of a pouch-like stomach. based on the morphological changes registered in h. macraei, larvae–juvenile transition was calculated at 25.9 mm sl, being the mean value between the larger individ- ual captured with larval structures (22.4 mm sl) and the smaller one with a juvenile phenotype or without any larval structures (29.4 mm sl). individuals larger than 25.9 mm sl were considered as juveniles (table 2). the transition between immature and mature

(2005) reported by marraro larvae presence dates. this period overlaps in part with data for trichomycterus corduvensis, by habit et al. (2005) for t. areolatus and also with data reported by trajano (1997) for trichomycterus itacarambiensis, a troglob- itic catﬁsh. in general, ﬁshes inhabiting high latitudes show seasonal patterns of reproduction related with changes in temperature and hours of daylight (wootton 1998). in this sense, the spawning season in h. macraei showed to be related to rising temperatures but not with water velocity (fig. 5). in contrast, reproduction of some trychomicterus populations at low latitudes (<5°) has been related to rainy seasons (roman-valencia 2001; chara´ et al. 2006). however, in another low-latitude trichomycterus populations (casatti 2003; chara´ et al. 2006), the presence of mature individuals throughout the year has also been reported as an alternative and more opportunistic reproductive style (casatti 2003). in the life-history model (balon 1999), the change from one ontogenetic period to the next one entails morphogenesis; growth or differentiation generating new functional system ⁄ s. acquisition of new functions produces a change in the organism–environmental interaction that ultimately can generate a niche shift. a clear spatial segregation was found in h. macraei depending on the ontogenetic period of life. all larvae were captured in the shallow marginal rifﬂes where the maximum depth registered was 10 cm, water velocity was almost zero and a rocky bottom substrate was found, while juveniles and adults were caught in deeper rifﬂes. this pattern could be associated to the swimming constrains because the ﬁns are still in development in the larval period. the ecological outcome is to reduce the predation risk by the exclusion of a wide size range of ﬁsh predators, like trout and the creole perch, percichthys trucha, of the shallow waters. microhabitat preferences related to the ontogenetic period have been reported by arratia & menu-marque (1981). also ontogenetic shift in bottom composition preference has been found in trichomycterus and t. areolatus (arratia 1983; manriquez et al. 1988) in chilean rivers, where the juveniles prefer soft bottom while adults live in gravel bottom. (arratia 1983) chiltoni there is scant information about the diet of h. macraei, as other trichomicteridae (habit et al. 2005; chara´ et al. 2006; scott et al. 2007), this species demonstrated to be a benthic feeder preying mostly on insect larval stages. the main prey of h. macraei was chironomidae larvae during all the ontogeny. but larvae, juveniles and adults preyed upon different, and incrementing, size classes of this prey. furthermore, ephemeroptera nymphs were incorporated since the juvenile period. an increment of tic was registered from larvae to adults. during the adult period, the ecological signiﬁcances of ontogenetic shifts in hatcheria macraei presence of a native ﬁsh, g. maculatus, was registered in the stomach contents. this is consistent with the migration of g. maculatus at larva–juvenile transi- tion registered from february to early april in the caleufu´ river (barriga et al. 2007). the change of both the relative importance of some preys and size classes represents an ontogenetical shift in the diet of h. macraei. an abrupt prey size increment from larvae to juveniles was registered, as well as the presence of small ephemeroptera nymphs in the juveniles’ stomachs that could have been eaten by larvae (see fig. 6). this is more probably due to the habitat shift detected at larvae–juvenile transition than a constraint because of mouth size. in addition, greater diet overlap between juveniles and adults individuals also indicates that prey electivity could be driven mainly by microhabitat use. adaptations to a benthic life style can be inferred from h. macraei morphology. this elongated ﬁsh has a ﬂattened head with small dorsal eyes and three pairs of barbels. its mouth is subterminal, moderately wide and has a prognathous upper lip (arratia & menu- marque 1981; see fig. 1). probably, the negative allometric growth of mouth width found in this species (b = 0.666) could be related to its benthic feeding behaviour and the small size of the main preys consumed during all ontogeny. the optimal foraging theory predicts that optimal prey size is approximately 0.6 times the ﬁsh’s mouth (gill 2003). prey size eaten by h. macraei till 60 mm sl adjusts to this theory, but beyond this length, prey size did not show any increment (fig. 6). this fact can be simply explained as a consequence of prey availability in the habitat, or indirectly as a result of predation forces on catﬁsh that restrict its microhabitat use. despite this, no differences in weight–length relationship during the ontogeny indicates no detrimental condition due to a suboptimal feeding. the most critical in conclusion, the results of this work suggest that changes during the ontogeny of morphological h. macraei have important ecological consequences, that mainly in the larva–juvenile transition. at moment, functions, crucial for surviving, such as feeding, swimming and respiration (osse & van den boogart 1995; gisbert 1999) are still developing. marginal rifﬂe areas seem to be the nursery habitat where early stages of h. macraei have low probability of being predated due to the exclusion of predators from these shallow areas. future works on population size and density are needed to evaluate the conservation status of this and other populations of h. macraei. moreover, as very little is known about the effect of introduced trouts in lotic environments (pascual et al. 2007; aigo et al. 2008), catﬁsh popu- lation data will improve our understanding about native–exotic ﬁsh interactions to develop management and conservation strategies of the patagonian native fauna. acknowledgements we thank two anonymous reviewers whose valuable comments improved the manuscript. this work was partially funded by agencia nacional de promocio´n cientı´ﬁca y tecnolo´gica, argentina (pict 175 grant) and consejo nacional de investigaciones cientı´ﬁcas y te´cnicas, argentina (conicet). references aepn (anuario estadı´stico de la provincia del neuque´n) 2003. datos geogra´ﬁcos climatologı´a e informacio´n general de la provincia del neuque´n. neuque´n, argentina: ministerio de hacienda, finanzas y energı´a. 404 pp. aigo, j., cussac, v.e., peris, s., ortubay, s.g., go´mez, s.e., lo´ pez, h., gross, m., barriga, j.p. & battini, m.a. 2008. distribution of introduced and native ﬁsh in patagonia (argentina): patterns and changes in ﬁsh assemblages. reviews in fish biology and fisheries 18: 387–408. arratia, g. 1983. preferencias de habitat de peces siluriformes de aguas continentales de chile (fam. diplomystidae y trichomycteridae). studies on neotropical fauna and envi- ronment 18: 217–237. arratia, g. & menu-marque, s. 1981. revision of the freshwater catﬁshes of the genus hatcheria (siluriformes, trichomycteridae) with commentaries on ecology and biogeography. zoologischer anzeiger 207: 88–111. baigu´ n, c. & fe´rriz, r. 2003. distribution patterns of native freshwaters ﬁshes in patagonia (argentina). organisms, diversity & evolution 3: 151–159. balon, e.k. 1975. terminology of intervals in ﬁsh develop- ment. journal of the fisheries research board of canada 32: 1663–1670. balon, e.k. 1984. reﬂections on some decisive events in the early life of ﬁshes. transactions of the american fisheries society 113: 178–185. balon, e.k. 1990. epigenesis of an epigeneticist: the develop- ment of some alternative concepts on the early ontogeny and evolution of ﬁshes. guelph ichthyology reviews 1: 1–48. balon, e.k. 1999. alternative ways to become a juvenile or a deﬁnitive phenotype (and on some persisting linguistic offenses). environmental biology of fishes 56: 17–380. barriga, j.p., battini, m.a., macchi, p., milano, d. & cussac, v.e. 2002. spatial and temporal distribution of landlocked galaxias maculatus and galaxias platei (pisces, galaxiidae) in a lake in the south american andes. new zealand journal of marine and freshwater research 36: 345–359. barriga, j.p., battini, m.a. & cussac, v.e. 2007. annual dynamics variation of a landlocked galaxias maculatus (jenyns 1842) population in a northern patagonian river: occurrence of journal of applied ichthyology 23: 128–135. juvenile upstream migration. botrell, h., duncan, a., gliwicz, m., grygierek, e., herzig, a., hillbright–ilokowska, a., kurasawa, h., larsson, p. & weglenska, t. 1976. a review of the same problem in zooplankton production studies. norwegian journal of zoology 24: 419–456. 403 barriga & battini casatti, l. 2003. biology of a catﬁsh, trichomycterus sp.
