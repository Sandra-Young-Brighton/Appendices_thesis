otolith; larval dispersal; sicydiinae; lesser antilles introduction gobioidei, and especially species of the sicydiinae subfamily, are the largest contributors to the diversity of fish communities in tropical insular systems and have the highest level of endemism in these particular habitats (radtke & kinzie 1996; keith & lord 2011). all the known species of this subfamily exhi- bit an amphidromous life cycle (keith et al. 2011). the adults grow, feed and spawn in freshwater. the newly hatched larvae drift downstream and quickly reach the marine environment where they spend 2–6 months while undergoing their larval develop- ment (iida et al. 2008; lord et al. 2010; taillebois et al. 2012). at the end of this marine larval phase, the postlarvae move back to the river mouth while they come across a metamorphosis (taillebois et al. 2011). soon after entering the river, the juveniles swim upstream and settle in the upper reaches. despite the great contribution of amphidromous species to the diversity of fish communities on tropi- cal islands, the details of their biological cycle remain poorly known (lord & keith 2006). tropical island ecosystems are naturally unstable and ephemeral and have become even more so in recent years as result of human alteration (smith et al. 2003). moreover, recruiting postlarvae is a declining fishery resource in many areas, as caribbean region (bell 1999). correspondence: lea lejeune, ecole normale superieure de cachan;

lecomte-finiger 1999) during the entire fish’s life and do not undergo any mineral resorption (mugiya & uchimura 1989). they are made of successive discrete layers of arago- nite crystalline microstructure growth increments that are deposited on a protein matrix (campana 1999). the daily periodicity of these increments was vali- dated at larval stage on several fish species (pannella 1971), including sicydiinae (yamasaki et al. 2007; taillebois et al. 2012). in the case of amphidromous species, metamorphosis is materialised by a check- mark, appearing when the postlarvae recruit to the rivers (shen & tzeng 2002). the increment count from the core to the metamorphosis checkmark is therefore an estimation of the marine pelagic larval duration (pld). investigations on pld are of particu- lar interest because they provide insights on the dis- tribution ranges and the dispersal processes that occur in sicydiinae as illustrated by recent studies (lord et al. 2010; taillebois et al. 2012). the relationship between the otolith growth rate and the individual growth rate in some amphidrom- ous species has been used to study the relative growth rates during the larval stage (shen & tzeng 2008; lord et al. 2010). because the individual growth depends on intrinsic factors such as the age and the size of the fish and on external components such as food supply, water salinity and temperature (boeuf & payan 2001), studying the growth pat- terns can provide information on the environmental conditions which occurred in the life stages of the fish. this study focuses on the species sicydium puncta- tum perugia, 1896, distributed in the caribbean fresh- waters, living in sympatry with sicydium plumieri (bloch, 1786). within the sicydium genus, species are distributed in west africa from congo to gabon and on both sides of the panama isthmus (keith et al. 2011). juveniles of the genus sicydium are harvested in the estuaries of caribbean rivers when they recruit and constitute fry fisheries in this region (fievet & le guennec 1998; bell 1999). recruitment is pansea- sonal in this species and age- and size-at-recruitment vary seasonally (bell et al. 1995). the amphidrom- ous species are dominant in fauna biomass in carib- bean hydrosystems (covich & mcdowell 1996) and recruited postlarvae provide an important source of food for many fish species in estuaries (hostache 1992). despite its ecological, economical and cultural larval traits of a caribbean amphidromous goby values, only few conservation measures have been developed to protect sicydium punctatum at local and global scales. the lack of management measures is probably due to the lack of knowledge of s. puncta- tum life history traits. although few studies have explored larval recruitment of s. punctatum in domi- nica (bell & brown 1995; bell et al. 1995; bell 2009) and confirmed the amphidromy of the species (tabouret et al. 2011), it is the first time larval traits are explored in individuals from guadeloupe. we aim to provide a better understanding of the charac- teristics of the marine dispersal phase as well as the recruitment of s. punctatum. to achieve this aim, we estimated the pld and examined the size-at-recruit- ment and the growth rate patterns during the marine phase of one cohort of recruiting postlarvae in guadeloupe, using the otolith microstructure. material and methods sampling and biometry the postlarvae were sampled with traditional woven funnel traps at the mouth of the capesterre river on basse-terre island in guadeloupe on 2 november 2011 (fig. 1). fish were kept in 95% ethanol. among these fish, 96 individuals were randomly sampled for the study. eighty-three individuals were used after barcoding (see details in the result section). the standard length (sl) and total length (tl) of each postlarva were measured using a digital mitu- toyo dial calliper (mitutoyo, aurora, illinois, usa) with 0.01 mm accuracy. according to the spear- man’s test, the tl and sl were positively signifi- cantly correlated (q = 0.882; p < 0.001, n = 83); therefore, we used the tl as an indicator of the size- at-recruitment for the statistical analyses. barcoding sicydium punctatum is the most common fish species in guadeloupe rivers. however, postlarvae belonging to other species such as s. plumieri may have recruited at the same time. because the morphologic differences between close species at the postlarval stage are not easily picked up, we performed genetic barcoding analyses to definitely identify our samples. total genomic dna was extracted from fin clips with the robot eppendorf epmotion 5075 and the nucleospinâ96 tissue kit (macherey-nagel) follow- ing the manufacturer’s instructions. a 680 length fragment of the mitochondrial dna cytochrome oxydase i (coi) gene was amplified for each of the individuals according to the method described in taillebois et al.

(wilcoxon’s paired test for otoliths growth rate we measured the distance between points located on a straight line each five daily increments using photo- shop 10.0.1 (fig. 2). the otolith average daily growth rate (lmday  1) on this 5-days time interval was then calculated. the value was normalised to the longest radius length in order to avoid the bias due to sample preparation and to enable comparisons between otoliths. larval traits of a caribbean amphidromous goby fig. 2. otolith of sicydium punctatum. for otolith growth analysis, the distance between each 5 daily increment is measured along the otolith’s longest radius (n, nucleus; di, daily increment; and e, edge of the sagitta). statistical analysis the data were statistically processed using r v2.8 (r development core team, 2008, http://www.r-project. org/). the normality of the data was systematically checked using shapiro’s test. we used the wilcoxon’s test for paired series to test whether the pld estimated by the two counters were significantly different. a spearman’s test was used to test the relationship between the pld and the size-at-recruitment, as the size-at-recruitment was not normally distributed (shapiro–wilk’s test, tl: w = 0.959, p = 0.027, n = 67). the correlation between the size-at-recruit- ment and the length of the longest radius was tested by a spearman’s test too. a pearson’s test as well as a linear regression were used for testing the correlation between the pld and the otolith average growth rate, as both variables were normally distributed (growth rate: w = 0.981, p > 0.1 n = 60; pld: w = 0.971, p > 0.1, n = 60). to test the relationship between hatching period and growth rate, we used a mann– whitney u-test with a false discovery rate control. for every 5-days step, we tested the difference in the mean otolith growth rates between individuals born in two different hatching periods: august and september. results species identification of the 96 samples, 90 were successfully sequenced for the coi gene and 667-bp length fragments were obtained for each of the 90 individuals. no evidence for pseudo-gene amplification was found (no ambigu- ous alignment, low sequence quality, double peaks or stop codons). the distribution of pairwise genetic dis- tances showed three nonoverlapping modes. the first one grouped p-distances between 0% and 2%. the second one grouped p-distances between 8.2% and 10.9%. the third one grouped p-distances between 2.8% and 3.7%, which corresponded to the distance between one sequence and the others. this sequence was excluded from further analysis, as we suspected it was an artefact. the two other groups corresponded to intraspecific and interspecific p-distances. the phenetic tree highlighted two major groups supported by bootstrap’s values of 93% and 100%. these groups were identified thanks to reference sequences as the species s. punctatum and s. plumi- eri. the whole data set was thus composed of 83 postlarvae s. punctatum. pelagic larval duration no obvious checkmark was found in the otoliths, as the postlarvae were newly recruited, but a decrease in the increment width was observed at the otolith edge, indicating a change in the environmental conditions and/or the physiological condition of the fish. we assumed it was the evidence of the transition between salt and fresh waters. we were able to count the growth increments on 67 otoliths of s. punctatum, as the others were too damaged. the average (sd) pld of s. punctatum postlarvae was 72.1  10.4 days with a range of 54–101.5 days. the coefficient of variation (cv) was 0.15. considering the sampling date (2 november 2011), when postlarvae arrived at the river’s mouth and the pld, we back-calculated the hatching period. hatching of these individuals occurred from 23 july 2011 to 9 september 2011. one individual was born in july (<1%), 50 were born in august (75%) and 16 in september (24%). size-at-recruitment all the 83 postlarve of s. punctatum were measured. the average (sd) size-at-recruitment of postlarvae 275 lejeune et al. was 24.5  1.3 mm, with a range of 20.5–28.1 mm. the coefficient of variation was 0.05. pld and size- at-recruitment were correlated (spearman’s correlation test: q =  0.116, p > 0.1). significantly not otolith growth rate the otolith growth rate was performed on 60 individ- uals of s. punctatum for which the pld and size-at- recruitment were estimated and measured, as the pic- tures of seven individuals’ otolith did not allow to estimate the growth rate. to know whether the otolith growth is a good proxy of the postlarvae growth, we tested the correlation between the size-at-recruitment of postlarvae and the length of the longest radius using the nonparametric spearman’s test. the test showed a significant positive correlation (q = 0.642, p < 0.001, n = 60). therefore, we assumed that the otolith growth rate from the nucleus to the edge could be a good proxy of the larval growth for s. puncta- tum individuals. the growth rate changes during larval stage had the same pattern in both the individuals born in septem- ber and in august (fig. 4). four stages can be the linear results of the regression (fig. 3, r2 = 0.7536, p < 0.001) and the pearson’s test (t =  13.173; p < 0.001) showed that there was a strong negative relationship between the pld and the daily growth rate of the otoliths. the oldest individu- als at recruitment had a low average daily growth rate. indeed, the postlarvae born in september had an average growth rate significantly higher than those test: w = 599; born p < 0.001). (wilcoxon’s in august fig. 3. mean otolith growth rate (lmday) of sicydium punctatum postlarvae depending on their pld. the curve is fitted by: y =  0.04936x + 7.95894. r2 = 0.7536, p < 0.001. n = 60. 276 distinguished on the growth rate curves: a fast growth rate stage during the first days of the marine larval phase was followed with a decreased growth rate between the fifth and the tenth days. then, the growth rate rose between the tenth and the twentieth days. finally, the growth rate progressively decreased dur- ing the remaining of the marine larval phase to reach around 2 lmday  1. the growth rate was higher for individuals born in september during the first 5 days, from the 20th to 25th day and from the 45th to 50th day (fig. 4). no significant difference in the growth rate between august and september was observed during the other periods of the marine larval phase. discussion in these two localities, pelagic larval duration the average pld found for s. punctatum from gua- deloupe (average  sd: 72.16  10.5 days, with a range of 54–101.5 days) was slightly lower than what was reported by bell et al. (1995) in dominica (average  se: 83.4  1.3 days, with a range of 54–132 days). although it seems average plds are slightly different there are large variations of the pld of s. punctatum in domi- nica (54–132 days), partly due to the periodic sea- sonal variability (bell et al. 1995). looking more closely to the data, bell et al. (1995) found plds of around 75 days for recruits of october, which is con- sistent with the timing of our sampling and with the pld we found in the present study. the pld of s. punctatum bracketed within the range observed in endemic closely related amphidromous gobies (lord et al. 2010). in sicydiinae, pld is not a good proxy to explain the distribution range of species (taillebois et al. 2012) even if it may play a role in the ability to colonise rivers at the individual scale. in the carib- bean region, only short distances separate the poten- tial habitats of sicydiinae. given this short distance and the length of the larval phase in s. punctatum, individuals should be able to reach a suitable habitat. other parameters of a physiological, ecological and physical nature may influence the dispersal ability and thus the recruitment of postlarvae (bradbury & snelgrove 2001; radtke et al. 2001). larval growth rate variation of the larval growth rate during the larval development just after hatching, the larvae of sicydiinae species have only few days to reach the sea (bell & brown 1995; valade et al. 2009) where they undergo all the transformations allowing them to survive in salt water. the arrival in salt water triggers these morphological larval traits of a caribbean amphidromous goby september, with individuals born in september grow- ing significantly faster than those born in august at the beginning of the larval phase. studies showed that reproduction and recruitment in amphidromous gobies in the tropical regions generally occur all year round (bell et al. 1995; keith 2003). our sampling was limited in time, and all year round sampling should give us more details on the spawning–hatch- ing periods. bell et al. (1995) showed that s. puncta- tum growth rates exhibit seasonal variations with a peak of highest growth rates for larvae hatched in midsummer (month of july) and of lowest growth rates for larvae hatched in late december. seasonal variations were also found in sicyopterus japonicus in taiwan (shen & tzeng 2008). these two studies suggest that growth rates may be related to hatching periods as found in our study. the pelagic larval environment (e.g., water temperature, food availabil- ity and oceanographic features) was shown to influ- ence the rates of larval growth (otterlei et al. 1999; keller & klein-macphee 2000) in a variety of marine fish. more recently, teichert (2013) has brought a correlation between sea surface temperature and pela- gic larval traits to light. food availability does not seem to explain the growth disparities we found, as there is no clear difference between the chlorophyll concentration near the coast in west indies in august and september 2011 (nasa earth observations, http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/). variations observed could also be due to individual differences, as found in amphidromous gobies in japan (iguchi & mizuno 1990). fig. 4. mean

lind- strom 1998), and within 48 h, the yolk sac is absorbed and the mouth opens (ellien et al. 2011). the yolk supplies are totally consumed after an average of 4 days after hatching in sicydiinae (valade et al. 2009; ellien et al. 2011). this would explain why the growth rate is high (5.9 lmday  1 for the otoliths) during the early life stages of the larvae while they are still able to feed off the yolk sac. after that period, the daily growth rate decreases of up to 2.6 lmday  1 as major physiological and morphological transforma- tions occur (depeche & billard 1994). when these transformations that require a great amount of energy happen, the larvae allegedly feed off plankton, which may not be as energetic as the yolk sac reserves. this would explain the global decrease in the larvae’s growth rate. similar patterns of globally decreasing growth rates during the marine larval phase have been described in other sicydiinae species (lord et al. 2010; teichert 2013). this trend lasted until the larvae reached the river mouth. based on stable isotope analyses, sorensen & hobson (2005) suggested that larvae of amphidromous species in hawaii derived much of their nutrition from inshore environment influenced by freshwater. one would expect an increase in the growth rate at the end of the marine lar- val stage due to rich inshore feeding ground. how- ever, the morphological transformations occurring during their metamorphosis. this would explain why the daily growth rate does not to shore despite the large amount of nutrients available in this environment. coincides with the beginning of it increase close variation of the larval growth pattern in relation to the hatching period the hatching period of sampled individu- als occurred from mid-july to the beginning of the modalities of recruitment nonsignificant correlation between age and size-at- recruitment of s. punctatum was also found in other amphidromous gobies (hoareau et al. 2007; shen & 277 lejeune et al. results have already the recruitment tzeng 2008; lord et al. 2010). the coefficient of variation of the size-at-recruitment (0.05) is more than twice lower than the coefficient of variation of the pld (0.15), suggesting that is more likely to be size dependent rather than age dependent. similar been observed in other sicydiinae species (radtke et al. 2001; shen & tzeng 2008). in other groups of fish, the variation in size-at-recruitment might have impor- tant consequences for postsettlement survival (see the study on the reef fish by vigliola & meekan (2002)). study (mean  sd: the pld data of 72.2  10.5 days) and tabouret (mean  sd: 62.6  10.4 days) for s. punctatum from gua- deloupe highlight a high variability among individu- als. some of them experience larval durations twice as long as the observed minimum. because postlar- vae recruitment is likely to be size dependent, the variations of growth rate between the individuals would explain the variations of plds between the same individuals. a longer pld would allow an indi- vidual with a lower larval growth rate to reach the required size for recruitment. the large range of plds observed has been shown to be due to the post- larvae waiting near shore for a signal of recruitment in coral reef fish (cowen & sponaugle 1997). this (2010) optimal conditions for recruitment can be predict- able (seasonal for instance) or random. in sicydiinae species, lunar phases and seasons seem to affect the timing of recruitment (bell et al. 1995; iida et al. 2008; bell 2009; teichert et al. 2012). in amphidr- omous gobies where dispersal occurs through pelagic larvae, a greater variability of plds increases the likelihood of finding streams (maeda et al. 2007). it has been shown in reef fish that potential of a longer larval life enables a delay in metamorphosis (victor 1986; wellington & victor 1989, 1992). theoreti- cally, individuals able to adjust their development in adequacy with the conditions (a larva having a low growth rate tends to stay in the ocean longer than the faster growing ones) have more successful recruit- ment than others. many invertebrates are able to extend their larval life after reaching a competent size in the absence of recruitment cues and suitable settle- ment conditions (jackson & strathmann 1981). in teleost, such abilities have been suggested in reef fish species (victor 1986; mccormick 1999; searcy & sponaugle 2000). conclusion our study of the larval life of sicydium punctatum is consistent with our general understanding of amp- hidromous larval traits. the larval growth rate of the studied species was described for the first time and revealed variations between individuals that may be 278 (tabouret in relation with the environment of the larvae. these observed variations in the pelagic larval traits such as the variation in growth rates in relation to hatching date, the variation in the pelagic larval duration (pld) and size-at-recruitment might reflect life his- tory variation among larvae. even if s. punctatum is recognised to be an amphidromous species based on otolith microchemistry analyses et al. 2011), whether the larvae stay near shore or disperse further offshore still remains unknown and would potentially affect the populations’ connectivity and persistence. a near shore habitat would promote the colonisation of the rivers of birth, limiting dispersal and gene flow and would support the ‘passive dis- persal’ hypothesis whereas an offshore habitat would ensure more dispersal and gene flow and support the ‘nonpassive dispersal’ hypothesis (hogan et al. 2014; huey et al. 2014). the link between the differences in larval traits and larvae habitats (i.e., near shore or offshore) must be tested using genetic tools (to explore the connectivity between populations of dif- ferent catchments) and otolith microchemistry (to find elemental and isotopic signatures of habitats) and might offer a path forward in our understanding of amphidromous larval life. because s. punctatum postlarvae are a fishery resource in the caribbean region and a key species for the caribbean hydrosys- tems, information on the larval life will be essential to set up relevant and efficient tools for the manage- ment of their populations. acknowledgements we are grateful to the museum national d’histoire nature- lle of paris (mnhn,
