the others received plankton with river water. pikeperch did not eat the fishfood properly, and poorer condition of the smallest fish fed artificially was reflected in a lower amount of lipid in the whole fish at the beginning of the experiment in november. the autumnal diet played an important role in determining the wintering success even when the effect of size was removed. in contrast, feeding during the experiment did not affect survival. however, feeding fishes had more lipid at the end of the experiment in april than starved ones and their protein content also increased during the winter. key words: mortality;

the amount of food was at first reduced by half, and thereafter only as many chironomids as had been eaten were added to the aquaria every other day. because there were always some worms left un- eaten, the fish were assumed to be feeding to ex- cess. to see whether the smallest pikeperch fry could also survive winter, 240 of the smallest pikeperch were selected by eye from among the fishes that had been maintained on an artificial diet. they were placed in 20 aquaria, and fish in ten randomly selected aquaria were given food as described table 1. average, minimum and maximum monthly water temperature (+sd) during the experiment mean "c %sd minimum maximum november 1993 december january 1994 february march april 0.70 1.1 1.2 1.1 1.3 2.4 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.9 0.5 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.9 1.5 0.9 1.4 1.6 1.3 1.8 4.7 156 earlier. in order to maintain the same temperature in all aquaria, they were placed in two 4-m2 tanks through which water was constantly run from river rutajoki. the water temperature was meas- ured daily before 0900 (table 1). half the water in the aquaria was changed every second week. dead fish were removed daily from aquaria. before freezing their length and wet weight was measured. fish samples for determi- nation of lipid, protein and glycogen content were taken on december 12, 1993 and january 19, march 23, and at the end of the experiment on april 27, 1994. the fish were selected randomly from experimental aquaria on each occasion. a sample to identify possible diseases was taken on december 18, 1993. biochemical assays protein, lipid and glycogen contents were deter- mined from freeze-dried fish. length and wet weight of fish were measured before freezing in li- quid nitrogen. frozen fishes were stored at -70°c and freeze-dried for 24-48 h depending on fish size. freeze-dried fishes were then weighed and ground. the glycogen content of liver and dorsal muscle were determined from freshly killed fish. glycogen determination glycogen determination was according to the method of siu et al. (1970). liver, dorsal muscle and 15-20 mg of freeze-dried fish were extracted at 100°c for 20 min with 0.5 ml of 30% koh satu- rated with na2s04. after cooling, 1 ml of 96% ethanol was added and the samples were incubated at 0°c for 30 min. then samples were centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min) after which the glycogen pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of h20. an appropriate amount of glycogen solution (0.1 ml of liver, 0.5 ml of freeze-dried fish and 0.5- 1 ml of dorsal muscle extract) was taken and made up to 1 ml with h20. one ml of liquid phenol and 5 ml of h2s04 were then added and the samples were cooled for 10 min before incubating at 25°c for 20 min. absorbance was measured at a wave- length of 490 nm (siu et al. 1970). lipids and proteins the method of mayer & walther (1988) was used to determine the lipid and protein content of fish. for lipids a sample (25-20 mg) of freeze-dried fish was mixed with 0.3 ml of h 2 0 and 1.7 ml of con- centrated sulfuric acid. the tubes were closed with cotton wool, extracted at 100°c for 20 min and cooled to room temperature. well-shaken extract (0.2 ml) was mixed with 2.3 ml of vanillin reagent. after a reaction time of exactly 30 min, the absorb- ance was measured at a wavelength of 546 nm (mayer & walther 1988). for protein determination a sample of freeze- dried fish was homogenized in water. the homo- genate was made up to 9 ml with distilled water. fifty pl of homogenate, 500 pl of h20 and 1 ml of protein reagent were mixed and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. after cooling to room tempera- ture, absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 562 nm (mayer & walther 1988). statistics logistic regression analysis (logit) was used to examine the differences in mortality rates. differ- ences between pairwise regression coefficients were tested by t-test. the effect of fish size on mortality was examined by dividing the fish into 2 mm length groups. the chi-square test was then used to com- pare the effects of size as well as feeding on mor- tality. the effect of length on mortality was eliminated to compare different pre-experiment conditions (natural or artificial diet). fish in the two groups were divided into 2-mm length classes. the number of observations in each length class was equalized by taking as many random samples as possible within each length group. as a result there were two groups of fishes from different pre-experimen- tal conditions with similar length distributions. differences in mortality between these were com- pared with the chi-square test. differences between mean glycogen, lipid and protein contents of different groups and sampling dates were tested by analysis of variance (anova) (ho: all means not significantly different). fisher's least significant difference test was used as post- hoc test. natural logarithm conversion was used to reduce differences in variance. results mortality the mortality of pikeperch, which were fed nat- urally in the autumn, was 19% when the fishes were starved throughout the winter and 9% when they were offered food (fig. 1). considerably higher mortality occurred among artificially fed pike- perch, of which 81% had died by the end of the experiment regardless of whether they were fed or starved during the winter. therefore autumnal diet affected the mortality rate of pikeperch (logit, p<o.ol starved and p<0.05 fed), but feeding dur- ing the winter did not correlate with survival in either of the two groups. winter mortality of pikeperch o o i ' 8 0 6 0 40 2 0 0 4 6 4 7 4 8 4 9 5 0 5 1 5 2 1 2 3 4 5 6

aquaria) that died had fungus infections, mainly on their fins. neither bacterial nor parasitic diseases were detected. a significant correlation between feeding group (naturally or artificially fed fish) and survival was recorded even when the effect of size was elimin- ated (chi-square, p<o.ol). within the group of 157 kirjasniemi & valtonen naturally fed pikeperches, survival was positively correlated with length chi-square, p<o.ool). how- ever, there was no evidence of clear threshold size for survival, neither among naturally nor artifici- ally fed pikeperch. even small (47 to 49 mm long) pikeperch could survive the winter, but among fish >60 mm mortality was minimal (fig. 2). glycogen, lipid and protein content liver glycogen stores decreased between november and january when fishes were starved (anova, p<0.05; fig. 3). in january and march feeding fishes of both groups (naturally and artificially fed prior to the experiment) had more glycogen in the liver than starved ones (anova and fisher's test, p<o.ool). dorsal muscle glycogen content de- creased (anova, p<o.ol) between november and march in every group except naturally fed, feeding fish (fig. 3). later in the experiment a re- duction could also be seen in this group (anova, p<o.ool). the influence of feeding on glycogen content of pikeperch was evident when the determination was made from whole fish (fig.

p<o.ool). however, starving did not influence the glycogen content of entire fish. the concentration of glycogen was as high in april as in november (13 mg g-' dw) and it did not fluctuate during the winter. in november and january the amount of lipid in the whole fish was higher in the naturally fed pikeperch rather than in artificially fed pikeperch prior to the experiment (anova and fisher's test, p<o.ol; fig. 4). from march onwards the lipid content of fasting fishes decreased (anova, p<o.ool) while no significant change was observed among the feeding ones. at the end of the experi- ment fasting pikeperch contained less lipids than at the beginning of the experiment (anova and fisher's test, p<0.05). feeding in winter had a positive effect on the protein content (fig. 4). naturally fed, feeding pi- keperches had more protein in april than in no- vember (anova, p<o.ool), and also the amount of protein in artificially fed feeding fishes increased significantly (anova, p<o.01). no change in the protein content of starving pikeperches was ob- served during the winter. discussion survival of young-of-the-year pikeperch was ob- served to depend on fish size and diet quality (arti- ficial vs natural) preceding the experiment. in gen- eral, smaller fish have not only lower absolute en- ergy reserves but also a relatively higher metabolic demand than larger ones (paloheimo & dickie 1966). thus, the smaller the fish, the greater the probability of dying during the winter. in winter, feeding activity of fish is reduced because of the reduced water temperature, and even if food is abundant metabolic demands cannot always be met (pevca jlavescens, shuter & post 1990). al- though, at least in yoy yellow perch (post & ev- ans 1989), colorado squawfish (ptychocheilus lu- cius) (thompson et al. 1991) and roach (kirjasnie- mi & valtonen, unpublished) feeding in winter affected survival markedly, it was not the case in this study with pikeperch. however, the quality of food in autumn was of key importance. only 20% of plankton-fed pikeperches died during the win- ter, whereas 80% of those fed on artificial fish food were not able to survive during the winter. the poorer condition of these fishes is shown by the reduced level of lipids. thus, wintering success of yoy pikeperch seems to be relatively dependent on energy reserves even when they have the oppor- tunity to feed. though feeding did not have a significant effect on winter survival of yoy pikeperches, it affected the amount of energy stored by the fishes. not only did feeding fishes have more lipids, proteins and glycogen than starving ones in april, but also their glycogen and protein contents increased dur- ing the winter. no net energy loss by feeding fish during the winter (post & evans 1989, shuter & post 1990) could be detected in this experiment. the decline in the lipid reserves of starving fish between march and the end of april may be re- lated to the beginning of the growing season, when fishes are known to mobilize lipid reserves (hoch- achka & somero 1971). there was a reduction in the amount of glycogen in the liver of starving fish between november and january. decreasing water winter mortality of pikeperch temperature may be one of the stressing factors. these are known to cause hyperglycemia in fish (love 1980). in winter, elevated blood serum glu- cose levels have been observed in roach (valtonen et al. 1983), brook_trout (salvelinusfontinalis) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) (cunjak 1988). the rise in blood glucose is produced by the mobilization of liver and tissue glycogen reserves (cunjak 1988). although the winter mortality of yoy pike- perches was size-dependent, a clear minimum size limit, which, for example, for yoy roach is about 40 mm in sweden (svardson 1976), was not de- tected in this experiment. because survival clearly correlates with fish length, we suggest as a reason- able policy to stock juveniles >60 mm long. fur- thermore, if stocking is to be successful, the con- ditions under which juveniles are exposed to in lak- es in the autumn must offer adequate plankton food, which, of course, cannot be controlled. 1. durante el invierno de 1993-1994, realizamos experimentos de laboratorio para determinar el kxito de supervivencia inver- nal en juveniles de stizostedion lucioperca. entre septiembre y
