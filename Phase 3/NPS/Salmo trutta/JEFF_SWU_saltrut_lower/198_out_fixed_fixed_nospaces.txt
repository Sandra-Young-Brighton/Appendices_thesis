these range from sufficient surface area for the eggs to be laid on (lindstrom 1988; bisazza et al. 1989; c6te & hunte 1989) to the presence of nest cover (kynard 1978; sargent & gebler 1980; sargent 1982). but since males compete for territories, high-quality males may obtain the preferred territories and thus greater reproductive success. in support of this, noltie & keenleyside (1987) found that, in rock bass (arnbloplites rupestris), male size and nest size were positively correlated and that high-quality males seemed to occupy preferred territories. male characteristics can therefore be as important as nest site characteristics. goto (1987) found that, in 150 river sculpin (cottus hangiongensis), larger males mated with more females than smaller ones. others have reported similar female preferences for large mates, suggesting that male size is a good predictor of reproductive success for fish species in which males care for their offspring (downhow- er & brown 1980; thompson 1986; bisazza & marconato 1988) other male traits can also influence reproductive success. males harbouring debilitating parasites may have reduced stamina and physical condition (lemly & esch 1984; poulin 1993). parasitism could influence male reproductive success in three different ways: 1) parasitized males may be unable to acquire quality nest sites, 2) parasitized males may be less attractive to females and 3) parasitized males may be unable to provide adequate parental care to their eggs. any or all of these can influence the number of matings a reproductively active male receives and/or the proportion of its brood that will hatch. we investigated which male or nest character- istic(s) could account for variability in egg num- bers per nest in the upland bully, gobiomorphus breviceps stoke11 (eleotridae), a benthic freshwater fish native to new zealand (mcdowall 1990). breeding in riverine populations usually occurs during the southern hemisphere spring and sum- mer (mcdowall 1990). mature male bullies estab- lish territories and defend them against conspe- cifics. once a territory is established, the males court and entice females to lay their eggs at a nest site, commonly the underside of a rock. the eggs are laid in a single layer with different clutches ad- jacent to each other. the guarding males generally stay with the eggs until they hatch, typically 3-5 weeks later (mcdowall 1990). we included parasite load as a male character- istic in our study because upland bullies commonly harbor metacercarial cysts of the digenean trema- tode telogaster opisthorchis (hewitt & hine 1972; mcdowall 1990). in a previous study (poulin 1993), upland bullies infected with this parasite ex- hibited decreased anti-predator responses as para- site load increased. parasite load was also nega- tively correlated with the physical condition of the fish in the heavily infected population of the linn burn stream, one of our study sites. methods field data were collected from two small streams (shag trib and linn burn) within the otago prov- ince (south island, new zealand). both were simi- lar in physical and catchment characteristics (hamilton & poulin 1995). collections occurred during novembeddecember 1992, when the ma- jority of reproductively active upland bullies were spawning. to minimize temporal variance in nest establishment, data at both sites were collected within days of each other during the 1992 season. data collections were repeated at the linn burn site at similar times during the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons, giving us a total of four data sets (table 1). however sampling effort varied slightly among data sets. nest rock sites in both streams were located by hand lifting all the rocks that pro- vided space underneath for nesting. once a nest site had been identified, the guarding male was captured, individually bagged and transported back to the laboratory where its total length was measured. the males were then killed by lethal doses of the anesthetic 2-phenoxy ethanol. they were dissected and the numbers of t. opisthorchis cysts harbored by each male were recorded. eggs from the nests were scraped off the nest rock, pre- served in 70y0 alcohol and returned to the labora- tory for counting. while all male characteristics were measured each time, the number of guarding males captured during the 1992 season were low. these male reproductive success in the upland bully characteristic data were included to show the re- lationship between male size and nest rock size and the differences in parasite load between streams. of the nest site characteristics, only egg numbers, nest depth and the volume of the nest rock were measured during all four data collections. nest rock volume was measured by placing the rock in a graduated container and determining the amount of water it displaced. flat rocks predomi- nated; measurements of a few rocks showed that rock volume correlated with surface area (r=0.8, n=7, p=0.03). for instance, volumes of 3-5 liters corresponded to an egg-laying surface area of 250- 350 cm2. distance from nest rock to shore was available for the 1992 season. finally, current vel- ocity at the nest site was only recorded at the shag trib site. it was measured using an ott meter set at 0.6 of the depth of the river as suggested by gordon et al. (1992). all nest rocks were replaced in their original positions subsequent to data col- lection. after testing for normality using kolmogorov- smirnov tests, all variables needed log transform- ations. the relationships between male and nest characteristics and number of eggs per nest were assessed using multiple regressions computed with statview se 6800 (feldman et al. 1988). results male upland bullies exhibited wide variation in spawning success, some males received 15-20 clutches (average linn burn’s female clutch size is about 240 eggs, stott & poulin 1996) (fig. 1). dur- ing the breeding season male density averaged 0.4 males/m2 and 0.5 males/m2 for the shag trib and linn burn sites respectively;

sargent 1982; sargent & gebler 1980; bisazza et al. 1989). however, in this study (with one excep- 152 tion), such relationships were not obvious, with neither territorial characteristics nor male quality being significantly correlated with male repro- ductive success. the one significant result, a posi- tive correlation between male size and spawning success in the linn burn during the 1993 season, could have easily resulted from chance alone. another finding that is contrary to several studies on other fish (thompson 1986; lindstrom 1992) and observations in the field on upland bul- lies (staples 1975) was the absence of a relationship between male size and the volume of the nest rock. it may have been that nest competition was not intense due to low densities of nesting males in both of our riverine populations, which were al- most a tenth of the densities reported by staples (1975) at his lake study site. however, such reason- ing is speculative, as what constitutes a high den- sity in this population is unknown at present. the lack of observed relationships between any of the variables tested and the number of eggs per nest may be explained in several ways. small sample sizes may have reduced the power of our analyses. also it may be that upland bullies display a similar lack of obvious female choice between males or nests as the male lumpfish (cyclupterus lumpus l.) described by goulet & green (1988). similarly, we were unable to accurately measure male courting behavior in the field and it is poss- ible that this and other nest site or male character- istics important to reproductive success were over- looked. the reproductive life history of the upland bully, where females are capable of spawning several times per season (w. hamilton, personal obser- vation), may have also influenced the relationships between reproductive success and the variables tested. as this study entailed removing the nesting males, the more successful males were unable to complete a breeding season. then at best, we only observed a snap-shot of the possible reproductive success of the males. thus, the data we collected may be a poor indication of the real reproductive success and some of the variables tested may have an effect on the total number of eggs per male per season or even per lifetime. for instance, parasites can affect male parental care and egg survival (stott & poulin 1996), a factor not addressed here. many of the studies that have found a link be- tween male reproductive success and territorial and/or male characteristics have been conducted in water bodies that are less dynamic than those studied here. during 1993 and 1994, both of the study streams experienced several unusually severe flooding events that altered the physical character- istics of the streams and may have caused losses or gains in the amount of nesting habitat available between years. previous to 1992 the shag trib site had almost dried out during recent summer droughts, while following the 1994 floods, water levels in both streams were greatly reduced by droughts. such a dynamic and unpredictable system could result in a masking of the factors involved in repro- ductive success. it could induce the bullies to adopt an all-or-nothing approach to reproduction due to the reduced possibility of a future reproductive season, such an approach is seen in other fish in similar conditions (lachance & fitzgerald 1992; fitzgerald & lachance 1993). whatever the rea- son, a more intense study covering the whole re- productive season of these fish populations may re- veal what actually regulates the reproductive suc- cess of the males. it is also possible that such observed relationships between territory, male characteristic and reproductive success may only occur in highly stable systems. resumen 1. en numerosas especies de peces con cuidado parental por parte del macho, el nido y/o las caracteristicas del macho son determinantes en el exito reproductor del macho. durante tres aiios, en dos zonas distintas, estudiamos 10s factores que pue- reproductive success in the upland bully den producir variaciones en el exito reproductor de 10s machos de gobiomorphus breviceps, una especie de agua duke de nueva zelanda. 2. el exito reproductor vario en las dos zonas de estudio, per0 no fuimos capaces de detectar 10s factores generadores de esta variacion. incluso, en contra de lo observado en estudios pre- vios sobre esta y otras especies, no encontramos ninguna rela- cion entre el tamaiio de 10s machos y el de la piedra de nidifica- cion. 3. sugerimos que estos resultados pueden deberse a 10s siguien- tes factores: 1) reducida competencia por el habitat de nidifi- cacion debido a las bajas densidades de machos nidificantes; 2) la naturaleza d i n h i c a de las zonas estudiadas que inducen a 10s peces a mostrar una estrategia reproductora “todo-contra- nada”; y 3) el mktodo de muestreo utilizado que no permitio calcular el exito reproductor futuro de 10s machos. acknowledgments we thank c. hamilton, c. hart, a. redmayne, d. simmonds and c. willis for technical assistance in the field and in the laboratory. this research was supported by grants from the university of otago. references bisazza, a. & marconato, a. 1988. female mate choice, male- male competition and parental care in the river bullhead, cottus gobio l.
