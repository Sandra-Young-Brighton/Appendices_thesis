intraspeciﬁc competition; selectivity; shadow competition; spatial scale introduction according to optimal foraging theory, if resource delivery rate declines, optimal foragers should incor- porate new, suboptimal prey into their diets (stephens & krebs 1986). thus, if there is no phenotypic variation in prey preferences, expanded individual diet breadth is predicted under increased intraspeciﬁc competition (robinson & wilson 1998). such a widening of the diet breadth can to some extent counteract the reduced resource delivery rate. however, for a given ration, deviations in diet composition from optimal prey types and ⁄ or sizes will come at an energetic cost that negatively inﬂuences growth rates (wankowski & thorpe 1979). thus, increased competition and associated reduction in prey delivery rate can inﬂuence both the quantity and the quality of the food ingested and both these may inﬂuence individual growth rates. among freshwater ﬁsh, stream-living salmonids are among those best studied in terms of effects of competition on growth rates. in particular, the concept is that of density-dependent growth has received much interest for these species. the general pattern appearing from these studies, which usually estimate population density and growth rate or size-at-age at spatially or temporally replicated sites, the level of intraspeciﬁc competition is tightly linked with popula- tion density (i.e. spatial proximity among neighbouring individuals) and is negatively correlated with growth rates (e.g. crisp 1993; jenkins et al. 1999; keeley 2001; nordwall et al. 2001; imre et al. 2005; lobon- cervia 2005; einum et al. 2006, 2008, in press). the mechanism behind this relationship has been debated (i.e. exploitative vs. interference competition, imre et al. 2005; ward et al. 2007); however, it seems likely that exploitative competition for prey drifting with the water currents plays a role (imre et al. 2009). this is also supported by behavioural observations, demon- strating the negative effects of the presence of upstream individuals on prey consumption rates (i.e. shadow competition, elliott 2002). yet, it is not known what the dietary responses of individuals experiencing low prey correspondence: sigurd einum, department of biology, centre for conservation biology, norwegian university of science & technology, no-7491 trondheim, norway. e-mail: sigurd.einum@bio.ntnu.no 384 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00468.x encounter rates because of high upstream densities are and whether reduced prey quality as well as quantity can explain density-dependent growth. here, we test for density-dependent diet composi- tion using juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). these are visual predators (thorpe et al. 1988) that primarily feed by intercepting invertebrates drifting downstream (jørgensen & jobling 1992; keeley & grant 1995). choice in prey size is partly affected by gape size, as larger salmon are able to feed on larger prey (wankowski 1979; keeley & grant 1997). thus, for this species, there is a clear expectation that there exists an optimal diet that maximises growth rate for a certain overall prey delivery rate. furthermore, if high upstream population density decreases the amount of drift passing through any given territory, optimal foraging theory predicts individuals to consume a wider range of prey. to evaluate whether patterns in density-dependent diet composition are in accordance with optimal foraging theory, we created spatial variation in young-of-the-year (yoy) juvenile density by planting single nests in each of three replicate streams and obtained detailed information on the individual positions (±1 m) and the diet (from stomach samples) of the resulting juveniles ca. 2 months after their emergence from nests. we then compared models to test local density on diet (taxonomic and prey size), as well as identifying the spatial scale over which measures of population density best explained variation in diet. the effects of for materials and methods stocking and sampling ten female and ten male atlantic salmon caught in a ﬁsh trap in river blackwater, a tributary of the river conon, ross-shire in northern scotland, during october 2007 were used to produce ten full-sib family groups. the fertilised eggs were incubated in the scottish and southern energy hatchery at contin where the family groups were kept separately in hatchery trays. eyed eggs were outplanted in artiﬁcial nests in three small tributaries of the river conon during 17–26th of density-dependent diet composition february 2008. all streams are located above migration barriers and are thus without natural salmon spawning. in two of the three streams, there were self-sustaining brown_trout populations, whereas older salmon (‡1+ age) resulting from stocking in previous years were present in one stream (table 1). mean wetted widths and depths (measured over transects every 10 m along the experimental stretch) during summer ﬂow were 3.4 m and 15 cm, 3.7 m and 15 cm and 1.1 m and 10 cm for streams 1, 2 and 3, respectively. all streams received eggs of an identical genetic stock composition, i.e., equal numbers from each of the 10 family groups. the eggs from the different family groups were placed in separate vibert boxes (federation of fly fishermen, bozeman, mt, usa) that were placed within a depression in the gravelbed of the stream and covered with gravel and larger stones. each stream received one nest, and this was expected to produce a decreasing gradient in density away from the nest (see distribution for this study in fig. 1). each nest contained either 1000 or 3000 eggs (table 1). during 15–24th july 2008, each stream was electroﬁshed in a section stretching from 150 m below the nest site up to the ﬁrst migration barrier upstream of the nest (table 1). two to three complete passes were performed depending on logistic constraints (table 1). for each ﬁsh caught, the location (±1 m) along the length of the stream was recorded before it was killed and put into an individual tube ﬁlled with ethanol. fish body lengths (±1 mm) were measured within 2 weeks of sampling, and ﬁn clips were taken for later genotyping. the location of other ﬁsh captured (trout and older salmon) was recorded on a coarser spatial scale (10 m sections), and measure- ments of the body length of these were taken in the ﬁeld. these were released back into the stream after completion of sampling. because of the coarser spatial resolution of the data on these older ﬁsh than for the yoy, they were not included in the analyses. fin clips of the parental ﬁsh and all recaptured juveniles in the three streams were sent to a commercial genotyping company (matı´s-prokaria, reykjavik, for genotyping (see appendix s1 for a detailed descrip- tion of this method). iceland) table 1. number of yoy and older atlantic salmon and brown_trout caught and their mean body length ± 1 sd (bl, mm) during electroﬁshing in three different study sites of the river conon. the number of eggs outplanted and the number of complete passes of electroﬁshing conducted in each stream are given. location of upstream migration barriers (mb) is given in distance (m) upstream from nest. stream name stream allt gleann chorainn allt coire a bhuic am-fuar alltan 1 2 3 yoy, young-of-the-year salmon yoy salmon > yoy trout yoy trout > yoy eggs 1000 1000 3000 mb passes 22 21 16 2 3 2 n 279 167 207 bl 49 ± 3 48 ± 6 37 ± 3 n 19 0 0 bl 119 ± 6 – – n 3 8 0 bl 54 ± 5 45 ± 8 – n 24 22 0 bl 127 ± 22 138 ± 19 – 385 martinussen et al.

(2007). the chosen prey categories were chironomidae (subfami- 386 lies orthocladiinae, tanypodinae and tanytarsini), other chironomidae, simuliidae, ephemeroptera, ple- coptera, trichoptera and ﬁnally, a category for those falling outside of these classiﬁcations. to prevent double counting of fragmented prey individuals, only head capsules were counted. chironomids were classiﬁed into subfamilies because of high numerical importance in the ﬁsh diet. the head capsule widths of the ﬁrst 10 chironomidae and ephemeroptera encoun- tered in each stomach were measured under a stereo- microscope using a measuring ocular. if there were <10 individuals in a category, all were measured. only salmon caught during the ﬁrst pass were used for diet analyses because of the disturbance of the riverbed during the ﬁrst pass and its potential inﬂuence on diet of subsequent ﬁsh caught. further, individuals with empty stomachs (n = 3) were excluded from statistical analysis. the stomach contents of 426 juveniles were analysed (n = 180, 102 and 144 for streams 1, 2 and 3, respectively). from these stomach samples, a total of 7790 prey were identiﬁed. overall, the diet was dominated by chironomidae (n = 3435) and ephe- meroptera (n = 2825). for analyses of prey size distributions, we therefore focused on these. measures of diet composition individual diet breadth was quantiﬁed in terms of both taxon and prey size distributions. taxonomical diet breadth was calculated using the levins index b (levins 1968): b ¼ 1p p2 i ð1þ where pi is the proportion of the diet that is represented by diet category i. this index has a minimum at 1.0 when only one prey type is found in the diet and a maximum at n, where n is the total number of prey categories, each representing an equal proportion of the diet. individual diet breadth with regard to prey size was calculated as the coefﬁcient of variation (cv) for the dry weight of both chironomidae and ephemeroptera in the diet of each juvenile salmon. this gives a the prey size variation within each measure of individual. based on head capsule width, the dry weight (w) was calculated using ð2þ ln w ¼ ln a þ b ln hc where hc is the head capsule width, and the constants a and b for chironomidae are 1.673 and 2.30, respectively (smock 1980). for ephemeroptera, the constants used were based upon whether the prey were heptageniidae ()2.010 and 3.56) or nonhepta- geniidae (0.759 and 3.57). cv was only calculated for juveniles containing at least ﬁve chironomidae or ephemeroptera in their stomachs. to investigate the effect of density on prey sizes found in the diet, the mean dry weight of chironomidae and ephemero- ptera was calculated for every recaptured juvenile. spatial scale of density the issue of spatial scale of density dependence is usually ignored completely in experimental studies, and a predetermined spatial scale (e.g. 100 m2) is chosen based on some unstated assumptions. thus, in this study, we present a systematic approach for identifying the most relevant spatial scale. to examine the spatial scale of association between density and diet variation, two-dimensional matrices were created that represented the pairwise distances dij between all locations yielding recaptures for each stream. indivi- duals from all passes were used in these calculations. assuming that the effect of individuals at location j, nj, on individuals at location i can be modelled as a linearly decreasing function with increasing distance dij and that there is a minimum distance d* over which there is no effect, the relative effect ƒ(dij) of different neighbouring locations can be modelled as   fðdijþ ¼ ð1   dij 0; dij>d dþnj; dij  d ð3þ because streams vary longitudinally in width, the effect of an upstream neighbour may depend on the width of the stream at its location. to control for such effects, the relative effect ƒ(dij) of different neighbour- ing locations was modiﬁed. if the effect of an upstream neighbouring location j on a focal is proportional to the width of the stream at that location, wj, the expression for ƒ(dij) becomes location i ) ( dþ nj fðdijþ ¼ ð1   dij wj 0; dij>d ; dij  d ð4þ widths of streams used in these calculations were the wetted widths measured at the measuring transect closest to each recapture location (i.e. at a maximum distance of 5 m away from the location). using eq. (4), the spatially weighted density di for individuals at each location was calculated as the summed effect of neighbouring locations weighted by their pairwise distance di ¼ x fðdijþ ð5þ n j¼1 the biology of juvenile salmonids, being primarily drift feeders, suggests that the delivery rate of food for an individual at a given location is primarily affected by other individuals being located upstream of themselves. thus, negative values of dij in the distance density-dependent diet composition matrices (individuals j being downstream of focal individuals i) were not included when calculating di. values of di were calculated for a range of values of d* from one (only inﬂuenced by individuals caught within the same metre) to 164 (inﬂuenced by individuals <164 m upstream). owing to a lack of information on relative spatial position of individuals within each metre, we made the approximation that each individual within a given metre was negatively inﬂuenced by all other individuals within the same metre. statistical analyses all data analyses were conducted in r (v. 2.9.1, r foundation for statistical computing, 2009, vienna, austria). linear mixed effects models using the function lmer in the lme4 package (bates & maechler 2009) were created for every diet measure, and model performance was compared using akaike’s informa- tion criterion (aic). the maximal model contained density, salmon body length and stream as ﬁxed effects and family as random effect. the subsequent seven models were simpliﬁcations of this. for models containing density, these were created for every d* (1– 164 m) and the one yielding the lowest aic was determined and used in the comparison. to satisfy assumptions of normality and homogeneity in the models, mean chironomidae and ephemeroptera dry weights were log-transformed. results diet composition for the analysis on taxon-based diet breadth (levins b), the model with the lowest aic value contained the effects of density and stream with density being measured over a spatial scale of 44 m. however, this model was not than the one containing only stream (daic = 0.6), showing that the extra complexity of adding density was redundant. thus, density had no effect regardless of the spatial scale upon which density was measured. the mean ± sd levins b was 2.3 ± 0.6, 2.7 ± 0.9 and 2.4 ± 1.0 for streams 1, 2 and 3, respectively. sufﬁciently better model comparisons were successful in establishing a spatial scale that best described the relation between prey size-based diet breadth (cv) with respect to chironomidae and density (table 2a). the model with the lowest aic contained both effects of density and stream, with density being measured over a spatial scale of 1 m. furthermore, all four models containing density were better than the ones without and the difference in aic between the best models with and without density was 18.2. based on the best model, there was a signiﬁcant increase in cv with increasing 387 martinussen et al. table 2. aic comparison of mixed effects models of size-based diet breadth (cv) in young-of-the-year atlantic salmon with respect to (a) chironomidae and (b) ephemeroptera and mean prey size with respect to (c) chironomidae and (d) ephemeroptera.

townsend & winﬁeld 1985; stephens & krebs 1986). low-quality prey may either represent particular prey taxa of low proﬁtability or represent prey individuals of a given taxon that have a suboptimal size. although the spatial variation in resource availability was not quantiﬁed in this study, decreased prey ingestion rates at high local density seem like a likely factor contributing to decreased growth. decreased prey ingestion rates can result from either exploitative competition leading to depletion of prey delivery rates see discussion in ward et al. 2007; and imre et al. 2009), or individuals spending increased time on competitive interactions and hence having a reduced time available for feeding. alternatively, increased density may have led to a decreased mean territory quality (ward et al. 2007) owing to an increasing use of territories that provide suboptimal feeding condi- tions [i.e. low and ⁄ or high water currents yielding low drift rates or reduced feeding efﬁciency, respectively (nislow et al. 2000)]. either of these mechanisms may have caused yoy at high density to incorporate a wider range of prey sizes. (imre et al. 2005; but the length of the spatial scale that best described the relationship between prey size-based diet breadth and density was identiﬁed to 1 m for chironomidae and 116 m for ephemeroptera. the reason for this difference is unknown. for drift-feeding animals living in habitats characterised by a unidirectional ﬂow of water (such as streams), the effect of an upstream individual removing prey from the drift on the prey delivery rate experienced by a downstream individual will depend on the distance prey organisms disperse during a single ‘event’. the upstream individual can be thought of as creating a shadow in the downstream direction within which the delivery rate of drifting prey is reduced (elliott 2002). predictions regarding the spatial scale of shadow competition in juvenile salmon (i.e. ‘shadows’ created by feeding individuals) can then, at least in theory, be based on distances over which individual invertebrates remain in the drift before resettling on the substrate. however, invertebrate drift distances vary considerably depend- ing on taxa, life cycle stage, photoperiod, current velocity and depth (reviewed by brittain & eikeland 1988). in an experimental study of invertebrate drift distances, released chironomidae larvae were shown to be poor swimmers and remained in the drift up to an average of 4–6 m before resettling on the substrate (elliott 1971). however, it is not known whether drift distances for released individuals are transferrable to normal conditions. ephemeroptera on the other hand were agile swimmers that actively settled in the substrate and drifted an average of 1–6 m. these ﬁndings are counterintuitive to the results in this study 389 martinussen et al. where the size distribution of ephemeroptera eaten by an individual was affected by the presence of other individuals within 116 m upstream. however, little is known about typical dispersal lengths during volun- tary drift events. because of the superior swimming performance of ephemeroptera, it may be expected that, given motivation, these will be able to drift over much longer distances within a given time period than the chironomidae. furthermore, ephemeroptera have been shown to have high ‘voluntary’ drift rates (clifford 1972) and such drift may be triggered by chemical cues from drift-feeding ﬁsh (forrester 1994; tikkanen et al. 1994; diehl et al. 2000; mcintosh et al. 2002). such processes cause individual ephemeroptera to disperse over larger distances, either in one single step or in a series of consecutive steps, a greater spatial scale of shadow competition can be expected for these than for the chironomidae. if whereas no effect of local yoy density on mean chironomidae size was found, the mean size of ephemeroptera found in the stomachs increased with increasing density. overall across the streams, the mean size of ephemeroptera eaten was more than four times that of chironomidae (0.19 vs. 0.84 mg). thus, it is possible that owing to the generally larger size of ephemeroptera, yoy salmon at the early stage studied here primarily utilise the smaller ones among those available in the drift and that at decreasing prey delivery rate owing to increased local density, the yoy broaden their diet by including larger ephemer- optera. this is also supported by the observation that both mean and cv of ephemeroptera in stomach samples increased with yoy body size. optimal prey size is expected to increase with ﬁsh body size, as larger individuals are able to handle prey of larger size faster than smaller individuals (wankowski 1979). whereas larger prey represent greater energy rewards (gill 2003), they also require increased handling times (bannon & ringler 1986; gill 2003). accordingly, wankowski & thorpe (1979) reported an optimal prey size for atlantic salmon that yielded maximum growth and deviations from this optimum resulted in reduced growth rate. thus, our observed changes in diet breadth and mean size of prey with increasing local density are likely to come at an energetic cost, which in addition to the reduced delivery rate of prey may contribute to the commonly observed density-depen- dent growth of juvenile salmonids (e.g. crisp 1993; jenkins et al. 1999; keeley 2001; nordwall et al. 2001; imre et al. 2005; lobon-cervia 2005; einum et al. 2006). an alternative explanation may be that larger ephemeroptera become relatively more avail- able at higher ﬁsh density owing to a behavioural drift response. however, no previous studies exist to evaluate such a hypothesis, and more importantly, it cannot explain the response in chironomidae cv to 390 juvenile density, which do not have similar potential for swimming. density did not appear to inﬂuence taxon-based diet breadth. one potential explanation for this is that the prey taxa were categorised too coarsely, thereby yielding low resolution to test for such effects. alternatively, the lack of a relation between density and taxon-based diet breadth may be a result of the feeding habit of the yoy atlantic salmon. stream- dwelling salmonids are in general opportunistic foragers (gibson 1993; keeley & grant 1997), and there is usually a positive relationship between the proportion of prey of different taxa in the diet and that in the drift (allan 1981; keeley & grant 1997), whereas size selectivity is strong (ringler 1979; keeley & grant 1997). thus, yoy atlantic salmon may show little selectivity in terms of prey taxa composition relative to that available in the drift, but rather be selective in terms of prey size. in conclusion, these results show that increased population density can lead to increased diet breadth. higher population densities likely decreased the delivery rate of optimally sized prey in the drift, and individuals became increasingly generalised by in- corporating a wider range of prey sizes in their diets. according to optimal foraging theory, such shifts in diet as a response to higher density (and presumably lower availability of preferred prey) are predicted to negatively inﬂuence energetic efﬁciency and may therefore have contributed to the negative effect of local density on juvenile salmon growth (einum et al. in press). acknowledgements we thank j. henry, a. foldvik, r. kaspersson, r. knudsen, s. mckelvey and the staff at the conon district salmon fisheries board for assistance in the ﬁeld, j. d. armstrong for logistic support, t. forseth and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and t. ekrem of the museum of natural history and archaeology, ntnu for assistance with identiﬁcation of chironomidae. financial support was provided by the research council of norway. this study was conducted in accordance with national animal care guidelines. references allan, j.d. 1981. determinants of diet of brook_trout in a mountain stream. canadian (salvelinus_fontinalis) journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 38: 184–192. allan, j.d. 1995. stream ecology: structure and function of running waters. london: chapman & hall. xii, 388 pp. bannon, e. & ringler, n.h. 1986. optimal prey size for stream tests of predictive resident brown_trout models. canadian journal of zoology 64: 704–713.
