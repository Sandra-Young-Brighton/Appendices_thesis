shields et al. 2003). compar- isons of stream morphology, ﬂow conditions and population densities of ﬁshes in both altered and unaltered sections in the same stream have shown that: (i) channel alterations change the stream morphology and thus the ﬂow conditions, (ii) morphological and hydrodynamic factors interact and (iii) these factors affects ﬁsh habitats in general. several studies reports that stabilised water levels largely eliminate adult spawning and foraging habitat, as well as larval and juvenile refuge sites (paller et al. 2000; kondolf et al. 2001; downs & kondolf 2002). it in japan, is also well known that channel alterations change general ﬁsh fauna and standing crops (mizuno & gose 1981). as a general rule, habitat requirements of ﬁsh are meet by complex habitat structure and biological connectivity, which have been lost because of canalization. thus, restora- tions of rivers where the natural ﬂow conditions, the hydraulic complexity, and the habitats are restored are needed in a conservation prospect (takahashi & higashi 1984). transformed the river canalization of the shibetsu river, eastern hokka- ido, japan, from a natural, meandering system to a drainage canal that is com- partmentalised with levees and water control struc- tures. the canalization stabilised the water level and ﬂow regimes, accelerated the current speed, and drained a vast ﬂoodplain wetland, which was trans- formed into grassland. the ﬁsh and wildlife was severely negatively affected by this. the ﬁrst recon- struction phase of the shibetsu river was completed in march 2002 and additional phases of reconstruction are planned in the near future after the ﬁrst phase evaluation. the long-term goal of the restoration project is to restore the ecological integrity of the river system by reconstructing the meanders and re-estab- lishing the natural hydrologic processes. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00153.x 125 akita et al. this study was the ﬁrst attempt to examine upstream migration of chum salmon [oncorhynchus_keta (walbaum, 1772)] from the canalized segment to the restored segment in the shibetsu river, by means of simultaneous migration route radio tracking and swimming depth data logging. we also compared moving and holding behaviours of ﬁsh in relation to the water depth of the swimming depth of ﬁsh, and the vertical position of ﬁsh in the water column. the river, current speed, materials and methods study area shibetsu river is located in north-eastern hokkaido, japan. during the past century, the shibetsu river was reclaimed from a meandering complex river system, to a canalized ﬂood-control canal. the river ﬂows to the nemuro straight with a total length of about 78 km, and a drainage basin area of 671 km2. under the ﬁrst restoration phase, the canalized river was reconnected to an original oxbow (hereafter denoted the ‘restored segment’) 8.4 km from the river mouth. the restored meandering segment is approximately 500 m in length. behaviour of upstream migrating chum salmon was monitored from the releasing point (6.8 km from the river mouth), although the canalized segment, and through the restored meandering segment. capture, tagging and tracking of chum salmon movement and data analysis chum salmon showing nuptial colours as secondary sexual characteristics were collected from a capture station at the shibetsu river mouth. the ﬁsh were anaesthetised with 0.005% fa100 (eugenol; tanabe seiyaku co. ltd, osaka, japan) and data loggers and radio transmitters were sutured to the anterior part of the dorsal ﬁn with nylon tie while the ﬁsh was submerged in water. after tagging each ﬁsh were weighed and the fork length (lf) measured (range body range lf: 7080–8220 mm) weight: 3.87–6.81 kg, and the ﬁsh were transferred to a recovery live-box and allowed 1–3 days to recover from anaesthesia and surgery. after the recovery period, the ﬁsh were released at the 6.8 km river point, 1.6 km downstream from the conﬂuence point of the main river and the meandering segment. the ﬁsh were tagged and released before and after the river restoration: before the river restoration, 7 and 8 november, 2001 (ﬁve males); after the river restoration, 19–21 september (ﬁve males) and 9–11 october 2002 (six males). a total of 16 mature male chum salmon were tagged with archival tags and radio transmitters. two types of archival tags (little leonardo co. ltd, tokyo, japan) 126 were used: in 2001, swimming depth and ambient temperature of the ﬁsh were recorded using a depth/ temperature (dt) logger (m190-dt; max depth 190 m, resolution 0.05 m, temperature resolution 0.02 °c); in 2002, a dt logger and a speed/depth/temperature logger (w380l-pdt; both little leonardo; however no speed data were obtained from the pdt sensor because of mechanical difﬁculties and only depth, temperature data were obtained) were used. the sampling rate was 1 s for all data that were analysed after retrieving the archival tags. we tracked the upstream migration of the salmon using radio transmitters (mbft-2 or mbft-4, lotek engineering inc., newmarket, canada). the radio transmitters were attached directly to the data logger by epoxy resin and wires. tracking was carried out using three radio receivers (srx_400, version 4.03/ w20as/w32c, lotek). fish positions were monitored by receiving signals from transmitters using a direc- tional antenna. later, water depths and current speeds were meas- ured at the locations along the river where the ﬁsh positions were pinpointed. current speeds were measured at three layers (top, middle and bottom) of the water column using an electromagnetic current meter (es 7603; yokogawa denshikiki co., ltd, tokyo, japan). also from the tracking data, at each point, we were able to conclude whether a ﬁsh was )1 over a ‘moving’ period of 3 min) or ‘holding’ its position (travelling )1 over a period of 3 min). with this on average <1 mæs information, we compared moving and holding behav- iours in relation to the water depth of the river (water depth), the current speed, the swimming depth of ﬁsh (ﬁsh swimming depth), and the vertical swimming position of ﬁsh in the water column (the ﬁsh swimming depth divided by the water depth). (travelling on average >1 mæs statistical analyses comparisons of the ambient environment of the ﬁsh (water depth, ﬁsh swimming depth and current speed) between holding and moving behaviour were analysed using student’s t-test. results were expressed as mean ± se. results selectivity of restored area in 2001 (before the restoration), two of four ﬁsh moved upstream from the release point in the shibetsu river and were tracked. the tracked salmon often travelled parallel to and near the shore, and were clearly visible from the bank. one of the ﬁsh reached the location where the river later was restored, while the other ﬁsh upstream migration of chum salmon through a rehabilitated river moved upstream only about 500 m from the release point. consequently, we had only few data on swim- ming proﬁles from the prerestoration situation. in 2002 (after the restoration), three of 11 ﬁsh reached the conﬂuence point, and all three of these ﬁsh chose to enter the restored meandering segment, passing rapidly through the entire segment (fig. 1a–c). these ﬁsh moved into the restored meandering segment by approaching from the right bank approxi- mately 20 m downstream from the conﬂuence point. monitoring chum salmon with data loggers and radio transmitters a total of seven loggers were retrieved by anglers or by ourselves using electro-ﬁshing gear. in 2001, two dt archival tags were retrieved. in 2002, one dt archival tag and four pdt archival tags were retrieved. a temporal proﬁle of water depth and swimming paths of the tracked salmon indicated that ﬁve of 16 ﬁsh moved upstream in 2001 and 2002 and that they swum near the bottom of the water column and along the riverbanks. this type of migration behaviour, termed ‘line swimming’ is a common phenomenon in large river systems (ellis 1966; hinch & rand 2000). the ﬁsh were stationary for extended periods in slow currents with vegetative cover and moved in the shallower sections where there was relatively little cover. the patterns of horizontal and vertical positions of migrating chum salmon selected to enter the reconstructed segment are shown in fig. 1a–c. holding and moving behaviours were compared under the parameters of the water depth, the current speed, the ﬁsh depth and the ﬁsh relative depth. a total of 136 location points (40 holding and 96 moving points) were collected along the river, including both the canalized and meandering segment in fig. 2a–d. although there were no statistical differences in the four parameters (student’s t-test, p > 0.05), holding and moving behaviours were positively inﬂuenced by the water depth (fig. 2a) and the ﬁsh swimming depth (fig. 2b) speed (fig. 2c). there was little difference in the relative ﬁsh depth position between holding and moving behaviours (fig. 2d). and negatively by the current during periods of holding, it was observed that ﬁsh often selected areas with fallen trees or areas with vegetative cover. eighty per cent of the holding areas had fallen trees or vegetative cover and the remaining 20% contained large rocks or cement blocks used for bank stabilisation (data not shown). discussion chum salmon often travelled parallel to and near the riverbanks in general, water swimming). (line velocities increase with distance from the riverbank and the bed of the river. so, the line swimming suggests that chum salmon are encountering slower currents where the energy cost for migration is low. this behaviour is believed to be essential for the success of upstream migration for adult salmonid migrants (hinch et al. 2002; hughes 2004). suggests comparing the holding and moving behaviours of the salmon, the ﬁsh tended to chose slower currents at holding, but there was no signiﬁcant difference between preference for water depth at holding and moving. however when ﬁsh did hold position, they tended to lower themselves in the water column. additionally, they selected areas with fallen trees, vegetative cover or areas near large rocks as holding sites. this that disturbed or weakened currents often functions as chum salmon cover. in the shibetsu river, fallen trees, vegetative cover and large rocks were utilised in 80% of the recorded holding sites. in contrast, the restored meandering segment mainly consisted of a shallow gravel bed and sandbanks with little vegetation. fish also encountered stronger currents in the meandering segment than in the canalized river segment. thus, few suitable holding sites were available in the restored segment compared with the canalized segment, which may explain why the salmon entering the restored mean- dering segment quickly passed through it. studies using more sophisticated methods of measuring micro site currents than our approach may be needed for a better understanding of this energy-saving migration pattern (hinch & rand 2000). the spawning areas, the energy cost of upstream migration may not be an important factor for chum salmon in a small river as shibetsu river. however, berman & quinn (1991) reported that as ﬁsh have more stores of energy at the probability of successful migration and spawning become higher. because feeding stops prior to migration and ﬁsh must rely on stored energy reserves (hasler et al. 1978), reducing migratory energy costs is important to all migrants. in this study, nearly all ﬁsh showed patterns of line swimming, which suggests that ﬁsh chose slower currents to reduce the energy costs of migration. also, the present study suggests that differences in total migration distance from the sea to the spawning grounds affects the i.e., upstream movement efﬁ- behavioural pattern; ciency is to long-distance migrants, is relatively important whereas holding behaviour for in a short- distance river like the shibetsu river, the presence of deep and slow sites for holding may be more important than shallow and fast sites for moving. short-distance migrants. hence, the results of important an ideal, natural meandering system contains complex ﬂow conditions and rifﬂe-pool sequences 127 akita et al.
