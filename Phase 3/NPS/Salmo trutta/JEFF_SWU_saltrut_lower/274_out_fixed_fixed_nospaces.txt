the imprinting may be a single event or may occur sequentially during downstream migration as smolts. the two hypotheses were challenged by reciprocal transplantation of parr, residents and smolt of arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) between the salangen and the løksebotten rivers. both rivers empty into the salangen fjord, norway, about 10 km apart. salangen arctic char released in the løksebotten river, and løksebotten brown_trout released in the salangen river (parr, resident and smolt) initiated spontaneous homeward migration without preceding contact with home stream water. this indicates that site imprinting (single or sequential) could not have been involved. in the sea, the released ﬁsh apparently integrated into the migratory system of relatives from their river of origin. recapture rates did not differ for ﬁsh allowed to receive single or sequential imprinting. h. nordeng1, p. bratland2 1department of biology, university of oslo, oslo, norway, 2institute of marine research, bergen, norway key words: arctic char;

see bellenden 1822) and the norwegian peder claussøn friis (1599, see storm 1881). peder claussøn friis additionally presented the widespread opinion that ﬁsh that performed extensive seasonal migrations in the sea was guided by extraordinary pilot ﬁsh that had supernatural abilities given to them by god. the mackerel scomber scombrus was supposed to be guided by the tuna thunnus thynnus, the herring clupea harengus by the oarﬁsh (king of herrings) regalecus glesne, while the salmon was guided by the kingﬁsh lampris guttatus, known locally as the ‘salmon-steerer’. each kingﬁsh guided a certain 488 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00188.x number of salmon smolt to their feeding area in the norwegian sea, and back again as far as to their home coastal waters. what was ‘most to wonder at’, according to friis, ‘is that salmon still ﬁnd their way back to the home river, and the actual place where they were born and bred, to reproduce their stock and species’ (present authors own translation). each river has its own particular salmon, even when there is not more than a ‘bow-shot’ between their river mouths. the seasonal return migration occurred with remark- able regularity. how can salmon in the open sea know exactly when to commence their homeward migration and which direction to choose? how can salmon moving at high speed maintain the appropriate course in open sea and varied coastal waters, choose the right fjord and river, and subsequently recognise their birthplace in the river when they arrive? the early hypotheses (over the ages 1599–1964) proposed to explain the homing phenom- enon is reviewed in nordeng (1989b). two of these hypotheses have been and still are relevant in research and management. the imprinting hypothesis (single or sequential) holds that homing depends on recognition of speciﬁc stream odours that were learnt in the juvenile stage. the odour may be imprinted at a speciﬁc site (hasler & wisby 1951) or rather sequentially as the smolt moved downstream (harden jones 1968, p. 265). homeward orientation in the sea is proposed to be true navigation by means of the sun and other celestial bodies (hasler 1966; compare with braemer 1960) or true navigation without any external aid (quinn 1982; hansen et al. 1993; hansen & quinn 1998). this implies that at any given moment the ﬁsh must ‘know’ its position in the sea relative to the river of origin. the pheromone hypothesis (nordeng 1971, 1977), on the other hand, states that the entire homeward migration is initiated and directed by pheromone trails derived from related smolt descending almost con- tinually from their respective freshwater home local- ities to the sea during spring and summer. the two hypotheses differ with regard to the odours that identify home and with regard to whether the response is learned or innate (brannon & quinn 1989, compare with long 1991). the concept of olfactory imprinting not earlier than during a sensitive period at the end of smolting seems to arise from traditional transplantation of hatchery- reared atlantic and paciﬁc salmon fry, ﬁngerlings and smolts to speciﬁc sites of release (rivers or hatcheries) (hasler 1960; rosseland 1965; carlin 1969; brannon 1982; hasler & scholz 1983). carlin (1969) ascertains that the smell of water is not imprinted during the parr stage, but during a few days immediately before entering the sea. however, in lake_trout salvelinus_namaycush and white bass morone chrysops, horrall homing in arctic char and brown_trout (1981) found that olfactory imprinting most probably occurred during hatching to the swim-up stage of the larvae or even earlier. with special reference to sockeye salmon fry that typically hatch in tributaries and then continue to develop in large lakes, imprinting would have to occur during the incubation or emergence period (brannon 1972; quinn et al. 1983; quinn 1990; quinn & dittman 1990; varnavskaya et al. 1994). in fry of studies have documented migration from different riverine hatching sites to common rearing lakes by negative, positive or negative followed by positive rheotactic behaviour sockeye salmon (brannon 1972), rainbow trout (northcote 1969; kelso et al. 1981) and in freshwater-dwelling brown_trout salmo_trutta (kaasa 1980). thus, to reach their relatives in the rearing area, the fry have to migrate through water never ‘experienced’ before (nordeng 1989a). the continuous production of speciﬁc odours within ﬁsh schools ensures school cohesion and behaviour (wrede 1932; go¨z 1941; keenleyside 1955; hemmings 1966; mcfarland & moss 1967; bardach & todd 1970; kleerekoper 1982; hara 1992). in this study, we present a homing experiment involving early life history stages (parr, smolt and freshwater resident) of anadromous arctic char salv- elinus alpinus and brown_trout salmo_trutta origin- ating and løksebotten river systems, respectively. two different transplant experiments were performed to test the hypotheses explaining the mechanisms for salmonid homing. the pheromone hypothesis compared with proposed single and sequential imprinting to external cues. fish were captured in the home river, tagged and transported to the neighbouring river. there the ﬁsh were allowed to either move freely downstream (allowing sequential imprinting) or were only allowed to become singly imprinted for a short period before being released directly into the fjord outside the outlets of both rivers. recaptures were then made in both the home river and the river of release. neighbouring from the salangen study systems the bedrock in the catchment areas of the salangen and løksebotten rivers (fig. 1) is similar, mainly mica schist and mica gneiss and some minor areas with calcite and dolomite marble (sigmond et al. 1984). below the marine limit, 75–80 m a.s.l., the rivers run through sediments derived from raised glaciﬂuvial deltas dating from preboreal, the last part of the deglaciation period, 10,000–9000 years ago. these two rivers are quite comparable to each other: they both arise in and ﬂow in parallel through the same geological formations. the lakes øvervatnet and nervatnet were raised above sea level approximately 489 nordeng and bratland fig. 1. salangen and løksebotten river sy- stems, the arena for reciprocal transplanta- tion experiments of parr, smolt and residents of arctic char salvelinus_alpinus and brown_trout salmo_trutta. salinity in the upper layer of the salangen fjord between løksa and ha˚kavika are 26–27 ppt. at the shore in the inner bay of the fjord (*) salinity was measured to be 10–15 ppt. figure 2 illustrates successive life history events of the salangen anadromous salmonids: the parr stage, residents, smelting, migration and reproduction. evi- dently, the timing of the different life history events differs between individuals and species. in arctic char as an example, parr contains at least six year-classes (6–26 cm). parr may develop into mature residents (ages 2–7, 14–30 cm) or smolt (3–7 years, 17–26 cm). further, mature parr may transform into smolt (17– 26 cm) at ages of 4–9 years (compare with fig. 3). four successive sojourns in the sea complete the sexual maturation in the anadromous fraction (26– 42 cm). the life history events for arctic char and brown_trout are quite similar (fig. 2). migratory groups may include individuals of different life history stages at identical age comprising mature and immature veteran migrants, and smolt of parr and residents (see fig. 2, arctic char – year-classes 4, 5 and 6, and brown_trout – year-classes 4 and 5). further, successive year- classes in arctic char (ages 4–6) and brown_trout (ages 4–5) may each contain all life history stages (n ¼ 5), comprising parr, residents, smolt of parr and residents, immature and mature anadromous individuals. several studies prompted by the pheromone hypo- thesis revealed that ‘salmonids distinguish and prefer the chemical emanation of their own population over those of similarly aged members of another conspe- ciﬁc population’ (review in courtenay et al. 1997). previously, døving et al. (1973, 1974) found that young char of the lake øvervatnet and the salangen river population discriminated odours of each other, and two different southern char populations. all were reared in isolation in the hatchery at voss. the salangen parents were small resident morph of the lake øvervatnet population and anadromous morph of the salangen river population. in the study of 2500 years ago. the vegetation in the two lakes, especially in the outlet areas, consists mainly of different species of the genus potamogeton, and the algae nitella sp. and cara sp. (reiersen 1942). today the salangen and løksebotten river systems are both surrounded by woods, roads and agricultural areas, but they differ in some relevant characteristics. ascending ﬁsh in the løksebotten river system have to pass through a 2.5-km long turbulent stretch of the river to reach the lake røyrbakkvatnet at 26 m a.s.l. (fig. 1). in the river salangen, the distance between the sea and nervatnet is only 0.8 km. water discharge in the salangen river system varies consid- )1 in june and july. erably, between 50 and 150 m3æs the river løksebotten water discharge is more stable, )1. maximum water varying between 8 and 40 m3 s temperatures in the salangen and løksebotten river systems are 15 and 18 °c, respectively, and both systems are alkaline with ph between 7.4 and 7.6. the water from the two river systems mixes in the fjord. summer salinity in the upper waters of the fjord is 26– 27 ppt. the life history and migratory system of løksebot- ten arctic char and brown_trout are as described for the species in the salangen river system (nordeng 1977, 1983; nordeng & skurdal 1985; nordeng et al. 1989). however, downstream and subsequent upstream migration starts about 1 week earlier in the løksebot- ten river system owing to the higher temperature (2– 3 °c) in the migration period. migratory ﬁsh (both char and trout) from the salangen and the løksebotten river systems intermingle in the fjord during their annual migration (nordeng 1971). the salangen river system (fig. 1) has not been involved in ﬁsh cultivation, and thus has its own original populations of arctic char, brown_trout and atlantic salmon (until lately). 490 homing in arctic char and brown_trout open sea coastal waters fjord fresh water year classes : 25 days 35 days 60 days sea age, years : immature salmon maturing, ascending salmon fry parr   smolt of the year veteran migrants :  immature mature mature resident males mature resident females fig. 2. age composition, life history and migratory system in arctic char salvelinus_alpinus (i), brown_trout salmo_trutta (ii) and atlantic salmon salmo_salar (iii), in the salangen river system, north norway. the ﬁgure is based on data in nordeng (1961, 1977, 1983). the species are arranged acc- ording to decreasing strength of their freshwater bases, e.g., number of age clas- ses. however, stay at sea increases, 15 and 23 weeks annually in arctic char and brown_trout, and 1–3 years in atlantic salmon. increasing tendency also appears in the migratory descending smolt and ascending ﬁsh overlap in time; 25, 35 and 60 days (d), respectively. schedules where døving et al. (1973), mucous was a very potent olfactory stimulus. it was found that the skin straying of salangen arctic char to foreign rivers is rare, one of 173 (0.6%), as revealed by tagging experiments (nordeng 1971). however, in a particular tagging operation on juvenile char (n ¼ 329), smolt of the year exhibited a straying rate of 27% (13 of 48 ﬁsh) apportioned the following three seasons to the løksebotten river (fig. 1), and to speciﬁc nonlake rivers in the lavangen and the gratangen fjords southwards. the straying smolt were members of large schools of juvenile appearing in the salangen estuary and in the outlet of lake nervatnet late in the season of 1952 (july 25–august 8). this late point of time may indicate straying of foreign smolt to the salangen river system resulting in overwintering there (com- pare with armstrong 1984). the anadromous fraction of salangen arctic char and brown_trout at sea return for homeward migration during june (nordeng 1977; fig. 2) without noticeable changes in external factors such as light, sea temper- atures or salinity. seawater tolerance in arctic char after that period was tested (in 1962) on reared anadromous and resident morphs of salangen anadr- omous parents. the ﬁsh were adapted to seawater, 33– 34 ppt salinity in outdoor basins at the bergen aquarium. appetite decreased drastically during august and at the end of september all char had died. similar experimental conditions and results are des- cribed for salangen arctic char (gjedrem 1975). it is obvious that after june–july arctic char avoid sea- water, brown_trout tolerate it and atlantic salmon prefers it. thus, in contrast with atlantic salmon, arctic char and brown_trout ﬁt in a necessary winter stay in fresh water during their postsmolt life history (cf. klemetsen et al. 2003). methods arctic char in the salangen river system and brown_trout in the løksebotten river system were captured for tagging during spring using beach seine (5 mm mesh size). fish were caught during outward migra- tion, in the outlet area of the lakes nervatnet and røyrbakkvatnet, respectively. all ﬁsh were measured (length), anaesthetised with ms-222 and tagged with carlin tags (carlin 1955). the ﬁsh resumed normal schooling release immediately behaviour after 491 nordeng and bratland year classes: table 1. life history stages of tagged salangen

time between tagging and recapture. two different homing experiments with both spe- cies were performed in the period of spring outward migration: 1 the ﬁsh were released upstream in the neigh- bouring river. thus, the supposed sequential imprint- ing to home river water was interrupted. instead the ﬁsh had an opportunity to fully imprint to the neighbouring river water as they moved on to the sea. 2 the ﬁsh were transferred to the neighbouring river system and kept for 3 days in a ﬁsh chest for possible single imprinting to local water before being released directly into the sea near løksa (both species) and ha˚kavika (only arctic char) (fig. 1). the ﬁsh chests, made of spruce wood, had been left submerged empty for 2 weeks before use. they were covered to exclude light. the ﬁsh were not allowed the opportunity to sequentially imprint either to the donor or the recipient river water. when in the sea (the salangen fjord) the ﬁsh from both experiments would be exposed to scents of the water from their river of origin and experience close contact with schools originating from their natal migratory system. char and trout were recaptured in fresh water and in the sea during ﬁve migratory seasons. tag returns from local ﬁshers were accompanied by scale sam- ples, information on length, ﬂesh colour and place and time of recapture. the tag returns were often supplemented with

ﬁsh captured were tagged, except those that were obviously anadr- omous or mature resident ﬁsh. brown_trout were classiﬁed as parr or smolt. the smolts were not fully smoltiﬁed, but were on the threshold of smolting with a trace of silvery gleam along the body ﬂank. in arctic char, however, it was impossible to distinguish parr from smolt by external characteristics. therefore all char tagged were preliminary classiﬁed as parr. final classiﬁcation was undertaken by comparison of scales secured during the tagging operation and during recaptures the following ﬁve seasons. based on comparison of scales it was possible to reconstruct the life history stages of the ﬁsh at tagging (table 1) and their life history after tagging (tables 3–6). scales were prepared and aged according to nordeng (1961), 492 homing in arctic char and brown_trout period june 12–20, and released in the upper part of lake røyrbakkvatnet (fig. 1). a few days after release, tagged salangen char were observed in the outlet area of the lake on outward migration together with native løksebotten arctic char and brown_trout. among the six smolts that were recaptured in the sea during the ﬁrst season (table 3), one was caught outside the estuary of the løksebotten river 10 days the release. the remaining ﬁve char were after recaptured in the fjord later in the season. to demonstrate the brief period needed for return to the natal river some time lags are given in days or weeks in the season of release. fifteen smolts and one parr were recaptured during upstream migration through the salangen estuary, 34 days after release in the løksebotten river system. two of the resident char were likewise recaptured in the salangen estuary, 36 and 48 days after release, the ﬁrst as still resident while the other had transformed into an anadromous char. however, four smolts were recaptured on upstream migration in the løksebotten river (august 10–17). a total of 66 char was recaptured in fresh water (table 3); of these 58 (87.9%) were recaptured in the salangen river and six (9.1%) in the løksebotten river. the recaptures were not randomly distributed between the two rivers (compare with table 2). recaptures of the 58 char returning to the salangen river system occurred along the entire watercourse: the estuary (16), nervatnet (22), øvervatnet (15) and the salangen river (5). single imprinting experiment salangen arctic char were transferred to the løkse- botten river system on june 23, and kept in ﬁsh chests in the outlet of lake røyrbakkvatnet for 3 days. the char were thereafter released directly into the sea near løksa and ha˚kavika (fig. 1). sea temperature was 11 °c and salinity was 20 ppt at the time of release. løksa is situated on the migratory route of

brown_trout. however, the arctic char transplant failed as all the char collected escaped prior to being tagged. the tagging experiments and the releases of the ﬁsh in a non-native river system were approved by the directorate for wildlife and freshwater fish (presently named directorate for nature management), trond- heim, norway. results general features upstream migration of tagged arctic char and brown_trout took place in company with native untagged ﬁsh. the tagged ﬁsh increased in length during their ﬁrst season, 3.5–4.5 cm for ﬁsh categorised as parr or resident, and 6–8 cm for ﬁsh categorised as anadrom- ous. in spite of marine food items in their stomachs, parr and resident ﬁsh still possessed white ﬂesh colouration and unchanged scale growth patterns. analysis of scales collected from the same individuals at tagging and recapture revealed that released parr returned to the natal river and smoltiﬁed during the following (second) season. some of the resident ﬁsh smoltiﬁed during the ﬁrst or second season. tagged ﬁsh were recaptured during both downstream and upstream migration. the distribution of the recaptures was signiﬁcantly different from a random distribution (table 2). release of salangen arctic char into the løksebotten river system sequential imprinting experiment salangen arctic char captured with beach seine in the lower part of nervatnet

brown_trout sampled in the outlet of lake røyrbakk- vatnet were transferred to the salangen river system and left in ﬁsh chests in the outlet of lake nervatnet for 3 days. thereafter they were released directly into the fjord near ha˚kavika (fig. 1). the salinity in the upper layer of the salangen fjord at this time of the year is about 26–27 ppt. after their release in the fjord near ha˚kavika, 19 trout of all categories (parr, resident and smolt) were recaptured within a period of 11 days (august 20–31) on upstream migration in their native løksebotten river system (table 6). this was 41 days after the release in ha˚kavika. twenty-three (95.8%) of these recaptures were made in the løksebotten river, and only one ﬁsh (4.2%) was recaptured in the salangen river system. the recaptures were signiﬁcantly differ- ent from random (table 2). the different categories of ﬁsh (parr, smolt, residents) may have kept together in the sea. instead of crossing the fjord (26–27 ppt salinity) to reach their native river they presumably have followed the shore in water with less salinity (measured at 10–15 ppt) (see fig. 1). previously, arctic char and brown_trout smolt tagged in this area ‘were recaptured annually in both the løksebotten and the salangen river systems indicating yearly mixing and subsequent separation in the sea’ (nordeng 1971). sequential versus single imprinting in both experiments almost all recaptures were made in the home river and not in the transplant river. the recapture rates did not differ among trout allowed to imprint singly or sequentially (v2 ¼ 0.60, d.f. ¼ 1, p > 0.1). discussion this study reveals that parr, resident and smolt of arctic char and brown_trout transplanted to neigh- bouring river and fjord sites return with high precision to their river of origin, independent of location, stream size, topography or body of water. the ﬁsh did not select a river randomly, and the homing precision was the same for ﬁsh allowed to receive either a single imprinting or sequential imprinting in the foreign river. in the foreign river, the ﬁsh (parr, resident and smolt) demonstrated spontaneous negative rheotactic beha- viour (movement downstream) without contact with home stream waters. from their speciﬁc positions in the sea, the released arctic char and brown_trout (parr, residents and smolt) orient towards respective rivers of origin, salangen and løksebotten. recaptures in all seasons took place at traditionally known rearing areas. thus, the salan- gen arctic char were recaptured along the entire river system (fig. 1): estuary (18), lake nervatnet (27), lake øvervatnet (7) – possibly indicating return to speciﬁc areas of origin of individual ﬁsh. previous tagging experiments on schooling pre-smolt arctic char in nervatnet, øver- vatnet and salangen river revealed annual returns exclusively to respective river sections. ‘none were recaptured in the løksebotten river, although large quantities of char descend and ascend both rivers during the same period’ (nordeng 1971). (21) and salangen river generally, juvenile salmonids demonstrate a posit- ive rheotaxis to odorants of their own population (movement upstream) and a negative rheotaxis in the absence of it (movement downstream) owing to the fact that fry can detect and discriminate odours already by the time of hatching (zielinski & hara 1988; hara 1989). fry and parr thus maintain association with their own population by appropriate positive or negative adjustments to population-speciﬁc odours 495 nordeng and bratland (frankel & gunn 1961; raleigh 1971; stabell 1982a,b; halvorsen & stabell 1990). sea in the the homing tendency after release upstream in løksebotten and salangen may indicate that lack of population-speciﬁc pheromones in running water evokes negative rheotactic behaviour, while their presence evokes positive rheotactic behaviour towards the natal population, in accordance with other salmonid species (frankel & gunn 1961; northcote 1969; raleigh 1971; brannon 1972; kaasa 1980; kelso et al. 1981; stabell 1982a,b; halvorsen & stabell 1990). attraction to population-speciﬁc olfac- tory substances is documented in salmon fry. also juvenile salmonids, arctic char included, and homing adults discriminate between and orient to pheromones (oshima et al. 1969; ho¨glund & a˚ strand 1973; selset & døving 1980; stabell 1982b, 1987; olse´n 1985, 1986, 1989; quinn & busack 1985; døving 1986; groot et al. 1986; quinn & hara 1986; quinn & tolson 1986; quinn & courtenay 1989; bertmar 1992, 1997; folke et al. 1992; courtenay et al. 1997). they can even discriminate among pheromones from full-sibling families within populations (olse´n 1985, 1989, 1992; quinn & busack 1985; quinn & hara 1986; quinn & courtenay 1989). discussing stock- speciﬁc pheromones as orientation cues in schools heading for their home river, larkin (1975) suggested that schools, as opposed to solitary ﬁsh, have greater navigational precision (larkin & walton 1969). previously døving et al. (1974) found that young arctic char of the lake øvervatnet population and the salangen river population discriminated odours of each other and other char populations, and that the skin mucous was a very potent olfactory stimulus (døving et al. 1973). thus, while reaching the sea (estuary) after displacement in the røyrbakkvatnet (fig. 1), the salangen char (parr, resident and smolt) will possess olfactory capacity to discriminate odours of each other and arctic char of løksebotten river. set out for home, the salangen arctic char may have integrated themselves into schools of migrating ﬁsh from their natal river or orienting home independently. smolt released in øvervatnet, the salangen river system (fig. 1), they also demonstrated spontaneous negative rheotactic behaviour without contact with home stream water. the smolt migrated downstream salangen waters, continuing through 12–13 km fjord water before reaching the estuary of the løksebotten river 9 days after the release in øvervatnet. all freshwater recaptures the løksebotten river (table 5). regarding the løksebotten brown_trout occurred in thus, the observed homing to the river of origin by parr, maturing residents and smolt of the year contra- dict both single and sequential olfactory imprinting to water of the river of release at these life history stages. 496 imprinting’ suggested sensitive periods for olfactory imprinting have been restricted to the period of smolt transfor- mation and seaward migration (stabell 1984, hasler & scholz 1983, carlin 1969). however, some authors in the ﬁeld needed ‘earlier to explain observed return migrations. early olfactory imprinting ought to occur ‘during hatching to swim-up stage of the larva, or even earlier’ or ‘during the incubation or emergence period’ (brannon 1972; horrall 1981; quinn et al. 1983; quinn 1990; quinn & dittman 1990; varnavskaya et al. 1994) – before the negative and positive rheotactic behaviour towards rearing lake. with respect to the ordinary proposed early imprint- ing, the salangen and løksebotten river systems are quite comparable to each other. they both arise in and ﬂow in parallel through the same geological formation and raised geological sediments. further, regular ﬂow erosion in raised deltas upstream upholds unary riverbeds downstream in the salangen river, lake øvervatnet and lake nervatnet. in spite of similar riverbeds, each section harbours speciﬁc populations of arctic char and partly brown_trout and atlantic salmon. thus, we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to imagine any form of olfactory imprinting for further speciﬁc return migra- tion, ‘early imprinting’ included. moreover, ‘odorants to which ﬁsh are supposed to imprint have not been classiﬁed chemically’ (stabell 1992) and no evidence has been provided regarding the nature of the natural substances supposedly used by ﬁsh for imprinting (stabell 1984; quinn & dittman 1990; bertmar 1997). the notion ‘early imprinting’ represents in fact the third phase of the ‘generally believed’ imprinting for the speciﬁc return migration: ﬁrstly, hasler & wisby (1951) introduced olfactory site imprinting for sub- sequent identiﬁcation (compare with long 1991, p. 88–91), secondly harden jones (1968) found the ﬁrst hypothesis insufﬁcient and developed a sequential olfactory hypothesis for homestream detection (p. 265–268, compare with long 1991, p. 91) and thirdly some authors in the ﬁeld needed ‘early imprinting’ to explain documented return migrations. in the sea, homeward orientation of is supposed to be ‘true navigation’ without any external aid. imprinted salmonids several transplantation experiments by juvenile salmonids support imprinting as the basic mechanism for homing orientation (reviewed in stabell 1992). upon return from the sea adults have generally returned to their site of release and not to the site (hatchery) of origin. in other experiments adults have returned to the hatchery where they were raised. where hatchery operations are conducted upon speci- ﬁc broodstock of paciﬁc salmon, stabilised hatchery migratory systems occur with total or nearly total homing (donaldson & allen 1957; quinn & fresh 1984; quinn & tolson 1986; mcisaac & quinn 1988; quinn 1991; hard & heard 1999). however, a single cohort or year-class of, e.g., juvenile coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutsch will possess genetic capacity to establish all components of the population when released. this was caused by their mode of producing smolt successively at different parr ages (0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+) thus colonising new environments in nature or hatchery of release (com- pare with smolt releases by successive parr age in figs 2 and 3). acknowledgements we thank john g. ormerod, atle mysterud, geir holm and jon
