the use of habitat patches by brown_trout, salmo_trutta, during summer conditions in a plains stream in the western united states. a global positioning system was used to map discrete habitat patches (2–420 m2) consisting of macrophytes, wood accumulation, or deep water. habitat use by brown_trout was monitored by radio telemetry. brown_trout used habitat in a nonrandom manner with 99% of all daytime observations and 91% of all nighttime observations occurring in patches that consisted of combinations of deep water, wood accumulations or macrophytes even though such patches constituted only 9.8% of the available habitat. brown_trout used deep water almost exclusively during the day but broadened their habitat use at night. most ﬁsh stayed within a large plunge pool created by a low-head dam. this pool supplemented the deep-water habitat that was naturally rare in our study area and illustrates how human modiﬁcations can sometimes create habitat patches important for stream ﬁshes. key words: habitat; patch; brown_trout; radio telemetry; rare habitats f. j. rahel, department of zoology and physiology, department 3166, 1000 e. university ave, university of wyoming, laramie, wyoming 82071, usa; e-mail: frahel@uwyo.edu accepted for publication march 16, 2009 introduction there is growing interest in examining the distribution of aquatic organisms from a landscape perspective that emphasizes the patchiness of stream habitats (fausch et al. 2002; le pinchon et al. 2006). a patch is a discrete area with a set of characteristics that are important to the organism under study. determining the characteristics of patches used by various species is critical for managing and conserving stream ﬁshes. imperiled blue shiners, cyprinella for example, caerulea, were seldom found outside of pool habitats in a southeastern united states stream (johnston 2000). pirate perch, aphredoderus sayanus, were highly associated with areas of wood accumulations in headwater coastal streams in louisiana (monzyk et al. 1997). sometimes patches can be important at certain time periods or for certain life history stages. juvenile coho salmon, oncorhynchus_kisutch, in coastal oregon streams overwinter in pools or side channels with large woody debris and enhancing such increases the production of coho smolts habitat (solazzi et al. 2000). speciﬁc habitat patches needed during certain times of the year or by certain life history stages can be rare within the landscape and thus have a large inﬂuence on the local persistence of populations (fausch et al. 2002). for example, relatively rare groundwater-fed pools that did not freeze in winter were critical for the persistence of arkansas darter, etheostoma cragini, in an intermittent colorado plains stream (labbe & fausch 2000). spawning habitat for cutthroat trout, oncorhynchus_clarkii, in a large montana river basin was mainly present within two headwater tributary reaches that contained gravel substrates appropriate for redd construction (magee et al. 1996). brown_trout, salmo_trutta, tend to be highly associated with features that provide cover in streams such as deep pools, wood, or undercut banks (clapp et al. 1990; meyers et al. 1992). in plains streams, wood input is limited and channels tend to consist of long runs with shifting sand substrates (rahel & doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00364.x 473 o’connor & rahel hubert 1991). consequently, habitats favored by brown_trout such as deep pools or wood accumulations tend to be scarce and, when present, exist as relatively discrete patches surrounded by unsuitable habitat. this suggests that a patch perspective might be a useful way to characterize brown_trout habitat in such systems. we examined habitat patchiness and habitat use by brown_trout in the laramie river, a high plains stream in southeastern wyoming, usa. our objectives were to (i) map the distribution of habitat patches within a river segment; (ii) quantify the use of these patches by brown_trout and determine preferred patch types; and (iii) compare day versus night use of habitat patches. methods study area the study area was a 2.0 km segment of the laramie river, a 5th–order tributary of the north platte river in southeastern wyoming (fig. 1). a water diversion dam about 1 m tall marked the upstream end of the study reach and inhibited upstream movement by ﬁsh during low streamﬂow conditions in the summer. no other ﬁsh movement barriers were present in the study segment. most of the river consisted of relatively homoge- nous substrates of cobble, gravel, and sand with little structural cover in the water column. a small propor- tion of the river consisted of discrete patches of aquatic macrophytes, wood accumulations, or deep water (>1 m deep). macrophytes, primarily common water milfoil (myriophyllum exalbescens) and mare’s tail (hippuris vulgaris), were present as distinct beds, typically adjacent to the stream bank. large wood in the form of logs, root wads, overhanging branches, or aggregations of these, were present in the stream channel. macrophyte beds and wood were usually separated by areas of open water making it possible to delineate discrete patches of ﬁsh habitat. deep water (>1 m in depth) was infrequent in the study area. daily mean streamﬂow during the study period was about )1, which is typical for the laramie river in late 2 m3 s summer. stream temperatures were taken several times during each tracking period with a handheld ther- mometer at the upstream end of the study area. temperatures ranged from daytime highs of 15–22 °c and nighttime lows of 13–19 °c with diel temperature ranges of about 3 °c. mapping habitat patches we used a global positioning system (trimble pathﬁnder pro xrs gps receiver) to map the location of stream banks and habitat patches in the laramie 474 fig. 1. habitat patches in a 450 m reach of the laramie river downstream of a low-head dam used to divert water for irrigation. the study reach was 15 km southwest of laramie, wyoming. utm coordinates at the study reach were 439569.8 e and 4563844.0 n (zone 13n, nad27) all transmitter- implanted ﬁsh were located within this reach during the course of the study. the downstream end of river during baseﬂow conditions from july 22 to 28, 2004. we deﬁned six patch types or combinations of patch types: deep water (>1 m depth), deep water- macrophyte, deep water-wood, macrophyte outside of deep water (macrophyte), wood outside of deep water (wood), and open water. although open water can be viewed as the background matrix from a landscape ecology perspective, we considered it a type of habitat patch in order to facilitate the analysis of habitat selection. the minimum size threshold used to deﬁne a patch was 2 m2 which was the smallest area that could be reliably mapped using the global positioning system. we mapped the wetted channel by walking the bank and taking a point measurement of 5 vertices every 2 m, unless more points were needed to accurately capture detail. polygons that delineated a habitat patch were mapped by wading in the stream and taking point measurements of 10 vertices every 0.5 m along the perimeter of the patch, unless more points were necessary to trace the detail of the patch. we used a vertex averaging method to improve the accuracy of our maps. vertex averaging collects a point position once per second and averages them to approximate the true location (dauwalter et al. 2006). spatial data were differentially corrected using u.s. geological survey base station data to ± 0.5 m with 5 vertices per point and ± 0.4 m with 10 vertices per point at 68% precision (gps pathﬁnder ofﬁce 2.90, trimble nav- igation ltd., sunnyvale, ca, usa). mapping data were converted to shape ﬁles using gps pathﬁnder ofﬁce 2.90. maps were created using arcgis version 8.1 (esri, environmental systems research institute, inc., redlands, ca, usa). fish collection (‡250 mm total adult brown_trout length) were captured by electroﬁshing or angling within the study segment between july 30 and august 9, 2004. fish were anesthetized and surgically implanted with a radio transmitter (1.7 g, advanced telemetry sys- tems) using the shielded needle technique. all ﬁsh weights allowed for meeting the 2% body weight guideline suggested by winter (1983). after recovery from anesthesia, ﬁsh were placed into a covered ﬂow- through holding cart set in the river for 30–60 min prior to release at their location of capture. habitat use by brown_trout brown_trout were located during seven daytime periods (august 10, 13, 16, 24, 25, 26, 29) and seven nighttime periods (august 11, 14, 17, 24, 25, 27, 29) in 2004. for both time periods, tracking began at the upstream end of the study site. we slowly walked the bank in a downstream direction until all ﬁsh were located. fish were located using an ats model r2000 (advanced telemetry systems, isanti, mn, usa) radio receiver and yagi directional antenna. the transmitter number, time, and location of each ﬁsh within the stream (inside or outside of a previously mapped patch) were recorded on a ﬁeld map showing the locations of the habitat patches that had been previously mapped as described above. fish locations also were recorded with a handheld gps unit (garmin vista). after locating the farthest downstream ﬁsh, we paused for 30 min then walked along the bank upstream and relocated all transmitter-implanted ﬁsh. this protocol was repeated twice more so that a total of six passes of the study area were completed. daytime tracking was done between 1000 and 1600 h. on august 24 and 25, 2004, only two locations for each ﬁsh were documented beginning at approximately 1100 h. overall, each ﬁsh was located a total of 34 times over the seven daytime periods. the large size of the ﬁsh being tracked, the high water clarity at baseﬂow conditions, and the relatively discrete delineation of habitat patches allowed us to locate ﬁsh relative to the location of habitat patches during the day. the timbre of the signal patch use by brown_trout broadcast from the receiver changed noticeably when the range to the transmitter became small (<3 m) and the antenna was pointed directly at the transmitter (a percussive ‘‘snap’’ replaced the beeping sound). once near the ﬁsh, we could determine whether it was within a patch of habitat (i.e., wood, deep water, or macrophyte patch) or located in open water. fish located in cover never spooked when we approached, allowing us to move close to verify their location. on occasions when a ﬁsh was using open water, visual identiﬁcation of the ﬁsh was possible. on two occasions ﬁsh in open water were disturbed. in these instances, the ﬁsh moved to the closest cover, usually <5 m from their original position. one ﬁsh returned to open water before the next observation and one ﬁsh stayed in cover. nighttime tracking was done between 2200 and 0400 h. on august 24 and 25, 2004, only two locations for each ﬁsh were documented beginning at approximately 2300 h. overall, each ﬁsh was located a total of 34 times over the seven nighttime periods. at night, we relied on the sound from the transmitter to discern the location of the ﬁsh. although it was more difﬁcult to see ﬁsh at night, it was easier to approach without disturbing them. on the last obser- vation of a tracking period, we used a ﬂashlight to spot the ﬁsh and verify its location. when we were unsure of a ﬁsh’s location, we would wade into the river downstream of the ﬁsh and approach slowly without any lights on (to avoid spooking the ﬁsh). we approached the ﬁsh until we were close enough to determine if it was using a habitat patch or open water based on the sound from the receiver which changed when the antenna was pointed directly at the ﬁsh. analysis of patch selection one of the challenges in resource selection studies is deﬁning the geographic extent for calculating resource (i.e., patch) availability (manly et al. 2002). we opted to calculate patch availability only for the portion of the laramie river occupied by our study organisms. although brown_trout could have moved throughout the 2 km study area, all observations of transmitter- implanted ﬁsh occurred within a 450 m reach down- stream from the low-head dam that diverted water for irrigation. therefore, we quantiﬁed patch availability within this reach because it included the home range of all 12 brown_trout during our period of study. using a gis, we calculated the proportional availability of each patch type in the 450 m reach downstream as the sum of the areas of all patches of that type divided by the total area of the reach. selection ratio analysis was used to compare the magnitude of habitat type selectivity during day and night observations (manly et al. 2002). the selection 475 o’connor & rahel ratio is the proportional use of a habitat type divided by the proportional availability of that habitat type. values can range from 0 to inﬁnity with values near 1 indicating no evidence of selection. values >1 repre- sent evidence of selection for a habitat type and values <1 show evidence of selection against a habitat type. proportional patch use for each brown_trout was calculated by dividing the number of observations of that ﬁsh in each habitat patch type by the total number of observations for that ﬁsh (n = 34 for all ﬁsh). selection ratios for each patch type were calculated by dividing the proportional patch use by the proportional patch availability for each ﬁsh. an average selection ratio for each habitat patch type was then calculated by averaging the values across all ﬁsh. conﬁdence intervals for the selection ratios were calculated based on the bonferroni method whereby a = 0.05 was divided by n)1 habitat patch types (n = 6) to give a more conservative a = 0.01. thus, we calculated 99% conﬁdence intervals and determined whether selection ratios for given patch types were below 1 (indicating selection against a patch type) or above 1 (indicating selection for a patch type). results distribution of habitat patches most of the laramie river was sand ⁄ gravel substrate in open water habitat, with macrophyte, wood and deep water patches collectively constituting only 14.2% of the stream area in the 450 m reach where brown_trout were located (table 1). the most common patch type was deep water at 8.4% of the stream area but this mainly occurred as a large plunge pool (420.2 m2) immediately below the water diversion structure (fig. 2). there was a single deep water-macrophyte patch (12.5 m2) that constituted 0.3% of the stream area and which was located fig. 2. a comparison of day versus night habitat use by brown_trout in the laramie river, wyoming. patch types are deep water, deep water-wood (d-w), deep water-macrophytes (d-m), and open water habitat (open). adjacent to the large plunge pool below the water diversion structure. deep water-wood patches consti- tuted 1.1% of the total area and ranged from 3.2 to 36.6 m2. macrophyte patches constituted 3.8% of the total area of the study reach and ranged in size from 2.0 to 45.0 m2. wood patches constituted 0.6% of the stream area in the study reach and ranged in size from 5.8 to 17.6 m2. distribution of large brown_trout large brown_trout were highly concentrated in the deep plunge pool downstream of the low-head dam. despite extensive electroﬁshing of the 2-km stream collected only three brown_trout segment, we ‡250 mm total length outside of this pool. these three ﬁsh were captured in wood accumulations in deep water. the other nine brown_trout were captured by electroﬁshing or angling within the plunge pool. mean total length of the brown_trout was 389 mm (sd = 121 mm). table 1. habitat use and habitat selection ratios for day and night habitat patch use by brown_trout in the laramie river. selection ratios

vicinity of the plunge pool (deep water patch) formed by the low-head dam that marked the upstream end of the study area (fig. 1). these ﬁsh were always located in the deepest part of the pool (approximately 2.5 m deep) during the day (table 2). at night, however, these ﬁsh often moved to areas near the perimeter of the pool where they utilized macrophyte patches or open water along the bank (table 2). on several occasions, we observed brown_trout feeding on young white suckers, catostomus commersonii, at night in these shallow habitats. the other three ﬁsh (ﬁsh 10, 11, and 12) also spent much of the day and night in the plunge pool formed by the low-head dam but occasionally traveled down- stream, usually at night. for example, ﬁsh 11 was always located within the diversion pool from aug 10–16 but nighttime observations included deep water-macrophyte, deep water-wood, or open water patches (table 2). this ﬁsh moved approximately 250 m downstream during the night of august 24 where it was observed in open water. it subsequently moved upstream to occupy a deep water-wood patch from august 25 to 27, before moving to a location 450 m downstream of the diversion structure on the night of august 29 where it was observed in open water and in a deep water-wood patch. habitat patch selection brown_trout were highly selective in their use of habitat and habitat use differed between day and night (table 2). during the day, brown_trout used almost exclusively the deep water patch associated with the patch use by brown_trout low-head dam (fig. 2). selectivity analysis indicated strong selection for deep water (selection ratio > 1) and strong avoidance of open water habitat during the day (selection ratio < 1) (table 1). at night, brown_trout broadened their habitat use (fig. 2). although ﬁsh still spent much of their time in the deep water patch associated with the low-head dam, they also spent time in deep water-macrophyte and deep water- wood patches as well as in open water (fig. 2). selectivity analysis again indicated strong selection for deep water and strong avoidance of open water habitat during the night (table 1). there was a trend for increased selection for deep water-macrophyte and deep water-wood patches but the 99% conﬁdence intervals of the selection ratios included one. the patch types used by brown_trout, (deep water, deep water-macrophtye, and deep water-wood), constituted only 9.8% of the available habitat (table 1). discussion brown_trout used habitat in a nonrandom manner in the laramie river. most of the study site consisted of shallow water with open substrates that offered little protection from predators such as great blue herons, ardea herodias, or mink, mustela vison. refuge from predators existed as relatively discrete patches of habitat associated with deep pools, some of which also contained wood accumulations or macrophytes. brown_trout showed strong selection for such patches. we only assessed habitat use by brown_trout during the summer in a single year. however, our results are consistent with other studies that report a strong association of large brown_trout in summer with cover in the form of structures (clapp et al. 1990), pools or undercut banks (meyers et al. 1992), or deep water table 2. habitat use by 12 brown_trout in the laramie river, wyoming. the proportion of

space availability for large brown_trout and that self-thinning coefﬁcients for such trout declined at sites with the greatest mean water depth. it is common for riverine brown_trout to display little daytime movement during the summer (burrell et al. 2000; diana et al. 2004). this is consistent with the behavior of brown_trout in our study where ﬁsh were located almost exclusively in the plunge pool created by the irrigation diversion dam (deep water patch) and rarely moved among habitat patches during the day. by contrast, brown_trout were more active at night and most ﬁsh broadened their habitat use by moving into macrophyte beds or wood accumulations that were in deep water. however, most of the ﬁsh returned to the deep plunge pool to spend the day. young (1995, 1999) also found that adult brown_trout in several rocky mountain streams moved among foraging sites during the night but typically returned to the same resting site each morning and were relatively inactive during the day. a similar pattern was reported for large brown_trout (>400 mm total length) in a michigan stream (clapp et al. 1990). we observed that brown_trout avoided open water areas in the laramie river even at night, a ﬁnding consistent with the behavior of this species in the rio grande river of colorado (shuler et al. 1994). the nocturnal activity of large brown_trout appears to reﬂect a tendency for these ﬁsh to be piscivorous (clapp et al. 1990). we examined habitat use by large brown_trout in the summer and it is likely that the types of habitat patches important to brown_trout will vary seasonally. although we did not monitor habitat use during winter, the plunge pool below the diversion dam is likely to provide the deep water, slow current habitat important for trout in winter (meyers et al. 1992). our observations indicate that within our study area, brown_trout spawn in patches of rifﬂes containing small gravel. such patches are of obvious importance for persistence of the brown_trout population but are used for only a few weeks each autumn. although we did not quantify habitat use by small brown_trout, our observations indicate that young ﬁsh were generally found in shallow water habitats, a ﬁnding reported elsewhere (heggenes 1996). traditional aquatic habitat features (e.g., depth, current velocity, substrate type) that are measured along transects summarize habitat conditions at the reach scale (rahel & hubert 1991; bain & stevenson 1999). however, average values of a suite of habitat metrics do little to illuminate where the best ﬁsh habitat exists within the reach (fausch et al. 2002). additionally, it is often a combination of features that provides important habitat for ﬁshes (young 1995; quist et al. 2006). for instance, brown_trout in a 478 michigan stream used a combination of deep water with log cover (clapp et al. 1990). similarly, in the laramie river wood accumulations or macrophyte beds were not used by brown_trout unless these features were in relatively deep water (>1 m). in addition to brown_trout, creek chubs, semotilus atromaculatus, are also highly associated with discrete habitat patches in the laramie river. belica & rahel (2008) reported that 79% of 245 creek chubs captured in a segment of the river that overlapped our study site were collected within wood or aquatic macrophyte patches that constituted only 15% of the channel area. in a michigan stream, brown_trout were highly associated with cover provided by logs, even though such cover constituted only about 20% of the available habitat (clapp et al. 1990). other examples of stream ﬁsh using relatively discrete habitat patches include the association of pirate perch, a. sayanus, with wood accumulations (monzyk et al. 1997), the use of cold groundwater seeps by trout during summer (ebersole et al. 2003), and the association of some tropical stream ﬁshes with rocky patches (arrington et al. 2005). sometimes critical habitat patches are deter- mined by biological characteristics. for example, the endangered oregon chub, oregonichthys crameri, is associated with off-channel habitats in the willamette river but only if lack nonnative predatory ﬁsh species (scheerer 2002). such habitats for in many cases, the occurrence of a species may depend on relatively rare or unique habitats (burr et al. 2001; magoulick & kobza 2003). the large plunge pool below the irrigation diversion dam at the upstream end of the study area appears to be such a habitat for brown_trout in the laramie river. this single pool constituted only about 7% of the study area but accounted for 95% of all day time and 69% of all night time observations of brown_trout during the telemetry study. also, 9 of the 12 ﬁsh that we were able to collect implantation with radio transmitters were captured from this pool despite extensive efforts to collect trout throughout the 2 km segment of the river. the pool was the largest and deepest in the study segment with a maximum depth of 2.5 m and an area where water depth was ‡1 m depth of 420 m2. the pool was not thermally stratiﬁed and thus was not likely providing a thermal refuge for brown_trout, especially since water tem- peratures throughout the study remained below those to brown_trout (>24 °c; maccrimmon & stressful marshall 1968). rather, the pool likely served as a refuge from predators. the pool was adjacent to a bed of macrophytes that harbored an abundance of small ﬁshes, especially young white suckers. on several occasions, brown_trout were observed feeding on these ﬁshes at night along the periphery of the pool. the large plunge pool used by brown_trout in the laramie river is an artiﬁcial habitat. similarly, the european bullhead, cottus critical habitat for gobia, in a regulated river in belgium was provided by patches of artiﬁcial stones added to strengthen bridge abutments (knaepkens et al. 2002). bunt et al. found that greenside darters, etheostoma (1998) blennioides, a species of conservation concern, used rare rifﬂe habitats formed by high discharge below a ﬁsh weir in some reliance on human-created habitats circumstances, may prove useful in controlling invasive species. introduced brown_trout can decimate populations of native ﬁshes results suggest that efforts to control brown_trout populations in small streams should target the rare, deep-water areas. in regulated streams, such areas are often associated with pools created by water diversion structures offering an opportunity to reduce highly preferred and artiﬁcial habitat. in the grand river, ontario. (townsend 1996), and our many species of stream ﬁsh use relatively discrete habitat types such as pools, rifﬂes, or wood accumu- lations that exist as patches in a matrix of largely unsuitable habitat (johnston 2000; belica & rahel 2008). for these species, a patch perspective is a useful way of characterizing habitat use (le pinchon et al. 2006). as stream ﬁsh ecology moves toward a riverscape perspective, it will become increasingly important to identify the patch characteristics neces- sary for the survival of various ﬁsh species. some- times, important patches may be the result of human activities, such as the large plunge pool that supple- mented the naturally rare, deep-water habitat in our study stream. acknowledgements k. chitty, k. driese, and e. kempema assisted with this research. r. o. hall, jr., d.c. dauwalter, e.s. hansen and three anonymous reviewers provided comments on the manuscript. k. g. gerow provided guidance with statistical analyses. financial support was provided by the vern bressler fisheries scholarship and the plummer trust. we thank the bath, lentz, and mears families for allowing access to the study site. references arrington, d.a., winemiller, k.o. & layman, c.a. 2005. community assembly at the patch scale in a species rich tropical river. oecologia 144: 157–167. bain, m.b. & stevenson, n.j.
