ammocoetes were collected and observed in the laboratory. burrowing movements of ammocoetes placed in an aquarium with sediments of differing grain size were video recorded. the video was reviewed and, for each larva, the total time spent moving, the number of stops during the burrowing movement, the total time spent stopped and total time elapsed until complete withdrawal below the substrate surface was registered. smaller ammocoetes had lower burrowing performance than larger individuals, across all substrate types, but the differences were greater in coarser substrates. additionally, coarser sediment particles increased the time spent on burrowing regardless of larval size. b. r. quintella1, n. o. andrade1, n. m. dias1, p. r. almeida1,2 1institute of oceanography, faculty of

introduction this sea lamprey (petromyzon marinus l.) larval life is estimated to last 4 years (quintella et al. 2003), but the landlocked form can last as little as 2 years (morkert et al. 1998) or for more than 10 years (manion & smith 1978). during this period, ammo- coetes inhabit burrows within the soft sediments of streams (hardisty & potter 1971; almeida & quintella 2002). throughout stage, ammocoetes ﬁlter plankton, organic detritus and bacteria at the sedi- ment–water interface (moore & beamish 1973; moore & mallat 1980; sutton & bowen 1994). an appro- priate substrate is critical for ammocoetes, whose survival depends on a permanent unidirectional water ﬂow, to supply them with the proper nutrients, while promoting the exchange of respiratory gases and metabolic residues (hardisty & potter 1971). sediment particle size and permeability constrain substrate suitability and are a key determinant for habitat selection (morman et al. 1980; potter 1980; lee 1989; young et al. 1990a; ojutkangas et al. 1995; beamish & lowartz 1996; almeida & quintella 2002). therefore, ammocoetes are usually found in ﬁne sandy or silty banks where there is a minor percentage of gravel and clay and frequently contain undecomposed organic detritus like twigs and leaves (applegate 1950; kainua & valtonen 1980; young et al. 1990a,b). such deposits are usually located in backwaters, eddies, sloughs or along the inside of bends in the river where deposition of sand, silt and detritus occurs (applegate 1950; kainua & valtonen 1980). the most characteristic behavioural pattern of the ammocoete is the burrowing response, initiated by whip-like contractions of the tail, forcing the head vertically downwards into the substrate until the branchial region is covered, after which the tail is laid horizontally over the surface (hardisty & potter 1971). final submergence is achieved by contractions of the more anterior trunk regions using the expanded oral hood as an anchor below the surface, literally pulling the tail region into the substrate (hardisty 1979). the depth of the burrow depends on the nature of the substrate and on the size of the ammocoete, varying from less than 13 mm for individuals of 20 mm body length to 150 mm in ammocoetes of over 100 mm (applegate 1950). there seems to be some distinc- tiveness in the preferred particle size of the burrowing areas of different sizes of p. marinus ammocoetes, doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00209.x 177 quintella et al. larger individuals preferred coarser substrates while smaller ones are usually associated with ﬁne sediments (almeida & quintella 2002). sea lamprey is listed under annex ii of the european union habitats directive because of the increasing threat to the survival of european popula- tions (lelek 1987). in portugal, it is classiﬁed in the red list of threatened species as ‘vulnerable’ (rogado et al. 2005). besides overﬁshing, habitat destruction resulting from dam construction, dredging, gravel extraction, channelisation and pollution have contributed to the decline of the sea lamprey popula- tions in portuguese river basins. mapping the stretches of the river, which have the potential to be used for ammocoete breeding grounds, is possibly the most effective measure of conservation to be adopted to protect lamprey species. the suitability of the substrate for the burrowing activities might be, in this context, important information to deﬁne the special areas of conservation in each river basin. the larval phase of the purpose of the present study was to assess in the laboratory the effect of the substrate grain size composition on the burrowing behaviour and per- formance of the sea lamprey ammocoetes. such data can be important to complement the existing know- ledge of lampreys’ larvae habitat selection by present- ing information about the physical suitability of different types of substrate to ammocoetes of distinct sizes. materials and methods one hundred and twenty sea lamprey ammocoetes were electroﬁshed from the river mondego (portugal) and kept in an indoor holding tank (0.4 m3 capacity), for the 2-month duration of the experiment. the animals were fed with a suspension of brewer’s yeast )1 body weight) supplied three times a (c. 0.16 gæg week (murdoch et al. 1991). observations were made in a 67 · 67 · 67 cm3 aquarium (0.3 m3) containing 18 cm of substrate. the four substrate types tested and their particle sizes sand (0.25 mm £ 0.49 mm), medium were: ﬁne sand (0.5 mm £ 0.99 mm), coarse sand (1.0 mm £ 1.99 mm) and gravel (2.0 mm £ 0.39 mm). the sedi- ment used in the experiment was collected in a stream and sieved to the desired grain sizes. a smaller 30 · 30 · 30 cm3 transparent acrylic cube with no bottom or top was placed on the top of the sediment and centred in the aquarium. during tests, ammocoetes were placed inside the smaller structure. the 18 cm substrate depth and the space between the aqua- rium and the acrylic structure ensured that burro- wing ammocoetes could not touch the aquarium completely withdrawn walls they were until 178 below the substrate surface, regardless of burrowing direction. ammocoetes were measured to the nearest milli- metre (tl) and grouped into six, 20 mm length- classes: 60–80, 81–100, 101–120, 121–140, 141–160 and 161–180 mm. twenty ammocoetes of each class were then released one by one in the experimental aquarium. ammocoetes rested for 7 min in a dark chamber before moving passively through an opaque tube (inner diameter of 1.5 cm), with the head pointing downwards, into the centre of the acrylic chamber. by using this method, it was guaranteed that each larva reached the experimental area, always with the same body position. the complete procedure was video recorded. it had been assumed that each sequence began after the ﬁrst contact of the ammocoetes with the substrate, and ended when it had completely withdrawn below the substrate. after all individuals in a group were tested, they were returned to the main holding tank for about 1 week before being tested with a new sediment type. data was analysed considering the following var- iables: movement time (mt), the number of seconds from ﬁrst contact with the substrate to complete burrowing that an ammocoete was moving; number of stops (nstop), the number of times that an ammocoete stopped during the burrowing movement; total stop- ping time (tstopt), the sum of the different stop periods measured to the nearest second; total time (tt), the total time (±1 s) spent by each larva since its ﬁrst contact with the sediment until the complete with- drawal of the ammocoete below the substrate surface. trials where the ammocoetes revealed signs of exhausting, resting motionless on the surface of the sediment, was excluded from further analysis. the unsuccessful test was repeated by a different specimen belonging to the same length-class. an analysis of variance was applied to the log- transformed data to test for differences in each of the four measures of burrowing performance (mt, nstop, tstopt and tt) among the six larval length-classes within each substrate type and among the four substrate types within each length-class. a posteriori comparisons were used to test signiﬁcant differences among all possible pairs of means (sokal & rohlf 1995). ss-stp test was used when equal variance was assumed and tamhane’s t2 when moderate hetero- geneity of variances was detected. statistical methods were applied using the spss 11.0. results ammocoetes burrowing performance varied signiﬁ- cantly among size classes within each of the substrates types (anova; table 1). most of the 16 anovas (four performance measures · four substrate types)

0.05) and only in the two coarsest substrates (coarse sand and gravel). the smaller size classes of ammocoetes stopped more often, and for a longer period, regardless of substrate type (table 1). consequently, time to complete the burrowing process, and overall burrow- ing performance of smaller ammocoetes was signiﬁ- cantly lower, independent of substrate type (table 1). however, the differences are more marked in the coarser substrate types, where larger ammocoetes are clearly more capable at burrowing, and less pro- nounced in the ﬁner substrates (table 1). furthermore, the pattern of an increased total time to become completely burrowed with either larval size or particle size is due mainly to the time stopped and not to the time spent moving. ammocoetes need to rest for longer periods when burrowing on coarser substrates. larval burrowing performance varied also signiﬁ- cantly among substrate types within each size class tested as indicated by the 24 anova tests (four performance measures · six size classes; table 2). only the variable tstopt did not differ signiﬁcantly (p > 0.05) the animals with 121–140 mm of length, apparently for this size class the total time spent stopped did not differ with the substrate type. coarser substrates are responsible for a larger interval time spent by the ammocoetes in the burrowing process regardless of their dimension (table 2). the for ammocoetes stopped more often and for longer periods of time as the substrate particle size increased. as the ammocoetes dimension increased, both the time spent in burrowing themselves as the number of stops they had to make during the process decreased accordingly. once again, larger individuals showed higher physical capabilities to burrow themselves. in general, ammocoetes took on average 417 s to burrow themselves, of which 52% of the time is used to rest. they stop on average 2.3 times, and only 3% (#14) of the larger ammocoetes (>150 mm) were able to complete the movement without any stops, when using the ﬁner substrates (ﬁne and medium sand). the best burrowing performance was recorded with larger ammocoetes when using the smaller grained sediments (ﬁne sand; tables 1 and 2). the shortest average mt (64 s) and tstopt (29 s) was accomplished by the ammocoetes belonging to the size class 161–180 mm when burrowing on the ﬁne sand substrate. larger ammocoetes only needed on average 94 s (tt) to completely withdraw below the ﬁnest substrate (ﬁne sand) surface, and stopped (nstop) on average 0.7 times during the process. conversely, the ammocoetes that moved for a longer period of time (mt ¼ 316 s) belonged to the smaller size class (61–80 mm), when trying to bury themselves in the coarser sediment (gravel). curiously, the highest nstops (ﬁve times) and tstopt (721 s) was observed with animals belonging to the second smallest size class (81–100 mm) in gravel substrate, implying on average more time to bury 179 quintella et al. table 2. univariate comparisons to test for differences in the performances of ammocoetes belonging to the same length-class when burrowing in substrates with different

smallest individuals (61–80 mm, tt ¼ 798 s). discussion sediment particle size has a major role concerning the ammocoetes’ burrowing behaviour and preference (kainua & valtonen 1980; morman et al. 1980; potter 1980; lee 1989; ojutkangas et al. 1995; beamish & lowartz 1996; almeida & quintella 2002; jellyman & glova 2002). ammocoetes have a particular way to bury themselves: ﬁrst, enters the head to some extent, leaving a few of their gill pores out of the sediment; next, follows the trunk; ﬁnally, goes the tail. usually, this action takes a few seconds to a few minutes to be accomplished and implies normally two stops during the process. they rarely perform this procedure in a single movement, the number of stops depending of the substrate particle size. larger individuals show a higher burrowing capacity or performance and, so, can more easily bury themselves across all substrate types. moreover, bigger ammocoetes also stop the burrowing movement fewer times and for shorter intervals than 180 the smaller ones. furthermore, it was also observed that for the two smaller classes, this process was inversed when the animals were trying to bury themselves on the coarser sediment. this particular situation might be because of other factors like particle density, compaction or cohesion between these coarser sediments, which in turn, could eventually, facilitate the burrowing movements of the smaller animals. even ﬁsh such as the juvenile plaice, pleuronectes platessa l., show a similar relationship between sediment grain size and the extent to which individuals can bury themselves. the relationship presumably depends upon the force that individuals can exert during the burrowing process. larger ﬁsh can produce greater forces and can therefore bury in coarser sediments (gibson & robb 1992). nevertheless, as the sediment becomes coarser, all the ammocoetes gradually show increased difﬁculties to carry out this very same action, which is probably because of fatigue. although ammocoetes spend most of their time burrowed, they are adept at performing and recovering from vigorous anaerobic exercise. such attributes could be important when these animals are vigorously swimming or burrowing as they evade predators or forage (wilkie et al. 2001). ammocoetes sea lamprey ammocoete distribution is strongly dependent upon sediment characteristics, smaller individuals rather choose substrata mainly composed of smaller particles, while bigger individuals prefer coarser ones (almeida & quintella 2002). similar result were obtained for the ammocoetes of lethenter- on reissneri where the substrate particle size seems to be more limiting or conditioning on small-sized (<5 cm) than in larger-sized (>5 cm) ones, which may occupy wider ranges of particle sizes (sugiyama & goto 2002). this size segregation for habitats has also been revealed in geotria australis in new zealand streams (kelso & todd 1993). in their natural habitat and in a more or less stable scenario, ammocoetes often show some degree of mobility, moving from one place to another whenever the conditions become lesser favourable for them (quintella et al. 2005). according to our experiments, larger ammocoetes can burrow more easily than smaller ones, across all substrate types, but they would naturally choose coarser substrates because it takes longer to bury, increasing the vulnerability to preda- tion, and it is also more energetically demanding. larger ammocoetes may choose to live on habitats with coarser substrates as a strategy to avoid high densities in the areas colonised by the younger individuals, and therefore, reduce intraspeciﬁc com- petition for space and food (almeida & quintella 2002). is unlikely that individuals rather it north american streams are selected for lampricide treatment based primarily on a quantitative assessment sampling method that estimates the annual potential production of metamorphosed sea lampreys (slade et al. 2003). a larval habitat is classiﬁed into three strata based on observations by applegate (1950). the three strata (types i, ii and iii) are qualitatively deﬁned based on substrate. type i habitat consists primarily of a mixture of sand and ﬁne organic matter, type ii of shifting sand that may contain some gravel, and in type iii ammocoetes are unable to burrow into it (slade et al. 2003). filter-feeding ammocoetes prefer type i habitat, while type ii is utilised by some ammocoetes for burrowing, but it is inhabited at much lower densities. ammocoete abundance in this method is estimated as the product of density (adjusted for gear efﬁciency) and the total equivalent type i habitat area. abundance of ammocoetes for each 1-mm length increment their proportion in the length–frequency distribution of the sampled population (captured preferentially at type i habitats) and the estimate of abundance for the entire stream. this result in the ﬁnal size structure of the estimated larval population, but the estimate of the is calculated as the product of sea lamprey larvae burrowing performance proportion of ammocoetes of a speciﬁed size that will transform the following year might be biased. larger ammocoetes are found in coarser substrates (kelso & todd 1993; almeida & quintella 2002; sugiyama & goto 2002), which in this case correspond to type ii habitats. for the application of this method, is expected that the size structure of the ammocoetes captured in habitat types i and ii are similar, but that might not be the case because of the higher capacities of larger ammocoetes to burrow in coarser substrates, and the limit capacity of small-sized individuals on occupying wider ranges of particle sizes. it the larval phase of the lamprey’s life cycle is particularly sensitive as the ammocoetes are conﬁned to the freshwater courses and so are very susceptible to any modiﬁcation of the substrate composition, because of natural causes (e.g., large ﬂoods) or anthropogenic ones. the loss of suitable habitats because of the construction of impassable dams and weirs, commer- cial dredging and modiﬁcations of the riverbeds is considered to be one of the main reasons for the endangerment of this species (lelek 1987; witkowski 1992; almeida et al. 2000; quintella et al. 2003; rogado et al. 2005). on this perspective, the present study is quite relevant as it further enlightens on the ammocoete capacity on using a particular substrate to burrow. the information gathered with this work, together with the several studies on ammocoetes habitat selection can be used to classify stretches in rivers according to their suitability for ammocoetes, based on substrate components. the delimitation of viable areas for the establishment of ammocoete beds in rivers, followed by some restrictive measures to economic activities such as dredging and gravel extraction, can be an effective conservation measure to protect the larval phase of this species in european rivers where they are threatened. acknowledgements two portuguese institutions ﬁnancially supported this research, the water institute (inag) of the ministry of environment
