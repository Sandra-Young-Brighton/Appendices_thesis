variation being as high between charr from lakes within the same catchment, as between adjacent catchments. the pattern of both phenotypic and genotypic variation suggests a mosaic of variation across populations with geographically close populations often as distinct from each other as populations with much greater separation. very low levels of effective migrants between populations, even within the same catchment, suggest that this variation is being maintained by very low straying rates between phenotypically and genetically distinct populations, even when there is no apparent barrier to movement. we conclude that the genetic and phenotypic integrity of charr populations across scotland is high and that this adaptive radiation constitutes a ‘hidden’ element of diversity in northern freshwater systems. two consequences of this are that the population (rather than the species) makes a more rational unit for the consideration of conservation strategies and that the habitat requirements and therefore management needs may differ signiﬁcantly between populations. c. e. adams1, d. fraser2, a. j. wilson3, g. alexander1, m. m. ferguson3, s. skulason4 1institute of biomedical and life sciences, university of glasgow, glasgow, uk, 2english nature, peterborough, cambridgeshire, uk, 3institute of evolutionary biology, university of edinburgh, u.k., 4holar agricultural college, holar, saudarkrokur, iceland key words: postglacial invasion;

adams et al. 1998; fraser et al. 1999) and in foraging ability (adams & huntingford 2002a). however, until relatively recently, the very wide range of observed phenotypic variability did not seem 78 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00182.x to be matched by similar variability at the genetic level between populations (hartley et al. 1995). recent use of microsatellite dna techniques have, however, now enabled between-population discrimin- ation at a genetic level (gı´slason et al. 1999; wilson et al. 2004). one of the consequences of phenotypic variability across arctic charr is that it has led to speculation over the integrity of the species, with some individual populations being proposed as putative species (see, e.g., adams & maitland 2006). although there is a strong case for a re-evaluation of the taxonomic status of alpinus (see kottelat 1997) here for simplicity we refer to arctic charr, s. alpinus, as a single species. a second consequence of phenotypic and genetic variability across the species that has received little attention, is the effect of this extreme variability on the strategies for effective conservation and management of arctic charr. two critical questions stem from the extent of the phenotypic variability found in the arctic charr which are less acute in other species. firstly, is it possible to generalise about the conservation and management requirements across this species? if the biological or physical requirements differ substantially across the species, as the result of variability, then it may be difﬁcult to develop generic conservation criteria. secondly, what is a reasonable unit of conservation? if there is signiﬁcant structuring in the phenotypic or genetic variability within the species, a focus on conservation and management at the species level may not result in the protection of important elements within the species. here we address these questions using data on the phenotypic, genetic and behavioural variation in charr from across scotland. speciﬁcally, we examine: 1 variation in habitat use by arctic charr across a discrete, geographic area (across scotland). 2 the degree and pattern of phenotypic variation across scales: across scotland, between adjoining catchments and between lakes within catchments. three spatial 3 the degree and pattern of genotypic variation between adjacent catchments and between lakes, within catchments. materials and methods arctic charr were collected from a total of 22 lakes across scotland. collection sites spanned the most southerly, to the most northerly scottish charr popu- lations and populations from the east to the west of the country (fig. 1). for 21 of these sites, a structured randomised sampling procedure was used (see below); phenotypic and genetic variation in charr for one further site (loch grilsta) charr samples were obtained but not in a structured sampling protocol. this site was omitted from analysis of comparative catch rates and habitat use. to look for variation at smaller spatial scales, two adjoining catchments and all the lakes containing charr within them were sampled. the laxford system (suth- erland, scotland) drains west and contains two lakes which support charr population (lochs stack and more). the shin catchment adjoins the south-east edge of the laxford system but drains to the east of scotland. it contains three lakes which support charr populations (lochs merkland, a’ghriama and shin) (fig. 2). structured random sampling for ﬁsh fish were sampled from each loch by gill-net. standard mono-ﬁlament survey gill-nets of 60-m long and 1.5-m deep (lundgrens, sweden) comprising 10 panels of 8–45 mm half-mesh size, were set on the bottom of the loch overnight. to sample in the pelagic zone, nets 60-m long and 3-m deep of mesh sizes 12.5–33 mm half-mesh were suspended 1 m below the surface. catches were then adjusted to a catch per )1) to compare unit effort (cpue) (100 m2 net 24 h differences in habitat use by charr, nets were set in each of four habitat types in each lake: littoral zone, on the bottom in 2–10 m water depth. sublittoral zone, on the bottom in 10–20 m water depth. profundal zone, on the bottom in 30+ m of water. pelagic zone, 1 m below the surface over the deepest area of the loch. if catches of charr at any lake were less than 50 individuals, sampling was repeated over a second night. charr were removed from gill-nets at the bankside and given an individual identiﬁcation code. where genetic samples were required, the adipose ﬁn was removed and stored in 100% alcohol. fish were placed in ice for return to the laboratory where they were immediately frozen at )16 °c. characterisation of trophic morphology to look for variation across populations, 14 head landmarks were located from lateral view photographs of each ﬁsh. these were used to generate 11 head morphometric variables and a single measure of pectoral ﬁn length (see fig. 3). as these linear head morphometric variables were strongly correlated with ﬁsh size, the residuals derived from the regression of each head variable on fork-length (all populations pooled) were used as a size-independent measure of for each morphometric variable. principal compo- nent scores from pc1 and pc2 were derived using 79 adams et al. fig. 1. the 22 sampling sites for charr from scotland and ireland. ag, a’ghriama;

adams et al. 1998; fraser et al. 1999). in laboratory experiments, vari- ation in trophic morphology has also been shown to affect prey handling ability in charr (sku´ lason et al. 1993; adams & huntingford 2002a) and this variation has been shown to be inherited, at in some populations (sku´ lason et al. 1996; adams & hunting- ford 2002b, 2004; klemetsen et al. 2002). thus, the variation in trophic morphology shown across scot- land in this study would strongly suggest that this phenotypic radiation is adaptive. least also evident in this study, is that trophic morphol- ogy can differ signiﬁcantly over very short geograph- ical distances. trophic morphology variation was as great within catchments (between lakes) as it was between catchments for the laxford and shin systems examined here. this ﬁnding was also supported by the pattern of microsatellite genetic variation within and between catchments, which showed clear and distinct discrimination between lakes from different catch- ments as well as between lochs within catchments. thus charr from lakes within the same catchment, where there are no evident barriers to ﬁsh movement (for example, between lochs stack and more in the laxford catchment and between lochs shin, a’ghri- ama and merkland in the shin catchment) differ signiﬁcantly in trophic morphology and represent different gene pools. the ultimate mechanisms through which this phenotypic and genetic structuring could have occurred are uncertain, however, there is strong evidence that scottish and other northern european populations resulted from a postglacial phenotypic and genetic variation in charr invasion from a single refugium (brunner et al. 2001; wilson et al. 2004) and that diversiﬁcation has occurred during the postglacial period (gı´slason et al. 1999). this study does, however, suggest one mech- anism through which between-population variation may be maintained. estimates of effective, interbreed- ing migrants between populations even within the same catchment were very low (one to two per generation) thus each loch population is operating as a separate gene pool even within systems with inter- connected lochs in the same catchment. the pattern of both phenotypic variation shown here and genetic variation on large and small spatial scales (also see wilson et al. 2004) strongly supports the conclusion that extensive differentiation between populations has occurred across scotland, such that even neighbouring populations may differ signiﬁ- cantly. this mosaic of phenotypic and genetic diver- sity has a number of speciﬁc consequences and challenges for conservation. firstly, it is clear that the genetic and phenotypic integrity of populations across scotland is very high and that the mixing of populations that has occurred as a result of ‘management’ practice in other species has not occurred or has not been successful to any signiﬁcant extent within scotland. this is probably because until now, arctic charr has been largely ignored within scotland as an angling and culture species (maitland 1995). secondly, the extensive adaptive radiation in phe- notype and genetic diversity of arctic charr within scotland, contributes signiﬁcantly to the effective biodiversity of our northern freshwater systems. notwithstanding the current single species status (although see argument in kottelat 1997), the arctic charr is clearly a genetic and phenotypically different ﬁsh in different places that also differs in its functional role in ecosystems. a third conclusion that follows from the pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation is that a focus on the species as the unit for conservation for arctic charr would be highly inappropriate. any conservation strategy for arctic charr to be successful in conserving the essential elements of the nature of the arctic charr would need to recognise the importance of individual populations. lastly, it is clear that the management needs of charr in different populations may differ signiﬁ- cantly. in this study, we show very high degrees of variation in traits with a functional signiﬁcance for foraging and signiﬁcant habitat use differences by charr from different populations. we also know that spawning requirements may differ between popula- tions (see walker 2006). thus the speciﬁc require- ments differ substantially between populations, making deﬁnition quality may habitat for good 85 in icelandic arctic char journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 56: 2229–2234.
