introduction liver glycogen serves as energy store of glucose which ﬁsh use for the energy metabolism of many tissues such as the central nervous system, gonads and muscle in rapid-burst swimming (vijayan & moon 1992; mehrani & storey 1993; blasco et al. 2001). in hatchery-reared atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.), the liver glycogen content is positively related to content of digestible carbohydrates at water temperatures ‡12 °c (hemre et al. 1995). however, information on liver glycogen contents of wild atlantic salmon juveniles is limited and the few observations gives a general liver glycogen content of wild juveniles is low (0.2–2.6%) (virtanen et al. 1988). however, in some earlier studies in other ﬁsh species there are observations of seasonal changes in liver mass or in liver glycogen content (valtonen 1974; blier & guderley 1988; segner & braunbeck 1990; thibault et al. 1997) and changes in carbohydrate metabolism related to water temperature and nutri- tional status of ﬁsh (plisetskaya 1980; hemre et al. 1995; pereira et al. 1995; bjo¨rnsson 1997; thibault et al. 1997). in northern salmon rivers, water tem- perature and the nutritional status of atlantic salmon idea that levels of parr changes seasonally (erkinaro & niemela¨ 1995; berg & bremset 1998). to get more information, from the actual liver glycogen and seasonal changes of it, wild atlantic salmon parr of different age were sampled during different seasons. the condition factor (cf) was used as the general indicator of the energy reserve situation of the parr, as there is a positive correlation between the cf and total lipid content of the ﬁsh (pinder & eales 1969; herbinger & friars 1991). material and methods the study was carried out in the sub-arctic river teno in northern finland (70°n, 28°e) and its tributary utsjoki and its nursery brook in the river baðða (see the location of the study rivers in erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). the ice-covered period in the rivers normally lasts from november to may. the water temperature begins to rise at the end of may and it reaches its maximum level at the end of july (see more detailed water temperature information during open water season in erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). parr migrate to the brook baðða from the main stem teno and the typical age of parr in the brook is 2–4 years, whereas in 323 heinimaa spawning rivers it is 0–2 years (erkinaro 1995). to obtain samples of all age classes, the salmon parr were electroﬁshed from the middle reaches of the river teno and from the lower reaches of the tributaries baðða and utsjoki, the sampling sites situated within 24-km distance from each other. the water temperature during sampling was 9–14 °c in july, 2–9 °c in september and 0.2–2 °c in may. one additional electroﬁshing was carried out in december in the outlet of the lake in the river utsjoki, which was the only ice-free area with water temperature of 0.4 °c during sampling. fish were captured by electroﬁshing during the years 1994 and 1995. parr were maintained in a bucket 5–30 min before killing with a sharp blow on the head. the total length from nose to the end of tail (to nearest mm) and total weight (to nearest 0.1 g) were measured in order to calculate the fulton’s condition factor cf ¼ weight (g) · length )3(cm) · 100. altogether 185 wild atlantic salmon parr aged 1–4 years were sampled (table 1 and 2). the total length of the sampled ﬁsh varied on an average from 4.5 to 13.5 cm and the weight from 0.8 to 20.5 g. the liver tissue samples were frozen in liquid n2 until analysed for liver glycogen content (% of fresh liver mass) measured after hydrolysation as glucose using god perid method (harris et al. 1974). to test differences in liver glycogen content between different age groups and between different sampling times, one- way ancova with length as the covariant and in cf one-way anova were used (a ¼ 0.05). for statistical analysis the normality of the residuals was tested with the lillifors test and the homogeneity of variances with the levenes test. computations were carried out with systat 8.0 statistical software. results the liver glycogen content of different aged parr sampled at the same time showed no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the rivers studied (table 1). the length differences of the parr did not affect the liver glycogen contents analysed using one- way ancova with length as the covariant. moreover, in the main stem teno, there were no signiﬁcant differences in liver glycogen content of 1 and 2-year- old parr between different sampling times (table 1). however, in the tributaries baðða and utsjoki statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed in liver glycogen content of ‡2-year-old parr between different sampling times (table 1). the liver glyco- gen contents of the parr were lowest in july and the highest in december (table 1). seasonal chan- ges in the liver glycogen different age groups. content of signiﬁcantly higher in the main stem teno than those of the older parr in the tributaries baðða and utsjoki (tukey test, p £ 0.005). in liver glycogen contents were similar the 1-year-old parr was in july, there were signiﬁcant differences in the cf of the different age groups, the cf of 2-year-old parr being lower than older parr in the tributaries baðða and utsjoki in july samples (table 2). moreover, there were signiﬁcant differences in the cf between different sampling times (table 2). the lowest cfs were observed in may in the river teno and in the tributary utsjoki (table 2). the cf of the 2-year-old parr in the nursery brook baðða was signiﬁcantly lower than in the tributary utsjoki in july (tukey test, p £ 0.001). table 1. sampling places, dates, number of sampled

p-value <0.001 ns ns ns ns 0.013 ns discussion the ‡2-year-old parr the observed differences in liver glycogen content of wild atlantic parr were not related to the age and size of the ﬁsh but they were more related to the season as changes in liver glycogen content were similar in different age groups between sampling dates. how- ever, in the main stem teno, even the seasonal changes in liver glycogen content were low. the observed low liver glycogen values of in tributaries in july may be the result of handling stress (vijayan & moon 1992; hemre & krogdahl 1996) as changes in liver glycogen content can be rapid in warm water (hemre et al. 1995). however, it could also be related to more active burst swimming of older parr feeding activity compared with the younger parr (erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). the feeding activity, growth and increase of cf of the parr are highest from may to july in these rivers (table 2, erkinaro & niemela¨ 1995; erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). related to their higher drift the liver glycogen content may increase with decreasing water temperature especially in ﬁsh, which have a low carbohydrate diet (hemre et al. 1995) as the metabolic need and capability to use glycogen decrease (hemre et al. 1995; bjo¨rnsson 1997; thibault et al. 1997). both cold water and starvation increase the efﬁciency of lipid metabolism compared with carbohydrate metabolism (plisetskaya 1980; pereira et al. 1995; thibault et al. 1997) and parr use mainly their body lipid stores during winter (cunjak 1988; berg & bremset 1998). this could be observed in this study too in low cf of parr after winter in may, whereas the liver glycogen content of parr remained relatively stable from september to may. the relatively high liver glycogen and cf of the parr in december may partly be the result of the sampling location in the outlet of the lake. water temperature and the food supply are typically higher in the outlet of the lake compared with a rifﬂe section in a river (gibson & galbraith 1975; erkinaro & erkinaro 1998). insect the content of nitrogen-free extract, i.e. sugars and starches, of food can vary considerably (0.8–33.8%; reinecke & owen 1980) but it is not known how well ﬁsh can digest these compounds. generally ﬁsh cannot utilize starches very effectively (bergot & bre´que 1983; spannhof & plantikow 1983). however, the observed liver glycogen levels of the wild parr were higher than was expected from earlier studies (virtanen et al. 1988). the liver glycogen contents of ‡2-year-old parr were the level of 0.2–2.6% observed by virtanen et al. (1988). however, many samples were taken in water temper- atures £4 °c where the ability to use glycogen is lowered (hemre et al. 1995; thibault et al. 1997). this may be one reason for the observed high liver glycogen contents of the wild parr. in july, resumen 1. durante dos an˜os de estudio, el contenido medio de gluco´ geno hepa´tico en juveniles de salmo_salar de 1 a 4 an˜os de edad del rı´o teno (norte de finlandia) vario´ entre 0.5 y 9.5% del peso del hı´gado fresco mientras que el factor de condicio´ n (cf) vario´ entre 0.66 y 0.85. 2. no hubo diferencias signiﬁcativas en el contenido de gluco´ geno hepa´tico entre los distintos grupos de edad ni tampoco en el coeﬁciente de condicio´n. sin embargo, si aparecieron diferencias estacionales en el contenido de gluco´ - geno hepa´tico y en el coeﬁciente de condicio´n de estos juveniles. los menores contenidos de gluco´ geno hepa´tico fueron observados en julio y los ma´s altos en septiembre y 325 heinimaa diciembre. a su vez, los menores coeﬁcientes de condicio´ n fueron observados en mayo y los ma´s altos en julio. acknowledgements i thank the personnel of the river tenojoki fisheries research station for co-operation in sampling and age determination; h. partanen and the university of helsinki, department of zoology, division of physiology for the liver glycogen analyses; m. julkunen for statistical advice; p. heinimaa, l. forsman, m. pasternack, a. soivio and j. erkinaro for comments on the manuscript. i also thank the finnish cultural foundation, the foundation for research of natural resources in finland and the aquaculture unit of the finnish game and fisheries research institute for ﬁnancial support during this study. references berg, o.k. & bremset, g. 1998. seasonal changes in the body composition of young riverine atlantic salmon and brown_trout. journal of fish biology 52: 1272–1288. bergot, f. & bre´que, j. 1983. digestibility of starch by rainbow trout: effects of the physical state of starch and of the intake level. aquaculture 34: 203–212. bjo¨rnsson, b.th. 1997. the biology of salmon growth hormone: from daylight to dominance. fish physiology and biochemistry 17: 9–24. blasco, j., marimo´ n, i., viaplana, i. & ferna´ndez-borra´s, j. 2001. fate of plasma glucose in tissues of brown_trout in vivo: effects of fasting and glucose loading. fish physiology and biochemistry 24: 247–258. blier, p. & guderley, h. 1988. metabolic responses to cold acclimation in the swimming musculature of lake whiteﬁsh, coregonus_clupeaformis. journal of experimental zoology 246: 244–252. cunjak, r.a. 1988. physiological consequences of overwinter- ing in streams: the cost of acclimitization?
