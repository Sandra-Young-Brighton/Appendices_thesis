warren et al. 2000). due to their life cycle require- ments, many anadromous ﬁshes are particularly sus- ceptible to several of these disturbances. to effectively manage declining anadromous ﬁsh populations, information is needed about all life history stages, including habitat use by age 0 ﬁsh. the shad sub-family (alosinae) contains seven genera and 31 species that are among the world’s most commercially important ﬁshes (waldman 2003). shad occur on all continents except australia and antarctica and are mostly anadromous (berra 2001; waldman 2003). in rivers draining the atlantic slope of north america, american shad (alosa sapidissima) have supported important commercial and recreational ﬁsheries for over 100 years (mcphee 2002). american shad have been extensively studied, with successful stock enhancements in many northern rivers (hen- dricks 2003). in contrast, relatively little is known about the american shad’s sister species (bowen et al. 2008), the alabama shad (alosa alabamae). alabama shad are not as commercially important as american shad and have received little research attention despite substantial life stages have not been studied in depth, and there is virtually no published data on marine life stages. conservation of the range contractions. the freshwater this species will require doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00395.x 107 mickle et al. identiﬁcation and preservation of essential ﬁsh habitat necessary to sustain early life stages (benaka 1999). range and autecology shad populations alabama shad are a noaa fisheries species of concern (cain 2004) and are considered endangered by the iucn (meadows et al. 2008). huntsman (1994) described alabama as ‘reduced’ and ‘vulnerable to extinction’. the species experienced substantial range contraction over the last six decades, resulting in its extirpation from the northern and eastern reaches of its historical distribu- tion (fig. 1) (coker 1930, douglas 1974, etnier & starnes 1993; boschung & mayden 2004). the species disappeared from the pearl river, mississippi (ms), in 1980s, leaving only the pascagoula river population in the state (gunning & suttkus 1990). the major factor contributing to the decline is large numbers of impoundments blocking upstream migra- tion to spawning grounds and loss of putative spawning habitat. other potential contributing factors include habitat degradation, such as declining water quality and increased siltation (mettee & o’neil 2003). the spawning ecology of alabama shad has been documented in several river drainages. spawning is thought to occur in swift water over sandy substrate, gravel shoals, or limestone outcrops, when water temperatures range from 10 to 22 °c (laurence & yerger 1967; mills 1972; fox et al. 2000). spawning individuals range in age from 1 to 5 years for males and 2 to 6 years for females in the choctawhatchee fig. 1. sampling sites in the leaf (#1–4), chickasawhay (#5–8) and pascagoula (#9–10) rivers in southeastern mississippi (ms), usa. the inset map indicates historical (light shaded area) and current (dark shaded area) distributions of alabama shad as well as a box around the pascagoula river drainage. 108 river, alabama and florida (mettee & o’neil 2003). mills (1972) found that 25–38% of the adult alabama shad in the apalachicola river, fl, were repeat spawners. alabama shad spawn from january to april in southern drainages (laurence & yerger 1967; mills 1972) and from may to june in northern drainages (coker 1930; burr et al. 1996). (1972) juvenile alabama shad spend the summer and fall in their natal drainage before returning to the gulf of mexico in late fall or winter (barkuloo et al. 1995). mills identiﬁed three putative spawning cohorts originating from different locations in the apalachicola river drainage. based on length- frequencies of age 0 ﬁsh, mills (1972) suggested that ﬁsh begin leaving the river in august and continue to emigrate through november. this timeline has ﬁsh leaving natal rivers at sizes ranging from roughly 105 to 125 mm fork length. however, collection of age 0 ﬁsh in the lower apalachicola river as late as december, led laurence & yerger (1967) to propose that age 0 ﬁsh slowly descend rivers throughout the summer, leaving spawning grounds in spring and arriving in the gulf of mexico in late fall and winter. several studies have examined juvenile alabama shad use of shallow (i.e., wadeable) habitats, but no studies have explored their use of deeper habitats. this the purpose of study was to document freshwater habitat use by age 0 alabama shad in an unimpounded river system, the pascagoula river drainage, ms. our objectives were to characterise patterns in abundance, presence ⁄ absence, length and condition of alabama shad by spatial (rivers and habitat (years and months) and physicochemical variables. type), temporal based on characteristics of alabama shad spawning habitats in the apalachicola river (laurence & yerger 1967; mills 1972) and spawning habitat requirements for american shad (emmett et al. 1991; hightower & sparks 2003), we predicted that alabama shad in the study system would spawn in the upper reaches of the leaf and chickasawhay rivers. the pascagoula river is generally deeper, with lower current velocities and, thus, was not predicted to contain suitable spawning habitat for the species. study system the pascagoula river drainage is the largest unim- pounded river system in the contiguous united states (dynesius & nilsson 1994). two large tributaries, the leaf and chickasawhay rivers, join to form the pasca- goula river approximately 105 km from the coast (fig. 1). the drainage lies entirely within the gulf coastal plain province, and its large rivers are characterised by sinuous channels dominated by large sandbar, open channel and steep bank habitats, the latter typically containing large woody debris. land use within the drainage consists of forestry and agriculture, with limited industrial and urban develop- ment. the leaf and chickasawhay rivers differ from one another in a number of ways. the leaf river is more sinuous and has a larger ﬂoodplain, whereas the chickasawhay river has a more conﬁned channel along the upper segments. discharge is typically lower in the chickasawhay river than in the leaf river. )1 [1.24 coefﬁcient mean annual discharge is 99.3 m3æs in the chickasawhay river, of variation (cv)] )1 125.5 m3æs in the leaf river and )1 (1.2 cv) in the pascagoula river (data 306.0 m3æs from usgs gauging stations 02478500, 02475000 and 2479310, respectively). of the three rivers stud- ied, the leaf river is shallowest and tends to have lower, current velocities and higher, water clarity and conductivity (appendix s1).

habitat type in each site. sand bars and banks averaged 550 m in length and could be sampled effectively in 400 s. some of the larger sand bars were electroﬁshed an additional 50–75 s. boat electroﬁshing was the only means of standardising effort across all three habitat types because some were typically deep and fast ﬂowing (e.g., july bank samples averaged 109 mickle et al. )1, 3.17 m deep with a water velocity of 0.52 mæs appendix s1). this sampling approach was effective for a number of species, yielding reliable community data (schaefer et al. 2006). abundance was quantiﬁed as catch per unit effort [(cpue) ﬁsh caught per 400 s of electroﬁshing effort]. alabama shad were weighed (wet weight, to the nearest 0.01 g) and measured [standard length (sl), to the nearest mm] in the ﬁeld before being individually tagged and placed in 95% ethanol. all alabama shad were deposited in the university of southern missis- sippi museum of ichthyology. we used fulton’s index (wet weight per sl3) as a measure of ﬁsh condition. for analyses, ﬁsh length and condition index were averaged across individuals within each sample (site, habitat type and date). standard deviations (sd) within a sample were low, with a maximum sd of 6.93 and 0.068 for length and condition, respectively. we used akaike’s information criterion adjusted for small sample size (aicc) to assess the quality of competing candidate models for predicting cpue, shad presence or absence, mean length and mean condition of juvenile alabama shad in samples (burnham & anderson 2002). models with low daicc and high akaike weights (wi) have the best combination of parsimony (fewer parameters) and ﬁt (accuracy) for the data. candidate models were constructed based on spatial expected spatial and temporal patterns seen in other similar systems and earlier work on alabama shad. variables were categorised as (river and habitat), temporal (year and month) and physicochem- ical (pca axis scores, pc1 and pc2). within each of these categories of variables, we created three candi- date models [e.g., spatial models included river only, habitat only, and river, habitat, and their interaction term (latter model noted as river*habitat in tables), table 1]. sixteen additional candidate models com- bined one or more variables from two categories (spatial + temporal, spatial + physicochemical, tem- poral + physicochemical). the last two models were a null model (no variables) and a global model (all variables). three way and higher interaction terms were excluded from all models because they would be problematic to interpret. candidate models were applied to each response variable (cpue, pres- ence ⁄ absence, mean length and mean condition). for each set of models, we only interpreted those with a wi >10% of the highest wi (burnham & anderson 2006, grossman et al. 2006). results from a total of 235 samples (77, 82 and 76 samples in the chickasawhay, leaf and pascagoula rivers, respec- table 1.

⁄ october), and at 8 of 10 sampling sites. the majority of shad were captured in the leaf (66) followed by the pascagoula (55) and chickasawhay (12) rivers (appendix s1). the ﬁrst two axes of the pca accounted for 48% of the variability in the eight physicochemical parameters measured for each sample (fig. 2a). current velocity, secchi depth and conductivity had the highest load- ings (>0.4) on the ﬁrst axis (26.7% of variance), and ph, temperature and do loaded on the second axis (21.5% of variance). physicochemical differences among the three habitat types were subtle, with most of the variability among samples explained by differ- ences among rivers and months (fig. 2b,c). the three rivers clustered along the ﬁrst axis (mean pc 1 scores of )1.01, 0.22 and 0.78 for the chickasawhay, leaf and pascagoula rivers, respectively), largely reﬂecting different hydrologic properties. samples from the chickasawhay and leaf rivers generally had greater current velocities (appendix s1). august bank sam- ples were typically low ﬂow with higher conductivity (fig 2b), while september–october channel samples were cooler with higher do (fig. 2c). descriptive statistics for all physicochemical variables are sum- marised by river, month and habitat type in appen- dix s1. alabama shad were captured in 43 of the 235 samples, and ﬁve of the models predicting pres- ence ⁄ absence were interpretable (table 2). while none of the models were particularly strong (wi ranged from 0.034 to 0.28), the three strongest contained the habitat variable, and four contained pc2. alabama shad were most often captured in sandbar habitats and in bank habitat in the leaf river (fig. 3). pooling rivers and months, alabama shad were captured in 9.8% of bank samples, 16.3% of channel samples and 26.1% of sandbar samples (appendix s1). overall, samples with alabama shad had signiﬁcantly lower pc2 scores (lower temperature and higher do and ph; anova habitat use of alabama shad bank sandbar

containing river and year variables. twelve alabama shad were captured in 77 chickasawhay samples (cpue 0.15), 55 captured in 76 pascagoula samples (cpue 0.71) and 66 captured in 82 leaf river samples (cpue 0.73). cpue ranged from 0.38 in 2004 to 0.50 in 2005 and 1.07 in 2006. alabama shad increased in size over the summer from a mean of 47.0 mm (±2.94 se) in june to 101 mm (±4.44 se) in october. all three interpretable models of mean size included both temporal variables (year and month, table 2). the two strongest models (wi = 0.392 and 0.310) also included either habitat or river variables. fish in sandbar samples were signiﬁcantly (anova f = 11.89, p < 0.001) smaller (65.0 mm sl ± 4.18 se) than those in channel and bank habitats (90.8 mm ± 4.62 se and 95.1 mm ± 4.42 se, respec- tively;

variables were the best predictors of alabama shad presence, while river and year variables were the best predictors of abun- dance (cpue). overall, ﬁsh were most often found on sandbar habitat and in bank habitat in the leaf river 112 the summer increased over (fig. 3, appendix s1). sandbar habitat was also favoured by smaller individuals early in the year. cpue on sandbars was highest in june (no captures in june bank or channel samples, fig. 4) and declined over the summer. in contrast, cpue in channel and bank habitat (appen- dix s1). these data indicate there is an ontogenetic shift towards bank and channel habitat as ﬁsh grow through the summer. capturing more shad on sandbar habitat could be due to greater abundance of smaller juveniles early in the spring. however, smaller ﬁsh avoided channel and bank habitat entirely, and in months where shad were sampled in all habitats, ﬁsh from channel and bank habitats tended to be larger (table 2, fig. 4). the leaf and pascagoula rivers provided more productive habitat for alabama shad than did the chickasawhay river. we collected fewer ﬁsh in the chickasawhay river, and they had lower condition indices than those from the other rivers (fig. 4, appendix s1). there is likely some spawning in the chickasawhay river, as most of the juveniles sampled were small and probably did not move upstream to the sampled locations. however, cpue was very low later in the summer indicating that these ﬁsh either did not survive the early summer or moved downstream, possibly into the pascagoula river. the leaf and pascagoula rivers are shallower with more abundant sandbar habitat compared with the chickasawhay river that has a more conﬁned channel, higher current velocities and less sandbar habitat (fig. 2a). the reasons for the observed ontogenetic habitat shift from sandbars to deeper waters are unknown, but could include release from predation pressure, changes in food availability, foraging needs, or thermal ecol- ogy. shifts in habitat use by prey species, once they exceed predator gape limitations, are well-documented (bystro¨m et al. 2003). potential predators in our system (e.g., micropterus spp., caught as bycatch, schaefer et al. 2006) were most abundant in the open channel and bank habitats avoided by the smaller ﬁsh. we cannot fully assess the role of diet in the habitat shifts until we learn more about the feeding ecology of juvenile alabama shad. buchanan et al. (1999) found benthic invertebrates in stomachs of 10 juvenile alabama shad, and ross (2001) stated that age 0 ﬁsh are opportunistic feeders, eating ﬁsh, dipterans, and copepods. we observed age 0 ﬁsh feeding at the surface, indicating they feed in part on terrestrial or emerging aquatic insects. a shift away from sand bars might be expected once ﬁsh are large enough to hold position and surface-feed in faster ﬂowing habitats. finally, the shift in habitat was not absolute, as some of the largest ﬁsh sampled late in the year were caught on sandbar habitats in the pascagoula river. small juvenile alabama shad were collected at the downstream-most sites in the drainage in early spring, indicating that spawning may also occur in the pascagoula river. given what is known of spawning habitat; however, this seems unlikely. we think it more likely that some larvae from the chickasawhay and leaf rivers drifted downstream during high spring ﬂows and remained in the pascagoula river for the summer. we found no evidence of a gradual downstream migration of juvenile alabama shad throughout the summer. we collected small ﬁsh (45 mm mean sl) in june at downstream sites (fig. 1, sites 3, 4, and 10) in the leaf and pascagoula rivers and large ﬁsh (141 mm mean sl) in september ⁄ october at some upstream sites in the leaf river (fig. 1, sites 1 and 2). juvenile alabama shad were present in the upper leaf river as late as december 5, 2005, but early spring and early summer sampling yielded no alabama shad >20 mm, indicating that the ﬁsh did not overwinter in fresh water. most studies indicate alabama shad migrate to the marine environment from september to december (laurence & yerger 1967; mills 1972; pﬂeiger 1975; etnier & starnes 1993; buchanan et al. 1999). mills (1972) suggested emigration from the apalachicola river was triggered by size (>125 mm fork length) for early cohorts and by low water temperatures for later cohorts. however, he sampled age 0 ﬁsh only by seining, and, thus, could have misinterpreted a shift to deeper habitats by large age 0 ﬁsh as emigration from the system. we found that within the pascagoula drainage, ﬁsh began to emigrate between 140 and 160 mm and as late as december. a better under- standing of when the transition between ecosystems occurs and what factors inﬂuence it would be useful for the conservation of this species, especially in drainages with controlled discharge (e.g., buchanan et al. 1999). and increasing no studies have examined alabama shad thermal preferences or tolerances, but other members of the alosinae sub-family are sensitive to high temperatures (e.g., lethal temperature for the alewife alosa pseud- oharaengus is 25 °c; beitinger et al. 2000; mccauley & binkowski 1982). summer conditions in the pascagoula river drainage typically feature decreasing discharge through august. the maximum water temperature measured during this study was 32.6 °c. in the drainage, both gulf sturgeon (acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) and striped bass (morone saxatalis) seek out coolwater refugia during the warmest periods (jackson et al. 2000; heise et al. 2005). alabama shad movement off of shallow sand bars to deeper water in the summer may be a means of minimising thermal stress. juvenile alabama shad have been sampled in water as warm as 32 °c (buchanan et al. 1999; p. mickle, unpublished temperatures habitat use of alabama shad data). with one exception (pascagoula river in july), in all river-habitat and month-habitat combinations the mean temperature in samples with shad was lower than those without shad (appendix s1). these differ- ences were usually small except in august, when temperatures were highest. in august, samples with shad were typically 2 °c cooler than similar samples without shad. for example, pascagoula river samples in august with shad averaged 29.08 °c (±1.66 se) while those without were 31.09 °c (±0.22 se). in early summer, the mean length of alabama shad varies across the range (arkansas to florida), but length differences disappear by mid-summer (mills 1972; buchanan 1999; buchanan et al. 1999; this study). mean length was highly variable among years (year was a component of all interpretable models of sl, table 2) within both the pascagoula and ouachita (arkansas) river systems (buchanan 1999; buchanan et al. 1999). high variability in early summer lengths among rivers could be due to small sample sizes, variations in spawn timing and growth rates, size- selective mortality, differences in thermal regimes or a stochastic variables. additional variety of other research is needed to assess inﬂuencing summer growth. factors management and conservation plans for alabama shad should ensure that the dynamic processes responsible for creating and maintaining large sand bar habitats and woody debris accumulations along steep banks are preserved and that connectivity and ﬁsh passage are maintained throughout drainages. we recommend
