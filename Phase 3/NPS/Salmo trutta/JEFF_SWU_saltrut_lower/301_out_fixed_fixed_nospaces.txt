(2000) have demonstrated that infected white®sh and three- spined sticklebacks, respectively, had a higher growth rate than their unparasitized counter- parts. more speci®cally, the work of pulkkinen & valtonen (1999) has shown that infected ®sh grew faster in size in the ®rst year of life when compared to their unparasitized conspeci®cs. bal- labeni & ward (1993) found no changes in growth of european minnows caused by parasitic infec- tion. on the contrary, other studies have shown that infected ®sh may grow more slowly than unparasitized specimens in white®sh (miller 1945), bream (garadi & biro 1975), rainbow trout (wolf & markiw 1983), and chinook salmon (hauck 1984). thus, unambiguous examples of parasite-associated growth in ®sh are very rare. therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the existence, or not, of host gigantism in roach rutilus rutilus (l.) and the possible in¯uence of infection by plerocercoids of the pseu- dophyllidean cestode, ligula intestinalis (l.), on host growth. spurred by both con¯icting results (see references above) and the work of pulkkinen & valtonen (1999) which has shown accelerated growth rates in parasitized ®sh only during the ®rst year of life, we decided to examine the pos- sible effect of parasitism as a function of host age in roach. in order to examine it in the ®eld, we surveyed during the year 1998 three distinct ®sh populations in the southwest of france. in addition to studying the possible quantita- tive effects of parasites on host growth rates, we also investigated the variation in parasitic load with host age across the three ®sh populations: one factor potentially of great importance in the case of a parasite-mediated host alteration aimed at increasing transmission to de®nitive hosts (poulin 1998). effects of ligula plerocercoids on roach growth materials and methods study sites the roach specimens used in this study originated from three different ®sh populations in south- western france: (1) lavernose±lacasse gravel pit, (2) muret gravel pit and (3) lake pareloup (see fig. 1). fish populations were surveyed monthly from the beginning of january 1998 to the end of december 1998. lake pareloup, located in the massif central mountains, is the ®fth largest hydroelectric reser- voir in france (surface of 1260 ha, volume of water of 168 106 m3, location at 800 m above sea level, average annual water temperature of 9 8c). the muret gravel pit (surface of 17 ha, 175 m above sea level, maximum depth of 4 m with a mean depth of around 2 m, average annual water tem- perature around 148c) is situated on the alluvial plain of the garonne river, 2500 m away from the river. finally, the lavernose±lacasse gravel pit (surface of 23 ha, same water conditions as the muret pit) is also situated on the alluvial plain of the garonne river 2000 m from the river channel. animals roach specimens were gill-netted during monthly over-night samplings with nets of different mesh openings (10, 12, 14, 17, 21, and 27 mm measured between two adjacent knots) in order to cover the maximum size and age range of ®sh specimens (see loot et al. 2001a). unfortunately, we were unable to include in the analyses ®sh specimens of 4-year- old in both pareloup and lavernose±lacasse loca- lities, and of 2-year-old at muret, due to the very low numbers of specimens we collected for these speci®c age classes. after their capture, ®sh were measured (total body length) to the nearest mm. both total wet weight and somatic weight of ®sh were measured to the nearest gram, and then the ®sh were dissected to determine the number of plerocercoid larval forms occurring in the abdo- minal cavity. the parasitic load of each ®sh when plerocercoids occurred was quanti®ed using the index of parasitization (ip) of kennedy & burrough (1980). this index is calculated as the ratio of the total weight of plerocercoids per host to the total weight of the host minus the total weight of parasites, with this ratio then being multiplied by 100. scalimetry several scales were taken from the left side above the lateral line of each ®sh. the scales were 169 loot et al. fig. 1. geographical location of the three study sites (1) lavernose±lacasse gravel pit;

rousset et al. 1996). differences in parasite pre- valence, mean parasite abundance and ip between the different host age classes were estimated us- ing non-parametric kruskal±wallis' k statistics (sokal & rohlf 1994; zar 1996). results host body size prior to the examination of variation in growth rate, the best ®ts for modelling the relationships between the total length (tl) and the total scale effects of ligula plerocercoids on roach growth radius (tr) were given by power functions: for lake pareloup, unparasitized hosts tl 6.490 tr0.763(r2 0.680,p < 0.001)andparasitizedhosts tl 5.1397 tr0.809 (r2 0.790, p < 0.001);

(b) variability of mean abun- dance (se) with host age classes; and (c) variability of mean parasite index (se) with host age classes. the total number of roach specimens surveyed for each age class is indicated. effects of ligula plerocercoids on roach growth in mean parasite abundance (fig. 4b) and ip (fig. 4c) estimates as a function of ®sh age show a similar curvilinear pattern. for the three roach populations, a maximum level of prevalence, mean parasite abundance and ip occurs in the medium- size ®sh individuals, thus indicating that a para- site-induced mortality is likely to occur. trends in changes in mean parasite abundance with ®sh age were signi®cant, i.e., lake pareloup (kruskal± wallis' test, k 21.59, d.f. 6, p < 0.01), muret (k 20.90, d.f. 6, p < 0.01) and gravel pit lavernose±lacasse gravel pit (k 125.58, d.f. 5, p < 0.001). changes of ip with host age were also signi®cant for the three populations, i.e., pareloup lake (k 32.02, d.f. 6, p < 0.001), muret gravel pit (k 16.35, d.f. 6, p < 0.05), and lavernose±lacasse gravel pit (k 124.30, d.f. 5, p < 0.001). at lake pareloup the maximum parasite pre- valence (11%) was seen in 3-year-old roach, at muret (14%) also in 3-year-old roach, and at lavernose±lacasse (55%) in 2-year-old roach specimens. the maximum mean parasite abun- dance reached 0.43 (sd, 0.09) plerocercoids at pareloup for 3-year-old roach, 0.32 (sd, 0.09) plerocercoids at muret for 3-year-old roach as well, and 2.85 (sd, 0.21) at lavernose±lacasse for 2-year-old roach. the maximum ip reached 2.77 g (sd, 0.64) at pareloup for 3-year-old roach, 0.82 (sd, 0.28) at muret for 2-year-old roach and 7.80 (sd, 0.56) at lavernose±lacasse for 2-year-old ®sh. the most important ®nding is that roach at lavernose±lacasse were suffering more heavily from plerocercoid worms and were affected, on average, at a younger age, i.e., 1 year earlier, than the two other populations of ®sh. discussion the present ®ndings con®rmed pulkkinen & valtonen (1999) study of a parasite-associated host growth rate enhancement in the ®rst 2 years of life in ®sh. however, this seems likely to happen in only one roach population, i.e., the lavernose± lacasse gravel pit, among the three ®sh localities we surveyed. the host gigantism observed in the ®rst 2 years of life of parasitized roach specimens was correlated with the heaviest levels of infec- tion, in terms of prevalence (up to 55%), of mean abundance (up to 2.85, sd, 0.21) and of parasite index (up to 7.80, sd, 0.56), observed in any of the three localities. for instance, the very high level of prevalence, two times higher than that in the experiment of arnott et al. (2000), would tend to indicate that roach individuals at lavernose± lacasse might be relatively more susceptible to l. intestinalis infestation when compared to ®sh in 173 loot et al. the two other populations (pareloup, prevalence up to 11% and muret up to 14%). another alternative, but not exclusive, explanation could be that phenotypic differences between parasite population and/or possible differences in the probability of completion of the parasite's life cycle may affect their ability to infect the different host compartments and establish within the dif- ferent ®sh populations. the fact that more than half of the ®sh can be parasitized at lavernose± lacasse might implicate mutually stronger selec- tive pressures on hosts and parasites. in addition, in contrast to pulkkinen & valtonen's (1999) work, we found a cestode-induced host mortality in the three ®sh populations, with the lavernose±lacasse (k 125.58, roach population being by far p < 0.001) the most heavily harmed by parasitic effects. examination of mortality curves across the three different roach populations showed that ®sh in the lavernose±lacasse gravel pit were impacted earlier in their life, i.e., when 2-year old, by the debilitating effects of parasites, than ®sh from the pareloup and muret localities. there are four different possible explanations for this pattern of results. first, the results are consistent with the idea that plerocercoids could secrete growth enhancers resulting in accelerated host growth rates. interestingly, plerocercoids of the pseudophyllidean tapeworm, spirometra man- sonoides, in mice produce and release a protein, a plerocercoid growth factor (pgf) which binds and activates host growth hormone (gh) recep- tors (phares 1996, 1997). whereas pgf may obviously stimulate mouse growth in the case of s. mansonoides, we are unaware of the existence of such growth protein enhancers in l. intestinalis. in addition, the other related pseudophyllidean tapeworm, schistocephalus solidus, parasitizing the three-spined stickleback is another case where no such hormonal productions have been identi- ®ed (see arme & owen 1967; arnott et al. 2000). hence, the cestode-associated gigantism of roach we observed in this study is unlikely to be due to such physiological manipulation, an explanation which is entirely consistent with the fact that not all three roach populations were affected by accel- erated growth rates. the second explanation for the enhanced growth of cestode-parasitized individuals at lavernose±lacasse may be that some parasites have become specialised for exploiting the repro- ductive organs of the hosts. this can be achieved directly by feeding on the gonads of the host or by usurping the space normally allocated to gonads and eggs, or indirectly either by diverting energy away from the gonad development towards somatic usage (sorensen & minchella 1998) or 174 by the production of a peptide-like that inhibits the production of sexual organs in host (coustau et al. 1991; schallig et al. 1991) and in turn may stimulate the secretion of growth enhancers (hor- dijk et al. 1992). usually, castrated hosts divert energy towards somatic growth instead of allocat- ing it to reproduction. thus, parasitized hosts reach larger body sizes than their uninfected con- speci®cs (poulin 1998). this phenomenon is best known from mollusc±trematode interactions but occurs in many other systems. it is likely that l. intestinalis plerocercoids inhibit host ®sh gonad development but they obviously do not fully castrate their hosts (kerr 1948; arme et al. 1982), as is commonly believed. this may appear to be counter-intuitive because young plerocer- coids derive host energy to their own bene®t (larger larval forms may reach 380 mm length and 2.2 g with up to 30 plerocercoids of different sizes observed in one roach specimen) and immune responses exist in cyprinids against l. intestinalis infection (taylor & hoole 1994). although our ®ndings might be explained by a host strategy for preferential allocation of energy to somatic growth in parasitized individuals, this hypothesis does not explain the fact that we did not observe a cestode-associated growth enhance- ment in the heaviest infected ®sh of the two other localities, i.e., pareloup and muret. a third (but related to the previous one) expla- nation for the growth enhancement in parasitized hosts is that this phenomenon might result from a change in ®sh foraging behaviour, increased food conversion ef®ciency and/or reduced activity caused by parasite (arnott et al. 2000). for instance, plerocercoid larval forms of s. solidus, through a nutrient-energy drain, increase the nutritional demand of infected sticklebacks and stimulate their foraging behaviour (walkey & meakins 1970; pascoe & mattey 1977; giles 1983; milinski 1985; godin & sproul 1988). ada- mek et al. (1996) have shown that infestation of the roach by l. intestinalis strongly in¯uenced both food intake and diet composition, with para- sitized roach ingesting more animal food relative to plant food than did their non-infected counter- parts. walkey & meakins (1970) have suggested that with a heavy parasite load, particularly if this is represented by a large number of small rapidly growing plerocercoids of s. solidus, there is a considerable depletion of endogenous host food reserves, a fact that is occasionally substantiated by apparent weight losses in parasitized stickle- backs under considerable energetic stress. addi- tionally, infected sticklebacks may prefer smaller prey items relative to their stomach capacity because the presence of s. solidus plerocercoids can restrict the space available for food in and through the stomach (milinski 1985; cunning- ham et al. 1994). furthermore, infected stickle- backs are poor competitors and should favour small prey because these are ignored by unin- fected ®sh and so are not strongly contested (milinski 1985). our ®ndings have demonstrated that for the lavernose±lacasse roach population only, para- sitized ®sh grew faster and reached a larger body size than do uninfected specimens. it can be suggested that l. intestinalis affects the behaviour of roach at lavernose±lacasse in a manner that makes parasitized younger ®sh spend more time foraging. parasite-induced enhancement of feed- ing activity in hosts might then result in higher exposure to infected copepods. then after the ®rst 2 years of life, we observed a negative effect on ®sh growth and a decrease in somatic weight which could logically be explained by the energetic drain driven by the massive numbers of plerocercoids observed in 3-year-old roach specimens (see also pulkkinen & valtonen 1999). thus, in the laver- nose±lacasse locality, the hypothesis of enhanced host growth due to behavioural and/or physiolo- gical changes in parasitized individuals may be entirely relevant. however, it does not explain why in the muret gravel pit which is only 22 km away from lavernose±lacasse, and which pre- sents the same ecological conditions except for the degree of parasitism, we did not observe such a phenomenon of host gigantism. possibly, physio- logical differences between the two host-popula- tions might be invoked for the different outcomes in growth rates. the argument that parasite popu- lations could be distinct does not hold here due to the close proximity of the two localities, and the possibility of parasite exchanges via avian de®ni- tive hosts. the last two hypotheses propose that growth effects in hosts correspond to either an adaptative response by ®sh to parasitic infection, or a manip- ulation exerted by l. intestinalis to increase the likelihood of its transmission, respectively. first, gigantism observed in parasitized hosts might be a response which would promote host survival par- ticularly over the winter season. the irrelevance of this hypothesis based on the parasite life-cycle dynamics has been discussed by arnott et al. (2000) for another pseudophyllidean worm, s. solidus, parasitizing sticklebacks (tierney et al. 1996). for l. intestinalis in roach this is also unlikely that enhancement of growth associated with cestodes might act as an `insurance' for off- setting the risk of mortality during winter. in addition, the hypothesis formulated by ballabeni (1995) suggesting that parasite-induced growth effects of ligula plerocercoids on roach growth enhancement could correspond to a strategy for outliving infection is not valid in the case of l. intestinalis in roach because this cestode has an annual life-cycle and ®sh do not possess spe- ci®c mechanisms to eliminate plerocercoids when they are completely mature inside the host body cavity. furthermore, this hypothesis of a poten- tial host adaptation does not explain why the two other roach populations, i.e., pareloup and muret, did not show enhanced growth in parasitized hosts because logically we could expect such a response in those localities at least for the most heavily infected individuals present. finally, host gigantism could be a parasite adaptation to enhance transmission. previous studies have demonstrated that l. intestinalis strongly affects roach behaviour, i.e., parasitized specimens are preferentially found in shallow waters when compared with uninfected ®sh in natural conditions (loot et al. 2001a). moreover, this ®nding is supported by experimental studies which have demonstrated that infected roach individuals were more frequently observed near the water surface of a tank than control specimens found at the bottom of the water (loot et al. 2002). in addition, the tapeworm modi®es the normal swimming behaviour of ®sh into a jerky-style swimming and confers to infected roach a chubby-fat phenotype (loot et al. 2001b); this may represent an ef®cient way to attract the attention of bird predators, a scenario entirely compatible with the adaptative parasite- induced manipulation of host to increase the parasite trophic transmission (holmes & bethel 1972; lafferty 1997; poulin 1998; lafferty et al. 2000). the fact that enhancement of host growth only happens in the lavernose±lacasse popula- tion is consistent with the local level of infestation, by far the heaviest parasite load observed in this study. the absence of host gigantism in the two other localities we surveyed might be the conse- quence of different parasite life-cycle ef®ciencies, with the dynamics of l. intestinalis being more closely adapted to local population of their hosts at lavernose±lacasse, and/or the 3-host com- partment dynamics being more stochastic than that observed at lavernose±lacasse. obviously, experimental research is required in order to understand the phenomenon of host ®sh growth in this host-parasite system. unfortu- nately, the l. intestinalis-roach model does not easily allow experimental investigations com- pared with the s. solidus-stickleback model, nota- bly because infected ®sh are very sensitive to any manipulation. observational studies such as the present one are however, necessary, and the l. intestinalis-cyprinids model makes an interesting 175 loot et al. choice for comparative studies in natural settings. in summary, our ®ndings indicate that either close coevolutionary interactions may happen locally to drive parasite transmission success, or that some local host-populations may be more suscep- tible to l. intestinalis infection independently of coevolutionary processes. resumen 1. este estudio evaluâ a los efectos diferenciales del cestodo pseudophyllideo, ligula intestinalis, sobre las tasas de cre- cimiento de poblaciones de rutilus rutilus. mostramos que solo una poblacioâ n hueâ sped estaâ afectada por gigantismo inducido por el paraâ sito durante los dos primeros anä os de vida. 2. paradojicamente, el incremento en el crecimiento de los peces esta altamante relacionado con la carga parasitaria, en que solamente la poblacioâ n de r. rutilus sujeta a mayor presioâ n parasitaria mostroâ un mayor crecimiento de los individuos parasitados por el cestodo. este gigantismo obser- vado en solamente una poblacioâ n estaâ asociado a una mor- talidad de los peces inducida por el parasito que ocurre, de promedio, un anä o antes en esta poblacioâ n. 3. discutimos las varias razones de este efecto parasitario diferencial sobre el crecimiento de poblaciones salvajes. que los efectos sobre el crecimiento representen una respuesta adaptativa del hueâ sped o sean el resultado de una mani- pulacioâ n del hueâ sped por l. intestinalis permanece todavia sin dilucidar. acknowledgements this work was supported in part by a junior fellowship grant from the french ministry of research and higher education (gl). references
