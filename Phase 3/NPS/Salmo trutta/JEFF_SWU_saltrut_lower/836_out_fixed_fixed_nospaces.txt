pike (esox lucius) in a northern ontario river and examined the inﬂuence of ﬂow on these characteristics by comparing our measurements with those estimated for a lake at the same latitude based on published studies. pike ranged in total length from 229 to 784 mm, in mass from 70 to 4250 g, and in age from 1 to 10 years. the population showed a preponderance of 2–5-year olds, with few ﬁsh surviving beyond 7 years of age. growth, in terms of length increase, was similar to that reported for circumpolar populations. mean total length at 5 years of age was 577 mm, )1, growth was isometric, growth rate of young adults was 62.5 mm year longevity was 10 years of age, and the adult annual mortality rate was 49%. growth and mortality characteristics of this riverine population were similar to those estimated for a lacustrine population at the same latitude. flow thus had little measurable effect on the growth or mortality of pike possibly because of the overwhelming effect of other abiotic variables such as temperature, length of growing season and productivity. consequently, growth characteristics of lacustrine populations can be used to assess the health and condition of riverine populations. r. w. grifﬁths1, n. k. newlands1, d. l. g. noakes1, f. w. h. beamish2 1department of zoology and axelrod institute of ichthyology, university of guelph, guelph, canada,

accounts for the increase in ﬁsh biomass and, mortality is the chief process that accounts for the decrease in ﬁsh biomass. consequently, understanding the effects of various environmental variables on growth and mortality is important to ﬁshery assessment. growth appears to be sensitive to many environmental factors such as water temperature, length of growing season, photo- period and productivity (miller & kennedy 1948; casselman 1978; brett 1979; diana 1983). in contrast, natural ﬁsh mortality is seldom shown to be inﬂuenced by environmental variables, although longevity may 136 be related to water temperature (miller & kennedy 1948). northern pike, esox lucius, is widely distributed in north america occurring in cool water, weedy environments and frequenting both ﬂowing (riverine) and non-ﬂowing (lacustrine) ecosystems (casselman 1996; scott & crossman 1973). in northern ontario, pike is common throughout the moose river and the other major river systems draining these lowlands to hudson bay (scott & crossman 1973) and is a signiﬁcant species to the aboriginal, recreational and commercial ﬁshery (brousseau & goodchild 1989). unfortunately, resource developments associated with hydroelectric production, pulp and paper manu- facturing, and mining operations also occur within these basins. assessment of these the effects of developments on pike populations, and predictions of effects from further developments, has rarely occurred because of the lack of data characterising these northern populations. while riverine systems are the main aquatic feature on the northern ontario landscape, lacustrine systems are the main source of ﬁsheries data and information (ryder & pesendorfer 1989). differences in ﬁsh production, abundance and size have been suggested between rivers and lakes (pierce and tomcko 2003; welcomme et al. 1989; randall et al. 1995). flow thus may inﬂuence the growth and mortality of game ﬁshes such as pike. consequently, it is unclear whether the health and status of populations in riverine systems can be assessed from information derived from lacustrine systems. this study assessed the growth and mortality characteristics of the northern pike population occur- ring at the conﬂuence of the groundhog and matta- gami rivers in the moose river system that was under little stress from development or ﬁshing. to speciﬁc- ally examine the inﬂuence of ﬂow, these characteris- tics were compared with those estimated for a lacustrine population at the same latitude based on published studies. study region basin drains the moose river approximately 109,000 km2 of precambrian shield and hudson bay lowland (paleozoic) lands in northern ontario into james bay (brousseau & goodchild 1989). our study ¢ concentrated on a 35 km length of river (49°45 n, ¢ 81°54 e), encompassing the conﬂuence of the matta- gami and groundhog rivers (see noakes et al. 1999). the mattagami river has a mean discharge of )1, while the groundhog approximately 114 m3 s )1 (brousseau river has a mean discharge of 145 m3 s & goodchild 1989). several dams are located along the mattagami river and have the ability to regulate the discharge of the river. daily water depth ﬂuctua- tions up to 40 cm (mckinley et al. 1993) are typical for the study area. only a single dam is located on a table 1. chemical

data from the ontario water quality monitoring network (ministry of environment, unpublished data) for 1989 and 1990 indicates that the water of these rivers is low in nutrients and phosphorus limited

drain to the river and maximal during winter when the rivers are frozen. daytime dissolved oxygen concentrations vary )1 in the groundhog river and from 8 to 13 mg l )1 in the mattagami river, with minimum 7–13 mg l concentrations measured in the summer as a result of higher water temperatures. maximum summer water temperature was 20 °c during 1990–1993. ice typically covers these rivers from december to may. annual mean air temperature is estimated at 0.6 °c. annual mean precipitation of 66 cm in rainfall and 241.3 cm in snowfall occur at moosonee, ontario, located at the mouth of the moose river. materials and methods the northern pike collected for this study were the incidental catch from a lake sturgeon study (noakes et al. 1999). fish were captured with experimental gill nets, set in gangs, during july 1991, from may to august 1992, and throughout june 1993. each net gang was 121 m long by 2 m high with mesh sizes of 2.5–12.5 cm (stretched measure). nets were anchored to the bottom and oriented to prevent competition between nets. each day, nets were set at two or three sites. an overnight and daytime set (12 h each) was made at each site. this procedure was repeated daily so that the entire study area was sampled each year. we measured mass (±0.01 kg), fork length (±1 mm) and total length (±1 mm) of each animal. we estima- ted the age of each pike by counting the

(april) grifﬁths et al. we assessed growth from several perspectives. our ﬁrst measure of growth involved estimating the growth parameters l¥ and k from length-at-age data using the von bertalannfy growth function (vbgf): lðtþ ¼ l1½1   e kðt t0þ; where l(t) is the total length (mm) of a ﬁsh at age t (years), coefﬁcient (year l¥ is the asymptotic length (mm), k is a growth )1), and t0 is age (years) when l ¼ 0. computer programs of nash & walker (1987) and ratkowsky (1986) were used to obtain parameter estimates. standard errors for parameter estimates were calculated using the nlin procedure of sas, statistica, and sigmaplot software. our second measure of growth involved comparing the change in length-at-age across age classes 3–7 with that of the established circumpolar ‘standard growth’ developed by casselman (1996). length-at-age for each age class was expressed as a percentage of this growth standard. our third measure of growth involved calculating mean total length (mm) for 5-year-old northern pike. this was simply the average length of all 5-year-old pike caught. our fourth measure of growth involved estimating the proportional stock density (psd) of anderson & weithman (1978). this proposed index uses the length–frequency distribution to measure the percent- age of the stock that is greater than a set quality length. quality length was set at 530 mm, while stock length was set at 350 mm. our ﬁfth measure of growth involved estimating the growth rate of young adults. a linear regression was ﬁt through length-at-age data for age classes 3–8 from )1) our site to estimate the mean growth rate (mm year over this period (slope) and ‘initial length’ (intercept). initial length is simply an index of length (mm) of the 0+ age class. finally, our sixth measure of growth involved estimating the condition exponent of the pike popu- lation (i.e. body condition). this condition exponent was equal to the slope of the linear regression between log-transformed mass (g) and log-transformed total length (mm). total annual mortality of adult pike (ages 3–7) was calculated from catch curve analysis (ricker 1975). longevity was calculated simply as the age of the oldest ﬁsh caught. to examine the inﬂuence of ﬂow, we compared our estimate of mean total length at 5 years of age, growth rate and initial length of young adults, and longevity with that estimated for a lake at the same latitude. these lake estimates were constructed using data from published lacustrine studies that span the range of northern pike in north america (rawson 138 the potential error 1932; van engel 1940; roach 1942; miller & kennedy 1948; clark & steinback 1959; rawson 1959; buss & miller 1961; wainio 1966; maccrim- mon & skobe 1970; koshinsky 1972; margenau et al. 1998). because of in interpreting age from scales from older (>8 years) pike (casselman 1990, 1996), we limited the data from published studies to age groups from 2 to 8 years. linear or polynomial regressions were ﬁtted by least squares between each variable and the latitude of the study lakes. this regression was used to predict the lake value at the same latitude as our study site (49.5°n). as the environmental variables commonly suggested to effect growth and longevity of pike in lakes are correlated with latitude, at least a ﬁrst-order approximation, these regressions were able to provide growth and longevity estimates adjusted for the environmental conditions existing at the latitude of our study site. lake populations no relationship with latitude was found for total adult annual mortality, body condition exponent or psd. an annual adult natural mortality rate of 37–57% for in wisconsin and minnesota (latta 1972; pierce et al. 1995; margenau et al. 1998) was used as our estimate for a lake population at the same latitude as our study site. as a condition exponent of 3.0 was observed in most lake populations (doyon et al. 1988; randall & minns 2000), we accepted it for our lake estimate. finally, a psd within the range of 30–60% was used as our lake estimate to indicate a balanced size structure for pike (anderson & weithman 1978). finally, our von bertalannfy growth function was compared with those estimated from ontario (omnr 1983) and circumpolar (casselman 1996) waters, which primarily summarised pike growth in lacustrine systems, although a few riverine populations were included in both data sets. results we collected 152 northern pike over three sampling years. these ﬁsh ranged in total length from 229 to 784 mm, in mass from 70 to 4250 g, and in age from 1 to 10 years. the relationship between fork (fl) and total (tl) lengths was: fl ¼  0:47 þ 0:95tl ðr2 ¼ 0:99; n ¼ 152þ: the age structure of the pike population (fig. 1) showed a preponderance of 2–5-year-old individuals. the under-representation of age 1 individuals likely indicates that the sampling gear only collected the faster growing individuals of this age class. however, it is possible that young ﬁsh live elsewhere in this system and immigrate to the study site after a speciﬁc y c n e u q e r f e g a t n e c r e p 25 20 15 10 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 age

older individuals were shorter. as the sampling gear is capable of collecting ﬁsh within the size range of these older individuals, these data suggest that few ﬁsh in this population survive more than 7 years. the catch data implied an instantaneous mortality rate of 0.68 (r2 ¼ 0.84) between 3 and 8 years of age, which is equivalent to an annual total adult mortality rate of 49% per year. this mortality rate suggests that less than 1% of age 1 pike survive until the age 8. the estimated total annual mortality rate of 49% is within the natural mortality rate of 37–57% estimated for lakes. the largest component of the distribution of pike biomass by age class followed a unimodal pattern with 5-year-old pike accounting for the population biomass at 26% (fig. 2). this pattern infers that during the ﬁrst 5 years, pike growth contributes more biomass to the population than is losses contributed by through mortality exceeds growth. through mortality, but thereafter, that lost pike length increased annually from age 1 to 10, although the rate of increase slowly declined with age individual growth in this (fig. 3). mean annual population was described by the vbgf as: lðtþ ¼ 984½1   e 0:132ðtþ1:595þ: the standard error of l¥ was ±131, k was ±0.036 and t0 was ±0.426. growth tended to be less than that described from ontario waters, but very similar to that described from circumpolar waters, particularly for ages 3–7 (fig. 3). in fact, mean pike lengths for ages 3–7 were 92–103% of that estimated for circumpolar waters (fig. 4). almost 30% of the population was between 480 and 560 mm in length. the mean total length for 5-year-old pike was slightly longer than average at 577 mm. this agrees closely with the predicted total length of 570 mm for 5-year-old pike in a latitude (fig. 5). the proportional lake at similar stock density was 30.3%, which is at the lower range deﬁning a balanced cool-water lake popula- tion. the average growth rate of young adult pike in our )1. this agrees closely to study area was 62.5 mm year )1 estimated for pike from a lake at the 58.3 mm year the same latitude (fig. 6a). furthermore, the initial length of pike in our study area was 258 mm. this was similar to the 245 mm estimated for pike from a similar latitudinal lake (fig. 6b). 139 grifﬁths et al. 800 700 600 500 400 300 ) m m ( t h g n e l l a t o t ontario waters  t h

vbgf is the von bertalannfy growth function (n ¼ 152). the relationship between tl in mm and mass (m) fig. 7 in g was: log m ¼  5:41þ 3:08 log tl ðr2 ¼ 0:98;n ¼ 152þ: the slope of this relationship was not signiﬁcantly different from 3 (t-test, p > 0.50) which suggests that ﬁsh growth in the study area was isometric. once again this is similar to that predicted for pike populations in lakes. the maximum age of pike in our study area was 10 years. this was just slightly less than 12.5 years predicted for a similar latitudinal lake (fig. 8a). discussion flow had little measurable effect on growth or mortality of northern pike. individual growth, mortality and longevity characteristics for northern pike at the conﬂuence of the groundhog and mattagami rivers were similar to those estimated for a lake at the same latitude. however, when considered together, these characteristics hint that ﬂowing water habitats may be slightly more productive as the initial length of pike, young adult growth rate, length at 5 years, and body condition exponent were all slightly higher than those estimated for lakes, while longevity was slightly lower. 140 120 115 110 105 100 95 90 85 80 3 4 5

populations (standard growth) (casselman 1996). further data from other riverine populations will be necessary to validate this point. notwithstanding, growth and mortality characteristics of pike can be considered comparable between river and lake popula- tions likely because other abiotic variables, e.g. tem- perature and length of growing season (frost & kipling 1967), are the dominant factors inﬂuencing pike growth in both ﬂowing and non-ﬂowing freshwater systems. signiﬁcant regressions between total length at 5 years, growth rate of young adults, initial length, longevity and latitude were expected. primary abiotic variables thought to control growth such as tempera- ture, length of growing season, photoperiod and productivity (miller & kennedy 1948; frost & kipling 1967; brett 1979; diana 1983; welcomme et al. 1989) decline with latitude (ﬁrst-order approximation) as does lake ﬁsh production (downing & plante 1993). unexpectedly, the growth rate of young adults showed a curvilinear response to latitude, declining linearly from 40° to about 52°n and then remaining constant at )1 thereafter. this constant growth about 48 mm year rate in northern populations may reﬂect an adaptation to climatic conditions. length-at-age measures (e.g. initial length, length at 5 years) declined linearly with latitude reﬂecting slower growth in northern populations. with age, the slope of this relationship steepens as a consequence of r 2 = 0.78 800 700 600 500 400 s r a e y 5 t a ) m m ( h t g n e l l a t o t y = 1387 – 16.5x 300 30 40 50 latitude (°n) 60 70 fig. 5.

(1998). the differential in growth rates with latitude. our initial length values only provide an index of length after the ﬁrst growing season. in august, young-of-the-year pike were reported to be 168–251 mm in length in lakes at latitudes from 43° to 50°n (carlander 1969; casselman & harvey 1973). as pike continue to grow at low temperature (diana 1983; craig & babaluk 1989), these animals likely continued to increase until the end of the year. our initial length values for pike at these latitudes ranged from 230–380 mm which are likely about one-third higher than actual. this differ- ence results from the high growth rate of young- of-the-year pike relative to that of young adults. longevity appears to be related to the length of time required to reach a speciﬁc length; thus slower growing pike live longer than faster growing pike. maximum individual length was not correlated with latitude; large pike (>1200 mm) have been reported across their range from ohio to the northwest territories (carlander 1969). the average length of pike in the oldest age class across its range was estimated to be 950 mm using the data provided by carlander (1969). setting this ‘attainable length’ equal to the initial length plus n times the growth rate (see fig. 6 for regression equations), then longevity (n) can be expressed as a function of latitude (fig. 8b). this relationship indicates that to reach this ‘attainable growth of e. lucius in rivers and lakes r 2 = 0.80 y = 683.1 – 28.78x + 0.4353x 2 – 0.0022x 3 40 50 60 70 r 2 = 0.82 (a) 100 ) 1 – r a e y m m  ( e t a r h t w o r g 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 (b) 400 ) m m ( e z s l i a i t i n i 300 200 100 y = 688.5 – 8.97x 0 30 40 50 latitude (°n) 60 70 fig. 6. relationship (linear regression) between (a) growth rate of young adult northern pike populations with latitude and (b) initial size of northern pike populations with latitude. solid square denotes data from mattagami and groundhog rivers. source data: rawson (1932); van engel (1940); roach (1942); miller & kennedy (1948); clark & steinback (1959); rawson (1959); buss & miller (1961); wainio (1966); maccrimmon & skobe (1970); koshinsky (1972); latta (1972). length’, pike require 7 years in the south but 20 years in the north. this predicted longevity range matches well with longevity observations (carlander 1969; scott & crossman 1973); a linear regression through the predicted values (fig. 8b) gives a relationship close to that seen for literature values (fig. 8a). 141 grifﬁths et al. y = – 5.41 + 3.08x r 2 = 0.98 4 3 2 ) g ( s s a m g o  l 1 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.7 log total length (mm) 2.6 2.8 2.9 fig. 7. relationship (linear regression) between log-transformed mass and log-transformed total length of northern pike in the conﬂuence area of the mattagami and groundhog rivers during 1991–1993 (n ¼ 152). natural adult mortality was not correlated with latitude. mortality was expected to decline with latitude as longevity was positively correlated with lati- tude. high adult mortality rates in northern popula- tions would provide little opportunity for pike surviving into old age, unless the abundance of pike was considerably greater than in southern lakes. it is possible that lack of data especially from the north may have hampered our ability to ﬁnd a relationship or that adult mortality is more sensitive to biotic factors than abiotic factors. pierce and tomcko (2003), however, noted that total annual adult mortality was not a function of pike production or density in seven minnesota lakes. total mortality rates varied from 36 to 63% in these ﬁshed lakes. another possibility is that the natural mortality rate of young-of-the-year pike may have more effect on longevity than adult mortality. mortality within the ﬁrst year is consider- ably higher than adult mortality rates. grimm & klinge (1996) reported 80% mortality of young- of-the-year pike from may through mid-july in stocked ponds, a value equal to that which they derived from the literature, with cannibalism poten- tially an important source of natural mortality (kipling & frost 1970; craig & kipling 1983). furthermore, strong year classes are linked to good survival of 0+ pike (grimm & klinge 1996). higher densities 142 y = – 10.68 + 0.47x r 2 = 0.64 30 40 50 60 70 y = – 9.06 + 0.43x (a) 25 ) s r a e y ( y t i v e g n o l 20 15 10 5 0 (b) 25 ) s r a e y ( y t i v e g n o l d e t c d e r p i 20 15 10 5 0 30 40 50 latitude (°n) 60 70 regression) between longevity fig. 8.

(b) predicted longevity over latitude to reach a maximum length of 950 mm based on initial length and growth rate functions in fig. 6. linear regression is best ﬁt line through predicted values. resulting from good survival of 0+ pike reduces subsequent growth (pierce et al. 2003) which would promote a longer life span. the ﬁshing intensity of an estimated 300 kg of northern pike per year over a 45 km stretch of the (brousseau & goodchild 1989) groundhog river appears to have no measurable effect on this population. characteristics of stressed ﬁsh populations the size and life span of in 1965, include: small size and weight, short life span, rapid growth and high total adult mortality. the northern pike population in heming lake, manitoba, (latitude of 53°n) was intensively harvested for over a decade this and in response, population declined (lawler 1965). the predominate length class of pike was only 320– 360 mm, the growth coefﬁcient, k, was 0.141, most were 2 years of age and few pike reached the age of 5 years (macdonald 1987). in our study area, the predominate length class was considerably longer (480–560 mm), growth was slower (k ¼ 0.132), ﬁsh were typically 4 and 5 years of age and ﬁsh reached the age of 10 years. additional, the psd was 30.3% of the population, which suggests a balanced size structure. psd values ranged from 5 to 37% for lakes in minnesota (pierce et al. 1995) and from 3 to 90% for lakes in wisconsin (margenau et al. 1998); in both cases psd was inversely related to the total abundance of pike, with smaller values indicating a high abundance of small individuals. the growth coefﬁcient, k, was similar to that for pike in circumpolar waters; mean lengths of 3–7-year-old pike were equal to the circumpolar growth standard. furthermore, the growth coefﬁcient was lower than those for pike populations from ﬁshed minnesota lakes (pierce and tomcko 2003). finally the annual adult mortality rate was considered average for pike populations. the estimated value may be an underestimate because of the capture using graded gill net gangs (hamley and regier 1973), still it is at the lower range of values estimated for ﬁshed minnesota lakes (pierce and tomcko 2003) and well below the critical value of almost 70% used to indicate overex- ploitation (omnr 1983). thus indications of a balance size structure, slower growth and lower adult mortality relative to ﬁshed lakes further the case that this population is not overexploited or unduly stressed and that it can be used as a satisfactory reference to evaluate other pike populations in northern ontario rivers. resumen 1. caracterizamos el crecimiento y la mortalidad de esox lucius en la conﬂuencia de los rı´os mattagami y groundhog de la cuenca del rı´o moose

peces fueron capturados con redes de agalla en julio del an˜ o 1991, de mayo a agosto de 1992 y a lo largo de junio del an˜ o 1993. 2. los peces variaron en longitud entre 229 y 784 mm, en peso entre 70 y 4250 g y en edad entre 1 a 10 an˜ os. las clases de 2 a 5 an˜ os fueron predominantes con pocos individuos sobreviviendo mas alla´ de la edad 7 (figura 1). la distribucio´ n de la biomasa por clase de edad revelo´ un patro´ n unimodal con individuos de 5 an˜ os contribuyendo el mayor componente (26 %, figura 2). este patro´ n supone que la biomasa de la poblacio´ n incrementa durante los 5 growth of e. lucius in rivers and lakes primeros an˜ os de vida cuando el crecimiento excede las perdidas por mortalidad para posteriormente declinar cuando las pe´rdidas por mortalidad exceden al crecimiento. 3. el crecimiento en te´rminos de incrementos en longitud fue similar al observado en otras poblaciones circumpolares (figuras 3 y 4). la longitud total media a los 5 an˜ os de edad fue 577 mm, la tasas de )1, el crecimiento fue crecimiento de adultos jo´ venes 62 mm an˜ o isome´trico, la longevidad 10 an˜ os y la tasa anual de mortalidad el 49%. las caracterı´sticas de crecimiento y la mortalidad de la poblacio´ n del rı´o fueron similares a las estimadas para una poblacio´ n lacustre localizada a la misma latitud (figuras 5, 6 y 8). 4. el caudal tiene ası´ pocos efectos mensurables sobre el crecimiento o la mortalidad posiblemente por los importantes efectos de otras variables abio´ ticas tales como la temperatura, la longitud del periodo de crecimiento y la productividad. consec- uentemente, las caracterı´sticas de las poblaciones lacustres pueden ser utilizadas para evaluar la salud y condicio´ n de las poblaciones ﬂuviales. acknowledgements the study
