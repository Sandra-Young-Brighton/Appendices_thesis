ehrenfeld 2003) and biodiversity have been of special interest in recent years (callaway & maron 2006). exotic species are often regarded as a major threat to natural systems and an economic burden (vitousek et al. 1997; keane & crawley 2002). the invasion of habitats with exotic species is quite often directly linked to human disturbance and land- use change (mack et al. 2000), as intact ecosystems can resist invasion to a certain degree (seabloom 2003). habitats that are profoundly altered by humans may be dominated by invasive species that are generalists with effective means of dispersal. lagarosiphon major (hereafter lagarosiphon) is an exotic macrophyte species that (ridley) moss is a threat quickly established throughout new zealand after introduction in the 1950s. it to native biodiversity because of its ability to outcompete and replace native macrophyte species (howard-williams & davies 1988; rattray et al. 1994). besides the impact on the biodiversity of native macrophytes (and associated invertebrates), lagarosiphon may also have far reaching impacts on local physico-chemical water properties as the tall stands might interfere with effective exchange of water. gradients, as a result of oxygen depletion during night, and an increase in ph during photosynthetic activity might be detrimental to ﬁshes and invertebrates. similar effects have been demonstrated in other dense-growing macrophytes (cheruvelil et al. 2001). because of the high density and biomass of lagarosiphon, management becomes necessary to 10 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00249.x invasive macrophyte lagarosiphon major and littoral ﬁsh prevent further spread, restore native macrophytes and improve recreational values of waterways (johnstone 1986; van nes et al. 2002). however, despite the negative impacts of this invading species, it is likely to perform the multiple beneﬁcial functions of macro- phytes in lake ecosystems (carpenter & lodge 1986), including the support of a high density of invertebrates (biggs & malthus 1982; kelly & hawes 2005) as food, and presumably shelter for ﬁsh. that are curled back towards lagarosiphon is a structurally complex plant across several spatial scales: (i) it has a high number of small leaves the stem, effectively creating a sheltered habitat; (ii) the stems display a high degree of ramiﬁcation and (iii) the stands are very tall creating a complex three-dimen- sional structure. generally, more complex macro- phytes are known to support a higher invertebrate diversity and ⁄ or biomass. very dense macrophyte stands can create shelter from predation for both ﬁsh and invertebrates (chick & mcivor 1994; diehl & kornijow 1997; grenouillet et al. 2000). based on this, we would expect lagarosiphon to be a good habitat provider for invertebrates and ﬁsh, as has already been demonstrated in other systems including lake wanaka and the clutha river (biggs & malthus 1982; kelly & hawes 2005). however, the lagarosi- phon infestations in these systems are of much smaller scale and intermixed with native macrophyte species, when compared with lake dunstan that features monospeciﬁc and massive lagarosiphon beds. hence, there is a degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the habitat value of lagarosiphon in the case of lake dunstan. it lake dunstan is a large hydro lake (approximately 30 km2) in central otago, new zealand, heavily infested with lagarosiphon. currently, lagarosiphon is forming surface reaching stands from the lake margin down to its physiological limit of 6 m depth (coffey & wah 1988), where it occupies virtually 100% of the available littoral area and forms a continuous monospeciﬁc macrophyte belt along the entire lake shoreline (strickland et al. 2000). because of its enormous biomass and the large area covered by lagarosiphon, is believed to inﬂuence the lake dunstan ecosystem signiﬁcantly. therefore, large- scale eradication of lagarosiphon from lake dunstan may have negative impacts on the abundance of native ﬁsh species (common bully) in this lake. generally, reduction of macrophyte biomass and diversity can result in community composition, a reduction in ﬁsh abundance in the littoral and a shift towards pelagic species (maceina et al. 1991; bettoli et al. 1993), and modiﬁcation of foraging behaviour (sammons et al. 2003). however, excessive densities of macrophytes, which are often the case with invasive species, are thought to interfere with prey capture and in changes the foraging success of ﬁsh, but this clearly depends on plant type and architecture, ﬁsh size and species (diehl 1993; brown & maceina 2002; warfe & barmuta 2004). small ﬁsh species like common bully (gobiomorphus cotidianus: eleotridae; mcdowall 1975) that are present in lake dunstan might be less disadvantaged from this perspective. to assist with macrophyte management strategies in lake dunstan, we investigated the value of lagaro- siphon as a ﬁsh habitat. speciﬁcally, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) common bullies are closely associated with lagarosiphon on a small-scale; (ii) large-scale common bully distribution is related to environmental factors including lagarosiphon den- sity and (iii) bully diet contains invertebrates that are common on lagarosiphon (e.g., mollusca and trichoptera) as this macrophyte is an important feeding area in the lake dunstan littoral. materials and methods study area this study was completed within the littoral of lake dunstan, central otago, new zealand (45°02¢s, 169°12¢e). lake dunstan is a large oligotrophic hydroelectric lake (approximately 30.55 km2, vol. 0.370 km3, max depth 60 m, mean depth 12.1 m, hydraulic residence time 6.4 days), the result of the impoundment of the clutha and kawarau rivers (schallenberg & burns 1997). lake dunstan is a comparatively new system, only reaching its full operational level in 1993. source water for the clutha )1, max (mean ﬂow rate 387 m3æs )1, 909 m3æs )1) comes from lakes min 102 m3æs wanaka ⁄ hawea and lake wakatipu, respectively (fig. 1). the enormous size of the source systems for the kawarau and clutha rivers result in a very stable physical and chemical environment in the lake year round [mean surface temperature 11 °c (min )1 (±1.09 7 °c max 17 °c), mean oxygen 11.29 mgæl sd)] (leach 1997). lake dunstan has a sparse zooplankton community, presumably because of the short hydraulic retention time of the lake. )1) and kawarau rivers (mean 240 m3æs )1, min 199 m3æs )1, max 630 m3æs although lake dunstan is an artiﬁcial lake used to generate electricity, daily water level ﬂuctuation is restricted to 1 m (i.e., operational levels range between 193.5 and 194.5 msl) to adjust power generation to daily ﬂuctuations in energy demand. the study was restricted to the clutha arm of lake dunstan as it is the largest part of the lake (approximately 19.06 km2, vol. 0.177 km3, max depth 23 m, mean depth 9.3 m, hydraulic residence time 7.7 days) (schallenberg & burns 1997) with extensive shallow areas providing a suitable habitat for macrophyte growth. the eastern 11 bickel & closs lake dunstan lake wanaka lake hawea clutha arm lake wakatipu clutha river kawarau arm kawarau river n 10 km dunstan arm 10 km clyde dam fig. 1. the clutha system (left) is situated on the south island of new zealand (top left inlay). lake dunstan, downstream of lakes wakatipu, wanaka and hawea, consists of three arms (right). this study was restricted to the clutha arm. arrows indicate the direction of ﬂow. bullies and invertebrates were sampled within 30 random sites scattered throughout the clutha arm of lake dunstan. side of the clutha arm is characterised by a steep topography and rocky shores; the western site features gravely beaches with a variety of slopes and small inlets and bays. lagarosiphon density is highest in the northern end of the lake (clutha river inﬂow). there are records of other macrophyte species beyond the lagarosiphon belt in deeper water, consisting mainly of elodea canadensis, potamogeton cheesemanii, p. ochreatus and charophytes (own observation and strickland & asher 1998) but these communities have never been quantiﬁed. however, because of the low average depth of 9.3 m of the temporal high inﬂow of glacial silts and the distribu- tion of lagarosiphon down to about 6.5 m (strickland this tall vascular et al. 2000), community beyond the lagarosiphon belt is not comparable to the lagarosiphon stands in either total biomass or factors (turbidity, steep shoreline and rocky substrate) are less favourable for macrophyte growth in the other arms of the lake. cover. environmental the clutha arm, it is assumed that aerial fish sampling lake dunstan has a species-poor ﬁsh community typical for new zealand high country lakes that are generally numerically dominated by only three spe- cies: the native species common bully (gobiomorphus cotidianus: eleotridae), and the introduced rainbow and brown_trout (salmo_trutta, oncorhynchus_mykiss: salmonidae). because of the high mobility of trout, only common bully distribution was studied here. to investigate the spatial and temporal variability in small littoral ﬁsh (common bully) biomass, bullies were caught within 30 randomly chosen sites within the littoral of the clutha arm of lake dunstan between march 2004 and april 2005. sampling 12 periods covered three seasons (summer: december– february; autumn: march–may and winter: june). to study the ﬁne-scale distribution of common bullies in relation to the lagarosiphon stands, we placed multiple ﬁsh traps vertically and horizontally within the lagarosiphon belt in each site. within each site, the lagarosiphon belt was divided into the three zones: ‘in’ (inside the belt), ‘edge’ (on the inshore margin of the lagarosiphon belt) and ‘out’ (in the lagarosiphon free area between lake shore and the continuous lagarosiphon belt). as lagarosiphon stands were between 1 m and 3 m tall in the ‘in’ and ‘edge’ zones, trap positions were further divided into two vertical levels: top (on top of the macro- phytes) and bottom (bottom of the macrophyte beds). however, we found no difference in top versus bottom (kruskal–wallis test: v2 = 2.459, d = 4, p = 0.652) and pooled the data for subsequent analysis. in each site, 15 unbaited ‘minnow traps’ (gansell, milperra, australia) with 1 mm mesh and a 7-cm diameter opening at each end were randomly set overnight (mean trap time 20.9 h ± 1.6 h sd). average trap depth was comparable between sites with the follow- ing average trap depths in the plots: 0.9 ± 0.5 m sd ‘out’, 1.5 ± 0.6 m sd ‘edge’, and 2.2 ± 0.7 m sd ‘in’. next morning, all traps were retrieved and all bullies counted and measured (total length in mm), after which the ﬁsh were released immediately. a diver recorded several environmental variables at each site: slope (shore gradient), lagarosiphon can- )2), opy height (cm), aerial biomass (g dry massæm )2), and water tem- lagarosiphon stem density (næm perature (°c). water temperature, canopy height, aerial biomass and stem density was recorded at three random locations in the ‘in’, ‘edge’ and ‘out’ areas. values were averaged by sites for later statistical invasive macrophyte lagarosiphon major and littoral ﬁsh analysis. slope was measured along two transects running perpendicular to the shoreline and averaged for sites. diet analysis to investigate common bully diet, random individuals were retained from the spatial analysis (up to nine ﬁsh per site). bullies from a range of sizes (18 mm– 125 mm) were euthanized and frozen at )20 °c for later processing. in the laboratory, retained bullies were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g and measured to the nearest 1 mm (total length). a regression analysis (r2 = 0.97) was performed (n = 293 bullies, ﬁsh from all seasons included) to establish a length–mass model, so the weight of bullies could be estimated from the length measurements recorded in the ﬁeld. mf ¼ l3:5 t  1:43  10 06 where mf = fresh mass in g and lt = total length in mm. for diet analyses of bullies, the entire digestive track was removed from the ﬁsh and all invertebrates were identiﬁed under a dissecting microscope to the lowest practical taxonomic unit (species or family) after winterbourn et al. (2000). results of ﬁsh diet are presented in two ways, as an ordination plot derived from the average abundance of each food item in the ﬁsh diet and as a plot showing % biomass contribution of diet groups. biomass of invertebrates in the diet was estimated using previously established mean mass values for the most common species (data not published) and from published values of rarer species (stoffels et al. 2003b). to account the high proportion of inorganic components in mollusca, ash free dry mass was estimated instead of dry mass as for the other organisms. for to compare ﬁsh diet composition and the available invertebrate community in the littoral, invertebrate samples were collected in lagarosiphon stands. lag- arosiphon samples were collected by scuba diving (using 250 lm mesh bags) in the same ‘bully collec- tion’ sites following the same site layout [20 samples in each site (ﬁve samples in the four areas with lagarosiphon stands), 600 in total]. the mesh bags were carefully lowered over several stems of lagaro- siphon and closed with a drawstring to prevent the loss of invertebrates. additionally, random benthic samples were collected both from the bottom of the lagaro- siphon beds (in) and in the cobbly ⁄ rocky near shore ‘out’ area that lacked lagarosiphon growth. benthic invertebrates were sampled using a surber sampler modiﬁed for underwater sampling (stoffels et al. 2003a). invertebrate samples from macrophyte beds and benthic samples were processed as described for the ﬁsh gut samples. statistical analyses i.e., to account for differences in trapping time between sites, bully biomass was adjusted for trapping time and is expressed as catch per unit effort (cpue) biomass and abundance per trap and hour. to analyse large- scale temporal and spatial variation in the littoral of lake dunstan (between sites) total cpue biomass and abundance was calculated for each site; the summed biomass ⁄ abundance for each site. a multiple stepwise regression was used to investigate the relationship between measured environmental varia- bles and bully cpue biomass and abundance. to investigate ﬁne-scale distribution of bullies within sites, total cpue biomass was calculated for zones in each site. spss 10 for windows was used for all statistical analyses. data were square root transformed to meet requirements (normality and homoscedastic- ity) for anova and regression. nonparametric tests (kruskal–wallis test, mann–whitney u-test) were applied if the requirements for parametric anova were not met. similarity in diet between common bully and the invertebrate community in lagarosiphon and the benthos was investigated using an ordination (multi- dimensional scaling: mds; pc-ord 4.0 for windows) using the bray–curtis distance with procedures following the recommendations of the software pack- age (mccune & mefford 1999). the mds is presented as a biplot including calculated scores for invertebrate taxa that had more than 25% correlation with one of the ordination axes (pearson and kendall correlations >0.25). following ordination, we per- formed multi-response procedures (mrpp) to test for differences between groups (mcc- une & mefford 1999). permutation results large-scale temporal and spatial variation )1æh )1æh the distribution of average cpue bully biomass was patchy over the sites and ﬂuctuated widely between a )1 and a maximum of minimum of <1 gætrap )1 (fig. 2a). there was approximately 12 gætrap no signiﬁcant difference in bully biomass between the sampled seasons, summer, autumn, and winter (one- way anova: f = 2.966, d.f. = 2;

the rocky shore and the bottom of the lagaro- siphon were grouped closely together. the winter diet data of common bully appeared most similar to the benthic samples. diet data from the remaining

macrophyte belt compared with the shallow inshore lake margin. this is not surprising as macrophytes are known to play an important role in the littoral as a refuge from predators for juvenile and prey ﬁsh (damsga˚rd & ugedal 1997; werner & hall 1988). the high structural complexity of lagarosi- phon stands is likely to be a shelter from visually hunting predators present in the system, like trout or birds. predators tend to have a lower foraging success rate in habitats with high structural complexity because of either a reduced prey encounter rate or a reduction in capture success (diehl 1993; warfe & barmuta 2004). moreover, small ﬁsh can be actively attracted to areas with a high concentration of food (petty & grossman 1996), and macrophytes, in general, are areas of high invertebrate density (diehl 1993; crowder et al. 1998). it is not possible to say exactly why small ﬁsh actively seek the lagarosiphon beds, although it is likely to be a mixture of all three contributing factors. lagarosiphon density explained large-scale com- mon bully cpue biomass distribution only to a certain degree, and the regression depends on the highest lagarosiphon density measurements. common bullies were distributed patchily on a large-scale and this patchiness could not be further explained by other measured environmental variables (slope, invertebrate 16 invasive macrophyte lagarosiphon major and littoral ﬁsh biomass, water temperature and season). the high patchiness of biomass distribution indicated that even the monospeciﬁc lagarosiphon belt covering all available space in the littoral of lake dunstan is a heterogeneous environment from the perspective of a small ﬁsh species. further research is needed to investigate this phenomenon. there was a signiﬁcant seasonal variation in large- scale bully cpue abundance with higher numbers in the warmer summer and autumn months compared with winter, but this did not occur with bully cpue biomass. increased bully cpue abundance in summer and autumn months can best be explained by the breeding behaviour of this species in spring (stephens 1982; mcdowall 1990), but also increased activity as a result of higher temperatures and therefore possibly a higher catch rate (bias). the linear relationship temperature and bully abundance between water corroborates this pattern. additionally, the distance of sites from the clutha river inﬂow had an impact on bully abundance, with a reduction in bully abundance with greater distance from the inﬂow. it is not entirely clear how this pattern can be explained, but it may be related to the recruitment of common bully. after hatching, common bully larvae enter a planktonic stage before they settle in the littoral (mcdowall 1990). the short hydraulic residence time of lake dunstan (several days) might therefore impact on the recruitment of common bullies. bully larvae likely drift downstream along the lake, thus limiting the number of recruits available at the top end of the lake. common bully diet gut content analysis is the most direct way to investigate diet of ﬁsh species. however, results must be interpreted with some caution as it only represents a point in time assessment of diet. furthermore, results can be biased by the rapid digestion of soft-bodied invertebrates, resulting in over representation of hard- bodied invertebrates like snails and trichoptera (case) and chironomidae (head capsule). based on gut analysis, the diets of common bully in lake dunstan were dominated by invertebrate species found com- monly on macrophytes, including mollusca, trichop- tera larvae (i.e., hydroptilidae), chironomidae and larval odonata. all these invertebrates are found in high abundance on lagarosiphon (biggs & malthus 1982; kelly & hawes 2005). the species community on lagarosiphon in lake dunstan was similar to the common bully diet with identical species of chirono- midae, mollusca and trichoptera species. the benthic invertebrate community in the shallow littoral of lake dunstan, which was dominated by oligochates, appeared less similar to the diet of common bully, which contained very few oligochaetes. diet of common bully was also separated from the lagarosiphon and benthic invertebrate communities in the ordination. chironomidae larvae, chironomi- dae pupae and physa (mollusca) appeared to be ‘overrepresented’ in the bully diet when compared with the potamopyrgus (mollusca) ‘rich’ lagarosi- phon samples. nevertheless, chironomidae are still highly abundant in lagarosiphon considering the high standing crop of this macrophyte. conclusions we have established that common bullies were associated with lagarosiphon on a small-scale and that, on a large scale, lagarosiphon density explained bully cpue biomass to a certain degree. furthermore, bully diet consisted of invertebrates found in lagaro- siphon beds. that as l. major is a nuisance species, the results presented here suggest it can still play an important role as a feeding area for small ﬁsh species in the shallow littoral of lake dunstan. this macro- phyte species essentially fulﬁls the same ecological role that native macrophyte species would provide were they present. because of a scarcity of other macrophyte species, we could not compare the ecosystem functioning of lagarosiphon with other macrophytes. in systems that have both, lagarosiphon and native macrophyte species, lagarosiphon still performs very well as invertebrate and ﬁsh habitat, i.e., supports a higher invertebrate and ﬁsh abundance than native macrophytes (biggs & malthus 1982; kelly & hawes 2005). because of the extremely high biomass of lagaro- siphon in lake dunstan, it supports a high biomass of invertebrates, and therefore will have a strong inﬂu- ence on littoral productivity. restoration of a native macrophyte community in lake dunstan, even after complete removal of lagarosiphon, is currently unre- alistic, as the upstream presence of lagarosiphon will ensure rapid reestablishment of this pest. any macrophyte management strategy should therefore carefully weigh the costs and beneﬁts associated with macrophyte removal. this means that it would be better to tolerate invasive macrophyte species to a certain degree than ending up with no macrophytes at all (van nes et al. 2002). for the weed management of lake dunstan, the importance of lagarosiphon in the ecosystem has to be considered as large-scale rapid eradication of this macrophyte (currently not feasible) might have negative impacts on the lake ﬁsh commu- nity. at present, management should focus on small- scale local control in key areas to enhance recreational value of the lake and especially to prevent further spread of this invasive macrophyte to other waters by accidental transfer. 17 bickel & closs acknowledgements this study was funded by the clutha fisheries trust (cft). the zoology department, university of
