jordan and brayton, 1878) is native to gulf and atlantic slope drainages of the southeastern usa, principally the major drainages of georgia and south carolina (wood & mayden 1992). within this range it is abundant and widely distributed. in the little tennessee drainage, however, this species has been considered ‘introduced’ for the past 40 years (ramsey 1965; johnston et al. 1995). evidence for this assessment was based initially on its absence from museum collections (c. johnston, pers. comm.) and its appearance in the 1990s in main- stem tributaries (w. mclarney, pers. comm.). this species is a good candidate for detection of the introduction source, because all potential populations are within 300 km of the little tennessee sites where it has been collected. the true status of yellowﬁn shiner in the little tennessee drainage is uncertain for a variety of reasons. first, some species considered ‘native’ to the little tennessee are also found in rivers within the established native distribu- tion of yellowﬁn shiners, whereas others with similar distributions are considered ‘introduced’ (ramsey 1965; swift et al. 1986). in addition, the literature may be contradictory, these species as both native and introduced (johnston et al. 1995, north carolina division of water quality 2007– see http://h20.enr.state.nc.us/esb/bau.html). conse- quently, clariﬁcation of the historical ecology of n. lutipinnis may be useful for examining the com- bined history of vicariance and stream capture that has shaped the southeastern aquatic biota. reporting some of because of the relatively ancient geologic and hydrologic processes affecting biodiversity patterns in the southeastern usa, a phylogeographic approach to studying species introduction can be applied to establish the background pattern of genetic variation and differentiation among river drainages (avise 1992; baer 1998; turner & trexler 1998; roe et al. 2001; jones et al. 2006). in essence, gene tree data can be used to identify regional differentiation and enable one to ‘assign’ individuals of unknown origin to source regions (wares et al. 2005). these techniques also allow the identiﬁcation of allelic novelty in the sampled regions; an analysis of sequence data can phylogeography of n. lutipinnis in its ‘native’ range represent complex evolutionary dynamics in part because of well-characterised models of sequence evolution (hey et al. 1994). to this end, we surveyed patterns of genetic variation at one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene region across the distributional range of n. lutipinnis (fig. 1). the goal of this multilocus survey is to help in the identiﬁcation of source of the introduction, and to establish the historical basis for n. lutipinnis in the little tennessee. our study also provides a reassessment of earlier work on this species, based on electrophoretic data, by wood & mayden (1992). materials and methods we made observations on the presence of n. lutipinnis in coweeta creek, nc (a tributary of the little tennessee) between 1983 and 2003 using both visual observations and quantitative electroﬁshing (gross- man et al. 1998). coweeta creek is typical of many relatively undisturbed ﬁfth-order streams in the south- ern appalachian region. observations were made in three permanent sites of varying lengths: a 37-m site (1983–1992; grossman et al. 1998), a 30-m site (1984–1995; (freeman et al. 1988; grossman et al. 2006), and a 100-m site (1991–2003; g. d. grossman, unpublished data). sampling protocols and quantita- tive approaches are described in detail in grossman et al. (1998, 2006). for genetic analysis, we collected specimens via electroﬁshing from coweeta creek (little tennessee) and clear creek (savannah) and used specimens from museum and agency collections (table 1). whole ﬁsh were preserved in 95% undenatured ethanol. we digested 1 mg lateral muscle or caudal ﬁn tissue in lysis buffer with puregene (gentra systems) cell proteinase k, followed by precipitation isolation of genomic dna and quantiﬁcation on a nanodrop spectrophotometer. we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b region (mtcytb) using universal prim- ers glu-5¢ and cb2-3¢ from palumbi (1996) and the nuclear transferrin region (ntf) from wares et al. (2004) and wares (2009). the selected mitochondrial locus (cytochrome b) is one of the more variable and commonly used gene regions in ﬁsh population genet- ics, with the standard beneﬁts of analysing mitochon- drial data for such purposes (avise et al. 1987), whereas the nuclear transferrin gene is also typically variable within and among species and may reﬂect distinct evolutionary pressures (ford 2000). annealing temperatures for pcr of the two gene regions were 45° and 50°, respectively, with all other pcr conditions as in wares et al. (2004). amplicons were prepared for direct cycle sequencing using the exonuclease–phos- phatase reaction and bigdyes 3.1 sequencing kit (applied biosystems) as per harley et al. (2006). 539 scott et al. that specimens fig. 1. river drainages in which notropis lutipinnis was sampled. solid lines represent rivers or drainages in table 1 were collected (circles indicate collection locations, arrows indicate drain- age connection where ambiguous); the dashed lines indicate places where rivers join higher-order rivers (etowah) or rivers in which the sister species notropis chloro- cephalus can be found (catawba-wateree). map was generated from online map cre- ation (http://www.aquarius.ifm-geomar.de/); river drainage location and sample popula- tion locations are approximate, with speciﬁc collection information available in table 1. native range of n. lutipinnis is shown in dark grey (based on page & burr 1991 and http://nas.er.usgs.gov). table 1. sample sizes and locations for notropis lutipinnis. population latitude ⁄ longitude collection information n (cyt b) n (tf) coweeta (little tennessee) flat creek (chattahoochee) jenny (chattahoochee) beaver (flint) russell (etowah) oconee (altamaha) grove (savannah) beaverdam (savannah) double branch (savannah) clear creek (savannah) laurel (saluda ⁄ sc) broad mouth (saluda ⁄ sc) walnut (saluda ⁄ sc) gilkey (broad ⁄ sc) 35°04¢)83°27¢ 34°44¢)84°51¢ 34°36¢)83°49¢ 32°36¢)84°11¢ 34°25¢)84°04¢ 34°19¢)83°45¢ 34°22¢)83°36¢ 34°36¢)83°32¢ 34°11¢)82°14¢ 35°03¢)83°18¢ 34°46¢)82°20¢ 34°29¢)82°20¢ 34°22¢)82°08¢ 34°56¢)81°28¢ ph(2006–7) gmnh (bap-1101; mmh-02-61) gmnh (jcs-03-10) gmnh (bap1999jun07) gmnh (bjf-0503) gmnh (bap-1999-jun19; bap-1999-jun10c) gmnh (bap1999jun10b) gmnh (bap1999jun10a) sc-dnr (mcs092203) mc004.50–55 sc-dnr (mcs101305) sc-dnr (mcs101905) sc-dnr (mcs101105) sc-dnr (mcs04015) 28 14 16 8 9 45 9 18 2 6 5 4 7 5 52 16 2 7 8 41 10 11 3 0 8 4 4 11 following each population name is the river drainage in parentheses. specimens were obtained from collections at coweeta and clear creek; other specimens came from the georgia museum of natural history tissue collection (gmnh) or monitoring collections of south carolina department of natural resources (scdnr), with additional collection information indicated. speciﬁc museum accessions and voucher specimens are available for gmnh samples. we aligned and edited sequence data for ambigu- ities using codoncode aligner v. 2.01; low-quality data (ewing & green 1998) were scored as unknown, although ambiguous sites (phred scores 15–25) in the ntf locus were coded for subsequent haplotype analysis using phase 2.1.1 (stephens et al. 2001). for this analysis, we excluded individuals with >25% informative sites missing, and four of 28 variable sites that did not ﬁt the inﬁnite-alleles model (only two character states). of these excluded sites, three were parsimony-uninformative. we conducted the analysis in phase as per sotka et al. (2004). 540 to conﬁrm taxonomic identiﬁcation of study tissues, we aligned sequence data with data from the following sister species: notropis chlorocephalus, m. cashner, unpublished data; notropis chrosomus genbank af352262 and u01321; notropis blennius af117170-1; notropis potteri af117192-3; nocomis biguttatus micropogon af452077; clinostomus funduloides (j. p. wares, unpublished data). six individuals from the coweeta (nc) population were found to carry a mitochondrial haplotype identical to that of c. funduloides (j. p. wares and r. miller, unpublished data) and were ay486057; nocomis excluded from the subsequent analysis. in addition, a small number of ‘native’ range specimens were also found to either group with clinostomus or nocomis and were excluded as misidentiﬁed or ambiguous as well. these individuals are not included in table 1. we analysed sequence data for phylogenetic struc- ture at both gene regions using paup* v.4.0b10 (swofford 2002). in each case, the data were analysed under a simple parsimony criterion with gaps coding as missing data (in the case of indels in the ntf intron regions). we used a heuristic search with tree bisection reconnection branch swapping and simple sequence addition. support for phylogenetic structure was assessed using 1000 nonparametric bootstrap repli- cates of the data at each locus; majority-rule consensus of the best 1000 parsimony trees (maximum trees held to 1000 due to computation limitations) was also calculated. results are represented as midpoint-rooted phylograms due to inherent problems with rooting intraspeciﬁc gene trees (castelloe & templeton 1994) and similar representation to haplotype networks (wares et al. 2001). net nucleotide divergence (nei & li 1979) was estimated among major drainages at each locus using dnasp v.4.10.4 (rozas & rozas 1999), along with pa:ps ratios within drainages and ka:ks between drainages at the ntf locus. we calculated tajima’s d (tajima 1989) for all drainages at both loci, pooling populations within drainages to evaluate whether either sequenced data set deviated from the assump- tion of neutral evolution and constant population size. to evaluate heterogeneity and structure within and among river drainages, the analysis of molecular variance (amova) on pairwise distance was performed using arlequin v.3.1 (excofﬁer et al. 2005) with sample sites grouped by drainages; pairwise popula- tion fst was also calculated at this point. we excluded sites with >20% missing or ambiguous data from the analysis. we attempted to identify source popula- tion(s) for the little tennessee via both phylogenetic similarity (i.e., whether lt haplotypes are grouped with haplotypes from particular source regions) and minimal pairwise nucleotide divergence with other populations. differentiation (fst ⁄ 1 ) fst) was regressed against log (km) between sites (euclidean distance) and the regression examined with a mantel test using genalex v.6.0 (peakall & smouse 2006) as an examination of whether sites are longitudinally differentiated as suggested by wood & mayden (1992). pairwise genetic results we ﬁrst observed yellowﬁn shiners in coweeta creek in 1999, 16 years after we began sampling in the creek. yellowﬁn shiners were present only in the phylogeography of n. lutipinnis in its ‘native’ range 100-m site during the drought years of 1999–2002, although they were not observed in the 30-m site during the similarly severe drought of 1985–1988. yellowﬁn shiners were never abundant, ranging from 1 to 2 present per survey of the 100-m site. nonethe- less, in sites approximately 0.6 km downstream, yellowﬁn shiners were observed in higher abundances as early as 1996, though their abundances declined between 1996 and 1998 (g. grossman & m. farr, unpublished data). the ﬁnal mtcytb data set (genbank accessions fj604893–fj605094) included 479 aligned nucleo- tides; congeneric and other outgroup species. of the retained sequence data, 56 were phylogenetically informative, whereas 384 characters were invariant. the best set of maximum-parsimony trees required 158 steps; a representative tree is presented in fig. 2. this tree has high majority-rule consensus (>85%; most >95%) at all nodes among 1000 best trees but no bootstrap support >50% at any node. surprisingly, the coweeta creek (nc) population harbours 21 distinct haplotypes (in 28 individuals), 17 of them not shared with any other population. many of these haplotypes were located near the midpoint-rooted tree set, intermediate or basal to a clade that is predominantly comprised of individuals from the south carolina drainages and a clade dominated by georgia specimens. missing ⁄ ambigu- ous sites had little effect on haplotype placement; we obtained similar topologies from both reduced and jackknifed data sets. in both cases, some individuals with the most ‘missing’ data share haplotypes with individuals in more ‘derived’ portions of the tree. in addition, many individuals near the root have the least amount of missing data, with no statistical difference among populations as to the level of missing data at either end of the sequence data set (j. p. wares, unpublished data). the ‘root’ of the ntf data set (genbank fj604860–fj604892) comprised 562 characters; after reduction to haplotype data using the best-ﬁt results from phase, there were 33 distinct haplotypes, with 24 variable characters (15 parsimony informative), for the analysis. the ntf sequence data set was partitioned into intron (at both ends of the data set) and exon regions (tblastx of a 195-bp orf from sites 250–444 has 86% identity and e-value of 1e)25 with genbank accession af457152, cyprinus carpio transferrin; 84% identity and e-value of 2e)25 with accession af518744, carassius aura- tus). the best set of parsimony trees (combining intron and exon data) required 38 steps; a representative tree is shown in fig. 3, with high consensus among the trees (and similar topology when only exon data are analysed) but no strong bootstrap support. we observed two distinct clades, recovered in 100% of the mp trees and generally representing different 541 scott et al. sample sites. clade a comprised 94% individuals from the altamaha and flint drainages, whereas 97% of the populations in the b clade are from non- altamaha ⁄ flint drainages. examination of particular substitutions in macclade 4.08 (maddison & madd- ison 1992) indicated that there were six nonsynony- mous substitution events in the exon region in clade a and seven in clade b, with some substitutions occurring multiple times. from the coweeta (nc) population, eight distinct haplotypes were recovered, with ﬁve of them not shared with any other sampled location. we represented net divergence among drainages as da (nei & li 1979), averaged over all sequences and populations within a river drainage. a small number of sequences with large (>25%) amounts of missing data were excluded to provide the greatest 542 fig. 2. a representative mp phylogram (n = 1000) for the mtcytb gene region in notropis lutipinnis. minimum consensus for all nodes across 1000 trees is 85%, with 134 of 200 internal nodes recovered in 100% of maximum-parsimony trees. the number of individuals sharing a haplotype from a given sampled river drainage is indicated by the numbers within symbols (see key), with no number indicating a single individual. uniformly sequences were overlap of aligned nucleotides for comparison; these distributed excluded across sampled locations. at the mtcytb locus, mean diversity within basins (p = 0.0384 average across ﬁve river drainages) was an order of mag- nitude higher than the mean divergence among basins (mean da = 0.0066, table 2), indicating sig- levels of ancestral polymorphism shared niﬁcant among most basins. similarly, at the ntf locus, mean diversity within basins (average p = 0.0033) was much higher than the mean among-basin divergence of 0.0017 (table 3). tajima’s d values for each of the seven drainages are shown in table 4 and indicate no signiﬁcant deviation from the null model for the mtcytb data; at least a small portion of the ntf-coding sequence is signif- icantly positive (0.751, p < 0.05) in the altamaha phylogeography of n. lutipinnis in its ‘native’ range fig. 3. a representative mp tree (n = 1000) for the ntf gene region (inferred haplotypes) in notropis lutipinnis. clades a and b are recovered in 100% (strict consensus) of mp trees. other branches with >50% consensus are indicated by numbers under branch. the number of individuals sharing a haplotype from a given sampled river drainage are indicated by numbers in symbols (see key), with no number indicating a single individual. signiﬁcant among population, suggesting either dramatic demographic changes or additional diversity maintained by bal- ancing the selection of some form. divergence the amova of the mtcytb data indicated strong populations and (fst = 0.443, p < 0.001; fsc = 0.364, p < 0.001) but not signiﬁcant divergence between drainages predom- inantly in georgia (etowah, chattahoochee, altamaha, flint), south carolina (savannah, santee), and north carolina (little tennessee), with fct only 0.124. results were very similar at the ntf locus with a high fst (0.508, p < 0.001), and a nonsigniﬁcant fct (0.154). when the structure was changed to reﬂect the gene tree in fig. 3 (a clade containing the altamaha and flint populations and the second clade comprising all other populations), among-group variation increased from 15.4% to 65.3% and within-group variation dropping from 42.9% to 5.3%, with concomitant changes in fst(0.706), fsc(0.153) and among-group fct(0.653), all signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). (0.584, p < 0.001), high fsc within-drainage population differentiation in the chattahoochee, savannah, and santee drainages also was high at the mtcytb locus; amova including all population data separated into sites and individual locations grouped by drainage indicated 77.8% of variation was among populations within groups (fsc = 0.666, p < 0.001 and fst = 0.611, p < 0.001). as with the among-drainage pairwise fst values (table 2), almost all populations exhibit signiﬁcant pairwise fst values, with the exception of coweeta (little tennessee), etowah (fst = )0.025), beaverdam (fst = )0.013), and doublebranch (fst ) 0.022) sites. thus, overall differentiation among sites was very high, with only a small set of comparisons sharing large amounts of genetic variation with the little tennessee population. overall diversity at mtcytb was high in each river drainage; haplotype diversity (h) population was 1.000 ± 0.009, although in other drainages h ranged from 0.893 to 0.998, with a diversity across all presumed native drainages h = 0.992 ± 0.002. the little tennessee in 543 7 4 4 . 5 6 0 1 . 2 3 0 1 . 9 8 1 . 5 1 6 1 . 6 1 . 3 1 5 7 2 . 7 9 6 2 . 2 2 2 . 5 5 0 . 5 5 . 2 6 3 . 6 9 3 . 0 0 9 2 . 3 4 4 . 1 5 1 1 . 4 5 1 1 . 6 8 . 1 1 4 7 1 . 2 1 4 1 . 2 5 2 . 0 3 8 2 . 5 6 2 . 7 0 1 . 3 9 2 . 1 4 6 . 7 5 3 . 0 1 0 . 1 3 . 6 9 0 . 7 1 6 1 3 1 . 0 5 . 5 3 2 . 8 1 1 6 9 1 . 8 7 5 . 7 5 . 8 1 9 . 1 3 5 9 3 . . 5 9 1 ) 5 4 0 . 1 4 0 . 0 1 5 1 . 6 4 3 . 3 6 3 1 . 5 1 2 1 . 6 5 3 . 0 8 . 6 1 4 0 6 1 . 3 1 4 . 2 4 0 3 . 5 6 5 . 5 2 . 1 0 5 8 1 . . 3 1 0 ) 1 3 0 . 4 2 0 . . 3 0 2 ) 5 2 0 ) . 6 4 2 . . 9 1 3 ) 8 2 1 . 0 5 . 1 8 1 0 1 . 3 5 7 1 . . 7 6 3 ) 0 0 0 . 8 1 0 . 6 3 . 0 1 3 . 0 0 0 1 1 . 6 7 2 . 9 9 . 0 ) 1 1 . 8 2 1 . 0 ) 9 2 . 4 1 2 3 . 4 0 7 . 4 3 4 . 0 3 4 3 . 1 1 0 5 . 0 ) 4 3 . 0 2 4 . 0 0 2 . 0 4 1 . 0 h t i w , s e u a v l t s f e s w i r i a p e r a l a n o g a d i w o e b l . s n o s i r a p m o c l l a n i 1 0 0 0 < . n o i t a v e d i d r a d n a t s h t i w 3 2 8 1 . . 8 9 2 3 8 8 . 0 3 7 0 . 6 2 9 6 . 7 3 . 1 2 4 3 9 6 . 1 3 . 8 2 0 2 8 6 . 0 5 4 0 . 0 6 . 0 3 6 . 0 8 6 . 0 4 6 . 0 , a d 6 5 . 4 8 9 . 3 1 8 5 . 3 1 6 1 . 2 8 6 . 7 1 0 6 . 6 1 3 3 0 . 1 7 . 0 1 3 . 0 3 6 0 . 1 4 . 0 7 4 . 0 4 5 0 . 5 6 0 . 3 8 . 1 5 0 . 0 ) 5 7 . 8 3 0 . 6 4 2 . 7 1 5 0 2 . 0 9 . 0 8 8 0 . 0 5 . 0 1 6 . 0 5 8 . 0 7 8 . 0 6 8 . 0 6 8 . 0 4 6 . 0 1 . 9 0 6 1 0 1 . 2 1 . 3 4 1 1 9 8 0 . 0 9 . 0 6 9 . 0 7 7 0 . 3 6 . 0 5 8 . 0 4 7 . 0 6 7 . 0 9 8 . 0 1 9 . 0 0 3 4 . 5 8 5 . 9 3 8 . 0 7 . 0 8 6 . 0 7 2 . 0 9 9 . 0 ) 5 6 0 . 2 0 . 3 4 . 0 ) 0 ) 8 2 . 0 5 3 . 0 2 2 . 0 0 2 . 0 4 3 . 3 4 9 . 7 8 5 . 1 1 6 3 . 0 9 5 . 0 7 6 . 0 0 6 . 0 8 6 . 0 1 4 . 0 7 1 . 0 0 5 . 0 2 5 . 0 5 5 . 0 0 5 . 0 6 6 . 0 7 5 . 4 9 4 . 0 2 4 . 0 3 8 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 8 . 0 6 7 . 0 4 2 . 0 0 2 . 0 8 6 . 0 2 7 . 0 3 7 . 0 2 7 . 0 4 1 . 3 6 1 . 0 6 3 . 0 2 2 . 0 ) 0 8 . 0 3 4 . 0 2 6 . 0 3 7 . 0 7 1 . 0 ) 4 0 . 0 ) 2 5 . 0 1 6 . 0 8 5 . 0 9 5 . 0 s e c n e g r e v d i e d i t o e c u n l t e n e r a l a n o g a d i e v o b a . ) n o i t a u p o p l i n h t i w s e c n e r e f f i d i e s w r i a p e g a r e v a ( . ) 1 0 0 . < p s r e h t o l l a ( l d o b y b 5 0 . 0 > p ;

those three populations themselves were not signiﬁcantly differentiated from several other sites, including flat creek (chattahoochee) and two of the savannah populations (table 3). this association could be meaningful because the south carolina sites harbour less intra-population diversity than the geor- gia sites, and the net nucleotide divergence of the coweeta population was effectively zero for the saluda sites. nevertheless, ﬁve of eight distinct ntf haplotypes identiﬁed from the coweeta site were unique to that location, though the sample size is much higher at this site. at neither the mtcytb nor ntf locus was differentiation signiﬁcantly correlated with euclidean distance; a mantel isolation-by-distance test produced a nonsigniﬁcant (p > 0.10) correlation of only 0.49 for mtcytb, and was much lower at the ntf locus. discussion despite sampling ﬁsh from every major drainage in which n. lutipinnis is found – including a sampling effort for distinct sites and number of individuals (average population n = 15.2 for mtctyb, 13.6 for ntf) that is commensurate with better-sampled studies reviewed by muirhead et al. (2008) – we were unable to identify the likely source(s) for the little tennessee population of this species. although there are statis- tical similarities (based on the frequency of closely related haplotypes between populations) between the little tennessee population and sites in the etowah and savannah rivers (based on mtcytb) or between the little tennessee population and sites in the saluda river (based on ntf), at each locus there is a high level of endemic diversity associated with the little tennessee population. there were additional inter- phylogeography of n. lutipinnis in its ‘native’ range drainage comparisons that did not differ statistically (e.g., savannah and etowah, chattahoochee, and altamaha), and the overall high level of diversity within and among all sites suggests the long-term sorting of a highly polymorphic ancestral species range. although the two loci analysed in this study suggest no consistent identiﬁcation of the origin of the little tennessee population, it is always possible that additional sampling effort in the presumed native range could recover the ‘unique’ haplotypes found in the little tennessee (wares et al. 2005; muirhead et al. 2008). negative results in the analysis of species introductions are difﬁcult to interpret because they cannot falsify hypotheses of a species being native or introduced; even 10-fold increases in sampling effort may not resolve the origin of unique diversity found in a population presumed to be introduced (blakeslee, a. m. h., byers, j. e. & lesser, m. p. 2008. resolving cryptogenic histories using host and parasite genetics. molecular ecology: 17: 3684–3696). however, our results suggest that it is also worth examining the available information regarding the introduced status of yellowﬁn shiner. phylogenetic placement of many unique mitochondrial haplotypes at an intermediate position in the mtcytb haplotype network suggests that the species may not be invasive in the little tennessee river. a large number of congeneric and confamilial species have long been considered native to the entire range explored in this study, including the tennessee river basin (ramsey ‘native’ status is not 1965). this suggests that biogeographically improbable; yet this species has been considered ‘introduced’ based on missing infor- mation in historical collections, anecdotal evidence, and recent surveys in which yellowﬁn shiners were ﬁrst noted for upstream sites in the little tennessee drainage. our own monitoring data on this species suggests there may be some environmental correlates repeated severe droughts) with the recent (e.g., appearance of n. lutipinnis in tributary sites, and other monitoring studies have indicated that even if native, the range of this species within the little tennessee drainage has increased substantially over the past two decades (b. mclarney, pers. comm.). in addition to information pertinent to the intro- duced status of yellowﬁn shiner, the ntf data seem to exclude any association between the little tennessee population and sites in the altamaha and flint drainages. previous evidence has suggested that transferrin evolves in accordance with diversifying selection in natural ﬁsh populations as a response to selective pressures by microbial pathogens (ford 2000, 2001), and recent work shows that there is considerable diversity at this locus among populations of n. is consistent with positive selection (wares, 2009). the strength of differentiation lutipinnis that 545 scott et al. between the altamaha and flint populations and all other populations suggests more than historical lineage sorting. consequently, regardless of the fact that many of our samples represent a single site in a given drainage, ntf sequence data strongly indicate an evolutionarily signiﬁcant divergence between all other sampled populations and those sampled in the alta- maha and flint; whether this represents historical divergence or environmental differentiation is yet to be resolved. overall, the evidence for selection driving this differentiation among populations in n. lutipinnis appears somewhat weak (table 3). for example, comparisons of the altamaha sequence data with those from other populations produced a ka:ks ratio close to 1, a result consistent with neutral evolution (wayne & simonsen 1998; but see kryazhimskiy & plotkin 2008). however, many of the replacement substitutions recovered on the gene tree in fig. 3 are not ﬁxed within or among populations (not shown); only a single population (etowah) had zero nonsyn- onymous substitutions segregating in the sample relative to the number of synonymous substitutions, with all other populations having relatively high pa:ps ratios (table 3). the general discordance between the mtcytb and ntf data suggests envi- ronmental processes could be inﬂuencing the dynam- ics of gene ﬂow in this species, and provides preliminary insights into how this system may be further explored for methods to distinguish environ- mental, stochastic, and biological factors in generating the observed diversity in this species (endler 1982; haydon et al. 1994). although little is yet known about the biology or genetics of yellowﬁn shiners, wood & mayden (1992) used electrophoretic techniques to demonstrate the two primary and reciprocally likely presence of monophyletic lineages of n. lutipinnis: one in the santee-broad basin of north carolina and south carolina, and the other in the savannah, altamaha, and chattahoochee basins of south carolina and georgia. our data suggest that the divergence between these two regional groups is not complete, although our mitochondrial data resemble the pattern recovered by wood & mayden (1992). this pattern is not consistent with the typical ‘coastal drainage’ phylog- eographic patterns of avise (1992), in which gulf and atlantic slope drainages are deeply isolated from each other (baer 1998). however, is consistent with studies of ancient stream capture events [e.g., between the savannah and the chattahoochee (swift et al. 1986); in the southern appalachian region (lydeard et al. 1991; mayden & matson 1992; wood & mayden 1992; voss et al. 1995; kozak et al. 2006)]. although there is little direct evidence of these ancient connections, the comparison of genetic variation it 546 in numerous explanations. species may yield more complete wood & mayden (1992) also suggested that the somewhat longitudinal correlation with genetic dis- tance among populations in their data was consistent with an ancient northeastward-ﬂowing drainage hypothesised by white (1953). however, this pro- posed drainage lay in miocene sediments, which are much more ancient than the shared allelic variation among yellowﬁn shiner populations would indicate. further analyses indicate that our data are not consistent with the spatially limited vicariance hypoth- esis proposed by wood & mayden (1992); a mantel isolation-by-distance test produced a nonsigniﬁcant correlation of only 0.49. this test of differentiation based on euclidean distances is of course a very weak examination of this idea given the complexity of the habitat of yellowﬁn shiners. yet in addition, fig. 2 demonstrates that although sites in georgia tend to be differentiated from sites in south carolina, with the savannah mostly intermediate in relationship, the most westward samples from the etowah tend to cluster with the samples in south carolina. in general, the etowah site tends to generate the furthest-outlying points in the isolation by distance analysis (not shown), suggesting that the data are consistent with a more complex model of historical equilibrium movement and exchange (mcrae 2006). alternatively, our data may suggest that more consideration should be given to the native status of the etowah population, which has been called into question (burkhead et al. 1997; see http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queris/factsheet.asp? speciesid=602). further work will be necessary to clarify the geographic differentiation of yellowﬁn shiner popula- tions. a number of non-exclusive interpretations may apply to the gene tree data shown here for n. lutipinnis, including: (i) lineage sorting and ancestral polymorphism (avise 1994; bulgin et al. 2003), and (ii) contemporary gene ﬂow – both within and among basins due to natural processes or anthropogenic environmental changes (slatkin 1985; scott & helf- man 2001). we are beginning to explore the use of microsatellite markers developed for cyprinid min- nows (turner et al. 2004) to obtain a more complete assessment of inter-drainage gene ﬂow and ⁄ or ances- tral polymorphism in this and related species, and comparisons of larger numbers of markers will also promote our understanding of which markers or genes are responding to environmental inﬂuences and demo- graphic ones (luikart et al. 2003). the high genetic diversity found across the broad geographic range of n. lutipinnis – whether in the north carolina samples or in the presumed native range – may encompass some long-isolated lineages that are no longer in demographic contact with one another. the sister species, n. chlorocephalus, is found in the easternmost drainages of the ancestral range of n. lutipinnis (wood & mayden 1992), and a strongly divergent clade is found in our flint river sample as well (fig. 2). this range-wide diversity should be a strength in identifying the putative source for a species introduction, which may – depending on the mechanism of introduction – incorporate diversity from multiple sources. kolbe et al. (2004) identiﬁed a comparable level of range-wide diversity across the native populations of anolis sagrei, and the greatest diversity was found within the introduced populations in florida. however, haplotypes from these introduced populations were consistently shared with source- range populations, providing clear indication that multiple sources were responsible for the introduction, while our phylogenetic signal is more evolutionarily ambiguous. freshwater ﬁshes tend to be anomalous among introduced species in that there are generally a greater number of species introductions from different water- sheds (or portions of watersheds) on the same continent, rather than the exotics coming from differ- ent global regions (scott & helfman 2001; sax et al. 2005; rahel 2007). this process has, of course, led to a dramatic homogenisation of freshwater ﬁsh commu- nities (rahel 2000; gherardi 2007). although much work is being carried out to evaluate the factors leading to invasion success for freshwater ﬁshes (fausch et al. 2001; kolar & lodge 2002; jeschke & strayer 2005; ruesink 2005; garcı´a-berthou 2007), genetic analysis aids in documenting the role of diversity and propagule pressure in successful intro- ductions (wares et al. 2005). our somewhat conﬂict- ing results in determining whether a population is invasive (kolbe et al. 2004; wares et al. 2005; wares & blakeslee 2007; muirhead et al. 2008), especially if the intro- duction comes from multiple sources (kolbe et al. 2004). it appears less likely that yellowﬁn shiner are invasive in the little tennessee than originally thought, although it is also possible that we did not sample the source population(s). even if native, long-term collections made by multiple inves- tigators indicate that yellowﬁn shiners are clearly undergoing a widespread range expansion in the little tennessee drainage (johnston et al. 1995) – a demo- graphic pattern typical of an invasive species. illustrate the difﬁculties inherent in conclusion, this study marks an updated multilocus phylogeo- graphic treatment of the broadly distributed minnow n. lutipinnis, and provides new insights into the historical and adaptive biology of southeastern ﬁshes. although we cannot disprove the alien status of this species in the little tennessee river basin, our genetic data were not consistent with typical patterns for recent invaders (wares et al. 2005). the degree of phylogeography of n. lutipinnis in its ‘native’ range geographic differentiation among populations of this species suggests both an ancient distribution in the southern appalachians and large and persistent effec- tive population sizes in historical populations (wake- ley & hey 1997; bulgin et al. 2003). our study also generated new hypotheses of the role of adaptive processes in divergence among different river drain- ages, and suggests that further study of the interactions between native ﬁshes and their abiotic and biotic (including microbial) environment is warranted. such interactions may have played a role in the remarkably high diversity of aquatic organisms in the southeastern usa. further synthesis of the comparative phyloge- ographic diversity of southeastern aquatic species should be a next step in considering ecosystem-level management of regional diversity. acknowledgements the authors would like
