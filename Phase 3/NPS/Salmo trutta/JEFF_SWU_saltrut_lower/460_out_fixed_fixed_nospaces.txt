(2010) suggested that presmolt arctic char and ninespine stickleback had similar diets based on stable d13c and d15n isotope results. by contrast, the average d13c values of insectivorous arctic char and ninespine stickleback suggested little overlap between the two species (kidd et al. 1998). the trophic ecology of aquatic species can be examined using a variety of methods that include the correspondence: t. a. dick, department of biological sciences, university of manitoba, winnipeg, r3t-2n manitoba, canada. e-mail: tadick@cc.umanitoba.ca *present address: fisheries and oceans canada, 501 university crescent, winnipeg, r3t-2n6 manitoba, canada. e-mail: colin.gallagher@dfo-mpo.gc.ca 646 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00516.x identiﬁcation of stomach contents (dwyer et al. 2010), stable isotopes (post 2002), endohelminth parasites transmitted in food (knudsen et al. 2010), fatty acid analysis (budge et al. 2002) and molecular genetic techniques (carreron-martinez & heath 2010). these methods are useful to elucidate the niche of an organism and indicate ecological linkages among species (peterson & fry 1987; gorokhova & lehtni- emi 2007; alfaro 2008; amundsen et al. 2009). food webs in small arctic freshwater lakes are constrained by environmental conditions that limit productivity typically resulting in the occurrence of fewer species with relatively simpliﬁed ecological linkages. although methods to assess trophic ecology vary, the increased use of stable d13c and d15n isotopes, periodically in conjunction with diet analysis, has improved the resolution of food webs (wada et al. 1991; peterson 1999). stable d13c isotope is useful to determine the sources of food and identify ecological niche (matthews & mazumder 2004), while d15n indicates the trophic position of an organism (minag- awa & wada 1984). diet can be described by an analysis of stomach contents, which allows the iden- tiﬁcation of prey consumed. however, this provides a picture of diet that reﬂects the feeding behaviour over a short interval of time, which depends on the degree of digestion of the prey and the rate of gut evacuation (mccarthy et al. 2004). parasites transmitted by speciﬁc prey items reﬂect the feeding ecology and have a longer time frame as most endohelminthes have one year or longer lifespans. both parasites and stable isotopes are useful in elucidating the trophic charac- teristics of a population in the absence of information on the prey composition of the information on trophic status is integrated over a temporal scale of months to years. the presence of a speciﬁc parasite species in the digestive tract indicates that a speciﬁc food item has been consumed, even if it is not found in the diet of an individual ﬁsh and can be correlated with seasonal feeding patterns. stable isotopes in muscle reﬂect a combined response to all diet items consumed but the relatively long half-life of stable isotopes among the adults of many ﬁsh species results in slow turnover rates often making discrimi- nation over short time scales difﬁcult (hesslein et al. 1993). alternatively, other tissues such as mucus (church et al. 2009), liver and blood (buchheister & latour 2010) demonstrate higher turnover rates com- pared with muscle resulting in improved resolution over shorter time scales. data on stable isotopes, diet and parasites usually complement each other and provide a more holistic approach when describing the trophic ecology of an organism (johnson et al. 2004; dick et al. 2009a; gallagher & dick 2010). the diet. here, the objective of this study was to examine nine- spine stickleback from a small lake on bafﬁn island to ecology of stickleback from bafﬁn island (i) describe the trophic characteristics of ninespine stickleback using stable d13c and d15n isotopes, diet analysis and parasites and (ii) compare results with sympatrically occurring arctic char (see gallagher & dick 2010) to evaluate niche segregation. methods study site iqalugaajuruluit lake (63°41¢n; 68°22¢w) is a small (119 ha) freshwater lake situated near the coast of frobisher bay and is located 10 km south-east of iqaluit, bafﬁn island, canada (fig. 1). the lake has a maximum depth of 18 m with a single small creek ﬂowing into and draining the lake. a more detailed description of the lake is found in the study by dick et al. (2009b). the ﬁsh species inhabiting the lake are landlocked arctic char and ninespine stickleback. sample collection and processing ninespine stickleback were sampled from the littoral areas (<2 m) of the lake. ninespine stickleback were sampled using a smith-root backpack electroﬁsher by walking along the shore and from a zodiacò (zodiac international, paris, france) boat in july (13–14) and august (22–23), and the 89-mm mesh of experimental gill nets set in the littoral areas in july (13–15) 2004 (gallagher & dick 2010). all specimens were frozen shortly after capture. ninespine stickleback were measured for fork length (±0.1 mm). sagittal otoliths were removed in the laboratory, mounted on a glass slide and covered with cytosealò (richard allen, kalamazoo, mi, u.s.a.) mounting medium, and annuli were counted using a dissecting microscope. a small piece of epaxial muscle was removed from all specimens, placed in tinfoil and dried for 48 h in an oven at 70 °c prior to stable isotope iqaluit baffin island frobisher bay fig. 1. location of iqalugaajuruluit lake (arrow) on bafﬁn island. dashed lines indicate roads. insert illustrates the location of the study area on bafﬁn island in canada. 647 gallagher & dick analysis. a random subsample (n = 88) was selected for stable isotope analysis from nearly half of all ninespine stickleback captured during the summer. within the subsample, specimens from july and august were similar to the proportion observed in the total catch ( ⅔ from july and  ⅓ from august). stomach and intestinal contents were examined from all samples using a dissecting microscope, and diet items were identiﬁed to order or family level and enumerated. if decomposition was too advanced, the presence of the taxonomic group was recorded. the gills, heart, stomach, intestine, liver, spleen and body cavity from each specimen were examined for parasites. parasites were identiﬁed to species level and enumerated, and a subsample was ﬁxed and stained for veriﬁcation. stable isotope analysis (gv-instruments methods for stable isotope analysis were adopted from thomas & cahoon (1993). once muscle samples were dry, they were ground into a ﬁne powder and used directly for carbon and nitrogen analyses. d13carbon and d15nitrogen isotopic analyses on the muscle (protein) were accomplished by continuous ﬂow ion ratio mass spectrometry (cf-irms) using a gv-instrumentsò isoprime inc, manchester, uk) attached to a peripheral temperature-controlled euro- vectorò elemental analyzer (ea) (university of winni- peg isotope laboratory, winnipeg, manitoba, canada). a 1.0-mg sample of oven-dried ﬁsh muscle was loaded into tin capsules and placed in the ea autosampler together with internally calibrated carbon⁄ nitrogen standards (pharma cottonseed and casein proteins: d13c = )22.95 and )26.98& vienna peedee belem- nite (vpdb); d15 n = 5.00 and 5.94 & air, respec- tively). batch ﬁles were set up as follows: four casein and four cottonseed as standards and every ﬁfth test sample duplicated and every 15th test sample triplicated. carbon and nitrogen isotope results are expressed using standard delta [d notation in units of per mil (&)]. the delta values of carbon (d13ccell) and nitrogen (d15ncell) represent deviations from a standard, such that: dsample ¼ ½ðrsample=rstandardþ   1103 where r is the 13c ⁄ 12c or 15n ⁄ 14n ratio in the sample and the standard. the standards used for carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses are vpdb and iaea-n-1 (iaea, vienna, austria), respectively. analytical precision, determined from the analysis of duplicate samples, was ±0.16& for d13c and ±0.18& for d15n. accuracy was obtained through the analysis of laboratory standards used for the calibration of results. data analysis length in august correlated with analysis of covariance was used to examine for differences in d13c and d15n between ninespine stickleback captured in july and august. length was used as covariate because d15n was signiﬁcantly positively correlated with length for samples collected in july [r = 0.38 (d.f. = 79); p < 0.01] and august [r = 0.75 (d.f. = 23); p < 0.01], while d13c was negatively in august [r = )0.57 (d.f. = 23); p < 0.01]. stable isotope data were also analysed between males and females within both months. among the possible combinations of month and isotope values for males and females, a signiﬁcant correlation was detected between length and d15n for females in july [r = 0.44 (d.f. = 44); p = 0.002] and for males [r = 0.57 (d.f. = 10); p = 0.05] and between length and d13c for males in august [r = )0.64 (d.f. = 10); p = 0.03]. statistical power was examined for nonsigniﬁcant results from the analysis of stable isotopes. meaning- ful testing to detect differences between male and females ninespine stickleback in august was limited owing to small sample size. although no signiﬁcant differences were observed in d13c or d15n between males and females in august, the effect size d [(l1– l2) ⁄ dpooled] of d13c (d = 0.67) and d15n (d = 0.21) was slightly higher than ‘medium’ and ‘low’, respec- tively (according to cohen 1989), resulting in low statistical power with the available sample size (0.2 for d13c and 0.07 for d15n, for a two-tailed test with a 1- b of 0.8 and a of 0.05). it was decided not to analyse for differences in stable isotopes between males and females in august. additionally, nonsignif- icant results were observed in the d15n of ninespine stickleback and arctic char collected during the summer (july and august combined) because of low effect size (d = 0.05) resulting in low statistical power (0.06) with the available sample size. the frequency of occurrence of each diet item (% individuals with the diet item) and the per cent total of diet items (based on the total sum of individual items enumerated) were calculated in july and august and separate for female and male ninespine stickleback captured in each month. differences in diet between july and august, and males and females sampled in both months were estimated using horn’s index of dietary overlap (horn 1966): p r0 ¼ ðpij þ pikþ logðpij þ pikþ   p pij log pij   p pik log pik 2 log 2 648 where r0 is the index of dietary overlap between j and k (e.g., ninespine stickleback populations samples from july and august, or males and females within a month), pij is the proportion of resource i (prey item) of total resources used by population j and pik is the proportion of resource i of total resources used by population k. a chi-square test was also used to test for differences in diet between sampling months, and males and females sampled in july and august. the prevalence and mean intensity (margolis et al. 1982) of each parasite species among different size classes of female and male ninespine stickleback captured in july and august were calculated. juvenile arctic the stable d13c and d15n isotopes, diet and parasites of ninespine stickleback were compared with those for arctic char that were also collected in the same littoral habitat during the summer (july and august combined) (see gallagher & dick 2010). additionally, char <100 mm in length captured in august were compared with ninespine stickleback collected in the same month. juvenile arctic char collected in august were used, as few samples <100 mm were captured in july. differences in stable isotopes were examined by the analysis of covariance using length as a covariate, while horn’s index was calculated to quantify dietary overlap. results sample characteristics a total of 205 ninespine stickleback were collected during the summer (n = 137 in july, 38 of which were captured by gill nets, and n = 68 in august). the mean length (±1 standard deviation) of ninespine stickle- back was 35.9 ± 9.9 mm (range 15.6–56.3 mm) (table 1). four age classes were observed in the sample (n = 196 samples aged). ninespine stickleback in reproductive condition were relatively abundant in july (all mature specimens were ‡2 years of age), while considerably few were observed in august (t. dick unpublished data). females accounted for 65.8% ecology of stickleback from bafﬁn island and 38.0% of the sample in july and august, respectively. young-of-the-year ninespine stickleback were only captured in august (table 1). a total of 121 arctic char were sampled by electroﬁshing during july and august (see gallagher & dick 2010). the median fork length was 61.4 mm (range 29–172 mm) (age range of 0–9 years). ninety- eight juveniles £100 mm sampled in august had a median length of 59.6 mm (range 29–100 mm) (age range of 0–2 years). stable isotopes (mean length = 41.0 mm; et al. 2007). ninespine stable isotope analysis of ninespine stickleback was performed on muscle from 70 samples collected in july range = 21.6– 55.8 mm) and 18 samples collected in august (mean length = 35.3 mm; range = 29.9–47.3 mm). stable isotopes were analysed from 46 females, 24 males and 12 (sex undetermined) collected in july, and 12 females, six males and four (sex undetermined) collected in august. the c ⁄ n ratio was all <2.3 and did not require any adjustment of d13c values to account for the effect of lipid concentration on d13c (post stickleback from iqalugaajuruluit lake demonstrated a range in d15n between 5.44 and 12.52& and a range in d13c between )15.03 and )28.24&. the d13c and d15n of ninespine stickleback captured in july were signiﬁ- cantly depleted (f = 50.6; d.f. = 1, 103; p = 0.001) and enriched (f = 22.3; d.f = 1, 103; p = 0.001), respectively, compared with august (fig. 2). among samples collected in july, signiﬁcant differences in d13c (f = 7.7; d.f. = 1, 67; p = 0.007) and d15n (f = 4.0; d.f. = 1, 67; p = 0.05) were detected between males and females (fig. 2). on average, females were more depleted in d15n and enriched in d13c than males. stable isotope analysis was performed on 36 arctic char collected from the summer, 21 of which were juveniles sampled in august. samples of ninespine stickleback and arctic char collected in the summer (july and august combined for both species) demon- strated signiﬁcant differences in d13c (f = 18.0;

(2010) reported that the metabolism of sticklebacks is high compared with other species. we concur with the ﬁndings of wasser et al. (2010) as a change in d13c and d15n isotope ratios in ninespine stickleback between july and august was found. furthermore, this observation is supported with data from diets and endohelminths in individual ﬁsh. clearly, while arctic lakes are cold, the temperature change during the open water period ( 1–2.5 months) combined with the relatively high metabolic rate is sufﬁcient to reduce the half-life of isotopes, so that changes can be detected in muscle tissue during the summer at least within the time span of a month. (canada) stable isotopes and diet the mean values for d13c and d15n stable isotopes were similar to the values reported by others (karlsson & bystrom 2005; swanson et al. 2010) for a small arctic lake. interestingly, unpublished stable isotope data (t. dick) of male and female ninespine stickle- back captured in september (n = 30) from chitty (62°42¢n; lake, northwest territories 114°07¢w), had a mean d15n value of 10.7&, which was signiﬁcantly (f = 9.1; d.f. = 1, 131; p = 0.003) than the mean value of d15n 10.2& for higher ninespine stickleback from iqalugaajuruluit lake. similarly, the mean d13c of )20.37& of ninespine stickleback from chitty lake differed signiﬁcantly (f = 61.3; d.f. = 1, 131; p < 0.001) from the mean d13c of 24.09& for stickleback from iqalugaajuruluit lake. this difference supports the importance of supplementing stable isotope analysis with diet studies as stickleback in chitty lake consumed a high proportion of zooplankton (frequency of occurrence of copepods and cladocera was 82.5% and 96.5%, respectively). consequently, to generalise trophic structuring of ninespine stickleback across arctic lakes owing to different food webs and ⁄ or spatial variation in d13c and d15n. it may be difﬁcult it is unclear what the precise turnover rate is for stable d15n and d13c isotopes in the muscle of ninespine stickleback in iqalugaajuruluit lake. we would expect some lag time between the consumption of prey items 652 twice the per cent with the observed isotope signals. although males and females sampled in july were captured in the same littoral habitat, males consumed a diet that was more enriched in d15n and depleted in d13c compared with females. in july, both females and males had a high frequency of occurrence of copepods but males had about to that of females (table 2). the frequency of occurrence of chironomid larvae was similar; however, females consumed three times more chironomids than the males. the occurrence of ostracods in the diet of both males and females was about 10% (table 2). our results imply that chironomid d13c was enriched and d15n was depleted relative to zooplankton. it is likely that the higher occurrence of chironomid larvae and ostracods in the female diet lowered d15n and increased d13c values relative to males. support for this interpretation is found in the literature. rautio & vincent (2007) studying zooplank- ton in shallow (£9 m) lakes in the canadian arctic (latitudes 74–75°n) found that cladocerans and cope- pods had signiﬁcantly enriched d15n relative to benthic- dwelling invertebrates, which included ostracods and chironomid larvae. the benthic-dwelling organisms had d13c that was more enriched than cladocera but was similar to copepods. karlsson & bystrom (2005) and swanson et al. (2010) reported similar ﬁndings from northern lakes (68°n), where chironomid d13c was enriched and d15n was depleted relative to zooplankton. the segregation between female and male ninespine stickleback observed in our study is likely related to the reproductive ecology of the species. territoriality in male ninespine has been described by morris (1958), wootton (1976) and craig & fitzgerald (1982). this segregation between males and females has been observed in the spring by sokolowska & skora (2002) in puck bay (poland), with males distributed in deeper areas protecting nests containing spawn and fry, while females fed in shallow nearshore areas. indirect evidence from our study supports these observations as there were more sexually mature female than male ninespine stickleback in the mid-july samples. furthermore, males had proportionally more pelagic species such as copepods and cladocera in their diets, while females consumed more benthic organisms. the difference in the diet may also be related to different energetic requirements for repro- duction. total the change in stable d13c and d15n isotopes from july to august reﬂects a change in feeding pattern over the open water period. the depletion of d15n and enrichment of d13c from july to august are likely a result of an increased frequency of occurrence of ostracods ( 60%) in concert with the consumption of other benthic organisms such as chironomid larvae along with an  40% decline in the per cent total of (table 2). copepods between july and august although there were insufﬁcient stable isotope data to investigate the differences between males and females in august, there was evidence that the high degree of ecological segregation observed in july decreased considerably by august. the diet of males and females demonstrated greater similarity in prey composition. we hypothesise that this is because of a shift by males to shallower areas of the littoral zone to feed on benthic organisms and the presence of young-of-the- year in the august sample indicates that fewer males were tending nests. parasites the presence of endohelminths is the result of con- sumption of the following infective stages: procercoid of cestodes or tapeworms, larvae of acanthocephalans or spiny-headed worm and metacercariae of trematodes or ﬂukes. the spiny-headed worm, n. pungitius, is acquired from infected ostracods, the ﬂuke, c. farionis from infected amphipods (gammaridae), and the tapeworms, p. longicollis, diphyllobothrium spp., s. pungitius, e. salvelini, p. agubernaculum and c. truncatus were acquired from infected copepods (hoffman 1999). support of dietary shifts between july and august is reﬂected in the parasite data. for example, males and females in july had a higher prevalence and per cent total of copepods in the diet and a concomitant higher prevalence of diphyllobothrium spp. and s. pungitius infections. by contrast, the mean intensity of copepod- transmitted parasites was lower in august than in july, which was reﬂected in the difference in the per cent total of copepods in the diet between july and august (table 3). similar prevalences of n. pungitius between july and august suggest that ostracods are a consistent component of the diet. the difference in the mean intensity of copepod-transmitted parasites between july and august for both males and females is probably due to the natural increase in a pulse of abundance of diphyllobothrium spp. and s. pungitius during spring with the arrival and feeding on ﬁsh by migratory gulls and loons (deﬁnitive hosts). the decrease in s. pungitius in august is a result of induced mortality of more heavily infected ninespine stickleback and intensive feeding by ﬁsh-eating birds in shallow areas of the lake. comparisons between arctic char and ninespine stickleback ninespine stickleback and arctic char from iq- alugaajuruluit lake fed at similar trophic levels as differences in d15n between both species were <3&. by contrast, d13c values between arctic char and ninespine stickleback were signiﬁcantly different ecology of stickleback from bafﬁn island indicating ecological segregation between species and minimal competition for resources. the diets of arctic char collected in the littoral areas comprised 14 prey items, while those of ninespine stickleback had eight prey items. particle size differed between the two species of ﬁsh; for example, compared with zooplankton, some food items taken by the char were much larger, i.e., trichoptera larvae, adult chironomids, adult hymenoptera, spiders (ara- neae) and ninespine stickleback. collembola were abundant in the arctic char diet, while none were detected in ninespine stickleback. collembola are small terrestrial invertebrates (danks 1981) and appear to be an important allochthonous source of energy to the food web of iqalugaajuruluit lake. either arctic char feed in proximity to riparian vegetation where collembola fall into the water or feeding may occur higher in the water column of the littoral zone when collembola are transported and deposited by wind. although arctic char consumed zooplankton, the frequency of occurrence and per cent total in their diet were signiﬁcantly lower than for ninespine stickleback [v2 (d.f. = 2) = 6.07; p = 0.04] (table 2). the most frequently shared prey item was chironomid larvae. our results are similar to those of jorgensen & klemetsen (1995), who demonstrated that threespined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus and arctic char were segregated by diet when coexisting in the littoral zone, with prey size being the most important factor in the partitioning of resources between both species. the parasite data indicate that both species feed on ostracods and copepods. mutual parasites such as n. pungitius occurred more frequently in ninespine stickleback and are likely associated with the higher incidence of ostracods in their diet, compared with arctic char. although not directly observed in the diet, the abundance of c. farionis indicated that more amphipods were consumed by arctic char than by ninespine stickleback. although copepods were less frequent in arctic char diet during open water, the prevalence and mean intensities of copepod-transmitted parasites (p. longicollis and diphyllobothrium spp.) were similar between arctic char and ninespine stick- leback (table 3), suggesting that arctic char feed on copepods at a different time of the year (svenning et al. 2007; gallagher & dick 2010) and also may be more susceptible to infection. differences in other parasite species (i.e., e. salvelini, s. pungitius and p. aguber- naculum) between the two ﬁsh hosts are likely the result of host speciﬁcity rather than ecological segregation. summary the stable d13c and d15n isotopes, diet and parasites of ninespine stickleback from iqalugaajuruluit lake described their ecological role in a small arctic lake 653 gallagher & dick and provided the resolution to detect intraspeciﬁc variation in their ecological niche during the summer. ninespine stickleback foraged principally on cope- pods, cladocera, ostracods and chironomid larvae, similar to their diet in other north american aquatic ecosystems (e.g., cameron et al. 1973), and although ninespine stickleback can occupy the same habitat as juvenile arctic char and feed at the same trophic level, both occupy different dietary niches. we hypothesise that niche segregation of sympatrically occurring ninespine stickleback and juvenile arctic char in the summer is inﬂuenced by feeding habitat (primar- ily benthic for arctic char and mainly pelagic for ninespine stickleback), gape size and predation of ninespine stickleback by arctic char. furthermore, ninespine stickleback contributes to the food web in iqalugaajuruluit lake, by transferring energy from zooplankton in the littoral zone to larger-sized arctic char feeding at a higher trophic level and occupying mainly pelagic habitat (see karlsson & bystrom 2005; dick et al. 2009b; gallagher & dick 2010), and is a useful indicator species to detect changes in the sources of primary production (d13c) over a relatively short time period. our data demonstrate how the trophic ecology of small freshwater arctic lakes changes temporally during open water and that diet, stable isotopes and parasites combined were indicators useful to quantify ecological interactions that could be used to develop hypotheses on energy ﬂow in small arctic lakes. acknowledgements we acknowledge support from
