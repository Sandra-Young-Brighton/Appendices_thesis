mixing model; food web ecology; predator subsidy; trophic niche space introduction diversity and either community the damage to ecosystems caused by industrial activ- ity is frequently assessed in terms of differences in species composition between impacted and reference areas. typically, impacted sites are found to have either reduced spe- cies diversity of particular groups or different abun- dances of species compared to reference sites (e.g., valois et al. 2011). also, industrial impacts are increasingly being moni- tored with the use of biomarkers and nonlethal effects (letcher et al. 2010; downs et al. 2012). while all these approaches are informative, rarely is the ques- tion asked whether industrial damage has affected the indicator or sentinel least functioning of whole ecosystems, or at large parts of whole ecosystems. this larger question is quite relevant because it is entirely possible that industrial damage may result in species assemblages that, although different from reference sites, nonethe- less have some ecosystem functions that are similar or even enhanced compared to reference sites. for example, industrial activity in central germany caused an increase in soil ph, which led to increases in plant and insect diversity as well as plant produc- tivity compared to un-impacted sites (br€andle et al. 2001). the area surrounding the city of sudbury, ontario, has a long history of industrial damage from mining and smelting of nickel and copper from sulphur-rich correspondence: a. luek, university of lethbridge, 4401 university drive, lethbridge, ab t1k 3m4, canada. e-mail: andreas.luek@gmail.com 348 doi: 10.1111/eff.12030 impaired benthos favours pelagic forage reliance in ﬁsh community in most ores. many lakes suffered acidiﬁcation and metal contamination resulting in major losses of species and even entire trophic guilds (keller & gunn 1995). pollution controls in the 1970s brought a gradual recovery to lakes in the deposition zone, and as levels of metals fell and ph values rose, quite a few studies documented the resultant improvement in lake com- munities of phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, amphipods, gastropods and ﬁshes (gunn & sandøy 2003). however, even after decades of recovery, ﬁsh communities are still low in diversity with the omni- vore, yellow perch, being dominant lakes (snucins & gunn 2003). while the biomass of ben- thic invertebrates in sudbury lakes is the same as in reference lakes, the diversity is low. several larger species are rare or absent (wesolek et al. 2010b) and these are the most preferred food for ﬁshes (luek et al. 2010; luek 2011). the depauperate benthic invertebrate community found in sudbury lakes may have effects on the whole food web (campbell et al. 2003; rasmussen et al. 2008). as benthic inverte- brates are a major resource for the ﬁsh community (vander zanden et al. 2005), reduced littoral food may reduce overall productivity. a lower availability of invertebrates may also affect the ontogeny of ﬁsh diets (sherwood et al. 2002b; kovecses et al. 2005). yellow perch in sudbury lakes may not be able to pass an energetic threshold to become piscivorous due to an insufﬁcient availability of benthic inverte- brate prey impairing growth to the appropriate size (iles & rasmussen 2005). in contrast to most studies of damaged ecosystems, our focus is neither species richness nor the abun- dance of indicator taxa, but rather the actual function- ing of damaged food webs. we compare a set of industrially damaged lakes to a set of reference lakes, ﬁrst with the usual approach of ﬁsh species diversity and community composition. however, we also assessed these ﬁsh communities in terms of metrics related to their ecosystem function, such as biomass, trophic position, relative use of pelagic versus littoral food sources, diet composition and overall feeding niche breadth. we used stable isotope analysis and mixing models to estimate the contribution of differ- ent littoral and pelagic food items to ﬁsh diets, the overall reliance on littoral sources, and trophic posi- tion (post 2002; semmens & moore 2008) of ﬁsh. furthermore, we used a stable isotope approach to estimate the trophic niche for each ﬁsh species as well as for each lake’s ﬁsh community as described in layman et al. (2007a). we hypothesised that an impaired benthic invertebrate community in sudbury lakes might reduce reliance of ﬁsh on littoral food sources and the trophic position of ﬁsh. fish in these systems should feed more on pelagic food possibly resulting in reduced biomass of pelagic invertebrates. moreover, the simpliﬁed food webs of damaged lake ecosystems, with fewer predators at each trophic level, may allow a more opportunistic or generalist foraging strategy for ﬁsh, whereas the higher diver- sity in reference systems may mean foragers at all trophic levels are more specialised. our goal is to look beyond simple counts of spe- cies and address questions such as, ‘what are the ecological adaptations that allow damaged systems to continue functioning?’ and, ‘how well do dam- aged ecosystems function compared with reference systems?’ the latter question is especially relevant when it comes to assessing degree of ecological recovery and for setting targets for environmental restoration. methods study area we studied eight sudbury area lakes (camp, clear- water, crowley, hannah, linton, lohi, middle, and st. charles lakes) and nine reference lakes (blue chalk, chub, crosson, dickie, harp, heeney, plastic, red chalk east and, red chalk main lakes); the latter were located approximately 250 km to the east- southeast of sudbury, around the town of dorset, ontario (table 1). all lakes were typical for this eco-region and were similar in basin geology and morphometry (table 1), except that average depth was slightly greater in the reference lakes (average of 8.7 and 6.1 for the reference and sudbury lakes, respectively), and total phosphorus concentration was higher in the sudbury lakes (average of 4.3 and 10.3 for the reference and sudbury lakes respectively). the higher phosphorus levels in sudbury are likely a result of these lakes being situated in urban areas, whereas the reference lakes were all in well-forested watersheds. fish communities in the two areas were very different. the sudbury lakes had experienced severe damage by acidiﬁcation and metal contamina- tion, and have now largely recovered chemically but are still affected ecologically. sudbury lakes were dominated by yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens mit- chill) with occasional, small populations of piscivores (i.e., dolomieu lacepede), northern pike (esox lucius linnaeus) and walleye (sander vitreus mitchill)) as well as bullhead (ameiurus nebulosus lesueur) and a few minnows (cyprinidae). the ﬁsh communities of the reference lakes were more diverse and, in addition to the included several other species of minnows, above, suckers sunﬁshes (catastomidae) (salvelinus_namaycush and trout walbaum), (salvelinus_fontinalis mitchill) and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss (centrarchidae), lake_trout (i.e., trout (micropterus brook smallmouth bass 349 luek et al. walbaum)), as well as largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides lacepede) (table 1). sample collection and data analysis in july and august 2009, ﬁsh communities were assessed using standard gill netting methods using multimesh gill nets (appelberg 2000; morgan & snucins 2005), yielding catch per unit effort (cpue), weight per unit effort (wpue) as a standardised mea- sure of ﬁsh biomass, as well as length, weight and sex for individual ﬁsh. for stable isotope analysis (sia) in the sudbury lakes, tissue samples were taken from the dorsal muscle of all species found, with a limit of ten samples per species per lake. because of lower numbers in the reference lakes, only ﬁve indi- viduals per species per lake were sampled for sia. for yellow perch, only ﬁsh in the size range of 90– 200 mm were used for sia, but for other species, ﬁsh were chosen across the size range of the catch. our focus lies on the benthivory of ﬁsh and speciﬁ- cally on benthivory of the dominant ﬁsh species. previous studies by lippert et al. (2007) showed that yellow perch shift their diet at a size around 100– 120 mm from benthivory to piscivory. to limit our stable isotope sample size and still maximise our effort, we decided to limit our sampling to ﬁsh with a size around this known range with a buffer on each side. benthic invertebrates were sampled in august 2009 using a 15 9 15 cm ekman dredge. in each lake, three sites with soft bottom sediment were cho- sen to reﬂect the most abundant habitat type. at each site, samples were taken at 0.5, 1.5 and 3 m water depth, giving a total of nine samples per lake. sieved on site with a 500 lm samples were mesh-bottomed bucket and preserved in ethanol (75– 90%) for later processing.  1∙sample the samples were dyed with phloxine b (approx.  1) to facilitate sorting inverte- 3–5 mg∙l brates with a light table, and all specimens found were counted and identiﬁed to order (ontario bioass- esment and biomonitoring network protocol, obbn) (jones et al. 2005). using random numbers, an entire sample of animals from one depth in each lake was chosen to be measured for length using image analysis of photographs (imagej ver. 1.44 (ferreira & rasband 2011). we calculated biomass of benthic invertebrates using length–weight regressions taken from the literature (benke et al. 1999; johnston & table 1. morphological and chemical characteristics of the study lakes and ﬁsh species

sampled to arrive at whole-lake estimates for soft-sediment habitats. samples of zooplankton and chaoborus were taken in august 2009 using standard methods with zooplankton collected during the day (84 lm mesh net) and chaoborus collected at night (128 lm mesh net); animals were preserved in 14% formalin. in the lab, zooplankton for sia were ﬁltered to retain the size range of 200–1000 lm, were washed three times with distilled water to remove the formalin, and then were dried (60 °c for 24 h) in preweighed tin cups (luek et al. 2010). chaoborus were counted and all specimens from one sample per lake were measured using imagej. chaoborus biomass per m3 was calcu- lated using length–weight regressions (ramcharan et al. 2001). for sia, ﬁve to 10 individuals per lake were washed three times with distilled water and dried at 60 °c in tin cups for 24 h. aside from using invertebrate samples as the baseline for the consumer food web sia, calculated abundances and biomass of benthic invertebrates and chaoborus were compared between areas using anal- ysis of variances to determine food availability for higher trophic levels. formalin and ethanol have been shown in some studies to cause a change in stable isotope ratios of invertebrates (kaehler & pakhomov 2001; sarakinos et al. 2002). we followed the advice of feuchtmayr & grey (2003) and independently veriﬁed that the preservation and rinsing techniques we used would not affect the ratios of stable isotopes in our samples (veriﬁcation data were from b. wissel, eqal-lab, university of regina; see luek 2011). fish muscle tissue was freeze-dried and crushed into a ﬁne pow- der. all samples were combusted and analysed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios using a costech elemental analyzer linked to a finnigan delta plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer (barrie & prosser 1996) (university of regina, environmental quality analysis laboratory). statistica 7.0 (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, u.s.a., statistics, mixsir 2003) was used for general (semmens & moore 2008) for the diet likelihood calculations, and past (hammer 2011) for calculat- ing convex hull area. three different models were used to analyse the stable isotope data. all models used un-transformed stable isotope values for individ- ual ﬁsh and invertebrate values. a two-source d13c/d15n model was used to calcu- late percent littoral resource reliance and trophic posi- tion for individual ﬁsh using the methods described in post (2002). in this method, lake-speciﬁc mean values of d13c and d15n for zooplankton and chiron- omids were used as pelagic and littoral end values respectively. the trophic fractionation index used for relative diet composition of each ﬁsh species was estimated separately using the bayesian mixing model, mixsir (semmens & moore 2008). the bayesian approach of ‘sampling-importance-resam- pling’ can estimate the likelihood of contributions by different diet components. three to ﬁve possible prey components were input depending on the ﬁsh species analysed. diet composition for pumpkinseed (lep- omis gibbosus linnaeus) was estimated from three possible choices (zooplankton, chaoborus and chir- onomids). diets of brown bullhead, yellow perch and smallmouth bass were estimated with all invertebrate prey groups (zooplankton, chaoborus and chirono- mids), plus yellow perch and pumpkinseed as addi- tional possible prey. mixsir requires both a mean fractionation value and a standard deviation for stable isotope values of each model component. with a sample size of n = 1 for each type of invertebrate sample, within lake variation was calculated with the help of archived samples from previous years from the sudbury lakes. the calculated within lake varia- tion between sample years was then averaged across all lakes in sudbury. this average value was then applied as the standard deviation for all invertebrate sample values, but only in the mixsir model. base- line values (zooplankton, chaoborus, and chirono- mids) were calculated as lake-speciﬁc means and standard deviations from 3 years of samples (2007– 2009) for each lake in sudbury (post 2002). how- ever, for the reference lakes we only had one stable isotope sample for each invertebrate component per lake. a standard deviation could not be calculated. instead, we used the mean standard deviation values from all sudbury lakes. from the output of the model the mean contribution of each diet item was calcu- lated with 95% conﬁdence limits. community food web structure in each lake was analysed by calculating convex hull area and mean nearest neighbour distances using the program past ver. 2.06 (hammer 2011). the total trophic niche space of a lakes’ food web can be described as the convex hull area around the mean values of d13c and d15n for each species represented in a lake, in our case, the mean values of each ﬁsh species plus the invertebrate prey, i.e., zooplankton, chaoborus, and chironomids. a greater convex hull area is caused by greater variation among species in the use of prey and indicates a broader use of all present resources in the system (layman et al. 2007a). the nearest neigh- bour analysis calculates the mean distance between all species in the d13c/d15n space and is a representa- tion of how tightly the food web is packed. it is an indicator of a level of trophic redundancy among spe- cies, where a shorter distance between species can 351 luek et al. mean stronger competition for the same resources (layman et al. 2007a). individual trophic niche space for each ﬁsh spe- cies was calculated from littoral resource reliance and trophic position models for individual ﬁsh (lay- man et al. 2007b). this value is comparable among lakes because, as in the models proposed by post (2002), values for individual ﬁsh are corrected for the lake-speciﬁc baselines. the convex hull area was calculated on a bi-plot of percent littoral resource reliance versus trophic position as the smallest area connecting the outermost values for a ﬁsh species within a lake. whenever possible, the trophic niche spaces of yellow perch, smallmouth bass, brown bullhead and pumpkinseed were calculated for each study lake. the dorset parametric statistics were chieﬂy used to compare trophic position, littoral reliance, and diet composi- tion for the four major ﬁsh species in sudbury lakes to those of reference lakes. one-way anovas were applied to test for differences between sudbury and reference lakes. only once in a test of total trophic niche space did levene’s test indicate a signiﬁcant difference in variance between sudbury and reference lakes; in this case we applied a non- two-way kolmogorov–smirnov test. if parametric, necessary, data were transformed to give a better approximation of normality. log10 transformations were used for continuous data (counts, biomass, etc.) and arcsin square-root transformations for fractions (percent data). linear regressions were used to determine if diver- sity, abundance and biomass data could explain any of the patterns of the stable isotope analysis (sia) and diet analyses. potential explanatory variables were chosen based calculations of on pearson’s corre- lation with sia results. due to low sample size for less common species (i.e., brown bullhead, pumpkin- seed, smallmouth bass), it was not possible to per- form more sophisticated analyses, such as multiple linear regression and redundancy analysis. if a values are adjusted for multiple repeated tests (e.g., bonfer- roni’s correction), some of the relationships reported are not statistically signiﬁcant. however, the overall explanatory patterns of the relationships do not change. results there were considerable differences between ﬁsh communities of the study and reference lakes. rela- tive ﬁsh biomass showed no difference between the study sites (one-way anova, p > 0.05, table 2), but relative density (cpue) was signiﬁcantly higher in sudbury compared to reference lakes (p = 0.029, fig. 1, table 2). the difference in abundance was 352 driven by large populations of small yellow perch in sudbury lakes. reference lakes had signiﬁcantly higher ﬁsh diversity (shannon h’, one-way anova, p < 0.001, fig. 1, table 2) than sudbury lakes which were numerically dominated by yellow perch, with low abundance of pumpkinseed, smallmouth bass, and brown bullhead. in addition to these spe- cies, the reference lakes showed a higher variety of other species, including several minnows, largemouth bass, lake_trout and white sucker, as well as several less common species (table 2). rare in sudbury lakes, there was no difference in total benthic inverte- brate biomass between sudbury lakes and the refer- ence lakes (one-way anova, p = 0.448, fig. 1; and see luek (2011)). while certain invertebrate species were still missing or the remaining species were higher in biomass, which compensated for the difference. species richness was signiﬁcantly higher in the reference lakes (one-way anova, p = 0.036), reﬂecting the more frequent occurrences of larger bodied invertebrates such as amphipoda, gastropoda and pelecypoda. there were no differences between sudbury and reference lakes in mean invertebrate body size (anova, p = 0.938, table 2), but the proportion of invertebrates larger than the mean size was marginally higher in the ref- erence area (anova, p = 0.084, table 2). for chaoborus, separate one-way anovas compar- ing the two study areas revealed no differences in size (p > 0.05), or biomass density (p > 0.05), (p > 0.05, fig. 1). however, variation in all three metrics was very high, so the power of the statistical tests was low. littoral separate one-way anovas were used to compare each ﬁsh species in sudbury lakes to the reference lakes in terms of littoral resource reliance and trophic position (littoral reliance was arcsin square-root trans- formed, fig. 2,3). yellow perch in sudbury lakes had a lower reliance than in reference lakes (p = 0.0024), but no difference in trophic position (p > 0.05). pumpkinseed and brown bullhead had a higher littoral reliance in sudbury lakes (p = 0.008 and p = 0.003, respectively), and again showed no difference in trophic position (p > 0.05). in contrast, smallmouth bass (where present), did not differ between sudbury and reference in percent littoral resource reliance (p > 0.05), but had a higher trophic position in sudbury (p = 0.001). according to mixsir models, the diet of yellow perch differed considerably between sudbury and reference lakes. in sudbury, zooplankton and chaob- orus made up a signiﬁcant amount of their diet (p = 0.022 and p = 0.02, respectively), whereas perch from reference lakes appeared to rely more on chironomids (p = 0.055, fig. 3). diet patterns for the other ﬁsh species, i.e., pumpkinseed, brown bullhead table 2. summary of one-way anovas wherein ﬁsh population metrics as well as benthic and

different between sudbury and reference lakes. this larger estimates of total trophic niche space in each lake showed moderate variation among the sudbury lakes and high variation among the reference lakes (fig. 4). total trophic niche spaces in sudbury lakes were, on average, smaller than in reference lakes (two-sided kolmogorov–smirnov test, p = 0.020). in reference lakes, trophic niche space along with higher ﬁsh diversity resulted in no difference in mean nearest neighbour distance between species present. hence, trophic connectivity between species was sim- ilar. the convex hull areas provided a closer exami- nation of realised feeding niches of the four focal ﬁsh species (fig. 5). yellow perch had signiﬁcantly larger trophic niche spaces in sudbury compared to refer- ence lakes (one-way anova, p = 0.001). pumpkin- seed, brown bullhead and smallmouth bass showed (p > 0.05, no differences between study areas fig. 5). a suite of linear regressions was used to determine if littoral resource reliance, trophic position and diet composition could be explained by parameters, such as ﬁsh density, diversity, and biomass; benthic inver- tebrate diversity, biomass or mean length; and cha- oborus density and biomass (table 3). for the variables the reference lakes, littoral resource reliance, trophic position and diet composi- tion all had strong positive correlations with benthic invertebrate metrics. for these lakes there were also positive relationships between each ﬁsh species’ tro- phic position and benthic invertebrate biomass, as relationships between littoral well as resource and of anisoptera (table 3). only in the reference lakes was trophic position of all four major ﬁsh species positively related to the biomass of benthic invertebrates present (table 3). furthermore, trophic positions of bullhead (r2 = 0.781; p = 0.038), pumpkinseed (r2 = 0.785; p = 0.021), and yellow perch (r2 = 0.731; p = 0.039) increased signiﬁcantly in the presence of signiﬁcant reliance biomass larger benthic invertebrates (mean invertebrate length, table 3). in sudbury lakes, on the other hand, yellow perch trophic position was signiﬁcantly higher when cha- r2 = 0.808; oborus abundance (log transformed, p = 0.002) or biomass (log transformed, r2 = 0.607, p = 0.023) was higher (table 3). littoral reliance increased with chironomid consumption (r2 = 0.614; p = 0.022) and decreased with chaobours consum- tion (r2 = 0.634; p = 0.017) only in the sudbury lakes. in the reference lakes, yellow perch trophic position decreased with higher consumption of chir- onomids. changes in average invertebrate size did not inﬂuence trophic position or littoral resource reli- ance of yellow perch. discussion to are hold species thought it has become a common belief in

(1994), loreau et al. (2001)). aquatic ecosystems damaged by industrial typically have reduced species diversity (gower et al. 1994; keller & gunn 1995). activities in sudbury lakes, the lingering effects of industrial damage provided a good opportunity to study the function of different parts of damaged ecosystems. sudbury lakes were challenged in several ways. following decades of metal contamination and acidi- ﬁcation, the lakes have recovered substantially, but still have reduced species richness in zooplankton (valois et al. 2010), ﬁsh (doka et al. 2003) and benthic invertebrates (szkokan-emilson et al. 2010; wesolek et al. 2010a). for ﬁsh, low diversity might have limited the ability of both forage ﬁsh and piscivores respective food fully their to exploit 353 (b) (d) luek et al.

primarily pelagic species. the benthos of sudbury lakes have signiﬁ- cantly lower diversity in, or were completely missing, taxa, such as ephemeroptera, trichoptera, odonata, amphipoda and mollusks than the dorset reference area (szkokan-emilson et al. 2010; wesolek et al. 2010a). these large-bodied species are the most favoured prey of ﬁshes. interestingly, although benthos of sudbury lakes are reduced in diversity (szkokan-emilson et al. 354 2010; wesolek et al. 2010a), biomass, an aggregate community metric, was the same as in undamaged reference lakes (luek 2011, luek et al. unpublished data). overall, benthos biomass in sudbury lakes did not vary compared to reference lakes. however, lower biomass of larger species in sudbury was com- pensated for with a higher biomass of smaller bodied forms, especially chironomids. the difference in ﬁsh populations between sudbury and reference lakes was not reﬂected in a difference in biomass. the index netting survey showed that sudbury lakes had a much less similarly, impaired benthos favours pelagic forage reliance in ﬁsh community fig. 2. trophic position and littoral resource reliance of the four main ﬁsh species calculated

higher in sudbury than in reference lakes. thus, total biomass in reference lakes was made up of fewer large ﬁsh and was distributed across more species. this similarity in ﬁsh biomass between the reference and sudbury lakes is unlikely to be a result of higher levels of total phosphorus in the latter (table 1). the positive effects of tp on ﬁsh biomass are manifested in orders of magnitude not the 2.39 difference we found between our lake groups (hanson & leggett 1982). contrary to what might be expected from theory relating biodiversity to ecosystem function, we found that biomass, an aggregate community metric, was similar in low and high diversity lakes for both ben- thos and ﬁsh. for ﬁsh populations, our analyses of diet helped to reveal the patterns of energy ﬂow that allowed the maintenance of ﬁsh biomass despite low species diversity. our impaired and reference lakes all had the same overall ecosystem components. how- ever, both low ﬁsh diversity and reduced benthos body size in sudbury lakes led to differences in the energy pathways in sudbury lakes versus reference lakes. fishes in lakes rely on energy that originates from two different sources. phytoplankton is the pelagic source and ﬁsh exploit it by consuming zooplankton, where as terrestrial and benthic primary production is the littoral source that ﬁnds its way to ﬁsh through benthic invertebrates. it is now well known that most north temperate ﬁsh species rely to a large degree on benthic invertebrate prey and littoral energy sources (vander zanden & vadeboncoeur 2002). especially for common, littoral species, such as yellow perch, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed and cyprinids, up to 70% of their food is derived from littoral sources. benthivory is especially beneﬁcial for ﬁsh, as the efﬁciency of energy transfer through benthic path- ways than through pelagic pathways (vander zanden et al. 2006). benthic invertebrates can provide ﬁsh the energy needed to grow faster to a size where the switch to piscivory can be made, and this ontogenetic shift is especially important for yellow perch (rasmussen et al. 2008). if this diet shift is hampered by a limited supply of benthic prey, it may pose an energetic bottleneck and this may be occurring in sudbury (iles & rasmussen 2005). is higher the main difference in topology of the food webs of the two study areas was that all the reference lakes had additional pelagic (mainly lake_trout) and littoral (largemouth bass) piscivores, as well as a variety of minnow species and white sucker. these differences in ﬁsh species composition, as well as dissimilarities in benthos noted above, created differences in the pathways of energy ﬂow in the sudbury and refer- ence lakes. 355 luek et al. fig. 3. diet likelihoods of the four main ﬁsh species in sudbury area lakes and reference area lakes are presented as means by area with error bars of one standard deviation. asterisks (*) and hash marks (#) indicate differences between the two study areas that were signiﬁcant at p < 0.05, and p < 0.1 respectively. invertebrates, in particular, suggest that the benthic energy pathways in our reference lakes had a strong inﬂuence on ﬁsh diet. in terms of diet breadth of the whole ﬁsh commu- nity, total feeding niche space was larger in the refer- ence compared to sudbury lakes, likely because of the higher ﬁsh species diversity in the former. how- ever, despite this higher diversity, species packing or ‘trophic redundancy’ (layman et al. 2007a) in the overall food web was not different between the two study areas. overall, the diets of each ﬁsh species in the refer- ence lakes conformed well with what would be expected based on results from typical small lakes (vander zanden et al. 2006). reliance on benthos was strong, and the higher that reliance, the higher the trophic position of the ﬁsh (table 3). in the refer- ence lakes, littoral resource reliance in ﬁshes was usually above 50% (fig. 2) and the diet likelihood model showed that all species fed heavily on chirono- mids (fig. 3). the smaller omnivores (yellow perch, pumpkinseed, and brown bullhead) increased in tro- phic position when larger invertebrates were present. as chironomids were the only benthic invertebrates in the mixing models, a reliance on other, perhaps higher, trophic level invertebrates could not be deter- mined. however, the strong positive relationships between trophic position and the amount of larger 356 the differences between the food webs of the impacted and reference lakes were related to the impaired benthic communities in sudbury. we focus subsequent discussion on the four most common ﬁsh species found in sudbury lakes that were also abun- dant in the reference lakes: yellow perch, pumpkin- seed, brown bullhead and smallmouth bass. in sudbury lakes, yellow perch littoral resource reli- ance was signiﬁcantly lower than in the reference lakes by about 20% (fig. 2). yellow perch in sudbury did not show evidence of a major reliance on littoral resources, but instead used pelagic prey more than expected (luek et al. 2010). moreover, the trophic niche space for yellow perch was signiﬁcantly larger in sudbury lakes and expanded into the pelagic habi- tat to a larger degree than in the reference lakes, indi- cating a more strongly pelagic diet in sudbury lakes. despite the reduction in littoral resource reliance, the trophic position of yellow perch was the same in sudbury and the reference lakes. to maintain trophic position, sudbury perch must have acquired pelagic prey with a similar trophic position to the benthic impaired benthos favours pelagic forage reliance in ﬁsh community moreover, yellow perch trophic position increased with higher chaoborus abundance and biomass in sudbury lakes, whereas in the reference lakes these relationships were not signiﬁcant (table 3). pumpkinseed, as well as brown bullhead, showed a higher reliance on littoral carbon sources in sudbury compared to reference lakes. their abundance was, however, very low in these lakes. the reason for their increased use of littoral food might well be strong competition with the ubiquitous yellow perch in these lakes, and hence a conﬁnement to a narrow trophic niche. the tropic niche space analysis did not show signiﬁcant differences between study sites, but the low sample size of lakes with these ﬁsh species present (n = 2 for brown bullhead and n = 4 for pumpkin- seed) did not permit a sufﬁciently rigorous analysis. results for the top predator in our study, small- mouth bass, indicated less feeding on littoral inverte- brates and a higher trophic position in sudbury compared to reference lakes. the bass in the sudbury lakes were introduced within the last 4 years and fed heavily on yellow perch (luek et al. 2010). sudbury lakes do not have extensive macrophyte beds for ref- uge and perch are abundant, thus they are likely easy fig. 4. mean total trophic niche space of food webs of sudbury and reference

found in reference lakes. in refer- ence lakes, the trophic position of bass might be low- ered by competition with other piscivores. an overall lower abundance of prey ﬁsh may have resulted in the necessity for bass to feed more on benthic inver- tebrates as well. food either two potential explanations exist for greater pela- gic feeding by perch in sudbury lakes. limited large-bodied benthic invertebrates availability of likely made littoral less available to perch or less efﬁcient to feed on (sherwood et al. 2002a; kovecses et al. 2005). another possibility is that perch abundance in sudbury lakes might have been so high that strong intraspeciﬁc competition resulted in niche broadening and hence a stronger reliance on pelagic food sources by most individu- als. de roos et al. (2002) showed in a simulation model that ﬁsh, such as eurasian perch (perca ﬂu- viatilis linnaeus) that normally feed mostly in the littoral zone should switch to pelagic food if con- speciﬁc density reaches a critical level. this shift would happen even though the risk of predation may be higher offshore. in general, many omnivo- rous ﬁsh in dense populations beneﬁt greatly if they grow large enough to become cannibalistic, and the potential for this advantage could be heightened by intraspeciﬁc competition (van de wolfshaar et al. 2006; huss et al. 2008). the relative importance of a depauperate benthos or of heightened intra- speciﬁc competition, as causes for the increased pelagic resource reliance by yellow perch, cannot be determined from our analysis. 358 that for forage ﬁshes in the reference lakes, a higher species diversity restricted yellow perch to a smaller trophic niche due to stronger interspeciﬁc competition, as well as increased predation risk by a higher diver- sity of piscivores. on the other side, pumpkinseeds, as interspeciﬁc competitors to yellow perch, appeared to be stronger littoral specialists in sudbury lakes, poten- tially due to their low abundance and strong competi- tion with yellow perch. it appears that in sudbury lakes, the strong reliance on pelagic energy sources by perch is a result of a combined effect of reduced pre- dation, low to no interspeciﬁc competition, and the lack of enough littoral invertebrate food to support a strong littoral energy pathway. overall, our three different results have implications for our understanding of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function. we found that, despite reduced diversity at trophic levels – benthic invertebrates, forage ﬁshes and piscivorous ﬁshes – all these food web components managed to maintain standing stocks that were equal in biomass to lakes with normal diversity. we expected a negative relationship between diversity and population biomass but ﬁsh in sudbury lakes maintained population biomasses by relying more heavily on pelagic food (chaoborus) compared to ﬁsh in reference lakes. this shift towards pelagic food has other implications for our understanding of food web functioning in lakes. pelagic food webs in typical temperate lakes are known to be strongly sup- ported by energy subsidies from the benthos – but are they reliant on benthos? we expected, as have others, the benthic subsidy would sustain a impaired benthos favours pelagic forage reliance in ﬁsh community higher biomass of ﬁsh consumers, which should in turn cause cascading effects down the food web (vander zanden et al. 2005).instead, we found that a reduced contribution of larger bodies benthic inverte- brates appeared to have fairly small consequences for lake food web structure and functioning. rather than reduced ﬁsh biomass caused by a reduced littoral invertebrate subsidy, we found no change in the bio- mass of ﬁsh. instead of a possible cascading effect caused by a shift of the major ﬁsh species to pelagic feeding, we found that the biomass of the major pela- gic prey, chaoborus, was unaffected. if, as it seems, pelagic invertebrates can tollerate higher exploitation by ﬁsh, then how strong an advantage is the benthic subsidy to these ﬁsh communities? acknowledgements a project of this size relies on the contributions of many. we are grateful to our summer ﬁeld crew and the staff of lau- rentian’s living with lakes center for their diligence and dedication through years of tough work. this project was ﬁnancially supported by nserc discovery and nserc col- laborative research development grants to charles ramcha- ran, john gunn, bill keller, and norman yan, as well as by other contributions from laurentian university. references appelberg, m. 2000. swedish standard methods for sampling freshwater ﬁsh with multi-mesh gillnets. fiskeriverket infor- mation 2000: 30. barrie, a. & prosser, s.j.
