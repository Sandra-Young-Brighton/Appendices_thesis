diel shifts; foraging behaviour; consumption introduction a challenge to understanding animal population dynamics is distinguishing the roles of extrinsic (e.g., food availability) versus intrinsic (e.g., behav- iour) factors in determining population size (mougeot et al. 2003). for juvenile salmonids, the resolution of this issue requires determining how individuals respond through behaviour, dispersal and growth to variation in their environment. although there is both theoretical and empirical support for population-level responses to variable physical conditions and biolog- ical interactions (elliott 1990a,b; keeley 2001; ken- nedy et al. 2008), the mechanistic links between the plasticity of individual foraging behaviour and its relationship to density, food availability and habitat quality remain less well understood. because consumption is a critical determinant of growth and survival for ﬁshes, disparities in individual foraging have measurable effects at the population level (kennedy et al. 2008). for salmonids, consump- tion can be particularly important in the ﬁrst season of life, when growth has long-term ﬁtness consequences (milner et al. 2003; armstrong 2005). however, the patchy distribution of favourable foraging habitat in streams (nislow et al. 2000; armstrong et al. 2003), combined with competition (keeley 2001; ward et al. 2006) and the risk of predation, creates a dynamic array of foraging scenarios that juvenile ﬁsh must negotiate to consume food, grow and survive. correspondence: kara j. cromwell, department of fish and wildlife resources, university of idaho, po box 441136, moscow, id 83844-1136, usa. e-mail: kara.cromwell@vandals.uidaho.edu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00512.x 421 cromwell & kennedy that balance metabolic costs, when confronted with different foraging opportu- nities, ﬁsh can modify their behaviour based on individual risk–beneﬁt trade-offs (grand & dill 1999; grand 2002) food requirements and predation risk (metcalfe et al. 1998; heggenes et al. 1999; keeley 2001). because juvenile salmonids are not strictly diurnal or nocturnal, shifting diel foraging patterns is one means by which they utilise alternative foraging options (metcalfe et al. 1998; reebs 2002). in general, a strategy of nocturnal foraging and daytime sheltering from pre- dators can minimise the risk of mortality per unit of energy consumed (metcalfe et al. 1999), but salmo- nids can shift their pattern of diel activity in response to temperature (fraser et al. 1993), prey density (alanara & bra¨nna¨s 1997; orpwood et al. 2006), competitor density (alanara et al. 2001) and predation risk (metcalfe et al. 1999). because the ectothermic metabolism of ﬁsh establishes a temperature-depen- dent minimum on energy intake, at higher tempera- tures ﬁsh may need to forage more often, including at less favourable day times (fraser et al. 1993; hegg- enes et al. 1993). at colder temperatures, however, they can forage almost exclusively at night (fraser et al. 1993, 1995; bremset 2000). similarly, ﬁsh may have to forage more frequently if their body condition worsens or food availability decreases, either through lower productivity or higher competition (metcalfe et al. 1998, 1999). this can lead to temporal segre- gation, with dominant individuals feeding at preferred (night) times and subdominants foraging more during the day (alanara et al. 2001). based on the evidence for diel foraging shifts as responses to variable energetic demands, we charac- terised temporal patterns in foraging habitat use, behaviour and consumption in populations of juvenile wild chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) in the salmon river drainage (id, usa) that have differences in parr-to-smolt survival rates measured over several years (achord et al. 2003). because these populations face many threats to persistence, is to understand factors that could limit important population growth even at low densities and in otherwise unimpacted wilderness watersheds (achord et al. 2003). for example, a prevailing hypothesis for survival differences suggests that density is an impor- tant regulator in these oligotrophic systems (achord et al. 2003), but there is little evidence that densities are inﬂuencing consumption or behaviour, and the relative inﬂuence of biological and physical factors is unclear. it our broad goal was to determine whether survival disparities in natural populations of chinook salmon in the salmon river drainage could be attributed to differences in physical environment or to interactions among foragers. our ﬁrst objective was to examine 422 spatial and temporal differences in foraging habitats used by chinook salmon, including both physical variables and local ﬁsh community composition and density, which likely affect the level of competition foraging ﬁsh experience. the second objective was to test for diel shifts in foraging activity, as evidence that ﬁsh are experiencing differential metabolic or com- petitive stress. because diel shifts may be state- dependent responses to resource competition (e.g., alanara et al. 2001), this analysis focused on relating ﬁsh size to foraging behaviour. our third objective was to estimate daily consumption in situ, thereby linking observations of chinook salmon foraging habitat, activity and size to realised energy intake. methods study location based on 20 years of demographic surveys, parr-to- smolt survival of juvenile chinook salmon varies widely throughout the salmon river basin, but some of the highest and lowest survival estimates have been measured in a single tributary called big creek, in idaho, usa. a population that rears in the upper reaches of big creek has low-survival estimates (10– 15%), whereas survival estimates are high (30–40%) for ﬁsh rearing in the lower drainage (achord et al. 2003; zabel & achord 2004). big creek is a large (1444 km2) tributary to the middle fork salmon river, located in the frank church river of no return wilderness of central idaho, and containing some of the most pristine stream habitat accessible to anadromous salmon in the columbia river basin. therefore, observations of ﬁsh behaviour are not confounded by hatchery activities or extensive geomorphological, hydrological or chemical disturbances. the ﬁsh community in big creek comprises anadromous chinook salmon and steelhead (o. mykiss) and resident salmonids including wests- lope cutthroat trout (o. clarki), bull trout (salvelinus conﬂuentus) and mountain whiteﬁsh (prosopium wil- liamsoni). low densities of nonnative brook_trout (s. fontinalis) occur in the upper drainage. we compared habitat, behaviour and consumption patterns in low- versus high-survival areas previously reported for big creek (e.g., achord et al. 2003). two 100-m study reaches were selected in each of two study areas, upper big creek (low-survival area; hereafter, ubc) and lower big creek (high-survival area; hereafter, lbc), for a total of four reaches (fig. 1). diel foraging behaviour and habitat observations of juvenile chinook salmon behaviour and habitat were made once per month in each study diel foraging in juvenile chinook salmon w n s e logan creek upper big creek study area big creek lower big creek study area monumental creek rush creek i l  m d d e f o r k s a m o n r v e r l  i fig. 1. big creek watershed, id, usa. black points indicate ﬁeld sites within upper and lower big creek study areas, sampled throughout summer 2007. study area area during june through august 2007 (lbc n = 47, ubc n = 75). observations occurred during snorkel surveys made every 6 h over a 24-h period, beginning at 0500 hours. when densities were sufﬁcient, eight ﬁsh were located and observed for 5 min by two snorkelers starting at a random point in the reach and moving upstream on opposite sides. when sufﬁcient replicates were present, snorkelers observed every fourth chinook salmon encountered; in low-density areas, every second ﬁsh was observed. in higher- density areas, ﬁsh sometimes foraged in aggregations in pools; in this case, only one ﬁsh from the pool habitat was observed, which insured that sample ﬁsh were dispersed in different habitat units throughout the stream and unlikely to inﬂuence each other’s behav- iour. to characterise foraging behaviour, snorkelers recorded the number of feeding strikes for each ﬁsh; the radius within which feeding strikes were made; the number of aggressive interactions and species of ﬁsh involved; and whether the ﬁsh relocated from its initial position during observation. fish were considered to be foraging as their dominant behaviour if they were exposed in the water column and made at least one foraging strike per min. if a ﬁsh was visible but appeared to be sheltering (i.e., using cover and not making feeding strikes), this behaviour was noted. during behaviour observations, snorkelers also esti- mated total length (tl) of the focal ﬁsh to the nearest mm using rulers attached to underwater slates. to describe biological characteristics of the foraging territory of each ﬁsh, we recorded tl and distance to the nearest conspeciﬁc neighbour, and the presence and species of heterospeciﬁcs within a 2-m radius of the focal ﬁsh. density has been estimated in big creek by electroﬁshing reaches 100–200 m long (achord et al. 2003; holecek et al. 2009), but individual ﬁsh 0 5 10 20 km modified from holecak et al. 2009 may experience density at a ﬁner spatial scale, which is not representative of reach-scale densities (grant et al. 1998). because individual foraging interactions were our focus, we measured local density of conspe- ciﬁcs surrounding the focal ﬁsh. local density was deﬁned as the number of ﬁsh within a 2-m radius of the focal individual, which was a distance sufﬁcient to encompass the foraging radii of the focal ﬁsh and adjacent neighbours. following each observation, a unique marker was placed at the focal point of the observed ﬁsh. when the entire survey was completed, seven physical variables were measured at each focal point. total habitat depth and depth of the focal ﬁsh were measured with a wading rod, and focal water velocity was measured with a sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocim- eter (adv). measuring tapes were used to measure three pieces of substrate directly beneath the focal point, distance of the focal point from the head of the pool in which the ﬁsh maintained position and distance to cover. we deﬁned cover as anything that provided concealment for an age-0 chinook salmon, including woody debris, rock outcrops, undercut banks and vegetation. the cover that was closest to the ﬁsh was assigned a cover complexity rating of 1–5, where higher values indicate increasing structural complexity in the cover (detailed in holecek et al. 2009). we recorded temperature using underwater temperature loggers anchored in each study reach throughout the summer. consumption we made in situ estimates of food consumption through stomach content analysis that followed each diel behaviour survey, so that foraging activity could 423 cromwell & kennedy be linked with diel consumption. after behaviour observations were complete in a reach, ﬁsh were collected by hand-netting when possible, and occa- sionally by electroﬁshing (lbc n = 53, ubc n = 65). at each interval, ﬁsh were captured from a location within the reach to minimise different opportunity for recapturing the same individuals. sampling for stomach contents occurred at 6-h intervals beginning at 0600. because entire observa- tion surveys were completed before collecting the ﬁsh, it was not possible to relate foraging behaviour to stomach contents for individuals. fish were held in aerated containers, anesthetised with ms-222 and measured for wet weight and tl. all individuals were measured and weighed, and stomach contents were collected by gastric lavage (meehan & miller 1978) from up to eight ﬁsh, as available. samples were preserved in 70% ethanol, returned to the laboratory, dehydrated for 24-h at 60 °c and weighed to obtain dry mass (dmsc). because ﬁsh were sampled for stomach contents in situ, dry mass of ﬁsh (dmf) was equation dmf = 0.285 wmf (kawaguchi et al. 2007), where wmf is the wet weight of individual consumption at a single time point was calculated as the mass of stomach contents relative to the body mass of the ﬁsh: estimated from the the ﬁsh. c ¼ dmsc=dmf consumption between the 6-h sampling intervals was estimated by the following equation from elliot & persson (1978): ct ¼ ðst   s0e rtþ rt ð1   e rtþ 1 where ct is the weight of food consumed during an interval of t hours, s0 and st are the mean weights of stomach contents at the beginning and end of the t-h interval, and r is the exponential gastric evacuation rate estimated at water temperature t (°c) with the equation from kawaguchi et al. (2007): r ¼ e 5:439 þ 0:0224t average food consumption over a 24-h interval was expressed as consumption rate, cr (average mass of food consumed hourly), and daily ration (% body mass of food consumed daily). from ct, the mean daily consumption rate (mgæh )1) was estimated as: cr ¼ ctt 1 where t = 24 h. mean daily ration (gæg )1æday each 24-h sampling period by:x )1) was estimated for statistical analyses foraging behaviours were compared between study areas and between day and night within a study area using wilcoxon rank-sum tests (for rate of aggressive interactions) or t-tests when parametric assumptions were met (for feeding rate). pearson’s chi-square test, which is a method to test for independence between categorical variables, was used to evaluate the rela- tionship between time of day and the frequency of foraging or aggressive interactions within study areas. pearson’s chi-square tests were also used to evaluate biological including the frequency with which cohorts and heterospeciﬁc ﬁsh were observed in foraging territories. local density of juvenile chinook and nearest neighbour distance were compared between areas with t-tests. differences in physical foraging habitat were evaluated using wil- coxon rank-sum tests (for total depth, focal depth, velocity, distance to cover and cover complexity) and t-tests (for substrate size, distance to the head of pool and temperature). traits of foraging habitats, regression, we explored the cumulative effects of biological and physical parameters on feeding rate using least- squares multiple linear followed by a model comparison procedure for upper and lbc separately. eight candidate models were created a priori based on eight biological and physical variables measured in chinook salmon foraging territories (see table 3). velocity data were log transformed, and an extreme outlier was removed from distance from head of pool data to improve normal distributions. all pairs of predictor variables were evaluated for multicollin- earity, insuring that no correlation coefﬁcient exceeded r = 0.50. after generating the model set, contributions of the covariates to model ﬁt were examined by comparing values of akaike’s information criteria adjusted for small sample size (aicc; burnham & anderson 2002). aic rewards better ﬁt but penalise for more parameters, such that smaller aicc values indicate ‘better’ models. to compare models, we calculated the difference in aicc values (daicc) and converted them to akaike weights (wi), which express the relative likelihood of each model within a set and can be used to compare the weight of evidence for one model (or, if summed, a group of models) over another (burnham & anderson 2002). differences in individual consumption (dmsc ⁄ dmf) were evaluated between study areas using wilcoxon rank-sum tests. because replicates were pooled to calculate consumption rate and ration estimates, there were <4 data points per sampling event, and these estimates were not subjected to further statistical analysis. ðct=dmfþ differences in ﬁsh size (tl and mass) between areas and between day and night within an area were 424 evaluated with t-tests. to examine the relationship of ﬁsh size to speciﬁc traits of habitat or behaviour, we evaluated the spearman’s correlation matrix of ﬁsh tl with habitat and behaviour variables and considered to be present when rs ‡ 0.50 and correlations p £ 0.05. to test the hypothesis that size inﬂuences the probability of foraging with other ﬁsh, we used logistic regression, which is a regression approach that tests for independence of a continuous predictor (here, focal ﬁsh tl) and a categorical response variable (here, presence or absence of cohorts and other ﬁsh species in the feeding territory). linear regression analysis was used to determine the effect of ﬁsh size (tl) on individual consumption (dmsc ⁄ dmf). results fish size fish captured during surveys in lbc were signiﬁcantly larger (mean ± se; 71 ± 2 mm; t163 = 2.0, p = 0.04) and heavier (3.5 ± 0.3 g; t163 = 2.0, p = 0.04) than the ﬁsh in ubc (60 ± 2 mm; 2.9 ± 0.2 g). in ubc, the tl of ﬁsh observed foraging at night tended to be greater than during the day (t96 = 1.9, p = 0.06), but in lbc, there was no size difference between day and night foragers (table 1, fig. 2). diel foraging behaviour and habitat behaviour mean feeding rate (foraging strikes per min) was in ubc than in lbc (ubc: statistically greater table 1. values for biotic variables measured in foraging microhabitats used by juvenile chinook salmon in big creek, id, usa, expressed either as mean ± se and range (for continuous variables) or % observations (for categorical variables). habitat variable upper big creek lower big creek mean ± se (range) or % day focal ﬁsh size (mm)* local density (no. ﬁsh in 2-m radius)* other chinook present (% observations)* other ﬁsh species present (% observations) night focal ﬁsh size (mm) local density (no. ﬁsh in 2-m radius)* other chinook present (% observations)* other ﬁsh species present (% observations) 62 ± 2 (29–85) 5 ± 0.4 (1–15) 68 ± 2 (48–84) 2 ± 0.2 (1–7) 92 71 83** 76** 69 ± 1 (55–82) 4 ± 0.4 (1–8) 69 ± 2 (56–84) 2 ± 0.2 (1–3) 88 88 33** 50** *variables that differed signiﬁcantly (p £ 0.05) between study areas. **values that differed signiﬁcantly (p £ 0.05) between day and night within a study area. diel foraging in juvenile chinook salmon lbc day night ubc 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 y c n e u q e r f y c n e u q e r f 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 chinook salmon total length (mm) fig. 2. length-frequency distributions of the total length (mm) of juvenile chinook salmon observed foraging in lower (lbc) and upper (ubc) big creek, id during day and night. 4.8 ± 0.4;

v2 1;47 = 12, p < 0.01; table 1). logistic regression indicated that, in ubc, larger ﬁsh were more likely to forage in habitats with other ﬁsh species (v2 1;75 = 25, p < 0.01), but this relation- ship was not in lbc (v2 1;47 = 1.0, p = 0.31). in both areas, however, tl of the focal ﬁsh was positively correlated with tl of (lbc: rs = 0.83, p < 0.01;

night: 2 ± 0.2; w1,75 = 645, p < 0.01), but no other physical vari- ables had signiﬁcant diel differences. fish size was correlated with physical habitat traits only in lbc, where moderate correlations were measured between ﬁsh tl and distance to head of pool (rs = )0.50, p < 0.01) and cover complexity (rs = 0.52, p < 0.01). foraging models the top lbc model (i.e., model with lowest aic value) included the physical habitat covariates tem- perature, velocity and distance from head of pool (table 3). the lowest ranked model included only biotic variables: local density, ﬁsh community and neighbour distance. none of the top four models included biotic variables, and the cumulative weight of the four abiotic models was 0.98 compared to a cumulative weight of 0.02 for models including biotic covariates. when the model set generated for ubc was ranked by aicc values, abiotic and biotic models were interspersed. for example, included temperature, velocity, local density, ﬁsh community and neighbour distance as covariates, but the second model did not include any biotic variables. however, the abiotic models had a lower cumulative weight (0.19 versus 0.81 for biotic models;

holecek et al. 2009), where competition for resources was likely less intense, foraging was less frequent and unrelated to ﬁsh size. in contrast, ﬁsh in the low-survival, high-density area foraged at higher rates throughout the entire day, and foraging behaviour and consumption were inﬂuenced by ﬁsh size. although physical variables affected feeding patterns in both areas, the behaviour of ﬁsh in ubc suggests that their foraging responded to competition in addi- tion to physical habitat factors. in the high-survival, physical aspects of foraging habitats in the two areas differed signiﬁcantly only in temperature and depth, both of which were greater in lbc than in ubc. although there was no analysis of randomised habitat availability in the present study, a habitat survey conducted the previous year reported the same differences in available habitat, along with greater water velocity, substrate size and distance to cover, but lower cover complexity, in lbc (holecek et al. 2009). holecek et al. (2009) also calculated the proportion of the stream channel that had physical characteristics similar to habitats where juvenile chinook salmon were observed. they concluded that, although the ubc study area had a higher proportion of ‘preferred’ habitat patches, there were more ﬁsh per unit area of that habitat because of higher population densities. we observed ﬁsh from high- and low-density areas in similar microhabitats despite differences in habitat availability, which suggests that density was not inﬂuencing microhabitat use in big creek. however, increased crowding of ﬁsh in foraging habitat could result in higher competition for food in the low- survival area, which has the same drifting prey biomass as the high-survival area (cromwell & kennedy, in review). leads to diel higher densities of cohorts or heterospeciﬁcs can create competition that shifts of subdominant ﬁsh to less favourable foraging times (gries et al. 1997; heggenes et al. 1999; harwood et al. 2001; blanchet et al. 2008). in addition, ﬁsh may increase daytime foraging when food intake is low (bull et al. 1996; metcalfe et al. 1999), which could be the effective result of competition in big creek’s high-density area. behaviours observed in ubc, where smaller chinook avoided heterospeciﬁc habitats 428 and foraged during the day, were consistent with these responses to competition and suggest the inﬂuence of the biotic factors on foraging. because the smallest size classes were segregated to daytime foraging in ubc but not in lbc, we suspect that intrinsic factors (i.e., size or condition) also affect foraging differently in the low versus high-survival area. few studies have described diel foraging in stream rearing age-0 chinook salmon (but see sagar & glova 1988; bradford & higgins 2001), but there is evidence that other juvenile salmon shift to more nocturnal behaviour as they grow (gries & juanes 1998; bradford & higgins 2001; imre & boisclair 2004). the tendency of larger ﬁsh to become nocturnal may be explained by the ‘asset protection principle’ (clarke 1994), which hypothesises that individuals with higher ‘investment’ in accumulated body mass are less likely to take risks, such as foraging during the day when they are more visible to predators (bradford & higgins 2001). conversely, smaller ﬁsh can max- imise growth by risking predation to take advantage of the higher scope for growth at daytime temperatures. in ubc, the full range of size classes were observed foraging during the day, but night foragers tended to be only larger members of the cohort. because there was not clear partitioning between size classes, it is unlikely that smaller ﬁsh found refuge from compe- tition during the day, but increased consumption in daytime conditions may have provided the bioener- getic trade-off for in diel comparisons, feeding rates were equivalent during day and night in ubc, but daytime consumption was actually higher. this demonstrates that diurnal foraging was more efﬁcient, probably due to enhanced visibility (fraser & metcalfe 1997). this risk. temperature is a crucial determinant of ﬁsh foraging in and growth, and there is ample evidence that, addition to competition or ﬁsh size, temperature differences also prompt diel behaviour shifts (fraser et al. 1993, 1995; heggenes et al. 1993; bremset 2000). prior studies have reported a switch by juvenile salmonids to nocturnal activity when temperatures drop below 10 °c, a threshold associated with a decline in maximum ration and therefore growth opportunity (e.g., fraser et al. 1993, 1995). average daily temperatures in ubc (10.8 ± 2.9 °c) straddled this threshold, a factor that may inﬂuence high nocturnal activity levels in ubc compared with lbc. although water temperature dropped to a minimum of 8 °c during the study period, mean temperature (15.6 ± 3.0 °c) was signiﬁcantly higher. in this study area, ﬁsh were feeding more during the day (when the scope for activity was higher) but probably sheltering and digesting at night (brett & groves 1979). at lower temperatures, however, ﬁsh may become nocturnal because the scope for growth is also lower, making feeding at high risk (i.e., day) times less proﬁtable (metcalfe et al. 1999). faster like foraging behaviour and size, consumption also differed between study areas. although they were smaller, ﬁsh in ubc had higher consumption relative to their size and consumed food at rates, particularly in the late summer. one interpretation of this is informed by ongoing work in the big creek basin, which demonstrates that larger ﬁsh begin emigrating upper watershed reaches by late summer (b.p.k. unpublished data). although state-dependent movements were not measured or controlled for as part of they would have signiﬁcant implications for foraging and consumption of salmon measured in big creek. for example, in late summer, ubc supports a non emigrant population of smaller individuals, which would presumably feed near maxi- mal rates when temperatures are most favourable for growth. in lbc, however, size could be decoupled from apparent foraging if these larger individuals represent a transient, mobile subpopulation emigrating to suitable fall and winter habitat. study, this in big creek are our current ﬁndings reveal that spatially explicit foraging patterns inﬂuenced differently by physical and biological factors. we also suggest that considering state-dependent movements may be necessary to link foraging differences to observed survival patterns. further research is required to explain the effects of early life mobility on the condition, foraging ecology and population dynamics measured for salmonids in big creek and similar stream networks. acknowledgements we thank three anonymous
