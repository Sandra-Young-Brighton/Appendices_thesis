ward & stanford, 1983; westhorpe, mitrovic, growns, hadwen, & rees, 2015). the physical 686  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:686–698. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdand chemical impacts of the impoundment diminish with distance downstream, creating a longitudinal disturbance gradient (stanford & ward, 2001). changes in algal and macroinvertebrate assemblages (cortez, growns, mitrovic, & lim, 2012), mussels (randklev et al., 2016; vaughn & taylor, 1999) and fish species (ward & stanford, 1983) have been observed along these disturbance gradients. fishes appear particularly sensitive to such disturbance, and abrupt declines in native fish abundance and diversity, as well as the proliferation of cold- water invasive species, are often observed below impoundments (bain, finn, & booke, 1988; clarkson & childs, 2000; quinn & kwak, 2003). the recovery of native fish abundance and diversity (kinsolving & bain, 1993; miranda & dembkowski, 2015; phillips & johnston, 2004; travnichek, bain, & maceina, 1995), and the transition from cold- water invasive to warm- water native fish species (reyjol, lim, dauba, baran, & belaud, 2001), takes place as the effects of the disturbance diminish downstream. yet, these disturbance gradi- ents can persist for hundreds of kilometres and thus represent a major threat to the integrity of river environments (stanford & ward, 2001). the mechanisms underpinning changes to fish assemblages down- stream of impoundments are largely unknown, but are considered to reflect disruption to reproduction and recruitment (humphries & lake, 2000; humphries, sefafini, & king, 2002; humphries et al., 2008) and effects on growth (schiemer, 2000). bioenergetics models, in which consumed energy is allocated to metabolism, wastes and growth (hanson, johnson, schindler, & kitchell, 1997; kitchell, stewart, & weininger, 1977), have been developed for marine and freshwater species to explore a range of management and conservation applications (chipps & wahl, 2008). these models provide a sound theoretical basis on which to assess the growth responses of fish to flow velocity and temperature distur- bance gradients (hanson et al., 1997; kitchell et al., 1977). indeed, environmental gradient theory (hall, stanford, & hauer, 1992) inti- mates that inter- and intraspecific variation in the bioenergetic re- sponses of individuals, manifesting as differential rates of growth, should mediate the reproduction, survival and ultimately the fitness of fish communities along these disturbance gradients. to date, bio- energetics modelling of the downstream impact of impoundments has usually focused on temperature (bevelheimer, 2002; paukert & petersen, 2007; petersen & paukert, 2005), yet some studies have explored the combined effects of flow velocity and temperatures (wildhaber et al., 2015). the murray–darling basin in south- eastern australia is one of the most regulated freshwater systems in the world, with more than 100 large (intake depth >10 m and discharge >12 m3s-1) impound- ments (lugg & copeland, 2014). these impoundments combine to create disturbance gradients along the upper and mid reaches of many rivers, which have been implicated in the decline in distribu- tion and abundance of native fish species across the murray–darling basin (lugg & copeland, 2014). below one such impoundment, hume dam on the river murray in the southern murray–darling basin, modelling revealed severe population impacts due to re- duced spawning success in the large, long- lived ambush predator, the murray cod (maccullochella peellii), due to impacted temperature     |  687 regimes (sherman, todd, & koehn, 2007). further, the suppressed temperatures of water being released from the impoundment may reduce growth rates (ryan, lennie, & lyon, 2003), whereas flow ve- locity changes may impose considerable energetic swimming costs (whiterod, 2013; whiterod, meredith, & humphries, 2013), thus making the temperature and flow regime below the impoundment bioenergetically unsuitable for the species. exploration of bioen- ergetic responses below the impoundment, as well as along the downstream disturbance gradient, where bioenergetic suitability is anticipated to improve, will help resolve the impacts of altered flow and temperature regimes on this important fish species. this is particularly pertinent as murray cod has suffered considerable population decline across its range and is now listed as threatened under australian (www.environment.gov.au/topics/ threatened- species- ecological- communities). legislation in this study, a bioenergetics model is developed for juvenile murray cod to investigate the likely impacts on growth of the flow velocity and temperature disturbance gradient imposed by hume dam. specifically, we (i) develop and validate the bioenergetics model using a combination of parameter estimation techniques and incor- poration of the swimming cost model of whiterod et al. (2013); (ii) characterise the nature of the flow velocity and temperature regime imposed by hume dam by comparing time- series of temperature and gradients of modelled natural and altered river temperatures downstream of the dam; and (iii) simulate the growth of the species under prevailing flow velocities and temperatures at selected sites along the river murray. changes in flow velocity and temperature regimes and the outcomes of simulations are discussed in the con- text of relevant concepts and hypotheses, and how hypolimnetic- releasing impoundments have contributed to the threatened nature of many native freshwater fish through impact on their bioenergetics and growth. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study location the bioenergetics model for murray cod was developed to simulate growth responses at nine locations along a 1,050 km section, from −233 km upstream to +817 km downstream of hume dam, on the river murray (figure 1), approximately 2,225 km upstream from the river mouth. within the study section, the river changes from a small upland river within the headwater section, to a shallow, low- gradient river channel flowing through the riverine plain and is influenced by several major tributaries (i.e. mitta mitta, kiewa, ovens, campaspe and goulburn rivers), and two weir structures (yarrawonga and torrumbarry) (eastburn, 1990). the upland impoundment hume dam was completed in 1936 and is primarily operated to meet downstream irrigation demand for water over october–april, but also produces small amounts of hydro- electricity, provides recreation activities, miti- gates floodwaters (crabb, 1997) and provides environmental water allocations (docker & robinson, 2014). it is the seventh largest stor- age in australia, with a 51- m dam wall holding back 3.04 × 109 m3 of whiterod et al.688  |     figure 1 map of study section showing the location of 14 sites along the river murray within the southern murray–darling basin, australia. sites 1–14 were used for temperature analysis, whereas the nine sites used for flow velocity and temperature are shown by *. sites are labelled in relation to hume dam (negative distances are upstream; positive distances are downstream): (1*) −233 km, (2*) −160 km, and (3) +1 km, (4*) +10 km, (5) +16 km (6) +99 km, (7*) +154 km, (8*) +239 km, (9*) +340 km, (10) +463 km, (11*) +587 km, (12*) +701 km, (13*) +771 km and (14) +817 km from the impoundment water, with a surface area of 201.9 km2, at full supply (crabb, 1997). under the current management operation, all water is discharged through two hypolimnetic off- takes (hydro- electricity plant, 23.3– 29.5 m below full supply level; irrigation release, 30.6–34.3 m below full supply level), so that downstream temperatures are usually lower than those experienced in the surface water of the impoundment (sherman, 2005). 2.2 | development of the bioenergetics model the bioenergetics model was developed using a modified microsoft excel version of the generalised wisconsin bioenergetics model for nonreproductive juveniles (hanson et al., 1997) (equation 1): gs = c − (ms + ma + md) − (f + u) (1) whiterod et al.where somatic growth (gs) is defined by consumed food (c), metabo- lism demand (standard [ms], active [ma], and digestive metabolism [md]), and waste losses (egestion [f], and excretion [u]). the model was balanced in common energetic units (g g−1 day−1), using the body weight (w) to energy density (ed) relationship of whiterod (2010) (equation 2): ed = 4318.0 + 0.577 ⋅ w (2) following others (petersen, deangelis, & paukert, 2008; petersen & paukert, 2005), the bioenergetics model for this threatened spe- cies was parameterised through a combination of laboratory experi- ments, monte carlo filtering and borrowing from published literature. throughout the paper, all body weights are presented in grams (g) on a wet weight basis. 2.2.1 | consumption parameters food consumption (c, grams of food per grams of body weight per day, g g−1 day−1) was calculated as the proportion (p) of the maximum possible consumption (cmax) defined by both weight- and temperature- dependent functions (hanson et al., 1997) (equation 3): c = cmax ⋅ p ⋅ f(t)c, where cmax = ca ⋅ wcb (3) where cmax is the maximum daily specific consumption rate (g g−1 day−1) described by the intercept (ca, g g−1 day−1) and slope (cb, g g−1 day−1) of the allometric cmax function and fish weight (w). the p is a proportionality constant used to account for ecological con- straints on cmax (hanson et al., 1997). the temperature- dependent function for consumption (f(t)c) for warm- water species was used (kitchell et al., 1977) (equation 4): f(t)c = vx ⋅ e(x ⋅(1−v)) which includes the following (hanson et al., 1997) (equations 5–8): v = (ctm − t )∕(ctm − cto) x = ((z2 ⋅ (1 + (1 + 40∕y)0.5)2))∕400 z = ln (cq) ⋅ (ctm − cto) y = ln (cq) ⋅ (ctm − cto + 2) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) this includes the temperature- dependent coefficient for cmax (cq), optimal (cto) and maximum (ctm) temperatures for consumption, and temperature (t). cto (29°c) and ctm (33°c) were set from previous studies (koehn & o’connor, 1990; ryan et al., 2003). the remaining consumption parameters (ca, cb, cq) were derived using monte carlo filtering (petersen & paukert, 2005; petersen et al., 2008), as maximum food consumption experiments were problem- atic for this threatened species. the procedure involves randomly sampling numerous (i.e. 10,000) parameter sets from a given range (for each parameter set), running the bioenergetics model using ex- perimental growth data to predict growth based on each random parameter set and statistically testing the output to a test criterion     |  689 (rose, smith, gardner, & brenkert, 1991). as there is no compara- ble information for similar species, the random parameter sets were drawn from broad parameter ranges (ca, 0.01 to 0.4; cb, −0.15 to −0.4, cq, 2 to 3). data from two previous growth experiments were utilised to fit parameters through monte carlo filtering: ingram and de silva (2004) (hereafter referred to as experiment 1) measured the growth of advanced juveniles (initial mean 81.0–86.5 g) over 86 days at three temperatures (20, 22.5 and 25°c), whereas ryan et al. (2003) (experiment 2) investigated the growth of small juve- niles (initial 2.67–2.83 g) over 90 days at five temperatures (12.6, 15.5, 18.5, 21.2 and 24.2°c). growth data from the highest tem- perature in each experiment (24.2 and 25°c) were used to give es- timates close to the optimal growth for this warm- water species. in experiment 1, murray cod, on average, grew from to 81.5–124.0 g after 42 days (halfway) and 162.5 g at the end of the experiment (day 86), whereas fish grown in experiment 2 were between 2.67 and 7.21 g after 42 days and 2.76 to 14.37 g after 90 days. preliminary simulations revealed that the assumption that fish were feeding optimally (p = 1.0) led to weight trajectories that did not meet test criteria. thus, it was likely that fish were feeding below satiation (p < 1.0), due perhaps to nonoptimal temperature, food sources not being ideal or interference competition (in experiment 1). subsequently, the p was allowed to vary (0 to 1.0) and sampled as a random parameter, similar to ca, cb and cq (petersen & paukert, 2005). for each of the random parameter sets, the bioenergetics model was run using final full parameter estimates from table 1 with input data (diet, flow velocity and starting weight) from the two tem- peratures (24.2 and 25°c) and modelled weight trajectories compared with a test criteria requiring fish weight to be within ±1 se of actual growth at each experiment day (e.g. days 48 and 86 for experiment 1; days 42 and 90 during experiment 2). parameter sets resulting in weight trajectories that failed the test criteria were eliminated, and the final ca, cb and cq parameter estimates were determined as average values of all successful parameter sets. 2.2.2 | metabolism parameters total metabolism (m, g g−1 day−1) was estimated using functions to describe ms, ma, md (hanson et al., 1997) (equation 9): m = [ra ⋅ wrb ⋅ f(t )m] + [act] + [sda ⋅ (c − f)] (9) where ms is described by the intercept (ra, g g−1 day−1) and slope (rb, g g−1 day−1) of the allometric metabolism function, fish weight (w) and the temperature- dependent function for metabolism ((f(t )m); ma is de- fined by the activity multiplier (act); and md as a multiplier (sda) of consumed food minus water egestion. the exponential temperature- dependent function (f(t)) incorporated the temperature- dependent coefficient for ms (rq, °c−1) and temperature (t, °c) (stewart, weininger, rottiers, & edsall, 1983) (equation 10): f(t ) = e(rq⋅t ) (10) the parameters (ra, rb and rq) were derived from metabo- lism experiments conducted on 100 fish (ranging between 0.57 and whiterod et al.690  |     table 1 mean estimates (± se) of physiological parameters and sensitivity analysis for final weight (reflecting percentage change based on ±10% variation in parameter estimate) for the juvenile murray cod (maccullochella peelii) bioenergetics model. definitions and symbols following hanson et al.

(2013) was employed, with the act multiplier replaced with the relationship between ma, body weight and flow velocity (u, bls-1) (equation 11): ma = 0.0035 ⋅ w−0.26 ⋅ u2.36 (11) this approach allowed for flow velocity to be input into the model framework. finally, there is currently no information on the md of murray cod, so sda was set to 0.175 (hanson et al., 1997). 2.2.3 | waste parameters there is currently no information on the energy lost to egestion (f) and excretion (u) wastes for murray cod, so these were assumed to whiterod et al.    |  691 be constant proportions (f = 0.19 and u = 0.1) of consumed energy (kitchell et al., 1977) consistent with predatory species (hanson et al., 1997). are constants. following preece and jones (2002), natural and altered gradients of water temperature (t) were modelled by a negative expo- nential growth- limiting equation (equation 14): 2.2.4 | model evaluation the fully parameterised bioenergetics model was evaluated in several ways. firstly, modelling efficiency was assessed by comparing the ob- served and predicted growth based on observed consumption at 20 and 22.5°c from experiment 1 using (mayer & butler, 1993) (equation 12): ef = 1 −ࢣ (wobserved − wpredicted)2 ⋅ (wobserved − wmean)−2 (12) where modelling efficiency (ef) is a function of observed (wobserved) and predicted (wpredicted) weights at each day for the two temperatures, and the mean of observed weight (wmean). secondly, model sensitivity was evaluated using growth estimates produced from these two tempera- tures to identify which parameters of the bioenergetics model have the greatest influence on the model growth estimates (stewart et al., 1983). specifically, parameters estimates were individually varied by ±10% and the adjusted model output for growth at each temperature compared to the base output (using original parameters). finally, eval- uation of the p necessary to achieve weight trajectories observed in experiment 2 (12.5, 15.5, 18.5 and 21.5°c) was undertaken. 2.3 | disturbance gradient imposed by hume dam to illustrate the nature of the disturbance gradient imposed by hume dam, a 5- year time- series (november 2002 to november 2007) of dis- charge and temperature data were obtained for sites along a 1,050 km section of the river murray (figure 1) (pinneena database, nsw office of water). mean daily discharge data were obtained from nine sites (two upstream, −160 and −233 km; seven downstream, +10 to +771 km: figure 1) and converted to mean daily flow velocity experi- enced in the bottom 10% of the water column (using the methods of whiterod et al., 2013) to represent the demersal habitats the species occupies (koehn, 2009b). briefly, this was achieved using relationships between cross- sectional area (m2) and mean daily discharge to esti- mate depth- averaged flow velocity, and then applying the typical loga- rithmic vertical flow velocity profile for rivers (rantz, 1982) to yield bottom flow velocities that were 0.648 times that of depth- averaged estimates. mean daily water temperature data were obtained from 14 sites (figure 1) (two sites were −160 and −233 km upstream of the im- poundment and the remaining 12 sites +1 to +817 km downstream of the impoundment). at each site, the annual maximum water tempera- ture (tmax = tmean + a) was estimated using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess) of the time- series averaged over the study period (cleveland, 1994; preece & jones, 2002) (equation 13): ti = tmean + a ⋅ sin ⋅(2π ⋅ ti ⋅ b−1 + c) (13) where ti is the observed temperature (°c) on day i, tmean is the mean temperature (°c), a is the amplitude of the periodic function (°c), ti is the number of days since january 1 (i.e. ti = january 1), and b and c t = tmax + a ⋅ (1 − e−k⋅x) (14) where tmax is the maximum temperature with increasing distance from impoundment (x), a and k are constants. for the investigation of the natural temperature gradient, tmax from the two upstream sites and three sites (+701, +771 and +817 km) outside of the direct thermal influence of the impoundment was used. for the investigation of the altered temperature gradient, tmax was estimated from the 12 sites downstream of the impoundment. both models were fit by nonlinear regression using the gauss–newton iteration method (using systat 12, spss, chicago usa). 2.4 | bioenergetics simulations bioenergetic simulations were conducted for nine sites along the river murray to assess the influence of the disturbance gradient created by hume dam. at each site, the growth of murray cod was modelled from 1 year old (365 days) to 2 years old (730 days) for 365- day simulations for each year of the 5- year time- series (with final weights averaged across the five yearly simulation periods). it was assumed that murray cod were born on 1 november, guided by the timing of spawning of murray cod in this stretch of the river murray (koehn & harrington, 2006; sherman et al., 2007) and were 182.43 g on day 1 of simulation (at 1 year old), estimated from the known length–weight relationship (rowland, 1998). the limited available studies (e.g. baumgartner, 2007; ebner, 2006) were used to inform dietary shifts in generalised diet for murray cod (table 2) and an average (p = .65) food availability assumed. 3 |  results 3.1 | parameterisation of the model the standard metabolic rate (ms) of murray cod decreased signifi- cantly with body weight (f2,98 = 754.37, p < .001) and increased sig- nificantly with temperature (figure 2). simultaneous nonlinear regression described the best fit (r2 = 0.97, n = 100, p < .001) allometric and temperature dependence of the ms function as (equation 15): (f2,98 = 79.67, p < .001) ms = 0.00140 ⋅ w−0.279 ⋅ e(0.0786⋅t ) (15) monte carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations produced 98 con- sumption parameter sets that fulfilled the test criteria from experi- ments 1 and 2 and the subsequent full consumption equations are (equations 16 and 17): and cmax = 0.362 ⋅ w−0.354 cq = 2.365 (16) (17) the fully parameterised murray cod bioenergetics model is pre- sented in table 1. whiterod et al.692

monte carlo filtering or borrowed from the literature value, but model outputs varied considerably (−31.5% and 32.3%) with changes in the proportion of maximum consumption (table 1). finally, realistic estimates of the proportion of maximum consump- tion (p = 0.52–0.68) were achieved when modelling the weight tra- jectories of juvenile murray cod over the 90 days and the range of temperatures (12.6, 15.5, 18.5 and 21.2°c) in experiment 2. 3.3 | downstream influence of hume dam changes in the flow velocity and temperature regime along the river murray were estimated by averaging data across the 5- year time- series (figures 4 and 5). at sites upstream of the impoundment (−233 km, and to a lesser extent −160 km), mean daily flow veloci- ties gradually declined over the first 6 months of the year before increasing slowly from july to a peak in september to october, con- sistent with the natural flow regime for this area (close, 1990). in contrast, the operation of the impoundment ensured that velocities at the +10 km site regularly switched between constant high dis- charges (and resultant high flow velocity) associated with irrigation releases from october to may and the lowest discharges as water is stored in the hume dam over winter (figure 4). the impact of these impoundment discharges declined with distance downstream, so that the flow velocities approached those similar to natural regimes (as indicated by those experienced upstream of the impoundment) at river sites +239, +340 and +701 km from the impoundment. with distance downstream of the impoundment, the spring and summer temperatures and the amplitude of annual variation increased, and maximum temperatures occurred earlier in the year (figure 5). the thermal effect of hume dam is highlighted by a comparison of significant gradients of natural (tmax = 24.2 + 2.00·e(−0.004·x), r2 = 0.997, p < .001) and altered (tmax = 21.7 + 4.8·e(−0.003·x), r2 = 0.989, p < .001) annual maximum water temperatures (tmax) averaged over the simulation period (figure 6). directly downstream of the impoundment, tmax of the altered regime was 2.4°c cooler (21.7°c) than the natural regime (24.2°c). tmax under the al- tered regime remained 1°c cooler for +262 km, and full temperature was only reached +695 km downstream compared to the natural gradient. 3.4 | bioenergetics simulations

, ), velocity and temperature regimes experienced at the seven sites along the river murray (figure 7). the combined impact of flow veloc- ity and temperature exacerbated differences in the growth responses of juvenile murray cod along the river (171–934 g). upstream of the impoundment, weight trajectories increased between november and june, before declining, as temperatures cooled and flow veloci- ties increased after june. using data averaged from the 5- year time- series, simulations revealed final weights of 381 ± 120 g (−233 km) and 171 ± 75 g (−160 km) at the two sites upstream of the impound- ment. directly downstream of the impoundment (+10 km), net energy gain was not achieved and fish weight tended to zero within 41 to 75 days. at the +154 km site, fish weight after the 365- day simula- tion was estimated at 283 ± 96 g, and at +239 km, it was estimated at 792 ± 30 g. further downstream (+304, +587, +701 and +771 km) juvenile murray cod were predicted to grow between 477 ± 57 and 934 ± 21 g.     |  693 figure 4 composite yearly time- series of mean daily demersal (bottom 10% of water column) flow velocity (ms-1) at the nine sites along the river murray (averaged

cod indicated that temperature and flow velocity regimes imposed downstream of a large hypolimnetic- releasing impoundment may significantly com- promise the growth and survival of fishes. modelling indicated that growth was not possible directly downstream of the impoundment due to the combination of high flow velocities and suppressed tem- peratures. whilst conditions improved with distance downstream along the disturbance gradient, the capacity for growth remained adversely affected for more than 200 km along the river. these find- ings suggest that large hypolimnetic- releasing impoundments degrade conditions for warm- water fish species in this river system and also whiterod et al.694  |     , ), gradients of the annual figure 6 modelled longitudinal natural (, ●), and altered ( maximum temperature (°c) at 14 sites along a 1,050 km section of the river murray in relation to the location of hume dam ( ) (grey/black circles indicate sites that were used in both gradients) as with many hypolimnetically releasing impoundments world- wide, hume dam has severely altered the downstream river envi- ronment (walker, 1980). water temperatures were estimated to be suppressed by 2.4°c directly below the impoundment, whereas flow velocity switched between constant higher- than- natural levels during summer and low levels over the remainder of the year—largely explained by the supplying and storing modes of the impoundment (close, 1990). the impacts of the impoundment did diminish with dis- tance downstream, consistent with the serial discontinuity concept (ward & stanford, 1983), yet improvement of temperatures (greater than 1°c) and flow regimes did not occur between +239 and +255 km, and complete thermal recovery was not predicted to occur until more than 600 km downstream. the magnitude and extent of temperature impacts imposed by hume dam appear less severe than a number of large hypolimnetic- releasing impoundments in the murray–darling basin (lugg & copeland, 2014) and worldwide (olden & naiman, 2010; preece & jones, 2002; stevens, shannon, & blinn, 1997). these differences reflect impoundment characteristics and operation as well as the position in the landscape (ward & stanford, 1983). in the case of hume dam, the impoundment has a relatively short retention time, a large exposed surface area that encourages wind mixing, and is usu- ally drawn down over summer months, lessening thermal stratification (sherman, 2005), which ensures that warmer surface water is more often discharged from the impoundment. furthermore, the influence of tributaries (kiewa and ovens rivers), which at times contribute sub- stantial flows to the river murray below hume dam, on mitigating the downstream impacts of the impoundment warrants further investiga- tion (sherman, 2005). the extreme drought that impacted much of the southern murray– darling basin over 1997–2009 (van dijk et al., 2013) led to the volume and discharge of the impoundment being comparatively low over the study period (2002–2007). during periods with greater impoundment volume and discharge, it is anticipated that temperature (suppressed) and flow velocity (increased) will be more severely impacted directly downstream and a more persistent disturbance gradient created (lugg figure 7 modelled weight trajectories for murray cod (maccullochella peelii) under the flow velocity and temperature regimes at nine sites along a 1,050 km section of the river murray in relation to the location of hume dam ( ) presumably for analagous systems worldwide. furthermore, mitigat- ing thermal pollution alone may not redress these impacts as flow alteration has potentially greater influence on the bioenergetics of these fish species. the adverse bioenergetic responses of the species directly down- stream of the impoundment are consistent with the predictions of re- duced abundance and spawning success (sherman et al., 2007; thoms et al., 2000). pegg and pierce (2001) similarly showed that native fish, including channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus), emerald shiner (notropis atherinoides) and freshwater drum (aplodinotus grunniens), were largely absent or had low growth rates, downstream of impoundments of the missouri river, usa. our model predicted that juvenile murray cod were gradually released from these bioenergetic constraints as flow velocity declined and temperature increased along the disturbance gradient. further downstream (+239 to +771 km) along the river murray, simulations indicated that the river is physically more suitable, with lower summer flow velocities and increasing temperature allow- ing increased growth to occur. whiterod et al.& copeland, 2014; sherman et al., 2007). under these conditions, bioenergetics responses of juvenile murray cod are anticipated to be more adverse, so the outcomes of the present paper represent the lower end of the bioenergetics impact imposed by the impoundment. the differential growth responses along the disturbance gradient indicate that the principles of the sdc of ward and stanford (1983) likely extend to the bioenergetics of fish species. it also supports hall et al.’s (1992) hypothesis that intimates that the bioenergetics of individuals may help explain the responses of fish populations and communities to environmental gradients, such as those im- posed by impoundments. importantly, the present study places fur- ther emphasis on the importance of considering both flow velocity and temperature when exploring the impact of river regulation and implementing environmental flows (bevelheimer, 2002; olden & naiman, 2010; wildhaber et al., 2015). in fact, flow velocity regimes may influence bioenergetic responses to a greater extent compared to temperature regimes below hypolimnetically releasing impound- ments (whiterod et al., 2013), although specific partitioning of the relative contribution of each parameter is required. clearly, it would be important to verify the findings of the present study with targeted field sampling of the murray cod populations below the impoundment. it would, for instance, be useful to incorporate field estimates of the abundance of the species, food consumption, prey availability and growth (possibly through mark–recapture studies) and activity (brodie et al., 2016; cooke et al., 2016). yet, fish are often absent, or in low abundance, below impoundments (as pre- dicted by modelling simulations), making this type of field validation of the model ineffective. the model was limited to juvenile murray cod, but it is acknowl- edged that bioenergetic responses will likely differ across life stages given the strong influence of body weight on metabolism and flow velocity thresholds (whiterod, 2013; whiterod et al., 2013) and con- sumption via increasing gape size and dietary shifts (ebner, 2006; king, 2005). for instance, murray cod larvae consume smaller food resources (king, 2005) have poorer absolute swimming performance (kopf, humphries, & watts, 2014) and higher weight- specific rates of the bioenergetics components than larger individuals. in turn, there are bioenergetic consequences of the reduced spawning output (sherman et al., 2007), lower burst swimming abilities and smaller body sizes (ryan et al., 2003), which are anticipated in regimes pre- vailing below hume dam. in contrast, mature adults make annual spawning (energy) allocations (humphries, 2005) and potential long upstream movements (koehn et al., 2009), but ingest large energy rich food resources (ebner, 2006) and are expected to have greater absolute swimming performance and lower weight- specific energetic demands (ma and ms) than juveniles (whiterod, 2013). additionally, murray cod is a popular angling species regulated by a harvestable slot length limit (hsll, 550–750 mm); differential bioenergetic responses will influence how long it takes individuals to growth through the hsll, thus exposing them to differing degrees of stress and mortality (koehn & todd, 2012). dynamic energy budget model- ling incorporating separate, but linked, life- stage bioenergetics mod- els (leloutre, péry, porcher, & beaudouin, 2016), but also expanding     |  695 to include relationships with temperature and flow velocity for re- production and spawning, predation and competition and behaviour (hartman & kitchell, 2008; kooijman, 2010), would be very valuable for the future management of the species. other factors undoubtedly influence the bioenergetics of juve- nile murray cod along the section of river murray investigated. for instance, changes in the flow velocity and temperature regime may alter the abundance of food resources, including macroinvertebrates and small- bodied fish (phillips & johnston, 2004; voelz & ward, 1991). in particular, bennison, hillman, and suter (1989) showed that there was a markedly lower abundance and diversity of mac- roinvertebrates in the river murray directly downstream of hume dam than at sites further downstream. this suggests that increas- ing food availability (and p- value) may further enhance the growth responses of murray cod with distance downstream. in the present study, however, food availability (in terms of p) was assumed to be constant amongst the sites, as there was no detailed information on the food resources and dietary composition of juvenile murray cod along the study section. food resources are anticipated to be enhanced in association with woody structure, which has been shown to be important habitat for juvenile and adult murray cod (jones & stuart, 2007; koehn, 2009a). this habitat may also provide flow velocity refuge and reduce predation risk (crook & robertson, 1999), which act to reduce metabolic costs and increase growth in murray cod as it has in other species (finstad, einum, forseth, & ugedal, 2007; hafs, harrison, utz, & dunne, 2014). yet, the removal of 24,500 woody structures in the river murray along the study region (cf. thoms et al., 2000) will alter the density of woody structure, thus influencing bioenergetic responses of juvenile murray cod. yet, before modelling can reflect this habitat association, it is nec- essary to explore the bioenergetics of murray cod when associated with woody structure and quantify the density of woody structure along the river. 5 | conclusions hume dam imposes a considerable impact on the flow velocity and temperature regime of the river downstream. modelling simulations, using the bioenergetics model developed in this paper, revealed differential growth responses of juvenile murray cod under these changing regimes. it was predicted that growth of the species was not possible directly downstream of the impoundment, due largely to the energetic costs associated with surviving in the cooler and faster flowing water. as flow velocity and temperature regimes im- proved downstream along the river, so did the growth of juvenile murray cod. at a distances of 239 km or greater downstream from the impoundment, flow velocities are sufficiently low and tempera- ture sufficiently high to allow greater final weights to be achieved during modelling simulations. the findings of this study provide insight into the detrimental bioenergetics consequences of large hypolimnetic- releasing impoundments for warm- water freshwater fish worldwide. whiterod et al.696  |     acknowledgements this study formed part of a phd funded by the mallee catchment management authority (mallee cma), with support from the murray–
