resource management, norwegian university of life sciences, a˚ s, norway abstract – the effect of selective harvest of large pike on number of middle-sized pike was tested in a small, eutrophic lake in se norway. the pike population was estimated using a mark–recapture method in two different periods: before (1980–1983) and during the manipulation of the pike population (2004–2006). after an extensive size selective harvest of large pike (‡65 cm) in 2004, the number of pike in length-class 45–65 cm, mainly 3+ pike, increased signiﬁcantly from 2004 to 2005. the number in this length-class was even higher in 2006. since 2+ pike was part of the diet of large pike, the increase in number of 3+ pike in 2005 and 2006 is probably due to reduced consumption of 2+ pike, following the substantial selective removal of large pike in 2004 and 2005. to maintain a high annual survival of young pike, a selective exploitation of large pike has to be carried out annually. key words: pike; cannibalism; selective harvest; population density r. borgstrøm, department of ecology and natural resource management, norwegian university of life sciences, p.o. box 5003, no-1432 a˚ s, norway; email: reidar.borgstrom@umb.no accepted for publication april 8, 2008 introduction although physical factors are important in regulating recruitment and abundance in ﬁsh populations (hass- ler 1970; kipling 1984; craig 1996; margenau et al. 1998), a large proportion of the production in young age classes and small ﬁsh may be consumed by piscivorous ﬁsh (popova 1978; tonn et al. 1992; craig 1996; paukert & willis 2003; svenning & borgstrøm 2005). correspondingly, cannibalism in some species is proposed to play a major role in controlling ﬁsh population structure in lakes (le cren 1965; kipling 1984; svenning & borgstrøm 1995). some piscivores, for example pike esox lucius, may consume a large number of young ﬁsh of its own (le cren 1965; kipling 1983; giles et al. 1986; bry et al. 1992; craig 1996; grønkjær et al. 2004). extensive exploitation of large pike may therefore result in increased year-class strength of young pike because of reduced cannibalism, as demonstrated when large pike are either reduced by high ﬁshing mortality (mosindy et al. 1987) or by high natural mortality (raat 1988; casselman & harvey 1975). as part of a biomanipulation project of a small eutrophic lake in se norway, the present study tested the effect on population structure and year-class strength of pike after heavy size selective harvest of large pike, within a relatively simple ﬁsh community. since large-sized pike in this lake consumed small pike (sharma & borgstrøm 2008), a selective harvest of large pike is expected to reduce mortality of young pike, resulting in increased number of middle-sized pike. materials and methods study area the 1.2 km2 lake a˚ rungen is situated 33 m above sea level in akershus county, norway. the lake has a length of about 3 km, with a maximum depth of 13.2 m and an average depth of 8.1 m (eie & borgstrøm 1981). the 52 km2 catchment area is dominated by agriculture and forests (39.8%) (eie & borgstrøm 1981). the lake is eutrophic with blooms of bluegreen algae every summer, and together with high load of clay from the inlet streams, the lake transparency has usually been below 1–2 m during the summer. in addition to pike, the recorded ﬁsh species in the lake are perch perca (51.5%) 590 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00310.x selective harvest of large pike increased the population density ﬂuviatilis, roach rutilus rutilus, crucian carp caras- sius carassius, tench tinca tinca, rudd scardinius erythrophthalmus, and eel anguilla anguilla. from the 2 km long outlet stream which enters the oslo fjord, a few sea_trout salmo_trutta and atlantic salmon salmo_salar ascend the lake during high discharge in the autumn. pike has a fast growth rate in lake a˚ rungen (fig. 1), probably due to the high density of prey ﬁsh, predom- inantly roach. no catch statistics of pike harvest exist from the period before 2004, but according to the length frequency of pike captured by one ﬁsherman in april– may 1980–1985 (n = 614), 71.5% of the catch consisted of pike with total length <65 cm (fig. 2). especially in 1991, but also in 1992–1993, commercial ﬁshermen harvested large pike by gill netting in lake a˚ rungen. in 1994, year-class 1991 and 1992 constituted about 70% of the gill net catches (brabrand 2000). however, no population estimates from this period exists. recreational ﬁshing in lake a˚ rungen is open for everybody, without any license. based on the number of observed sport ﬁshermen during may–june 2004–2006, with up to 40 ﬁshing simultaneously, the angling exploitation seems to be high. population estimates and selective harvest simple petersen mark–recapture experiments were carried out to estimate the number of pike in the lake (ricker 1975). pike were marked at the base of the dorsal ﬁn by numbered floy anchor tags during the spawning period from the ice break-up in april to the ﬁrst week of may. if a tag is lost, it is expected to produce a small wound in the pike skin which should have been discovered on captured ﬁsh, at least in the ﬁrst months after the tagging. since such wounds were not observed, except tag losses are considered as negligible. capture of pike for tagging was done by in one case, fig. 2. length frequency distribution (%) of pike captured in lake a˚ rungen by fyke nets during 1980-85 (upper) and by gillnets in 2004 (lower). setting gill nets with mesh sizes from 45 to 58 mm (from knot to knot) just outside the vegetation belt, along the whole lake shore. as soon as the nets were set, pike in the vegetation zone were frightened by rowing and splashing with the oars for a few minutes before the nets were lifted. captured pike were cut loose and stored in a water tank before they were measured and tagged. the tagging period was ended when recaptured pike from the same tagging season frequently appeared in the catches. after the marking period in the years, 2004– 2006, an extensive size selective harvest of large pike (‡65 cm) was carried out from the middle of may to the beginning of june, by gill nets with mesh sizes 45– 58 mm (from knot to knot), but with largest effort with mesh-sizes 52–58 mm. during this exploitation, ﬂeets of gillnets were set along the whole lake shore, outside the vegetation zone, both parallel to the shore and more or less straight outwards. in addition to the pike captured by this extensive ﬁshing, pike captured both in littoral and pelagic areas during the rest of the year, were included in the population estimation. age determina- tion and back-calculation of pike length to length at tagging (start of the growth season in year of tagging) by use of the metapterygoid bone were done as described by sharma & borgstrøm (2007). recruits to the estimated length-class (i. e. >45 cm) were thus avoided, by substracting all pike that had been smaller than 45 cm at time of tagging. chapman’s modiﬁed petersen formula was used to estimate the number of pike (ricker 1975), according to the formula:  ð1þ ^n ¼ m þ 1 ð  þ þ c þ 1 ð r þ 1 fig. 1. mean length (±sd) at age for male and female pike captured in lake a˚ rungen 2003-2006. where ^n is the population estimate, m the number of marked pike in population, c the number of individuals 591 sharma & borgstrøm frequency (ricker distribution captured for control and r the number of recaptures. conﬁdence limits (0.95) were approximated from the poisson 1975). estimation by mark–recapture is justiﬁed if a number of conditions are met, amongst which that the mortality of tagged and untagged ﬁsh is the same, tags are not lost, tagged ﬁsh are randomly mixed with untagged, and that there is a negligible recruitment to the estimated portion of the population (ricker 1975). the chosen methods for capture, tagging and the subsequent sampling for examination of tagged ﬁsh in the present study may fulﬁl these conditions. the effort put into both tagging and recapturing of tagged pike varied between years, giving variations in number of recaptures, and thus variations in conﬁdence of the estimates. the estimated number of pike within each length-class (45–64.9 and ‡65 cm) was partitioned to each centimetre-class according to the number captured during the tagging. these numbers were used to calculate the total number of pike in each age-class, by apportioning the numbers to age-classes according to the frequency of each age- class within the centimetre-classes. the population estimations were conducted during two periods: before (1980–1983) and during the selective harvest (experi- mental manipulation) of large pike in may 2004–2006. during the ﬁrst period (1980–1983), the pike population was exploited mainly by recreational ﬁshing. back calculation and annual mortality back calculation of length at the start of the growing season (i.e. at time of tagging in april–may) was carried out for all captured pike that had a growth zone outside the last winter zone, according to the method described by sharma & borgstrøm (2007). the annual survival rates (s) of pike between april and may in year 1 and april–may in year 2 were estimated for the years 2004–2005 and 2005–2006, by using ricker’s method (ricker 1975): s1 ¼ r12m2 m1r22 ð2þ where s1 is the survival rate during year 1; m1 the number ﬁsh tagged at the start of the ﬁrst year (april – ﬁrst week of may); m2 the number of ﬁsh tagged at the start of the second year (april – ﬁrst week of may); r12 the recaptures of ﬁrst-year marks in the second- year (from middle of may); and r22 is the recaptures of second-year marks in the second-year (from middle of may). the annual mortality rate, a, was calculated as a = 1 ) s (ricker 1975). the exploitation rate caused by the project’s harvest was calculated as u = c ⁄ n, where c is the number of captured pike and n the estimated number just before the exploitation started. 592 diet analyses in random samples of captured pike, the stomach and oesophagus were opened shortly after the landings. the contents were then identiﬁed to species, weighted and length of the prey ﬁsh measured when possible. the number of pike dissected for the diet analysis were 33 in 2004 (may), 119 in 2005 (may–june and august–december), and 51 in 2006 (may). statistical analyses statistical analyses were done with the help of sigmastat 3.0.1 statistical software. the annual differences in size-class structures were analysed by kruskal–wallis test. all pairwise comparisons were performed with dune’s method because of unequal sample sizes (zar 1996). results population size and length structure as a result of the experimental removal of 304 pike ‡65 cm, in addition to the captured pike by the ordinary ﬁshing in 2004, the number of large pike (‡65 cm) decreased signiﬁcantly from 485 in 2004 to 121 in 2005 (h = 19.535, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001; tables 1 and 2). despite the experimental removal of 66 pike ‡65 cm, the number of pike in this length-class showed a small increase from 2005 to 2006 (table 2; fig. 3). the total estimated number of pike >45 cm increased from 1119 in 2004 to 1623 and 1850 in 2005 and 2006, respectively (table 2; fig. 3). in the same period, the number of pike in length-class 45.0–64.9 cm showed a signiﬁcant increase from 2004 (n = 634) to 2005 (n = 1502) (h = 17.112, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001), with a further increase in 2006 (n = 1590) (table 2; fig. 3). there was not much difference in the estimated number of pike in 2004, i.e. before the selective harvest started, compared to the estimates in 1980s (table 2). table 1. number of pike removed and their biomass in

indicate age 3+ pike. note that size selective harvest of large pike started from the middle of may in each of the years 2004-2006. in length-class 45–64.9 cm, 3+ pike dominated (fig. 3), and this age-class was particularly large in the years 1981 (n = 830), 2005 (n = 722) and 2006 (n = 688), comprising 63%, 45% and 37% of the total estimated population, respectively (fig. 3). although the number of pike ‡45 cm increased in 2005–2006, 593 sharma & borgstrøm the total annual biomass was nearly the same as in the previous years (table 2), mainly due to the dominance of young pike (age-class 3+) in 2005 and 2006, and as a consequence, a decrease in the average weight of pike (table 2). mortality rates the removal of 304 pike in length-class ‡65 cm by the experimental ﬁshing in 2004, corresponds to an exploitation rate of u = 0.63 (table 2). the number of pike ‡65 cm captured during the experimental ﬁshing in 2005 and 2006 correspond to the exploita- tion rates u = 0.55 and 0.64, respectively. the exploitation of pike in length-class 45.0–64.9 cm by the experimental ﬁshing was much lower (table 2), giving exploitation rates for all pike ‡45 cm to be u = 0.48, from may 2004 to april 2005 and u = 0.19, from may 2005 to april 2006, respectively. the total annual mortality rates of pike (‡45 cm) from 2004 to 2005, and from 2005 to 2006, caused by all mortality factors, were 0.86 and 0.56, respectively (table 3), i.e., much higher mortality rates than caused by the experimental ﬁshing alone. the annual mortality rates due to the project’s removal of pike during the years 1980–1983 were low, and ranged from 0.07 in 1983 to 0.19 in 1981 (table 2). by the experimental ﬁshing during the years 2004–2006, the total number of captured pike ‡65 cm had a mass of 1449 kg (table 1), contributing to about 65% of the total pike biomass harvested (2237 kg) by this ﬁshing (table 1). pike diet pike in lake a˚ rungen were exclusively piscivorous in nature, feeding mainly on roach and perch. pike were found as prey ﬁsh in pike >65 cm (fig. 4). in 2004 and 2006, 2+ pike with length around 30–35 cm formed 23% and 15% of the diet of pike ‡65 cm in terms of weight (fig. 4). discussion since the same estimation procedure was followed in all years, increase in the estimated number of pike ‡45 cm in 2005 and 2006 compared to the signiﬁcant table 3. annual mortality rates of

prey ﬁsh in the stomach contents of pike > 65 cm captured in lake a˚ rungen during 2004-06. the previous years may reﬂect a substantial increase in the actual population numbers. according to hei- kinheimo & korhonen (1996), the annual speciﬁc food consumption for 3–6 years old pike in two lakes in northeastern finland was 3-4 times their own weight, based on a bioenergetics model. the removed pike from lake a˚ rungen in may 2004 had a body mass at )1 as an estimate for the 928 kg, and by using 3 gæg annual speciﬁc food consumption of large pike in this lake, the total annual consumption of these pike would have been nearly 3000 kg, even without taking into account any annual increase in body weight of these pike. with about 20% of the diet composed of 2+ pike in the range 30–35 cm, with a mean weight at 200 g, this would have produced a consumption correspond- ing to 3000 2+ pike. even a reduction to only 5% pike in pike diet would still represent more than 700 consumed 2+ pike. the removal of large pike in the lake caused by the selective harvest, may therefore explain the signiﬁcant increase in number of pike in length-class 45.0–64.9 cm from around 600 in may 2004 to more than 1500 in may 2005 and 2006. the number of young pike thus seems to be controlled by cannibalism, as also supported by previous studies (e.g. le cren 1965; persson et al. 2006). actually, depending on the age and length composition of a ﬁsh population, even a very low rate of cannibalism can have a signiﬁcant effect upon mortality of young individuals (le cren 1965; fox 1975). according to røkholt (pers. comm.), a mass mortality of pike, perch and roach was observed in lake a˚ rungen at least one spring in the mid-1970s, during ice break-up, probably due to oxygen depletion. therefore, the relatively high number of 3+ pike in 1981 may also have been a result of reduced cannibalism after a high natural mortality of large pike in the seventies. since the pike in lake a˚ rungen has a fast annual growth rate, a strong age-class of 2+ pike may in a few years give rise to a high number of large, cannibalistic selective harvest of large pike increased the population density pike, creating ﬂuctuations rates and population numbers. to avoid this development, and keep a more stable high survival of 2+ pike, a selective harvest of large pike has to be maintained annually. in survival generally, spatial avoidance of predators is common and also affects the growth rate of the prey (e. g. werner et al. 1983; relyea & werner 1999). the change in habitat use by small roach in the lake gjersjøen, nearby lake a˚ rungen, from predominantly using the pelagic area to use the littoral area after establishment of a pikeperch (stizostedium lucioperca) population is a typical response of a prey to increased predatory risk in open water (brabrand & faafeng 1993). the ﬂexibility in habitat use is probably a common behavioural trait in all potential prey ﬁsh, and pike may distribute spatially in a size-determined fashion also to avoid intraspeciﬁc risks (nilsson 2006). a study in the outlet of river kajaaninjoki to lake sokaja¨rvi in finland indicated that large pike had a higher movement rate than small pike (vehanen et al. 2006). such a difference in swimming activity may be due to the fact that small- and moderate- sized pike are restricted to vegetated areas in shallow waters (grimm 1981), probably to avoid predation from larger pike, although pike may utilise the habitat in an ideal free manner (haugen et al. 2006). a three to ﬁve times higher cpue of pike in the pelagic and littoral habitats in lake a˚ rungen in summer 2005–2006 compared with 1978–1980 (sharma and borgstrøm 2008), despite simply a doubling of the estimated population number, indicates a much higher swimming activity and a more free ranging behaviour of small pike in june 2005 and 2006, in nearly absence of large pike. recreational angling can act as an effective mortal- ity factor (johnson & martinez 1995), and angling can contribute to a large proportion of the pike harvest from a lake (pierce et al. 1995; pierce & cook 2000). although the exploitation rate of pike in lake a˚ rungen due to the selective harvest decreased from 2004 to 2006, the mortality due to other reasons was still high (37%). since angling activities in lake a˚ rungen seem to have increased in recent years compared with the 1980s and 1990s, the additional mortality is probably due mainly to the recreational ﬁshery. by introducing a minimum size of captured pike, a further increase in survival and recruitment of small pike are expected, resulting in a higher total population number of pike. however, due to density- dependent growth, a further substantial increase in population density may reduce annual growth rates of pike, as observed in pike populations in minnesota and wisconsin lakes (pierce & tomcko 2003), and thus contribute to suppress cannibalism in the popu- lation. in conclusion, selective harvest of large pike in lake a˚ rungen may have led to increased survival of small pike (mainly 2+ pike), giving a signiﬁcantly higher number of pike in length-class 45.0–64.9 cm (mainly 3+ pike), despite a very high annual ﬁshing mortality. the high mortality rate of pike due to recreational ﬁshing may have reduced the potential increase in population number since the recreational ﬁshing probably is much less selective than a ﬁshery using gill nets with large mesh sizes. therefore, a full effect of a selective harvest of pike may not be obtained as long as no restrictions are set on the ordinary ﬁshing activity. acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge jon arne eie, roar lundby, john gunnar dokk, anders yri, anil shrestha and morten aas for their help
