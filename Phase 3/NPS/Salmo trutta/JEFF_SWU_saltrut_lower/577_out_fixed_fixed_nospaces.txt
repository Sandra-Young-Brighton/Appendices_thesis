(1982), best release windows may exist that provide the most favourable survival conditions for the stocked ﬁsh, such as proper prey and the absence of predators. the timing of stocking to coincide with these release windows is crucial stocking temporally matched to a vulnerability period of optimum prey species enabled a favourable start in growth for newly stocked pike-perch, stizostedion lucioperca (l.) (sutela & hyva¨rinen 2002). jepsen et al. (2000) suggested that the overlap between the pike, esox lucius l., spawning period and sea-run brown_trout (bt), salmo_trutta l., smolt run may prevent pike from preying on bt, because at that time pike are in their spawning areas and not moving in the bt migration routes. the effect of stocking time on success can also be dependent on the circumstances in the release area. pirhonen et al. (2003) found that the mean yield of sea-run bt was higher when released in spring (april to may) than when released in summer (june to july), whereas the yield of lake-run bt was higher from stocking in summer than from stocking in spring, indicating wide differences between sea and lake as stocking environments. the success of stocked ﬁsh may be dependent on the abundance of available prey at release, together with a suitable size ratio between prey and stocked ﬁsh, allowing for successful foraging (olson 1996). the size of the stocked ﬁsh determines how large a prey item they can ingest and similarly the size ratio between predators and released ﬁsh affects the vulnerability of the latter for predators. the larger doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00104.x 303 hyva¨rinen & huusko the released ﬁsh, the better the refuge from predation (hyva¨rinen & vehanen 2004) and the faster the growth, the sooner the refuge is obtained (hart & connelan 1984; hambright et al. 1991; nilsson & bro¨nmark 2000). inlets to compensate for habitat in finland bt have been stocked widely to lakes and river losses because of damming of rivers and the yield of bt is based mainly on recapture of released (age-2 and -3 years) hatchery-reared ﬁsh. vehanen (1995) indica- ted large interlake (34 finnish lakes) variation in stocking success of bt and considered stocking rate, ﬁsh community, and ﬁshing effort as the main inﬂuencing factors. bt yield was high in those lakes with high yields of vendace, coregonus_albula (l.), which is the principal prey ﬁsh for the piscivorous bt in many lakes in finland (e.g. vehanen et al. 1998; niva 1999), and low yields of northern pike, the main predator on stocked trout (vehanen 1995). in addition to pike, burbot lota lota (l.) and pike-perch have proved to be important predators of migrating salmo- nid smolts in scandinavian areas (larsson 1985; jepsen et al. 1998). the purpose here was to examine how the explan- atory factors found in previous relatively short-term studies could explain the long-term (27 years) year-to- year variation in bt stocking success in lake ouluja¨rvi, in central finland. the explanatory factors included in the analysis were abundance of main prey (e) (f) (g) (h) (a) (b) (c) (d) 304 and predator populations, stocking-rate, -size and - season. material and methods study area lake ouluja¨rvi (27°10¢e, 64°20¢n) is one of the largest lakes in finland with a surface area of 928 km2. its mean depth is 7.6 m, the maximum is 36 m, and the mean annual variation in water level is 1.9 m. lake ouluja¨rvi has been regulated for hydro- power since 1951, when the largest rivers ﬂowing both into and out the lake were dammed for hydropower generation, after which the natural reproduction of lake-run bt collapsed. to compen- sate for habitat losses, smolt-sized (2–3 years old) hatchery-reared bt have annually been stocked in the lake since 1966, except for 1977 when there were problems in hatchery production (fig. 1b–c). the main prey ﬁsh species for bt in the lake is vendace (vehanen et al. 1998) and the most abundant and probable predator species is northern pike, but burbot and pike-perch also may prey on young bt (larsson 1985; jepsen et al. 1998). other abundant ﬁsh species also present in the pelagic areas of the lake are whiteﬁsh coregonus smelt osmerus eperlanus (l.), perch perca ﬂuviatilis l. and roach rutilus rutilus (l). lavaretus (l.), fig. 1. time series used in the regression analysis.

(>25 cm) the ﬁve independent variables used to search for interannual variation in bt stocking success were: 1 stocking rate (number of bt released per hectare, fig. 1c) 2 mean bt weight at release (annual mean weight of bt at release, fig. 1d) 3 biomass of adult vendace (age 1–4, vendace population at release time on 1 may for period 1 and on 1 september for period 2, fig. 1e and 1f) 4 biomass

species during the winter previous to stocking, fig. 1h). relationships, thus no transformations were needed in the analyses. stocking rate and mean bt weight at release were taken from stocking statistics collected by the employ- ment and economic development center for kainuu, kajaani, finland. the biomass of vendace stock and vendace 0+ recruits was based on the virtual popula- tion analysis of the lake ouluja¨rvi vendace population presented by huusko & hyva¨rinen (2005). natural mortality rate m ¼ 0.3 years )1 was used for all ages and years. the predator-cpue was calculated from the combined yield of pike, burbot and pike-perch divided by the number of gillnets (mesh size 45–65 mm) lifted. data were based on records main- tained by a mean of 13 ﬁshermen who lifted a mean of 1498 gillnets per year. the data on predator-cpue i were based on recorded data in stocking year collected in january in year i and in december in year i)1. the different sampling period compared with that for bt was because of different ﬁshing season between species. the midwinter period is an important ﬁshing season for pike, burbot and pike- perch, whereas bt is captured mainly between august and december. results during the study period the bt cpue (table 1) and bt stocking success (fig. 1a) varied considerably. the time period between maximum values was from 8 to 9 years, greatly resembling vendace stock oscillation (fig. 1a, e, f and g). all three regression models (table 2) were highly signiﬁcant. the models ﬁtted for periods 1, 2 and the entire time series accounted for 82%, 89% and 80% of the variation in bt stocking success respectively (table 2). the variables entering the model differed considerably between periods 1 and 2. for all analyses, examination of the

and abundance of predators on bt together with the mean size of bt at release accounted for most of the interannual variation in bt stocking success in lake ouluja¨rvi over the last three decades. however, the importance of these factors varied widely between the periods studied, separated by stocking season and indicating a strong inﬂuence of timing of release on the mechanisms affecting stocking success. for stocking carried out in the spring the biomass of the adult vendace population was import- ant as was the mean bt weight at stocking, whereas in the summer the biomass of the vendace population as a whole affected mostly the stocking success, with the 0+ vendace recruits playing a major role. in general all the results lend support to the ﬁndings of previous studies from lake ouluja¨rvi by vehanen et al. (1998) and from a few small lakes by niva (1999), who showed that vendace are an important component in the diet of stocked bt. the mean weight of bt at release was important for stocking success when the ﬁsh were released in the spring, but not if the ﬁsh were released in the summer. the dependence of stocking success on the size of stocked ﬁsh between these two seasons may have been coupled with the availability of suitably sized prey. both in the spring and autumn the size of the main potential prey in lake ouluja¨rvi, 1 to 4-year-old vendace (adult vendace population), was large, about 10 cm or more in length almost throughout the study period (saloja¨rvi 1991; vehanen et al. 1998), thus clearly occupying the upper range of edible prey for 2 to 3-year-old stocked bt (niva & julkunen 1998). obviously, only the largest bt individuals in the spring release groups were able to take advantage of relatively large-sized prey, while most of the stocked bt probably made use of secondary prey such as lowering their survival potential and leading to size-at-release dependence on stocking success (e.g. skurdal et al. 1989; hesthagen & johnsen 1992; hyva¨rinen & vehanen 2003). bt success was highest during the years of abundant vendace population. the growth rate and condition of vendace show high density dependence (auvinen 1994; salmi & huusko 1995). thus individuals of abundant vendace year-classes are probably more vulnerable to predation by stocked bt than those of sparse year-classes, thus enhancing stocking success. insects, long-term variation in brown_trout stocking success stocking in period 2 matches well the time period during which the 0+ vendace occupy the pelagic area of the lake and form a large, suitably sized mass of prey for newly stocked bt (karjalainen et al. 2002). the mean length of 0+ vendace at this time is about 3–5 cm and their abundance is strongly and positively correlated with their autumnal abundance (viljanen 1988; karjalainen et al. 2000), which we used as an index of prey availability for stocked bt in our analysis. most of the newly stocked bt released in period 2 (in the summer) were probably large enough to consume 0+ vendace. for example bt released in 1996 were smallest within period 2 but still were most successful, clearly enabled by the highest biomass of 0+ vendace of the entire data series. in previous studies, relative vulnerability to predation has been size-related between predator and prey (hambright et al. 1991; nilsson & bro¨nmark 2000; hyva¨rinen & vehanen 2004). we suggest that when available prey animals for stocked bt were small (0+ vendace in july) and abundant at release time, all sizes of released bt gained a similarly favourable start for growth, which ensured good stocking success by way of low natural mortality (o’gorman et al. 1987; olson 1996). in fact, bt stocked in the spring (period 1) clearly had to wait for 2–6 weeks before 0+ vendace were present in their foraging area, and during this time they had to consume secondary prey (large-sized adult vendace, other ﬁsh species, or insects). the results here suggest that the success of trout stocked in the spring had already been determined by other factors before 0+ vendace entered the foraging area of bt. niva (1999) found that bt grow well and increase their lipids if they forage on small-sized vendace, whereas insectivorous trout showed poor growth and low lipid levels. we conclude that if bt released in the spring lacked suitably sized prey during the ﬁrst weeks after release (shortage of properly sized vendace) causing a poor start in growth, even improving food resources 1 month later in the summer by the recruit- ment of a new year-class of 0+ vendace could not rescue the stocking result for that year. the success of a cohort of stocked bt appears to be dependent essentially on the abundance of available prey at release, together with a suitable size ratio between prey and stocked ﬁsh, allowing for successful foraging (see also olson 1996). predator-cpue the increasing trend in predator-cpue within the entire time series indicated an increasing probability for stocked bt to undergo predation. this was supported by the results from regression analysis for the successive periods studied: within period 1 there was no clear increase in predator-cpue and there was 307 hyva¨rinen & huusko no signiﬁcant effect of predation; but within period 2 there was a clear increase in predator-cpue and a negative effect of predation. heavy predation by pike and pike-perch on migrating salmonid smolts has been observed previously in rivers and reservoirs (jepsen et al. 1998, 2000), and by pike and burbot in sea areas close to the river inlet (larsson 1985). increase in predator-cpue was considerable at the end of period 2 and, because the 1998 bt stocking success remained low regardless of the relatively strong vendace pop- ulation at release time, suggesting an increased effect of predation in the last few years. stocking rate vehanen (1995) found that high stocking rate neg- atively affected the relative yield of bt (kilograms per 1000 ﬁsh stocked) in northern finland (data from 34 lakes). in some naturally reproducing bt popu- lations, density-dependent regulation has also been very strong (elliott 1993; elliott & hurley 1998; langeland & pedersen 2000). in contrast, we found no signiﬁcant effect of stocking rate (range 0.21–0.91 released ﬁsh per hectare) on bt stocking success within each of the periods studied. vehanen (1995) found that the variation in stocking success was highest when stocking rate was under one ﬁsh per hectare, including the highest and lowest values of these data. when 1–5 ﬁsh per hectare were released, high yields per 1000 ﬁsh released were lacking (vehanen 1995). the increasing variation in relative yield with decreasing stocking rate indicated that factors other than stocking rate determined the largest part of low stocking rates (see vehanen 1995). we suggest that this was also the case in lake ouluja¨rvi, where the stocking rate was less than one ﬁsh per hectare within the entire period studied, and thus stocking rate played no signiﬁcant role in the regulation of stocking success. the variation in stocking success at management implications the available evidence supported a major link between the abundance of suitably sized prey at the time of stocking and subsequent bt abundance. as a good management strategy to increase bt stocks in northern lakes, we suggest that small-sized bt be stocked only in lakes where small-sized prey ﬁsh stocks are present also. if vendace are present in the ﬁsh community, release window (bilton et al. 1982) for successful bt stocking appears to be that time period when 0+ vendace has occupied the pelagic areas of the lake. this usually occurs, when surface water temperature has increased to 15 °c in late june to early july, depending on the latitude and the best 308 limit year (auvinen 1994; huusko 1998; karjalainen et al. 2002). based on our data bt as small as 150–200 g could succeed, although the lowest for a successful stocking size was not found here. how- ever, if the vendace year-class in a stocking year is expected to be weak but the adult vendace population is strong, we recommend that bt be released in the spring from mid-may to early june. trout released in the spring should be clearly larger, weighing over 200 g, because the large size widens the size-range of suitable prey (hambright et al. 1991). the small size of adult vendace would improve the likelihood of stocked bt being successful when released in the spring. low bt stocking success has occurred in lake ouluja¨rvi since 1998 regardless of the relatively high biomass of adult vendace, in addition to the strong vendace year-classes in 1998 and 2000, indicating that factors other than abundance of appropriate prey at release had a major effect on bt stocking success. our regression analysis suggests that high predation on newly stocked bt may have prevented their success. this also suggests that it would be useless to release bt if the abundance of predators will increase or remain at relatively high levels (vehanen 1995). in lake ouluja¨rvi, however, the period during which levels of predator-cpue have been high was short (1998–2001), and therefore caution should be exercised before any ﬁrm conclusions on these results can yet be drawn. to clarify the effects of each predator species, further detailed studies are needed. the effect of mean bt weight at release on avoidance of predation remained an open question in this study. however, results from the kajaaninjoki river (ﬂowing into lake ouluja¨rvi) indicated that in the area with high density of pike 35 cm length (400 g) at release gave good refuge for bt from pike predation (hyva¨rinen & vehanen 2004). the recent the clear difference found here in the structures of the multivariate regression models between the two consecutive study periods demonstrated the risks of short-term time series and their analysis. the model developed for the ﬁrst 17 years (period 1) could not predict at all the values observed in the second 10-year period when stocking was later. correspondingly, the the last 10 years also had poor model ﬁtted for predictability for the values observed in the ﬁrst period. we concluded that the timing of stocking had the major role in determining the best release window for lake-run bt. our analysis also showed that the regression models as used here may run a high risk of failing in predicting complex and ﬂuctuating interac- tions in the ﬁsh community if relatively short-term data are used and the affecting mechanisms are poorly known. resumen 1. dado lo impredecible que son los resultados de las repoblaciones, se hace necesario conocer los mecanismos que afectan el e´xito de los peces soltados para minimizar los riesgos de error en altas inversiones de repoblaciones. podrı´a existir una ventana o´ ptima para las sueltas que produzca las condi- ciones ma´s favorables - tales como la ausencia de predadores en la zona de suelta y la disponibilidad de presas apropiadas - bajo las que cualquier pez soltado pueda sobrevivir y generar una produccio´ n ma´xima. el ﬁn de este estudio fue examinar como factores tales como la abundancia de las poblaciones de presas y predadores, y las tasas, taman˜os y estaciones de repoblacio´n pueden explicar las variaciones anuales a largo plazo (an˜os 1974–1991) en el e´xito de repoblacio´n de salmo_trutta l. en el lago ouluja¨rvi (928 km2, finlandia central). trutta fueron repoblados en primavera 2. individuos de s.

el momento de la repoblacio´ n juega un papel ma´s importante como determinante de la mejor ventana para la repoblacio´ n de s. trutta de lagos. individuos de s. trutta de taman˜os <200 g deberı´an ser repoblados solo si presas de pequen˜o taman˜o (individuos 0+ de c. albula en verano) son tambie´n abundantes en el momento y en el a´rea de la suelta. si las presas disponibles son solos grandes (adultos de c. albula en primavera), el taman˜o de repoblacio´ n deberı´a ser mayor con individuos de s. trutta claramente mayores de 200 g porque el mayor taman˜o amplia el rango de taman˜os de las presas disponibles. acknowledgements we thank teppo vehanen, teuvo niva, matti salminen, john thorpe and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on the manuscript. references auvinen,
