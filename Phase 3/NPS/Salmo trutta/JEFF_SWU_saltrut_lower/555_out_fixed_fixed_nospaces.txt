emigration and growth in juvenile brown_trout was investigated in an artiﬁcial stream with sand added to produce sections of embedded or nonembedded substratum. fish were allowed to leave the sections and were caught daily in a downstream trap. after catching and counting, ﬁsh were put back in their original section in order to keep the same amount of ﬁsh. captures were high only on the ﬁrst days after ﬁsh release. during the ﬁrst 6 days after ﬁsh release, downstream-moving ﬁsh were more numerous in the embedded than in the nonembedded sections. the embedded substratum signiﬁcantly decreased the ﬁnal mean body weight and condition factor and increased heterogeneity in ﬁsh size. we suggest that a decrease in the habitat carrying capacity for juveniles could be the main factor explaining this result. v. bolliet1,2, a. bardonnet1, m. jarry1,2, j. c. vignes1, p. gaudin1 1umr ecobiop (inra/uppa), station d’hydro- biologie inra, saint-pe´e-sur nivelle, 2umr ecobiop (inra/uppa),

parameters used to evaluate the salmonid carrying capacity of streams. the substratum is usually composed of particles of different sizes, which provide shelters for invertebrate populations and foraging sites for young salmonids. interstitial spaces also offer refuges for small ﬁsh against predation or ﬂood events (jenkins 1969; heggenes 1988), while stony coarse substrata increase visual isolation between individuals and contribute to redu- cing the size of ﬁsh territories (kalleberg 1958; imre et al. 2002). one of the main disturbances of the streambed concerns the deposition of ﬁne sediment ﬁlling interstitial spaces. although sediments originate from natural erosion, human activities such as mining and forestry, as well as agricultural and urban develop- ment, have drastically increased the areas of embedded substratum over the last few decades (see waters 1995 for review). this process affects both the density and diversity of invertebrates, which represent the main food supply for juvenile salmonids (reviewed by cordone & kelley 1961; chutters 1969; waters 1995). it also affects ﬁsh populations, with the deleterious effects of ﬁne sediments in salmonid redds being widely reported (reviewed by chapman 1988; waters 1995; soulsby et al. 2001). in several ﬁeld studies, an embedded substratum is thought to reduce ﬁsh pop- ulations by increasing ﬁsh emigration and mortality (mccrimmon 1954; saunders & smith 1965; elwood & waters 1969; barton 1977; bjornn et al. 1977; hillman et al. 1987). the effect on growth, however, has rarely been investigated. indeed, it may be difﬁcult to detect the effect of an embedded substratum on growth because smothered substratum might decrease density and lead to a compensatory increase in growth rate (alexander & hansen 1986). in juvenile coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch walbaum), one study conducted at a ﬁxed density in laboratory streams showed a decrease in growth related to the level of ﬁne sedimentation. however, the mechanisms involved in this process were not discussed (crouse et al. 1981). doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00100.x 289 bolliet et al. the aim of the present study is to highlight the link between substratum quality and growth, by exposing young brown_trout to embedded and nonembedded substratum in closed sections of an artiﬁcial channel. final mean weight and length were estimated after 3 weeks and the results are discussed in relation to invertebrate drift and changes in physical habitat suitability. methods experimental site the experiment took place in an artiﬁcial stream fed by the lapitxuri brook, a tributary of the nivelle river in the south-west of france near the spanish border. the artiﬁcial stream was separated into four sections (fig. 1), ﬁlled with a 60-cm deep cobble layer. abiotic factors such as ﬂow rate, water height and substratum quality were controlled. food supply was provided by invertebrate drift from the lapitxuri brook and by the production of the channel itself. as self-production in the channel can generate longitudinal differences in the different sections, they were divided longitudinally by a net preventing ﬁsh movement between the half- sections, each having an area of 12 m2. in the left half- sections, the topmost 8 cm of the substratum was isolated from the deeper layer by a plastic sheet, and the substratum was embedded with sand brought from a tributary of the lapitxuri brook (this represents the treatment). the control condition (nonembedded sub- stratum) corresponded to a mixture of pebbles while, in the treatment sections (embedded substratum), pebbles were two-third imbedded with sand (table 1). this was achieved by adding sand without water ﬂow until pebbles were two-third embedded (visual estimation), and then gently opening up to the working ﬂow to prevent ﬂushing of the sand by the ﬂow. fish were released into sections 2 and 4, which are designated here as the upstream and downstream sections, respectively (fig. 1). traps located at the downstream end of each half-section allowed daily morning counts of the downstream-moving ﬁsh, which were immedi- ately released back into the half-section from which they came. flow was maintained during the whole to produce a mean water velocity of experiment )1) and a mean water depth 9 cm s of 13 cm (range 10–15 cm), which were considered as optimal habitat conditions for young trout (roussel & bardonnet 1997, 2002; heggenes et al. 1999). )1 (range 7–11 cm s water supply 2.4 m 10 m 1 2 3 4 free section upstream section 2 x 120 trouts fish traps

june, 3 weeks after preparing the channel. accord- ing to the literature, this period is long enough to allow invertebrate populations to settle (matthaei et al. )2, which 1996). density reached a value of 10 ﬁsh m agrees with the expected maximum density according to grant & kramer (1990). care was taken not to disturb ﬁsh during the time of the experiment (no walking close to the channel). on 7 july, i.e., 23 days after release, ﬁsh were captured by electroﬁshing and then counted, weighed and measured after 24 h of food deprivation. three ﬁshing took place on the ﬁrst day of sampling (early morning, noon and afternoon), which allowed us to catch 95% of the ﬁsh in each half-section (the remaining 5% were caught the day after and were subjected to the same treatment). twenty ﬁsh per half- section were randomly selected, killed by lethal anaesthesia and preserved in 4% formalin to determine stomach content. growth performance was described using: ﬁnal weight and length; condition factor (k) ¼ w/l3, heterogeneity in ﬁsh size ¼ coefﬁcient of variation for the ﬁnal ﬁsh body weight (cwf)/ coefﬁcient of variation for the initial ﬁsh body weight (cwi). invertebrate sampling the day before the end of the experiment, invertebrate drift was sampled during 24 h using a 250 lm net mesh at the upstream end of each channel half-section. the net opening (30 cm · 30 cm) made it possible to sample a third of the ﬂow (ﬂow was forced through two 1-m wide openings – one per each half-section – at the ends of the channel). samples were preserved in 4% formalin. in addition, a drift sample was also collected in each half-section 3 h prior to ﬁshing in order to compare trout diet and invertebrate drift (4:30–7:30 hours, invertebrates were identiﬁed to the family level and counted. time). solar length and condition initial and ﬁnal ﬁsh weight, factor in embedded and nonembedded half-sections were compared using the student’s t-test. dried weights of stomach contents were compared using the mann–whitney u-test. three-way anova (loca- tion, substratum and date) was performed to compare the number of trout moving downstream on the embedded and nonembedded sides. results fish drift the number of ﬁsh moving downstream was high on the ﬁrst 2 days. during the ﬁrst 6 days, trout moving downstream were more numerous in the treatment than in the control section (fig. 2). from day 7 to day 23, downstream catches were low and ranged from 0 to 5 individuals per day, except on day 13 (seven trout in the upstream treatment) and on day 16 (10 trout in the upstream control). avian predation risk probably led to this unusually high downstream dispersion, which disturbed the anova results (a kingﬁsher was observed near the channel on theses dates). therefore, the three-way anova was performed only for the unaffected period, i.e., from day 0 to day 12. the date and the substratum had a signiﬁcant effect on the number of trout moving downstream (f11,11 ¼ 170.47, p < 0.0001; f1,11 ¼

and 65%, respect- ively; upstream treatment: 66.6%), except for the upstream control, where survival reached 75%. initial mean weight, length and condition factor were similar between control and treatment sections (table 2). at the end of the experiment, ﬁsh showed signiﬁcant higher mean weight, length and condition factor in the control, except for fork length in the upstream section, which was similar between control and treatment (table 2). in the treatment, length and weight gains were low (0.03 and 0.5 mm for length in the upstream and downstream sections respectively; 0.1 g for weight), yielding lower values than in the control (1.47 and 2.26 mm for length; 0.29 and 0.4 g for weight, in the upstream and downstream sections, respectively). both in control and in treatment, the condition factor of ﬁsh was higher at the end than at the beginning of the experiment. however, gains were lower in treatment than in control (0.065 and 0.11 on average, respectively). final heterogeneity in ﬁsh size was higher in the treatment (1.2 and 1.4, in the upstream and downstream sections, respectively) than in the control (1.0 in both sections). 24 h drift sampling in the upstream section, the aquatic invertebrate community structure and abundance of the drift did not vary much according to substrate quality (fig. 3a). in both control and treatment sections, baetidae represented about 65% of the total aquatic inverte- brates while chironomidae, represented only 5%, forming the bulk of the young trout preys (see below). in the downstream sections, invertebrates sampled over 24 h were more numerous in the control than in the treatment (6935 and 5370 items, respectively). this difference was mainly the result of baetidae and times more chironomidae, in the control abundant in the control sections, invertebrate drift was higher downstream the latter being four (fig. 3b). 292 upstream section baetidae chironomidae l chironomidae p simulidae elminthidae

between dry- weight stomach contents sampled in the control and in the treatment. although not signiﬁcant (mann–whit- ney u-test for large samples, zupstream ¼ 0.05 < 1.96; zdownstream ¼ 0.74 < 1.96), these results are rather in favour of the embedded sides (table 3). composition of the trout diet was similar in both control and treatment. we found 14 to 17 taxa in the stomach contents, which represented almost all the taxa found in the drift sampled 3 h prior to electroﬁshing. however, there was no correlation between the relative abundances of the taxa found in the trout diet and their abundance in the drift. indeed, as observed in the 24-h drift sample, the 3 h drift sample was dominated by baetidae (30–53%; table 3) while chironomidae, although largely dominant in the stomach contents (larvae + pupae: 90% of the diet), represented only 3–17% of the total drift. discussion the present study provides evidence that an embedded substratum can decrease ﬁsh biomass. we may tentatively explain this result by differences in size- selective mortality related to substratum quality. indeed, the increase in ﬁsh size may lead to a higher risk of avian predation (power 1987). thus, in embedded sections, the lack of shelter could have particularly exposed initially larger ﬁsh to avian predation. however, condition factor values were lower in the treatment sections, suggesting that the decrease in ﬁnal trout biomass rather reﬂects a deﬁcit in growth rate. moreover, the similar distribution around mean weight values between treatment and control tends to exclude the hypothesis of size- selective predation. the effect of treatment on growth may result from an increase in energy expenditure because of swim- ming and/or a decrease in food intake. in the ﬁrst hypothesis, swimming could be increased because of the reduced number of foraging sites. indeed, trout usually exhibit a ‘foraging behavior characterised as one of net energy maximization effectuated principally by cost minimization’ (bachman 1984). trout use discrete and energy-saving foraging sites, which were provided by numerous cobbles for the case of 0+ ﬁsh in the control. the increase in energy expenditure may also be due to the absence of visual barriers. the presence of a smothered substratum increases visual contacts between ﬁsh, which can lead to an increase in territoriality and competition (kalleberg 1958). this hypothesis has been recently corroborated by results on young rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss l.), which held territories 37.5–50% smaller in low- visibility environments (imre et al. 2002). in our experiment, an increase in competition is supported by the higher rate of emigrating ﬁsh and the higher size heterogeneity observed in the embedded sections. as agonistic behaviour increases inequalities in food intake between dominant and subordinate ﬁsh, initial differences between individuals will increase with time (jobling 1985). trophic resource represents another that might affect growth. several studies have demonstra- ted that invertebrate richness decreases with an embedded substratum and that community structure factor 293 bolliet et al. the input the species the proximity of changes as a function of tolerance (reviewed by waters 1995). in the upstream section, we observed no difference in terms of invertebrate abundance between control and treatment, probably because of from the lapitxuri brook. only 10 m of embedded substratum existed above the upstream section, which may represent a channel invertebrate production insufﬁ- cient to modify perceptibly the bulk of invertebrate drift coming from lapitxuri water input. in contrast, after a 30-m long stretch of embedded substratum (downstream embedded section), we observed a reduction in drifting invertebrate abundance in all taxa except elminthidae. despite this reduction, no difference in ﬁnal lengths and weights was observed between upstream and downstream embedded sec- tions, suggesting that food depletion was not important enough to affect growth under our experimental conditions. in control, invertebrate drift was higher downstream than upstream, especially for chironomidae (the main taxa found in the stomach samples). this might explain the higher growth observed in this section, although we cannot rule out an effect because of ﬁsh density, which was higher upstream. taken together, in the present experiment, these results provide some evi- dence that an embedded substratum affects trout juvenile growth. the mechanisms involved appear to be related to a decrease in the carrying capacity of the physical habitat for juveniles (through an increase of territory size for dominant ﬁsh and/or a decrease in the opportunity to use velocity shelters) rather than any decrease in energy intake. behavioural experiments are now in progress to study the impact of embedd- edness on competition. resumen las salir de 1. investigamos el efecto de
