offspring size selection; salmo_salar ; oncorhynchus_kisutch introduction classic life-history theory predicts that for a given environment a single optimal egg size maximising maternal fitness should evolve (smith & fretwell 1974). yet, variation in egg size within populations can be considerable. for example, egg size is often observed to increase with female body size (e.g. rep- tiles: congdon & gibbons 1987; fish: hendry et al. 2001; insects: lalonde 2005; birds: perrins 2008). larger females generally have more energy available for reproduction (e.g. jonsson et al. 1997), so it is not surprising that fecundity increases with maternal size. however, the fact that egg size also increases with maternal size is at odds with smith and fretwell’s (1974) classic model of egg size evo- lution, which predicts that investment per offspring should not vary with reproductive effort. their one class of theories explaining this apparent dis- crepancy suggests that the optimal egg size varies among females due to a correlation between female size and the environment that her young will experi- ence, and that this causes the optimal egg size to vary among females accordingly (parker & begon 1986; hendry et al. 2001; einum & fleming 2002). such theories have been of particular focus within salmonids, where the positive correlation between body size and egg size is particularly strong and con- sistent among species (hendry et al. 2001), and where several mechanisms may contribute to correla- tions between female size and offspring environment. for example, female size could potentially influence the physical nest quality (kondolf & wolman 1993; rennie & miller 2000) and thereby influence the energy spent by juveniles during emergence (rollin- son & hutchings 2011). in turn, this may influence the egg size optima as large eggs hatch into large juveniles with more energy reserves than smaller juveniles. another example is that oxygen availabil- ity may be influenced by female size in highly fecund aquatic organisms that distribute their eggs patchily. specifically, the high number of eggs in the correspondence: p. louhi, department of biology, university of oulu, fin-90014, oulu, finland. e-mail: pauliina.louhi@oulu.fi doi: 10.1111/eff.12121 23 louhi et al. nests produced by large and highly fecund females may lead to depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water surrounding the eggs. as large eggs appear to be less vulnerable to low oxygen levels than small eggs (einum et al. 2002; but see rombough 2007), this is predicted to lead to a larger optimal egg size for large females with high fecundity (einum et al. 2002; hendry & day 2003). it is also possible that the optimal egg size may depend on the posthatch environment, with the optimum being smaller under favourable conditions (hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 1999; rollinson & hutchings 2013). thus, if female fecundity is correlated with the posthatch environment via modulating the intensity of intraspe- cific competition (einum et al. 2008), high juvenile density resulting from the high fecundity of large females is expected to lead to selection for large eggs. here, we propose a novel alternative mechanism within this class of theories that attempt to explain correlations between female body size and egg size. our starting point is to recognise that the optimal egg size may be influenced by the timing of breeding. indeed, egg size has been observed to vary with tim- ing of breeding in several taxa (see summary by mcginley et al. 1987, and references therein). for example, in some marine fish where breeding takes place over several weeks, egg size has been found to decline through the season (chambers & waiwood 1996; kjesbu et al. 1996; bachan et al. 2012). one suggested explanation for this is that the environment experienced by the resulting offspring, and hence the optimal egg size, changes in a predictable manner over the season (e.g., bagenal 1971; chambers 1997). if so, and if larger individuals breed earlier in the season, such changes may also indirectly provide an adaptive explanation for the correlations between body size and egg size. a correlation between breed- ing time and body size may come about through adaptation by time if there are temporal changes in selection on body size or energy stores throughout the season (hendry & day 2005). alternatively, such correlations may arise through phenotypic plasticity (i.e., females that end up being large at maturation, either by having a high age or rapid growth, are able to, or choose to breed earlier in the season). how- ever, the actual underlying mechanism is inconse- quential in the context of whether egg size–body size correlations can be adaptive; if the result is that later breeding females are smaller, and the optimal egg size decreases throughout the season, smaller females should produce smaller eggs (and potentially smaller eggs while controlling for body size effects under adaptation by time). yet, studies that take seasonal trends in body size of female breeders and egg size into consideration are largely lacking for organisms 24 where seasonal patterns in egg size selection are known. stream-spawning salmonid fishes are good verte- brate models for studying effects of seasonal timing of spawning on egg size. first, in this group of organisms, the adult female size varies widely within populations (fleming 1996; einum et al. 2004). sec- ond, their breeding season typically stretches over a long period of time, up to 10 weeks in atlantic sal- mon (salmo_salar l., fleming 1996), causing consid- erable variation in the timing of offspring emergence (einum & fleming 2000). thus, there should be con- siderable potential for traits such as egg size, to respond to selection associated with breeding time. indeed, recent observations in atlantic salmon sug- gest that the survival advantage of offspring hatching from large relative to small eggs decreases through- out the breeding season (robertsen et al. 2013). this may seem counterintuitive as the intraspecific compe- tition for limiting resources increases cumulatively over the season as more juveniles emerge (einum & nislow 2005; einum et al. 2011), which should lead to larger competitive advantages for offspring hatch- ing from large eggs (einum & fleming 1999). how- ever, early emerging juveniles achieve a body size advantage through exogenous feeding which has been suggested to rapidly override the variation in body size at emergence that is due to egg size varia- tion (robertsen et al. 2013). thus, the declining effect of egg size on survival throughout the season may be caused by late emerging juveniles losing in competitive interactions with earlier clutches, inde- pendent of the size of the eggs that they originate from. similar loss of effects of egg size on perfor- mance under competition with older cohorts has been observed in other organisms, such as side-blotched lizards (uta stansburiana; svensson & sinervo 2000; sinervo et al. 2000). in the present study, our objectives were to exam- ine (i) temporal variation in egg size in two salmonid fish species (both absolute and relative to body size) and (ii) variation in female body size within the breeding season. we hypothesised that females spawning later in the season should produce smaller eggs than the ones spawning early. the relationship between breeding date and egg size was predicted to arise either as a result of smaller females (which are more likely to produce relatively small eggs) breed- ing later in the season or as a result of later-spawning females producing relatively smaller eggs for their body size. materials and methods our data on egg mass, spawning date and female length originate from previously published studies spawning time and the increase in egg size with female size in salmon kisutch) on coho salmon (oncorhynchus from canada and the united states (fleming & gross 1990, 1994) and atlantic salmon from norway (fleming et al. 1996, 1997, 2000; unpublished data). the eggs of coho salmon were either stripped from ripe females on the spawning grounds of ten wild populations during a single spawning season (flem- ing & gross 1990) or collected immediately upon death from one wild population spawning in semi- natural experimental arenas during two spawning seasons (fleming & gross 1994). the atlantic sal- mon were females of wild origin from the river imsa, south-western norway, that were captured over four different spawning seasons in a migration trap upon their return to the river. these were intro- duced into semi-natural spawning arenas where their date of first spawning and the locations of their nests were recorded (fleming et al. 1996, 1997, 2000, unpublished data). the eggs were subsequently exca- vated from the nests and weighed. we use the term season rather than year hereafter because season bet- ter reflects the breeding period, which for some pop- ulations may stretch across years, starting late 1 year and ending early the subsequent year. the first day of spawning for a given breeding season and popula- tion was set to a value of one, and the dates for sub- sequent spawnings were recorded as the consecutive number of days thereafter. ss, n = 31, all coho salmon egg masses were taken from for- malin-preserved eggs. for atlantic salmon, the eggs were either unpreserved (years 1992–1993) or pre- served in stockard’s solution (years 1990–1991). thus, based on data given in fleming et al. (1996, 1997), regressions giving the relationships between either unpreserved egg masses (up, mg) or eggs preserved in stockard’s solution (ss) and formalin- preserved-eggs (fp) were used for conversions (fp =  21.50 + 1.01 up, n = 42, r2 = 0.99, p < 0.001; fp = 110.66 + 0.78 r2 = 0.86, p < 0.001). all female lengths used were postorbital hypural body length (poh, mm; the distance from the posterior margin of the eye orbit to the posterior end of the hypural bone). the poh length was cho- sen because it excludes the variation caused by the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., elongating snouts) or fraying of tails from digging nests. for part of the atlantic salmon data, it was also necessary to convert adult female total length (tl; the distance from the most anterior part of the head to the tip of the longest caudal fin ray when the fin lobe of the tail is pressed) or fork length (fl; mea- sured from the most anterior part of the head to the poh (poh = median  19.02 + 0.81 tl, n = 104, r2 = 0.97, p < 0.001; poh = 13.22 + 0.83 r2 = 0.96, p < 0.001). fl, n = 101, caudal fin rays) to statistical analyses the data were analysed separately for the two species (coho and atlantic salmon) due to the differences in the number of populations and seasons (table 1). all models were fitted using the nlme package (pinheiro et al. 2011) in r (v.2.13.1, r development core team 2011). for coho salmon, we used linear mixed effects models (lmm) with population as a random effect. for these, we tested for both random intercepts among populations, as well as random slopes with respect to date effects (i.e., whether the relationship between date and body length or egg size differed among populations). in none of the cases did models with both random slopes and intercept perform better than models with only random intercepts (compari- sons using log-likelihood tests [zuur et al. 2009], p > 0.5 in all cases). in contrast, all models contain- ing random intercepts were better than those without (p < 0.006 in all cases). atlantic salmon data were modelled using general least squares models (gls). otherwise, the initial model structures were identical, and we only present the common fixed structures next. to test for a relationship between spawning date and absolute egg mass (m), the initial full mod- els included the main effect of date (d) and season (s) and the interaction between them as fixed effects: mij ¼ a þ b1di þ b2si þ b3disi þ ei (1) i is an individual where a is the intercept, index and j is a population index. conceptually, breeding season should have been fitted as random effect in our models as it is thought to be a representative sample of all possible seasons. due to the low num- ber of breeding seasons in our data, however, it would have been difficult to estimate the group-level variance using mixed models (schielzeth & nakaga- wa 2013), and thus, we fitted season as a fixed effect (quinn & keough 2002; schielzeth & nakagawa table 1. number of coho and atlantic salmon populations studied, spawning seasons, mean number of spawning days within each season (maximum values are given in parentheses) and total number of fish sampled. species coho salmon atlantic salmon number of populations spawning seasons mean (max.) no. of spawning days number of fish reference 11 1 2 4 16 (76) 164 17 (49) 42 fleming & gross (1990, 1994) fleming et al.

(1), but which also included the main effect of female length (l): mij ¼ a þ b1di þ b2si þ b3disi þ b4li þ ei finally, we tested whether female body length was related to spawning date using the main effect of date and season and the interaction between them as fixed effects: lij ¼ a þ b1di þ b2si þ b3disi þ ei for the coho salmon analyses, a variance structure (varident) was included in the body length model (eq. 3) as this improved the model (p = 0.026). (3) the structure of the statistical models reflects the nature of our predictions. we hypothesised that females spawning later in the season produced smal- ler eggs. this could come about by either (i) later- spawning females being smaller, which would be expected to translate into smaller absolute egg size or (ii) later-spawning females producing smaller eggs relative to their body size. these predictions do not consider the source of variation in body size/egg size (i.e., it does not matter whether variation is due to differences in growth rate or age at maturation). if seasonal trends in body size/egg size were due to age-specific timing of breeding, including age as an independent variable in the models would mask the relationship between season and body size/egg size. age at maturation was therefore not included as an independent variable in the models. furthermore, our choice of what is the dependent and what are the independent variables is not intended to imply causal- ity in one direction or the other, for example, whether being of a small body size causes individuals to breed late in the season (condition dependence) or whether those that breed late have a genotype that causes them to be small (adaptation by time). for an extensive treatment of these issues, see hendry et al. (1999) and hendry and day (2005). the explanatory variables of all initial models were assessed using a backward selection procedure (zuur et al. 2009, pp. 90–92). starting with the initial model, the explanatory variables were sequentially removed (starting with interactions) and the resulting simpler models were compared to the preceding mod- els using likelihood ratio tests. this removal of explanatory variables was carried out consecutively until the removal of any further terms resulted in a (p < 0.05) decrease in log-likelihoods. significant the fit of all models was inspected using residual plots and found to satisfy the assumptions of 26 normality and homogeneity of residuals for paramet- ric analysis. results for the coho salmon model of variation in egg mass (i.e., excluding the effect of female body length; eq. 1), the interaction term between spawning date and breeding season could be removed (comparisons of log-likelihoods of proceeding models: p = 0.874), as could the main effect of date (p = 0.784). the main effect of breeding season was retained in the final (comparison with null model, p < 0.001), model indicating that absolute egg size varied significantly between the two breeding seasons (table 2; fig. 1a). for the model of egg mass that includes the effect of female body length (i.e. relative egg mass, eq. 2), the interaction term between date and breeding season (p = 0.519) could be removed, as could the main effect of date (p = 0.167). the main effects of breed- ing season and female length were both retained in the final model (comparisons with simpler model, p < 0.001), indicating that female length had a sig- nificant positive effect on egg size and that the inter- cept of this effect varies between breeding seasons (table 2). finally, for the analysis of variation in female length (eq. 3), the interaction term between date removed (p = 0.175), as could the main effect of season (p = 0.067). however, the main effect of date (p = 0.001) was retained in the final model (table 3; fig. 2a). according to this model, there was a significant and negative relationship between the day and breeding season could be table 2. parameter estimates from the final models explaining variation in absolute and relative egg mass of coho and atlantic salmon given as treatment contrasts. estimate  se t p (a) coho salmon absolute egg mass intercept breeding season relative egg mass intercept breeding season female length (b) atlantic salmon absolute egg mass intercept breeding season 2 breeding season 3 breeding season 4 relative egg mass intercept breeding season 2 breeding season 3 breeding season 4 female length 182.64  5.54 35.98  8.74 10.68  26.24 39.20  5.72 0.34  0.05 108.20  1.66  0.75  8.12  17.17  2.78  3.98  4.93 81.86  10.48  2.12  6.86  14.31  2.96  2.38  4.80 0.05  0.02 32.94 4.12 0.41 6.85 6.40 65.03  0.09  6.18  0.81 7.82  0.31  4.83  0.50 2.54 <0.001 <0.001 0.684 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 0.928 <0.001 0.425 <0.001 0.760 <0.001 0.623 0.015 spawning time and the increase in egg size with female size in salmon 300 (a) 200 (b) 250 ) g m ( s s a m g g e  200 150 100 50 fig. 1. the relationship between the spawning date (days since start) and egg mass for (a) coho salmon and (b) atlantic salmon. 150 100 50 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 spawning date (days since start) table 3. parameter estimates from the final models explaining variation in female length in coho and atlantic salmon given as treatment contrasts.

fig. 2b). the main effect of breeding season (comparison with null model, p = 0.009) was retained in the model (table 3). discussion the present study provides limited support for the hypothesis that females spawning later in the breed- ing season should produce smaller eggs either as a result of smaller females breeding later in the season or as a result of later-spawning females producing relatively smaller eggs for their body size. although larger female coho salmon spawned earlier in the breeding season than smaller ones, there was no sta- tistically significant link between egg size and spawn- ing date, which is an implicit assumption in our hypothesis. furthermore, for the single population of atlantic salmon we examined there was no corre- sponding relationship between female and size 27 louhi et al. 700 (a) 700 (b) ) m m ( h t g n e l l e a m e f 650 600 550 500 450 400 350 650 600 550 500 450 400 350 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 spawning date (days since start) fig. 2. the estimated relationship (solid line;

hendry & day 2005), but no previous studies have addressed this for atlantic sal- mon. one potential explanation for the species differ- ence could be the competitive processes during breeding that determine access to suitable spawning habitats, which are more strongly body size-depen- dent in coho than atlantic salmon. females of both species establish spawning territories within which they construct nests to deposit their eggs. however, pacific salmon commonly spawn at higher densities and may thus face more intense breeding competition than atlantic salmon (fleming 1998). in situations where suitable breeding habitats are contested, larger females are better competitors compared with smaller females and may therefore secure access to spawning habitats of higher quality early in the season (van den 28 berghe & gross 1989; fleming & gross 1994). an alternative explanation is that larger females, which are able to create deeper nests (van den berghe & gross 1984; kondolf & wolman 1993; fleming 1996), face less risk of nest superimposition (i.e., destruction of nests by later spawners) when spawn- ing early than do smaller females. it remains to be shown, however, whether either or both of these fac- tors underlie the different relationships between spawning date and female size in our two salmonid species. nevertheless, the fact that female size and egg size are positively correlated in both species, whereas an effect of female size on breeding date can only be found in coho salmon, suggests that the latter relationship is not responsible for the evolution of the first one. in a previous field experiment on atlantic salmon, robertsen et al. (2013) reported that the survival advantage of larger eggs disappeared despite juvenile density increasing throughout the season. from this, it was predicted that the selection for a large egg size of later-spawning females would be relaxed, provid- ing the basis for a novel adaptive explanation for the correlation between body size and egg size. however, we found limited support for this hypothesis in this study. the correlations between female size and egg mass and between breeding date and female size should result in a correlation between breeding date and egg mass. yet, no such relationship was observed. thus, it may be that breeding date is not that important in shaping among female differences spawning time and the increase in egg size with female size in salmon in egg size and may be masked by other forces. for example, the relationship between female body size and egg size shows substantial phenotypic plasticity in salmonids, as females that have experienced low growth during the juvenile stage tend to produce lar- ger eggs (jonsson et al. 1996; morita et al. 1999; but see quinn et al. 2011). it is also possible that feeding conditions or immune status experienced during adulthood may affect offspring size, as observed in the texas field cricket (gryllus texensis) (stahlsch- midt et al. 2013). in addition, salmonid breeding is commonly patchily distributed (moir et al. 2004; isa- ak & thurow 2006; finstad et al. 2010), and this patchiness causes substantial spatial heterogeneity in juvenile densities (foldvik et al. 2010) and subse- quently variation in growth rates among individuals within populations (einum et al. 2011). thus, detec- tion of direct seasonal trends in egg size may require taking such effects into consideration simultaneously, which was not possible in the present study. the the reason for the apparent difficulty in providing empirical support for the adaptive explanations for correlations between female body size and egg size (e.g., wiklund et al. 1987; rombough 2007; rollin- son & hutchings 2010) may also be that such egg size variation is nonadaptive. for example, rather than being co-adapted, correlation between female body size and egg size may result from a non- adaptive pleiotropic effect. alternatively, both these traits may be correlated with a third unknown trait, and it may be more important for fitness to maintain these latter correlations than to break the one between egg size and body size. finally, physiological con- straints may limit adaptive responses. for example, long distance migration to breeding areas can be met- abolically expensive for many animals, and when such migration is immediately followed by breeding, it can shape reproductive allocation, including egg size, as observed in eudyptes penguins (crossin et al. 2010). in pacific salmon (oncorhynchus spp.), kinni- son et al. (2001) concluded that migration strongly favours an increase in the ratio of egg number to egg size with greater migration distance. similarly, braun et al. from upstream migration in sockeye salmon (oncorhyn- chus nerka), where females produced smaller but not fewer eggs in years of high water discharge. reported a carry-over effect (2013) it is increasingly recognised that environmental quality may affect the optimal egg size, given that most environments vary in space and time (reviewed in mousseau & fox 1998). several alternative and nonexclusive hypotheses may explain the commonly observed intrapopulation variation in egg size that manifests through correlations between female body size and egg size, and none of these has so far been excluded based on empirical data. these include effects of female body size on the optimal egg size through effects on sibling competition (parker & be- gon 1986), predation risk (sargent et al. 1987; mcginley 1989) or abiotic conditions during incuba- tion (hendry & day 2003). in the present study, we proposed yet another hypothesis which is based on the previously observed relaxed selection for large eggs later in the season (robertsen et al. 2013), suggesting that smaller females would benefit from producing smaller eggs if they breed later in the sea- son. our data confirmed a negative trend in the body size of coho, but not in atlantic salmon breeders over the breeding season, and we were unable to find a direct correlation between egg mass and breeding time for either species, which would also be expected from our hypothesis. accordingly, breeding date does not appear to be as important as other factors in shap- ing among female differences in egg size. acknowledgements we are grateful to norwegian university of science and tech- nology (ntnu) for providing working space for p.l. finan- cial support was received from academy of finland (grant no. 24301235) and university of oulu (to pl). references bachan, m.m., fleming, i.a. & trippel, e.a. 2012. maternal allocation of lipid classes and fatty acids with seasonal egg production 13 in atlantic cod (gadus morhua) of wild ori- gin. marine biology 159: 2281–2297. bagenal, t.b. 1971. the interrelation of the size of fish eggs, the date of spawning and the production cycle. journal of fish biology 3: 207–219. van den berghe, e.p. & gross, m.r. 1984. female size and nest depth in coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch). cana- dian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 41: 204– 206. van den berghe, e.p. & gross, m.r. 1989. natural selection resulting from female breeding competition in a pacific sal- mon (coho: oncorhynchus_kisutch). evolution 43: 125–140. braun, d.c., patterson, d.a. & reynolds, j.d. 2013. maternal and environmental influences on egg size and juvenile life- history traits in pacific salmon. ecology and evolution 3: 1727–1740. chambers, r.c. 1997. environmental influences on egg and propagule sizes in marine fishes. in: chambers, r.c., trip- pel, e.a., eds. early life history and recruitment in fish pop- ulations. edited by london: chapman & hall, pp 62–102. chambers, r.c. & waiwood, k.g. 1996. maternal and sea- sonal differences in egg sizes and spawning characteristics of captive atlantic cod, gadus morhua. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 53: 1986–2003. congdon, j.d. & gibbons, j.w. 1987. morphological con- straint on egg size: a challenge to optimal egg size theory?
