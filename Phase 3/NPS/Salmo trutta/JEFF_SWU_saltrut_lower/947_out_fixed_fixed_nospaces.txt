graham 1997). this is, in part, because most air-breathing organs (abos) are not ef®cient at unloading carbon dioxide or regulating ions (graham 1997); thus, ®shes have retained their gills for use in gas exchange, nitrogen excretion, and ionic regulation (claiborne 1998; gilmour 1998; karnaky 1998). however, there is great variation in the respiratory ef®ciency of the gills among air-breathing ®shes. for example, some air-breathing ®shes can survive at low levels of dissolved oxygen using only their gills for respira- tion (facultative). facultative air breathers are classi®ed in two ways: those that use air breathing over the whole range of dissolved oxygen po2 (partial pressure of dissolved oxygen; continuous breathers), and those that use air breathing only at speci®c (usually very low) po2 levels (threshold breathers; graham 1997). in contrast to faculta- tive breathers, some air-breathing ®shes must have access to the surface (obligate). obligate air breathers have reduced gills and are unable to meet their oxygen demands with aquatic respiration alone, even in normoxic water. thus, air-breathing ®shes vary in their use of dissolved and atmospheric oxygen, and this variation may re¯ect, at least in part, the costs and bene®ts of breathing mode in a particular habitat. theoretically, air breathing is energetically more ef®cient than water breathing because of air's superior properties as a respiratory medium. a given volume of water contains about 1/30th the oxygen of the same volume of air, and water is about 800 times more dense than air, which means that organisms generally have to expend more 37 randle & chapman energy to pass water over water-breathing organs than to pass air over abos (kramer 1983; dejours 1994; nikinmaa & salama 1998). how- ever, air-breathing species make up only 2% of known ®sh species (graham 1997) and comprise only a fraction of ®shes living in oxygen-scarce (hypoxic) waters. in addition, many air-breathing ®shes have retained a strong capacity for water breathing (kramer 1983). thus, the rarity of air breathers and the success of water breathers, even in habitats with low dissolved oxygen, suggest that there must be signi®cant costs to air breath- ing. these costs may include increased vulner- ability to aerial predation and increased energetic costs of travel to the surface (kramer 1983; kramer et al. 1983; bevan & kramer 1986). other environmental variables also affect air-breathing frequency and may therefore contribute to habitat use. for example, in some ®shes, dissolved oxygen in¯uences habitat selection (beitinger & pettit 1984) and strongly predicts respiratory allocation to air breathing when other environmental factors are controlled (bevan & kramer 1986; graham 1997). in addition, co2 and ph affect patterns of respiratory partitioning in some air-breathing ®sh species (singh 1976; babiker 1984; graham 1997). in this study, we examined whether habitat use by the african air-breathing anabantid, cteno- is consistent with poma muriei two potential costs of air breathing: travel to the surface and aerial predation. we examined (boulenger), habitat use in three ways. first, we quanti®ed en- vironmental correlates of habitat use in c. muriei. we measured variables that we considered di- rectly related to aerial predation and travel costs (e.g., vegetative cover and depth), and a suite of other variables that may affect breathing mode and frequency (e.g., dissolved oxygen, co2, tem- perature, and ph). second, we determined c. muriei abundance at different depths within the water column. finally, we experimentally tested whether the presence of vegetative cover reduced predation on c. muriei by aerial preda- tors. this study is not a direct test of the costs of air breathing, but provides an empirical evalua- tion of habitat use and aerial predation risk that will permit development of re®ned hypotheses for ®eld experiments in future investigations. materials and methods study site this study was conducted between may and august of 1998 in the lake nabugabo region of uganda, east africa. lake nabugabo is a small lake (24 km2, mean depth 4.5 m) located off the western shore of lake victoria (318500e and 3185603000e to 08250s and 08250500s; fig. 1). mean annual rainfall ranges from 52 to 197 cm and is bimodal with maximum rainfall between april±may and october±november (e®tre 1999). maximum temperature ranges from 26.2 to 38 fig. 1. a map depicting the approximate location of the three focal lagoons (la- goons 1±3) within the lwamunda swamp in uganda, east africa. 28.1 8c, and minimum temperature from 14.1 to 16.2 8c (e®tre 1999). the lake is surrounded by an extensive wetland, the lwamunda swamp (approximately 4 km wide), which is the focal habitat of this study. the lwamunda swamp vegetation is domi- nated by the grass miscanthidium violaceum, which grades into hippo grass (vossia cuspidata) and papyrus (cyperus papyrus) at the lake eco- tone. the swamp contains several small tribu- taries that drain the swamp, and several small lagoons (mean depth generally less than 2 m) that are situated in low-lying depressions behind or within the fringing wetlands (chapman & chapman 1998; chapman et al. 1996b). the lagoons are characterized by low levels of dis- solved oxygen, high levels of carbon dioxide, low conductivity, and low ph (cambridge nabugabo biological survey 1962; beadle 1981; chapman et al. 1996b; chapman & chapman 1998). we selected three lagoons from a series of 12 lagoons for which physical and limnologic char- acters were available (l. chapman, unpublished data). we selected lagoons that differed in char- acters thought to be important predictors of habitat use by air-breathing ®shes (i.e., water depth, availability of loose vegetative cover, dis- solved oxygen, etc.). all lagoons were located in the interior of the swamp approximately 3 km from the edge of lake nabugabo (fig. 1) and were known to contain c. muriei. fish community and study species the lwamunda swamp supports a unique ®sh community that differs from ®sh assemblages in the lake-ecotone or open-water habitats of lake nabugabo (chapman et al. 1996a,b). the swamp is inhabited by eight species of non-air-breathing ®shes, dominated by the cichlid pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae (schoeller), and ®ve species of air-breathing ®shes, the most common of which is the anabantid c. muriei (chapman et al. 1996b). c. muriei is an air-breathing ®sh of the family anabantidae, subfamily anabantoidei. all mem- bers of the subfamily have an abo modi®ed from the ®rst gill arch that forms a paired suprabran- chial chamber behind the head. inside each cham- ber is a bony element or labyrinth with highly vascularized epithelia tissue across which gases are exchanged (graham 1997). this anabantid is native to the lake victoria basin, and is common in nilotic waters, ranging from the white nile, south to lake victoria and lake edward (norris 1988). it is also found in the lake chad basin, the eastern tributaries of the niger river, and the upper congo river basin (norris 1988). within habitat use of ctenopoma muriei uganda, c. muriei is common in hypoxic wetlands and is the most abundant air-breathing ®sh spe- cies within the lwamunda swamp. potential aquatic predators of c. muriei within the lwamunda swamp include water snakes (e.g., grayia sp. and natriciteres sp.), predacious aqua- tic insects (e.g., family belostomatidae), and a small number of omnivorous ®shes. the air- breathing cat®sh clarias liocephalus (boulenger) is principally insectivorous, although larger indi- viduals may also consume ®sh (greenwood 1966; l. chapman, personal observations). p. multico- lor victoriae has a very diverse diet in the lake nabugabo region that includes invertebrates, algae, and ®shes (primarily a small cyprinodont and cyprinid species; greenwood 1965). our observations suggest that there are few piscivor- ous ®shes that target ®sh larger than a few cen- timeters in length. aerial predators seem to be the most abundant ®sh predators in this system and include several species of heron (e.g., family ardeidae) and king®sher (e.g., family alcedini- dae). the pied king®sher, ceryle rudis (l.), is the most common aerial predator within the lwa- munda swamp and was the focal predator in this study. environmental correlates of microhabitat use to determine environmental correlates of c. mur- iei abundance, we set minnow traps at randomly selected locations within three lagoons (lagoon 1, lagoon 2, and lagoon 3; fig. 1). in each lagoon, we set 20 minnow traps (45 cm long, 22 cm dia- meter, 7 mm mesh) at midday (11.40±15.30 h) and retrieved them the following morning (07.00± 09.00 h). each trap was set with the top partially exposed to permit ®sh access to the surface. for each trap site, we recorded the following var- iables: dissolved oxygen concentration do in (mg l 1) and water temperature (8c, measured with a ysi model 95 oxygen meter), free carbon dioxide (co2 in mg l 1; quanti®ed with a hach digital titration unit), ph (measured with a chek- mite ph sensor), conductivity (ms cm 1; mea- sured with a ysi model 30 conductivity meter), water depth, percentage dense vegetative cover (e.g., vegetation not penetrable by ®sh, e.g., dense beds of m. violaceum), percentage loose vegetative cover (e.g. vegetation penetrable by ®sh or on the surface only), and vegetation type. do and water temperature were measured in the early morning (07.00±09.00 h) and midday (11.40±15.30 h), and co2 and ph were measured in the morning, with a subset of samples at midday. for each ®sh captured, we recorded the species and size (total length, tl). the trapping and 39 randle & chapman environmental monitoring were replicated three times at the same randomly selected sites for each lagoon. the values for the three replicates were averaged for analysis (i.e., three replications per trap site, 20 trap sites per lagoon, three lagoons). we used a stepwise multiple regression to iden- tify potentially important predictors of c. muriei abundance. partial correlation analysis was used to determine relationships between catch per unit effort (cpue; calculated as the number of ®sh per trap) of c. muriei and the independent variables when the linear effects of the other signi®cant independent variables were removed. we treated each lagoon separately in the multiple regression analyses to see if habitat use varied among lagoons. depth in the water column to determine c. muriei abundance at different positions in the water column, we set minnow traps (stacked on top of each other) from the surface to the bottom (0±22 cm, 23±45 cm, 46± 68 cm) at a total of eight sites within the three lagoons. we selected sites where c. muriei were known to be abundant (based on earlier cpue data). minnow traps were left for approximately 24 h, and ®sh were processed as above. this sampling program was replicated two times at the eight selected sites. only four of the eight sites were deep enough to accommodate a 45±68-cm set; thus, comparisons were made between cpue in traps at the surface (0±22 cm) and traps below the surface (23±44 and 45±68 cm combined). for the deeper water sites where two traps were set below 22 cm (i.e., two times the effort), the total number of ®sh for each trap was combined and divided by two. we used a paired t-test to com- pare the mean cpue of c. muriei between the surface and deep-water sites. aerial predation experiment to determine if vegetative cover reduces aerial predation on c. muriei, we placed two pairs of (1.2 m diameter 0.9 m cylindrical enclosures height, 5 mm mesh) into lagoon 1. this lagoon was selected because it offered the best opportu- nity for visual observation of the focal predator, the pied king®sher. the ®rst pair of enclosures was constructed from black-plastic mesh, and the second pair was constructed from metal mesh. each cage was attached to four wooden posts approximately 2 m tall. mesh was fastened to the bottom of the cage to prevent ®sh from escaping, and the top of the enclosures was left open. the top of the cage extended above the level of the 40 water to prevent ®sh from jumping out. in each pair, one enclosure was provisioned with approxi- mately 80% natural vegetative cover (e.g., water lilies and grasses), and the other was left without vegetative cover. we used the same vegetation for each trial, but switched the cage that was used for either the vegetation or no vegetation treatment. we placed equal numbers (16±20) of c. muriei (mean tl 4.9 cm for each treatment) in each enclosure for each trial, and after 48 h, we counted the number of ®sh remaining for a total of six trials. we observed the enclosures from behind a blind for 1 h at the beginning of each trial. during these observations, we noted the species of aerial predator present and the number of ®shing attempts. an independent t-test showed no effect of mesh type (i.e., metal or plastic) on c. muriei survival for either vegetative cover or no cover (t 1.927, d.f. 4, p > 0.17; and treatments t 1.91, d.f. 4, p > 0.12, respectively); thus, we combined the results from both enclosure types and used a paired t-test to compare the mean percentage survivors from treatments with and without vegetative cover for all six trials. the enclosure experiment was repeated two times during a subsequent, shorter expedition to lake nabugabo (june 2000). at this time, dissolved oxygen levels in the lagoons were much higher than those during the previous experiment because of a longer rainy season. as before, a pair of enclosures was placed in lagoon 2, and one enclosure was provisioned with 80% vegetative cover. each enclosure was stocked with 20 c. mur- iei (mean tl 6.5 cm), and left for 48 h, after which the number of ®sh remaining in each enclo- sure was counted. results environmental correlates of microhabitat use dissolved oxygen was low in all three lagoons with morning values ranging from 0.45 mg l 1 in lagoon 3 to 0.55 mg l 1 in lagoon 2, and after- noon values, ranging from 0.76 mg l 1 in lagoon 1 to 1.46 mg l 1 in lagoon 2 (table 1). water temperature showed little variation among lagoons ranging from 21.6 8c in lagoon 3 to 22.3 8c in lagoon 1. diel variation was most pronounced in lagoon 2 where average tempera- tures increased by 2.8 8c between morning and midday. water depth averaged 51 cm in lagoon 1, 72 cm in lagoon 2, and 57 cm in lagoon 3 (table 1). conductivity was very low in all lagoons, ranging from 30.2 ms cm 1 in lagoon 1 to 49.8 ms cm 1 in lagoon 2. the ph was also low but varied little among lagoons, averaging 5.6 table1. area and distance from the main lake, physiochemical characters, and the percent of vegetative cover for three lagoons in the lwamunda swamp of lake nabugabo, uganda. variables mean (sd) maximum minimum mean (sd) maximum minimum mean (sd) maximum minimum lagoon1 lagoon 2 lagoon 3 habitat use of ctenopoma muriei 0.48 (0.16) 0.76 (0.39) 22.33 (0.26) 23.32 (0.28) 49.14 (17.56) 11.79 (1.86) 30.17 (5.47) 5.66 (0.13) 45.00 (30.00) 20.00 (26.00) 0.16 1.76 22.60 23.70 82.16 15.40 38.00 5.88 98.00 77.00 1456 3200 0.30 0.30 21.50 22.40 19.83 8.60 18.80 5.50 0.00 0.00 0.38 0.68 21.60 23.70 52.00 9.70 36.70 5.42 0.00 0.00 do (mg l^l, am) do (mg l^l, pm) temperature (8c, am) temperature (8c, pm) depth (cm) conductivity (ms cm 1) co2 (mg l^l) ph % total cover % loose cover area (m2) distance (m) for physiochemical characters and vegetative cover, the mean is presented along with the standard deviation and range (n 20). each value for dissolved oxygen, water temperature, depth, and vegetation were averaged over the three trials. do dissolved oxygen concentration (mg l 1), co2 (mg l 1) carbon dioxide concentration. 0.45 (0.17) 1.23 (0.90) 21.62 (0.44) 23.89 (1.00) 57.49 (19.49) 11.59 (1.00) 44.55 (5.67) 5.51 (0.12) 82.00 (26.00) 47.00 (35.00) 177 3000 0.55 (0.09) 1.46 (0.63) 21.87 (0.13) 24.65 (0.55) 71.99 (10.85) 14.51 (4.72) 49.75 (8.12) 5.64 (0.14) 71.00 (33.00) 56.00 (36.00) 384 3050 0.88 3.84 23.20 26.10 91.80 13.70 62.00 5.70 100.0 100.0 0.68 3.69 22.10 26.20 87.60 30.20 74.00 5.94 100.0 98.00 0.27 0.37 21.10 22.80 19.80 9.70 38.00 5.27 0.07 0.00 table 2. stepwise multiple regression analyses for the relationship between two independent variables (percentage loose vegetation and depth) and average c.muriei abundance in three lagoons of the lwamunda swamp, uganda. lagoon step 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 r2 0.134 0.343 0.493 0.478 p-value 0.498 0.007 0.003 0.033 variable ^ loose vegetation loose vegetation, depth loose vegetation partial correlation coefficient ^ ^ 0.560,  0.477 p-value ^ ^ 0.013, 0.039 frequently at depths below 22.0 cm (d.f. 7, t 3.96, p < 0.005;

fig. 3). dissolved oxygen dur- ing these trials averaged 0.7 mg l 1. the only aerial predator observed successfully ®shing within the enclosures was the pied king®sher (c. rudis). during 6 h of observation, 6 out of 46 dives into the enclosures by c. rudis were visibly successful. forty-two dives were in enclo- sures with no cover, and four were in enclosures with cover. in our shorter second set of experiments con- ducted after a period of heavy rain in june 2000, the dissolved oxygen concentration in lagoon 2 was much higher (mean do 3.9 mg l 1). in contrast to the results of the earlier experiments, aerial predation was extremely low. only one ®sh was absent from enclosures in the two trials (n 20 ®sh per treatment per trial), and this ®sh was missing from a cage with no vegetative cover. this suggests that the impact of aerial predation may change seasonally. discussion the cost of aerial predation the distribution and abundance of ®shes can be in¯uenced by numerous environmental characters including, as examples: the physical and chemical composition of water (magnuson et al. 1979; matthews et al. 1985; suthers & gee 1986; chapman & liem 1995), location and quality of food (werner et al. 1981; godin & keeleyside 1984; talbot & kramer 1986), social dynamics of conspeci®cs (dibble & harrel 2000), and presence of predators (werner et al. 1983; power 1984; power et al. 1985). for air-breathing ®shes, habi- tat use may re¯ect the interaction of many of these characters and costs speci®c to aerial respiration. we found evidence to suggest that c. muriei uses habitats that potentially reduce suscepti- bility to aerial predators. in two of the three lagoons sampled, c. muriei was most abundant in habitats with loose vegetative cover, and we 42 experimentally demonstrated that the presence of vegetative cover signi®cantly reduced susceptibil- ity of c. muriei to aerial predators. vegetation provides increased structural complexity, and thus may reduce hunting ef®ciency of aerial predators. such habitats have been demonstrated to act as refugia for several prey species of ®sh from aqua- tic predators (werner et al. 1983; wolf & kramer 1987; chapman et al. 1996a) and likely provide similar protection from aerial predators. however, the importance of vegetative cover in affecting vulnerability of air-breathing ®shes to aerial pre- dators may vary in relation to dissolved oxygen. in laboratory experiments, randle (2001) found that c. muriei increased allocation to water breathing (lowered air-breathing frequency) at higher dissolved oxygen levels. thus, when dis- solved oxygen is high, c. muriei can potentially reduce risk of aerial predation by decreasing air- breathing frequency. these ®ndings are consistent with results of our predation experiment con- ducted during the wet season. when dissolved oxygen concentration was higher, aerial predation was low in treatments with and without vegetative cover, even though the number of aerial predators did not noticeably change. given these potential effects of dissolved oxygen on respiratory parti- tioning, and the interaction between air breathing and aerial predation pressure, we might expect c. muriei to alter habitat selection criteria with seasonal changes in dissolved oxygen. for exam- ple, in the dry season, when low dissolved oxygen demands a higher air-breathing frequency, the bene®ts of vegetative cover may preclude ®shes from selecting habitat for other factors such as food, mates, etc. we did not look at microhabitat selection during the wet season, but we might anticipate a relaxation of selection for vegetative cover under higher dissolved oxygen conditions. in a similar study, chapman (1995) found seasonal changes in habitat selection by the air-breathing clariid cat®sh c. liocephalus, and suggested that this change may be the result of increased alloca- tion to water breathing during the wet season when dissolved oxygen levels were higher. clearly, factors other than dissolved oxygen also vary seasonally and may affect interactions between c. muriei and the pied king®sher; however, dis- solved oxygen is one of the most seasonally var- iable water quality characters at these sites. during the dry season, we did not ®nd a correlation between c. muriei abundance and dissolved oxy- gen; however, the variation among microhabitat sites within a lagoon was relatively low. in addition to use of vegetative cover, c. muriei appears to be using a depth within the water column that reduces their susceptibility to aerial predators. the two factors important in in¯uen- cing the impact of pied king®sher predation on ®shes are the size of the ®sh and its depth in the water column (jackson 1984). the pied king®sher prefers prey species between 3 and 6 cm, which includes much of the upper size range of c. muriei, and have a maximum diving depth of 30 cm (white®eld & blaber 1978). thus, avoidance of the upper part of the water column by c. muriei may limit the success of one of the most abundant aerial predators in the lwamunda swamp. in a study of the air-breathing cat®sh c. liocephalus, chapman (1995) found a positive correlation between water depth and ®sh density in the dry season. in addition, ®sh in deeper water had fewer injuries and lower rates of disappearance than those from shallower waters. chapman (1995) suggested that c. liocephalus may select deeper waters in the dry season to avoid aerial predators. the use of deeper water as refugia from predators has also been demon- strated in cray®sh, where individuals in deep water suffered fewer injuries and lower predation rates in the presence of terrestrial predators (eglund & krupa 2000). the cost of travel and multiple functions of surfacing an energetic cost of travel to the surface has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments of cory- doras aeneus (kramer & mcclure 1981) and colisa chunna (bevan & kramer 1986). these studies suggest that air breathing may have sig- ni®cant temporal and energetic costs even at moderate depths of 1±2 m. however, increased energetic and temporal expenditures may not affect condition. for example, bevan & kramer (1987) found that the benthic cat®sh c. macro- cephalus, increased temporal allocation to air breathing with increased depth; however, this did not result in reduced growth, even when ®sh were fasted for 14 days at low levels of dissolved oxygen. in all lagoons, c. muriei was most abundant at a depth greater than 22 cm. however, in the deepest lagoon, c. muriei abundance was gener- ally higher at shallower stations. this suggests an avoidance of the deeper water in the deepest lagoon, which is consistent with reducing travel costs. as the average depth of the lagoons ranged from only 49 to 72 cm, the locomotory costs of air breathing for c. muriei at these sites may be quite low except in the deepest lagoon. within the lwamunda swamp, aerial predation appears to be a major driver of habitat use by c. muriei. this is supported both by c. muriei's use of vegetated cover and their position within the water column. habitat use of ctenopoma muriei habitat use may also be affected by travel costs, but only in the deepest lagoons. c. muriei abundance was not correlated with ph or dissolved co2 in any of the three lagoons; however, these factors varied little among micro- sites. others factors that may affect frequency of air breathing and thus habitat selection in c. mur- include buoyancy regulation and feeding. iei c. muriei uses its air-breathing organ to regulate buoyancy (schuster 1989); thus, the frequency of air breathing may be in¯uenced by abo volume. it is also a visual predator and will feed on invertebrates at the surface (a. randle, personal observations). thus, travel to the surface may serve multiple functions. an effective way for c. muriei to reduce costs of surfacing may be to reduce travel distance and susceptibility to pre- dators without signi®cantly reducing the fre- quency of surfacing. vegetative cover may also provide a greater diversity of invertebrate prey. in their study of the macroinvertebrate fauna in major habitats within lake nabugabo (forest edge, water lily, m. violaceum ecotone, v. cuspi- data, and open water), e®tre et al. (2001) found taxa richness to be highest in the m. violaceum and v. cuspidata habitats. thus, selection of vegeta- tive cover may provide a good food base and facilitate multiple functions of surfacing while minimizing the risk of aerial predation. the results of this study provide evidence to suggest that two potential costs of air breathing (travel and predator risk) in¯uence habitat use by c. muriei and point to future studies that can separate other risks of habitat choice from air- breathing costs speci®cally. examples include a more extensive ®eld manipulation comparing sur- vival of air breathers in enclosures with and with- out vegetation across a range of lagoons that vary in dissolved oxygen concentration or a compar- ison of habitat use of c. muriei across habitats of similar depth that differ in aerial predation pressure. resumen 1. en este estudio examinamos si el uso del haâ bitat por el pez anabaâ ntido africano de respiracioâ n aeâ rea c. muriei (boulen- ger) es consistente con dos costes potenciales de respiracioâ n aeâ rea: viajar a la super®cie y predacioâ n aeâ rea. examinamos el uso de haâ bitat de tres maneras. primero cuanti®camos cor- relaciones ambientales del uso de haâ bitat en c. muiei en tres lagunas de lwamunda swamp (uganda). medimos variables ambientales que consideramos relacionadas con la predacioâ n aeâ rea y con los costes de viajar (e.g., cubierta vegetal y profundidad) y un conjunto de variables que pueden afectar el modo de respirar y la frecuencia (e.g., oxõâ geno disuelto, co2, temperatura y ph). segundo, determinamos la abun- dancia de c. muriei a diferentes profundidades de la columna de agua. finalmente, analizamos experimentalmente si la 43 randle & chapman presencia de cubierta vegetal reduce la predacioâ n sobre c. muriei por parte de predadores aeâ reos. 2. la abundancia de c. muriei estuvo positivamente corre- lacionada con la extensioâ n de la cubierta vegetal en dos de las tres lagunas muestreadas y negativamente correlacionada con la profundidad en la laguna mas profunda. ademaâ s, c. muriei no parecioâ distribuirse homogeâ neamente en la columna de agua. en las localidades de captura donde la profundidad fue estudiada, c. muriei fue capturada mas frecuentemente por debajo de los 22.0 cm. esta profundidad esta probablemente fuera del rango de buceo del martõâ n pescador (ceryle rudis) que es el principal predador aeâ reo en lwamunda swamp. 3. la predacioâ n aeâ rea sobre c. muriei fue extremadamente alta en jaulas sin cubierta vegetal (71%) respecto de jaulas con cubierta vegetal (9%). el oxõâ geno disuelto durante estos ensayos fue de promedio 0.7 mg l 1. el uâ nico predador aeâ reo observado pescando con eâ xito en las jaulas fue el martõâ n pescador. en un segundo experimento llevado a cabo despueâ s del periodo de lluvias, la concentracioâ n de oxigeno disuelto fue mucho mayor (media do 3.9 mg l 1) y la predacioâ n aeâ rea fue extremadamente baja (3%). esto puede re¯ejar un menor esfuerzo en respiracioâ n aeâ rea y uno mayor en respiracioâ n acuaâ tica, cuando el oxigeno disuelto es alto. acknowledgements funding for this research was provided from the
