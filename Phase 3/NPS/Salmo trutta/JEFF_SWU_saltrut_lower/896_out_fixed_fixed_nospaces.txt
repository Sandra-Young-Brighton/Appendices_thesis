wootton, 1998). pigmentation is an important component of visual signals in fishes, both within and among species. the expression of colour, which often comprises multicomponent sig- nals, involves pigment- based and structural colours (price, weadick, shim, & rodd, 2008; wootton & smith, 2015). carotenoid- based co- louration, which typically appears as yellow, orange or red, has been of particular interest because these are costly to produce and thereby serve as a reliable indication of individual condition and foraging ability (olson & owens, 1998), with a potential role in mating system evo- lution (wootton & smith, 2015). different carotenoid pigments are responsible for conveying different information to potential mates or rivals (mclennan, 2007). colour traits can function in sexual selection, which acts on differences in fitness among individuals that arise due to the number and identity of their mates. because sexual selection tends to act more strongly on males than females (andersson, 1994), it is males that usually express the brightest and most elaborate visual traits, including nuptial colouration. although a broad simplification, there is a tendency in many taxa for a preference to mate with more colourful and ornamented individuals (andersson, 1994; price et al., 2008). understanding the adaptive value of mate choice (sensu kokko, brooks, jennions, & morley, 2003) based on visual signals is a contro- versial field of research, but may arise through fitness benefits associ- ated with mate choice, or an arbitrary mechanism (andersson, 1994; wootton & smith, 2015). pigmentation in north american sunfishes (centrarchidae), in common with most other teleosts, is more extensive in males than in females (scott & crossman, 1973). in the pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus, males have a striking, red operculum spot that is associated with male aggression (stacey & chiszar, 1978). in aquarium studies, breeding males were shown to attack fish models that intruded into their nesting area, and models with red colour on the operculum spot or iris received more attacks and aggressive displays than those without colour (stacey & chiszar, 1978). it is recognised that domi- nance relationships among sunfishes are related to colouration, with dominant, brightly coloured parental (territorial) pumpkinseed males building and defending nests, and performing courtship behaviour to attract females to their nest for spawning. male sunfishes also adopt alternative mating strategies (sensu wootton, 1984), whereby subdominant “cuckolder” males attempt to intrude into the nest of a parental male that is in the act of spawning (gross, 1979, 1982). cuckolder males are early maturing, do not perform courtship and avoid fitness costs associated with parental care (smith & wootton, 1995). small cuckolders, which typically possess disproportionately large testes, are referred to as “sneakers” due to their rapid entry into the nest of a spawning territorial male to release sperm at the moment of spawning. large cuckolders, which have testes of in- termediate size relative to parental and sneaker males, are termed “satellites” and participate in spawning by mimicking female char- acteristics and entering the nest of a territorial male as a potential mate (garner & neff, 2013; gross, 1982). despite aggressive de- fence of their nest by parental males, cuckolder males frequently intrude successfully during spawning events (rios- cardenas, 2003). in the close congener, bluegill lepomis macrochirus, a model taxon for research on alternative reproductive strategies (taborsky, 2008), gross (1982) characterised two cuckolder phenotypes, based on a population in lake opinicon, canada. sneaker bluegill are small and have relatively large testes relative to parental males, with a mean gonado- somatic index (gsi) of 4.6 (contrasting with parental males with a mean gsi of 1.1). in contrast, satellite male bluegill are larger than sneakers, with gsi values (mean 3.3) that are intermediate be- tween those of parental males and sneakers. in applying these cri- teria to pumpkinseed from the same lake, gross (1982) identified the sneaker phenotype, but not that of the satellite. in a subsequent paternity study, neff and clare (2008) noted that the satellite strat- egy had yet to be reported for pumpkinseed. in a subsequent ge- netic study of bluegill–pumpkinseed hybridisation, garner and neff (2013) did not distinguish between satellites and sneakers, referring to them collectively as cuckolders. thus, there are no reports that the satellite phenotype (sensu gross, 1982) is expressed in pumpkin- seed, and hereafter, we use the term “cuckolder” to refer to the alter- native male mating strategy in pumpkinseed to the parental strategy. the approach, onset and end of the reproductive period in fishes can often be identified by variation in gsi, the relationship between gonad weight and somatic weight (wootton, 1998). male mating polymorphisms, particularly the cuckolder strategy, are associated with sperm competition, which occurs when the spermatozoa of dif- ferent males compete for the same eggs (parker, 1970). males ex- pressing alternative mating strategies tend to experience a higher “risk” of sperm competition, that is an elevated probability that their sperm will compete with those of other males, because they usually mate in the presence of at least one competitor, typically the terri- torial male and often other cuckolder males (wedell, gage, & parker, 2002; wootton & smith, 2015). an outcome is that cuckolders are predicted to show adaptations for sperm competition, including rel- atively (or even absolutely) larger testis size, larger ejaculates and zięba et al.876  |     faster swimming spermatozoa (montgomerie & fitzpatrick, 2009). consequently, individual gsi can be used to identify male mating strategy. pumpkinseed have been widely established outside their native north american range. most introductions have been in europe, where the species was introduced in the late 19th and early 20th cen- turies, establishing populations in at least 28 countries (copp & fox, 2007). most of the research undertaken on pumpkinseed in europe has focused on female growth and life- history traits (reviewed in fox & copp, 2014), with relatively few studies on males (e.g. almeida, tobes, miranda, & copp, 2012; valente et al., 2016). in its native range, neff and clare (2008) observed temporal variability in the patterns of pumpkinseed paternity and suggested that these reflect temporal variation in mating opportunities, parental male defence ability or cuckolder densities. given this temporal variability, spatial variations are also feasible, possibly extending to visual signals, such as the oper- culum spot, which is assumed to be important for males for attracting mates (stacey & chiszar, 1978). the aim of this study was to determine whether the presence and size of the red operculum spot serve as a signal of sex and/or mating strategy in pumpkinseed. to do this, we used estimates of gsi to categorise males as nesters or cuckolders and fitted models to test whether spot presence and size varied between the sexes and between males adopting different reproductive strategies. we pre- dicted that parental males, which experience intrasexual contests and intersexual mate choice, would be more likely than cuckolder males and females to express a red operculum spot and that these males would also express larger red spots. 2 |  methods previously unpublished data for 1514 pumpkinseed were obtained from established non- native populations in belgium, england, france, the netherlands and poland (table 1), with all data elements being available for 924 specimens of which 465 were males, 387 were ta b l e 1 country, population, location (wgs84 latitude and longitude coordinates) and capture method for male pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus, including number of specimens (n), mean and sd of standard length (mm) and the mean, minimum (min) and maximum (max) of the gonado- somatic index (gsi) for each population by water body. ang, angling;

(2009). where possible, the sampling aimed to obtain ≈ 100 specimens for growth and life- history trait analysis (e.g. cucherousset et al., 2009; villeneuve, copp, fox, & stakėnas, 2005) and so was not quantitative. in the three english sites, sam- pling was by catch- per- unit- effort (cpue) with minnow traps (see fox, villeneuve, & copp, 2011). the data on female growth and life- history traits, but not operculum spot occurrence or size, have been previously published for all these populations (cucherousset et al., 2009; fox et al., 2011; valente et al., 2016; villeneuve et al., 2005), except the two populations from north- west poland (table 1): (i) a former clay pit (brodowski pond) of ≈ 0.9 ha (maximum depth of 7 m) situated in szczecin with a water temperature that ranges from 4°c under thick ice cover in winter to 25°c in summer; and (ii) an artificial channel (4 km long, mean depth of 4.5 m), situated on the lower river oder near the city of gryfino that receives heated water effluent from a power plant, resulting in daily water tempera- ture fluctuations of 5–15°c, with maximum temperatures of 30°c in summer and 15°c in winter. there is currently no published study on the north american source populations of pumpkinseed in europe. for all populations, pumpkinseed were collected at the beginning of the spawning season (between may and june), immediately killed with a lethal dose of anaesthetic following licensed procedures in the country of collection and cooled to freezing for subsequent process- ing in the laboratory. after thawing, specimens were photographed (left side only) using a nikon coolpix 5000 camera for morphological analysis. the presence of operculum spots (denoted as present or absent) was recorded, including the rare occurrence of deviations from red (i.e. yellow or orange, or reddish shades thereof). note that the reflectance spectra, hue or intensity of operculum spots was not measured, nor was the spectral sensitivity of pumpkinseed in the red region of the light spectrum known. the presence of an operculum spot was recorded for both sides of each specimen assessed, but only the left side of the fish (the standard for fish measurements) was used for quantifying the size of the red operculum spot, which was estimated as the surface area of the spot (imagej, 1.48v). fish were measured for standard length (sl, nearest 1 mm) and mass (nearest 1 g) and dissected to determine sex and gonad mass (in mg) when present. gsi was calculated as: 100 × gonad mass/total body mass) (wootton & smith, 2015). 2.1 | statistical analysis to categorise males as parentals or cuckolders, a frequency distribu- tions of male gsi were plotted by country. the resulting multimodal gsi frequency distributions were decomposed to normal distribu- tions using the bhattacharya method (bhattacharya, 1967), with a ta b l e 2 mean ( sd) pumpkinseed body mass, standard length (sl) and gonado- somatic index (gsi;

female, territorial or cuckolder. the model also contained a linear effect for fish sl (slij). exploratory analyses demonstrated differences among populations in the size and expression of red operculum spots. to accommodate this effect in the model, the random intercept populationj was included to introduce a correlation structure between observations for different fish from the same population, with variance σpopulation distributed nor- mally and equal to 0. to test whether parental males expressed larger red operculum spots than other males and females, the size of red spots was mod- elled on a zero- truncated subset of the data using a gaussian glmm, specified as: log10spotsizeij ~ n(μij, σ2) e(log10spotsizeij) = μij and var(log10spotsizeij) = σ2 μij = β1 + β2 × log10slij × β3× strategyij + populationi 2 populationj n(0,σ population ) where log10spotsizeij is the log10 size of red spot on fish i in popula- tion j and log10slij is the log10 standard length of fish i in population j. expected log10spotsizeij is μij with variance σ2 . analysis was conducted using the lme4 library (bates, maechler, bolker, & walker, 2014) in r (r core development team, 2017). model residuals were examined to ensure assumptions were met and that effects were adequately accounted for by the model. 3 |  results male gsi distributions were multimodal within countries (figure 1). with the exception of data from the netherlands, the overlap of nor- mally distributed gsi groups was low; si was always >2 and thereby provided meaningful separation of modal groups, even for the netherlands specimens (separation index = 2.68). decomposition of gsi distributions showed the threshold gsi value that distinguished parental and cuckolder males varied among countries, from 2.3 (poland) to 4.2 (england) (table 2, figure 1). in belgian, french and polish populations, separation of male strategies was ambiguous, with bhattacharya decomposition revealing two thresholds within these data (figure 1). in each case, the higher threshold was used as the cut- off between male strategies. the probability of expressing a red operculum spot was pre- dicted by male sl, with a significantly greater likelihood of a red spot in larger males (table 3; figure 2). the probability of a red operculum spot was also predicted by sex, with both cuckolder and territorial males significantly more likely to express a red spot than females (table 3; figure 2). among pumpkinseed that expressed a red spot, there was a significantly stronger interaction between sl and spot size in males than in females (table 4; figure 3), although there was no difference between male strategies classified by gsi (figure 3). two specimens were observed to possess a yellow operculum spot, a mature female from schoapedobbe pond and a male from brière marsh (table 1). 4 |  discussion our analysis of introduced pumpkinseed populations across europe demonstrated that the expression of a red operculum spot was more likely in mature males than females (table 3), whereas only a single sexually immature juvenile expressed a red spot. further, a signifi- cantly stronger interaction was observed (table 4) between red spot size and body size in parental and cuckolder males than in females. taken together, these findings indicate that in pumpkinseed, the presence and size of a red operculum spot signal sexual maturity and correlate strongly with body size in males. this signal, however, does not distinguish between the male mating strategies of parental and cuckolder. colour signals can have multiple functions, potentially convey- ing information to rivals, mates or both. in pumpkinseed, the func- tion of the red operculum spot is equivocal. the present findings are consistent with previous studies in demonstrating that a red spot has a potential role in male–male interactions by eliciting an aggres- sive response by males (stacey & chiszar, 1978). notably, during aggressive intrasexual contests, male sunfishes flare their opercula (colgan & gross, 1977), displaying the red spot to a rival facing them head- on. our results support a role for the red operculum spot in male contests, with the expression of a red spot primarily associated with sexually mature males and correlating with body size. however, this finding contradicts our prediction that parental males, which zięba et al.    |  879 surprisingly, we detected no significant difference between pa- rental and cuckolder males, either in the probability of expressing a red spot or in the strength of the relationship between red spot size and male size. alternative mating strategies in fish, which are ex- clusively shown by males in teleost fishes, are reflected most strik- ingly in reproductive behaviour, but also in external appearance and physiology. in contrast to gross’ (1982) interpretation of his sunfish model to a single native population of pumpkinseed, our analysis of non- native populations in europe suggests that, while a clear dis- tinction can be seen between the parental and cuckolder male re- productive strategies in relative testes size, the gsi value threshold that distinguishes parental and cuckolder males varies among popu- lations, ranging from 2.3 (poland) to 4.2 (england). a possible alternative explanation for the observed range of gsi values may relate to variation in pumpkinseed population density, which has consequences for the reproductive success of cuckolder males. in water bodies where the populations occurred at high density, traits associated with sperm competition, includ- ing large testes size, are favoured, thereby potentially selecting for relatively larger gonads (high gsi) in both parental and cuckolder males, with a consequent upward shift in the threshold between them. in the three ponds in england for which quantitative den- sity data were available (fox et al., 2011), pumpkinseed was virtu- ally the only species present in the two ponds where the species have been observed in high density and males in these ponds had higher mean and maximum male gsi values than observed in the f i g u r e 1 observed gonado- somatic index (gsi): frequency plots for pumpkinseed among country of origin with gaussian distribution curves and separation indices (si), generated using bhattacharyya’s (1967) method. threshold gsi values for separating frequency distributions for male mating strategies are indicated with arrows ta b l e 3 summary of bernoulli glmm to model the probability of pumpkinseed expressing a red operculum spot. sl, standard length;

milinski & bakker, 1990). the red ornament, which has a strong genetic component, is also found in females and its expression in females is consistent with pleiotropy (yong, peichel, & mckinnon, 2016). pleiotropy may also me- diate the expression of a red operculum spot in female pumpkinseed, and possibly also in cuckolder males, although this conclusion relies on there being: (i) a shared genetic basis to red spots in males and females and (ii) no adaptive value in expressing a red spot in females and cuck- olders. these assumptions remain to be tested. the presence of two male gsi thresholds in pumpkinseed popula- tions in belgium, france and poland provides evidence that, contrary to gross (1982), both the satellite and sneaker strategies may be pres- ent in some non- native european pumpkinseed populations (figure 1). alternatively, these findings may simply reflect the greater heteroge- neity in age at maturity within some european populations (copp & fox, 2007; fox & copp, 2014), which is a possible outcome of multiple sources of introduction or adaptation to conditions outside the natural range of the species. behavioural studies, complemented with morpho- logical analyses, are needed to clarify the existence of a satellite strategy in european pumpkinseed populations. similarly, variation in predation among populations has the capacity to modify the selective landscape for red operculum spots, as sexual selection for visual signals can be limited through natural selection by predators in teleosts (endler, 1980; wootton & smith, 2015). although outside the scope of the present study, the ef- fect of selective predation on pumpkinseed in response to the expression of the red operculum spot is not known and warrants further research. in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the presence of a red operculum spot in pumpkinseed is associated with sexual matura- tion, primarily in males. the size of red spot correlates with body size in parental and cuckolder males, although there was no difference in the presence or relative size of the red operculum spot between male mat- ing strategies. the observed gsi distributions suggest the possible ex- istence of the satellite mating strategy in some european populations, but alternatively, this may be due to variations in pumpkinseed popu- lation density or to selective predation. the function, if any, of a red operculum spot in females is not clear but is consistent with pleiotropy. acknowledgements this study, which derives from work initiated as part of a n.a.t.o. collaborative linkage grant (lst- clg no. 979499), supported zięba et al.882  |     by consecutive research contracts (sf0238 and sf0248) from the uk department of environment, food and rural affairs (to ghc), which were complemented by a marie curie postdoctoral fellow- ship (pief- ga- 2008- 219707) and a subsequent research grant from the national science centre, poland (decision no dec- 2011/01/d/ nz8/01807) to gz. we thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and perceptive comments. author contribution the study was conceived by ghc and mgf. specimens were col- lected and processed by ghc, gz, mgf, sy, ez, gm, jc, hv and hhvk. data were analysed by ghc, sy, gz, mp and cs. the ini- tial draft of the manuscript was prepared by sy, ez, gz and ghc, and then extensively revised by gz, cs and mp, with co- author contributions. orcid gordon h. copp http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4112-3440 references introduced pumpkinseed sunfish almeida, d., tobes, i., miranda, r., & copp, g. h.
