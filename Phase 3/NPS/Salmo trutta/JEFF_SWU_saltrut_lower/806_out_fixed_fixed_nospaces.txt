mehner, 2012). dvm by cold- water predators has been explained as a function of fitness, namely growth (brett, 1971) and survival (clark & levy, 1988; eggers, 1978), both of which can be strongly tied to depth- related variation in biotic and abiotic factors, including temperature, light, prey availability and predation risk (jobling, 1997; mehner, 2014; werner, gilliam, hall, & mittelbach, 1983). these biotic and abiotic factors interact strongly and can vary with time of day, season, year, location, and among in- dividuals. for example, a study of lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush) indicated individuals that exhibit dvm can maximise growth by mov- ing to depths where foraging rates (related to prey densities and light levels) are optimal (ahrenstorff, hrabik, stockwell, yule, & sass, 2011). in contrast, studies of bull trout (salvelinus_confluentus) have sug- gested smaller individuals dive deeper to avoid predators during the day (gutowsky et al., 2013), whereas larger individuals can maximise growth by following prey that also exhibit dvm (beauchamp & van tassell, 2001). accordingly, the relative influences of growth and sur- vival (i.e. predator avoidance) on depth use by fish in lakes can vary in relation to characteristics of lakes, species or life stages within species. whereas it can be challenging to concurrently assess the complex interactions driving depth use, the application of bioenergetics models allows an evaluation of factors related to growth as drivers of depth use (e.g. brandt et al., 2011). bioenergetics models have been applied to model spatial and temporal variation in factors influencing growth potential in relation to dvm (bevelhimer & adams, 1993; busch, johnson, mehner, & post, 2011; plumb, blanchfield, & abrahams, 30  |   wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:30–43. © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. 2014) and have demonstrated that dvm is a tactic that can maxi- mise growth for animals that (i) follow a prey source exhibiting dvm (hrabik, jensen, martell, walters, & kitchell, 2006), or (ii) maximise bioenergetic efficiency moving between warmer prey- rich water and deeper, cooler water where temperatures are most efficient for growth (brett, 1971). although bioenergetics models do not consider factors related to predator avoidance, these models allow an evaluation of various depth use patterns using growth as a common metric. in this study, we employed a bioenergetics modelling approach to evaluate patterns of dvm in an apex predator (bull trout) living in a deep, seasonally stratified reservoir, ross lake, wa, usa. bull trout commonly exhibit piscivory in lakes and reservoirs (fraley & shepard, 1989; beauchamp & van tassell, 2001), as well as in the lower skagit river below ross dam (lowery & beauchamp, 2015). whereas pre- vious work has emphasised the importance of cold- water prey fishes (e.g. salmonids and cottids), the prey base for bull trout in ross lake is believed to consist almost entirely of recently introduced redside shin- ers (richardsonius balteatus), which are known to congregate in warmer surface waters. temperatures occupied by redside shiners often exceed those required for long- term survival of bull trout (dunham, rieman, & chandler, 2003; selong, mcmahon, zale, & barrows, 2001) or other salmonids (reeves, everest, & hall, 1987). consequently, during the summer growth season, the optimal thermal habitat of these species may be spatially segregated. as such, ross lake offers a unique oppor- tunity to investigate relationships between bull trout and a relatively novel prey species (redside shiner) with contrasting patterns of habitat use (shallow depths, warmer water). we hypothesised these biotic and abiotic factors (temperature, depth, prey availability) should strongly influence growth, and therefore behaviours of bull trout in this sys- tem. data on individual growth and movement patterns are extremely limited in this system, so we applied a bioenergetics approach to eval- uate growth potential associated with dvm and alternative depth use patterns. to this end, we quantified bull trout diets, the distribution of redside shiner prey, and patterns of thermal stratification in sum- mer (july and august). with these data, we parameterised foraging (beauchamp, baldwin, vogel, & gubala, 1999; mazur & beauchamp, 2006) and bioenergetics models (mesa, weiland, christiansen, sauter, & beauchamp, 2013) to evaluate growth associated with constant depth use and dvm to various depths. 1.1 | study site ross lake is the northern- most reservoir on the skagit river in the north cascades national park, washington state, usa (figure 1) with a surface area of 4,700 hectares when full. the lake is oligotrophic and dissolved oxygen levels are near saturated from the surface to the bot- tom. the narrow lake (average width is approximately 2 km) is 30 km long and characterised by a steep rocky western shoreline and a more gradual littoral eastern shoreline. at 489 m in elevation, ross lake is surrounded by protected wilderness areas and steep alpine topog- raphy exceeding 2,500 m. these wilderness areas are dominated by mixed mountain conifer and deciduous forests. most of the tributar- ies draining into the lake originate from glaciers and snowfields in the     |  31 surrounding mountains. construction of ross dam was completed in 1949, and the reservoir was filled in 1952. the reservoir is managed for hydropower generation, recreation and fisheries. lake levels fluctuate seasonally by up to 30 m rising from the lowest levels (90 m max depth) in april, to maximum depth (120 m max depth) in july. summer water surface temperatures range from 14°c in june to 22°c in august. a thermocline develops at a depth of approximately 10 m deep in july. throughout the summer, temperatures at 15 m remain below 16°c dropping to approximately 10°c by 50 m. temperatures in the tribu- taries and the lake from november to may are less than 8°c, and the lake remains isothermic at around 5°c for most of the winter. we fo- cused this study on the southern end of the lake near the mouth of big beaver creek (figure 1), where we observed bull trout to concentrate. ross lake harbours six species of fish including bull trout (the apex predator), dolly varden (salvelinus_malma), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), non- native redside shiner, non- native brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis) and cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus_clarkii). brook_trout and cutthroat trout are present in low numbers. the red- side shiner was introduced to the lake around the year 2000. since then, the redside shiner population has increased substantially. prior to the introduction of the redside shiner, rainbow trout were the most abundant species. observations of bull trout in the skagit river above ross lake suggest a rapid increase in the size and number of bull trout following the introduction of redside shiners (anaka & scott, 2011). bull trout emigrate from tributary streams to forage in ross lake during the winter and spring, with adults returning to spawn in tribu- taries in september through october. given the cold temperatures in the lake and tributaries over the winter, thermal conditions are only amenable for rapid growth of bull trout during the summer (based on laboratory studies of temperature and growth of bull trout; selong et al., 2001; mesa et al., 2013). 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | general approach we focused our analysis on the months of july and august when ross lake is thermally stratified and before bull trout begin moving into trib- utaries to spawn. to determine the growth rates associated with depth use by bull trout in ross lake, we used a foraging model (beauchamp et al., 1999; mazur & beauchamp, 2006) and the wisconsin bioener- getics model (ney 1993, hansen, johnson, schindler, & kitchell, 1997) with parameters modified for bull trout (mesa et al., 2013). the forag- ing model estimated consumption by bull trout based on prey density data collected in the field, estimates of predator swimming speed from previous studies and reaction distances of bull trout calculated from modelled light intensity data. estimated consumption values from the foraging model were input into the bioenergetics model to assess the growth of individuals. these consumption inputs were capped based on the maximum consumption estimates (cmax) in the bioenergetics model. the bioenergetics model parameters are functions of tempera- ture, prey energy density and size of bull trout (hansen et al., 1997). temperature and prey vary as a function of depth; therefore, to model 32  |     ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. figure 1 map of ross lake, north cascades national park, washington. the map shows the entire lake, within the united states border and the cross- hatched area depicts the specific area of the lake where this study took place. big beaver creek is the location on the lake where all of the bull trout in this study were captured and tagged with acoustic tags. across the lake, mcmillan point is the location where the vertical distribution of fish prey was assessed the growth of bull trout in relation to depth use patterns, it was nec- essary to identify (i) the vertical distribution of temperature and prey available in the lake, (ii) the primary prey types consumed by bull trout and (iii) the depths and temperatures used by bull trout. gastric lavage was conducted following the procedures of giles (1980). stomach contents were evacuated into trays and identified. food items identified included insects (identified to class) and fish (identified to family). 2.2 | temperature conditions 2.4 | prey density and distribution temperature sensor arrays (u22 hobo© thermistors, onset computer corporation, bourne, ma, usa) were deployed in two locations on ross lake within 3 km of big beaver creek. these arrays collected hourly temperature data from the surface down to a maximum of 25 m depth at 2- m intervals. additionally, vertical temperature profiles from the surface to 70 m were collected within 1 km of big beaver creek once per month by the north cascades national park. 2.3 | bull trout diets twenty- nine bull trout were captured by angling during daylight hours, in july 2013. each captured bull trout was anesthetised, and we focused on quantifying abundance of redside shiners, as we ini- tially suspected they were a major portion of the diet of bull trout in ross lake (h. anthony, north cascades national park, unpublished data). redside shiners were sampled using minnow trap arrays randomly distributed in a 70 × 30 m grid along the shoreline 2 km from the mouth of big beaver creek (mcmillan point; figure 1). this location is unlikely to be representative of the entire shoreline of ross lake, but based on local angler and our own captures it is a location where bull trout actively forage. preliminary minnow trap sets prior to the initiation of this study indicated that redside shiners were not found in depths below 25 m. accordingly, min- now trap arrays were only placed in depths up to 25 m. each array ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. consisted of a series of traps connected to each other 2 m apart in the vertical dimension. catch per unit effort (cpue) for redside shiners was calculated for each trap in each array by dividing the total number of redside shiners caught by the number of hours the trap was set for. arrays (total 182) were set at all times of the day and night. based on the cpue values, we conservatively approxi- mated densities of redside shiners to input into the foraging model. 2.5 | bull trout tagging and telemetry analysis twelve bull trout (465–600 mm total length; tl) were captured by seattle city light in october 2012 (e. connor, seattle city light, per- sonal communication) near the mouth of big beaver creek via angling. each of these bull trout was anesthetised and surgically implanted with a vemco© v13tp acoustic tag (vemco ltd., halifax, ns, canada). the acoustic tags transmitted the depth and temperature occupied by each bull trout at random intervals between one and three minutes. depth and temperature transmissions were recorded (along with date and time) by vemco© vr2w acoustic receivers (vemco ltd.). fourteen acoustic receivers were located within a 5 km radius of big beaver creek, as all of the bull trout were captured and tagged at the mouth of big beaver creek (figure 1). range tests indicated that 75% of acoustic transmissions were detected by receivers within 500 m of a transmis- sion, so receivers were located approximately 750 to 1,000 m apart to maximise the area of the lake where bull trout could be detected. all of the detections were imported into a microsoft access© (microsoft, seattle, wa, usa) database and filtered by removing all detections from any bull trout that met the following criteria: bull trout that died during the course of the summer (based on visual examina- tion of movement patterns—one bull trout) and bull trout that were not detected frequently enough to observe diel patterns of depth use (fewer than 100 detections in july and august). single detections were filtered out by removing detections that met the following criteria: de- tections prior to 1 july 2013 and after 31 august 2013 (not within the studied timeframe), duplicate detections of bull trout recorded by a second receiver (detections less than 3 minutes apart in time from different receivers) and any isolated detection within a given hour (i.e. 10:00–11:00). after the data set was filtered, detections from three bull trout remained. the filtered data set was grouped by bull trout, date and hour. we followed the methods of gutowsky et al. (2013) to calculate average hourly depth (m) and temperature (°c) of each bull trout. we considered observed movement as dvm for any bull trout that exhibited a daily depth range ≥25 m and a minimum daily depth <25 m. we used this 25 m depth as a threshold for dvm based on the observation that shallow depths (<25 m) corresponded with the depths where redside shiners were observed. 2.6 | foraging model consumption inputs were based on observed diets of bull trout, red- side shiner capture rates and surface light intensity. for the model, we assumed bull trout consumed only redside shiners. preliminary runs of the foraging model with vertical variations in redside shiner densities     |  33 indicated that during the day and twilight even the lowest densities resulted in predation rates greater than the maximum consumption possible in the bioenergetics model (except at 25 m during twilight). at night, the vertical difference in predation rates from varying densities of redside shiners was negligible. accordingly, for this study, we mod- elled a uniform distribution of redside shiners in the upper 25 m over the course of each day and throughout the entire study period. further, we assumed there were no redside shiners below 25 m. we ran forag- ing model simulations using two different densities of redside shiners (0.01 and 0.1 redside shiner·m−3). all of the parameters and values for this model are listed in table a1. these data were input into a foraging model (beauchamp et al., 1999) to calculate encounter rates (er = num- ber of prey fish encountered per bull trout per hour at depth z and diel time period t) as a product of search volume (sv = m3·hr−1) and prey density (pd = prey fish·m−3; estimated from redside shiner cpue). erz,t = svz,t × pdz,t (1) search volume was modelled as a function of reaction distance of predators to their prey (rd = m) and predator swimming speed (ss = m·hr−1). beauchamp et al. (1999) derived swimming speeds from laboratory data (henderson & northcote, 1985) of dolly varden. estimated daytime (7:01–19:00), twilight (6:01–7:00, 19:01–20:00) and night- time (20:01–6:00) swimming speeds were 0.295, 0.235 and 0.040 (m·s−1) respectively. svz,t = π ×rd 2 z,t × sst (2) beauchamp et al. (1999) modelled reaction distance as a function of light intensity (i = lux at depth z and time t) with a maximum reaction distance occurring at light intensities ≥17.8 lx (vogel & beauchamp, 1999). the reaction distance equation was derived from experimental data on adult lake_trout foraging on salmonid prey (5.5–13.8 cm tl) in varied light conditions. the turbidity of ross lake is generally below the clear water threshold of this foraging model (0.3 ntu; c.a. welch, north cascades national park, unpublished data) so this equation did not account for the influence of turbidity on reaction distance. rd = 0.25490 × i0.4747 for iz,t ≤ 17.8 lx rd = rdmax = 1.012 m for iz,t > 17.8 lx z,t (3) daytime and twilight surface light intensities (i0,t = lux at surface at time t) were estimated at hourly intervals on 1 august 2013 (the middle of this study period). this was done using the points solar radiation tool in the spatial analyst version toolbox for arcgis© ver- sion 10.0 (esri, redlands, ca, usa). a range of night- time surface light intensities was modelled to account for lunar cycles. values for starlight and moonlight were estimated to range from 0.002 to 0.25 lx based on light intensity at depth (iz,t), which was calculated as an expo- nential decay from surface light intensity (i0). iz,t = i 0,t × ezk (4) the light extinction coefficient (k) was calculated based on a 10- m secchi disc depth (c.a. welch, unpublished data), assuming that light 34  |     intensity at the secchi disc depth was 10% of the light intensity at the surface (wetzel, 2001). k = ln (10) − ln (100) 10 (5) light- dependent probability of capture to account for prey evasion at higher light levels (mazur & beauchamp, 2006) was used to calcu- late consumption (c = number of prey fish consumed per bull trout per hour at depth z and diel time period t). c = 0.49 × erz,t c = 1.0 × erz,t for iz,t > 17.8 lx for iz,t ≤ 17.8 lx (6) consumption was converted into grams of prey by multiplying number of prey fish captured times 3.16 g (the average weight of a red- side shiner in ross lake in the summer; welch, western washington university m.sc. thesis, 2012). 2.7 | bioenergetics model the wisconsin bioenergetics model (hansen et al., 1997; mesa et al., 2013) calculates the growth of bull trout (g = g·g−1·d−1) as consump- tion (c = g·g−1·d−1 of prey, wet weight) minus respiration (r = resting/ active metabolism + food assimilation costs), egestion (f = g·g−1·d−1) and excretion (u = g·g−1·d−1). the parameters for respiration (r), eges- tion (f) and excretion (u) depend on: the species and size of the fish, the water temperature occupied and the type of prey consumed (hansen et al., 1997; hartman & hayward 2007). g = c − (r + f + u) (7) to apply this bioenergetics model to bull trout specifically, model parameters derived by mesa et al. (2013) in a laboratory study with bull trout were used. this model was coded in r following hansen et al. (1997) and mesa et al. (2013). to assess the growth associated with dvm, where bull trout oc- cupied two different depths (and corresponding temperatures) in a single day, our model used a 12- hour timestep. to calculate growth during july and august using 12- hour timesteps, the daily (24 hr) out- put from the wisconsin bioenergetics model was divided by 2 to cal- culate growth in g·g−1·12 hr−1. four hypothetical bull trout depth use patterns were developed based on data collected in the field and cor- responding growth hypotheses that may be driving such movement patterns (table a2). these growth hypotheses were as follows: maxi- mising spatial overlap with prey (constant depth of 10 m); minimising thermal metabolic expenditures (constant depth of 50 m, 8°c) and two dvm patterns (i) 5 m at night and 50 m during the day and (ii) 15 m at night and 45 m during the day. for the dvm depth use patterns, we assumed that bull trout occupied each depth for 12 hr. the fixed 12- hour depth use pattern was a simplification intended to provide clear insights into the consequences of alternative behaviours and not intended to precisely replicate the complexities of actual behaviours of bull trout. for the constant depth use patterns, we imposed an addi- tional simplification by assuming temperature at a given depth did not change over the course of a day. the growth of a 1,500- g bull trout ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. figure 2 temperature profiles of ross lake collected in the middle of ross lake, between big beaver creek and mcmillan point in 2013. profiles were collected in the middle of each month (13th, 14th, or 15th) except for september and october which were collected on the 23rd and 21st respectively. all profiles were collected within 1 hr of 12:00 exhibiting these hypothetical movement patterns was assessed using the foraging and bioenergetics models. 3 |  results 3.1 | temperature conditions temperatures in ross lake ranged vertically from 4.9 to 16.8°c in july and 5.1 to 20.7°c in august (figure 2). the thermocline was approximately 7 to 20 m deep (16 to 10°c) in july. comparatively, in august the thermocline was approximately 6 to 25 m deep (21 to 11°c). average daily temperature fluctuation at a given depth in the upper 17 m during august was 1.19°c (minimum = 0.17°c, maximum = 3.80°c). 3.2 | bull trout diets during the month of july, 29 bull trout were captured by angling or in tangle nets. capture depth ranged from 3 to 30 m, within 100 m of the shore. capture times ranged from 06:00 to 18:00. less than 10 hr of night fishing was conducted, and no bull trout were captured at night. weights of bull trout captured ranged from 200 to 2,075 g. twenty- one of the 36 stomachs contained food items (nonempty stomachs). redside shiner was the only observed fish prey item and the most common prey item observed.1 only one insect was found from the stomach of a 450- g bull trout. one bull trout was captured (750 g) with 11 fish (29.4 g) in its stomach. nine of these fish (27.2 g) were less than 20% digested and could be identified as redside shiners. this quantity of prey is the maximum amount that a 750- g bull trout can consume in 24 hr indicating the bull trout was feeding to satiation. 3.3 | prey density and distribution the prey density data presented in the results and input into the mod- els (figures 3 and 4) are based on cpue values calculated from min- now trap sets during all times of the day and night. the cpue at each ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal.     |  35 figure 3 the average number of redside shiners captured per hour (cpue) in minnow traps set during day and twilight hours (6:01–20:00;

(b) distribution of redside shiner cpue (number of redside shiners captured in a minnow trap per hour) in relation to depth along the bottom 2 m (sds are listed in table a3). cpue values depicted are from trap arrays set during twilight and daytime hours (6:01–20:00). reaction distances of bull trout (solid lines) during the night, twilight and daytime hours were calculated in the foraging model and are overlaid in this figure. all reaction distances in this figure are based on light values predicted for 1st august. the specific times of the day when light was calculated were as follows: 13:00 (day); the average of dusk (19:00) and dawn (6:00; twilight). night- time light levels were low and values for a full moon are displayed, which represents maximum light possible at night shiners in warm surface water. in contrast, predation rates of redside shiners by bull trout during the night were much lower than digestion rates, except for at the highest modelled prey density in 5 m depth. modelled predation rates of redside shiners by bull trout were greatest during the daytime due to high light intensities and bull trout swimming speeds (table 2). all surface light intensities above 5,630 lx (less than daytime surface light intensities at any date within the study) resulted in maximum bull trout reaction distances in depths less than 25 m. during the daytime in less than 25 m of water, bull trout could capture more redside shiners in 1 hr than could be digested in 12 hr (35 g of prey for a 1,500 g bull trout). predation rates estimated from the vis- ual foraging model indicated that bull trout could consume maximum stomach capacity over relatively short periods of feeding on redside 3.6 | bioenergetics model the depth use pattern that corresponded with the highest modelled growth was a constant depth of 12 and 15 m (figure 7) in july and august respectively. this constant shallow depth use strategy corre- sponded with a gain of 16 g·d−1. in contrast, bull trout occupying only deep water (>50 m) lost weight due to a lack of prey and cold tem- peratures below 8°c. for bull trout exhibiting the two pictured dvm scenarios (table a2), growth was 27%–62% lower than the maximum possible growth. 36  |     ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. figure 5 average hourly depths (m) of bull trout tagged with acoustic tags during the months of july and august 2013. the sizes of each bull trout were measured at the time of tagging (october 2012). acoustic receivers that detected these bull trout were located within a 5- km radius of big beaver creek, their capture location, on ross lake, wa, usa. shaded gray boxes correspond with the depth range of the greatest prey availability based on prey density and light 4 |  discussion growth is often considered a primary driver of fish behaviour due to the strong connections between growth and fitness (brett, 1971). in many lentic systems (lakes and reservoirs), temperature and prey availability vary with depth, and thus, depth use patterns can strongly influence growth. it is unlikely that growth is the only explanation driving depth use, however, because constraints vary among systems and among species due to different environments and life history re- quirements (beauchamp et al., 1999). under some circumstances, for example, survival can strongly influence fitness and therefore can also be a driver of depth use (clark & levy, 1988). whereas the seasonal scope of this study is limited to the thermally stratified months of july and august, we found that bull trout frequently engaged in behaviours that resulted in reduced growth relative to the maximum potential at- tainable in ross lake. in the light of this, it is reasonable to infer that during july and august in ross lake other constraints are operating to limit growth of bull trout in this system. here, we discuss the con- figuration of constraints that may be operating to influence bull trout in ross lake and explore alternative hypotheses that could explain observed patterns of depth use. one of the most important drivers of growth for any predator is availability of prey. bull trout in ross lake were highly piscivorous, preying nearly exclusively on redside shiners, which were more preva- lent in warmer surface layers (figures 5 and 6). such results are not sur- prising as bull trout commonly exhibit piscivory in lakes and reservoirs (fraley & shepard, 1989; beauchamp & van tassell, 2001), as well as in the lower skagit river below ross dam (lowery & beauchamp, 2015). in these studies, warm water prey (i.e. redside shiners or other cyprin- ids) were available, but bull trout consumed primarily cold- water prey species (i.e. kokanee and cottids in lake billy chinook; beauchamp & van tassell, 2001). in contrast, redside shiner are the primary summer prey item for bull trout in ross lake due to a lack of cold- water prey fish alternatives, or because it is more efficient to forage on redside shiner due to their high abundance. although bull trout in this system evolved in a fluvial ecosystem without access to novel prey items now available in ross lake, it appears they are capable of rapid shifts in se- lection of prey and in foraging tactics (e.g. lentic versus lotic; see also beauchamp & van tassell, 2001). in surface waters, average cpue of redside shiners was high, but extremely variable (table a1), suggesting patchy distributions. accordingly, in the foraging model we examined a range of redside shiner densities (1–10 redside shiners per 100 m3) that were conser- vative estimates relative to the high average cpue we observed (>20 redside shiners·hr−1). using these conservative estimates of prey den- sity, foraging models indicated that bull trout could nonetheless easily consume enough prey to reach maximum stomach capacity (more red- side shiners than could be digested in 12 hr) during the daytime near the surface (table 2). this suggests that daytime consumption near the surface is limited by the time required to digest prey (i.e. maximum consumption; elliott & persson, 1978; amundsen & klemetsen, 1988; he & wurtsbaugh, 1993). furthermore, as maximum stomach capacity ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal.     |  37 figure 6 average hourly temperatures (°c) of bull trout tagged with acoustic tags during the months of july and august 2013. the sizes of each bull trout were measured at the time of tagging (october 2012) nearly 9 months before the dates shown in this figure. acoustic receivers that detected these bull trout were located within a 5- km radius of big beaver creek, their capture location, on ross lake, wa. shaded gray boxes represent the depth range with the most efficient temperatures for growth table 1 summary of patterns of depth use by bull trout, patterns including daily vertical migrations and constant use of shallow depths month (fid) number of days with a detection number of days with dvma number of days with a detection ≥40 m number of days with a detection ≤10 m july 1 2 3 august 1 2 3 31 19 5 26 9 16 0 0 2 3 2 12 5 0 2 5 2 13 3 19 1 0 9 3 advm defined as follows: difference in daily minimum and maximum detection is ≥20 m. could be captured in less than 1 hr near the surface during twilight, consumption at night, regardless of low reaction distances and pre- dation rates, can also be limited by digestion rates. this same logic holds for bull trout exhibiting dvm, occupying shallow water during the twilight immediately before a deep water migration (into depths with no prey) during the day. in previous studies, dvm corresponding with maximum growth occurred under two different scenarios: (i) maximising consumption by following prey exhibiting dvm (lake_trout, salvelinus_namaycush siscowet; hrabik et al., 2006) and (ii) minimising metabolic expendi- tures in deeper, cooler water during the day and maximising foraging opportunities near the surface at night (biette & geen, 1980; brett, 1971). a third scenario where dvm is observed in the presence of pre- dation is referred to as the “antipredation window,” where fish avoid predation risks in the well- lit surface water during the day and max- imise foraging benefits at night (clark & levy, 1988; mehner, 2012; scheuerell & schindler, 2003). in each of these scenarios, diverse bi- otic and abiotic conditions can result in similar depth use patterns that maximise growth or survival. for adult bull trout in ross lake in july and august, maximum growth occurs at a constant depth of 15 to 25 m where prey is most abundant and temperatures are most efficient for growth (figure 4). our hypothesis was that bull trout behaviour was 38  |     ﻿eckmaa ﻿et mal. table 2 parameters in the foraging model (surface light intensity, predator swimming speed and redside shiner density) and corresponding redside shiner predation rates (g prey·hr−1) at 5, 15 and 25 m depths. twilight surface light intensity was the average surface light intensity at dusk and dawn on 1 august 2013. a range of night- time surface light intensities were examined to account for variations in the lunar cycle. at all depths examined, daytime light levels on all days of the study exceeded the light intensity threshold (17.8 lx) where maximum bull trout reaction distance occurs. redside shiner densities were conservative estimates based on the average capture rates from the minnow trap arrays (figures 3 and 6) parameters in foraging model predation rates (g prey·hr−1) light at depth (lx) swimming speed (m·s−1) redside shiner density (fish·m−3);

van der kraak & pankhurst, 1997). we studied bull trout in july and august prior to spawning in mid- october, so gametogenesis may have been an im- portant influence on behaviour. it has been well established that tem- perature strongly influences the reproductive development of female fish, ultimately influencing the viability (fertilisation and survival of eggs to the eyed stage) of the eggs (jobling, 1997; pankhurst & king, 2010). specific influences of temperature on reproduction include: (i) timing of ovulation (jobling, johnsen, pettersen, & henderson, 1995) and (ii) provisioning of vitellogenin to eggs (king, pankhurst, watts, & pankhurst, 2003; pankhurst, purser, van der kraak, thomas, & forteath, 1996). ovulation of arctic char held in temperatures from 4 to 20°c four months prior to spawning was examined by jobling et al. (1995). despite being returned to ambient water temperatures 1 month prior to spawning, ovulation was progressively later (up to     |  39 4 weeks delayed) for fish held in warmer temperatures and delayed ovulation has been shown to be detrimental for egg survival (gillet, 1991; king & pankhurst, 2000). provisioning of vitellogenin to eggs is also important for survival (campbell, 1994), and vitellogenin syn- thesis has been shown to be inhibited by warmer temperatures (rain- bow trout, pankhurst et al., 1996; atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), king et al., 2003). much less research has been conducted examining the influence of temperature on male reproductive development, but tem- perature may influence spermatogenesis (sperm development) as well (hokanson, mccormick, jones, & tucker, 1973; taranger et al., 2003). temperature, however, is not the only variable influencing reproduc- tive development. gametogenesis is an energetically demanding pro- cess dependent on growth. if there is a vertical segregation between depths suitable for growth and gametogenesis, dvm may be a be- haviour driven by growth and gametogenesis. we have framed our hypotheses for depth use by bull trout in the general context of fitness- related drivers, such as growth, survival and reproduction, but the importance of these can be modified by a host of state- dependent factors, including size, sex and reproductive status. we were not able to consider these in this study, but their influences merit some discussion in the light of direction for future studies. size is directly related to predation risk because smaller bull trout are more susceptible to predation. if predation risk is a primary driver of depth use, we may expect smaller bull trout to dive to deeper depths to avoid predators (gutowsky et al., 2013). sex may be an important factor as egg and sperm development may be differentially influenced by tem- perature and growth. sperm development occurs over a shorter time period before reproduction and is much less energetically demanding than egg development. somatic growth, however, can be important for males competing for access to females during reproduction (quinn, 2005). reproductive status may also result in predictable differences in depth use by bull trout. for immature individuals or mature individuals that forgo spawning in a given year (johnston & post, 2009; rideout & tomkiewicz, 2011), constraints related to gametogenesis may not be important, and if true, such individuals may be less likely to exhibit dvm as hypothesised herein. differences in the depth use by spawn- ing and nonspawning adults may not arise however if gametogenesis proceeds throughout the summer and the decision to spawn or skip spawning does not occur until early in the fall (rideout & tomkiewicz, 2011). in conclusion, we found that a bioenergetics approach provided a useful, mechanistic assessment of alternative patterns of depth use by bull trout. certainly, more information on individual movements would allow us to better understand how bull trout actually use the lake environment, but the scenarios we simulated allowed us to ex- plore the potential fitness consequences of adopting a range of ob- served behaviours and how they contrasted with alternative suites of behaviours. in other words, simulating behaviours that are not ex- hibited by fish in nature can help us to understand why we observe only a subset of possible patterns. ultimately, when resources and logistics permit, approaches that combine evaluations of individual movement with mechanistic (i.e. bioenergetics) models will provide more detailed insights (e.g. hanson, beauchamp, & baldwin, 2013). in 40  |     our experience, studies of how fish move (e.g. gowan, young, fausch, & riley, 1994) are much more prevalent that studies of why fish move, and model- based approaches to evaluating fish movements (e.g. hughes & grand, 2000; railsback & harvey, 2002) can provide a stronger process- based foundation for understanding depth use and other movement behaviours. acknowledgements we thank seattle city light (scl) and the forest service for fund- ing this project. further financial and in- kind support was provided by the north cascades national park, flyfishers of oregon, the oregon chapter of the american fisheries society and the neil armantrout memorial scholarships. none of the authors have any potential sources of conflict of interest. this work was authorised by the oregon state university institutional animal care and use committee (permit #4462) and a permit from u.s. fish and wildlife service. brooke bannerman, matt mesa, john plumb, john beeman, dale mccullough, erin lowery, dave hockman- wert, ivan arismendi, kelly christiansen and kathryn ronnenberg provided assistance with data collection and analysis. adam hanson developed the r code to assess the bioenergetics of bull trout. use of trade or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and does not constitute endorsement of any product or service by the u.s. government. endnote 1 see video of ross lake bull trout foraging on redside shiners in supplemen- tary materials. references ahrenstorff, t. d., hrabik, t. r., stockwell, j. d., yule, d. l., & sass, g. g.
