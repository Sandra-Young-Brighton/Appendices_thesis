stearns 1992). there are variations in age at maturity among individuals within or between populations (wootton 1973; pitt 1975; mckenzie et al. 1983). such variations result from the density of individuals (goto 1987), predation pressure (johnson & belk 1999) or the abundance of food resources (fox 1978). in some ﬁshes, gobies (gobiidae) are generally nest spawners (balon 1975), and exhibit paternal care of eggs (thre- sher 1984). this family is one of the largest among ﬁshes, containing >2000 species inhabiting a wide variety of habitats (nelson 1994). for some male gobies nest sites can be a crucial resource for reproduction, because males without nests cannot reproduce (fors- gren et al. 1996), but males with a sneaker tactic do not need to possess nest sites (e.g., svensson et al. 1998). males compete intensively for nest sites and large dominant males usually monopolise them, especially when sites are in short supply (lugil et al. 1992; forsgren et al. 1996; takahashi et al. 2001). if posses- sion of nest sites is dependent on site abundance, nest site availability should greatly inﬂuence growth patterns and the timing of maturity in males. although there have been some studies to investigate the relationship between nest availability and sexual selection (e.g., forsgren et al. 1996) or mating system (e.g., mousseau & collins 1987), as far as i know the relationship between availability of nest sites and male age at maturity has not been previously investigated. tridentiger brevispinis is a small goby (ca. 8 cm) that inhabits the lower to middle reaches of rivers and doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00260.x 71 takahashi lake shores throughout japan. the body colouration of both sexes is blackish with many small white spots the entire body. tridentiger brevispinis are over sexually dimorphic; males have a longer ﬁrst dorsal ﬁn than females (mashiko & yamane 1993). this goby has a polygamous mating system (kishi 1979; mashiko & yamane 1993), and the presence of sneakers cannot be observed. during the breeding period (mid-may to late august), females spawn repeatedly (kishi 1979). after a female deposits her clutch of eggs in a single layer on the ceiling of the nest, a male attends the egg mass and guards against egg predators until hatching (ca. 1 week). after hatching, males abandon their nests and do not reuse nest sites. the larvae have a 1-month planktonic stage (kawanabe et al. 2001). in the present study, the relationships between nest site availability and timing of maturity of males in two t. brevispinis populations that differ in abundance of potential nest sites in lake biwa in central japan were investigated. this lake, which is an ancient tectonic lake and the largest in japan, has wide variations in the shoreline substrate, ranging from rocky to sandy (kitazawa 1991). such variations in substrate result in local difference of the abundance of stones used as nest sites, and thereby may potentially inﬂuence patterns of life-history traits in t. brevispinis males. materials and methods study area this study was conducted at the ohmi-maiko (35°14¢n 135°57¢e) and minamihama shorelines (35°23¢n 136°13¢e) of lake biwa. the distance between minamihama and ohmi-maiko is about 30 km. the water depths at both study sites are nearly equal and range from 30 to 200 cm. the substrate at ohmi-maiko consists of sand and a few pebbles, while the minam- ihama is sand with many pebbles and cobbles. lake biwa is inhabited by four gobiid species, including t. brevispinis, gymnogobius isaza, rhinogobius sp. or (orange colour type; kawanabe et al. 2001) and rhinogobius sp. bw (lake biwa type; takahashi & okazaki 2002). although all these gobies utilise stones as nest sites, there is no competition for nest sites among them due to differences in timing of the breeding season (g. isaza: miura 1996) or the characteristics of stones utilised as nests (rhinogobius sp. or and rhinogobius sp. bw: d. takahashi, personal observations). methods to assess the abundance of potential available nest sites, counted within 20 quadrats (50 · 50 cm), which were randomly placed at both stones were 72 ohmi-maiko and minamihama. because nest stones used by males were always over 15 cm along their long axis and unburied, stones meeting this criteria were counted as potential available nest sites. furthermore, to identify the density of t. brevispinis, i conducted censuses in a quadrat (20 · 1 m) on the shores of both the study sites from 25 june to 9 august. and ﬁve small intervals in a quadrat to estimate competition for nest sites in the ﬁeld, artiﬁcial nest sites were used at both ohmi-maiko and minamihama from 9 june to 20 july 2003. at both sites, ﬁve large (23 · 23 · 2.5 cm3), ﬁve medium (23 · 11 · 2.5 cm3) (11 · 11 · 2.5 cm3) clay tiles were placed at approximately (22.5 · 5 m2). at regular approximately 2-day intervals, tiles were overturned and checked for males guarding egg masses under them. males were not unduly disturbed by this treatment and continued guarding their egg masses until hatching. whether the same males were under the tiles was estimated by body size, although after hatching, males never returned to the same tiles. only tiles with both males and egg masses were regarded as utilised by males for nest sites. monthly sampling at both ohmi-maiko and minam- ihama, from may to august 2002, was conducted to investigate body length frequency, age structure of the population and age at maturity of males. approxi- mately 50 males per month from each site were (5 · 5 mm2 randomly collected with a hand net mesh), and ﬁxed in 10% formalin. after measurements of the total length (tl) to the nearest 0.1 mm and wet body weight (bw) to the nearest 1 mg, specimens were dissected and the gonads removed and weighed (gw) to the nearest 1 mg. to examine whether males were mature, the gonadosomatic index (gsi) was calculated (gsi = gw · 100 ⁄ bw). following mas- hiko & yamane (1993), i classiﬁed mature (gsi ‡0.6) and immature males (gsi £0.4) by gsi. specimens with gsi values intermediate between those denoting maturity and immaturity (23 and 14 males in ohmi- maiko and minamihama, respectively) were excluded from analyses related to maturity. to identify the density of nest sites utilised by males, the number of nests where males guarded their egg masses near the monthly sampling area at both ohmi- maiko and minamihama were counted once every ca. 10 days from may to august 2003. on each day of the study, a quadrat (5 · 5 m2) was randomly placed along the shore, and all nests in the quadrat were counted. to ﬁnd males guarding egg masses, stones at both study sites were overturned from may to august 2003. when an egg mass was found, the guarding male was captured and the outline of the egg mass sketched on a plastic sheet. because the area (cm2) of each egg mass (ae) was highly correlated with the total number of eggs (ne) (ne = 176.28 · ae, r = 0.95, p < 0.0001, n = 13), the latter was estimated from the former. tl of guarding males was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm. the age of specimens was estimated from their scales. the scales under the pectoral ﬁns were used for the age determination; scales from this position have a clear circular pattern and can readily be read. like the freshwater goby rhinogobius brunneus (sawara 1978), the circuli of t. brevispinis do not necessarily show an arrangement with uniform spaces upon microscopic examination; around the focus of scales the circuli are always broadly spaced, and this broad circuli zone is followed by a narrow circuli zone, then alternated by another broad circuli zone and so on. these narrow and broad circuli zones correspond to the nongrowing and growing seasons, respectively. because the narrow circuli zone was always formed in winter (november to march; fig. 1), the number of narrow zones within scales was determined to represent specimen age. the males aged from scales were grouped into cohorts (cassie 1954), assuming the size-frequency distribu- tion of ﬁsh of the same age followed a normal distribution. the chi-squared test for goodness of ﬁt was used to compare the calculated distribution to the observed one. this indicated that 60 and 72 mm tl in ohmi-maiko or 54 and 68 mm tl in minamihama were the boundary sizes between ages 1–2 and 2–3, 2 = 12.90, p > 0.9, respectively (ohmi-maiko; v28 minamihama; v30 2 = 16.32, p > 0.9; fig. 2). data sets in which the assumption of normality was violated were log transformed for statistical analysis. in the analysis of the artiﬁcial nest experiment, the total number of males guarding egg masses per tile were counted and compared with the mean number of males between the two sites and among the three tile sizes. to identify differences in relationships between male body size and mating success between ohmi- maiko and minamihama, the equality of slopes of the regression lines between the two sites was tested (sokal & rohlf 1995). results the abundance of potential nest sites differed consid- erably between the two populations. at ohmi-maiko, a fig. 1. normal scales under the pectoral ﬁns of tridentiger brevispinis in ohmi- maiko. the total length, the date of collec- tion and the ages determined are (a) 34.9 mm;

(two-way anova, in both ohmi-maiko and minamihama, male body size was signiﬁcantly positively correlated with the number (ohmi-maiko: y = 3.21x ) 2.21, r = 0.67, p < 0.0001, n = 44, nests eggs of in 74 s g g e f o r e b m u n  e h t ) 3 0 1 x ( s e a m y b l  d e d r a u g 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 tl (mm) fig. 3. relationship between male tridentiger brevispinis total length (tl) and the number of eggs in nests at ohmi-maiko (closed circle and dashed line) and minamihama (open circles and bold line) in. sample sizes of ohmi-maiko and minamihama are 44 and 21, respectively. minamihama: y = 2.57x ) 1.08, r = 0.69, p < 0.001, n = 21; fig. 3). the slope of the regression line between male tl and the number of eggs in the nest was larger at ohmi-maiko than at minamihama (tests for equality of slopes of regression lines, p < 0.001). discussion in the present study, there were fewer potential nest sites at ohmi-maiko than at minamihama. artiﬁcial nest site experiments showed that the proportion of tiles used as nests was greater in ohmi-maiko than in minamihama. these results suggest that there is a shortage of nest sites at ohmi-maiko. in the experi- ment with artiﬁcial nest sites, at both ohmi-maiko and minamihama, the frequency of utilisation of small tiles was lower than that of large or medium tiles, probably indicating that small tiles are not suitable for nest sites. for example, in some nest spawning ﬁshes, males prefer larger nest sites because such nest sites increase their reproductive success (lindstro¨m 1988; takahashi et al. 2001; takahashi & kohda 2002). there was a clear difference in age at maturity in males between the two populations of t. brevispinis. at ohmi-maiko, where nest sites were scarce, males were generally mature at age 3, whereas at minam- ihama, where nest sites are abundant, most males matured at age 1. in each population, the age structure of mature males corresponded with that of guarding males. why are there differences in the timing of maturity of males between ohmi-maiko and minamihama? life-history characteristics of ﬁshes are inﬂuenced by a variety of environmental factors, such as productiv- ity of food organisms (fox 1978) or predation pressure (johnson & belk 1999). in the present study, whether these two factors inﬂuenced the timing of maturity of males is unknown. if such factors at ohmi-maiko and minamihama greatly differ, one would expect differ- ences in age at maturity in both males and females between the two sites. however, many females at age 1 in both ohmi-maiko (81.8%, n = 11) and minam- ihama (93.8%, n = 16) have mature gonads (i.e., gsi ‡4.0; mashiko & yamane 1993) (fisher’s exact probability test, p > 0.5; d. takahashi, personal observations). this suggests that male-speciﬁc factors cause differences in timing of male maturity between the two sites. including t. brevispinis, as nest sites are crucial resources for reproduction in males of many gobies, males compete vigorously for nest sites when they are in short supply (lugil et al. 1992). therefore, nest site availability strongly affects the degree of male–male competition (forsgren et al. 1996). there was a shortage of nest sites at ohmi-maiko, suggesting that male–male competition for nest sites is greater here than at minamihama. in many ﬁshes, larger males have an advantage in intrasexual competition (mas- hiko 1998; takahashi et al. 2001). in the present study, older males were larger in both ohmi-maiko and minamihama. at ohmi-maiko, only older and larger males might obtain nest sites and mate with females, as male–male competition is intense as a result of nest site shortage. conversely, at minamihama where nest sites are abundant and male–male competition is weak, not only dominant older and larger males but also subdominant younger and smaller individuals would be able to acquire nest sites and reproduce. the reason for the difference in the age of maturity of males between the two populations may be explained by both male–male competition and female mate choice. at both ohmi-maiko and minamihama, there were positive correlations between male body size and male mating success. it is likely that, as in many ﬁshes (downhower & brown 1980; bisazza & marconato 1988; hastings 1988a,b; gronell 1989; forsgren 1992), females of t. brevispinis preferentially mate with large males. the slope of the regression line between male size and the number of eggs per nest at ohmi-maiko was greater than that at minamihama. this means that females at ohmi-maiko spawn with large males more frequently than at minamihama. in other words, female preference for large males might be stronger in ohmi-maiko than in minamihama. forsgren et al. (1996) reported that in a sand goby, mate availability inﬂuencing patterns of female mate choice is partly dependent on nest site availability. as in the sand goby (forsgren et al. 1996), sexual selection will work in at least two steps in t. brevisp- inis; ﬁrst, there is male–male competition for nest sites, with subsequent female mate choice among these nesting males. hence, nest-holding males reﬂect the results of male–male competition, and nesting males age at maturity of freshwater goby with egg masses are determined through female mate choice. in this study, nest-holding males and nesting males with egg masses were not individually exam- ined, because it could not be determined whether males under stones but without egg masses were nesting males or merely ﬁsh hiding under stones. thus, this study might under- or overestimate the effects of male–male competition or female mate choice on male mating success. ingenious laboratory experiments that can accurately identify the nest- holding males are needed to reveal the effects of both male–male competition and female mate choice. life-history theory predicts that individuals should allocate time and resources to growth or reproduction to maximise the number of offspring produced in the lifetime of the individual under the prevailing envi- ronmental conditions (wootton 1998). if only large males can defend nest sites and mate with females when there is a shortage of nest sites, young males should invest energy in growth and not reproduction, and should delay the timing of maturity until they achieve a body size at which they are able to secure nest sites. although the growth rates of male t. bre- vispinis through the year are unclear, at ohmi-maiko the body size of males in all age cohorts increased over the breeding period, while at minamihama only males at age 1 increased in size over the breeding period. such differences in the changes of body size between ohmi-maiko and minamihama are consistent with the interpretation of young males at the former site investing their energy in growth and those at the latter in reproduction. to varying environmental is the difference in age of maturity in males between the two sites ﬁxed genetically or does it represent phenotypic plasticity? whether such chan- ges in life-history traits is genetically or environmen- tally induced is often difﬁcult to determine in a natural population because genetic responses could easily be masked by the plasticity of phenotypic responses conditions (rochet et al. 2000). it is unclear whether there are genetic differences between the two populations. in the freshwater gobies, rhinogobius sp. or and rhinogobius sp. bw, there are no genetic differences among populations in lake biwa, probably due to wide dispersal of their planktonic larvae (takahashi & ohara 2004). if, like these rhinogobius species, t. brevispinis is also widely distributed along shore- lines at the end of the planktonic larval period, there are unlikely to be genetic differences among popu- lations, and the difference in age at maturity of males between the ohmi-maiko and minamihama popula- tions probably results from plasticity of life-history traits. further studies on sensitive dna markers or cross-fostering experiments are necessary to reveal whether the difference in age of maturity of males 75 takahashi between the two sites is ﬁxed genetically or repre- sents phenotypic plasticity. the present study clearly showed that there is intraspeciﬁc variation in the timing of maturity in males of t. brevispinis, and that the shortage of nest sites enhances large body size advantage for male reproductive success probably through male–male competition for nest sites and female mate choice for larger mates. the variation in age at maturity of males results from the difference of the large size advantage in relation to nest site abundance. this study indicates that in nest spawners, the availability of nest sites should strongly affect life-history traits through sexual selection. individual acknowledgements i am grateful to members of laboratory of animal ecology, faculty of science, kyoto university. also, i thank members of laboratory of animal sociology, faculty of science, osaka city university, and a. hattori, faculty of liberal arts and education, shiga university. i would also like to thank c. smith, department of biology, university of leicester, for his kind assistance with english in the manuscript, and three anonymous reviewers for useful comments. this work was partly supported ﬁnancially by jsps research fellowships for young scientists. references balon, e.k. 1975. reproductive guilds of ﬁshes: a proposal and deﬁnition. journal of the fisheries research board of canada 32: 821–864. bisazza, a. & marconato, a. 1988. female mate choice, male– male competition and parental care in the river bullhead, cottus gobio l.
