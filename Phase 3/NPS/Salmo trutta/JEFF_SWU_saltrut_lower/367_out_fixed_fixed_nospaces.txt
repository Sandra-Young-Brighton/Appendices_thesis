western mosquitoﬁsh, gambusia afﬁnis, mills et al. 2004; smallmouth bass, micropterus dolomieu, vander zanden & rasmussen 1999). environmental changes resulting from altered ecosystems can gener- ate phenotypically plastic responses or can select for genetically based adaptive responses (reznick et al. 1996; stockwell & vinyard 2000; pigliucci 2001; crispo et al. 2010). multiple studies have assessed the implications of predator-induced plasticity (reviewed in benard 2004) as well as plasticity because of limitations on resource availability and habitat degra- dation (bronikowski & arnold 1999; walsh & reznick 2009). similarly, selective effects of predation and resource availability have been well documented (macarthur & wilson 1967; pianka 1970; reznick et al. 1996, 2002, 2008; gordon et al. 2009). how- ever, the effects of predation environment (presence of an introduced predator) and habitat degradation are 102 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00465.x rarely independent (miller et al. 1989; allan & flecker 1993); therefore, the interaction between the two warrants further study to determine how organ- isms respond to multiple anthropogenic effects. prey exhibit predator-induced plastic responses in both growth and reproduction, but the direction and magnitude of the resulting effects depend on the balance between lethal and nonlethal pathways (fraser & gilliam 1992; mills et al. 2004). first, we might expect a density-dependent (lethal) response in which predators decrease prey density and increase per capita resource availability by reducing competition (fraser & gilliam 1992; wooten 1994; reznick et al. 2001). this effect would lead to an increase in both growth and reproduction. second, the predator could induce a density-independent response, because predator presence decreases prey movement, leading to a decrease in the foraging efﬁciency of the prey (werner & gilliam 1984; abrams 1997; nannini & belk 2006; holomuzki et al. 2010). this effect would lead to a decrease in both growth and reproduction. third, prey may respond directly to changes in mortality rates by making adaptive shifts in reproduc- tion. in response to higher mortality rates, we would expect organisms to invest the expense of growth rates (gadgil & bossert 1970; law 1979; michod 1979; reznick et al. 1996). in reproduction at (nonlethal) in addition to effects of predators, prey respond to changes in habitat quality, and realised growth and reproduction by individuals again depends on the balance among potentially opposing effects. habitat degradation from anthropogenic disturbance can take many forms. in streams of western north america, the main characteristics of low-quality habitat are (i) habitat homogeneity resulting from channelization (including mainly shallow, uniform depths and lack of typical refuge habitats such as backwaters and side channels; gore & shields 1995; ellsworth 2003), (ii) altered hydrographs, especially during the low-water season resulting from water diversion (minckley & douglas 1991; rader & belish 1999), and (iii) poor water quality (low dissolved oxygen, increased salin- ity, and high nutrient input) resulting from livestock grazing in riparian areas and irrigation of desert soils (carveth et al. 2006; magner et al. 2008; fischer et al. 2010). taken together these effects generate lower levels of resource availability (rader & belish 1999; fischer et al. 2010) and higher stress environments for stream ﬁshes compared to unaltered habitats (carveth et al. 2006). as a response to lowered resource availability in degraded habitats, both growth and reproduction of stream ﬁshes will be lower than in high-quality habitats. similarly, when environmental conditions (i.e., salinity, ﬂow rate, ph, dissolved oxygen, etc.) shift outside of the normal range, costs of activity increase, and thus growth and reproduction interacting effects on stream ﬁsh decline. for example, ﬁsh in poor-quality habitats must move over larger areas to acquire necessary resources or ﬁnd favourable habitats compared to ﬁsh in high-quality habitats (aparicio & de sostoa 1999; kahler et al. 2001; bowler & benton 2005). increased mobility of ﬁsh in poor-quality habitats increases energetic demands and consequently can reduce growth. reduced habitat quality can also indirectly affect growth and reproduction by increasing stress and energy demands, resulting in overall decreased growth rates (quist & guy 2001; arendt & reznick 2005; aedo et al. 2009). if variation in habitat quality affects mortality rates over many generations, then we would expect a similar to that described for adaptive life-history responses to pres- ence of predators (i.e., greater reproductive investment at the expense of growth). selective effect the independent effects of introduced predators and habitat degradation on native ﬁsh growth and fecun- dity can be used to generate predictions about how these two effects will interact. in high-quality habitats with predators present, if lethal effects dominate, we expect lower abundances of native ﬁsh, resulting in higher per capita availability of resources leading to increased growth and allocation to reproduction. if nonlethal effects dominate and densities remain unchanged, we expect lower growth rates and repro- duction because density is negatively affecting growth. in low-quality habitats, both increased mobility and lack of refuge habitats (as a consequence of habitat homogeneity) increase vulnerability of ﬁshes to pre- dation. therefore, nonlethal effects that depend on prey being able to avoid predation by changing habitat use will be constrained, and lethal effects will be the main determinant of patterns of growth and reproduc- tion. we expect slightly higher growth in the poor quality, predator environment than in the poor quality, nonpredator environment because of the lethal effect of predators on density of prey. given these predic- tions and assuming lethal effects predominate, prey in the high-quality, predator environment should exhibit the highest growth rates and highest reproduction. conversely, prey in the low-quality, nonpredator environment should exhibit the lowest growth rates and lowest reproduction. the other two combinations (high-quality nonpredator and low-quality predator) should be intermediate. the southern leatherside chub (lepidomeda aliciae) provides a good species to study the interaction of an introduced predator and habitat quality on growth and reproduction. the southern leatherside chub is a small desert ﬁsh native to streams and small rivers in the eastern bonneville basin in utah, usa (wilson & belk 2001; johnson et al. 2004). the distributional range of this species has declined by 42%, apparently in response to habitat degradation and introduction of 103 billman et al. in the full brown_trout (wilson & belk 2001; belk & johnson 2007). consequently, southern leatherside chub pop- ulations occur range of combinations available for the interaction of these two effects. to test the interaction of predator environment and habitat quality, we quantiﬁed growth and reproduction in adult southern leatherside chub from four streams in a complete two-factor crossed design. methods study sites we sampled populations of southern leatherside chub in four streams in central utah (wilson & belk 2001; rasmussen 2010) that represent a complete two-factor cross of predation environment and habitat quality (table 1). the four streams were salina creek (38°54¢ 25¢¢n, 111°41¢ 36¢¢w) that represents a high-quality, nonpredator environment; lost creek (38°50¢ 53¢¢n, 111°51¢ 78¢¢w) that represents a high-quality, predator environment; san pitch river (39°08¢ 57¢¢n, 111°45¢ 53¢¢w) represents a low-quality, nonpredator environment; and soldier creek (38°58¢ 48¢¢n, 111°21¢ 13¢¢w) that represents a low-quality, predator environment (fig. 1; wilson & belk 2001; rasmussen 2010). that anthropogenic disturbances resulting in habitat degradation (i.e., habitat homogeneity, altered hydro- graphs and poor water quality) have affected each of the four study streams (like most streams in western north america; minckley & douglas 1991); however, the degree to which each of these streams has been affected varies dramatically. the two streams charac- terised as high quality, salina creek and lost creek, have had relatively low levels of impact; and the two streams characterised as low quality, soldier creek and san pitch river, have experienced some combi- nation of all three types of impacts. both high-quality streams have comparatively high habitat heterogeneity as evidenced by depth variation (salina creek depth range = 0.25–1.5 m; lost creek depth range = 0.30– 2.0 m; soldier creek depth range = 0.2–0.5 m; san pitch river depth range = 0.15–0.5 m) and presence of off-channel habitats important to native ﬁshes (both high-quality streams have backwaters and side chan- nels, which are absent in low-quality streams). soldier creek has been channelized in the segment which we sampled, but none of the other streams have. alter- ation of hydrograph has been a major impact on the san pitch river and less important on the other three streams. the san pitch river has an irrigation reservoir located upstream of our sample site and multiple irrigation diversions throughout the lower reach such that the stream a few kilometres below the sample site is completely dry in summer months (july–september) during most years. spring runoff is dampened in many years and ﬂow during the summer is unnaturally low. this altered hydrograph contributes to channel homogeneity as explained earlier. water quality as measured by salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrient load is especially poor in the san pitch river. the altered hydrograph (lack of ﬂushing ﬂows and irrigation return ﬂows from low summer ﬂows), surrounding arid soils (contributing to increased salinity) and heavy livestock use of the riparian areas all contribute to poor water quality in this stream compared to the other three. temperatures measured during the spring spawning period also reﬂect this difference among streams (table 1). in addition to stream characteristics, we can use information about stream ﬁsh abundance and move- ment to characterise habitat quality. densities of southern leatherside chub and dace species are highest in salina creek, intermediate in lost creek and san pitch river and lowest in soldier creek (rasmussen 2010). these patterns suggest similar effects of individual anthropogenic factors on ﬁsh densities, and an interacting, or greater, effect on ﬁsh densities when combined. movement patterns are a second indicator of habitat quality. southern leatherside chub prefer pool habitats (wilson & belk 2001) and exhibit high residency and low movement in streams with heterogeneous habitats that include pools (95% of recaptures within 100 m of tagging location; rasmus- sen 2010). in contrast, southern leatherside chub exhibit low residency and high movement in streams with homogeneous habitat with little pool habitat present (almost 100% turnover in 200 m sampling reach in 1 year; rasmussen 2010). these behavioural responses to habitat quality (i.e., high residency vs. high movement in high vs. low-quality habitats) are consistent with responses in other stream ﬁshes (aparicio & de sostoa 1999; gilliam & fraser table 1. descriptive characteristics of four streams in central utah, and date and sample size of southern leatherside chub collected from each stream in 2009. stream quality predator salina creek lost creek san pitch river soldier creek high high low low no yes no yes elevation (m) gradient (%) 1805 1746 1584 1723 1.67 1.83 0.45 1.32 date collected 21 may 21 may 2 june 28 may temperature (°c) individuals collected 12.0 14.6 17.5 12.3 51 52 48 53 104 interacting effects on stream ﬁsh fig. 1. location of four streams in central utah from which southern leatherside chub were collected in 2009. triangles indicate location sampled on each stream. 2001; kahler et al. 2001; bowler & benton 2005). whether we use habitat characteristics or indicators from the southern leatherside chub populations’ dynamics, habitat quality is lower in soldier creek and san pitch river compared to salina creek and lost creek. we deﬁne a predator environment as one with introduced brown_trout co-occurring with southern leatherside chub. brown_trout were ﬁrst introduced into utah around 1900 and were stocked regularly during the early 1900s into most of utah’s trout streams (sigler & miller 1963). brown_trout are at least partially piscivorous by 30 cm total length (tl) with some individuals beginning the shift to piscivory at smaller sizes (hyvarinen & huusko 2006). because brown_trout can consume prey ﬁsh that are 40% their body length, southern leatherside chub of all ages are susceptible to predation by even the smallest of piscivorous brown_trout and therefore unable to escape predation by increasing growth rates. as a result, predation by brown_trout resulted in higher mortality rates for juvenile (age-1) and adult (age-2+) southern leatherside chub in lost creek than in salina creek (m. belk, unpublished manuscript). however, age-0 southern leatherside chub experienced lower mortality rates in lost creek than those in salina creek, indicating that either predation on small (6–30 mm tl; rasmussen 2010) southern leatherside chub is much less than older ﬁsh, or age-0 ﬁsh beneﬁt from reduced competition with young-of-year native ﬁshes. similar comparisons have not been made for soldier creek and san pitch river because the low residency and high movement exhibited by southern leatherside chub in low-quality streams results in poor recapture probability that prohibit reliable estimates of survival (rasmussen 2010). the density of brown_trout is greater in lost creek than in soldier creek (m. belk, unpublished data); however, we expected these density differences given the differences in habitat quality between the streams. we assume that brown_trout will elicit a response in growth and reproduction of southern leatherside chub consistent with the balance of lethal and nonlethal effects in each stream despite the density differences. fish communities in each stream are composed of similar native species and differ in nonnative species. 105 billman et al. in addition to southern leatherside chub, salina creek, lost creek and san pitch river each have speckled dace (rhinichthys osculus), mountain sucker (cato- stomus platyrhanchus) and mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi). soldier creek also has mountain sucker and longnose dace (rhinichthys mottled sculpin, but cataractae) are present rather than speckled dace. these native species that occur sympatrically with southern leatherside chub are all benthic species, unlike southern leatherside chub which is a midwater species. southern leatherside chub are macroinverte- brate generalists, feeding on aquatic insects and crustaceans in the drift and associated with the benthos, and terrestrial insects (bell & belk 2004). thus, there is some diet overlap (benthic macroinver- tebrates) between southern leatherside chub and the other native species in these streams, but the overlap is only for a portion of the total diet of southern leatherside chub. besides brown_trout, additional nonnative species were only found in san pitch river in low densities: fathead minnow (pimephales prom- elas) and common carp (cyprinus carpio). other than the presence of brown_trout, there are no consistent differences in ﬁsh community that would likely affect growth and reproduction of southern leatherside chub. sampling and data collection (table 1) of individuals reproductive we sampled ﬁsh from each of the four locations between 21 may and 2 june 2009 (table 1). this time period corresponds to the beginning of the spawning season (johnson et al. 1995). we collected about 50 size (sl > 60 mm; johnson et al. 1995) by electroshock- ing from each site. we sampled a length of reach in each stream necessary to obtain the targeted sample size (salina creek – 75 m; lost creek – 450 m; san pitch river – 320 m; soldier creek – 530 m). fish were euthanized by overdose of ms-222, placed on ice and transported to brigham young university (byu) where they were stored frozen at )80 °c until they were dissected. prior to dissection, the ﬁsh were thawed, blotted dry and the wet mass of the ﬁsh was measured to the nearest 0.1 mg. the standard length of each ﬁsh was measured to the nearest millimetre. gonads and viscera were removed from each ﬁsh, and somatic wet mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 mg. otoliths were removed, and the ﬁsh were ﬁxed in 10% formalin and then stored in 70% ethanol. each ﬁsh was given an accession number for archiving into the ﬁsh collection at the monte l. bean life science museum at byu. we determined growth and size-at-age from annuli recorded on otoliths. the otoliths were ground to a thin section, and digital pictures were taken using a digital camera ﬁtted to a dissecting microscope. for details of 106 annulus structure and validation for southern leather- side chub, see johnson et al. (1995). age was determined independently by two people counting opaque rings on the otoliths. when in disagreement, the two observers examined the otolith together to reconcile the age, and if necessary, a third individual was consulted. however, otoliths were excluded from analysis of growth if age remained inconclusive (n = 5 of 212). annual growth increments were measured along the longest axis of the otolith using the program tpsdig2 (rohlf 2008). size-at-age was back-calculated from otoliths using a modiﬁed fraser–lee formula (see johnson et al. 1995); however, length at birth was changed to 6 mm (billman et al. 2008). we estimated the age-at-maturity for males and females as the youngest reproductively mature indi- vidual sampled from each stream. reproductive allo- cation was quantiﬁed for both sexes by measuring the wet mass of gonads to the nearest 0.1 mg. additional reproductive traits were quantiﬁed for females. the stage of ovary development was determined according to classiﬁcations by heins & rabito (1986). total number of oocytes in ovaries was estimated by counting the number of oocytes in three subsamples. for each subsample, separate counts were made for both maturing oocytes and larger, mature oocytes. additionally, oocyte diameter of maturing and mature oocytes was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm using tpsdig2 (rohlf 2008) from digital images obtained from a digital camera attached to a dissecting scope. fecundity for each female was estimated from both clutch size (number of larger, mature oocytes) and total oocytes (maturing and mature oocytes). we assume that the ﬁsh have not reproduced upon capture, and the total number of oocytes represents the total number of eggs a female will have in one reproductive season. therefore, we estimated the number of clutches per spawning season by dividing the total oocytes by the number of mature oocytes. late maturing individuals (n = 6) and ripe individuals (n = 2) were not used in fecundity estimates because it was impossible to know if any eggs had already been spawned (heins et al. 1992). additionally, heins et al. (1992) suggest that best estimates of fecundity are obtained by sampling females throughout the reproductive period. however, we sampled ﬁsh during the period when gonad size is reported to be the greatest (i.e., prior to spawning; johnson et al. 1995). also, we found few individuals that were ripe or showed evidence of spent ovaries. therefore, we assume that total oocytes represent fecundity for each female during the reproductive period. for males, maturity was determined by visual inspection of the testes. mature testes were enlarged, opaque and white, while immature testes were small and transparent or translucent. statistical analyses to determine if growth rates and patterns differed based on habitat quality and predation environment, we used a multivariate mixed model analysis (proc mixed; sas institute inc. 2008). restricted maximum likelihood was used to ﬁt the model. the response variable was the size-at-age for ages 1–4 for each individual, with individual as a random effect. the model included four ﬁxed effects: sex, year of growth (ages 1–4), predation environment and habitat quality. the interactions of year of growth with the other factors are of greatest interest in the model because we are using ﬁsh growth to determine how ﬁsh popula- tions in each stream respond to the other factors. we were especially interested in the year of growth by predation by habitat quality interaction; in other words, do ﬁsh grow differently in predator and nonpredator environments based on habitat quality. we ran the full model with the four ﬁxed effects and all possible interactions. we then used model selection techniques based on akiake information criterion (aic) to determine if reduced models resulted in a better model ﬁt (burnham & anderson 2002; johnson & omland 2004). important there are several candidate independent variables that could inﬂuence growth and reproduction; two of the most factors are temperature and resource availability (brett 1979). however, these factors are individual traits of habitat quality, and our goal was to characterise the overall effect of habitat quality not its potential single components. therefore, differences in temperature and resource availability are already accounted for in the main effect of habitat quality. additionally, the pattern of variation in temperature measured during the spawning period shows differences only in one of the four streams (higher temperatures in the san pitch river; table 1). if temperature has an overwhelmingly important effect, we would see that as higher growth rates in san pitch river compared to the other three locations (johnson et al. 2004). growth rates were lowest in the san pitch river leading us to conclude that temperature differ- ences alone were relatively unimportant determinants of growth and reproduction in southern leatherside chub in these systems. for resource availability, studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between habitat quality and both aquatic and terrestrial macr- oinvertebrates, the resource for southern leatherside chub (rader & belish 1999; magner et al. 2008; fischer et al. 2010). therefore, ﬁsh densities should be positively correlated with resource availability and consequently habitat quality, as is demonstrated by southern leatherside chub in these streams. female reproductive traits were compared among locations using an analysis of covariance (ancova; interacting effects on stream ﬁsh proc glm, sas institute inc. 2008) with ovary wet mass, total oocytes, clutch size, number of clutches and egg diameter as response variables in ﬁve separate analyses. prior to analyses, ovary wet mass, total oocytes and clutch size were log10 transformed, and number of clutches was square-root transformed. egg diameter met parametric assumptions and was not transformed. for each analysis, female size (log10 somatic wet mass) was the covariate, and predation environment and habitat quality were the ﬁxed effects. we ran the full model (all possible interactions of the ﬁxed effects and covariate) and reduced models for each analysis, and used model selection techniques (aic) to determine the best ﬁt model (burnham & anderson 2002; johnson & omland 2004). testes wet mass was compared among locations using ancova (proc glm, sas institute inc. 2008) with male body size (log10 somatic wet mass) as the covariate. predation environment and habitat quality were the ﬁxed effects. testes wet mass was log10 transformed. we used model selection techniques (aic) to select the best model among the full model (all possible interactions of the ﬁxed effects and covariate) and reduced models (burnham & anderson 2002; johnson & omland 2004). results the best ﬁt model for the analysis of growth rates was the full model. size-at-age of southern leatherside chub was signiﬁcantly affected by the interaction of year by predation by habitat quality (table 2). growth was greater in high-quality habitats than in low-quality habitats, and growth was greater in predation envi- ronments than in nonpredation environments. how- ever, the response to predation was greater in ﬁsh in

high-quality streams (fig. 2). the greatest growth was found in the high- quality predation stream; ﬁsh in this location were 23% larger than ﬁsh in the low-quality nonpredation stream, the stream with the lowest growth. growth was also affected by sex (table 2); however, females at age 2.5 were only 2 mm, or approximately 2.5%, larger than males. females differed in age-at-maturity between low and high-quality streams (age-2 and age-3, respec- tively); males did not differ, maturing at age-2 in all locations. the mean length of reproductive females across all streams was 87 mm sl (sd = 15.51). the smallest female with mature ovaries was 60 mm sl from san pitch river, and the largest was 131 mm sl from soldier creek. in 94 of 102 females, ovaries were large and mature, containing maturing oocytes and a separate group of larger, mature oocytes. six females had late maturing ovaries, and either had not yet reached the mature stage or had already participated in spawning activity and were yolking another clutch. completely ripe ovaries were observed in only two individuals. for the analyses of ovary wet mass and clutch size, the best model included only the two ﬁxed effects and the covariate with no interactions. for the analyses of total oocytes, number of clutches and egg diameter, the best model included the two ﬁxed effects, the covariate and the predation by habitat

low-quality habitats had larger clutches than those in high-quality habitats, and females in predation envi- ronments had larger clutches than those in nonpredator environments (fig. 4b). the number of clutches in a reproductive season was signiﬁcantly affected by the interaction of habitat quality and predation (table 3). in high-quality habitat, females in the nonpredator environment had a higher estimated number of clutches compared to the predator environment. in low-quality habitat, the number of clutches was not signiﬁcantly different between predation environments and was similar to the high-quality, predator environ- ment (fig. 4c). oocyte diameter was signiﬁcantly affected by the interaction of predation and habitat quality, but was not signiﬁcantly affected by body size (table 3). in a high-quality environment, oocyte diameter was larger in females in the presence of brown_trout. in low-quality habitat, oocyte diameter was not signiﬁcantly different between predation environments (fig. 4d). the best model for the analysis of male reproduc- tion included only the two ﬁxed effects and the covariate with no interactions. testes wet mass was interacting effects on stream ﬁsh signiﬁcantly affected by habitat quality after account- ing for body size (table 3). males in low-quality habitat had testes that were greater in mass than those in high-quality habitat (fig. 3). discussion patterns of growth in southern leatherside chub followed the predictions of ﬁsh responding primarily to lethal effects (i.e., lower density) with the greatest growth observed in the high-quality predation stream and the lowest growth in the low-quality nonpredation stream. the signiﬁcant interaction of year by predation by habitat quality on size-at-age indicated that ﬁsh responded differently to the effects of predation in low-quality streams compared to ﬁsh in high-quality streams. the increase in growth because of predation in low-quality streams was greater than the response to predation in high-quality streams. in the high-quality predation stream, where refuges are present, ﬁsh are affected by both lethal and nonlethal effects; while in the low-quality predation stream, ﬁsh are only affected by lethal effects because of a lack of refuges. therefore, the lethal effects (reduced density and increased resource availability; cooper et al. 1990; fraser & gilliam 1992; holomuzki et al. 2010) are dampened in the high-quality, predation stream because of nonlethal (reduced foraging effects (a) (c) 3.44 3.40 3.36 3.32 3.28 3.24 3.20 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6

presence and absence of an introduced predator. open circles = nonpredator environment; ﬁlled circles = predator environment. 109 billman et al. efﬁciency; abrams 1997; walser et al. 1999; holo- muzki et al. 2010). however, in the low-quality predation stream, predators can have a greater effect on ﬁsh density, and therefore per capita resource availability, with the absence of nonlethal effects, resulting in a greater response in growth of southern leatherside chub. the pattern of growth in southern leatherside chub was consistent with documented individual effects of predation (lethal effects) and habitat quality (bro¨nmark & miner 1992; benard 2004; borcherding & magnhagen 2008; chivers et al. 2008). however, the magnitude of these effects on a ﬁsh’s growth rate are compounded depending on the balance of lethal and nonlethal effects and must be considered collectively to understand how native ﬁsh respond to these changes in their environment. this study demonstrates that reproduction in southern leatherside chub was consistent with an adaptive response to differences in mortality, rather than a plastic response to resource availability as exhibited by growth. for reproductive allocation (i.e., ovary and testes wet mass), the interaction of habitat quality and predation environ- ment did not signiﬁcantly explain variation and was not included in the best ﬁt models. habitat quality affected reproductive allocation such that ﬁsh in low- quality environments allocated more to reproduction than ﬁsh in high-quality environments. fish also had reduced growth in low-quality environments as well as an earlier onset of maturation. these patterns are consistent with a tradeoff of growth and reproduction because of differences in mortality rates between the environments (i.e., higher mortality in low-quality environments) (johnson & belk 2001; walsh & reznick 2009). tradeoffs between total oocytes, clutch size, num- ber of clutches and offspring size (i.e., mature oocyte diameter) were affected by the interaction of habitat quality and predation, and also followed patterns indicative of an adaptive response to differences in mortality rates. southern leatherside chub in the high- quality nonpredator environment had the smallest clutch size, yet had the most clutches per reproductive season. this extension of iteroparity (i.e., more clutches per season) suggests that the ratio of adult survival to juvenile survival is greater in the high- quality nonpredator stream than in streams with one or both anthropogenic effects present (charnov & schaf- fer 1973; young 1981). this agrees with our assump- tion that adult survival rates will be lower in predator environments and in low-quality habitats. having more clutches per reproductive season may be a strategy to offset high juvenile mortality by increasing the production of eggs (i.e., maximizing the number of oocytes that can be held by reducing the number of larger, mature ooctyes) or by reducing competition 110 with same-aged juveniles (mills 1991; einum & fleming 2000). in contrast, southern leatherside chub that had fewer but larger clutches had larger offspring, suggesting that ﬁsh from these populations may have had higher juvenile survival rates because egg size is often positively correlated with juvenile body size and survival (hutchings 1991; mills 1991; einum & fleming 2000). additionally, density-dependent inter- actions select for larger offspring; in streams where ﬁsh have fewer clutches, we expect same-aged juvenile densities to be higher resulting in greater competition and stronger selection by density-depen- dent interactions (gregersen et al. 2006, 2008; bashey 2008). growth and reproduction of southern leatherside chub responded to different stimuli; growth exhibited a plastic response to changes in resource availability while reproduction exhibited an adaptive response to changes in mortality. these differences in response of these two traits are likely caused by the relationship between size and reproduction. reproduction is con- strained by body size; however, size is not constrained in ﬁsh because they are indeterminate growers. therefore, a ﬁsh that responds to ﬂuctuations in resources by increasing growth will likely receive a larger increase in fecundity than would be achieved if extra energy was allocated to a plastic response in life history traits. for example, a 4-year-old female in a low-quality stream, in which ﬁsh exhibited an adaptive response to mortality, would allocate 46% more to ovary wet mass in her lifetime than a female that exhibited similar growth in a high-quality stream. however, ﬁsh that exhibited a plastic response to resource availability by increasing growth would allocate 70% more to ovary wet mass across a 4-year lifetime. in addition to the increased reproductive potential, ﬁsh that respond to higher resource avail- ability by increasing growth are better able to avoid predators and to compete with other ﬁsh (beamish 1978; lundvall et al. 1999; westerberg et al. 2004). we have demonstrated how two anthropogenic disturbances, introduced predators and habitat degra- dation, interact to affect individual-level life history traits of southern leatherside chub. plastic or adaptive responses to these disturbances at the individual-level must overcome increased mortality and ⁄ or recruitment deﬁcits in order for a population or species to persist in its altered environment. therefore, studies on individ- ual-level traits and processes must be combined with population-level and community-level assessments to fully understand the effects of anthropogenic factors on native species (townsend 2003). by assessing anthropogenic effects collectively, we are able to provide a more comprehensive analysis of how multiple factors affect the life history and biology of native species. these studies provide vital information to better manage the multiple anthropogenic factors that inﬂuence native species and provide a better understanding of the basic biology of native species before problems of species loss arise (bruton 1995; belk & johnson 2007). acknowledgements funding was provided by the department of biology at byu. chandler peterson, sage kelley, sudeep ghimire, peter meyers, and jonathan
