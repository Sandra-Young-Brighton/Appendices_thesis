(2010) proposed a method relying on a hierarchical bayesian model (hbm). redd counts data sets collected over a broad spatio-temporal domain are of great interest for tracking the variation through time of the spatial distribution of the potential spawners. this is important for man- agement purposes when the habitat quality is variable across river sections of a catchment or when the spa- tial distribution can vary depending on management actions or on environmental factors. however, long- term data sets are also prone to changes in data col- lection methodology (brun et al. 2011). in the present article, we show how dauphin et al. (2010) modelling approach can be used and expanded to both (i) account for a change in the data collection procedure and (ii) analyse the varia- tion through time of the potential spawners’ spatial distribution. the first issue is addressed by the intro- duction of a data collection procedure effect. the importance of accounting for the change in the data collection methodology is assessed by a formal com- parison with another model ignoring the change in the data collection. the second is dealt with by con- necting dauphin et al. (2010) potential spawners to redd model to an explicit representation of the spatial distribution process of the potential spawners. the expanded modelling approach is demonstrated in a case study carried out on the atlantic salmon popula- tion of the allier river (france). the atlantic salmon population has been severely declining in this catch- ment over the last decades and presents crucial con- servation interest because of its unique genetic (perrier et al. 2011) and phenotypic (cuinat 1988) characteris- tics. adults have to migrate at least 700 km to reach the first spawning grounds, and the allier is the last large river holding atlantic salmon in the southern range of its distribution. redd counts are available from 1977 to 2011 in the allier catchment. but an important change occurred in the redd data collection in 1997: counts by foot or by boat were replaced by counts from a helicopter. the allier can be divided into three main sections according to management and habitat con- siderations. the uppermost section became available to returning atlantic salmon adults in the middle of the time series. the lowermost section is of poorer habitat quality for reproduction and juvenile rearing. three fish counters were installed progressively during the time series along the allier river at the downstream end of each river section. they provide exhaustive or partial returning adult counts in the different river sections considered. years for which both redd and adult counts are simultaneously avail- able are used to build a calibration relationship relating the two types of data. once estimated, the parameters of this relationship are then used to derive potential spawner estimates in years for which only redd counts are available. the model is described and applied to the available data to provide retrospective estimates of the abundance of potential spawners in the three river sections of the allier catchment from 1977 to 2011. materials and methods study site and data available the allier river (44° 35′ 23″ n 3° 48′ 04″ e) is the main tributary of the loire. it drains a 14,310-km2 catch- ment and flows into the loire about 421 km from its source. to reach the first spawning grounds in the allier river, adult salmon have to migrate for at least 700 km from the mouth of the loire river (fig. 1). according to the description of the habitat quality in the allier river made by cuinat (1988), the area downstream of langeac is poor for salmon spawning and juvenile rearing. upstream from langeac, much better spawning and nursery habitat is found because of steeper gradient and better water quality. the allier catchment is divided into three river sections delimited by the adult counting stations (fig. 1): between vichy and langeac, between lan- geac and poutes and upstream from poutes. they are represented by the index i = {1, 2, 3}. data were col- lected between 1977 and 2011 represented by the index t = {1, …, 35}. the 4 data sets used for this study are given in tables s1 and 2. they include the following: annual redd counts rt,i and the associated proportion of spawning areas surveyed pr t;i, annual number of adults moving upstream of the three counting stations at vichy, langeac and poutes (fig. 1; nv, nl, np, respectively) and the number of adults removed before spawning to be used as broodstock in a hatch- ery bt. redds are counted around december once most of the females have spawned (bach et al. 2010). from 1977 to 1996, the counting operations were carried out by foot or by boat. since 1997, the counts were fulfilled by means of a helicopter (ros 1997). the efficiency of the counting station at langeac is dependent on the water conditions: at high flows, the structure is submerged and fish may move upstream without being counted. as a consequence, 627 dauphin et al. fig. 1. location of the loire river and the allier river and the three adults counting station in vichy, langeac and poutes. the count data provided by this station (from 2003 to 2008 only) are used as a minimum number of fish moving upstream of langeac. the two other adult counting stations were considered to count exhaus- tively the adults migrating upstream. fish can only move upstream by going through two fishways at vichy and a fish lift at poutes. these facilities are continuously surveyed by means of video-recording. counting errors, if any, are thus negligible relative to the interannual variations of the escapement numbers. adult counts are available from 1997 to 2011 at vichy and from 1986 to 2011 at poutes. modelling henceforth, the notation a|b  f(b) means the ran- dom variable a (whether unobservable or observa- is distributed according to the probability ble) distribution function (pdf) f conditionally on b. unobservable quantities are necessarily unknown, but observable quantities may be unknown as well in case of missing data. numbers of adults moving upstream of vichy, langeac and poutes (nv, nl and np) are observable quantities, but they have been observed only during part of time series covered by this study. at vichy, data are missing for nv up to 1996. partial counts are available at langeac for a few of the last years only (2003–2008); hence, data are essentially miss- ing for nl over the entire time series. although counts at poutes are not available before 1986, there is no missing data for np. indeed, counts have always been carried out once the fish lift giving access to the upstream of poutes was built. the full 628 estimating spatial distribution of atlantic salmon escapement using redd counts models description spatial repartition of potential spawners the number of adult salmon returning in the allier river in year t and passing above vichy nv is t assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. jlv ;

(2010) relating adult counts to redd counts is adapted and combined with a spatial repartition model to pro- vide potential spawner estimates for three river sec- tions of the allier catchment during a thirty-years period. two models were tested: the first one ignor- ing the change in the redd data collection procedure (model 1) and the second one taking it into account (model 2). a significant effect of this change is detected. the two models produce similar estimates of the unknowns of ultimate interest (i.e., potential spawner abundances), although the model 2 estimates are generally slightly more uncertain than model 1 (see fig. 5c,d). because of the significant methodol- ogy effect, a lower dic and its more general formu- lation, the model 2 was retained. the modelling relies on a stationarity hypothesis regarding the redd:potential spawner ratio parameter kt,i and the probabilities of moving upstream of lan- geac pl (i.e., their mean and variance do not vary over time). posterior checking of the model residuals (not reported here) indicates that there t and poutes pp t table 2. posterior model checking: bayesian p-values of chi-square statistics based on data replication technique for model 1 and model 2. p-values p(v2(r rep, hr)  v2(r, hr)) p(v2(n rep, hn )  v2(n, hn )) p(v2(n rep_data, hn_data)  v2(n data, hn_data)) model 1 model 2 model 1 model 2 model 1 vichy–langeac langeac–poutes upstream of poutes 0.4981 0.5189 0.4315 0.4890 0.5149 0.6666 0.5292 0.5002 0.4953 0.5075 0.5047 0.5045 0.3884 0.4954 - model 2 0.3980 0.5045 - 631 dauphin et al.

(2004) or michiel- sens et al. (2008). this model will use additional available information related to atlantic salmon in the allier catchment juvenile stocking) to provide better estimates of the potential spawners but also estimates of the different parame- ters related to the life cycle of atlantic salmon in the allier catchment. another potential use of the calibra- tion relationship between redd and adult counts developed in this study would be to build a hierarchi- (e.g., 0 + sampling, cal model that would pool other calibration relation- ships available for atlantic salmon in different rivers (such as dauphin et al. 2010) and using them to pro- vide spawning escapement estimates in rivers where only redd counts are available. acknowledgements this research was part of the plan loire grandeur nature and financially supported by the european regional development fund (erdf), the agence de l’eau loire bretagne and the etablissement public loire. the authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their comments and sugges- tions which greatly improved the content of the manuscript. references bach, j.-m., parouty, t., leon, c., senecal, a., cornu, v., portafaix, p., juin tremeur, e., lelievre, m. & baisez, a. 2010. recueil de donnees biologiques 2009, saint-pourcßain- sur-sioule: logrami. 346 pp. baisez, a., bach, j.-m., leon, c., parouty, c., terrade, r., hoffman, m. & lafaille, p. 2011. migration delays and 635 uusitalo, l. 2008. combining multiple bayesian data analy- ses in a sequential framework for quantitative fisheries stock assessment. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 65: 962–974. minster, a.m. & bomassi, p. 1999. reperage et evaluation des surfaces potentielles de developpement de juveniles de saumons atlantiques. proposition d’un modele de gestion des stocks sur les bassins de l’allier et de l’arroux. rapport logrami/csp dr6, 44 p. + annexes. muhlfeld, c.c., taper, m.l., staples, d.f. & shepard, b.b. 2006. observer error structure in bull trout redd counts in montana streams: implications for inference on true redd numbers. transactions of the american fisheries society 135: 643–654. murdoch, a.r., pearsons, t.n. & maitland, t.w. 2010. esti- mating the spawning escapement of hatchery- and natural-ori- gin spring chinook salmon using redd and carcass data. north american journal of fisheries management 30: 361–375. parsons, a.l. & skalski, j.r. 2010. quantitative assessment techniques. reviews in fisheries of salmonid escapement science 18: 301–314. perrier, c., guyomard, r., bagliniere, j.-l. & evanno, g. 2011. determinants of hierarchical genetic structure in atlan- tic salmon populations: environmental factors vs. anthropo- genic influences. molecular ecology 20: 4231–4245. rivot, e., prevost, e., parent, e. & bagliniere, j.-l. 2004. a bayesian state-space modelling framework for fitting a sal- mon stage-structured population dynamic model to multiple time series of field data. ecological modelling 179: 463–485. ros, o. 1997. comptage des frayeres de saumon par helic- optere sur la riviere allier, de vieille-brioude a langeac. rapport logrami/dr6, 9 p. spiegelhalter, d.j., best, n.g., carlin, b.p. & van der linde, a. 2002. bayesian measures of model complexity and fit (with discussion). journal of the royal statistical society, series b 64: 583–616. spiegelhalter, d.j., thomas, a., best, n. & lunn, d. 2007. winbugs: user manual, version 2.10. cambridge: medical research council biostatistics unit. thomas, a., o’hara, b., ligges, u. & sturtz, s. 2006. making bugs open. r news 6: 12–17. supporting information additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article: table s1 annual redd counts and proportion of potential spawning area surveyed for the 3 sections of the river allier table s2 adults counted at the 3 counting sta- tions: vichy, langeac and, poutes. dauphin et al. mortality of adult atlantic salmon salmo_salar en route to spawning grounds on the river allier, france. endangered species research 15: 265–270. brooks, s.p. & gelman, a. 1998. general methods for moni- toring convergence of iterative simulations. journal of com- putational and graphical statistics 7: 434–455. brun, m., abraham, c., jarry, m., dumas, j., lange, f. & prevost, e. 2011. estimating an homogeneous series of a population abundance indicator despite changes in data col- lection procedure: a hierarchical bayesian modelling approach. ecological modelling 222: 1069–1079. crozier, w.w., potter, e.c.e., prevost, e., sch€on, p.j. & o’maoi- leidigh, n. 2003. salmodel -
