177–183. c munksgaard, 2001 abstract – avian predation on emigrating wild and domesticated sea_trout smolts was investigated in a fjord in the western baltic sea. in april 1997, 50 domesticated and 50 wild smolts were intraperitoneally tagged with radio-transmitters and released in a small coastal stream. predation was recorded by signal interception in an estuarine breeding colony of cormorants and herons near the outlet of the stream. of the 78 emigrating smolts, 51 (65%) were recorded as eaten. predation rates were signiﬁcantly higher among small than large smolts and signiﬁcantly higher among domesticated smolts. the ﬁrst 2 days after entering the sea, both wild and domesticated smolts suffered a severe daily predation rate (range 20–34%). the results support the hypothesis of a transient period immediately after exposure to full-strength sea water, where smolts experience an elevated risk of predation. a transient increase in postsmolt mortality may be found also in moderately saline environments (20–23 ppt). c. dieperink, s. pedersen, m. i. pedersen department of inland fisheries, danish institute for fisheries research, silkeborg, denmark key words:

a transitory and high-risk life stage. the smolts are forced to migrate through an alien en- vironment, and the high abundance of potential prey attracts predators both in the stream and in the sea. several authors have proposed that vary- ing predation pressure during the smolt migration could be the key factor regulating the year class strength of above-legal-size salmonids (huntsman 1941; elson 1962; larsson 1985; levings 1994). laboratory experiments have shown that the mor- tality of atlantic salmon smolts (salmo_salar l.) is increased substantially by exposure to full-strength sea water and the simultaneous presence of pred- ators (järvi 1989a). in denmark the management of anadromous sea_trout (s. trutta l.) has been based on stockings of domesticated ﬁsh since the start of the 1900s (otterstrøm 1938). this strategy has led to annual stocking of hatchery-domesticated smolt in all major trout streams since the 1960s (christensen et al. 1993). however, the post-release survival of domesticated salmonids may be considerably lower than that of wild ﬁshes (maynard et al. 1995). the purpose of the present study was to investi- gate and compare the predation on wild and dom- esticated sea_trout smolt after their migration to the sea. study area a fjord with a large breeding colony of cormorant (phalacrocorax carbo l.) and grey heron (ardea cinera l.) was selected as the study location. the colony was situated on the 1-km2 island of vorsø in the horsens fjord, which adjoins the western baltic sea (fig. 1). in 1997, the vorsø seabird col- ony included approximately 4500 breeding pairs of cormorants and 85 pairs of herons. both species use tall trees for nesting. large parts of the 53-km2 fjord are tidal ﬂats, which are exposed at low tide. the mean daily intertidal difference in water level 177 dieperink et al. fig. 1. map of the study area, showing the release location in river åkjær and the sea-bird colony on the island of vorsø. smolts have to pass southwest of alrø to leave the fjord. is 0.3–0.5 m. average salinity varies from 20 to 23 ppt, and the water is turbid, secchi depth being 1.9–3.5 m in may. horsens fjord is an estuary for several ﬁrst- and second-order streams with naturally reproducing populations of anadromous sea_trout. these streams are generally too small (less than 3 m wide and 0.3 m deep) for cormorants to forage, so grey heron is the only major avian predator on ﬁsh in fresh water. the study was conducted in river åkjær, a 2- to 4-m-wide second-order stream that drains into the fjord approximately 6 km east of vorsø. material and methods experimental ﬁsh on 6 april 1997, 50 wild trout smolts (tl 18.7”1.5 cm sd) were captured by dc electro- ﬁshing in the upper reaches of river åkjær and transported to the tagging and release site, 1.5 km from the outlet (fig. 1). the same day, 50 domesti- cated 1-year-old trout smolts (20.0”1.2 cm) were moved from the hårkjær hatchery to the river åkjær. this hatchery stock was among the three most commonly used in the restocking program in denmark (christensen et al. 1993). the hårkjær stock was selected for high growth rate and silvery coloration (p. ebbesen, personal communication). the domesticated ﬁsh were reared in outdoor ponds under natural photoperiod and water tem- perature and fed an ad libitum regime of commer- cial trout pellets. each group of ﬁsh was retained in a 150-liter ﬁne-meshed keepnet in the stream and given 2 days of post-handling recovery. on 8 178 april 1997, the 100 smolts were anesthetized, tagged with radio transmitters, and released in the stream. surgical procedure the ﬁsh were individually anesthetized by 3–4 min of immersion in 25 mg ` l»1 ethyl-p-aminobenzoate (benzocainea). after sterilisation in 96% ethanol, the tag was inserted through a 12-mm mid-ventral incision anterior to the pelvic girdle. a 7-cm-long and 1.1-mm-diameter cannula was then inserted into the body cavity through the incision and used to make an abdominal puncture hole approximate- ly 15-mm posterior to the incision. the antenna was passed to the exterior by threading it through the cannula, which was then removed. the wound was closed with two absorbable silk sutures before the ﬁsh was transferred to a recovery tank. the surgical procedure lasted 1.5 min. after each ﬁsh had regained full equilibrium and reacted to visual stimuli (5–15 min), it was given a further 30 min of recovery before release in a shaded pool below the bridge where surgery was performed. signal detection the radio tags were lotek model mbft-7m (1.8 g in air, 1.0 g in water, 8.2 mm in diameter and 19 mm in length). the ratio of tag weight to ﬁsh weight varied between 1.8% and 3.6%, as estimated from standard length and weight keys for brown_trout. at individual frequencies in the range of 142.0–143.5 mhz, the tags transmitted 30 pulses per min. tags had been pre-programmed to run in a 16-h on (start at 06:00) and 8-h off duty cycle to give a minimum battery lifetime of 4 weeks. at the cormorant colony on vorsø, an auto- matic listening station (als) was erected in the middle of the island and started on 8 april 1997. the als consisted of an 8-m tall mast with two 9-element yagi antennas and a lotek srx–400 telemetry receiver powered by a 125-a 12-v bat- tery. the receiver continuously listened at each fre- quency for 5 s to complete a scan cycle in 8 min. in order to exclude noise, only frequencies that were registered continously for more than 3 scan cycles (or tracked manually) and transmitting exactly 30 pulses per min were considered valid. manual tracking was carried out on ten occasions, whereby 16 of the transmitters also registered by the als were conﬁrmed. one transmitter was tracked manually but not recorded by the als. by carry- ing an active transmitter around the island on ap- ril 16, it was ensured that the als was not able to intercept signals from ﬁsh just above sea level (e.g. dead ﬁsh washed ashore). field routine the radio-tagged smolts were released on 8 april at a position 1500 m upstream of the head of the tide (fig. 1). from 9 april for 4 weeks, the loca- tion of each ﬁsh was determined by daily, manual tracking of the lower 3 km of the stream. individ- ual smolts were considered to have emigrated when the ﬁsh were no longer detected in this area. to ensure that no radio-tagged ﬁsh had moved up- stream and out of the study area, the entire stream was scanned twice during the study. after 4 weeks, on 6–7 may 1997 the study area was electroﬁshed to catch smolts remaining in the stream. data treatment to test whether the predation rate was dependent on the size of the smolts, the domesticated and the wild ﬁsh were a posteriori subdivided into groups of below and above median length. the timing of predation was analyzed relative to entry into sea water. for all migrants, the last observation in the stream was deﬁned as day zero, and the fate of ﬁsh was thereafter treated on a day- by-day basis as either preyed upon or survived. the daily rate of predation was estimated as the ratio of the number of ﬁsh preyed upon at the end of the day relative to the number of ﬁsh that were alive (not preyed upon) at the beginning of the day. to test for differences in migration timing and survival time, the mann-whitney (wilcoxon) test was applied, while the binomial test was used in tests for differences in rates of migration and pre- dation. results of the 100 smolts released, 17 stayed in the stream and 78 emigrated (table 1). five tags were recov- ered from the stream during the study period. of these, two tags were found lying on the streambed, one was found regurgitated at the stream bank and two were tracked to a wounded cormorant forag- ing in the stream (table 1). estuarine predation on smolts fig. 2. post-release migration and fate of wild and domesticated smolts.

(b) daily count of smolts eaten by birds and brought within interception range of the als. most smolts emigrated during the ﬁrst 24 h after release, but there was a marked difference in mi- grational compulsion between wild and domesti- cated ﬁsh (fig. 2a). domesticated smolts emi- grated signiﬁcantly sooner than wild smolts (w‰ 1080, p‰0.0006). among emigrants, the median time spent in the stream was 1.8 days for domesti- cated smolts and 10.4 days for wild smolts. the 78 smolts that entered the sea were heavily preyed upon (fig. 2b). within 4 weeks after re- lease, 48 ﬁsh had been eaten and registered in the seabird colony. thirty domesticated smolts (67%) and 18 (55%) wild smolts were eaten (table 1). following the transition from fresh water to salt water, the daily rate of predation was very high, and within two days, 37 of 48 smolts were eaten by sea birds. the ﬁrst two days in sea water, wild and domesticated smolt suffered a mean predation rate of 0.30–0.25 day»1, respectively (fig. 3). dur- ing the subsequent 10 days, the mean predation table 1. the effect of rearing background on the post-release fate of 100 trout smolt, tracked for four weeks during the transition from a small coastal stream to the western baltic sea. dead in stream non- migrants 50 wild smolt 50 reared smolt 21 32 15 2 migrated preyed upon by birds presumed survivors n 33 45 rate 0.69 0.94 n 18 30 rate 0.55 0.67 n 15 15 rate 0.45 0.33 1one radio-tag was found in a bird regurgitate at the stream bank, another was tracked to a wounded wing-broken cormorant, swimming in the mouth of the stream. 2two radio-tags were found lying on the streambed, and one was tracked to the wounded cormorant. 179 dieperink et al. fig. 3. the daily rate of predation by colonial seabirds on the emigrated smolts. the vertical bars indicate 95% conﬁdence li- mits. rate was reduced to 0.005–0.026 day»1. wild smolt appeared to recover more rapidly from the transi- ent increase in predation rate than did domesti- cated smolts (fig. 3). within groups of wild and domesticated smolts, the rate of predation was higher among small ﬁsh than among large ﬁsh (table 2). the predation rate of the smallest ﬁsh (0.73) was signiﬁcantly higher (z‰2.042, p‰0.041; combining groups of wild and domesticated ﬁsh) than that of large ﬁsh (0.50). the smallest domesticated and the largest wild ﬁsh were of comparable size (table 2), yet signiﬁ- cant differences were found in rate of migration (z‰»2.257, p‰0.024) and rate of predation mor- tality (z‰»2.295, p‰0.022). wild smolts were sig- niﬁcantly less preyed upon than were the domesti- cated smolt of similar size (large wild versus small domesticated, see table 2). discussion radio telemetry is valuable in estimating ﬁsh sur- vival only if the ﬁsh killed can be distinguished from those that survive (olson et al. 1990). fish pre- dation studies based on telemetric tagging of prey table 2. effect of trout smolt size and rearing background on the rates of migration and postsmolt predation mortality. the one hundred trout smolts were released in a small tributary to the western baltic sea. length (cm) emigrants preyed upon smolt group n range median n p n rate p small wild smolt 25 16.5–18.0 17.5 large wild smolt 25 18.5–22.5 19.5 small reared smolt 25 17.5–20.0 19.0 large reared smolt 25 20.0–23.0 21.0 18 15 22 23 0.370 0.024 0.637 12 0.67 6 0.40 17 13 0.77 0.57 0.126 0.022 0.149 180 ﬁsh therefore have to allocate resources into recov- ery of tags to verify the predation event. the present study demonstrates how the colonial habit of cer- tain marine predators may facilitate retrieval of in- formation about predation events, while extending the use of radio telemetry to a saline environment. it can be argued that bias could arise from the pres- ent use of implanted tags representing 1.8–3.7% of the body weight of the ﬁsh. however, in juvenile at- lantic salmon a tag-to-ﬁsh weight ratio below 5% did not affect swimming performance (mccleave & stred 1975). likewise, moore et al. (1990) found that intraperitoneal implantations did not affect the growth, feeding or swimming behavior of juvenile atlantic salmon. these authors used a higher tag- to-ﬁsh-weight ratio (recalculated to 1.4–4.3) than in the present study. peake et al. (1997) evaluated the swimming performance of wild and reared altantic salmon smolts that had been tagged surgically with transmitters and recommended that data from the ﬁrst 16 h after tagging should be treated with care. the present study indicated no effect of tagging pro- cedures on smolt survival, as the survival of ﬁsh that migrated within 24 h after tagging was not different to the survival of ﬁsh that postponed their mi- gration. it was not ﬁrmly established whether all the ﬁsh emigrated from the stream or some were in fact eaten while in the stream. the migration of individ- ual ﬁsh would have been better documented if an automatic listening station had been situated at the outlet of the stream. heron is the only predator that could convey tags from the stream to the seabird col- ony. herons were occasionally observed at the stream, but in the same year, a study of the heron predation on carlin-tagged and domesticated sea_trout smolt released in river åkjær reported no re- coveries from heron nests at vorsø (madsen 1998). it was suggested that the herons observed foraging in the stream were probably non-breeding or be- longed to another breeding colony (madsen 1998). the inﬂuence of herons observed in the present study area is thus considered minimal. the observed predation rate must be considered a low estimate of the total marine predation mor- tality from seabirds on the island, since tagged smolts may have been eaten and brought to the island without being registered by the als. unre- gistered predation of tagged ﬁsh may also be caused by deviant behavior of the predator and malfunction of the transmitter or receiver. the bird may have dropped the transmitter before returning to the colony. other reasons for failure of regis- tration may include coiling of the antenna in the stomach of the birds, and birds resting in ‘‘blind’’ angles relative to the als, low power of transmit- ters, etc. in the als log, no recordings overlapped in time, so there was no evidence to suggest that two or more smolts had been eaten simultaneously by the same bird. therefore, the present study did not indicate any functional response of avian pred- ators to the presence of tagged ﬁsh, as reported by mace (1983), and by feltham & maclean (1996). the present results showed a marked concen- tration of predation events during the ﬁrst 2 days following the migration of individual smolts. more than two thirds of the casualties among both dom- esticated and wild smolts occurred within the ﬁrst 48 h after the individual ﬁsh had entered sea water. this elevated predation mortality may be ex- plained in two ways. first, during the initial 6.5 km of seaward migration, the smolts have to pass close by the sea-bird colony on the island of vorsø, resulting in an elevated risk of encounters with predators. secondly, the change of environment may weaken the normal antipredator behavior of the smolts and thereby increase the risk of pre- dation. the ﬁrst days in marine waters, sea_trout post- smolts have been observed to reside in proximity of the freshwater outlet (johnstone et al. 1995; lyse et al. 1998). an average swimming speed of 1.8 km ` d»1 was recorded by lyse et al. (1998) for sea_trout postsmolts, whereas moore & potter (1994) found that sea_trout smolts passed along a 3.3-km (strongly tidal) estuary in less than 24 h. in the horsens fjord, the mean difference between low and high tides is moderate and the current velocity is normally below 10 cm ` s»1. with this migration speed, it is unlikely that the smolts would be able to pass the vorsø seabird colony in less than 2 days after migration from river åkjær. accordingly, the probability of encounters between cormorants and smolts (and thus rate of pre- dation) would be expected to increase over several days as the smolts slowly approached and passed the seabird colony. however, the elevated pre- dation rate was found only during the ﬁrst 2 days after migration (fig. 3). this suggests that the transiently increased vulnerability may be caused by altered performance of the ﬁsh rather than an elevated risk of encounters with predators. this is in concordance with laboratory ﬁndings that dur- ing transition from fresh water to full-strength sea water, the presence of predators may induce a cumulative stress response in atlantic salmon smolt (järvi 1989a, b, 1990; järvi & uglem 1993). the hyperosmotic stress after 12 and 24 h of ex- posure to full-strength sea water resulted in a tem- porary increase of predation mortality on atlantic salmon smolts (handeland et al. 1996). the present study shows that elevated predation mortality may be observed immediately after sea estuarine predation on smolts trout smolts enter a brackish environment (20–23 ppt). the return of the predation mortality to nor- mal levels after day two at sea indicated that osmo- regulatory problems could be part of the cause. after exposure to full-strength sea water, atlantic salmon smolts need a period of a few days to back- regulate the plasma chloride levels and hematocrit (handeland et al. 1996). smolts of atlantic salmon show changes in blood concentration only upon immersion in salinities above 26 ppt (parry 1960). the presently observed vulnerability of sea_trout postsmolt in water that is more brackish may therefore not apply to other species. despite the fact that migrating sea_trout smolts are fairy well preadapted to sea water (hogstrand & haux 1985; lysfjord & staurnes 1998), sea_trout is generally found to have inferior osmoregulatory ability com- pared with atlantic salmon (parry 1960; hoar 1976; lysfjord & staurnes 1998). because the postsmolt survival was found to be correlated with ﬁsh size (table 2), our results may suggest a linkage between body size, sea water tol- erance and predator avoidance during the ﬁrst days at sea. gill na„, k„-atpase activity and sea- water tolerance has been found to be linked with downstream migration and is well developed be- fore the trout smolts leave fresh water (ugedal et al. 1998; aarestrup et al. 2000). smolt size is an important factor determining the variation in sea- water tolerance of salmonids (parry 1960; conte & wagner 1965; hoar 1976; mccormick & saunders 1987; ugedal et al. 1998). however, the ability to escape from a predator may depend also on the sensory capability, experience and swimming per- formance of the prey ﬁsh (fuiman & magurran 1994), factors that are equally linked to the size of the ﬁsh. the migratory survival of smolts and postsmolts is frequently described as positive size dependent due to selective predation on small smolts (larsson 1977; ritter 1977; valle 1985; bohlin et al. 1993; økland et al. 1993). below a reservoir, jepsen et al. (1998) found a larger mean size of wild migrat- ing trout smolts than above the reservoir, thus indi- cating size-dependent mortality. jepsen et al. (1998) also compared the survival of radio-tagged and unmarked wild trout smolts and found no dif- ferences in mortality rates during passage of the reservoir. still, however, tagging experiments may bias size-related survival, because tagging may re- duce the swimming performance of small smolts relative to large smolts (feltham & maclean 1996). therefore, the rates of predation on dom- esticated and wild smolt in the present experiment could be affected by the tagging procedure, and the predation rates may not be applicable to unmarked smolt. 181 dieperink et al. reared smolts are frequently larger than wild smolts of the same age. in ﬁeld comparisons, hvidsten & lund (1988) and aarestrup et al. (2000) found similar mortality rates in large, rear- ed smolts and in smaller, wild smolts, indicating that larger size may compensate for the domesti- cated background of the reared ﬁsh. during smolting, the migrational activity has been shown to develop concurrent with gill na„, k„-atpase activity (aarestrup et al. 2000), and it has frequently been observed that the na„, k„- atpase activity is higher in wild than in hatchery smolts (sundell et al. 1998; nielsen et al. 1999, and references therein). however, we found that the domesticated trout smolt started migrating to the sea much sooner than did the wild smolts. this was believed to be the result of active migration and not an effect of the current in the river. in the lowermost parts of the river åkjær the current velocity is relatively low (,30 cm ` s»1), and upon release no ﬁsh had problems holding position in the current. therefore, the difference in migration pattern observed was most likely due to timing of hypo-osmoregulatory ability among the two strains. we found a signiﬁcant lower predation rate among wild than domesticated smolt, a feature that may be related to many of the morphological differences that develop in cultured ﬁsh. domesti- cated ﬁsh are less exercised, more surface oriented, less able to endure sustained swimming, more ag- gressive and less experienced with predators than are wild ﬁsh (maynard et al. 1995). after release, hatchery-reared smolts are thus expected to be more vulnerable to predation than wild ﬁsh. estuarine and coastal areas may act as survival bottlenecks for the survival of migrating smolts (valle 1985; gunnerød et al. 1988; hvidsten & lund 1988; hvidsten & møkkelgjerd 1987). the actual predators involved depend on local con- ditions and include a large number of species among ﬁsh, bird, and mammals. however, rela- tively few studies have reported a direct functionel response of predators on the coastal abundance of migrating smolt (valle 1985; feltham & maclean 1996). this is probably due to the relatively low density of smolts in the coastal areas, as compared with the much higher abundance of marine ﬁsh species. in conclusion, the present results indicate that both domesticated and wild sea_trout smolts are at an elevated but transient risk of predation during the ﬁrst days in the marine environment. the results may suggest that this risk persists for a longer time in domesticated than in wild smolts and that small ﬁsh are more vulnerable than are large ﬁsh. 182 resumen las capturas comerciales y recreacionales de salmo`nidos ana´- dromos dependen en gran medida de la supervivencia durante el perı´odo de ‘‘smoltiﬁcacion’’ (transicio´n del agua dulce al mar). entre las principales causas de mortalidad de los ‘smolt’ ﬁguran la predacio´n por mamı´feros, peces y aves marinas. ex- perimentos en tanques sugieren que los smolts del salmon at- la´ntico (salmo_salar l.) estarı´an expuestos a alta predacio´n a raı´z de la tensio´n ﬁsiolo´gica que sufren durante el perı´odo de aclimatacio´n al agua de mar. la alta tensio´n ﬁsiolo´gica resulta- rı´a en un comportamiento menos eﬁcaz frente a predadores. el propo´sito del presente estudio es cuantiﬁcar y comparar la predacio´n de smolt de la trucha salvaje y cultivada (salmo trut- ta l.) despue´s de la migracio´n al mar. la predacio´n aviar en smolts salvajes y cultivados fue investigada en un ﬁordo en el mar ba´ltico occidental. cincuenta smolts salvajes y cincuenta smolts cultivados fueron marcados con radio-transmisores in- traperitoneales y soltados en un rio costero de bajo caudal. la predacio´n aviar fue registrada por la interceptacio´n de la sen˜al en una colonia de aves marinas cercana a la desemebocadura del rio. entre los 78 smolts que emigraron, 51 (65%) fueron registrados ma´s tarde en la colonia de aves. la predacio´n de smolts pequen˜os fue ma´s alta que la de smolts grandes, y fue perceptiblemente ma´s alta entre smolts cultivados que entre los salvajes. durante los primeros dos dı´as despue´s de la entrada al mar, los smolts sufrieron tasas de predacio´n elevadas (0,30 entre smolts salvajes y 0,25 ente cultivados). entre los 3 y 14 dı´as siguientes las tasas de predacio´n se redujeron (0,005 y 0,026). se sugiere que los smolts cultivados no sobreviven la transicio´n al agua de mar en la misma medida que los salvajes. los resultados apoyan la hipo´tesis de que existe un perı´odo inmediatamente posterior a la exposicio´n al agua de mar, du- rante el cual los smolts sufren una alta tasa de predacio´n. sin embargo, un aumento transitorio en mortalidad del postsmolt se puede encontrar tambie´n en agua de menos salinidad (20–23 ppt). references aarestrup, k., nielsen, c. & madsen, s.s. 2000. relationship
