streamflow; river regulation; mediterranean rivers; iberian barbel introduction seasonal cycles of flooding and drying have a major influence on patterns of habitat structure and primary productivity, which in turn influence the upper trophic levels of aquatic food webs (poff & allan 1995; poff et al. 1997; lytle & poff 2004). temporal fluctuations in trophic resources may be predictable and associated with temperature and hydrology patterns (balcombe et al. 2005). thus, it is likely that highs and lows of food availability have been a component of the natural environmental context within which riverine fishes have evolved and adapted their feeding behaviour, switching from one food to another to maintain or increase (macarthur & pianka 1966). however, relatively recent anthropo- foraging success their genic changes to riverine ecosystems have altered patterns of flow discharge, interfering with the distri- bution and abundance of organisms of lower trophic levels from which most fish derive their food (e.g. cortes et al. 2002; lucadamo et al. 2012; jones 2013). dam discharge can impact the feeding ecology of downstream biota in four distinct ways: (i) causing a physicochemical disturbance associated with the release of water from the hypolimnion, which is fre- quently nutrient rich (ward & stanford 1989); (ii) modifying the available food resources through changes in the downstream transfers of particulate organic matter (petts 1984); (iii) creating a disruption in the hydrological patterns and pulses of invertebrate drift following water releases (lauters et al. 1996);

poff & zimm- erman 2010). other among bio-ecological food habits and feeding rates of fishes have been extensively studied, but fish dietary studies in relation to spatial and seasonal variations in streamflow pat- terns are scarce and have been mainly conducted in tropical ecosystems (e.g. lowe-mcconnell 1963; agostinho et al. 2008, 2009) or australian semi-arid river basins (e.g. balcombe et al. 2005; rayner et al. 2009; pusey et al. 2010). dynamics described include, features, resource partitioning and seasonal dietary shifts related to food availability and river flows. also, there is a paucity of studies discussing the effects of altered flow regimes on fish species diet composition and feeding patterns (e.g. parker & power 1997; rolls et al. 2012). particularly in mediterranean regions, studies about the trophic ecology of fish spe- cies are more focused on the analysis of seasonal and ontogenic basal differences within the same popula- tion or river system (e.g. collares-pereira et al. 1996; gomes-ferreira et al. 2005), and there is still a large gap of knowledge about the relationship between food resource availability, fish diet and environmen- tal variation (magalh~aes 1993; mas-marti et al. 2010). mediterranean streams have a high seasonal flow and are generally exposed to a broad range of discharge conditions, including natural and regulated flow regimes (gasith & resh 1999), providing a unique opportunity for studying fish dietary varia- tions in distinct streamflow scenarios. the main objective of this study was to assess the joint influence of hydrological and food resource var- iability on the trophic ecology of freshwater fish spe- cies. first, the study included characterisation of the regional and temporal variations in food availability between permanent and temporary nonregulated river systems and assessment of how these changes are later reflected on the diet composition and feeding patterns of a typical mediterranean fish species. sec- ond, the study aimed to assess whether and how the streamflow regulation caused by two different types of dams, operating for hydroelectrical/derivation and agricultural purposes, food resources and trophic ecology of the studied species. finally, the relationship between the fish species diet and several streamflow components was also investi- gated. considering these objectives, there are a great reflected by the is 630 variety of methods to analyse and compare fish diet between different locations (e.g. gut content, stable isotopes, parasites, etc.), all of which with specific advantages and disadvantages and each one providing different perspectives for the same issue (e.g. dick et al. 2009; locke et al. 2013). however, given the potential output differences in using two or more of these methods, which would probably increase the misperception of results, we chose to analyse only gut content of the studied fish to achieve our goals, a method that has been widely used with identical pur- poses and has proven to be a quick and easy-to- apply-and-compare method for studies at large spatial scales (hyslop 1980; locke et al. 2013). this study was focused on a target species, the ibe- rian barbel (luciobarbusbocagei luciobarbus boca- gei; steindachner, 1864), which is a potamodromous cyprinid endemic to the iberian peninsula and occurs in a wide range of lotic and lentic habitats, from almost all the river basins of northern and central portugal (lobon-cervia & fernandez-delgado 1984; magalh~aes 1992). it is considered a nonthreatened species in the iberian peninsula (cabral et al. 2005). dietary patterns of this cyprinid were characterised in some previous studies (magalh~aes 1992; collares- pereira et al. 1996), according to which the species is a trophic generalist, opportunistic, that feeds predom- inantly of plant material, detritus and insect larvae, mostly dipterans and ephemeroptera. in this study, two main hypotheses are being tested: (i) barbels from both nonregulated systems will have different regional and temporal dietary pat- terns, reflecting a joint effect of distinct arrays of food resource availability and streamflow variability, and (ii) the two types of regulation will have distinct effects on food resources and, consequently, on the regional and temporal variations in the species diet in the two systems. material and methods study area for the development of this study, two types of river systems were selected, both located in the iberian peninsula, a mediterranean region with different base hydrological regimes. one of the studied systems is located in the north of the peninsula, an area with strong atlantic influence where rivers have a perma- nent flow throughout the year. the other one is located in the south of portugal, a region character- ised by a typical mediterranean-type climate with temporary flow regime (fig. 1). the river systems were selected following a criterion of minimum evi- dence of human disturbance (flow regulation aside), such as physical habitat modifications, point sources streamflow variability and fish diet fig. 1. location of the study areas in permanent and temporary systems, sampling sites (●) in the regulated and nonregulated rivers selected in each basin and respective hydrograms of mean daily discharge (m3s  1) and monthly flow volume (hm3). in the charts pre- sented, ▬ and represent, respectively, the nonregulated and regulated watercourses of each system. run-off. for of pollution or agricultural the first objective, one free-flowing watercourse was selected in each one of these catchments. in the permanent system, we selected river vez, located in river lima basin (fig. 1), with 38 km of length and a drainage area of 264 km2, characterised by high annual rainfall (1196  347 mm; mean  sd) and cooler tempera- ture (12.61  1.23 °c) (inag 2008). to act as its southern opposite, we selected river corona, located in the river sado basin, which is characterised by a predictable and accentuated pattern of river bed dry- ing that lasts from late spring until mid-autumn (fig. 1), mostly related to the low annual rainfall (587  84 mm) temperature (16.72  0.92 °c) of this southern iberian region (inag 2008). average annual flow volume is higher in river vez (371.59 hm3) than in river corona (39.78 hm3). both rivers present the same pattern of and warmer flow seasonality (fig. 1), but peak flows are higher and more frequent in river vez (average maximum daily flow of 224.30 m3s  1) than in river corona (59.68 m3s the temporary river exhibits a drier and longer summer period, in which flow normally decreases to zero, which usually never happens in the permanent river.  1). on the other hand, to achieve the second objective of this study, one more river was selected in each region, this time flow-altered systems containing dams operating for different purposes. in the permanent basin, we selected river homem, with a length of approxi- mately 49 km and a drainage area of 257 km2 (snirh 2010). since 1972, its flow is being regu- lated by vilarinho das furnas dam, which is operated mainly for water derivation. vilarinho das furnas dam has a constant hypolimnetic flow release set in order by authorities to fulfil minimum ecological 631 alexandre et al. flow requirements (efr). this dam is affecting streamflow patterns by reducing and homogenising the magnitude of the annual and monthly volumes and diminishing flow variability throughout the year. in the southern catchment, river sado was selected to act as the temporary regulated river. this river has a total length of 180 km and a drainage area of 7640 km2 (snirh 2010). since 1972, its flow is altered by monte da rocha dam, operating mainly for agricultural purposes. because of the high water demand that exists in this area, especially during the summer, these dams do not release water during most of the year. the exception is an annual release of a small amount of water (total volume of approxi- mately 10 hm3) to the downstream area in the end of spring and beginning of summer, increasing the river flow for irrigation purposes (snirh 2010). the sum of these operations causes a severe disruption on the streamflow pattern of river sado, inverting its typical pattern of dryness (fig. 1). a more detailed charac- terisation of streamflow patterns in the study areas was presented in alexandre et al. (2013). fish capture and gut content analysis in each one of the four watercourses, sampling was carried out in three sites (fig. 1) to increase the rep- resentativeness of barbel populations within each river. in each site, a sample of 10–15 fish was col- lected, using an electric fishing gear (hans grassl el 62 generator dc, 600 v), on four occasions, namely spring (may 2010), summer (august 2010), autumn (october 2010) and winter (january 2011), to account for intra-annual temporal variability. all fish samples were immediately placed on ice until they were stored at  10 °c in the laboratory. no evidence of gut evacuation was noticed during fish sampling and holding. fish capture, handling and killing proce- dures were conducted in accordance with the portu- guese legislation. some of the captured fish were classified as juveniles (undifferentiated gonads) but were not accounted for further analyses due to their low number. therefore, a total of 267 adult barbels (males and females with differentiated gonads) were analysed in the laboratory. fish were measured (total body length, lt, to the nearest mm) and weighed (total body mass, wt, to the nearest 0.01 g). after complete removal of viscera, the fish were weighed (eviscerated body mass, we, to the nearest 0.01 g). as cyprinids lack a differentiated stomach, all gut contents were extracted and examined under a a 509 magnification. dissecting microscope food items were initially identified to the lowest readily recognizable level, weighted taxonomic at table 1. broad food categories and respective frequency of occurrence (fo;

collares-pereira et al. 1996), namely invertebrates, organic matter in the substrate and two types of vegetation, the strictly aquatic vegetation (hydrophytes) and the emergent plants usually associated with riverine environments (henceforth called as macrophytes). six replicate samples of invertebrate benthic fauna were collected in each site/season using a dip/kick sampling net (mesh size: 500 lm; width: 0.25 m) by holding the net against the river and dragging it for a standar- dised length of 1 m while disturbing the adjacent substrate. invertebrate samples were preserved in 96% ethanol and later sorted at the laboratory. organ- isms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, counted and assigned to the same invertebrate groups defined for the gut samples. for estimating the quantity of organic matter in the substrate in each site/season, six sediment samples were also collected for each river/season combination (samples were used as replicates in the following analyses), placed in ice and latter frozen at  10 °c in the laboratory. organic matter content (omc; %) was obtained from the reduction in weight of a 100 g (dry weight) portion of sediment, after ignition at 500 °c during a 24-h period. occupation percentage by hydrophytes and macrophytes was visually estimated for each site/sea- son, always by the same operator, and included in classes: 0–20%, 20–40%, one of 40–60%, 60–80% and 80–100%. five ordinal data analysis for the analyses conducted in this study, all assump- tions for the use of appropriate parametric methodol- ogies were previously tested, and in case of nonfulfilment even after suitable data transformation, the equivalent nonparametric analysis was employed. invertebrates the overall density (number of individuals m2) and diversity (shannon-wiener index, h) of invertebrates were determined for each replicate (each benthic trawl in each river/season combination), and a two- way anova (river and season as fixed factors), followed by a post hoc gabriel test for multiple com- parisons, was applied to test for differences in these parameters between rivers and sampling seasons. streamflow variability and fish diet density was also determined separately for each invertebrate taxon identified, and a two-way permano- va design, conducted with the add-on package perma- nova for primer+v6.0 (anderson et al. 2008), was applied to statistically compare the community com- position between rivers and sampling seasons within. these analyses were followed by a test of dissimilari- ties percentage (simper) to determine which taxa contributed the most to the differences observed. for this multivariate analysis, invertebrate taxa that occurred in <5% of the benthic trawl replicates and trawls with null abundances were previously removed to reduce bias in our data. organic matter and vegetation the regional and temporal patterns of omc variation were assessed using a kruskal–wallis test (kw; v2), with a simultaneous test procedure (stp) (siegel & castellan 1988) for multiple comparisons between rivers and sampling seasons within whenever signifi- cant differences were found. the same statistical pro- cedure was used to compare the occupation percentage by hydrophytes and macrophytes (both introduced as ordinal variables) between rivers and sampling seasons. fish diet fullness a two-way permanova analysis was used to test fish size differences between river/population membership and sampling seasons. mean gut (total weight of gut contents relative to fish eviscerated weight) and the vacuity index (total number of empty guts relative to the total number of guts in the sam- ple) were used to analyse the differences in the feed- ing activity patterns of the studied barbel populations (hyslop 1980). mean trophic diversity of the sampled barbels and its intra-annual variation were calculated according to the shannon-wiener diversity index, which provides an objective indication of niche breadth. kruskal–wallis tests, followed by stp pro- cedures, were applied to statistically compare these three indexes between rivers and sampling seasons. diet composition was evaluated by calculating the weight proportion (%) of each food item relative to the total weight of gut content for each fish specimen analysed. a two-way permanova design, followed by a simper procedure, was applied to test for differ- ences in diet composition among rivers and sampling seasons and identify which items were responsible for the dissimilarities found. the strauss’ linear index of food selectivity (strauss 1979), based on counts of numerical items found in the environment (pi) and in the stomach contents (ri), was used to compare the barbels’ diet with the availability of the 633 alexandre et al. potential food resources in rivers and along sampling seasons. this analysis was only performed for the most abundant (on both gut and environment) numer- ical items, namely the same invertebrate items that were previously considered for diet composition analysis, reducing the focus on specific selectivity for low-abundant items. a one-sample student’s t-test (against a constant 0) was used to test selectivity ran- domness. barbels feeding strategy for each river/sea- son was determined using costello’s (1990) graphical method, modified by amundsen et al. (1996). this method classifies the species prey selection behaviour by plotting the frequency of occurrence (fo), omitting empty guts, and the prey-specific abundance (pi), defined as the percentage a prey taxon contributes to all prey items in only those fish in which the actual  1, where pi is prey occurs: pi = 100 9 (∑si 9 ∑sii) the prey-specific abundance of prey i, si the gut con- tent (in this case, weight) comprised of prey i and sii the total gut content in only those fish that consumed prey i. this graphical representation determines prey importance (rare prey will be located near the lower left corner of the graph and dominant prey near the upper right corner) and also the feeding strategy (most points at the bottom of the graph reflect gener- alisation, and most points at the top reflect specialisa- tion). the relationship between feeding strategy and the between- or within-phenotype contributions to the niche width is also represented. the lower right rep- resents a high within-phenotype component, and the upper left represents a high between-phenotype com- ponent. for this analysis, all food categories were considered with the exception of the ones that were absent from gut contents in a specific river/season and of the unidentified items, which were omitted from the respective chart for clarity purposes. individuals with empty stomachs were removed from diet composition, selectivity and strategy analy- ses, and the first one was only conducted for food items that were present in > 5% of the analysed guts. streamflow streamflow analysis was performed using the meth- odology iarhis 2.2, developed by santa-maria & yuste (2010), complemented with a time series analysis (tsa) within the river analysis package (rap version 1.3.0; marsh et al. 2006), on 30-year time series for each river obtained from the portu- guese environment agency (apa, i.p) database (snirh 2010). from these analyses, we calculated 27 monthly hydrologic metrics. initial screening (spearman rank correlation, rho) showed strong cor- relation between many of these metrics (above a cut- off value of 0.80), so to minimise redundancy among predictors, when two variables were considered to be strongly correlated, one of them was discarded, usu- ally the less ecologically meaningful (santa-maria & yuste 2010), until 10 final metrics (table 2) were selected. water temperature is also one of the main abiotic factors influencing life cycles of freshwater fish, and at the same time, changes in natural thermal regimes may be as important as altered streamflows to the ecological impacts of dam operations (olden & naiman 2010). during study area selection, we tried that rivers and sampling sites had the minimum abi- otic and biophysical dissimilarities so that the only factor affecting resources and diet were streamflow differences. however, considering the importance of temperature in mediterranean ecosystems and the strong thermal amplitude between different areas within this region (gasith & resh 1999), we decided to include mean monthly temperature (obtained with data loggers water temp pro v2 from hobo during study period; table 2) to the following streamflow versus diet analyses to evaluate its joint effect with flow in the intra-annual variation of diet composition and indexes. redundancy analysis (rda) was applied to deter- mine which of and how the 10 monthly streamflow variables previously selected, plus temperature, were table 2. streamflow and temperature variables, and respective range of values for each studied river, selected from the flow time series analyses and registered in the field (only temperature) to assess its relationship with barbels’ diet composition and feeding activity patterns. range of values (minimum–maximum) streamflow variables (unit) code river vez river homem river corona river sado monthly volume (hm3) no of high-flow days (days) flow variability (q10%–q90%) no of null flow days (days) duration of high spell peaks (days) magnitude of low spell troughs (ms duration of low spell troughs (days) period between low spells (days) duration of falls (days) baseflow (ms mean monthly temperature (°c)  3)  3) monthvol hflowdays var zflowdays dhspelpeak lspeltrough dlspeltrough pblspel dfalls bsflow temp 2.56–61.72 0.00–2.20 1.30–2.21 0.00–4.58 0.00–3.12 0.00–0.39 0.00–17.76 0.00–13.00 6.32–13.89 0.43–0.78 10.61–22.20 1.65–10.75 0.00–0.00 0.47–1.67 0.00–0.00 0.00–8.27 0.00–0.47 0.00–12.27 0.00–6.50 4.97–9.31 0.62–0.84 11.04–20.06 0.00–2.82 0.00–2.80 1.70–17.29 0.00–17.14 0.00–5.46 0.00–0.00 0.00–23.08 0.00–16.13 5.66–12.34 0.29–0.37 12.01–23.01 0.77–2.44 0.00–4.40 0.87–2.22 0.00–2.95 0.00–11.44 0.02–0.05 1.00–23.20 0.00–4.00 2.47–6.39 0.54–0.71 12.04–24.44 634 related to the variability of barbels’ diet composition (mean weight percentage for each dietary item within each river/season) in both studied systems and sam- pling seasons within. rda is a canonical ordination technique that extends principal component analysis (pca) to explain the variation in attributes (dietary items frequency in this case) using a matrix of poten- tial explanatory variables (flow and temperature), with an expected linear relationship between both groups, while preserving the euclidean distance among the objects (legendre & legendre 1998). with the statistical program canoco 4.5, this analysis was performed a first time to select the sig- nificantly related variables, using a forward stepwise method, with a probability value for entering of 0.05. the model was tested a second time through a monte carlo global permutation test (999 permutations) to assess the significance of both the first and all ordina- tion axes. less abundant and frequent dietary items (fo <5%), as well as individuals with empty stom- achs, were not considered in this analysis. stepwise multiple linear regressions were used to relate the flow and temperature variables to barbels’ feeding activity and diversity indexes. all statistical analyses described before, with the exception of permanova and rda, were conducted with r package (v3.0.1, r development core team, vienna, austria). results food resources overall omc showed only significant differences (kw;

(1996), for the food categories of barbels’ diet in the studied nonregulat- ed and regulated rivers from both systems and across sampling seasons within. food categories that were absent from gut contents in a spe- cific river/season combination and unidentified items were omitted from the respective chart for clarity purposes. dlspeltroughs increase. consumption of decapoda also increases during these periods, especially in the temporary watercourses. rda2 separates most of the nonregulated river/season combinations from the reg- ulated ones, especially spring and winter seasons, revealing a higher consumption of invertebrate and idet items in free-flowing rivers from both basins, which are characterised by higher hflowdays and var, and a greater consumption of wdet and plant in the two altered watercourses associated with higher values of dhspelpeak. the regression analysis between feeding activity and diversity indexes and abiotic variables (table 4) revealed a positive relationship between barbels’ full- ness index and dhspelpeak. vacuity index was sig- nificantly and positively related to zflowdays and negatively with lspeltrough. diet diversity of bar- bels significantly increased with an increase in lspeltrough and bsflow. temperature was not selected by any of the regression procedures, neither by the rda of diet composition, indicating a stron- ger effect of streamflow components on barbels’ die- tary patterns. discussion overall results show that barbels from both nonregu- lated rivers were essentially omnivorous, without 640 particular preference for any specific item, having a generalist diet composed mainly of detritus, plants and invertebrate larvae, similar to what has already been described in other studies dealing with the same, or similar, species (e.g. encina & granado- lorencio 1990; magalh~aes 1992; collares-pereira et al. 1996). such a generalist and omnivore foraging behaviour is frequently observed in highly variable environments, such as the mediterranean ones, where food resources are not predictably available and fish take advantage of whatever food is accessible (pusey et al. 2010). in the overall availability of barbels from the northern permanent river exhib- ited mostly a generalist behaviour, although having a higher proportion of invertebrates in their diet, espe- cially diptera and ephemeroptera. southern barbels showed a high degree of selectivity for plant material and detritus. these results can be related to the differ- ences some food resources found in this study, namely a higher abun- dance of mot in the temporary nonregulated river and the higher density and diversity of some specific and important invertebrate items in the permanent watercourse. the importance of detritus and plant material has been highlighted for the diet of other native iberian species, particularly cyprinids (gomes- ferreira et al. 2005; santos et al. 2013), as these materials often represent the most available and streamflow variability and fish diet summer and autumn. temporal variability of fish diets can indicate changes in prey resources at both seasonal and diel scales (balcombe & humphries 2006), and the ingestion of plant and detritus may represent an alternative resource, buffering the sea- sonal scarcity of animal food resources (persson 1983), which appeared to be the case in our study. plant material and organic matter are usually found in great density in mediterranean streams during summer and autumn months due to algae and mac- rophytic blooms and to the import of leaves and other plant material from tree canopies (kraiem 1980). diet switching from higher- to lower-energy prey as food resources decline is a common strategy used by generalist fish to persist through harsh peri- ods (balcombe et al. 2005; balcombe & humphries 2006). bluegill describing similar patterns of temporal variability of food resources and diet composition across an intra-annual range of streamflow conditions have been stated by some authors for other species and type of rivers. when (lepomismacrochirus, rafinesque, 1819) diet, kitchell & windell (1970) found that it is mainly composed of invertebrates in spring, with a subsequent switch to an algal-domi- nated diet by the end of summer as invertebrate num- bers fell. also, in an australian intermittent stream similar to our temporary river, closs (1994) found that galaxiids consumed greater amounts of terrestrial food resources, such as organic matter or vegetation, when flow ceased during summer promoting the disappear- ance of drifting invertebrates. more recently, in the iberian peninsula, santos et al. (2013) found that in the diet of the portuguese ruivaco (achondrostomaoli- golepis, robalo, doadrio, almada & kottelat 2005), the contribution of detritus and plants was highest in summer and autumn with virtually no consumption of animal prey items, which increased in spring. 641 fig. 7. redundancy analysis (rda) biplot representing the relationship between barbels’ diet composition (mean weight

(magalh~aes 1992). temporal patterns of diet composition and forag- ing behaviour appeared to be strongly mediated by streamflow and food resource variability between periods of high and low flow. consumption of invertebrates increased with monthly volume, during spring and winter in the permanent river, but in the temporary one, this phenomenon was only observed in the latter season. other authors had found similar results, describing a positive correlation between increasing flow velocity and invertebrate consump- tion by fish, probably resulting from the increase in invertebrate drift rates during high streamflow peri- ods (romero et al. 2005; harvey et al. 2006; blan- chet et al. 2008). in both rivers, these preys were almost completely replaced by plants and detritus in alexandre et al. in this study, the temporal pattern of diet composi- tion and foraging behaviour responded to the highly variable availability of food resources, particularly in relation to varying hydrology, and was indeed a dif- ferentiating factor between both systems but not quite as it was initially expected. the population inhabiting the temporary river presented lower intra-annual vari- ation in its diet, following a similar pattern of food resource availability. these differences could be related to the annual streamflow pattern that usually occurs in the two rivers. contrarily to northern per- manent rivers, where spring and winter are associated with intense peak flows, in typical mediterranean temporary rivers such as the studied one, spring flow can be very low and sometimes longitudinal connec- tivity is lost early in the season (gasith & resh 1999), turning it environmentally similar to summer and autumn. northern barbels showed lower intra-annual varia- tion in their feeding activity indexes. gut fullness was much less variable in the permanent river and was positively related to the duration of high spell peaks. proportion of empty stomachs increased dur- ing autumn in the permanent river population and in spring/summer in the temporary one following the number of null flow days. temporal variability in gut fullness has already been described for the same spe- cies (collares-pereira et al. 1996) and reflects some seasonal discontinuities in barbels’ feeding activity that probably are more accentuated in the variable temporary system. high empty stomach percentages can indicate frequent short-duration negative energy balances and may be related to the intake of large items with high energy content that are probably more accessible during long periods of low water level, typical of temporary rivers, such as larger plant material, detritus and animal preys like decapoda (rhodes & holdich 1984; arrington et al. 2002). diet diversity was higher in sites/seasons with high- flow volume, like spring and winter in permanent riv- ers, probably following a similar increase in drifting invertebrates’ diversity and other allochthonous resources (agostinho et al. 2008). in summary, the first hypothesis of this study was corroborated, and the two populations have indeed presented regional and temporal differences in their dietary patterns, mediated by specific food resource and streamflow variability between the two ecosystems. so, what happens when these populations are subjected to sig- nificant anthropogenic streamflow alterations caused by dam operation? in the northern system, food resource abundance and barbels’ diet were similar between the two rivers, but several differences were noted when considering their intra-annual pattern of variation. from all the potential food items, only the proportion of organic 642 matter in the substrate showed temporal variability within the regulated river, significantly increasing in spring, which is typical in rivers receiving nutrient- rich hypolimnetic releases from dams, like this one (parker & power 1997). while barbels from the non- regulated permanent river increased their specialisa- tion for invertebrates during spring and winter, associated with a flow increase, barbels from the reg- ulated watercourse maintained a similar, generalised, diet throughout the year. the hydrological changes caused by this type of dam, particularly those related to flood peak reductions and delays, have consider- able downstream effects on the life cycles of fish spe- cies (agostinho et al. 2004). natural water-level oscillations and spilling directly influence floodplain surface area exposed to flooding, which should increase habitat area and the availability of shelter and allochthonous food sources, providing water enrichment with nutrients carried from newly wetted adjacent areas (svanback & bolnick 2007; agostinho et al. 2008). in the northern regulated river, these peak flows are generally diminished and less fre- quent, reducing invertebrate drift and availability of fish, and leaving barbels with a poorer and less vari- able diet. fullness, vacuity and diet diversity indexes were globally similar between both rivers but had distinct temporal patterns of variation. while barbels from the nonregulated river had similar gut fullness throughout the year, in the regulated river, barbels presented fuller guts during autumn. in the regulated river, barbels also showed lower and more stable pro- portion of empty stomachs, meaning that a high num- ber of fish were constantly feeding throughout the year. places with low streamflow variability and without flood pulses changing the available habitat can maintain a higher concentration of resources, especially organic matter and plant material, which are easily consumed (piana et al. 2006). diet diver- sity was constant in the nonregulated river but signif- icantly decreased during spring in the regulated one, which can be explained by the absence of natural spring high flows, which reduces the effect that sub- strate scour has on invertebrate diversity, while facili- tating detritus accumulation (fuller et al. 2011), contributing to a reduction in barbel dietary breadth. within the southern system, the regulated river pre- sented a higher abundance of macrophytes and inver- tebrates in the environment, which may result from the hypolimnetic discharge by the upstream dam in the end of spring, which is usually eutrophic, deoxy- genated and of bad quality, benefiting plant growth and affecting less tolerant animal species, reducing, for example, invertebrate diversity and increasing the abundance of taxa adapted to harsh environments (brittain & saltveit 1989; cortes et al. 2002). thus, barbels from the temporary regulated river were even more specialised in plants and detritus throughout the year, and invertebrates were constantly of reduced importance, even in winter. because the important hydrological variability between high and low flows is diminished and baseflows are maintained through- out the dry season in the regulated temporary river, habitats in the main channel are never separated into isolated pools even under the driest conditions. avail- ability of resources may not reach the critical lows documented for drier systems, diminishing temporal changes in food web and related omnivorous behav- iour (lowe-mcconnel 1987; arthington et al. 2005). proportion of barbels with empty stomachs was con- stantly lower throughout the year in the regulated river, whereas increased in spring and summer in the nonregulated one, which is clearly associated with the higher and more stable abundance of food resources in the regulated, more homogeneous, envi- ronment (parker & power 1997). in the nonregulated temporary river, barbels’ dietary breadth increased in winter, associated with an increase in flow volume and invertebrate availability and consumption, but barbels from the regulated river maintained a similar and reduced diet diversity, related to the artificially increased environmental stability and the absence of prolonged floods that increase the input of allochtho- nous nutrients and invertebrate drift and abundance (agostinho et al. 2008). in light of these results, our second hypothesis was also partially corroborated. both types of flow regulation resulted in changes in barbels’ dietary patterns, and some of the studied aspects even had slightly different responses consid- ering the type of dam or system considered. how- ever, we could not find clear evidences that each type of dam was affecting diet components in their own specific way. indeed, rda showed that, in both sys- tems, variation in diet composition between nonregu- lated and regulated watercourses was particularly mediated by the same two variables, namely dhspel- peak and especially flow variability (var), reinforc- ing these components in the definition of minimal flows (petts 1984; peake 2008). in the two studied cases of regu- lation, variability between low- and high-flow periods was strongly reduced. particularly in the temporary system, dam discharges softened the drought season environment, which is usually described as one of the most important structuring factors in this type of streams (gasith & resh 1999). importance the this study provides important insights about the diet of a common cyprinid species from the mediter- ranean region in distinct hydrological contexts and its relationship with natural and anthropogenic stream- flow variability. investigation into the relationship between flow variability and its impacts on fish food webs could result flow in better management of of accounting for streamflow variability and fish diet releases to minimise the impact on fish food resources and subsequent diet (balcombe & humphries 2006). acknowledgements the
