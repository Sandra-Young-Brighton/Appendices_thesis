mm; me- dium‰100–199 mm; large‰200–299 mm total length) of juvenile short- ﬁnned (‘‘shortﬁn’’) eels (anguilla australis) and longﬁnned (‘‘longﬁn’’) eels (a. dieffenbachii) was tested in a laboratory ﬂow tank over a 48-h period during summer. all size groups of both species were nocturnally active, with the eels hiding in the substratum during the day and coming out on top of the cobbles from dusk to dawn, to feed. during the foraging period, the numbers and activity of all sizes of longﬁns visible were greater than those seen of shortﬁns, with the differences being more pronounced for small and medium eels. the activity of all eels consisted mostly of foraging by crawling, searching and probing for prey among the cobbles. rate of activity increased with size of eel for both species. small eels of either species did more swimming than eels of the larger sizes, whereas large eels were observed more frequently with only their head out of the substrate than were the smaller individuals. feeding of small eels within the interstitial spaces of the streambed may explain their signiﬁcantly lower activity on top of the substrate at night. the signiﬁcantly lower rate of activity recorded for shortﬁns than longﬁns of all sizes may be due partly to their ability to feed within the interstices of the stream bed, and (or) longer time to recover from handling and habituate to the test environment. key words: juvenile eels; shortﬁnned; longﬁnned; diel activity; nocturnal; foraging; ﬂow tank g. j. glova, national institute of water & atmospheric research ltd,

of freshwater eels in new zealand, the shortﬁnned (‘‘shortﬁn’’) anguilla aus- tralis and longﬁnned (‘‘longﬁn’’) a. dieffenbachii, are widespread and frequently occur in the same streams, although the shortﬁn tends to occupy the sluggish lower reaches and the longﬁn the faster ﬂowing water further inland (mcdowall 1990). the larger individuals of both species are primarily nocturnally active, and accordingly their commer- cial and customary ﬁsheries are based on overnight capture. several new zealand studies have pro- vided indirect evidence of nocturnal activity in eels from an examination of food in their guts at differ- ent times of the day and catch rates. ryan (1984) found that shortﬁns in a large, turbid lake had the greatest amount of food in their guts towards dawn. similar ﬁndings have been reported (sa- gar & glova 1994, 1998) for both species of eel in small, clear water streams. in addition, jellyman & ryan (1983) reported signiﬁcantly greater fyke-net catches of elvers (mostly shortﬁns) moving into a small coastal lake at night, with peaks at dusk and dawn. similarly, jellyman & chisnall (1999) ob- tained signiﬁcantly greater trawl catches of juven- ile shortﬁns in a large lake during the night, par- ticularly during a new moon phase. moreover, in a series of cover preference tests on both species of juvenile eel in replicate channels, glova (1999) noted that eels remained hidden in preferred cover during the day and moved about during the night. adherence to being nocturnally active appears to be less pronounced among very young eels. for 210 example, sagar & glova (1998) found that short- ﬁns .200 mm in length fed exclusively during the night, but for smaller eels the pattern was less dis- tinct, with some feeding occurring during the day, presumably within the interstices of the cobbles, as eels avoid bright light. unfortunately, juvenile longﬁns were not abundant in their study stream, and so this size-related phenomenon in activity was not conﬁrmed for this species. to validate the existence of size-related diel (24- h period) activity patterns in juvenile shortﬁn and longﬁn eels more precisely, a series of experiments was undertaken in a laboratory ﬂow tank to moni- tor eel activity on a 24-h basis. three size groups (small‰,100 mm; medium‰100–199 mm; large‰ 200–299 mm total length (tl)) of both species of eel were chosen for study. these size groups differ to quite an extent in their habitat associations (glova et al. 1998), diel feeding patterns (sagar & glova 1998) and daytime cover preferences (glova 1999). the hypothesis tested in the present study was that overall rate of activity would be similar for both species, with small eels being the least ac- tive above the substratum because they largely for- age within the interstices of the bed. methods flow tank set-up the ﬂow tank used was that described by biggs & thomsen (1995), which was a modiﬁed version of the earlier model used by lacoursie´re & craig (1990). brieﬂy, the tank was made of 16-mm-thick plexiglas with the test section being 1.0 m long(cid:192)0.4 m wide(cid:192)0.2 m deep, which was divided equally into pool and rifﬂe, with the rifﬂe being 0.12 m deep with a raised plexiglas bottom (fig. 1). the bottom of the test section was painted mat black and lined with a 80-mm thick mixture of ﬁnes, gravels (size range 8–32 mm) and cobbles (45–64 mm) taken from the channel of one of the streams used for eel and benthic invertebrate col- lections in this study. cobbles are preferred as day- time cover by eels of this size range (glova 1999). on average, cobbles in the rifﬂe were slightly larger than in the pool. the tank was run with untreated, high-quality aquifer water, partly recirculated, with a continual inﬂow and outﬂow providing a complete water turn-over about six times daily. the ﬂow was driven by two motor boat propellers (170 mm diameter), powered by a 3-hp motor with precise digital control of belt speed and hence water velocity. average water velocities in all ex- periments were 0.05 m ` s»1 and 0.15 m ` s»1 in the pool and rifﬂe, respectively. a water temperature recorder was installed in the well down stream of the pool, with readings taken at 15-min intervals. size-related differences in diel activity to facilitate monitoring of eel activity, the top of the tank was open and extended mesh sides were installed for containing eels. to monitor the activity of eels round the clock during the two-day observation period, three infra- red-sensitive cameras (one each centered over the rifﬂe and pool and the third positioned side-on to the pool) were hooked up to a sequential switcher which was connected to a time-lapse video, and thence to a monitor (fig. 1). the sequential switcher apportioned the time (approximately 40 s per interval) equally between the three cameras. two infrared lights, one located at the upstream end of the test section and the other obliquely over the pool, provided the necessary lighting to record eel activity at night. natural light coming through an outside window (shades were partially drawn) provided the day/night cycle during the period of study. the possibility of incidental light coming in from other laboratory activities was excluded by black plastic. a light meter was run for part of the time to determine times of sunset and sunrise, so that sampling intervals for decoding of eel activity could be established in relation to these events. no account was taken of the lunar phase during the period of study. eel collection

study. they were sorted by size and transferred to live boxes placed in raceways with ﬂowing water at the silverstream research station, where they were fed twice weekly an ample supply of stream invert- ebrates (mostly larval midges, mayﬂies, stoneﬂies and caddisﬂies). test procedure in the experimental series, each of the three size groups of both species of eel was tested once, and then medium longﬁns were tested an additional two times to obtain an indication of the variability of juvenile eel behavior. time precluded replication of experimental tests for all sizes of both species; moreover, the extended time required would have increased the likelihood of temperature induced changes in eel activity. the variability in the behav- ior of medium longﬁns was assumed to be repre- sentative of all eels tested. all tests were conducted between 18 march and 26 april 1998, during which time water temperature in the ﬂow tank ranged from 17.5 to 20.5(cid:190)c and diel range was ,20c. the required number of eels in any one test varied with size of eel: small‰20; medium‰10; and large‰6; these numbers were roughly in pro- portion to the size distribution of wild eel popula- tions. on day one, the required number of eels was transferred from live boxes to the ﬂow tank and allowed two days to habituate to the test space be- fore their activity was monitored. a given aliquot of freshly caught stream invertebrates was added to the upstream end shortly after the eels were re- leased into the tank. on day three at 0800 h (all times reported are new zealand standard time), the time-lapse video was activated to record for the next 48 hours onto a 3-hour tape. at the end of the recording period, the ﬂow was stopped, a perspex divider was ﬁtted between the rifﬂe and pool sec- tions, and the water was then drained from the tank. the substrates were removed from each sec- tion and placed in separate bins, while carefully looking for ﬁsh. following the removal of eels from each section, they were lightly anaesthetised, measured, and returned to the wild. as soon as the eels were removed, the substrates were returned to the ﬂow tank, and it was reﬁlled with water for the next experiment. data analysis in decoding the information from tapes, it was necessary ﬁrst to establish the daily pattern of eel activity to decide what proportion of the total rec- ord would give representative results. in doing so, the ﬁrst 24 hours of the ﬁrst replicate for medium longﬁns was viewed in consecutive 10-min blocks. the activity of all eels seen in the pool and rifﬂe with the two cameras from above was recorded onto standardized data forms; the camera side-on to the pool was only used to verify whether eels were crawling on the bottom or free-swimming. eels seen were recorded as ‘‘partly out’’ or ‘‘com- pletely out’’ of the substrate. for those ‘‘partly out’’, no activity was recorded, only noting whether the head or tail end was out. for eels fig. 2.

end of each test. plots of mean activity per eel (all behaviors com- bined) were compiled by species and size of eel, including the replicates for medium longﬁns. the proportional frequencies of total activity in the pool and rifﬂe for the full 48-h period were tabulated by species and size, and differences in the actual frequencies within and between species by size were tested by chi-square (zar 1984). the frequencies of total activity by species and size were tallied separately for 20-min intervals during dusk (1740–1940 h), night (1940–0440 h), dawn (0440–0640 h), and day (0640–1740 h) periods for each of the two days of monitoring of eel behavior. differences in the mean values of ac- tivity for the given number of 20-min observations between dusk (n‰6), night (n‰11) and dawn (n‰ 6) periods for each species by size were tested by kruskal-wallis one-way analysis of variance (sieg- el 1956). on the other hand, differences between species within size groups were tested by mann- whitney u test (siegel 1956) for each of the three time periods (i.e., dusk, night and dawn). frequencies of the different behaviors (as listed above) by species and size during dusk, night, dawn and day periods were tallied by 20-min inter- vals on a per eel basis, and the differences between species by size were tested in pairs by the kolmo- gorov-smirnov two-sample test. results general swimming, ‘‘completely out’’, activity was recorded as still, crawling, foraging, or aggression. brieﬂy, these behaviors were deﬁned as follows. crawling, was moving slowly and included move- ment against the downstream screen in the pool. swimming, was moving quickly and not actively searching on the bottom. foraging, involved the body being fully visible, with the eel actively mov- ing, searching (e.g., probing betweeen stones with rostrum) or capturing prey on the cobbles. ag- gression involved either nipping or chasing another eel. the frequency of occurrence of ‘‘partly’’ and ‘‘completely out’’ events for this test group of eels was tallied and plotted over time (fig. 2), showing a pronounced diel pattern of activity commencing at dusk and continuing to dawn. henceforth, the activity of eels for all tests was decoded for the times designated in table 1; at twilight (dusk and dawn) the full 2-h period was included, whereas at all other times the activity was recorded hourly on the hour for 20 min (two consecutive 10-min periods). for comparative purposes, activity was reported on a per eel basis by dividing total activ- eels of any size were rarely seen out of the gravels and cobbles during the day. an indication of their preferred day-time cover in the ﬂow tank was ob- tained from the numbers retrieved in the pool and rifﬂe at the end of the experiments (table 2). the major difference between species was that small longﬁns preferred the pool, whereas small shortﬁns preferred the rifﬂe. medium eels of both species preferred the pool. large longﬁns showed no pref- erence, but comparable-sized shortﬁns preferred the rifﬂe. table 2. proportions of eels in pool and rifﬂe of the ﬂow tank at end of each of the experiments. results for medium longﬁns are based

than in the rifﬂe (table 3). excluding large longﬁns, 60–77% of the activity of all eels took place in the pool. diel activity patterns plots of mean activity of eels by size (i.e., all behav- ior types combined for the 48-h period) show con- siderable differences between species, as well as within species (fig. 3). although both species were primarily active between dusk and dawn, longﬁns of all sizes were more active than shortﬁns, with small and medium eels being the least active of all. however, differences in rate of activity between species were not signiﬁcant (p.0.05) for small eels at dawn, whereas all other interspeciﬁc differences were signiﬁcant (table 4). for both days, the activity of small longﬁns was greatest at dusk and declined over night to a low by dawn (fig. 3); however, the differences in activ- ity between time periods from dusk to dawn were not signiﬁcant (table 4). a similar diel pattern of activity was exhibited by medium longﬁns for 50% of the plots, but for the remaining plots activity peaked during the night rather than at dusk (fig. 3); for all replicates combined, the differences be- tween time periods from dusk to dawn were sig- niﬁcant (p,0.001; table 4). the pattern of diel ac- tivity for medium longﬁns was consistent between replicates, although variable in magnitude, with rate of activity declining signiﬁcantly (p,0.001) between the ﬁrst and third replicates (fig. 3). the rate of activity of large longﬁns differed signiﬁ- cantly (p,0.001; table 4) between dusk and dawn, with a peak in activity during the night; however, they were appreciably less active at dusk on day 1 than day 2. table 4. summary of statistical signiﬁcances of the differences in total activity of juvenile longﬁns (lf) and shortﬁns (sf) by size in the

differences in diel activity curred more frequently than tail-out for both spe- cies, particularly among large eels. with the excep- tion of large longﬁns, eels completely out of the substratum were rarely lying still on the bottom. swimming was not a major activity of any size, although it was more common among small eels of both species. aggression was rarely recorded. differences in frequencies of the more com- monly elicited behaviors expressed on a per eel basis were tested between species by size for each of the four time periods (i.e., dusk, night, dawn, day) in the diel cycle (table 5). as longﬁns were more active than shortﬁns, it is not surprising that signiﬁcant differences were attributed to the greater activity of longﬁns. medium longﬁns did signiﬁcantly (p,0.001) more crawling and forag- ing than did shortﬁns from dusk to dawn. in con- trast, the difference in foraging activity between large juveniles of these two species was only sig- niﬁcant (p,0.05) at dawn. during the night, large longﬁns were more often lying still on the bottom than shortﬁns (p,0.01). in addition, medium and large longﬁns were more frequently on the bottom with only their heads out of the substratum than were shortﬁns (p,0.001 to 0.05). none of the interspeciﬁc differences in behavioral frequencies for small eels was signiﬁcant. discussion daily activity of eels a diel periodicity in the activity of juvenile shortﬁn and longﬁn eel populations was clearly evident in the results of this study. although rate of activity varied considerably with size and species of eel, all sizes of both species remained in the cobbles dur- ing the day and came out at night to a varying degree to explore their surroundings and search for food. the marked diel pattern in the activity of these two species of eel parallels that reported for other species of freshwater anguillids. for example, several laboratory and ﬁeld studies have demon- strated that locomotor activity is nocturnal in the american eel a. rostrata (bohun & winn 1966; edel 1976, 1979; helfman et al. 1983; sorensen et al. 1986) and european eel a. anguilla (van veen et al. 1976; westin & nyman 1979; baras et al. 1998). the pattern common to both species was that locomotor activity peaked after dusk, then progressively declined, and always ended before sunrise. this daily pattern of activity is not greatly dissimilar to that obtained for eels in the present study. light-dark conditions are not the only stimuli known to inﬂuence the daily activity cycle of eels. dutil et al. in tracking ultrasonically- tagged american eels in an estuary in the gulf of (1988), 215 fig. 4. plots of the proportions of total activity by behavior type for small, medium and large longﬁns (open bars) and shortﬁns (closed bars). the plot for medium longﬁns is based on data for all three replicates. behavioral categories are: 1‰ head out only; 2‰tail out only; 3‰still (motionless); 4‰crawl- ing; 5‰swimming; 6‰foraging; 7‰aggression. as both small and medium shortﬁns were not very active during the night, the diel pattern was not pronounced (fig. 3). nonetheless, the differ- ences in activity between time periods from dusk to dawn were signiﬁcant (p,0.01) for medium eels, but not small eels (table 4). in contrast, large shortﬁns showed a more pronounced diel pattern of activity, with a distinct increase occurring at dusk and continuing through to dawn (fig. 3). however, their rate of activity differed signiﬁcantly (p,0.001) between dusk and dawn, with the lowest level occurring at dusk on day 1. behavioral considerations crawling and foraging were the most frequent be- haviors of all sizes of both species of eel (fig. 4). for eels partly out of the substratum, head-out oc-

night during both low and high tides, they were more active during daytime high tides than nighttime low tides and during ﬂood tides, particu- larly at night. it appears that high tide levels can override the inﬂuence of nighttime on eel activity in tidal areas. in addition, lunar phase, rainfall, and water level have been reported (jellyman 1991; baras et al. 1998) to have some effect on the activ- ity of eels. a marked crepuscular pattern of activity, as noted, for example, in migrating elvers in lake pounui (jellyman & ryan 1983), was not evident in the ﬁndings of our study. peaks in elver mi- gration at dusk and dawn may be related to orien- tation at low light levels and, therefore, are not comparable to activity in a ﬂow tank. in the pres- ent study, small longﬁns, and frequently medium longﬁns, were most active at dusk, but in no other instance was there distinct evidence of a crepuscu- lar pattern. similarly, sagar & glova (1998) found no evidence of crepuscular feeding among juvenile shortﬁns in the wild, although feeding clearly be- gan on dusk and continued through the night, with small and medium eels continuing to feed to a mi- nor extent after dawn. intraspeciﬁc size-related differences in activity we hypothesized that the activity of small eels (,100 mm long) of both species in the ﬂow tank would be less than that observed for medium and large-sized eels. our reasoning was that foraging of small eels would occur mainly within the inters- 216 eels are less vulnerable tices of the substrates, whereas that of medium and large eels would be limited interstitially by their larger size, and so they would come out at night to forage on the surface of the substratum. moreover, larger to predation (jellyman 1989), and so may emerge more freely from cover. our observed differences in activity with size of longﬁns tend to support this hypo- thesis. however, for shortﬁns, the outcome of ac- tivity in relation to size of eel is less clear. that is, the activity of medium eels was no greater than that of small eels, possibly because they too largely foraged interstitially. some indirect evidence for interstitial feeding by juvenile shortﬁns in a small coastal stream during summer is available from the study by sagar & glo- va (1998). they found that both small and medium eels had fresh prey in their stomachs well after dawn (1500 h), whereas larger eels had none. as no eels were seen on the surface of the bed after dawn dur- ing sampling (g.j. glova, personal observation), it is highly probable that the fresh prey found in their stomachs during daytime resulted from foraging in- terstitially. if, foraging interstitially occurs among these size groups, and small and medium eels con- sume signiﬁcantly fewer prey than large eels (sa- gar & glova 1998), these differences may largely ac- count for the low activity of small and medium shortﬁns observed in the present study. interspeciﬁc differences in activity contrary to our hypothesis, longﬁns of all sizes were more active than shortﬁns in the ﬂow tank, with the difference being greatest for medium eels. why longﬁns were signiﬁcantly more active than short- ﬁns is not easily explained. in the wild, longﬁn juv- eniles tend to associate with the faster water velo- cities and larger substrates of rifﬂes, whereas short- ﬁns tend to occupy the slower, marginal habitats of lowland streams (glova et al. 1998). these ﬁndings have been corroborated in artiﬁcial channels (glova 1999), in which juvenile longﬁns tended to occupy the cobbles commonly found in rifﬂes, whereas shortﬁns preferred macrophytes (e.g., watercress rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum) that commonly oc- cur in the slower marginal habitats of streams. in the present study, all sizes of juvenile longﬁns were not more active in the rifﬂe than the pool, as one might expect from their distribution in the wild. although large longﬁns were signiﬁcantly (p,0.05) more active in the rifﬂe, both small and medium longﬁns were signiﬁcantly (p,0.05) more active in the pool, which was also the preferred daytime cover. small and medium longﬁns may have preferred the smaller cobbles and slower ﬂow in the pool of the ﬂow tank. on the other hand, shortﬁns of all sizes were consistently more active in the pool than the rifﬂe, a result which agrees with their daytime habitat associations in the wild (glova et al. 1998), but not entirely so with those of the present study, in which the rifﬂe was the preferred daytime cover of small and large short- ﬁns. the slower water velocity in the pool (average 0.05 m ` s»1) than the rifﬂe (average 0.15 m ` s»1) may partly account for the greater activity of small and medium longﬁns, and all sizes of shortﬁns, in the pool. while the distribution of invertebrates in the ﬂow tank was not determined, it is possible that they tended to settle in the pool (they were collected from rifﬂe habitat in the wild), which may further account for the greater activity of most eels in the pool. in some of the experiments in the present study, shortﬁns were more active on the second day of observation (data not shown), suggesting that they took longer to habituate to the test environment than longﬁns. escapees in preliminary trials, as well as during the habituation period of the experi- ments, were usually shortﬁns. however, there were no interspeciﬁc differences in the onset of activity at dusk in the experiments per se, and if shortﬁns sought escape more so than longﬁns during the night, this was not apparent in the activity re- corded. hence, we are inclined to accept that the interspeciﬁc differences in diel pattern portrayed in this study were largely attributable to adaptive behavioral differences. as an example, juvenile shortﬁns tend to occupy habitats frequented by large eels (glova et al. 1998), and so may be more susceptible to predation and thus come out less at night to feed on top of the substratum. size-related differences in diel activity in inundated margins there is also the possibility that conditions in the ﬂow tank (e.g., uniform ﬂow, constant water level) were less stimulating to shortﬁns than long- ﬁns. in the wild, the activity of shortﬁns is known to increase with rising water levels (jellyman 1991), presumably in response to browsing on terrestrial foods (jellyman 1989). longﬁns appear to be less sensitive to environmen- tal variation, with water temperature being one of the few variables with which their activity has been correlated in the wild (jellyman 1991). in the pres- ent study, the activity of medium longﬁns declined signiﬁcantly between replicates 1 and 3, during which time water temperature in the ﬂow tank de- clined from 20(cid:190)c to 17.5(cid:190)c. however, this is con- sidered to be a relatively minor decrease in tem- perature, and the decline in medium longﬁn activ- ity may have been inﬂuenced by other contributing factors, such as decreasing day length and pro- longed holding of eels before testing. biological implications in this study, eels of any size of either species were nocturnally active, with large eels being more ac- tive than small eels. we are of the opinion that these behaviors are largely in response to avoid- ance of predation and diel differences in availabil- ity of prey. while there is no doubt that nocturnal foraging on the surface of the substratum poses less risk to predation particularly by birds (e.g., gulls larus spp., terns sterna albostriata), such be- havior may also be food-related, with feeding co- inciding with the time of day that prey are more readily available. aquatic invertebrates drift mainly at night (mcclay 1968; watson 1971; muller 1974) and are more abundant on the sur- face of the substratum with the onset of dusk (pierce 1986). they would, therefore, be more read- ily available during the night to bottom foragers such as eels that mainly crawl on the surface while searching for prey, an hypothesis that has been ar- gued for nocturnal foraging in other new zealand native ﬁsh species (glova et al. 1987; glova & sa- gar 1989). that large eels were more active than small eels at night is almost certainly in large part due to their lesser ability to forage interstitially while in concealment during the day. in addition, predation by the larger eels on small eels may be a contribu- ting factor to the lesser nocturnal activity of small eels on the surface of the substratum. resumen 1. la actividad circadiana de tres grupos de taman˜o (pequen˜os ,100 mm; medianos‰100–199 mm, y grandes‰200–299 mm 217 glova & jellyman longitud total) de juveniles de anguilla australis y a. dieffenba- chii fueron estudiados en un tanque experimental durante un perı´odo de 48 horas, en verano. 2. en ambas especies, los tres grupos de taman˜o fueron activos durante la noche y se escondieron en el sustrato durante el dı´a, saliendo al limite superior de las piedras desde el atardecer has- ta el amanecer para alimentarse. durante el perı´odo de forra- geo, el nu´mero y la actividad de los tres taman˜os visibles de a. dieffenbachii fueron mayores que los observados para a. austra- lis, siendo las diferencias ma´s pronunciadas en los individuos pequen˜os y medianos. la actividad de todas las anguilas consis- tio´ fundamentalmente en examinar, reptando o penetrando en- tre las piedras en busca de presas. para ambas especies, la tasa de actividad aumento´ con el taman˜o. las anguilas ma´s peque- n˜as de ambas especies nadaron ma´s que las mayores, mientras que las mayores fueron observadas ma´s frecuentemente con la cabeza solamente fuera del sustrato. 3. la alimentacio´n de las anguilas pequen˜as en los espacios intersticiales podrı´a explicar la menor actividad en el limite su- perior del sustrato durante la noche. la menor tasa de activi- dad observada en a. australis respecto de a. dieffenbachii de todos los taman˜os puede ser debida, al menos en parte, a su habilidad para alimentarse en las zonas intersticiales y/o a un perı´odo de tiempo mas largo necesario para recuperarse o habi- tuarse al manejo sufrido en el ambiente-test. acknowledgments we sincerely thank
