laramie, usa abstract – we studied summer movement patterns of creek chubs, semotilus atromaculatus, in a low-gradient, sand-bottomed stream on the western plains of the united states. creek chubs were highly associated with patches of cover consisting of wood or macrophytes. movements among 37 patches in a 1.1-km segment were assessed in a mark-recapture study. over 2-week intervals, 44% of recaptured ﬁsh changed patches. net distances moved ranged from 4 to 606 m, median distance moved was 49 m. of ﬁsh recaptured repeatedly during the four sampling periods, most (65%) changed patches at least once, but few were consistently mobile. inter-patch distance was an important variable with a negative effect on creek chub movements. inter-patch cover was less important, but had a positive effect on movements. frequent, short-distance movements among habitat patches in summer are a component of the ecology of creek chubs and the spatial arrangement of patches, and intervening stream conditions appear to mediate those movements. key words: movement; habitat patches; creek chub; mark and recapture; semotilus atromaculatus laura a. t. belica, 8340 stewart avenue, los angeles, ca 90045, usa; e-mail: ltbelica@cowboys.uwyo.edu accepted for publication september 27, 2007 introduction movement is an important component of ﬁsh ecology and there has been continuing interest in better understanding movements of stream ﬁshes in recent decades (schlosser 1991; gowan et al. 1994; rodrı´- guez 2002). knowledge of movements is important for understanding habitat requirements, population structure, community composition and anthropogenic impacts (gatz & adams 1994; matheney & rabeni 1995; roni & quinn 2001; be´langer & rodrı´guez 2002; larson et al. 2002). long-distance movement is often associated with fulﬁlling life history needs, avoiding seasonally stressful habitat conditions or dispersing to new habitats (schlosser 1991; lonzarich et al. 1998; labbe & fausch 2000). less is known about the reasons for short-distance movements, although researchers have suggested such movements allow ﬁsh to respond to changing resource conditions or predation risk (fraser & sise 1980; gowan & fausch 1996; smithson & johnston 1999; lonzarich avoid predation et al. 2000). as the ability of ﬁsh to ﬁnd resources and ﬁtness, these short-range movements may be an integral adaptation of ﬁshes to the dynamic environments of streams. inﬂuences their stream ﬁsh populations have been characterised as consisting of two components during nonmigratory periods: a small mobile fraction that moves over long distances and a more numerous stationary fraction that displays little movement (funk 1955; rodrı´guez 2002). schrank & rahel (2006) expanded on these ideas to suggest that ﬁsh mobility could be considered in terms of turnover rate (i.e., the proportion of the population that moves) and displacement distance (how far each ﬁsh moves). thus, populations could be characterised as having short-displacement distances and low turnover – characteristic of extremely seden- tary ﬁsh such as some species of sculpin, cottus spp. (petty & grossman 2004) or short displacement distances and high turnover – typical of many salmonid populations in summer (rodrı´guez 2002). 258 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00277.x among the factors that may cause variation in ﬁsh mobility patterns are ﬁsh size, body condition, growth rate and interspeciﬁc behavioural differences (gowan & fausch 1996; smithson & johnston 1999; hughes 2000; nakamura et al. 2002; steingrı´msson & grant 2003). many stream ﬁshes are associated with a relatively discrete set of environmental features that can be characterised as habitat patches (fausch et al. 2002; arrington et al. 2005). examples of habitat patches important to ﬁshes are wood accumulations (monzyk et al. 1997), macrophyte beds (chick & mcivor 1994), pools or rifﬂes (schlosser 1987; labbe & fausch 2000), and thermal refuges (ebersole et al. 2001). movement among patches requires travelling through environments that may be physiologically suboptimal, low in food or high in predation risk. for most stream ﬁshes, we know relatively little about movement among patches or how stream conditions inﬂuence movement patterns. factors postulated to inﬂuence the movements of stream ﬁshes among patches are distance between patches, current velocity, cover availability, water depth and predator presence (lonzarich et al. 1998, 2000; gilliam & fraser 2001; roni & quinn 2001; schaefer 2001). the objectives of our research were to determine the extent to which a common north american stream ﬁsh, the creek chub, semotilus atromaculatus, was associated with discrete habitat patches, to characterise movement patterns of creek chubs among habitat patches and to assess how movement among patches was related to intervening stream conditions during the summer. we focused our study on creek chubs because they were one of the numerically dominant species in the study area and preliminary sampling indicated that they were highly associated with discrete habitat patches of wood or macrophytes. creek chubs are widely distributed throughout the united states and play an important role in structuring stream ﬁsh assemblages (schlosser & ebel 1989; page & burr 1991). study area the study area was a 1.1-km section of the laramie river, a 5th-order tributary of the north platte river in southeastern wyoming (fig. 1). in the study area, the laramie river is a plains stream with a low gradient, meandering channel (thorburn 1993) and predomi- nately ﬁne and small gravel substrates. streamﬂow typically peaks in early summer (may–july) as a result of snow melt in the mountains and is relatively constant for the rest of the year. riparian vegetation along the study segment included cottonwood trees, populus spp., and willows, salix spp., herbaceous movement patterns of creek chubs vegetation and grasses. dominant riparian vegetation types alternated along the length of the study segment between areas dominated by trees or willows and areas where herbaceous vegetation and grasses were dom- inant. most of the riparian area adjacent to livestock pasture was fenced, restricting cattle access to the river. the ﬁsh assemblage was dominated by native cyprinids, catostomids and one darter species. the cyprinid species were creek chubs, common shiners, luxilus cornutus, brassy minnows, hybognathus hankinsoni, fathead minnows, pimephales promelas, and longnose dace, rhinichthys cataractae. two catostomids were present in the study segment, white suckers, catostomus commersoni and longnose suck- ers, catostomus catostomus, with the white suckers being far more abundant. iowa darters, etheostoma exile, were the only darter species in the study segment. the only non-native ﬁsh was brown_trout, salmo_trutta, which are naturalised in the laramie river. materials and methods fish associations with patches in large plains streams such as the laramie river, the primary habitats of many ﬁsh species are woody debris and macrophyte beds that are patchily distributed along sand-bed channels. the laramie river has relatively homogeneous, small substrates that provide ﬁsh with little cover from piscivorous predators and because much of the channel is shallow rifﬂe or glide habitats; deep water cover is also limited. similarly, stream banks provide little cover as the banks are composed of sandy materials (that slump easily) and much of the riparian area is vegetated with shallow- rooting nonwoody taxa. the few small areas of undercut banks in the study area were typically associated with woody debris and often were the entrances to beaver, castor canadensis, dens located in the stream banks. with the exceptions of iowa darters, longnose dace and common shiners, the small- bodied ﬁsh of the laramie river are primarily associated with cover provided by woody debris and aquatic vegetation. in the laramie river, aquatic plants, known as macrophytes, grow in distinct beds. two species of aquatic vegetation were dominant in the laramie river, common water milfoil, myriophyllum exalbes- cens, and mare’s tail, hippuris vulgaris. woody debris was present in the channel in a variety of forms and sizes, ranging from aggregations formed by several trees to roots extruding from eroded banks. structur- ally, complex aquatic habitats such as macrophytes and woody debris have been suggested to be important 259 belica & rahel fig.

considered together as a single patch. these criteria were based on preliminary observations that indicated the patches less that 2 m2 were not widely used by adult creek chubs and because 2 m2 was the smallest area a ﬁsh could be accurately associated with using radiotelemetry (simp- kins & hubert 1998). although, using radiotelemetry to intensively monitor the movements of several larger creek chubs ultimately proved infeasible, the patch criteria initially developed were used for the study. only a few small macrophyte beds did not meet the criteria for minimum patch size and distance from neighbouring patches in the 1.1-km long study segment and were not included in the analyses. stream mapping and survey to evaluate the inﬂuence of stream conditions on creek chub movements among patches, the stream channel and all the patches in the 1.1-km segment were mapped using a high accuracy global position- ing system (gps) (trimble gps pathﬁnder pro xrs streamflow forage areas for insectivorous stream ﬁshes because they can harbour a high diversity and biomass of aquatic invertebrates (rozas & odum 1988; lehtinen et al. 1997; grenouillet & pont 2001). in addition, such habitats provide cover from piscivorous predators (rozas & odum 1988). because woody debris and macrophyte beds occurred as relatively discrete patches, separated by areas of unvegetated sand or small gravel substrates that provided little cover for ﬁsh, they were used as the ﬁsh habitat sampling units in the mark-recapture study of creek chub movement patterns. three types of habitat patches, hereafter referred to as patches, were identiﬁed: macrophytes, woody debris and complexes. complexes were comprised of both macrophytes and woody debris or a combination of macrophytes or woody debris with a beaver den entrance or undercut bank. to be considered a patch, a macrophyte bed, woody debris or complex had to have least 2 m2 and be separated by a an area of at minimum distance of 2 m of open substrate from another patch. if areas of cover were less than 2 m 260 receiver) using carrier-phase data collection and differential correction to improve the precision of the maps. gps data were collected using the north american datum of 1983 (nad 83). wetted perimeter of the channel and the perimeter of each of the 37 patches were mapped. the carrier-phase gps positions were differentially corrected during postprocessing with pathﬁnder ofﬁce software (trimble navigation ltd. 2000, 2002). a local base station was temporarily established less than 1.5 km from all points within the study area to collect the carrier-phase data needed for differential correction. water depth, current velocity and substrates in the study segment were measured along transects perpen- dicular to streamﬂow and spaced 10 m apart. for each transect, ﬁve equidistant points were sampled across the wetted width of the channel. current velocity in metres per second was measured using a ﬂow meter (marsh-mcbirney flo-mate model 2000, copyright hach ⁄ marsh–mcbirney, inc., frederick, usa) at 0.6 of water depth from the water surface where depth was less than 0.5 m and at 0.2 and 0.8 of water depth from the water surface where depth exceeded 0.5 m. because the two-side channels in the study segment had homogenous morphology, they were mapped using 1–3 measurement points depending on channel width along transects spaced 15–20 m apart. the transect locations were mapped with gps. finally, stream stage was monitored daily from a stage gauge within the study area. maps of the study segment, patches and transects were created with gis software, utm projection 13 n. arc gis 8.2 (environmental systems research institute, inc.) was used to calculate the spatial variables used in the regression analysis of ﬁsh movements. to estimate inter-patch distances, the shortest instream distance between pairs of patches was calculated using the perimeters of the patches as the start and end points. the amount of cover between pairs of patches was estimated by calculating the proportion of the area of patches to the area of the stream section between pairs of patches. the transect data were used to provide estimates of the mean and sd of water depth and current velocities of the stream sections between patches. mark-recapture procedures a multiple mark-recapture approach was used to track movement of creek chubs among 37 patches in the 1.1-km long study segment. to preclude the incorpo- ration of spawning or postspawning movements, mark-recapture surveys began in late july, more than 4 weeks after creek chub spawning was estimated to have occurred based on spawning periods reported in the literature as well as observations of ﬁsh spawning movement patterns of creek chubs in the study area. surveys were performed every other week over 8 weeks (22 july–13 september 2002). sampling period 1 was 22–25 july, period 2 was 5–9 august, period 3 was 19–23 august, and the ﬁnal sampling period 4, was 4–13 september. creek chubs captured in patches were marked (or re-marked) during sampling periods 1 through 3, no marks were given during the last sampling period. during each sampling period, ﬁsh were collected from patches using two-pass electroﬁshing with a battery-powered backpack electroﬁsher (smith-root, inc. model lr-24). two-pass electroﬁshing proved to be effective in collecting creek chubs from the patches. preliminary sampling indicated that the average cap- ture efﬁciency per pass was 0.74, therefore the probability of missing a ﬁsh in a patch after two electroﬁshing passes was only 0.068 [that is (1.0– 0.74)2]. block nets were not used because it was difﬁcult to encircle large, irregularly shaped patches and because we wanted to avoid disturbing ﬁsh prior to sampling. the still surface and clear water condi- tions of the laramie river enabled us to observe ﬁsh movements during electroﬁshing. we did not observe ﬁsh that were in open water being driven into macrophyte or wood patches. fish that were in or on the edges of patches generally responded to the disturbance of sampling by moving deeper into the cover provided by patches. thus, our sampling method did not cause ﬁsh to move among patches. sampling and marking ﬁsh from all 37 patches required at least 40 h and was conducted between 0730 and 1730 h each day. to minimise handling stress, ﬁsh were sedated prior to measuring and marking. all creek chubs collected were examined for marks by two people and total length was measured. the mark injection site was swabbed with a solution containing 0.075% malachite green to minimise the chance of infections. after marking, ﬁsh were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia in a dark-covered bin ﬁlled with 0.5%- nacl stream water solution, aerated and cooled. after recovery, ﬁsh were released into live cars placed in the patch, where they were captured. smaller ﬁsh were kept in separate live cars from larger ﬁsh to avoid predation. fish were released from live cars after several hours to minimise movements in response to handling stress. visible implant fluorescent elastomer (vie) tags produced by northwest marine technologies, inc. were used to mark ﬁsh. the body positions and the colour of mark indicated a speciﬁc patch and the date of the mark. by coupling 18 mark positions with two different tag colours during each of marking periods, up to 36 patches could be associated with unique marks. because no ﬁsh were collected from one of the original 36 patches in the study segment, that mark 261 belica & rahel the position was reassigned to a 37th patch for duration of the study. only creek chubs at least 59 mm total length were used for the mark-recapture study. fish with obvious parasitic or bacterial infec- tions were not marked. the marking system provided both date and location of capture information. fish recaptured multiple times during the marking period were re-marked and the marks provided a record of the individual ﬁsh’s movement history. this method enabled hundreds of creek chubs to be marked in a way that allowed us to track their movements among the patches over time. in a concurrent study of mark retention, vie mark retention in creek chubs over a 2-week period was 97.2% (103 ⁄ 106) and 93.5% (43 ⁄ 46) over a 5-week period. these estimates of mark retention indicate that mark loss was minimal during the study period of 8 weeks. only patches in the study segment were electro- ﬁshed during the ﬁrst 3 sampling periods (22–25 july, 5–9 august, and 19–23 august). however, during sampling period 4 (4–13 september), both patch and nonpatch areas were sampled, beginning 240 m down- stream and ending approximately 140 m upstream (at the base of an irrigation diversion dam) of the study segment boundaries. sampling the entire 1.1-km stream segment provided an opportunity to assess ﬁsh association with patch versus nonpatch areas. analysis of individual ﬁsh movements the movement patterns of creek chubs recaptured at least twice were examined to determine the individual plasticity of ﬁsh movement behaviour. based on the ﬁsh’s locations during at least three successive sam- pling periods, creek chubs were assigned to one of three movement categories; mobile, resident or alter- nate. mobile indicated ﬁsh had been recaptured in a different patch from the previous sampling period during each survey. resident indicated ﬁsh had been recaptured in the same patch during each successive sampling period. alternate indicated that a ﬁsh was either switched behaviours during later sampling periods. the move- ment patterns of mobile and alternate ﬁsh were further examined to determine if their movements included a return to a patch they had previously been marked in. initially mobile or resident, but simple linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between ﬁsh total length and movement distance. two regressions were performed in minitab statistical software release 14 (minitab, inc., state college, pa), one with the response variable, distance moved in metres, and another with movement distance log10 transformed. in both regres- sions, ﬁsh total in mm, was the predictor variable. length, 262 analysis of the relationship of stream characteristics and ﬁsh movements poisson regression was used to evaluate the inﬂuence of stream conditions on inter-patch movements of creek chubs. poisson regression is a generalised linear estimation method that deals explicitly with count data (long 1997). the response variable, called move- ments, was deﬁned as the number of creek chub movements observed in one direction (either upstream or downstream) between a pair of patches summed across all three recapture periods. because current velocity differed with the direction of movement between two patches, movements in an upstream direction were counted separately from movements in a downstream direction. the poisson regressions were performed in sas 9.1 statistical software (sas institute, inc., cary, nc). six predictor variables that characterised stream conditions between pairs of patches were used for the regression analysis. the variables were; distance between patches, proportion of cover between patches (total area of all patches in section ⁄ total area of channel section), mean depth and mean current velocity of the stream section between a pair of patches, and the coefﬁcients of variation of depth and current velocity for the stream section between a pair of patches. current velocities were negative values for downstream movements and positive values for upstream movements. the distance between patches was log10 transformed and the proportion of cover was arcsine transformed to meet normality assumptions for the regression analysis. bivariate plots of predictor variables and pearson correlations for all variable pairs were used to evaluate variable independence prior to their inclusion in models. to reduce multicollinearity, variable pairs with pearson correlations greater than 0.3 were not included in the same model, with the exception of the global model which contained all six variables. that in total, 22 models represented alternate plausible models of the inﬂuence of stream conditions on creek chub movements were selected a priori using subsets of the predictor variables including the global model which contained all of the predictor variables. the models were selected based on factors reported in the literature to inﬂuence movements of small-bodied stream ﬁshes. goodness-of-ﬁt of the poisson regres- sion models was evaluated using the ratio of the pearson v2 deviance to the d.f., with values close to 1.0 indicating good model ﬁt (ramsey & schafer 1997). akaike’s information criteria (aic) was used to evaluate the models with the primary purpose of identifying the models and variables that contributed the most in explaining the inter-patch movements of creek chubs observed in the study segment. the difference in aic (daic) between each alternate model and the best model (the model with the minimum aic value) was used as relative measure of model rank; models with daic values less than 2 suggest substantial evidence for the model (burnham & anderson 2002). estimates of the relative impor- tance of the six predictor variables were made by summing the akaike weights across all the models in which the variable occurred (burnham & ander- son 2002). evaluations of direction and magnitude of effect size were based on the averaged estimates of the parameter coefﬁcient and its precision across the entire set of models (burnham & anderson 2002). results stream survey )1 university geophysics, the channel slope was low, on average 1 mækm along the length of the study segment (unpublished data, dr edward kempema, department of geology and of wyoming). mean wetted width of the channel was 9.9 m (range 4.0–18.0 m) and mean channel depth was 0.28 m (maximum depth was 1.16 m). deep water sections of the channel consisted of runs and lateral scour pools associated with stream meanders. shallow water sections of the study segment were composed of rifﬂes or glides. the channel had predominately ﬁne substrates of sand, silt and clay (particle diameters less than 2 mm), and gravels (particles 2–64 mm in diameter). two large rifﬂe sections, approximately 100 m long each, were in the study segment. one was formed shale bedrock, and cobbles by an outcrop of (64–128 mm in dominant substrates. the other large rifﬂe had predominately gravel substrates. diameter) were the streamﬂow varied little during the study period with only two short-term variations caused by thunder- storms and upstream water management. mean daily stage at the gauge in the study area was 6.9 cm with a sd of 0.77 cm during the 8-week study period (unpublished data, dr edward kempema, department of geology and geophysics, university of wyoming). the study segment of the laramie river exhibited little variation in current velocities during the summer of 2002, in part because of the low channel gradient, but also as a result of unusually low summer ﬂows caused by a severe drought. the mean water velocity )1 (range within the study segment was 0.05 mæs )1). distances between pairs of patches 0–0.42 mæs ranged from 2.5 to 1056.6 m. the median inter-patch distance was 284.7 m. movement patterns of creek chubs fish associations with patches creek chubs were strongly associated with habitat patches when compared with open water. during sampling period 4 (4–13 september), 79.2% of the 245 creek chubs captured were collected within patches. for comparison, only 15.3% of the channel area consisted of patches, whereas 84.7% was open water (fig. 1). recapture rates in total, 628 creek chubs were marked. the mean total length of marked creek chubs was 81 mm (range 59–136 mm). recapture rates for creek chubs were calculated as the proportion of ﬁsh marked during the preceding marking period that were recaptured during the sampling period. the overall recapture rate of creek chubs over 2-week periods for the study was approximately 33%. from sampling period 1–2, 26.6% (53 ⁄ 199) of marked creek chubs were recap- tured. for sampling periods 2–3 and 3–4, the recapture rates were 27.1% (61 ⁄ 225) and 46.6% (95 ⁄ 204), respectively. population movement patterns there was a considerable amount of movement of creek chubs among habitat patches. the proportions of recaptured creek chubs that moved between patches during the 2-week intervals were: 55% (29 ⁄ 53) for sampling period 1–2, 36% (22 ⁄ 61) for sampling period 2–3 and 42% (40 ⁄ 95) for sampling period 3– 4 (fig. 2). because we sampled the entire study segment during sampling period 4, we were able to account for additional ﬁsh that were not collected in any habitat patch. of the 204 creek chubs that had been marked in a patch during sampling period 3, a total of 105 were recaptured during sampling period 4; 55 ﬁsh were found in the same patch in which they had been marked in period 3, 40 ﬁsh were found in a different patch and 10 ﬁsh were found in open water. thus, in total, including both the ﬁsh that moved to another patch or to open water, 48% (50 ⁄ 105) of creek chubs left the patch in which they had been marked the preceding period. creek chubs moved both upstream and downstream during all study periods, in total 56% of movements were upstream and 44% were downstream (fig. 3). however, there was little evidence of a persistent pattern of upstream bias. when movement directions were examined by period, there was a downstream bias in the ﬁrst 2-week sampling period (38% upstream vs. 62% downstream) followed by an upstream bias in the second and third sampling periods (64% upstream vs. 36% downstream and 263 belica & rahel s e h c t a p  g n o m a  d e v o m t a h t h s i f f o  n o i t o p o r p 1 0.9 0.8

upstream bias in movements was likely in part attributable to the fact that we were more likely to detect upstream movements, as the majority of creek chubs were marked in patches closer to the down- stream boundary of the study area. all 2-week periods the distribution of distances moved by creek chubs over appeared leptokurtotic (fig. 3). the median distance moved by mobile creek chubs over all 2-week periods combined was 49.9 m (range 4.7–606.4 m). considering all movements over the 2-week periods combined, 54.1% moved less than 50 m and only 11.8% were found more than 300 m from their initial location. 264 even over longer time periods, creek chubs tended to move mainly over short distances. the median distance moved by 44 creek chubs over 4 weeks was 115.0 m with a range of 5.1–700.9 m. over a 6-week recapture interval, the median distance moved by 39 creek chubs was 50.4 m (range 4.2–550.8 m). individual movement patterns to assess whether individual ﬁsh were consistently mobile, resident or alternated between behaviours, the movement histories of ﬁsh marked and recaptured during at least three successive sampling periods were tabulated. to avoid the possibility of double counting individual ﬁsh (as ﬁsh did not have unique tags), only the movement histories of ﬁsh recaptured in the ﬁnal sampling period (period 4, 4–13 september) were evaluated. in total, 31 creek chubs collected from patches during the ﬁnal sampling period had marks indicating that they had been captured in at least three successive sampling periods during the study. of the 31 ﬁshes, 11 remained residents in the patch of their initial mark during each sampling period, 4 moved from one patch to another each sampling period and the remaining 16 alternated between mobility and residency behaviours. of the four ﬁsh that were consistently mobile, none returned to a patch it had previously been captured in. two of the four mobile ﬁsh made both up- and downstream movements among patches, one consistently moved upstream and the other consistently moved downstream. only one creek chub that alternated between residency and mobility was captured in all four sampling periods and its marks indicated that after moving away from the patch where it was captured during the ﬁrst two periods, it later returned to that patch during the ﬁnal sampling period. there was no linear relationship between the distance moved (range 0–606.4 m) by creek chubs (n = 209) over 2-week periods and ﬁsh total length (range 59–136 mm) with distance measured in metres (r2 of 0.008, p-value = 0.21, a = 0.05) or log10 of metres (r2 of 0.017, p-value = 0.06, a = 0.05). relationship between inter-patch stream characteristics and movements during the study, creek chubs meeting minimum size requirements were marked in 32 of the 37 patches in the study segment. this yielded 1152 pairs of patches that creek chubs could move among, as ﬁsh could move from one of the 32 patches they were marked in to any one of the remaining 36 patches (32 · 36 = 1152). a total 91 creek chubs moved between 66 pairs of patches between successive mark and recapture periods. movement data from each successive period (representing movements sampling over 2-week intervals) were pooled because of the limited number of movements in relation to the number of patch pairs ﬁsh could move between. percent fre- quency distributions of the four main model param- eters: distance, percent cover, mean current velocity and mean depth for all possible inter-patch movements (n = 1152), and creek chub movements over 2-week periods (n = 91) are presented in fig. 4. the most striking result is that most movements occurred between patches that were close together, although a wide range of inter-patch distances was available (fig. 4b). twenty-two multiple regression models that repre- sented alternate hypotheses of the inﬂuence of stream conditions on creek chub movements were estimated using poisson regression. goodness-of-ﬁt of the models was evaluated using the ratio of the pearson v2 deviance to the d.f. (ramsey & schafer 1997). goodness-of-ﬁt of the global model was 1.0806, indicating that the poisson model was adequate for the observed frequency distri- bution of the response variable. using guidelines proposed by burnham & ander- son (2002) in which daic values less than 2 suggest substantial evidence for the model, the top six ranked models have support (table 1). the model with only distance (log10 transformed) and proportion of cover (arcsine transformed) as predictor variables had the movement patterns of creek chubs minimum aic value, indicating it was the model with the strongest support. based on the akaike weights, there is little difference in strength of evidence between the top two models, which had weights of 0.19 and 0.17, respectively (table 1). similarly, the third through sixth-ranked models showed little difference in strength of evidence relative to one another based on the akaike weights (table 1). the akaike weight of the top ranked model can be interpreted as meaning that there is a 19% chance of it being the best model among all the candidate models given the data. the similarity of the akaike weights of the top two models leads to a low evidence ratio (the ratio of the akaike weights of the two models) of 1.09, which means that the top model is only 1.09 times more likely than the second ranked model to be the best model of the set. although there is not a single best model with strong support in relation to the alternate candidate models, inferences can be made regarding the relative importance of variables by comparing the sum of akaike weights across all the models in which a parameter appears for each variable (burnham & anderson 2002). distance and proportion of cover have the greatest summed akaike weights which suggests that these factors are relatively more impor- tant in inﬂuencing creek chub movements among patches in this system (table 2).

relative importance of predictor vari- ables, based on sums of akaike weights across all models in which the variables occurred, and the model-averaged estimates of variable coefﬁcients and their ses based on all the models. model-averaged estimates of parameter coefﬁcients and their variances were used to evaluate the direction and magnitude of effect sizes as is recommended when there is not single best model with very strong support (burnham & anderson 2002). distance was the only parameter with a 95% conﬁdence interval that did not contain 0. the model-averaged coefﬁcient for distance was negative, indicating that as distance between patches increased the number of ﬁsh movements between patches decreased (table 2). the 95% con- ﬁdence interval for cover contained 0, but did not overlap 0 as broadly as the other parameters (table 2) suggesting that cover may have an inﬂuence on creek chub movement in this system. the model-averaged coefﬁcient for the proportion of cover was positive suggesting that increased amounts of cover between patches increases the number of ﬁsh movements. 266 movements out of the study area movements downstream out of the study area were assessed by sampling downstream of the lower boundary of study segment. during sampling periods 2 and 3, patches up to 100 m downstream of the lower boundary of the study segment were sampled to look for marked ﬁsh that had moved out the study segment. no marked ﬁsh were captured downstream of the study segment during period 2. during period 3, a creek chub that had been marked in period 2 was found downstream of the lower boundary of the study segment having moved 41.6 m from its mark location. during sampling period 4, we sampled up to 240 m downstream of the study segment boundary. two creek chubs with marks from 4 weeks earlier had moved downstream from their mark locations, one had moved approximately 707 m and the other approxi- mately 474 m, and both had moved 240 m down- stream of the study segment boundary. upstream movements out of the study area were more difﬁcult to assess because most of the area upstream of the upper boundary of the study segment was a large deep pool below an irrigation diversion dam and only the margins of the pool could be sampled effectively. during period 3, the pool was seined and one marked creek chub was collected that had moved 80 m upstream from its mark location. during period 4, the pool margin was electroﬁshed and no marked creek chubs were captured. areas upstream of the diversion dam were not sampled because ﬁsh movement over the dam was considered extremely unlikely. the vertical drop of the dam was over 1 m and there was little ﬂow over the dam during much of the study period. we sampled patches up to 1.3 km downstream of the study segment several weeks after the study ended (on 18 and 25 october 2002) and found ﬁve creek chubs that had moved out of the study segment. all had moved more than 1000 m from their last marked location (1065, 1087, 1186, 1203 and 1382 m) over periods of 8–12 weeks. discussion fish associations with patches plains streams are generally characterised by shallow, low-gradient channels with predominately ﬁne sub- strates of sand, silt or small gravels that provide ﬁsh with little cover. these conditions were observed in the laramie river, where only 15.3% of the channel area consisted of macrophyte beds or wood accumu- lations that would provide cover for small ﬁshes. these habitats existed as discrete patches that were separated by expanses of open substrate. creek chubs were typically found in close association with these habitat patches. habitat patchiness appears to play a predominate role in determining the distribution of creek chubs in plains streams, just as habitat patchi- ness has been found crucial in explaining distribution patterns of many terrestrial birds and mammals (turner 1989; robinson et al. 1995) as well as stream ﬁshes and invertebrates (reiman & mcintyre 1995; johnston 2000; palmer et al. 2000). population movement patterns despite the fact that habitat patches were surrounded by open substrates that provide little cover from predators, creek chubs moved frequently among patches during summer in the laramie river. almost half of recaptured ﬁsh had changed patches over a movement patterns of creek chubs 2-week period, however, most movement distances were less than 50 m. a small proportion of creek chubs moved greater distances; in some cases over 600 m in a 2-week period. skalski & gilliam (2000) also found that creek chubs were relatively mobile, with 83% of 123 marked ﬁsh changing locations over 1-month sampling intervals from april to august in a virginia stream. although many ﬁsh changed locations, displacement distances were short. the movement distribution of creek chubs was reported in terms of sites moved, where sites were described as alternating pools and runs averaging 10– 15 m in length (skalski & gilliam 2000). the range of creek chub movements was 12 sites downstream to 13 sites upstream (skalski & gilliam 2000), or roughly a maximum range of 130–195 m. by contrast, smithson & johnston (1999) found that creek chubs in an arkansas stream were relatively sedentary. only 12% of 25 ﬁshes moved out of the pools, where they had been marked during may through october. however, the study stream was small, with pools connected by shallow rifﬂes that may have deterred movements by creek chubs (lon- zarich et al. 2000). creek chubs in the laramie river showed no directional movement bias during the summer. skalski & gilliam (2000) also reported no bias towards upstream or downstream movements for creek chubs. ardea our study segment was comprised of predominately shallow sandy-bottomed sections that provided little cover from predators, yet we observed numerous piscivorous predators during our study including brown_trout, salmo_trutta, mink, mustela vison, herodias, mergansers, mergus herons, merganser, pelicans, pelecanus erythrohynchos, and kingﬁshers, ceryle alcyon. predation could have inﬂuenced ﬁsh movement patterns in two ways. first, it could have reduced the apparent movement of ﬁsh among patches because of predation bias, whereby ﬁsh that move from a patch (especially those that move long distances) have a higher probability of being eaten relative to those that remain in the patch. if this occurred, the number of creek chubs that moved was underestimated because the ones that moved and were eaten were missed in the data. predation bias would mean that creek chubs were even more mobile than we calculated. the second way that predation could have inﬂuenced ﬁsh movement is if the arrival of a predator in a patch caused creek chubs to leave the patch, increasing the overall movement of creek chubs. the presence of piscivorous ﬁsh and other piscivorous predators has been shown to both increase (gilliam & fraser 2001) and decrease the movement of small stream ﬁshes (rahel & stein 1998), but how various piscivores inﬂuence the movement of creek chubs in our system remains to be investigated. 267 belica & rahel distribution of movements the frequency distribution of distances moved by creek chubs appeared leptokurtotic, which is similar to other studies of movement of stream ﬁshes. skalski & gilliam (2000) also reported that creek chub move- ments (in terms of number of sites moved) exhibited a leptokurtotic distribution. some researchers have sug- gested that the total range of movement may be underestimated when stream ﬁsh movements have a leptokurtotic distribution because the ﬁsh that move long distances are unlikely to be recaptured (skalski & gilliam 2000; fausch et al. 2002). the length of the study segment (1.1 km) allowed the observation of longer distance movements, and we observed a few creek chubs moving as far as 600 m over 2 weeks. the distribution of movement distances observed for creek chubs was consistent with movement patterns of other species, where the majority of the population makes short-range movements, while a small propor- tion moves greater distances (rodrı´guez 2002). other researchers have suggested that the leptokurtotic distribution of observed movement distances observed in mark-recapture studies is in part related to unequal sampling over distances (porter & dooley 1993; albanese et al. 2003). our sampling design did not allow us to detect movements out of the marking area, however, the spatial arrangement of patches within the study segment allowed us to detect more intermediate and longer distance movements (e.g., inter-patch distances of 100–500 m) than is typical of mark- recapture studies that use reaches as sampling units. in our study, the distribution of creek chub movements relative to the distribution of possible inter-patch distances in the study area suggests that creek chub movements of longer distances were not common in this system. although most mobile creek chubs in the laramie river exhibited low-displacement distances, a few ﬁsh did move greater distances. in addition to ﬁsh that moved 600 m during 2 weeks, we documented ﬁve ﬁsh that moved between 1065 and 1382 m over 8–12-week periods during august–october. such long-distance movements are important in allowing ﬁsh species to recolonise habitats defaunated by drought or pollutants (sheldon & meffe 1995; sche- urer et al. 2003). such movements may also allow ﬁsh to locate more bioenergetically favourable foraging areas as has been found for stream salmonids that rank high in a dominance hierarchy (gowan & fausch 2002). individual movement patterns when we examined the movement histories of indi- vidual creek chubs, we found that 65% moved at least 268 once during the study period with most alternating between residency and mobility. similarly, skalski & gilliam (2000) found no statistically signiﬁcant cor- relation between the probability of movement during one period and movement during the previous period for creek chubs. the high proportion of the population moving over 2-week periods and the fact that individual ﬁsh were likely to move over longer periods suggest that creek chubs are quite mobile in this system. because movement is an integral component of ﬁsh life histories, even ﬁsh that tend to move less overall are likely to move in response to changes in resource distribution or conditions in a stream section; there- fore, the classiﬁcation of individuals as residents or mobile may be problematical, particularly over longer time periods (gatz & adams 1994; fausch et al. 2002). for example, roach, rutilus rutilus (a riverine cyprinid of europe) may remain stationary for several days before moving large distances (baade & fredrich 1998). individuals of several species of stream ﬁshes have been documented to alternate between residency and mobility behaviours (lewis & flickinger 1967; kennedy 1981; harcup et al. 1984) suggesting this alternating behaviour may be more common than is evident from typical mark-recapture studies of ﬁsh movement. we found no relationship between creek chub length and distance moved over a 2-week period. smithson & johnston (1999) also reported no statistically signiﬁ- cant relationship between the lengths or weights of mobile and nonmobile creek chubs. skalski & gilliam (2000) found the probability of movement in creek chubs was positively related to size, but that size had no effect on the distances moved by creek chubs. we categorised ﬁsh as mobile or resident based on surveys conducted every other week. thus, we did not track individual movements at the time scales required to determine whether the short-displacement distances observed for the majority of creek chubs reﬂected diel, exploratory or dispersal movements. research con- ducted on larger-bodied riverine cyprinids and cato- stomids have demonstrated that individuals can move hundreds of metres as part of their diel movements between foraging and resting sites (matheney & rabeni 1995; clough & ladle 1997; baade & fredrich 1998). and several studies have documented stream ﬁshes making exploratory movements in which ﬁsh left habitats and then returned later (gatz & adams 1994; baade & fredrich 1998; smithson & johnston 1999; larson et al. 2002). to determine whether the short-range movements of creek chubs, we observed represented diel movements among foraging and resting sites or exploratory movements would require tracking movements of individual ﬁsh intensively. relationship between inter-patch stream characteristics and movements distance between patches appears to inﬂuence the inter-patch movements of creek chubs in the laramie river. we found the number of creek chub movements between patches was negatively related to inter-patch distance. lonzarich et al. (2000) found that movement rates of ﬁshes out of habitat patches (pools) decreased as increased with increasing rifﬂe length. schaefer (2001) also reported that rifﬂe length was inversely related to the likelihood of minnows moving among pools in an experimental stream. the distance between patches there was evidence suggesting creek chub move- ments may be positively inﬂuenced by the amount of cover between patches in the laramie river. however, the statistical evidence was weak, likely because of the preponderance of short-distance movements between neighbouring patches. because our patches were by deﬁnition areas of cover, the intervening stream sections between two neighbouring patches typically had no cover. therefore, many of the short-distance movements we observed between neighbouring patches were through areas of open substrates. over longer distances, the amount of cover between patches may mediate predation risk and have a positive inﬂuence on the likelihood of creek chub movements in the laramie river. other researchers have found that cover is related to ﬁsh movements. for instance, roni & quinn (2001) found that the frequency of salmonid movements stream increased with increases in the amount of woody debris. matheney & rabeni (1995) suggested that northern hog suckers hypentelium nigricans utilised cover more frequently in small, shallow streams than in a river with deep, swift water areas. and, gilliam & fraser (2001) found that prey ﬁsh movement across habitats occupied by piscivorous ﬁsh was positively related to the presence of cover. in an experimental in contrast to other studies, current velocity did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence creek chub movements in our study area, but this may be explained by the minimal current velocities we observed resulting from the combination of low ﬂow from a severe drought and the low-gradient channel. schaefer (2001) found move- ment rates of other small-bodied stream minnows )1 and higher. decreased at current velocities of 15 cmæs the mean current velocity of the study segment was )1 during the summer of 2002. although only 5 cmæs there were a few areas of faster current (maximum )1), these ﬂows current velocity observed was 42 cmæs were restricted to the thalweg in a few locations. current velocity along the stream margins (area within 1 m of )1 and usually the shoreline) was always less than 5 cmæs )1 along the entire 1.1-km long study segment, 0 cmæs movement patterns of creek chubs which would have allowed ﬁsh to move along the stream margin without encountering high water velocities. current velocities are likely to have a greater inﬂuence on creek chub movements in higher gradient streams that have more fast water habitats. similarly, contrary to expectations, water depth between patches did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence creek chub movements in our study area. deep water has been suggested to be a form of ﬁsh cover from certain terrestrial predators (schlosser 1991), and shallow water has been found to provide cover for small- bodied ﬁshes from larger piscivorous ﬁshes (schlosser 1987). the lack of inﬂuence of water depth between patches in our study may be in part attributable to the diverse array of predators in the study area coupled with the low ﬂows resulting from the severe drought which resulted in shallow mean depths in the majority of the study segment. the frequency distribution of creek chub movements in relation to mean depths suggested that creek chubs may be more likely to move through habitats with mean water depth of at least 20 cm than through shallower waters, although more data are needed. in years of higher water in the laramie river, or in other systems, depth between patches may have a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the movements of creek chubs. lonzarich et al. (2000) proposed that exploratory movements by pool dwelling species would not be impeded by inter-patch conditions in sandy bottom streams lacking the physical conditions needed to promote rifﬂe formation. however, our results suggest that creek chub movements in a low gradient, sandy- bottomed stream were affected by factors other than the characteristics of rifﬂe habitats, namely the inter- patch distances arising from the spatial arrangement of macrophyte beds and woody debris and the lack of cover between these habitats. turnover and displacement as parameters of ﬁsh movement time interval) recent work has suggested that ﬁsh movement needs to be considered in terms of both turnover (the proportion of ﬁsh that leave a habitat patch during a given time interval) and displacement (the distance a ﬁsh moves during that (rodrı´guez 2002). schrank & rahel (2006) suggested that turn- over and displacement could be considered as two axes that describe a range of mobility patterns. the extremes of these axes deﬁne four mobility patterns: low turnover–low displacement; low turnover–high displacement; high turnover–low displacement and high turnover–high displacement. in summer, creek chubs in the laramie river ﬁt a pattern of intermediate turnover (44% of recaptured ﬁsh changed patches over a 2-week period), but low displacement (54% moved 269 belica & rahel net distances of <50 m over 2 weeks). moderate to high turnover rates coupled with low displacement appears to be a prevalent mobility pattern among stream ﬁshes (freeman 1995; johnston 2000; rodrı´- guez 2002). by contrast, ﬁshes with a low turnover- low displacement pattern spend extended time in a single patch such as a deep pool and show displace- ment distances of only a few metres. examples include some species of sculpins (petty & grossman 2004) and large trout in headwater streams in summer (schrank & rahel 2006). under the restricted move- ment paradigm, the low turnover–low displacement pattern was thought to be the norm for stream ﬁshes until researchers recognised the need to sample outside of the original area where ﬁshes were marked (gowan et al. 1994). our data support a growing body of literature indicating that high turnover–low displace- ment is a common feature of the ecology of stream ﬁshes during nonmigratory periods. we found that wood and macrophytes are important habitat for creek chubs in the laramie river. such habitat is patchily distributed in plains streams and this results in a landscape mosaic similar to many terres- trial environments. creek chubs appear to readily move between patches in a manner that is inﬂuenced by the intervening habitat. understanding the motiva- tion for such inter-patch movements remains an area where future research is needed.
