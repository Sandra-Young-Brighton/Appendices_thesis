(1983), for example, found that smaller fish inhabited veg- etated areas (that also provided some visual iso- lation) to reduce predation, even though their for- aging rates were reduced. in this study the role of instream cover for microhabitat selection of stone loach, barbatula barbatula l. (previously noemacheilus barbatulus l.) was examined. stone loach are small benthic fish about 7-14 cm in length (maitland & campbell 1992). they are found in most of eur- ope, except southern areas, in both lentic and lotic habitats (mills, welton & rendle 1983). they pri- marily feed on benthic invertebrates, (smyly 1955, welton, mills & pygott 1991, przybylski & banbu- ra 1989, rundle & hildrew 1992). stone loach are most active at night (smyly 1955, burdeyron & buisson 1982, welton, mills & rendle 1983) and are principally non-visual tactile feeders (smyly 1955, welton et al. 1983). stone loach are preyed upon by fish such as brown_trout, salmo_trutta l., (michel & oberdoff 1995) and also by piscivorous birds and mammals (smyly 1955, chanin 1991, maitland & campbell 1992). preliminary experiments in laboratory aquaria without flowing water showed that stone loach tended to select water depths where cover was located (cover had a stronger influence than water depth, unpublished data - mackenzie 1996). this study set out to establish if the same would be true under conditions of flowing water, and with the added effect of predation risk from adult brown_trout. the presence of cover, and the depth at which cover is present. should influence fish micro- habitat choice. power (1987) and schlosser (1988) found prey fish distributions were linked to the presence/absence of predators, with shallow water having the highest risk for large fish due to the presence of wading predators, and deeper water having the highest risk for small fish due to the presence of swimming predators. in this study the following questions were ad- dressed: 1) do stone loach use cover primarily for visual isolation, or as a flow refuge? 2) with no 88 predation risk do stone loach prefer instream cover, or certain water depthhelocity combi- nations? 3) with predation risk from brown_trout do stone loach change their preferences for cover and water depth or velocity? methods fish were collected from onnerupsbticken creek, a tributary of the river hojebn, near lomma and the river brig,, a tributary of the river kavlinge- an near eslov (southwestern sweden). the stone loach ranged in length from 72 mm to 142 mm total length, (mean 91 mm) and ranged in weight from 3.1 g to 18.4 g (mean 7.6 g) at the start of the experiments. six adult brown_trout ranging from 159 mm to 214 mm fork length, averaging 183 mm, were collected from the river brbbn near loberod. the stone loach were injected with 11x2 mm passive integrated transponder tags for individual identification (see brannas et al. 1994 for details). the tags were injected into the body cavity on the 4 5m 0 5m side view 0 7srn cross-section of habitats 'u mem water depth (ern) 12.4 6.5 stream layout stream 3 fig. i. diagrams

and frozen chi- ronomid larvae. fish awaiting use in experiments were held in aquaria, and food was added between 1200 and i300 h, ensuring that the fish were fed at least every second day. experiments were conducted in may and june 1996 in three artificial indoor streams, subjected to natural lighting through windows. the streams closely resemble natural streams (greenberg 1992), with three habitats represented. the streams con- sisted of a head box supplying water to a riffle, a run, and pool, before emptying into a reservoir and being pumped back to the head box (fig. 1). riffle and run habitats were shallower with faster flowing water than the pool habitat (table 1). the stream bed was covered in a 2- to 3-cm layer of sand and fine gravel that could not be used as cover by the stone loach. during cover type experi- ments the ambient water temperatures were <20°c, and the streams were run independently of each other (i.e. not connected in series). during the habitat use experiments the streams were con- nected in series leading all water in and out of a water cooler to maintain water temperature below 25°c (incipient lethal level for brown_trout, elliott 1991). average discharge in each stream was 5.8 1 - s-l. cover type preferences the first set of experiments evaluated which as- pects of instream cover (visual isolation, flow ref- uge) were most important to the stone loach. in this experiment the riffle and run areas of the three streams were treated as two habitats (as in greenberg 1992, 1994) with a screen partition pre- venting movement into the pools. instream cover was simulated using 10 cm lengths of clear pvc pipe (65 mm in diameter). the pipe was cut in half longitudinally (“inverted u”) and placed on the stream bed, enabling stone loach contact with the table 1. depth and surface current velocity of the riffle and run habitats for the cover type experiments and rkffle/run and pool habitats for the habitat use experiments.

isolation and overhead cover, shelters were covered with opaque tape. to act as a refuge from the flow the shelter openings were placed perpendicular to the flow. four different cover types (visual isolation ref- uge, non-visual isolation refuge, flow refuge and non-flow refuge) were tested in six possible combi- nations. combinations were tested two at a time, allowing simple paired t-test analysis. a prelimi- nary trial without any cover types present in the riffle and run established that stone loach pre- ferred the run habitat (73.3% of the fish found in the run, 6 replicates, paired t-test with square root transformation, p=0.007, t=4.41, df=5). to com- pensate for this preference, half the replicates of each treatment were conducted in the run and half in the riffle. the following comparisons were made: a) non- visual isolation vs nonvisual isolation +flow refuge, b) nonvisual isolation vs visual isolation, c) nonvis- ual isolation vs visual isolation+flow refuge, d) nonvisual isolation+flow refuge vs visual isolation, e) nonvisual isolation+ flow refuge vs visual isolation+flow refuge and f) visual isolation vs vis- ual isolation+flow refuge. five shelters of a given type were added to each habitat. six replicates (each containing 10 stone loach) of each treatment were conducted, with 3 trials run per day. only 5 replicates were used for some comparisons due to fish mortalities. a trial began by placing 5 fish in the riffle and 5 fish in the run. after 24 hours, prior to releasing a drop gate between habitats, the location of stone loach in each habitat and the po- sition in relation to cover was noted. this was achieved by slowly approaching the streams and keeping low to avoid scaring the fish. the stone loach were then removed from the streams. trials started between 1200 and 1300 h. during these ex- periments the mean water temperature was 21.8”c (range: 19.9-23.2”c). habitat use without predation risk in the next set of experiments the riffle and run habitats were treated as one habitat (hereafter re- ferred to as riffle, as in dahl & greenberg 1996), while the screen partition was removed, allowing access to the pool habitat (table 1). there were four habitat treatments: cover present in pool and riffle, cover present only in pool, cover present only in riffle, and no cover present. treatments with cover consisted of ten visual isolation shelters per habitat positioned and oriented randomly on the stream bed. again there were 6 replicates of 10 fish for each treatment, with three trials being tested at a time while the other fish were rested and fed. testing was designed so that the fish were rotated 89 mackenzie & greenberg among streams to remove any stream location bias, and were subjected to each cover treatment once and in different sequences to remove temporal ef- fects. a sensor plate for the passive integrated tran- sponder tags was suspended across the opening be- tween the pool and riffle to monitor die1 activity of the stone loach. the sensor plate was connected to a computer (via a collinson data logger), which recorded stream number, date, time and fish identi- fication code. the sensor plate detected loach movement between the pool and riffle habitat. a preliminary study showed that loach added to the pool had no difficulty moving between the pool and the riffle. indeed, within 10 minutes some loach had moved, and within 24 hours habitat selection had stabilized. fish were added to the pool because upstream movement to the riffle habitat against the current can be deemed positive habitat selection, whereas downstream movement into the pool could be a consequence of non-selec- tive movement associated with water flow. because the sensor plate could not identify direction of movement, that data was only used as a measure of activity. habitat use was measured at the end of a 24-h trial by releasing drop gates that were suspended between the pool and riffle. the fish in each habitat were counted, removed and identified. during the experiments without brown_trout, mean water temperature was 21.5"c (range: 15.3- 23.7"c). habitat use with predation threat the above procedure was repeated, but this time with predation risk from a single brown_trout pres- ent in the pool of each stream. the trout were not confined to the pool but they were never found in the riffle. the trout were a threat to the loach but were too small to actually consume the majority of the loach. however the smaller stone loach were potentially edible. during these experiments coarse meshed netting was placed over the top of the pool habitat to prevent the trout from jumping out of the stream. the mean water temperature was 21.4"c (range: 18.9-23.3"c) during this experi- ment. results cover type preferences paired t-tests were conducted on square root- transformed data for the different cover preference experiments. stone loach significantly selected the visual isolation shelters over the non-visual shel- ters in all cases, regardless of whether shelters also provided flow refuge (table 2). because the clear 90 table 2. results of cover type experiments (visual isolation, flow refuge), analysed using square root transformed data with a paired t-test. percentages are the number of stone loach associated with the cover type listed for each column (i.e.%=in row

these shelters were tested against clear (no flow refuge) pvc shelters that had opaque vertical edges (i.e. the edge comprising the pvc pipe thickness), which should facilitate visual detection (fausch 1993). stone loach did not show any predilection to select one type of clear shelter over the other (55% for clear pvc with opaque vertical edges, paired t-test with square root transformation, p=0.69, t=0.42, df=5), suggesting selection of other types of shelter over clear pvc shelters cannot be explained by inability of loach to detect them. stone loach did not select flow refuge shelters (table 2) when tested directly against shelters that did not provide flow refuge (i.e. visual isolation or non-visual isolation was the same). for all trials using nonvisual cover types, 29.7% of the stone loach were under the shelters, whereas for trials with visual cover types 96.2% of the stone loach were found beneath shelters. habitat use with and without predation threat stone loach were most numerous in the pool, whether or not trout were present (fig. 2). in the absence of trout the number of stone loach present in the pool differed significantly among the differ- ent cover treatments (analysis of variance, square root transformed data: p=o.ool, f= 16.02, fcrit= 8.10, n1=3, n2=20, fig. 2). partition analysis re- vealed significantly lower numbers of stone loach in the pool when cover was restricted to the riffle than in the other three cover treatments (a priori 0 koutabsent m troutpfesent 10 - number of in pool z s 2 e 3 e - p habitat cover treatment fig.

14.82, n!= 1, n2=20). the other cover treatments were not sig- nificantly different from each other. in the pres- ence of trout there were also significant differences in the number of stone loach found in the pool in the different cover treatments (analysis of variance, square root-transformed data: p=o.ol, f=6.82, fcri,=4.94, n l = 3 , n2=20, fig. 2), but a priori par- tition test analysis failed to identify significant dif- ferences among habitat cover treatments. in fact, the general effect of trout on stone loach, for all treatments, was a reduction in the use of the pool by stone loach (schneiner-ray-hare extension of the kruskal-wallis test (sokal & rohlf 1995): p<0.05, h=4.48, hcrit=3.84, df= 1). moreover, there was more variation in the number of stone loach using the pool in all treatments when trout was present (fig. 2). in the presence of trout, many small stone loach, but few large stone loach, were found in the riffle (fig. 3). only one small stone microhabitat selection by stone loach loach (78 mm) was eaten by the trout (the passive integrated transponder tag was found in a trout stomach). based on passive integrated transponder tag re- cordings, stone loach activity peaked between 2100 and 0300 h, corresponding from dusk to just prior to dawn (fig. 4). there was also a smaller peak of activity between 1300 and 1700 h, reflecting move- ment by the stone loach just after being placed in the streams. this could have been a result of stress or exploratory behavior. very little activity was re- corded from 0400 to 1200 h. the presence of trout did not affect the timing of activity. discussion stone loach made little use of shelters not provid- ing visual isolation. this could be due to the alien nature of these clear structures that do not occur in natural streams where all cover provides visual isolation to some extent. shelters providing flow refuge were also little used. this suggests that flow refuges are not important to stone loach under the conditions and the velocities encountered in this study. salmonids have been found to make use of cover providing low velocity areas (fausch 1984 & 1993, shirvell 1990, rincbn & lobon-cervia 1993). as a benthic fish, stone loach may be less reactive to flow velocity (facey and grossman 1992), as they keep close to the substrate where velocities are generally low and they may be morphologically adapted for maintaining position as has been shown for other benthic fish (facey & grossman 1992). spalding (1995 et al.) proposed that for coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch) water velocities < 15 ern * s-l did not require the use of flow refuges, and in this study the velocities were less than this. therefore the flow refuges may have been used more if water velocities had been higher. 20 16 14 12 frequency 10 8 6 4 2 0 6 7 1 n total . trout present trout absent 7000 6000 - 5000 1 activity - total _ _ _ _ . _ _ trout absent - - - - trout present 9  8 length class (cm) 10 11

the form of water turbulence is present. in this study there was little water turbulence and this may have contributed to the lack of use of the clear shelters and use of the visual isolation shelters. the results of the second experiment in which stone loach selected the deeper water of the pool, and had a predilection for cover agrees with pre- vious laboratory and field studies (smyly 1955, maitland 1965, unpublished data - mackenzie 1996). however, habitat use by stone loach appears to be more complicated than that. zweimiiller (1995) found stone loach predominately in pools, as previously studies have shown, when only two species of fish were present, whereas in the pres- ence of more species they were mostly found in riffles (presumably due to predationkompetition although zweimuller (1995) does not speculate on the reason). zweimuller (1995) also found that stone loach responded to high discharges by mov- ing to coarser substrate in riffle areas. the low dis- charge levels and lack of other fish species in this study probably explain their predilection for the pool. only one stone loach was eaten by the brown_trout. the latter generally become truly piscivor- ous over 35 cm, while below this size, brown_trout are opportunistic feeders (michel & oberdorff 1995). however, predation can have non-lethal ef- fects by influencing prey habitat use, activity levels, distribution of prey species (resetarits 199 1, grossman & freeman 1987), and decreased forag- ing rates (metcalfe et al. 1987). that predation threat affects prey distribution was shown here by the movement of stone loach, especially the smaller individuals, away from the trout and into the riffle. this result is consistent with the “small fish, shal- low water” pattern (schlosser 1987 & 1988, harv- ey & stewart 1991, werner et al. 1983, power, mat- thews & stewart 1985, greenberg 1994, eklov et al. 1994). microhabitat use by stone loach in the field agrees with this pattern as fish <3 cm use shallow, low water velocity areas, whereas larger stone loach use deeper, higher water velocity areas (zweimuller 1995). it should also be pointed out that in our study more stone loach were found in the pool alongside brown_trout when cover was present in the pool. presumably the cover must have either reduced predatory or aggressive brown_trout behaviour because the trout simply did not see the hiding stone loach, or reduced capture ef- fectiveness as the stone loach could flee to refuges if attacked. change in habitat use by stone loach in response to trout presence was not as much as expected. this may be related to the warm water tempera- 92 tures reducing feeding motivationipredatory be- havior by brown_trout. the temperatures were close to the incipient lethal level of brown_trout (25”c, elliott 1991), whereas the stone loach did not approach their incipient lethal level of 28°c (elliott et al. 1994). elliott et al. (1994) recorded cessation of normal brown_trout feeding at lyc, while stone loach normally fed up to 27°c. elliott et al. (1994) speculate that temperature may be the reason that stone loach are present in the warmer south of britain and absent from the colder north. activity was shown to peak between 2100 and 0300 h, with the maximum at 2300 h. this co- incides with the onset of dusk and the hours of darkness in sweden during may and june. there was no evidence of a dawn peak as found by perrin (1980). this study agrees with those by burdey- ron & buisson (1982) and welton et al. (1983), who found a dusk peak and decline in activity dur- ing darkness. burdeyron & buisson (1982) found the cue for increased activity was the decline in light level but that stone loach also had an internal mechanism for triggering increased activity. the present study examined micro-habitat choice of stone loach during daytime. presumably stone loach would have had different patterns of micro- habitat use at night as stone loach should be less dependent on shelter when they are actively forag- ing. perhaps a future study, using a passive inte- grated transponder tag system that allows round- the-clock monitoring of habitat use and at lower temperatures (close to or at optimal for the preda- tory brown_trout), could explore this aspect of the ecology of stone loach. 1. en corrientes
