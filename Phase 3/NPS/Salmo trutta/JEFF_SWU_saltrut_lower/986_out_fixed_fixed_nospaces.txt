the river fund of the river foundation, japan; the futaba electronics memorial foundation abstract japanese eels (anguilla japonica) perform large- scale oceanic migrations between their spawning ground and growth habitats in continental waters during life history. however, between these migrations, they spend most of time in growth habitats such as rivers. to investigate the diel and seasonal activities, homing behaviour and home range of yellow- phase japanese eels in the lower reach of the tone river, we tracked them throughout a year using a fine- scale positioning system (vps) based on acoustic telemetry. the tracked eels were generally nocturnal, but not exclusively. they were mainly mobile from spring to autumn, with little or no activity observed during winter. a transport- release experiment showed that most eels returned to their original cap- ture area within 13 days after release. the eels had very small home ranges (mean ± s d = 0.085 ± 0.068 km2), core areas (0.014 ± 0.014 km2) and linear home ranges (744 ± 268 m). they also tended to be distributed on one particular side of the river (right or left bank) and in one particular shore type (revetment or vegetation), rarely moving from one to the other. this study provides evidence for nocturnal, dormancy, homing behaviours, limited habitat use and small home range size in japanese eels. the eels clearly showed strong fidelity to a “familiar” site, which contrasts with the long distances travelled during upstream and downstream migration phases in the river, and during spawning migrations in the ocean. k e y w o r d s acoustic telemetry, anguilla japonica, dormancy, home range, homing behaviour, vr2w positioning system 1 |  introduction anguillid eels are catadromous fish that have a unique life cycle: they undertake large- scale oceanic migrations between their off- shore spawning ground and growth habitats in continental waters during their life history. some temperate anguillid species such as the american eel (anguilla rostrata), european eel (anguilla anguilla) and japanese eel (anguilla japonica) are commercially important fishes that their recruiting glass eels are used in aquaculture (shiraishi & crook, 2015). however, fisheries catches of glass eels and juveniles have been in continuous decline throughout their distribution ranges since the 1970s and appear to have reached a critical situation in recent years (casselman, 2003; dekker et al., 2003; tsukamoto, aoyama, & miller, 2009). finally, these commercially important species have been classified as critically endangered (cr) or endangered (en) in the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list of threatened species (jacoby, casselman, delucia, hammerson, & gollock, 2014; jacoby & gollock, 2014a,b). these stock declines are believed to have resulted from a combination of oceanic and conti- nental factors (feunteun, 2002; itakura, kitagawa, miller, & kimura, ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:737–751. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  737 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd738  |     2015; kimura, inoue, & sugimoto, 2001; knights, 2003; tatsukawa, 2003). however, the relative importance of these factors remains un- clear making it difficult to establish effective conservation measures. between their two oceanic migrations, anguillid eels spend most of their time as yellow eels that exhibit sedentary behaviour in the coastal, estuarine or freshwater habitats. as only this stage can be partially managed by humans in addition to subsequent silver eel stage, it is important that the ecology of yellow eels, particularly the behavioural trait, such as their activity patterns, movements and home ranges, is clarified for the conservation and management of these species. understanding the behavioural traits of eels is not only economically important but also ecologically important in several re- gions of the world. yellow eels are usually one of the top predators in the continental waters because they feed on a wide range of aquatic animals, particularly benthic species and small fishes (dörner et al., 2009; itakura, kaino, miyake, kitagawa, & kimura, 2015; jellyman, 1989; wasserman, pereira- da- conceicoa, strydom, & weyl, 2012). in addition, they are also used as umbrella species because they are found in all water types, including coastal marine waters, estuaries, lagoons, marshes, rivers, lakes and streams. therefore, the behaviours of yellow eels may affect ecosystem dynamics through species interactions. the japanese eel spawns in the waters west of the mariana islands (tsukamoto et al., 2011) and the larvae of this species drift westwards to their growth habitats in east asia (kimura, döös, & coward, 1999; kimura, tsukamoto, & sugimoto, 1994). they then migrate into brack- ish and freshwater habitats where they grow as yellow eels. following metamorphosis into silver eels, they migrate out of rivers and estuaries and swim to their spawning areas (tsukamoto, 2009). there have been increasing numbers of studies on the ecology of the early life history in the open ocean (tsukamoto et al., 2011) and the habitat use patterns of yellow eels in recent years (kaifu, tamura, aoyama, & tsukamoto, 2010; tsukamoto & arai, 2001; yokouchi et al., 2012), but their behavioural traits in continental waters remain poorly understood. the behavioural traits of yellow eels have mainly been examined by acoustic telemetry. numerous telemetric studies have been car- ried out on the atlantic eels a. anguilla and a. rostrata and the new zealand eels anguilla australis and anguilla dieffenbachii. they have described the movements and time and space utilisation of eels in rivers (jellyman & sykes, 2003; ovidio, seredynski, philippart, & nzau matondo, 2013) and estuarine habitats (béguer- pon et al., 2015; hedger, dodson, hatin, caron, & fournier, 2010; parker, 1995; simpfendorfer, olsen, heupel, & moland, 2012; thibault, dodson, & caron, 2007; walker, godard, & davison, 2014). these studies have shown that yellow eels are principally nocturnal (hedger et al., 2010; jellyman & sykes, 2003; walker et al., 2014) and have decreased ac- tivity during winter. furthermore, while most eels overwinter in the same habitat as the one they occupy at other times of the year (ovidio et al., 2013), some move from brackish water estuaries to freshwa- ter rivers to overwinter (béguer- pon et al., 2015; hedger et al., 2010). the home range and homing behaviour of yellow eels have also been examined mainly in the european and american eels (hedger et al., 2010; ovidio et al., 2013; parker, 1995; thibault et al., 2007), and only one telemetric study has dealt with the japanese eel (aoyama et al., 2002) that examined diel activity and space utilisation of eels in the estuarine habitat. fixed- array acoustic telemetry has been shown to be an effec- tive method for determining the movement patterns of anguillid eels (béguer- pon et al., 2015; walker et al., 2014). however, this method only provides rough estimates of eel positions based on their proxim- ity to receivers and cannot be used to detect movements unless the eels move several hundred metres or more; and even where the posi- tions of eels could be estimated, their tracking durations were short. furthermore, although tracking acoustic telemetry using boats can also be used to estimate the positions of eels (aoyama et al., 2002; parker, 1995), it is difficult to track them continuously over a long pe- riod of time (kitagawa, nakata, kimura, sugimoto, & yamada, 2002). therefore, as eels need to be tracked for at least 1 year to investigate their seasonal activity patterns and long- term home ranges in detail, another technique is required. a fine- scale monitoring system (vr2w positioning system [vps]; vemco, halifax, canada) has recently been developed that allows the position of a target animal to be estimated with a horizontal error of several metres. vps has mainly been used to monitor the distribu- tion and behavioural traits of marine fishes (dance & rooker, 2015; mclean, simpfendorfer, heupel, dadswell, & stokesbury, 2014; özgül et al., 2015; reubens, pasotti, degraer, & vincx, 2013; teesdale, wolfe, & lowe, 2015; wolfe & lowe, 2015). however, it is also considered useful in rivers (steel, coates, hearn, & klimley, 2014) and has been applied to anguillid yellow and silver eels in recent years (jellyman & unwin, 2017; simpfendorfer et al., 2012). the objective of this study was to clarify the behavioural traits of yellow- phase japanese eels in the tone river using high- resolution tracking over a year. in particular, we focused on clarifying the diel and seasonal activities, homing behaviour and home range of yellow eels in their freshwater habitat. we tested (i) whether yellow eels represent nocturnal behaviour; (ii) whether activity of eels is dormancy in winter; (iii) whether eels return to a specific capture site after less than 1 km displacements and how quickly homing occurs; (iv) and estimated their home range sizes. moreover, the abundance and body condition of eels have previously been measured in revetment and vegetated non- revetment areas in the lower tone river (itakura, kaino, et al., 2015), but it was unclear whether the eels moved between the revetment and nonrevetment shoreline habitats. therefore, we also tested (v) whether the eels moved between the revetment and nonrevetment shoreline habitats. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area this study was conducted in the lower reaches of the tone river, japan, which empties into the pacific ocean (figure 1). this river is one of the largest rivers in japan, and it has the second longest stream length (322 km) and the largest basin area (16,840 km2). the slope of the riverbed in the downstream of this river is c. 1/9,000. itakura et al.(a) (b)     |  739 (c) 200 m figure 1 maps of the study area for the telemetry experiments using yellow- phase japanese eels (anguilla japonica) in the lower reach of the tone river system.

http://www. ktr.mlit.go.jp/tonege/tonege00049.html). the observed average cur- rent speed from august to october 2012 and from june to august 2013 was measured near the river bottom using electromagnetic current metres (compact- em; jfe advantech, nishinomiya, japan) c. 3–13 cm/s for three stations (centre of the river, right and left side of the river) in the study area (itakura et al., unpublished data). the riverbank of the study area consists of both sloping concrete revet- ment and vegetated nonrevetment areas (figure 1). the substrate on the river bottom consists of sand with fine soil and other fine- grained material (itakura, kaino, et al., 2015). the floodplain area of the study area is c. 100 m wide that consists of riparian forest and grassland. surrounding study area is rural zone, and there is no artificial light adjacent to the waterfront lines. the clarity of the water is very low (turbid water), although it was not recorded. to increase eel popula- tion, the stocking programme has been conducted by neighbouring fisheries cooperatives in some areas of this water system. in the lower reach, eels have been released into the tributaries (e.g., lakes kasumigaura, kitaura, imbanuma and teganuma; figure 1), while they have not been released in mainstream including the study area. since 2011, the eel stocking has never conducted in the lower reach of this water system. 2.2 | acoustic telemetry system we observed eel behaviours using vps- based acoustic telemetry. the system consisted of an array of more than three acoustic monitoring receivers (vr2w; vemco; seven receivers in this study) and synchro- nisation tags (sync tags) that were moored with each receiver to cor- rect clock drift. each receiver was equipped with a hydrophone that detected vemco- coded acoustic transmitters within the receivable range. the transmitters emitted a pulse at 69 khz that included an id number and allowing the identification of specific tags. each pulse was repeated after a random delay of between 70 and 150 s to minimise the probability of pulse collision among tags. prior to the deployment of the receivers, we conducted a range test to verify the acoustic range and detection efficiency of each receiver in order to determine the most appropriate array design for this study. a receiver was deployed 1 m above the river bottom in the study area, and a transmitter was deployed close to the river bottom. detection rates of various distances between the receiver itakura et al.740  |     and the transmitter were measured by moving the location of trans- mitter. this confirmed that the detection efficiency was high when the distance between a receiver and its coded tag was <400 m. therefore, seven receivers were placed within 400 m of each other so that their detection ranges overlapped, increasing the likelihood that a transmitter would be detected by three or more receivers (figure 1). each receiver was placed 1 m above the river bottom using an anchor block, ropes and surface buoys, and the sync tags were moored 1 m above their associated receivers. a reference tag (v16- 6h; vemco) was also placed within the array of receivers to correct the estimated eel positions, and this also recorded the water temperature. 2.3 | tagging procedure and experimental design japanese eels were caught using refuge traps and plastic eel pod traps within the fixed receiver array in the study area (figure 1; for more details, see itakura, kaino, et al., 2015). in 2012, we caught seven eels in the revetment area and three eels in the vegetated shore area on the right bank of the river from june to july. in addition, five eels that were caught inside the receiver array and two eels that were caught slightly outside the receiver array were provided by a fisherman from july to november 2012, although the exact captured locations of these eels were unknown. these eels were kept for less than 10 days in the study area of the tone table 1 detailed information about the tagged yellow- phase japanese eels (anguilla japonica) in the lower reach of the tone river body day tracked (all data) eel id eel 1 eel 2 eel 3 eel 4 eel 5 eel 6 eel 7 eel 8 eel 9 eel 10 eel 11 eel 12 eel 13 eel 14 eel 15 eel 16 eel 17 eel 18 eel 19 eel 20 eel 21 eel 22 eel 23 eel 24 eel 25 eel 26 eel 27 mean ± sd length (mm) weight (g) capture area capture release from to 547 557 532 523 537 535 530 599 541 543 531 546 548 542 560 528 595 698 630 690 560 615 582 561 655 560 603 572 ± 49 244 233 211 163 207 220 203 321 224 185 229 222 216 185 211 178 260 464 345 342 237 332 255 251 390 196 302 253 ± 72 v v v r r r r unidentified unidentified r r r unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified lake imbanuma v r r r v r r v r – 18 jun. 2012 18 jun. 2012 18 jun. 2012 18 jun. 2012 unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified unidentified 12 dec. 2012 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 27 jun. 2013 27 jun. 2013 3 jul. 2013 3 jul. 2013 – 19 jun. 2012 19 jun. 2012 19 jun. 2012 19 jun. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 11 nov. 2012 11 nov. 2012 11 nov. 2012 11 nov. 2012 11 nov. 2012 13 dec. 2012 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 27 jun. 2013 27 jun. 2013 3 jul. 2013 3 jul. 2013 – 20 jun. 2012 20 jun. 2012 29 jun. 2012 20 jun. 2012 2 jul. 2012 3 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 10 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 2 jul. 2012 12 nov. 2012 12 nov. 2012 12 nov. 2012 12 nov. 2012 13 nov. 2012 13 dec. 2012 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 15 jun. 2013 27 jun. 2013 28 jun. 2013 3 jul. 2013 3 jul. 2013 – 13 aug. 2012 25 may 2013 4 jul. 2012 23 may 2013 30 jun. 2013 18 jun. 2013 2 jul. 2013 11 jul. 2012 24 aug. 2012 1 jul. 2013 4 jul. 2012 8 jul. 2012 21 sep. 2013 7 apr. 2013 14 may 2013 13 dec. 2012 24 mar 2014 22 aug. 2013 4 oct. 2013 30 mar. 2014 16 may 2014 21 sep. 2013 16 may 2014 25 jan. 2014 13 jan. 2014 12 mar. 2014 17 sep. 2013 – r, revetment area;

(2007). we transported the eels to the laboratory for tagging, because it was necessary to confirm the degree of recovery after tag- ging in aquarium of the laboratory, and because the tagging and the following confirmation at the laboratory were easier than those at the field. we anaesthetised them with 2- phenoxyethanol (0.1%) and then measured the total length (tl, to the nearest mm) and body weight (bw, to the nearest g) of each eel. we surgically implanted an acoustic transmitter (v13- 1h; vemco; 36 mm long, 13 mm diameter, 11 g weight in air and 6 g weight in water, 70–150 s random delay interval, power output: 156 db) in the peritoneal cavity through a 20- mm- long ventral incision, which was then closed with one or two sutures. the tagged eels fully recovered from the anaesthesia as soon as they were returned to a bucket for anabiosis, and were released to the water between the revetment and vegetation shore areas during the day. the period between capture and release of the eels ranged from 1 day to 10 days. the mean ± sd of tl and bw of the released eels were 555 ± 41 mm and 232 ± 68 g respectively. tracked (hpe < 10) duration (days) 54 339 5 337 363 350 365 9 53 356 2 6 313 146 183 31 131 252 111 288 335 98 335 212 217 252 76 193 ± 134 no. of positions 2,642 1,785 103 235 3,615 1,048 1,348 59 33 3,012 61 56 5,290 2,809 1,766 748 139 621 1,922 3,652 20,100 2,680 845 30,375 4,334 26,174 6,814 4,528 ± 7,902 duration (days) 54 337 5 337 343 336 362 9 53 356 2 6 166 29 32 – – 156 107 184 334 88 334 201 162 231 76 172 ± 135 no. of positions 2,016 1,263 88 208 2,260 415 1,144 45 29 1,871 58 48 4,110 129 368 – 5 398 678 1,105 10,353 825 679 17,738 1,689 8,436 6,576 2,405 ± 4,121 transport distance (m) – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – 803 625 758 785 686 646 803 609 887 734 ± 96 time for homing (hr) core area (50% kud, km2) home range, (95% kud, km2) linear home range (m) – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – 279 36 319 150 13 3 277 – 112 149 ± 129 0.022 0.0453 – 0.011 0.0005 0.0225 0.0003 – – 0.0179 – – 0.0255 0.0103 0.0003 – – 0.0734 0.0447 0.0105 0.0023 0.0074 0.0198 0.0006 0.0074 – 0.001 0.0138 ± 0.0142 0.0846 ± 0.0682 0.1468 0.1802 – 0.139 0.0041 0.1363 0.0039 – – 0.1642 – – 0.1643 0.0894 0.0019 – – 0.3222 0.1903 0.0667 0.034 0.0344 0.089 0.0073 0.0532 – 0.0187 642 774 589 830 735 372 – – – 967 – – 1,085 730 112 – – 1,083 1,094 982 859 425 544 772 776 – 1,110 744 ± 268 itakura et al.742  |     in 2013, we conducted a transport- release experiment to examine whether japanese eels possess a homing ability. we caught six eels in the revetment area and three eels in the vegetated shore area be- tween june and july. the capture site, and types of fishing gears and transmitters that were used were the same as in the 2012 experiment, but the measurement and tagging of the eels were carried out in the field immediately following capture. after confirming that the tagged eels had fully recovered from the anaesthesia, we released the eels that had been captured in the revetment area into the vegetated shore area and vice versa a few hours after capture. the mean ± sd of tl and bw of the released eels were 606 ± 46 mm and 294 ± 63 g respec- tively. the positions of the capture and release points were recorded using a handy gps (gpsmap62sj; garmin), with the distance be- tween these positions (transport distance) ranging from 609 to 887 m (mean ± sd = 734 ± 96 m). eel 18 that was caught in lake imbanuma in 2012 and then released into the study area was deemed to larger- scale transport- release experiment (transport distance: c. 25 km). 2.4 | data analysis and statistics data were retrieved from the receivers every 2–3 months throughout the study period and sent to vemco for data processing to estimate the position of each eel by vps. this procedure involved using hy- perbolic positioning based on the time- difference- of- arrival (tdoa) among at three or more receivers to calculate a precise latitude and longitude for each tag transmission (smith, 2013). as we released the tagged eels during the daytime and they are mainly active at night, eel positions during the daytime on the day of release were removed from the dataset to minimise any artificial effect that release may have had on their activity. for individuals that were captured in 2013, data from after homing were used. we found that the pulses from the transmitters were less likely to be detected by the receivers, when there were obstacles between the tagged eels and receivers, even if the eels were distributed in the study area. this problem likely arose when the tagged eels sheltered in burrows such as mud, vegetation and other potential obstacles. therefore, as eels tend to hide in refuges during the day and only come out to feed at night (aoyama, shinoda, sasai, miller, & tsukamoto, 2005; tesch, 2003), we considered eels to be active when their positions were constantly detected and inactive when their positions were infrequently detected or undetected (less than two detected positions per day). the detection rate of positions during the daytime or at night was calculated by divid- ing the number of detection positions at that time by the total number of detection positions, using the sunrise and sunset times provided by the national astronomical observatory of japan (http://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ koyomi/dni/) to define the boundaries between day and night. to assess the fine- scale movement and habitat use patterns of the tagged eels, data were filtered by a horizontal position error (hpe), a relative, unitless measure of error sensitivity calculated by the vps (espinoza, farrugia, webber, smith, & lowe, 2011). a measure of actual positioning error (hpem) was available from the relocated positions of reference tag transmissions. for this study, an hpe filter of <10 was used following espinoza et al. (2011) and the mean ± sd of hpem was 2.24 ± 1.59 m. the distance travelled was defined as the straight- line distance between two consecutive detected positions, and the total distance travelled was defined as the sum of the distances travelled. the maximum distance travelled was defined as the straight- line distance between the most distant detected positions. these were calculated for every hour, day, month and study period. home range areas were estimated for all tagged eels using kernel utilisation distributions (kuds) derived from the kernelud function of the adehabitathr package in r statistical package 3.3.2 (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria). the 50% and 95% kud areas were considered repre- sentative of an animal’s core activity space (core area) and total activity space (home range) respectively. the kud was calculated using the ad hoc method to select the smoothing parameter (bandwidth). in addition, maximum distance travelled during the study period was defined as the linear home range (m). for the eels that were used in the transport- release experiment (2013), we used data from after homing to estimate the home ranges and core areas. parker (1995) defined homing success as the return of an eel to within a range of 300 m from the point where they were originally captured. however, their transport- release exper- iment was conducted at a much greater scale than our study (several tans of kilometres vs. < 1 km respectively). therefore, in our study, we used a smaller- scale range (100 m) to define homing success. all statistical analyses were performed with r statistical package 3.3.2. to assess the diel activity pattern of eels, we used a generalised linear mixed model (glmm; glmer in the package lme4), which included time (daytime or night- time) as a fixed effect and individual, month and year as random effects. to assess the seasonal activity pattern, we used a glmm that included season as a fixed effect and individual and year as random effects. in addition, to assess the relationship between the monthly activity and the water temperature, we used a glmm that in- clude the water temperature as a fixed effect and individual and year as random effects. in these analyses, we used the number of detected posi- tions (poisson distribution and log- link function) and the total or maximum distance travelled (gamma distribution and log- link function) as the de- pendent variables. when the effect of season was statistically significant, we further conducted all- pairwise multiple comparisons using the tukey– kramer method (glht in the package multcomp). for the seasonal analysis, we defined march–may as spring, june–august as summer, september– november as autumn and december–february as winter, and we used monthly average values as seasonal values. finally, we used a generalised linear model (glm; gamma distribution and log- link function) to test the relationship between water temperature at stop and start of activity and between tl, bw, tracked duration, number of detected positions and shore type (revetment, vegetation or both) and the various home range parameters (50% and 95% kuds and linear home range). all values re- ported in the following text are mean ± sd unless otherwise stated. 3 |  results 3.1 | tracking details details of the japanese eels that were tracked in this study are summa- rised in table 1. in total, 27 tagged eels were tracked and 33–30,375 itakura et al.positions per individual were estimated over periods of 2–365 days. many individuals were successfully tracked for approximately 1 year. however, the tracked durations were too short and/or the number of positions was insufficient for 7 of the 18 eels that were released in 2012 (eels 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16 and 17). therefore, as the data for these eels were further reduced following filtering in accordance with hpe < 10, they were excluded from the analyses. in addition, one of the nine eels that was released in 2013 (eel 26) never returned to the original capture area (see below) and only travelled a very short distance. these suggested that it probably died or lost the tag shortly after release or sheltered under potential obstacles, and so we also excluded this individual from the analyses. 3.2 | diel activity     |  743 approximately 65% of eel positions were detected at night, compared with 35% during the day. although eels moved regardless of the day or night, we also found that eels travelled greater distances at night than during the day (figure 3) in terms of the maximum distances travelled (144.5 ± 173.3 m vs. 57.6 ± 90.8 m respectively; glmm, χ2 = 247.4, df = 1, p < .001; figure 3a) and the total distances travelled (400.8 ± 434.5 m vs. 164.3 ± 279.9 m respectively; glmm, χ2 = 225.2, df = 1, p < .001; figure 3b). furthermore, the hourly maximum distances travelled were also longer at night than during the day, with two peaks observed: an initial peak immediately after sunset (18:00–20:00), which was particularly large, and a second peak just before sunrise (3:00–4:00; figure 3c). the longest and shortest distances travelled per hour were 95.1 ± 99.3 m at 19:00 and 10.2 ± 6.8 m at 14:00 respectively. although eel positions were detected regardless of the day or night, the number of detected positions at night was significantly higher than during the day (glmm: χ2 = 137,191, df = 1, p < .001; figure 2a). furthermore, although the detection rate of positions was higher dur- ing the day for some eels, it was higher at night for most (figure 2b). 3.3 | seasonal activity the monthly number of detected positions and the maximum and total distances travelled varied seasonally according to the water temperature (figure 4). the estimated coefficient of glmm showed that they were (a) (b) figure 2 diel activity pattern in tagged japanese eels (anguilla japonica) in the lower reach of the tone river.

(b) the proportion of positions detected during the night and day itakura et al.744  |     significantly increased when the water temperature increased (num- ber of detected position: coefficient ± se = 0.033 ± 0.0006, z = 56.72, p < .0001; travelled: coefficient = 0.075 ± 0.021, z = 3.54, p < .001), although relationship between the maximum dis- tances travelled and the water temperature was not significant (coef- ficient = 0.03 ± 0.02, z = 1.89, p = .059). total distance the positions of eels released in june and july 2012 were detected from summer to autumn (june to november) when the water tem- perature was relatively high (12.2–29.2°c), but generally not in winter (from december to february) when the water temperature was lower (5.4–7.2°c; figure 4a). indeed, the position of only one eel was de- tected in december. eel positions were then detected again when the water temperature began to rise in spring (march 2013), with detec- tions continuing through to summer (july), at which time the trans- mitter battery died. the positions of eels in spring were close to the area where the last positions were detected in the previous autumn, indicating that the tagged eels had remained inside the study area (detection range of the receiver) during winter. similarly, the maximum distance travelled was greater during warm months (june to october 2012 and march 2013 onwards) than during cold months (november to february), when it was almost zero. the positions of eels released in november and december 2012 were detected in the months of release and then from february 2013 on- wards, with no positions being detected from december to february, as was the case for the eels released in summer 2012 (figure 4b). by contrast, the positions of eels released in 2013 were continually de- tected from june 2013 to may 2014. however, the maximum distance travelled decreased after october, indicating a reduced activity of the eels during winter (figure 4c). the water temperatures at which the last and first positions of eels during the overwintering period were detected varied greatly between individuals (figure 5a). no significant relationship was found between water temperatures at end and start of activity (glm: p > .05) with eels stopping their activity in 2012 at the water temperatures ranging from 8.8 to 17.9°c (mean ± sd = 12.8 ± 2.8°c) and resuming their ac- tivity in 2013 at the water temperatures ranging from 9.1 to 15.7°c (mean ± sd = 12.6 ± 2.6°c). the seasonal number of detected positions and distances travelled for the eels released in 2012–2013 are shown in figure 5b,c. the num- ber of detected positions significantly differed between seasons (glmm: χ2 = 9580.7, df = 3, p < .001), with the numbers in spring and summer being significantly greater than in autumn and winter (tukey multiple comparisons test, p < .01). the total distance travelled also differed significantly between seasons (glmm: χ2 = 18.9, df = 3, p < .001), with higher values in summer than other seasons except winter (tukey mul- tiple comparisons test, p < .05). in addition, the maximum distance trav- elled in winter tended to be lower than in the other seasons, although this difference was not significant (glmm: χ2 = 7.0, df = 3, p = .07; figure 5d). 3.4 | homing behaviour nearly all eels that were displaced from their capture sites in 2013 left the release sites soon after being released and returned to their capture sites (figure 6). the homing duration ranged from 2.7 to 319.2 hr (162 min to 13.3 days; mean ± sd = 148.6 ± 128.9 hr or 6.2 ± 5.4 days). this homing behaviour mainly occurred at night regardless of time of release, with only eel 24 returning to its capture site immediately fol- lowing release during the day. after homing, these eels basically stayed around their original habitat, with the exception of eel 26, which never returned to its original capture site and instead remained near the release site; however, given the few movements for this eel dur- ing the study period, it is considered likely that it died or lost the tag near to the release site. the behaviours of eels that were released in 2012 supported the results in 2013. although the exact capture points were unknown, all eels that were released between the revetment and vegetated shore areas returned to their respective capture sites and subsequently remained around these sites. on the other hand, eel 18 that was captured in lake imbanuma in 2012 remained in the study area and moved greatly in the upstream or downstream directions (figure 6). 3.5 | home range and core area the home ranges and core areas varied widely among individu- als (table 1). the 95% kud home range of the tagged eels ranged from 0.002 to 0.190 km2 (mean ± sd = 0.085 ± 0.068 km2), while the (a) (b) (c) figure 3 diel movement patterns in tagged japanese eels (anguilla japonica) in the lower reach of the tone river.

and the 50% kud of two individuals (eels 2 and 27) was located near the centre of the river, although eel 2 only used areas near the vegetated shore. the 50% kud of eels significantly differed among habitats, being smaller for individuals distributed in the revetment area than for indi- viduals distributed in the vegetated shore area and both areas (glm: χ2 = 8.0, df = 2, p < .05, turkey multiple comparisons test: p < .05). there was no significant relationship between the 50% kud, 95% kud or linear home range and the other parameters measured (e.g., tl; glm: p > .05). 4 |  discussion in this study, we conducted fine- scale behavioural monitoring of yellow- phase japanese eels in a freshwater habitat using acoustic te- lemetry (vps). our study successfully tracked eels for approximately (a) (b) (c) figure 4 monthly activities of tagged japanese eels (anguilla japonica) in the lower reach of the tone river. each panel represents a different release season: (a) seven eels released in june and july 2012;

(ii) they are mainly active from spring to autumn, becoming dormant or little activity in winter (below c. 13°c), suggesting dormancy; (iii) they possess a homing ability that allows them to return to the original habitat from at least 1 km away (609– 887 m); and (iv) they display a small home range over a year; (v) they tended to be distributed on one particular side of the river (right or left bank) and in one particular shore type (revetment or vegetation), rarely moving from one to the other. these indicate their strong fidel- ity to “familiar” sites, which contrasts with their long migrations during the other life stages. 4.1 | diel activity the number of detected positions of yellow- stage japanese eels was greater at night than during the day, suggesting that they were more mobile at night, and a majority potentially sheltered in mud, vegeta- tion and other potential obstacles during the day. in addition, the maximum and total distances travelled at night were greater than during the day, supporting previous studies that these fish are noc- turnal in their freshwater habitat. this nocturnal behaviour may be related to their foraging being based on olfaction rather than visual cues (barbin, 1998; glova & jellyman, 2000; hedger et al., 2010; riley, walker, bendall, & ives, 2011) as well as reducing the risks of predation (glova & jellyman, 2000). eel 18 was exclusively mobile at night, implying this was perhaps behaviour for reducing some risks because of no “familiar” site in the study area. we also found two peaks in the distance travelled, which occurred just after sunset and before sunrise, matching previous findings for a. australis and a. di- effenbachia in the field (jellyman & sykes, 2003) and a. japonica in the laboratory (sudo & tsukamoto, 2015). yellow eels inhabiting the study area forage both nocturnal and diurnal aquatic organisms (itakura, kaino, et al., 2015), and both of them likely active during these boundary times between day and night. therefore, as the avail- ability of possible prey items for eels is probably increased during these times, increased activity of the eels during these periods may allow them to obtain many food items more effectively, and so these activity rhythms may be a common behavioural trait among anguillid eel species. there is a growing concern about the potential impact of increas- ing levels of artificial light on ecosystems throughout the northern itakura et al.    |  747 figure 6 trajectories of the homing behaviour, home range (95% kernel utilisation distribution [kud]) and core area (50% kud) for each tagged japanese eel (anguilla japonica) that was released in 2012 (eel18) and 2013 (eel19–27). white and black triangles indicate the capture and release points respectively. black bold and grey thin lines indicate revetment and vegetated shore areas respectively. the upper and lower banks indicate the left and right banks respectively. the numbers in the bottom left corner of each graph represent the eelid hemisphere (longcore & rich, 2004), with walker et al. (2014) high- lighting the need to investigate the influence of light pollution on the behaviours of eels. here, we detected diel changes in the activities of japanese eels and found that 35% of eel positions were detected during the daytime, which may be attributed to weaker nocturnality than previous findings (aoyama et al., 2002; jellyman & sykes, 2003), as also observed in a. anguilla (walker et al., 2014), or overcast con- ditions reducing the light intensity, as observed by baras, jeandrain, serouge, and philippart (1998) and labar, hernando casal, and delgado (1987). however, it will be necessary to compare these be- haviours under different light intensities to further understanding the effect of light pollution on this species. 4.2 | seasonal activity we detected a clear seasonality in the activity of yellow- phase japanese eels in this freshwater habitat. these eels were mainly mo- bile from spring to autumn when the water temperature was high, exhibiting little or no activity during winter when the water tempera- ture was below c. 13°c. furthermore, as no individual appeared to leave the study area, these eels probably overwintered in burrows within the study area. the positions of eels released in 2013 were also detected during the winter; however, the distances travelled were shorter than during summer and autumn, suggesting seasonality in their activity. this reduced activity in winter may be associated with itakura et al.748  |     figure 7 the home range (95% kernel utilisation distribution [kud]) and core area (50% kud) for each tagged japanese eel (anguilla japonica) that was released in 2012. black bold and grey thin lines indicate revetment and vegetated shore areas respectively. upper and lower banks indicate the left and right banks respectively. the numbers in the bottom left corner of each graph represent the eel id. eels 1 and 2 were captured in the vegetated area, while eels 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 were captured in the revetment area. the captured areas of the other eels were unidentified. these tagged eels were released at the boundary between the revetment and vegetated shore areas on the right bank the water temperature being too low for activity, which is consistent with the previous finding that eels have little or no activity at low tem- peratures (itakura, kaino, et al., 2015). these seasonal activity patterns led to seasonal changes in their feeding activity. the inactivity or reduced activity of eels in winter that was observed in the present study indicates that their feeding activity reduced in this season. anguillid eels are generally known to exhibit seasonal changes in feeding activity (tesch, 2003), with their appetites being lost during winter as indicated by empty stomachs or an inac- tivity compared with other seasons. according to matsui (1972), the japanese eel stops feeding when the water temperature falls below the optimal range (13.2–25°c), which corresponds with our finding of inactivity below c. 13°c. however, the water temperature at which japanese eels ceased activity in the present study (13°c) was higher than in related species. for example, the activity of the european eel also declines with a de- crease in water temperature (baras et al., 1998), but maximum and minimum distances travelled were recorded at 12°c in spring and 3°c in winter respectively (ovidio et al., 2013), and the activities of the a. australis and a. dieffenbachii decline when the water temperature falls below 6°c (jellyman, 1991, 1997), with no dramatic differences in activities between varying temperatures above this level (jellyman & sykes, 2003). the water temperatures in the habitat of a. anguilla range from 0 to 21.4°c, with a mean of c. 10°c, while those in the hab- itat of a. australis and a. dieffenbachii range from 6.1 to 20.5°c, with a mean of c. 12.3°c (jellyman & sykes, 2003; ovidio et al., 2013). by itakura et al.contrast, the monthly mean water temperatures experienced by the japanese eel in the present study ranged from 5.4°c (january 2013) to 29.2°c (august 2012), with a mean of 16.7°c (july 2012–june 2013), which is higher than those experienced by the other species. therefore, these interspecific differences in the relationship between water temperature and activity may be related to the water tempera- tures these species experience in their habitats. it has recently been shown that japanese eels inhabiting saline habitats exhibit feeding activity through the year (katahira, mizuno, & nagasawa, 2016) and have longer active and feeding durations than eels in freshwater habitats, which has been attributed to the warmer water temperatures in saline habitats during winter (kaifu et al., 2013). thus, it appears that japanese eels inhabiting saline habitats are also mobile during winter. as differences in the duration of activity influ- ence eel growth, it will be necessary to monitor eels in saline habitats using acoustic telemetry over the course of a year to fully understand their seasonal activity in various growth habitats. 4.3 | homing behaviour and home range in the transport- release experiment, most eels that were placed outside their home range returned to their respective capture site, indicating a homing ability in this species. such a homing ability has previously been observed in european and american eels (barbin, 1998; lamothe, gallagher, chivers, & moring, 2000; parker, 1995; tesch, 1967, 1975). these previous studies have reported the abil- ity of eels to return to their original habitat from several kilometres to several hundred kilometres away or from different water systems, whereas in the present study, we found that eels returned to their original habitat when they were displaced by <1 km. in addition to this small- scale homing in their growth habitat, anguillid eels also ex- hibit large- scale natal homing during which they return to their oce- anic spawning ground, which is located thousands of kilometres away from their continental growth habitat (schmidt, 1922; tsukamoto et al., 2011). therefore, it seems likely that all anguillid eels possess a homing ability irrespective of the distance and where they are in the life cycle. in addition to this homing behaviour, we also found that yellow- phase japanese eels have limited habitat use. even though most tagged individuals were tracked for nearly a year and the study river contained various different habitats, the home range, core area and linear home range of each individual were very small, with little emi- gration from the detectable range of the receiver array. moreover, eels rarely distributed near the centre of the river, implying that the centre of the river is less attractive habitat for eels. the average current speed of this area was faster than that near the banks (itakura et al., unpub- lished data) and so this area was more strongly affected by the flood. therefore, there may be less burrow and food availabilities in this area than that of near the banks. furthermore, eels rarely moved between the right and left banks, or between the revetment and vegetated shore areas. together, these results suggest strong fidelity of yellow- phase japanese eels to “familiar” sites, which contrasts with the long distances they travel during their upstream and downstream migration     |  749 phases in the river, and their spawning migrations in the ocean. these limited habitat uses may be strongly influenced by burrow and food availabilities and individual density. therefore, to further understand for habitat use of eels, experiment under controlled environmental condition is required. in summary, the yellow- phase japanese eels examined in this study exhibited nocturnal and dormancy behaviours, being mobile mainly at night and having decreased activity levels during winter. during the day and winter (inactive periods), eels tend to hide in ref- uges such as holes, crevices and burrows in the mud (aoyama et al., 2005; tesch, 2003). therefore, potential refuge sites for yellow- phase japanese eels should be preserved to conserve their stock in fresh- water habitats. moreover, we found that this species has strong site fidelity, as indicated by their homing habits and small home ranges over the course of a year. thus, it is possible that eels that have settled are unlikely to change their habitats, although some eels may exhibit habitat shifts between freshwater and saline water (kaifu et al., 2010; yokouchi et al., 2012). the eels were distributed in habitats near both shore types (re- vetment or vegetation) but rarely moved between the two. itakura, kaino, et al. (2015) previously showed that yellow eels occupying the natural shore areas at this location had better body conditions and higher levels of food consumption than those occupying in the re- vetment areas. thus, it appears that eels remained in the revetment area over a long period of time despite the lower food availability potentially causing poorer body conditions. therefore, for the con- servation of eel stocks, it is necessary to protect the habitats from anthropogenic impacts that will reduce the structural diversity of the river bottom and shores, as these are important refuges for eels and their prey. acknowledgements we are deeply grateful to toshiharu ohta of the imbanuma fisheries cooperative association for assisting with the fieldwork. we also thank tsubasa kaino, aigo takeshige and hiroaki onda for their help in the fieldwork. this study was partly supported by the river fund of the river foundation, japan, and was also supported in part by the futaba electronics memorial foundation. this study was partly sup- ported by grant- in- aid for jsps research fellow jp 13j06053 to hi. we thank five anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. we attend a lecture for animal experiment in the university of tokyo prior to conducting this study. orcid hikaru itakura http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8596-5407 references aoyama, j., sasai, s., miller, m. j., shinoda, a., nakamura, a., kawazu, k., & tsukamoto, k.
