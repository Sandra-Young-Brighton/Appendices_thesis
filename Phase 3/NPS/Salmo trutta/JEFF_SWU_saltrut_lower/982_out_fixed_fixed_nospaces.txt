e-mail: oberdorf@mnhn.fr accepted for publication december 8, 2006 introduction the accelerating rate of extinction of plants and animals because of anthropogenic impacts in ecosys- tems is a world-wide crisis (myers et al. 2000). the problem is particularly severe in freshwater habitats, which are among the world’s most threatened ecosys- tems (sala et al. 2000), with a projected extinction rate of about ﬁve times greater than the average species extinction rate for terrestrial fauna. to mitigate these projected losses, to develop a deeper understanding of that determine aquatic diversity at different spatial scales. only when this understanding is achieved we will be it the factors and processes is vital able to predict the effects of global climatic changes, habitat loss and fragmentation on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. concerning riverine ﬁshes, while a considerable proportion of species is concentrated in the tropics (gue´gan et al. 1998), relatively little is known about the patterns of assemblage composition and distribution within and among rivers under natural conditions (lewis et al. 2006; le´veˆque 2006). this scarcity of data for most tropical rivers precludes accurate prediction of effects of human-induced pert- urbations on these systems. indeed, existing models of the structure of riverine ﬁsh assemblages are still largely based on patterns observed in temperate areas (see tejerina-garro et al. 2005 for a review) and there doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00222.x 315 ibanez et al. is thus an urgent need for ﬁeld data in tropical species rich areas to assess the generality of the patterns previously observed in temperate rivers. tropical to further the understanding of river assemblages we undertook an exploratory study to give a qualitative description of the ecological factors that are most important in determining the patterns of ﬁsh distribution and assemblage structure in streams and rivers of gabon (west-central africa). we focused on two main characteristics of assemblage structure: species richness and trophic traits. longitudinal changes in local assemblage richness have long been noted along the length of temperate streams and rivers (see matthews 1998 for a review). the local assemblage richness usually increases along the upstream–downstream gradient. this increase is often attributed to a downstream increase in habitat size, habitat diversity or both (e.g., measured as a function of stream width, volume, stream discharge, stream order, drainage basin area, stream depth, current velocity and substrate composition) (sheldon 1968; gorman & karr 1978; horwitz 1978; schlosser 1982; balon et al. 1986; rahel & hubert 1991; paller 1994; belliard et al. 1997; oberdorff et al. 2001; grenouillet et al. 2004). the studies conducted in tropical systems reveal patterns that generally agree with patterns from temperate regions but were most often spatially limited to a single stream or river (bussing & lopez 1977; sydenham 1977; angermeier & karr 1983; hugueny 1990; winemiller & leslie 1992; me´rigoux et al. 1998; ibarra & stewart 1989; tito de morais & lauzanne 1994; mazzoni & lobon- cervia 2000). to address role of environmental factors on the functional aspect of ﬁsh assemblages, some authors have used different ecological attributes of species (i.e., reproductive, trophic or morphological traits) to explain assem- blage structure (angermeier & karr 1983; schlosser 1987; oberdorff et al. 1993, 2002; chipps et al. 1994; belliard et al. 1997; me´rigoux et al. 1998; kamdem-toham & teugels 1998; lamouroux et al. 2002). concerning trophic traits, oberdorff et al. (1993, 2002) working on temperate rivers, have shown longitudinal trends in ﬁsh trophic groups and a few similar studies conducted in tropical streams seem to conﬁrm such trends (angermeier & karr 1983; kamdem-toham & teugels 1998; pouilly et al. 2006), thus suggesting possible convergence in trophic structure between temperate and tropical assemblages. explicitly the potential our main objectives in this study, therefore, were to: (i) examine the longitudinal patterns of faunal composition exhibited by ﬁshes in different river basins of gabon and (ii) determine the main environ- mental factors responsible for the variation in local 316 assemblage richness and trophic structure at this relatively large spatial scale. our intention was to look for potential patterns of similarity in ﬁsh assemblage attributes richness and trophic guilds) between temperate and tropical rivers. in other words we wanted to assess broadly the degree of convergence in these assemblage traits from temperate and tropical systems. species (i.e., methods regional description and choice of sites on a continental scale, gabon belongs to the ichthyo- geographical province of lower-guinea which contains all of the western hydrographical systems between the cross basin in the north and the congolese basin in the south (roberts 1975; lavoue´ et al. 2004; le´veˆque & paugy 2006). this province is characterised by both a high diversity (more than 500 species reported) and a high level of endemism (around 54%: teugels & gue´gan 1994; stiassny et al. in press). most of the country is covered in dense equatorial rain forests, which are actually threatened by timber exploitation and burn agriculture (kamdem-toham & teugels 1998). the interior of gabon rises in a series of steps to the central african plateau. in the north, the crystal mountains enclose the valleys of the woleu and ntem rivers as well as the ivindo river basin. in southern gabon, the coastal plain is dominated by granite hills and almost the entire country is situated on the ogowe river with its two major tributaries, the n’gounie and ivindo rivers. the study was conducted in 52 sites within the six major river basins of gabon (i.e., the ogowe basin (32 sites; total drainage area of the basin 205,000 km2), the nyanga basin (10 sites; total drainage area of the basin 20,062 km2), the ntem basin (four sites; total drainage area of the basin 31,000 km2), the komo basin (three sites; total drainage area of the basin 7900 km2), the mbini basin (three sites; total drainage area of the basin 13,694 km2) and the noya basin (one site; total drainage area of the basin 8500 km2); (fig. 1). originally, the sampling design was conceived to get a representative picture of ﬁsh assemblages across all gabonian river systems. unfor- tunately, we were unable to reach this goal mostly because a majority of the sites originally preselected on geographical maps were not physically accessible. we are thus conscious that some of the river basins analysed here are highly under-sampled, which slightly weakens the generality of the patterns noticed. however, as the sampling effort was fairly propor- tional to the size of each drainage basin, we feel conﬁdent about the representativeness of our ﬁndings. fish assemblages structure and function sites rivers tributaries lakes and lagoons 0 100 50 km fig. 1. map of gabon showing sites location (see appendix 1 for sites description). 317 ibanez et al. fish sampling fish assemblages were sampled between february and october 2001 following a standardised protocol. depending on river width and depth two different sampling techniques were used. for small streams (mean width £10 m, mean depth ¼ 1 m), as water conductivity (con) was too low to employ electro- ﬁshing, we used the ichtyotoxin sampling method. length of stream sampled was typically around 100 m and covered all habitat types in the vicinity (e.g., rifﬂes, runs and pools). for each site, both edges of the sampled area were blocked by closing nets (1 mm mesh size). liquid rotenone was poured out around 10 m upstream of the ﬁrst (upstream) blocking net. rotenone dilution was calculated following finlayson et al. (2000) and its concentration in water was kept more or less constant for at least 1 h. potassium permanganate, simultaneously with the ichtyotoxin, was poured out below the second blocking net to eliminate the effect of the later downstream of the sampled site. for larger streams (mean depth >1 m) a set of seven monoﬁlament gill nets (25 m long by 1.5 m high) of mesh size varying between 8 and 45 mm between knots (i.e., 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35 and 45 mm) was deployed for 24 h (i.e., the nets were placed at dawn, checked once just before dusk and deﬁnitely removed after 24 h). one net of each mesh size was extended perpendicular across the river channel at each site in a random order with around 10 m maintained between nets. although this last sampling technique is passive and consequently may not have yielded a complete inven- tory of all species, we combined these data with those obtained for small streams as our purpose here was only to give a qualitative picture of ﬁsh assemblages structure along environmental gradients in rivers of gabon. fishes were ﬁxed in a 10% formalin solution and brought to the laboratory for identiﬁcation of the species or genus level (stiassny et al. in press). environmental variables besides the geographical position measured with a gps 12xl garmin, a total of nine variables were used to describe environmental conditions at each of the 52 sites. as factors that inﬂuence ﬁsh distribution may operate at different spatial scales (see tejerina-garro et al. 2005 for a review) we included in the analyses sets of environmental variables differing in spatial coverage. six geomorphological and chemical varia- bles were used to describe local environmental conditions. these variables were elevation (ele, m), (stg; visually assessed in four stream gradient categories: very steep, steep, moderate and slight), mean stream width (stw, m), mean stream depth 318 )1) and ph (ph). two (dep, m), con (lsæcm variables were used to describe the site spatial position within the upstream–downstream gradient. these variables were distance of the site from sources (dis, km) and surface area of the drainage (sad, km2) basin upstream of the site. one regional scale variable (i.e., basin unit) was used as a synthetic descriptor of regional environmental constraint for ﬁshes. mean depth was measured by cross-stream transects at 3–5 m intervals (depending on the stream size), with sampling points spaced 1 m apart. the variables ele, dis, and sad were estimated using a geographic information system developed by world wildlife fund (wwf) gabon. trophic groups the adult feeding habits of all collected species were drawn from the literature (available on request) at the genera or species level when available. each species was assigned into trophic groups as invertivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous/detritivorous and piscivo- rous based on its principal adult food as indicated by the literature (paugy & le´veˆque 2006) supple- mented with informations provided in fishbase: http://www.ﬁshbase.org. data analysis correspondence multidimensional statistical analysis seventy-eight species that were captured at more than 5% of the 52 sites were used in the multidimensional analysis. species captured at <5% of the sites were omitted from canonical analysis (cca) because rare species typically have a minor inﬂuence on results of multivariate statistics and can be perceived as outliers in ordinations (gauch 1982). environmental variables were log-transformed when necessary prior to analysis. associations between ﬁsh assemblages (presence–absence) and environmental variables were quantiﬁed by using cca (canoco version 4.5; ter braak & smilauer 2002). cca is a nonlinear ordination technique especially designed for direct analysis of the relationships between multiva- riate ecological data sets (ter braak & smilauer 2002). signiﬁcance tests for relating assemblage structure to environmental variables were based on monte carlo permutation tests (1000 permutations). the environmental variables entering the cca were selected using the forward selection of canoco (monte carlo tests, 1000 permutations). the general model regression tree analysis assemblage structure was also analysed based on species richness and species trophic composition. we used here the total number of species actually captured during the study. species trophic composition was calculated as the proportion richness (i.e., the number of species in each trophic group divided by the total number of species). we used regression tree analysis (rta), a binary partitioning technique (breiman et al. 1984) to pre- dict species richness and species composition from the 10 environmental variables described above. regression trees were only recently recognised as powerful tools for modelling ecological data (de’ath & fabricius 2000) and used in aquatic ecology (magnuson et al. 1998; rathert et al. 1999; olden & jackson 2002; hershey et al. 2005). the approach is robust to nonlinear data and interactions among variables, and accepts categorical and continuous variables. for each partition, rta selects the variable that minimises the residual sum of squares (rss) of the two subgroups, relative to the parent group. the values of the selected explanatory variable over each subset deﬁne a splitting threshold, and the mean of the dependent variable values in each subgroup is the predicted value for this subgroup. this process is recursively and independently continued on each subgroup, checking all divisions and variables, until additional splits provide minor further reduction in the rss. splitting was stopped when nodes contained <5 sites. to determine the optimal size of each tree, the mode of 50 repeated cross-validations using the one standard-error rule was used. rta analyses were performed using systat 11. results a total of 238 species of ﬁshes were collected (appendix 1), of which more than 50% were present at only one site. cyprinids were the most abundant taxon with 22% of the species, followed by cichlids (16%), mormyrids (11%) and alestiids (10%). the remaining 41% were members of 22 different families. according to stiassny et al. in press, we sampled during this study around 70% of strictly freshwater ﬁsh species known to be present in gabonian rivers. fish assemblages structure and function we can thus consider that our sample is fairly representative of the global structure of the potential ﬁsh fauna expected in this area. general trends in the distribution of species correlation coefﬁcients among continuous numeric environmental variables are shown in table 1. the two variables reﬂecting sites spatial position along the longitudinal gradient (i.e., sad and dis) were highly correlated (r ¼ 0.978, p < 0.001), as expected. these two variables were also highly and positively correlated with the two local habitat variables dep and stw, reﬂecting the increase in habitat size and volume along the upstream–downstream gradient. the ﬁshing method (fim) and (ele), the cca for all samples combined showed the overall relationships between species distribution and environmental variables (table 1, fig. 2). among all the environmental variables initially included in the analysis, only six were signiﬁcantly related to assem- blage structure and cca components 1 and 2 together explained 57.3% of the total variation in distribution among sites of the 78 retained species. the cca showed that the ﬁrst axis was mainly related to the sad, thus reﬂecting the samples position along the longitudinal gradient. along axis 2, variation was mainly related to the con, the fim used and the sites belonging to the nyanga basin. following the ﬁrst two cca compo- nents, four main groups of species were distinguished. the ﬁrst one, (e.g., amphilius baudoni, fundulopan- chax batesii, aphyosemion cameronense, clarias jaensis, matacembelus niger, neolebias trewavasae, microctenopoma nanum, clarias camerunensis, bar- bus camptacanthus, amphilius pulcher, epiplatys neumanni, clarias platycephalus, clarias pachynema and barbus brazzai), with high positive scores, was representative of upstream areas. the second one, with positive scores on axis 1 and negative scores on axis 2, and constituted by species like parananochromis gabonicus, paramormyrops gabonensis and anaspi- doglanis macrostoma, was more typical of elevated upstream areas. the third group, (e.g., pollimyrus table 1. pearson’s correlations between continuous environmental variables for the 52 sites analysed. sad (ln) dis (ln) ele (ln) stw (ln) dep (ln) con (ln) ph sad (ln) dis (ln) ele (ln) stw (ln) dep (ln) con (ln) ph 1.000 0.978* )0.398 0.853* 0.725* 0.230 0.222 1.000 )0.392 0.846* 0.756* 0.237 0.252 1.000 )0.220 )0.012 )0.654* )0.581* 1.000 0.875* 0.056 0.128 1.000 )0.093 0.016 1.000 0.713* *p < 0.001. con, conductivity;

appendix 3a, b). longitudinal patterns of species addition and/or replacement have long been noted along the length of temperate and tropical streams and rivers (see tejerina-garro et al. 2005 for a review). these longitudinal patterns have been attributed to temperature and other habitat requirements or disper- sal boundaries (huet 1959; gorman & karr 1978; horwitz 1978; balon et al. 1986; rahel & hubert 1991; belliard et al. 1997; kamdem-toham & teugels 1998; matthews & matthews 2000). in our study, results of the ordination analysis suggest the presence of four main assemblages: assemblages typical of elevated headwaters with low conductance (mostly representative of the upper ogowe basin); assem- blages typical of less elevated headwaters with higher conductance; assemblages typical of lowland waters with low conductance (mostly representative of the ogowe basin); assemblages typical of lowland waters with higher conductance (mostly representative of the nyanga basin). taking apart the processes acting at the intra-basin scale, our results also highlight the strong role of river basins themselves in deﬁning local assemblages composition (matthews 1998). in our ordination analysis both the ogowe and the nyanga basins display signiﬁcant effects on species presence/ absence. this result was expected as the absence of migration between rivers over large temporal scales implies that extinction and speciation processes are speciﬁc of each river basin. for example, a recent fish assemblages structure and function work realised in the ogowe basin (gabon) shows that in situ speciation of ﬁsh species belonging to the mormyridae family has greatly contributed to the high degree of endemism (around 30%) occurring in this basin (sullivan et al. 2002). consequently, complete answers in the explanation of local ﬁsh assemblage distribution must address the relative importance of regional scale (basin scale) processes, which determine the species available to occur locally, and small-scale processes, which should limit the number of species that actually occur locally (angermeier & winston 1998). local assemblage richness according to the rta, sad basin and ph were the most important descriptors of lsr in our study. the increase in local ﬁsh species richness with increasing stream size (e.g., sad) is one of the most well-known patterns in riverine ﬁsh assemblages (fig. 3). the rise in species richness is generally attributed to an absolute increase in available habitat, an increase in habitat heterogeneity, and a decrease in environmental ﬂuctuations from upstream to downstream resulting in increased within habitat specialisation (see matthews 1986; tejerina-garro et al. 2005 for in upstream areas (sad <4900 km2) species richness was around two times less in acidic catchments than in circumneutral ones. this pattern has already been observed in temperate (townsend et al. 1983; turnpenny et al. 1987; peterson & gale 1991) and tropical (lowe-mcconnell 1991) rivers and is gen- erally attributed to physiological stress and/or lower productivity levels in these types of systems (e.g., lack of primary production and aquatic insects). reviews). local assemblage trophic structure in the present study, proportion of omnivores and herbivores/detritivores size, increased with river table 2. results of canonical correspondence analysis for ﬁsh assemblages of gabon. variable correlations of environmental variables with ordinations axes ogowe sad fim con nyanga ele summary statistics for ordination axes eigenvalues species–environment correlations axis l )0.015 )0.921 )0.716 )0.542 )0.289 0.593 0.511 0.906 axis 2 )0.303 )0.214 )0.627 0.637 0.627 )0.576 0.224 0.903 axis 3 0.008 )0.083 0.056 0.005 0.458 )0.102 0.196 0.757 refer appendices 1 and 2 for sites and species code. variables signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 are shown in bold. monte carlo probability for signiﬁcance of the sum of all eigenvalues (1000 permutations) ¼ 0.001. con, conductivity;

lowe-mcconnell 1991; oberdorff et al. 1993, 2002; chipps et al. 1994; kamdem-toham & teugels 1998; pouilly et al. 2006). for example oberdorff et al. (1993, 2002) working on french rivers showed a transition from insectivorous to omnivorous and piscivorous species from upstream to downstream areas. (1991) suggested some general tendencies in african rivers like a higher abundance of surface-eating insectivores and omnivores consuming riparian allochthonous material in the upper course, and the presence of herbivores and benthic detritivores in the lower course. kamdem-toham & teugels (1998) working on small streams of the lower ntem river basin (west central africa) conﬁrmed these patterns. more recently, a study of several streams in the upper amazon basin found that trophic composition of local assemblages lower altitudes, with a became more diverse at decrease in the relative number of invertivorous species and an increase in the relative number of detritivorous, algivorous and piscivorous species (pouilly et al. 2006). similarities in these patterns between temperate and tropical rivers suggest that trophic diversity of ﬁsh assemblages may be related in part to food availability (lotrich 1973; angermeier & karr 1983) and that food availability may be inﬂuenced, in turn, by common environmental longitudinal gradient shared by these rivers. along the constraints the river continuum concept (rcc) hypothesises that those interactions between the physical environ- ment and the organic energy base (allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter) result in a predictable pattern of riverine assemblage structure from upstream to downstream areas (vannote et al. 1980; minshall et al. 1985). while the original rcc dealt only minimally with ﬁsh, it seems logical to expect also a gradual change in ﬁsh assemblage structure along some downstream continuum if streams lack abrupt thermal or geological transitions (oberdorff et al. 1993; matthews 1998). in other words, if the rcc hypothesis is correct we should expect convergence in the trophic structure of ﬁsh assemblages for temperate 324 and tropical rivers. our results seem to corroborate this hypothesis. nevertheless, our study was only explor- atory and if we are to advance further in testing convergence, then we should aim for studies that formally compare ﬁsh assemblages of different regions and/or continents. although there are major uncertainties in identify- ing and quantifying the appropriate habitat features that represent selective forces on biotic assemblages (poff 1997), we do believe that convergence testing is a powerful method to assess the generality of some patterns observed locally, and hopefully of the processes causing these patterns. from a conservation standpoint, these results high- light the need to evaluate all habitat types along the river longitudinal gradient to integrate the full spec- trum of species assemblages within conservation plans. position of the site within the watershed, site elevation, stream width, stream depth, water ph and water conductance appear to be the most inﬂuential factors in shaping species assemblages, and should be taken into consideration when deﬁning aquatic habitat types for conservation planning and integrated river basin management. acknowledgements ichthyologist at the africa in memory of guy teugels, museum (tervuren, belgium), who directed the systematic aspect of this work and along with thierry
