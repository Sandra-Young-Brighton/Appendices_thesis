phenotypic plasticity; salmonids; river hydrology introduction local adaptation within a species can be deﬁned as ‘the increase in frequency of traits that enhance survival or reproductive success of individuals pos- sessing such traits’ (taylor 1991). local adaptation in ﬁsh is commonly observed, with environmentally induced phenotypic variation resulting in populations differing in morphology, behaviour, physiology and ⁄ or life history (taylor 1991). morphological variation between ﬁsh populations is inﬂuenced by a mixture of environmental factors that include, but are limited to, not temperature, salinity, radiation, dis- solved oxygen, water depth and ﬂow velocity (hubbs 1926; vladykov 1934; smith 1966; lindsey 1988; turan 2000). in addition, biotic factors, such as competition and predation, are also known to inﬂuence morphological variation in ﬁshes (bro¨nmark & miner 1992; langerhans et al. 2004; heynen et al. 2010). stream-dwelling ﬁshes are exposed to considerable environmental variation over their natural population range, as streams can differ markedly in their hydrau- lic properties, depending on the amount and timing of rainfall, rainfall and the relative contribution of correspondence: t. j. drinan, school of biological, earth and environmental sciences, university college cork, distillery fields, north mall, cork, ireland. e-mail: tomdrinan@gmail.com 420 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00561.x morphological variability of atlantic salmon s. salar and brown_trout s. trutta groundwater to their ﬂows, and the channel gradient and substrate type. the atlantic salmon salmo_salar l. is well known to exhibit environmentally induced morphological variation (obedzinski & letcher 2004; von cramon-taubadel et al. 2005). differences in the hydraulic environment are thought to be the main driver of such morphological variation, salmon typically having larger ﬁns and a more fusiform body shape in faster ﬂowing environments (riddell & leggett 1981; taylor 1986). similar ﬁndings of ﬂow-mediated mor- phological variation have also been demonstrated for other nonsalmonid ﬁsh species (langerhans et al. 2003, 2007; sidlauskas et al. 2006). brown_trout salmo_trutta l. have also been the subject of many morphological studies. most of these, however, have sought to distinguish between distinct subpopulations or subspecies, as the species is highly variable across its range (e.g. ferguson & taggart 1991; lahnsteiner & jagsch 2005; simonovic´ et al. 2007; hermida et al. 2009). few studies that have examined changes in s. trutta morphology in relation to contrasting environmental conditions have gener- ally found that they develop longer pectoral ﬁns and shallower bodies in faster ﬂowing waters (yevsin 1977; pakkasmaa & piironen 2001a). in this study, the morphology of juvenile s. salar and s. trutta was compared from irish rivers of contrasting hydraulic environment – a high-gradient tributary (the river duiske) and a low-gradient tribu- tary (the owenass river) from the river barrow catchment in south-east ireland and a high-gradient river from the burrishoole catchment in the west of ireland. salmonids were taken from two neighbouring sites in the burrishoole, as s. salar were abundant in one site and s. trutta abundant in the other. both species were however sympatric throughout the bur- rishoole catchment. our aims were to determine ﬁrstly, whether changes in hydraulic conditions between two contrasting ﬂuvial environments inﬂuenced the mor- phology of juvenile s. salar and s. trutta and secondly, whether the two sympatric species exhibited a similar morphological response to these hydraulic changes. materials and methods catchment description the river barrow rises in the slieve bloom moun- tains in the east of ireland (fig. 1). both barrow tributaries examined in this study (the rivers owenass and duiske) are chemically well buffered. the catch- ment is underlain by sedimentary geology, limestone at lower altitudes and shales, sandstone and siltstones at upper altitudes. the upper reaches of the owenass drain deep, poorly drained mineral soils. the duiske, which lies further downstream on the barrow catch- ment, drains predominantly deep well-drained mineral soils. the gradients of both rivers differ markedly. the owenass falls steeply during its second-order stretch (mean = 2.03%) to yield lower gradients during its third-order (mean = 0.70%) and fourth-order stretches (mean = 0.28%). in contrast, the duiske retains a higher gradient throughout its length, both during its second-order third-order stretches (mean = 1.65%). fish were sampled from a fourth-order section of the owenass and a third-order section of the duiske. the average rainfall for the barrow catchment from the period from 1961 to 2000 was 849 mm year)1 (steele-dunne et al. 2008), thus making it one of ireland’s driest catchments. (mean = 3.75%) and site 1 = 1.60% & sample the burrishoole catchment is located in the west of ireland (fig. 1). its poorly buffered geology is dom- inated by mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks, consisting mainly of schists and quartzites, with sandstone and mudrock becoming more prevalent towards the lower coastal region of the catchment. the catchment drains predominantly blanket peat with some areas of shallow, lithosolic-podzolic type soils with peaty topsoil. the gradient of both burrishoole sampling sites, similar to the entire catchment, was high (sample site 2 = 2.10%). the catchment has an average precipita- tion rate of 1370.3 mm year)1 (environmental pro- tection agency (epa) 2007), which falls almost entirely as frequent winter and summer rain events, making it one of the ireland’s wettest catchments. the barrow and burrishoole catchments thus receive near opposite extremes of rainfall in ireland (fig. 2). as a result of the variation in geology, soil type, topogra- phy and annual precipitation, the hydrology of both catchments also differs markedly. the much higher monthly precipitation, coupled with the less permeable geology and the low porosity of the blanket peat soil the burrishoole catchment, yields more type of frequent rainfall-driven high discharges than the barrow catchment, throughout the year (fig. 2). sampling sympatric young-of-year (0+) s. salar and s. trutta parr were collected, using electro-ﬁshing, from the owenass river and the river duiske within the river barrow catchment and from two neighbouring sites on the burrishoole river system (s. salar from sample site 1 and s. trutta from sample site 2). all the rivers in the study, both within and between catchments, were physically similar, despite changes in geograph- ical location and gradient. the velocity of the stretches sampled for all rivers ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 ms)1, while depth ranged from 0.20 to 0.30 m. channel width for the stretches sampled ranged from 1.4 to 2.3 m. the benthic substrate in the burrishoole was 421 drinan et al. fig. 1. map of ireland showing the location of the burrishoole and barrow catchments. the locations of the sampling sites on both catchments are also indicated on each map. 300 200 100 ) m m ( l l a f n i a r 0 jul-01 burrishoole catchment barrow catchment feb-02 sep-02 apr-03 nov-03 jun-04 jan-05 aug-05 mar-06 oct-06 may-07 dec-07 fig. 2. total monthly precipitation (mm) for the period from july 2001 to november 2007 for the burrishoole and barrow catchments. dominated by pebbles and cobbles with some sand and gravel and occasional boulders, whereas the substrate of the barrow rivers was dominated by pebbles, sand and gravel with only occasional cobbles. the riparian vegetation of the burrishoole was dominated by grasses and rushes and occasional woody shrubs, whereas that of the barrow was dominated more by woody shrubs and occasional trees. s. salar and s. trutta were the dominant ﬁsh species in both catchments. eel (anguilla anguilla l.) and stickleback 422 morphological variability of atlantic salmon s. salar and brown_trout s. trutta (gasterosteus aculeatus l.) were present in both catchments, while minnow (phoxinus phoxinus l.) and river lamprey (lampetra ﬂuviatilis l.) were also present in the two barrow tributaries. the semi-quantitative electro-ﬁshing method used was similar to that employed by crozier & kennedy (1994) and involved two people ﬁshing continuously in an upstream direction for a standard 5 min using a single anode portable electro-ﬁshing apparatus. fish were sampled over a 250–300 m stretch in all rivers, which encompassed all habitat types: rifﬂe, glide and the occasional pool. care was taken not to oversample either species from any one site to avoid collecting large numbers of closely related parr. captured ﬁsh were killed by an overdose of clove oil and preserved by freezing. fish were slowly thawed in the laboratory prior to morphometric analysis. morphological analysis all ﬁsh (145 individuals of s. salar and 87 individuals of s. trutta) were photographed on an illuminated stand. a kaiser evision executive: hf copylizer was used for illumination, with the same settings being used for each ﬁsh. a nikon coolpix 950 digital camera was used to photograph the ﬁsh. all image analysis was performed using the package imagej v. 1.6.0. the morphometric variables used in each analysis consisted of euclidean distances between biologically deﬁned landmarks, with these distances making up a truss network (strauss & bookstein 1982). twenty-four morphometric variables were selected for analysis, following simonovic´ et al. (2007), with slight modiﬁcation (fig. 3). to ensure only 0+ ﬁsh were used in the analyses, length frequency histograms were constructed for both species and any ﬁsh likely to be 1+ years or older were excluded from the analysis. all ﬁsh were dissected and sexed to test for sexual dimorphism. to estimate the accuracy of the image analysis, all morphological variables from 10 individual ﬁsh were measured ﬁve times. the sd over the ﬁve replicates of every morphometric variable was calculated for each of the 10 ﬁsh. the variability in each trait was always <0.5 mm. only undamaged ﬁsh were included in the analyses. statistical analyses one-way analyses of variance (anova) were per- formed to test for signiﬁcant differences in the mean fork length and selected morphological variables of s. salar and s. trutta parr between rivers. all mor- phological variables for all groups conformed to the normal distribution criterion (kolmogorov–smirnov & shapiro–wilk normality tests, p > 0.05). prior to the anova, a levene’s test was used to test for homoge- neity of variance. differences between individual rivers were tested by post hoc tukey’s hsd analysis. as each morphometric variable contains informa- tion on overall size as well as shape, all raw data were ﬁrst size-adjusted to exclude the size effect on variability as much as possible. statistical comparisons among groups using ratios (or other simple arithmetic size adjustment approaches) can be misleading and can result in reduced statistical power (atchley et al. 6 3 4 7 2 24 5 8 19 20 21 9 17 18 1 10 15 16 22 11 14 12 23

12, distance between the dorsal and ventral origins of the caudal ﬁn base; 13, distance between the end of the anal ﬁn base to the ventral origin of the caudal ﬁn base; 14, distance between the origin of the adipose ﬁn base to the end of the anal ﬁn base; 15, distance between the origin of the adipose ﬁn base to the origin of the anal ﬁn base; 16, distance between the end of the dorsal ﬁn base to the origin of the anal ﬁn base; 17, distance between the origin of the pelvic ﬁn base to the end of the dorsal ﬁn base; 18, distance between the origin of the pelvic ﬁn base to the origin of the dorsal ﬁn base; 19, distance between the origin of the dorsal ﬁn base to the origin of the pectoral ﬁn base; 20, pectoral ﬁn length; 21, distance between the anterior of isthmus base to the origin of

often-arbitrary choice of a body size variable, resulting in residual variation in trusses still containing size information (bookstein et al. 1985). in this study, size adjustment was carried out by dividing each measurement by the geometric mean of all the variables for that specimen (mosimann 1970; mosi- mann & malley 1979; jungers et al. 1995). this size adjustment method effectively equalises the volumes of all specimens, creating scale-free shape variable (falsetti et al. 1993), but still maintaining the original shape (jungers et al. 1995). discriminant function analysis (dfa), employing forward stepwise selection of morphometric variables, was then applied to the size-adjusted variables to test for group membership and to identify variation between populations for the three rivers for both species. the quality of the discriminant functions was assessed with cross-validated (jackknife) classiﬁca- tion. dfa was used to determine the set of variables that best discriminated between rivers for both species. the relative importance of morphometric variables in discriminating between rivers was assessed using the f-to-remove statistic (f-to-enter, 3.84; f-to-remove, 2.71). the dfa was performed on 21 size-adjusted variables as morphometric variables 1 and 2 (fork length and head length) were excluded from the analysis as these variables reﬂect size rather than shape. morphometric variable 24 was also excluded from analysis as it was highly variable amongst individuals owing to open gape mouths. the remain- ing morphometric data set consisted of size-adjusted raw residuals as all of the characters conformed to the normal distribution criterion (kolmogorov–smirnov & shapiro–wilk normality tests, p > 0.05). principal component analysis (pca) was then applied to the same morphological variables as the identiﬁed by the dfa to deﬁne the overall morpho- logical variation between populations for both species. the number of components extracted for each pca for both species was determined by the kaiser criterion (kaiser 1960) and a graphic scree test (cattell 1966). the loadings of the size-adjusted morphometric vari- ables from the principal components (pc) were used to compare the ﬁsh from different rivers for both species. the threshold for important loadings on each pc was ±0.4 (stevens 1992). homogeneity of pcs was tested univariately for statistical signiﬁcance using anova and a tukey’s hsd post hoc test for unequal sample sizes. prior to the anova, a levene’s test was used to test for homogeneity of variance. to determine whether sexual dimorphism occurred between indi- viduals of the same species, a multivariate analysis of variance (manova) was also carried out on the 424 loadings of the 21 size-adjusted morphometric vari- ables of the ﬁrst and second pcs of a pca carried out for each species based on sex. there was no signiﬁcant difference in morphology between males and females for s. salar parr (wilks’ k [2,142] = 0.996, p > 0.05) or s. trutta parr (wilks’ k [2, 69] = 0.984, p > 0.05). statistical analyses were carried out using the package pasw statistics (spss) v. 17.0. results the mean fork length of s. salar parr differed signif- icantly between the three rivers (f [2, 142] = 24.57, p < 0.001). s. salar parr from the owenass were signiﬁcantly larger than those from the duiske and burrishoole rivers (table 1). there was also a signif- icant difference in mean fork length for s. trutta parr from the three rivers [f (2, 84) = 10.91, p < 0.001]. duiske parr were signiﬁcantly larger than those from the owenass and the burrishoole rivers. for both species, burrishoole ﬁsh were smaller than either of the two barrow rivers. salmo_salar parr the discriminant analysis used 10 of the 21 morpho- logical variables, and s. salar parr from the three rivers were clearly separated from each other by two different functions (table 2; fig. 4). the ﬁrst discri- minant function (df1) explained 86.6% of the vari- ation and distinguished the burrishoole s. salar parr from both the barrow rivers. the second discriminant function (df2) explained the remainder (13.4%), which separated the duiske s. salar parr from the rivers. the difference between rivers was other signiﬁcant (wilk’s k, d.f. = 20; p < 0.001). the overall correct cross-validated classiﬁcation of indi- viduals into their original populations was 81.4%. df1 represented pectoral ﬁn length, body depth (anterior) and eye diameter (table 2). burrishoole s. salar parr had longer pectoral ﬁns and larger eyes table 1. mean ± 1 se fork length and

parr had longer and deeper posterior regions, shorter dorsal ﬁns, anterior regions and head lengths. the pca of the 10 morphometric variables selected from the dfa of the s. salar parr from the three rivers showed that there was variation in ﬁsh shape from both the barrow rivers, but that the majority of the ﬁsh from the burrishoole were morphologically distinct (fig. 5). pc axis 1 (explaining 28.7% of the variance) repre- sented head length, eye diameter, body depth, body length (anterior) and pectoral ﬁn length (table 3). the mean pc axis 1 scores differed signiﬁcantly between ﬁsh from the three rivers [f pc 1 (2, 142) = 27.35, p < 0.001]. burrishoole s. salar parr differed signiﬁ- cantly from parr from both the barrow rivers; however, no signiﬁcant differences were found between either of the barrow rivers (post hoc tukey’s hsd tests: p < 0.05). burrishoole s. salar parr tended to score negatively on pc axis 1, indicating longer heads, larger eyes, larger pectoral ﬁns,

between ﬁsh from the three rivers [f pc 2 (2, 142) = 20.43, p < 0.001]. owenass s. salar parr differed signiﬁcantly from parr from both the burrishoole and the duiske. owenass s. salar parr tended to have negative scores on pc axis 2, indicating longer and deeper anterior regions as well as shorter anal ﬁns (fig. 5). pc axis 3 (explaining 11.7% of the variance) represented posterior body length (table 3). the mean pc axis 3 scores differed signiﬁcantly [f pc 3 (2, 142) = 6.24, p < 0.01] between s. salar parr from the three rivers. duiske s. salar parr differed signiﬁcantly from parr from both the burrishoole and owenass (post hoc tukey’s hsd tests: p < 0.05). duiske s. salar parr tended have to negative scores on pc axis 3, indicating shorter posterior and longer caudal peduncle regions (fig. 5). pc axis 4 (explaining 10.9% of the variance) represented pectoral ﬁn and dorsal ﬁn length (table 3). the mean pc axis 4 scores differed signiﬁcantly [f pc 4 (2, 142) = 8.72, p < 0.001] between parr from the three rivers. similar to pc axis 1, burrishoole s. salar parr differed signiﬁcantly from parr from both the barrow rivers; however, no signiﬁcant differences were found between either of the barrow rivers (post hoc tukey’s hsd tests: p < 0.05). burrishoole s. salar parr tended to have positive scores on pc axis 4, indicating longer pectoral and dorsal ﬁns (fig. 5). salmo_trutta parr as for the s. salar parr, the discriminant analysis used 10 of the 21 morphological variables, and s. trutta parr 426 from the three rivers were clearly separated from each other by two different functions (table 4; fig. 6). the ﬁrst discriminant function (df1) explained 73.4% of the variation; it distinguished the burrishoole and duiske s. trutta parr from the owenass. the second discriminant function (df2) explained the remainder (26.6%), which separated the duiske s. trutta parr from the other rivers. the difference between rivers was signiﬁcant (wilk’s k, d.f. = 20; p < 0.001). the overall correct cross-validated classiﬁcation of indi- viduals into their original populations was 86.2%. df1 represented pectoral ﬁn length and body length (anterior) and depth (posterior) (table 4). both bur- rishoole and duiske s. trutta parr had longer pectoral ﬁns and anterior regions as well as deeper posterior regions. df2 represented body depth, head length, anal ﬁn length and body length (posterior). this function differentiated duiske s. trutta parr from both the owenass and burrishoole rivers. duiske s. trutta parr had deeper and longer posterior regions, longer anal ﬁns as well as shorter heads and shallower anterior regions. as for s. salar parr, the pca of the 10 morpho- metric variables selected from the dfa of the s. trutta parr revealed that the burrishoole parr were morpho- logically distinct from both the river barrow tribu- taries (fig. 7). it also revealed that s. trutta parr morphological variation between the two river bar- row tributaries was greater than that of s. salar parr for the same catchment. pc axis 1 (explaining 25.8% of the variance) represented posterior body depth and body length (table 5). the mean pc axis 1 scores differed signiﬁcantly (f pc 1 [2, 84] = 6.39, p < 0.01) between s. trutta parr from the different rivers (fig. 7). duiske parr differed signiﬁcantly from parr from owenass; however, neither was

scores on this axis. from the different to demonstrate the relative parallel morphological change shown by both species from the burrishoole catchment, several traits (head length, eye diameter, pectoral ﬁn length and body depth), identiﬁed from the dfa as being the most discriminatory, were compared between rivers for both species (fig. 8). both s. salar and s. trutta parr from the burrishoole catchment exhibited similar relative increases in head length, eye diameter and pectoral ﬁn length and relative decreases in body depth compared to conspeciﬁcs from the 428 barrow catchment (fig. 8). s. trutta parr, however, did not exhibit as strong a trend as the s. salar parr. discussion the morphologies of in this study, juvenile wild s. salar and s. trutta were compared between and within catchments of contrasting rainfall patterns. parr of both species from the western, higher rainfall, catchment tended to have relatively longer heads, shallower bodies, larger eyes and larger pectoral ﬁns than those from the eastern, lower rainfall, catchment. similarly, s. salar parr and, to a lesser degree, s. trutta parr from the higher-gradient river duiske within the barrow catchment had generally a more fusiform shape and longer pectoral ﬁns and larger eyes than conspeciﬁcs from the lower-gradient owenass river. the relative importance of morphological variables such as pectoral ﬁn length, body depth and length in distinguishing between groups suggests that hydraulic forces, determined by rainfall patterns and gradient, were the major determinant of morphological variation. such morphological variables have often been associated with changing hydraulic conditions morphological variability of atlantic salmon s. salar and brown_trout s. trutta (riddell et al. 1981; beacham 1985; taylor & mcp- hail 1985), with most studies revealing a more streamlined and larger body with increased hydraulic stress. the morphological differences demonstrated in this study will have a strong inﬂuence on the ﬁshes’ swimming and foraging ability. the different hydraulic environments of the two catchments appeared therefore to be a powerful selection pressure on the ecology of salmonids in ireland. the variability in body morphol- ogy of juvenile salmonids is a striking feature of this group of ﬁshes, and there have been many studies looking at morphological change of a single species within and between habitats (riddell et al. 1981; lavin & mcphail 1986; hindar & jonsson 1993; obedzinski & letcher 2004). few studies, however, have docu- mented the parallel morphological change of multiple ﬁsh species to the same environmental drivers. similar differences of body form and ﬁn size in relation to varying ﬂow conditions have been previ- ously reported for s. salar (riddell & leggett 1981; pakkasmaa & piironen 2001b) and also for s. trutta (yevsin 1977; pakkasmaa & piironen 2001a). for example, riddell & leggett (1981) compared juvenile s. salar from two tributaries of the miramichi river, the rocky brook (higher average ﬂow velocity) and the sabbies river (lower average ﬂow velocity), and found that rocky brook parr had signiﬁcantly larger heads and ﬁn lengths and their maximum body depth was signiﬁcantly lower than that of parr from the sabbies river. similarly, pakkasmaa & piironen (2001b) who studied the effect of water velocity on the body shape of juvenile s. salar and s. trutta found that s. trutta in fast ﬂow became slightly streamlined; however, s. salar in the fast ﬂow became more robust. ojanguren & bran˜a (2003) also demonstrated for s. trutta parr that individuals with longer paired ﬁns and postanal regions tended to endure the current for a longer time period. our catchment environmental data are conﬁned to measurements of catchment precipitation, which show very strong changes in rainfall patterns across the two catchments in the west and east of the country. other catchment-wide differences are likely to include: ﬂow and substrate characteristics, temperature regime, water clarity and the nature of the food supply, all of which would vary strongly in response to rainfall. the increased seasonal and annual precipitation, coupled with the igneous geology and the low porosity of the blanket peat soil type of the burrishoole catchment, yields more frequent spate events throughout the year, in comparison with the mineral soil-dominated barrow catchment, which is one of the driest catchments in ireland (steele-dunne et al. 2008). consequently, this would result in the ﬁsh experiencing higher hydraulic stress for longer periods throughout the year and particularly during summer and autumn when salmo- nid foraging is greatest. the s. salar and s. trutta parr from the burrishoole had larger eyes than those in the barrow systems. variation in eye size can result from differences in water transparency (pakkasmaa et al. 1998) and from size difference of available prey (baumgartner et al. 1988). northcote et al. (1978) have shown that an increase in eye size results in a larger retinal image, thereby increasing visual acuity. although not mea- sured in this study, the peat soil-dominated burrisho- ole catchment is likely to have increased dissolved organic carbon, colour and reduced nutrient concen- trations in comparison with the mineral soil-dominated barrow catchment. larger eyes may thus arise as a response to increased water colour or to reduced prey availability, both of which will make locating and ingesting prey more difﬁcult. intraspeciﬁc differences in head morphology and variation in mouth gape in ﬁshes are often related to differences in diet (wootton 1998). keeley et al. (2005) showed that piscivorous rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum) had signiﬁcantly longer mouths and heads than similar- sized individuals from nonpiscivorous lake popula- tions. adams et al. (2003) also demonstrated that arctic charr salvelinus_alpinus l. fed on chironomids for 24 weeks had bigger mouths, longer heads and bigger eyes than ﬁsh fed on mysis relicta loven. the pectoral ﬁns of burrishoole s. salar and s. trutta parr were signiﬁcantly larger than their counterparts within the barrow catchment. similarly, pectoral ﬁns of both species were larger in the higher- gradient duiske tributary than in the lower-gradient owenass tributary, within the barrow catchment. pectoral ﬁns are important for station holding in s. salar, acting as hydrofoils generating a downward force (arnold et al. 1991). large pectoral ﬁns have also been shown to aid sharp-burst swimming and manoeuvrability in ﬁsh (drucker & lauder 2002). thus, increased size of pectoral ﬁns not only allows for maintaining station at higher ﬂow velocities but also provides a greater capacity for correction during periods of high ﬂow velocities or turbulent ﬂow (e.g. spate conditions). in river systems with high average ﬂow velocities and more frequent spate events, such as those in the burrishoole catchment, possessing large pectoral ﬁns may prove advantageous in preventing newly emerged s. salar and s. trutta fry from down- stream displacement. these ﬁn shape adaptations have major implications for salmonid feeding, in addition to station holding. s. salar parr are usually predominantly ‘sit-and-wait’ predators (kalleberg 1958) that maintain station on the substrate from which they use burst swimming into the current to intercept invertebrate drift prey. although swimming in high velocity ﬂows is more costly than 429 drinan et al. swimming in low velocity ﬂows (beamish 1980), there is the potential for better food returns in higher velocity ﬂows because the delivery of drifting prey is higher (grant & noakes 1987). if the drift current velocity increases beyond some critical point, then the prey items will travel at a velocity greater than can be accommodated by the reactivity of the ﬁsh (metcalfe et al. 1997). therefore, beyond this critical point an increase in water velocity will be disadvantageous. however, larger pectoral ﬁns allow for greater manoeuvrability and correction, which consequently provides the ﬁsh with an opportunity to move further to catch food during high velocity ﬂows. our ﬁndings have demonstrated morphological var- iation in ﬁsh body shape between two catchments of contrasting hydrology, this variation being most likely driven by environmental forces. the inﬂuence of ﬂow regime has been demonstrated to have a powerful and consistent inﬂuence on body shape of ﬁshes, with individuals from hydraulically stressful environments typically having more fusiform shapes (langerhans 2008). a central question in the study of such pheno- typic variation concerns the relative importance of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity. both have been shown to operate in controlling body morphology of salmonids (taylor & mcphail 1985; hindar & jonsson 1993; pakkasmaa & piironen 2001a; langer- hans 2008). in a study of s. salar and s. trutta reared under different ﬂow regimes, pakkasmaa & piironen (2001b) found that both species exhibited phenotypic plasticity in body shape in response to changing ﬂow conditions. in fact, the body shape changes of s. trutta (although not those of s. salar) in response to water velocity in this latter study were very similar to those reported here. clearly, phenotypic plasticity may plau- sibly explain the morphological changes in s. salar and s. trutta between study catchments, as much as the more commonly documented genetic changes. however, a ‘common garden’ experiment, similar to those con- ducted by mcginnity et al. (2003), would be needed to elucidate the exact driver of such morphological variation and whether or not it had a genetic component. the hydraulic environment of lotic salmonids plays a major role in determining body shape, which in turn governs multiple aspects of their ecology. further, the relative parallel morphological shift exhibited by the sympatric s. salar and s. trutta suggests that both species are responding in similar ways to changes in the hydraulic environment. climate-driven changes in the hydraulic environment are likely to challenge salmonid popula- tions in the future (steele-dunne et al. 2008; graham & harrod 2009). the stability of river ﬁsh communities may be threatened by such changes should adaptive responses differ between component species. stream- dwelling s. salar and s. trutta parr have been shown to the results of this experiment suggest that 430 occupy different feeding and habitat niches in sympatry, with s. salar occupying faster and shallower water than s. trutta, which dominate more in deeper pools and glides (armstrong et al. 2003). such niche separation facilitates the coexistence of the two species. our ﬁndings demonstrate that s. salar and s. trutta are maintaining this niche separation (as judged from body morphology) across streams of widely diverging hydraulic regimes, indicating that long-term change in hydraulic environment may not necessarily result in the displacement of one species by the other. should the observed changes in morphology between systems be genetically based, rather than a plastic phenotypic response, our ﬁndings have serious conservation impli- cations. restocking of salmonids is widely practised to compensate for reduced production or following local population crashes (aprahamian et al. 2003). our ﬁndings emphasise the considerable local adaptations by salmonids to different ﬂuvial environments, such that nonlocally adapted introduced individuals may not thrive in their new environment. similarly, introgres- sion with escapees from ﬁsh farms, known to reduce the ﬁtness of wild salmonid populations (mcginnity et al. 2003), may also lead to morphologically suboptimal hybrids. acknowledgements for many thanks to two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on the manuscript. we are grateful the assistance provided by inland fisheries ireland and the marine
