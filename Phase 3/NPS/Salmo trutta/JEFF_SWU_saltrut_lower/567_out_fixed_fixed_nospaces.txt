førland & hanssen-bauer 2001). although winters may be milder, most of the winter precipitation will probably still fall as snow in the high mountain areas of western norway, as observed on the hardangervidda mountain plateau during the mild winters in the last decades (borgstrøm 2001). in this area, lakes are inhabited by allopatric brown_trout salmo_trutta l., attractive to ﬁshermen because of their large size and good quality (sømme 1941; anon 1974; borgstrøm 2001). despite the sub-arctic condi- tions, annual growth rates of brown_trout in these lakes are relatively high because of low annual recruitment and low population densities (sømme 1941), but growth rates seem to be negatively correlated to accumulated snow depth and date of ice-break (bor- gstrøm 2001). young-of-the-year (yoy) brown_trout in these western high mountain areas may be extremely small in august, even after summers with early ice break-up (borgstrøm et al. 1993). in lotic environments, the small parr suffer considerable stress during the cold season because of their low energy content at the onset of winter, and they have higher energy losses than larger ﬁsh during the winter (berg & bremset 1998). thus, it is likely that the smallest yoy have little or doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00112.x 375 borgstrøm & museth no likelihood of surviving the winter, as demonstrated in other ﬁsh species in temperate areas (kempe 1962; oliver et al. 1979; henderson et al. 1988; post & evans 1989; shuter & post 1990; thompson et al. 1991; hurst & conover 1998). accordingly, annual recruitment to brown_trout populations in the western high mountain areas is expected to show large ﬂuctuations due to changes in snow conditions and summer temperatures. material and methods study area in the central part of the study was carried out in lake krokavatn, 1236 m a.s.l., situated in ullensvang crown land, in the western part of the 8000 km2 hardangervidda moun- tain plateau (fig. 1). this mountain area, hardangervidda national park covers 3422 km2. most lakes on hardangervidda are situated between 1100 and 1400 m a.s.l. the accumulated snow cover, as measured in april by hydroelectric companies, is generally high in the western part, but decreases towards the eastern part of hardangervidda (borgstrøm 2001). at jukladalen, about 5 km south- west of the study site, accumulated snow depths greater than 3 m in april were recorded in only 3 years during the period 1940–1988, but in 9 years during the period 1989–2002. during the winter 1995/ 1996, however, there was very little precipitation (fig. 2), combined with low air temperatures, resulting in one of the lowest accumulated snow depths (105 cm) recorded for the whole period 1940–2002, and total freezing of small streams. the date of ice break-up of lakes in the area is highly correlated with the accumulated snow depth in april (borgstrøm 2001). depending on the snow conditions, the ice- cover on krokavatn may last to the beginning of august (fig. 3), and the nursery stream may not open until far into july. in such years, air temperature cannot be used as a predictor of water temperature before the end of july. the august there are no long-term records of water temper- atures in the studied lake and the outlet stream. however, temperature in the outlet of krokavatn in 1998 (fig. 4) was highly correlated with the air temperature at tyssevatn (1333 m a.s.l., 11 km to the west of krokavatn) (pearson correlation 0.78, p < 0.001). air temperatures at tyssevatn are available only since 1996. however, as the august air temperatures at tyssevatn and at finse (dnmis station 25840, in the northern part of hardangervid- da, 1224 m a.s.l.) are strongly correlated (pearson correlation 0.99, p < 0.001), the temperatures at finse which are available since 1970, were used in the analysis. cambrosilurian bedrock is common in the catch- ment area of the studied lakes, and no damage to the aquatic fauna because of acidiﬁcation has been recorded (sft 2001). the electrolytic conductivity fig. 1. map of the study area on the hardangervidda mountain plateau, southern norway. 376 climate and brown_trout recruitment (a) h t p e d w o n s l i r p a 200 150 100 50 0 -50 -100 -150 e g a r e v a m o r f ) m c ( n o i t a v e d i 1970 1975 1980 1990 1995 2000 1985 year (b) 1970 1975 1980 1990 1995 2000 1985 year (c) e g a r e v a m o r f ) c ° ( n o i t i a v e d e r u t a r e p m e t r i a t s u g u a  4 2 0 -2 -4 -6 d e r u t p a c r e b m u n 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 year-class fig. 2.

(appelberg 1995) with ﬁshing (1987–1998), and by electroﬁshing (1988– 2003) in the outlet as well as in the lake. by gillnetting, both pelagic and littoral nets with mesh sizes from 16 to 52 mm (knot to knot), and nordic gillnets panels (1.5 · 2.5 m) of mesh sizes from 5 to 55 mm were used. the beach seine had a mesh size of 3–5 mm in the cod end. electroﬁshing by a pulsed dc back packer (produced by engineer s. paulsen, trond- heim) as described by borgstrøm & skaala (1993) was the only sampling method used in the stream. the material was analysed with regard to length and year-class distribution. total ﬁsh length was mea- sured in mm. otoliths were used for ageing the ﬁsh (power 1978; borgstrøm 2001). gonadal develop- ment was scored according to sømme (1941). in july 2002 and 2003, a gillnet ﬂeet consisting of the following mesh sizes: 16, 19.5, 22.5, 26, 29, 35, 45 and 52 mm (bar mesh), was used for sampling brown_trout in the lakes kollsvatn, litlosvatn, midtre grøndalsvatn, kvennsjøen, øvre bjørnavatn and nedre bjørnavatn (fig. 1), to be used in year- class analyses. data analysis the year-class distribution, obtained by summing numbers in each year-class over all sampling years, was used to analyse the appearance of strong year- classes (model i) and the occurrence of recruitment failure (model ii) separately. the criterion of a strong year-class was having more than twice as many as in the two subsequent and preceding year-classes, whereas the criterion of a missing year-class (recruit- ment failure) was no observations during the study period (1987–2003). in order to test any effect of temperature during the summer and snow depth during the winter, expressed by the mean air temperature during august and the april snow two binary logistic regression models were depth, carried out in minitab (release 13.0). the explan- atory variables were considered as quantitative predictors. the square value of annual deviation from average april snow depth (m) was used in order the following extremes: cold winters with thin snow cover (with danger of complete freezing of nursery streams) and mild winters with much accumulated snow in spring (late ice break and short growing season). with reference to the information criterion (aic) (akaike 1973), the tempera- two-factor interaction ture · [deviation (m) snow depth]2 was eliminated from both models. model i (g2) ¼ 22.59 with had d.f. (p ¼ 0.832), whereas model ii had a deviance (g2) ¼ 23.32 with 30 d.f. (p ¼ 0.802). from average april term ‘august to intercept deviance 30 a 378 results year-class variation in krokavatn, year-class strengths during the last 33 years have varied considerably, as recorded by gillnetting, angling and electroﬁshing (fig. 2). only six strong year-classes (1971, 1975, 1978, 1985, 1997 and 2002) have appeared during the whole period 1970–2002 (fig. 2). since 1978, three strong year- classes have been recorded (i.e., year-class 1985, 1997 and 2002), whereas a total of 10 year-classes have been missing since 1985. however, no complete recruitment failure occurred in the 15 years prior to 1985 (fig. 2). recruitment failure is also indicated by the length distribution in the beach seine catches from the lake, with a gradual change from a two-modal distribution during the years 1988–1991 to an one-modal distri- bution during 1994–1996 (fig. 5). this shift is mainly because of the growth in length of individuals in the year-class 1985, and no new year-classes recruited to the population between 1988 and 1997 (fig. 2). in 1998, a two-modal size-distribution reappeared, due to the strong 1997 year-class (fig. 5). appearance of individuals from the 1987 1988

also captured in shallow, stony areas in the lake. a year later, on 14 september 1998, the catch in the stream consisted of a few yoy having total lengths in the range 22–23 mm (22.5 ± 0.6 mm), in addition to individuals of year-class 1997 (fig. 6). in august 1999, individuals of year-class 1997 were the only ones captured, suggesting that the 1998 year- class had been wiped out since the

(table 3). both in 2002 and 2003 the year-classes 1996 and older were weak in all the lakes (table 3). discussion the high relative abundance of six year-classes (1971, 1975, 1978, 1985, 1997 and 2002) was highly correlated with the temperature during the main open water and growth season (august). in contrast, the absence of other year-classes was highly correlated 380 with accumulated spring snow during the same period (1970–2002). our results support the expectation that both very little or much snow, and/or low temperatures during the open water season, negatively affect recruitment to brown_trout populations in high moun- tain areas. the north atlantic oscillation (nao) refers to swings in the atmospheric sea level pressure differ- ences between the arctic and the subtropical atlantic ocean (hurrell et al. 2001). the inﬂuence of the nao on surface temperature and precipitation is greatest from december to march, and when low sea level pressures predominate in northern atlantic during this period (high winter nao index), the winters in north- western europe become mild, with much precipitation and westerly winds (hurrell 1995; hurrell et al. 2003). these conditions result in deep accumulated snow covers in the hardangervidda mountain area, late ice- breaks and short growing seasons for ﬁsh (borgstrøm 2001). cold winters (low winter nao index) with little snow cover may lead to death of eggs, parr and over-wintering spawners due to total freezing of the streams, as occurs in arctic streams (power 1997). it is striking that reports concerning recruitment failure in the western part of hardangervidda from earlier periods, i.e., around 1925 (sunde 1937), coincide with a high winter nao index during the period 1920–1930 (hurrell 1995) and low summer temper- atures in western norway (nordli et al. 2002). in addition to the direct physiological effect on growth, low temperatures may inﬂuence the availability and quality of food organisms for the ﬁsh (wankowski & thorpe 1979; elliott & hurley 2000). although ﬁsh lose fat and proteins during the winter, making especially the fry of salmonids more vulnerable to adverse abiotic factors (berg & bremset 1998), it is difﬁcult to demonstrate size-dependent mortality in ﬁeld studies (post & evans 1989). in our study, however, the absence of whole year-classes may be related to the small size of yoy at the onset of the winter. catchability of yoy brown_trout parr in low conductivity waters is extremely low, but increases with ﬁsh size (borgstrøm & skaala 1993). the fact that yoy in the length range 22–23 mm were captured in september 1998, but not the year after or later, strongly indicate that they did not survive the ﬁrst winter, probably because of their small size and low energy content at the onset of winter, and energy loss during the winter as observed in other species (paloheimo & dickie 1966; post & evans 1989; thompson et al. 1991; berg & bremset 1998). therefore, an increased duration of winter conditions due to much accumulated snow and late ice break-up, such as observed in the study area during the last decades (borgstrøm 2001), may increase the stress on yoy and adversely affect survival and recruitment. temperatures may also offset the whole summer period (museth 2002). the high number of individuals in year-class 1997 in lake krokavatn, as well as in other lakes in the same area in 2002 and 2003, may be related to their size as yoy at the onset of their ﬁrst winter, and the absence or low abundance of older parr in the streams. the august air temperature in this area in 1997 was more than 4 °c above the normal temperature, giving water temperatures up to 16 °c for some days in the lake litlosvatn (1172 m a.s.l.), and with 40 days >10 °c for in august 1998, the air temperature was below normal, resulting in temperatures >10 °c for only 10 days in the lake litlosvatn, and for 7 days in the outlet of krokavatn as a total for the whole summer. high air temperatures were also recorded in august 2002 and 2003, and accordingly, it is reasonable to connect the larger size of yoy in year-classes 1997, 2002 and 2003 to high and favourable temperatures. the high august the negative effects of much accumulated snow and late ice breaks. although the estimated lower temperature limits for feeding and growth in brown_trout are slightly above 0 °c (koskela et al. 1997), the growth rate declines temperatures below 7–8 °c (elliott considerably at 1975; elliott et al. 1995). maximum water tempera- tures around 8–10 °c for a period of only a month, as observed during the summer of 1998, may be inadequate to give yoy a size sufﬁcient to survive the winter. at temperatures in the range 3–5 °c, which may be the july water temperature in this area in years with much accumulated snow, alevins of brown_trout may need 2–3 months from hatching to 50% feeding (jensen et al. 1989). hence, the snow conditions as determined by the winter nao, and the length of the period with favourable summer temperatures will strongly inﬂuence winter survival of yoy in these high mountain areas. in lowland streams, winter water temperatures and emergence of sea_trout correlate signiﬁcantly with the winter nao index (elliott et al. 2000). thus, when the nao index is high, the growing season of the sea_trout fry is longer. a high winter nao index might therefore have an opposite correlation with growth and survival of ﬁsh in lowland and high mountain habitats. climate and brown_trout recruitment theoretically, temperatures or in the outlet of the disappearance of some year- classes might have been caused by unsuccessful gonadal development in potential spawners, due to low summer low food supplies. however, this hypothesis is contradicted by the capture of large females with residual eggs, indicating spawning the year before capture (sømme 1941), as well as developed eggs at capture during the whole period 1987–1998. washout of redds due to spates may be a major cause of mortality of salmonid eggs and alevins (crisp 2000). lake krokavatn, this is less likely because of a small catchment area, and a snow covered stream until july in years with much snow, i.e., until after the hatching of eggs. the strong 1997 cohort actually appeared despite much accumulated snow that year. however, little snow and low temperatures during the winter may lead to recruitment failure, as small nursery streams may freeze completely in high mountain areas under such conditions. this is the rule in the arctic, where streams regularly freeze solid (power 1997). the absence of the year-classes 1994, 1995 and 1996, in the outlet of krokavatn and other smaller streams in 1997 and later (museth 2002) is most probably a result of total freezing as observed in this area during the winter 1995/1996, because of the low temperatures and extremely thin snow cover during most of the winter period. in such winters, both parr and deposited eggs probably die due to the solid freezing of smaller streams, or freezing of substantial parts of larger streams. the strength of (mortensen 1977), in small sea_trout streams in western sweden, bohlin (1977, 1978) demonstrated that a homogen- ous bottom substratum affected the intraspeciﬁc competition and year-class abundance of parr, giving regular oscillations in year-class strength. similarly, in lake skavatn, a strong year-class appeared every third year, probably as a result of habitat competition and intercohort interactions in the shallow parts of the littoral zone (borgstrøm et al. 1993). as growth rate in brown_trout fry may be inversely density dependent the 1997 year-class may therefore have been favoured by the absence of competition and interactions with year-class 1996 and older ﬁsh. likewise, the absence of year-class 1998 may be due to interactions with the abundant 1997 year-class. however, before 1989, new year-classes appeared annually in krokavatn, despite the presence of strong year-classes of older ﬁsh. therefore, it is likely that recruitment failure in the high mountain populations of allopatric brown_trout is caused mainly by unfavourable winter and summer conditions. if the climate scenarios for the present century become a reality, many brown_trout populations in the western mountain range of norway will be affected, not only by a reduction in 381 borgstrøm & museth annual growth rates of older ﬁsh (borgstrøm 2001), but also by a marked decline in recruitment, as shown in the present study. as brown_trout on the hardangervidda mountain area may attain high ages, up to 38 years (svalastog 1991), such populations may withstand recruitment failure for extensive periods as long as there is little or no exploitation, contrary to brown_trout populations with much shorter life expectancy, as for example in spain, where brown_trout may reproduce only twice during their lifetime (lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004). although climate models do not predict substantial changes in summer temperatures in norway (benestad 2000; førland & hanssen-bauer 2001), warm sum- mers, like the one in 1997, may become more frequent. if so, the frequency of large year-classes may increase. environmental conditions in the streams and density-dependent mortality most probably limit the number of yoy in a cohort (le cren 1965; elliott 1994), but intracohort competition may be reduced because of migration of yoy to the lakes, as observed in lake krokavatn in 1997, and also in other lakes in the area (borgstrøm et al. 1993). however, is unlikely that strong year-classes will appear in subse- quent years because of intercohort competition in both the streams and in the shallow littoral zone of the lakes (bohlin 1977; borgstrøm et al. 1993). according to the numbers of year-class 2002 captured in both 2002 and 2003, interactions between subsequent cohorts may explain the low number of captured individuals of the year-class 2003 in september 2003, despite their relative large size. it high mountain lakes in southern norway are low productive, with low biomass of brown_trout even in allopatric populations (jensen 1977; borgstrøm 1992, 1994), and high recruitment may easily lead to overpopulation, as frequently seen in brown_trout populations (jensen 1977; jonsson 1985; borgstrøm 1994). excellent ﬁsheries in these high mountain lakes may therefore be destroyed both by excessive recruit- ment due to warm summers, or small or no recruitment either due to much accumulated snow and short growing seasons, or very little snow and total freezing of the streams. however, warmer summers may allow recruitment and establishment of brown_trout popula- tions in lakes at higher elevation than today, after stockings. resumen 1. de los 8000 km2 que forman el plato´ montan˜oso de hardangervidda en el sur de noruega, cientos de lagos esta´n habitados por poblaciones alopa´tridas de salmo_trutta. en la regio´n occidental de este a´rea, las precipitaciones invernales son considerables y resultan en acumulaciones de nieve de mas de tres metros en abril que varı´an de an˜o en an˜o. 382 2. en el lago krokavatn, a 1236 m sobre el nivel del mar, solo aparecieron 6 clases de edades fuertes durante el perı´odo 1970– 2003 mientras que 11 clases de edades pra´cticamente no aparecieron durante ese perı´odo. el reclutamiento fallo´ depen- diendo signiﬁcativamente de la profundidad de la nieve en abril mientras que la temperatura media en agosto en el an˜o de nacimiento tuvo un efecto signiﬁcativo sobre la fuerza de las clases de edad. el taman˜o de los juveniles-del-an˜o (yoy) al inicio del invierno parecio´ ser crucial para la supervivencia. poca nieve y bajas temperaturas durante el invierno tambie´n parecieron inducir fallos en el reclutamiento ya que pequen˜os aﬂuentes que funcionan como nurseries pueden congelarse bajo esas condiciones tal y como ocurrio´ en el invierno de 1995– 1996. ası´, el reclutamiento le las poblaciones de s. trutta en la regio´ n de altas montan˜as de noruega parecio´ estar fuertemente inﬂuenciado por la profundidad de la nieve acumulada y por la temperatura durante el verano. 3. un cambio clima´tico con mayores precipitaciones invernales, tal y como se predice para este siglo, podrı´a ser negativo para el reclutamiento. por otro lado, veranos mas calurosos podrı´an incrementar el reclutamiento a niveles que lleven a sobre- poblacio´ n pero tambie´n a establecer poblaciones a mayores altitudes de las actuales.
