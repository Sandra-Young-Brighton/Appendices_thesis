that drive habitat selection of species in communities is important in both ecology and evolution. in nature, species face variation in competi- tion, predation and physical characters among habitats. vendace (coregonus_albula (l.)) is a specialised zooplanktivorous fish predominantly using deeper water in lakes during summer, while roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)) uses mainly the shallow littoral zone as well as the upper layer of the pelagic zone. to understand mechanisms behind habitat use of these species, i first conducted a predation experiment to investigate their sensitivity to predation by perch (perca fluviatilis l.). second, i performed a foraging experiment using different temperature and light treatments. i then used metabolic calculations to estimate energetic costs when foraging. i found no difference between species regard- ing sensitivity to predation. vendace was the most efficient forager on zooplankton but also swam faster spending more energy compared to roach. roach had a compara- tively high metabolic rate in the lowest temperature, where their foraging efficiency was lowest. the energy gain ratio at 6°c was highest for vendace, while it was lowest for roach. in the highest temperature (18°c) and the lowest light level (1 lux), both species were similar in their energy gain ratio. the relative energy gain ratio provides a mechanism to explain habitat distribution for the two species. an increased under- standing of the role of metabolism in combination with biotic interactions and habitat use may help to foresee effects of environmental change for different species. k e y w o r d s competition, predation, metabolism, trade-off, zooplankton, coregonus_albula, rutilus rutilus 1 |  introduction in order to maximise their fitness, individuals will trade off the mor- tality risk to their possibilities of transferring food resources into biomass (gilliam & fraser, 1987; hölker, haertel, steiner, & mehner, 2002; mehner, 2012). animals may choose less profitable habitats to avoid predators, or take the risk of exposing themselves to predators if their energy need is large enough (rennie et al., 2010; vijayan, morris, & mclaren, 2012). in size- structured populations, for example fish, foraging capacities as well as predation risk vary with individual size (ten brink, mazumdar, huddart, persson, & cameron, 2015; byström & garcia- berthou, 1999; ohlberger et al., 2013). predation vulnera- bility and foraging efficiencies are both size dependent and will affect how organisms chose between habitats (diehl & eklöv, 1995; werner, gilliam, hall, & mittelbach, 1983). for example, byström, andersson, this is an open access article under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-noderivs license, which permits use and

year arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) depended on predation risk, while larger fish chose habitat according to food availability. apart from size- dependent biotic interactions, the performance of organisms in different habitats also depends on abiotic factors (diehl, 1988; dunson & travis, 1991; pekcan- hekim, joensuu, & horppila, 2013). within the species- specific temperature tolerance range, for- aging capacity generally increases with temperature (bergman, 1987; persson, 1986b). light conditions may also affect foraging success (cerri, 1983; guthrie & muntz, 1993). species- specific adaptions to abiotic conditions will affect the performance in different habitats (bergman, 1988; carmona- catot, magellan, & garcía- berthou, 2013; elliott, 2011). for example, light intensity and temperature may result in reversed outcomes of competition, which may facilitate species coexistence through habitat partitioning (bergman, 1987; mehner, busch, helland, emmrich, & freyhof, 2010; rodtka & volpe, 2007), or possibly lead to competitive exclusion (carmona- catot et al., 2013; oyugi, cucherousset, & britton, 2012). temperature and light will thus influence the performance of fish in different habitats through mechanisms connected to search veloc- ity and assimilation of food (clarke & johnston, 1999; hölker, 2006; persson, 1986a; walsh, haney, & timmerman, 1997). apart from mechanisms affecting energy intake, abiotic factors will also affect energy costs (huey, 1991; seth et al., 2013). standard metabolic rate, although it may vary between individuals, is for ectotherms mainly affected by the temperature of the environment (brown, gillooly, allen, savage, & west, 2004; rosenfeld, van leeuwen, richards, & allen, 2015). to better understand biotic and abiotic mechanisms underlying habitat selection of ectotherms, one way forward is to investigate how foraging efficiency in combination with net energy gain varies across habitats separated by abiotic factors. it has been shown that species and size classes within species segregate spatially in the pelagic zone (beier, 2001; hamrin, 1986; rowe, 1994). fish populations interacting in the pelagic zone, with a vertical gradient in light as well as tempera- ture, are therefore a suitable system for studying how abiotic factors interact with biotic interactions to regulate habitat selection. roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)), vendace (coregonus_albula (l.)) and perch (perca fluviatilis l.) are three common fish species in temperate lakes, all using the pelagic habitat, but to varying degrees (beier, 2001; horppila et al., 2000; svanbäck, eklöv, fransson, & holmgren, 2008). roach uses both the shallow habitat in the littoral zone and the upper parts of the pelagic zone (beier, 2001; bohl, 1980; gliwicz & jachner, 1992). vendace is a specialised zooplanktivorous fish species, mostly using depth zones (>6 m) in the pelagic zone of temperature- stratified temperate lakes during summer (beier, 2001; hamrin, 1986; mehner et al., 2010). it has also been shown that roach may show different rel- ative preference for the pelagic zone in lakes with or without vendace (beier, 2001). as both roach and vendace are planktivores but general- ly show different habitat affinities, they constitute a relevant example to study mechanisms governing habitat preference. in this study, i investigate whether the observed differences in habitat use of vendace and roach can be explained by sensitiv- ity to predation, and by relative foraging capacities together with     |  507 metabolic demands, when foraging on zooplankton in different parts of the pelagic zone. first, in a pond experiment i examine how roach and vendace are affected by predation from perch. second, in an aquaria experiment i compare relative foraging capacities as well as swimming speeds of roach and vendace in different temperature and light conditions. finally, i use bioenergetic models to estimate the energetic costs of foraging and derive energy gain ratios to explain the habitat distribution of these two species in the field. based on observations of biomass distribution in lakes, i defined possible explanatory mechanisms for the vertical separation of vendace and roach in the pelagic zone. the hypotheses tested to investigate mechanisms were as follows: 1) the two species have different costs regarding predation risk in an open habitat, 2a) the possibilities for ener- gy gain will increase with temperature for both species, 2b) the gain in energy intake for vendace is less affected by low temperature and low light levels than for roach, 2c) the costs in terms of metabolism are high- er in warmer water for vendace than for roach, and 2d) the net energy gain of vendace is higher than for roach in colder and darker water. 2 |  materials­ and­methods 2.1 | predation­experiment to study the relative sensitivity of roach and vendace to predation from perch in an open- water environment, experiments were per- formed in pond enclosures lacking vegetation. the size of fish used in the predation experiments matched the size interval where vendace were observed to occupy the pelagic habitat relatively more than the littoral/benthic habitat (6–9 cm) (beier, 2001). perch, roach and ven- dace were collected from lake mälaren during spring 1999, and spe- cies were kept separately in ponds during summer. in august 1999, i performed predation experiments in 7.3×11 m pond enclosures lack- ing vegetation, with 1.1 m mean water depth. in the experiments, i used four perch (mean length 196 mm, sd 9.5) as predators and 70 prey fish. as prey, i used only roach (mean length 63 mm, sd 13.3, mean weight 2.3 g, sd 1.4), only vendace (mean length 70 mm, sd 6.2, mean weight 2.3 g, sd 0.7) or 35 of each species together. each treatment was performed with six replicates. behaviour of predators and evasive behaviour of the different prey species were recorded by visual observation using polaroid glasses, at standardised time slots (2×45 min each per day) during daylight hours, speaking observations into a tape recorder. two observers performed the observations, at random distribution between treatments and periods. after 48 ± 2 hr, the remaining prey fish were collected and counted to determine the capture success of different prey in the different treatments. 2.2 | foraging­experiment from the foraging experiments, capture rates of the two species were analysed, then coupled to swimming rates when foraging. swimming rates were further used to model energetic costs, that is active meta- bolic rates (amr), and finally calculating the ratio of calculated energy intake to metabolic costs, expressed as the energy gain ratio. 508  |     to test foraging capacities, i performed experiments in aquaria with different temperature and light treatments. the size of fish used in the foraging experiments matched the predominant size interval of roach found in the pelagic zone in lakes during summer (10–13 cm tl, 10–20 g; beier, 2001), adjusted to the same body mass interval for both species. roach were collected from lake mälaren and vendace from lake vättern in november 1994 and kept in large tanks before the experiments. i used roach in the same body mass range (mean length = 11.5 cm, sd = 0.9, mean weight = 13.09 g, sd = 3.59) as vendace (mean length = 13.4 cm, sd = 0.95, mean weight = 14.58 g, sd = 3.80), to obtain comparable foraging capacities with respect to individual body mass. three randomly selected individuals of each species were acclimatised to temperature and light conditions in aquaria for at least 1 week prior to experiments. the experiments were performed in glass aquaria with a water column measurement of 68.8×68.8×43.8 cm (207.3 l). the aquaria were placed in climate rooms with aquarium lamps placed above the aquaria. fish were not fed for 3 hr (12 and 18°c) or 6 hr (6°c) before the experiments. the prey used were live daphnia magna filtered through a sieve, resulting in a median body length of 1.20 mm (mean = 1.4 mm, sd = 0.23, n = 168). in between experiments, the fish were fed with frozen zooplankton. temperature treatments were chosen according to a standardised situation in temperature- stratified lakes during summer (fig. 1). at a tem- perature corresponding to the epilimnion, where the two species coexist in the pelagic zone of lakes, two different light treatments were used to figure 1 generalised thermal stratification curve based on  data from 406 swedish lakes with ≥18 m maximum depth, sampled in july–august. median values of temperature from surface, bottom and the mid- metalimnion depth from sequential samples of each lake were used to plot median temperatures from all lakes;  at surface, that is 0.2 m depth (median = 18.6°c, mean 18.4°c,  sd = 2.6), mid- metalimnion depth (median = 6.5 m, mean = 7.0 m,  sd = 2.4), temperature at mid- metalimnion depth (median = 12.0°c, mean = 12.1°c, sd = 3.5), bottom temperature (median = 6.0°c,  mean = 6.4°c, sd = 1.8) and maximum depth (median = 24 m,  mean = 28.39 m, sd = 13.45). data from the nors database  (slu, 2016) beier test for relative foraging efficiencies. the light treatments used, that is 10 lux and 1 lux, reflect conditions in the pelagic epilimnion and metalim- nion. as an example, assuming a light extinction coefficient of 0.75 per m, approximately 10 lux can be expected at 4.5 m depth in normal daylight with 300 lux in surface water, whereas 1 lux can be expected at 4.5 m depth during twilight of 30 lux in surface water. the light intensity was measured by a lux meter with a flat surface, pressed against the centre of the front glass of the aquaria. the light intensity was adjusted by a dimmer. capture rates were measured for each of the two fish species at five different prey densities (0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 prey/l), at three different temperatures (6, 12 and 18 ± 0.2°c), and two light intensities (10 lux at all temperatures and 1 lux at 18°c). six replicates of each treatment were performed, choosing aquaria and climate rooms with randomisa- tion procedures. the zooplankton were counted and collected in plastic tubes and poured into a glass jar with water. upon the start of an exper- iment, the fish were carefully pushed to one side of the aquarium, which was then partitioned with a flexible plastic board. the prey were poured into the part of the aquarium without fish, and as the flexible board was carefully twisted and removed, the water mixed, and fish immediately started catching prey while recording begun. one individual of the three in each aquarium was chosen at random and the capture rate for that individual was recorded. an estimate of total prey depletion was based on the number of prey caught by the studied individual multiplied by three, as it was assumed that individuals had roughly similar capture rates. to avoid satiation and effects of prey depletion on foraging per- formance, estimates of capture rates were made before total depletion reached 25% at maximum and in most cases before it reached 10%. routine swimming performance was recorded immediately follow- ing the recordings of the capture rates, with the help of a grid on the front of the aquaria made up of 14 cm squares. additional routine swim- ming performance recordings were performed separately for 0.5 and 1 prey l densities, as prey were depleted quickly. furthermore, routine swimming performance in the absence of prey (nonforaging fish) was also recorded separately at 18°c in both light treatments. swimming speed was calculated correcting for three- dimensional movement, assuming that fish swam as much in z direction as in x and y direction. recording was performed by visual observation noting successful captures and grid positions a- z on a tape recorder, and the informa- tion was transferred using event recording software. captures could be clearly observed as movements of the mouth when the fish sucked the prey into their mouth. according to observations, the frequency of noncapture was negligible (<3%). capture rates for each species and treatment were fitted to a simplified holling type ii functional response model (persson, 1987). mean body lengths and weights of fish used, as well as individual swimming speeds from experiments, were applied to models for calculating active metabolic rate (amr) for roach (hölker & breckling, 2002) and vendace (ohlberger, staaks, & hölker, 2007), respectively, according to the formula: amr = a ⋅ mb1 ⋅ exp d ⋅ t + e ⋅ mb2 ⋅ uc where a, b1, b2, c, d and e are constants (table 1), m is body mass (g), t is temperature (°c), and u is swimming speed (cm/s). the ratio of beier table 1 constants

from swimming speed) and energy gain ratios were analysed with anova (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). values were ln- transformed prior to anal- yses to approach normal distribution. 3 |  results in the predation experiments, no significant difference between treat- ments with only roach, only vendace or mixed prey species was found regarding how many prey were caught by perch (anova, f = 1.645, df = 2, p = .226, fig. 2). in the mixed treatment, the difference in number of prey caught depending on species was also nonsignificant (anova, f = 2.211, df = 1, p = .168, fig. 2). roach and vendace showed different evasive behaviours when being pursued by perch. all prey fish normally schooled together, also in the mixed prey species treatment. upon attack from perch, roach dispersed and jumped above the surface, while vendace schooled more tightly, that is to a tight “ball,” and moved downwards. in the foraging experiments, the effect of temperature was signifi- cant on capture rate which increased with temperature (table 2, figs 3 and 4a). the capture rate of vendace was higher than for roach at all temperature and light treatments (table 2, fig. 3). in contrast to pre- dictions, roach capture rate was thus lower than for vendace also at 18°c (table 2, fig. 3). means of capture rates, swimming speeds and resulting constants from the holling type ii model are given in table 3. both roach and vendace had higher swimming speed at 12°c and 18°c compared to 6°c (tables 3 and 4, fig. 4b). when fish were for- aging, the swimming speed of vendace was higher than for roach in all temperature and light treatments (table 3, fig. 4b).     |  509 figure 2 captured prey (mean ± se) in pond enclosure experiments with perch (perca fluviatilis) used as predators and roach (rutilus

significantly with light treatment (table 2, figs 3 and 4a). there was no significant effect of light treatment for swimming speed when foraging for either species (tables 3 and 4, fig. 4b). estimated active metabolic rate (amr) calculated from swimming speed when foraging at 10 lux was higher for roach than for vendace at 6°c (anova, f = 61.687, df = 1, p < .001). at 12°c, amr estimates for both species were similar (anova, f = 1.365, df = 1, p = .248) while at 18°c amr for vendace was instead higher (anova, f = 17.609, df = 1, p < .001, fig. 5a). however, energy gain ratio, calculated as the ratio of energy gain from intake of zooplankton to metabolic costs (amr), was significantly higher for vendace than for roach in all temperatures when fish were foraging at 10 lux (6°c: anova, f = 47.038, df = 1, p < .001; 12°c: anova, f = 6.238, df = 1, p = .015; 18°c: anova, f = 7.197, df = 1, p = .10). however, at 18°c and 1 lux, the difference between the two species was nonsignificant (anova, f = .415, df = 1, p = .522, fig. 5b). in the treatment without prey (nonforaging fish), there was no significant difference between species in amr in the 10 lux treatment (anova, f = .769, df = 1, p = .394), nor in the 1 lux treatment (anova, f = 1.796, df = 1, p = .205). also, energy gain ratio was highest at 6°c and decreased with temperature for vendace, whereas it increased for roach which had the highest energy gain ratio at 18°c (fig. 5b). the two species were similar in their energy gain ratio at 18°c and 1 lux (fig. 5b). 4 |  discussion vendace capture rate was higher at 10

functional response model for roach (broken line) and vendace (solid line) respectively usually assumed to jointly govern habitat use, that is the trade- off between mortality risk and energy gain. because of the different size groups used in the two sets of experiments presented, it was not possible to calculate the μ/g ratio (mortality to growth; gilliam & fraser, 1987). however, the results, also including modelled metabo- lism, and being compared with published work on biomass distribu- tions, provide a basis for comparing the importance of predation risk versus energetic profits for habitat use. results from the presented experimental studies of predation and competition could hereby iden- tify underlying mechanisms for patterns of habitat use of roach and vendace observed in the field. predation is usually recognised as a principal force in ecosystems and may profoundly affect the habitat use of prey species (lima & dill, 1990; sih, 2005; werner et al., 1983). other studies have shown that the capture abilities of predators are directly affected by abiotic factors, as well as indirectly through altered behaviour or habitat use beier     y g r e n e n a e m d n a  r m a

prey (einfalt, grace, & wahl, 2012; eklöv & persson, 1995; martin, fodrie, heck, & mattila, 2010). roach and vendace showed different evasive behaviours when being pursued by perch, and ven- dace seemed more adapted to escaping predators in a deep water column. the different evasive behaviours of roach and vendace may also explain the principal habitat use of predation- sensitive stages of the two species. mehner, kasprzak, and hölker (2007) suggested that vendace avoided the littoral/benthic zone and preferred deeper water as a response to predation risk. horizontal migrations by roach out to the pelagic zone at night (bohl, 1980; gliwicz & jachner, 1992) may be a way for roach to reduce predation risk while utilising the warm water in the epilimnion. this study’s lack of corroboration for the prediction that vendace would be more susceptible than roach to predation by perch indicates that reasons for differences in habitat use between roach and vendace may also be other than solely predation. another suggested driver for differences in the use of vertical habitat by vendace is density dependence (mehner, 2015). however, to fur- ther clarify its role as a driving force, it is motivated to separate density dependence into actual mechanisms that determine energy gain ratio. capture rate and swimming speed increased with temperature for both species, as expected for ectotherms (johnston & dunn, 1987). ohlberger, mehner, staaks, and hölker (2008) previously studied cap- ture rates of vendace at 8°c and 5 lux, however without indicating the sizes of the fish, and used slightly larger daphnia magna than in the present study, which makes direct comparisons uncertain. in spite of different set- ups, ohlberger et al. (2008) arrived at maximum cap- ture rates in the same order of magnitude as the results from 6°c to 12°c at 10 lux, which strengthens the comparatively high capture rate of vendace estimated in the present study the higher capture rate of vendace across all temperatures suggests that vendace could outcom- pete roach from the pelagic zone completely, while field studies have demonstrated that this is not the case (e.g. beier, 2001; bohl, 1980; gliwicz & jachner, 1992; svanbäck et al., 2008). thus, temperature- dependent foraging alone cannot explain the habitat use of vendace. roach are hardly found below 10–12 m in lakes, which has been sug- gested to result from roach being adapted to warmer temperatures (kahl & radke, 2006). in contrast, vendace has been identified as a cold- water species (hamrin, 1986), presumably feeding more efficient- ly at colder temperatures. however, as vendace was in fact most effi- cient in the highest temperature, this does not provide a satisfactory explanation for why the two species are spatially separated, as ven- dace mainly uses the deeper, colder water. thus, the species- specific effect of temperature on foraging efficiencies did not explain the hab- itat use of roach and vendace. the importance of light intensity for foraging efficiency and pred- ator avoidance varies greatly between species (einfalt et al., 2012; mehner, 2012). results from the present study showed that the cap- ture rate of roach eating zooplankton was independent of light inten- sity, whereas the capture rate of vendace decreased in the lower light conditions. similarly, no effect of light for the foraging efficiency of roach was found in previous studies, although negative effects were found for interacting species perch (diehl, 1988) or pike (jönsson, ranåker, nilsson, & brönmark, 2012). as capture rates of roach were beier     |  513 table 4 results from two 3- way anova’s testing differences in swimming speed (cm/s) for roach and vendace foraging on zooplankton (daphnia magna, median body length 1.20 mm) in aquarium experiments using different densities (prey/l), light and temperature treatments. statistical significance (p < .05) indicated by * comparison source­of­variation ss­(type­ii) 10 lux at 6°, 12° and 18° swimming speed 10 lux and 1 lux at 18° swimming speed density (prey/l). species temperature species×temperature prey density species×density species×temperature×prey density error species light species×light prey density species×prey density species×light×prey density error 5.384 7.339 0.129 0.361 0.154 0.992 7.526 3.166 0.012 0.059 0.120 0.478 0.163 848.8 df 1 1 2 2 4 4 149 1 1 1 4 4 8 100 f 106.59 72.64 1.28 1.79 3.06 1.228 99.249 .375 1.849 .941 3.746 .637 p <.001* <.001* .282 .134 .019* .253 <.001* .541 .177 .443 .008* .745 (a) capture rate (prey s–1) (b) swimming speed (cm s–1) figure 4 (a) capture rate (prey/s, mean ± se) and (b) swimming speed (cm/s, mean ± se) for roach (black squares) and vendace (white circles) in different temperature and light treatments when foraging on zooplankton (daphnia magna) at varying densities (pooled data from six replicates each, using 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 prey/l respectively). the light treatment of 1 lux is marked by a shaded area not reduced by lower light, this could indicate that roach would also use deeper water, which they in fact do not (beier, 2001). however, the relative insensitivity of roach to lower light levels when forag- ing could help to explain why roach migrate into the warm epilim- nion of the pelagic zone at night, where their efficiency is relatively high. furthermore, despite the use of deeper waters in the pelagic zone by vendace, results from this study show that vendace seem not to be particularly adapted to low light levels. these findings are in correspondence with that coregonids have been reported to be comparatively inactive at night in the field (gjelland, bøhn, knudsen, & amundsen, 2004; huusko & sutela, 1998), which may further indi- cate that their vision is not specifically adapted for low light levels. foraging abilities in different temperatures depend on the capac- ities to move around, and capture prey. however, swimming per- formance will also cost energy, which may be an energetic trap for ectothermic organisms. in this study, swimming speed and amr did not differ significantly depending on light level for either species, whereas swimming speed generally increased with temperature. for vendace, however, there was no difference in swimming speed between 12°c and 18°c. vendace is thus able to consume more prey than roach, but will swim faster and spend comparatively high amounts of energy in the upper waters of the pelagic zone. this is also confirmed in this study by the highest estimated amr for vendace found at 18°c, comparable for the same size interval with metabolic rates reported for vendace at 15°c by ohlberger et al. (2007). roach, on the other hand, were less efficient at reducing their metabolism in lower temperatures, and their estimated amr was higher than for vendace at 6°c, despite that roach swam less than vendace at this low temperature. temperature affecting the metabolic costs can thus explain why roach avoid using the cold, deeper water and why vendace avoid the upper, warm water, as their energy gain ratio was highest in the lowest temperature. 514  |     beier figure 5 (a) estimated active metabolic rate (amr, j/hr) and (b) ratio of energy intake from capture rates (prey/s converted to j/hr) to estimated active metabolic rate (amr) (mean ± 1 se) for roach (black squares) and vendace (white circles) in different temperature and light treatments when foraging on daphnia magna (pooled data from different prey densities, six replicates of each density). amr was estimated according to hölker and breckling (2002) for roach and ohlberger et al. (2007) for vendace. swimming speed and capture rate for each replicate were applied together with mean lengths and weights of roach and vendace respectively. shaded area marks the treatment with 1 lux if only metabolic costs were considered, both species would choose the coldest temperature, although roach avoids it. on the oth- er hand, if only foraging rates were considered, both species would choose the warmest temperature, although vendace does not. hence, neither foraging rate nor metabolic costs can on their own explain habitat use, but in light of each other they provide important infor- mation on relative habitat profitability. thus, the net energy gain in different temperatures needs to be analysed, here calculated as the ratio of mean intake of captured prey to amr, that is the energy cost while swimming. energy gain ratio was indeed higher for vendace in all treatments, except in the lowest light level at 18°c, where the two species were similar. apart from reducing predation risk, a relatively high energy gain ratio may explain why roach utilise the warmer water at times when light levels are low and performing horizontal migra- tions out to the pelagic zone at night (bohl, 1980; gliwicz & jachner, 1992). although migrating would increase energy expenditure (hölker et al., 2002), this study demonstrates that the relatively high energy gain of roach at low light levels in the epilimnion may indeed com- pensate for energy costs. accordingly, the relative energy gain ratio can also explain why vendace prefer colder water, in that their ener- gy gain ratio was highest in 6°c. altogether, results show that the main mechanism to explain the habitat distribution of vendace and roach is how their energy gain ratios are affected by temperature and light, as deduced from capture rates, metabolic costs as well as amr. however, this study focusing on mechanisms in connection to abiotic factors has ignored the fact that zooplankton composition, abundance and production may vary vertically in lakes (e.g. gaedke, 1992). other studies have related habitat use of competing species to their differences in relative foraging abilities in different habitats (e.g. bergman, 1988; diehl, 1988; okun & mehner, 2005; persson & eklöv, 1995). the metabolic demands of different species under different envi- ronmental conditions have also been related to habitat use on different scales (hölker, 2006; huey, 1991; mehner et al., 2010; rosenfeld et al., 2015; walsh et al., 1997). furthermore, metabolism in combination with foraging efficiency has been discussed to explain habitat use of different species, exemplified with predicted consequences of climate change (finstad et al., 2011; seth et al., 2013). however, studies which have focused on relative gain to energy loss, that is treated both for- aging efficiency and metabolism, have so far concentrated on mod- elling long- term intraspecific effects of changed temperature regimes for population dynamics (ohlberger, edeline, vøllestad, stenseth, & claessen, 2011; van de wolfshaar, de roos, & persson, 2008). to date, studies on quantifying metabolic requirements together with foraging efficiencies to explain habitat use are lacking. to evaluate which habitat is energetically most profitable, however, the energy gain ratio may not be the appropriate measure. rather, the net energy intake, after subtracting energetic costs from energy gains, may further facilitate understanding of habitat use in studies of size- structured populations. because consumers trade off predation risk to energy gain, it is necessary to account for biotic and abiotic factors affecting the rela- tive significance of predation mortality, food availability and net ener- gy gain, when aiming to explain habitat selection in natural systems. using interacting fish species as model organisms, i have shown that the sensitivity to predation in an open- water habitat did not suffi- ciently explain the habitat use of two competing species. furthermore, results from capture rates and active metabolic rates, respectively, across varying temperature and light conditions could not fully explain the habitat separation between roach and vendace. instead, foraging experiments and estimates from bioenergetic equations using data from the experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms for differ- ent habitat use can be sought in factors contributing to the energy gain ratio. as metabolic traits of competing species are connected to foraging efficiency and swimming performance, thereby attaining an estimate of net energy gain, a mechanistic explanation for the habitat beier choice of roach and vendace in the pelagic zone has been provided. including metabolic traits in studies of food webs can increase our knowledge of how the habitat use of different species may be affected by environmental change. acknowledgements i am grateful to l. persson, m. appelberg and p. eklöv for help- ful suggestions when setting up the study. i thank a. gårdmark, l. persson, m. appelberg, j. ohlberger, r. svanbäck, j. de leeuw, and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on the manuscript. experiments were carried out in accordance with all applicable insti- tutional and national guidelines for the care and use of animals. the study was financially supported by the former swedish board of fisheries, university of umeå, slu (swedish university of agricultural sciences), and a grant from the swedish council for forestry and agricultural research to m. appelberg. references beier, u.
