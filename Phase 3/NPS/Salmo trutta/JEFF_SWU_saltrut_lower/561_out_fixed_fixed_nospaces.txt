(2006) subjected the atlantic silverside, and the a heavily harvested marine ﬁsh, to size-selective mortality regimes over ﬁve generations. the silver- side showed dramatic declines in fecundity, egg volume, larval size at hatch, larval viability, larval growth rates, food consumption rate and conversion efﬁciency, and willingness to forage. such changes may increase ﬁtness by reducing intra-speciﬁc selecting for morphotypes more competition or to ﬁshing pressure, but may also be an resistant impediment to population recovery (walsh et al. 2006). for example, some collapsed ﬁsheries fail to recover even when ﬁshing pressure decreases or ceases (hutchings & reynolds 2004), and this may be due, at to smaller and slower- growing individuals being unable to restock the population to original levels i.e., ﬁsh may become smaller and slower growing making them more ﬁt under large-sized selected ﬁshing, but less ﬁt under natural conditions. in this study, we looked for evidence of phenotypic change in the intensively harvested nile perch (lates niloticus) is consistent with predictions of nonrandom ﬁshing mortality. in part, least that 380 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00355.x the lake victoria story – overﬁshed and ⁄ or overproductive? the same time, in lake victoria, africa’s single most important source of inland ﬁsheries production, anthropogenic stressors, in particular, overﬁshing, species introduc- tions and eutrophication, have contributed to massive ecological changes in the system (e.g., graham 1929; hecky et al. 1994; kaufman et al. 1997; ogutu- ohwayo 1990). after it was ﬁshed down in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, a series of food ﬁshes were introduced into the lake basin, including the predatory nile perch, l. niloticus, to compensate for depleting commercial ﬁsheries and to boost a sport ﬁshing industry (jackson 2000; balirwa et al. 2003; pringle 2005). a dramatic increase of nile perch in the 1980s coincided with the disappearance of 40% of the 500+ endemic haplochromine cichlid species (witte et al. 1992; seehausen et al. 1997a,b; balirwa 2007). at the nile perch ﬁshing industry attracted unparalleled levels of national and interna- tional capital investment, sparked the development of 90 ﬁsh freezing factories (balirwa et al. 2003), and fuelled a ﬁsh export market that reached $250 million in 2003 (lvfo 2005; balirwa 2007). management of the lake victoria ﬁsheries has been informed by research initiatives and empirical models predicting the impacts of ﬁshing regimes on nile perch and the cascading effects to native species. recommendations derived from these models included restricting gill nets mesh sizes to maximise sustainable catch while preserving native species, and ubiquitous caution to manage ﬁshing effort in order to avoid a collapse in the nile perch ﬁshery. despite ﬁshing regulations, as an open-access resource, the level of exploitation of nile perch has been difﬁcult to control; in recent years, yield has declined as ﬁshing effort has increased (balirwa et al. 2003; matsuishi et al. 2006; mkumbo et al. 2007). decline in nile perch yield has coincided with a resurgence of native species suggesting that ﬁshing on nile perch may enhance biodiversity (balirwa et al. 2003). these trends support ﬁshing as an important driver of change in the lake victoria system; however, it has also been argued that the main drivers of ecological changes in lake victoria over the last several decades are the bottom-up effects of eutrophication – not ﬁshing pressure (kolding et al. 2008). eutrophication has increased in lake victoria since the 1920s as population density expanded in the riparian countries bordering lake victoria primarily through industrialisation and land-use change (ver- schuren et al. 2002). kolding et al. (2008) argue that the role of eutrophication on the nile perch ﬁshery is monumental relative to ﬁshing pressure. based on expected and observed trends in in lake victoria, ecological change in nile perch length-based and catch per unit effort (cpue) indica- tors of over-exploitation, kolding et al. (2008) rea- soned that there are no signs of overﬁshing in the indicators used and thus, that the top-down effects of ﬁshing cannot be inﬂuencing the system in a substantial way. one approach to grasp the extent to which ﬁshing impacts nile perch populations is to monitor nile perch in response to intensive ﬁshing in a lake not as strongly inﬂuenced by anthropogenic inputs. lake nabugabo is a small satellite of the larger lake victoria (greenwood 1965), and has experienced a similar pattern of faunal collapse and resurgence in response to the introduction of nile perch without the dramatic increases in nutrient loadings and productiv- ity seen in lake victoria. it is thus a useful system for exploring the response of nile perch to environmental change (food web alterations, ﬁshing pressure) coin- cident with its own invasion. the objective of this study was to quantify phenotypic change in the introduced nile perch of lake nabugabo of east africa in response to decades of intensive ﬁshing pressure. speciﬁcally, we investigated temporal (12 years from 1995 to 2007) and spatial variation (wetland habitats versus open water habitats) in the cpue, size and diet of nile perch in lake nabugabo during a period of intensive ﬁshing. methods study site lake nabugabo is a small water body (5 km long and wide; surface area 25 km2; mean depth = 4.5 m) just south of the equator in uganda that became separated from lake victoria 5000 years ago (cnbs 1962, greenwood 1965; beadle 1981; stager et al. 2005). the major source of water inﬂow to lake nabugabo is through the juma river (fig. 1). lake water ﬂows eastward through lwamunda swamp and into lake victoria (beadle 1974). the lake is described as a nutrient-deﬁcient system; the bedrock and soils are very old with low salt content (kateyo 2006). much of the lake margin is isolated from any signiﬁcant form of human-induced nutrient input by a dense wetland. developments along the west side of the lake (three vacation centres ⁄ hotels and small bays where cattle farmers lead their herds to drink) are clearly point sources of nutrient the change in trophic state of the lake has been modest compared to lake victoria. in her study of post 1880 sediment and phosphorus accumulation rates in lake nabugabo using a sediment core, cangelosi (1998) reported increasing organic matter and phosphorus accumula- tion throughout the past century; however, there is no record in recent history of dramatic changes in water transparency or algal blooms that characterise the input; however, 381 paterson & chapman larger lake victoria, and there has been no invasion of water hyacinth. in addition, secchi depth (water transparency) in open-water areas has remained at a similar level (70 cm) for over a decade (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; eﬁtre et al. 2001). in 1962, and 10 cichlids: the ﬁsh community within lake nabugabo has changed dramatically over the past half century coincident with the introduction of nile perch in the early 1960s. the cambridge nabugabo biological survey (cnbs 1962) catalogued the native fauna of lake nabugabo and reported 20 noncichlid species (including, as examples, protopterus aethio- picus, bagrus docmak, schilbe intermedius and cla- rias gariepinus) two tilapias, oreochromis esculentus and oreochromis variabilis, and eight haplochromine cichlids. nile perch were introduced into lake nabugabo in 1960 (85 individ- uals), but were absent in a sampling survey in 1962 (cnbs 1962). three years later, approximately 180 more nile perch were introduced into lake nabugabo (gee 1964). the latter two introductions led to its successful invasion that resulted in the development of an important ﬁshery, but also coincided with collapse of the native ﬁsh community. by 1991–1992, many of the native species of lake nabugabo had disappeared from the open waters (ogutu-ohwayo 1993). before the nile perch ﬁshery, p. aethiopicus, b. docmak, s. esculentus, o. variabilis and haplochromines were the most important commercial catches; by the early 1990s, they were rare and replaced in the ﬁshery by introduced nile tilapia, and introduced nile perch, the native s. sadleri and r. argentea (cnbs 1962, ogutu-ohwayo 1993). intermedius, brycinus intermedius, c. gariepinus, o. changes in the main lake fauna were dramatic, however, remnant populations of several ﬁsh species in lake nabugabo have persisted with nile perch through the use of wetland refugia and ⁄ or other mechanisms. studies in the 1990s demonstrated that wetlands serve as structural and low-oxygen refugia 382 fig. 1. map of major ugandan lakes and transects sampled in 1995, 2000 and 2007 in lake nabugabo, uganda. closed-in circles along the lake nabugabo border are tran- sects from which the sampling sites were randomly selected in 2007. figure adapted from schoﬁeld & chapman (1999). for ﬁshes that can tolerate wetland conditions, and limit dispersal of nile perch (chapman et al. 1996a,b; schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; chapman et al. 2002). some haplochromines and some noncichlids are relatively tolerant of hypoxia, while nile perch is not (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; chapman et al. 2002), thus permitting some indigenous species to persist in wetlands under reduced predator pressure. ecotonal wetlands have been particularly important refugia in lake nabugabo because interaction with the main lake waters elevates dissolved oxygen (do); nile perch have been rare in these ecotonal habitats, and species richness is higher than in the interior swamp (chap- man et al. 1996a,b; schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; chapman et al. 2002). in the early 1990s, the emer- gent wetland grass miscanthidium violaceum was a dominant wetland macrophyte along the wetland ⁄ open water ecotone; however, since that time, the emergent hippo grass vossia cuspidata has proliferated from small patches extending from the m. violaceum margin to extensive zones that now dominate the perimeter of the wetland ecotone. the ﬁsheries of lake nabugabo are both commer- cial and artisanal, and ﬁshing is an open-access resource. nile perch and nile tilapia are the most important catches in the lake and are ﬁshed intensively (ogutu-ohwayo 1994; chapman et al. 2003). size- selective gill netting is the predominant method of catch, while long-lining is carried out in the deeper offshore waters (mbabazi 2006). sampling of lake nabugabo, 2007 the habitat in june and july of 2007, type of 54 transects along the western half of lake nabugabo was characterised as wetland or exposed (i.e., rocky and forest edge) ecotone. wetlands were further categorised based on the dominant shoreline macro- phyte being either m. violaceum or v. cuspidata. to quantify the relative abundance of nile perch and their prey among the major habitat types of lake nabug- abo, ﬁve 20-m long transects were randomly selected for each of the three ecotonal habitats. all sampling was done using a combination of metal minnow traps and 30-m experimental gill nets (four panels: 25.4, 50.8, 76.2, 101.6 mm stretched mesh). at each transect, 10 minnow traps were set at 5-m intervals to m. violaceum or along the shoreline (adjacent v. cuspidata in wetland ecotones and beside rocky or forest edge for exposed ecotones). experimental gill nets were then set approximately 5, 20 and 100 m from the shoreline structure (e.g., emergent macro- phytes, forest deadfall) and parallel to the shoreline and staggered to minimise overlap with respect to the shoreline, producing a total sample size of 45 gill nets set in the lake (three per transect). all traps and nets were set mid morning to early afternoon (10:00 am to 2:00 pm) at which time environmental data were taken, and the physical characteristics of sampling sites were recorded. traps and nets were pulled between 7:00 and 10:00 hours the following morning. active feeding of nile perch occurs predominantly at dawn and dusk (olowo et al. 2004) such that speci- mens collected for stomach content analysis repre- sented a range of digestive stages. the following environmental data were recorded at each trap sampling site and at both ends of the gill nets: water column depth, water transparency, do )1), water temperature (°c), dominant vegetation, (mgæl and bottom type. water transparency was quantiﬁed using a secchi disk. do and water temperature were measured with an ysi oxygen meter (model 51b) (yellow springs, ohio, usa) in the upper 20 cm of the water column when water was <1 m deep, and at both the surface and directly above the lake bottom when water depth was >1 m. all ﬁshes were identiﬁed in the boat to the lowest taxonomic category possible, measured for total length (tl), and released alive at the site of capture whenever possible. nile perch across a wide size range (5–55 cm tl) were retained for stomach content analyses. fish were killed either by emersion in buffered ms222 (tricaine methanesulfonate), or for larger ﬁsh, with a stunning blow to the head. nile perch caught fresh on a given sampling day were purchased from local ﬁshers in order to increase the number of nonempty stomachs used for the diet study. retained specimens were brought back to shore where stomachs were removed. stomach contents of nile perch were analysed following methods used in schoﬁeld & chapman (1999) and chapman et al. to facilitate direct comparison across these studies. prey items were identiﬁed, blotted dry and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. identiﬁcation was done to the smallest taxonomic classiﬁcation possible and was limited when stomach contents were extremely digested. the (2003) ecological change in nile perch following parameters were used to assess dietary patterns of nile perch: (1) relative abundance (% n = the number of times each type of food item is found as a percentage of all food items), (2) frequency of occurrence (% f = the number of nile perch containing each prey taxon, divided by the total number of nonempty stomachs) and (3) per cent mass (% m = the mass of each type of food category expressed as a percentage of the total mass of the stomach contents). relative abundance, frequency of occurrence and percent mass were combined to yield the (4) index of relative importance (iri) of each food category that provides a single estimate of dietary importance. to assess temporal changes in the distribution, size and diet of nile perch over the past 12 years, published data collected in 1995 and 2000 (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; chapman et al. 2003) were com- pared with data from our 2007 habitat survey. only ﬁsh that were £35 cm tl were used for these comparisons to standardise for size across studies. to assess temporal shifts in the ecotonal macrophytes (m. violaceum vs. v. cuspidata), we calculated the percentage of each wetland habitat dominated by m. violaceum and v. cuspidata based on habitat characteristics recorded for randomly selected tran- sects in 1995, 2000 and 2007 (paterson 2009). statistical methods environmental data split-plot two-way anova was used to test for an effect of habitat (m. violaceum, v. cuspidata, forest edge), distance (5, 20 and 100 m), and their interaction on do and water temperature in the upper 20 cm of the water column for all transects sampled in 2007. sidak post hoc tests were used when main effects were signiﬁcant; and the statistical analyses were based on data collected at the gill net sites. do and water temperature values collected at trap sites were com- pared across habitats with anova; values were averaged for the 10 trap sites in each transect. fish distribution and abundance the cpue of nile perch and haplochromines were treated as separate dependent variables in a split-plot two-way anova to test for effects of habitat (m. violaceum vs. v. cuspidata vs. exposed), distance from shore (5, 20 and 100 m), and their interaction. mean values for the cpue of haplochromines were transformed (log10 + 1) for analysis and back trans- formed for presentation. to compare cpue data from 2007 to earlier sampling years (1995 and 2000), the ﬁsh captured in experimental gill nets from m. violaceum and v. cuspidata transects were combined as one group 383 paterson & chapman representing wetland ﬁsh (2007 wetland transects; n = 10, exposed transects n = 5) and compared to ﬁsh captured in 1995 and 2000 (wetland transects; n = 10, exposed transects n = 10). sampling for all years was done in the may–july period (may–july for 2005, may for 2000, june–july for 2007). as data for 100 m offshore were not available in 1995, we compared data for 5 and 20 m from shore for the two major ecotonal types (wetland, exposed). a repeated-measure approach was not applied, because randomly selected transects in 2007 differed from those in 1995 and 2000. rather, we treated each ecotone ⁄ distance combination as a separate data set and used one-way anova to test for effects of year (1995, 2000 and 2007) on cpue for the four habitat and distance combinations: (1) wetland inshore (2) wetland offshore (3) exposed inshore and (4) exposed offshore. when there were overall year effects, the sidak post hoc test was used to compare speciﬁc years. the data for nile perch were square root transformed, and the data for the haplochromine cichlids were log transformed (log10 + 1) to normalise the data and stabilise the variance across years; both data sets were back transformed for presentation. size size frequency histograms were created by calculating the percentage of nile perch in 5-cm size classes from the total nile perch for each habitat type in 2007. anova was used to test for an effect of habitat (m. violaceum, v. cuspidata, forest edge), distance (5, 20 and 100 m), and their interaction on the tl of nile perch for transects run in 2007. all distances were combined for each habitat type; and a one-way anova with sidak post hoc tests was then used to further explore habitat effects. to compare the 2007 size trends for nile perch to earlier years, we ﬁrst quantiﬁed the size–frequency distributions of nile perch in each year for all habitats combined. given the change in the distribution across years, we used the distribution-free kruskal–wallis test to detect a difference in median total length of nile perch over time. mann–whitney u-tests (corrected for multiple comparisons) were used as post hoc tests to explore inter-year differences. a one-way anova was used to test the effect of habitat type on the mean tl of nile perch within each sampling year. results environmental data there were strong effects of habitat (f = 35.073, p < 0.001), distance (f = 14.007, p < 0.001), and the habitat by distance interaction (f = 5.420, p = 0.001) in m. violaceum (mean on do. it was lowest 384 c b a m. violaceum v. cuspidata exposed a a b 5 m 20 m 100 m 5 m 20 m 100 m (a) 9.0 ) l / g m ( o d e g a r e v a 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 (b) 26.0 ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t e g a r e v a 25.6 25.2 24.8 24.4 24.0 23.6 m. violaceum v. cuspidata exposed habitat fig. 2. average surface (a) dissolved oxygen (do) concentration )1) and (b) temperature (°c) at 5, 20 and 100 m distances (mgæl from the shoreline of wetland (dominated by miscanthidium violaceum or vossia cuspidata) and exposed ecotones of lake nabugabo. signiﬁcant differences in mean do and temperature across habitats are denoted by the letters a, b and c. standard error bars are included. )1), in highest exposed do = 6.1 mgæl habitats )1), and intermediate in v. cuspidata (do = (8.1 mgæl )1, fig. 2a). do increased with distance from 6.8 mgæl shore in m. violaceum (p = 0.001) and v. cuspidata (p = 0.015) but did not vary with distance in exposed habitats (p = 0.148). data collected at trap stations indicated the lowest do values in m. violaceum followed by v. cuspidata, and exposed habitats (mean )1, respectively, anova, do: 4.6, 5.6 and 7.3 mgæl f = 82.4, p < 0.01). it was more difﬁcult to get accurate do measures near the bottom of the gill nets because of disturbed soft mud sediments in some habitats;

(n = 3) and r. argentea (n = 10) supplementing the cichlid- dominated diet. before the mid-1990s, rastrineobola argentea and nile perch juveniles were the most important prey item (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999). in 2007, the size at which nile perch switched from invertebrate feeding to piscivory when habitats were combined occurred when nile perch were between 10 and 15 cm tl. this is similar to the size at shift in 2000 when haplochromines were resurging in the system, however, it is dramatically different than in 1995 when haplochromines were rare (fig. 8). discussion the future of the nile perch ﬁshery in lake nabugabo is difﬁcult to predict; however, if current levels of ﬁshing continue, future stocks may consist of smaller ﬁsh with lower commercial value. based on data collected over a 12-year period (1995–2007), we detected a decline in cpue of nile perch, a shift in their distribution and diet, and a decline in their body size. in addition, a larger proportion of nile perch are now found near wetland ecotones than in the mid- 1990s. this may reﬂect both direct and indirect results of intensive size-selective ﬁshing in more open waters; as well as the encroachment of v. cuspidata, an emergent macrophyte that has expanded to cover much of the lake’s perimeter over the past decade (kateyo 2006). transformation of ecotonal wetlands: implications for predator–prey overlap identifying key habitats of ﬁshes is important to understanding dynamics among species, particularly interactions between predator and prey that may be modulated by habitat complexity (crowder & cooper 1982; sih 1984; savino & stein 1989; tyler & 388 s s a m t n e c r e p 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 invertebrates fish 1995 10–15 15–20 20–25 25–30 30–35 10–15 15–20 20–25 25–30 30–35 2000 2007 10–15 20–25 15–20 size class (cm) 25–30 30–35 fig. 8. per cent mass of ﬁshes and invertebrates in the stomach contents of nile perch in wetland and exposed habitats in lake nabugabo in 1995, 2000 and 2007. data from 1995 and 2000 were adapted from schoﬁeld & chapman (1999) and chapman et al.

mittlebach 1981; savino & stein 1982, 1989; werner et al. 1983; persson & eklo¨v 1995; stuart-smith & white 2008). in lake nabug- abo, in the structurally complex wetland ecotones and in the habitat distribution of the nile perch may have important implications for predator– prey interactions. in 1995, the low abundance of nile perch in wetland ecotones was attributed to low levels of do in m. violaceum habitats and the high structural complexity in these areas (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999). at that time, it was argued that dense wetlands and wetland ecotones minimise interaction between nile perch and haplochromine prey and thus serve as important habitat refugia for some indigenous ﬁshes (chapman et al. 1996a,b; schoﬁeld & chapman 1999). over a 12-year period (1995–2007), approximately 70% of the miscanthidium-dominated wetland eco- tones along the western shores of lake nabugabo were encroached upon by v. cuspidata. in lake nabugabo, m. violaceum aggregates in very dense stands of emergent grass, while v. cuspidata is found in deeper water with grass fronds of sufﬁcient spread to facilitate penetration by larger ﬁshes. from 1995 to 2000 haplochromine cichlids resurged in wetland habitats of lake nabugabo (chapman et al. 2003). in 2007, we found haplochromines to be most in v. cuspidata habitats, although their abundant overall cpue in wetland ecotones shows a marginal decline since 2000. for haplochromine cichlids, v. cuspidata habitats may provide structural complex- ity that minimises predation risk and a rich foraging spot where macroinvertebrate densities and detrital materials are high (mwebaza 1994; eﬁtre et al. 2001; kateyo 2006). for nile perch, v. cuspidata may be more accessible in terms of physicochemical condi- tions and penetrability than the much denser, more hypoxic m. violaceum while also housing the greatest supply food haplochromines, kaufman & schwartz 2002). optimal of (viz. sixty-seven per cent of the diet of nile perch in v. cuspidata was comprised of cichlids, and over 80% of cichlids captured in nets set in v. cuspidata were haplochromines. in m. violaceum and exposed eco- tones, haplochromines were far less abundant; and nile perch consumed less cichlids. nile perch juve- niles were the most important prey item in exposed ecotones. interestingly, the capture of small nile perch juveniles (3.0–13.5 cm tl) in minnow traps was highest in the v. cuspidata habitat, which may reﬂect their use of high structural complexity to minimise cannibalistic encounters with larger nile perch. this high number of small juveniles captured in wetland ecotones versus exposed ecotones also suggests that nile perch juveniles may be more resistant to wetland conditions than previously thought and ⁄ or the lake- ward extension of hippo grass is providing a more desirable habitat for juvenile perch. the v. cuspidata succession is not unique to lake nabugabo. in lake victoria, v. cuspidata has become common in the nyanza gulf of kenya where water hyacinth once congested littoral waters (omondi & mwendi 2006). in lake victoria, it has been argued that the recent spread of v. cupisdata reﬂects succes- sion after the invasion of water hyacinth (omondi & mwendi 2006). alternatively, the haplochromines that had previously hindered estab- lishment of macrophytes through their constant dis- turbance of the substrate could have facilitated invasion of v. cuspidata (witte et al. 1992). lake nabugabo has not experienced water hyacinth inva- sion to date, but has suffered collapse of its haplo- the demise of ecological change in nile perch chromine fauna after introduction of the nile perch (ogutu-ohwayo 1993; chapman et al. 1996b; scho- ﬁeld & chapman 1999). it is possible that v. cuspidata may continue to spread in lake nabugabo depending on the degree of recovery of the haplochromine fauna. the continued spread of v. cuspidata around the periphery of lake nabugabo may act to stabilise interactions between nile perch and haplochromines by providing sufﬁcient structural complexity to foster a high recruitment of haplochromines; and a refuge for nile perch from ﬁshers in which they can feed on their preferred prey. however, it is also possible that the apparent decline in the cpue of haplochromines in the wetland ecotones of lake nabugabo may reﬂect increased predation by nile perch in this habitat. in 2007 nile perch in or near v. cuspidata fed most heavily on cichlids (67% of the biomass of stomach contents). in 1995, when v. cuspidata grew only in isolated patches along the m. violaceum dominated wetlands, cichlids comprised <10% of the total ﬁsh prey of nile perch across habitat types. as v. cuspidata habitat is estimated to have increased (in terms of perimeter spread) by approximately 70% since 1995, the predation rate on cichlids is likely to have increased much more than indicated by diet data alone. vossia cuspidata growth along wetland shore- lines may have increased overlap between predator and prey in recent years. future studies in this system need to explore in more detail the lakewide effect of v. cuspidata on nile perch predation rates by extensive mapping of shoreline macrophytes and random sam- pling of nile perch stomachs across the entire lake. could overﬁshing select for smaller, swampy nile perch? the shift in the distribution of nile perch in lake nabugabo is also consistent with differential mortality between wetland and exposed habitats that may reﬂect intensive size-selective ﬁshing pressure on nile perch. although the cpue of nile perch was similar across inshore habitats in 2007, the size distribution differed. in 2007, there was a greater proportion of large nile perch in v. cuspidata relative to m. violaceum and exposed habitats. for ﬁshes, inter-habitat variation in size structure is often due to ontogenetic habitat shifts (werner & gilliam 1984; lecchini & galzin 2005); however, nile perch in lake nabugabo are not known to undergo ontogenetic habitat shifts within the size range sampled in our experimental gill nets (schoﬁeld & chapman 1999). the most parsimonious explana- tion for variation in size distribution across habitats is the top-down effects of size-selective predation on the nile perch. gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 3.5 to 8 inches (approximately 10–85 cm tl) are the dominant ﬁshing gear, followed by long-lines (hook size 7–12) that supplement yield by harvesting 389 paterson & chapman larger-sized ﬁsh (up to 120 cm tl) in the offshore waters (mbabazi 2006). the mean body size of nile perch has declined over the past few decades in lake nabugabo, and the decline in body size has been habitat speciﬁc. in 1991–1992, ogutu-ohwayo (1993) used gill net ﬂeets that ranged up to 305 mm stretched mesh to capture nile perch in lake nabugabo; 26% of the nile perch he reported in his diet analysis were >40 cm tl, and 9% were >60 cm tl. in 1998, chapman and colleagues sampled four of the locations used in ogutu-ohwayo’s study using the same range of mesh sizes; the nile perch captured were small, averaging 22.5 cm tl and not exceeding 39 cm. a ﬁsheries stock assessment in 2006 revealed that the mean size of nile perch harvested in lake nabugabo at that time was 25 cm tl in gill nets (range 11– 74 cm tl) (mbabazi 2006). between 1995 and 2007, the mean size of nile perch in our experimental gill nets declined, reﬂecting a decrease in the proportion of the larger size classes, a pattern most pronounced in exposed habitats. our results suggest that ﬁshing is cropping off large-sized individuals and is doing so more effectively in exposed habitats relative to enclosed wetlands. this could be associated with differences in behaviour of ﬁshes and catchability of nile perch in gill nets across habitats; however, this would require more empirical studies to conﬁrm. in lake nabugabo, the advantage of occupying wetland ecotones may be twofold for nile perch – they may provide optimal prey and refuge from ﬁshers, although we do not have direct evidence that nile perch ‘prefer’ v. cuspidata ecotones. fish using open waters, if more vulnerable to effects of size-selective predation, could exhibit phenotypic responses to ﬁshing pressure more rapidly than those in wetland ecotones (e.g., smaller size, lower growth rate). if nile perch inhabiting v. cuspidata experience lower mor- tality; this may ultimately select for a more wetland resistant nile perch. over the past few years, there have been increasing numbers of juvenile nile perch found within v. cuspidata (this study) and even within dense stands of more hypoxic m. violaceum (chap- man, paterson, twinomugisha, unpublished data). small nile perch (<7.0 cm tl) captured in hypoxic wetlands within nabugabo exhibit a larger gill size than conspeciﬁcs captured in open water sites (paterson 2009), suggesting morphological divergence in the small juveniles that may facilitate increased exploitation of hypoxic habitats. the extent to which habitat characteristics inﬂuence nile perch phenotypes in this system will depend, at least to some degree, on the amount of time that is spent in wetlands and exposed ecotones and the strength of divergent selection pressures between the habitats. a shift in habitat use of the nile perch may reﬂect a range shift in individuals and ⁄ or a shift in the 390 time that individuals spend in different habitats. whether the home range of nile perch has shifted or not remains unknown. however, we believe that the small juvenile nile perch may be site tenacious given the ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant difference in gill morphol- ogy between juvenile nile perch from wetland and exposed sites (paterson 2009). larger nile perch are likely to have a larger home range than the juveniles and may move between wetland and exposed eco- tones. movement studies on individual nile perch will need to be done in order to better understand the home range patterns for nile perch in this system and to better predict the extent to which habitat characteris- tics will drive phenotypic patterns in this species. however, if nile perch are subject to higher ﬁshing pressure in open waters, selection for more wetland- resistant perch may occur if individuals either move routinely into wetland ecotones or inhabit wetlands ecotones. lake nabugabo: lessons learned changes in the size and distribution of nile perch in lake nabugabo may reﬂect the interaction of both ﬁshing pressure and shifts in macrophyte distribution; both drivers also seem relevant to changes that have occurred in the much larger lake victoria. however, one fundamental difference in the environmental trajectories of the two lakes is the extent of culturally induced eutrophication in lake victoria, a bottom-up driver not as evident in lake nabugabo. in lake victoria, eutrophication over the past several decades is apparent from the increase in nutrients (hecky 1993; verschuren et al. 2002), a shift from a system dominated by diatoms in the 1980s to cyanobacteria (verschuren et al. 2002), and increases in the depth and extent of the anoxic bottom layer (hecky 1993; hecky et al. 1994). kolding et al. (2008) argue that eutrophication is primarily responsible for the observed trends in nile perch stocks – increased eutrophication resulted in an increase in biological production and the yield of nile perch. based on experimental trawl data taken from offshore waters in tanzania and uganda at different depth intervals, kolding et al. (2008) found no evidence for overﬁsh- ing based on a set of veriﬁable indicators. for example, in tanzania, there were declines in length indices at all depths that one might think is due to overﬁshing. however, kolding et al. (2008) found that the cpue<40 cm (portion of the population unexploited by commercial ﬁsheries) remained stable or increased and cpue>40 cm (commercially exploited) remained relatively stable at all depths, suggesting that declines in length were due to an increase in the proportion of juveniles and not a decline in large spawners. in addition, they identiﬁed patterns of annual and of nile (2008) vertical migration seasonal perch (cpue>40 cm) that they attributed to anoxia along the bottom layer. both the high recruitment of juveniles and temporal variation in cpue>40 cm with depth was attributed to eutrophication supporting survival of offspring in the former and controlling habitat avail- ability (i.e., depth of the anoxic bottom layer) in the latter. other recent studies suggest that there has been an inﬂuence of ﬁshing pressure on the nile perch population, at least locally. njiru et al. (2006) quan- tiﬁed the cpue of nile perch in depths up to 20 m between 1998–2000 and 2004–2005 in nyanza gulf (kenya) using bottom trawl data. they reported no change in the proportion of ﬁsh <50 cm between sampling periods; however, they found a decrease in the asymptotic length, size at maturity and maximum age over the same time frame and an increase in both total and ﬁsh mortality. based on the length frequency distribution of nile perch captured by commercial trawlers (12,539 trawling hours) in speke gulf of (tanzania), goudswaard et al. reported a decline in the catch rate of nile perch >35 cm tl and an increase in the catch rate nile perch <35 cm tl. they suggest that ﬁshing may have caused the reduction in the numbers of large nile perch; whereas the increase in the small nile perch may reﬂect growth of recruits born in the area after the initial invasion and reduced predation pressure by large nile perch as their densities declined. as in lake victoria, lake nabugabo experienced faunal collapse following the expansion of the introduced nile perch population (ogutu-ohwayo 1993; chapman et al. 1996a,b) and faunal resurgence coincident with intensive ﬁshing of nile perch (chapman et al. 2003). although there is evidence that lake nabugabo has eutrophied over the past century (cangelosi 1998), the lake has not experi- enced the dramatic increases in primary production, hypoxia, cyanobacteria blooms or the invasion of water hyacinth that characterises the recent history of lake victoria. yet, our results suggest that intense ﬁshing has coincided with phenotypic change in the nile perch. for lake victoria, unless studies can isolate eutrophication as a driving force, it may be prudent for managers to assume that both ﬁshing pressure inﬂuencing the ﬁshery. and eutrophication are the fundamental management goal in the lake victoria basin is to establish a sustainable nile perch ﬁshery while conserving native species (unencia 2001), and much effort has gone into model devel- opment to predict effects of ﬁshing on the food-web and the ﬁshery (kitchell et al. 1997; schindler et al. 1998; matsuishi et al. 2006). for example, matsuishi et al. (2006) used ecopath and ecosim to model the trophic dynamics of important ﬁshes in lake ecological change in nile perch victoria over a 10-year period given elevated levels of ﬁshing pressure. they categorized nile perch £ 40 cm tl as juveniles, based on this as the size at which nile perch becomes piscivorous. however, ontogenetic shifts in nile perch can be very dynamic as evidenced in lake nabugabo over the past 12 years and more generally in lakes where nile perch have been introduced. ogutu-ohwayo (1994) compared the relative prey importance for nile perch across 20-cm size classes between systems where nile perch were native or introduced. the author found that when haplochromines were rare, nile perch fed more on invertebrates and larger numbers of small pelagic species and had similar diet, growth rate and condi- tion as nile perch in native lakes. on a diet dominated by haplochromines, early in the invasion process, the growth rate and condition of nile perch were relatively high (ogutu-ohwayo 1994, 1999). in lake nabugabo, the size at which nile perch shift from feeding on invertebrates to ﬁshes has also varied with the stage of the invasion process. nile perch were primarily insectivorous until 30 cm tl when haplo- chromines were rare, but shifted to a haplochromine- dominated diet as cichlids recovered, and now exhibit a much smaller size at shift to piscivory. in general, in lakes where nile perch have been introduced, the relative size of the dietary shift to piscivory is very low when haplochromines are abundant (ogutu- ohwayo 2004) or resurging (chapman et al. 2003; this study), but the dietary shift occurs at a much larger size when haplochromines are rare (ogutu- ohwayo 1993, 1994; schoﬁeld & chapman 1999; katunzi et al. 2006). this has important implications for predicting the outcome of nile perch invasions and cascading effects to native species under different management regimes. predation rates may be higher than predicted under scenarios deﬁned by available models. conclusions this study highlights the need to understand more about the ecology of nile perch, its interaction with other species, and their dynamics in response to ﬁshing pressure and other environmental changes. currently, ﬁsheries managers acknowledge the power of the top-down effects of ﬁshing on food-webs, speciﬁcally how different management strategies will impact nile perch and native prey. models of pred- ator–prey dynamics in the system should account for adaptive responses of aquatic systems to environmen- tal change including shifts in nile perch behaviour, habitat choice and life-history traits. as previously acknowledged, the nile perch is a moving target that will demand adaptive management of both native and introduced ﬁsh stocks in the lake victoria basin; 391 paterson & chapman strategies should evolve with the system (kaufman & schwartz 1992; kaufman et al. 1997). lake nabugabo has been a useful model for understanding change in lake victoria by controlling for effects of severe eutrophication and hypolimnetic anoxia, and in revealing potential refuge habitats (v. cuspidata) that may potentially stabilise the interaction between predator and prey, depending on the ecological and evolutionary response of both. acknowledgements permission for this project was granted by the uganda national
