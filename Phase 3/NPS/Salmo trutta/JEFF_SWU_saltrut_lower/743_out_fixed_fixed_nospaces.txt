(1994) challenged what they termed the restricted movement paradigm (gerking 1959). except long-range seasonal movement (i.e., 100s to 1000s of m) to spawning or overwintering areas, the propensity for local move- ment (i.e., <100 m) seems highly variable among res- ident stream salmonines (gowan & fausch 1996; hughes 2000; knouft & spotila 2002; rodriguez 2002), anadromous salmonines (kahler et al. 2001; steingrimsson & grant 2003) and potadromous stocks (meka et al. 2003). further, populations may be structured to include stationary and mobile indi- viduals (rodriguez 2002), or span a range of individ- ual propensities for movement (gurarie et al. 2009). numerous studies provide descriptions of salmonid movement behaviour (burrell et al. 2000; bridger et al. 2001; baldwin et al. 2002; meka et al. 2003; pepino et al. 2012) and habitat selection (e.g., tyler & rose 1994; railsback et al. 1999), but limited research has been conducted to empirically link observed movement behaviour to explanatory factors that allow the prediction of movement rates. gowan and fausch (2002) used optimal foraging theory to predict habitat-unit (i.e., pool, riffle, run) and reach- scale (250 m) spatial distributions of brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis and exclosure studies to measure individual fish movement responses when access to foraging positions was experimentally manipulated. gowan and fausch (2002) concluded that brook_trout move during summertime to both monitor habitat conditions at a local scale (100s of m) and gain access to optimal foraging locations in the face of temporal variability in foraging conditions. although informative and applicable for reach-scale models in small streams, using their approach to predict the movement and spatial distribution of fish throughout the entire length of a stream or a watershed would correspondence: daniel b. hayes, michigan state university, 480 wilson road, room 334c natural resources building, department of fisheries

581 hayes & thompson require velocity and invertebrate drift profiles at a fine spatial and temporal scale for ranking all poten- tial feeding positions, a data need that would gener- ally be infeasible. using a different approach, belanger and rodriguez (2002) developed a dynamic turnover model with cap- ture–recapture data for brook_trout and atlantic sal- mon salmo_salar within 90-m reaches. in their model, they related change in abundance to habitat-specific (i.e., pool, riffle, glide) net immigration and loss rates in an effort to provide an integrated assessment of habitat quality as perceived by the fish. in general, their results suggest that an individual’s probability of departure from a given channel unit did not depend strongly on channel unit type, yet immigration was ordered as expected on the basis of known habitat preferences for brook_trout (i.e., pools > glides > rif- fles) and atlantic salmon (i.e., riffles > glides > pools). despite being unable to detect a relationship between departure rate and channel unit type in their study, this approach seems more feasible for studying salmonid movement behaviour at larger spatial scales (e.g., longer stream reaches or entire stream lengths) because habitat data requirements for the model are coarser (i.e., channel unit) relative to those for gowan & fausch’s (2002) optimal foraging model. a major limitation to the belanger and rodriguez (2002) turn- over model, however, is that immigration is treated as a fixed number of individuals per unit time. because of this, their structure does not allow for dynamic connec- tions among adjacent channel units and therefore is prob- lematic for extension into a larger dynamic model. individual-based models of fish populations have seen increasing use since early applications of this approach (e.g., huston et al. 1988), and some authors have argued that these models provide the best means currently available for connecting fish population dynamics to habitat conditions (e.g., hayes et al. 2009). this class of models readily incorporate the models and results of studies such as gowan and fausch (2002) and belanger and rodriguez (2002) by focusing on pro- cesses affecting the distribution of fishes. individual- based models tend to be very ‘data hungry’, however, and a major challenge in implementing such models is estimating parameters directly from field data. the goal of this study was to develop and test a suite of individual-based models fitting behavioural rules to empirical data, allowing for a quantitative description of movement dynamics. we apply this modelling approach to observations on juvenile steel- head dispersal (hereafter referred to as movement) across a series of 19 experimental large-scale (i.e., 1–2 km) field studies with batch-marked age 1 steel- head that were translocated within a michigan watershed. our modelling approach is similar in concept to that of belanger and rodriguez (2002) 582 and a recent conceptual synthesis by mcmahon and matter (2006), but extends these concepts into a more fully dynamic model amenable to statistical estima- tion and model selection procedures. the suite of hypotheses we evaluated included: h1: the daily probability of a fish emigrating from a channel unit, p(move), is constant and equal for all individuals regardless of the channel unit type or the density of fish in the channel unit. we refer to this hypothesis as the fixed movement rate hypothesis. h2: p(move) is dependent upon the type of channel unit. according to this hypothesis, p(move) is the same for all individuals within a channel unit type, but can vary among channel unit types. we refer to this hypothesis as the habitat-dependent hypothesis. h3: p(move) is an increasing function of the den- sity of steelhead in a given channel unit. we refer to this model as the density-dependent hypothesis. h4: p(move) varies with both the channel unit type and the density of steelhead. we refer to this as the interaction hypothesis. a fundamental concept to these hypotheses and the models we develop is that the daily probability of departing a habitat unit within a given time period, which we denote as p(move), is a function of envi- ronmental conditions including fish density. this concept is shared in common to the model synthesis described by mcmahon and matter (2006) as well as models described by other researchers (e.g., rails- back et al. 1999; humston et al. 2004). methods study area the pine river, a tributary to the au sable river and lake huron, drains a 756 km2 watershed located in the north-eastern part of michigan’s lower peninsula (fig. 1). the pine river stream network is composed of four main subwatersheds: east branch, south branch, west branch and van etten creek. these tributaries vary from third to fourth order at our exper- imental sites (table 1). the pine river is a groundwa- ter dominated stream system that experiences relatively stable flows throughout the year. within a given branch, physical habitat variables including water depth, stream width and substrate size vary by channel unit habitat types (table 2; thompson 2004). across the watershed, pool habitat units averaged 16.5 m, riffles 19.1 m and runs 22.0 m in length. the pine river contains at least 40 species of fish (thomas 2001). the stream network upstream of the confluence of the south and main branches is dominated by cold- water species including naturalised juvenile steelhead and brown_trout salmo_trutta, brook_trout, mottled sculpin cottus bairdii and northern brook lamprey steelhead movement modelling fig. 1. location of the pine river watershed within michigan and movement study site locations. main branch designation

diverse with high abundances of several darters species (etheostoma and percina sp.) and cyprinidae species (thomas 2001). field experiment design a total of 19 field experiments were conducted from may to august in 2000, 2001 and 2002 (table 1). study reaches ranged in length from 975 to 2387 m and were distributed widely in the pine river watershed (fig. 1). for each experiment, we visually delineated the boundaries of all channel units within reach. the study reach and classified each as a pool, riffle, or run using criteria described by simonson et al. (1993) and thomas (2001). surface area of each channel unit was estimated by measuring length and width. in 14 of the 19 experiments, we translocated age- 1 juvenile steelhead into a single channel unit located in the longitudinal centre of the experimen- tal in the five experiments conducted in 2002, one half of the fish were translocated into each of the reach. all translocated fish were given an experi- ment-specific fin clip for subsequent identification. two adjacent units in the centre of 583 hayes & thompson table 1. branch, site, translocation date (month/day/year), reach length (m), number of fish translocated and number of batch-marked juvenile steelhead collected per recapture event (1st, 2nd and 3rd recapture events) for movement experiments conducted from 2000 to 2002. numbers in parentheses are the number of days following translocation for a given recapture event. experiment branch site translocation date reach length (m) number of fish translocated 1st 2nd 3rd recaps per sampling event (days post-trans) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 east east east main main south south south south south south south south south south van etten west west west a b b c d e e e f f f f f f g h i i j 7/18/2000 7/20/2001 8/5/2002 7/16/2001 5/20/2002 6/20/2000 6/23/2000 7/10/2001 6/15/2000 6/15/2000 6/19/2000 6/22/2000 5/20/2002 7/29/2002 7/24/2001 7/17/2000 6/14/2002 8/6/2002 7/10/2001 1830 1673 1891 1556 883 1487 1487 2387 975 975 1138 1222 1136 1136 1838 1091 1213 1213 1529 175 96 100 104 102 100 143 113 78 79 205 154 100 69 109 133 44 104 83 65 (3) 19 (3) 38 (3) 10 (3) 8 (4) 45 (3) 75 (5) 32 (6) 31 (4) 42 (4) 94 (3) 75 (5) 35 (3) 31 (3) 58 (1) 59 (3) 17 (3) 35 (3) 17 (3) 34 (7) 22 (6) 21 (10) 4 (8) 25 (3) 28 (7) 8 (7) 18 (6) all fish used in these experiments were wild steel- head captured within the study reach or another site in the pine river watershed using tow-barge elec- trofishing. use of steelhead collected outside of the study reach was limited to sites (main branch and van etten creek) where we were unable to collect enough individuals (50 or more) needed to conduct an experiment. within 1 week of translocation, we used single pass, tow-barge electrofishing to determine the spatial distribution of the marked and resident steelhead. the upstream and downstream extent of the reach was determined adaptively. test shocking was conducted approximately 500 m downstream of the translocation channel unit(s). if marked fish were captured, we restarted further downstream to insure that a buffer of habitat without marked fish was present on the down- stream extent of the study reach. the entire reach was then sampled one channel unit at a time in an upstream direction until a minimum of 200 m were sampled without capturing a marked fish. the total number of marked and resident steelhead was recorded separately for each channel unit. we con- ducted a second recapture sampling for seven of the 19 experiments 3 or 4 days after the initial sampling event and a third recapture event in one experiment to provide additional recapture observations and to moni- tor dispersal behaviour over a longer time period. because catches were based on a single electrofish- ing pass where catchability (q) was <100%, we con- ducted multiple depletion sampling to estimate q for juvenile steelhead in an electrofishing pass 584 approximately 100-m section located near the centre of the experimental reach on the day of the first recapture event for eight of 19 experiments. the 100- m reach was block netted at each end and contained a minimum of two units of each channel unit type. based on the eight depletion experiments, we esti- mated the average q (seber 1982; gould & pollock 1997) for pools, riffles and runs as 0.47, 0.58 and 0.48, respectively. we calculated combined density of marked and unmarked steelhead for each channel unit in all the 19 experiments according to the fol- lowing equation: densityunit ¼   (1) =areaunit   1  qtype þ 1 qtype clippedunit unclippedunit where unit = channel unit number, clipped = number of clipped steelhead captured in unit during the recapture pass, unclipped = the number of unclipped steelhead captured in unit during the first recapture pass, area = surface area (ha) of unit and type refers to the channel unit type. modelling approach we constructed a set of individual-based, spatially explicit models in c++ to simulate the distribution of marked steelhead on a daily time step and infer movement behaviour rules. inputs to the models were the observed spatial distribution of marked fish on table 2. mean width (m), mean depth (cm) and mean substrate size by channel unit type and branch for the east branch, south branch, west branch, main branch and van etten creek in the pine river watershed. substrate size was characterised by performing a pebble count using a modified wentworth classification across cross-channel transects. a total of 50 substrate particles were measured at each transect. numbers within parentheses indicate the number of transects per branch and channel unit type. mean depth (cm) mean width (m) mean substrate (modified wentworth scale)† east south west main van etten creek east south west main van etten creek east south pool riffle run 46.6 (22) 40.9 (46) 37.5 (29) 39.4 (22) 36.7 (16) 6.8 (22) 9.7 (46) 8.5 (29) 13.7 (22) 5.3 (16) 5.4 (22) 7.2 (46) 26.9 (56) 22.6 (42) 15.5 (42) 27.4 (20) 13.2 (6) 7.2 (56) 8.4 (42) 7.6 (42) 14.1 (20) 4.9 (6) 6.5 (56) 7.1 (42) 34.1 (53) 28.3 (86) 21.8 (71) 35.6 (44) 23.0 (15) 6.9 (53) 8.2 (86) 7.3 (71) 14.7 (44) 4.6 (15) 5.6 (53) 6.9 (86) west main van etten creek 5.8 (29) 5.0 (22) 3.9 (16) 7.4 (42) 6.7 (20) 6.0 (6) 6.6 (71) 4.7 (44) 3.7 (15) †1 = clay;

flexible parameters and n= the total number of tagged steelhead recaptured over all sampling events per experiment. we summed the maximum lð^hþ over all experiments (quinn & deriso 1999) to compute a single lð^hþ for each of the four model types. this summation procedure allowed us to incorporate the information from all experiments into a single statistic. based on the aicc for each model, we also computed akaike weights (wr) and evidence ratios according to burnham and anderson (2002): p4 wr ¼ expð 0:5drþ expð 0:5drþ r¼1 (8) where dr = aiccr - aiccmin, r indexes the four models, min is the model estimated to be best, i = the model with the highest akaike weight and j indexes the remaining three models. steelhead movement modelling results field experiments an average of 110 (range 44 to 205) steelhead was translocated in each experiment (table 1), resulting in a wide range of initial density in the unit(s) of  1, range 1350–13,292 translocation (mean 4883 ha  1). the percentage of ha translocated individuals recaptured on the first sampling event ranged from 8% to 53% (mean 37%). the number of recaptures declined for successive recapture events in all but one experiment (table 1), indicating continual dispersal out of the experimental reach or mortality over time. optimised p(move) rules parameter estimates for p(move) in the fixed model ranged from 0.43 to 0.87 (table 3) and averaged 0.70 (se = 0.03, n = 19 experiments). estimates for the probability of an individual moving at least one channel unit per day regardless of habitat type and fish density were >0.60 in 16 experiments and ≥0.70 in 14 experiments (table 3). similar to the fixed model, estimates for p(pools), p(riffles) and p(runs) were high over all experiments for the habitat-dependent model (table 3). mean p (move) for specific habitat types indicated that the daily probability of departing from a pool (0.75, se = 0.03) was greater than in runs (0.73, se = 0.05) and riffles (0.68, se = 0.04). intercept estimates (b) for the density-dependent model averaged 0.67 (se = 0.04) and were >0.5 in sixteen of nineteen experiments (table 3), indicating a high daily probability of movement at a density of  1 regardless of channel unit type. esti- 0 steelhead ha mates of the parameter a were consistently low but all were negative and averaged  0.00017 (se = 0.00006, table 3). because of the influence of the parameter in the equation, the negative slope indi- cated that the probability of movement increased with increasing steelhead density. intercept and slope parameter estimates for the interaction model varied greatly both among channel unit types within an experiment and within a channel unit type among experiments (table 3). as an exam- ple, optimised estimates of the intercept for pools (bp) ranged from 0.0 to 0.97 between experiments (table 3). the mean intercept (0.67, se = 0.06) was generally higher than for both riffles (0.59, se = 0.08) and pools (0.45, se = 0.06), while ( 0.00011, se = the mean pools for 0.000051) was ( 0.000087, se = 0.000051) and runs ( 0.000044, se = 0.000011), suggesting stronger density depen- dence in riffles. riffles than higher slope

between goodness of fit and model complexity based on our experiments. although the interaction model had the highestlð^hþ, it also contained the greatest number of p(move) parameters (table 4). the mar- ginal increase in model fit, as indicated bylð^hþ, was not substantial enough to offset the penalty assessed in the calculation of the aicc for the additional parameters this model contained relative to the habi- tat-dependent model. likelihood was lower and aicc higher for the density-dependent model relative to the interaction and habitat-dependent models (table 4), indicating lesser support for the purely density-depen- dent model. the fixed model had the lowestlð^hþ, highest aicc and lowest wi (table 4), indicating the least support for this as a model of steelhead move- ment behaviour in our experiments. 589 hayes & thompson discussion conceptual basis of modelling and model implementation although fish movement has been studied exten- sively for many fish species in numerous habitats, most studies have been descriptive in nature, lacking a dynamical modelling basis. although there have been a number of valuable conceptual and theoretical models of fish movement (e.g., railsback et al. 1999; skalski & gilliam 2003; railsback & harvey 2011; pepino et al. 2012), fitting these models to field data has rarely been accomplished. in this study, we illus- trate a model that bridges the gap between these two realms, linking a dynamic model of stream fish movement with empirical data on movement in a nat- ural setting. the modelling approach we used allowed us to formally infer movement behaviour rules for individual age-1 juvenile steelhead and test multiple possible mechanisms governing movement behaviour hypotheses. although the models we fit were relatively simple, the process could be used to fit and test more sophisticated models in a variety of field experimental settings. is a useful approach, conceptually we agree with belanger and rodri- guez (2002) that evaluating habitat quality by exam- ining behavioural processes provides a more reliable mechanistic approach for understanding habitat selec- tion than do traditional approaches based on density– quality relationships. furthermore, although we believe the belanger and rodriguez (2002) turnover model the individual-based model we present in this study provides several major improvements in model design that we believe more accurately reflect the current understanding of move- ment behaviour of stream-dwelling salmonids. most importantly, our individual-based model structure specifies that immigration into a given habitat unit is dependent upon departure from adjacent habitat units rather than treating immigration as a fixed number of individuals per day as in the belanger and rodriguez (2002) turnover model. this subtle structural detail is important because it allows for dynamic connections among habitat units within larger reaches. another important structural difference of our model relative to the turnover model is that our model allows fish to move multiple habitat units per day by potentially iterating the movement process multiple times within a day. the turnover model, however, limits daily movement to one adjacent habitat unit per time unit. compared with the previous fish movement stud- ies, we developed model structures with relatively few parameters. numerous models have been pro- posed for animal movement, many of which include additional factors such as fish size, sex and age, as 590 well as individual variation in movement propensity among individuals (e.g., skalski & gilliam 2003; gurarie et al. 2009). although these models are very appealing and could provide valuable insights, our approach of using batch-marked fish did not allow us to determine the behaviour of individual fish. as such, the parameters for more complex models are generally not estimable with the type of field experi- ments we were able to conduct. alternative field methods using individually recognisable tags or telemetry could provide data sufficient to support such models. our experience, however, suggests that large numbers of individuals (e.g., >100) may need to be marked and relocated to provide robust para- meter estimates. a challenge facing fish ecologists is the choice of the temporal and spatial scale at which the research problem is formulated, and data are collected and analysed. in this research, we conceptualised the problem at a broad spatial scale as we were interested in habitat selection across stream reaches in the 10s of km in length. while models of microhabitat scale habitat selection have proven useful (e.g., hughes 1992; fausch 1993), the data requirements for apply- ing such models to large reaches would generally be infeasible. moreover, conditions at the microhabitat scale, particularly water velocity, change rapidly with changes in river stage, implying the need for tempo- rally intensive sampling as well. geomorphic units are temporally more stable entities, and in a relative sense, the ranking of conditions between units is less sensitive to stream stage (i.e., water velocity in pools is less than in riffles across stream stage). field experiments the translocation experiments we conducted allowed us to develop models and test competing hypotheses in natural environmental conditions (e.g., stream dis- charge and temperature), with wild fish in unconfined natural stream reaches, and in the presence of natu- rally occurring abundances of interspecific competi- tors and predators. mcmahon and matter (2006) provide a useful summary of possible experimental designs for understanding fish movement, and our design builds upon this base. in particular, our design of placing a high density of fish at a central location mirrors a design they describe where fish are removed from an experimental reach. one advantage of creating a high-density situation is that this creates contrast thereby allowing for better statistical estimation of the influ- ence of density on movement behaviour. by design, translocation produced a gradient in density among channel units and therefore created a contrast for evaluating the response of steelhead movement time and space, in density over behaviour to steelhead density. one of our main research questions was to determine how fish respond to densities higher than we typically observed in this stream. put another way, we were interested in why do not fish occur at very high density in ‘choice’ locations. although qualitatively the answer seems obvious – they move out of high-density areas, our modelling goal was to determine this quantitatively. duration of the density gradient in unconfined exper- iments, however, is dependent upon the rate of dis- persal. translocation is also the only way to directly observe fish movement behaviour in locations within the watershed with a natural absence or very low density of the species of interest. although we were able to conduct our experiments within natural habitats, there are some concerns whether the estimates of p(move) reflect the move- ment behaviour of a completely undisturbed system. the process of capturing fish via electrofishing, marking them and translocating them away from their point of capture has the potential to alter their move- ment behaviour. further, the relatively short duration of our experiments did not allow substantial recovery time following this process. in pilot experiments not included in this analysis, we attempted to maintain large enclosures in the stream for several days by placing block nets at the head and tail of stream reaches spanning several habitat units. these attempts to lengthen the recovery period were not successful due to debris fouling and damage to the nets by bea- ver and muskrat. experience with individually marked fish in other parts of the watershed to deter- mine growth (thompson 2004) also demonstrated high degree of mobility for individuals, at recapture intervals ranging from days to several months. comparison of p(move) with other studies due to a paucity of similar published studies contain- ing parameter estimates of p(move) for steelhead or other salmonids, we were only able to directly com- pare our estimates to loss rates (k), the equivalent of our p(move), reported for brook_trout and juvenile atlantic salmon in belanger and rodriguez (2002). interestingly, estimates of p(move) for age-1 steel- head in our study (e.g., mean p(move) = 0.7 for the fixed model) were similar to estimates of brook_trout (range = 0.361–0.750) salmon (range = 0.605–0.883) loss rates (belanger & rodri- guez 2002). this occurred despite differences in the structure of models used to estimate departure rates, differences in species studied, habitat differences between the two study areas (i.e., lower peninsula michigan, usa, and eastern quebec, canada), as well as the differences in experimental treatments we applied. age-1 steelhead in our study showed similar atlantic and steelhead movement modelling habitat preference (riffles > runs (glides in belanger & rodriguez 2002) > pools) to atlantic salmon and dissimilar preference compared with brook_trout (bel- anger & rodriguez 2002) if habitat-specific departure rates (i.e., p(move) and k) indicate ranking of habitat quality and preference. although studies providing estimates directly com- parable to our p(move) parameter are rare, many studies have been conducted that have examined the movement behaviour of salmonids. across these studies, a wide array of behaviours has been observed, ranging from limited movement to popula- tions exhibiting high mobility (e.g., gowan et al. 1994; gowan & fausch 1996). a few examples highlight the diversity of behaviours observed. at the lower end of population mobility, harvey et al. (1999) found that 70–80% of coastal cutthroat trout onchorhynchus clarki with radiotelemeters were found within the same geomorphic unit one to two months after release during the autumn and winter. further, high site fidelity was observed despite a sub- stantial flood that occurred during the study. in the same stream, harvey (1998) found that roughly 30% of fish tagged in july were recaptured at the same site in november, implying relatively low rates of movement. his study also found, however, that over time up to 90% of fish residing at a site were immi- grants. an example of salmonids showing rapid move- ment is found in a study by adams et al. (2000) who found that 20–50% of brook_trout marked in a sec- tion remained there over the short term, but 20–25% of fish moved more than 200–500 metres, and some fish moved 400–600 metres in 1 day or less. interpretation of model selection results example, following burnham and anderson (2002), we treat our four models as variations on a theme with the interaction model being the theme and considered the full model. the remaining three models we offer as reduced versions of the full model that differ from the full model by having intercepts and slope parameters constrained. for the habitat-dependent model can be thought of as the full model with slope terms (ap, ari and aru) all constrained to equal zero. the density-dependent model is the full model with all the slope terms constrained to be equal to each another and intercept terms (bp, bri and bru) con- strained to be equal. finally, the fixed model can be viewed as the full model where all slopes terms are constrained to equal zero and all terms constrained to equal each other. additional reduced versions of our full model could be created by con- straining subsets of the slope and intercept terms. we chose to limit our reduced model list to the three ver- intercept 591 hayes & thompson sions described above to avoid simply running all pos- sible permutations without a biological basis. our results indicated highest support for the habitat-depen- dent model, with much lower support for the other models/hypotheses evaluated. even though we did not develop an a priori prior and formally conduct a bayesian analysis (hilborn & mangel 1997), we sug- gest that future analyses may profit from such an approach. there is a substantial body of literature pro- viding evidence for both juvenile steelhead habitat preference (everest & chapman 1972; bisson et al. 1988; fausch 1993; roper et al. 1994) and density- dependent regulation of resource allocation (keeley 2001), and this information could provide an informa- tive prior that could be used to guide model fitting. conclusions the modelling approach and ideas presented in this study illustrate a new approach for inferring departure rates and testing competing hypotheses concerning the relative importance of habitat type and density dependence on the process of fish movement behav- iour decision-making. our experimental recapture data of marked age-1 steelhead suggest greatest sup- port for a habitat-dependent model, with a high dis- persal juvenile steelhead. interpretation of these movement probabili- ties confirms that age-1 steelhead are highly mobile, capable of moving relatively long distances (100s of m) in a matter of days. following translocation for rate acknowledgements we thank d. thomas, j. gabbard, j.
