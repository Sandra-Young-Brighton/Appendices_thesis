environmental factors; freshwater; independent contrasts; macroecology introduction the study of predictable patterns of morphological variation across environmental space is central to evo- lutionary ecology (griffiths 2013). one of the patterns noticed in different groups of animals – including both endotherms and ectotherms – is that of increas- ing species body size with increasing latitude (see for a review blackburn et al. 1999; pincheira-donoso 2010; meiri 2011; olalla-tarraga 2011). the decre- ase in size of endotherm or ectotherm species may be driven by temperature (e.g. for ectotherms, the tem- perature hypothesis; kozłowski et al. 2004) or by other factors (e.g. energy availability, interspecific competition, migration ability, among others) than temperature itself (teplitsky & millien 2014). until now, the underlying mechanisms behind the latitudi- nal distribution of body size are still highly debated (shelomi 2012; teplitsky & millien 2014), and few large scale, explicit tests of the mechanical hypotheses at the origin of this observed phenomenon have been carried out. freshwater teleosteans have long been considered one of the rare groups of ectotherms that shows a correspondence: philippe gaubert, institut des sciences de l’evolution de montpellier – um2-cnrs-ird 226, universite montpellier 2, place eugene bataillon – cc 64, 34095 montpellier cedex 05, france. e-mail: philippe.gaubert@univ-montp2.fr doi: 10.1111/eff.12196 125 denys et al. sizes conditions and range clear pattern of size increase ‘from the equator towards the pole’ (knouft 2004; blanchet et al. 2010). however, the taxonomic scale at which this pattern applies is controversial (blanck & lamouroux 2007). the cyprinidae constitute the largest freshwa- ter teleostean family, with almost 300 genera and 2600 species occupying eurasia, africa and north america; they span a wide spectrum of environmen- tal (nelson 2006). because of their dramatic variation in body size – a 250-fold amplitude between danionella (1 cm) and catlocarpio (2.5 m) – and their wide distribution, they represent ideal candidates to test environment– body size relationships. here, we use a genus-level supertree of cyprinidae (gaubert et al. 2009) to test which key environmental factors may have signifi- cantly shaped the distribution of body size within this large family of ectotherms (see lindsey 1966), and at which taxonomic levels those environmental factors act. as trait variation across species results from both environmental and historical forces (taylor & gotelli 1994), to use a phylogenetic framework to control for the effects of phylogenetic constraints or conservatism on geographical body size patterns (diniz-filho & bini 2008; escarguel et al. 2008; algar et al. 2009). furthermore, fixing a taxonomic scale defined by a phylogenetic tree allows testing at which taxonomic scales the environ- ment – body size interactions are actually acting (cruz et al. 2005). it appears relevant predictability (environmental our results will be discussed in view of a series of mechanistic hypotheses that may explain geographical body size patterns in freshwater teleosteans: (i) a lar- ger size at maturation is achieved at lower temperature (temperature hypothesis; kozłowski et al. 2004), (ii) large-bodied species are favoured in seasonal environ- ments of higher latitudes because they metabolise fat stores at lower weight-specific rates than smaller species hypothesis; rodrıguez et al. 2008) or during periods of resource abundance larger animals can maximise their growth and increase body size to survive periods of resource shortages (the seasonality hypothesis; boyce 1979), (iii) small low latitudes because of their inability to disperse into high lati- tudes, notably after the last pleistocene glaciations (migration ability hypothesis; blackburn et al. 1999), (iv) energy availability acts positively on body size as large body size must be maintained by an important food supply (primary productivity hypothesis; rosen- zweig 1968; olalla-tarraga et al. 2006), (v) increased interspecific competition for resources can favour the coexistence of smaller species (competitive inter- action hypothesis; ashton et al. 2000), (vi) larger hab- itats (i.e. for riverine fishes, the size of the drainage basin; oberdorff et al. 1995) are needed to maintain taxa are predominant at 126 populations of larger sized species (habitat availability hypothesis; hawkins & diniz-filho 2006). material and methods leaves equivalent our selection of taxa relied on a genus-level supertree of cyprinidae (gaubert et al. 2009), to date the most exhaustive phylogeny available for the family. the supertree has terminal to genus- level taxa. when genera were not monophyletic, they were split into several species-level taxa, so the su- pertree has more ‘genus-level’ taxa (leaves) than the number of genera traditionally considered for cyprin- idae. we also adjusted recent taxonomic changes (e.g. synonymy) using fishbase (froese & pauly 2012). we assembled a data set of one dependent variable (body size) and seven environmental (predictor) fac- tors for 364 genus-level terminal taxa for which the data were complete in 530 river drainage basins (table s1). maximum standard length (msl) was chosen as a proxy of body size to remove the effect of caudal fin’s length variability accompanying total length (webb 1982). data were extracted from fish- base (froese & pauly 2012; last date of access: 10 february 2012). missing data were completed either using available morphometric ratios (converting total length or fork length into standard length) in fishbase or measurements from the literature (1041 species; table s2). we used the mean of msl when a termi- nal taxon (genus) was represented by several species. we consider the use of mean msl as a biologically sound proxy as there was a significant, positive corre- lation between the means and msl of randomly sam- pled species within each genus (log-transformed values: r² = 0.82; data not shown). the distribution of taxa and environmental factors was extracted from a worldwide database of freshwa- ter fish occurrences per drainage basin (brosse et al. 2013). only native species were included in the analy- sis. we used a series of seven predictors linked to the mechanistic hypotheses put forward to explain geo- graphical body size patterns (blanchet et al. 2010): (i) drainage basin surface area (to test the habitat avail- ability hypothesis), (ii) drainage basin mean annual temperature (to test the temperature hypothesis, assuming that mean air temperature is a good surro- gate for mean water temperature; oberdorff et al. 1995), (iii) mean absolute value of the lowest latitudi- nal ranges for each species within a genus, (iv) drain- age basin mean annual actual evapotranspiration (a measure of water–energy balance closely associated with productivity (hawkins et al. 2003), to test the primary productivity hypothesis), (v) coefficients of variation of actual evapotranspiration (to test the envi- ronmental predictability hypothesis and the closely related seasonality hypothesis), (vi) glacier coverage during the last glacial maximum (lgm) (i.e. the per- centage of drainage basin area that was under ice dur- ing the lgm, to test the migration ability hypothesis) and (vii) native species richness (to test the competi- tive interaction hypothesis) (see tisseuil et al. 2013 for data sources and definition). we calculated mean values for each variable when terminal taxa were rep- resented by several species. when necessary, variables were ln- or arcsin-transformed to improve normality. we combined an inter- and intrageneric analysis to assess whether different environmental factors could act on body size distribution within cyprinidae depending on taxonomic scales. for the intergeneric analysis, we used the method of independent contrasts with the genus-level supertree of cyprinidae of gau- bert et al. (2009) as a backbone to remove the effect of phylogenetic constraints across lineages, assuming brownian motion of character evolution (felsenstein 1985) and heritability of ecological characteristics (webb et al. 2002). given that our supertree had no estimates of branch length, we used two different methods of relative branch length attribution to assess whether those could have an influence on the calcula- tion of independent contrasts: (i) all branch lengths were set to one, assuming a random speciation model (garland et al. 1992; ackerly 2000), and (ii) height was assigned to each node of the supertree as one less than the number of leaves below or at that node; path- segment lengths were then calculated between each node, as the difference between the height of the upper and lower nodes (grafen 1989). the latter branch length ‘correction’ has been shown to improve the performance of independent contrasts when character evolution deviates from brownian motion and when errors occur in branch length estimates (dıaz-uriarte & garland 1996, 1998). internal node pairwise com- parisons were removed from the analyses. indepen- dent contrasts were calculated with the pdap module 1.07 (midford et al. 2005) implemented in mesquite 2.74 (maddison & maddison 2007). from library ‘mumin’ multiple linear models were applied to determine the best set of variables (transformed into independent contrasts) in explaining the body size variation pattern based on streamline information-theoretic model selection. we used the automated model selection (barton function ‘dredge’ 2011) in r statistical package (r development core team 2010) to run models for all possible combina- tions of the explanatory variables and then selected the best-fitted models based on the akaike informa- tion criterion (aic), using daic <2 as a cut-off crite- rion to delineate a ‘top model set’ (grueber et al. 2011). relative importance of the predictor variables was calculated using function ‘model.avg’ as a sum of the akaike weights over all of the selected models in body size distribution in cyprinidae if other which the parameter of interest appears. mean abso- lute latitude values were included in the model selec- tion procedure to test latitudinal-related variables not analysed here significantly improved the model fit. we checked for multicolinearity among fac- tors using the variance inflation factor (vif) proce- dure (‘vif’ function from library ‘car’ in r statistical package; r development core team 2010). the vif provides an index that measures how much the vari- ance of an estimated regression coefficient is increased because of colinearity, with values above 5 showing high multicolinearity. our analyses revealed no strong colinearity among predictors (maximum vif = 4.42). multiple linear regressions were performed using a zero intercept model (i.e. removing the constant) to meet the ‘assumption of independence’ required by independent contrasts (felsenstein 1985). for the intrageneric analysis, trends in body size within genus-level lineages were analysed to assess if different mechanistic hypotheses were supported when changing of phylogenetic scale. for this pur- pose, we extracted from our database 124 genus-level taxa regrouping from 2 to 69 species each. as the su- pertree of cyprinidae (gaubert et al. 2009) uses genus-level taxa as leaves and given the few number of exhaustive phylogenies within the cyprinid genera considered, we did not use phylogenetic information within genera. instead, we fitted linear mixed-effects (lme) models allowing to decompose variance across species by coding the random-effects error structure as a hierarchical taxonomic – genus in our case – effect (link & barker 2006). as for the across-lineage analysis, we applied multiple linear models and an automated model selection based on aic to determine the best set of predictive factors. we also included mean absolute latitude as a predic- tor variable in the model selection procedure. we detected no strong colinearity among predictors (maximum vif = 4.59). the r-squared coefficient based on likelihood ratio (of the model and the inter- cept model) was used as a measure of goodness-of-fit of the selected mixed models. lme models were conducted in r statistical package (r development core team 2010) with the ‘lme’ function from library ‘nlme’ (pinheiro et al. 2011). to assess the effect of taking into consideration the phylogenetic history in body size distribution among genus-level taxa of cyprinids, we also ran an intergen- eric analysis without a phylogenetic backbone. in that case, methodology and model selection followed the procedure detailed above for the intrageneric analysis. results for the intergeneric analysis, inferences from inde- pendent contrast estimates based on the two methods 127 denys et al. of branch length ‘correction’ (equal and path-seg- ment) were similar. the best set of models explaining intergeneric geographical clines in body size identi- fied temperature (negative effect) as having the strongest influence, with the highest values of ‘rela- tive variable importance’ and statistically significant effects (tables 1 and 2; fig. 1). at this taxonomic level, drainage basin surface area (positive effect) also presented high values of ‘relative variable impor- tance’ and marginally significant effects on body size variation patterns (tables 1 and 2; fig. 1). according latitude per se had no significant to the models, effect. without phylogenetic control for character evolution among genus-level taxa (i.e. not using the supertree as a backbone), the linear models displayed very poor predictive power and identified aet (neg- ative effect), glacial coverage (positive effect) and temperature (negative effect) as having the strongest influences on body size, although aet was most often nonsignificant and the latter two variables were never significant (see table s3). following similar criteria, the best set of lme models explaining intrageneric geographical clines of body size identified four variables. species richness (negative effect) and drainage basin area (positive effect) had the strongest influence (i.e. highest stan- dardised coefficients and significance values), fol- lowed by the significant (positive) effects of glacial coverage and actual evapotranspiration (table 3). according to the models, latitude per se had no sig- nificant effect. discussion environmental correlates of body size distribution in cyprinidae our results support the view that environmental fac- tors shaping body size variation may differ accord- ing to the taxonomic level under consideration (blackburn et al. 1999; cruz et al. 2005). at the higher phylogenetic scale (intergenus level) within for temperature and habitat in ectotherms cyprinids, we observed a highly significant, nega- tive effect of temperature (tables 1 and 2; fig. 1) and a slightly significant positive effect of drainage basin area. although latitudinal body size gradients among cyprinids were found worldwide (lindsey 1966) and regionally (knouft 2004), latitude per se had no significant effect on body size variations in our study after temperature was taken into account, suggesting no supplementary effect this syn- thetic variable. in terms of plausible mechanistic explanations that may have shaped the observed pattern of body size variation across cyprinids worldwide, availability hypotheses were thus the best candidates. a co-act- ing implication of adaptive versus nonadaptive mechanisms has been proposed to explain the tem- perature hypothesis (angilletta & dunham 2003; angilletta et al. 2004). water tem- perature affects gametogenesis development (ray 1960), notably in cyprinids (billard & marcel 1986), and empirical studies have already provided support to faster maturation time and smaller body size associated to temperature increase in teleost- eans (pawson et al. 2000; daufresne et al. 2009; although we used maximum body size, that is from individuals presumably older than at maturation). in addition, regional scale and in situ studies have shown a positive correlation between body size and habitat ‘availability’ (e.g. home range size and habi- tat depth) in teleosteans, possibly due to dispersal capacity at the regional scale (tales et al. 2004) and predation pressure at the local scale (harvey & stewart 1991). nevertheless, the mechanisms at the the temperature/habitat availability–body origin of size relationships, and the way those two forces may have interacted during the evolutionary history of cyprinidae, are yet to be determined. at a lower phylogenetic scale (intragenus level), body size variation in cyprinids was not correlated to temperature. instead, we observed a different series of environmental factors acting on body size distribu- tion, possibly in some antagonistic way, including table 1. results of the model selection analysis assessing body size across cyprinid genus-level taxa as a function of seven explanatory variables, using equal branch length for the supertree. values given for each variable are standardised regression coefficients. selected variables aet aetcv dsa glac lat dsa + t aetcv + dsa + t dsa + sr + t dsa + lat + t aet + dsa + t relative importance  0.058  0.021 0.143 0.179 0.128* 0.125* 0.149 0.126* 0.122 1.000  0.040 0.000 0.147 sr t  0.250***  0.289***  0.033  0.237***  0.283**  0.244*** 1.000 0.149 df 3 4 4 4 4 loglik  285.077  284.802  284.988  284.999  285.028 aicc delta weight r² 576.200 577.800 578.100 578.200 578.200 0.000 1.510 1.880 1.910 1.960 0.129 0.06 0.05 0.05 0.048 0.095 0.097 0.095 0.095 0.095 aet, actual evapotranspiration;

strongest influence), drainage basin surface area (positive effect; strongest influence), glacial coverage and actual evapotranspi- ration (positive effects) (table 3). thus, we suggest that body size variation at a finer phylogenetic scale within cyprinidae may be explained by the combina- tion of four mechanistic hypotheses, namely competi- tive interaction, habitat availability, migration ability and energy availability. the negative relationship that we found between body size and species richness fits the posited pattern of coexistence of smaller species in the context of increased interspecific competition for resources (ashton et al. 2000; blanckenhorn 2000). in addition, in freshwater teleosteans, dispersal is favoured in larger species because of lower migra- tory cost and occurrence in large river corridors (ber- natchez & dodson 1987; knouft 2004; blanchet et al. 2010; griffiths 2012). this could explain our findings of body size variation within cyprinid genera conforming to the habitat availability and migration 129 denys et al. ability mechanistic hypotheses. in line with rosen- zweig’s (1968) argumentation that primary productiv- ity could be an important selective pressure on body size as body mass must be maintained by a sufficient food supply, our study also found that body size vari- ation among species of cyprinids was positively cor- related to available energy at the intragenus scale. however, while this pattern has been also observed in some ectotherms (e.g. snakes), others show con- verse-clines (e.g. lizards; olalla-tarraga et al. 2006) suggesting that there is no simple answer to the energy availability hypothesis. results support given the superimposition of the mechanistic hypotheses potentially involved (five in total) and of the phylogenetic scales (inter- and intrageneric), our the view that deterministic, broadly generalised geographical patterns of body size are difficult to establish (berke et al. 2012). eventually, drainage basin area was the only vari- able to act (positively) on body size variation at both taxonomic scales in cyprinids, further reinforc- ing the importance of habitat size in riverine eco- system geographical 2003; griffiths 2013). (biedermann clines robustness of the independent contrast analysis and perspectives on the comparative approach in cyprinids the results of our comparative analysis based on independent contrasts (intergenus level) were consis- tent across the two methods of branch length attribu- tion applied to the supertree of cyprinidae. in addition, when discarding the phylogenetic noninde- pendence of character evolution among genus-level taxa (i.e. not using the supertree), the linear models displayed very poor predictive power (see table s3). such lines of evidence suggest – indirectly – that the distribution of body size within cyprinids is not inde- pendent of the evolutionary relationships among gen- era, and as a corollary, that heritability of ecological characteristics occurs within the family (see taylor & gotelli 1994). the robustness of our comparative approach was further supported by its nonsensitivity to the branch length attribution methods applied to our supertree, which is in line with the robustness of independent contrasts to branch length calculations (dıaz-uriarte & garland 1998). although the aim of our study was deterministic (i.e. testing evolutionary correlation between body size and environmental variables), we acknowledge that assessing the relative contribution of the phylog- eny on body size distribution and the fit of other evo- lutionary models than the brownian motion (e.g. via phylogenetic generalised least squares; martins & hansen 1997) may allow to further understand the evolution of body size in cyprinids. 130 one of the potential caveats of our comparative method may reside in the fact that we used mean max- imum standard lengths (msl) to describe body size distribution among cyprinid genera (see garamszegi & møller 2010), although such proxies appeared bio- logically meaningful (e.g. we observed a positive cor- relation between means and msl values among species within genera). in fact, the two-scale phyloge- netic assessment of morphological variance distribu- tion among cyprinids conducted here would have been optimal if independent contrasts were calculated by considering at the same time the covariance of evo- lutionary changes (intergenera) and a fraction of the within-genus (see felsenstein 2008). indeed, the potential influence of lower taxonomic rank variation on higher taxonomic rank patterns has recently been put forward (gaston et al. 2008). the advent of more flexible computing environments (freckleton 2009) together with the consolidation of our knowledge on the phylogenetic relationships within cyprinid genera should improve our ability to understand body size variation in the cyprinidae. covariance acknowledgements this work was partly supported by the eu biofresh project (fp7-env-2008, contract no 226874). we are grateful to frederic busson for providing fishbase data extractions, yves desdevises, joe felsenstein and miguel a. olalla-tarraga for methodological advices and to kazumi hosoya for data shar- ing. two anonymous reviewers provided valuable comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript. this is publication ise-m 2014-137. references ackerly, d.d. 2000. taxon sampling, correlated evolution, and independent contrasts. evolution 54: 1480–1492. algar, a.c., kerr, j.t. & currie, d.j. 2009. evolutionary con- straints on regional faunas: whom, but not how many. ecol- ogy letters 12: 57–65. angilletta, m.j. & dunham, a.e. 2003. the temperature-size rule in ectotherms: simple evolutionary explanations may not be general. american naturalist 162: 332–342. angilletta, m.j., steury, t.d. & sears, m.w. 2004. tempera- ture, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle. integrative and comparative biology 44: 498–509. ashton, k.g., tracy, m.c. & queiroz, a.d. 2000. is berg- mann’s rule valid for mammals?
