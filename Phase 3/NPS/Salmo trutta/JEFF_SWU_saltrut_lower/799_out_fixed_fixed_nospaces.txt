minagawa & wada, 1984), is a powerful tool for determining the diet of animals, food web structure and migration patterns in aquatic systems (france, 1995; hobson, 1999; rutz et al., 2010). gut content analysis can re- veal the recent diet of an individual, whereas the isotope ratios can indicate the longer- term diet of an individual (hesslein, hallard, & ramlal, 1993), thereby reducing the effects of short- term temporal variation. temporally integrated information obtained through the use of isotope ratios is also essential for studies aiming to determine the origin of migrating organisms (hobson, 1999; minami & ogi, 1997). thus, the advantage of isotope analysis involves its ability to provide an integrative history of habitat use and trophic ecology compared with that of other methods, including gut content analysis and direct observation. however, the long integrative history of stable isotope ratios in some tissues can be problematic for highly migratory species or cases where shorter timescale data are of interest. the use of an isotopic approach has often been hampered by the slow rate of response of isotope ratios in the muscle tissue of fishes, which has been most widely analysed in stable isotope analysis (herzka, 2005). the isotopic change in the muscle tissue of fishes is mostly stud- ied using juvenile fishes (mcintyre & flecker, 2006); however, when adult fishes were used in past studies, the half- life of isotopic change 636  |   wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:636–642. © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd﻿marum﻿m ﻿et mal. in the muscle tissues of fishes often exceeded 3 months (harvey, hanson, essington, brown, & kitchell, 2002; hesslein et al., 1993; macavoy, macko, & garman, 2001; madigan et al., 2012; maruyama, yamada, rusuwa, & yuma, 2001). this slow response in adult fishes fails to provide a sufficient temporal resolution for the technique to be useful in some short- term experiments or under temporally variable natural conditions. for instance, the diet compositions of fishes often shift in response to the seasonal changes in the composition of prey species. however, isotope ratios in the muscle tissues of fishes can- not detect such short- term diet shifts, particularly when slow- growing fishes are of interest. in addition, slow turnover rates make it difficult to distinguish between migration history and dietary history in migra- tory fishes, which may lead to the misinterpretation in diet and food web structure analyses. this slow response is considered to be due to slow growth rates in most adult fishes compared with those in some organisms at lower trophic levels, such as crustaceans and algae (fry & arnold, 1982), and low catabolic turnover rates compared with those in endothermic animals (tieszen, 1983). catabolic turnover rates also vary within species; for example, the catabolic turnover in the liver tissue was found to be high compared with that in the muscle tissue of juvenile mummichogs (fundulus heteroclitus linnaeus), ocellate river stingrays (potamotrygon motoro j.p. müller & henle) and juvenile nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus linnaeus) (carleton & martinez del rio, 2010; logan, haas, deegan, & gaines, 2006; macneil, drouillard, & fisk, 2006). furthermore, turnover rate in the blood was found to be higher than that in the muscle tissue of armoured catfish, ancistrus triradiatus eigenmann (mcintyre & flecker, 2006). to the best of our knowledge, the most rapid isotopic change in the tissues of fishes was observed in the blood plasma of armoured catfish, pterygoplichthys disjunctivus c.weber, with a mean residence time estimated to be 11 and 33 days for δ13c and δ15n values respectively (german & miles, 2010). in a previous study, the isotope turnover rate of the epidermal mucus (slime) of fish was evaluated under controlled conditions by church et al. (2009). these authors switched the diet of juvenile steel- head (oncorhynchus_mykiss walbaum) in a hatchery experiment and found that the half- life of isotopic change in fish mucus was approxi- mately 1 month, whereas that in fish muscle was approximately 3 and 4.5 months for δ13c and δ15n respectively. thus, isotopic changes in the mucus of fishes may be as rapid as in the blood plasma, and the epidermal mucus can be more easily collected than the blood plasma, even from small living fishes (church et al., 2009). a recent study compared the isotopic changes in seven tissues of steelhead fry and showed that mucus is among the fast- responding tissues, following fin tissue, blood plasma and liver tissue (heady & moore, 2013). isotopic change in the epidermal mucus was also found to be faster than that in the muscle tissue of the migratory goby rhinogobius sp. or (kawanabe & mizuno, 1989) in the field (maruyama, shimonaka, & ito, 2015). trophic discrimination factors and isotopic turnover rates vary among animals (barnes, sweeting, jennings, barry, & polunin, 2007; deniro & epstein, 1978) and among tissues (carleton & martinez del rio, 2010; heady & moore, 2013; logan et al., 2006; pinnegar & polunin, 1999; tieszen, 1983). there may also be a variation in trophic     |  637 discrimination factors and isotopic turnover rates in the epidermal mucus, particularly between the young individuals of small species and adult individuals of large species. data from a range of individuals and species are required to expand the use of isotopic approaches in fish biology and aquatic ecology. in the present study, we conducted a diet- switch experiment using a freshwater fish species at a different age (five- year- old adult fish) from that analysed in the previous study (church et al., 2009). a faster change in the isotopic ratios of the epidermal mucus than that in the widely used muscle tissue will indicate the greater feasibility of the application of stable isotope techniques to study the diet shifts and migration of fishes over short timescales, such as several weeks to a few months. we monitored the changes in the δ13c values of the epidermal mucus and muscle tissue for 3 months and estimated  discrimination factors and the rates of isotopic change. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | fish used in the experiment we used five- year- old adults of the japanese common catfish (silurus asotus linnaeus) as a model for adult large fishes. this species is a piscivorous fish commonly found in east asia. the total length of this species reaches 60 cm in japan (kawanabe & mizuno, 1989). this spe- cies migrates multiple times from rivers to paddy fields for reproduc- tive and feeding purposes, but their migration cannot be easily traced (kawanabe & mizuno, 1989; maehata, 2002). an isotopic approach that allows the reconstruction of the migration of individuals with high temporal resolution may reveal its migration pattern and trophic roles. five- year- old individuals of s. asotus used for the experiment were hatched in june 2009 at the gifu prefectural research institute for fisheries and aquatic environments hatchery in central japan (35° 22′ 17″ n, 136° 48′ 22″ e). the fish were kept in a 3,700- l aquarium (500 cm length × 150 cm width × 50 cm depth) with aer- ated subsurface water maintained at 16–18°c (supplied at the rate of 2–3 l·min−1) under ambient light. the fish were fed commercial fish food (masu ep- 3.2p; nosan co. ltd., yokohama, japan), here- after called food a, once daily to satiation, from hatching until the start of the experiment. while the fish were small, pellets of food a were crushed. the isotopic compositions in the whole bodies of these individuals were considered to have reached a steady state with food a. the mean wet weight of the sample fish was 189.9 ± 81.2 g [mean ± standard deviation (sd), n = 41] at the beginning of the exper- iment. we collected four samples of food a simultaneously before the diet- switch experiment for stable isotope analysis. 2.2 | aquarium experiment we initiated the experiment in mid- october 2014 and concluded it in late march 2015. the experiment started with 50 individuals of five- year- old s. asotus. on day 1 (18 october 2014), we switched fish food to defrosted chironomid larvae (uv akamushi, kyorin co. ltd., himeji, japan), hereafter called food b, which contains 72% protein, 9% lipid 638  |     and 3% fibre by dry weight. we chose food b as a food source after diet switching as chironomids are among the main prey of freshwater fishes and were eaten intensively by the target species during the preliminary observation. we provided food b once daily at 18:00 h to satiation (approximately 3% of fish body wet weight). to ensure that the iso- topic composition of food b was consistent in the diets of individuals and among days, approximately 12 kg of frozen chironomid larvae was defrosted, mixed thoroughly in a bucket and refrozen at −22.5°c prior to the experiment. five portions of food b were randomly sampled at the end of the mixing process for stable isotope analysis. on day 1, we sacrificed five individuals to measure the initial iso- tope ratios. subsequently, we sacrificed one individual every two days during days 2–25, every three days during days 26–74 and every five days during days 75–99. no individual died during the experiment, except for sampling purposes. standard length (sl) measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the sampling of each individual ranged from 19.5 to 39.5 cm. individual fish samples were kept in separate plastic zip- lock bags to avoid the intersample contamination. the samples were frozen at −22.5°c or below until analysis (for less than 3 months) similar to that in a previous study (church et al., 2009), not only for preserva- tion purpose but also because a relatively large amount of epidermal mucus is excreted during the thawing process. 2.3 | isotope analysis the epidermal mucus was wiped directly from the body surface of each thawed fish sample using half of a 25- mm- diameter gf/f glass microfibre filter (ge healthcare, buckinghamshire, uk) and dried at 60°c for 48 h, as described in a previous study (maruyama et al., 2015). each filter was cleaned with forceps before and after drying to remove the scales or skin fragments, if present. we used this method of mucus collection because it was easier and showed smaller errors than the previous method used in our preliminary ex- periments adopted from church et al. (2009). we did not conduct the lipid extraction or mathematical corrections for the mucus samples as glycoprotein dominates the composition of mucus together with nonlipid components (shephard, 1994). muscle tissue was extracted from the upper lateral section of each fish (the same individuals for mucus sampling), dried at 60°c for 48 h and ground to a fine powder. the effect of variable lipid content on the δ13c value of the muscle tissue was corrected after the stable isotope analysis using the c:n ratio of each sample [3.4 ± 0.1 (mean ± sd)], according to a fish mus- cle tissue- specific correction model (logan et al., 2008) (lipid correc- tions, 0.6‰ ± 0.2‰). food samples of a and b were treated in the same manner as the muscle tissue, except that lipids were removed using 2:1 chloroform/methanol solution (bligh & dyer, 1959) prior to the stable isotope analysis as correction models specific to these food samples were not available. isotope analysis was performed using a delta v advantage mass spectrometer (thermo fisher scientific, bremen, germany) connected to a flash ea 1112 elemental analyser (thermo fisher scientific) through a conflo iv interface (thermo fisher scientific) at ryukoku university, japan. δ13c was expressed as the per mil deviation from the ﻿marum﻿m ﻿et mal. standard (vienna peedee belemnite) as δ13c = [(rsample − rstandard)/ rstandard] × 1000 (‰), where rsample and rstandard are the ratios of the heavy to light isotope (13c/12c) in the sample and standard respectively. analytical errors in the δ13c value were less than ±0.3‰. 2.4 | data analysis we calculated the diet–tissue isotopic discrimination factor for both mucus and muscle as the difference between the mean δ13c values for day 1 and those of the preswitch food (a). the estimates of diet– tissue discrimination factor were only generated for the beginning of the experiment when both mucus and muscle were believed to have reached isotopic steady states with the preswitch food (a). because variances of the estimates of the diet–tissue discrimination factor were marginally different between mucus and muscle (f4, 3 = 10.2, p = .086), we used welch’s t- test to compare the estimates of the diet–tissue discrimination factor between mucus and muscle. welch’s t- test was conducted using the t- test function in r ver. 3.2.2 software (r core team 2015) with a significance level of .05. isotopic changes occur as a result of catabolic turnover and growth of the focal tissue (i.e. mucus or muscle). the δ value at time t (δt) after diet switching can be written as follows (hesslein et al., 1993): δt = δﬁn + (δinit − δﬁn) × e−(k+c)×t, (1) where δinit and δfin are δ values at the initial time (t = 0) and at the final time (t = infinity) respectively, k is the growth rate (per day), and c is the catabolic turnover constant (per day). in the present study, δt was obtained as the δ13c value of each sample, δinit was the mean δ13c value from day 1, and δfin was calculated as the mean δ13c value of the postswitch food plus the diet–tissue isotopic discrimination factor. thus, we assumed a common discrimination factor for both preswitch and postswitch foods [but see pearson, levey, greenberg, and del rio (2003)] as generating the estimates of discrimination factors for the postswitch food was predicted to take impractically long periods of time when using slow- growing fish. the rate of isotopic change k + c was obtained by curve fitting using equation 1. because we had no a priori knowledge on mucus “growth” (namely, increase in the mass) (church et al., 2009; shephard, 1994), we did not evaluate the relative contributions of growth rate (k) and catabolic turnover rate (c) to iso- topic change in the present study. in slow- growing fishes, growth rate (k) is considered to be close to 0; hence, metabolic turnover mainly contributed to isotopic change. nonlinear regressions were conducted using the nls function in r ver. 3.2.2 software with a significance level of .05. when the regression was significant, half- lives of isotopic change (thalf) were calculated as follows: t half = ln 2 k + c . (2) equation 1 can be linearised by taking the natural logarithm as  follows (cerling et al., 2007): ln δt − δﬁn δinit − δﬁn = −(k + c) × t. (3) ﻿marum﻿m ﻿et mal. the left side of equation 3, defined as a reaction progress variable (cerling et al., 2007; criss, 1999), was calculated using the data from our aquarium experiment, as described above. one of the advantages of the linearisation model over the exponential- fit model is that mul- tiple experiments can be considered together using the normalisation process inherent in this approach (cerling et al., 2007). the rate of iso- topic change k + c was statistically compared between different types of tissues by the linear model with tissue type (mucus or muscle), time (day) and interaction terms of time with tissue type and sl (cm) as fixed factors. thus, tissue type and fish size were assumed to affect the rate of isotopic change. the linear model regression was conducted using the lm function in r ver. 3.2.2 software with a significance level of .05. 3 |  results 3.1 | trophic discrimination factors for mucus and muscle the δ13c values for food a and food b were −20.8‰ ± 0.1‰ (mean ± sd, n = 5) and −14.3‰ ± 0.1‰ (n = 5) respectively. thus, the difference in δ13c values between the two foods before and after the diet switch was 6.5‰. the initial δ13c value (δinit) was −21.0‰ ± 0.5‰ for the mucus (n = 5) and −18.7‰ ± 0.2‰ for the muscle tissue (n = 4). hence, the diet–tissue discrimination factor was −0.2‰ ± 0.5‰ for the mucus and 2.2‰ ± 0.2‰ for the muscle tissue. none of the tissues analysed reached an isotopic steady state with food b (figure 1a). hence, the final δ13c value (δfin) was calculated as the mean δ13c value of the postswitch food plus the diet–tissue isoto- pic discrimination factor, as stated in the methods section, and fixed at −14.5‰ for the mucus and −12.1‰ for the muscle during the model fitting. the diet–tissue discrimination factor was significantly lower in the mucus than in the muscle tissue (welch’s t- test, t = 9.19, p < .001; figure 1a). 3.2 | rates of isotopic change in mucus and muscle tissue the δ13c values of mucus gradually increased after diet switching, re- flecting the higher δ13c value for food b than for food a (figure 1a). nonlinear regressions (equation 1) provided the rates of isotopic change k + c as (3.46 × 10−3) ± (0.60 × 10−3) for mucus (p < .001), which corresponded to the half- lives (thalf) of 200 days. on the other hand, nonlinear regression was not significant for the muscle tissue (p > .05). the half- life in the muscle was not calculated because the isotopic changes were not significant. the reaction progress variables (equation 2) decreased signifi- cantly with time (table 1, figure 1b). the interaction terms of tissue type with time showed strong positive effects on the changes in the reaction progress variables, indicating that isotopic changes were more rapid in the mucus than in the muscle tissue. the interaction terms of sl with time also had positive effects, indicating that larger individuals had a significantly slower rate of isotopic change.     |  639 food b food a muscle mucus 20 40 60 80 100 muscle mucus (a) 0 (b) –12 –14 –16 –18 –20 –22 –24 3 1 l e b a i r a v s s e r g o r p  n o i t c a e r 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 time after diet switch (day) figure 1 changes in the stable carbon isotope ratio (δ 13c) values (a) and reaction progress variables (b) in the epidermal mucus and muscle tissue (solid and open circles respectively) of five- year- old catfish (silurus asotus). reaction progress variables are defined as ln [(δt − δfin)/(δinit − δfin)]. dotted lines show the mean δ13c values of food a and food b. triangles and arrows indicate the estimated initial (left) and final (right) δ13c values for the epidermal mucus and muscle tissue respectively. solid and dashed lines show the results of regressions for the epidermal mucus and muscle tissue respectively (only significant regressions were shown) table 1 summary of a linear model to explain the reaction progress variables (ln[(δt − δfin)/(δinit − δfin)]), calculated from the change in the stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13c) in a diet- switch experiment using five- year- old catfish (silurus asotus), by comparing the epidermal mucus and muscle tissue independent variables intercepta time (t, day) tissue: muscle time × tissue: muscle time × sl (mm) r2 values for the model coefficients for s. asotus 0.0463 ± 0.0263 −0.0145 ± 0.0019* −0.0176 ± 0.0376 0.00384 ± 0.00081* 0.000370 ± 0.000070* 0.617* sl, standard length. estimates ± se are shown with significance levels (*p < .001). athe tissue was mucus. 4 |  discussion the use of the epidermal mucus of fishes in isotope analysis has the potential to become a powerful tool with two main advantages over 640  |     traditional isotope analysis using the muscle tissue. first, mucus iso- tope ratios respond more rapidly to diet switching than the widely used muscle isotope ratios, thereby enabling the use of isotopic ap- proaches in the study of short- term shifts in diet, temporal migration between habitats and the seasonal structure of food webs. the use of mucus could be coupled with isotope analysis of other tissue types to take a multiple- tissue approach, which has been used to reveal the diet of some endothermic animals (hobson & clark, 1992; kurle & worthy, 2002) and a few elasmobranch fishes (macneil, skomal, & fisk, 2005; macneil et al., 2006) over different timescales. a recent study applied this approach to an ectothermic teleost fish to track the shifts in diet using the changes in δ15n values in seven tissue types of juvenile steelhead, including mucus (heady & moore, 2013). second, it may be possible to sample the mucus from living fish, as proposed by church et al. (2009). this simple, nonlethal method of sampling, together with a rapid response, would enable the repeated measure- ments of isotope ratios from the same individuals and at short time in- tervals, which will be particularly useful in the experimental situation. in our study, isotope ratios measured in the epidermal mucus of fish changed more rapidly compared with those measured in the mus- cle tissue (table 1, figure 1). a high rate of isotopic change in mucus has also been observed in juvenile steelhead in a hatchery experiment (church et al., 2009) and in a migratory goby in the field (maruyama et al., 2015). although interspecific difference in the rate of isotopic change is considerable, turnover rates have been higher in the mucus than in the muscle tissue for all three species at different life stages examined to date. faster isotopic change would allow the analysis of the diets of fishes over a relatively fine timescale. this would enable the use of an isotopic approach in the ecology of fishes to be extended and used on a finer temporal scale, when compared to traditional anal- ysis using the muscle tissue. a multiple- tissue stable isotope approach to the study of dietary habits and migration of fishes over different timescales is likely to be more widely applicable, as advocated by pre- vious studies (german & miles, 2010; heady & moore, 2013; lujan, german, & winemiller, 2011). previous studies have reported that several types of tissues of fishes, including fin tissue (probably specific to fry), blood plasma, liver tissue and red blood cells demonstrate more rapid isotopic changes than the widely used muscle tissue (carleton & martinez del rio, 2010; church et al., 2009; german & miles, 2010; heady & moore, 2013; logan et al., 2006; macneil et al., 2006; mcintyre & flecker, 2006). when compared with the mean residence time or half- life of isotopic change in these tissues (10–30 days in general), mucus does not show the quickest isotopic change. the advantage of the use of mucus over the other fast- responding tissues may be that mucus can be collected more easily, even from living fishes (church et al., 2009). blood collection can also be conducted without sacrificing fishes, but is invasive and causes damage to fishes. when isotope ratios are re- quired to be measured repeatedly from the same individuals or the target species are rare and protected, mucus will be the most suitable tissue for stable isotope analysis. further studies are required to ex- plore the applicability of nonlethal sampling of mucus, including the minimum body size of fish. ﻿marum﻿m ﻿et mal. although using mucus to evaluate the dietary habits and migration of fishes over a fine timescale shows promise, there were few data de- scribing the factors that contribute to the variation in the rate of iso- topic change. our study showed that the isotopic response was seven times slower (half- life of δ13c = 200 days) in large, five- year- old fish of s. asotus than in juvenile steelhead (30 days) (church et al., 2009). the half- life of 200 days would not be short enough for some re- search purposes. in addition, isotopic change was slower in the larger individual than in smaller ones of the same species (table 1). thus, growth rate and catabolic turnover may differ among species and life stages (i.e. age), resulting in differences in the rates of isotopic change. furthermore, the effect of growth rate on the isotopic change should be recognised. an isotopic change in the muscle tissue was not de- tected in the present study, probably because of slow growth. hence, with a possible faster growth in some regions, the half- life of isotopic change in the mucus of the same species would be shorter than the estimates obtained from our experiment. similarly, the differences be- tween the estimates of isotopic turnover rates obtained under labora- tory and natural conditions have been reported for the whole bodies of fish larvae (herzka, holt, & holt, 2001). although the estimation of the rate of isotopic change under controlled conditions is necessary (gannes, 1997), it is important to recognise that these estimates may not always reflect the natural conditions to which fishes in the field are exposed (malpica- cruz, herzka, sosa- nishizaki, lazo, & trudel, 2012). to interpret isotope ratios in the mucus of fishes from the field, researchers will need to determine the rate of isotopic change in ad- vance, similar to traditional isotopic analysis using the muscle tissue. diet–tissue discrimination factors were calculated for the mucus and muscle tissue in the present study (figure 1). according to pre- vious studies (deniro & epstein, 1978, 1981; minagawa & wada, 1984), in most ecological studies, the values of 3.4‰ and 0–1‰ have been widely used as trophic discrimination factors for δ15n and δ13c respectively. however, trophic discrimination is known to vary among species (barnes, jennings, polunin, & lancaster, 2008; deniro & epstein, 1978; mccutchan, lewis, kendall, & mcgrath, 2003) and among tissues (heady & moore, 2013; roth & hobson, 2000; tieszen, 1983). in our study, the estimates of δ13c trophic discrimination factor for the muscle tissue (2.2‰) fell within the values reported in the lit- erature, but were slightly higher than the mean value (0.39‰ ± 1.3‰, mean ± sd) (post, 2002). the estimate of trophic discrimination factor for mucus (−0.2‰) was lower than those for the muscle tissue and similar to the estimates reported in the previous study using juvenile steelhead (−0.6‰ ± 0.4‰, mean ± se) (church et al., 2009). in gen- eral, mucus may have smaller δ13c trophic discrimination factors, and further work is required to explore this trend and its causes. as inter- individual variations in isotope ratios observed in the field have im- portant implications for ecological and evolutionary studies (bearhop, adams, waldron, fuller, & macleod, 2004; bolnick et al., 2003), careful consideration of temporal and spatial variability in discrimination fac- tors is required for an accurate estimate of changes in diet (matthews & mazumder, 2004). in conclusion, the present study showed that isotope ratios in mucus changed more rapidly than in the muscle tissue of five- year- old ﻿marum﻿m ﻿et mal. japanese common catfish (s. asotus), which represent older, larger fishes than those analysed in previous studies. the isotopic change rate in the mucus was slower in the five- year- old catfish when com- pared with the previously reported rate in juvenile steelhead. the use of the mucus of fishes in isotope analysis has great potential as the isotopic composition of mucus responds more rapidly and can be used to reveal the dietary changes over a finer timescale compared with tra- ditional isotopic analyses using the muscle tissue, while the timescale of the isotopic change in the same tissue type is variable according to species and size of fishes. mucus can also be sampled along with other tissues to study diet and migration over different timescales in a multiple- tissue approach. a variation in the turnover rates and discrim- ination factors of mucus was observed among species of fishes and in- dividuals. hence, as for traditional isotopic analyses, an understanding of these values is required for each species and size class of focal fish prior to the data interpretation. acknowledgements we are grateful to ms. shiori kotajima and other staff of gifu prefectural research institute for fisheries and aquatic environments for their support during the experiment. dr. yukihiro kohmatsu sup- ported the stable isotope analysis. we also thank the two reviewers for their constructive comments and enago (www.enago.jp) for the english language review. in this study, all procedures comply with japanese laws governing ethical conduct and the care and use of ani- mals in research. this study was partially supported by a japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant (houga) number 15k14792. references barnes, c., jennings, s., polunin, n. v., & lancaster, j. e.
