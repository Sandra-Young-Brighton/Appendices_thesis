whitfield & elliott, 2002). with many of the world’s estuaries already degraded, the reductions in habitat quality, quantity and connectivity (lotze et al., 2006) threaten species that depend on those habitats for all or part of their life cycle (fukushima, jutagate, grudpan, phomikong, & nohara, 2014; martin et al., 2007; robinson et al., 2009). for anadromous species, the reliance on estuarine habitats during critical rearing and migratory periods can have profound ram- ifications for population abundance and productivity (carr- harris, gottesfeld, & moore, 2015; fresh, casillas, johnson, & bottom, 2005; limburg, 2001). worldwide, numerous populations of anad- romous fishes have declined for a variety of reasons including re- duced access to spawning and rearing habitats resulting from dam construction (grote, bailey, & zydlewski, 2014; gustafson et al., 2012; hamerlynck & hostens, 1994; kareiva, marvier, & mcclure, 2000; levin & tolimieri, 2001), and degradation and loss of fresh- water and estuarine habitats from pollution, development (krummel [correction added on 12 april after first online publication: the affiliation of kate macneale was previously incorrect and has been corrected in this version] ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:857–873. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  857 © 2018 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdcondition of the lower columbia river (sagar et al., 2013) extending from the mouth of the columbia river to bonneville dam at river kilometre 234 (figure 1). specifically, fish were sampled and abiotic and biotic data collected from 28 sites in the spring/summer period (march to july) over 8 years (2005, 2007–2013). on average, six sites were sampled per year (table 1), and most sites were sampled two or more times over the spring/summer pe- riod, resulting in 106 sampling events over the course of our 8- year study (table s1). an interruption in research funding suspended sampling in 2006, and only campbell slough was sampled in 2007 (table 1). the location of our sampling sites ranged from the estua- rine habitats at the mouth of the columbia river (point adams at rkm 8) to the freshwater habitats near bonneville dam (beacon slough at rkm 230; table 1, figure 1). of this distance from bonneville dam to the ocean, approximately half (i.e., river km 0 to 120 river km) can be regarded as an estuarine environment to some degree. sites also varied in their proximity to the columbia river channel. for example, 12 of the 28 sites were located on the columbia river channel while six sites were off- channel a distance greater than 0.5 km (table 1). 858  |     et al., 2003; sindermann, 1994) and overfishing (moring, 2005; rand et al., 2012). (oncorhynchus in the columbia river basin, only 46% of the historical chinook salmon tshawytscha) populations are extant (gustafson et al., 2007). many populations are now protected under the u.s. endangered species act (esa). over the last century, hab- itats that provide essential salmon rearing opportunities, such as tidal swamps, have declined by 77%, and estuarine habitats in gen- eral have decreased by 20% (baldwin, spromberg, collier, & scholz, 2009; honea et al., 2009; roegner, dawley, russell, whiting, & teel, 2010). this habitat loss and degradation are expected to continue given that the region’s human population is predicted to increase by 40–100 million, an eightfold to 20- fold increase, by the end of the next century (national research council 2004). in order to recover these esa- listed populations, it is imperative that we understand how out- migrating juveniles use estuarine habitats, and what factors influ- ence the performance and survival of individuals belonging to these culturally and economically important columbia river populations. the purpose of our study was to investigate variability in perfor- mance of juvenile chinook salmon over 8 years and throughout the lower portion of the columbia river. we used somatic growth as an indicator of individual performance and habitat quality (e.g., le pape, holley, gurault, & desaunay, 2003; meng, gray, taplin, & kupcha, 2000; necaise, ross, & miller, 2005) given the positive relationships between body size and fitness (kingsolver & huey, 2008) and survival (juan- jordá, mosqueira, freire, & dulvy, 2015; sogard, 1997; zabel & achord, 2004). measuring somatic growth offers a direct method of evalu- ating the physiological status (i.e., performance) of an individual (macfarlane, 2010) because somatic growth is related to factors and processes such as food quality (beauchamp et al., 2007; hyatt et al., 2005), food availability (graeb, dettmers, wahl, & caceres, 2004; limm & marchetti, 2009), temperature (elliott, 1994), compe- tition (crozier, zabel, hockersmith, & achord, 2010) and predation (baumann et al., 2003). to reconstruct somatic growth of an indi- vidual, we relied upon the visible increments in their otoliths (i.e., ear bones) to estimate age (jones, 1992; stevenson & campana, 1992) and we used body size–age relationships to estimate an indi- vidual’s somatic growth in the days prior to their capture (casselman, 1987). using this measure of performance, we evaluated the extent to which variability was explained by a suite of abiotic and biotic variables including stock of origin, contaminants, invertebrate and fish densities, and river discharge. the resulting growth rate data are intended to help inform recovery planning for legally protected, genetically distinct groups (i.e., evolutionary significant units; myers et al., 1998) and to guide future habitat restoration and conservation efforts in the columbia river estuary. 2 |  method 2.1 | study region and sampling sites we used data collected by the lower columbia estuary partnership’s ecosystem monitoring program (emp), which monitors trends in the 0 . 7 4 5 . 6 4 0 . 6 4 5 . 5 4 0 . 5 4 a 1 b 2 3 4 5 c 9 10 6 8 7 12 13 11 14 d e 28 27 g 20 21 15 17 19 22 24 23 26 25 h 16 18 f –124.0 –123.5 –123.0 –122.5 –122.0 f i g u r e 1 map of the lower portion of the columbia river showing 28 sampling sites and eight hydrogeomorphic reaches defined by simenstad et al.

(2011) to classify our sites into eight hydrogeo- morphic reaches (a–h, see figure 1, table s2). these reaches differ in terms of ecosystem process and structure, most notably the phys- iochemical processes and fluvial and tidal hydrological conditions (simenstad et al., 2011). river discharge data were obtained for all collection dates from a usgs gauge (#14246900) located approx- imately 75 km upriver of the mouth of the columbia river. finally, average daily water temperature was measured at selected sites (table 1) using in situ autonomous data loggers. 2.2 | fish and invertebrate sampling during each sampling period, fish and invertebrates were collected from a site using one to three replicate tows of a beach seine (beach seine dimensions were either 37 × 2.4 m with 10 mm mesh size or 10 × 1.5 m chittaro et al.860  |     with 5 mm) and neuston net respectively. the beach seine was de- ployed in open- water and pulled up onto the channel- bank and shore (sagar et al., 2013). replicate tows of the neuston net were deployed in both open- water and channel- bank/emergent- vegetation habitats so as to adequately represent the prey available in the water column to fish feeding in these same habitats. in the channel- bank habitat, the neuston net was towed along a 10 m transect placed adjacent to the area sam- pled with the beach seine while the open- water habitat was sampled along a 50 to 100 m transect (in 2008 and 2009, 50 m transects were used, while 2010–2013 samples were collected using a 100 m transect; sagar et al., 2013). on average, the beach seine and neuston net sam- pled 698 m2 and 204 m2, respectively, per site and sampling period. collected fish were identified to species and counted. juvenile sal- monids were measured (fork length in mm), weighed (g), and inspected for hatchery marks and tags. if an individual had a clipped fin or coded wire tag, then it originated from a hatchery and was categorised as “hatchery.” if a fish did not have a mark or tag, then the individual was labelled as “unmarked.” the term “unmarked” is used instead of “natu- rally produced” or “wild” because some hatcheries do not clip fins nor inject coded wire tags or mark only a fraction of their releases (sagar et al., 2013). all fish were then released except for a subset of five to fif- teen juvenile chinook salmon, which were retained for lethal sampling. the juvenile chinook salmon that were selected for lethal sampling were euthanised with ms- 222. from each individual, we then dissected otoliths to be used in our growth analysis and took fin clips for genetic stock identification (see below). otoliths and fin clips were preserved separately in ethanol (sagar et al., 2013). gutted fish bodies, retained for contaminant analysis (see below), were wrapped in foil and placed on ice. all samples were transported to the northwest fisheries science center (nwfsc) laboratory. invertebrates from the neuston tows were preserved in ethanol and shipped to rhithron associates, inc. (missoula, montana), where indi- viduals were classified to taxonomic class or order and enumerated. we calculated average fish density (i.e., number of individuals collected per area seined, averaged across replicate tows) per site and day of year for three groups: chinook salmon, nonsalmonids (e.g., stickleback, killifish, bass), and other salmonids (i.e., coho salmon (o. kisutch), sockeye (o. nerka), chum salmon (o. keta) and trout species (i.e., rainbow trout and steelhead trout (o. mykiss), brown_trout (salmo_trutta) and cutthroat trout (o. clarkii; for more details see sagar et al., 2013). even though we collected predators of chinook salmon (e.g., smallmouth and largemouth bass, northern pikeminnow and walleye), this information was excluded from our analyses because these larger species are likely to be underrepre- sented in our data. from each invertebrate neuston tow sample, we estimated average invertebrate richness (i.e., number of taxonomic classes and orders) and density (i.e., number of individuals per area sampled, averaged across replicate tows) per site and day of year. specifically, left sagittal otoliths were embedded in crystal bond1 and polished in a sagittal plane using slurries (buehler©’s 600 grit silicon carbide, 5.0 alumina oxide and 1.0 micropolish) and a grind- ing wheel with buehler© 1500 micropolishing pads. polishing ceased when the core of the otolith was exposed and daily incre- ments (chittaro, zabel, beckman, larsen, & tillotson, 2015; volk, bottom, jones, & simenstad, 2010) were visible under a light mi- croscope. we photographed polished otoliths using a digital cam- era (leica dfc450) mounted on a compound microscope (zeiss©). using image pro plus© (version 7, mediacybernetics), we took two measurements from each otolith; distance from otolith core to edge (i.e., otolith radius at time of capture, oc) and distance from otolith core to seven daily increments in from the otolith edge (i.e., otolith radius measured at 7 days before capture, oa). for each individual, fork length at 7 days prior to capture (la) was estimated using the fraser–lee equation: la = d + lc − d oa oc where d is the intercept1 (11.7 mm) of the regression between fish length and otolith radius (r2 = .74, n = 615) and where lc represents fork length (mm) at capture. next, average daily growth rate (mm/ day) was calculated for an individual’s last 7 days of life (a), average daily growth = lc − la a seven days of growth was a reasonable amount of time to es- timate growth while in estuarine habitats because, depending on migratory type (i.e., ocean- type versus stream- type) and timing of migration (i.e., subyearling versus yearling migrant), chinook salmon may inhabit estuaries for weeks or months (healey, 1991; thorpe, 1994; weitkamp, goulette, hawkes, o’malley, & lipsky, 2014). chinook salmon exhibit two life history types referred to as “ocean- type” and “stream- type” (healey, 1991); ocean- type chinook salmon enter the ocean as subyearling (age 0) juveniles, while stream- type chinook salmon reside in streams/rivers for their first year before entering the ocean as yearling (age 1) smolts. typically, most yearling chinook salmon (i.e., stream- type) move rapidly through estuaries, while subyearlings (i.e., ocean- type) re- side in estuaries for longer periods (weitkamp et al., 2014). the categorisation of individuals to either subyearling or yearling mi- gration strategy depends upon when they exit the estuary and enter the ocean. given that our study was conducted in estuarine and freshwater habitats and did not include sampling in the ocean, we were unable to distinguish between migration strategy among our collected individuals. 2.3 | otolith processing and analyses to estimate recent somatic growth for each of our collected ju- venile chinook salmon, we analysed their otolith microstructure. 2.4 | genetic assignment we estimated the stock of origin for each of our juvenile chinook salmon through conditional maximum- likelihood genetic mixture analysis (rannala & mountain, 1997) implemented in the computer chittaro et al.package oncor (kalinowski, manlove, & taper, 2007). specifically, stock of origin was estimated using a regional microsatellite dna data set (seeb et al., 2007) that included baseline data for spawn- ing stocks from throughout the columbia river basin (described in teel, baker, kuligowski, friesen, & shields, 2009; teel et al., 2014). relative probability of origin was estimated for the following re- gional genetic stock groups: coastal spring/fall runs of northern oregon and southwestern washington; deschutes river fall run (fall run refers to the season when adults return to freshwater to spawn); upper columbia river summer/fall run; mid- and upper columbia river spring runs; spring creek group fall run; snake river fall run; upper willamette river spring run; west cascades fall run; west cascades spring run; and rogue river (seeb et al., 2007; teel et al., 2009, 2014; table 2). these ten genetic stock groups represent all the extant lineages in the columbia river (moran et al., 2013). rogue river lineage is included because this southern oregon coastal hatchery stock is currently propagated in the lower columbia river. a fish was considered accurately clas- sified to a stock if its genetic assignment probability was greater than or equal to 0.8, otherwise that fish was considered uncer- tain and was omitted from the analysis. this value of 0.8 is a good compromise between assignment accuracy and maintaining an ad- equate sample size of fish (moran, bromaghin, & masuda, 2014). 2.5 | contaminant analysis exposure to persistent, bioaccumulative toxicants can lead to effects such as reduced growth, disease susceptibility and metabolic dis- orders that may reduce survival for chinook salmon (arkoosh et al., 2010; fresh et al., 2005; johnson et al., 2007, 2012; meador, collier, & stein, 2002). using methods described by sloan et al. (2006, 2010) we measured concentrations of several toxicants in whole body composites of juvenile chinook salmon that were stratified geneti- cally. specifically, we used gas chromatography mass spectrometry to quantify concentrations (ng/g wet weight) of polychlorinated biphenyl (pcbs) congeners, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbde) congeners, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddts) and the following organo- chlorine pesticides: hexachlorobenzene (hcb), chlordanes and diel- drin. from these measurements, we combined compounds to create two variables: organochlorine pesticides and industrial contaminants. organochlorine pesticides included ddts, hcb, chlordanes and diel- drin, whereas industrial contaminants were represented by the sum of 40 pcb congeners and pbdes. details of specific ddt isomers and pcb and pbde congeners measured can be found in sloan et al. (2014). 2.6 | statistical analyses we used a generalised linear modelling (glm) approach to investi- gate the extent to which variability in somatic growth rate (dependent variable) was explained by a suite of independent variables (table 3). for all models, we used a gamma family distribution with a log link to account for the normally distributed, but positive, growth rate data. preliminary analyses indicated a nonlinear relationship between     |  861 growth rate and day of year, and therefore, day of year2 was also in- cluded in our analyses. in addition, fork length was included in our analyses so as to account for the linear relationship we observed be- tween growth rate and fish size (figure s1). water temperature was not included in this analysis because of insufficient data (only 64 of the 106 sampling events, table 1). because of the unbalanced design of this study (table 1), we ran glms on each of five data sets that dif- fered in terms of the number of variables and estimates of growth rate. the baseline data set included all of our estimates of somatic growth rate (n = 615) and six variables; year, day of year and day of year2, river discharge, off- channel distance, river kilometre and fork length (table 3). each of the remaining four data sets (stock and hatchery/unmarked, prey, conspecific and toxin) included these six variables, two to four additional variables, and a subset of the 615 es- timates of growth rate. for example, the stock and hatchery/unmarked data set included the variables stock and hatchery/unmarked, and had 531 estimates of growth rate (table 3). of the 84 estimates of growth rate that were excluded from the stock and hatchery/unmarked data set, 77 were removed because a stock was not assigned (i.e., genetic assignment probability was <0.8), six others were removed because a stock had a small sample size (n < 10; see table 2), and one more was removed because information was not recorded as to whether it was hatchery or unmarked fish. the prey, conspecific and toxin data sets had 472, 489 and 365 estimates of growth rate respectively (table 3). using the baseline data set, we ran all possible glm model combina- tions of the six variables (i.e., 63 combinations). all model parameters were estimated by maximising the likelihood function. to compare models, we calculated four values for each model; akaike’s information criterion (aic), delta aic, relative likelihood and aic weight. smaller aic values indicate “better” models, and when comparing two models, we calculated the difference in aic values (delta aic; akaike, 1973; burnham & anderson, 2002). a delta aic of less than 2 indicates little difference between com- peting models; a delta aic of 2–10 indicates moderate support for a difference between the models, and a delta aic of greater than 10 in- dicates strong support (burnham & anderson, 2002). relative likelihood represents the likelihood of a model given the data, whereas aic weight is the discrete probability of each model (burnham & anderson, 2002). the best model from the baseline data set was defined as having a delta aic of 0.00, although preference was given to the simplest model if two or more models had a delta aic of less than 2. this process was repeated for the other four data sets such that stock and hatchery/unmarked, prey, conspecific and toxin data sets had 255, 255, 1023 and 255 model combinations respectively. this al- lowed us to investigate whether the addition of, for example, prey richness and density (in the prey data set), explained more variability in somatic growth relative to the baseline model. 3 |  results a total of 615 otoliths were analysed from fish ranging in fork length from 37–111 mm (mean of 67 mm and

five data sets that were analysed using a generalised linear modelling approach: the baseline data set consisted of all 615 otolith- derived estimates of somatic growth and six independent variables. the other four data sets (stock and hatchery/unmarked, prey, conspecific and toxin) included the same six independent variables, an additional two to four variables, and a subset of the 615 estimates of somatic growth. per cent (%) events refer to the percentage of the 106 sampling events for which data of a given independent variable were collected independent variables % events baseline stock

(figure 2b). of these otoliths, 399 individuals (65%) were classified as unmarked, 215 as hatchery, and unrecorded for one individual. at the stock level, west cascades fall and spring creek fall stocks were the most numerous and accounted for 33% and 29%, respectively, of the 615 otoliths (figure 4 and table 2). lastly, four genetic stocks were excluded from our statistical analy- ses because of small sample sizes (i.e., one or two individuals). overall, our glm approach to understand what factors explain variability in somatic growth rate indicated the importance of where and when fish were collected. our glm analysis of the baseline data set indicated that three models were indistinguishable (table 4). in these three top models, variability in somatic growth rate was best explained by day of the year, day of the year2, year, river kilometre, and fork length, and to a lesser degree by off- channel distance and river discharge. of the three top models, the best model was also the simplest model (i.e., growth rate ~ day of the year + day of the year2 + year + river kilometre + fork length; hereafter referred to as the baseline model). the baseline model showed a significant negative relationship between growth rate and day of year, and a significant positive relationship was observed between growth rate and fork length, day of the year2, and river kilometre (figure 3a–d). also, growth rates in 2005 and 2007 were significantly higher than all other years, but these 2 years were not significantly different (note that in 2007, fish were only collected from one site; table 1). from the separate glm analyses on the four other data sets, we found that the baseline model was the best model from the prey and conspecific data sets (tables s3 and s4 respectively), while both the stock and hatchery/unmarked and toxin data sets showed improve- ments to the amount of variability explained. the best model in the stock and hatchery/unmarked data set in- cluded an interaction between stock and hatchery/unmarked, and it had a delta aic value that was 16.11 lower than the baseline model, suggesting that including both of these variables substantially im- proved explanatory power (table 5). anova’s indicated significant dif- ferences in growth rate between hatchery and unmarked fish for the upper columbia river summer/fall stock (f1,93 = 10.2; p = .0018), and

relationship between growth rate and day of year, and a significant positive relationship was observed between growth rate and fork length, day of year2 and river kilometre. also, growth rates in 2005 were significantly higher than all other years, except 2007 and 2009. analysis of the toxin data set indicated five models that were indis- tinguishable (table 6). each of these five models contained industrial contaminants, which suggested that toxins provided an improvement to explaining variability in growth rate relative to the baseline model. in fact, of these five models the best (and simplest model) had an aic value that was 2.29 lower than the baseline model (table 6). this best model showed a significant negative relationship between growth rate and day of year and industrial contaminants (figure 4c), and a significant positive relationship was observed between growth rate and fork length, day of year2 and river kilometre. also, growth rates in 2005 were significantly higher than all other years, except 2007. 4 |  discussion enhancing population viability often depends on improving the growth of individuals at early life stages such that overall survival improves (connor & tiffan, 2012; kareiva et al., 2000; zabel & achord, 2004). for anadromous chinook salmon, linking growth during their juvenile life stage to abiotic and biotic variables in estuarine habitats can provide an increased understanding of the factors and processes that influence performance and subsequent survival (macfarlane, 2010; neuswanger, wipfli, evenson, hughes, & rosenberger, 2015). such information would be particularly useful when designing restoration and mitigation efforts. from this 8- year study, we sought to understand how the per- formance of juvenile chinook salmon varied while they resided in estu- arine habitats of the columbia river. of the suite of variables analysed, we found that variability in relative growth rate was best explained by when (i.e., day of year and year) and where (i.e., river kilometre) fish were collected, fish size, and to a lesser degree by contaminants, ge- netic stock, and whether a fish was hatchery produced or unmarked. 4.1 | growth rate of hatchery and unmarked fish and among stocks of origin our examination of somatic growth of juvenile chinook salmon while they resided in estuarine habitats of the columbia river revealed that they grew at rates (0.31–0.87 mm/day; figure 2b) comparable to val- ues reported in studies of similar habitats (0.2–0.7 mm/day; healey, 1991; volk et al., 2010; goertler, simenstad,

(2010) (hatchery fish 0.47–0.49 mm/day; unmarked fish 0.44–0.54 mm/day respectively). in general, the comparable growth rates between hatchery and unmarked fish together with the fact that fish from both groups co- occurred throughout our study region suggested that hatchery and unmarked fish utilise the estuarine hab- itats in similar ways. however, within certain stocks we observed differences in somatic growth rate between hatchery and unmarked chittaro et al.866  |     ta b l e 5 results of the generalised linear modelling approach that assessed what independent variables explained variability in somatic growth rate in the stock and hatchery/unmarked data set. relative likelihood is the likelihood of a model given the data, and aic weight is the discrete probability of each model. only models that are indistinguishable (i.e., delta aic of ≤2.0) or had moderate support (i.e., delta aic of 2.0–10.0) are displayed model day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + stock*hatchery or unmarkeda day of year + day of year2 + year + river discharge + fork length + river kilometre + stock*hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + off- channel distance + stock*hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + river discharge + fork length + river kilometre + off- channel dis- tance + stock*hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + stock + hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + stock day of year + day of year2 + year + river discharge + fork length + river kilometre + stock + hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + off- channel distance + stock + hatchery or unmarked day of year + day of year2 + year + fork length + river kilometre + off- channel distance + stock day of year + day of year2 + year + river discharge + fork length + river kilometre + stock aic −1119.7 −1118.3 −1118.2 −1116.9 −1113.0 −1111.6 −1111.4 −1111.2 −1110.2 −1109.8 abest model. delta aic relative likelihood aic weight 0.00 1.44 1.51 2.86 6.75 8.11 8.33 8.57 9.52 9.94 1.00 0.49 0.47 0.24 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.43 0.21 0.20 0.10 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 fish. specifically, hatchery fish belonging to the upper columbia river summer/fall stock had significantly higher growth rate relative to unmarked fish, while hatchery fish from upper willamette river spring and west cascades spring stocks had a marginally significant higher growth rate than unmarked fish (figure 4b). this interac- tion between stock of origin and hatchery/unmarked with respect to growth rate suggested that hatchery- rearing conditions are not uniform among stocks, particularly those of spring and summer runs. differences in juvenile growth rate of wild chinook salmon were previously reported between evolutionary significant units (esu; i.e., snake river spring/summer and snake river fall) and were at- tributed to disparities in spawning season, geographic range, ge- netics and life history variability (zabel, haught, & chittaro, 2010). however, differences in growth rate were not observed among more closely related stocks within an esu (chittaro, zabel, haught, sanderson, & kennedy, 2014; zabel et al., 2010). although growth differences between fall and spring runs have been reported (zabel et al., 2010), it is unlikely to be a primary driver in our observed pattern of growth rate as our sampled fish overwhelmingly (76%) consisted of fall run compared to spring run (7%; the remaining fish were summer/fall run). given that growth rates in our study overlapped regardless of whether stocks were from the same esu or not might suggest the importance of environmental drivers, particularly related to the estuarine habitats. in fact, results from our generalised linear modelling (glm) approach demonstrated a greater importance of location (i.e., river kilometre) than stock in explaining variability in growth rate, as models with river kilometre had lower aic values than when river kilometre was replaced with stock. interestingly, in a similar study goertler et al. (2015) reported that genetic differences were not important in explaining variability in growth rate of chinook salmon. clearly, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence, if any, of stock on growth rate. one way to approach this question would be to conduct a common garden ex- periment whereby fish from different stocks are raised in common environments. 4.2 | growth rate and contaminants because of their migratory life history, chinook salmon are likely exposed to a suite of potentially toxic chemical contaminants (ross et al., 2013). in the columbia river, migrating fish must pass through agriculturally and industrially developed landscapes that contain contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), organochlo- rine pesticides including dichloro- diphenyl- trichloroethanes (ddts), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; trustee council 2007). although the contaminant exposures to migrating juveniles are likely sublethal, adverse effects such as decreased somatic growth have been reported (collier, johnson, stehr, myers, & stein, 1998;

van zyll de jong & cowx, 2016), and thus, knowing where juvenile performance is poor could be useful for planning and prioritising such actions. our analysis of the spatial variability in performance indicated a decreasing trend in growth rate towards the mouth of the columbia river of approximately 13% (figure 3c). a possible explanation to this spatial pattern of growth rate is the increased metabolic cost associated with maintaining homeostasis in brackish environments (enberg et al., 2012; morgan & iwama, 1991) that are characteristic of reach a and b (figure 3c; table s2 and simenstad et al., 2011). however, this putative impact of sa- linity on growth cannot explain the reported higher performance of ocean residing salmon given that the costs of homeostasis are greater in salt water than brackish estuarine water (webster & jill, 2006). it is also possible that fish in the lower reaches expend relatively more energy due to tidally created changes to water velocity (reach a–c; table s2 and simenstad et al., 2011), resulting in a trade- off in the energy available for somatic growth. for example, during higher water velocities in the sacramento river, juvenile chinook salmon were reported to display a more directional migration, suggesting that this was an energy saving behaviour (steel, sandstrom, brandes, & klimley, 2012). other studies have reported a negative effect of high river discharge on foraging success because of increased turbid- ity (arnekleiv, finstad, & rønning, 2006; enders, buffin- bélanger, boisclair, & roy, 2005; neuswanger, wipfli, rosenberger, & hughes, 2014; neuswanger et al., 2015). in our analysis, however, river dis- charge did not play an important role accounting for variability in growth rate among any of the data sets. other factors and processes that could limit performance in the estuarine habitats include food availability and quality, which is linked to intra- and interspecific density and predator density via competition and predation respectively. limm and marchetti (2009) and sommer, nobriga, harrell, batham, and kimmerer (2001) reported significant differences in growth rate of chinook salmon among various habitats (e.g., off- channel pond, main- channel, sea- sonal tributaries and floodplain) within sacramento river, such that higher growth rates were related to areas with greater prey con- sumption and presumed prey availability (sommer et al., 2001). and work by kaneko et al. (2015) reported a decrease in growth rate of chum salmon (oncorhynchus_keta) that was linked to intraspecific competition for food in an estuary following an intensive release of hatchery fish. in our study, reaches exhibiting lower performance (b and c, but reach a was only sampled in 1 year) had lower median prey density and richness and higher median nonsalmonid density (e.g., stickle- back, killifish, bass) than upriver reaches, suggesting an influence of food limitation and competition on growth rate (figure s2). however, results from our glm indicated that invertebrates and fish did little to explain variability in growth rate. this is not surprising given the     |  869 dissimilarity in temporal resolution measured by each variable; our measure of growth rate integrates over 7 days in the life of a fish, and our fish and invertebrate density and richness data are instan- taneous measurements of the community. further, growth rate is the cumulative product of interactions among many ecosystem com- ponents such as prey, predators, and habitat quality, quantity, and connectivity (searcy, eggleston, & hare, 2007). such interactions potentially limit the usefulness of somatic growth rate as an indica- tor of habitat quality. for example, chittaro et al. (2014) reported an overlap in somatic growth rate among sites that implied comparable habitat quality. but their bioenergetic investigation revealed that consumption rates differed due to the influence of temperature on metabolism. in this case, similarity in growth rates occurred despite fish residing in habitats that differed in quality. 4.4 | growth rate through time both day of year and year proved to explain a substantial amount of variability in growth rate regardless of data set. specifically, per- formance showed a negative nonlinear relationship to day of year, and across the 8 years of our study, we detected a slight decline in performance (of approximately 6%), with fish sampled in 2010 and 2011 showing the lowest growth rate (figure 3a,b). in 2010 and 2011, we observed relatively high median densities of chinook salmon and nonsalmonids (figure s3) and the summer- time (i.e., march–july) monthly maximum temperatures reached 21.1°c in 2010 and 20.0°c in 2011. these temperatures exceed the 19°c optimum for chinook salmon reported by brett, clarke, and shelbourn (1982) and could indicate instances of increased meta- bolic costs and an associated decrease in growth rate. these years of elevated temperatures together with the observed higher intra- and interspecific densities could interact to negatively influence growth rate. crozier et al. (2010), for example, found that growth correlated negatively with temperature at elevated densities, yet positively at lower densities. maximum monthly temperatures were also relatively high in 2009 (23.5°c) and 2013 (19.4°c), but our estimates of median growth rate for these years were greater than those for 2010 and 2011. since 2009 and 2013 had some of the lowest median densities of chinook salmon and nonsalmonids (figure s3), it is possible that the impacts to performance in 2009 and 2013 were relatively small than those in 2010 and 2011, despite the presence of warmer water. clearly, more empirical studies are needed to better understand how abiotic and biotic variables, like temperature and density, synergisti- cally influence juvenile fish performance. 4.5 | growth rate potential if a management objective is to improve adult survival via enhance- ments to juvenile performance, then we need to understand what level of performance is physiologically possible in order to gauge the effectiveness of mitigation and restoration efforts that target this life stage. we refer to this upper physiological threshold of chittaro et al.870  |     somatic growth rate as the growth rate potential. growth rates of chinook salmon reported in other studies suggest that the growth rate potential is likely to be greater than the growth rate we reported (figure 2b). for example, chinook salmon sampled upriver of our study by more than 450 river kilometres had growth rates that were almost two times greater than those we observed. specifically, growth rates ranged from 0.75–1.3 mm/day and 1.0–1.3 mm/day for juvenile chinook salmon from the snake river spring/summer esu sampled in the salmon and snake rivers respectively (achord, zabel, & sandford, 2007; connor, marshall, bjornn, & burge, 2001). although we did not analyse fish from the snake river spring/sum- mer esu, we did collect 12 individuals from the estuary that be- longed to the snake river fall esu. the median growth rate of these individuals was 0.57 mm/day. given that other studies conducted further upriver reported a higher growth rate for snake river fall esu fish than those from snake river spring/summer esu (zabel et al., 2010), we suspect that the growth rate potential for snake river fall fish is markedly higher than the 0.57 mm/day reported in this study. other studies have reported higher growth rates of chinook salmon collected from the ocean relative to those we observed from the estu- ary. for example, in an estuary in central california, juveniles grew, on average, at a rate of 0.3 mm/day, compared to 1.1 mm/day during the first 1–3 months in the ocean (macfarlane, 2010). similarly, juvenile chinook salmon that were captured in the ocean shortly after estua- rine residence in nanaimo and columbia rivers showed growth rates that ranged from 0.8–1.3 mm/day (healey, 1980) and 0.86–0.92 mm/ day (claiborne, miller, weitkamp, teel, & emmett, 2014) respectively. of our 615 analysed individuals, only 3% (i.e., 20 fish) had growth rates comparable to that reported for individuals sampled in the ocean (i.e., greater than 0.75 mm/day). although it is possible that the reported higher growth rates in the ocean result from the selection of faster growing fish, this reasoning does not explain the slower growth in the estuary relative to that of fish further upriver. interestingly, none of our fast- growing individuals were collected downriver of river kilometre 72 (i.e., whites island, reach c). these higher growth rates reported in juvenile chinook salmon upriver and soon after they enter the ocean underscores that considerable improvement to juvenile performance is physiolog- ically possible in these estuarine habitats. the question therefore becomes what mitigation actions can we use to improve juvenile growth rates in the estuary with the goal of improving survival to adulthood? unfortunately, the results of this study provide little guidance for restoration actions that could benefit juvenile salmon in the estuary given that factors identified to be strongly correlated to growth rate were primarily related to where and when fish were collected, and stock of origin, all of which managers have little con- trol over. further, the negative but relatively weak relationship be- tween growth rate and industrial contaminants contributes little to how growth rate could be improved. considerable gaps exist in our ecological knowledge of chinook salmon while they reside in estuarine habitats. for example, data on rearing duration and conditions and their effect on growth and survival are often unavailable or spatially and temporally limited in scale (hillgruber & zimmerman, 2009). the results from this rela- tively large spatial and temporal study provide a baseline of the performance of juvenile chinook salmon against which to compare future habitat and anthropogenic conditions in the columbia river and estuary. we also suggest that it is physiologically possible for juvenile chinook salmon to exhibit higher performance in these es- tuarine habitats and that the quantification of such improvements could be used to measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts. acknowledgements the authors are grateful to p. olson (nwfsc), c. corbett (estuary partnership), a. hanson (estuary partnership), b. anulacion (nwfsc), d. boyd (nwfsc), g. ylitalo (nwfsc) and d. kuligowski (nwfsc) for assistance with sampling and analysis. we would also like to thank a. fullerton, j. myers and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that greatly improved this manuscript. funding for this project was provided by the lower columbia estuary partnership and the bonneville power administration. the authors do not have a conflict of interest to declare. endnote 1 reference to trade names does not imply endorsement by the national marine fisheries service, noaa. orcid paul chittaro http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9310-7314 references achord, s., zabel, r. w., & sandford, b. p.
