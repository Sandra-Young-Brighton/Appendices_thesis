lahti & muje, 1991; linko, rajasilta, & hiltunen, 1992). reproductive suc- cess in late autumn is also highly dependent on lipid gain during the previous summer (ågren et al., 1987; lahti & muje, 1991; linko et al., 1992). for reproduction, the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) from the n- 6 and n- 3 families has been shown to be partic- ularly important (sargent, bell, mcevoy, tocher, & estevez, 1999). animals need pufa for various physiological processes, for example maintaining membrane fluidity and as precursors of local tissue hor- mones, but most organisms lack the ability to biosynthesise these molecules de novo and therefore must obtain them from their diet (glencross, 2009). in aquatic food webs, algae are the major source of n- 3 and n- 6 pufa (ahlgren, lundstedt, brett, & forsberg, 1990; brett, kainz, taipale, & seshan, 2009; taipale et al., 2013, 2016). although some fish species are able to synthesise the long- chained ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:533–541. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  533 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd534  |     pufa, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa 20:5n- 3), docosahexaenoic acid (dha, 22:6n- 3) and arachidonic acid (ara 20:4n- 6), from shorter c18 pufa, this process is generally regarded as inefficient (tocher, 2003). dietary epa and dha are shown to be important for optimal health and somatic growth of zooplankton and fish (ahlgren et al., 1990; mairesse, thomas, gardeur, & brun- bellut, 2007). in aquatic environ- ments, algae (phytoplankton and attached algae) are the main pro- ducers of epa and dha, but different algal classes have very distinct fatty acid compositions and they differ in their epa and dha content (ahlgren et al., 1990; galloway & winder, 2015; taipale et al., 2013). for example, cryptophytes and dinoflagellates are able to biosynthe- sise epa and dha, whereas green algae and cyanobacteria contain predominantly the shorter chained c18 pufa (α- linolenic acid, ala, 18:3n- 3). thus, the phytoplankton community composition strongly influences the food web processes and availability of pufa to upper trophic level consumers (brett & müller- navarra, 1997; galloway & winder, 2015; müller- navarra, brett, liston, & goldman, 2000; strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015; taipale et al., 2016). the knowledge on fatty acids in different basal resources can be applied for tracing the pathways of autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon flow in lake ecosystems (desvilettes, bourdier, amblard, & barth, 1997; galloway et al., 2014). although consumer- specific dif- ferences in lipid digestion and metabolism will modify the fatty acids at different trophic levels, specific fatty acids may be traced through several trophic levels (gladyshev et al., 2011; strandberg, hiltunen, et al., 2015). odd- chained and/or branched fatty acids are typically characterised as actinobacterial, whereas long- chain (≥24 carbon) sat- urated fatty acids are considered to originate from detrital terrestrial particulate organic matter (t- pom) (desvilettes et al., 1997; galloway et al., 2014; taipale, kankaala, hämäläinen, & jones, 2009). similarly, low n- 3/n- 6 ratio (<1) in zooplankton has been suggested to indicate an allochthonous diet (brett et al., 2009; taipale, kainz, & brett, 2015). in addition to dietary differences in fa composition, zooplankton fatty acid composition is taxon- specific (hiltunen, strandberg, taipale, & kankaala, 2015; persson & vrede, 2006; smyntek, teece, schulz, & storch, 2008). variation in the importance of autotrophic (algal) ver- sus heterotrophic (bacterial) production at the base of the food web may also influence the fatty acid composition and lipid accumulation of planktivorous fish. vendace (coregonus_albula (l.)) is a small (total length 10–25 cm) zooplanktivorous coregonid inhabiting large to medium- sized boreal lakes, and is the most important commercial fish in these lakes (marjomäki, keskinen, & karjalainen, 2016; viljanen, 1986). vendace is abundant in oligo- mesotrophic lakes with low to moderate humic content and well- oxygenated cooler water layers (dembiński, 1971; rask, viljanen, & sarvala, 1999; winfield, fletcher, & james, 2004). it is generally not present in small shallow lakes with high terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (doc) concentration due to the absence of a well- oxygenated hypolimnion. weight gain and biomass increase of planktivorous fish is strongly related to prey availability and abun- dance. in boreal lakes, the main feeding period for planktivorous ven- dace is summer, when zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are abundant (e.g. hamrin, 1983; helminen, sarvala, & hirvonen, 1990; viljanen, 1983). during the feeding season, vendace accumulate lipids in their tissues to ensure spawning in autumn and survival over winter (ågren et al., 1987; lahti & muje, 1991; linko et al., 1992). almost all vendace spawn for the first time during their second autumn (age 1+) and in intensively harvested vendace populations, up to 80% of all spawners belong to this age group (huusko & hyvärinen, 2005; karjalainen et al., 2016). we studied the composition and accumulation of fatty acids in pelagic food chains in large (>100 km2) boreal lakes in eastern finland with moderate (5–10 mg c l−1) doc concentrations (hiltunen et al., 2015; strandberg, hiltunen, et al., 2015; strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015). studies on fatty acids in phyto- and zooplankton in these lakes have been previously published (see hiltunen et al., 2015; strandberg, hiltunen, et al., 2015; strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015). here we focus on seasonal changes in vendace fatty acid composition and content during the feeding period before autumn spawning. we hypothesised that (i) the seasonal changes in phytoplankton community composi- tion, and concurrent changes in zooplankton fatty acid composition, modify fatty acid composition of planktivorous vendace; and (ii) resources of allochthonous origin play a minor role in vendace nutri- tion leading to low abundance of terrestrial and bacterial fatty acid biomarkers in vendace. 2 |  materials and methods pelagic food webs were studied in six large (area > 100 km2) lake basins in eastern finland. in 2011, we sampled lakes kallavesi, suvasvesi, orivesi, paasivesi and pyhäselkä. each lake was sampled three times: late may–early june (spring samples), late july–early august (summer samples) and at the end of september (autumn sam- ples). additional samples were collected from lake karjalan pyhäjärvi in august 2012. due to the lack of samples, data from the latter lake is presented separately and excluded from detailed analysis. all the lakes are hydrologically connected within the vuoksi water course (see hiltunen et al., 2015; for a map of the sampling area). the stud- ied lake basins are oligotrophic or mesotrophic with total phospho- rus concentrations varying between ca. 5–12 μg/l and chlorophyll a concentration ca. 2–6 μg/l (table 1). the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (doc) ranged from ca. 5 to 10 mg c l−1. for phyto- and zooplankton sampling, laboratory methods and detailed results see hiltunen et al. (2015) and strandberg, taipale, et al. (2015). the fish samples here are the same as in strandberg, hiltunen, et al. (2015). vendace were caught by gill netting (mesh sizes 13–14, 16–17 and 15–18 mm) or by trawling (mesh sizes 12 or 13 mm, trawl bottom 5 mm). for each sampling day and site, at least three random fish were taken for analyses and the weight and length of the fish were measured (total n = 52). although not systematically determined, presumably all caught individuals were mature based on their size (see table 2, lahti & muje, 1991; karjalainen et al., 2016). replicates of dorsal muscle tissue were dissected and stored in −70°c until fatty acid analyses. we also opportunistically analysed roe sam- ples. roe samples were collected from lakes paasivesi (n = 2), kallavesi strandberg et al.) l / g μ ( a l h c ) l / g μ ( p t o t ) l / g μ ( n t o t ) l / g m ( c o d ) m ( h t p e d i h c c e s .  3 0 ± 2 2  . .  6 2 ± 3 6  . .  1 1 ± 0 2  . .  0 1 ± 8 2  . .  9 0 ± 9 4  . .  0 1 ± 8 1 1  . .  2 3 ± 7 5  . .  3 7 ± 0 0 1  . .  8 0 ± 5 1  . .  6 0 ± 3 9  . .  3 1 ± 4 3  . .  1 7 ± 1 2 1  .  0 2 ± 8 2 2  2 3 ± 4 0 3  7 2 ± 9 4 3  2 4 ± 0 9 4  8 4 ± 9 9 3  7 0 1 ± 9 3 6  .  5 0 ± 3 5  . .  3 0 ± 0 7  . .  4 0 ± 4 8  . .  4 0 ± 8 8  . .  5 0 ± 5 9  . .  2 0 ± 2 0 1  . .  3 0 ± 1 5  . .  3 0 ± 1 2  . .  5 0 ± 5 2  . .  5 0 ± 1 3  . .  0 0 ± 9 1  . .  6 0 ± 3 2  . ) l / t p g m  (  r u o o c l 5 1  0 1 ± 8 2  6 ± 3 4  3 ± 2 3  6 ± 7 5  5 ± 5 4   a e r a e c a f r u s ) 2 m k ( ) m ( h t p e d n a e m  i s e t a n d r o o c n i s a b e k a l  7 4 2 1 0 6 4 2 1 3 3 2 1 6 3 8 7 4 8 8 . 9 1 2 . 4 0 1 8 8 . 6 8 . e ′ 2 5 ° 9 2  ;

anderson, 2001) was used to test for differences in vendace fatty acid composi- tion between different seasons (fixed factor) and lake basins (random factor). vendace sampled from karjalan pyhäjärvi only in august 2012 were excluded from the analyses. prior to the multivariate analyses, the fatty acid data was arcsine square root transformed. ordination was based on euclidean distances, where samples close to another are compositionally more similar than samples further apart. goodness of fit for the ordination is expressed as the stress value. the lower the stress, the better objects are fitted in the multidimensional space. the significance of permanova analyses was determined using unre- stricted permutation of the raw data (9,999 permutations) with type iii sums of squares (anderson, gorley, & clarke, 2008). multivariate anal- yses (mds, permanova) were carried out with primer 6.0 with the permanova+ add- on. other statistical analyses were carried out with ibm spss statistics 23 program package. correlations between the total fatty acid content and the proportions of pufa, monoun- saturated fatty acids (mufa), bacterial fatty acids (bafa, iso- and  t s u g u a y l r a e  , e n u j – y a m n  i l l   d e p m a s h t p e d m 4 – 0 r o f d e o o p s r e h t o e h t d n a h t p e d m 1 m o r f e r a r u o o c r o f s e u a v e h t    l l . l i  d n a n f n r e t s a e e h t n  i s n i s a b e k a l x i s n i s e t i s g n i l p m a s e h t t a a l l y h p o r o h c l  d n a s u r o h p s o h p l a t o t , n e g o r t i n l a t o t , c o d f o s n o i t a r t n e c n o c d n a h t p e d i h c c e s l , r u o o c r e t a w ) d s ± ( n a e m s a l l e w s a s e k a l i d e d u t s e h t f o a e r a e k a l l a t o t d n a h t p e d n a e m  , n o i t a c o l   1   e l b a t strandberg et al.536  |     table 2 length, weight and fatty acid content of vendace sampled from five large boreal lakes in spring ( n = 15), summer (n = 18) and autumn (n = 15). values are mean (±sd). approximate lipid content (lipid %) in the muscle tissue was calculated assuming that fatty acids comprise 70% of all lipids in fish muscle (ahlgren et al., 1996). the fatty acid content of the muscle tissue and the weight of vendace as well as condition index (fulton’s k) were significantly lower in spring than in summer or autumn (marked with +;

figure 3). this was mainly due to decreasing proportion of dha, from ~40 ± 4% in spring, to 29 ± 7% in summer and 32 ± 4% in autumn, although the dha content in vendace muscle remained at the same level (spring 6.9 ± 1.5, summer 7.3 ± 1.6, autumn 8.0 ± 1.2 mg/g dw). the seasonal increase in the total fatty acid content in the muscle tissue was mainly due to accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids (sum of c14, c16 and c18 mufa), c18 and c20 pufa, where proportions correlated pos- itively with increasing fatty acid content (figure 3). the n- 3/n- 6 pufa ratio in vendace muscle varied between 3.2 and 10.0 (mean 6.0 ± 1.3), decreasing as total fatty acid content increased (r = −.584, p < .001). proportion of bafa in vendace muscle varied from less than 0.5% to 4% and correlated positively with the total fatty acid content of fish (r = .864, p < .001, figure 3). low proportions (≤0.5%) of isoprenoid fatty acids, 4,8,12- trimethyltridecanoic (4,8,12- tmtd) and 3,7,11,15 - tetramethylhexadecenoic (phytanic) acids were also detected. trace values of very long- chained pufa (≥24 carbons) were found in the summer samples (mean of all summer samples 0.1%). traces (<0.1%) of lignoceric acid (24:0) was detected in the muscle of only 15% of the studied fish, while in most fish 24:0 was not found at all. the most abundant fatty acids in vendace roe, sampled in autumn, were generally the same as in the muscle of adult fish (table s2). pufa accounted for about 48% of all fatty acids in the roe, but the propor- tion of dha (~16%) was significantly lower (mann–whitney u test, p < .001) than what was analysed from the muscle tissue in autumn. the total fatty acid content in roe was about 10 times higher than total fatty acid content of the muscle tissue in the autumn (279 ± 35 mg/g dw). the mean dha content of roe was ~44 ± 8 mg/g dw. 4 |  discussion the content and composition of fatty acids in vendace muscle tissue changed significantly from spring to autumn. the low fatty acid con- tent in spring can be explained by depletion of internal energy stores during spawning in autumn and by limited food availability in winter (ågren et al., 1987). summer is the main feeding period for vendace, and the 1.6- fold increase in total fatty acid content from spring to sum- mer reflects the accumulation of lipids and building of internal energy stores in preparation for reproduction and overwintering (ågren et al., 1987; lahti & muje, 1991). fatty acids that most contributed to the increase in total fatty acid content were mufa (particularly 16:1n- 7, 18:1n- 9) and c18 pufa (18:2n- 6, 18:3n- 3, 18:4n- 3), whereas long- chain polyunsaturated dha declined from ca. 40% in spring to 30% in summer. similar trends of declining proportion of c22 pufa and increasing proportion of c18 pufa was also seen in calanoid copepods (limnocalanus macrurus, eudiaptomus spp.) in the study lakes (hiltunen et al., 2015; table 3). 70 strandberg et al.table 3 average (±sd) proportion (%) of saturated fatty acids (sfa), monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (separately for c18, c20 and c22 pufa) in seston (0.22– 50 μm) plfa (from strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015), and total fatty acids of major zooplankton taxa (from hiltunen et al., 2015) and in vendace during spring, summer and autumn in five lakes (names in table 1) in eastern finland (n = 21–48 in each) 538  |     fa class sfa mufa c18 pufa c20 pufa c22 pufa bafa group/taxa seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace seston cladocera limnocalanus eudiaptomus cyclopoida vendace spring 26.6 ± 4.0a 36.8 ± 3.9a 30.2 ± 4.9a 31.3 ± 4.7a 35.6 ± 5.4a 33.6 ± 3.8 16.4 ± 6.3 24.2 ± 6.3 12.9 ± 3.7 13.9 ± 3.0a 13.8 ± 3.2 7.2 ± 2.2a 29.5 ± 7.0 18.8 ± 3.6 7.5 ± 1.6a 16.6 ± 4.3a 16.5 ± 6.0a 2.9 ± 2.4a 16.1 ± 2.5a 15.7 ± 5.6 19.1 ± 4.6a 13.2 ± 2.2 13.1 ± 2.9a 13.4 ± 1.7a 9.5 ± 3.6a 0.7 ± 0.4 28.5 ± 3.3a 19.5 ± 4.6a 16.9 ± 3.6 42.4 ± 4.1a 1.5 ± 0.9 4.2 ± 1.8 3.4 ± 1.8a 5.0 ± 1.6a 5.4 ± 2.6 0.9 ± 0.4 summer 36.9 ± 6.8b 36.5 ± 4.9a 12.1 ± 3.2b 40.4 ± 6.1b 45.3 ± 7.1b 33.0 ± 2.6 19.0 ± 2.2 24.0 ± 4.2 15.0 ± 3.0 7.6 ± 0.6b 10.6 ± 4.2 12.2 ± 4.0b 30.5 ± 5.1 19.0 ± 3.6 14.2 ± 2.9b 16.2 ± 4.2a 15.7 ± 3.1a 7.2 ± 3.5b 7.1 ± 3.9b 16.9 ± 6.1 25.3 ± 2.1b 13.0 ± 2.3 9.5 ± 2.7b 15.1 ± 1.6b 2.4 ± 2.7b 0.5 ± 0.6 23.2 ± 3.4b 19.5 ± 2.2a 15.7 ± 2.6 31.3 ± 6.8b 2.2 ± 1.1 4.6 ± 1.1 1.2 ± 0.7b 3.4 ± 0.7b 5.4 ± 1.3 1.5 ± 0.9 autumn 29.7 ± 9.1a,b 30.3 ± 2.0b 14.0 ± 3.3b 28.1 ± 1.6a 29.8 ± 8.2a 32.6 ± 2.3 20.8 ± 3.9 27.6 ± 4.8 15.9 ± 2.0 9.5 ± 1.4c 14.0 ± 6.6 10.8 ± 2.8b 31.4 ± 5.4 17.7 ± 5.1 17.1 ± 2.1c 27.9 ± 3.8b 23.0 ± 9.5b 5.8 ± 2.0b 10.6 ± 2.4b 19.6 ± 2.1 23.6 ± 1.4b 13.6 ± 1.0 13.2 ± 2.7a 15.5 ± 1.7b 2.8 ± 1.7b 0.4 ± 0.7 23.2 ± 2.8b 13.7 ± 2.1b 14.8 ± 3.0 34.5 ± 4.2b 2.3 ± 0.8 5.0 ± 0.3 1.2 ± 0.3b 4.3 ± 0.5a 4.8 ± 1.8 1.0 ± 0.3 different superscript letters denote significant between- season difference in the relative proportion of the specific fa class within each group/taxa (anova, games–howell post hoc test). the seasonal trends in fatty acid composition of vendace and zooplankton corresponded with changes in the phytoplankton com- munity composition (strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015). in seston (frac- tion 0.22–50 μm), the most abundant group of fatty acids were the c18 pufa, ~30% of all fatty acids during all the seasons (strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015; table 3). c18 pufa is common in a wide variety of algal groups, including cryptophytes and chrysophytes, as well as green algae and cyanobacteria (taipale et al., 2013), thus explaining the abundance and availability of c18 pufa in the pelagic food chain throughout the sampling season. cryptophytes and diatoms were the most abundant phytoplankton groups in all the lakes and seasons, but the proportion of dinoflagellates decreased and the proportion of cya- nobacteria and green algae increased from spring to fall (strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015). dinoflagellates are abundant source of dha and the decrease in the abundance of dinoflagellates from spring to summer coincided with the decrease of dha in seston (strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015) as well as in zooplankton and vendace (table 3), thus, supporting our first hypothesis. strandberg et al.zooplankton is an important link for the transfer of energy and nutrients from producers to upper trophic level consumers. in pelagic food webs, epa and dha originating from seston accumulate in zooplankton and fish (kainz, arts, & mazumder, 2004; strandberg, hiltunen, et al., 2015). the general fatty acid composition of ven- dace muscle tissue was characterised by a high proportion of pufa (45%–65% of all fatty acids), which was similar in magnitude to cope- pod zooplankton, but greater than in cladocerans and seston (hiltunen et al., 2015; strandberg, hiltunen, et al., 2015; table 3). taxonomic dif- ferences in fatty acid composition between cladocerans and copepods might be an important factor determining the transfer of fatty acids to vendace. cladocerans are known to efficiently retain c20 pufa (epa and ara), but almost completely lack c22 pufa, whereas copepods are abundant in dha (hiltunen et al., 2015; persson & vrede, 2006; smyntek et al., 2008). stomach content analyses have indicated that vendace predomi- nately prey on cladocerans in summer (hamrin, 1983; viljanen, 1983), corresponding with the decline of dha proportion in vendace from spring to summer. the dominance of cladocerans in vendace diet in summer was also observed in our study lakes, pyhäselkä and kallavesi, where ~90% of prey remains in vendace guts (n = 13) consisted of cla- docerans (m. viljanen & a. lehtovaara, unpublished data). in autumn, vendace diet has been suggested to shift more to copepods (northcote & hammar, 2006). this shift could be expected to increase the propor- tion and content of dha in the muscle; however, we did not observe any such pattern. allocation of dha to reproduction may also partly explain why copepod diet was not clearly reflected in the muscle fatty acid composition (dabrowski, 1982; pickova, kiessling, pettersson, & dutta, 1999; tocher, 2003). nevertheless, the high proportion of dha (on average 34% of all fatty acids) in vendace muscle suggests that copepods are an important prey item. alternatively, vendace may have elongated and desaturated shorter chain n- 3 pufa (e.g. 18:3n- 3 and/ or 20:5n- 3) to produce dha. coregonid coregonus_lavaretus maraena has been shown to biosynthesise dha from shorter chained analogues (watanabe et al., 1989), suggesting that vendace may also elongate shorter chained fatty acids to dha. however, it remains questionable if this metabolic pathway would be efficient enough to result in high proportions of dha, analysed in vendace muscle (kaitaranta, 1980; muje, ågren, lindqvist, & hänninen, 1989). additionally, the very long- chained polyunsaturated fatty acids (c24–c26 pufa), which are specific biomarkers for the large copepod limnocalanus macrurus (hiltunen, strandberg, keinänen, taipale, & kankaala, 2014), were found in ven- dace muscle, demonstrating a clear dietary link between the copepod and vendace. reproductive success is highly dependent on lipid reserves in many fish because the formation of gonads is very energy intensive and the produced eggs need to be provisioned with lipids (marshall, yaragina, lambert, & kjesbu, 1999; pickova et al., 1999; tocher, 2003). the fatty acid content of vendace roe was high (279 ± 35 mg/g) demonstrating that reproduction requires substantial allocation of lipids, particularly in females (lahti & muje, 1991). about 50% of fatty acids in roe were pufa, and although the proportion of dha in roe was lower than in the muscle tissue, due to the high total fatty acid     |  539 content, the amount of dha in roe was about 6 times higher than in the muscle tissue. we could not find any between- lake differences in the fatty acid composition and content of vendace. this may be partly due to low number of analysed individuals per lake, but presumably also due to the similarity of the sampled lakes, which are interconnected in the vuoksi water course (table 1). although some differences in phyto- plankton community structure in relation to doc concentration was observed in the study lakes, taxonomic identity was the most import- ant determinant (62%) of zooplankton fatty acid composition and the role of environmental factors was minor (hiltunen et al., 2015). the proportion of dha was much lower (~13%, linko et al., 1992) in vendace of mesotrophic säkylän pyhäjärvi (sw finland) compared to vendace in our study lakes suggesting lower availability of dha from phytoplankton via zooplankton to vendace. lake trophic state and increased nutrient concentrations with concurrent changes in phyto- plankton community composition is connected to decreasing epa and dha in a predatory fish, the eurasian perch (perca fluviatilis, taipale et al., 2016). in contrast to our study lakes, lake säkylän pyhäjärvi has suffered from eutrophication and experiences occasionally cyanobac- teria blooms (ventelä et al., 2011), which may influence the availability of dha to vendace. phytoplankton are the ultimate source of pufa in pelagic food web, but other basal resources may be important in providing energy and specific fatty acids. for instance, branched and odd- chained fatty acids are thought to originate from bacterial production (taipale et al., 2009), which utilise both phytoplankton- derived and terrestrial- origin doc as a carbon source (e.g. pérez & sommaruga, 2006; simon, cho, & azam, 1992). the proportion of bafa in the seston was ~2% (strandberg, taipale, et al., 2015) and in zooplankton ~1%–5% (hiltunen et al., 2015), indicating that bacterial fatty acids are incor- porated into the pelagic food web but have a low contribution. this suggests that bafa are not markedly utilised for biomass increase and lipid deposition in vendace. however, the proportion of bafa increased with increasing lipid content in vendace, indicating direct dietary input. as fatty acid content in actinobacteria is relatively low (taipale et al., 2014), it is not surprising that the proportion of bafa in vendace was minimal (0.5%–4%) in comparison with algae- derived pufa. in an oligotrophic clear- water alpine lake, lake annecy (area 28 km2), whitefish (coregonus_lavaretus) larvae contained similar pro- portions (2%–4%) of bafa (perga, bec, & anneville, 2009). various fatty acid biomarkers have been applied to estimate autochthonous and allochthonous sources of fatty acids in aquatic biota. increased proportions of n- 6 pufa (e.g. 18:2n- 6) and lower n- 3/n- 6 ratio may indicate the abundance of terrestrially derived fatty acids, as n- 6 pufa are generally more abundant in terrestrial than aquatic environments (hixson, sharma, kainz, wacker, & arts, 2015). a low n- 3/n- 6 ratio (<1) in fish and zooplankton may indicate a significant contribution of terrestrial fatty acids (ahlgren, sonesten, boberg, & gustafsson, 1996; taipale et al., 2015). in the current study, the mean n- 3/n- 6 ratio in vendace was high; varying from 3 to 10, suggesting that allochtho- nous resources would not directly contribute to vendace diet. another suggested indicator for terrestrial fatty acids is lignoceric acid (c24:0; strandberg et al.540  |     perga et al., 2009). in the current study, only 15% of the studied fish contained trace levels of 24:0 (<0.1% of total fatty acids). thus, our second hypothesis was supported. in lake annecy, zooplankton and whitefish larvae contained higher, but still small, proportions of 24:0 (0.5%–2.9% of total fatty acids; perga et al., 2009). however, labora- tory feeding experiments indicate that 24:0 is not efficiently assim- ilated by cladocerans or copepods, suggesting that this fatty acid is a poor indicator of terrestrial contribution in consumer diets (taipale et al., 2015; s. taipale, unpublished data). our results indicate that the commercially important planktivorous fish, vendace, is dependent on the algae- based food chain for deposi- tion of internal energy stores in summer. compared to algal fatty acids, the proportion of terrestrial and microbial fatty acid biomarkers were low suggesting that the utilisation of terrestrial resources in pelagic food webs of large boreal lakes is limited. the importance of algae- derived fatty acids in biomass increase and fatty acid accumulation in vendace is ecologically significant because the survival of coregonids in winter depends on body condition and presence of sufficient lipid stores (pangle, sutton, kinnunen, & hoff, 2004). additionally, repro- ductive success is linked with the accumulation of these lipids, partic- ularly dha (sargent et al., 1999). acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the staff of r/v muikku: matti jalkanen and jukka kettunen, as well as kari ratilainen and tuomo nielsen (university of eastern finland), jukka kerman (lake suvasvesi), esa hirvonen and markku gavrilov (finnish game and research institute) for their fishing efforts and jarmo mononen (pohjois- savon kalatalouskeskus;
