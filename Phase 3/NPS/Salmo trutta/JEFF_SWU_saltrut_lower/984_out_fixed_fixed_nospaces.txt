(2013) examined the impact of an extraordinary drought on the diversity of fish assem- blages in floodplain lakes in the brazilian amazon and found that regional species richness could not be characterised by species richness in a single lake, and suggested that this might be an important consider- ation in the design of conservation areas. the partitioning of regional species diversity, or landscape biodiversity (veech et al. 2002), has proved to be especially fruitful in determining the contribution of different spatial scales and habitat types (er€os 2007). whittaker (1972) first proposed the existence of spatial components for diversity: a (alpha) diversity referring to the diversity within indi- vidual communities; b (beta) diversity based on dif- ferences among communities within a region and c (gamma) diversity, which represent regional diversity, essentially a combination of a and b (wilsey 2010). total correspondence: c. e. c. freitas, federal university of amazonas, department of fisheries sciences, av. gen. rodrigo otavio, 3000. manaus 69077-000, am, brazil. e-mail: cefreitas@ufam.edu.br 470 doi: 10.1111/eff.12099 alpha, beta and gamma components of diversity are among the fundamental descriptive variables of ecology and conservation biology (jost 2007), because they allow us to look at the relative contribu- tion of local and regional patterns to biodiversity. we can also test different hypotheses about the processes is, whether b that generate regional variety, diversity is a result of local biological interactions such as competition and predation that can result in uniform regional species composition, or of spatially limited dispersal resulting in nonrandom patchiness across a region (legendre et al. 2005). dispersal among habitat patches within a region is an important component of landscape ecology and models of meta- community dynamics (holyoak et al. 2005). that the question of how different spatial scales con- tribute to regional biodiversity is an important consid- eration for conservation biology, because the relative importance of one or more hierarchical spatial levels can drive the development of strategies for preserva- tion of diversity. as discussed by baselga et al. (2007), b diversity can be a result of two processes: nestedness and species turnover. nestedness occurs when the fish assemblages of sites with lower diver- sity are subsets of fish assemblages of sites with higher diversity (wright & reeves 1992). species turnover results from environmental, spatial and his- torical differences among sites (baselga et al. 2007). studies of b diversity may be particularly important for human-dominated landscapes, where habitat mod- ification can lead to homogenisation of ecological communities (er€os 2007). however, quasi-natural events such as periodic drought exacerbated by glo- bal warming may promote a homogenisation of the landscape and consequently a reduction of beta diver- sity, as observed by freitas et al. (2013) for amazo- nian floodplain lakes. floodplain from amazonian there have been many studies aimed at measuring the alpha diversity (local species richness) of fish assemblages lakes (merona & bittencourt 1993; saint-paul et al. 2000; merona & rankin-de-merona 2004; siqueira-souza & freitas 2004). these studies have revealed species richness between 77 and 239 species, with a striking prevalence of species within the orders characifor- mes and siluriformes. these relatively high values of local richness have been considered to explain the high regional diversity of fish at the ama- zon basin, where half of the total number of fish spe- cies estimated for the entire neotropic reside (reis et al. 2003). however, the contribution of diversity at different spatial scales has yet to be examined. species within the amazon basin ecosystem, floodplains adjacent to large white water rivers comprise a com- plex mosaic of lakes, floodplain channels, scroll bars and overbank deposits (mertes et al. 1996). these scales of fish diversity in floodplain lakes environments are distinguishable on the basis of geo- morphology and other environmental characteristics that produce different selective regimes that undoubt- edly account for much of the adaptive radiation of fish in this region (soares et al. 2007; freitas et al. 2010a; hoorn et al. 2010). in addition to spatial het- erogeneity, the system is temporally dynamic, charac- terised by an annual hydrologic cycle with dramatic changes in water depth that create flooded forests in the floodplains adjacent to the rivers during high water, through which fish can move, and relatively isolated floodplain lakes during low water (junk et al. 1989). we partitioned diversity into three spa- tial lake; b1 = diversity among lakes of the same type (coastal or island locations); and b2 = diversity between the two types of lakes, such that b1 + b2 does not have to equal ∑a. this approach is similar to that sug- gested by legendre et al. (2005) that the variance estimated from a community composition table is a correct measure of beta diversity for a three-level framework to describe diversity. a = diversity within scales: each materials and methods study area the ten study lakes were situated at the lower stretch of the solim~oes river (amazonas – brazil) and are included in the typology of wetlands subjected to pre- dictable, long-lasting, monomodal flood pulses (junk et al. 2011). these are river floodplains with high flood amplitudes (up to 10 m near the confluence between the solim~oes and negro rivers), adjacent to a large river, exhibiting high fertility (sch€ongart & junk 2007; junk et al. 2011). within the floodplain, there are two main lentic environments, called var- zea, with characteristic features: lakes on fluvial islands in the main river channel (island lakes) and lakes that are formed on the floodplains at the mar- gins of the river that also have connections to small streams originating on the floodplains (coastal lakes) (mertes et al. 1996). the five island lakes in our study were sacambu, preto, piranha, ressaca and cacau, all of which are on the same island. these shallow lakes were formed behind scroll bars that were formed by the overbank deposition of fine material. by this procedure, the current in the main channel builds levees that tend to restrict the movement of the main channel and flood- plain channels (mertes et al. 1996). the five coastal lakes were preto, iauara, anana, aracßa and maraca (fig. 1). all lakes were located along a 300 km stretch of the solim~oes river between the mouth of the coari river and the confluence of the solim~oes and negro rivers in brazil. all of these were typical 471 freitas et al. fig. 1. the 10 sampled lakes of the floodplain of the solim~oes river in 2006, located between the mouth of the coari and the confluence of the solim~oes and negro rivers (amazonas – brazil). above: the five coastal lakes are preto, iauara, anana, aracßa and maraca. below: the five island lakes are sacambu, preto, piranha, ressaca and cacau. amazonian floodplain lakes that contain water even during the low-water season of the hydrologic cycle (junk et al. 1989). data collection during 2006, collections of fish were made in all ten lakes, once during each of the four seasons of the hydrologic cycle: march (rising water), june (flood- ing), late august-early september (receding water) and late november-early december (low water). we collected fish from populations at each location and season with nine monofilament gillnets of differ- ent mesh sizes: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 mm of stretch size. nets of each mesh size were 20 m long 9 2 m deep and were attached to each other, resulting in an overall length of 180 m per set for each lake. nets were attached to floats so that they hung downward from the surface of the water, set out in the morning between 0500 and 0600 h, and brought in with the catch 12 h later. fish caught during the morning hours were also collected from the nets at midday in order to reduce the damage made by piranhas and other predators that nibbled on the entangled fish. fish were identified and preserved in formalin for permanent storage in the zoological collection of the national institute for amazonian research (inpa) in manaus, brazil. each time we collected fish from the nets, we measured dissolved oxygen and surface temperature with a multiparame- ters equipment model hanna hi 9828. depth was measured using a weighted rope. as we did not 472 evaluate seasonal effects, we used the mean of each measure taken at the two extreme seasons of the hydrological cycle, for example, mean depth = (depth at high water + depth at low water)/2). data analysis we measured a diversity for each lake as species richness (sl) and used a global measure of beta diver- sity = s/a, where s is the total number of species col- lected from all lakes, representing c diversity, and a is the mean number of species observed at each lake (whittaker 1972). this approach gives us a measure of b-diversity that represents how many more species are present in the whole area than at an average site (legendre et al. 2005). we also applied the multiple- site dissimilarity measures proposed by baselga et al. (2007) and baselga (2010), because of their ability to identify the predominance of species loss or species turnover in communities. in addition to species rich- ness, we calculated shannon’s diversity index using loge and pielou’s evenness using the software paleon- tological statistic software package – past, version 2.07 (hammer et al. 2001). after testing homogene- ity of variances (which was verified for our compari- sons), we compared species richness, abundance, shannon index and evenness between the two types of lakes with a t-test using r software (r develop- ment core team 2012). we applied the package vegan (oksanen et al. 2010) from r software (r development core team 2010) for analysis of fish diversity partitioning. the observed species richness among and within lakes provided the input data for an analysis of null models with 10,000 random assemblages (crist et al. 2003). we used this method to test the hypothesis that the fish diversity at each level was a result of a random assemblage of individuals. null hypothesis models are considered a powerful statistical tool for the anal- ysis of diversity partitioning across multiple scales (gotelli & graves 1996). finally, we applied a discri- minant analysis to the environmental data to evaluate if environmental variables explain a significant pro- portion of the community composition variation. results we collected a total of 116 species, belonging to six orders and 21 families, and a total of 7867 individu- als (appendix s1). species richness, pooled for the four hydrologic seasons, varied from 36 to 63 species and abundance varied between 226 and 1399, with values consistently higher in coastal lakes than in (t = 2.425, d.f. = 8, p = 0.041 and island lakes t = 6.059, d.f. = 8, p < 0.001, respectively: table 1). the shannon index was quite similar for both types of scales of fish diversity in floodplain lakes lakes (t =  0.159, d.f. = 8, p = 0.875), with esti- mates between 2.852 and 3.340 (table 1). evenness also was quite similar (t =  1.892, d.f. = 8, p = 0.095), with estimates between 0.722 and 0.867. char- aciformes and siluriformes were the most abundant groups, both in number of species and abundance, for both types of lakes. the serrasalmid, pygocentrus nat- tereri, was the most abundant species in coastal lakes, and the small curimatid, potamorhina altamazonica, was the most abundant species in island lakes (appen- dix s1). there were 72 species shared between the two lake types; however, 32 species were exclusively found in coastal lakes and 12 species exclusively in island lakes. our measure of overall b-diversity by the whittak- er (1972) equation was 2.2, indicating that more than twice, the number of species is expected for the whole area than occurred at each lake. our estimate of simpson-based multiple-site dissimilarity index was 0.617, and the nested resultant multiple-site dis- similarity was 0.069. partitioning analysis shows that the diversity within each lake and among the lakes of same type, a and b1, respectively, were the main components of gamma diversity (table 2, fig. 2), with a total contribution of approximately 80%. the contribution of b2 was approximately 20% (see appendix s1). the analysis by null models revealed that a diver- sity was not significantly different than for expected by random chance (p > 0.05). in contrast, b1 diver- sity was higher than expected (p < 0.05), which is an indication of the high turnover at this spatial scale. b2 was not different from random expectation (p > 0.05). the importance of components a and b1 was higher in coastal lakes (91.7% of contribution to table 1. species richness (sl), abundance (n), shannon’s index (h′) and evenness (e) of fish assemblages from two geomorphological types of amazonian floodplain lakes of the solim~oes river (amazonas – brazil, 2006). comparisons of species richness, abundance, shannon index and evenness between the two types of lakes with a t-test using r software (r development core team 2010). lake s1 n h′ e coastal preto iauara anana aracßa maraca mean (sd) island ressaca sacambu preto cacau piranha mean (sd) 49 51 60 52 63 1399 1028 1213 1342 949 55 (6.12) 1186 (194.66) 55 43 47 44 36 773 349 244 293 226 45 (6.89) 377 (226.46) 2.975 2.938 3.054 2.853 3.212 3.01 (0.14) 2.952 2.879 3.340 3.087 2.852 3.02 (0.20) 0.764 0.747 0.746 0.722 0.775 0.75 (0.02) 0.737 0.765 0.867 0.816 0.796 0.80 (0.05) 473 freitas et al. table 2. mean species richness of fish assemblages sampled in 10 floodplain lakes of the solim~oes river (amazonas – brazil, 2006), partitioned between a, b1, b2 and c spatial scales. partitioning of species richness was analysed with the software package vegan (oksanen et al. 2010) from r software (r development core team 2010). the observed species richness among and within lakes provided the input data for an analysis of null models in which estimated (expected) values were generated from 10,000 random assemblages (crist et al. 2003). diversity spatial scale observed estimated contribution to c (%) a b1 b2 c within lakes among lakes between types total 51.4 43.6 21 116 49.7 38.3 22 44.91 36 19.09 p 0.00023 0.00006 0.00087 table 3. mean values of dissolved oxygen (do), surface temperature, and depth of five coastal (c) and five island (i) lakes of the lower solim~oes river (amazonas – brazil, 2006). means of all values are calculated as follows: (value high water +value at low water)/2. lakes coastal iauara campina preto anana maraca mean sd island sacambu preto piranha ressaca cacau mean sd 11 10 h t p e d 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 28.5 do (ppm) temp.

(wilks’ and 474 coastal lakes differ substantially, both in fish species composition and with respect to the relative contribu- tion of beta diversity to regional diversity. thus, a diversity by itself does not represent the diversity of fish species well, since at least half of regional diver- sity for both lake types is contributed by b-diversity. according to one hypothesis, landscapes are mosa- ics where species composition is controlled by envi- ronmental characteristics peculiar to individual sites (legendre et al. 2005; willis et al. 2005). the high estimate of beta diversity revealed by our multiplica- tive approach, and the high estimates of simpson- based multiple-site dissimilarity (i.e., high species turnover), coupled with the low value obtained for nestedness resultant multiple-site dissimilarity, tend to indicate that this may be true for amazonian floodplain lakes. our relatively high estimate of b1 diversity, mainly for coastal lakes, means that all lakes within a type are not equivalent. therefore, large tracts of floodplain encompassing many lakes may have to be set aside to maintain regional diver- sity (magurran et al. 2011). the cyclical influence of the flood pulse (junk et al. 1989) could create a situation such that the spe- cies composition of fish from amazonian floodplain lakes fluctuates with both variation in pulse dynamics (abiotic force) and interaction potentials among spe- cies such as predation and competition (biotic force). the interconnectivity among lakes and rivers in which these forces fluctuate in importance could thus promote a metacommunity pattern with source and sink dynamics (leibold et al. 2004; urban 2004). freitas et al. (2010b) observed the importance of interconnectedness to maintain the fish diversity of island lakes in the solim~oes river during the flood season when floodplain lakes are connected with the main river channel. however, the effects of this high interconnection during the flood season can also include a prevalence of stochastic processes on com- munity structure and composition (miyazono et al. 2010; scarabotti et al. 2011). for example, freitas & garcez (2004) found fish assemblages to be stochas- tically structured at the channels between floodplain lakes and the solim~oes river, hypothetically because these channels are temporary aquatic habitats. the relatively higher b2 diversity we found for island lakes could be a consequence of their greater connec- tivity with the main river than coastal lakes have. in the river stretch where our study lakes are located, scroll lakes are mixed with rounder, larger lakes (mertes et al. 1996), increasing the spatial com- plexity of the system. these larger lakes are mainly coastal, where some of them are connected with the regional drainage network through small streams. mojica et al. (2009) stated that the connection among floodplain lakes and forest streams may be responsi- scales of fish diversity in floodplain lakes ble for the notably high fish species richness at these lakes. we believe that greater depth and the connec- tions with small streams in coastal lakes may be key factors to explain the observed differences between the two types of lakes. the inverse scarabotti et al. (2011) reported on the influence of environmental variables on the structure of fish assemblages in floodplain lakes of the salado river, argentina. because of relationship between water depth and temperature, shallow lakes tend to be warmer than deeper lakes and deeper lakes tend to be colder than shallow lakes. warmer lakes also tend to have lower oxygen concentrations than cooler ones. rodriguez & lewis (1997) identified four environmental descriptors associated with the structure of fish assemblages of the floodplain lakes at orinoco river basin: transparency, conductance, depth and area. they proposed that the first two de- scriptors (environmental variables) are a consequence of the second two (physical structure). miranda (2011) also proposed that depth is the primary con- troller of the variability observed in several other environmental parameters of floodplain lakes, which in turn have some predictable effects on fish assem- blages: shallower lakes showed highest variability in physical environmental conditions and a high abun- dance of opportunistic species, while deeper lakes were more stable and exhibited a prevalence of resil- ient species and predators. however, in another study in which 11 environmental variables were monitored in floodplain lakes from the middle araguaia river, tejerina-garro et al. (1998) observed significant effects on the fish community only for transparency and maximum depth. in any case depth, which is determined by geological processes during lake for- mation, clearly is a key landscape variable to con- sider when attempting to explain variability in fish assemblages among lakes within a type, b1, and among the different types of lakes (coastal or island), b2. coastal lakes can be formed by at least two geo- morphological processes, while island lakes have just lakes could one geomorphological origin. coastal arise either by anastomoses (changes at the river channel) or by hydraulic barriers formed by the tribu- taries of the main river. in the first case, the lakes are tiny, shallow and the long axis is in the same direc- tion as that of the river (fig. 4a). this is also true for all lakes formed along the tributaries tend to be dendritic and deeper, and can run perpendicular to the river channel (fig. 4b). island lakes. in the second case, we believe that the conservation of fish diversity at the amazonian floodplain lakes is dependent on the implementation of reserves that must be large enough to encompass different types of lakes and 475 freitas et al. 62°23’30”w 62°18’0”w 62°12’30”w 62°7’0”w (a) (b) (b) s ” 0 3 4 4 ° 3 ’ ’ s ” 0 0 5 ° 3 s ” 0 3 5 5 ° 3 ’ s ” 0 3 4 4 ° 3 ’ ’ s ” 0 0 5 ° 3 s ” 0 3 5 5 ° 3 ’ 62°23’30”w 62°18’0”w 62°12’30”w 62°7’0”w fig. 4. typical coastal lakes of the solim~oes river (amazonas – brazil) formed by (a) hydraulic barriers at the mouths of tributar- ies and by (b) anastomoses with the river channel. multiple examples of each type. strategies of multi- ple-use modules, as proposed by saunders et al.
