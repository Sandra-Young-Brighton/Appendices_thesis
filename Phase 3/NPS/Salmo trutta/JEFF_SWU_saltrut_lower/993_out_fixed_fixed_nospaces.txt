e-mail: dfcpires@fc.ul.pt accepted for publication october 16, 2009 introduction droughts in streams disrupt hydrological connectivity, and have direct and indirect impacts on the resident biota (bond et al. 2008). direct effects of droughts centre on loss of water and ﬂow, and habitat reduction and reconﬁguration (lake 2003). resident biota experience unique challenges when drought is severe enough to cause complete drying of parts of the stream bed (humphries & baldwin 2003). then remnant habitats become critical to the survival of many species, acting as refuge and functioning in various ways as sources of recruits or colonists for the entire stream after the drought has passed (sedell et al. 1990; lancaster 2000; humphries & baldwin 2003). although refuges are a key component in resistance, resilience and recovery from drought, mechanisms and patterns of refuge use by stream biota remain poorly understood (matthews & matthews 2003; boulton & lake 2008). pools have long been considered important refuges for ﬁsh during droughts (see review in matthews 1998). however, there is growing evidence that assemblage structure of ﬁsh in dry-season pools may vary substantially both spatially and temporally (magoulick 2000; davey & kelly 2007; dekar & magoulick 2007). this variation has been associated with changes in the morphology, physicochemistry and spatial context of pools (e.g., capone & kushlan 1991; taylor 1997; labbe & fausch 2000; magoulick 2000; davey & kelly 2007; dekar & magoulick 2007), but the relative inﬂuence of these factors on different assemblage attributes remains unclear (see review in magoulick & kobza 2003). a more 74 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00391.x comprehensive understanding of this issue would be important from both theoretical and applied perspec- tives, to assure the quality of pools as refuge for ﬁsh during droughts, and devise more adequate conserva- tion management and restoration frameworks for drought-prone streams (e.g., bond & lake 2005; lake et al. 2007). events predictable understanding the mechanisms and patterns of use of dry-season pools is particularly important in the case of mediterranean stream ﬁsh assemblages, which include a large number of steadily declining endemic species that are likely to face major challenges in surviving extreme droughts expected under altered future climates (smith & darwall 2005; santos & miranda 2006; magalha˜es et al. 2007). droughts are seasonally in mediterranean streams, occurring each year in summer-early fall, but varying markedly in intensity among years (gasith & resh 1999). direct effects of droughts range from reductions in ﬂow to complete drying, usually result- ing in a highly patchy and heterogeneous mosaic of remnant pools, embedded in dry channels. fish persistence is dependent upon such dry-season pools, which seem to vary in suitability and functional importance for different species and life stages (magalha˜es et al. 2002a). factors promoting this variation are still poorly understood, and it remains important to evaluate the range of heterogeneity in dry-season pools that needs to be maintained across the landscape to sustain its characteristic set of species under present day and altered future drought regimes. fish assemblage variation across dry-season pools this study addressed these issues, by examining variation in ﬁsh assemblages among dry-season pools, in a typical mediterranean stream, in southwest portugal. speciﬁcally, the study assessed the relative contributions of variables reﬂecting pool morphology, physicochemistry and spatial context to variation in: (i) species richness and overall abundance, (ii) relative abundances of individual species, and (iii) relative abundances of individual length-classes within the most abundant species. this information was then used to discuss conservation management recommen- dations to contend with drought in mediterranean streams. study area stream drains the study was conducted in the odelouca stream, in (37°20¢n, the algarve region, southern portugal 8°21¢w). the odelouca about 520 km2 and ﬂows from the mountains of caldeira˜o (509 m a.s.l.) for 83 km, discharging at about sea level into the arade estuary (fig. 1). the basin drains mainly schists and greywackes from the carbonic period. the climate is mediterranean with oceanic inﬂuence, with warm to hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. mean monthly temperature ranges from 10.5 °c (january) to 22.3 °c (july). annual rainfall varies markedly (294.5–1313.5 mm), but follows a predictable seasonal pattern. about 81% of the annual rain occurs in october–march and virtually none falls in the hot, dry months (july–august). the ﬂow fig. 1. map of the study area, showing the location of the 21 pools in the odelouca stream, sampled for ﬁsh in september 2005. 75 pires et al. regime is highly dependent on rainfall patterns. headwaters ﬂow only after heavy rains, while the main stream and the largest tributaries typically dry to isolated pools during the summer. in dry years, there are no signiﬁcant ﬂoods, the drying period is extended, and surface water is restricted to the deepest pools. in wet years, there may be major ﬂash ﬂoods, and ﬂows may persist in downstream reaches. through the summer upstream reaches show well-developed riparian galleries dominated by alders alnus glutinosa, willows salix sp. and ashes fraxinus angustifolia, but only large extensions of giant-reed arundo donax are found downstream. land cover is primarily cork oak quer- cus suber and strawberry tree arbutus unedo woods, eucalyptus tree (eucalyptus sp.) plantations, and mediterranean sclerophyllous and evergreen scrub. human settlement is low, and largely restricted to two small villages. the stream is still free from major human impacts, such as impoundment, urban pollu- tion, angling or other recreational activities. however, a reservoir is under construction in the middle reaches of the stream, and will start to be ﬁlled in 2010 ﬂooding an area of about 7.5 km2. fish assemblages include a pool of native species that is dominated by loach cobitis paludica and chub squalius aradensis; eel anguilla anguilla and arched- mouth nase iberochondrostoma almacai are wide- less abundant whereas barbus sclateri spread but occurs sparsely and in low numbers. non-native species include the highly abundant mosquito ﬁsh gambusia holbrooki, and the relatively rare pumpkin- seed lepomis gibbosus, largemouth bass micropterus salmoides, chameleon cichlid australoheros facetus, carp cyprinus and straight-mouth nase pseudochondrostoma polylepis. carpio, methods fish sampling fish were sampled in 21 pools in september 2005, at the end of the dry season (fig. 1). the study year was dry relative to the long-term annual mean (295 vs. 693 mm), causing dry-season environmental condi- tions to be particularly severe. sampling locations were chosen in the ﬁeld, based on the natural distribution of permanent pools and accessibility, so that they encompassed the range of variability in pool size and riparian cover in the study area. overall, sampling pools were scattered throughout a 68-km reach of the stream, ranged in length from 7 to 214 m, and encompassed from open to well-developed can- opies (table 1). sampling was carried out using a standard electro- ﬁshing gear (el62 iigi, hans grassl, scho¨nau am ko¨nigssee, germany), ﬁtted with a single 30-cm anode, and discharging 300 v, 4–6 a, pulsed d.c. each pool was divided into stretches for sampling, with limits of stretches coinciding with discontinuities in depth and substrate. water depth exceeded 1.2 m in one short stretch only, which was excluded from analysis, to allow for more consistent sampling across pools. the number of stretches sampled per pool ranged from 1 to 5, contingent on the size and heterogeneity of the pools. each stretch was single- pass electroﬁshed for 5 min, by wading in an upstream direction, and covering all detectably distinctive microhabitats. the same person operated the electro- ﬁshing gear across stretches, and there were always two netters present to pick up stunned ﬁsh. fish were identiﬁed, measured for fork or total length depending on species, and returned to the pool. the sampling code mean ± sd range table 1. characteristics of pools in the odelouca stream, during september 2005. morphology maximum length (m) maximum width (m;

mean = 0.87, sd = 0.16, n = 7, (r; range = 0.60–1.00) mean = 0.95, sd = 0.04, n = 7, range = 0.87–1.00) (d.f. pires & m.f. magalha˜es, unpublished data). and relative abundances explanatory variables factors inﬂuencing assemblage structure were analy- sed using three sets of explanatory variables reﬂecting the morphological, physicochemical and spatial con- texts of each pool (table 1). morphological context was described from ﬁve variables reﬂecting pool size and shape. the volume of pools was calculated from its maximum length, maximum width and middle-channel depth, by approximation to a half ellipsoid. width was measured along three to ﬁve equally spaced transects, perpen- dicular to the long axis of each pool; middle-channel depth was derived from measures taken at the middle- point of each transect. a total of three to six additional measures taken at the deepest points in each pool were used to quantify maximum depth. physicochemical context was described from eight variables reﬂecting water quality, substrate composi- tion and riparian canopy development. all variables were measured along three to ﬁve middle-channel points in each pool. turbidity was assessed using a secchi disk. conductivity and ph were measured at the surface with a hi 198129 probe (hanna instru- ments, woonsocket, ri, usa), and surface tempera- ture and dissolved oxygen were measured with an ysi do200 oxygen meter (yellow spring inc. yellow springs, oh, usa). substrate coarseness and heter- ogeneity were quantiﬁed with a 1-m lead core divided into 10-cm sections, using the frequency size class method of bain (1999). speciﬁcally, the segment rope was stretched at the pool bottom, and the dominant substrate in each 10-cm section was recorded, as: 0, <0.06 mm; 1, 0.06–1 mm; 2, 2–15 mm; 3, 16– 63 mm; 4, 64–256 mm; and 5, >256 mm. the mean and standard deviation of dominant substrate values were used as indices of substrate coarseness and heterogeneity, respectively. canopy was quantiﬁed as the proportional area shaded by riparian vegetation, using a konustar professional compass clinometer (konus optical & sport system, verona, italy). spatial context was described from two variables reﬂecting pool location and isolation in the stream fish assemblage variation across dry-season pools network. the position of each pool was logged with a magellan 200 xl, gps (global positioning system) receiver (mitac international corporation, taiwan, china), and plugged in a geographic information system (gis; arcview 3.1 for windows, environ- mental systems research institute, redlands, ca, usa). distance of each pool from the stream mouth was then calculated in the gis, using digital cartog- raphy in the scale 1:25,000 (http://www.igeoe.pt). dis- tance to nearest pool was directly measured in the ﬁeld. all variables but distance from the stream mouth were determined immediately after ﬁsh sampling, always by the same person. data analysis analyses were designed to quantify variation in ﬁsh assemblages among pools, and identify variables explaining this variation. fish and habitat data per stretch were combined to derive species richness and relative abundance, and average habitat conditions at each pool. species detectability was considered to be constant across pools. the relative abundance of each species in each pool was expressed in terms of catch- per-unit-effort (mean number of individuals per ﬁshing pass). the most abundant species were divided into three length-classes (small: <50 mm, medium: 50– 79 mm, and large ‡80 mm), because previous studies showed size-related variation in the use of dry-season pools (e.g., capone & kushlan 1991; magalha˜es et al. 2002a). to reduce daily inﬂuences in temperature and oxygen measurements, residuals from linear regres- sions were used instead of the original variables. prior to analysis, species richness and catch data, and explanatory variables showing skewed distributions were log-transformed to approach normality and to reduce the inﬂuence of extreme values (table 1). species richness was quantiﬁed using rarefaction methods to account for variation in total catches among pools (gotelli & colwell 2001). rarefaction generates the number of species expected for a small collection of n individuals drawn randomly from a large sample (n), allowing for meaningful standardi- sation and comparison of data sets with similar species-occurrence distributions (e.g., cao et al. 2007). sample size to rarefaction (n) was deﬁned as the lowest number of ﬁsh captured across pools (n = 45). the ecosim 7 simulation software (gotelli & entsminger 2009) was used to select randomly individuals from samples of each pool and record the number of species; the randomisation was repeated 1000 times, and the mean number of species was used as the expected species richness. relationships between ﬁsh species richness and abundance, and variables describing pool charac- teristics were investigated using linear regression 77 pires et al. correlation (r) was (legendre & legendre 1998). analyses were carried out separately for morphological, physicochemical and spatial sets of variables, starting with a preliminary screening of univariate relationships between each pair of response and explanatory variables. to reduce collinearity problems in subsequent multivariate mod- elling, pearson’s computed between each pair of explanatory variables, dropping from further analyses one variable from each pair with |r| > 0.60. the variable dropped from each pair was always the one least associated with the dependent variable, as judged from univariate analysis. multi- variate modelling was then carried out for each response variable and set of explanatory variables, based on the two-step forward selection procedure of blanchet et al. (2008), thus preventing the potential shortcomings associated with classical stepwise selec- tion methods. in each case, the ﬁrst step involved the ﬁtting of a full model relating the response variable to all the explanatory variables in a given set (full model), carrying to subsequent forward selection only sets of variables producing statistically signiﬁcant full models. forward selection was then carried out using the double stopping criteria of blanchet et al. (2008), based on the alpha signiﬁcance level and the adjusted coefﬁcient of multiple determination (adj-r2). how- ever, maximisation of adj-r2 was used as stopping criterion instead of the adj-r2 of the full model, because the later tends to over-correct the forward selection procedure when the number of variables and the sample sizes are relatively small (g. blanchet & d. borcard, personal communication). in common with other (e.g., gutzwiller & barrow 2001; moreira et al. 2005), signiﬁcance of statistical tests was assessed at a = 0.10, to reduce the incidence of type ii errors and thereby avoid missing eventual relationships with ecological relevance (buhl-morten- sen 1996; underwood 1997). studies was used to isolated seven components of explained variation: (i) pure morphological variation, (ii) pure physicochemical variation, (iii) pure spatial variation, (iv) combined morphological ⁄ physicochemical varia- tion, (v) spatial component of morphological variation, (vi) spatial component of physicochemical variation, and (vii) spatial component of morphological ⁄ physi- cochemical variation. associations between the matrix of species abun- dances and pool characteristics were analysed taking a similar approach, using redundancy analysis (rda) and partial-rda (legendre & legendre 1998). a linear model of ordination was used, because pre- liminary detrended correspondence analyses showed turnovers along the ﬁrst axes <2 sd, which is the recommended criterion for choosing linear versus uni- modal ordination models (ter braak 1995). rda was carried out on covariance matrices to weight each species by the variance of its log-transformed abun- dance, thus preventing the undue inﬂuence of rare species (ter braak 1995). species occurring in <5 pools were excluded from the analysis. rdas were carried out with the canoco 4.5 software (ter braak & smilauer 2002) using the forward selection proce- dure by blanchet et al. (2008), whereby signiﬁcant variables were added to the model in order of the greatest contribution to the adj-r2. to avoid collin- earity problems and enhance model interpretability, variables causing variation inﬂation factor to exceed 2.0 were not considered in model building. statistical signiﬁcance of variables and rda models were assessed from monte carlo permutation tests (104 permutations). results fish assemblage composition morphological, physicochemical and spatial models were used in variation partitioning to isolate the amount of variation of the response variable that can be attributed to one set of explanatory factors once the effects of other sets are taken into account (legendre & legendre 1998). analyses were based on multivar- iate models built with the forward selection procedure, except when the control of collinearity reduced the set to a single variable and when lack of signiﬁcance of the full models precluded the development of multi- variate models, in which cases the variables yielding the best signiﬁcant univariate relationship were used. partial linear regressions were used in partitioning the explained variation among the sets of explanatory variables. variation partitioning with two sets of explanatory variables followed borcard et al. (1992), and the extension of the method to three sets of explanatory variables by anderson & gribble (1998) a total of 7,494 ﬁsh of 10 species were captured (table 2). the number of species recorded per pool ranged from 4 to 9 and the mean expected species richness per pool from 2.1 to 7.2. mean total catches per pool ranged from 26.5 to 884.0. mosquito ﬁsh was the most caught species (37% numbers), occurring at 76% of the pools. loach, chub and arched-mouth nase were also often captured (>67% of pools) but in smaller numbers (10–21%). the frequency of occur- rence was still high for eel (95%), barbel (67%) and pumpkinseed (48%), but their catches were even lower (<6%). other species were both sparse (<25% of pools) and rare (<3% numbers). variation in species richness and abundance preliminary univariate analyses underlined several associations between species richness and abundances 78 table 2. composition of ﬁsh assemblages in pools in the odelouca stream during

highly correlated with all other morphological vari- ables (|r|; mean = 0.82, sd = 0.07, n = 5, range = 0.72–0.89), and so it was the only retained further. analysis of physicochemical variables, revealed some strong associations between species abundances and n = 9, canopy temperature (r2; mean = 0.22, range = 0.17–0.54), sd = 0.05, n = 8, range = 0.14–0.29), oxygen (r2; mean = 0.23, sd = 0.08, n = 8, range = 0.14–0.36) n = 6, and range = 0.15–0.32). canopy was highly correlated with temperature (|r| = 0.62) and oxygen (|r| = 0.67), and so was the variable retained in multivariate modelling, as it was also associated with native species richness (r2 = 0.26). other signiﬁcant associ- ations were found between species abundance and substrate coarseness (r2; mean = 0.16, sd = 0.00, range = 0.16–0.16), and conductivity (r2 = n = 2, 0.26, n = 1). the latter two variables were highly correlated (|r| = 0.61), and so only substrate was retained in subsequent analyses. distance from the stream mouth showed stronger associations with species richness and abundance than distance to the nearest pool (r2; mean = 0.22, sd = 0.09, n = 10, range = 0.14–0.40 vs. mean = 0.16, sd = 0.01, ph (r2; mean = 0.24, sd = 0.07, n = 2, range = 0.16–0.17). however, as these spatial variables were independent (|r| = 0.02), they were both retained in multivariate modelling. relationships between species richness and abun- dance and morphological, physicochemical, and spatial sets of variables varied greatly in type and strength (table 3). morphological models underlined a tendency for overall species richness to be highest in large pools. conversely, total catches and those of natives tended to decrease with pool volume, with small chub and arched- mouth nase being less caught in large pools where catches of pumpkinseed increased. physicochemical models, showed a trend for more native species occurring in pools well covered by riparian canopy. catches of arched-mouth nase and chub also increased in well-shaded pools but those of small loach, eel, and mosquito ﬁsh tended to be lower therein. total catches, and those of chub and mosquito ﬁsh decreased with substrate coarseness, whereas eel were more caught in pools with coarser substrates. catches of arched-mouth nase and chub decreased with water acidity, and those of medium-size arched showed a positive association with substrate heterogeneity. spatial models reﬂected a tendency for overall species richness to be highest in downstream pools. catches of barbel and pumpkinseed also increased downstream, but those of arched-mouth nase and chub were highest upstream. medium- and large-sized arched-mouth nase tended to be more caught in more isolated pools. partitioning of explained

and arched-mouth nase increasing in well-shaded pools relative to pools with poorly developed canopies, where eel, pumpkinseed and small loach were more caught. along the rda2, increasing substrate coarseness was associated with decreasing catches. after controlling for the effects of spatial context, both variables were still signiﬁcant, with patterns of assemblage variation remaining largely the same. the spatial model reﬂected a gradient of distance from the stream mouth, contrasting downstream pools where barbel and pumpkinseed were more caught with upstream pools where catches of chub and arched- mouth increased (table 3, fig. 2). this spatial trend lost signiﬁcance after accounting for the effects of physicochemical context. biplots of rda models subc subc can ich2 squ3 squ2 ich3

matthews 1998; magoulick & kobza 2003), yet there have been few attempts to isolate the unique contri- butions of these different factors to variation in species richness and abundance. the variation

but relative species abundances to be mainly related to physicochemical contexts. further- more, this study highlighted considerable functional heterogeneity in the use of dry-season pools, with different species favouring pools with different sizes and physicochemical characteristics, and variable locations. these general patterns are unlikely to be shaped by methodological artefacts or shortcomings. although sampling locations have been constrained by the uneven distribution of pools and accessibilities throughout the landscape, biases resulting from this were probably small, because spatial turnover of species in streams in sw portugal is generally low (magalha˜es et al. 2002b), making it unlikely that assemblage structure changes markedly among similar habitats. also, previous investigation has shown that the sampling effort used at each pool was sufﬁcient to record most species present and estimate their relative abundances (d.f. pires & m.f. magalha˜es, unpub- lished data), consistent with previous evidence that species poor assemblages, lacking abundant but dis- continuous species, may require less effort to be characterised adequately than diverse assemblages where such species do occur (angermeier & smogor 1995; cao et al. 2001). the potential effects of sampling conditions and worker’s skills on capture efﬁciency of the electroﬁshing gear were controlled by sampling in wadeable pools, with the same ﬁeld crew operating throughout the study. electroﬁshing biases against small and less conspicuous ﬁsh were not likely to have affected the results much, because both small and inconspicuous ﬁsh (i.e., mosquito ﬁsh and loach) were well represented in samples taken in large pools, where under-sampling was potentially more serious (zalewski & cowx 1990). even if some bias still occurred for some species (see bayley & austen 2002), they were probably systematic because elec- troﬁshing was not severely complicated by different biological contexts and environmental conditions, and thus among pools comparisons remain valid. although failing to account for imperfect detectability was a limitation with potentially more serious consequences in estimating occurrence and relative abundance for rare species (e.g., mackenzie & kendal 2002; mac- kenzie et al. 2002), there was a tendency for species enrichment and increased abundance of rare species (i.e., pumpkinseed and barbel) in large pools, suggest- ing that the patterns observed were not an artefact of the sampling protocol. finally, conducting the study in a single, dry year, despite the strong temporal variability of mediterranean streams, may have con- tributed primarily to an increase in the proportion of 82 tends unexplained variation in the data. spatial patterning of mediterranean stream ﬁsh assemblages to change with temporal rainfall variability (magalha˜es et al. 2007; d.f. pires & m.f. magalha˜es, unpublished data), with associations with local habitats being weaker and less diverse in dry than in wet years (mesquita et al. 2006), in contrast to patterns found in other intermittent streams (dekar & magoulick 2007). possibly, results of the variation partitioning approach would have been stronger if average estimates of assemblage attributes over several years were avail- able. nevertheless, this snapshot study was worth to identify factors most likely to limit ﬁsh when drought conditions turn rigorous, though it may be short to evaluate the full set of factors accounting for assem- blage dynamics. relative contributions of morphological, physicochemical and spatial factors to assemblage variation the three sets of explanatory variables considered here explained relatively high proportions of the total variation in species richness (25.8–42.9%) and abun- dances (24.5–66.0%). these results are exceptional compared to what has been reported in earlier studies of mediterranean stream ﬁsh assemblages (e.g., god- inho et al. 1997; pires et al. 1999, 2004; mesquita et al. 2006; mo´ran-lo´ pez et al. 2006; ferreira et al. 2007). nonetheless, there were still considerable amounts of unexplained variation, which might be associated with unmeasured local factors, landscape inﬂuences, biotic and stochastic processes, and sam- pling variability. in variation partitioning, morphological and phys- icochemical factors had major unique contributions to variation in overall species richness and abundance, and relative species abundances, respectively. these results seemed to reﬂect some hierarchy in assemblage organisation (see gaston & blackburn 2000), with pool size inﬂuencing the set of species and total individuals in each pool but physicochemical condi- tions determining their relative abundances and actual information is assembly structure. clearly, needed to clarify the extent to which perceived patterns might be dependent on the number and ecological requirements of species, and geographic and climatic settings, given different mechanisms of assemblage organisation may imply different conser- vation options. further spatial context alone showed a rather small contri- bution to assemblage variation, contrary to what has been suggested in other studies (e.g., taylor 1997; filipe et al. 2002; magalha˜es et al. 2002b; davey & kelly 2007). conversely, shared contributions between spatial context and morpholog- ical and physicochemical factors, and between all the amount of three sets of factors was notable. shared contributions could be due to different reasons, as for instance correlations among sets of explanatory variables (legendre & legendre 1998). speciﬁcally, spatially structured variation in pool size and riparian cover may have caused overlaps between spatial context and the morphological and physicochemical sets of vari- ables, respectively. another potential explanation to this overlapping, not necessarily exclusive, may be related to unmeasured external or biotic factors that covary in space with the measured variables (legendre & legendre 1998). whatever its ultimate causes, the large amount of shared contributions suggests that the relative importance of spatial context may have been insufﬁciently scrutinised and additional work is needed to detail the spatial conditions associated with assemblage variation. morphological, physicochemical and spatial correlates of assemblage variation species richness was generally highest in the largest pools, as found in many studies in intermittent streams (capone & kushlan 1991; taylor 1997; magalha˜es et al. 2002a; dekar & magoulick 2007). this may be due to large pools providing a most favourable habitat to pool specialists, as they usually show higher habitat diversity, and are the most likely to persist through the dry season (labbe & fausch 2000). this may explain the associations of pumpkinseed and barbel with large pools, given these species tend to favour lentic and deep habitats, respectively (aparicio & de sostoa 1999; moyle 2002). there was a tendency for overall abundance and that of natives declining in large pools. negative associations between ﬁsh abundance and pool size may be regarded as expected (e.g., capone & kushlan 1991; dekar & magoulick 2007), though positive relationships have also been found in intermittent streams (magoulick 2000). this negative trend seemed to reﬂect a shift in the size structure of assemblages, from relatively large abundances of small ﬁsh (i.e., small chub and arched-mouth nase) towards reduced abundances, of larger ﬁsh (i.e., pumpkinseed), similar to observations by schlosser (1987) and capone & kushlan (1991). this may be a consequence of several factors, including local habitat resources and food availability, predation, and colonisation and dispersal processes (power 1987; schlosser 1987). however, this trend can also simply indicate that ﬁsh got more congregated as pool size decreased (dekar & magou- lick 2007). additional work is needed to investigate which of these alternatives, if any, underlined the perceived patterns in ﬁsh abundance. overall abundance was negatively related to substrate coarseness, through associations of mosquito ﬁsh and fish assemblage variation across dry-season pools chub with ﬁne substrates. however, positive associa- tions with substrate coarseness and heterogeneity were found for eel and arched-mouth nase, respectively. these results were in line with previous evidence implicating substrate in the structuring of mediterra- nean ﬁsh assemblages, and highlighting considerable variation among species in substrate use (godinho et al. 1997; pires et al. 1999; mesquita et al. 2006; mo´ ran- lo´ pez et al. 2006; ferreira et al. 2007). likewise, the relationships uncovered for chub, eel and mosquito ﬁsh seemed consistent with their known habitat require- ments (mesquita et al. 2006; santos & ferreira 2008), suggesting that ﬁsh may tend to concentrate in the pools with their most favourable substrate grounds. native species were strongly associated with riparian canopy, with well-shaded pools holding more species, the highest relative abundances of chub and arched- mouth nase, and the lowest of small loach and eel. relationships between native ﬁsh and riparian canopy have been frequently reported in mediterranean streams, probably reﬂecting particularly favourable sheltering and feeding conditions (e.g., collares-pereira et al. 1995; mo´ran-lo´ pez et al. 2006; ferreira et al. 2007). this seemed also to be the case herein, as for instance, water temperature decreased in well-shaded pools, probably resulting in generally benign environ- mental conditions for ﬁsh. furthermore, inputs of terrestrial insects from well-developed canopies (baxter et al. 2005), probably improved prey supply for at least some water-column invertivores, such as chub (ma- galha˜es 1993a,b). likewise, canopy openness probably promoted primary productivity in little shaded pools (schiller et al. 2007), and this may have resulted in more suitable conditions for eel and loach, as found for other species elsewhere (dekar & magoulick 2007). assemblage structure varied along the stream net- work, as relative abundances of barbel and pumpkin- seed increased and those of chub and arched-mouth nase decreased downstream. these changes were consistent with longitudinal gradients found in other mediterra- nean streams (godinho et al. 1997; pires et al. 1999; magalha˜es et al. 2002a,b; mo´ran-lo´ pez et al. 2006), probably reﬂecting unmeasured spatially structured environmental inﬂuences, and other geographical or biotic factors independent of environmental conditions. implications for conservation taken together, results from this study highlighted that during severe droughts ﬁsh may refuge in pools with the most favourable morphological and physicochem- ical conditions, contingent on their location in the stream network, but independently on whether there are other pools nearby. large pools, and pools with well-developed canopies held the richest assemblages and the highest overall abundances of native species. 83 pires et al. however, they seemed not to cover the entire func- tional diversity associated with dry-season pools, as there was considerable among species variability in pool use. it appeared unlikely that species with stringent habitat requirements such as barbel would persist if no large pools were available, but there was some indication that small pools may still be needed to refuge small chub and arched-mouth nase. likewise, pools with well- developed canopies may be critical for native cyprinids, but pools with open canopies may be important in maintaining other native species, such as loach. although lack of data on ﬁsh movements and recolonisation dynamics limits the inferences that may be drawn from the patterns recorded in this study, these results suggest that conservation efforts targeted at large pools, with well-developed canopies are particularly important, especially considering that these pools may be under-represented and highly susceptible to human impacts during more severe droughts expected under altered future climates. however, there appears also to be a need for incorporating other pools in conservation strategies, to guarantee the long-term persistence of diverse native ﬁsh fauna in mediterranean streams. speciﬁcally, the presence of networks of heterogeneous pools, representative of the entire gradients in pool size and physicochemical conditions might be essential to provide adequate conditions for a complement of species with different habitat requirements. future research should thus focus on the way patterns of use of dry-season pools translate into population and community dynamics at the landscape scale, which is critical for predicting the number and spatial conﬁgu- ration of pools to be included in such networks, to maximise their effectiveness for biodiversity conserva- tion. acknowledgements this study was funded by the instituto nacional da a´ gua (contrato nº 2004 ⁄ 033 ⁄ inag),
