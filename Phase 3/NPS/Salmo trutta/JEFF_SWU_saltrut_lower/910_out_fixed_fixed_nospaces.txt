community ecology; community structure; ﬁshes; hurricane introduction scales is paramount the evaluation of assemblage structure across spatio- temporal towards a better understanding of species composition in ecological communities. moreover, quantifying structural pat- terns can aid in recognising and further understanding underlying processes active in regulating assemblage structure (i.e., biotic and abiotic processes). studies examining ﬁsh assemblage structure across time and space have been numerous (e.g., moyle & vondracek 1985; ross et al. 1985; johnston & maceina 2009), but despite the vast amount of work on this theme, the adequacy of spatial and temporal scales used has often been questioned (e.g., grossman 1982; rahel 1990; fausch et al. 2002). alterations of assemblage structure viewed at small spatial and/or temporal scales may prove to be insigniﬁcant when viewed at larger more appropriate levels, and vice versa. furthermore, long-term studies have rarely used continuous, structured sampling regimes throughout the focal study period. rather, these studies have relied on isolated sampling periods, creating gaps within their temporal breadth. the need for continuous sampling to properly understand the interactions between environmental processes and stream ﬁshes has been demonstrated by the riverscape principle (fausch et al. 2002). studies lacking these intermediate samples may be missing ﬂuctuations and structural trends important in understanding how and why an assemblage has chan- ged or remained temporally the same (e.g., ross et al. 1985; hansen & ramm 1994; berra & petry 2006). additionally, owing to the magnitude and complexity of many long-term data sets, studies are often limited to either trends independent of one another. this is problematic because time and space are not independent with temporal or spatial correspondence: aaron d. geheber, department of biological sciences, southeastern louisiana university, slu 10736, hammond, la 70402, usa. e-mail: aaron.d.geheber-1@ou.edu *present address: department of zoology, university of oklahoma, 730 van vleet oval, room 314, norman, ok 73019, usa doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00584.x 627 geheber & piller respect to variability in assemblage structure, and this is often overlooked in aquatic ecology (see meador & matthews 1992). as a result of the many con- founding factors that may limit the understanding and quantiﬁcation of ecological patterns, long-term struc- tured surveys encompassing large areas are increas- ingly important testing assemblage structure dynamics in aquatic systems. for despite the substantial effort describing ecological assemblages across spatio-temporal scales, the pro- cesses responsible for structuring assemblages and the degree to which these processes contribute are still questioned. these processes are either stochastic or deterministic regulation of assemblage structure. constancy within assemblage structure may be indicative of deterministic organisation, in which competitive exclusion among species is avoided through biotic processes such as resource partitioning or nonlinear competition within assemblages (gross- man 1982). alternatively, structuring would yield unpredictable variability driven mainly by abiotic environmental processes, such that equilib- rium would never be reached (grossman et al. 1982). however, these processes may be system speciﬁc dependent on a stream’s disturbance regime (poff & allan 1995). stochastic is most instability environmental commonly related to high levels of disturbance within a system. as generally deﬁned by white & pickett (1985), disturbances include any event that disrupts an eco- system or assemblage structure and causes changes in natural resources or the physical environment. gorman & karr (1978) found that the assemblage structure in modiﬁed streams was very unstable as compared to that of undisturbed stream communities. disturbance events such as altering watershed land- scapes often inﬂuence changes in substrate type and stream sediment load (karr et al. 1985; sutherland et al. 2002), and impoundment and channelisation events inﬂuence assemblage structure through the alteration of natural ﬂow regimes (quinn & kwak 2003; gillette et al. 2005; taylor et al. 2008). hydro- logic variability, speciﬁcally periods of extreme low ﬂow, contribute to habitat loss as well as changes in water quality (magoulick & kobza 2003; matthews & marsh-matthews 2003), which may alter assem- blage structure. systems, however, have been subject river systems of the southeastern united states possess the greatest diversity of temperate freshwater ﬁshes in the world (warren et al. 1997). many of these to anthropogenic changes including the construction of impoundments, channelisation, in-stream sand and gravel mining (phillips & johnston 2004; hayer & irwin 2008; taylor et al. 2008), as well as extreme natural environmental perturbations such as hurri- 628 canes, droughts and ﬂoods (freeman et al. 1988; mallin et al. 1999; schaefer et al. 2006). in this study, contemporary and historical ﬁsh col- lection data (1988–2009) from the pearl river were used to assess the patterns of ﬁsh assemblage struc- ture across both temporal and spatial scales. data sets such as this, based on standard sampling protocol and periodicity maintained over the study period, are rare and provide an opportunity to examine how eco- logical systems are structured across generous scales. here, we in assemblage structure and assessed the ways in which abiotic environmental events (i.e., drought and hurri- cane events) inﬂuence such patterns. many studies have pointed out the importance of abiotic factors, including stream gradient and hydrologic variability, in structuring stream ﬁsh assemblages (e.g., schlosser 1982; poff & allan 1995). examined spatio-temporal patterns our objectives were as follows: (i) to test for spatio-temporal differences in assemblage structure across the study period. (ii) to test whether spatially independent assemblages have complimentary struc- tural dynamics across the temporal scale of study. we were interested in whether upstream and down- stream assemblages covaried with respect to struc- tural dynamics across time (i.e., whether assemblages shared patterns of structural change across time). (iii) to examine the effects of space on assemblage com- position within the system. here we tested similarity between upstream and downstream assemblages to characterise potential species differences between areas. (iv) to assess structural patterns across the temporal breadth of study and examine the contribu- tions of environmental factors in structuring assem- blages. as a result of the stochastic environmental events, including periods of low ﬂow and the impacts of hurricanes on the system, it was predicted that there would be temporal alterations in assemblage structure associated with environmental perturbations. furthermore, it was predicted that upstream and downstream assemblages would differ structurally owing to the inﬂuences of local features across the stream gradient. study area the pearl river is a gulf coastal plain system located in mississippi and louisiana, usa (fig. 1), drains approximately 22,688 km² and is nearly 640 km in length. it is a moderately diverse system that har- bours approximately 119 different freshwater ﬁshes, which is relatively high compared to other rivers of similar size in eastern louisiana and southern missis- sippi (ross 2001). the ichthyofauna of the pearl river system has been studied for more than half of a century (gunning & suttkus 1985, 1990, 1991; love fish assemblage structural patterns fig. 1. location of study sites in the pearl river basin, mississippi and louisiana, usa. boxes encompass the eight sites in the upper survey area and the eight sites in the lower survey area. & taylor 2004; piller et al. 2004; tipton et al. 2004; stewart et al. 2005); however, no study has examined the assemblage structure dynamics of its ﬁshes across time and space. since the 1950s, the pearl river has been subject to many anthropogenic perturbations including mill efﬂuent, dredging, snagging, navigation channel development, and dam and reservoir construction, which have threatened river channel stability and raised much concern for its ﬁshes (piller et al. 2004). the two most predominant modiﬁcations have been the construction of the ross barnett dam in jackson, ms (1960–1964) and the pearl river navigation channel, completed in 1953 to be used as a shipping channel that paralleled the river. to maintain a navi- gable water level in the navigation channel at all times, a low head dam (pools bluff sill) was con- structed across the river channel just downstream of the navigation channel connection site. the naviga- tion channel is not presently in use or maintained. furthermore, several natural environmental perturba- tions have occurred in the system including years of extreme drought in 2000 and 2007, and the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita in the summer of 2005. the impact of hurricane katrina was espe- cially concerning because of its storm path which notably travelled directly up the mouth of the pearl river following the stream channel inland. materials and methods sample collections this study incorporated both historic and contempo- rary ﬁsh collections from the main channel of the pearl river. the historic data set was initiated in the 1950s by the late dr royal d. suttkus (1920–2009), emeritus professor of biology and curator of fishes, tulane university. sites were located on two stretches of the river, one near monticello, missis- sippi (upper pearl river survey) and the other near bogalusa, louisiana (lower pearl river survey) (fig. 1). sampling by dr suttkus ceased in august of 2005. however, sampling efforts were continued by personnel at southeastern louisiana university beginning in april 2006, through the end of 2009. because of inconsistencies in sampling methods and localities used in early sampling periods, this study only incorporated data from 1988, when sampling methods were standardised to the current protocol. sampling between 2006 and 2009 was carried out utilising this same standardised methodology. 629 geheber & piller river, with each area containing eight fish sampling was conducted quarterly at the same sixteen sites along the pearl river between 1988 and 2009. sites were divided among two separate areas of sites (fig. 1). during periods of low ﬂow and other events rendering some sites inaccessible, comparable alter- nate sites were sampled in their place. the upper stretch was generally sampled during the months of february, may, august and november, and the lower stretch was generally sampled during the months of january, april, july and october. no collections were made in february 1989 or in any upstream sites in 1993 (february, may, august and november). furthermore, no collections were made during the four sampling months following hurricane katrina (october 2005, november 2005, january 2006 and february 2006) or during january 2009. sample sites were located along the shoreline on the inner bends of the river, and each site was ~100 m in length. fishes were collected from wadable habitat at each site using a 10-foot seine (10′ 9 6′, 3/16″ ace mesh). each site was sampled for approximately 15 min. all ﬁshes collected were immediately ﬁxed in 10% commercial grade formaldehyde. after ﬁxation, collections were then transferred to water for sorting and identiﬁcation. specimens were identiﬁed to spe- cies level in all cases except for the genus carpiodes which were pooled per collection site (i.e., these were usually collected as young of year and were not reli- ably identiﬁable to species). all specimens were then placed in 70% ethanol and permanently archived in the royal d. suttkus fish collection at the tulane university museum of natural history (1988–2005) or the southeastern louisiana vertebrate collection (2006–2009). data analysis nonparametric statistical analyses, including nonmet- ric multidimensional scaling (nmds) and hierarchical cluster analyses, were used to assess patterns in assemblage structure across the temporal and spatial scales of study. these methods were chosen because they are complementary to one another, each working off of the same resemblance matrix, which provided a more reliable assessment of assemblage structure than either analysis on its own. additionally, analysis of similarity (anosim), permutational multivariate analysis of variation (permanova), similarity proﬁle (simprof), similarity percentage analysis (simper) and best analysis were used to quantify structural distinctions across scales of study. the use of non- parametric statistical analyses allowed comparisons to be made while avoiding the assumptions of normality and homogeneity, yielding a more realistic approach towards quantifying assemblage structure in a natural 630 system. statistical analyses were performed using primer 6 (plymouth routines in multivariate ecological research) ltd, plymouth, uk). the primer statistics package has been commonly used for aquatic community data analyses (see clarke & gorley 2006; humphries et al. 2008; huntington et al. 2010; fodrie & heck 2011; perkin & bonner 2011). primer-e (2008 spatio-temporal variation of assemblage structure we performed a two-way crossed analysis of similar- ity (anosim) to determine signiﬁcant differences of years across areas, and areas across years. this was run using a maximum of 999 permutations per group (i.e., year) pair-wise comparisons. sites were a priori classiﬁed as either upper (monticello) or lower (bog- alusa) areas. moreover, sites within each sampling period (i.e., eight sites per sampling period) were combined because of the absence of an area effect between sites within each sampling period (this was determined based on a nested anosim previously run on the raw data). global r values and associated p values were reported (clarke 1993). r values range from  1 to 1, where  1 indicates all within-group similarity is less than among group similarity, and 1 indicates all within-group samples are more similar to one another than among group samples. this was based on mean rank similarity of groups. groups were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. to assess the potential interaction between time and space, we ran a permutational multivariate analysis of variation (permanova) using 9999 randomisations. this analy- sis is similar to anosim; however, it also provided an interaction term which allowed us to assess spatio- temporal relationships in assemblage structure (see anderson 2001 for details). prior to these analyses, all data were transformed, which decreased the overpowering effects of highly abun- dant species in the data set (see appendix i for spe- cies composition), and a bray–curtis similarity resemblance matrix was created based on between sample comparisons. the bray–curtis coefﬁcient is favoured in ecological community analyses because it obeys many rules of ‘natural’ biology and is not heavily inﬂuenced by shared zeros common in com- munity data sets (see clarke & gorley 2006). this same approach was taken for all data sets herein (whether pooled over space/time or not). square root to visualise the effects of area and time in a single analysis, we employed a method that allows the depiction of spatio-temporal relationships together. samples from each study year were averaged, creat- ing an individual sample for each year at each river area (e.g., lower 1988, upper 1988, etc.). this reduced random variation in the data set and aided in reducing stress levels, rendering results more inter- pretable in subsequent nmds analyses (high stress levels > 0.15 are indicative of poor depiction of data in two dimensional space). nmds was run from the resemblance matrix using 50 restarts and a minimum stress value of 0.01. this enabled a clear representa- tion of the upper river area in relation to the lower river area, as well as an across year representation in two dimensional space. spatial comparisons of assemblage structure to determine whether spatially independent assem- blages show complimentary structural dynamics across time, we employed the relate routine. sep- arate resemblance matrices were created for each of the upper and the lower areas. matrices were com- pared to one another through relate analyses, which captures sequential structure (in this case years) in assemblage data that covary between sam- pling areas (i.e., the algorithm searches for similarity between resemblance matrices). relate analysis is a nonparametric version of a mantel test. this analy- sis produces a rho sample statistic which indicates the probability of the pattern occurring by chance alone. a ρ value approaching 1 indicates covariance in assemblage structure across years, between areas. ρ values were interpretable at p < 0.05. to characterise the effects of space on assemblage composition within the system, we ran similarity per- centage (simper) analysis (clarke 1993). this was run comparatively between upper and lower area assemblages using the previous similarity matrix (i.e., sites within sampling periods combined). average dissimilarity percentages between groups, and aver- age dissimilarity percentages of the contributing spe- cies were average abundances of species within each area and the stan- dard deviation divided by the average dissimilarity of each species. therefore, a species with a high aver- age dissimilarity and a low standard deviation is a good contributor to the differences between areas. species contributing to the majority of dissimilarity (>90%) were reported. reported. simper provides temporal patterns of assemblage structure because spatial differentiation between areas may be disruptive in illustrating assemblage structure across time alone, the following analyses were conducted in the absence of area differences. this was deemed appropriate based on previous ﬁndings in relate analysis (depicted in results). rareﬁed species richness and total per year abun- dance were each graphed as regression models across sample years. estimates of rareﬁed species richness fish assemblage structural patterns were based on 7000 individuals for each collection year (7000 was used because at least this many indi- viduals were collected each year). individual samples for each year of study (1988–2009) were created by averaging site collections per year. nmds was run, in addition to hierarchical complete linkage cluster analysis coupled with a similarity proﬁle (simprof) test of signiﬁcance. simprof tested for genuine inter- nal structure within the resultant dendrogram. sim- prof creates a similarity proﬁle by ranking the similarity matrix. a mean proﬁle is then calculated by randomising (1000 permutations) the order of each variable value and recalculating the proﬁle. the mean proﬁle is compared against the actual similarity proﬁle yielding the summed absolute distances (p) between the two dendrograms. this was compared with the deviations of further randomly generated proﬁles (=999) to test for signiﬁcance. group signiﬁ- cance was tested at p < 0.05. simprof is a priori unstructured comparisons between individual samples rather than between pre- deﬁned groups (see clarke et al. 2008 for further description). additionally, a cophenetic correlation was run to determine the cluster quality. therefore the best routine was run to ﬁnd species most inﬂuential on assemblage structure across time. the procedure measures the agreement between the over- all bray–curtis dissimilarity measures for the entire community and those of the individual species. this is performed using spearman rank correlation method which uses stepwise comparisons to measure similar- ity between the two matrices. the results give a list of the most explanatory variables, in this case spe- cies. mean per site abundances (square root trans- formed) were plotted across years for inﬂuential species. and allows hydrology we quantiﬁed stream hydrology using united states geological survey (usgs) discharge (m3s  1) data obtained from two gauging stations on the pearl river, one located in monticello, ms (upper pearl river survey area usgs 02488500) and the other in bogalusa, la (lower pearl river survey area usgs 02489500). annual mean discharge was graphed for each area across the study period. to assess possible effects of hydrologic variation on assemblage struc- ture, we examined the relationship between annual discharge and nmds axis scores from prior analysis, using spearman correlation methods. because the timing of extreme ﬂow events can determine how and to what degree a community is impacted (durham & wilde 2009; taylor 2010), we also examined differences in seasonal discharge across years using mean daily discharge (m3s  1) data. 631 geheber & piller mean daily discharge was log10 transformed to stan- dardise across years. the addition of these data allowed correlations between assemblage structure dynamics and discharge variability during years of extreme low discharge. results the 22-year a total of 698,609 ﬁsh specimens were collected from the pearl river between january 1988 and november 2009, including 98 species (appendix i). over sampling period, 6 species accounted for 90.54% of the specimens collected. these included cyprinella venusta (54.57%), hybo- gnathus nuchalis vigilax (9.28%), notropis volucellus (6.39%), notropis lon- girostris (5.72%) and notropis texanus (4.44%). all other species collected made up <10% of the total collections. (10.14%), pimephales of overall specimens abundance collected decreased across the sample period, with an initial abundance total of 50,362 in 1988, and a ﬁnal yearly abundance of 9543 in 2009 (r2 = 0.45) (fig. 2a). the highest abundance occurred in 1995 (56,091) and the lowest in 2006 (7,819). there was also an overall decrease in rareﬁed species richness across all years (r² = 0.39) (fig. 2b). spatio-temporal variation of assemblage structure the two-way anosim that tested data in a crossed layout, with locations and years as factors, reported signiﬁcant (global r = 0.192, p < 0.001) and signiﬁcant area groups groups across areas year (a) (b) 60 000 50 000 40 000 30 000 20 000 10 000 e c n a d n u b a 0 55 50 45 40 35 30 s s e n h c i r s e c e p s i 25 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 fig. 2.

however the changes in assemblage structure across time occurred in a similar manner (fig. 3). although time was assessed independently later in the study, such analyses may have been deemed inappropriate without the knowledge of the spatio-temporal interac- tion at hand (i.e., because no time 9 space interac- tion was recovered, and both the upper and lower areas signiﬁcantly shared the same temporal pattern, combining years was acceptable and aided in describ- ing temporal relationships). the similar structural trends found between the upper and lower areas across the study period indi- cated that assemblages of each area have experienced shifts in structure at similar temporal intervals despite the observed differences in assemblage composition between the upper and lower areas. moreover, both (a) ) 1 – s · 3 m ( fish assemblage structural patterns 2000 2007 upper lower 300 1.0 0 100 200 day of year fig. 7. the log10 mean daily discharge (m3s  1) across all study years in each the upper and lower areas. mean daily discharge is represented by black hashes, and the surrounding grey area is the standard deviation of daily means across years. additionally, daily means for drought years (2000 and 2007) were overlaid for both the upper and lower areas. areas showed similar lack of assemblage equilibrium across time, as depicted by nmds (fig. 4) (i.e., early years differed structurally from more recent years). in general, a spatial distinction, as well as within-area temporal distinctions, was observed (as demonstrated by anosim). hansen & ramm (1994) recovered simi- lar results yielding a distinction between upstream and downstream areas, as well as similar within-area temporal distinctions in a new york stream; how- ever, their study lacked continuous sampling effort across its temporal scope. indicates the signiﬁcant two study areas spatial differentiation observed between the strong geographic inﬂuences on local ﬁsh assemblages. this differentiation may be inﬂuenced by differing geomorphologies of the river channel following the spatial gradient of study. for example, gorman & karr (1978), and schlosser (1982) found an increase in assemblage and habitat diversity following the stream-order gradients in multiple streams. factors including differing ﬂows and stream area may also lead to variability in habitat choice and availability between areas as indicated by magoulick & kobza (2003). in our study, species that contributed most to 635 geheber & piller area differences include greater abundances of multi- ple pelagic minnows (cyprinidae) and one species of darter (percidae) ammocrypta beanii in the lower area, and greater abundances of lepomis megalotis (centrarchidae) in the upper area. species characteris- ing the lower area tend to prefer structurally simple habitats (i.e., habitats lacking in stream debris and vegetation), whereas species characterising the upper area may be more preferential towards habitats with the addition of vegetation and woody debris (ross 2001). this corroborates the river continuum concept, where as stream discharge increases, the proportion and vegetation to discharge of woody debris decreases (vannote et al. 1980). however, this is only speculative owing to the lack of habitat vari- ables collected across the study period. when viewed across the temporal scale of study, the pearl river ﬁsh assemblage was characterised by a general decrease in both species richness and abun- dance between 1988 and 2009. our analyses yielded two large deviations in assemblage structure which were depicted as sequential group ‘breakups’ across years. these two signiﬁcant alterations in assemblage structure were correlated with environmental pertur- bation events. the ﬁrst event being a drought year in 2000, which was followed by alterations of abun- dances of several species as well as a decrease in spe- cies richness in 2001 (fig. 2b). although our results depict two drought years (2000 and 2007) across the frame of study, we only found a disruption in sea- sonal discharge pattern in 2000. years characterised by low ﬂow have been shown to strongly affect recruitment and young of year survival in many stream ﬁshes (freeman et al. 1988; matthews & marsh-matthews 2003). however, the timing of annual discharge regime also plays a key role in determining biological impacts (durham & wilde 2009; taylor 2010). a large portion of temperate stream ﬁshes spawn during peak spring ﬂows (ross & baker 1983; zeug & winemiller 2008), and years lacking these spring ﬂows may cause alterations in community structure. our data suggest that the low discharge and uncharacteristic ﬂow pattern observed in 2000 altered recruitment in many species, causing decreases in abundances of many species the follow- ing years (this is further discussed later). the second alteration in assemblage structure occurred following the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of 2005. our results report a divergence in ﬁsh assemblage struc- ture following the hurricanes of 2005, which is fur- ther characterised by a sharp decrease in species richness in the following year (fig. 2b). although the effects of hurricanes on ﬁshes of freshwater systems have not received much focus, existing studies indi- cate a need for attention. schaefer et al. (2006) found 636 hydrologic ﬂuctuation to the pearl, ﬁsh assemblage structural changes in the neighbour- ing pascagoula river, a basin with a nearly identical ichthyofauna following hurricane katrina. mallin et al. (1999) reported the effects of multiple hurricanes in the cape fear watershed, nc, including decreased dissolved oxygen levels and massive ﬁsh kills. during hurricane events, biological oxygen demand increases because of high woody and leaf debris input. moreover, heavy ﬂooding may cause increased erosion and thereby sedimentation and nutrient loading in streams (mallin et al. 2002). the pearl river experienced a dramatic spike in dis- charge as hurricane katrina moved inland in late august of 2005 (appendix iii). this was a rather dramatic it occurred during the summer when discharge is nor- mally minimal. such a sudden increase in discharge was likely accompanied by increased in-stream debris and sediment loading. following the impact, ﬁsh kills were reported in the system (mississippi deq 2006), which likely contributed to the alterations in assem- blage structure seen thereafter. considering species found to be most inﬂuential on assemblage changes across time generally showed the pattern of decreasing abundances. however, some species show stable abundances within year clusters including cyp- rinella venusta and pimephales vigilax. this indicates a more direct effect of environmental disturbances (drought and hurricane) rather than a gradual loss of abundances. both c. venusta and p. vigilax are non- benthic substrate generalists (ross 2001) and are therefore not as reliant on speciﬁc substrata for most ecological functioning. however, both c. venusta, crevice spawning (pﬂieger 1975), and p. vigilax, egg- clustering (page & ceas 1989), do rely on substrate availability for reproduction. during low ﬂow periods, as seen in 2000, there may have been less available substrate for reproductive efforts of these species, con- tributing to the declines in abundances in following years. macrhybopsis aestivalis, a benthic sand-gravel specialist, was relatively abundant during early years of the study, but was rarely collected following 1996. this loss in abundance was not correlated with any speciﬁc environmental event and instead was gradual. piller et al. (2004) reported m. aestivalis as being extremely abundant in the pearl river prior to 1988, when it was the third most abundant species collected during earlier surveys (1955–1988). previous studies (berkman & rabeni 1987; tipton et al. 2004; stewart et al. 2005) found similar decreases and/or losses of benthic species, acknowledging instability within the stream channel as a possible contributor. many stream modiﬁcations including dredging, snagging, naviga- tion channel development and dam and reservoir con- struction have occurred in the pearl river, which may be responsible for geomorphic instability. despite the decreases in the abundance of many species following the drought of 2000, hybognathus nuchalis showed a sharp increase in abundance. the observed increase in h. nuchalis may be partially explained by its diet, which was described as bottom ooze by whitaker (1977), and includes sand, silt, fungal material, decaying plant material and diatoms. in a degraded system following drought conditions, species such as p. vigilax, n. texanus and c. venu- sta, whose diets consist partially of insects and or insect larvae (hambrick & hibbs 1977; whitaker 1977; felley & felley 1987; ross 2001), may have struggled to ﬁnd food resources. as noted by mat- thews & marsh-matthews (2003), the effects of drought on ﬁshes may be partially driven by changes in invertebrate food availability. this is based on the suggestion that many aquatic invertebrates are also negatively affected by drought conditions, including declines in abundance (griswold et al. 1982). the less limiting, readily available diet of h. nuchalis may have allowed increased survival during periods of drought resulting in higher abundances within the following year. not much is known of h. nuchalis reproductive biology; however, the increase in abun- dance could be linked to some beneﬁcial reproductive timing and/or spawning strategy. lehtinen & leyzer (1988) found spawning to be stimulated by abrupt rises in ﬂow in populations of hybognathus placitus in the midwestern united states. a study by turner et al. (2010) found poor recruitment of hybognathus amarus in the rio grande during a year when no spring ﬂood pulse occurred. the following year under spring ﬂood conditions, h. amarus comprised a dominant portion of the spring larval assemblage. it is possible that the closely related h. nuchalis may have spawned at a more beneﬁcial time of greater ﬂow during the drought period, diminishing the chance of egg mortality through desiccation, and increasing survivorship into the next year. moreover, h. nuchalis produce nonadhesive pelagic embryos that freely ﬂow with current (simon 1999). this may further aid in embryo survival during receding water levels, as they are able to move with the water level, rather than being ‘left out to dry’. previous studies have reported alteration of assem- blage structure as a consequence of environmental disturbances (e.g., ross et al. 1985; matthews 1986). furthermore, many of these studies noted recovery following disturbance events (ross et al. 1985; mat- thews 1986). our study suggests a lack of recovery in assemblage structure across time. although assem- blage structure did not recover within the system, we did see recovery in species richness and overall abun- dance shortly following environmental perturbation events. the alterations in assemblage structure follow- ing environmental ﬂuctuations would seem to support fish assemblage structural patterns the idea of a stochastic structuring process within assemblages across time (grossman et al. 1982), rather than deterministic organisation (grossman 1982). however, we did ﬁnd that assemblage struc- ture maintains some within-group organisation for substantial periods prior to and following environ- mental events. this indicates that between perturba- tions other processes (i.e., biotic interactions) may play a role in assemblage organisation in the absence of extreme environmental ﬂuctuations. strange et al. (1992) found a similar alternation between stochastic and deterministic processes in a california ﬁsh assem- blage, rather than a single persistent equilibrium. this in conclusion, study revealed assemblage structural distinctions across both the temporal and spatial breadth of investigation. the assessment of distinct spatio-temporal patterns in the ﬁsh assem- blage of the pearl river over nearly a quarter of a century is indicative of signiﬁcant change in compari- son with normal variability. the recovered shifts in assemblage structure across time further support the idea that environmental perturbation events, both his- torical (i.e., dam construction and channel modiﬁca- tions) and contemporary (i.e., droughts, ﬂoods and hurricanes), do play vital roles in structuring assem- blages. this study illuminates the importance of large temporal and spatial scales when assessing patterns of assemblage structure. the structural differentia- tions we recovered may have easily gone undetected at lesser scales. furthermore, the continuous standar- dised sampling regime used across the entire breadth of study allowed an intimate characterisation and complete historical account of assemblage structure rarely seen in other long-term studies. acknowledgements we would like to dedicate this manuscript to the late royal d. suttkus, who initiated this study in the 1950s.
