kolok 1992; tschantz et al. 2002) and form aggregations (carlson 1992; raibley et al. 1997; karchesky & bennett 2004; suski & ridgway in review). similar winter aggregations have also been observed for other centrarchid ﬁshes (e.g., breder & nigrelli 1935). some anecdotal evidence suggests that aggregations occur primarily during the day, with aggregated individuals dispersing at night (breder & nigrelli 1935). recent studies of winter aggregations of largemouth bass and other centrarchids in the wild; however, have been limited to few position measurements acquired during manual telemetry stud- ies, or have been dependent on observations and samples from anglers (greenbank 1956; carlson 1992; karchesky & bennett 2004). doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00239.x 417 hasler et al. while the phenomenon of winter aggregation among largemouth bass has been documented (green- bank 1956; carlson 1992; karchesky & bennett 2004), to our knowledge, no study has demonstrated that aggregations form outside the winter period. a radio telemetry study by essington & kitchell (1999) demonstrated that multiple largemouth bass frequent particular locations and thus could have the opportunity to aggregate. unfortunately, their sample points were taken at coarse spatial and temporal scales and lacked the resolution to assess the presence of meaningful aggregations. moreover, the study by essington & kitchell (1999) did not encompass the spawning period when aggregations between at least a single male and female pair must occur. males will attract females to their nest for spawning bouts, though the time scale over which these bouts occur is on the order of minutes to hours and would likely not be recorded in most telemetry studies. here, we quantify the occurrence of largemouth bass aggregations in both the winter and the spring using spatial/temporal data from acoustically tagged individuals, within a ﬁxed, code division multiple access (cdma) telemetry array (niezgoda et al. 2002). more speciﬁcally, we asked two main ques- tions: (i) do individual largemouth bass form winter and/or spring associations and with whom? and if they do, (ii) what are the temporal and spatial characteristics of these associations? materials and methods study site and telemetry observatory warner lake is a freshwater lake in eastern ontario that is located entirely within the property of the queen’s university biological station (qubs; 44°31¢n, 76°22¢w). warner lake has a surface area of 8.3 ha and is composed of two basins; a smaller shallow basin that deﬁnes the north section of the lake (maximum depth of 3 m) and a larger deep basin (maximum depth of 7 m) that deﬁnes the southern section of the lake. the lake is a closed system with inﬂows and outﬂows that are mainly subterranean and not large enough for the movement of ﬁsh. details on the plant and ﬁsh community of warner lake can be found in cooke et al. (2005) and hanson et al. (in press). in 2003, a ﬁxed, submerged acoustic telemetry array consisting of a cdma-based telemetry system (lotek map 600, lotek wireless inc., newmarket, canada; niezgoda et al. 2002; cooke et al. 2005) and 13 hydrophones was installed in the lake. the moored hydrophones, placed 2 m below the water surface, were connected to two receivers located on shore through cabling. to enable operation during winter periods and seasonal 418 transitions, hydrophone cabling running to the recei- ver on shore was routed through insulated acrylo- nitrile-butadiene-styrene (abs) piping at the water’s surface for protection from surface ice. collected data were exported to personal computers for processing via ﬂash storage cards. positions are triangulated when three or more hydrophones are within acoustic range of a ping from a transmitter and the positions have been found to have sub-metre accuracy (further detail on the operation and accuracy of the system can be found in cooke et al. 2005). study animals fish capture occurred between 14 october and 16 october 2003. twelve male and eight female large- mouth bass were captured by angling, and sex was determined by visual inspection and conﬁrmed by internal visual inspection during subsequent surgeries. cdma temperature–pressure sensing acoustic trans- mitters (lotek ctp-m11-55, 11 · 55 mm, burst rate 15 s, life expectancy of 270 ± 30 days, depth resolu- temperature resolution ±0.5 °c) were tion ±0.7 m, implanted intraperitoneally by a single trained surgeon using the techniques described in detail by cooke et al. (2005) and hanson et al. (in press). data processing and analysis raw data obtained from the observatory receivers were ﬁltered to remove erroneous position solutions (caused by echos, interference, multipath, etc.), result- ing in approximately 75% of position solutions being included (realised sampling rate of 20 s; cooke et al. 2005). filtered tables were then queried to determine the mean position for each ﬁsh during each hour over a 5-day (120 h) sample period starting at midnight 1 january 2004 and ending at midnight 6 january 2004. these days deﬁned our winter study period and were chosen as representative of days with stable water temperature during ice cover on the lake (hanson et al. in press). the period starting at midnight on 9 april 2004 and ending at midnight on 14 april 2004 was also assessed in an identical manner, and deﬁned our spring study period. these days were chosen as representative of other post-ice off period during the spring and were prior to the start of the spring spawn when many ﬁsh move outside the footprint of the array and positioning of tagged ﬁsh less reliable. for this study, an ‘association’ between two largemouth bass was deemed to have occurred when their mean hourly x, y and z positions were within 2 m of each other for a minimum duration of 60 min. this deﬁnition was chosen in response to a food reward study with largemouth bass where it was determined that ﬁsh could distinguish different ﬁshing lines at distances <2 m, but could not differentiate ﬁshing lines at distances >2 m, suggesting a decrease in visual acuity at distances beyond 2 m (miller & janzow 1979). to assess the temporal characteristics of any associations, sunrise and sunset times for warner lake on the sampled days were found at http://www.sunrisesun- set.com (accessed 3 april 2006; eastern standard time zone), allowing the timing of each association to be categorised as ‘day’ or ‘night.’ processed data were exported to arcgis 9 (arcmap v9.1; esri, redland, ca, usa) for association analysis. it should be noted that during both of the 5-day periods all ﬁsh had calculable average hourly positions and contributed equally to the analysis. statistical methods to analyse the data, we compared the number of associations per individual occurring in the winter study period to the number of associations per individual occurring in the spring study period using repeated measures anova. a signiﬁcant difference would imply a difference in the number of associations per individual occurring across study periods. to compare each individual and the amount of time spent associating during each study period, the number of associations per day by each ﬁsh was assessed for both the winter and the spring study period using repeated measures anova. a signiﬁcant difference within each study period would indicate differences among indi- viduals and the number of associations they participate in. all statistical analyses were performed using jmp 6.0.2 (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa) and at a conﬁdence level of 95%. sex of associating ﬁsh was tested against a uniform distribution using a chi-squared test for the winter study period. observed values were the number of male–male, male–female and female–female associa- seasonal largemouth bass associations tions, and the expected values were found by dividing the total number of associations by 3 (the number of categories). all chi-squared tests and frequency distributions were performed using the data analysis tool pack in microsoft excel 2003 (zar 1984). in addition, mcquitty linkage analysis was conduc- ted for each tagged largemouth bass with three or more associations over the 5-day study periods (mcquitty 1966). mcquitty linkage analysis examines the num- ber of pairwise links between ﬁsh and identiﬁes ‘core’ reciprocal pairs that are most often linked to each other. all other ﬁsh are then assigned to the ﬁsh to which they are most linked. typically, this analysis partition individuals into several groups surrounding the cores. to include only ‘core’ largemouth bass we used three associations between a pair of ﬁsh as the minimum limit for inclusion in the mcquitty linkage analysis because when the number of associations was plotted per individual there was a clear natural break in the data set at 3 (data not shown). once all associations in the two study periods had been quantiﬁed, associations were investigated spa- tially by calculating kernel density estimations (95% and 50%; h ¼ 25) using the hawth’s tool in arcgis 9 (arcmap v9.1; esri; beyer 2004) to identify the location of the majority of associations. associations were also assessed to determine any temporal patterns in the dates and times of associations compared with sunrise and sunset times using chi- squared analysis. results quantitative and qualitative description of associations during the winter study period tagged largemouth bass remained in the large deep basin, whereas during the spring period most tagged ﬁsh were located in the fig. 1. hourly positions for four largemouth bass [ﬁsh 3 (solid, black star), 5 (solid, black circle), 8 (solid, black cross) and 16 (solid, grey circle with black outline)] for 1 january 2004 (a, winter) and 1 april 2004 (b, spring) as obtained from a code division multiple access equipped submerged acoustic hydro- phone array. each unique symbol represents one average hourly position for each ﬁsh. 419 hasler et al. small shallow basin (fig. 1). when ﬁsh were associ- ating during the winter, there were 3.4 ± 0.2 individ- uals participating each hour and the association period (the number of hours between when the ﬁrst associ- ations occurred and when the last associations occurred) lasted 9.4 ± 1.5 h (fig. 2). when ﬁsh were associating during the spring, there were 5.6 ± 0.6 individuals participating each hour and the association period lasted at 3.6 ± 1.9 h. statistically, in the winter there were fewer the associating period for the day was longer (t-test;

group 2 ¼ ﬁsh 2 (#), 3 ($), 8 ($), 11 (#) and 18 ($); and group 3 ¼ ﬁsh 4 ($), 9 (#), 11 (#), 14 (#) and 20 (#) (fig. 4). the third group was the most coherent with most of the group members, with the exception of ﬁsh 14, associating with the entire group. the second group was less connected, although ﬁsh 2, 3, 11 and 18 associated with other ﬁsh in the group. in addition, ﬁsh 11 was the only ﬁsh that associated with two groups. because spring associations were more sporadic and most did not last for more than an hour, a mcquitty linkage analysis was not performed. temporal and spatial characteristics of associations although the mean number of daily associations was 16.0 ± 9.4 (n ¼ 5) for the winter study period and 16.8 ± 17.4 (n ¼ 5) for the spring study period, the number of associations varied among days (table 1). during the spring study period, over half of the associations occurred on one day (13 april 2004), with one day (11 april 2004) contributing zero associations. in both seasons, associations occurred signiﬁcantly more often during daylight hours (winter study period: rmanova;

carlson 1992), be useful for protection against predators (godin & morgan 1985) and be indicative of genetic relatedness between group members (fraser et al. 2005). indeed, centrarchid species such as smallmouth bass (m. dolomieu, lacepe`de), largemouth bass and redbreast sunﬁsh (lepomis auritus, linnaeus) have been shown to form multi-individual aggregations during the winter (townsend 1916; breder & nigrelli 1935; carlson 1992). reasons for forming aggregations during the winter include crowding caused by reduced lake area and fewer areas of suitable habitat with respect to temperature and dissolved oxygen (breder & nigrelli 1935; carlson 1992). for largemouth bass, carlson (1992) found that 59% of the estimated largemouth bass population in the hudson river estuary aggre- gate at ﬁve winter refugia, but that study was only able to determine ﬁsh positions following ice-out. our study is the ﬁrst to quantify largemouth bass aggre- gations in the winter at ﬁne spatial and temporal scales, and also show that those aggregations are not stable throughout the winter. moreover, we were able to demonstrate through our mcquitty linkage analysis that there are multiple aggregations and the member- ship in those aggregations varies. though we found no statistical difference between individuals and associations between the winter and spring study period, we did ﬁnd that the spring associations were more sporadic and more variable. 422 the associations formed during the spring study period were typically short-term, often only lasting 1 h, whereas several winter associations lasted up to 6 h (data not shown). we suggest that there are three possible reasons for the characteristics of the associ- ation between tagged largemouth bass observed during the spring study period. first, as water temperature rises in the spring, largemouth bass become more active (kolok 1992; hanson et al. in press) and feed more to promote gamete formation (mackereth et al. 1999). because largemouth are active cruising pred- ators, ﬁsh would likely only be in areas for short periods of time to feed and then would move on, thus associations did not last long. secondly, during the spring, if a male bass attempts to spawn, he builds a solitary nest in the near-shore environment (breder & rosen 1966). thus, male largemouth bass are more likely to be alone in the shallows for a greater portion of the day rather than in aggregations during our spring study period as they begin the process of searching for suitable nest sites (waters & noble 2004). lending credence to this idea, three of the tagged male bass in our study spawned immediately after our spring study period, and were observed not to be associating with other tagged ﬁsh during that time. associations between sexes of largemouth bass occurred frequently in this study. in our data, based on the sex ratio of tagged individuals, we observed signiﬁcantly more male–female associations during both the winter and the spring and signiﬁcantly fewer female–female associations compared with an expec- ted uniform distribution. male–female associations were observed to occur four times more often than female–female associations, while the proportion of male–male associations during the winter did not occur more frequently than would be expected if associations were uniform. the increased frequency of male–female associations during the winter and spring may be attributed to prespawning activity (breder & rosen 1966) and 20 years of observations of large- mouth bass spawning has produced numerous obser- vations of tagged individual females spawning with different males (and the reverse) both within a single season, and among years (d. p. philipp, illinois natural history survey, personal communication). indeed, it may be important for largemouth bass to associate with the opposite sex prespawn to determine pair-bonds for siring young. our data also demonstrated that associations between tagged largemouth bass exhibited a pro- nounced diel component, with over 97 times more associations occurring during the day than at night. previous research on centrarchid aggregations indica- ted that although they are present over long periods of time (i.e., throughout the season), on a daily basis individuals disperse nightly and reform aggregations the formation of aggregations, and, during the day (breder & nigrelli 1935). based on the results of controlled laboratory studies, breder & nigrelli (1935) suggested that visual cues were needed for therefore, aggregations dissolve at night when vision is limited. our ﬁeld-based results demonstrated that aggregations rarely formed outside of daylight hours in both the winter and the spring study period, which is consistent with the results found by breder & nigrelli (1935). considering the apparent long-term stability of these aggregations, it is interesting that the members of the associations and the number of associations varied across the 5-day study period. previous ﬁeld and laboratory studies have suggested largemouth bass are dormant during the winter (crawshaw 1984; demers et al. 1996; cooke et al. 2003). because we found aggregations forming and dispersing daily and the individuals in the aggregations varied daily, it can be implied ﬁsh are moving considerably and are not dormant (also see hanson et al. in press). although we did not measure light levels under ice in the winter, ice and snow cover (ice depth was approximately 1 m and snow cover was approximately 0.2 m; f. j. s. phelan, queen’s university biology station, personal com- munication) were unlikely to be sufﬁciently thick to have obscured all light. our kernel density coverage indicated there was also a spatial component to associations between tagged largemouth bass, as evidenced by the fact that 95% of our observed associations were restricted to only a few, relatively small areas. formation of aggregations, and presumably associations among speciﬁc individuals, may indicate ﬁsh are optimising their habitat choices, possibly seeking to inhabit areas with optimal tem- perature, dissolved oxygen and/or presence of food and macrophyte beds (breder & nigrelli 1935; beamish 1970; carlson 1992; raibley et al. 1997; karchesky & bennett 2004). many aggregations are believed to occur during the winter periods because decreases in the number of areas with suitable environmental conditions tend to concentrate ﬁsh (carlson 1992). ice cover in the littoral zone coupled with decreases in temperature and dissolved oxygen content can lead to loss of suitable ﬁsh habitat (breder & nigrelli 1935; greenbank 1956; carlson 1992; karchesky & bennett 2004). both breder & nigrelli (1935) and karchesky & bennett (2004) found that as temperature decreased during the fall–winter interface, aggregations among centrarchid ﬁsh increased, and the aggregations were stable until temperature decreased to fatal levels or signiﬁcant warming occurred. karchesky & bennett (2004) suggest the warmest locations in a water body. during the spring, the lake has more available suitable habitat because the water is warmer, dissolved oxygen levels are ‘normal’ (i.e., normoxic), and there is more area of the lake largemouth bass will seek out seasonal largemouth bass associations available for ﬁsh to disperse to. having more suitable habitat available may decrease the likelihood of ﬁsh aggregating (breder & nigrelli 1935). locations throughout temporally and within individuals, because associations were found to occur at particular the lake we must explore the possibility that concentrations in ﬁsh were due to desirable environmental conditions. because ﬁsh were found to be mobile and associations varied spatially, the paradigm that largemouth bass are quiescent in the winter can be questioned. future research on this topic should include: (i) an examination of environmental variables that may affect associations; (ii) a genetic investigation of the kin relationships among associ- ating and nonassociating ﬁsh and (iii) a long-term study on winter aggregation using an entire winter season. collectively, this information should provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of winter aggregations and the factors which inﬂuence individual sociality. acknowledgements funding for transmitters was partially provided by the univer- sity of illinois research board. cth was supported by the summer work experience program at queen’s university;
