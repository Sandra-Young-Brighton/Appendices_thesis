(2003) showed that the effect of the distance from the sea is not necessarily signiﬁcant in small coastal rivers where the eel population is dense, probably because the entire catchment network can be colonised quickly. in this situation, habitat suitability is of primary importance, as it is in coastal marshes (laffaille et al. 2004). however, eel distribution is 610 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00378.x strongly affected by habitat accessibility, i.e., density of obstacles and whether they are passable or not. indeed, hydraulic schemes constitute a physical obstacle to free upstream (laffaille et al. 2007) and lateral (lasne et al. 2008) movement and migration, and unless they are correctly managed (laffaille et al. 2005a), limit the area where the eel is present. consequently, briand et al. (2005) showed that the density of eels in the vilaine catchment (france) is correlated more closely to the number of migration barriers than to the distance from the tidal limit. is an important the european eel resource in conservation, ecological and socio-economic terms (see feunteun 2002; baisez & laffaille 2005). how- ever, since the 1980s, the abundance of the european eel has declined throughout its distribution range (moriarty & dekker 1997; dekker 2003). the eu has urged all member states to take steps to assess all the causes of mortality that are affecting the local eel population, and to restore eel stocks (council regu- lation ec 1100 ⁄ 2007, council of the european union 2007). major migration barriers have had a negative impact on the distribution of most european diadro- mous ﬁshes (lassalle et al. 2009), and construction of migration barriers has been identiﬁed as a major factor responsible for the plummeting freshwater eel stocks (moriarty & dekker 1997; feunteun 2002; laffaille et al. 2007). unfortunately, even in countries where public opinion is sensitive to environmental protection and to sustainable development, ﬁnancial, political and logistical tools for ecological management are limited (see bergerot et al. 2008), and it is not possible to manage or remove all the migration barriers. as a consequence, it is urgent to develop methods to help managers to restore species and habitats, and to alter migration barriers to boost the passage of diadromous in this study, we ﬁshes (kocovsky et al. 2009). developed a methodology intended to assist those managing migration barriers to increase eel presence throughout the entire loire catchment. we began by devising a model of the probability of the presence of various size-classes of eel in the catchment area of the loire (france) according to the distance from the tidal limit, of habitat suitability and habitat accessibility. in the second step, we looked at what these models predicted if habitat accessibility was improved. then strategies were developed to four management improve habitat accessibility covering: the migration barriers from the tidal limits to various different upstream limits (downstream–upstream strat- egy), (ii) all the migration barriers with a given degree of passability (migration barrier passability class strategy), (iii) all the migration barriers in a given sub-catchment area (sub-catchment strategy) and (iv) all the migration barriers in the entire loire catchment (global strategy). (i) all improvement of longitudinal connectivity for eel materials and methods study area the loire is the largest french river (1012 km long), and it drains a catchment of 118,000 km2 (fig. 1). the total length of the river network is estimated to be 107,000 km. the main axis of the basin (i.e., the loire river itself, and its main upstream tributary, the allier river) has good longitudinal connectivity, and there are no signiﬁcant migration barriers in its lower reaches (<500 km from the tidal limit). conversely, most of the tributaries, which are quite large (>20,000 km2), have been largely regulated by barriers, few of which are passable by ﬁsh. for example, the density of major migration barriers is particularly high (>25 per 100 km) in the main part of the maine sub-catchment, even in the most downstream reaches (the ﬁrst weir is located only 7 km upstream from its conﬂuence with the loire river). in this study, only large migration barriers with an upstream crest height above the downstream water levels were considered. these included water-level maintenance structures for mills, hydropower systems or drinking water storage, but not small hydraulic systems such as culverts and ﬂow gauging systems, which we ignored because of their very high density. data set we used the long-term data set of the national french fishing council (now known as onema). this data set is provided by a network of sampling sites distributed throughout the entire loire catchment, sampled every year between 1995 and 2003. sampling was carried out in late summer when water levels were low. sampling was done by electroﬁshing, either by wading in shallow waters, or from a boat in deeper areas (see oberdorff et al. 2001; lasne et al. 2007; lasne & laffaille 2008 for further details). abundance data have been poorly used in the context of conservation, probably because of the difﬁculty of obtaining standardised and reliable abun- dance data especially for eel populations in open and ⁄ or large water systems (naismith & knights 1990; jellyman & graynoth 2005; bark et al. 2007). on the other hand, faced with the widespread problem related to the difﬁculty of obtaining reliable and usable data sets, recent advances in conservation biology have suggested that presence–absence data are partic- ularly suitable for assessing species distribution in a conservation context (mackenzie 2005; vojta 2005). despite their simplicity, such input data can provide reliable information about ﬁsh assemblages (ibarra et al. 2005; lasne et al. 2007), some ﬁsh species (oberdorff et al. 2001; pont et al. 2005), migratory ﬁshes (eikaas & macintosh 2006), and eel distribution 611 laffaille et al. maine dowstream loire middle reaches of the loire indre-cher vienne-creuse allier (broad et al. 2001; lasne & laffaille 2008). never- theless, based on the assumption that ﬁsh assemblages did not change signiﬁcantly in the course of the study, as there were no changes in environmental variables (lasne and laffaille, unpublished data), and in order to include more information, we used the probability of presence (po) during the study period (i.e., the number of years in which the species was detected divided by the total number of sampling years per site; ranging from 0, i.e., the species was never detected in the site, to 1, i.e., the species was always detected in the site) as an index of local species abundance. we used the sites at least seven times during the nine sampling years, and eliminated any sites where stocking was strongly suspected. our total data set was composed of 123 sites with data for the po for different size-classes of eels: <300, 300–450 and >450 mm. these classes correspond to ontogenetic and behavioural shifts (see feunteun et al. 2003; laffaille et al. 2003, 2005b; lasne et al. 2008), although such divisions are somewhat arbitrary and ﬂexible and depend on the characteristics of the catchment (laffaille et al. 2004) and of the individ- ual ⁄ sub-population (daverat et al. 2006). the ﬁrst size-class corresponds mainly to ﬂuvial recruitment, i.e., the youngest and most recently recruited individ- uals colonising the river system. the other two size- classes mainly reﬂect sedentary male and female eels, respectively (see rigaud et al. 2008). the loire basin displays a wide range of habitat conditions (table 1), ranging from mountain and foot- hill streams, to large lowland rivers. habitat suitability was described by measuring the distance from the tidal limit and to the source (km), the upstream drainage area (km2), the altitude (m), the mean depth (m), the mean width (m), the slope (&), and the mean air temperature 612 upstream loire fig. 1. the loire, the main sub-catchments and the sampling sites. the loire river was sub-divided in three sub-catchment areas: the downstream loire sub-catchment (from the sea to the maine conﬂuence), the middle reaches of the loire sub-catchment (from the maine to the allier conﬂuence), and the upstream loire sub-catchment (upstream from the allier conﬂuence). (°c) during the coldest month (in january) and during the warmest month (in july). slope was measured as the altitude of the ﬁshing station divided by the the distance from the tidal limit. air temperature was used as a substitute for water temperature, as they are closely correlated (pont et al. 2005). habitat accessibility was quantiﬁed using an expert assessment of how likely it was that eel could get through the migration barrier (according to the meth- odology of steinbach, onema, unpublished data). habitat accessibility can be deﬁned by assigning a score of passability to each migration barrier, based on ﬁve criteria: vertical height, proﬁle, roughness, the effect of the banks, and the diversity of crossing routes. the vertical height gives a score to the migration barrier that is balanced by the other criteria. in the end, the passability of the migration barrier is classiﬁed using six classes: class 0 (erased migration barrier and ⁄ or no obstacle), class 1 (passable without any apparent difﬁculty), class 2 (passable with a risk of delay), class 3 (only just passable), class 4 (passable with considerable difﬁculty) and class 5 (totally impassable). in this study, we pooled the scores of migration barriers lying downstream from the station sampled. this score gives a cumulative indication of the difﬁculty that faces an individual coloniser from the tidal limit en route to a point in the water network, regardless of distance or of the characteristics of the habitats colonised (see muchiut et al. 2008 and annexe 8 of http://www.ifremer.fr/indicang/documentation/ pdf/liste-annexes-guide-method.pdf for more details). statistical analysis to construct predictive models, ecologists use many methods, ranging from numerical, mathematical and t n e m h c t a c l a t o t e r i o l m a e r t s p u r e i l l a r e h c - e r d n i e s u e r c - e n n e v i e r i o l e h t f o s e h c a e r l e d d m i i e n a m e r i o l m a e r t s n w o d ) 5 1 1 1 1 ( 9 7 4 2 . ) 3 6 2 1 ( 5 . 7 6 ) 9 . 9 4 ( . 5 1 2 ) 8 1 ( . 5 2 . ) 3 . 6 2 2 ( . 0 1 1 4 ) 6 7 ( . ) 4 . 0 ( 1 5 . 6 . 0 ) 2 . 2 2 1 ( . 3 7 1 7 ) 0 . 2 ( 2 . 3 ) 2 9 5 3 ( 6 6 4 1 ) 4 . 5 9 ( . 8 2 6 . ) 6 1 4 ( 0 . 3 2 ) 9 . 3 1 ( ) 2 0 ( . 8 . 9 4 0 . . ) 2 6 1 1 ( . 2 0 1 7 ) 6 0 ( . 9 0 . ) 8 7 5 2 ( 1 8 1 1 . ) 9 3 8 ( . 0 2 6 ) 1 9 ( . . 5 1 1 ) 9 7 ( . . 0 0 1 ) 2 0 ( . 5 0 . ) 4 1 ( . 9 . 2 ) 1 7 1 1 ( 9 3 7 . ) 6 6 6 ( 3 . 8 5 ) 7 . 1 1 ( 2 . 2 1 . ) 9 3 9 ( 6 . 7 9 3 ) 7 . 4 ( ) 4 0 ( . 5 . 3 6 . 0 ) 0 . 2 ( 9 . 2 ) 1 1 0 4 ( 2 7 1 1 ) 4 . 3 7 ( 3 . 2 4 ) 4 . 5 2 ( 2 . 5 1 ) 4 . 5 8 ( 7 . 5 4 3 ) 5 . 5 ( . ) 2 0 ( 7 . 5 5 . 0 ) 3 . 4 8 2 ( . 5 7 7 2 ) 4 . 1 3 3 ( 6 . 9 4 5 . ) 9 0 5 3 ( . 1 5 3 6 ) 2 . 5 4 1 ( 0 . 5 1 2 . ) 1 7 7 1 ( 2 . 1 6 2 ) 5 1 ( . 9 2 . ) 6 1 ( . . 2 8 1 ) 4 . 1 ( 3 1 . ) 0 2 ( . 2 . 8 1 ) 8 . 1 ( 0 1 . ) 1 . 3 ( 4 . 6 1 ) 4 . 0 ( 3 3 . ) 1 1 ( . 9 . 8 1 ) 7 . 0 ( 2 3 . ) 1 1 ( . 4 . 8 1 . ) 3 4 4 1 ( . 0 2 3 3 ) 0 1 ( . 8 0 . ) 0 5 6 4 1 ( 9 6 8 6 ) 4 . 8 1 1 ( . 7 0 6 ) 2 . 7 3 2 ( . 6 9 3 1 ) 7 . 0 ( ) 4 0 ( . 2 1 . . 7 0 . ) 6 4 4 ( . 9 7 9 ) 5 0 ( . 1 . 3 ) 4 . 0 ( . 7 8 1 ) 3 1 ( . 3 3 . ) 7 8 0 2 ( 2 0 1 1 . ) 3 6 7 ( 8 . 8 5 ) 8 . 8 1 ( 5 . 4 1 . ) 9 4 7 ( 9 . 3 6 2 ) 8 . 1 ( ) 5 0 ( . . 3 2 7 . 0 ) 3 . 1 5 ( . 9 1 0 1 ) 5 . 0 ( . 9 3 . ) 5 0 ( 2 . 8 1 ) 4 7 4 0 3 ( 5 6 8 8 ) 9 . 0 4 2 ( 4 . 6 9 ) 2 . 1 8 ( 2 . 2 3 ) 3 . 1 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 . 0 7 ( 1 . 1 0 1 ) 7 . 1 ( ) 7 . 0 ( 9 . 1 7 . 0 ) 0 . 8 5 ( 5 . 1 6 ) 4 . 0 ( 3 . 4 ) 3 . 0 ( 6 . 8 1 ) m k ( t i m i l l a d i t e h t o t e c n a t s d i ) 2 m k ( a e r a i e g a n a r d m a e r t s p u r e i r r a b f o s s a c l y t i l i b a s s a p ) m k ( e c r u o s o t e c n a t s d i ) c ° ( y r a u n a j ) c ° ( l y u j n i n i e r u t a r e p m e t e r u t a r e p m e t ) m ( e d u t i t l a ) m ( ) & ( h t d w i e p o s l ) m ( h t p e d . s t n e m h c t a c - b u s t n e r e f f i d n i l s e b a i r a v l a t n e m n o r i v n e f o s e u a v l ) d s ± ( n a e m . 1 l e b a t improvement of longitudinal connectivity for eel statistical methods to techniques originating from artiﬁcial intelligence, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (anns) (see lek & gue´gan 1999 for more details). in this study, we used one of the techniques of anns, the back propagation algorithm (see rumelhart et al. 1986; gevrey et al. 2003 for more details). four models were developed: one for the probabil- ity that eel of any size-class would be present and three for the probability that each size-class (<300, 300–450 and >450 mm) would be present. we could have used a single neural network with three dependent variables (one for each of the three size-classes), but we preferred to use three networks with the same architecture, each predicting the probability that one eel size-class would be present, so as to make it easier to extract the inﬂuence of the independent variables, i.e., the environmental conditions (laffaille et al. 2003, 2004). the modelling was carried out in four steps. first, model training was performed using the whole data matrix for all three independent variables (distance from the tidal limit, habitat accessibility and habitat suitability). this was done to estimate the ability of the ann to learn data, especially to calibrate the parameters of the models. second, the models were tested using a ‘leave-one- out’ cross-validation (efron 1983), in which each sample was left out of the model formulation in turn, and predicted once. the procedure was repeated for all data to determining the capacity of the model to generalise. this procedure is appropriate when the data set is quite small and ⁄ or when each sample is likely to provide ‘unique information’ that is relevant to the regression model (rumelhart et al. 1986), as is fre- quently the case in ecology. this step allows the prediction capabilities of the network to be assessed. the correlation coefﬁcient between the observed and predicted eel density was used to quantify the ability of the model to produce the right answer through the training procedure (recognition performance), and through the testing procedure (prediction performance). third, to determine the relative importance of each parameter, we used a procedure for partitioning the connection weights of the ann model. partial deriv- atives (pad) of the network response with respect to each descriptor were used to determine the sensitivity of the environmental variables (dimopoulos et al. 1999). the pad method was found to be the most useful of the methods used to determine the relative contribution of the input factors, as it gave the most complete results (gevrey et al. 2003). fourth, we predicted the probability that eel of any size-class would be present, and then that for each size-class for the management strategies implemented. so, we changed the migration barrier passability to class 0 for all sites <100 km, <200 km, etc. (i.e., a 613 laffaille et al. table 2. mean (±sd) values of the observed probability of the occurrence of eels according to size-classes and sub-catchments. downstream loire maine middle reaches of the loire vienne-creuse indre-cher allier upstream loire kw total catchment <300 mm 300–450 mm > 450 mm all size-classes 0.49 (0.41)a 0.04 (0.07) b 0.39 (0.37) a 0.05 (0.14) b 0.13 (0.23) ab 0.04 (0.12) b 0.04 (0.14) b *** 0.13 (0.26) 0.65 (0.39) a 0.27 (0.30) b 0.74 (0.37) a 0.1 2 (0.27) bc 0.32 (0.33) b 0.07 (0.12) c 0.1 6 (0.34) bc *** 0.29 (0.37) 0.64 (0.35) a 0.55 (0.35) a 0.77 (0.34) a 0.24 (0.34) b 0.30 (0.32) b 0. 16 (0.20) b 0.25 (0.41) b *** 0.41 (0.40) 0.79 (0.35) a 0.58 (0.37) ab 0.84 (0.32) a 0.26 (0.37) b 0.53 (0.45) ab 0.24 (0.28) b 0.28 (0.45) b *** 0.47 (0.43) n 13 24 11 26 15 13 21 123 in each size-class, when kruskall–wallis (kw) values are signiﬁcant (a: 0.05;

intermediate- sized eels a po close to 0.50, and the smallest eels a po of 0.35. sub-catchment strategy the improvement of colonisation was very effective in the maine sub-catchments (table 6), where all size-classes were involved. these two sub-catchments were especially important for and vienne-creuse table 5. mean (±sd) values of predicted proba- bility of eel occurrence according to size-class and migration barrier passability class strategy. <300 mm 300–450 mm > 450 mm all size-classes passable class = 1 passable class = 2 passable class = 3 passable class = 4 passable class = 5 0.20 (0.31) a 0.23 (0.29) b 0.26 (0.29) b 0.31 (0.29) c 0.34 (0.27) c 0.34 (0.35) a 0.38 (0.31) b 0.39 (0.32) b 0.43 (0.30) b 0.51 (0.21) c 0.55 (0.43) a 0.66 (0.42) b 0.67 (0.42) b 0.73 (0.41) b 0.93 (0.10) c 0.59 (0.45) a 0.70 (0.43) b 0.70 (0.44) b 0.77 (0.42) b 0.99 (0.05) c n 30 27 7 17 28 in each size-class, when kruskall–wallis test are signiﬁcant (a: 0.05;

see for example briand et al. 2005), the distance from the limit tidal and habitat accessibility are important parameters. young eels display preferences for habitat suitability across the meso-and micro-habitat scales, particularly in terms of water depth, substrate and density of vegetation (laffaille et al. 2003, 2004; domingos et al. 2006). the diversity of habitats increases downstream (gor- man & karr 1978; rahel & hubert 1991), and this allows species and ecophases with different strategies to coexist, thus maintaining maximum species richness (lasne et al. 2007). the young eels are then easily able to ﬁnd suitable micro-habitats with the preferred characteristics where they can hide during daylight in downstream areas, where they may stay with the older eels, and disperse to different areas for active feeding during the night. in the loire, the 300–450 mm class size is relatively abundant in downstream and intermediate areas (mean probability of occurrence ‡0.30), and seems to be inﬂuenced similarly by distance from the tidal limit, accessibility, and suitability of habitats. the habitat characteristics, and especially water depth, seem to have the greatest inﬂuence on the distribution of eels >450 mm. indeed, although eels are quite ubiquitous in terms of the characteristics of meso-and micro- habitat, there appears to be a change in preferences as they increase in size: switching from shallower sites with more aquatic vegetation to deeper sites with a minimum of vegetation cover (laffaille et al. 2003, 2004; domingos et al. 2006). habitat accessibility and 616 strategies of management predictive models are of great interest as a manage- ment tool for habitats and associated species, espe- cially if they are combined with methods to prioritize management actions intended to optimise the human, ﬁnancial and techniques available (i.e., bergerot et al. 2008). a major objective of european eel conservation is to maximise the area that can be exploited by this species for its continental growth. our models conﬁrm that three main factors (distance from the tidal limit, habitat accessibility and habitat suitability) may explain the distribution of the different size-classes of eels. of course, the analysis of presence–absence data cannot directly provide the information about density and biomass that is needed to assess whether a catchment is actually achieving the goal of 40% of spawner escapement from each catchment, as required by the commission of the european communities (2005). however, it can directly provide information about river recruitment, stock trends and about the efﬁciency of management actions (e.g., connectivity recovery, ﬁshery regulation and habitat restoration) that will in turn determine spawner production. small eels (<300 mm) are less common in the middle reaches of the loire (<50% of habitats sampled are colonised), even though these areas are totally accessible from the sea. the main tributaries are particularly heavily impacted, and the effect of obstacles to the colonisation seems to be considerable in two sub-catchments located relatively downstream (maine and vienne-creuse). however, according to the assumptions of the eel dispersion models of smogor et al. (1995) for the american eel, and of ibbotson et al. (2002) and feunteun et al. (2003) for the european eel, eels that cannot colonise these downstream sub-catchments must be located on the main axis, i.e., in the middle reaches of the loire. thus, it appears that river recruitment is too low to permit any major colonisation of the entire loire catchment. this supports the hypothesis that river recruitment is currently insufﬁcient. the ﬁrst step in a management strategy intended to increase the colonisa- tionofthe loirewouldbe toachieve asigniﬁcantincrease in the river recruitment. river recruitment corresponds to the estuary recruitment minus the portion of incomers settling in estuaries, and minus the natural and anthro- pogenic mortalities of glass eels (caused, for instance, by glass eel ﬁsheries). by comparing the actual distances and areas that could be colonised by eels <300 mm in the absence of any barrier, we can see that river recruitment needs to be increased by a factor of 2 to 3. the estuary recruitment (by glass eels from the sea) cannot now be modiﬁed, but anthropogenic mortality in estuaries could be reduced (by restricting ﬁsheries for example). in a second step, or if this global strategy cannot be applied, two spatial management strategies for migra- tion barriers could be implemented, to produce very results on eel continental similar and signiﬁcant colonisation. all barriers from the tidal limit with passability class £2 (medium passability) and ⁄ or migration barriers of the sub-catchment closest to the sea, and those that are least accessible (maine and vienne-creuse in particular) must be managed. in both cases, the area signiﬁcantly exploited by eels and the probability that this species will be present will be doubled. however, this outcome is dependable only if all anthropogenic continental mortalities that affect recruitment and colonisation (ﬁshing pressure and the construction of migration barriers in particular) do not increase. other management strategies (downstream– upstream strategy, migration barrier passability class strategy using only passability class 1 or management in other sub-catchments, especially upstream sub- catchments, etc.) are currently much less effective in increasing signiﬁcantly the continental colonisation of eel the maine and creuse sub-catchment and migration barrier passability class £2 strategies. there are four ways of increasing the passage of upstream-migrating eel past barriers: (i) eels could be caught downstream of the migration barrier and then restocked upstream, (ii) speciﬁc eel- passes could be installed, (iii) the structure and ⁄ or management of the operation could be designed to maximise eel passage, and ﬁnally (iv) migration barriers could be removed (see laffaille et al. 2007; kocovsky et al. 2009). than management of river recruitment is currently insufﬁcient the ﬁrst year of life in continental rivers usually differs from that of larger eels. thus, panﬁli & ximenes (1994), using observations from 29 sites in europe, observed an average growth of 9.4 cm the ﬁrst year, and then a quasi-linear mean growth rate of )1. similar results were obtained by around 5 cmæyear meunier (1994) who, after observing marked elvers improvement of longitudinal connectivity for eel )1 an eel thereafter. thus, for 68 months in the rhine in alsace (france) reported a mean growth of 10 cm in the ﬁrst year and 5.5 cmæyear reaches 300 mm after about 5 years of continental life (rigaud et al. 2008). estimations of the speed of upstream progression in continental rivers of young eels that colonise catchments range in most cases between 10 )1 (moriarty 1986; aprahamian 1988; and 45 kmæyear mann & blackburn 1991; baras et al. 1998). briand et al. (2005) observed a slightly higher annual progression (50 km) for migrants which ascended the estuarine migration barriers of the vilaine (france). for younger eels, baras et al. (1998) estimated that the )1 as a speed of progression could reach 75 kmæyear result of migrating both during the day and night. there is marked inter-individual variability in the speed of progression. feunteun et al. (2003) noted that some eels move very fast (covering about )1), whereas others move much more 200 kmæyear )1), even in the absence of any slowly (50 kmæyear major obstacle to migration. if we consider the mean age of eels <300 mm in continental water, and their speed of progression, we estimate that eel <300 mm could colonise about 250–300 km. this distance seems likely if all barriers are made passable in our models. in fact, young eels could colonise much of the loire, and the distance where the probability of occurrence reaches 0.5 (see lasne et al. 2008) would be located about 270 km from the tidal limit, whereas it currently stands at about 100 km. this supports the hypothesis that river recruitment is currently insufﬁcient. acknowledgements we are grateful to the national french
