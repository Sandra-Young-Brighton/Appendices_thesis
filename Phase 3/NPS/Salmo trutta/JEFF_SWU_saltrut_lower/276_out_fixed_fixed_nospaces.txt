soupir et al. 2000). when introduced to aquatic ecosystems to which it is not native, northern pike often impact the native ﬁsh fauna. the adverse impact of northern pike on native ﬁshes has been documented in the yampa, white and colorado rivers in colorado (bergersen 2001) and at lake davis, california (lee 2001). in alaska, native populations exist north of the alaska range (morrow 1980), but pike have been illegally introduced, presumably by local ﬁshermen, into southcentral alaska, including drainages in the matanuska–susitna valley, the anchorage bowl and the kenai peninsula. exactly when they were ﬁrst introduced to these areas is unknown, but it is generally accepted that they ﬁrst invaded the susitna drainage between the 1950s [alaska department of fish and game (adf&g), unpublished data] and the 1970s (morrow 1980). invasive pike have since heavily impacted native populations of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), coho (silver) salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch) and other salmonids in southcentral alaska (adf&g, unpublished data). the adf&g has taken counter- active measures against invasive pike populations to protect and restore game ﬁsh, including an unlimited pike catch and educating the public about the prob- lem (http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/region2/pdfpubs/ northernpike.pdf). the effects of invasive pike on nongame ﬁshes have been overlooked because they have neither economic nor recreational value. in this study, we analyse the effects of pike on a nongame ﬁsh, the threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus). the threespine stickleback is a species complex with a circumpolar distribution. stickleback are small and often the most abundant ﬁsh in boreal lakes and streams. as such, they are important prey for a host of invertebrate and vertebrate predators and hence occupy a critical niche in aquatic communities (reimchen 1994). 482 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00186.x t h g u a c k c a b e k c i t s l i e n p s e e r h t f o r e b m u n  0 0 1 / d e k c o t s s d n o m a s l l i i a u d v d n i i f o r e b m u n fig. 1. number of individual salmonids stocked and threespine stickleback caught (left axis) and trapping effort (right axis) at prator lake, alaska from 1983 to 2005. the number of stickleback caught (d) is the total for that year. trapping effort (n) is total trap-hours for that year. number of individual salmonids stocked (r) is actual number stocked divided by 100 (to ﬁt to scale). the arrow shows the year in which pike were ﬁrst observed. the threespine stickleback is an important model species in evolutionary biology because it exhibits exceptional phenotypic diversity, with marine, anadro- mous and numerous freshwater forms that are often reproductively isolated (wootton 1976; bell & foster 1994; gibson 2005). although the phenotype of marine and anadromous forms is relatively uniform across their range, freshwater forms display a high degree of variability (bell & foster 1994). this variability is a result of postglacial radiation of isolated resident freshwater populations founded by marine or anadromous forms (mcphail & lindsey 1970; bell 1976; bell & foster 1994). reduction or loss of pelvic structures among freshwater populations is a well-documented example of such variation (e.g., bell et al. 1993; bell & ortı´ 1994; reviewed by bell 1987, 1988). in southcentral alaska, reduction of the pelvic complex is associated with low ionic strength water and the absence of predatory ﬁshes (bell et al. 1993). the variation in freshwater phenotypes is so great that even lakes a few metres apart can have markedly different phenotypes as a result of contrast- ing ecological conditions (bell & ortı´ 1994). the stickleback radiation in southcentral alaska is one of the most remarkable stickleback radiations in the world and is becoming increasingly important for investigations in morphological and life history evolution, developmental and population genetics, behavioural ecology, parasitology and environmental toxicology. as an important radiation in a model system, to conserve. although the entire species complex cannot be conserved, important populations, due to their evolu- tionary or genetic uniqueness, should be given special these populations are critical extinction of a weakly armoured stickleback 500 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0   2 8 9 1  1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0   6 0 0 2    4 0 0 2    4 8 9 1    6 8 9 1    8 8 9 1    0 9 9 1    2 9 9 1    4 9 9 1    6 9 9 1    8 9 9 1    0 0 0 2    2 0 0 2  t r o f f i  e g n p p a r t year conservation attention (foster et al. 2003). to garner the political will and resources necessary for effective conservation of unique populations, there must be evidence that these populations are vulnerable to external factors, such as invasive species. the aim of this paper is to document the effect of one such invasive, the northern pike, on a rare, weakly armoured stickleback population in a lake in south- central alaska. habitat prator lake is located in the matanuska–susitna valley (61°37¢05¢¢n, 149°43¢50¢¢w), where it occupies a saddle point between the little susitna river and little meadow creek drainages. the lake has an average depth of 3.6 m and a maximum depth of 7.0 m; the littoral zone area comprises 81.7% of the lake. the shore is 2.4 km in length and the surface area of the lake is 0.4 km2. the lake is surrounded by muskeg, which transitions to a mixed birch–spruce forest. it has no inlet or outlet streams, and the threespine stickleback is the only native ﬁsh species (adf&g, unpublished data; bell et al. 1985). the ﬁrst known record of stickleback was made by the adf&g in 1960 (adf&g, unpublished data). beginning in 1971, the adf&g stocked prator lake periodically with salmonid game ﬁsh [sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka), rainbow trout, coho salmon, king salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) and arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus); fig. 1]. bell et al. (1985) found that stickleback collected in 1983 from prator lake had incomplete expression of the pelvic com- plex, including absence of paired pelvic spines and 483 patankar et al. most of the pelvic girdle. samples collected in 1990 showed that pelvic reduction still persisted in this lake (bell & ortı´ 1994) and ninespine stickleback (pungi- tius pungitius) also occurred (m.a. bell, unpublished data). consistent with other pelvic-reduced popula- tions, the prator stickleback lives in a lake without native piscivorous ﬁshes and with low ionic strength water; in both 1990 and 2005 we measured the conductivity at 10 ls ⁄ cm. northern pike were ﬁrst observed in prator lake in 1996 and have been seen annually since (j.a. baker, personal communication). pike were most likely introduced either by local residents who live around the lake or by other ﬁshermen. prator lake was observed repeatedly in the course of other studies of threespine stickleback, and intensive observations were made after 2001 when it became apparent that the stickleback population had declined. we predicted that weakly armoured stickleback faced with predation by exotic pike would either adapt by evolving more robust body armour or go locally extinct. this paper documents the apparent extinction of the prator lake stickleback population following the introduction of northern pike. methods unbaited 1/4 and 1/8 in. mesh minnow traps were used to sample stickleback. traps were set from the shore in vegetated and nonvegetated areas at an average depth of 0.6 m. traps were set in the lake for 5.5–46.5 h. stickleback sampling data and trapping effort from 1993 to 20 may 2001 and 22 may 2003 were provided by j.a. baker and from 19 july 2002 by w.a. cresko. the lake was sampled a total of 19 times from 1983 to 2005, between may and september. two additional methods were used to sample prator lake for threespine stickleback and northern pike. first, two surveys were conducted around the lake from a canoe in july 2002. each survey lasted for 3 h and consisted of visual searches for stickleback and pike throughout the lake. this was followed by two scuba diving sessions conducted on 2 july and 13 august 2003. each dive session consisted of four dives lasting 15–20 min each. observations were made by spiralling outward in concentric circles about 1 m apart from an anchor line on the lake bottom. a dive was considered complete at 30 m from the starting point. dives were conducted at random points near the centre of the lake and were followed by snorkelling among nearshore vegetation for 20– 30 min. during scuba diving and snorkelling sessions, an effort was made to cover as much of the lake area and water column as possible, including nearshore vegetation and open-lake ﬂoor. 484 results the greatest number of stickleback caught, after the 1983 effort, was in 1996 (300 individuals). the trapping effort in this year was 234 trap-hours (12 traps · 19.5 h). northern pike were ﬁrst observed the same year (j.a. baker, personal communication; fig. 1). the highest stickleback catch after 1996 was in 1997 (200 stickleback), followed by seven on 31 may 1999, 40 on 14 june 1999, 36 on 26 may 2000 and eight on 20 may 2001. after the poor trapping success in 2001, we realised that the introduced pike might be impacting the stickleback population, and so we increased our effort to document the presence of stickleback. however, no stickleback were caught on any of the last eight attempts ranging from september 2001 until may 2005, when the mean trapping effort was 391 trap-hours per year. northern pike were observed in rooted vegetation on the periphery of the lake every time the lake was sampled for stickleback and pike via canoe surveys in 2002 and scuba and snorkelling sessions in 2003. however, no stickleback were observed on these occasions. discussion after the 1996 appearance of northern pike in prator lake, threespine stickleback numbers fell dramatically to a probable extinction in 2002. natural re-colonisation of prator lake may not happen until long in the future, given that the lake has no inlet or outlet. unless artiﬁcially transplanted, re-colonisation by stickleback is unlikely to introduce the same extreme weakly armoured form that existed there because weakly armoured populations are relatively rare (bell & ortı´ 1994) and probably vulnerable to pike predation. native stickleback and northern pike coexist elsewhere in alaska (gilbertson 1980), so it is likely that only the weakly armoured forms of stickleback will be lost due to the pike invasion. hoogland et al. (1957) demon- strated that although small pike (10–25 cm in length) have difﬁculty consuming stickleback with pelvic spines, they do not have difﬁculty consuming stickle- back that are de-spined. given that pike are sit-and-wait predators that strike from cover, weakly armoured stickleback populations should be more likely to persist in lakes with relatively little cover than in lakes such as prator that are shallow with abundant rooted vegetation. adf&g has stocked prator lake with salmonid ﬁngerlings since 1971. this raises the possibility that the prator lake stickleback declined in response to predation by stocked salmonids. foster et al. (2003) pointed out that weakly armoured stickleback in land- locked lakes are vulnerable to stocked piscivorous ﬁshes. they cited unpublished data indicating that stickleback populations in alaskan lakes devoid of predatory ﬁshes did not change morphologically over time, whereas stickleback populations in lakes with stocked salmonids evolved increased pelvic expres- sion and in one lake went extinct (foster et al. 2003). although stocked salmonids may have contributed to the prator stickleback decline, the stockings started long before the precipitous population decline that began in 1996 (fig. 1). however, the stickleback decline was coincident with the appearance of nor- thern pike. in principle, the introduction of an entire assemblage of exotic species (northern pike and stocked salmonids) is worse than the introduction of a single exotic species. perhaps the rapid decline in response to pike was accelerated by simultaneous predation from stocked salmonids, and perhaps stocked salmonids were responsible for an apparent decline that occurred in 1993–1994 just before the introduction of pike (fig. 1). the poor trapping success for stickleback in 1993–1994 followed the 1992 stocking of the lake with approximately 50,000 salmonids, compared with the usual 20,000 or less. with the arrival of pike in 1996, however, stickle- back appear to have been affected almost instantly, showing no signs of resistance or re-establishment. in fact, it is likely that pike have caused a decline in the stocked salmonid populations as well because salmo- nids were neither obtained in traps nor observed during surveys in 2002–2005. the only ﬁsh species observed during this time was pike. however, a small number of stocked arctic char and king salmon were reportedly caught by anglers in 2002 and 2003 (adf&g, unpublished data). weakly armoured stickleback in an adjacent land-locked lake without pike, bear paw, this time period despite were trapped throughout periodic stocking of the lake with rainbow trout (patankar 2004). stickleback in bear paw evolved an increase in dorsal spine length and number of lateral plates from 1990 to 2002, possibly in response to predation by stocked salmonids (patankar 2004). impacts on unusual threespine stickleback popula- tions from direct and indirect anthropogenic actions have been documented before, particularly due to the introduction of exotic piscivorous ﬁshes (foster et al. 2003). for example, introduction of brown bullheads (ameiurus nebulosus) in the early 1990s in hadley lake, british columbia, led to the extinction of a unique threespine stickleback species pair (hatﬁeld 2001). three other species pairs in british columbian lakes have been identiﬁed as highly endangered (wood 2003), and the bullhead has been implicated as a major threat in these cases as well. kynard (1979) attributed the drastic decline of the stickleback pop- ulation in wapato lake, washington, to the introduc- tion of the pumpkinseed sunﬁsh (lepomis gibbosus). the impacts of exotic predatory ﬁshes are likely to grow as ﬁshes continue to be introduced, intentionally extinction of a weakly armoured stickleback or unintentionally, around the world. the challenge in research programmes on exotic ﬁshes is distinguishing impacts due to other factors, such as habitat loss and degradation, versus impacts due to exotic species, and differentiating between effects due to competition versus predation by the aliens (reviewed by gurevitch & padilla 2004). in the case of prator lake stickle- back, the only marked change in the lake’s ecology at the time of extinction was the introduction of pike, and predation is clearly more likely than competition to have been the cause. furthermore, stickleback have persisted in nearby lakes to which pike have not been introduced (r. patankar, unpublished data; m.a. bell and f.a. von hippel, unpublished data). the threespine stickleback radiation of southcen- tral alaska provides an important study system for many ﬁelds of biology because of the tremendous natural variation among populations, including the weakly armoured forms. the loss of these forms is tragic both because it is a loss of biodiversity and because the value of this system to science depends on the existence of diverse populations, including replicate populations that have independently evolved similar phenotypes. the entire threespine stickleback genome has been sequenced to further increase the threespine stickleback’s utility as a model system. of all the many thousands of populations around the world, it was the population resident in bear paw lake, adjacent from which the individual ﬁsh was selected for sequencing. this sequencing will signiﬁcantly increase the interest of scientists in the bear paw population, as well as in other armour-reduced populations in the southcentral alaska radiation. it will be particularly unfortunate if pike are introduced into bear paw lake, thereby eliminating the population used for genome sequen- cing. the importance of this system, as well as the threats faced by many unique populations, speaks to the need for conservation programmes. as demon- strated by the prator lake stickleback, weakly armoured populations that have not previously been sympatric with predatory ﬁshes may not have sufﬁcient time to adapt to the introduction of exotic predators, particularly to an aggressive predator such as the northern pike. to prator lake, the most highly divergent threespine stickleback populations for armour reduction in southcentral alaska are restricted to seepage lakes (see jones et al. 2003) that lack inlet and outlet streams (bell et al. 1993). thus anadromous salmonids cannot establish self-sustaining populations in these lakes even when they are planted in large numbers. however, northern pike can become established in such lakes. their ability to breed and thrive in lakes inhabited by weakly armoured stickleback and their feeding voracity make northern pike a particular threat to 485 patankar et al. stickleback conservation. however, the absence of surface connections of seepage lakes to adjacent drainages makes it feasible to prevent introduction of northern pike to such lakes, as well as to extirpate them from such lakes that they have already invaded. by mapping the expanding distribution of pike and the location of weakly armoured stickleback popula- tions, efforts can be directed at preventing pike invasions in lakes where stickleback are most vulner- able and at extirpating pike in lakes where they already occur. intensive gill netting using a mesh size larger than stickleback might be an effective approach in isolated lakes (knapp & matthews 1998), provided that educational efforts are successful in preventing future introductions. this paper has identiﬁed a major problem faced by vulnerable threespine stickleback populations with extremely reduced armour. additionally, this study demonstrates that invasion of an aggressive piscivore into an isolated lake can simplify the lake to an ichthyological monoculture, comprised solely of the invasive ﬁsh. clearly, in otherwise ﬁshless lakes, ﬁsh populations with strong local adaptations that render them vulnerable to predation are of particular conservation concern. further research on the effects of exotic ﬁshes on stickleback is needed. the time has come for sport ﬁsheries managers and conservation programmes to recognise the value of unique popula- tions and radiations of stickleback (see also foster et al. 2003). the adf&g’s new comprehensive wildlife conservation strategy emphasising alaska’s nongame species includes conservation planning for the threespine and ninespine stickleback radiations in southcentral alaska (adf&g 2005). we hope that these planning efforts grow into effective conservation programmes. acknowledgements we thank anjali karve, richard
