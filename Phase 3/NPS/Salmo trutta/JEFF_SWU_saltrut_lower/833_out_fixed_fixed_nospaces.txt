lydeard & mayden 1995; johnston 1999). a large portion of this decline in biodiversity occurred in lotic ecosystems because of habitat degradation and alteration, often the result of impoundment (richter et al. 1997). impound- ment of streams and rivers results in many physical changes and often results in long-term modiﬁcations to riverine habitats, particularly downstream of the impoundment (baxter 1977; petts 1984; detenbeck et al. 1992; ligon et al. 1995). stream fauna has been shown to be altered because of impoundments, inclu- ding shifts in species composition and abundances (martinez et al. 1994; bonner & wilde 2000; lienesch et al. 2000). even with the increasing threats to lotic ecosystems, many ecological patterns of streams and stream communities are not known. the recovery of stream communities from anthrop- ogenic disturbance is not well understood (gore et al. 1990). many studies have addressed temporal recov- ery for stream communities but only a few have addressed spatial recovery (gore et al. 1990; niemi et al. 1990; detenbeck et al. 1992). stream commu- nities tend to exhibit a longitudinal gradient of increasing species richness and diversity from up- stream to downstream (sheldon 1968; vannote et al. 1980). however, anthropogenic disturbances, such as impoundments, have been predicted to reset this gradient and would appear to exhibit a gradient of recovery that increases with distance from the distur- bance (vannote et al. 1980; ward & stanford 1983, 1987). such longitudinal recovery gradients have been shown for aquatic insects and freshwater mussels, with diversity increasing downstream from impoundments (voelz & ward 1991; vaughn & taylor 1999). longitudinal recovery gradients have also been shown to exist for ﬁsh assemblages downstream from impoundments (kinsolving & bain 1993; travnichek & maceina 1994; travnichek et al. 1995), but these studies were focused on recovery of ﬁsh assemblages downstream from hydroelectric impoundments. relea- ses from hydroelectric impoundments are highly erratic and variable in nature while releases from 145 phillips & johnston nonhydroelectric impoundments are typically of a consistent magnitude although sudden releases of an irregular magnitude can occur (baxter 1977; petts 1984; cushman 1985; ashby et al. 1999). releases from hydroelectric impoundments should result in stream communities that are less stable downstream because of the erratic streamﬂow than in stream communities nonhydroelectric impoundments (ligon et al. 1995; poff et al. 1997). although these types of in releases and affects the downstream community, it is likely that a longitudinal recovery gradient exists downstream of nonhydroelectric impoundments. impoundments differ downstream of the objective of this study was to determine if a recovery for ﬁsh assemblages exists gradient of downstream from nonhydroelectric impoundments. this was accomplished by sampling sites of historical record and by using recent and historical ﬁsh assem- blages for comparison to determine if such a longi- tudinal recovery gradient was present. this study focused primarily on a comparison of pre-impound- ment collections to post-impoundment collections to determine persistence and recovery of ﬁsh assem- blages downstream of impoundments. temporal chan- ges in assemblage structure over a 30-year period were assessed. study site the bear creek system is a tributary of the tennessee river drainage, located in north-west alabama and northeast mississippi, with over 75% of the watershed located in alabama (fig. 1). the drainage basin for the watershed is 2450 km2, with bear creek proper being approximately 217 km in length (taylor & hall 1974). stream width of sample sites varied between 9 and 12 m and the stream was third to fourth order at sample sites. the watershed is located primarily in the east gulf coastal plain physiographic region (fenn- eman 1938). the system crosses the fall line, a geomorphological feature that often affects species distribution (swift et al. 1986; mettee et al. 1996). the ﬁsh fauna of bear creek is highly diverse, with 106 species present. one unique feature of the ichthyofauna is the presence of several tombigbee river species, which are found nowhere else in the tennessee river system, and which are thought to represent evidence of stream capture between the bear creek system and the tennessee river (smith-vaniz 1968; wall 1968; starnes & etnier 1986; mettee et al. 1996). between 1969 and 1979, four ﬂood control impoundments and a ﬂoodway channel were construc- ted on the system (fig. 1; taylor & hall 1974; etnier & starnes 1993). the ﬁrst and the only comprehensive ﬁsh fauna survey of the system was conducted by wall (1968), prior to the construction of the impoundments. 146 materials and methods a total of 17 collections was made downstream of impoundments as a part of a larger survey of the bear creek system that took place between december 1998 and june 2000 (phillips and johnston in press). all the sites in this study were sampled by wall (1968), except for two sites (1 and 3; fig. 1). sampling methods used in the historic survey (wall 1968) were followed as closely as possible (all available micro- habitat at each site were sampled for a duration of 30–45 min using seines of 3.1-m length). we sampled as much area as possible at each site. typically, no new species were collected after approximately 25 min of sampling. all recent collections were anaesthetised using either clove oil or ms-222, preserved in 10% formalin, and later deposited in the auburn university museum fish collection. all statistical analyses were performed using microsoft excel 98. this survey was part of a larger survey on the bear creek system that revisited sites historically sampled by wall (1968), in a comprehensive ﬁsh fauna survey of the system. only the sites downstream of an impoundment were included for this study. most sites were sampled only once during the historic survey but two sites (13 and 14; fig. 1) were visited more than once. in an attempt to duplicate the historic survey, we sampled these sites more than once. for sites where more than one sample was taken, samples of similar season were used for comparison and treated as an independent collection. for sites where no sample was made during the historic survey (1 and 3), no comparison for similarity could be made. in some instances, when a species was rare, wall (1968) listed it as ‘present’. for the purposes of analysis in this study, such cases were given a value of ‘1’ for abundance. similarity indices were used to compare the resemblance of the ﬁsh assemblages of recent collec- tions with the ﬁsh assemblages of the historic collection. similarity indices typically range from 0, indicating no species in common, to 1, indicating all species in common. krebs (1999) not only suggests scaling the results or transforming the scale when using similarity but also stresses that previous studies of interpretations of similarity for communities can be used to assess relative similarity. we followed matthews et al. (1988) in considering £0.4 as indi- cating low similarity between assemblages and ‡0.7 as indicating highly similar assemblages, with values in between considered moderately similar. other studies of ﬁsh assemblages have used the same range (lienesch et al. 2000; walser et al. 2000) or a comparable range for interpretation of relative simi- larity (meador & matthews 1992; travnichek et al. stream ﬁsh recovery fig. 1. map and locality of the bear creek system with localities of collection sites. numbers 13 and 14 represent collections on two separate dates, with number 13 repre- senting collections 13a and 13b and num- ber 14 representing collections 14a and 14b. sites 1 and 3 were not sampled during the historic survey. 1995; lohr & fausch 1997). jaccard’s index, a presence–absence similarity measure, and morisita similarity, an abundance-based similarity measure, were used to measure similarity. we used two measures of similarity because the morisita index is considered by some to be the best overall measure of similarity (ludwig & reynolds 1988; krebs 1999) and because patton et al. (1998) suggested also using presence–absence measures when using historical surveys to assess changes in ﬁsh communities as population ﬂuctuations could add difﬁculty to inter- pretations of abundance data. similarity indices were calculated by using the ecological methodology software (kenney & krebs 2000). longitudinal gradients were tested using linear regression where species richness and similarity between recent and historic communities were mea- sures of recovery, and distance downstream from the closest impoundment was the independent variable. the distance for each collection was measured in river kilometre downstream from the closest impoundment for collection localities, which were treated indepen- dently regardless of location in the watershed. distances were determined by using a cartometer to measure the distances of collection localities from impoundments on the alabama atlas and gazetteer, which has a scale of 1 inch ¼ 4.6 km (delorme 1998). seventeen sites of recent collection were used to measure recovery using species richness and 15 collections were used to measure recovery using historical richness because two sites (1 and 3) were not sampled in the historical survey. the distances used for the recent survey data were superimposed for the historic collections. fifteen collections were used to measure recovery with similarity, which represents similarity of the recent assemblages to the assemblages prior to modiﬁcation. results the range for species richness for the historic survey was 2–18, with an average of 11.1 per collection. the range for species richness for the recent survey was 3–15, with an average of 10.5 per collection. most 147 phillips & johnston table 1. distance from impoundment for each collection used for tests of spatial recovery along with metrics used to test recovery, including species richness, jaccard’s similarity index and the morisita index. species richness site no. distance historic recent jaccard’s index morisita index 1* 2 3* 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13a 13b 14a 14b 15 62.1 55.2 50.6 48.3 39.1 18.4 9.2 4.6 39.1 39.1 29.9 23.0 19.0 19.0 5.2 5.2 1.2 – 11 – 12 11 12 2 12 14 16 18 5 12 13 9 14 5 14 15 11 12 12 11 14 13 14 7 8 13 10 9 7 3 5 – 0.37 – 0.20 0.21 0.35 0.07 0.25 0.40 0.28 0.24 0.20 0.22 0.22 0.07 0.19 0.11 *no historic data available from this site. – 0.37 – 0.47 0.43 0.58 0.18 0.13 0.63 0.20 0.20 0.35 0.11 0.26 0.00 0.13 0.26 collecting sites tended to show little congruence in biological composition between historical and current collections. the range for similarity using jaccard’s similarity index was 0.07–0.40, with 15 sites (100%) exhibiting low similarity and no sites exhibiting high similarity (table 1). the range for similarity using the morisita similarity index was 0.00–0.63, with 11 sites (73%) exhibiting low similarity, four sites (27%) exhibiting moderate similarity, and no sites exhibiting high similarity (table 1). collection records are listed by species in table 2. species richness (table 1) in the recent collections increases with distance downstream from impound- ment (r ¼ 0.52, p ¼ 0.033), while species richness of the historic collections did not vary signiﬁcantly with distance as measured from the present impoundment location (r ¼ 0.36, p ¼ 0.183) (fig. 2). similarity (table 1) between historic and recent collections increases with distance downstream from impound- ment using both jaccard’s index (r ¼ 0.61, p ¼ 0.015) and the morisita index (r ¼ 0.58, p ¼ 0.023) (fig. 3). sites closer to the impoundments appear to have changed more following impoundment than the sites farther downstream. discussion the increasing similarity of recent communities to historic communities, along with the increasing spe- cies richness as distance increases downstream from impoundment suggests a pattern of recovery from the disturbance of impoundments in the bear creek system. this relationship between similarity and 148 distance, and the relationship between species richness and distance, shows that a longitudinal gradient of recovery and persistence exists for ﬁsh assemblages downstream from nonhydroelectric impoundments. one effect of impoundments is apparent with this relationship as areas closer to an impoundment are characterised by lower species richness and commu- nities that appear to be faunally dissimilar to the pre-impoundment increased downstream distance from an impoundment, species richness increases and the communities appear to increase in faunal similarity to the unmodiﬁed, pre- impoundment state. many sites retain signs of distur- bance as shown by the number of sites exhibiting low similarity, but effects of the impoundments appear to diminish with distance. communities. with an increase in species richness and a return to the initial state of the community, or at least some portion of the initial state, would be an indicator of recovery (gore et al. 1990). vannote et al. (1980) predicted that disturbance would cause the upstream to downstream longitudinal gradient of increasing species richness and diversity to reset starting from the disturbance. ward & stanford (1983) hypothesised that impound- ments would function as a disturbance by resetting the longitudinal gradient and that the downstream com- munities would reach a point similar to the natural community at some distance from the disturbance. the result would be a pattern of recovery present downstream from the disturbance and it would appear that a portion of the community would persist downstream. this study did not attempt to place a beginning point of recovery from disturbance, but instead, identiﬁed a pattern of recovery and persistence in stream ﬁsh communities. potential seasonal and sampling varia- tion and a limited amount of historical data did not allow for identiﬁcation for a beginning point or threshold of recovery. although kinsolving & bain (1993) hypothesised that spatial recovery for stream ﬁsh assemblages would likely occur between 20 and 100 km, voelz & ward (1991) showed that recovery for stream communities could occur as short as 5–10 km. the distance required for recovery seems to be variable but trends from our study suggest that it could occur over a relatively short distance (20 km or less). an endpoint for recovery would be suggested by a high faunal similarity value between the pre-impound- ment and post-impoundment communities. several studies have shown that faunal composition often changes as a result of impoundment (martinez et al. 1994; bonner & wilde 2000; lienesch et al. 2000) and similarity indices represent changes in faunal composition better than species richness, abundance and diversity. an endpoint for recovery would be stream ﬁsh recovery table 2. historic and recent collections for each species, listed by site and the number of individuals collected per site, respectively. no historic data is available from sites 1 and 3. historic recent ichthyomyzon bdellium lampetra appendix campostoma oligolepis 8-1 8-28 5-3, 6-34, 8-2, 9-18, 10-6, 11-2, 13b-1, 14b-49, 15-5 – – 1-19, 2-2, 3-6, 4-3, 5-5, 6-16, 7-2, 8-10, 9-2, 11-8, 12-5, 13a-2, 13b-26, 14b-12, 15-1 clinostomus funduloides cyprinella galactura cyprinella spiloptera cyprinella whipplei hybopsis amblops luxilus chrysocephalus – 8-1, 12-1, 13a-p, 14b-18 4-1, 6-38, 9-1, 10-10, 11-16, 13a-p, 13b-34, 14b-8 2-4, 4-1, 5-11, 6-1, 9-10, 10-10, 13a-19, 13b-16, 14a-2 13b-7, 14a-2 2-4, 4-26, 5-7, 6-1, 8-8, 9-4, 10-7, 11-22, 12-1, 13a-14, 8-2 6-1, 8-23, 14a-32, 14b-37, 15-1 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, 4-3, 5-6, 6-3, 10-1, 13a-50 2-6, 7-10, 9-10, 11-35, 12-22, 13b-31 – 2-7, 3-6, 4-2, 5-51, 6-3, 7-2, 8-134, 9-2, 10-1, 12-1, 13a-3, 13b-1 13b-6, 14a-3, 14b-160, 15-4 10-1, 14a-61 11-2, 12-6, 13a-16, 13b-12 6-1 – – 7-1, 9-1 – 11-35, 12-4, 13a-3, 13b-12 1-1 1-12, 2-4, 3-1 – 3-2, 4-1, 5-1, 8-4, 10-1 1-4, 2-3, 7-2, 9-2 3-2, 5-5 3-1 1-19, 2-12, 3-4, 5-14, 6-1, 7-1, 8-1, 9-1, 12-5, 13a-1, 13b-1, 14a-1 2-3 5-10, 8-3, 12-6 – 2-2 – 1-2, 6-1, 8-1 8-1 9-5, 10-6, 11-25, 13b-106, 14b-21 – 2-2 5-10, 6-1, 10-6, 11-2 10-5, 11-1, 13a-2, 13b-1, 14a-1, 14b-133, 15-5 10-1 2-4, 4-8, 9-3, 11-11 8-1 – 4-16 6-2, 9-12, 13a-18, 13b-55, 14a-1, 14b-22 4-8, 10-5, 11-2, 13b-39 6-8, 13a-4 – 6-6, 9-3, 11-1, 14a-2, 14b-9, 15-2 11-2 9-1, 11-1 10-2, 11-1 – 4-4 6-6 2-1, 5-1, 6-1, 9-2, 10-5, 11-1, 12-2, 13a-9, 13b-9, 14b-1 2-3, 4-3, 6-1, 7-3, 8-1, 9-3, 10-25, 12-5, 13a-7, 14a-1, 15-1 – – 2-1, 5-2, 6-6, 8-6, 9-5 13a-1 5-1, 10-1, 13a-2 – 2-9, 4-2, 5-2, 9-1, 11-1, 13b-4, 14b-2 – 2-1, 4-2, 9-2, 10-2 5-1 11-2, 14a-1, 14b-37, 15-8 7-1, 8-26 10-1 4-1 8-2 2-1, 7-6, 8-53 8-1, 14b-p 10-1, 11-1, 12-1, 13a-3, 13b-2, 14a-20, 14b-3 – 1-2, 4-1, 5-2, 6-1 6-1 1-16, 2-4, 7-5, 9-5 – 2-1, 4-1, 7-1, 9-1, 10-3, 15-2 1-2, 4-2 4-3, 5-1, 7-1, 9-1, 12-1, 14a-1, 14b-1 14b-1 2-2, 3-2, 5-5, 7-1, 9-1, 13a-2, 14a-1, 14b-2, 15-1 1-6, 4-1, 6-1 11-1, 12-4, 13b-2 8-3 8-12 – 14a-5 1-6, 2-1, 3-8, 4-2, 6-16, 7-3, 9-3, 11-32, 12-7, 13a-1, 13b-32 8-2 7-2, 9-2, 10-13, 11-1, 12-4, 13a-9, 8-2 – 1-2, 11-4, 12-6, 13b-2 – 1-1, 2-8, 3-7, 4-13, 5-16, 7-1, 9-1 lythrurus ardens lythrurus bellus nocomis micropogon notemigonas crysoleucas notropis atherinoides notropis baileyi notropis boops notropis rubellus notropis telescopus notropis volucellus opsopoeodus emiliae pimephales notatus pimephales vigilax semotilus atromaculatus erimyzon oblongus hypentelium nigricans moxostoma duquesnei moxostoma erythrurum ictularus punctatus noturus miurus noturus nocturnus fundulus catenatus fundulus olivaceus gambusia afﬁnis labidesthes sicculus cottus carolinae lepomis cyanellus lepomis macrochirus lepomis marginatus lepomis megalotis lepomis microlophus micropterus punctulatus micropterus salmoides etheostoma blennioides etheostoma caeruleum etheostoma duryi etheostoma histrio etheostoma jessiae etheostoma ruﬁlineatum etheostoma simoterum etheostoma stigmaeum etheostoma zonistium etheostoma sp.cf. zonistium 14a-17, 14b-41 percina caprodes percina phoxocephala percina sciera 2-2 4-10, 5-2, 6-1, 9-1, 11-1 2-2, 4-11, 5-2, 10-9, 11-1, 12-1, 13a-1, 13b-1 p indicates a rare species present in a historic collection that was not quantiﬁed. to determine, if no baseline data were difﬁcult available (kinsolving & bain 1993). when baseline data are available, diversity and species richness are not very useful because these community measures ignore species composition (karr et al. 1986;

detenbeck et al. 1992). between and pre-impoundment previous studies of spatial recovery gradients have focused mostly on species richness and diversity. vaughn & taylor (1999) used species richness and abundance to study a spatial recovery gradient for freshwater mussels, as did voelz & ward (1991), who also used similarity, but the similarity was among sites downstream from an existing impoundment, not similarity post- impoundment samples. previous studies of ﬁsh assem- blages examined spatial recovery gradients using species richness, abundance and diversity, in addition to ﬂow preferences by species (kinsolving & bain 1993; travnichek & maceina 1994; travnichek et al. 1995). although travnichek et al. (1995) used simi- larity to examine a gradient of recovery, but similarity was compared only among post-impoundment sam- ples in order to determine assemblage responses to minimum-ﬂow releases on a hydroelectric impound- ment. previous studies of ﬁsh assemblage recovery down- stream from impoundments were conducted on fairly 150 (a) 0.5 ) x e d n i s ’ d r a c c a j ( y t i r a l i m s i 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 y = 0.0035x + 0.1428 10 20 30 40 50 60 (b) 0.70 ) x e d n i a t i s i r o m ( y t i r a l i m i s 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 y = 0.0061x + 0.1426 0 10 20 30 40 50 distance (km) 60 fig. 3. relationship between similarity and distance downstream from impoundment. similarity represents similarity between recent and historic assemblages for a site. distance represents stream distance downstream from an impoundment for a collection. the relationship between similarity and distance was signiﬁcant for both jaccard’s similarity index [(a) p ¼ 0.015] and morisita similarity index [(b) p ¼ 0.023]. large rivers with hydroelectric impoundments (kin- solving & bain 1993; travnichek & maceina 1994; travnichek et al. 1995). the ﬂuctuating releases from hydroelectric impoundments cause extremely altered streamﬂow when compared with natural streamﬂow, with rapid changes in ﬂow often resulting in reduced diversity and abundance of stream organisms (cush- man 1985). considering the response of the ﬁsh assemblages to changes in streamﬂow (schlosser 1985; bain et al. 1988; higgs & petts 1988), it was possible that a spatial gradient of recovery for ﬁsh assemblages was simply a response of the ﬁsh assemblages to the highly variable releases from hydroelectric impoundments. this study showed that a recovery gradient was present downstream from other types of impoundments and suggests that a gradient of recovery exists downstream from most impoundments. the impoundments were constructed on the system over a period of approximately 10 years, which could have some effect on the measured recovery. however, the impoundments have been in place for approxi- mately 20–25 years, which should be enough time for the effects to become well established (petts 1980; schlosser 1990). in a review of recovery for ﬁsh assemblages, temporal rates for long-term modiﬁca- tions were variable, ranging from as little as 5 years to over 52 years for disturbances with direct habitat modiﬁcation, such as channelisation (detenbeck et al. 1992). detenbeck et al. (1992) suggested that with regard to long-term disturbances, stream ecosystems and communities tend to transform to an altered state in response, so that temporal recovery was not as important as to the degree of alteration. the relative permanence of impoundments as a disturbance would make temporal than the longitudinal recovery, which is a measure of the degree of alteration. recovery less important factors such as the variable temporal recovery of communities could account for some of the apparent background variation in our results. the ﬂoodway channel constructed on the system (taylor & hall 1974) probably plays a role in the variation of the most distant collections, as channelisation seems to require much longer time temporally for recovery (detenbeck et al. 1992). some of the background variation could also be explained by land-use intensity around collec- tion sites from both sampling periods (historical and recent), which has been shown to effect ﬁsh commu- nities (jones et al. 1999; walser & bart 1999; scott & helfman 2001). some collections were located between two impoundments (fig. 1) and upstream ﬁsh assemblages have been shown to be affected by impoundments (lienesch et al. 2000). although we attempted to replicate seasonality as closely as possible, some seasonal effects could explain some of in addition, some variation might be explained by natural ﬂuctuations in populations, as well as the difﬁculties in attempting to replicate historical surveys (rutherford et al. 1987; anderson et al. 1995). in addition, positions of the variation. regardless of potential background variation, a longitudinal gradient of recovery for ﬁsh assemblages appears to be present downstream from nonhydroe- lectric impoundments. this recovery gradient is a response of the ﬁsh community to disturbance. the gradient shows that the native stream ﬁsh assemblages are severely affected close to the impoundments with diminishing effects over distance downstream. as distance increases, the community increases in resem- bling the unaltered and appears to recover as signiﬁed by the increasing pattern of faunal similarity with distance. the effects of long-term disturbance dissi- pate as distance increases downstream and the com- munity responds to this dissipation with an increase in faunal similarity. although this study identiﬁes a longitudinal pattern of recovery downstream from nonhydroelectric impoundments, more information is needed on stream community responses to distur- bances, particularly over distance. stream ﬁsh recovery resumen 1. comparamos los ensamblajes de peces observados en un muestreo realizado en 1968 antes de embalsar en rı´o bear creek (cuenca del rio´ tennessee, usa), con colecciones recientes con el ﬁn de detectar niveles de recuperacio´ n especial. 2. para las colecciones recientes, detectamos una relacio´ n positiva entre la riqueza de especies y la distancia desde los embalses pero esta relacio´ n no fue signiﬁcativa para las colecciones histo´ ricas de las mismas localidades y la distancia desde los embalses. tambie´n hubo relaciones positivas entre la similitud y las distancias utilizando los ı´ndices de jaccard y de morisita. inmediatamente por debajo de los embalses, los ensamblajes de peces diﬁeron de las colecciones histo´ ricas pero los niveles de similitud aumentaron hacia los 10 y 20 km de distancia. 3. los resultados sugieren que los patrones de recuperacio´ n para los ensamblajes de peces esta´n presentes aguas debajo de los embalses y que remanentes de la comunidad del rı´o persisten aguas debajo de los embalses actualmente existentes. acknowledgements the authors thank j.w. phillips, j.d. evans, d.c. werneke and s.j. herrington for ﬁeld assistance. funding for an early
