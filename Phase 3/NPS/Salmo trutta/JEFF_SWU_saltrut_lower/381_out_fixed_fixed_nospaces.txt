(2007) further emphasised the importance of the architecture of dendritic ecosystem network (den) in structuring biotic assemblages and highlighted the importance of movement among branches and the heterogeneity of habitats associated with a branch-node structure. when looking at an entire watershed, adventitious streams, deﬁned as streams at than streams into which they ﬂow, often hold more diverse ﬁsh assemblages than similar-sized headwater streams (osborne & wiley 1992). this could be explained by the proximity of adventitious streams from the colonising source, in contrast with (gorman 1986). therefore, at a watershed scale, stream ﬁsh the mainstream, tributaries three stream orders smaller headwater least correspondence: y. z. yan, college of life sciences, anhui normal university, 1 of beijing east road, wuhu 241000, china. e-mail: yanyunzhi1976@yahoo.com.cn doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00478.x 199 yan et al. assemblages are inﬂuenced both by the position along upstream–downstream gradient, which reﬂects stream size and habitat condition, and by the spatial position within the drainage network, which deter- mines the rate of ﬁsh immigration and extinction (grenouillet et al. 2004; smith & kraft 2005). the spatial pattern of ﬁsh assemblages along upstream–downstream gradient is well established, especially in american temperate and european mediterranean areas (matthews 1998). however, the pattern of how stream spatial position inﬂuences ﬁsh assemblages still remains debated and unclear (smith & kraft 2005). this question was raised by fausch et al. (1984), who observed higher species richness in collections near mouth of tributaries entering large rivers. gorman (1986) found ﬁsh assemblages in adventitious streams were more diverse than headwa- ter streams. osborne & wiley (1992) examined the effects of four measures of stream size (i.e., drainage area, stream order, link magnitude and downstream link) on ﬁsh assemblages. they revealed that down- stream link explained the greatest portion of the variance in species richness, indicating that down- stream processes signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ﬁsh assem- blages. grenouillet et al. (2004) described the relative inﬂuence of local habitat and stream spatial position on species richness of ﬁsh assemblages. they discov- ered signiﬁcant inﬂuence of both habitat (stream width and gradient) and spatial variables. but the spatial autocorrelation was only signiﬁcant downstream (from fourth- to seventh-order streams), suggesting the relative importance of local habitat and biotic pro- cesses may depend on the position along the longitu- dinal gradient. smith & kraft (2005) evaluated the relative inﬂuence of habitat and stream spatial position on both species richness and abundance of ﬁsh assemblages, especially compared the effects of ﬁve spatial variables, i.e., stream order, link magnitude, branch link, conﬂuence link and downstream link. they revealed that conﬂuence link, but not down- stream link as described by other researchers, was the signiﬁcant factor among spatial variables inﬂuencing ﬁsh assemblages. in this study, the relative inﬂuence of local habitat and spatial position on ﬁsh assemblages was sur- veyed in a dammed stream, the qingyi stream, in china. associated with extensive agricultural and industrial productions, urbanisation development and hydraulic engineering constructions, most stream ecosystems in china are experiencing massive eco- logical perturbation, which threatens freshwater ﬁshes in these systems (chen 2005). in the qingyi stream, numerous and diverse dams were constructed for electricity generation, farmland irrigation and domes- tic water consumption in the mid–late 20th century. dams can signiﬁcantly alter the distribution and 200 the most abundance of stream ﬁshes by blocking migratory pathways (march et al. 2003), altering natural ﬂow regime (bonner & wilde 2000), decreasing (clarkson & childs 2000) or increasing (lessard & hayes 2003) downstream water temperature, decreasing current velocity upstream (bennett et al. 2002), increasing ﬂow velocity downstream (kondolf 1997), altering food webs (power et al. 1996), disrupting riparian plant communities (nilsson et al. 1997) and shifting water chemistry (humborg et al. 1997). grant et al. (2007) stated that mediating the speciﬁc species within a movement pattern of dendritic network is one of important mechanisms that explain how the network archi- tecture of dens inﬂuences community dynamic. therefore, we hypothesise that ﬁsh assemblages in dammed streams are determined mainly by local habitat conditions, while the inﬂuence of spatial position could be weakened by dams, if the immi- gration or emigration of ﬁsh is the underlying mechanism that explains the importance of stream spatial position. this study was aimed to (i) deter- mine the pure and combined inﬂuences of local habitat and spatial position on ﬁsh species richness; (ii) determine the inﬂuence of habitat and spatial position on ﬁsh assemblages and (iii) test our local habitat conditions are more hypothesis that important than spatial position in inﬂuencing ﬁsh assemblages in a dammed stream. materials and methods study area the qingyi stream watershed originates in the north- the huangshan mountain, anhui ern portion of province, china, and ﬂows northeast toward its conﬂuence with the lower reach of the yangtze river. this watershed is 309 km long at mainstem and 7195 km2 of area. because of the subtropical monsoon climate, the qingyi stream is characterised by asym- metry in seasonal temperature and precipitation. mean annual air temperature, ranging from )22.1 °c (jan- uary) to 27.5 °c (july), is 17.8 °c. annual rainfall is )1), but quite abundant (approximately 2000 mmæyear about 79% of rainfall occurs during spring and summer (from april to september) and less than 5% during the cold and dry winter. in the mid–late 20th century, numerous and diverse dams were built in this area. among them, there are at least 200 hydropower stations (including the chencun hydropower station, being the largest station at the lower reach of the yangtze river) and almost 1000 low-head dams (<4 m in height) built irrigation and drinking water supply. for fish assemblages in a dammed stream fig. 1. map of the qingyi stream water- shed in anhui province, china. solid circles marked the 89 sampling sites. part hydro- ) and low-head dams power stations ( ) were shown. ( fish sampling derived from anhui province topographic maps (1:300,000 scale), the qingyi stream is ﬁfth order (strahler 1957) at its mainstream. within this wa- tershed, 75 ﬁrst-order, 34 second-order, 12 third-order, 4 fourth-order and 1 ﬁfth-order streams have been numbered. a total of 60 ﬁrst-order, 22 second-order and 7 third-order segments were surveyed once during october 2009 in this study (fig. 1). sample sites, each 50 m long and not more than 1 m depth, were selected in the ﬁeld based on habitat representativeness and accessibility. each site was far from dams upstream (>1.0 km) and encompassed at least two mesohabitat units such as pools and rifﬂes. fish were collected using backpack electro-ﬁshing gear (cwb-2000 p, china; 12 v import, 250 v export) by wading in two passes with comparable effort (30–40 min). fish were identiﬁed to species (except for ctenogobius ﬁsh because of the deﬁciency in identifying tools), counted and returned to the sampling sites if alive. voucher specimens were soaked in 8% formaldehyde solution for further identiﬁcation. habitat survey each sampling site was characterised using 10 vari- ables to describe local environmental conditions: fig. 2. hypothetical example of a stream network for delineating spatial position variables: link magnitude (link), conﬂuence ink (c-link) and down- stream link (d-link) – for a simpliﬁed watershed. stream order, elevation (m), wetted width (m), water depth (m), )1), water temperature (°c), ph, conductivity (msæcm )1), dissolved oxygen (ppm), current velocity (mæs )1) and substrate size (%). elevation discharge (m3æs was determined by global positioning system (gps). wetted width was measured along ﬁve transects, regularly spaced across the stream channel. water depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ph and con- ductivity were surveyed at four equal interval points along each transect. current velocity was taken at 60% of water depth at each point of each transect. discharge of each channel was determined at the transect that yielded the most accurate measurement (smooth bottom and laminar ﬂow). along each transect, the proportion of substrate categories (particle size 3 = 5–25 mm; 4 = 25–50 mm; 5 = 50–100 mm; 6 = 100–500 mm; 7 = 500–1000 mm; 8 ‡ 1000 mm) was visually esti- mated, and an index of substrate coarseness ranging from 1 to 8 was derived for each site following bain et al. (1985). 1 = 0–1 mm; 2 = 1–5 mm; spatial position description in addition to stream order (strahler 1957), three other watershed-level metrics were described to evaluate the inﬂuence of stream spatial position on ﬁsh assem- blages: stream link magnitude, conﬂuence link and 201 yan et al. downstream link (fig. 2). stream link magnitude (link) is deﬁned as the number of unbranched source stream upstream from a given segment in the drainage network (shreve 1966). conﬂuence link (c-link) is the number of conﬂuences downstream from each stream segment (fairchild et al. 1998). downstream link (d-link) is the link magnitude of the next downstream conﬂuence (osborne & wiley 1992). descriptions of these spatial variables were assigned to each segment derived from anhui province topographic maps (1:300,000 scales). signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) of the cca gradients was assessed by monte carlo permutation tests and their importance measured by the eigenvalues of the ﬁrst two axes (ter braak & verdonschot 1995). remaining variables were ordered by their importance in account- ing for additional variance in the species data, and this procedure was repeated for each variable included in this model. the remaining species were analysed separately, and excluded from the analysis if occurring in less than two sites, to avoid negligible weighting (gauch 1982). data analysis results importance value index (ivi), a synthetically quanti- tative index indicating the functional status and role of a speciﬁc species within a community, was assessed for each species as following: ivi = fi (%) · pi (%), where fi and pi are the frequency of occurrence and relative abundance of species i, respectively (krebs (1989). linear regression was used to estimate the inﬂuence of local habitat and stream spatial position on local species richness (legendre & legendre 1998). the procedures included separate stepwise analysis for each group of factors, to select the reduced subset of variables that maximally accounted for variation in each response variable. this method isolates three components of explained variation: pure habitat variation, pure stream spatial position and combined habitat ⁄ spatial variation. prior to analysis, log-transformations were used to reduce the inﬂuence of extreme value in elevation, width, depth and spatial factors. the spss 11.5 statistics package (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) was used to perform statistical analysis, and statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at p < 0.05. discrete spatial pattern in ﬁsh assemblages was identiﬁed using primer 5.0. (primer-e ltd., plymouth, uk). species richness and abundance data were log(x + 1) transformed to meet assumptions of multivariate normality and to moderate the inﬂuence of extreme data. following a bray–curtis similarity matrix calculation, a two-way crossed anosim was used to test the inﬂuences of stream order and headwater ⁄ adventitious attribute on ﬁsh assemblages. the contribution of each species to differences among assemblage groups was identiﬁed using the simper (clarke & warwick 2001). using canoco 4.5 (microcomputer power, ithaca, ny, usa) software package, a canonical correspondence analysis (cca) was performed to evaluate the variability in ﬁsh assemblages in relation to local habitat and stream spatial position variables. subsequently, all the vari- ables entered the analysis after a forward selection procedure, showing their importance in explaining the total variability in the species composition. the 202 overview of species diversity species and per

(a) ten habitat environmental variables and four spatial location variables were examined with ﬁsh assemblage; (b) using the forward selection by using the monte carlo permutation test, as a result, removing those subordinate factors, then depth, substrates, elevation and link & c-link were selected as the main indicators about ﬁsh assemblage. the black arrows indicated the most important factors, and the grey arrows showed the other factors. species codes as in table 1. 205 yan et al. competition and predation (gorman 1988; harvey & stewart 1991; grossman et al. 1998; dauwalter et al. 2008). the variability in habitat complexity and diver- sity along upstream–downstream gradient is one of the underlying mechanisms that explain why stream ﬁsh assemblages vary spatially (matthews 1986). shelter availability (abes & agostinho 2001), substrate (aad- land 1993), water depth (harvey & stewart 1991), current velocity (magoulick 2004), water temperature (wang et al. 2003), woody debris (gregory et al. 1991) and relative bed stability (kaufmann & hughes 2006) have all been shown to inﬂuence stream ﬁsh assem- blages. in this study, 10 variables were measured to determine the inﬂuence of local habitat on ﬁsh assem- blages. based on linear regression models, wetted width and water temperature were the factors signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing species richness in the qingyi stream. in addition, elevation, substrate and water depth were identiﬁed to determine ﬁsh assemblages according to the cca. our ﬁndings are consistent with the well- established notion that stream size is the most important factor inﬂuencing ﬁsh assemblages (including species richness), because the variation in stream size is often associated with the changes of water depth and width, elevation and substrate (matthews & robison 1988). the differing thermal tolerances of different species also affect ﬁsh distributions (petts 2000) and thus ﬁsh assemblage composition. rates richness because of the differential rates of immigration and extinction of ﬁshes among different streams within a watershed, ﬁsh assemblages are also inﬂuenced by the stream spatial position determining ‘immigration– extinction’ (osborne & wiley 1992). the importance of immigration and extinction dynamics in structuring stream ﬁsh assemblages has been underlined in a number of studies (e.g., angermeier & schlosser 1989; gotelli & taylor 1999; taylor & warren 2001). however, the pattern of how stream spatial position structures ﬁsh assemblages is not well established and remains debated. osborne & wiley (1992) found a signiﬁcant relationship between d-link and ﬁsh species illinois watershed, but grenouillet et al. (2004) found the similar result using downstream local species richness (d-lsr). smith & kraft (2005) revealed that ﬁsh species richness was affected by stream order, d-link and c-link within a beaverkill–willowemoc wa- tershed in new york. in addition, b-link (branch link), the number of branches along a path to the right (+) or left ()) of the central axis of mainstream, was also shown to affect species richness (nieman 1996). as b-link is considered to be limited by only providing information about how the watershed differs on one side or the other of a mainstream branch (smith & kraft 2005), stream order, link, d-link and c-link are selected to identify how stream spatial position in a central 206 inﬂuences ﬁsh assemblages in this study. our results show that only stream order signiﬁcantly structures ﬁsh species richness when examining the relationship between species richness and pure spatial variables. however, only habitat variables are screened out to signiﬁcantly affect species richness when considering the combined inﬂuences of local habitat and spatial position, but spatial variables are all less important. in addition, our result also presents that, by using the forward selection procedure of the cca, link and c- link, rather than stream order and d-link, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ﬁsh assemblages in the study stream. in our result, p. oxycephalus, pseudogobio vaillanti, ac. fas- ciatus and v. stenosoma are most abundant in streams with high c-link, but mastacembelus aculeatus, a. riv- ularis, c. carpio and c. auratus display the opposite pattern. this can be well explained by their speciﬁc ecological traits, because the former four species always inhabit small streams characterised by high elevation, fast ﬂow and coarse substrate, but the latter are common in the lentic systems (i.e., lakes) and tranquil ﬂows (i.e., large rivers) (chen 1998; yue 2000). for example, most phoxinus ﬁshes are endemic in montane headwaters, and their distributions are often intensively constrained by cold water temperature (chen 1998). adult ac. fas- ciatus usually inhabit beneath cobbles or boulders in deep lotic waters with spawning occurring in shallow lotic rifﬂes (yan et al. 2009), while c. carpio is widely naturally distributed in most lakes, reservoirs and large rivers in china (yue 2000). however, sarcocheilichthys parvus, a. tafangensis, parabotia fasciata, squalidus argentatus and acheilognathus barbatulus often prefer middle-sized streams or pools in small streams to dwell (chen 1998; yue 2000), which could perhaps explain why the distributions of these species are closely correlated with link but not c-link in our study. fairchild et al. (1998) found a similar result in a cca ordination of ﬁsh assemblages with a south-eastern pennsylvania watershed: c-link and link accounted for 13.5% of the variation in species composition among sites. smith & kraft (2005) found the signiﬁcant effect of c-link and stream order on species composition by the cca and stated that c-link was greatly informative in determining the inﬂuence of tributary spatial position on ﬁsh assemblage because of its ability to distinguish between headwater and adventitious streams. the utility of c-link is also supported by the relevance of stream conﬂuences to geomorphological processes within dens that are likely to inﬂuence ecological processes (grant et al. 2007). dams can extensively impact stream ﬁsh assem- blages in diverse ways, such as the blocking of migration routes and the loss of navigational cues (drinkwater & frank 1994), the fragmentation of habitat with associated isolation of larvae and juve- niles at water intakes (travnichek et al. 1993), the result suggests that alteration of natural of hydrologic and geomorphic regimes (ligon et al. 1995), the decline in biodiversity and the alteration of natural food webs (power et al. 1996) and the shift in water chemistry (humborg et al. 1997). based on the serial discontinuity concept (stanford & ward 2001), dams and other anthropic activities (e.g., pollution and erosion.) should disrupt the underlying stream continuum, causing longitudinal in the abiotic and biotic parameters and shifts processes. our local habitat in inﬂuencing ﬁsh conditions are more important species richness than spatial position in the dammed qingyi stream watershed. this could be explained by the fact that dams block the immigration routes of ﬁshes from mainstream to tributaries, which weakens the effect of stream spatial position on species richness. however, our result also presents that ﬁsh assemblages are signiﬁcantly different between headwater and adventitious streams in spite of the similar species richness, which is associated with the variation in relative abundance of z. platypus, c. sp., ac. fasciatus (common in headwaters), r. ocellatus, o. obscures and a. rivularis (common in adventitious streams). thornbrugh & gido (2010) found that ﬁsh assemblage structure in adventitious streams was different from headwater streams, but species richness was also signiﬁcantly higher in adventitious streams in the kansas river basin. two spatial position variables, c-link and link, are discovered to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence species compositions among tributaries in our study. therefore, our results suggest that, in a heavily dammed watershed, the importance of the relative inﬂuences of local habitat and stream spatial position on ﬁsh assemblages depends on the community descriptor used. fish species richness is mainly determined by local habitat environment, but not stream spatial position, which could be a result of the negative effect of dams on ﬁsh movements between tributary and conﬂuence. but both local habitat and stream spatial position are important in structuring ﬁsh species composition, which suggests that the distribution of speciﬁc species in a den is determined by its inherent ecological traits (e.g., habitat preference) despite the fact that dams possibly constrain the potential movement of ﬁshes. in
