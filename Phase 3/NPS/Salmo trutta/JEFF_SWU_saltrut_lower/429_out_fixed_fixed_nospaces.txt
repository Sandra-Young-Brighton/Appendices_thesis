(1996) found that brown_trout were normally solitary, whereas grayling lived solitarily as well as in groups. the study also revealed indications of microhabitat segregation between the species, with grayling oc- curring further from the river bank. both species are drift feeders when young (mu¨ller 1957; kalle- berg 1958; o’brien & showalter 1993; sempeski & gaudin 1996). although the diets of the two spe- cies overlap broadly, trout tend to feed more on surface insects and grayling more on benthos such as trichoptera larvae, molluscs and crustaceans (so¨mme 1935; mu¨ller 1957; northcote 1995). with 191 degerman et al. increasing size, both species can shift over to a ﬁsh diet (elliott 1994, peterson 1968), although this seems to be more common among trout. the spe- cies also have different life histories in scandina- vian waters: grayling populations spawn soon after ice-break; the eggs hatch after 2–3 weeks, and the young leave the spawning streams immediately or after their ﬁrst summer (gustafsson 1949; mu¨ller- haeckel 1984; kristiansen & døving 1996). by contrast, young brown_trout usually remain in their native stream throughout life or, at the very least, for 2–3 years. although maturation patterns differ between the sexes in brown_trout, with males maturing earlier, a norwegian study revealed no such difference in grayling (haugen & rygg 1996). in addition, they found that male and female gray- ling were about the same size, whereas trout often show sexual dimorphism in size, with females being larger (elliott 1994). spawning, however, the two salmonids are also similar in that they both occupy a wide range of habitats, including streams, rivers, lakes and coastal areas (peterson 1968; elliott 1994). both species are less common in shallow stream stretches close to lakes, probably as a result of interactions with lake spe- cies (degerman & sers 1994). they often spawn in small streams with a hard bottom, grayling prefer- ring ﬁner substratum. although inlet streams are normally used for they sometimes spawn in outlet streams and, on rare occasions, along lake shores. both species have a highly pre- cise homing ability (sva¨rdson & fagerstro¨m 1982; kristiansen & døving 1996). as they grow, and their swimming ability increases, young grayling (scott 1985; sempeski & gaudin 1995) and brown_trout (bohlin 1977) both move progressively further out from the river bank to deeper water. both species prefer current velocities below 0.1 m ` s»1 when young (2–6 cm grayling and 2–4 cm for brown_trout) (greenberg et al. 1996). in the same study, medium-sized trout (7–11 cm) oc- curred over the same type of substratum as me- dium-sized grayling (9–18 cm). the habitat preferences and diets of salmonids are known to be affected by the presence of com- peting species (e.g. nilsson 1965; dewald & wilz- bach 1992; nakano 1995), and even life history may be inﬂuenced (na¨slund et al. 1998). given the similar feeding behaviors of grayling and trout in running water and the fact that both species fre- quently spawn in small tributary streams, there is good reason to assume that competition between the two species in areas of sympatry could occur during the ﬁrst period. the present study tests the hypothesis that underyearling trout and grayling interact during their ﬁrst summer to such a degree that it affects their occurrence, abundance, habitat 192 use, growth and/or diet. the study was based pri- marily on electroﬁshing survey data from a data- base containing results from localities throughout sweden. based on the results of the data analysis, an experiment in a semi-natural stream was de- signed in which the behaviors of underyearling trout and grayling in sympatry could be compared with allopatric situations. study area field experiments were carried out in july and september 1994 in a small, semi-natural stream at the ka¨larne fish hatchery (63(cid:190) 00¿ n, 16(cid:190) 05¿ e). the stream is a natural side-channel of the river ansjo¨ån in which the water ﬂow is regulated, and the in- and out-migration of ﬁsh –50 mm is pre- vented. in the july experiment a rifﬂe area (total length 18.8 m) was divided into seven sections. water depth and velocity were measured at 0.5-m intervals along transects. each section had a uni- form habitat, but the average water depth and av- erage water velocity varied between them (0.07– 0.16 m and 0.11–0.44 m ` s»1 respectively). the stream width of each section varied from 1.4 to 2.2 m, and the surface area ranged from 2.0 to 10.4 m2. in september, we used the entire experimental stream (93.7 m) which was conceptually separated into ﬁve sections, two rifﬂe sections and three run sections. each section had a uniform habitat. again, the average water depth and velocity varied between sections (0.18–0.39 m and 0.3–1.8 m ` s»1 respectively). the stream width was 2.1–4.8 m, and the areas were 30.1–91.6 m2 in size. the ﬂow in july and september was 0.06 and 0.1 m3` s»1, re- spectively. the bottom substrate varied from 70% sand and no boulders to 10% sand and 35% boul- ders. material and methods survey data electroﬁshing data were compiled from the swed- ish electroﬁshing register (sers), which com- prises approximately 16,000 electroﬁshing oc- casions at 7500 different localities. only localities in the northern part of sweden, within or north of the river dala¨lven catchment (approx. north of 60(cid:190)n), were included (n‰3146), since this is the main area where grayling and brown_trout coexist in sweden. most data stem from electroﬁshing sur- veys made in august or september, i.e. when underyearlings of these species can be reliably cap- tured. electroﬁshing was generally carried out using dc-equipment from lugab or biowave, sweden. the abundance of ﬁsh was determined by successive-removal ﬁshing according to bohlin (1984). at localities where successive removal was not performed the total abundance of ﬁsh was esti- mated on the basis of average catch probabilities for the respective species and age groups (sers & degerman 1992). the ﬁsh were measured to the nearest mm total length, but were not weighed or sexed. classiﬁ- cation of brown_trout and grayling into the age groups underyearling (0„) and older ﬁsh was based on length frequencies. in cases where age de- terminations were difﬁcult, otoliths were used, or the ﬁsh were omitted. for each locality the geographical location (lati- tude, longitude and altitude), stream width, aver- age depth, maximum depth, and air and water temperatures were recorded. the bottom sub- stratum was classiﬁed into ﬁve categories (1–5; ﬁne ((cid:176)0.0002 m), sand (0.0002–0.002 m), gravel (0.002–0.02 m), stones (0.02–0.2 m), boulders (–0.2 m)), with coarser particles being given a higher value. the sampling sites were classiﬁed based on their average surface-water velocity into three categories (1–3), i.e. slow stretches ((cid:176)0.2 m ` s»1), intermediate stretches (0.2–0.7 m ` s»1) and rapids (–0.7 m ` s»1). in addition, the dis- tances from each sampling locality to lakes up- stream and downstream were recorded. catchment areas were classiﬁed into four size categories: (cid:176)10 km2, (cid:176)100 km2, (cid:176)1000 km2 and –1000 km2. the proportion of lakes of the upstream catchment was classiﬁed into four categories: (cid:176)1%, 1–4.9%, 5– 10%, –10%. field experiment the ﬁsh used in the experiment were underyearling grayling and brown_trout of hatchery origin (in- dalsa¨lven and stavre stocks, respectively) reared at the ka¨larne hatchery. both stocks originate from rivers in which grayling and brown_trout coexist. the ﬁsh were spread uniformly among the sections in relation to their respective areas. for each sub- section we compared the predicted abundance, i.e. all ﬁsh uniformly spread throughout the experi- mental stream, with observed abundance. first, only trout (200 individuals) were used. after 3 days in july (4–15 july) and 7 days in sep- tember (5–27 september) the ﬁsh were caught using electroﬁshing equipment once each section had been fenced off from adjoining sections with nets. electroﬁshing continued until no further indi- viduals were captured. for each section the total number of individuals captured was recorded. the experiment was then carried out in the same way using 100 juvenile trout together with 100 juvenile grayling. the total number of individuals was young trout and grayling habitat use thereby kept at 200. finally, the experiment was repeated with 200 juvenile grayling. the length (mm) and weight (0.1 g) of each ﬁsh were recorded. the condition factor (f) was calculated in accord- ance with fulton (ricker 1975): f‰weight (g)/ (length (mm))3(cid:192)100,000. fish stomachs were removed and preserved in 70% ethanol. the relative importance of the vari- ous types of prey in the diet was described in terms of frequency of occurrence (frost 1954) and dom- inance index (frost & went 1940). the diets of 30– 40 individuals of each ﬁsh species were analyzed using specimens collected from the treatment con- taining sympatric species. the ﬁsh individuals used for stomach analysis were chosen in such a way that ﬁsh from different habitat types were repre- sented in relation to the density of each species in the respective habitat. aquatic insects except dip- tera were determined to species when possible. specimens that could not be determined to species were determined to order. where appropriate, or- ders or species were separated into larvae, nymphs, pupae or adults. dietary overlap between the spe- cies was tested using schoener (1970): a‰2»0.5son |pxi»pyi|d i‰1 where pxi is the proportion of prey type i in the diet of species x; pyi is the proportion of prey type i in the diet of species y, and n is the number of prey types. an overlap ﬂ0.6 was considered sig- niﬁcant. results sers data occurrence and abundance

localities where 0„ grayling were caught differed considerably from the other localities in the data set. grayling localities were generally situ- ated in lower regions of larger streams (width, depth, catchment size) with a higher water velocity and more species (table 3). burbot (lota lota l.), pike (esox lucius l.), atlantic salmon and euro- pean minnow (phoxinus phoxinus l.) occurred more frequently at localities with 0„ grayling than at localities without underyearling grayling, but the most frequent species was brown_trout (table 3). at localities with underyearling grayling, older grayling were sparser and the abundance of trout lower, compared with localities without underyear- ling grayling (tables 1, 2). growth pattern the ﬁrst growth season. although grayling hatch later in

abundance of 0„ grayling. surface-water velocity and the presence of 0„ trout did not interact signiﬁcantly in their effects on the occurrence of 0„ grayling. but it should be stressed that water velocity was only broken down into three classes, i.e. slow, intermediate and fast. the average length of 0„ trout did not differ be- tween localities with 0„ grayling and those with- out 0„ grayling, nor did the presence of 0„ trout have any effect on the length of 0„ grayling (anova, n.s., with day of the year and altitude as signiﬁcant covariates). field experiments july experiment. during the experiment in july, trout fry were signiﬁcantly longer and heavier than grayling fry (table 4). in the treatment with both species, the abundance of trout was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with depth (r‰»0.81) and positively correlated with velocity (r‰0.76) (least squares linear regression, p(cid:176)0.05), whereas no correlation was found in the absence of grayling (fig. 4). in addition,

trout and grayling occurred at 61% and 21%, respectively, of the localities. the occurrence of 0„ grayling was signiﬁcantly lower at localities where 0„ trout occurred (17%) compared with localities

whereas the abundance of older grayling was low and equal at both types of localit- ies (mean of 0.16 individuals/100 m2). habitat use by 0„ grayling varied depending on the occurrence of 0„ trout. in the presence of trout, grayling occurred less frequently on the coarser substrates and more of the ﬁner (fig. 2, two-way anova, p(cid:176)0.001 for the interaction of substratum and trout). no

sections than in shallower ones (anova, p‰0.007), whereas no difference was found in the treatment with both species (p‰0.14). due to the rapid growth of ﬁsh during their ﬁrst summer, length, weight and condition changed rapidly. although there was only four days differ- ence between the start of the trout-only and trout„grayling ﬁeld tests in july, the length, weight and condition factor of trout were signiﬁcantly higher in the latter test (anova, p(cid:176)0.001). the individual condition factor did not differ between shallow and deep sections for either of the species when co-occurring. when both species were pres- ent, grayling had a signiﬁcantly lower average weight and condition in sympatry than in allopa- try and in deeper parts than in shallow sections (anova, all

(chi-square test, p–0.05). for grayling the disappearance rate was signiﬁcantly lower in the absence of trout (38 %) than in their presence (56%) (chi-square test, p(cid:176)0.05). in the sections containing both species the disappearance rate was signiﬁcantly higher for grayling than for trout (chi-square test, p(cid:176)0.05). baetis nymphs and chironomid pupae were the most frequently

chironomids occurring most frequently in both species (table 6). these taxa also dominated in most trout stomachs, whereas trichoptera pupae were more common in the grayling diet. the mean number of food items per stomach was 20 for trout and 40 for grayling. the schoener index was 0.87, indicating that the dietary overlap was signiﬁcant. discussion the sers data revealed considerable differences between the stream biotopes that grayling and trout occupied in late summer, with grayling pri- marily occurring in lower regions of larger streams, but that the two species coexisted at intermediate localities. focusing on underyearling ﬁsh, the analysis of the electroﬁshing database suggested that the species might interact to some degree: the frequency of occurrence of 0„ grayling was lower at localities with 0„ brown_trout. this could be due simply to different habitat preferences, but it was also evident that the way in which 0„ grayling utilized the habitat differed depending on whether 0„ trout were present or not. although these ﬁndings could be explained by a direct negative interaction between the trout and grayling, other species or habitat preferences also could have been responsible for the observed ef- fects. several other species were found associated with grayling, some of which are known predators on salmonids (degerman & sers 1993; greenberg 1999). these other species could have negatively affected populations of the young salmonids, and under natural conditions such an inﬂuence would be hard to distinguish from direct interactions be- tween salmonid species. in an attempt to validate the indications of the survey-data analysis and eliminate the effects of predation and competition caused by species other than the salmonids, ﬁeld experiments were carried out under semi-natural conditions. these trials showed some consistent differences in habitat use between the species with respect to depth and velocity. trout tended to occupy shal- lower sections and grayling deeper ones, irrespec- tive of the presence of the other species. basic dif- ferences in habitat preferences between sibling spe- cies are a common phenomenon (e.g. heggenes & saltveit 1990; heggenes 1996; nakano & kaeirya- ma 1995). for example, brown_trout and atlantic salmon occur together in streams in northern eur- ope. young salmon parr prefer higher water velo- cities and are often found in shallower sections compared with trout parr (heggenes et al. 1995). during the 1970s an acidiﬁcation-induced decrease 198 in the ph of rivers on the west coast of sweden led to a decline in salmon populations. in response to this decline, populations of the more acid-tolerant trout expanded, but they were unable to exploit much of the habitat that had previously been occu- pied by salmon (degerman & appelberg 1992). following liming, populations of salmon increased and trout populations decreased. thus, the two species had different basic habitat preferences, but competed for intermediate habitats. intermediate habitats may occur. this in several cases in the ﬁeld experiment the as- sociations between abundance and habitat use were only signiﬁcant when both species were pres- ent. this lends some support to the hypothesis that, although grayling and trout show basic dif- ferences in their habitat preferences, competition for is further supported by results from the electroﬁshing database in which habitat use by young grayling differed depending on whether young trout were present. grayling were more frequent on coarser substratum and occurred more frequently at deeper localities when underyearling trout were ab- sent, which is in accordance with greenberg’s (1999) results from artiﬁcial streams where brown_trout caused grayling to increase its use of shallow margins. in the ﬁeld experiments the correlation with the biological parameters studied was most often highest for depth. this could partly be due to the fact that depth was a better index of habitat com- pared with average water velocity since the actual velocities in the different microhabitats occupied by individual ﬁsh were not measured. the same problem was encountered in the survey data; i.e., the surface water velocity was only classiﬁed into three categories, whereas average depth was meas- ured to the nearest cm. in these data velocity and substratum type were strongly correlated, which was also the case in the ﬁeld experiments. there- fore, based on the present results, we cannot draw any conclusions as to whether depth or substratum is more important than velocity. the optimal habi- tat can be envisioned as an optimal combination of depth, velocity, substratum and other parameters leading to optimal growth with little predation risk (heggenes et al. 1995). body size is of crucial importance in determin- ing the outcome of competition between salmonids (bachman 1984; hearn 1987; hughes 1992). there were no indications in the electroﬁshing data that the length of 0„ trout was affected by the presence of grayling, or vice versa. due to their earlier hatching date and larger eggs, brown_trout fry are initially larger than grayling fry, but from august and onwards grayling are normally larger than trout. in early july, when the ﬁrst ﬁeld experiment was run, trout (40 mm) were still on average larger than grayling (35 mm). at this stage grayling fry shift from positions in the upper layer of the water column close to the river banks to positions close to the bottom further from the bank (sempeski & gaudin 1995). brown_trout fry, which initially use stream-margin habitat, gradually move to deeper and deeper water as they grow (bohlin 1977). thus, both species may use stream-margin and channel habitats, i.e., they have similar microhabi- tat preferences early in life. this may lead to com- petition for space during this period. that such competition occurred is supported by the results of the july experiment in which habitat use differed, depending on whether or not the species co-oc- curred, and there was no dietary overlap. the fact that grayling showed poorer condition and a higher disappearance rate in the presence of trout indicates that competition is more detrimental in small streams to this species when young. grayling in general have higher disappearance rates in stocking experiments as compared to brown_trout (carlstein & eriksson 1996; thorfve & carlstein 1998), but this was only the case in july in the present study. in september when 0„ grayling are larger, the degree of habitat segregation seems to be more pronounced and the level of interspeciﬁc interaction less intense. grayling use deeper, more slow-ﬂowing areas, whereas trout mainly remain in the rifﬂes. this is also in line with the results of greenberg et al. (1996). the same situation was reﬂected in the electroﬁshing survey data, i.e., the result could be the consequence of competition leading to species segregation in order to lessen the intensity of direct interactions. diets could there- fore overlap in september by which time the spe- cies had segregated and were using different parts of the habitat. in july, when the two species were more similar in size, direct competition was indi- cated by the lack of dietary overlap. abundances in the ﬁeld experiment were ap- proximately two magnitudes larger than the aver- age of natural populations. this could have lead to exaggerated interactions between individuals and species compared with natural conditions. how- ever, each experiment was kept rather short to pre- vent the rapid growth of the ﬁsh from becoming a confounding factor in the comparison between the single-species and two-species systems. further, the experiment stream is productive compared to the average stream in the sers data, and thus nat- urally supports higher abundances than the aver- age stream. ideally the experimental design should have allowed simultaneous trials. due to the short ex- posure, any effects that the larger, dominant spe- cies had on the smaller species might have been young trout and grayling habitat use masked by the initial stress associated with han- dling and introduction into the new habitat, to which all ﬁsh were exposed. in addition, data on the microhabitat use of individual ﬁsh would have made a more detailed analysis possible. thus, the design of the ﬁeld experiment could be improved. to sum up, grayling and trout showed basic dif- ferences in habitat choice (measured in terms of several parameters), but to some extent their habi- tat use might have been inﬂuenced by the presence of other competing species. in the short term, in- teractions between the two species could lead to a decrease in condition and increased disappearance rates, accompanied by short-distance habitat shifts. the survey data, which could represent the long-term effects of this suggested interaction be- tween species, revealed that the species had become segregated at the microhabitat level in areas of sympatry. the study indicates that although the two species could compete for habitat early in the summer, they show basic differences in habitat preferences. thus the level of competition is prob- ably highest in intermediate habitats. later in the season, competition intensity decreases as the spe- cies segregate. hence, it should be stressed that habitat-hydraulic modelling alone is not sufﬁcient to describe habitat utilization in salmonids (hegg- enes 1996) because biotic interactions also inﬂu- ence habitat use (this study, degerman & sers 1993; greenberg 1999). based on the present results, it can be suggested that the introduction of grayling to streams with brown_trout would lead to a narrowing of the microhabitat types used by trout. the change would be particularly pronounced in deep, slow- ﬂowing stretches where grayling would tend to re- place trout. here the introduction of grayling could lead to shifts in the habitat-use patterns and life history of the trout (na¨slund et al. 1998). al- though this should result in a lower trout biomass in the stream, the extra grayling biomass should compensate for this reduction (woolland 1988). resumen 1. hemos utilizado datos de pesca ele´ctrica y experimentos de campo para estudiar el uso de habitats de juveniles de salmo_trutta y thymallus_thymallus en
