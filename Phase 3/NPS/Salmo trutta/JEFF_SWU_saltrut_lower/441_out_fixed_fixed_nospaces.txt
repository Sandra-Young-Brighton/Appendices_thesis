stable isotope analysis; bull trout; lake_trout; competitive exclusion introduction introduced species can directly affect native species through competition, predation, disease and hybridi- sation (moyle & cech 1996). species introduction may occur both inadvertently and intentionally; how- ever, the resulting outcome on native communities is often negative, regardless of initial intent. for exam- ple, the intentional introduction of mysis diluviana has been shown to alter occurrence and composition of native zooplankton assemblages (rieman & falter 1981; spencer et al. 1999; vander zanden et al. 2003; ellis et al. 2011), growth rates of ﬁsh species (tohtz 1993; stafford et al. 2002) and ﬁsh assemblage structure (spencer et al. 1991; vander zanden et al. 2003; ellis et al. 2011). intentional nonnative ﬁsh introductions over have occurred globally for 3000 years (li & moyle 1999) in an attempt to increase food supply, enhance ﬁshing opportunities, manipulate aquatic systems and change aesthetics (li & moyle 1999). unintentional introduction and invasions may also occur as a result of other activities. for example, sea lampreys (petromyzon marinus), native to lake ontario, four laurentian great lakes after the welland canal was constructed to allow shipping among the lakes (smith 1971). predation on native ﬁshes by sea lampreys is considered to be one of the causes of the decimated ﬁsheries in the laurentian great lakes. however, this is not an isolated event, as introduced species have been implicated in contributing to a majority of the ﬁsh extinctions in the united states (li & moyle 1999). invaded the upper lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush) are top-level predators that have been introduced outside of their correspondence: m. h. meeuwig, biology department, university of nevada, mail stop 315, reno, nv 89557-0001, usa;

martinez et al. 2009). lake_trout have been introduced into many lakes and reservoirs because of their popularity as a sport ﬁsh (martinez et al. 2009). lake_trout were introduced into the flathead lake-river system in 1905 (see spencer et al. 1991). since this introduction, lake_trout have colonised lakes throughout the upper flathead drain- age, including many lakes in glacier national park (gnp), montana, west of the continental divide (fredenberg 2002; meeuwig et al. 2008). within gnp, lake_trout were ﬁrst documented in lake mcdonald in 1959, bowman lake and kintla lake in 1962, logging lake in 1984, harrison lake in 2000, lower quartz lake in 2003 and quartz lake in 2005 (fredenberg 2002; meeuwig & guy 2007). these lakes are within the historic range of bull trout (salvelinus conﬂuentus), a species listed as threatened under the us endangered species act. many bull trout populations within gnp exhibit a lacustrine- adﬂuvial life history in which lake environments are occupied during much of their life history other than for spawning and rearing of juveniles. this results in spatial overlap with invasive lake_trout, which gener- ally exhibit a purely lacustrine life history. within gnp, both bull trout and lake_trout can attain large sizes; for example, mean, upper quartile and maximum total lengths were 380, 468 and 714 mm for bull trout and 422, 544 and 829 mm for lake_trout among lakes (this study). bull trout and lake_trout are both generalist predators that feed on a variety of available aquatic taxa with diets that generally reﬂect food availability (e.g. see martin 1966; scott & crossman 1973; donald & alger 1993; wilhelm et al. 1999; beauchamp & van tassell 2001); however, when present, ﬁsh compose the majority of bull trout and lake_trout diets (donald & alger 1993). therefore, bull trout and lake_trout in many gnp lakes are likely piscivorous because of the availability of a variety of prey ﬁsh (meeuwig et al. 2008). additionally, ﬁsh (i.e. salmonids, cyprinids and catostomids) composed the majority of in lake mcdonald within gnp (dux 2005), and ﬁsh (i.e. salmonids, percids, cyprinids and catostomids) com- posed the majority of bull trout diets in nearby flathead lake and libby reservoir (leathe & graham 1982; dalbey et al. 1998). lake_trout diets by weight the number of bull trout has declined concomi- tantly with an increase in the number of lake_trout in four lakes in gnp; kintla lake, bowman lake, logging lake and lake mcdonald (fredenberg 2002). similarly, introduced lake_trout displaced native bull in bow lake and hector lake, alberta (donald & alger 1993). donald & alger (1993) suggested that competition may have resulted in the observed displacement of bull trout and cite gause’s trout 316 principle (i.e. competitive exclusion; hardin 1960). bull trout and lake_trout had similar growth rates, gape limitations and mouth morphology and had similar food habits in bow lake and hector lake (donald & alger 1993); consequently, donald & alger (1993) further speculated that dietary overlap may limit the ability for these two species to establish sympatric populations. studying trophic relationships between bull trout and lake_trout can help elucidate whether competition for food resources is common in lakes where the distribution of native bull trout and nonnative lake_trout overlaps. food habits studies can be used to examine trophic relationships within species assemblages. food habits studies are often performed through gut content analyses, which entail collecting ﬁsh, removing their gut contents and quantifying the diet of the ﬁsh. fish can be collected and gut contents removed by a variety of techniques, and there are a number of metrics for describing and comparing diet composition (see bowen 1996). gut content analyses can provide ﬁne taxonomic resolution with respect to food habits; however, this method does have limitations. stressful sampling techniques (e.g. gill netting, electroﬁshing) may cause ﬁsh to regurgitate gut contents (bowen 1996). the composition of gut contents may be daily or seasonally variable; therefore, researchers must consider the timing of sampling when designing a study to examine food habits. digestive rates may differ among different prey items, which may bias an analysis of gut contents towards prey items that are more difﬁcult to digest (bowen 1996). stable isotope analysis provides an indirect method for examining trophic relationships. elements such as carbon and nitrogen have more than one isotope (peterson & fry 1987). the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in a sample can be compared to a standard and then expressed in terms of a d value (e.g. d13c and d15n), which is used to quantify the isotopic compo- sition of the sample (peterson & fry 1987). empirical evidence has shown that d15n of a consumer is generally greater than that of its diet (see martı´nez del rio et al. 2009). the difference in d15n between a consumer and its diet is a result of isotopic discrim- ination (martı´nez del rio et al. 2009), which has also been referred to as isotopic fractionation (hobson & clark 1992). general trends in isotopic discrimination between diet and consumer make measurements of d15n useful for examining the trophic position of species within an assemblage. for example, minagawa & wada (1984) observed an average discrimination of 3.4& between d15n values of diet and consumer among a variety of taxa. however, isotopic discrim- ination of d15n can vary considerably depending on diet (e.g. 1.4& for consumers raised on invertebrate diets and 3.3& for consumers raised on high-protein consumers et al. (mccutchan diets; mccutchan et al. 2003). conversely, there is little isotopic discrimination of d13c between diet [e.g. 0.2& in freshwater systems and consumer (france & peters 1997); 0.5& among non ﬂuid- feeding 2003)]; additionally, studies have shown that d13c values of littoral primary producers are greater than those of pelagic primary producers in aquatic systems (france 1995; hecky & hesslein 1995). therefore, d13c measurements have been used for inferring where, or on what group of species, a consumer is feeding (e.g. vander zanden et al. 1999). trophic relationships between predators oregonensis), mountain whiteﬁsh (prosopium_williamsoni), pygmy whiteﬁsh (prosopium_coulterii), largescale sucker (catostomus macrocheilus), longnose sucker (cato- stomus catostomus), northern pikeminnow (ptychoc- heilus (mylocheilus caurinus), redside shiner (richardsonius balteatus), mottled sculpin (cottus bairdi) and slimy sculpin (cottus cognatus). other nonnative ﬁsh species pres- ent in the study system include brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis), kokanee (o. nerka) and lake whiteﬁsh (coregonus_clupeaformis). peamouth stable isotope analysis provides a time-integrated food habits because d13c and d15n estimate of represent the average diet consumed over periods of weeks to months, depending on the turnover rate of the tissue examined (e.g. tieszen et al. 1983). this is in contrast to gut content analysis that provides a point- in-time estimate of diet. relatively few individuals of a species are needed to examine trophic relationships using stable isotope analysis (e.g. <10; vander zanden & rasmussen 2002), unlike gut content analysis that may require the sampling of larger numbers of consumers to achieve an adequate sample size of nonempty stomachs. for example, 27% of bull trout and 18% of lake_trout had empty stomachs in lake pend oreille, idaho (vidergar 2000), and the per cent of empty lake_trout stomachs varied from 19% to 70% among seasons in lake mcdonald, montana (dux 2005). the objective of this study was to evaluate trophic relationships between bull trout and lake_trout in lakes of gnp. relationships between ﬁsh length and d13c and ﬁsh length and d15n were examined among species and lakes to determine whether d15n and d13c were dependent on individual size and to evaluate the potential for ontogenetic trophic shifts. comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (anova) models to evaluate complete overlap in d15n and d13c values between bull trout and lake_trout. complete overlap in d15n and d13c values between bull trout and lake_trout would provide support for the hypoth- esis that these species are complete competitors for food resources (donald & alger 1993). methods study system the study system consisted of seven lakes located in gnp west of the continental divide (fig. 1). the selected lakes have sympatric populations of native bull trout and nonnative lake_trout and vary in species richness and composition (meeuwig et al. 2008). other native ﬁsh species present within the study system include cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus_clarkii), field methods gill net and hook and line surveys were conducted during the summer of 2005 in the seven study lakes. gill net surveys were also conducted during the summer of 2006 in quartz lake and lower quartz lake to increase sample sizes of target species. gill net surveys were conducted with sinking, experimental gill nets that were 38 m long, 2 m deep and constructed of multiﬁlament nylon with ﬁve panels: 19-, 25-, 32-, 38- and 51-mm bar mesh. the number of gill nets set varied among lakes according to scientiﬁc collection permit requirements, which allowed inci- dental mortality of £10 bull trout. hook and line surveys were conducted concurrently with gill net surveys. fish were anesthetized with 30 mgæl )1 clove oil (prince & powell 2000), identiﬁed to species, mea- sured for length (total length; mm) and released. a minimum of 100 individuals were measured if >100 individuals of a given species were sampled within a lake. a 14-gauge soft tissue biopsy needle (achieve soft tissue biopsy needle; cardinal health, mcgaw park, il, usa) was used to nonlethally extract a sample of white muscle (2 mm diameter by 15 mm long) from a subsample of ﬁsh at each lake for stable isotope analysis (d15n and d13c) prior to release. white muscle was selected as it exhibits lower within tissue variance in d13c than other tissues, such as red muscle, heart and liver and has been suggested as an appropriate tissue for examining trophic relationships among ﬁshes (pinnegar & polunin 1999). muscle samples were collected by inserting the needle into the dorsal musculature near the insertion of the dorsal ﬁn in a posterior to anterior direction. muscle samples were placed in a portable cryogenic freezer (model cx100; taylor wharton, theodore, al, usa) and transported to montana state university. sample storage capacity at the study sites was limited to 80 samples based on equipment limitations; therefore, subsampling was used to provide a repre- sentative sample of ﬁsh species present within each lake. fish were subsampled at each lake as follows: (i) up to 10 bull trout were sampled, (ii) up to 10 lake 317 meeuwig et al. trout were sampled and (iii) up to ﬁve individuals of each other ﬁsh species present were sampled. two sets of samples were collected from quartz lake, one in 2005 and one in 2006. these samples were pooled for analyses (see below for between year comparisons) resulting in a larger sample size for quartz lake. additionally, muscle samples were only collected from bull trout and lake_trout individuals large enough to be considered likely piscivores (i.e. ‡200 mm; mcphail & baxter 1996). a two-sample t-test (a = 0.05; proc ttest; sas institute 1989) was used to evaluate whether the mean length of individuals subsampled for stable isotope analysis was representative of the mean length of all individuals sampled by lake and species (table 1). the mean length of redside shiner differed between the subsample and the total sample of all individuals in bowman lake (t = 2.18, d.f. = 28, p = 0.038), lower quartz lake (t = 3.31, d.f. = 38, p = 0.002) and logging lake (t = 2.61, d.f. = 18, p = 0.018); prob- ability values for all other species by lake comparisons varied from 0.064 to 1.000. a two-sample t-test was used to compare the mean lengths of bull trout and lake_trout subsampled for stable isotope analysis by lake. mean lengths of bull trout and lake_trout did not differ within lakes with the exception of lower quartz lake (t = 6.52, d.f. = 11, p < 0.001); probability values for all other comparisons within lakes varied from 0.104 to 0.724. 318 fig. 1. location of seven lakes in glacier national park, montana, inhabited by sym- patric populations of native bull trout and nonnative lake_trout. laboratory methods muscle samples were dried for 48 h at 60 °c and ground to a ﬁne powder with a mortar and pestle (jardine et al. 2003). about 2–3 mg of the prepared sample was placed into a 4- by 6-mm tin capsule and shipped to south dakota state university (department of plant science, brookings, sd, usa) for stable isotope analysis using an europa anca-gsl 20-20 isotope d values were irms mass spectrometer. calculated following peterson & fry (1987). data analysis pearson product-moment correlations (proc corr; sas institute 1989) were calculated between ﬁsh length and d13c and between ﬁsh length and d15n for each species by lake to examine trends in d13c and d15n for the lengths of ﬁsh sampled. correlation analyses were performed when at least three individ- uals per species by lake were sampled, resulting in 50 species by lake correlation analyses for each of the isotopes examined. values for d13c and d15n were plotted against length when correlations were signif- icant (a = 0.05). an analysis of variance (anova) was used to examine differences in d15n among bull trout, lake_trout and all other sampled ﬁsh species combined (hereafter referred to as other ﬁshes) among lakes. table 1. lake, species, sample size (n) and length (total length;

therefore, a similar analysis was not performed for lake_trout. however, the range of d15n for the three lake_trout was less than that of bull trout and other ﬁshes. no trends were observed for deviation from normality for d15n (shapiro–wilk statistic; shapiro & wilk 1965), and experimental error variance of d15n did not differ among bull trout, lake_trout and all other ﬁshes combined within lakes based on a brown–forsythe test for homogeneity of variance (brown & forsythe 1974). the anova model used was a randomised complete block design with subsampling where lakes were treated as random blocks, the ﬁxed factor had three levels (bull trout, lake_trout and other ﬁshes), individual ﬁsh were treated as subsample units and ﬁsh length was included as a covariate to account for differences in d15n associated with ﬁsh length (a = 0.05; proc glm; sas institute 1989). blocking by lake was used to account for differences in d15n among lakes because primary consumers were not sampled to provide a way of standardising d15n among lakes (e.g. vander zanden & rasmussen 1999). there was no interaction between the random block and the ﬁxed factor showing that differences in d15n among levels of the ﬁxed factor were systematic among lakes. therefore, the randomised complete block design provided a valid method for standardising comparisons among d15n values of bull trout, lake_trout and other ﬁshes. preplanned comparisons were made to test the following predictions: (i) bull trout and lake_trout will have similar d15n values, (ii) bull trout will have greater d15n values relative to other ﬁshes and (iii) lake_trout will have greater d15n values relative to other ﬁshes. signiﬁcant differences in d15n between bull trout and lake_trout were used to infer incomplete overlap in d15n. a similar procedure was used to examine differences in d13c between bull trout and lake_trout among lakes. d13c did not differ between years for bull trout sampled from quartz lake (f1,17 = 0.16, p = 0.698). the range of d13c of the three lake_trout sampled from quartz lake was less than that of bull trout. no trends were observed for deviation from normality for d13c (shapiro–wilk statistic; shapiro & wilk 1965), and experimental error variance of d13c did not differ between bull trout and lake_trout within lakes based on a brown–forsythe test for homogeneity of variance (brown & forsythe 1974). preliminary analyses indicated an interaction between the random block (i.e. lake) and the two levels of the ﬁxed factor (i.e. bull trout and lake_trout). consequently, separate anova models were used to examine differ- ences in d13c between bull trout and lake_trout for each lake separately. signiﬁcant differences in d13c between bull trout and lake_trout were used to infer incomplete overlap in d13c. 320 results bull trout d13c values were generally greater than lake_trout d13c values among lakes with the exception of kintla lake, and d13c values of bull trout and lake_trout were generally intermediate within the distribu- tion of other ﬁshes sampled by lake (table 1). lake_trout d15n values were greater than bull trout d15n values among lakes, and d15n values of both bull trout and lake_trout were greater than d15n values of other ﬁshes among lakes (table 1). length and d13c were negatively correlated for bull trout in kintla lake, bowman lake, quartz lake and logging lake (fig. 2), cutthroat trout in lower quartz lake and harrison lake and lake whiteﬁsh in lake mcdonald (fig. 3). length and d15n were positively correlated for cutthroat trout and mountain whiteﬁsh in quartz lake, redside shiner in lower quartz lake and kokanee in lake mcdonald (fig. 4). lake_trout d15n was estimated to be 1.0& greater than bull trout d15n (f1,12 = 26.88, p = 0.001; fig. 5). lake_trout d15n was estimated to be 4.0& greater than d15n of other ﬁshes (f1,12 = 303.65, p < 0.001; fig. 5). bull trout d15n was estimated to be 3.0& than d15n of other ﬁshes (f1,12 = 268.91, greater p < 0.001; fig. 5). bull trout d13c was greater than lake_trout d13c in all lakes except kintla lake, where lake_trout d13c was greater; differences between bull trout d13c and lake_trout d13c were signiﬁcant in four of the seven lakes examined (fig. 6). discussion dietary overlap between bull trout and lake_trout has been suggested as a causal mechanism for the displacement of bull trout under conditions of limited food supply where the distribution of these species is sympatric (e.g. northern montana, south-western alberta and east-central british columbia; donald & alger 1993). analyses of d13c and d15n provide little evidence for complete trophic overlap between bull trout and lake_trout among lakes sampled in this study. however, data needed to determine whether food is limiting within this study system are unavailable (e.g. bull trout and lake_trout consumption estimates, prey species abundance and biomass, lake productivity). patterns observed in this study may be a consequence of diet shifts associated with colonisation by nonnative lake_trout. for example, lake_trout shifted from a largely littoral, ﬁsh-based diet to a largely pelagic, zooplankton-based diet following invasions by non- native smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu) and rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) in canadian lakes (vander zanden et al. 1999). this conclusion was based on a comparison between stable isotope anal- yses of invaded (bass present) and reference lakes trophic relationships between predators fig. 2. correlation between length and d13c for bull trout in kintla lake, bowman lake, quartz lake and logging lake, glacier national park, montana. trend lines were calculated using linear regression. (bass absent) and on long-term studies of two invaded lakes (vander zanden et al. 1999). it is difﬁcult to determine whether the d13c and d15n values observed for bull trout among lakes in gnp are a result of diet shifts associated with colonisation by nonnative lake_trout. lakes in gnp that have not been colonised by nonnative lake_trout are more depauperate in ﬁsh species richness (meeu- wig et al. 2008), and bull trout food habits often differ among lakes with different species assemblages (e.g. leathe & graham 1982; donald & alger 1993; dalbey et al. 1998; wilhelm et al. 1999; vidergar 2000; beauchamp & van tassell 2001; clarke et al. 2005). therefore, these lakes would be poor references as the inﬂuence of species assemblage could not be controlled. bull trout and lake_trout have been shown to be generalist and opportunistic predators in many studies. the diet of bull trout in lake billy chinook, oregon, was variable seasonally and among size classes, and included kokanee, bull rainbow trout (o. mykiss), mountain whiteﬁsh, other salmonids, trout, cottids, catostomids cyprinids, and invertebrates (beauchamp & van tassell 2001). bull trout predation on three aquatic invertebrates in harrison lake, alberta, varied seasonally and was similar to the seasonal abundance of the prey species (wilhelm et al. 1999). bull trout and lake_trout fed on a wide range of available taxa, including aquatic and aerial insects and ﬁshes in lakes varying in trophic complexity in northern montana, south-western alberta and east- central british columbia; however, when present, ﬁsh composed the majority of bull trout and lake_trout diets (donald & alger 1993). dietary differences were observed between small (i.e. 177–406 mm) and large (i.e. >406 mm) lake_trout in lac la ronge, saskatch- ewan, where small lake_trout fed on invertebrates (especially mysis relicta), ciscoes (coregonus zenithi- cus and coregonus_artedi), sculpins (myoxocephalus thompsonii and c. cognatus) and ninespine stickle- backs (pungitius pungitius) and large lake_trout fed on ciscoes, lake whiteﬁsh, ninespine stickleback, long- nose sucker, yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), sculpins, burbot (lota lota), walleye (sander vitreum), spottail 321 meeuwig et al. fig. 3. correlation between length and d13c for cutthroat trout in lower quartz lake, lake whiteﬁsh in lake mcdonald and cutthroat in harrison lake, glacier national park, montana. trend lines were calculated using linear regression. trout in noninvaded lakes (lake_trout d13c = )27.5&) and a greater dependence on pelagic prey in invaded lakes (lake_trout d13c = )29.2&). among the study lakes where bull trout d13c values were greater than those of lake_trout, mean differences varied from 1.17& to 3.28& (see table 1). therefore, the observed trends are suggestive of bull trout foraging in littoral habitat more than lake_trout and of bull trout shifting from foraging in littoral habitat to foraging in pelagic or profundal habitat as they increase in length. similarly, bull trout have been observed to be spatially segregated based on size in harrison lake, alberta, with smaller bull trout (i.e. £250 mm fork length) observed in shallow water (i.e. <1 m) and larger bull trout observed in the profundal offshore waters (wilhelm et al. 1999). however, additional information is necessary to determine whether there are differences in baseline d13c values between littoral and pelagic habitat within gnp lakes (e.g. see vander zanden & rasmussen 1999). lake_trout had greater d15n values relative to bull trout among lakes. this may be the result of consum- ing different prey species or similar prey species in different proportions, but the possibility that lake_trout are receiving some dietary contribution from bull trout should not be disregarded. lake_trout can consume prey ﬁsh with lengths about 50% their own length (ruzycki 2004). therefore, it is possible that bull trout are contributing to the diet of lake_trout even within the size range of individuals examined in this study. minnow (notropis hudsonius), lake_trout and small numbers of invertebrates (<11% of diet; rawson 1961). lake_trout in algonquin park, ontario, may feed on ﬁshes or plankton, depending on their availability (martin 1966). lake_trout diet varied with habitat (i.e. nearshore and offshore) and was related to prey abundance in lake michigan (miller & holey 1992). these studies suggest that differences in d13c and d15n between bull trout and lake_trout in gnp could result from partitioning of prey resources associated with species-speciﬁc habitat use and prey availability rather than from diet shifts. in six of the seven lakes examined in this study, the average bull trout d13c value was greater than the average lake_trout d13c value (signiﬁcantly greater in three of the seven lakes), and in four of the seven lakes, there was a negative relationship between bull trout length and d13c. studies have shown that d13c of littoral consumers in lakes is often greater than d13c of pelagic or profundal consumers as a result of a benthic algae d13c being greater than d13c of planktonic algae (france 1995; hecky & hesslein 1995; vander zanden & rasmussen 1999). for example, d13c of primary consumers was )23.8& in littoral area, )28.4& in pelagic areas and )30.5& in profundal areas among 14 lakes in ontario, quebec (vander zanden & rasmussen 1999), and a mean difference of 1.7& between d13c values for lake_trout in bass invaded lakes and noninvaded lakes was used to infer greater dependence on littoral prey 322 trophic relationships between predators trout fig. 4. correlation between length and d15n for cutthroat in quartz lake, mountain whiteﬁsh in quartz lake, redside shiner in lower quartz lake and kokanee in lake mcdonald, glacier national park, montana. trend lines were calculated using linear regression. the length of the smallest bull for example, trout sampled in this study was <50% the length of the largest lake_trout sampled within lakes with the exceptions of quartz lake and lake mcdonald. this study shows that bull trout and lake_trout have greater d15n values than other ﬁshes in gnp lakes. this suggests that these species are top-level predators and indicates the potential for competition for prey resources; however, these species differed in levels of naturally occurring stable isotopes commonly used to examine trophic relationships (martı´nez del rio et al. 2009). differences between these species in d13c in the majority of lakes examined and d15n among lakes may be the result of consuming different species or different proportions of similar species. therefore, there is little evidence for complete trophic overlap between bull trout and lake_trout in gnp, which has been suggested as a causal mechanism for population- level declines and extirpation of bull trout following the introduction of lake_trout (donald & alger 1993). however, the magnitude of difference in trophic characteristics required for bull trout and lake_trout fig. 5. mean (±standard error) d15n of bull trout, lake_trout and other ﬁshes among

they were to other species within lakes therefore, some level of competition for food resources between these species is likely. this study did not evaluate trophic overlap between bull trout and lake_trout <200 mm so it is unknown if competition for food resources at earlier life stages may result in exclusion of bull trout. additionally, implicit in this ‘competitive exclusion’ hypothesis is the requirement of limited food supply. no data are available with respect to food abundance or consumption rates of bull trout and lake_trout within gnp. resources may be sufﬁcient to allow partitioning of prey between two top-level predators within gnp. additional research such as quantitative gut content analyses, bioenerget- ics modelling, and abundance and biomass estimates for predator and prey species to complement stable isotope data will help elucidate whether population- level declines in bull trout are likely to occur as a result of diet overlap with lake_trout. additionally, future stable isotope analyses should evaluate bull trout and lake_trout <200 mm and examine habitat- speciﬁc, baseline isotopic values within lakes of gnp to provide a ﬁner-scale analysis of trophic relation- ships and foraging habitat use among ﬁshes. acknowledgements funding for this project was provided by the us geological survey, us fish and wildlife service and us
