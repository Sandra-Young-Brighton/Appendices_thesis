wanzenbo¨ck et al. 2003; coll et al. 2007; guillard et al. 2006b; mehner et al. 2007), dams (djemali et al. 2009; tuser et al. 2009), rivers (hughes 1998; kubecka & duncan 1998; matveev 2007), estuaries (guillard et al. 2004) and lagoon channels (brehmer et al. 2006b). hydroa- coustic assessment using echosounding with the acoustic beam pointing straight down is the most commonly method (simmonds & maclennan 2005). in the last few years, it has been used for behavioural and ecosystem studies in both marine and freshwater environments (e.g., winﬁeld et al. 2002; guillard et al. 2006a; mehner 2006; schmidt & gassner 2006; ceˆch et al. 2007). fish behaviour for both aquatic ecosystem research and monitoring, because of its is important impact on the results of ﬁsh stock assessments and ecosystem studies (fre´on & misund 1999). only a few studies have been carried out in freshwater ecosystems (drastik & kubecka 2005), although the consequences for stock estimations are similar to those observed in marine environments. the behaviour of ﬁsh schools in front of ships is not known in lacustrine ecosystems. the impact of a boat on a school can be described in terms of the change in the morphological parameters of the school (gerlotto et al. 2004; brehmer 2004), and thus sometimes in its volume, and which usually occurs just below the surface (0–20 m) (fre´on et al. 1992). this can be observed even with a small boat (brehmer et al. 2003), like those used for acoustic surveys of lakes. during september 2004, a multibeam sonar was deployed in the lake annecy to determine the 3-d structures of young-of-the-year (y-o-y) ﬁsh schools (guillard et al. 2006a), and an echosounder with the acoustic beam pointing straight down was used simultaneously. in this study, we ﬁrst investigated doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00419.x 373 guillard et al. whether we could observe differences in school volume between the schools which were located directly under the boat, and those located elsewhere is an indication of behavioural differences. secondly, we compared ﬁsh school parameters recorded simul- taneously by both acoustic devices to study the effects on ﬁsh schools located right under the boat, where both devices covered the same sampling volume. as small pelagic ﬁsh stock assessment is based on hydroacoustic surveys using a echosounder alone, it is important to know whether the data recorded using this device are biased or not. this experiment was intended to help us to evaluate a potential bias (hjellvik et al. 2008; patel & ona 2009) resulting from disturbances caused by the survey boat, and from the partial presentation provided by the echosounder, due to its small sampling volume. the study area the experiments were carried out on lake annecy from 13 to 17 september, 2004. lake annecy is one of the main alpine lakes in france (fig. 1), situated at an altitude of 446 m; it is a monomictic lake of glacial origin classiﬁed as oligotrophic. it has a maximum depth of 65 m, is 13.7 km long, and has a maximum width of 3.1 km. the lake is divided into two basins, and has a total area of 24.5 km2 (fig. 1). during the surveys, the lake was thermally structured with a marked thermocline (fig. 2) between 14 and 23 m (guillard et al. 2006a). in lake annecy, as in other large alpine lakes, the spring recruitment of cyprin- idae, such as roach (rutilus rutilus), and percidae, such as perch (perca ﬂuviatilis), can be very high in some years, and gives rise to very strong cohorts of 51° 3° 0° 3° 6° 48°48 45° 1 3 kkm temperature (°c) 5 10 15 20 25 10 20 30 ) m ( h t p e 40 50d 60 70 fig. 2. temperature proﬁle observed in the study area at the time of our experiment, showing a strong thermocline. these yoy ﬁsh. these ﬁsh live in school structures (partridge 1982) above the thermocline during the daytime, and disperse at sunset to feed (masson et al. 2001), from june to mid-autumn. materials and methods the acoustic survey and ﬁsh sampling the acoustic survey carried out from a small craft, the ‘antares’ (6.4 m), was conducted across six succes- )1, sive transects (fig. 1) at a mean speed of 6 km h and provided records of more than 400 sonar sequences including schools, over a period of about 4 h during the daytime on september 14, 2004 (table 1). fish samples were collected at night with a pelagic trawl (guillard & gerdeaux 1993) in areas where schools were detected during daytime. no ﬁsh were caught with the trawl during daytime, despite repeated attempts. multibeam sonar characteristics we employed a reson seabat 6012 multibeam sonar operated at a frequency of 455 khz (soria et al. 1996; nøttestad & axelsen 1999). we have introduced the temperature proﬁle measured in situ (fig. 2) in the bellhop ray trace programme (defence research and development canada): there is no signiﬁcant impact on the course of the direct rays in such environment. the sonar was pole-mounted on the side of the boat, table 1. number of ﬁsh schools recorded by the echosounder simard ey500 and the sonar reson seabat 6012 during the survey. distance from the boat simrad ey500 reson seabat 6012 fig. 1. the position of lake annecy on a map of france, and a zoom on the map of the lake with the survey tracks carried out on september 14, 2004. the dot indicates the localization of the temperature proﬁle. under the boat : 0–1 m 1–10 m 10–20 m 20–50 m 251 – – – 94 95 101 98 374 and the transducer submerged to a depth of 1 m during the survey (gerlotto et al. 1999; brehmer et al. 2003). the 60 beams (each single beam of 1.5° · 17°) provided a 90° observation plane, oriented perpendic- ular to the bottom and parallel to the surface. the acoustic system parameters were time-varied-gain (tvg function) 20 log r, pulse length 0.06 ms, and set to a maximum range of 50 m. the data storage precision was 8 bits, there were 1024 samples per beam for the 50-m range, and each sample corre- sponded to a distance of 4.9 cm, which was the resolution of the sonar images obtained. our equip- ment was calibrated during the european avitis program against a standard target (gerlotto et al. 2001) and since has been checked several times by the manufacturer, we can assume no device drift. we extracted 388 ﬁsh schools using ‘sbiviewer 5.01’ software digital video analysis (gerlotto et al. 1999). only sequences including clearly-identiﬁable schools (i.e., without noise or bottom interference) were used. this made it impossible for us to compare the number of schools observed by the acoustic devices, or carry out an analysis of the number of ﬁsh schools detected in terms of their distance from the boat, as was done by soria et al. (1996). data processing allowed us to obtain ﬁve descriptors for each of the ﬁsh schools analysed: (length, height, width, volume), and one energy descriptor (gerlotto et al. 1999). these descriptors were extracted from the whole school (gerlotto et al. 2001), except for the schools detected directly under the boat of which only part could be seen. backscat- tered energy from the sonar unit is expressed in relative units. four morphological descriptors split-beam echosounder characteristics a simrad ey500, split-beam, 70 khz frequency echosounder, was ﬁxed pole mounted to the side of the boat, close to the reson sonar, 0.6 m beneath the surface and vertically oriented. the transducer was circular, with a total beam angle of 11° at –3 db. as a result, the volume sounded by this vertical device was limited, particularly in the layer near the surface, so that only a fraction of the school was observed. the pulse length was 0.3 ms, with a pulse repetition rate of 5 ⁄ s. noise thresholds were set at –55 db (guillard et al. 2006b) for the analysis, using a tvg function of 20 log r, to focus on high packing density school characteristics of pelagic ﬁsh structure and to ﬁt with sonar ﬁsh school descriptor algorithm (gerlotto et al. 2001) which works on such kind of dense pelagic structure but not on the scattered ones. we have to notice that the sonar produce interferences on the echogram, nevertheless these interferences were very low and do to not bias signiﬁcantly the morphological boat effect on freshwater schools and energetic descriptors. before the ﬁrst survey was carried out, the echosounder was calibrated in a large tank (100 m long, 25 m depth) according to the standard protocol recommended by foote et al. (1987), which was also carried out just before the survey itself. echosounder data was computed using ‘movies+6.1’ software (weill et al. 1993; diner 2001), which like the sonar data, provided the descriptors corresponding to the ﬁsh school morphol- ogy (length, height, width, volume) and the energy descriptors. in the case of schools occurring only between the surface and the thermocline (guillard et al. 2006b), i.e., at a mean depth of around 9 m, the only echosounder parameters used were the height and the mean energy. the estimated width of the school, and thus its volume, are obviously biased at this depth, due to the very narrow volume sampled, less than 2 m wide at a depth of 15 m as calculated from the echosounder characteristics. in a previous paper, guillard et al. (2006b) showed that during this period, the schools had a mean width of more than 4 m. acoustic data analysis of ﬁsh schools the morphological descriptors obtained using the sonar equipment correspond to those of the whole school (gerlotto et al. 1999), except for those of the schools detected right under the boat, which could be partially observed. the morphological parameters of ﬁsh schools provided by the sonar were analysed using pearson’s correlation table to check the correlations between them. we then divided the sonar data into four classes according to the horizontal distance between the boat and the detected school: the ﬁrst class contained the schools observed directly under the boat (0 m), the second to those observed from an the third to those horizontal distance of 1–10 m, observed from 10 to 20 m, and the last to those observed from 20 to 50 m (fig. 3). for this ﬁnal class, data from the 20–30, 30–40 and 40–50 m classes was pooled to provide sufﬁcient data to allow us to perform statistical tests; indeed for this last group of classes, most of the schools could not be extracted by the software due to interferences from surface and bottom noise. to compare the sonar and echosounder data, we deﬁned two classes: (i) the ﬁsh schools observed under the boat and (ii) the ﬁsh schools seen at least 1 m from the boat. comparisons were performed using non-parametric tests: mann– whitney and kruskal–wallis with dunn’s post hoc procedure and bonferroni’s correction. a transforma- tion of the energy parameters into a relative scale from 1 to 100, done in the linear domain, was performed for both echosounder and sonar data, to enable us to compare them. 375 guillard et al. results more than one thousand ﬁsh, belonging to the two species and identiﬁed asyoy, were caught on 14 september in ﬁve trawls: perch (n = 657, mean total length = 61.9 mm, standard deviation = 4.7 mm) and roach (n = 348, mean total length = 65.5 mm, stan- dard deviation = 8.5 mm). the four morphological descriptors of ﬁsh schools delivered by the multibeam sonar were signiﬁcantly correlated (table 2). we chose to carry out our analysis using the main descriptor, the volume, which is the most pertinent because it embodies all the others. the volumes of the schools under the boat recorded by the sonar were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) the schools classes (fig. 4). the volumes of the schools in these latter classes did not differ signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) from each other, whereas those recorded under the boat recorded in the other distance than those for larger 376 fig. 3. sketch of the behaviour pattern of ﬁsh schools under our boat: the ﬁsh school ﬂees from the craft, in a direction which has both vertical and horizontal components, with the thermocline acting as a barrier restricting vertical movements. the narrow- ness of the echosounder beam (11°) means that only part of the school is detected, which can generate erroneous measurements of ﬁsh school descriptors. were different from each others. the mean height (n = 94, mean = 10.71, standard deviation = 0.53) of the schools detected under the boat by the multibeam sonar was signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) greater than that (n = 294, mean = 7.76 m, standard deviation = 0.23) of the schools detected by the sonar alongside the boat, i.e., at distances from 1 to 50 m (fig. 4). the mean height of the schools estimated using sonar was three detected times greater those than that of table 2. the pearson correlation table of ﬁsh school morphological descriptors as recorded by the sonar (*p-values < 0.001): all the descriptors are closely correlated with one another. variable length width height volume length – 0.818* 0.628* 0.731* width – – 0.810* 0.676* height – – – 0.569* ) 3 m ( e m u o v l l o o h c s 1000 600 200 0 [1–10] [10–20] [20–50] distance from the boat (m) fig. 4. box-plots (minimum, maximum, quartiles and median) of the school volumes measured according to the distance from the boat in terms of four classes of distance from the boat (i.e. from the transducer): [0-1] (n = 94);

10], [10; 20] and [20; 50]). in lake annecy, therefore, our boat did have an impact on the schools: their morphological descriptors changed when the boat was vertically above them. the schools located under the boat reacted to it, and were reported by the sonar device as being larger than those located further away. vertical compression of the ﬁsh school under the boat the ﬁsh schools recorded by the the heights of echosounder were signiﬁcantly lower than those observed by sonar (fig. 5). this was particularly marked when we looked at the schools observed under the boat. for the schools recorded under the boat, this was unexpected, because the same schools were in fact being observed by both devices simultaneously. this difference was due to the volume detected by the devices: the echosounder, with the acoustic beam pointing straight down, was observing only a small part of the school, whereas the height measured by the sonar corresponded to the mean height of the entire school. obviously, the echosounder pro- vided only a partial presentation (brehmer 2004) of the schools detected, as the volume sampled was limited to a narrow (11°) vertical plane below the transducer. the school size assessment collected using the echosounder in the lake was consequently biased, as could be expected by the result of gerlotto et al. (1999). the estimated height of the schools detected therefore, 377 guillard et al. by the echosounder under the boat was always lower than the mean value for the whole school, as reported in marine environment (fre´on et al. 1992; jørgensen et al. 2004). for these schools, the mean value of the energy descriptor recorded by the echosounder was greater than the mean energy detected by the sonar for the whole school (fig. 6). the part of the school located just under the ship appears to be a concentrated area within the school: less high and with greater energy, corresponding to a reduction of the nearest neighbour distance (partridge 1982) between the individual ﬁsh inside the school. the descriptors recorded by the echosounder are therefore biased, because they relate to only a small part of the school, which appears to be very unrepresentative of the whole school in terms of height and energy (fig. 3). explanation of ﬁsh school behavioural response to the survey boat in this study, we have shown that there is a change in the behaviour of ﬁsh which could be due to the noise sound pressure and ⁄ or visual disturbance produced by boats or by other indeterminate parameters, as has already been reported in other ecosystems, mainly marine ones (brehmer et al. 2000). school avoidance usually occurs in both the horizontal and vertical planes (olsen et al. 1983; misund et al. 1998; misund & coetzee 2000). using multibeam sonar observation, soria et al. (1996) found signiﬁcant vessel avoidance by schools: ﬁsh ﬂed away from the source of distur- bance either by diving under the hull or by escaping sideways. as the result of shadowing from the hull, the noise emission pattern (i.e., boat diagram sound pressure) is lowest directly in front of the vessel (urick 1975), and schools may therefore tend to concentrate in this area as suspected by gerlotto & fre´on (1988), a phenomenon that has been conﬁrmed and designated ‘the guiding effect’ by misund & aglen (1992). soria et al. (2003) assumed that under shallow water condi- tions and the environmental constraints related to the vertical distribution of temperature, the vertical move- ment of ﬁsh is restricted. they also assumed that disturbance constraints induce a stretching of the school in the ﬁeld of the lowest disturbance gradient. this effect can be ampliﬁed by vertical restrictions, such as the depth of the halocline and ⁄ or of the thermocline, which could act like horizontal fences. during our experiments, lake annecy had a marked thermocline between 14 and 23 m (fig. 2). guillard et al. (2006b) have shown that the depth of ﬁsh schools is signiﬁcantly correlated with the depth of the thermocline, as they are always located above it. thus, schools diving under the boat hull to escape noise disturbances might be confronted by this thermal barrier, leading to increased lateral movements 378 (fig. 3) in their attempts to escape from the boat, as has already been shown in other ecosystems (brehmer et al. 2000). in this case, the enhanced school volume under the boat, vs. the volume of distant schools, is attributable to lateral movements by the ﬁsh seeking to avoid the disturbance (fig. 3). all the previous studies on ﬁsh school had been carried out in ﬁshed marine areas. brehmer & gerlotto (2001) reported differences in behaviour by the same species of small pelagic ﬁsh school in ﬁshed and un-ﬁshed areas (implementation of ﬁsh learning process). lake annecy is not an actively- ﬁshed area (ﬁshing is carried out only using passive gear, and by non-commercial anglers), and so may differ from the usual marine environment where the ﬁsh are likely to have been inﬂuenced by the stress generated by the ﬁshing experiment. above a certain threshold of disturbance, the cohesion of a school cannot be maintained, and it may split up (soria et al. 2003), leading to many smaller schools. that could explain why schools that are far away from the boat have a smaller mean volume that those detected by the sounder underneath the boat (fig. 4). that fish stock assessment is usually carried out using descriptors measured using a standalone echosounder. in this work we have highlighted the fact in lacustrine ecosystems, boats can modify ﬁsh school behaviour, and therefore interfere with stock assess- ments carried out during the daytime using an echosounder, resulting in bias. this phenomenon, which has already been reported for schools of small pelagic marine ﬁsh (e.g., olsen et al. 1983; soria et al. 1996; misund & coetzee 2000; gerlotto et al. 2004), must therefore also occur in our freshwater ecosystem. using a horizontal guided sonar is an attractive way to record ﬁsh near to the surface in situations where conventional echo integration fails due to boat avoid- ance or a distribution range located above the transducer depth, as shown by misund & coetzee (2000) or brehmer et al. (2000). using a multibeam echosounder can also help to avoid the problems linked to vessel-related disturbances, and in our case study actually yielded a more accurate value for the school height. the simrad ms70 (patel & ona 2009), a sideways-looking sonar designed for looking at surface-oriented ﬁsh schools, or the new simrad me70 multibeam echosounder (doray et al. 2009) will provide better accuracy for the assessment of small pelagic ﬁsh stock. the me70 needs an opening angle of 180° rather than 140°, i.e., one that includes the sea surface, where it the avoidance reaction is strongest. nevertheless this kind of new echosounder technology (as the ms70) cannot yet be on-board small survey boat used in freshwater lakes. thus the use of two multibeam sonars in vertical beaming, similar to the one we used in our study and positioned at the bow of the boat, appears to be the is suspected that best way to improve our knowledge of the behaviour of freshwater small pelagic ﬁsh schools, and thus enhance the quality of ﬁsh stock assessments. acknowledgements this work was performed during the anson project (inra, ird, to the ‘crh’ centre de and ifremer). we are grateful recherche
