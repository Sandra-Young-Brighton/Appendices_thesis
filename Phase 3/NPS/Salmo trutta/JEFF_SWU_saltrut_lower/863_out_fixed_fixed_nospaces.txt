fig. 1) of the mekong river (tonle sap in cambodia and mun river in thailand). an additional sample was collected from the neighbouring chao phraya river drainage for the purposes of placing patterns of genetic differentiation within the mrb into context. finclips were taken from the anal or caudal ﬁn of each individual and samples stored in 70% ethanol to brisbane, australia for genetic analyses. all ﬁsh were collected either directly from ﬁsherpersons on the river or from local markets located on or near selected sample sites. at the time of collection, all ﬁsh were conﬁrmed to originate from or near adjacent areas of the river. to target only resident ﬁsh, collections were restricted to times when migratory activity was minimal to avoid sampling migrating individuals. while the objective was to collect at least 15–20 individuals per sampling site, due to presence of other morphologically cryptic cyprinids, and local scarcity in some places during the dry season, sample numbers at some sites were less than ideal. dna extraction, pcr and sequencing total genomic dna was extracted using a standard salt extraction protocol modiﬁed from miller et al. (1988). a complete fragment of the mitochondrial atp synthase subunit 6 and 8 genes were ampliﬁed using the following pcr protocol. primers atp8.2 l (5¢<aaa gcr tyr gcc ttt taa gc> 3¢) and coiii.2h (5¢<gtt agt ggt cak ggg ctt ggr tc>3¢) (e.bermingham at http://nmg.sci.edu/bermlab. htm) were used initially to amplify a 950-bp fragment that included a seven-base overlap between the two genes. a new 18mer oligo-nucleotide primer was then designed (heni-atp6; 5¢<gtt ggc tgt gag tcg tac>3¢) internal to coiii.2 to reduce the fragment size to 630bp that was used in all subsequent analyses. pcr reactions contained 30 nmol each of datp, dgtp, dctp and dttp (roche), 2 units of taq dna polymerase (roche), 2.5 mmol mgcl2, 5 ll of 10 · polymerase reaction buffer (roche), 1.0 lmol of each primer, 0.2 lg of template dna, 1.0 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) and adjusted to a ﬁnal genetic structure of h. lobatus volume of 50 ll with ddh2o. dna was initially denatured at 95 °c for 5 min, then 35 cycles of 95 °c denaturing for 30 s, 50 °c annealing for 30 s and 72 °c extension for 45 s, followed by a ﬁnal extension period of 3 min at 68 °c. all individuals were sequenced using the light strand primer (atp8.2l) only, while 12 unique haplotypes were sequenced for both strands to verify correct ampliﬁcation of the gene fragment. dna sequencing was undertaken at the australian genome research facility, brisbane, aus- tralia, using an abi 377 automated sequencer. data analysis sequences (p)]. as for comparative purposes, several measures of genetic variation were calculated for the atpase gene frag- ment for each sample site. methods included haplo- typic diversity (hd) (nei 1987), and three estimates of h (h = 2 nl for haploid data, where n is the population size and l is the mutation rate): (1) hp to nucleotide diversity (p), (2) hs which is equal estimated from the number of segregating (polymor- phic) sites (s) and (3) hk estimated from ewen’s sampling distribution (ewens 1972) based on the number of haplotypes (k) in the sample. estimates of h were also used to test the dna fragment for deviations from neutral expectations (i.e., mutation ⁄ drift and ⁄ or gene ﬂow ⁄ drift equilibrium) for each sample using two methods. the ﬁrst test was tajima’s d (tajima 1989) that assumes that heterozygosity (h) estimated from the number of polymorphic nucleotide sites in the sample (s) should equal h estimated from nucle- otide diversity [the average pairwise difference among all slightly deleterious (and hence rare) alleles will inﬂate hs but not inﬂuence hp signiﬁcantly, this test is particularly sensitive to deviations from neutrality due to selection [a positive value indicates balancing selection while a negative value supports the hypothesis of a selective sweep (rand 1996)]. the second test was fu’s fs (fu 1997), which is based on the comparison between hk and hp. this method is sensitive to deviations from equilibrium as a result of demographic instability, where a high number of singleton mutations resulting from a recent and rapid population expansion will lead to an increase in hk but not in hp (fu 1997; ramos- onsins & rozas 2002). both tests were performed using arlequin version 3.1 (excofﬁer et al. 2005) with signiﬁcant deviations from neutral expectations determined using (1) a nonparametric permutation process in arlequin and (2) a coalescent simulation approach performed in dnasp version 4.10.8 (rozas et al. 2003) both incorporating 1000 iterations for each test. sequential bonferroni corrections (rice 1989) for multiple each method. comparisons were performed for the presence of 275 hurwood et al. relationships among all unique mtdna geno- types (haplotypes) were estimated using two meth- ods. first, a neighbour-joining tree (saito & nei 1987) was constructed in the program mega version 3.1 (kumar et al. 2004) using the corrected distance model of tamura & nei (1993) with a gamma-shape parameter of 0.3695 estimated with the likelihood method in the modeltest program version 3.06 (posada & crandall 1998) in conjunction with paup* version 4.0 b10 (swofford 2002). the tree was rooted using two sequences from congeneric h. siamensis individuals (this study), one from the mekong river and the other from the mae klong river in thailand, a drainage that is geographically isolated from the mrb. sequence for another cyprinid outgroup (carassius carassius) was sourced from genbank (accession number nc006291) (guo et al. 2007). for the second method, a parsimony constructed using tcs haplotype network was program version 1.21 (clement et al. 2000) that gives a representation of the level of divergence among unique haplotypes and their evolutionary connections, particularly within shallow clades. allelic signiﬁcant population structure was investigated in two ways. firstly, a pairwise exact test of population differen- tiation (raymond & rousset 1995) was used to detect frequency heterogeneity among sites. this is a ‘whole of table’ test that estimates the probability of observing a table (i.e., a allelic heterogeneity values matrix of pairwise among samples) likely than the observed conﬁguration under the null hypothesis of panmixia. the signiﬁcance of the test (i.e., the p value) is the proportion of the probability of no association recorded from the simulated contingency tables to the probability estimated from the original table. standard errors about the p-value were calculated by running 1000 tests (batches). than or equal times less less that is and that et al. (1992) partitions the second method for estimating geographical structure of the samples used here involved the spatial analysis of molecular variance using the program samova (dupanloup et al. 2002). this method uses the ﬁxation indices (f statistics) of excofﬁer genetic frequency variation (based on both haplotypic differences among haplotypes) within and among groups of sampling sites. standard analysis of molecular variance (amova; excofﬁer et al. 1992), however, requires some a priori knowledge of the spatial groupings to be tested, whereas samova analysis uses a simulated annealing approach that incorporates geographical information of the sampling sites and attempts to maximise the proportion of total genetic variation (fct), while among populations divergence sequence groups

simultaneously minimising the portion of variation among sites within groups (fsc). f values were calculated by running the program sequentially and forcing the data into k groups (where k = 2 to 7). not only does this method reveal groupings of samples that have some biological meaning, but it can also identify barriers to dispersal where they exist (dupanloup et al. 2002). the across signiﬁcance constrained gene ﬂow, to determine whether physical distance within the mekong river isolation by distance (ibd) among sampled sites was tested for sampling range of h. lobatus (excluding the chao phraya sample and mun river sites). for this analysis, a mantel test (mantel 1967) was performed in arlequin. this test was used to estimate the signiﬁcance of the correlation between pairwise genetic distance among sampling sites using slatkin’s linearised fst (slatkin 1995) and log10 stream distance among sites. a pattern of ibd would be supported by a positive correlation between genetic differentiation and geo- graphical distance. the incorporated 1000 permutations. test c l a d e a  hap2 hap3 hap4 hap6 hap5 hap1 hap8 hap9 hap7 hap10 100 hap11 hap18 hap23 hap24 hap22 hap20 hap19

sequences were submitted to genbank with accession numbers eu164814-eu164844. the resulting neighbour-join- ing tree and parsimony network (figs 2 and 3) clearly show three distinct groups of closely related haplo- types (clades a–c) with signiﬁcant levels of diver- gence evident among them. estimates of genetic diversity for each sampled site are given in table 3. haplotypic diversity ranged from genetic structure of h. lobatus the site in the chao phraya river low at nongkhai (nk; hd = 0.1429) to relatively high for (ch; hd = 0.9643). this pattern is largely reﬂected in the estimates of h except for site mc, where both hp and hs were larger than all others. this most likely resulted from the detection of a single hap12 individ- ual at site mc that has greatly increased both nucleotide diversity (p) and number of polymorphic sites (s). deviations from neutral expectations no pattern was detected for signiﬁcant deviations from neutral expectations (table 3). tonle sap lake (ts) was the only site that did not conform to neutral expectations for both the methods employed here, although signiﬁcance was determined by a coalescent method for tajima’s d and the permutation method for fu’s fs. while there was no consistent pattern either among sites or for multiple methods used to detect nonequilibrium, it is interesting to note that all but one value were negative. for d, this is usually considered to indicate occurrence of a selective sweep (tajima 1989) but is also consistent with a population bottle- neck (rand 1996). negative values for fs suggest background selection but are also a good indication of recent demographic ﬂuctuations (fu 1997; ray et al. 2003) usually associated with population expansions. while these two interpretations of the data may at ﬁrst appear contradictory, rogers (1995) explained how a population bottleneck and an expansion can leave similar signatures in population sequence data (i.e., more low frequency haplotypes than would be expected under neutral mutation). population structure the exact test of population differentiation revealed a high degree of structure both among river drainages and within the mekong river itself (table 4). the samples from the chainard (ch) site in the chao phraya river drainage were genetically divergent from all mekong river sites (figs 2 and 3, table 2). this pattern is reﬂected in the results of the exact test (table 4) with respect to ch, although only four of the mekong river sites (bp, sm, mk and st) displayed frequency heterogeneity with ch after bonferroni correction. an equivalent degree of divergence was detected between sites in the mun river (a tributary of the mekong river) and all other sites in the rest of the sampled range in the mrb (figs 2 and 3). apart from the existence of hap12 at site mc, the population structure reﬂects the clade structure seen in figs 2 and 3. that is, clade a was found exclusively in the mun river while clade b was restricted to the remaining sampled sites in the mekong river. 277 hurwood et al. circle size between fig. 3. parsimony network showing the relationship among haplotypes for h. loba- tus (95% parsimonious connections). haplo-

differentiation (95.729%) among groups was evident when k = 4. in this case, chainard in the chao phraya (ch) and both mc and ub sites in the mun river represented discrete groups (groups 1–3, respectively) a result that was largely consistent with results of the exact test, although differentiation between ub and mc becomes nonsig- niﬁcant after bonferroni correction. the fourth group was made up of all remaining sample sites in the mekong (group 4). it should be noted, however, that in the samova analysis the fct values for k = 3 and k = 5 were of the same order as seen for four groups (95.726% and 95.711%, respectively). the difference was for k = 3, mun river sites are grouped together and for k = 5, the bp site was removed from the main group and formed a group on its own. while selecting between these alternative groupings was difﬁcult, levels of differentiation among sites within groups (fsc) dropped from 10.4% for k = 3 to 2.5% for k = 4 then essentially to zero for k = 5. this suggests that the group identiﬁed with k = 5 from the mekong river (i.e., all sites excluding mun river and bp sites) represented a single panmictic population. certainly, the exact test suggested that bp was signiﬁcantly differentiated from all other mekong river sites (except for sm and mk after bonferroni correction). whether a substantial instream barrier to gene ﬂow exists between site bp and other mekong river sites is difﬁcult to determine from these data. a signiﬁcant correlation for the mantel test (0.5866; p = 0.031) between genetic distance and stream distance suggests a signature of ibd among sites identiﬁed as a single group in the samova analysis (k = 4). when bp was (k = 5), removed from the analysis, however the (r = 0.0394, pattern was p = 0.387) indicating that there was no general pattern of ibd present among the majority of mekong river sites and therefore gene ﬂow was possibly constrained in this part of the river only. evident longer no discussion delimiting obligate freshwater species can often be problematic because boundaries population in genetic structure of h. lobatus potential barriers to gene ﬂow may exist in riverine systems. while h. lobatus has been little studied in the lower mrb, there is a general perception that its population structure is likely to be complex (poulsen et al. 2004). this view came from recognition that migratory behaviour may vary among regions within the mrb and as a consequence of the vast distances involved (over 2000 km in the lower mrb alone). however, even given what is known about characteristics of freshwater environments in general and the speciﬁc life history traits of the target species, the pattern of genetic variation revealed for h. lobatus using mtdna marker analysis across the lower mrb was unexpected. the observed pattern for h. lobatus is difﬁcult to reconcile with current knowledge of life history traits and the natural distribution of the species. prior to the study, several environmental factors were considered likely to impact on population structure for h. lobatus in the region. firstly, as h. lobatus is an obligate freshwater species, the intervening terrestrial and marine environments between the chao phraya and mrb should result in signiﬁcant differentiation in the absence of recent historical connectivity. secondly, within the mrb itself, the existence of the khone falls (where the river experiences a 21-m altitudinal drop) near the lao pdr ⁄ cambodia borders would likely represent a signiﬁcant barrier to upstream dispersal while affecting downstream movement much less. a third issue is the essentially unidirectional stream ﬂow that should facilitate gene ﬂow down- stream (particularly for eggs and ⁄ or ﬁsh larval stages) but impact on upstream dispersal. finally, the vast size of that, even allowing for large-scale migrations, distance alone could inﬂuence population structure, as individuals are unlikely to move through the whole system within their individual lifetimes. the mekong river would suggest the greatest proportion of genetic variation for h. lobatus was partitioned among river drainages, a pattern that conforms to the stream hierarchy model (shm) of gene ﬂow (meffe & vrijenhoek 1988). however, differentiation among some sites within the mrb was of a similar order of magnitude with that among drainages. while this is inconsistent with the table 5. results of h. lobatus. the samova analysis for k 2 3 4 5 6 7 /ct 0.79586 0.95726 0.95729 0.95711 0.95239 0.94729 p site groupings 0.01955

among geograph- ically proximate locations within a single river system has recently been documented elsewhere for other migrating cyprinids (baerwald et al. 2007). not only does the analysis suggest that samples from the mun river in thailand are genetically differentiated from other areas in the mrb because of heterogeneous haplotype frequencies (table 4), the level of divergence among the two discrete haplotype clades present in the mun and mekong rivers (fig. 2) indicate that these populations were once isolated from each other for considerable evolutionary time. using a molecular clock rate estimate for atpase in freshwater ﬁsh of 1.3% per million years (bermingham et al. 1997) suggests that h. lobatus populations have been evolving independently 2.5– 3.0 million years. approximately for no obvious environmental factors were identiﬁed that could explain the apparent lack of gene ﬂow from the mun river to the mrb or in the reverse direction. the presence of the pak mun dam built downstream from the ub sample site, while perhaps offering an explanation for a lack of gene ﬂow, is not satisfactory because divergence between the two clades is too high given the available time (i.e., the dam was completed in 1994). a more parsimonious explanation for the level of genetic divergence is that there has been some physical barrier separating the two clades in the past. the mun river subdrainage historically was part of a separate river system to the west of the mekong river (rainboth 1996). relatively recent drainage rearrangement brought about by tectonic activity of the khorat plateau [upon which the mun river drainage is situated (rainboth 1996)] may have inﬂuenced this divergence. drainage rearrange- ment has often been invoked to explain deviations from typical stream hierarchy genetic structure (e.g., bermingham et al. 1997; hurwood & hughes 1998; burridge et al. 2006). in this case, river courses that once ﬂowed southwest, may now ﬂow southeast into the mekong system as the mun river. while there is little speciﬁc data to indicate the historical drainage pattern (rainboth 1996), signiﬁcant rear- rangement occurred in the region during the ter- tiary–quaternary the estimated level of divergence among clades. this hypothesis could also explain why migration path- ways for clade a individuals appear restricted solely to the mun river. consistent with boundary an alternative hypothesis is that the construction of the dam ﬂooded a 30-km stretch of rapids in the mun river (roberts 2001). rapids may have provided an enduring barrier to gene ﬂow (at least in an upstream direction). essentially, this involves replacement of a natural barrier with an artiﬁcial one. given the fact that 280 the khone falls do not present a signiﬁcant instream for h. barrier this possibility seems less likely. lobatus however, to dispersal if construction of regardless of the scenario invoked to explain the level of differentiation between h. lobatus populations in the mun and mekong rivers, we still might expect to see mixed lineages present to some degree in both the rivers, reﬂecting a pattern of secondary contact. with the exception of a single individual with a clade b haplotype found in the mun river, the clades are currently reciprocally monophyletic with respect to location. the dam interrupted migration pathways for clade b individuals (from the mun river into the mekong channel), then a rapid decline in the clade b population in the mun river would result because individuals may not be able to access breeding and ⁄ or feeding grounds. not surpris- ingly, many ﬁsheries have collapsed upstream of the pak mun dam since the dam was completed (dud- geon 2003). conversely, populations of clade a individuals may have had migration pathways limited to within the mun river itself and hence have not been affected by the dam. this idea is supported by the fact that no clade a individuals have been detected downstream in the mekong river. in the absence of any current and obvious physical environmental barriers to gene ﬂow, an ecological explanation may be warranted. different habitat requirements or dis- crete migration pathways may explain the pattern. the presence of a single hap12 individual, how- ever, conﬁrms the existence of clade b in the mun river and hence the potential for mixed stocks. from a management perspective, the presence of a cladeb type among the mun river samples clearly indicates that both lineages are sympatric to some degree. the detection of sympatric, yet independent, stocks has been well documented previously in the mekong river for migratory catﬁsh (so et al. 2006). whether the two lineages in this case represent two independent stocks, or indeed different species, that will require separate management strategies can only be deter- mined when variation in multi-locus nuclear dna markers (e.g., microsatellites) are examined, in order to test the hypothesis that individuals from the two clades do, or do not, interbreed. presence of signiﬁcant discontinuities in stream proﬁle, such as the khone falls, could result in restriction of gene ﬂow and may structure freshwater populations to some degree, particularly seen with cyprinids (baird et al. 2003). it is clear from the lack of genetic differentiation evident in this region of the mrb, that the khone falls do not apparently affect h. lobatus dispersal either upstream or downstream. baird et al. (2003) showed that many migrating cypri- nids can traverse the falls, either directly or via lower gradient side channels that circumvent the falls, and that h. lobatus individuals represent the greatest proportion of all species recorded making this transition. what is interesting here is not so much that h. lobatus can apparently traverse the khone falls in an upstream direction, but in doing so, generate an almost panmictic population over the huge geograph- ical range of the lower mekong river. this single population stretches at least from chau doc in the south to nongkhai in northern thailand, a stream distance in excess of 1500 km. far ranging gene ﬂow is a product of active dispersal during annual migra- tions or merely results from passive downstream larval drift. the boundaries of this population identiﬁed here are broadly consistent with that suggested by baird et al. (2003) based on observations of migration pathways for cyprinids in the region. in fact, almost while speciﬁc migration cues or pathways for h. lobatus have not been veriﬁed, there are several aspects of the data that suggest the latter explanation has a lower probability for several reasons. firstly, if passive dispersal was a signiﬁcant determinant of h. lobatus structure, haplotypic diversity should be higher downstream. that is, haplotypes that arise through novel mutations upstream will disperse pas- sively with the current downstream, whereas new haplotypes arising downstream are less likely to move upstream. therefore, downstream sites will act as a sink for haplotypic diversity. the opposite pattern was observed, with sites below the khone falls having, on average, lower haplotypic diversity. furthermore, the distribution of group 4 suggests extensive dispersal capacity but with some limit within the sampling range, resulting in a signature of ibd (fig. 3). but if ﬁve groups (i.e., k = 5) are considered to be a more realistic scenario, and bp was removed from the group, the ibd pattern is lost. this would suggest that a high level of gene ﬂow exists among remaining sites (over >1500 km) yet gene ﬂow is signiﬁcantly constrained between nk and bp which is less than half this distance. it is more likely therefore that genetic differentiation between bp and other group 4 sites is due to the fact that they constitute discrete populations with different migra- tory behaviours and ⁄ or patterns. as a ﬁnal note, it is worth recognising that while the mekong river is one of the largest river drainages in the world, its present geographical characteristics are relatively new as the river has experienced signiﬁcant geomorphological and hydrological change in the recent evolutionary past (rainboth 1996 and refer- ences therein). as such, populations of ﬁshes in the river are likely to carry the signature of recent colonisation and range expansion events in the modern drainage conﬁguration. this scenario is reﬂected in h. lobatus group 4, where (1) clade b displays a ‘starlike’ phylogeny indicative of a recent population genetic structure of h. lobatus expansion (lavery et al. 1996), and (2) when all group 4 sites are pooled, fu’s fs becomes signiﬁ- cantly large and negative ()17.321; p < 0.0001). this is the pattern that would be expected after a population expansion associated with a recent geographical range expansion (ray et al. 2003). this condition is consis- tent with the hypothesis that clade a (in the mun river) and clade b (in the mekong river) diverged in allopatry and have only recently recontacted. conclusions and future research the molecular analysis conducted for h. lobatus has revealed signiﬁcant population structure within the lower mekong river. the structure observed most likely evolved as a result of historical geomorpholog- ical changes to drainage lines in the region and contemporary ecological differentiation (e.g., discrete migration speciﬁcity). thus, h. lobatus in the lower mekong river basin consti- tutes multiple management units and future manage- ment strategies should reﬂect this fact. pathways; habitat further work is necessary to clarify the nature of stock structure in the mun river. a comparative analysis of other ﬁsh species with similar distributions would provide some insight into the generality of potential historical causes of current population patterns (e.g., drainage rearrangement). it will be important, however, to further investigate population structure in h. lobatus in this region using nuclear molecular markers in order to determine whether divergent but sympatric clades represent indepen- dently evolving lineages. acknowledgements while many people
