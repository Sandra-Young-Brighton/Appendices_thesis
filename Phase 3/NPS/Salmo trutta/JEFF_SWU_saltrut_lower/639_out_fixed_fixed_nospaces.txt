condition dependence; reintroduction; parentage; pedigree; dams introduction dams and other artiﬁcial barriers to movement reduce the connectivity of river networks, posing a serious threat to many species of migratory freshwater ﬁsh (morita & yamamoto 2002; limburg & waldman 2009). for anadromous paciﬁc salmon (oncorhyn- chus spp.), impassable barriers eliminate habitat and are a primary cause for declining runs in washington, idaho and california (national research oregon, council 1996). however, a growing there is appreciation that barrier removal or circumvention provides unique opportunities for salmon conserva- tion (e.g., pess et al. 2008). dispersal permits the colonisation of new habitat, so its measurement is critical to conservation efforts that identify sites where improved connectivity could promote range expansion of anadromous species. some adult salmon ‘stray’ into non-natal streams for reproduction (hendry et al. 2004), and this is the pri- mary mechanism for colonisation (anderson & quinn 2007; pess et al. 2012). however, juvenile correspondence: j. h. anderson, northwest fisheries science center, national marine fisheries service, 2725 montlake boulevard east, seattle, wa 98112, usa. e-mail: joe.anderson@noaa.gov current address: *department of biological sciences, simon fraser university, 8888 university drive, burnaby, bc v5a 1s6, canada 30 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00589.x salmon may move substantial distances within streams (ebersole et al. 2006), so juvenile dispersal may produce a secondary phase of spatial expansion following initial colonisation by adults. moreover, if juveniles disperse within streams, maintaining con- nectivity to high-quality rearing habitats will beneﬁt salmon populations even if these areas are rarely used for from spawning grounds. reproduction and are distant juvenile salmonids are ideal organisms for the study of dispersal because some level of dispersal is required based on the breeding ecology of adults and density-dependent foraging ecology of their juvenile offspring. female salmonids deposit hundreds to thousands of eggs (depending on the species) in dis- crete nest sites (esteve 2005); thus, juveniles emerg- ing from a single nest site (termed ‘redd’) are initially aggregated. in most cases, the female con- structs a single redd (murdoch et al. 2009), so all maternal half-siblings emerge in the same vicinity. juvenile salmon of stream-rearing species establish foraging hierarchies in which dominant individuals acquire and defend the most proﬁtable territories (fausch 1984). when space for such territories is lim- individuals move from high-density sites and ited, this dispersal ultimately reduces the effects of density-dependent mortality (keeley 2000; einum et al. 2006). furthermore, rivers and streams are highly vari- able, spatially and temporally, in habitat attributes affecting ﬁsh growth and survival. thus, dispersal between patches of varying quality may inﬂuence the ﬁtness of individuals, thereby favouring the evolution of this behaviour. movements of juvenile coho sal- mon (o. kisutch) are strongly seasonal as ﬁsh in coastal regions seek refuge in off-channel alcoves and ponds or tributaries of larger rivers in late fall or winter as river discharge increases (peterson 1982; nickelson et al. 1992; bramblett et al. 2002). occupancy of such tributaries may increase winter survival, relative to ﬁsh in the main river (ebersole et al. 2006). two hypotheses make contradictory predictions regarding the relationship between individual propen- sity for dispersal and body size. the conventional view, commonly called competitive exclusion, is that space in streams is often limiting and dominance rela- tionships are size-biased. thus, smaller ﬁsh, which are presumably subordinate and unable to acquire ter- ritories, are more prone to disperse (chapman 1962; nielsen 1992; webb et al. 2001). an alternative per- spective is that dispersal is condition dependent, so larger individuals with greater energy reserves can move farther (bowler & benton 2005). the pattern of density-dependent dispersal at older but not youn- ger (2006) life stages observed by einum et al. juvenile coho salmon dispersal supports this hypothesis. the distinction between these perspectives, which need not be entirely mutu- ally exclusive, is especially important in a conserva- tion context because they may determine patterns of dispersal during colonisation periods. in this study, we describe the dispersal of stream- rearing juvenile coho salmon during the initial stages of colonisation following modiﬁcation of landsburg diversion dam on the cedar river, wa. almost all spawning took place in the cedar river itself, but observations of juvenile coho salmon in rock creek, a tributary, provided indirect evidence for dispersal (anderson et al. 2008). here, we extend these results using dna-based parentage to evaluate the spatial arrangement of maternal siblings (i.e., ﬁsh sharing a mother) because these individuals emerged from the same nest site. for some families, we had additional information on the location of the nest from a tag implanted in the mother. we sought to unequivocally determine whether individual juveniles sampled in the tributary had immigrated there and the extent to which the tributary habitat was used by juveniles from different families. to evaluate the competitive exclusion and condition-dependent hypotheses, we compared the body size of juvenile coho salmon expressing different dispersal behaviours. based on the previous observation that juveniles collected far- ther upstream in rock creek were larger (anderson et al. 2008; pess et al. 2011), we hypothesised that condition upstream dispersal in the tributary. dependence would govern materials and methods study site description the cedar river is a 487-km2 watershed in western washington, draining westward from the crest of the cascade mountains into lake washington, which is connected to puget sound via a man-made shipping canal. landsburg diversion dam, a low-head, run-of- the-river dam, blocked migration of anadromous ﬁsh from 1901 until construction of ﬁsh passage facilities in fall 2003 made available 33 km of habitat in the cedar river and its tributaries. approximately 20 km of habitat is now accessible to salmon in the cedar river itself between the dam and cedar falls, a natu- ral barrier to migration, and 13 km is now accessible in tributaries, primarily rock creek, which enters the cedar river 3.4 km upstream from the dam (fig. 1). the city of seattle now manages the area above the dam for municipal water supply and as a de facto reserve, without development, recreation or commer- cial logging. further details on the habitat and bio- logical community are given by kiffney et al.

(2010). adults (n = 644) and juveniles (n = 1719) with  7 loci genotyped were included in this analysis, but the vast majority (88.3%) were genotyped at  9 loci. geno- typing error rate was assessed at 0.66% (anderson et al. 2010). we used cervus version 3.0.3 (marshall et al. 1998; kalinowski et al. 2007) for all parentage analysis. all juvenile offspring were of known age, and we therefore only considered parents from the correct cohort. subsequent assignment protocols were identical to those detailed in anderson et al. (2010). juveniles were assigned two parents if a potential parent pair met four criteria: (i) log of the odds score (lod)  12.44, (ii)  1 mismatching locus, (iii) parents of the opposite sex and (iv) fewer mismatch- ing loci than any other parent pair meeting criteria i–iv. assigned two parents were assigned a single parent if the candidate parent had (i) lod  6.21, (ii)  1 mismatching locus and (iii) fewer mismatching loci than all other potential parents. lod thresholds for both two- and one-parent assignments were obtained by simulation at the 99% conﬁdence level. across all brood years, we obtained genotypes from 1719 juveniles, and 1442 (83.9%) of them were assigned two parents. an additional 105 (6.1%) juveniles were assigned a mother only and so were suitable for analysis of dispersal. juveniles not our analysis of dispersal focused on juvenile coho salmon that shared a mother, and we assumed these individuals emerged from a common redd. the redd typically consists of a series of 4–5 egg pockets, deposited discretely over a period of a few days and often fertilised by different males, but all guarded by the mother until she dies (esteve 2005). we term these groups ‘maternal families’, because they con- tain both full- and maternal half-siblings. to evaluate the condition dependence and competi- tive exclusion hypotheses, we compared the body size of juveniles that differed in dispersal behaviour. we had previously found that the offspring of later- spawning females were smaller (anderson et al. 2010) and therefore accounted for this effect in our analyses. for by 2003 and 2004, we compared the body size of dispersing and nondispersing juveniles within families because these individuals shared a common emergence date. this analysis was restricted to samples collected during the summer from families with at least three juveniles in both the dispersing and nondispersing categories. for by 2006 and 2007, we compared the body size of immigrants that dispersed from the cedar river into the upper reaches of rock creek with those that dispersed from the cedar river into the lower reach of rock creek. ancova simultaneously tested the effects of date of maternal arrival to the spawning grounds (continu- ous) and upstream versus downstream capture loca- tion (categorical). ancova, performed separately for each brood year, ﬁrst tested a full model with the interaction term; sub- sequently dropped if it was nonsigniﬁcant (p > 0.10). the interaction term was results within each cohort, a large proportion of the total number of females that bypassed the dam produced offspring in our collections (table 1). samples of juvenile coho salmon from by 2003 and 2004, when both the cedar river and rock creek were sampled, indicated extensive dispersal. we considered the spa- tial distribution of 27 maternal families with  12 the individuals (figs 2 and 3). for eight families, 33 (a) (c) (e) (g) (i) 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 anderson et al. n o m a s l o h o c e l i n e v u j f o r e b m u n 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 (b) (d) (f) (h) (j) 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 7 6 1 distance from dam (km) 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 fig. 2. spatial histograms of maternal families from brood year 2003. each panel a-j represents a single family. the large histogram shows samples taken from the cedar river, and the small inset plot shows samples taken from rock creek, which enters the cedar river 3.4 km from the dam. all cedar river samples were collected during the summer (on or before september 15);

(figs 2a–g and 3a–l). finally, some families without maternal tracking data had small numbers of ﬁsh collected from many different locations without a dis- tinct area of higher abundance (fig. 3m–q), preclud- ing inference of the spawning reach but nevertheless indicating dispersal by the offspring. data from by 2003 and 2004 indicated that juve- niles entered rock creek from spawning sites in the cedar river. twenty-one (9.5%) of the 220 juveniles originating from known spawning sites in the cedar river were collected in rock creek. families with the largest number of individuals in rock creek also had the most samples collected from the cedar river reach adjacent to the mouth of rock creek (figs 2i and 3g,m). however, immigration into rock creek was also observed for juveniles that presumably emerged from nest sites in the cedar river several kilometres above (figs 2a,b,d,f and 3a,h,j) and below (fig. 3c,l) the tributary junction. beginning with by 2004, we sampled multiple reaches in rock creek. densities increased from summer to fall in almost all reaches and all years, the only exception being reach 1 in by 2005 (table 2). densities in the upstream reaches increased more from summer to fall than the lowest reach (table 2). parentage analysis indicated that juvenile coho sal- mon collected from rock creek represented many different maternal sibling families (table 1). the pro- portion of females bypassing the dam that produced juvenile offspring collected from rock creek increased in each successive year (table 1). juvenile coho salmon collected from the upstream reaches in rock creek tended to be produced by adult females that bypassed the dam earlier than the mothers of the juveniles collected from the lower reach (table 2), a difference that was statistically signiﬁcant in three of four cohorts (t-tests for reach 1 versus reaches 2 and 3 pooled: by 2004: p = 0.038, by 2005: p < 0.0001, by 2006: p = 0.016, by 2007: p > 0.10). to evaluate patterns of tributary immigration by juvenile coho salmon from by 2006 and 2007, we examined the pit-tag detection histories of the adult females that produced these cohorts. consistent with results from previous years (anderson & quinn 2007;

by 2004: f1,284 = 0.15, p = 0.70), but there was a family (by 2003: f3,111 = 24.8, p < 0.0001; by effect 37 anderson et al. 2004: f9,284 = 26.0, p < 0.0001); the family 9 loca- in by 2004 tion interaction term was signiﬁcant (f9,284 = 2.16, p = 0.025) but not in by 2003 (f3,111 = 2.05, p = 0.11). individuals by 2006 and 2007 provided support for condition- dependent upstream dispersal within rock creek. for juvenile salmon known to originate from nest sites in the cedar river, dispersal distance in the tributary was proportional to capture location expressed as a longitudinal distance to the creek mouth. among the known immigrants, captured in the upstream reaches and those produced by early- spawning parents were (fig. 5). ancova revealed statistically signiﬁcant effects of both cap- ture location (by 2006: f1,107 = 18.2, p < 0.0001; by 2007: f1,188 = 52.6, p < 0.0001) and maternal arrival date (by 2006: f1,107 = 4.9, p = 0.029; by 2007: f1,188 = 13.0, p = 0.00039). the models pre- dicted that immigrants from the upper reaches were 6.1 mm and 10.3 mm larger than those in the lower reach in by 2006 and 2007, respectively (fig. 5). larger discussion this study describes the dispersal of juvenile coho salmon in a population colonising newly accessible habitat. data from by 2003 and 2004, when sam- pling covered both the cedar river and rock creek, revealed that maternal families occupied a large range of locations. most families occupied several 500-m longitudinal bins along the river, and we frequently observed juveniles several kilometres away from the known or inferred spawning reach (figs 2–4). these juvenile movements provided a secondary phase of dispersal following initial colonisation by adults and therefore contributed to the spatial expansion of the colonising population. given the variation in habitat quality and rates of growth and survival in heteroge- neous stream systems (quinn & peterson 1996; ebersole et al. 2006), this dispersal might increase the probability of survival by at least some members of each family. although our estimates of dispersal distances were coarse, they exceeded most previous estimates from similar studies of stream salmonids in rearing habi- tats. atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and brook char (salvelinus_fontinalis) in streams have typically been found within several hundred metres of known or inferred nest sites (webb et al. 2001; einum & nislow 2005; einum et al. 2008; foldvik et al. 2010; hudy et al. 2010; kanno et al. 2011). importantly, compared with these studies, our sampling covered a greater spatial area and, in some cases, samples were collected later relative to hatching and emergence. both of these differences increased our ability to detect longer-range dispersal. at the other extreme, 38 stream-type chinook salmon (o. tshawytscha) in the columbia river system have been collected 10–100s of kilometres from spawning areas, although these ﬁsh may have been migrating to the ocean rather than rearing (connor et al. 2001; friesen et al. 2007). our study involved a different species of salmonid, a dif- ferent stream system and different densities compared with the other studies, so it is not possible to deter- mine the reason(s) for differences in dispersal dis- tance. we also could not determine why some families were more dispersed than others because of uncertainty over the precise location of the nest sites within spawning reaches and the range of dates over which samples from different families were collected. regardless, the results are important because they reveal the large area over which families are distrib- uted as a result of juvenile movement. several lines of evidence indicated a consistent and directed immigration of juvenile coho salmon from the mainstem cedar river into and up its tributary, rock creek. first, densities within rock creek increased markedly from the summer to the fall (table 2). sec- ond, most adult coho salmon spawned in the cedar river (this study, anderson & quinn 2007). therefore, if the juveniles captured in rock creek had been pro- duced there, they would have originated from very few the case; 38–83% of adult families. this was not females produced offspring captured in rock creek (table 1). the large proportion of different families sampled in rock creek was striking and indicated that rock creek was not occupied by a few families spawned near the tributary mouth, but rather was a des- tination where unrelated individuals originating from many different nest sites converged. the most direct evidence for tributary immigration came from the tagging data. for some families, we could conﬁrm a maternal spawning location in the cedar river based on radio- or pit-tag detection data, and many juveniles from these families were captured in rock creek. the data from by 2006 and 2007, when adult females were pit-tagged, indicated that the majority of juveniles in the tributary were immigrants. finally, some (5.9%) of the juvenile coho salmon pit-tagged in the cedar river were detected moving into rock creek. this indicated that the rock creek immigrants, while numerically domi- nating the tributary, may have only been a fraction of the total number of ﬁsh from the cedar river. although tributary immigration had previously been observed in juvenile coho salmon, the timing of the movements observed here was novel. previous studies of coastal systems found that tributary immigration occurred primarily during the fall or winter, and authors concluded that tributaries and wetlands offered refuge from high discharge encountered in the main river (bustard & narver 1975; tschaplinski & hartman 1983; bramblett et al. 2002; ebersole et al. 2006). in contrast, the tributary immigration we observed had largely taken place by the time we sampled in late september or early october, and therefore, the ﬁsh entered in the spring or summer prior to fall–winter freshets. once in the tributary, juvenile coho immi- grants encountered a narrower stream with more deﬁned pool-rifﬂe structure, more woody debris and fewer large predatory rainbow trout (o. mykiss) than those in the main river (kiffney et al. 2009). these habitat features may have encouraged immigrants to stay in rock creek after they entered, but temperature may have attracted them to it initially. the warmer temperatures in rock creek during the summer (mean ± sd for n = 5 pools in june–august 2008: 12.69 ± 2.23 °c) relative to the cedar river (n = 3 pools, 10.49 ± 1.36 °c) would have been readily detectable at the conﬂuence with the cedar river. for consistent with the condition-dependent hypothe- sis, juveniles dispersing farther upstream in rock creek were larger than ﬁsh collected near the tribu- tary mouth. condition-dependent dispersal has been observed in many taxa (bowler & benton 2005), and the ability of juvenile salmonids to disperse increases through ontogeny (einum et al. 2006). in the present study, we add that dispersal ability of juvenile salmo- nids is likely to vary substantially within a given cohort according to the range of body sizes observed in a population. condition dependence is one of sev- eral nonmutually exclusive explanations the observed dispersal patterns, including differences in habitat quality, predation and emergence timing; our results indicated that large ﬁsh were more capable of taking advantage of dispersal opportunities than small ﬁsh, at least within rock creek. upstream movement is energetically demanding, and bigger ﬁsh have a greater metabolic capability and swimming perfor- mance (brett 1995). therefore, the upstream direction of movement likely increased the advantage of large size. we found no evidence for condition dependence in analysis of the by 2003 and 2004 juveniles dis- persing from known or inferred redd sites, perhaps because these ﬁsh primarily moved downstream in the cedar river. in addition, ﬁsh from the cedar river were collected over 2–4 weeks during the height of the growing season, and the confounding effect of accumulated growth during sampling may have obscured the analysis. several aspects of our results contradict the con- ventional paradigm that competitive exclusion gov- erns movements of coho salmon. previous research has emphasised subordinate social status and a failure to obtain and hold territories as a cause for down- stream movements (chapman 1962; hartman et al. 1982; nielsen 1992). in our study, this mechanism cannot explain widespread dispersal in a system with juvenile coho salmon dispersal low overall densities, the consistent upstream move- ments in rock creek or the positive relationship between body size and dispersal distance in rock creek. although competitive exclusion may regulate dispersal in established populations of coho salmon where space is limiting, forced emigration because of agonistic interactions is probably less common under the low densities typical of colonisation. similarly, kahler et al. (2001) found that habitat quality rather than subordinate body size explained coho salmon movements and that many ﬁsh moved upstream. that we suggest the timing of emergence inﬂu- enced dispersal. previous work, both in this system (anderson et al. 2010) and elsewhere (einum & fleming 2000), has shown that offspring of earlier- breeding females are larger at a given date. thus, early-emerging individuals not only had more time for movements by a ﬁxed sampling period later in the season, but also had the greater dispersal ability accompanying large size. early-emerging individuals were probably the ﬁrst individuals to move into pre- viously unoccupied territories and thus may have enjoyed a prior residence advantage (e.g., chandler & bjornn 1988; skoglund et al. 2012) in competition against in rock creek, where end of summer densities in by 2006 and 2007 approached values observed in established popula- tions of coho salmon (pess et al. 2011), later-arriving immigrants may have had difﬁculty acquiring forag- ing territories. later-arriving individuals. we cannot entirely separate cause from conse- quence regarding the relationship between body size and dispersal distance. in other words, ﬁsh dispersing to the upstream reaches of rock creek may have encountered favourable growing conditions upon arri- val, contributing to their larger size. our experience in rock creek suggests little difference between the lower and upper reaches in the physical habitat attri- butes relevant to growth of juvenile coho salmon. for example, residual habitat depth within our sampling pools (a strong predictor of coho salmon presence) was unrelated to the distance from the mouth of rock creek (pess et al. 2011). the slightly warmer temper- atures in the upper reaches (mean ± sd of n = 3 pools during june–august 2008: 12.88 ± 2.15 °c) may have provided a minor growth advantage rela- the mouth (n = 2 pools, tive to the area near 12.40 ± 2.32 °c). more importantly, juveniles sampled in the upper reaches were early immigrants they likely encountered consistently to the creek, later lower than arrivals captured downstream. we suspect that condition- dependent dispersal and density-dependent growth advantages acted synergistically, resulting in a sub- stantial size difference between salmon sampled from the upper and lower reaches. conspeciﬁc densities if 39 anderson et al. more generally, our results indicate that juvenile dispersal is an important component of the colonisa- tion process. for species that deposit many embryos at a single location (e.g., many ﬁshes and amphibi- ans), a patchy breeding distribution could lead to density-dependent processes at small spatial scales (einum et al. 2008). at the low abundances typical of colonising populations, juveniles are likely to be aggregated in a small number of nest sites and could signiﬁcantly reduce their local density via dispersal. by enhancing per capita resource availability, dis- persal may increase growth opportunities for individ- ual ﬁsh (einum et al. 2011) and consequently reduce exposure to size-selective predation and the likeli- hood of starvation. at the population level, this could increase survival and hence the rate of population growth during colonisation. indeed, we observed much higher productivity by the coho salmon popula- tion than by the sympatric ocean-type chinook sal- mon (anderson 2011). the extended freshwater residence of juvenile coho salmon (typically one year) compared with ocean-type chinook salmon (typically several months), as well as the ability of juvenile coho salmon to take advantage of high- quality rearing habitats above the dam through dispersal, may have contributed to this discrepancy. for philopatric species, juvenile dispersal could catalyse adult colonisation. dispersal during juvenile rearing may increase the propensity for individual salmon to ‘stray’ into non-natal habitats when they return to fresh water as adults (hamann & kennedy 2012). we have observed increased use of rock creek for spawning in recent years, and it seems plausible that adults who immigrated into the tribu- tary as juveniles home to odours imprinted (sensu dittman & quinn 1996) the river. such behaviour by second-generation, within- population recruits could be important for reaching the carrying capacity of high-quality rearing habitats if these areas are rarely settled by population immi- grant adults that select breeding locations based on nest site characteristics. however, juvenile colonisa- tion does not always lead to adult colonisation, as juvenile chinook salmon often rear in non-natal tributaries (murray & rosenau 1989). in the creek rather in a conservation context, our results emphasise the importance of maintaining connectivity for juve- niles as well as adults. construction of dams and other stream blockages, which eliminate habitat for migratory ﬁsh and fragment populations of resident species, poses a serious threat to aquatic diversity (sheldon 1988; morita & yamamoto 2002; limburg & waldman 2009). many structures, particularly cul- verts and small low-head dams, are likely to be par- tial barriers passable by larger ﬁsh that can sustain fast swimming speeds but not smaller ﬁsh with 40 if weaker swimming performance (meixler et al. 2009). in this study, the widespread movements of juveniles and directed migration into the tributary indicate that barrier removal can effectively increase the range of rearing habitats, even when such areas are distant from breeding sites. restoration planners focus exclusively on barriers to adults in selecting projects to increase stream connectivity, they may miss oppor- tunities for increasing the quality and capacity of juvenile rearing habitats. for stream ﬁsh whose abun- dance is often limited by space, food and other resources for young, providing opportunities for juve- nile spatial expansion may provide a signiﬁcant con- servation beneﬁt. acknowledgements we thank j. mcdowell, a. kingham, d. galloway, j. cram, k. kloehn, r. holland, r. klett, t. buehrens and m. liermann for their help collecting samples and d. chapin,
