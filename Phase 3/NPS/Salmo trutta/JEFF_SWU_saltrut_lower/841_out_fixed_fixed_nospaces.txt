munksgaard c. b. watry, d. l. scarnecchia department of fish and wildlife resources, college of natural resources, university of idaho, moscow, id, usa abstract – life history strategies and migratory patterns of 71 adult radio-tagged bull trout, salvelinus conﬂuentus, were studied in the secesh river watershed within the south fork salmon river (sfsr) sub-basin in west-central idaho, usa during 2003 and 2004. in both years, upstream migrations occurred during late june and early july, migrations into two spawning tributaries during late july and early august, spawning from mid-august through mid-september, and rapid downstream (postspawning) migrations from late august to mid-september. primary over-wintering areas were loon lake, the lower secesh river (downstream of loon creek), and the lower sfsr (downstream of the conﬂuence with the secesh river). loon lake evidently provides sufﬁcient production to allow the adﬂuvial life history strategy to persist and predominate in the secesh river, while the ﬂuvial life history strategy was previously found to predominate in the nearby east fork sfsr. adﬂuvial, nonconsecutive-year migrations were the predominant life history strategy. only seven ﬁsh made consecutive-year migrations to lake creek; however, only one of these ﬁsh, a female, utilised a spawning tributary in both years and showed spawning tributary ﬁdelity. three consecutive-year migrants and three in-season migrants showed over- wintering site ﬁdelity by returning to loon lake in september, 2004. the life history variations observed for bull trout in the secesh river watershed are similar to those observed for bull trout throughout their range and to those of other charr species worldwide, yet the development of distinct migration patterns demonstrate the adaptability of the species to a range of available habitats. key words: charr; migration; bull trout; salveli- nus; salmonidae clark b. watry, cramer fish sciences, 636 hedburg way #22, oakdale, ca, 95361, usa; e-mail: clarkw@ﬁshsciences.net accepted for publication september 16, 2007 introduction fish stocks of the genus salvelinus (family: salmon- idae) in the arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus, and dolly varden, salvelinus_malma, complexes exhibit great genotypic, phenotypic and life history variation across their ranges (behnke 1984; taylor et al. 1999). phylogenetic divergence has occurred extensively in these species complexes since the early-pleistocene and has been associated with the episodic advances and retreat of glaciers (behnke 1980; magnan et al. 2002; power 2002). changing environmental condi- tions and habitat characteristics over geologic time, and more recently, have favoured the development of diverse life history strategies, resulting in stock- speciﬁc adaptations as well as morphological and ecological plasticity within and among stocks (mccart 1980; na¨slund 1992; hindar & jonsson 1993). the bull trout, salvelinus conﬂuentus, a piscivorous charr of the dolly varden complex native to much of the paciﬁc north-west region of north america (cavender 1978; haas & mcphail 1991), exhibits a doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00274.x 231 watry & scarnecchia variety of life history strategies typical of charrs, including adﬂuvial potamodromy (migrations between lake or reservoir systems and rivers; fraley & shepard 1989; olmstead et al. 2001), ﬂuvial potamodromy (migrations between rivers; hogen & scarnecchia 2006), residency (chandler et al. 2001; nelson et al. 2002), and in a few instances, anadromy (baker et al. 2003). considerable research has been conducted on life history strategies and habitat use of numerous stocks during the past 15–20 years (e.g. mackay et al. 1997; brewin et al. 2001). however, in many local- ities, little is known about stock-speciﬁc life history strategies, migration patterns and habitat use. the evolution of different migratory forms has enabled bull trout to occupy spatially diverse habitats and optimise reproductive potential by maximising growth, fecundity and survival in variable environ- ments (northcote 1978). diverse life history strategies may therefore be critically important to the long-term stability and persistence of the species (rieman & mcintyre 1993; stowell et al. 1996; rieman & allendorf 2001). continued habitat degradation, the expansion of nonnative species, and prolonged habitat fragmentation has reduced the distribution and abun- dance of bull trout in many localities (rieman et al. 1997). in the north-western united states and canada, the range of bull trout has continued to contract and become fragmented over the last century, particularly in the more temperate southern portions (nelson et al. 2002). speciﬁc factors contributing to this range contraction and fragmentation include loss or altera- tions of critical spawning and rearing habitat (rieman & mcintyre 1993, 1995; rieman et al. 1997), compe- tition with introduced nonnative species, and hybridi- sation and introgression with nonnative brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis). adﬂuvial the south fork salmon river (sfsr) sub-basin in central idaho, usa, is considered a stronghold for the species in the interior northwest (u.s. fish and wildlife service 1998). hogen & scarnecchia (2006) described a primarily ﬂuvial life history strategy for bull trout in the east fork south fork salmon river (efsfsr), with a minor component associated with a 60-year old, 2 ha ﬂooded mining pit. however, in the neighbouring secesh river, little is known about any aspects of bull trout life history and ecology, location of spawning and over-wintering areas, migration pat- terns and run timing, as well as environmental factors that affect spawning and migration timing. by extending the type of investigation conducted by hogen & scarnecchia (2006) to a second nearby watershed with different habitat characteristics within the sfsr sub-basin, we sought to gain additional regarding stock discreteness and factors insight including the 232 inﬂuencing life history variations in bull trout and charrs in general. our objectives were to: (i) identify and characterise life history strategies (adﬂuvial or ﬂuvial), including the classiﬁcation of migration patterns and delineation migratory corridors and (ii) assess spatial and temporal distributions of bull relative to life history strategies in the secesh river and its tributaries. the results are discussed in relation to variations in life history strategies observed for migratory bull trout and other migratory charrs worldwide. trout study area the study occurred within the secesh river which drains one of four major watersheds in the sfsr sub- basin in west-central idaho, usa (fig. 1). the three other watersheds include the lower sfsr, the efsfsr and the upper sfsr above the conﬂuence with the efsfsr. the secesh river watershed encompasses approximately 63,940 ha, or slightly <20% of the sfsr sub-basin (area: 339,940 ha). the secesh river is located in the north-western portion of the sfsr sub-basin in an area of primarily granitic geology (idaho batholith). soils are generally sandy and poorly developed with low water-holding capacity and low natural fertility, contributing to low stream productivity (klamt 1976). the secesh river ﬂows in a general south-southeast direction from its origin at the conﬂuence of lake creek and summit creek (two major tributaries) to its conﬂuence with the mainstem sfsr located 1.6 km below the conﬂuence of the efsfsr and sfsr (fig. 1). channel gradients range from <1% along tributaries in the upper secesh watershed to more than 10% in canyon sections of the main secesh river. peak discharge in the secesh river results from snowmelt runoff during late may and june, from november in lake creek, peak recorded through march. )1 discharge was approximately 62.5 and 11.0 m3æs on 28 may, 2003 and 2004 respectively. the secesh river watershed also contains a 60-ha mountain lake (loon lake) approximately 3.0 km upstream of the conﬂuence of loon creek with the secesh river (fig. 1). base ﬂows occur and native ﬁsh assemblages in the sfsr sub-basin include both resident and anadromous salmonids. native resident species include bull trout, redband trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), westslope cutthroat trout (o. clarki lewisi) and mountain whiteﬁsh (prosopium_williamsoni). native anadromous include endangered chinook salmon (o. tshawytscha) and steelhead trout (o. mykiss). runs of sockeye salmon (o. nerka) were historically present into loon lake and warm lake in the upper secesh river and sfsr watersheds, respectively, and are now thought to be species adﬂuvial and ﬂuvial life histories and migrations of bull trout in

capture adult bull trout were captured in the secesh river watershed mainly by hook and line using a combina- lures, bait with circle hooks and tion of artiﬁcial artiﬁcial ﬂies. this sampling method previously proved effective, with minimal harm to the ﬁsh, when collecting bull scarnecchia 2006). trout in the efsfsr (hogen & in 2003, ﬁshing occurred almost daily between 19 june and 15 august either in the secesh river or lake creek. sampling at these particular locations and times was intended to target ﬁsh during their upstream prespawning migrations. from past observations, spawning was thought to occur after 15 august. from this sampling, 24 prespawn bull trout and one putative hybrid were selected to be radio-tagged. putative hybrids were distinguished from bull trout and brook_trout by using multiple external phenotypic traits as described in markle (1992) and watry (2005). in addition to these ﬁsh, 20 postspawn bull trout captured at the nez perce tribe’s rotary screw smolt trap on lake creek between 23 august and 7 september were selected for radio-tagging, for a total of 45 ﬁsh. postspawn ﬁsh were identiﬁed by gently stripping the ﬁsh for gametes to verify gender and reproductive 233 watry & scarnecchia in 2004, ﬁshing effort was condition, although gender was not veriﬁed for all ﬁsh. other indicators identifying postspawn ﬁsh included their emaciated appearance, enervated condition and late date of capture (late august to early september). focused in three locations: loon lake, the secesh river and lake creek during the period 12 june to 22 july. from this sampling, 26 prespawn ﬁsh, including 16 bull trout, two brook_trout, and four putative hybrids in loon lake and four bull trout in lake creek were selected to be radio-tagged. no postspawn ﬁsh were selected for tagging in 2004 because of high mortality rates of this group of radio-tagged ﬁsh in 2003. following capture, ﬁsh selected for tagging were immediately transferred to perforated stream tubes (90 cm · 10 cm or 90 cm · 15 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe with sliding door on one end) and submerged in the stream for at least 15 min prior to additional handling. sampling and surgical procedures typically followed immediately thereafter. however, for ﬁsh caught during mid-day heat, surgeries were postponed until early evening when cooler air temperatures prevailed. for ﬁsh caught late in the evening, surgeries were postponed until the next morning. radio-tag speciﬁcations transmitters with speciﬁc radio frequencies allowed identiﬁcation of individual ﬁsh. in 2003, 45 ﬁsh were implanted with advanced telemetry systems (ats) f1825 and f1835 radio transmitters (table 1). in 2004, 26 ﬁsh received ats f1815 radio-telemetry transmitters (table 1). as a rule, the weight of the transmitter did not exceed 2% of the total body weight of the ﬁsh to be tagged (winter 1996). in 2003, both types of tags had duty cycles that transmitted signals for 6 h per day for four consecutive days, and did not transmit for three consecutive days per week. the short battery life of 200 days for the f1825 transmit- ters used in 2003 only allowed for a single spawning and over-wintering season to be monitored. in 2004, the f1815 radio-tags had a duty cycle that transmitted signals for 6 h per day, 7 days per week. the limited duty cycle of all tags made it impractical to utilise a ﬁxed receiving station. all tags were outﬁtted with mortality sensors that activated a speciﬁc signal equal to twice the normal table 1. speciﬁcations of radio-tags used in 2003 and 2004. that trout at pulse rate indicating that a ﬁsh or transmitter remained motionless for a period of 12 consecutive hours. mortality signals used twice the battery power, which decreased the effective battery life. the reliability of mortality sensors was uncertain, particularly during winter, because of the natural sedentary behaviour of bull time of year. johnson (1980) described observations of arctic charr behaviour during winter by diving under ice and noted that ﬁsh remained relatively motionless by resting on their ﬁns. in such a case, individual ﬁsh could intermittently transmit a mortality signal, reducing battery life. therefore, mortality signals were not considered a positive indication of ﬁsh mortality. multiple sequen- tial contacts of mortality signals were required before inferences regarding potential ﬁsh mortality or tag loss were made for individual ﬁsh. radio-tag implantation fish to be tagged were moved from the stream tube and placed into 20 l water containing a solution of )1 tricaine methanesulfonate (ms-222). 60–80 mgæl fish were completely anaesthetised after 2–3 min. fish were then transferred to a padded, v-shaped cradle and positioned on their dorsum for surgical tag implantation. to ensure complete anaesthetisation throughout the surgical procedure the gills and head were continuously irrigated with ms-222 solution. the procedure used to implant radio-tags was similar to the shielded-needle technique described by ross & kleiner (1982) as modiﬁed by hogen & scarnecchia (2006). the initial 4 cm incision was made 1 cm from the mid-ventral line, anterior to the pelvic ﬁns. a small separate opening was made for extrusion of the tag antenna. three surgeon’s knots, spaced 1 cm, apart served to suture the incision closed. after the ﬁrst suture was completed, irrigation of fresh water over the gills was begun to prevent an anaes- thetic overdose. a fourth suture at the antenna exit oriﬁce helped prevent irritation from excessive move- ment of the exterior antenna. mobile tracking radio signals from tagged ﬁsh were received using a directional, three-element yagi antenna and either an year 2004 2003 2003 no. of ﬁsh tagged 26 30 15 effective battery life

during periods of predetermined tag transmission. weekly tracking was conducted from a vehicle or by foot from july through september 2003 and from june through october 2004. aerial surveys with ﬁxed wing aircraft were conducted on 20 september and 24 october, 2003; and on 13 june, 8 september and 1 october, 2004. fish locations were recorded using a global posi- tioning system in the utm nad27conus coordi- nate system. calculated map distances were measured from the mouth of the secesh river beginning at river km (rkm) 1098.6. locations referenced as rkm were recorded for each captured ﬁsh, and capture locations were considered the initial point of contact for each ﬁsh. subsequent contacts were calculated as distances travelled from the initial point of contact. when not in spawning tributaries, ﬁsh locations accurate to within approximately 50 m were deemed adequate to meet study objectives. when in spawning tributaries, triangulation helped determine precise locations to help make general observations of radio- tagged ﬁsh, particularly during the known spawning season beginning in mid-august, as identiﬁed from other studies (shepard et al. 1984; schill et al. 1994; swanberg 1997; hogen & scarnecchia 2006). spawn- ing for this study was deﬁned as any activity that demonstrated ﬁsh were participating in the spawning process, the presence of redds with ﬁsh present, the pairing of ﬁsh in small headwater tributaries during the fall spawning season, and aggressive behaviour of ﬁsh while guard- ing a redd. we attempted only to identify spawning areas, not to quantify spawning habitat or to detect population trends. including the construction of redds, trout no surveys were conducted during winter in 2003 and 2004 because of access problems and the inability to detect transmitter signals from the air through ice and snow. johnson (1980) suggested the winter activity of arctic charr was negligible, and there is supporting evidence that bull trout display similar behaviour. hogen & scarnecchia (2006) observed that ﬂuvial bull in the mainstem salmon river and lower sfsr moved <1 km during winter. elle et al. (1994) and schill et al. (1994) reported negligible movements of 50–100 m within individual habitat units during winter on the main- stem salmon river for rapid river bull trout. in 1992, all ﬁsh reached their over-wintering destination by early october (schill et al. 1994). in the blackfoot river, montana, ﬂuvial bull trout movements during winter never exceeded 300 m (swanberg 1997). as a result, winter movements were assumed to be minimal and localised; therefore, ﬁsh locations during spring 2004 relative to the last known locations during fall 2003 were used to corroborate over- wintering locations. life history strategies and migration patterns movements of radio-tagged ﬁsh were grouped into life history strategies (adﬂuvial or ﬂuvial), and within these strategies, migration patterns were identiﬁed. because capture locations differed between 2003 and 2004, migration patterns were identiﬁed and evaluated separately for each year. in a few instances, ﬁsh mortality or tag loss made it impossible to assign a speciﬁc migration pattern to individual ﬁsh. to the man-made impoundment it was hypothesised that the tendency to manifest an adﬂuvial (as opposed to ﬂuvial) life history strategy would differ between secesh river and efsfsr ﬁsh, despite their close proximity, because of the presence of a large lake in the secesh river watershed in contrast in the efsfsr watershed (hogen & scarnecchia 2006). the null hypothesis was that bull trout winter habitat selection and corresponding life history strategy (adﬂuvial vs. ﬂuvial) was independent of natal watershed (secesh river vs. efsfsr). the hypothesis was tested at the 0.05 level of signiﬁcance using chi-squared test, v2 = s (o)e)2 ⁄ e, where the o = observed results and e = expected results (zar 1999). results life history strategies and migration patterns sixty-four of 71 radio-tagged ﬁsh were classiﬁed into one of four migration patterns. based mainly on tagging location and duration of tracking, the four migration patterns identiﬁed were: migratory adﬂuvial, stationary adﬂuvial (used to describe ﬁsh in loon lake that did not migrate during the season but would have had to previously migrate to loon lake), ﬂuvial and adﬂuvial-ﬂuvial. in all, 43 ﬁsh displayed one of two strictly adﬂuvial patterns. twenty-nine ﬁsh displayed the migratory adﬂuvial migration pattern in 2003 (n = 26; fig. 2) and 2004 (n = 3; fig. 3) while the stationary adﬂuvial pattern was exclusively associated with ﬁsh captured in loon lake in 2004 (n = 14; fig. 4). nineteen other bull trout in 2003 (n = 16) and 2004 (n = 3) displayed ﬂuvial migration patterns (figs 5 and 6). two ﬁsh captured in loon lake during june 2004 displayed an adﬂuvial–ﬂuvial migration pattern (fig. 7). speciﬁc migration patterns were not assigned to three conﬁrmed prespawn mortalities in 2003 and four apparent mortalities in 2004. in the most common migration pattern observed trout two (migratory captured during july 2003 entered one of adﬂuvial), prespawn 14 bull 235

sfsr (n = 2) following capture where they remained through november and evidently into winter (figs 5 and 6). these ﬁsh were initially captured and tagged at the lake creek smolt trap between 23 august and 7 september, 2003 (n = 10), or by angling in lake creek during 2003 (n = 2) and 2004 (n = 1). in all, 80% of the ﬁsh initially captured and tagged at the smolt trap showed veriﬁable evidence of gender (ﬁve males and three females) and postspawning condition, whereas the three ﬁsh captured in lake creek did not show evidence of gender. ten of the 12 (83%) ﬁsh from 2003 were transmitting mortality signals in october and november. one of the two live ﬁsh was transmitting mortality signals in june 2004, while the other was not relocated during 2004. six other bull trout captured by angling in lake creek in 2003 and 2004 (n = 4 and 2 respectively) entered a tributary, remained in the tributary for up to 46 days, evidently spawned, exited the tributary, and moved downstream to the lower secesh river in 2003 (n = 4) and 2004 (n = 1) or the lower sfsr in 2004 (n = 1; fig. 6). similar to the migratory adﬂuvial pattern, these ﬁsh rapidly emigrated out of tributaries, all ﬁsh having exited small tributaries by 7 september. in all, 75% of the ﬁsh tagged in 2003 transmitted live signals in november 2003, and two of these ﬁsh were relocated in the secesh river transmitting live signals, evidently without migrating, during 2004. in the third most common migration pattern (stationary adﬂuvial) 14 ﬁsh captured and tagged in loon lake during june 2004 remained there for the duration of the summer (fig. 4). one (7%) of these ﬁsh transmitted a mortality signal within 18 days of being tagged and it could not be determined whether this ﬁsh expelled its tag or died. all remaining ﬁsh survived in the lake through at least october when tracking was terminated. in the least common migration pattern observed (adﬂuvial–ﬂuvial) two bull trout exited loon lake in late june and early july in 2004, moved upstream in the secesh river and lake creek, entered a tributary in late july, remained in the tributary between 36 and 39 days, evidently spawned, exited the tributary and moved downstream to the lower secesh river (fig. 7). both ﬁsh rapidly emigrated from the tributary during late august and early september, and were later located in the secesh river during september and october. the test of over-wintering habitat selection and corresponding life history strategy (adﬂuvial vs. ﬂuvial) for secesh river and efsfsr ﬁsh indicated that life history strategy was dependent on natal watershed (v2 = 34.7; p < 0.001; table 2). therefore, a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of radio-tagged secesh river ﬁsh in the present study were adﬂuvial than in the radio-tagged ﬁsh of the efsfsr studied by hogen & scarnecchia (2006). movement to spawning tributaries only two small tributaries of lake creek in the upper secesh river drainage were utilised by radio- tagged bull trout in 2003 and 2004. bull trout were ﬁrst located on 19 july, 2003 and 21 july, 2004 in table 2. chi-squared contingency table for observed (expected) numbers of ﬁsh

tributaries prior to the spawning period. in all, 27 radio-tagged bull trout were observed in spawning tributaries during 2003 (n = 18) and 2004 (n = 9). only one of these ﬁsh, a female, displayed consec- utive-year migrations, and utilised the same spawn- ing tributary in each year. prespawn mortalities and tag recovery prespawn mortalities and tag recoveries were those conﬁrmed or observed prior to 15 august in each year. in 2003, conﬁrmed prespawn mortalities (n = 2) and tag recoveries (n = 1) accounted for 12% of all prespawn radio-tagged ﬁsh (n = 25). during 2004, mortality signals were received from 11.5% (n = 3) of all prespawn radio-tagged ﬁsh (n = 26) although mortalities could not be conﬁrmed. one other radio- tag was recovered on 18 august, 2004 in a small tributary, but the fate this ﬁsh could not be determined prior to the spawning season. the carcass and radio- tag of one consecutive-year migrant that over-wintered in loon lake was recovered on the secesh river on 2 august, 2004. emigration from loon lake twelve radio-tagged bull trout emigrated out of loon lake during late june and early july 2004. contacts with ﬁsh in loon creek occurred within what was assumed to be a short time after emigration from loon lake. as such, three ﬁsh were located either in loon creek or in the secesh river at the mouth of loon creek on 25 june, representing the earliest observed date of emigration. these three ﬁsh were consecutive year migrants, one of which was tagged in 2004. nine of the 12 migrants emigrated from loon lake by 2 july, with the latest dates of emigration occurring between 2 and 9 july. sample sizes were too small to determine precise dates of emigration or migration rates. migration periodicity sixteen ﬁsh tagged in 2003 were relocated in 2004, yet only six of these ﬁsh (ﬁve bull trout and one hybrid) migrated in 2004. another bull trout that was pit tagged and identiﬁed as a female in 2003 was recaptured and radio-tagged in loon lake in june 2004. six of these seven consecutive-year migrants over-wintered in loon lake whereas the other ﬁsh was located in the secesh river prior in the seven consecutive-year november 2004. of migrants in 2004, two females utilised spawning tributaries, another ﬁsh was repeatedly located in lake to winter 238 creek, but was not observed in a spawning tributary, and one ﬁsh was a prespawn mortality. incomplete data for three other ﬁsh made it impossible to assess their true migratory periodicity. spawning activity no radio-tagged ﬁsh were observed spawning in either tributary (i.e. pete creek or threemile creek) located in the upper secesh river watershed, although a few did display spawning behaviours such as pairing and chasing. spawning locations and period were condi- tional upon locations of radio-tagged ﬁsh relative to observations of nontagged ﬁsh. redds were observed independent of radio-tagged ﬁsh locations in both years. the ﬁrst paired ﬁsh were observed on 18 august, 2003 and 27 july, 2004. in all, 11 redds were positively identiﬁed between 24 august and 21 september, 2003 and three redds were positively identiﬁed between 17 august and 1 september, 2004. radio-tagged ﬁsh remained in spawning tributaries until at least 23 and 26 august, 2003 and 2004 respectively. in 2003, one radio-tagged ﬁsh remained in a spawning tributary until at least 21 september, the latest such observation in both years. postspawning movements and mortalities in 2003, 37 of 39 ﬁsh were contacted in loon lake (n = 20), the secesh river (n = 11), loon creek (n = 3) and the sfsr (n = 3). in all, 24 (57%) postspawning migrants were transmitting mortality signals in november 2003. in 2004, six of 12 migrant ﬁsh survived postspawning migrations. four of these six surviving ﬁsh were captured and tagged in loon lake, two of which returned to loon lake by 8 september displaying over-wintering site ﬁdelity. the other two of these four ﬁsh were located in the secesh river by 15 september. two other migratory ﬁsh that were initially captured in lake creek were located in the secesh river on 8 september. one of these two ﬁsh made the single longest individual migration of any radio-tagged ﬁsh, travelling a total distance of 113.3 km and was last located near the mouth of the sfsr (fig. 6). two consecutive-year migrants which over-wintered in loon lake were relocated in loon lake during september; both transmitted mortality signals in october 2004. over-wintering radio-tagged bull trout over-wintered in loon lake, the lower secesh river (below loon creek), and the lower sfsr (below the mouth of the secesh river). in all, 22 of 41 ﬁsh (54%) were either last located in loon lake in november 2003, or were relocated in adﬂuvial and ﬂuvial life histories and migrations of bull trout in idaho loon lake in june 2004; the one radio-tagged hybrid also evidently over-wintered in loon lake. fourteen of these ﬁsh survived in loon lake until at least june 2004. two consecutive-year migrants demonstrated over-wintering site ﬁdelity by returning to loon lake in september 2004. in 2004, 17 of 22 (77%) ﬁsh captured and tagged in loon lake during june were relocated in loon lake during october. three of these 17 were migratory bull that survived the spawning season and demonstrated over-wintering site ﬁdelity by returning to loon lake. postspawning mortalities of ﬁsh in the secesh river made it difﬁcult to assess actual over-wintering locations for these ﬁsh, which were identiﬁed as ﬂuvial migrants. trout stream temperature maximum water temperatures did not exceed 15.0 °c in either spawning tributary during 2003 or 2004. average daily water temperatures did not exceed 12.0 °c at either site. average weekly water temper- atures fell below 9.0 °c in both spawning tributaries during the period when bull trout were ﬁrst observed spawning in 2003 and 2004. discussion the unusual and unexpected downstream–upstream adﬂuvial migration patterns exhibited by secesh river bull trout whereby ﬁsh migrated downstream from a lake to a larger river system, migrated upstream to spawning areas during spring and summer, spawned or staged, migrated downstream in the river to a tributary, and migrated upstream to a lake in the fall to over- winter (figs 2 and 3), are in sharp contrast to typical adﬂuvial migrations. typical adﬂuvial migrations are a series of upstream movements from a lake or reservoir to upriver spawning locations followed by a return downstream to the lake or reservoir of origin (e.g. fraley & shepard 1989; howell & buchanan 1992; mackay et al. 1997; brewin et al. 2001). we found only two cases of downstream–upstream spawning migrations in the literature for bull trout (carson 2001; hogen & scarnecchia 2006), and one similar case for anadromous dolly varden (armstrong 1974). in southeast alaska, anadromous dolly varden were observed to migrate downstream to the ocean from over-wintering locations in a lake system, to feed in the ocean during summer, to then migrate upstream into an unrelated nonlake system to their natal stream to spawn, and then migrate downstream to the ocean before returning upstream in a lake system to over- winter (armstrong 1974). carson (2001) described a ﬂuvial migration pattern which he observed in two ﬁsh that were captured upstream of their spawning tributary in the mccleod river, alberta. these bull trout made subsequent downstream migrations, entered a tributary to apparently spawn and returned to their previous upstream capture location to over- winter. similarly, hogen & scarnecchia (2006) observed ﬁve adﬂuvial migrants move downstream from the glory hole, a small (2 ha) ﬂooded mine pit in the efsfsr, idaho enter a tributary to apparently spawn, and migrate upstream to the glory hole to over-winter. the glory hole has only been present for 60 years, suggesting that this particular migration pattern developed recently in the neighbouring type of downstream– efsfsr watershed. this upstream migration pattern observed for bull trout was a minor component in both studies. loon lake, a 60 ha high mountain lake in the secesh river watershed (fig. 1), is evidently of greater importance for secesh river ﬁsh than is the glory hole for efsfsr ﬁsh (hogen & scarnecchia 2006). results from radio-tagged ﬁsh indicated that the utilisation of loon lake for over-wintering, inter- seasonal staging, and possible juvenile rearing leads to a major adﬂuvial component of bull trout life history in the secesh river, whereas utilisation of the glory hole in the nearby efsfsr led to only a minor adﬂuvial component (hogen & scarnecchia 2006). over-wintering in loon lake by consecutive-year migrants during successive years also indicated ﬁdelity to this habitat. this behaviour was evidenced by two consecutive-year migrants (fig. 2), and three of four surviving in-season migrants initially captured in loon lake during 2004 which survived to return to the lake in the fall (fig. 3). fish remaining in loon lake through the summer did not migrate (fig. 4) and utilised loon lake for inter-seasonal staging, indica- tive of either nonconsecutive-year migrations or juvenile rearing. adﬂuvial life history strategies have also been found to be common in other watersheds in the region (e.g. the clark fork watershed, dunham et al. 2001; neraas & spruell 2001) where streams have low productivity and lakes are important com- ponents of the watersheds. in typical high-elevation idaho watersheds where riverine productivity is low, the adﬂuvial life history strategy, where possible, may be favoured by providing opportunities for more rapid growth, larger size and higher fecundity, much as anadromy functions for many other salmonids (gross 1987; mcdowall 2001). the precise mechanisms by which adﬂuvial patterns of secesh river bull trout developed are unknown. migratory life history strategies in the charrs have been characterised as exploratory adaptations, having evolved from re-colonisation and dispersal following retreating glaciers along glacial margins where habitats were cold, unproductive and highly unpredictable (power 2002). colonisation and dispersal are adaptive 239 watry & scarnecchia mechanisms of exploration that favour migration as a means to opportunistically exploit available resources (northcote 1978; power 2002). exploratory migra- tions can also help organisms maintain spatial diver- sity by extending their range beyond the limits of familiar spatial units, while retaining the ability to return to those familiar areas (baker 1978). bull trout in the secesh river have evolved with a persistent kokanee population in loon lake, a relict of an anadromous sockeye population now thought to be extinct. exploratory migrations could have mediated the development of these unusual adﬂuvial patterns in response to abundant food resources in loon lake. olfaction is one mechanism that could explain the detection of upstream productive habitats in loon lake (nordeng 1977; na¨slund 1992). further research is needed to identify the ecological mechanisms involved with the development of these migration patterns. fluvial migration patterns (figs 5 and 6) closely resembled those observed by hogen & scarnecchia (2006) in the efsfsr. typical ﬂuvial migrations are characterised by a series of upstream movements from a large river to a headwater tributary for staging or spawning, followed by a return to the large river of origin, often near the previous over-wintering location (e.g. elle et al. 1994; mcleod & clayton 1997; swanberg 1997; burrows et al. 2001; clayton 2001; hvenegaard & thera 2001). trout the variable life history strategies as manifested through migration patterns observed for secesh river bull trout are similar to those of other bull trout stocks and other charrs. a wide array of bull life histories among stocks in different localities have been documented, including adﬂuvial (fraley & shepard 1989; olmstead et al. 2001), ﬂuvial (hogen & scar- necchia 2006), resident (chandler et al. 2001; nelson et al. 2002) and perhaps anadromy (baker et al. 2003) in addition to some specialised adaptations such as outlet spawning (herman 1997). the present study and that of hogen & scarnecchia (2006) indicate that such variations also exist within stocks, and can develop over short periods of time as opportunities for colonisation and improved feeding arise. moreover, even greater variations in life history strategies have been reported for sympatric arctic charr (e.g. thing- vallavatn, iceland: sandlund et al. 1987; sku´ lason et al. 1996; greenland: riget et al. 1986; western canada: reist 1989; norway: hindar & jonsson 1993; svalbard: gulseth & nilssen 2001). the low survival rate of secesh river bull trout with the longer lived tags, the brief (2-year) duration of the study, and the lack of observations of spawning radio- tagged ﬁsh made inferences regarding migration and spawning frequency difﬁcult. however, nonconsecu- tive-year migrations predominated in this study. only 240 two radio-tagged females were determined to be consecutive-year migrants that utilised spawning trib- utaries; both of these ﬁsh over-wintered in loon lake. as in the stationary adﬂuvial migration pattern, nonconsecutive-year migrations are similar to a com- mon stationary ﬂuvial pattern reported by hogen & scarnecchia (2006). in alberta, canada, female bull trout tended to display a higher postspawning survival and an increased incidence of consecutive-year spawning than males (mccart 1997; clayton 2001). mccart (1997) noted that nonconsecutive-year spawn- ing was typical when multiple years were required to accumulate sufﬁcient energy stores for the demands of gamete production, migration and spawning. it is likely that consecutive-year migrations are sufﬁciently stressful to make it a subordinate strategy to noncon- secutive-year migrations in the secesh river. in the kakwa river, alberta 67% of bull tracked through more than two successive seasons displayed a tendency toward nonconsecutive-year spawning, while 22% displayed a variation of consecutive-year spawn- ing with nonspawning years in the sequence of years tracked (hvenegaard & thera 2001). trout not all migrations observed in this study were necessarily related to spawning. some ﬁsh between 300 and 350 mm fl, in addition to some consecutive- year migrants, did not make movements consistent with spawning migrations, but instead remained in lake creek or the lower reaches of spawning tribu- taries during the spawning period. elle et al. (1994) observed upstream migrants between 300 and 380 mm tl that did not appear to spawn in the rapid river, idaho. hogen & scarnecchia (2006) observed nons- pawning ﬂuvial migrations for three consecutive-year migrants that did not enter spawning tributaries during their second year migrations in the efsfsr. burrows et al. (2001) reported nonspawning migrations in the halfway and peace rivers, alberta, and attributed these migrations as movements to feeding habitats. several species reportedly move onto salmon spawn- ing grounds to prey on out-migrating fry during periods of juvenile migration, or feed on eggs during the spawning season (northcote 1978). swanberg (1997) also observed nonspawning bull trout in the lower reaches of tributaries, downstream of known spawning areas, but associated these movements with the selection of thermal refugia near coldwater springs during periods of increasing water temperatures in the mainstem blackfoot river, montana. other studies have also observed patterns of nonspawning migra- tions for ﬂuvial bull trout (mcleod & clayton 1997; clayton 2001). consequently, nonspawning migra- tions are an important component of bull trout life histories, and in the secesh river environmental conditions may promote this strategy in response to resource availability and habitat quality. adﬂuvial and ﬂuvial life histories and migrations of bull trout in idaho in contrast to the unusual adﬂuvial migratory pattern observed for secesh river bull trout, results of several other aspects of this study were consistent with results reported elsewhere. for example, the low incidence of prespawn mortalities (7%) and tag loss (3%) were similar to those observed in other studies (schill et al. 1994; swanberg 1997), as were the high (49%) overall mortality rates (schill et al. 1994; chandler et al. 2001; hogen & scarnecchia 2006). similarly, average water temperatures in spawning tributaries during the spawning period (<9 °c) were consistent with those reported for the species. spawn- ing typically occurs at temperatures <9 °c (mcphail & murray 1979; shepard et al. 1984; fraley & shepard 1989), while temperatures <15 °c have been consis- tently recognised as the single most inﬂuential factor affecting bull trout distribution (rieman & mcintyre 1993). the rapid emigration out of spawning tributar- ies observed in this study is also consistent with reported observations for bull trout. swanberg (1997) reported that most bull trout in the blackfoot river drainage, montana began their downstream migration shortly after spawning was completed. hogen & scarnecchia (2006) reported rapid downstream migra- tions of up to 106.4 km in a week in the efsfsr, and schill et al. (1994) reported postspawning downstream migration rates of approximately 4.8 km per day in the rapid river, idaho. management implications spawning habitats) results of the present study and that of hogen & scarnecchia (2006) demonstrate that the secesh river and the efsfsr are two distinct stocks (i.e. have distinct even though ﬂuvial migrants of both stocks share the same winter habitat in the lower sfsr (fig. 1). secondly, bull trout in the low productivity sfsr sub-basin will opportunisti- cally use large rivers, lakes or small man-made impoundments whenever available. the variable and distinct life history strategies of bull trout in the secesh and efsfsr is consistent with the concept of metapopulation biology where spatially structured populations exist as an assortment of discrete local populations with connectivity among the populations that could allow for the reestablishment of local popu- lations following extinction (hanski 1991; hanski & gilpin 1997). consequently, the spatial diversity and range of life histories observed in the sfsr sub-basin may confer long-term persistence, especially in highly variable environments (simberloff 1988; thorpe 1994; stowell et al. 1996). management of bull trout in the sfsr sub-basin will require active management of a variety of habitats, including loon lake in the secesh river, the glory hole in the efsfsr, over-wintering and migration the greatest potential for corridors in the larger main stem sfsr, and small spawning tributaries throughout. acknowledgements we thank the u. s. forest service, payette national forest for funding and logistical support, with special thanks to c. zurstadt for contributions in all aspects of this study and j. jimenez for initiating this study. d. hogen offered his intimate knowledge of bull trout in the efsfsr, and r. nelson provided data. j. nagler and t. cochnauer provided constructive comments and review. r. lothrop, c. klingler and r. banks provided valuable ﬁeld assistance. d. faurot, r. kinzer and t. covel of the nez perce tribe department of fishery resource management provided signiﬁcant ﬁeld assistance and data. t. salow of the u. s. bureau of reclamation provided telemetry equipment in addition to helpful advice and knowledge. references armstrong, r.h. 1974. migration of anadromous dolly varden (salvelinus_malma) in southeastern alaska. journal of the fisheries research board of canada 31: 435–444. baker, r.r. 1978. the evolutionary ecology of animal migration. new york, ny: holmes and meier publishers. baker, j.d., moran, p. & ladley, r. 2003. nuclear dna identiﬁcation of migrating bull trout captured at the puget sound energy diversion dam on the white river, washing- ton state. molecular ecology 12: 557–561. behnke, r.j. 1980. a systematic review of the genus salvelinus. in: balon, e.k., ed. charrs: salmonid ﬁshes of the genus salvelinus. hague, the netherlands: dr w. junk publishers, pp. 441–480. behnke, r.j. 1984. organizing the diversity of the arctic charr complex. in: johnson, l. & burns, b.l., eds. biology of the arctic charr, proceedings of the international symposium on arctic charr. winnipeg, manitoba: university of manitoba press, canada, pp. 3–21. brewin, m.k., paul, a.j. & monita, m. 2001. bull trout ii conference proceedings. calgary, alberta: trout unlimited canada. burrows, j., euchner, t. & baccante, n. 2001. bull trout movement patterns: halfway river and peace river progress. in: brewin, m.k., paul, a.j. & monita, m., eds. bull trout ii conference proceedings. calgary, alberta: trout unlimited canada, pp. 153–157. carson, r.j. 2001. bull trout spawning movements and homing behaviour back to pre-spawning locations in the mccleod river, alberta. in: brewin, m.k., paul, a.j. & monita, m., eds. bull trout ii conference proceedings. calgary, alberta: trout unlimited canada, pp. 137–140. trout, salvelinus conﬂuentus cavender, t.m. 1978. taxonomy and distribution of the bull from the american northwest. california fish and game 64: 139– 174.
