(i.e., the number of elliott (1987) and elliott & hurley (1998) examined a high-density anadromous and a low-density resident populations in two nearby uk streams and showed that in the high density, sea-trout population, recruit- ment juveniles entering the population to commence a new year-class) was regulated by a dome-shaped density-dependent mor- tality acting on the younger juveniles related to the initial abundance of eggs. however, recruitment regulation in the juvenile stage was absent in the low-density, resident population where simple propor- tionate survival occurred in the early life stages. in this low-density population however, the initial abundance of the spawning females and their eggs eventually regulated the abundance of females 3 or 4 years later through delayed density dependence. in both popula- tions, density-dependent mechanisms accounted for 394 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00111.x just under half the variation in recruitment between generations, implying that density-independent factors were responsible for the remaining variation (elliott 1994; elliott & hurley 1998). the operation of such density-dependent regulatory mechanisms contrasted markedly with the environ- mentally driven population size evidenced for resident in north-western spain, where stream brown_trout discharge at the time of, or just after, emergence determined the survival rates of the youngest juveniles (lobo´n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004). moreover, stream discharge appeared to be the synchronising agent of recruitment over a substantially larger geographical scale (i.e., across streams within a cantabrian river drainage) to the extent that the effects of discharge on recruitment were reﬂected by the spawning component of the population throughout the river drainage 2 years later (lobo´n-cervia´ 2004). effective management for sustainable populations requires understanding the cyclical nature of popula- tion abundance, the conditions under which sets of density-dependent versus density-independent factors predominate, the relative strength of population regu- lation factors and the spatial ranges for their predom- inance. although evidence on the mechanisms underlying abundance of stream-living brown_trout exists research to identify the conditions under which these mechanisms operate and their geographical ranges is lacking and warrant further investigation. the present long-term study examines the factors and mechanisms underlying year-to-year variation in the numerical abundance of the high-density popula- tion of brown_trout in bisballe baek, a nursery stream for a lake-migratory population in central jutland (denmark). the analysis of the extensive data set encompassing 17 successive year-classes and associ- ated environmental variables highlighted the import- ance of environmental conditions for determining the survival rates of the youngest juveniles and hence, population size. these ﬁndings concurred with those previously documented for resident brown_trout in a spanish stream and emphasise the importance of density-independent factors for within and among-population variation in the numerical abundance of stream-living brown_trout. low-density, material and methods bisballe baek is a 450 m long stream ﬂowing into dollerup baek about 200 m before the latter enters lake hald (river gudenaa drainage, central jutland, denmark). bisballe baek is a nursery for the progeny of lake hald-dwelling brown_trout from where large size (30–60 cm long) adult females immigrate to spawn. the physiography, water quality and other stream characteristics are favourable for spawning and population size in juveniles of s. trutta growth of brown_trout (armstrong et al. 2003). a 170 m long stream section (area ¼ 146 m2, ranges of width and depth ¼ 0.15–1.5 m and 5–20 cm, respect- ively) located at a mid-distance from the stream mouth was selected to track long-term trends in population size. every winter, visual observations from the stream bank indicated spawning females and redds within the study site and recruits were observed to derive from those redds. the 17 year-classes hatched during the years 1974–1990 were tracked from just after emer- gence to their total disappearance from the stream (except 1990). monthly census data were obtained by applying the three-removal method with electroﬁshing techniques (lobo´n-cervia´ 1991). to obtain detailed information on emergence time and annual recruitment magnitudes, sampling was conducted during the last week of march to early april (27 march to 3 april) and continued every 30 days (range 25–45 days) from 1974 to 1992. the only exceptions occurred during the severe winter months (december to february) of the years 1978, 1979 and 1982 when sampling was delayed for 90–120 days. all ﬁshes captured were measured (standard length, mm), weighted (g) and returned to the study site. densities were estimated separately for age-0, age-1 and older individuals, and were expressed as the number of individuals per unit of sampling area (i.e., numbers per 146 m2). further details on the sampling methods, including those used for age and growth determinations, are provided in mortensen (1977, 1985). year-classes are referred to by the year of recruit- ment. for the purpose of this study, recruitment is deﬁned as the abundance of juveniles at the start of a new year-class and is assumed to be the ﬁrst numerical census (i.e., 1-month-old juveniles) of each new year- class. mean year-class density or the mean density of individuals in a year-class averaged from the second quantitative sample (i.e., once recruitment was exclu- ded) to the last observed individuals was used as a measure of year-class individu- als m strength (ycs, )2). daily environmental temperatures and rainfall were recorded by a local gauging station (i.e., 21310 stanghede, silkeborg) whereas stream water temper- atures were recorded with a maximum–minimum thermometer placed at a downstream section of the study site (mortensen 1985). the gauging station stopped working in 1988. in addition, stream temper- atures were not recorded during the spring (april to may) of 1979. thus, this study encompasses rainfall data for the years 1974–1987 and three additional years (1988–1990, except 1979) for stream temperatures (table 1). as no stream ﬂow data were available, rainfall was used as surrogate of stream discharge. the analysis of 395 lobo´n-cervia´ & mortensen table 1. sampling dates previous to (d1) and at the time

varied within a range of 6.6–7.9° c over the years 1974–1990 (table 1). in contrast, monthly rainfall showed a 20-fold variation among years, ranging from 5.2 mm in the 1987 to a maximum of 97.7 mm in 1978 (table 1). there was a signiﬁcant, inverse relationship between water temperature (t°c) and rainfall (rf, mm) indicating that 33% of the variation in temperature could be explained by variation in rainfall (fig. 1). this suggested that, among the various factors inﬂuencing water tempera- ture, rainfall-induced discharge variations affected temperature with warmer waters in years of reduced discharge. yet, other factors accounted for 67% of the variation. 396 87 74 80 82 84 81 78 85 83 75 77 86 76 ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t 0.88 0.86 0.84 0.82 0.80 0.4   0.8   1.2   1.6   2.0   2.4

variations in rainfall 62% (p < 0.001) of the variations in recruitment and year-class strength respectively (fig. 3b). 73% (p < 0.001) explained and discussion this study revealed temporal covariation of rainfall and stream water temperature with years of lower rainfall being related to higher stream temperatures. this resulted in substantial year-to-year variation in annual recruitment that, in turn, appeared to be a major determinant of ycs of bisballe baek brown_trout. these ﬁndings strongly suggest that the immediate factor determining population size is recruitment with annual magnitudes ultimately determined by the combined effects of those two environmental factors. clearly, rainfall does not operate directly on brown_trout individuals but through its overwhelming inﬂu- ence on stream discharge. thus, rainfall-dependent recruitment is translated into discharge-dependent population size in juveniles of s. trutta recruitment. as mentioned in the introduction, lobo´n- cervia´ & rinco´ n (2004) showed that annual recruitment in rio chaballos (north-western spain) population was determined by the abundance of microhabitats suitable for the youngest juveniles whose annual availability was imposed by discharge conditions at the time of, or soon after, emergence. the effects of discharge on recruitment in rio chaballos and other nearby popula- tions were sufﬁciently strong to determine ycs inde- pendently of the relative contribution of the various density-dependent and density-independent factors operating on survival during the whole lifetime (lob- o´n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004). hence, temporal variations in population size were governed essentially by the operation of discharge on recruitment and of recruit- ment on ycs (lobo´n-cervia´ 2004). links between discharge the patterns elucidated for bisballe beck brown_trout relating discharge with recruitment and recruit- ment with ycs fully matched the patterns previously elucidated for rio chaballos and suggests the occurrence of similar mechanisms underlying tempor- al variations in the numerical abundance of these two populations. these patterns are consistent with func- tional and recruitment reported for other stream populations across the european range of brown_trout, including its three major life-history modes (resident, anadromous and lake-migratory) across regions comprising northern (solomon & paterson 1980; jensen & johnsen 1999; ma¨ki-peta¨ys et al. 1999), central (cattane`o et al. 2002) and southern latitudes (lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´ n 2004); and are further consistent with introduced populations (spina 2001). however, a major diver- gence between the two populations concerns the shape of the recruitment–discharge relationships. while in bisballe beck, recruitment declined curvilinearly with increasing discharge, in rio chaballos, recruitment described a two phase trajectory: recruitment increased with increasing discharge up to a point at which the direction of the trajectory switched towards a continu- ous decline of recruitment with increasing discharge. interestingly, few studies but elliott (1985) have documented temperature effects on recruitment or density of stream brown_trout. this is dissatisfying and appears to be at odds with current research. experi- mental studies on salmonids and other ﬁshes have emphasised the importance of temperature for egg size (chambers 1997) beyond the maternal effects on egg size and number (lobo´ n-cervia´ et al. 1997; einum & fleming 1999). temperature has been shown to inﬂuence the temporal duration of embryonic devel- opment length of hatching period (crisp 1981; elliott 1984), survival rates before and after hatching (ojanguren & bran˜a 2003) and emergence time (elliott 1984). in addition, temperature may inﬂuence larvae size at hatching (jungwirth & winkler 1984), 397 lobo´n-cervia´ & mortensen a 87 b 18.0 15.0 87 18.0 15.0 12.0 ) 2 –  m d n i ( t n e m t i u r c e

(lawson et al. 2004), salvelinus_fontinalis (mitchell) (mcrae & diana 2005), coregonus_albula (l.) (marjomaki et al. 2004), allosa fallax (lac.) (apprahamian & appraha- mian 2001), perca ﬂuviatilis l. (tolonen et al. 2003), stizostedium lucioperca (l.) (lehtonen & lappalainen 398 1995), micropterus dolomieu lac. (christie & regier 1973), leuciscus leuciscus (l.) (mann & mills 1986), rutilus rutilus (l.) (grenouillet et al. 2001), several cyprinids (mann 1996; nunn et al. 2003), and numer- ous marine species (beaugrand et al. 2003; fowler & jennings 2003; planque et al. 2003; mackenzie & ko¨ster 2004; magill & sayer 2004). why do temperature effects on stream brown_trout abundance remain elusive? the studies above suggest that the operation of temperature and discharge on the earliest life stages might occur within a very short time period, and act on two closely related but different life stages. while temperature seems to be of major importance at the egg stage, at hatching, just before or at emergence; stream discharge determining the abundance of microhabitats suitable for the youngest individuals operates soon after emergence, when individuals move from the redds in search of feeding positions. this can make the isolation of temperature effects difﬁcult to be detected. most importantly, the critical operation of discharge in determining the actual number of survivors may obscure the former effects of temperature when age-0 individuals are quantiﬁed at some postrecruit or juvenile stage. moreover, little year-to-year variation in water tem- perature can make temperature effects detectable only when the time series analysed are long enough to capture the extremes of cold versus warm tempera- tures. this appeared to be the case of bisballe baek where the warmer temperatures that enhanced recruit- ment in 1974 were only observed 13 years later in the years 1987, 1989 and 1990. either of these reasons or their combinations might probably explain the elusive character of temperature. to density-independent to human-induced alterations), relative to the temporal stability expected to occur in populations regulated by endogenous feedbacks whose numerical abundances are essentially independ- ent of environmental variations (and hence, more trends in resistant populations subject factors are unstable in time because of unpredictable envi- ronmental (climatic) conditions. this particularly holds for the stream brown_trout populations of this study composed of no more than 3 to 4 age-classes upon which prolonged periods of harsh environmental conditions might drive the population at risk. how- ever, distinctly shaped recruitment–discharge relation- ship elucidated for rio chaballos and bisballe baek also appeared relevant for the temporal persistence of these environmentally driven populations. recruitment in years of the two phase trajectory of recruitment versus discharge in rio chaballos brown_trout predicts the extinction of this population if and when either too dry or too rainy springs persist during several years. in marked contrast, the single, negative power trajectory elucidated for bisballe baek indicated greater variations of low discharge relative to years of high discharge. that is, minor variations under high discharge conditions when recruitment is located at the lower, right side wing of the curve. at the opposite extreme of that trajectory, drought years might reduce water current or discharge and enhance temperature. then, recruit- )2 relative ment attained magnitudes up to 16 ind m )2 in years of lower tempera- to only 1.3–1.7 ind m ture and higher discharge. thus, water temperature appears to act as a buffer to offset the negative inﬂuence of lower discharge. such trade-off may permit the population to respond to environmental variability and thus to persist in time. resumen 1. el objetivo de este estudio fue identiﬁcar los factores y mecanismos que determinan variaciones temporales en

reproduccio´n de inmigrantes reproductores de gran taman˜o (30–60 cm) procedentes del lago hald. los juveniles, tras permanecer en el rı´o unos 1000–1400 dı´as desde la emergencia, esmoltiﬁcan y emigran al lago hald. 2. el ana´lisis de las 17 cohortes nacidas en los an˜os 1974–1990 revelo´ que el taman˜o de poblacio´ n esta´ determinado esencial- mente por el reclutamiento (la cantidad anual de juveniles que comienzan una nueva cohorte) que, a su vez, esta´ determinado por dos factores ambientales: el caudal y la temperatura del rı´o. 3. estos patrones son similares a los observados en una poblacio´ n residente localizada a ma´s de 2500 km de distancia (i.e., el rı´o chaballos, noroeste de espan˜a). estos resultados enfatizan la importancia de factores independientes de la densidad (i.e., variabilidad ambiental) como agentes regulado- res del taman˜o de poblacio´n en truchas de rı´o. 4. no obstante, las trayectorias de las relaciones caudal- reclutamiento diﬁrieron entre ambas poblaciones lo que sugiere mecanismos diferenciados para responder a las condiciones ambientales y por lo tanto, para persistir en el tiempo. acknowledgements the data set of this study was collected
