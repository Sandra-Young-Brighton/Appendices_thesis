(2007) found that mt had lower growth when competing with bt and hybrids, which may indicate that the presence of either hybrids or bt stresses mt, pre- sumably due to their higher level of activity. in response to a stressor such as crowding, a fish will undergo a series of biochemical and physiological changes in an attempt to cope with the stress (iwama et al. 2006). the relationship between density during the first growth period and body length through the lifetime was well described by negative power curves (vincenzi et al. 2007b, 2008a,b, 2010a). the physio- logical adjustments to stress are geared towards increased tissue oxygen availability and metabolic energy substrate mobilisation and utilisation, to cope with the increased energy demand (barton et al. 2002). data and insights on the physiology and bio- chemistry of mt and hybrids are still lacking. the goal of this study was to investigate the bio- chemical and physiological characteristics of pure mt and bt and their hybrids to recognise their meta- bolic specificities. due to the observed ecological dif- ferences between the mt and bt (meldgaard et al. 2007), we expected that the early life history stages of mt and bt and their hybrids have different meta- bolic properties that are reflected in their success in particular environmental conditions. for that purpose, the size of experimental organisms, survival, hatching time, metabolic potential of unfertilised eggs, meta- bolic potential and respiration rate of eggs at the eyed stage and of larvae of mt, bt and their hybrids were measured. our results provide useful information on the optimal conditions for breeding mt and demon- strate the most favourable conditions for its success- ful reintroduction into the wild. 142 materials and methods collection and stripping of spawners (bt) (3 years of age, seven females of genetically pure marble trout from stream zadlascica (3 and 4 years of (mt) lengths 22.8–30.6 cm) and five females of age, pure brown_trout lengths 19.5–22.8 cm) from stream podbreg were stripped in december 2002 (fig. 1). the stripped eggs were stored in plastic bags in a cooling box. for each stripped female, two males (one from each species) were stripped. sperm of each male was collected in the eppendorf tubes and stored in ice-cold water in a cooling box. eggs and sperm were transported to a trout hatchery (valisce modrej), where eggs of each female were counted. half were afterwards fertilised with sperm of marble and half with sperm of brown_trout to provide offspring of mt, bt, and the two types of hybrids (mh = female of mt 9 male of bt and bh = female of bt 9 male of mt). fig. 1. locations of genetically pure populations of salmo_marmoratus in slovenia. 1 – zadlascica, 2 – lipovscek, 3 – huda grapa, 4 – sevnica, 5 – studenc, 6 – trebuscica, 7 – idrijca. rearing of experimental animals after swelling (2 h), eggs were placed in specially created hatching tubes made of plastic tube (70 mm in diameter). tubes were 150 mm high, and 4 holes (25 mm in diameter) were drilled in the middle. the bottom hole was covered with plastic net, mesh size 2 9 2 mm, attached to the bottom part of the tube with metallic ring. the four holes were covered with the same plastic net, attached to the tube with gluing tape. tubes were placed in hatching boxes where an up-welling water flow was created. the tops of the tubes were 30 mm above the water surface so the holes in the middle served as an outflow. embryos and larvae were reared in a trout hatchery supplied with river water at 10.5  1 °c from 5 december 2002 to 19 march 2003. during the first period of hatching, egg mortality was checked daily and dead eggs were removed. eyed eggs were analysed after 30 days of hatching, and larvae 22 days later. on the day of analysis, the larvae were placed in 500-ml plastic bottles filled with hatchery water and transported to the laboratory in a cooling box. meta- bolic potential was measured on the same day. to minimise the effect of transport and handling stress, the animals were resting for 6 h before the respiration rate measurements were started. int reduction capacity assay metabolic potential was measured using the procedure introduced by packard (1971) and modified by g.-toth et al. (1995). a single egg (n = 28 for mt, n = 20 for bt; n is number of samples; i.e., 4 replicates per female), eyed egg (n = 28 for mt and mh, n = 16 for bt and bh) or larva (n = 28 for mt and mh, n = 12 for bt and n = 8 for bh) was used for each analysis. each was homogenised in 4 ml 0.1 m sodium phos- phate buffer, ph = 8.4; 75 lm mgso4; 0.15% (w/v) polyvinyl pyrrolidone; 0.2% (v/v) triton-x-100) with a glass tissue homogeniser (ika, eurostar) for 2 min at 700 rpm. the homogenate was centrifuged for 4 min at 0 °c at 8500 g (sigma 2k15, st. louis, mo, usa). three 0.5 ml samples from each homogenate were incubated separately in 1.5 ml substrate solution (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph = 8.4; 1.7 mm nadh; 0.25 mm nadph; 0.2% (v/v) triton-x-100) with 0.5 ml 2.5 mm 2-p-iodo-phenyl 3-p-nitrophenyl 5-phenyl solution for 40 min at 10 °c. the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of stopping solution (1:1 formalin (conc.): conc. h3po4). blanks (substrate and int solution) were incubated and stopped as for the samples, and 0.5 ml of homogenate then added. formazan production was determined spectrophotometrically from the absor- bance of the sample at 490 nm against the blank tetrazolium chloride (int) ecophysiology of marble and brown_trout and hybrids (perkin-elmer, lambda 25, waltham, ma, usa). metabolic potential was measured as the rate of tetra- zolium dye reduction which was converted to equiva- lents of oxygen utilised per mass in a given time, as described by kenner & ahmed (1975). respiration rate measurement the intensity of respiration rate was measured by the closed bottle method (lampert 1984). ground glass stoppered bottles (300 ml) were filled with aer- ated water. three bottles with no animals served as controls, while five eyed eggs (n = 18 for mt, n = 17 for mh, n = 11 for bt, n = 8 for bh) and two or three larvae (n = 18 for mt, n = 17 for mh, n = 11 for bt, n = 8 for bh) were placed in each test bottle where the larvae could actively moved. the bottles were stoppered and kept at 10 °c. after 17 to 19 h, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the experimental and control bottles was measured (membrane electrode by a polarographic sensor wtw oxi 320/set). in control bottles, the oxygen concentration was 8–9 mgl  1, and in experimental bottles not <4 mgl  1. the difference between the oxygen concentration in each experimental bottle and that in control bottles was taken as the amount of oxygen consumed by the animals. weighting was performed after to avoid stress. respiration experiment weighing before weighing, eggs (n = 20–28 for single spe- cies), eyed eggs (n = 16–28 for each group) and lar- vae (n = 8–28) were rinsed with double-distilled water to remove organic matter and bacteria. eggs and eyed eggs were placed between two sheets of fil- ter paper and gently pressed together to remove the water from their surface. larvae were placed on a sheet of filter paper and left for 10 s so that water from their surface was absorbed. they were then placed on a preweighed piece of aluminium foil and weighed on an electrobalance (sartorius bp 210 s) with 0.1 mg accuracy. determination of dry mass dry mass was determined for each stage of develop- ment for marble and brown_trout and both types of hybrids. samples of preweighed eggs (11–17 per sample), eyed eggs (4–16 per sample) and larvae (2– 10 per sample) were weighed, then dried for 24 h at 105 °c. the dry mass ratio, used in the calculations of dry mass-specific metabolic potential and respira- tion rate, was calculated from the ratio of wet mass to dry mass. 143 simcic et al. statistical methods student’s t-test, anova tukey’s hsd test and fisher’s exact tests were performed using microsoft excel and spss.13.0 (spss inc. chicago, il, usa). results mass of experimental organisms the dry mass of mt eggs was more than 70% (t-test, d.f. = 46, greater p < 0.001) (table 1). than that of bt eggs the groups (anova, the dry mass of eyed eggs differed significantly f3,87 = 55.15, between p < 0.001). mt eyed eggs were just a little heavier than mh eggs, and bt eyed eggs insignificantly heavier than bh eyed eggs (table 1). significant dif- ferences were observed between the masses of marble groups (mt and mh) and brown groups (bt and bh) (tukey’s hsd test, p < 0.01). larval dry mass differed significantly between the groups (f3,71 = 45.75; p < 0.001). mt larvae were heavier than mh larvae, and bt larvae heavier than bh larvae (table 1). there were significant differ- ences between the marble groups (mt and mh) and brown groups (bt and bh) (p < 0.01). the mass of mt larvae was also significantly greater than that of mh (p < 0.05). hatching time hatching times of larvae differed significantly between the groups (f3,18 = 85.84;

p < 0.001). it was highest in bh larvae, followed by bt, mh and mt larvae, with significant differences between mt and both bt and bh, and between mh and both bt and bh (p < 0.01) (fig. 3f). discussion ets/r ratio the ets/r ratio of eyed eggs ranged between 3.1 and 4.4 (fig. 3e). it was highest (i.e., the lowest use of metabolic capacity) in mh eyed eggs, followed by bt, bh and mt eyed eggs, although the differences were not significant (p > 0.05). the impact of introduced species on native ones through competition, hybridization and introgression depends on the metabolic characteristics of the intro- duced species as well as those of the hybrids. the results of this study show that the competitive ability of mt, bt and their hybrids can be explained on the 145 simcic et al. basis of their different biochemical and physiological characteristics, which result in differences in develop- ment and growth and, consequently, in their perfor- mance under particular environmental conditions. sizes of eggs, eyed eggs and larvae differed signif- icantly between mt and bt groups (table 1). as expected, the species with larger female size pro- duced larger eggs than smaller one. furthermore, the impact of different sized eggs was observed in the developmental stages of eyed eggs and larvae. more- over, in the present study, intensity of metabolism was calculated per dry mass of whole egg or larva, without considering the metabolically inert part of the total mass that varies between different species and between different sized animals or developmental stages of the same species. as metabolic rate in dif- ferent sized animals is not proportional to body mass but it varies with animal size allometrically (white & kearney 2014), it is reasonable to assume that the different sizes of studied species affect their meta- bolic traits. the int reduction capacity, in the previous studies often referred to as electron transport system (ets) activity, has been measured to estimate the metabolic potential in various groups of organisms (e.g., musko et al. 1995; gopalan et al. 1996; fanslow et al. 2001; simcic 2005; simcic et al. 2005, 2012, 2014; zagar et al. 2015), indicating the amount of oxygen consumption that would occur if all enzymes that consume oxygen functioned maximally (musko et al. 1995). the lower metabolic potential in mt than in bt in all three developmental stages, that is, nonfer- tilised eggs, eggs at eyed stage, and larvae (fig. 3a, b), indicates that mt have lower metabolic potential that could be used for the production of energy. moreover, mt larvae have a lower respiration rate than those of bt and of both types of hybrids (fig. 3d). thus, the higher metabolism in bt and in hybrids results in rapid development and growth. meldgaard et al. (2007) reported that individuals of mh of f1 generation were larger than those of pure mt in two large-scale in-stream experiments. they explained the observed interspecific differences in size by both heterosis and stress from hybrids. given that mt are more sedentary than bt (and, most prob- ably, also than hybrids), it is highly probable that coexistence is responsible for the observed difference in size. as size is an important factor for intra- and interspecific competition in trout, f1 hybrids could have an immediate advantage over both pure species, at least in the short term (meldgaard et al. 2007). the ratio between metabolic potential and respira- tion rate (ets/r) is a measure of the exploitation of the metabolic capacity (martinez 1992) and reflects the different ecological demands, plasticity and fit- ness of organisms (musko et al. 1995; fanslow et al. 146 2001; simcic 2005; simcic et al. 2005, 2012, 2014; zagar et al. 2015). ets/r ratios have been reported for five freshwater or anadromous (gopalan et al. 1996) and two tropical marine fish species (ikeda 1989), but there are no published data for salmonids that can be compared with our results. however, the ets/r ratios obtained in the present study (fig. 3e,f) are within the range of the values of ets/r for gob- ies (1.54) and pomacentrids (1.63) reported by ikeda (1989), and for walleye (sander vitreus (mitchill 1818)) (3.4), saugeye (a hybrid between walleye and sauger (sander canadensis (griffith & smith 1834))) (3.3), striped bass hybrid (morone saxatilis (wal- baum 1792)) largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides (lacepede 1802)) (4.2) and yellow perch (perca flavescens mitchill 1814) (6.7) reported by gopalan et al. larvae of mt, where a lower ets/r ratio was observed. the low ets/r ratio in mt (ets/r = 1) indicates maximal exploitation of in organisms with higher ets/r ratios, the capacity for elevated metabolism is maintained. it has been reported that maintaining the enzyme machinery for increased metabolic activity is an advantage (fanslow et al. 2001; simcic et al. 2005; zagar et al. 2015). the metabolic potential while, (1996), except (2.4), for in the present study, the different survival rates of early developmental stages between the pure species and their hybrids were not observed, although they differed significantly in size, which could be crucial for the survival of early life stages of salmonids (blaxter 1988; berg et al. 2001; hendry et al. 2001; marshall et al. 2010; rollinson & hutchings 2010). moreover, the size of organisms is important for their metabolic characteristics in terms of ensuring ade- quate production of energy under particular environ- mental conditions. high ets/r is the characteristic of animals with a wide ecological tolerance that have to cope with the varying environmental conditions (fanslow et al. 2001; simcic 2005; simcic et al. 2010, 2012). it is reasonable therefore to assume that smaller size concurrent with higher ets/r ratio would be an advantage in unfavourable conditions that cause increased respiration due to stress condi- tions. therefore, the larger egg size of mt concurrent with lower ets/r ratio is an advantage under favour- able environments), whereas the smaller sized larvae of mh, bt and bh are successful under more stressful conditions (i.e., streams at lower altitudes) in which the higher meta- bolic potential enables production of the energy required for metabolism. our results are in agreement with the findings of hendry et al. (2001) and berg et al. (2001), who reported that larger fish eggs are favoured in richer habitats, and with those of rollin- son & hutchings (2010) and of marshall et al. (2010) who evidenced the disadvantage of larger size conditions headwater (i.e., competitive exclusion theory predicts that species with the same resource requirements cannot occupy the same niche and that species with a high degree of niche overlap are competitors. physiological or behavioural characteristics of species determine their competitive ability (stoeckmann 2003). larvae spend several weeks in the gravel, while they develop and hatch from the eggs and transform into fry that emerge from the gravel. our results are in accord with those of blanc & chevassus (1978), who reported that all types of hybrids obtained from bt females with coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch (walbaum 1792)), atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l. 1758) and brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis (mitchill 1814)) had lengths of incubation period (i.e., from fertilisation to mid-hatching time) signifi- cantly longer than that of pure bt. in contrast to bt, the hatching time of the hybrid obtained from mt females had a shorter hatching time than that of pure mt. thus, the longer hatching time, and conse- quently later emergence of mt than of bt and hybrids, could be a disadvantage when competing for (2011) the numerical dominance of rainbow reported that trout lower altitudes suggests that while the low summer flow pattern of slovenian streams is favourable for rainbow trout invasion, the adaptation of mt to headwater environments may limit the invasion success of rainbow trout in head- waters. however, a previous study also showed that conservation efforts should focus on stocking mt in steep, fragmented streams, because they have higher fitness in those habitats than bt and hybrids (meld- gaard et al. 2007). the same resources. vincenzi et al. in streams at et al. in the early life history stages under unfavourable conditions. moreover, vincenzi (2007a) showed that egg density (eggsm  2) was the major determinant of survival from eggs to age 1 + for mt, where the relationship between survival from eggs to age 1 + and egg density was positively cor- related with rainfall, because more intense rainfalls increase stream flow and, consequently, a more suit- able habitat for mt. in conclusion, we have shown that mt have lower metabolic activity than bt. the lower metabolism in mt results in slower development and growth than in bt. in addition, mt and mh exhibit lower ets/r ratios than bt and bh. therefore, the higher meta- bolic activity and higher ets/r ratio in bt and hybrids could explain the different competitive ability between both trout species and their hybrids. the findings of this study are thus directly applicable to the management of pure marble trout populations. moreover, the combination of metabolic potential and respiration rate measurements indicates to be a useful tool for estimating metabolic properties in the ecophysiology of marble and brown_trout and hybrids early developmental stages of fish and can serve as a support for more effective fisheries management. acknowledgements the authors thank a. j. crivellı and s. vincenzi for construc- tive comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript, o. k. berg and an
