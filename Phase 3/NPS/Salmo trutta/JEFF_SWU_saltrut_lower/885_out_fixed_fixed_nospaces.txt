région réunion; office national de l’eau et de milieux aquatiques abstract amphidromous fish species reproduce in rivers, and their larvae immediately drift to the sea after hatching. most of these larvae survive in freshwater for a few days only, rapidly reaching sea water is thus essential. being of small size, especially among spe- cies of the sicydiinae subfamily, the larvae possess poor swimming abilities; their drift dynamics is considered to be mainly passive and influenced by flow conditions. the influence of daily fluctuations in flow regime on sicyopterus lagocephalus (sicydiinae) larval drift patterns was studied using drift nets at three sites along the dammed langevin river in reunion island. the river flow was stable at the upstream site when frequent anthropogenic river flow fluctuations were observed at the two sites down- stream to the dam. weak diel larval drift dynamics were detected at the upstream site and the first site under anthropogenic river flow conditions. in contrast, larval drift dynamics at the most downstream site was strongly influenced by anthropogenic daily fluctuations of discharge: the abundance of drifting larvae increased with peaks of discharge, regardless of the time. as higher mortality rates of drifting larvae were ob- served during discharge peaks, the benefit of a more rapid travel to the ocean associ- ated with these peaks should be lower than expected. it is concluded that peaks of discharge increase the number of larvae drifting to the sea probably due to higher physical constraints on the egg clutches, but also decrease the chance of survival for larvae that may be nonfully developed. k e y w o r d s diadromy, downstream migration, hydrology, mortality, sicydiinae, sicyopterus lagocephalus 1 |  introduction flow regime is a major environmental driver of riverine fish ecology (humphries, serafini, & king, 2002; winemiller, 1989). it notably influ- ences the downstream movement, or drift, of fish larvae between their hatching and nursery habitats (barthem, da costa, cassemiro, leite, & silva, 2014; pavlov, mikheev, lupandin, & skorobogatov, 2008). for example, high abundances of drifting larvae are frequently observed during periods of elevated river discharge (charteris, allibone, & death, 2003; næsje, jonssons, & skurdal, 1995). in addition to flow regime, larval behaviours may also, to some extent, influence larval drift (lechner, keckeis, & humphries, 2016). larvae of large size in low, steady flow conditions are either able to increase their downstream movements by swimming in the flow direction, or decrease it by swim- ming against the flow direction, or towards areas of low flow veloc- ity (lechner et al., 2014; pavlov et al., 2008). in contrast, small larvae mostly drift passively as their swimming capacities are limited (braaten et al., 2012; lechner et al., 2016). amphidromous fish species spawn in rivers. immediately after hatching, their larvae drift down to the sea and develop for months be- fore returning to freshwater (radtke, kinzie, & folsom, 1988; teichert, valade, grondin, et al., 2016). the different hatching (i.e. river) and 646  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:646–659. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdnursery (i.e. sea) habitats highlight the importance of the larval drift in the amphidromous life cycle. although some amphidromous species can spend their entire larval stage in freshwater (closs, smith, barry, & markwitz, 2003; hogan, blum, gilliam, bickford, & mcintyre, 2014), for many other species their survival time in freshwater varies from 1 to 7 days only (iguchi & mizuno, 1999; valade et al., 2009). as these larvae must reach the sea within a constrained time window to suc- cessfully develop, reducing the period of drifting between their hatch- ing habitats and the sea thus appears to be essential for limiting their mortality. among amphidromous species, the gobies of the sicydiinae sub- family are a species- rich group of more than 100 described species (taillebois et al., 2014). these species mainly occur in small tropical islands. the swimming abilities of their larvae are limited by their small size, which never exceeds 2 mm notochord length at hatching (iida, watanabe, & tsukamoto, 2013; kinzie, 1993; valade et al., 2009; yamasaki & tachihara, 2006). once they hatch, the larvae present a single type of behaviour: “swim up–sink down” (bell & brown, 1995). the drifting mode of sicydiinae larvae thus could be considered as mainly passive, and therefore, the flow regime and the eventual spawning strategies of adults are probably the only two factors affect- ing the time of larval freshwater drift. for sicydiinae species, a downstream spawning migration of adults has been hypothesised as one of the strategies aimed to reduce the time that larvae drift in freshwater environment. indeed, the release of eggs in proximity to the estuary would reduce the distance between spawning grounds and sea. this hypothesis has been developed by lord, tabouret, claverie, pécheyran, and keith (2011) based on the variations in otolith elemental composition in adults of sicyopterus lagocephalus and s. aiensis in vanuatu rivers. however, a recent study focused on the migration of adults and juveniles of two sicydiinae species, including s. lagocephalus, in tropical rivers (lagarde, teichert, boussarie, grondin, & valade, 2015), suggested that the downstream displacements of adults depend solely on hydrological disturbances during cyclonic floods. if spawning location is not intended to reduce the time spent by larvae in freshwater, the only strategy for reach- ing the ocean more rapidly would be that larvae drift faster, mainly during periods of elevated river discharge. indeed, the increase in flow velocity associated with elevated discharge could significantly reduce the time larvae spend in rivers. this hypothesis of synchrony between larval drift peak and elevated discharge is supported by ob- servations made by way, burky, harding, hau, and puleloa (1998) and lagarde et al. (2017). in both studies, a synchronicity between peaks of sicydiinae larval drift in rivers and elevated discharge was demon- strated on a seasonal scale. however, the question of how daily fluc- tuations of rivers discharge influence the drift dynamics of sicydiinae larvae in freshwater remains. the first objective of this study was to confirm the previously ob- served diel variations of sicydiinae larvae abundances in natural and stable flow conditions (lagarde et al., 2017). the second objective was to test the hypothesis that daily anthropogenic fluctuations of river discharge strongly affect the larval drift dynamics of sicydiinae (i.e. larval abundance, transport duration and larval survivorship). in other     |  647 terms, the objective was to verify whether a benefit in terms of sur- vival really exists when larval drifting time is reduced during periods of elevated discharge. 2 |  material and methods 2.1 | fish species studied in reunion island, a small volcanic island in the south- western indian ocean (figure 1a), two sicydiinae gobies, sicyopterus lagocephalus and cotylopus acutipinnis, dominate the freshwater fish assemblages. these two species present an important cultural value as traditional fishermen mainly target them (aboussouan, 1969; bell, 1999). they are present from the estuaries to upstream reaches (teichert, valade, lim, et al., 2014) as they can climb waterfalls tens of metres high due to their efficient climbing abilities (blob, rai, julius, & schoenfuss, 2006; schoenfuss & blob, 2007; voegtlé, larinier, & bosc, 2002). reproduction of both species occurs in middle and upper reaches of rivers during the warmer months, that is december to may (teichert, valade, fostier, grondin, & gaudin, 2016; teichert, valade, fostier, lagarde, & gaudin, 2014). females lay eggs under pebbles and rocks in runs and riffles (teichert, valade, bosc, richarson, & gaudin, 2013). after egg fertilisation, the male guards the eggs until the larvae hatch (teichert, keith, et al., 2013). 2.2 | sampling sites the study was conducted at three sites along the watershed of langevin river (figure 1b). this torrential and very turbulent river flows southward from its source located on the south flank of the piton de la fournaise volcano. approximately 500 m upstream to the estuary, a waterfall tens of metres high impedes the upstream migra- tion of most amphidromous fish species. due to their climbing capaci- ties, only s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis can pass this waterfall and reach upstream river sections. three intermittent sectors are present along the river due to the porosity of the bedrock (figure 1c). water flows through these sectors only a few days per year during flood con- ditions. in addition to natural flow variability within the langevin river watershed, hydroelectric management of a dam, located at 6.5 km up- stream to the estuary and 215 m above sea level (a.s.l.), results in diel fluctuations of river discharge. the most upstream sampling site (site a, figure 1c) was located immediately upstream of the dam at 215 m a.s.l. the river width at this site was approximately 20 m. the riverine habitats upstream to site a consisted of riffles and pools, several lotic areas being suitable for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis to reproduce. a gauging station was located approximately 100 m upstream to site a. site b (figure 1c) was located immediately downstream to the out- let channel of the hydropower plant. the river width at site b was ap- proximately 5 m. the concrete- built channel presented no substratum suitable for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis to reproduce, so it was assumed that no reproductive activity occurred in this channel during the study. on 17 february 2016, the dam was not operative and no lagarde et al.648  |     figure 1 sampling sites along the langevin river watershed (c), reunion island (b), southwestern indian ocean (a). discharge fluctuations on 22 january 2016, when the dam was in operation, and on 17 february 2016, when the dam was not in operation are presented as examples for each site. water loss can be observed between sites a and b on 17 february 2016 due to the porosity of the bed rock water was flowing in the channel upstream to the usual location of site b. the sampling site was thus moved to the river bed, approxi- mately 50 m upstream to its usual location. at this occasion, the river width at site b was approximately 10 m. the most downstream sampling site (site c, figure 1c) was located at 50 m a.s.l., 2 km downstream to site b and 2.5 km upstream to the estuary. the river width at this site was approximately 18 m. the riverine habitat between sites b and c consisted of riffles and pools, several lotic areas being suitable for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis to reproduce. egg clutches of sicydiinae gobies had been observed in the river between both sites during a previous study (teichert, valade, et al., 2013). during the study, data from site a (figure 1c) were used to describe the daily variations of larval abundances in natural flow conditions. on 17 february 2016, when the dam was not operative, the river flowed between sites a, b and c without anthropogenic disturbances or natu- ral input from tributaries (figure 1c). during this sampling session only, data from sites b and c were also used to describe the variations of larval abundances in natural flow conditions. for all the other sampling sessions, the dam was operative and the whole river discharge was diverted into the hydropower plant. consequently, the river section between the dam and site b was dried up. larvae originating from up- stream reaches situated nearby site a thus had to survive the passage through hydroelectric structures to reach site b. the diel fluctuations of discharge observed at sites b and c (figure 1c) were due to hydro- power management. when the dam was operative, data from site c were used to describe the effect of daily anthropogenic fluctuations of river discharge on larval drift dynamics. data from site b were used for controlling that larvae coming from upstream to the dam, and ob- served at site a, did not significantly influence the larval drift dynamics observed at site c. 2.3 | sampling procedure a total of six sampling sessions were performed simultaneously at the three sites every 2 weeks from january 2016 to march 2016. this period was selected as it corresponds to the main season of reproduc- tion of sicydiinae gobies in reunion island, especially in upstream sites (teichert, valade, fostier, et al., 2014). each sampling covered an entire 24- hr cycle and consisted in immersing simultaneously two conical nets nine to ten times at each site. the first nine two-net samples were scheduled every 3 hr. the additional, tenth, two- net sample was performed during the first peak of discharge of the day if this peak did not occur during the scheduled samples. peaks of discharge were detected based on con- stant visual observations of water height at site c. synchronicity of sampling schedule among sites was maintained by regular communi- cations among the teams working at each site using mobile phones. at each station, the two nets were immersed for 5–30 min (dnet) to filter a volume of 3–6 m3. this volume captures tens of larvae (lagarde et al., 2017) and limits the quantity of organic and mineral debris in the net. the nets were similar to those used for quantitative lagarde et al.drift sampling in small streams by bell (1994, 2007). their mouth diameter was 0.12 m, cod end diameter 0.06 m, length 1 m, and mesh size 80 μm. one of the two nets was fixed in the centre of the stream flow, whereas the other one was randomly positioned along the lotic areas of the river cross- section. the distances between the two nets ranged between 1.2 and 8.7 m (mean ± standard deviation [sd] = 3.9 m ± 2.1) at site a, between 0.2 and 2.4 m (0.7 m ± 0.5) at site b and between 0.2 and 2.7 m (1.3 m ± 0.7) at site c. each net was set separately, the second net being set within 10 min after the first net. using two nets quasi simultaneously, homogeneity of larvae distribution across the river was quantified (lagarde et al., 2017). each net was placed facing upstream at about 50% of the water depth. it was attached to an iron rod hammered into the sub- stratum. two measures of water velocity (v1 and v2) were performed in front of the mouth of each net, immediately after being set and before being removed. measures were performed with a flo- mate 2000 flow meter (cometec) or a z4000 current meter (ott) at site a, a m1 current meter (seba hydrometry) at site b, and a mf pro flow meter (ott) at site c. all these apparatuses gave values with the same precision. the sampled volume (vnet) was estimated with equation (1): vnet = v1 + v2 2 × π × r2 × dnet (1) where v1 and v2 are the instantaneous water velocities measured in m/s before and at the end of the sampling respectively; r, the radius of the net mouth (i.e. 0.06 m); and dnet, the sampling duration (s). 2.4 | larvae sorting and counting after recovering each net, the content of each cod end was im- mediately transferred into a 2- l bottle filled with water from the river. the sample was kept still for a minimum of 1 hr and a maxi- mum of 11 hr in the bottle to let organic and mineral debris settle down. this delay was assumed not to affect the number of alive larvae as the first mortality of sicydiinae larvae usually occurs after approximately 24 hr spent in freshwater (iida et al., 2010; valade et al., 2009). this assumption was confirmed by visual observa- tions of active larvae 11 hr after sampling. larvae remained in the water column thanks to their “swim up–sink down” behaviour (bell & brown, 1995; valade et al., 2009). larvae were then collected by carefully pouring the contents of the bottle on an 80- μm- mesh sieve. the pouring was stopped before the overflow of vegetal and mineral debris. the water was returned to the bottle in order to repeat the decanting procedure twice. all larvae were transferred to a counting dish and counted by removing them one by one using a 15- μl micropipette. when the number of larvae appeared to be too high for direct count, the larvae were fixed with 95% alcohol solu- tion, and their number was estimated later in the laboratory using a dollfus tray. the total number of larvae (nlarvae) corresponded to the sum of all the larvae removed at the end of the three decant process. for each sample, the larvae were placed in a labelled 1- ml eppendorf® and fixed with 95% alcohol solution.     |  649 2.5 | estimation of river discharge and fluctuations of water height data from the gauging station located upstream to site a were ob- tained online (www.eaureunion.fr, accessed in july 2016). the instan- taneous river discharge (qriver, m3/s) was recorded every 12 min. at site b, the discharge at the outlet of the dam was estimated every hour by the hydroelectric company (electricité de france) based on the mean hourly hydroelectric production. these data were used for estimating the river discharge during each two- net sample at this site, except on 17 february 2016 when the dam was not operative. the river discharge at site c was estimated during each two- net sample using the velocity–area method. the river cross- section was divided into a minimum of ten vertical subsections. in each subsection, the water velocity was measured using a flow meter (type mf pro, ott) at up to three different water depths. the discharge of each sub- section was estimated by multiplying the subsection area by its mean water velocity. the river discharge corresponded to the sum of the discharges of all subsections. the methods used for the measurement of flow velocities and for the estimation of discharge were based on the recommendation of the standard international organization for standardization (iso, 2007). the duration of the water height rising from base flow to the peak of discharge was identified based on measurements of water height at site c made every minute using a pressure sensor (mini diver sws technology) with an accuracy of ±1 cm. the sensor was attached to an iron rod hammered into the substratum. as the position of the sensor varied between sampling sessions, only the relative variation in water height (i.e. difference between the water height at a given time and the minimum water height observed during the sampling session) was used. 2.6 | variations of larval abundance instantaneous larval abundance was approximated with larval density (dlarvae, ind/m3) calculated for each net with equation (2): dlarvae = nlarvae vnet (2) where nlarvae is the number of larvae caught in the net and vnet is the sampled volume (m3). differences in the larval density between each net of the two- net samples were tested for the whole data set using a paired student’s t test. the homogeneity of the spatial distribution of larval density along the cross- section of the river was checked using orthogonal regressions between the larval densities estimated for each net of the two- net samples. the daily variations in larval densities were analysed at each study site using periodic linear regressions as proposed by bell (2007). periodic linear regressions are frequently used for modelling predict- able cyclical events, and allow the use of time as a continuous variable rather than a series of arbitrary categories (bell, 2008; bliss, 1958). this is particularly appropriate for this study as the time interval between two successive two- net samples (from 1 to 3 hr), and the lagarde et al.650  |     number of two- net samples per sampling session (from 9 to 10), varied between sampling sessions. a mixed periodic model was adjusted taking into account each sampling session in order to integrate the variability of larval density among dates (3): dlarvae = β0 + β1sin(rh) + β2cos(rh) + r(1 + sin(rh) + cos(rh)session) (3) where dlarvae represents the instantaneous larval density; rh, the ra- dian transformed hour of the day (hour × 2π/24); β0, the mesor (i.e. mean response of the biological trait over cycles); β1 and β2, the re- gression coefficients; and r, the matrix of random individual effects for the sampling sessions. residuals of regressions were plotted as a function of a theoretical normal distribution (quantile–quantile plot) to verify the assumption of normality. the significance of parameters was calculated based on the f- statistic using the satterthwaite’s ap- proximation method for fixed part, and on likelihood ratio tests for random part (chi- square tests). the peak position (p, hour of the day) was determined for the mixed periodic linear model from equation (4): p = 24 × arctan( β1 β2 ) + qc 2π (4) where qc is a quadrant correction (qc = 0 if β1 and β2 are both posi- tive, qc =π if β1 is positive and β2 negative or if both are negative and qc = 2π if β1 is negative and β2 positive). this peak was considered significant even if one part of the periodic model (i.e. β1 or β2) was not significant because cycles cannot be expressed in less than two dimensions (bell, 2007). at site c, one outlier was excluded from this analysis to verify the assumption of normally distributed residuals. 2.7 | estimation of larval drifting time and survival probability the mean flow velocity of the river reaches downstream to site c was used to approximate the time taken by larvae drifting from site c to the sea. the estimation of mean flow velocity in this reach was per- formed twice: on a date when river discharge was low, and on a date when it was elevated. on each date, water velocity was measured at 40% of the water depth using a flow meter (type mf pro, ott) in several points along 12–14 transects following the protocol described by girard, lamouroux, and mons (2014). estimations of survival probability were performed on larvae collected at sites a and c during three different sampling sessions when variations of river discharge were observed. these three dates were selected based on staff availability. for each of the three sam- pling sessions, survival probability was studied for larvae captured during the first two- net sample of the session, and for larvae cap- tured during the additional two- net sample performed immediately after the first peak of discharge observed at site c. larvae captured at site c were used to study the effect of discharge conditions on lar- val survival when those captured at site a were used for controlling the effect of the hour of the day on larval survival. a maximum of 60 larvae were subsampled per two- net sample. if the number of larvae captured in the two- net sample was lower than 60, all larvae were sampled. at site a, an additional third net was set immediately after the two- net sample in order to increase the number of larvae for this experiment. immediately after being captured, the larvae were transferred to the laboratory where they were sorted and counted following the protocol described above. they were placed in 500- ml beakers at 23.5 ± 0.5°c, a temperature corresponding to the mean daily tem- perature observed in downstream reaches of the langevin river during summer (teichert, valade, fostier, et al., 2014). every 6–8 hr, the dissolved oxygen (mg/l) in the beakers was measured using an oximeter (hq30d; hatch), and the dead larvae were removed using a 15- μl micropipette, and preserved in 95% alcohol solution. larvae were considered dead when lying on the bottom of the beaker and not responding to a gentle stimulation using a soft paintbrush. estimations of larval survival probability with time were per- formed based on the kaplan–meier method. due to the low number of larvae captured during some two- net samples, results of survival time from the three different sampling sessions were summed. results were expressed for low and peak discharge at site c, and the corresponding time of sampling at site a, the station where hydrolog- ical conditions were not modified. finally, the difference of survival probability with time among the four different groups was tested using a log- rank test. all statistical analyses were performed with the open source r v. 3.3.1 software (r development core team, 2016). the pack- ages lme4 (bates, maechler, bolker, & walker, 2015) and lmertest (kuznetsova, brockhoff, & christensen, 2015) were used for the mixed periodic model analyses, and the package survival (therneau, 2015) for the estimations of larval survival time. 2.8 | identification of the larvae to the species level no morphological criteria allow to discriminate the larvae of s. lago- cephalus and c. acutipinnis (teichert, 2012). the larvae of both species present similar size, shape, colour and repartition of their chromato- phores. criteria commonly used for morphological identification of amphidromous fish larvae (lindstrom, 1999) are thus not useful for identifying these two species. identification at the species level was thus based on dna analyses. a sample of 480 larvae was selected, 288 being randomly subsam- pled among the 407 larvae used for survival experiments, and 78 and 114 being randomly subsampled among the two- net samples from sites a and c respectively. as no peak of discharge was observed on 17 february 2016, no larvae from this sampling session were sampled for dna analysis. total genomic dna was extracted from each whole larva using dneasy blood & tissue kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. following the same protocol as in lagarde et al.

slope ± standard error [se] = 0.99 ± 0.04; inter- cept ± se = 0.01 ± 0.07; r2 = .76). as a consequence, the mean value ( ̄dlarvae) of all nets for each two- net sample was used for the following analyses. when, for technical reasons, the estimation of the larval den- sity was available for only one net of the two- net sample (n = 2, i.e. 1.2% of the two- net samples), this unique value was used. 3.2 | diel variations in larval density of s. lagocephalus the larval density ( ̄dlarvae) of s. lagocephalus varied between 0.19 and 22 ind/m3 (mean ± sd = 4.2 ± 4.2 ind/m3) at site a, between 0 and 5.8 ind/m3 (1.8 ± 1.5 ind/m3) at site b and between 2.9 and 1,120 ind/ lagarde et al.652  |     figure 2 log- transformed larval densities of sicyopterus lagocephalus according to the hour of the day at sites a (a), b (b) and c (c). open symbols differ for each date, the solid black line corresponds to the predictions for the fixed part of the periodic linear mixed models, and the black arrows correspond to the daily peak predicted for the fixed part of the periodic linear mixed model. the circled value at site c is an outlier which was excluded from the analysis to verify the assumption of normally distributed residuals. as no significant variation of discharge was observed on 17 february 2016, data from this sampling session were not included in the analysis at sites b and c table 2 results of the periodic linear mixed models for sites a, b and c with the sampling session considered as a random effect. at site c, an outlier was excluded from the analysis to verify the assumption of normally distributed residuals (see figure 2 for details). with β0: mesor, that is mean response of the biological trait over cycles, β1 and β2: regression coefficients, df: degree of freedom estimated using the satterthwaite’s approximation method, f: f- statistic, and p: associated probability. as no significant variation of discharge was observed on 17 february 2016, data from this sampling session were not included in the analysis for sites b and c fixed effects site a site b site c random effects site a site b site c coefficient estimate df — 4.82 4.84 — 23.99 3.98 — 13.71 13.71 β0 β1 β2 β0 β1 β2 β0 β1 β2 coefficient β1 β2 β1 β2 β1 β2 1.42 −0.01 −0.41 0.86 −0.26 −0.01 2.38 −0.33 −0.11 χ2 0.66 1.44 0.12 1.89 4.86 0.46 f — 0.00 11.10 — 9.26 0.01 — 1.60 0.50 df 3 3 3 3 3 3 p — .96 .02 — < .01 .92 — .27 .49 p .90 .70 1.00 .60 .90 .20 m3 (34.7 ± 146.2 ind/m3) at site c (figure 2). the estimated fixed pa- rameters, β1 and β2, of the periodic models explained a significant part of larval densities variability at sites a and b, but not at site c (table 2, figure 2). as no significant variation of discharge was observed on 17 february 2016, data from this sampling session were excluded from the analysis at sites b and c. at sites a and b, the predicted peaks of larval densities were at 12:03 and 17:48 respectively. the variance ex- plained by the random periodic parameters included in each model was never significant for the three sites (chi- square test, df = 3, p ≥ .2 in all sites). it means that the larval density dynamics considered separately for each sampling session were not different from the larval density dynamics described for all the sampling sessions considered altogether. lagarde et al.    |  653 figure 3 log- transformed larval densities of sicyopterus lagocephalus at site b (open symbols) and site c (filled symbols), and relative fluctuations of water height at site c (dashed line) according to the hour of the day for each sampling session (from a to f) 3.3 | effects of anthropogenic fluctuation of discharge on larval densities of s. lagocephalus at sites b and c the larval densities observed at site c were always higher than those observed at site b with the exception of a single event at 23:00 on 17 february 2016 when the dam was not operating (figure 3c). in addition, the maximum larval density at site c was at 20:00 on this day when the dam was not operating (figure 3c). during the whole study, the relative fluctuations of water height at site c varied between 4 and 33 cm and the duration of the water height increase from base flow to the peak of discharge lasted from 12 to 17 min. at site b, the discharge difference between two successive two- net samples ranged from −1.9 to +1.6 m3/s when the larval densi- ties of s. lagocephalus difference ranged from −3.6 to +3.5 ind/m3 (figure 4a). at site c, the discharge difference between two succes- sive two- net samples ranged from −2.1 to +1.9 m3/s when the dif- ference in larval densities ranged from −1,110.9 to +1,114.9 ind/m3 (figure 4b). the log- transformed difference of larval density between two successive two- net samples was correlated to the difference of discharge between the same two- net samples at site c (n = 42;

p = .16). the maximum survival times for the four groups of larvae were similar and ranged between 130 and 140 hr (figure 5). however, survival prob- abilities over time significantly differed among groups (log- rank test, df = 3, χ² = 32, p < .001), and the larvae captured during the peaks of discharge at site c had a lower survival probability, especially during the first 24 hr (figure 5). 4 |  discussion 4.1 | diel variations of larval abundances of sicyopterus lagocephalus in natural flow conditions among the 404 larvae successfully identified by dna analyses, 402 (99.5%) were identified as s. lagocephalus. the proportion of lagarde et al.    |  655 4.2 | effect of anthropogenic fluctuations of discharge on larval abundances of sicyopterus lagocephalus larval abundances of s. lagocephalus were strongly affected by daily anthropogenic fluctuations of river discharge. the most elevated lar- val abundances observed at site c were clearly related to the rapid increases of discharge at this site. the number of larvae captured in site b was low compared to site c (919 larvae captured for a total fil- tered volume of 553 m3 at site b vs. 16,200 larvae captured for a total filtered volume of 469 m3 at site c). larvae coming from upstream to the dam thus represented a negligible proportion of larvae caught at site c. larval abundances at site c can be attributed to the spawning grounds present within the 2 km of the river between sites b and c. interestingly, when the dam was operative, a peak of drifting larvae was observed at the end of the afternoon (17:45) at site b. this peak was approximately 6 hr after the peak observed at site a. as no habi- tat appeared suitable for s. lagocephalus to reproduce between sites a and b, the larvae caught at site b probably originated from upstream reaches situated nearby site a. thus, the 6 hr spent by larvae travelling between sites a and b reflected the time larvae took passing through the different hydroelectric structures between the water diversion at the dam and the outlet channel. the variation of larval abundances at site c can be explained by the dynamics of hatching (bradbury, campana, bentzen, & snelgrove, 2004), or a coordinated and active swimming behaviour of larvae (iguchi & mizuno, 1991; jarvis & closs, 2015). this latter hypothesis is very unlikely as sicydiinae gobies are known to have very poor swim- ming abilities (bell & brown, 1995; valade et al., 2009). moreover, the torrential and very turbulent flow conditions in the langevin river would impede any active displacement of tiny larvae. in addition, the mean flow velocity in the short length of the river section upstream to site c was elevated (approximately 30 cm/s). larvae coming from up- stream spawning grounds were thus rapidly transported to site c. so, the most probable explanation for the variation of larval abundances observed at site c is the dynamics of hatching. 4.3 | effect of anthropogenic fluctuations of discharge on larval drifting time and survival probability of sicyopterus lagocephalus the larval transport duration of s. lagocephalus was slightly reduced during anthropogenic peaks of discharge. oppositely, larval survival probability dropped during these peaks. the influence of river dis- charge on larval drift dynamics of sicydiinae gobies has been de- scribed at the seasonal scale for lentipes concolor in hawaii (way et al., 1998), and for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis in another watershed in reunion island (lagarde et al., 2017). at the seasonal scales, these authors hypothesised that elevated flow velocity in- duced by increase of discharge during rainy events reduced the drifting duration of sicydiinae larvae, and could be a strategy to re- duce the risk of mortality in freshwater. the present study demon- strates that, on a daily scale, the mortality of larvae drifting during figure 5 mean larval survival probability over time based on the kaplan–meier method for the four groups of sicyopterus lagocephalus larvae sampled on 3 february, 2 march and 15 march 2016. larvae from the groups “low” and “control_low” were captured between 07:00 and 07:30 when no peak of discharge was observed at site c. larvae from the groups “peak” and “control_peak” were captured during the peaks of discharge observed at site c, see table 3 for details on sampling conditions. the origin of the x- axis is the time of capture of the larvae c. acutipinnis larvae in this study can thus be considered as negligible, and the observed dynamics can be primarily attributed to s. lagoceph- alus. the very low proportion of c. acutipinnis larvae in langevin river is not surprising as teichert, keith, et al. (2013) estimated that 99% of the mature adults present on the spawning grounds in this river were s. lagocephalus and that the number of c. acutipinnis eggs clutches was negligible. dna- based identification of drifting larvae confirmed the observations made several years before, and demonstrated that lar- vae present in a river could be a good indicator of the adults present in upstream reaches. diel variations of abundances of s. lagocephalus larvae in natural and stable flow conditions were confirmed. the diel dynamics of abundances of s. lagocephalus larvae (i.e. larval density) captured in upstream site (site a) during all sampling sessions presented a weak but significant peak at around midday (precisely 12:03). the weak diel dynamics of larval drift in upstream reaches has already been documented for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis in another water- shed of reunion island (lagarde et al., 2017). this observation has also been made for rhinogobius brunneus, an amphidromous goby, in japan (iguchi & mizuno, 1990), and for amphidromous shrimps in puerto rico (march, benstead, pringle, & scatena, 1998). on 17 february 2016, the dam was not in operation, and the discharge remained stable in downstream reaches. at the most downstream site (site c), the peak of larval drift was observed few hours after night fall. this observation is consistent with the observations of larval drift dynamics made in downstream reaches of another water- shed in reunion island for s. lagocephalus and c. acutipinnis (lagarde et al., 2017). it is also consistent with observations made for other sicydiinae species in hawaii (lindstrom, 1998; luton, brasher, durkin, & little, 2005). lagarde et al.656  |     the short periods of elevated discharge may not be reduced but in- creased. indeed, larvae survival probability was lower during peaks of discharge compared to low flow conditions. consequently, the artificial increases in flow velocity probably do not counterbalance the increase in larval mortality as the time spent by larvae drifting to the estuary is not drastically reduced. the gain in time is only few minutes when discharge artificially increases from 1.0 to 1.6 m3/s. interestingly, the anthropogenic increases in discharge observed during this study were much less important than those associated with flash floods, which are frequent during the rainy season. the reduction of drifting time during natural flash floods is probably much greater than during artificial increases in flow velocity. for example, during a flood of low intensity recorded upstream to site a on 23 january 2016, the discharge increased of ca. 6 m3/s in less than 60 min. this value was much higher than the maximum in- crease of artificial discharge observed during this study (1.9 m3/s in 15 min). during natural flash floods, the reduction of drifting time, which may increase larvae survival by decreasing the time spent in freshwater, probably offsets the elevated probability of mortality. the positive effect of flash floods would be more important when the distance between spawning grounds and estuary increases. 4.4 | influence of biological and environmental factors on larval drift dynamics of sicyopterus lagocephalus this study highlighted the direct relationship between increasing dis- charge and the quantity of drifting larvae of s. lagocephalus as well as their drifting time and survival probability in freshwater. these lar- val drift dynamics were related to hatching dynamics associated with peak of discharges in the downstream site (i.e. site c). three factors can influence the dynamics of hatching: (i) the spawning strategy of adults, (ii) the behaviour of guarding males and/or (iii) the environ- mental factors (i.e. the river flow). adults can influence the dynamics of hatching by spawning at a particular time. in unpredictable flow environment, some fish species can use the increase of discharge as a cue for spawning (lytle & poff, 2004). the guarding males of amphi- dromous gobies have also been suspected to actively provoke hatch- ing. indeed, maeda and tachihara (2010) suggested that the guarding males are poking and fanning the eggs more intensively to provoke hatching at a particular time of the day (i.e. at night). similarly, males could also provoke hatching when sensing an increase of discharge. finally, environmental factors such as the increase of shear stress on eggs clutches with river discharge (lamouroux, statzner, fuchs, kohmann, & schmedtje, 1992; statzner & müller, 1989) can also pro- mote hatching. næsje et al. (1995) hypothesised that the increase of drifting larvae of two coregonus species with increasing river dis- charge was due to the flow turbulence making the larvae hatch. that the dynamics of hatching during this study was influenced by the spawning strategy of adults is very unlikely. discharge peaks oc- curred unpredictably between 10:00 and 01:00 at site c, and no clear recurrent pattern was observed among sampling sessions. moreover, sicydiinae embryos develop in 3 days at temperatures ranging between 19 and 21°c (lindstrom, 1998). adults are mostly likely un- able to predict 3 days in advance when discharge peaks will occur. although a quantification of the influence of the guarding males’ behaviour, or increase of shear stress on eggs clutches, was not per- formed during this study, it is likely that hatching was provoked by an increase of physical constraints. this increase of physical constraints on eggs clutches could force larvae that had not completed their em- bryonic development to hatch. the high proportion of incompletely developed larvae during the peaks of discharge may explain why their survival was lower. this study demonstrated that larval abundance, larval transport duration and larval survivorship of sicydiinae are strongly affected by daily anthropogenic fluctuations of river discharge. this strong rela- tionship between environmental factors and larval drift dynamics of sicydiinae in freshwater was largely expected for these small larvae released in highly turbulent flow conditions. however, more research remains needed to describe how larval drift dynamics varies with en- vironmental factors regarding river morphology and flow conditions. as s. lagocephalus inhabits many tropical islands with varying river morphologies (keith, galewski, cattaneo- berrebi, hoareau, & berrebi, 2005), it will be interesting to study how the larval drift dynamics of this species adapts to different flow regimes. 4.5 | implication for management and conservation this study demonstrated that anthropogenic fluctuations of river dis- charge can have harmful effects on larval drift dynamics when the as- sociated decrease of larval transport duration is low compared to the increase of larval mortality. the harmful effect of erratic diurnal flow pattern due to hydropower operations is well recognised for several aquatic organisms (bunn & arthington, 2002) and especially for fish larvae (weyers, jennings, & freeman, 2003). however, most of the management and conservation recommendations concerning the lar- vae of amphidromous species have been focused on the reduction of direct mortality associated with entrainment of larvae into the water intakes (benstead, march, pringle, & scatena, 1999; jarvis & closs, 2015). the much lower larval survivorship of s. lagocephalus observed during the peaks of discharge in langevin river suggests that the im- pact of daily anthropogenic fluctuations of discharge should be further considered when building management and conservation plans for am- phidromous species. the strong correlation between the abundances of drifting larvae and the amplitude of the discharge peaks suggests that reducing the amplitude of these peaks would efficiently mitigate their harmful effect as already suggested by nagrodski, raby, hasler, taylor, and cooke (2012) and bruder et al. (2016). such operational measures and their monitoring would bring crucial data to address the knowledge gaps concerning the impacts of hydropower operations on amphidromous species. acknowledgements this study was supported by the european regional development fund, région réunion (avenue rené cassin, bp 7190, 97719 saint lagarde et al.denis cedex 9) and office national de l’eau et de milieux aquatiques (5 square félix nadar 94300 vincennes). we are very thankful to the anglers federation of réunion island for providing a room to install our field laboratory, to frédéric cellier from electricité de france for supplying the discharge data at site b and to all the persons who assisted us on the field especially audrey philippe, guillaume borie, ananda raichon, clarisse laroque and dominique hoarau. we ac- knowledge the plateforme gentyane of the institut national de la recherche agronomique (inra, clermont- ferrand, france) for geno- typing support. we are also very grateful to evgeny romanov and christophe lemoine for their constructive comments and suggestions concerning this manuscript. we thank three anonymous referees for useful comments on previous versions of this paper. orcid raphaël lagarde http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9809-1673 references aboussouan, a.
