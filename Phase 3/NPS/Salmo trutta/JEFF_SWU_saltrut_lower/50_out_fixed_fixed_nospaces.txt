john wiley & sons a ⁄ s a. r. henderson*, c. e. johnston department of fisheries and allied aquacultures, auburn university, auburn, al, usa abstract – information on larval and juvenile habitat use is virtually absent for ﬁshes. our objective was to document habitat use of larval and juvenile cape fear shiners notropis mekistocholas, an endangered species, in both natural and lab settings so that a better understanding of habitat requirements in all life stages can be achieved. we measured habitat parameters of areas used by all life stages of n. mekistocholas in the summers of 2007–2008 in the rocky river, north carolina. field data suggests larvae use more shallow depths (mean = 31.6 cm) and reduced water velocities (mean = 0.02 mæs )1), and juveniles 15–25 mm often school with adults. results of 0.10 mæs lab studies support ﬁeld observations. in the mesolarval and metalarval stages n. mekistocholas were selective in their use of water velocity (p = 0.013) and depth (p = 0.001). in multiple juvenile stages, n. mekistocholas were selective for water velocity (p = 0.015), and depth (p < 0.001), choosing deeper depths and higher water velocities than larvae. these results demonstrate ontogenetic shifts in habitat use of n. mekistocholas and suggest that water velocity and depth are critical to successful recruitment for this species. )1) than adults (mean =

1991; angermeier 1995). unfortunately, very little is known about habitat selection of most species, making habitat protection difﬁcult. this is especially true for larval and juvenile ﬁshes, which may use different habitats than adults (werner & gilliam 1984). the cape fear shiner notropis mekistocholas is federally listed as an endangered species, due to a very restricted distribution. there are only ﬁve self- sustaining populations in the cape fear river drainage, north carolina (saillant et al. 2004) and these populations occur in the main stem and tributaries of the deep, haw, and rocky rivers (pottern & huish 1985, 1986, 1987). historically n. mekistocholas is thought to have had a very restricted it distribution and it is unique in the genus notropis in that is a piedmont endemic (snelson 1971). notropis mekistocholas exists in very small numbers and like most organisms is especially vulnerable to extinction due to demographic and environmental stochasticity, and protection of existing habitat is critical (alo & turner 2005). habitat fragmentation and degradation are proposed to be the greatest threats to n. mekistocholas within its existing range, the smallest of any species of notropis (warren et al. 2000). the building of impoundments in the cape fear watershed has fragmented the landscape and isolated populations of the species (fig. 1). demographic and genetic consequences of river fragmentation have been reduced effective pop- ulation sizes, resulting in regional extirpation of cyprinids (winston et al. 1991; alo & turner 2005). additionally, poor water quality in the region has had deleterious effects, particularly in the haw river doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00392.x 87 henderson & johnston fig. 1. map showing distribution of all cape fear shiner popula- tions (circles) and location of sampling sites on the rocky river, nc (star). black bars represent impoundments. watershed where adult habitat is unsuitable (hewitt et al. 2006). within their range, adult n. mekistocholas are restricted to habitat patches characterised by shoals, rifﬂes, or runs with clean ﬂowing water over coarse substrates (howard 2003). larvae and juveniles may use more shallow areas than adults in slack water or no ﬂow, but description of larval and juvenile habitat use is lacking for this species. although habitat is limiting at some historical localities, there are habitat patches that appear suitable for occupation but are not used at some sites (howard 2003). such vacant habitat patches may be outside the dispersal range of the species, or may not be used due to a lack of nearby or adjacent habitat appropriate for larvae or juveniles. cyprinids that are patchily distributed among favour- able habitats have displayed limited short and long- term movements and are generally sedentary, limiting successful colonisation potential (hill & grossman 1987; johnston 2000). for connectivity among exist- ing fragmented populations of this species to be re-established, an understanding of habitat suitability at all life stages is necessary. the objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate larval and juvenile habitat use in the rocky river, north carolina, to determine if habitat used during early life stages differed from adult or available habitat 88 and (ii) to investigate habitat choice in the lab using captive bred individuals since habitat variables are correlated, in order to ascertain which variables are the most important aspects of habitat choice for larval and juvenile n. mekistocholas. materials and methods study sites extant populations of n. mekistocholas are in tribu- taries and main-stem reaches of the deep, haw, and rocky rivers (fig. 1). populations in these rivers are illustrated with black circles; our study sites on the rocky river are represented with a black star. the rocky river is approximately 56 km in length, and is located almost completely within chatham county, north carolina, in the carolina slate belt. land use within the rocky river watershed is primarily agri- culture, dairy production, and forest (ncdwq 2004). the rocky river is a large tributary to the deep river, and these rivers meet to form the cape fear river near the fall line, bordering chatham and lee counties, north carolina. impoundments constructed in the rocky river have fragmented n. mekistocholas populations and contributed to loss of habitat suitable for the species (pottern & huish 1985). the sites selected in this study for all habitat observations and measurements are approximately 550 (35.61867 n, )79.15883 w) and 850 (35.61845 n, )79.16124 w) meters upstream of the conﬂuence of the deep and rocky rivers on the rocky river. these habitat patches are the ﬁrst with habitat heterogeneity pro- ceeding upstream from the conﬂuence of the deep and rocky rivers, and the ﬁrst supporting populations of n. mekistocholas (howard 2003). monitoring was conducted by snorkelling in spring and summer months of the years 2007 and 2008. snorkelling is a non-intrusive method for observing endangered ﬁshes, and has been used by previous investigators of this species and others (howard 2003; johnston 2000). schools of n. mekistocholas larvae and juveniles were ﬂagged and monitored at the ﬁrst study site on the rocky river 550 m upstream from the conﬂuence of the deep ⁄ rocky rivers in may and august 2007, and april and july 2008. this habitat patch is 150 m in length, and approximately 6,300 m2 in total area. the study site upstream from this location was monitored april–july 2008. this habitat patch is 200 m in length, approximately 5,200 m2 in total area, and is 150 m upstream from the downstream monitoring site. notropis mekistocholas adults are known to occur in these patches (howard 2003). pool and deep run habitats were searched snorkelling upstream and downstream to determine if cape fear shiners occurred outside of these patches, and no habitat use of larval and juvenile notropis mekistocholas n. mekistocholas were observed in either direction. deep run and pool habitats upstream and downstream of suitable habitat patches were not favourable for adult n. mekistocholas occupation (howard 2003), and within these habitats large numbers of ﬁshes known to be predators of minnows in larval, juvenile, and adult stages (e.g. micropterus salmoides) were present (schlosser & angermeier 1990; harvey 1991). we used a small ruler when snorkelling to measure lengths of n. mekistocholas. the use of underwater visual sampling has been used to assess habitat speciﬁcity for aquatic species where traditional meth- ods (seine, electroﬁshing) are inefﬁcient, the habitat is complex, or the species is threatened or imperilled (freeman & grossman 1993). notropis mekistocholas in all life stages were observed by snorkelling in an upstream direction to minimise disturbance, and coloured weights and plastic ﬂagging were used to mark microhabitats occupied by ﬁsh. fishes that could be confused with n. mekistocholas, such as the swallowtail shiner, notropis procne, and the river chub, nocomis micropogon, occupied different habi- tats within suitable patches and were in separate areas of the water column in juvenile stages. physical habitat variables along random transects greater than 5 m apart within habitat patches occupied by n. mekistocholas were measured in may and august 2007, and april and july 2008 on the rocky river, north carolina. all available habitats in the study area were snorkelled repeatedly in the summers of 2007 & 2008 in order to determine if n. mekist- ocholas in early life stages selected speciﬁc habitat types. available habitat transects were taken within shoal, rifﬂe and run mesohabitats and included the following abiotic variables: wet river width, current )1), water depth (cm), percentage of velocity (mæs cover and substrate composition. where schools of n. mekistocholas were observed, we took point measurements of habitat variables weighted by the number of ﬁsh in a school. three size classes were monitored: larvae <15 mm tl, juvenile 15–35 mm tl and adult >35 mm tl (fuiman et al. 1983). larvae included mesolarvae (7–12 mm tl), with distinct caudal ﬁn rays apparent but not pelvic buds, and metalarvae (14–16 mm tl), with pelvic buds apparent but without the preanal ﬁnfold absorbed (fuiman et al. 1983). measurements of habitat use )1), substrate included ﬁsh focal water velocity (mæs characterisation based on a wentworth scale (cm), ﬁsh focal depth (cm) and cover. current velocity was measured with a marsh-mcbirney 2000 ﬂow meter (hach, loveland, co). fish focal depth and substrate size were measured with a meter stick to the nearest centimeter, and cover was visually estimated. sub- strate was categorised according to a modiﬁed went- worth scale: gravel 1–50 mm, cobble 50–250 mm, (table 1). percent cover boulder 250–2500 mm and bedrock >2500 mm. a classiﬁcation of substrates including bedrock in most combinations was chosen because cape fear shiners often were found over a mixed matrix of substrates, and bedrock was included in most combinations because it is the dominant substrate in the rocky river included terrestrial vegetation canopy cover, aquatic macrophytes, algae, rock overhang, roots and woody debris. cover was given a ranking from 0 to 100%, and corresponding categories 1–10 were used in data analysis. to validate species identiﬁcation larval and juvenile n. mekist- ocholas were collected from the rocky river, north carolina on 28 june 2007. conﬁrmation of identiﬁ- cation was provided by preserving specimens from the rocky river and comparing to known specimens at the same life stage from the north carolina zoo in asheboro, nc, usa, which maintains a captive population of cape fear shiners. in 2008 larvae and juveniles were preserved on the following dates: 2 may, 12 june and 18 july (usfws permit #te163433-0). available habitat and use data were analyzed with principal components analysis (pca) with varimax rotation to maximise the variance of the squared loadings of a factor on all the variables in a factor matrix (ramsey & schafer 2002). principal compo- nents analysis was performed for habitat use data separated by year to examine annual variation. plots of combined loadings for each life stage and available habitat data are shown. frequency histograms were constructed for each habitat variable by year to compare available habitat to habitat used for larval, juvenile, and adult n. mekistocholas. kolmogrov- smirnov (k-s) two-sample tests were used to compare depth, current velocity, and substrate, which were treated as continuous habitat variables, to compare habitat used in each life-history stage to available habitat. chi-square two-sample tests were use to compare cover, which was treated as a categorical variable. each life history stage, larvae, juvenile, and adult was then compared to other size classes for each of the three habitat variables measured using k-s tests to see if habitat use at stages differed for all dates. all table 1. categories used in

mekistocholas eggs and fry were obtained from the captive population at the north carolina zoo to conduct a simulated stream tank experiment to facilitate comparisons of habitat choice in early life in the laboratory to that of natural conditions. larval and juvenile habitat choice was measured in a 20 g aquarium, 0.78 m long, 0.32 m wide, 0.32 m deep, and a large indoor 270 g tank, 1.8 m long, 0.7 m wide, 1 m deep; aquatic eco-systems, inc., apopka, fl. tanks had identical designs in terms of arrangement of habitat variables, with the exception of current veloc- ity. a factorial design with all treatment combinations possible for each trial was used to assess habitat use within both tanks. response to two current velocities, two depths, and two substrates were tested in a 20 g tank for the ﬁrst two age classes at 30 days and 56 days development. two second nature 640 powerhead pumps 0.02 hp, suspended in the water column were used to generate water current. shallow depths were achieved by using clay bricks 19.5 cm long, to elevate the substrates on one side of the tank. gravel and small cobble substrates were placed in random design determined by coin toss within the small tank. juvenile habitat preferences were tested within a large tank in response to three current velocities, two depths and two substrates. juveniles were tested at 70, 90 and 125 days development. a 1 ⁄ 3 horsepower low head pump was used to generate water current on one end of the tank. water was pumped through two pvc tubes 0.6 m long with holes every 2.5 cm for uniform ﬂow the length of the tank. shallow depths were achieved by using 61 cm long solid cinder blocks stacked two deep the full length of the tank. gravel and mixed small and large cobble substrates were placed in 37.9 l rubbermaid tubs, and separated in tubs with plastic lawn edging. tubs were randomly arranged with respect to substrate combinations within current velocity and depth treatments by coin toss. notropis mekistocholas larvae and juveniles were chosen haphazardly from holding tanks and placed in groups of three in trials lasting 10 min each. fish were introduced in random locations throughout the tank for each trial. general observations of ﬁsh behaviour were noted during the 5 min acclimation period. after 5 min, the pump providing water current was turned on. fish habitat selectivity was noted every 30 s for 5 min for a total of 10 observations per trial. forty trials were conducted with larvae, and 60 total trials 90 were conducted with juveniles. there were 20 trials conducted for each size class. current velocity pref- erences, depth, and substrate choice were observed at the mesolarval, metalarval, and early, mid, and late juvenile stages. speciﬁc habitat measurements along with comparisons of habitat use were made within the tank in relation to ﬁsh choice. mesolarvae and metalarvae trial data were separated from juvenile trials because the larger tank tested preference of three current velocities in contrast to the smaller tank, which only tested preference of two current velocities. time in seconds and size were treated as response variables in both small and large tank analyses. time corresponded to the amount of time ﬁsh spent in a speciﬁc suite of randomly arranged habitat variables. larval and juvenile tank data were analyzed separately from another using a general linear model (glm) multivariate analysis of variance (manova) in spss (ramsey & schafer 2002). there were a total of 100 trials conducted at various times of day for ﬁve size classes: mesolarvae 7–12 mm, metalarvae 14–16 mm, early juvenile 20–24 mm, juvenile 23–32 mm and late juvenile 31–36 mm. intervals of development follow fuiman et al. (1983). results habitat use – ﬁeld notropis mekistocholas (larvae, juveniles and adults) were always found in shoals, rifﬂes, or runs, but not pools, consistent with previous ﬁndings for adults (howard 2003). results from comparison of available habitat to use indicated all life stages of n. mekist- ocholas chose depths that were signiﬁcantly different from available in 2007, but not 2008. temporal variability in microhabitat selection was apparent in 2007 and 2008. seasonally, in may 2007, adults chose depths that differed signiﬁcantly from available (p = 0.006). frequency histograms illustrating available habitat and use in each life history stage suggest differential use of habitat variables by all size classes (fig. 2(a–d)). trends from frequency histograms of habitat used in 2007 and 2008 indicated larvae used different depths from juveniles and adults, and juveniles used deeper depths than larvae and more shallow depths than adults. all life stages of n. mekistocholas used coarse substrates and intermediate amounts of cover. avail- able habitat and use by larval, juvenile, and adult n. mekistocholas was combined for each habitat variable measured and compared across years for 2007 and 2008. kolmogrov-smirnov tests indicated habitat used by each life stage was not signiﬁcantly different from other life stages. habitat used by each life stage for all variables was not signiﬁcantly habitat use of larval and juvenile notropis mekistocholas adult use juvenile use larval use available (a) depth y c n e u q e r f 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0–10 11–20 21–30 31–40 41–50 51–60 61–70 71–80 81–90 91–100 101–110 adult use juvenile use larval use available depth (cm) current velocity (b) y c n e u q e r f 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0–0.02 0.021–0.04 0.041–0.06 0.061–0.08 0.081–0.1 0.11–0.31 0.32–0.51 current velocity (m·s–1) (c) 160 y c n e u q e r f (d) y c n e u q e r f 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 substrate adult use juvenile use larval use available 1 2 3 5 7 4 substrate category 6 8 9 10 cover adult use juvenile use larval use available 0–1 1–2 2–3 3–4 4–5 5–6 6–7 7–8 8–9 9–10 cover category fig. 2.

preferentially chose current velocity and depth habitats (table 4). juveniles showed pref- erences for moderate and fast current velocities 0.05– )1 (p = 0.015). juveniles also 0.10, and >0.13 mæs chose deeper water 35–55 cm (p < 0.001), in contrast to mesolarvae and metalarvae, who chose shallow depths. speciﬁc substrate choice was not signiﬁcant for mesolarvae, metalarvae, or all three sizes of juveniles in tank trials in the laboratory (tables 3 and 4). column depths discussion all life stages of n. mekistocholas use shoal, rifﬂe, and run mesohabitats, but within these habitats, larvae, juveniles, and adults use different microhabitats and select habitat variables that differ is those of available. our results for adults support howard (2003) who also found that the species was restricted to shoal, rifﬂe, and run mesohabitats with high habitat heterogeneity. we observed ontenogentic shifts in habitat use, and found that juvenile and adult habitat use was more similar during 2008. from what and habitat requirements larval and juvenile abundance of minnows has been shown to be particularly sensitive to ﬂow conditions (schlosser 1985), and ability of age-0 cyprinids to determine variations in current velocity over small spatial scales for multiple developmental stages is dependent upon discharge (freeman et al. 2001; garner 2001). we found signiﬁcant preferences for depth and current velocities in laboratory trials for larval and juvenile cape fear shiners, with larvae preferring lower velocities than juveniles. focal depth was signiﬁcantly different from available for larvae, juveniles, and adults in the rocky river in 2007, and larval and juvenile size classes chose depths preferentially in lab tank experiments. notropis mekistocholas larvae chose shallow habitats <5 cm deep in both the mesolarval and metalarval stages in an experimental setting, in contrast to the choice of deeper habitats >35 cm by three age classes of juveniles. use of shallow water habitats by cyprinid larvae in ﬂoodplains and regulated and unregulated rivers has been documented in the u.s. and europe (turner et al. 1994; scheidegger & bain 1995; garner 1996). notropis mekistocholas juveniles had greater focal depth overlap with larvae in early summer, and this shifted to overlap with adults in late summer in 2007 and 2008. principal components analysis component plots are consistent with these observations, and juveniles were closer in use of habitat variables to adults than larvae in 2008. notropis mekistocholas adults occupy lower-pelagic habitats than closely related swallowtail shiners, n. procne. in july and august of 2007 & 2008, at total lengths of 15–25 mm, n. mekistocholas juveniles were observed schooling with adults lower in the water column than larvae. shifts to more coarse substrates corresponding with ontogenetic development (simonovic et al. 1999), in the juvenile and adult stages were not observed for n. mekistocholas. differing sizes of n. mekistocholas were not found over substrates that were signiﬁcantly different life stages, and speciﬁc substrate preference was not signiﬁcant for mesolarvae, metalarvae, or all three sizes of juveniles in tank trials in the laboratory. from available or other juvenile and adult cyprinids are known to exhibit high overlap between age groups in use of rifﬂe fig. 4. principal

shiner n. petersoni, exhibited a similar ontogenetic shift to n. mekistocholas in juvenile stages, and schooled with adults after their second month of life in the cape fear river at approximately 18 mm tl (davis & louder 1971). notropis mekistocholas shifts in habitat use are probably associated with changes in ontogeny and development, and reveal important intraspeciﬁc habitat segregation and possible resource partitioning among size classes. the eurasian min- now, phoxinus phoxinus differed in its microhabitat use among developmental stages in the river lee, ireland (simonovic et al. 1999). larvae favored shallow near-shore habitats, while juvenile p. phox- inus occupied signiﬁcantly deeper and wider areas, and adults differed from juveniles, occupying faster ﬂowing areas further from river margins. these ontogenetic shifts were likely a response to lower predation risk and greater swimming capability of juvenile and adult minnows (schlosser 1987). inves- tigators have used experimental stream systems in research on ﬁshes for a wide range of applications (gelwick & matthews 1993), and these have potential for advanced knowledge of ﬁsh ecology and behaviour. with replication and reasonable conﬁgurations of habitat variables, these systems allow control of variables not possible under natural conditions. using experimental streams for research on species that are endangered, threatened, or of conservation concern has the ability to provide insight otherwise unattainable. use of an experimen- tal stream system in this study was unlike any other study conducted with an endangered cyprinid, and was effective at separating important habitat variables for n. mekistocholas in the laboratory. the experi- mental approach of the study provided validation of important habitat parameters measured under natural conditions. conclusions notropis mekistocholas is restricted to shoal, rifﬂe or run mesohabitat with relatively high current velocities, variable water depths, and coarse substrates (howard 2003; pottern & huish 1985). the species is not found throughout the river, and may need to disperse through an inhospitable matrix from patch to patch, as has been shown for other patch-restricted cyprinids (johnston 2000). within appropriate mesohabitat patches, larval and juvenile n. mekistocholas use different microhab- itats. as juveniles grow, they eventually use the same microhabitats as adults. heterogeneity and natural variability of current velocity and depth are important for supporting all life stages of n. mekistocholas, and maintenance of minimum ﬂows is potentially important for this species. 94 acknowledgements we would like to thank mary freeman, craig guyer, david rabon, mandy howard hewitt, wayne starnes, pat rakes, j.r. shute,
