allen et al. 2002). black- ﬁsh were widely distributed in victoria, australia; however many regions within the historical distribu- tion of this species have seen a decline in both distribution and abundance (nre 2002). to date there are no published studies on the movement and habitat preference of blackﬁsh using radio telemetry. koehn (1986) used tags to obtain a preliminary estimate of home range between 25 and 30 m for blackﬁsh in armstrong creek, victoria. lintermans (1998) while tagging the two-spined blackﬁsh (g. bispinosus sanger) in cotter river, act showed that the species is relatively sedentary with an adult home range of 15 m. however, this limited information on the movement and home range of blackﬁsh, has been derived from data collected only during daytime using mark– recapture techniques. when such information is used for management decisions or activities (e.g. habitat modelling or determination of instream ﬂow require- ments), critical aspects of the species preference or 285 khan et al. needs during other periods may be missing with implications for ecological knowledge and manage- ment of this nocturnal species. information on the movement of blackﬁsh has also been based on large sampling intervals using mark–recapture techniques thus providing limited information on the movement of individual ﬁsh between the sampling occasions. the present study used radio telemetry and mark– recapture techniques to provide information on move- ment, home range and habitat preference of blackﬁsh in a highly modiﬁed agricultural stream. the study also determined whether there was a difference in habitat use and movement by blackﬁsh at different times of the day and whether translocated blackﬁsh can return to their home pools. as blackﬁsh are nocturnal and are presumed to be active at night, it is important to determine whether they occupy similar night-time foraging and daytime refuge areas because habitat use can vary substantially both on a daily and seasonal time scale. materials and methods study sites the study was conducted on six sites in birch creek (victoria, australia) between october 2001 to may 2002 and november to december 2002. the creek lies in the headwaters of the loddon river. the creek runs for approximately 45 km from its headwaters ﬂowing through the township of smeaton and then to the north- east of clunes (latitude 37°24¢s, longitude 144°00¢e; fig. 1). the creek joins creswick creek and at the conﬂuence named tullaroop creek, which joins the loddon river to the north. birch creek ﬂows through a gently undulating plain formed by episodic extrusion of lava from numerous volcanoes which gave rise to the underlying quaternary olivine basalt geology (schoknecht 1988). birch creek ﬂows throughout the year because of its regulated nature with water periodically released in summer for crop irrigation purposes. the water release occurs at different times of the day but during november to december 2002, water release occurred largely at night resulted in variable water ﬂows at day and night. land adjacent to the creek is used predominantly for broad acre cropping and as pasture for grazing livestock. exotic willows dominated the riparian cover of the creek. the two willow species present were crack willow (salix fragilis var fragilis) and weeping willow (salix baby- lonica), with the latter less common. that the mean width of the sites ranged between 4.3 and 5.6 m and mean depth between 32.3 and 41.4 cm (table 1). mean surface water velocity ranged )1. undercut banks and between 28 and 57 cm s boulders were the main instream cover. the substrate 286 was a mixture of bedrock, boulders, pebble, sand and cobble (table 1). a constructed weir of approximately 0.3 m height (passable by ﬁsh) served as the upstream boundary of site 3. however, other sites had no natural or artiﬁcial barriers upstream or downstream. the majority of the sites consisted of large but not deep pools. transects perpendicular to stream ﬂow were positioned at all sites at 1 m intervals and permanent markers were installed to monitor ﬁsh movements, their utilisation of instream cover habitat and other physical variables. blackﬁsh capture blackﬁsh were collected at all the sites using a pulsed dc powered backpack electroﬁsher (model 12; smith- root inc., vancouver, wa, usa) set at 600 v. collection effort was spread throughout the site to collect a sample of ﬁsh representative of the resident population. the exact position where each individual was caught was recorded to the nearest centimetre. short-term movement using radio telemetry short-term movement of the blackﬁsh using radio telemetry was determined at two sites (sites 1 and 3; fig. 1; table 1) between november and december 2002. a total of 10 ﬁsh were selected (prerequisite for selection being the largest ﬁsh to maximise ﬁsh size relative to transmitter weight), four at site 1 and six at site 3. a single stage 151 mhz radio transmitter with a battery life of 12 days was attached externally to each ﬁsh. transmitters (model lt1; titley electronics, ballina, nsw, australia) weighed 600 mg in water and 800 mg in air, with dimensions of 3 · 8 mm, each having a unique frequency. fish were anaesthetised in 10 l creek water with 10 ml clove oil as described in anderson et al. (1997). after regular opercular movement had ceased, each individual was weighed and total length measured to the nearest millimetre. fish were then placed dorsal side down on a moist wooden board and held in a position during surgery. transmitters were threaded with mono- ﬁlament plastic thread and the thread inserted by needle through the musculature of the upper back, immedi- ately anterior of the insertion point of the dorsal ﬁn. the transmitter was then tied close to the body with a nonslip knot, and the antenna was positioned along the dorsal ﬁn. earlier aquarium trials using dummy trans- mitters (n ¼ 6) over a fortnight on blackﬁsh did not show adverse effects or any observable change in locomotion ability and all ﬁsh retained tags. fish were placed in holding buckets for a minimum 1 h recovery period, during which time ﬁsh were observed fre- quently. after recovery they were released as close as possible to the initial point of capture. habitat use and movement of g.

length of the reach were used as reference points for the location of the ﬁsh. fish location and movements were monitored using a sequential portable radio receiver (titley electronics) and hand-held h-antennae. the accuracy of this location technique was estimated using hidden trans- mitters under ﬁeld conditions and location accuracy was high (0.2 ± 0.01 m, mean ± se, n ¼ 20). in addition, the position of the each individual ﬁsh was conﬁrmed at the end of tracking period by enclosing the small area assumed to contain the ﬁsh and then recapturing the ﬁsh by electroﬁshing. at the end of the 8 day tracking period, seven blackﬁsh were re-captured using electroﬁshing (four at site 1, and three at site 3) and were transported and released 40 m either upstream or downstream. the assumption was made that the ﬁsh were transported outside their home range as determined by the above tracking experiment. the translocated ﬁsh were tracked three times a day for 5 days similar to the above procedure. this experiment aimed to determine whether blackﬁsh return to a home range following experimental displacement. the remaining three ﬁsh at site 3 were tracked for a further 24 h at 3 h intervals. 287 khan et al. this was to determine ﬁner scale diel movements of blackﬁsh as the 8 h sampling intervals may have missed speciﬁc movements during the day and night. at the end of the experiment all ﬁsh were recaptured to remove transmitters and determine the effects of transmitters on their general condition. long-term movement using mark–recapture long-term movement of the blackﬁsh using mark– recapture was determined at six sites between october 2001 and may 2002 over an 8 month period. a total of 113 ﬁsh were tagged with sequentially numbered modiﬁed plastic dart taggs (hallmark, australia) at all six sites with numbers at each site ranging between 13 and 20. anaesthetisation, attachment procedures, length and weight measurements and release proce- dures were similar as described above. all the six sites were electroﬁshed to capture the tagged ﬁsh and record their daytime refuge and location relative to the permanent bank markers. initially ﬁsh at all sites were monitored 7 days after initial release, followed by 11 days, then fortnightly for 6 weeks, then monthly for 5 months to assess movement and habitat use. habitat utilisation measurements the instream physical and cover variables utilised by blackﬁsh over the study period (both short-term and long-term) were measured quantitatively. in the short- term movement study, after locating each individual ﬁsh, its position was marked relative to the perma- nent bank markers to the nearest 10 cm on a measuring tape. once distance along the transect was measured, then the perpendicular distance to the ﬁshes position was measured to provide precise positioning in 2-d space. for each individual ﬁsh )1) and depth location, surface water velocity (cm s (cm) were recorded at the marked position at each tracking event. however, to minimise disturbance to the ﬁsh, instream cover utilised by each individual ﬁsh at each tracking event was measured at the end of the tracking study. in the long-term movement, the tagged ﬁsh were captured at each sampling event using a pulsed dc backpack electroﬁsher. the exact position where each individual ﬁsh was ﬁrst seen was marked with a numbered ﬂoat attached by a cord to a sinker (gatz et al. 1987). the ﬁsh were placed in a bucket for latter data collection with a number corresponding to the number on the weight and ﬂoat in the creek. after electroﬁshing was completed, habitat parameters were measured at the position of each ﬂoat. the habitat parameters quantiﬁed were water depth, surface water velocity and the type of instream cover used such as 288 undercut banks, boulders, open areas. instream vegetation and data analysis data for each individual ﬁsh were analysed to calculate its home range, distance moved from the original location at each sampling event, cumulative distance moved over sampling period and daily movement as described in fig. 2. daily movement data during radio tracking were obtained for each blackﬁsh by summing the distance moved between successive observations for each day of the study period. the deﬁnition of home range is, as deﬁned by gerking (1953), the area over which the animal normally travels. the home range in the present study refers to the length of the river stretch used by the ﬁsh, and was calculated as the furthest distance upstream and/or downstream over which a ﬁsh moved within the study period. as the data were not normally distributed, nonparametric kruskal– wallis test was used to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in movement, use of depth, velocity and instream cover among sampling times in a day (spss 2000). if signiﬁcant differences were detected among sampling times in the movement and habitat use post hoc comparisons were made using bonferroni test. results short-term movement river blackﬁsh used in the study varied from 16.3 to 20.5 cm in length, 40–80 g in weight and the ratio of transmitter weight to ﬁsh weight varied from 1 to 2%. the radio tracking data were collected from all 10 ﬁsh e2–e1 e3–e2 e1–e0 e c n a t s i d t e n l a n i g i r o m o r f  e g n a r e m o h m a e r t s p u m a e r t s n w o d 15 10

the transmitters except for slight swelling at some attachment points with the general condition of the ﬁsh excellent. all radio-tracked individuals showed strong afﬁnity to a pool. blackﬁsh did not exhibit long distance movements with almost all ﬁsh found within a short distance from their original position (table 2). how- ever, small movements within the pool were very common which resulted in relatively large cumulative movements. mean daily movement varied from 6.9 to 18.9 m except for ﬁsh 9, which had a mean daily movement of 30 m (table 2). of all individuals, ﬁsh 2 showed strongest afﬁnity to its original position with small movements from the origin whereas ﬁsh 9 showed large movements from its original position (table 2). all individuals occupied well-deﬁned home ranges over the study period. home ranges were generally very small (10–25.9 m) except for ﬁsh 9, which had a home range of 44.5 m (table 2). there were no signiﬁcant differences in mean movement between the three sampling times within each day (afternoon, night and morning, kruskal– wallis test, p ¼ 0.95; table 3). over a 24-h cycle there were no signiﬁcant differences in individual table 2. mean daily

position (±1 m) within 48 h. the exception was ﬁsh 6, which settled in close proximity to its translocated position. the most rapid return time to the original position was 8 h (ﬁsh 8) and the maximum return time was 48 h (ﬁsh 3). long-term movement there were no observable ill effects of the repeated electroﬁshing on the ﬁsh in the long-term movement studies of mark–recapture. individual river blackﬁsh showed afﬁnity to a site with the recapture rate above 90% across all sampling events. from 113 ﬁsh only 12 were unaccounted for over the 7 month study period. however, there were a lot of small-scale movements within sites. over 60% of ﬁsh were located at least 1 m from their previous position for samples taken 4 days apart (table 4). this increased to 70–84% as the time between consecutive sample events increased between 7 and 40 days. on average ﬁsh were found approximately 1.5 m from their original location when sampled at a 4 day interval. as the time between sampling events increased, ﬁsh were found, on average, 2–3 m from their original location. even after 206 days ﬁsh were found, on average, only 3.2 m from their original location. during that time, average cumulative movements were relatively large (mean cumulative distance moved 22.3 m). habitat use by blackﬁsh blackﬁsh utilised a mean depth varying between 14 and 67 cm over the study period. a high proportion of blackﬁsh were recorded in water depth of 20–60 cm. over the short-term monitoring, blackﬁsh exclusively utilised these depth ranges (20–60 cm); however, over table 3. mean movement and

high proportion of the between 4 and 34.5 cm s blackﬁsh (70–100%) were recorded in water velocities )1. there were signiﬁcant differences in of 0–20 cm s velocity utilisation between afternoon, night and morning (kruskal-wallis test, p ¼ 0.01, table 3). higher water velocities surrounded all individual blackﬁsh at night and morning compared with after- noon (table 3). blackﬁsh were strongly associated with the instream cover habitats of undercut banks, boulders and instream vegetation. during radio tracking a low proportion of blackﬁsh also occupied coarse woody debris and open areas. there was a signiﬁcant difference in the utilisation of instream cover habitats (undercut banks, open areas) by blackﬁsh between afternoon, night and morning (kruskal–wallis test, p ¼ 0.006)0.001; table 3). the majority of blackﬁsh utilised undercut banks in the daytime but moved to open and boulder habitats at night, returning to undercut banks in the morning. discussion in the present study there were no negative impacts of transmitters and plastic tags on the condition of blackﬁsh presumably because the ratio of transmitter/ tag to body weight was low. the signal was retained from all transmitters and 100% success was recorded with retention of the transmitters by blackﬁsh. addi- tionally, recapture rate of the marked ﬁsh was high, with over 90% of marked ﬁsh being recaptured. the few ﬁsh not recaptured may have died or emigrated. the reasons for high success of signal reception from all the transmitters and high recapture rates were the shallow nature of the creek and small home range of blackﬁsh. water depth at the study sites rarely exceeded 50 cm. all monitored blackﬁsh consistently remained with- in the same pool and showed strong ﬁdelity to the 290 large mean same area within the pool, thereby supporting the idea that blackﬁsh have strong sedentary habits (linter- mans 1998). the results from the mark–recapture and telemetry studies on blackﬁsh are similar and indicate that blackﬁsh in the birch creek displayed relatively little movement throughout the study period. afﬁnity to a pool but frequent movements within a pool is indicated by the observation that blackﬁsh only moved small distances from their original position but had relatively cumulative movements (55–151 m) by the end of the study. however, mean cumulative movement recorded during long-term mon- itoring was low (22.3 m) by the end of the study (7 months). as cumulative movement was measured as the recorded change in position from the last sampling event and sampling events were from 4 days to 1 month apart, the cumulative movements are a severe underes- timate of actual ﬁsh movements. blackﬁsh typically occupied restricted home ranges throughout the study period. these results are similar to those obtained from other studies on blackﬁsh (25–30 m; koehn 1986) and two-spined blackﬁsh (15 m; lintermans 1998) using mark–recapture methods. of the seven blackﬁsh translocated beyond their recorded home range, six individuals returned close to their original position. the ability of ﬁsh to accurately recognise the habitats in which they live has been demonstrated for a wide variety of species. in one of the earliest studies on translocated ﬁsh, longear sunﬁsh (lipomis megalotis) that had been transplanted into foreign reaches of a stream often returned to their normal home range within days of displacement (gerking 1953). similarly, radio-tagged murray cod (maccullochella peelii peelii) that had migrated up to 100-km upstream during the spawning season returned to the same woody debris complex that they had inhabited prior to spawning (koehn 1996). similar behaviour has been reported for the mary river cod (maccullochella peelii mariensis) by simpson & mapleston (2002), who showed that cod were able to locate a previous home range returning to a speciﬁc logpile after an absence of more than 3 months. the consistent homing of the blackﬁsh to its core area suggests that these ﬁsh have a strong homing sense. blackﬁsh were able to accurately locate their original position when translocated both upstream and down- stream. this suggests that blackﬁsh have either strong visual recognition of the habitat and/or have strong nonvisual sensory structures. in the present study, only one individual blackﬁsh did not return to the original location and occupied a new site. the reason may be that the new site provided preferable habitat; however, as the observations were over a 5 day period (because of the limited battery life of the transmitters) it is possible that the individual may have returned to the original location after a longer time period. radio-tracked blackﬁsh appeared to move similar distances throughout the day and night. blackﬁsh are nocturnal feeders (jackson 1978; koehn et al. 1994) with active feeding during the night, however food items have sometimes been common in the guts sampled during day time (m.t. khan, unpublished data). prior to the present radio-tracking study it was predicted that blackﬁsh would make large movements during the night hours for foraging. however, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the net movements of blackﬁsh between morning, afternoon and night sampling. similarly when blackﬁsh were tracked at 3 h intervals no signiﬁcant differences were recorded between day and night movements. although there were no signiﬁcant differences in the movement of radio-tracked blackﬁsh between day and night, there were signiﬁcant differences in the type of habitat used at different times of the day. during the day, high utilisation of undercut banks and boulders the ﬁsh. however, at night was recorded for all blackﬁsh were equally abundant in open areas, undercut banks and boulders. this suggests that during day blackﬁsh ﬁnd refuge in complex undercut banks and boulder cover. at night blackﬁsh utilise undercut banks less frequently, but increased use of open areas presumably for ambush foraging. the increased use of boulders and open areas at night may be related to a higher density of food resources such as drifting macroinvertebrates in these habitats. thus it is speculated that blackﬁsh move between refuges during the day and to open, faster velocity feeding sites at night, hence the net movements are similar between day and night but the function and location of the movements differ. large differences were also recorded in the type of instream cover used by blackﬁsh in the present study than that in previous studies. for example, jackson (1978) found a close association between blackﬁsh and stream snag areas. koehn (1986) showed that blackﬁsh were positively associated with organic debris 50% in density. these studies were conducted in streams with undisturbed native riparian vegetation and the streams contained considerable quantities of woody debris. in the present study, blackﬁsh were most strongly associated with undercut banks, habitat use and movement of g. marmoratus suggesting that in agricultural streams such as the study creek, with heavily modiﬁed riparian vegetation and little woody debris, blackﬁsh occupied novel habitats. most undercut banks appeared to be a complex of cavities and hollows frequently armoured by willow root mats. it is possible that these are used as spawning sites, both because of the frequency of blackﬁsh occupation and that they were the only suitable locations in some silt-lined channels devoid of large woody debris. spawning of blackﬁsh occurs between october and november when water temper- atures exceeds 16 °c (cadwallader & backhouse 1983). the spawning period of blackish coincided with the long-term movement study; however, we could not conclusively identify the spawning locations of blackﬁsh in birch creek (m. t. khan, unpublished data). two interesting conclusions can be drawn from observations of habitat use by blackﬁsh in a modiﬁed stream. first, river restoration works must be informed by empirical evidence of habitat ﬂexibility in target organisms. in some locations woody debris may be appropriate and in other circumstances undercut banks may achieve a similar outcome for blackﬁsh habitat restoration. secondly, the undercut banks in the study creeks were associated with willows, a declared weed of national signiﬁcance. willow removal is ongoing along birch creek and many other victorian streams and the consequences for instream habitat and aquatic fauna have not been examined. the apparent preference of blackﬁsh for slower )1) and deeper waters water velocities (0–20 cm s (40–60 cm) in the present study is consistent with (1994) who found the ﬁndings of koehn et al. )1 blackﬁsh had a preference for velocities <20 cm s and that the depth preference of blackﬁsh increased with size. this is also consistent with maximisation of net energy gain to grow (werner & hall 1974) and the predator avoidance hypothesis (harvey & stewart 1991). dobson & baldwin (1982a,b) studied the physiology of blackﬁsh and found that the body shape together with a high percentage of white muscles suggested a lack of endurance for the species and an inability to cope with extended periods of steady-state current. large-bodied ﬁshes such as blackﬁsh in the present study are presumed to be more vulnerable to terrestrial predation (harvey & stewart 1991; lonzarich & quinn 1995) and thus avoid shallow areas. it has been hypothesised that predation risk is greatest for large ﬁsh in shallow habitats where wading or diving predators forage, whereas for small ﬁsh it is greatest in deep habitats where large piscivorous ﬁsh predominate (power 1984, 1987; schlosser 1987). terrestrial predators that have been recorded in the study creeks included birds such as cormorants, azure kingﬁsher, and herons and mammals including 291 khan et al. the water rat and platypus. large ﬁsh species may also avoid shallow waters because at less depth they are less manoeuvrable and become easily vulnerable to predators. in the present study there were signiﬁcant differ- ences in the water velocity surrounding blackﬁsh between day and night with higher velocities utilised at night and morning compared with the afternoon. initially it was speculated that these differences were the result of the different instream habitats used by blackﬁsh during day and night. for example, at night blackﬁsh were recorded in open areas which are generally associated with high water velocity. how- ever, a confounding factor was the water release cycle from newlyn reservoir, upstream of site 1. the release, for irrigation purposes, occurred at night-time which resulted in high water ﬂows at night. during the night, water level and ﬂow was high at both sites (sites 1 and 3) when compared with daytime (m. & t. khan, personal observations taken during tracking, novem- ber 2002), this resulted in diel differences in water velocity at all habitats. resumen 1. utilizando te´cnicas teleme´tricas (n ¼ 19) y de marcado- recaptura (n ¼ 113) durante los perı´odos octubre 2001- mayo 2002 y noviembre-diciembre 2002, respectivamente, estudia- mos los movimientos y el uso de ha´bitat de gadopsis marmoratus en birch creek, un rı´o muy modiﬁcado de la regio´n central de australia. 2. g. marmoratus mostro´ pequen˜os ‘‘home ranges’’ de 10 a 26 metros con gran aﬁnidad por pozas. sin embargo, pequen˜os movimientos dentro de las pozas fueron comunes y resultaron en relativamente grandes movimientos acumula- dos. a escala circadiana, no hubo diferencias signiﬁcativas entre los movimientos durante el dı´a y la noche (kruskal- wallis, p ¼ 0.95). seis de los siete individuos que fueron movidos 40 metros aguas arriba o aguas abajo de sus posiciones originales volvieron en menos de 48 horas, sugiriendo una fuerte aﬁnidad no solo por las pozas sino tambie´n por la pequen˜a regio´n dentro de cada poza. g. marmoratus utilizaron los caudales menores (0–20 cm )1) y las aguas mas profundas (40–60 cm) y estuvieron seg. fuertemente asociados a ha´bitats con cobertura y piedras. (kruskal-wallis, 3. detectamos diferencias p £ 0.01) en la cobertura y en la velocidad del agua utilizadas por g. marmoratus durante el dı´a respecto de la noche. mientras que por la noche, utilizaron a´reas abiertas con mayores velocidades, durante el dı´a utilizaron complejos bancos con cobertura y menores velocidades de agua. signiﬁcativas acknowledgements the work on the radio telemetry was supported by a grant from the river basin management society to minal t. khan. mk is to the society for their support and also to the thankful university of ballarat for awarding a publication writing 292 scholarship to write this manuscript. the authors are also thank heath cameron for his help in the ﬁeld with tagging blackﬁsh and anonymous reviewers whose suggestions improved the manuscript. references allen, g.r., midgley, s.h. & allen, m. 2002. field guide to the freshwater ﬁshes of australia. perth, western australia: western australian museum. anderson, w.g., mckinley, r.s. & colavecchia, m. 1997. the use of clove oil as an anesthetic for rainbow trout and its effects on swimming performance. north american journal of fisheries management 17: 301–307. cadwallader, p.l. & backhouse, g.n. 1983. a guide to the freshwater ﬁsh of victoria. melbourne, vic.: government printers. dobson, g.p. & baldwin, j. 1982a. regulation of blood oxygen afﬁnity in the australian freshwater blackﬁsh gadopsis marmoratus richardson. i. correlations between oxygen binding properties, habitat and spawning behaviour. journal of experimental biology 99: 223–224. dobson, g.p. & baldwin, j. 1982b. regulation of blood oxygen afﬁnity in the australian freshwater blackﬁsh gadopsis marmoratus richardson. ii. thermal acclimation. journal of experimental biology 99: 245–254. gatz, a.j., sale, m.j. & loar, j.m. 1987. habitat shifts in rainbow trout: competitive inﬂuences of brown_trout. oecologia 74: 7–19. gerking, s.d. 1953. evidence for the concepts of home range and territory in stream ﬁshes. ecology 34: 347–365. harvey, b.c. & stewart, a.j. 1991. fish size and habitat depth relationships in headwater streams. oecologia 87: 336–342. jackson, p.d. 1978. benthic invertebrate fauna and feeding relationships of brown_trout, salmo_trutta linnaeus, and river blackﬁsh, gadopsis marmoratus richardson, in the aber- feldy river, victoria. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 29: 725–742. koehn, j.d. 1986. approaches to determining ﬂow and habitat requirements for native freshwater ﬁsh in victoria. in: campbell, i.c., ed. stream protection: the management of rivers for instream uses. melbourne, vic.: chisholm institute of technology, pp. 95–115. koehn, j.d. 1996. habitats and movements of freshwater ﬁsh in the murrray-darling basin. in: banens, r.j. & lehane, r., eds. proceedings of the 1995 riverine research forum. brisbane, canberra: murray-darling basin commission, pp. 27–32. koehn, j.d. & o’connor, w.g. 1990. biological information for management of native freshwater ﬁsh in victoria. melbourne, vic.: department of conservation and environment. koehn, j.d., o’connor, n.a. & jackson, p.d. 1994. seasonal and size-related variation in microhabitat use by a southern victorian stream ﬁsh assemblage. australian journal of marine and freshwater research 45: 1353–1366. lintermans, m. 1998. the ecology of the two-spined blackﬁsh gadopsis bispinosus (pisces: gadopsidae). msc thesis. canberra: australian national university. lonzarich, d.g. & quinn, t.p. 1995. experimental evidence for the effect of depth structure on the distribution, growth, and survival of stream ﬁshes. canadian journal of zoology 73: 2223–2230. nre 2002. victorian aquatic fauna database, data for the loddon river system. melbourne, victoria: department of natural resources and environment. power, m.e. 1984. depth distribution of armoured cat- ﬁshes: predator-induced resource avoidance. ecology 65: 523–528. power, m.e. 1987. predator avoidance by grazing ﬁshes in temperate and tropical streams: importance of stream depth and prey size. in: kerfoot, w.c. & sih, a. eds. predation: direct and indirect impacts in aquatic communities. dart- mouth: university press of new england, pp. 333–351. habitat use and movement of g. marmoratus schlosser, i.j. 1987. the role of predation in age- and size- related habitat use by stream ﬁshes. ecology 68: 651–659. schoknecht, n.r. 1988. land inventory of the loddon river catchment – a reconnaissance survey. melbourne, victoria: department of conservation forests and lands, and com- monwealth department of primary industry. simpson, r.r. & mapleston, a.j. 2002. movements and habitat use by the endangered australian freshwater mary river cod, maccullochella peelii mariensis. environmental biology of fishes 65: 401–410. werner, e.e. & hall, d.j. 1974. optimal foraging and the size selection of prey by the bluegill sunﬁsh. ecology 55: 1042– 1052. 293
