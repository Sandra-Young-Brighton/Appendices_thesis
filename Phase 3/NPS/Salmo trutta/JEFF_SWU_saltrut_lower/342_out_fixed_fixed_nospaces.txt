(1999) showed associations between genetic similarity and geographical dis- tance in atlantic salmon by using multilocus ﬁngerprinting. microsatellites are recently devel- oped molecular markers and are regarded as the most promising marker for detecting degree of genetic relatedness among individuals (e.g. quel- ler & goodnight 1989; blouin et al. 1996). the present study aims to test if there are differences in degrees of relatedness between cohorts of stream-living brown_trout and if there are any correlates between genetic relatedness and metric distances between individual pairs of trout that could facilitate kin selection. methods study site and biological material the study stream, fa¨ rsa˚ n (638130n, 168060e, 165 m a.s.l.) is a second order, 15.7 km long, tri- butary to the river ammera˚ n, situated in central sweden. it drains an area of 51.8 km2 and has an annual mean discharge of 0.47 m3/s. the stream is under inﬂuence of high spring ﬂows and during other seasons rapidly responding to rainfall when water levels rises quickly. the stream ﬂows through woodland and wetlands and is fed by both ground water and surface runoff. the total gradient of 2.1% is divided into fast running rapids and slower, deeper sections as well as pools. the full reach of the stream is populated by brown_trout and in the lower sections; bull- (cottus gobio l.), european minnow heads (phoxinus phoxinus l.) and grayling (thymallus_thymallus l.) have been observed. the upper reaches contain, except brown_trout, brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis mitchell). trout were col- lected by electroﬁshing a 50-m section in late september 1997, of the fa¨ rsa˚ n stream (corre- sponding to section g in carlsson & nilsson 2000). none or very little spawning takes place in this foraging and nursery area and most indi- viduals have immigrated from nearby spawning grounds. previous studies of the fa¨ rsa˚ n stream have shown that the population genetic structure of trout is stable over time, including this section (carlsson & nilsson 2000). at time of capture, each individual was placed in a numbered 5-l plastic bag ﬁlled with water, and the correspond- relatedness within and among brown_trout cohorts ing number was marked on a map (fig. 1). a total of 50 brown_trout were caught. all ﬁsh were later anaesthetised and measured for total length to the closest millimetre. a small piece of tissue was removed from the tail ﬁn. scales were sampled from all trout with lengths exceeding 60 mm. all ﬁsh were released alive after handling. according to scale readings, ﬁve age cohorts were present in the sample (0þ to 3þ and 5þ ﬁsh). only one trout of age 5þ was caught and therefore this cohort was excluded from all cohort comparisons. the low proportion (20% of total catch) of 0þ trout reﬂects both the low spawning activity in the area as well as the difﬁculties in catching 0þ trout by means of electroﬁshing. therefore, the 0þ sample does represent a lower proportion of the total fig. 1. map showing the location of the river ammera˚ n and the fa¨ rsa˚ n stream and the location and a schematic map of the study section.

(1999). the slopes of these regressions were compared among cohorts. a negative value would indicate that related individuals clustered together and the opposite for positive values. kruskal–wallis tests, mann–whitney tests, wilcoxon signed rank tests and pearson’s correlation test were per- formed using the software minitab. in all cases with multiple tests, signiﬁcance levels were adjusted using the sequential bonferroni techni- que (rice 1989). results microsatellite variability number of alleles per locus varied from two alleles at loci f43, ssa197 and ssosl311 13 alleles at locus ssa408uos (table 1). in total, 72 alleles could be detected from the 14 loci (table 2). four loci showed signiﬁcant deviations fromhardy–weinbergexpectations;however,only the ssa171 remained signiﬁcant after sequential bonferroni correction (initial a¼ 0.05/14 tests¼ 0.0036). heterozygosity deﬁciency was found at both loci ssa171 and ssosl311 but did not remain signiﬁcant after sequential bonferroni cor- rection (initial a¼ 0.05/14 tests¼ 0.0036). hetero- zygosity excess was found at locus ssa85 as well as ssosl85 but were not signiﬁcant after sequential bonferroni correction (initial a¼ 0.05/14 tests¼ 0.0036). twelve pairs of loci showed genotypic disequilibrium prior to sequential bonferroni cor- rection, but none remained signiﬁcant after cor- rection (initial a¼ 0.05/91 tests¼ 0.00055). even though the number of individuals within each cohort was small, we tested differences in allele frequencies among cohorts to estimate both temporal stability and family effects (allendorf & phelps 1981). allele frequency differences among cohorts were found at 10 occasions but only two remained signiﬁcant after sequential bonferroni correction (initial a¼ 0.05/14 tests¼ 0.0036). the locus ssosl85 showed different allele frequencies table 2. brown_trout alleles observed both in total and proportional abundance in four age cohorts at 14 microsatellite loci in the fa«

abundance in nine randomly drawn individuals (100 permutations). for details about computation, see text. when comparing the 0þ and 1þ cohort. ssa408uos showed different allele frequencies between the 0þ and 2þ cohorts. the overall number of alleles within each cohort varied from 44 alleles in the 3þ cohort to 59 alleles within the 1þ cohort. in order to detect biases due to the different sample sizes within each cohort, nine ﬁsh were randomly drawn 100 times from age cohorts 1þ and 2þ, whereas all 0þ ﬁsh were included (age cohort 3þ was excluded due to low numbers of individuals). average number of alleles per loci was calculated from the nine individuals from the 100 permutations. no statistical differences in number of alleles could be observed among the three cohorts (kruskal–wallis test, p > 0.05; table 2). the lack of consistent discrepancies from hardy–weinberg proportions, the similari- ties in number of alleles as well as the low degree of allele frequency differences among cohorts suggests that our sample was not heavily in- ﬂuenced by family effects (allendorf & phelps 1981). relatedness estimates average intracohort relatedness estimates varied from 0.009 within the 1þ cohort to 0.223 within the 2þ cohort. only the latter estimate was sig- niﬁcantly higher than zero (table 3). differences in the average intracohort relatedness were found among cohorts (kruskal–wallis test, p < 0.0001, table 3). the 2þ cohort had a signiﬁcantly higher average intracohort relatedness than both the 0þ and 1þ cohort (mann–whitney test, p¼ 0.0074 table 3. genetic

tests). the average relatedness of pooled juveniles (encom- passing 0þ and 1þ trout) was not different from zero whilst the pooled relatedness of mature and older trout (encompassing 2þ and 3þ trout) was signiﬁcantly higher than zero (table 3). more- over, these two-pooled groups had signiﬁcantly 237 carlsson & carlsson different average relatedness (mann–whitney test, p < 0.0001). the average individual regression slopes among individual cohorts varied from  0.0148 observed in the 3þ cohort to 0.0123 observed in the 0þ cohort (table 3). no slope was signiﬁcantly differ- ent from zero (table 3). though differences in the average individual slopes were found among co- horts (kruskal–wallis test, p¼ 0.003). signiﬁcant differences between pair of slopes were found between 0þ and 1þ cohort, 0þ and 3þ, 1þ and 3þ as well as between 2þ and 3þ (mann–whitney test, p¼ 0.0208, 0.0107, 0.0040, and 0.0338, res- pectively). however, only the difference between 1þ and 3þ remained signiﬁcant after sequential bonferroni correction (initial a¼ 0.05/6 tests¼ 0.0083). the highest average slope was found in the 0þ trout followed by 1þ, 2þ and ending with the lowest slope that was observed in the 3þ co- hort. these average individual regression slopes also decreased with the age of the cohort (pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient¼ 0.95, p¼ 0.05). signiﬁ- cant differences were also found between the pooled juveniles (encompassing 0þ and 1þ indi- viduals) and the pooled mature and older trout (encompassing 2þ and 3þ individuals) in average individual regression slopes (mann–whitney test, p¼ 0.0340, table 3). finally, the pooled juvenile individual regression slopes was found to be sig- niﬁcantly higher than zero, whereas the pooled mature and older trout was not signiﬁcantly dif- ferent from zero (table 3). discussion the degree of relatedness was signiﬁcantly higher in the 2þ cohort than in other cohorts except the 3þ cohort. however, the pooled group of 2þ and 3þ trout showed a signiﬁcantly higher relatedness than did pooled juveniles (i.e. 0þ and 1þ trout). thus, we suggest, based on the higher relatedness and the correlation between average individual regressions and age of the trout, that related mature and older ﬁsh might aggregate close to spawning grounds. moreover, based on the indi- vidual regression being above zero, it is indicated that young trout (0þ and 1þ) avoid associating with related individuals. closely related conspeciﬁcs have large parts of their genome in common and, thus, it could be expected that they should share common habitat and feed preferences (blaustein et al. 1991). how- ever, related conspeciﬁcs may also have large overlaps in resource utilisation and, hence, be more ﬁerce competitors for local resources (wald- man 1988). thus, association with related indivi- duals can decrease an individual’s inclusive ﬁtness 238 if competition is ﬁerce. however, an individual can increase its inclusive ﬁtness when competition for local resources is strong by avoid competing with related conspeciﬁcs that overlap closely in resource utilisation (hamilton & may 1977). this explanation is, however, not valid for mature and older trout, as they seem to prefer associating with relatives. sømme (1941) and later, jonsson & gravem (1985) showed that mature trout might reduce or stop their feed intake close to reproduc- tion. it is therefore possible that the mature and older trout in our study did not compete for food (as sampling was conducted close to spawning time), but instead competed for suitable hiding positions. the inclusive ﬁtness and hence kin selection should be favoured by individuals that show high tolerance towards related conspeciﬁcs. the suggestion that related mature ﬁsh aggre- gates close to spawning grounds has also ﬁnds support in a study on atlantic salmon by mjøl- nerød et al. (1999). however, the result that young trout should avoid associating with related indi- viduals contradicts conclusions from laboratory experiments. it has been shown that territory size was smaller among kin groups of juvenile atlantic salmon than among nonkin groups and juveniles of many salmonids species show kin discrimina- tion abilities during laboratory experiment (i.e. y- maze tests, reduced aggressiveness and enhanced growth, reviewed by brown & brown 1996). a possible explanation for the lack of concordance between laboratory studies and our study is the low density of ﬁsh in the fa¨ rsa˚ n stream as com- pared to the high densities in laboratory experi- ments (fontaine & dodson 1999). studies on the microgeographical spatial distribution of wild atlantic salmon have produced different results. mjølnerød et al. (1999) found, by using multilocus ﬁngerprinting, a weak but signiﬁcant association between genetic similarity and geographical dis- tance among atlantic salmon. on the other hand, fontaine & dodson (1999), by using four micro- satellite loci, studied the microgeographical struc- ture of juvenile atlantic salmon and found no evidence that territorial neighbours were related. in conclusion, we suggest that kin selection, in terms of aggressiveness and competition, prob- ably is context dependent (waldman 1988; fon- taine & dodson 1999) as differences in how trout associates with related conspeciﬁcs were found among cohorts of the fa¨ rsa˚ n stream. resumen 1. utilizamos 14 loci microsatelites para analizar el grado de relacio´ n entre y dentro de cohortes de una poblacio´ n de rio de salmo_trutta l. diferencias en el grado de relacio´ n fueron encontradas entre cohortes, con los individuos maduros y mayores en edad teniendo la mayor relacio´ n intracohorte. esta mayor relacio´ n genetica entre truchas maduras y mayores se interpreta como indicacio´ n de agrupacio´ n de las truchas maduras y mayores antes de la puesta en las cercanias de los lugares de puesta. 2. los jovenes del an˜ o mostraron un menor grado de aso- ciacio´ n con individuos de la misma cohorte que las truchas maduras y mayores. argumentamos que la agrupacio´ n de truchas maduras y mayores puede facilitar ‘kin selection’ y que un menor grado de asociacio´ n entre juveniles relacio- nados podria explicarse como resultado de rechazo a la competicio´ n territorial por parte de los juveniles frente a otros juveniles relacionados. acknowledgements the authors like to thank drs michael hansen, jan nilsson and ha˚ kan olse´ n for valuable comments. we also thank two anonymous referees for improving the manuscript. this work was funded by contributions from the european com- munity (j.c.) and by the swedish university of agricultural sciences (j.e.l.c.) and a marie curie fellowship (contract no. qlkc-ct-2000-52073, j.c.). references allendorf, f.w. & phelps, s.r. 1981. use of allelic frequencies to describe population structure. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 38: 1507–1514. blaustein, a.r., bekoff, m., byers, j.a. & daniels, t.j. 1991. kin recognition in vertebrates: what do we really know about adaptive value? animal behaviour 41: 1079–1083. blouin, m.s., parsons, m., lacaille, v. & lotz, s. 1996. use of microsatellite loci to classify individuals by relatedness. molecular ecology 5: 393–401. brown, g.e. & brown, j.a. 1993a. social dynamics in salmonid fishes: do kin make better neighbours? animal behaviour 4: 863–871. brown, g.e. & brown, j.a. 1993b. do kin always make better neighbors? the effect of territory quality. beha- vioral ecology and sociobiology 33: 225–231. brown, g.e. & brown, j.a. 1996. kin discrimination in salmonids. reviews in fish biology and fisheries 6: 201– 219. cairney, m., taggart, j.b. & høyheim, b. 2000. character- ization of microsatellite and minisatellite loci in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) and cross-species amplification in other salmonids. molecular ecology 9: 2175–2187. carlsson, j. & nilsson, j. 2000. population genetic structure of brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) within a northern boreal forest stream. hereditas 132: 173–181. elliott, j.m. 1990. mechanisms responsible for population regulation in young migratory trout, salmo_trutta. part iii. the role of territorial behaviour. journal of animal ecology 59: 803–818. estoup, a., presa, p., krieg, f., vaiman. d. & guyomard, r. 1993.
