(2009) used 5-lm polycarbonate filters to filtrate the mucus collected using a spatula. our modification was made because our method showed correspondence: a. maruyama, faculty of science and technology, ryukoku university, seta-oe, otsu, shiga 520-2194, japan. e-mail: maruyama@rins. ryukoku.ac.jp 162 doi: 10.1111/eff.12124 spectrometer smaller errors than the previous method in d13c and d15n values in preliminary experiments with two freshwater fish species (a. maruyama, unpublished data). upper lateral muscle and pectoral fins were dissected, dried at 60 °c for 48 h and ground to a fine powder. isotope analysis was performed using a delta v advantage mass (thermo fisher scientific, bremen, germany) connected to a flash ea 1112 elemental analyser (thermo fisher scientific) through a conflo iv interface (thermo fisher scientific). the isotope ratio was expressed as the per mil deviation from the standard (atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen and peedee belemnite carbon- ate for carbon). analytical errors in d15n and d13c values were  0.3&. the sample size (shown in fig. 1) became variable among tissues because some samples were lost during the isotope ratio analysis. d15n values of mucus, muscle and fin collected at each sampling were compared with the adult d15n values using dunnett’s tests. standard deviation (sd) was compared between d15n values of mucus, mus- cle and fin using analysis of variance. differences in adult d13c and d15n values between mucus, muscle and fin were tested using tukey’s simultaneous tests. statistical tests were performed using r ver. 2.13.0 software (r development core team, vienna, austria). higher d15n values of 0+-age fish reflecting prey in the lake changed to lower values reflecting prey in the river (fig. 1a). mucus d15n values of 0+-age fish were significantly higher than the adult values in august (dunnett’s test, p < 0.001; fig. 1), but not different after september (p > 0.1). muscle d15n val- quick change in the mucus d15n ues of 0+-age fish were higher than the adult values in august (p < 0.001), september (p < 0.001) and november (p = 0.028), but not different in october and december (p > 0.5). fin d15n values of 0+-age fish were different from the adult values in august and september (p < 0.001), but not different after october (p > 0.5). thus, the response of the mucus d15n value to the isotopic change was quicker than that of muscle and fin d15n values, as suggested by the hatchery experiment (church et al. 2009). in addition, the sd of mucus d15n values tended to be smaller than that of muscle d15n values (analy- sis of variance; f1,10 = 8.84, p = 0.014; table s1). the sd of mucus d15n values was <0.5& from october onwards, when upstream migration was completely terminated, in contrast to the large sds of mucus, muscle and fin d15n values in september when the time spent in the river is most variable among individuals. the small variation in mucus d15n values was considered to be derived from the quick response of these values, and this would be quite advantageous for studies that focus on the effects of factors of interest. adult d13c values were significantly different between mucus and fin (p = 0.005) and between muscle and fin (p < 0.001), but not between mucus and muscle (p = 0.312; fig. 1b). adult d15n values were significantly different between mucus and fin (p = 0.038), between muscle and fin (p < 0.001) and between mucus and muscle (p < 0.001). these results suggested that d15n fractionation in mucus is 1–2& smaller in muscle, which corre- sponded to previous studies (church et al. 2009). than that 16 (a) (b) ) ‰ ( n 5 1 δ 14 12 10 8 6 17 18 16 20 16 24 9 8 9 6 6 6 10 15 17 9 9 9 jul aug sep oct nov dec 6 –25 sampling date (2009) 28 35 31 –15 –20 δ15n (‰) 163 fig. 1.
