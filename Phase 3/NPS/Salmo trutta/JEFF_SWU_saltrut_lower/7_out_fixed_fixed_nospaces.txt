population model; mean trophic level; trend; overfishing introduction available literature indicates that the fishery in the danube river basin has been characterised over the past century by increasing fishing levels, illegal fish- ing practices and poor regulations (navodaru & starasß 1998; schiemer et al. 2004; simonovic et al. 2005; simic et al. 2013; smederevac-lalic 2013). as a result, there are indices that the diversity of the eco- nomically important fish species has changed both spatially and temporally, with the reduction in their diversity manifested especially since 1950 (simic et al. 2013). however, there is a remarkable lack of available information on the actual status of fish stocks, as well as on the trends and sustainability of fisheries in the danube, which poses a problem for the development of adequate policy and management measures. most of the assessments conducted so far were based only on small-scale surveys, analyses of limited information present in official fishery statis- tics and a ‘rule-of-thumb’ expert judgement. devel- opment of basin-level fishery and fish stock assessments was partly hindered by a large number of countries located along the danube, each with its specific fishery policies and management measures, and complex sociopolitical factors that were present during the 20th century. moreover, inadequate fish- ery statistics, sociopolitical transition in the middle and lower danube countries and economic issues also represented substantial obstacles (schiemer et al. 2004; smederevac-lalic 2013). accurate estimates of biomass of fish stocks can be best achieved through direct surveys, which com- monly require vast resources that are rarely available, correspondence: ivan jaric, kneza viseslava 1, 11000 belgrade, serbia. e-mails: ijaric@imsi.rs and ijaric@imsi.bg.ac.rs 86 doi: 10.1111/eff.12193 especially in developing countries (branch et al. 2011; stergiou & tsikliras 2011). collecting accurate information on inland fisheries can be extremely costly, and the nature of inland fisheries makes assessment of their status extremely difficult (de gra- af et al. 2014). moreover, catch statistics datasets often cover only limited time periods, or they are not continuous (barausse et al. 2011). the cheapest and most widely available source of information on the state of fish stocks are catch statistics, which will probably remain the dominant basis for fishery assessments in the future (stergiou & tsikliras 2011). time series of fishery landings can provide indica- tions of community composition changes (barausse et al. 2011). nevertheless, assessments of catch sta- tistics by standard means such as catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) have many inherent problems (cheung & pitcher 2008). moreover, there is a lack of data that would allow estimation of the historic cpue for the danube river. recent development of indices based on overall trends in life history traits of exploited fish and varia- tion in their relative contribution in the catch pro- vided means to detect changes in fish stocks with limited data available. compared to standard popula- tion parameters such as abundance or fishing mortal- ity rates, life history traits are relatively easy to obtain from the literature for most of the exploited species (cheung & pitcher 2008). one of the most widely adopted biodiversity indicators, especially for marine ecosystems, is the mean trophic level (mtl) from fishery catches (pauly et al. 1998; branch et al. 2010). it is related to the ‘fishing down the food web’ phenomenon, which represents a gradual transi- tion in landings from high-trophic-level, piscivorous fish towards low-trophic-level, planktivorous fish species. fisheries initially target larger, predatory spe- cies, and following their decline fishing moves towards smaller fish at lower trophic levels (christen- sen 1996; pauly et al. 1998). this phenomenon was shown to occur globally, for both marine and fresh- water systems (pauly et al. 2002). however, this was unsustainable fishery in danube subject of controversy among the scientific commu- nity, and a number of related phenomena were pro- posed as alternatives, such as ‘fishing through the food web’ and ‘fishing for profits’ (essington et al. 2006; branch et al. 2010; sethi et al. 2010). in ‘fish- ing through the food web’, catch of the high-trophic- level species is maintained or even increases, while the overall trophic level decreases due to serial addi- tion or increases in catch of species at lower trophic levels (essington et al. 2006). on the other hand, ‘fishing for profits’ represents the situation where fisheries prefer to target abundant, highly-priced, easy-to-catch species, before expanding to other spe- cies (sethi et al. 2010). furthermore, intrinsic vulner- ability of fish to fishing is correlated with life history traits such as body length, age at first maturity and longevity (cheung & pitcher 2008). it is well estab- lished that large, slow-growing and late-maturing species are expected to suffer greater population declines for a given mortality rate (jennings et al. 1998). as a result, continuous overfishing also pro- duces comparable increase in landings of smaller- bodied, early-maturing, short-lived species, which are also more resilient to intensive fishing (jennings et al. 1998; pauly et al. 2002; cheung et al. 2005, 2007; reynolds et al. 2005). in this study, we assessed the trends in the com- mercial fishery in the middle danube in serbia (fig. 1) during 1969–1989 and 2006–2010 by evalu- ating the temporal changes in life history-related indi- cators that might point out unsustainable fishing pressure. we also evaluated the data regarding the potential presence of the ‘fishing down the food web’ phenomenon, as well as alternative patterns of ‘fish- ing through the food web’ and ‘fishing for profits’. moreover, we present the approach of using the catch-weighted mean egg-per-recruit (epr) index as a proxy for the overall resilience of fish stocks to fishing, to evaluate the sustainability of historic fish- ing pressures. the approach and results presented here could be of interest for the scientific community and stakeholders involved in fishery management. fig. 1. map of the danube river basin, with the bars indicating borders of the middle danube section;

spasic et al. 2013). in 2005, responsibility for catch statistics col- lection was shifted from the national to the local level, by assigning the task to local fishery managers, which improved the quality of the catch data collec- tion procedures (smederevac-lalic 2013). in the same year, electronic central statistics register was established, and a more rigorous data acquisition table 1. catch (tonnes) of the commercially exploited fish species in the danube river in serbia;

hoenig 1983; jaric & gacic 2012). due to the lack of data, as well as to reduce the number of assumptions already made in unsustainable fishery in danube the model, same natural mortality values were applied for all age classes following the age 1. similarly, data on the survival of the eggs-to-age-1 age class were missing, and survival rates that produced no popula- tion growth (k = 1) were applied, which correspond to the population at equilibrium. this represents a standard approach for elasticity analysis parameterisa- tion (gross et al. 2002; velez-espino et al. 2006; doukakis et al. 2010) that avoids the need to estimate intrinsic population rate of increase, which is a param- eter that is particularly difficult to reliably approxi- mate (jennings et al. 1998; cheung et al. 2005). moreover, such approach also provides a more stan- dardised comparison among species. constructed life tables were used to estimate the epr under different fishing pressures for each species. fishing was intro- duced as a percentage of individuals removed from each of the adult age classes. epr was estimated according to boreman (1997), as a potential lifetime egg production of an age-1 female, or the sum of the number of eggs it is likely to produce at each age times the probability that she will survive to that age: epr ¼ ð   fjþmj e (1) þ xn i¼2 qiui yi 1 j¼1 where qi is the proportion of females mature at age i, φi is the average fecundity of an age-i female, fj and mj are, respectively, instantaneous rates of fish- ing and natural mortality during period j, and the n is the oldest spawning age (boreman 1997). epr was used to assess the influence of fishing, by estimating ratio of remaining epr at a particular harvest pres- sure (bruch 2008): eprratio ¼ 100  ðeprfished=eprunfishedþ (2) eprratio threshold of 20% has been proposed by goodyear (1993) as a minimum stock biomass pre- served to prevent overexploitation. in line with good- year (1993), we determined for each species the fishing pressure that produced the 20% eprratio (epr20%) and used it as a maximum sustainable fish- ing pressure. it should be noted that epr20% is also commonly denoted in fisheries science as f20% (clark 1991). all epr20% values presented further in the text are expressed as finite fishing mortality rates. data assessment we combined the catch statistics with the parameters estimated for each of the commercially exploited fish species to assess trends in the danube river fishery in serbia. the weighted arithmetic mean of a given parameter (i.e., maximum body length, maximum body weight, longevity, age at maturity, trophic level 89 jaric et al. witxi wt pn i¼1 xt ¼ and epr20%) was calculated for each of the studied years (cheung et al. 2007): (3) is the catch-weighted community mean where xt value of a given parameter x in year t, n is the num- ber of commercially exploited fish species, xi is the value of a parameter x for species i, wit is the total weight of caught specimens of species i in year t, and wt is the total weight of all fish caught in year t. resulting time series for each of the six analysed parameters were fitted with a 2-parameter exponential function to detect the presence of nonlinear trends: i tð þ ¼ ae ð ktþ (4) where i(t) denotes annual catch-weighted mean value of the assessed parameter (i.e., maximum length and weight, longevity, age at first maturity, trophic level and epr20%), and a and k stand for the initial value and extinction coefficient, respectively. all parame- ters were calculated by setting 1969 as the zero year on the temporal axis. models for each of the six assessed parameters were generated based on the catch data for the 1969– 1989 period. data for the period 2006–2010 were used as a validation of the model predictions. nonlinear fitting of the impulse-free data was per- formed using the nead-melder simplex algorithm, in matlab 6.5 (mathworks inc., natick, ma 01760- 2098 united states). quality of fitting was assessed as squared error per point. however, as the measured quantities were of different physical nature, a more convenient measure, ‘adjusted r-square’ was also applied. we extrapolated detected trends to the future for 10 years (i.e., up to the year 2020). multivariate analysis of variance (manova) was used to assess the influence of the catch of each species on the overall trends in the six assessed parameters. fishing-in-balance (fib) index and the fishing sustainability index (fsi) to evaluate the effect of potential geographic expan- sion of fishery on the catch-weighted mean value of trophic level, we used fishing-in-balance (fib) index (pauly et al. 2000), defined for any year k: i ð fib¼log yk 1=te  log y0 1=te þmtl0 þmtlk h h i ð (5) where yk and mtlk are, respectively, the catch and the mean trophic level at year k, y0 and mtl0 are the 90 catch and the mean trophic level at the initial year in a dataset, and te is the transfer efficiency between trophic levels. due to a lack of data on the actual te value in the studied area, we have set it at 0.1 as the most frequently observed value in aquatic ecosystems (pauly & christensen 1995). fib index value should be equal to zero if fishery is balanced. fib values above zero indicate either an increase in primary pro- ductivity of the ecosystem or a geographic expansion of fishery, while the values below zero indicate either geographic contraction of fishery, collapse of under- lying food webs or occurrence of discarding that is not represented in the catch (pauly & palomares 2005; kleisner & pauly 2011). we consequently calculated fishing sustainability index (fsi) that explicitly accounts for the spatial expansion, in accordance with the approach described by kleisner & pauly (2011): mtlstat ¼ mtl0   log yk=y0 (6) ð þ ctik ¼ mtlk   mtlk   mtlstat j j fsi ¼ ctik   acti ð þ=sdcti (7) (8) where ctik is the corrected trophic index (cti) in a given year k, acti is the average value of the cti, and sdcti is the standard deviation of the cti. declining fsi values indicate the actual trend of change of the mean trophic level that may be masked by geographic expansion (kleisner & pauly 2011). results estimated trends and model predictions for each of the six assessed parameters are presented in fig. 2. model predictions, while being generated based on the data for the 1969–1989 period, corresponded well to the data for the 2006–2010 period, which might indicate a validity of the resulting predictions. model parameter values and the goodness of fitting esti- mates are presented in table 2. as can be observed in the panels of fig. 2, catch- weighted community mean of maximum length, weight and age, age at maturity and the trophic level decreased over time. catch-weighted community mean of maximum length and weight decreased from 148.6 cm and 70.6 kg in 1969 to 102.1 cm and 41.8 kg in 2010, respectively, while they were pre- dicted to decline further to 93.2 cm and 36.7 kg in 2020 (fig. 2a,b). similarly, catch-weighted mean of maximum age and the age at maturity decreased from 41.1 and 4.2 years in 1969 to 26.2 and 4.0 years in unsustainable fishery in danube (a) (c) (b) (d) (e) (f) fig. 2. change in the overall maximum total length, maximum weight, maximum age, age at first maturity, trophic level and epr20% value in fish catch in the danube river in serbia during 1969–2010, estimated as a weighted value based on the contribution of exploited fish species to the total annual catch;

(2007). primary causes of the decline of the exploited fish populations, observed in the majority of transitional societies throughout the south-east europe, were unsustainable fishing and poaching, as well as a tran- sition from traditional fishing practices towards the market economy (simonovic 2010). similar transi- tional period was and still is present in serbia, with a lack of proper legislation that would regulate these activities (smederevac-lalic et al. 2012). according to simic et al. (2013), unsustainable fishery in serbia has also resulted in changes observed in the age, sex and size structure of the exploited fish populations. due to a public recognition of the negative trends in populations of species important for fishery, in 2009 and 2010 (i.e., at the end of the studied period), many of them became classified as either protected or strictly protected species by the regulations of the republic of serbia and placed under different protec- tive measures, such as permanent fishing moratoria, closed season or minimum catch size (simic et al. 2013). nevertheless, composition of landings is com- monly influenced by a complex set of factors that are difficult to differentiate and understand (hornborg et al. 2013). besides overfishing, observed negative trends in life history traits of the exploited fish spe- cies might be also partly influenced by the changes in the environment, such as construction of dams, river regulation, climate change, pollution or eutro- phication (barausse et al. 2011). such changes can produce selective pressures that impact particular spe- cies or species groups sharing similar life history. unsustainable fishery in danube fig. 3. fishing-in-balance index (fib; upper panel) and fisheries sustainability index (fsi; lower panel) in the danube river, serbia during 1969–1989 and 2006–2010 (see text for explanation). furthermore, they can be also influenced by changes in the spatial coverage of fishery and in the primary productivity of the ecosystem (pauly & palomares 2005; kleisner & pauly 2011), as well as by natural fluctuations in a population (branch et al. 2010). although it was not assessed in the current study, it is important to note that intensive fishing is able to cause fish resources selection, which could result in even more pronounced shifts in certain life history traits, such as the age at first maturity (hutchings & fraser 2008). through unintentional evolutionary exploited changes in observed trends in the assessed life history param- eters are to a certain extent influenced by an increas- ing prominence of non-native species in the fish catch (fig. 1 in appendix s1). the three non-native fish species (c. gibelio, h. molitrix and h. nobilis) became economically important for fisheries in ser- bia since 1977, and their catch increased substantially over time (smederevac-lalic et al. 2011). catch of some of the species situated at higher trophic levels remained unchanged or even increased moderately over time (s. lucioperca and s. glanis), while at the same time, their relative contribution to the total catch decreased. results of the manova indicated that trends in the mean trophic level were influenced by both species at higher trophic levels, such as s. glan- is and l. aspius, and those at lower trophic levels, such as h. molitrix/h. nobilis and a. brama. observed trends in the mean trophic level most closely correspond to the ‘fishing through the food web’ phenomenon, given that the catch of high-tro- phic-level species either remained relatively stable, such as for l. aspius, or it even increased over time, such as the catch of s. glanis and s. lucioperca, while the catch of species at lower trophic levels increased. this is also visible in fig. 2 in appendix s1, where catches of species at similar trophic levels are pooled. such trends differ from the expected ‘fishing down the food web’ patterns, where the catch is mainly characterised by a decline of high-tro- phic-level species. ‘fishing for profits’ does not seem likely either, as the catch became increasingly direc- ted at lower price species. during the assessed period, there was a constant increase in the fishing effort, primarily through 93 jaric et al. increased prominence of recreational fishery, with the fishing targeting especially the most valuable fish species, such as c. carpio, s. glanis and s. luciop- erca (smederevac-lalic et al. 2011; smederevac- lalic 2013). consequently, landings of those species should have experienced a similar increase over time as the landings of the less preferred species, such as a. brama and c. gibelio. although there are no available data that would support such hypothesis, it is therefore possible that the disproportionate increase in the catch of lower-trophic-level fish species could indicate that the fishery directed at species at higher trophic levels experienced a decrease in cpue over time, and that fishers consequently moved to exploit less desirable species. unfortunately, there is a lack of data on the historic cpue for the danube river. decline of the economically important fish species in serbia has been also reported by simic et al. (2013). as stated by barausse et al. (2011), invasion of non- native species can be facilitated if overfishing has reduced populations of native competitors. invasive species are characterised by both demographic and life history flexibility, which may give them a com- petitive edge over native species (jaric et al. 2014). at the same time, their comparably higher robustness to increased mortality allows them to capitalise more on the reduced biotic barriers and release from preda- tors (jaric et al. 2014). it is therefore possible that the documented increase both in population abun- dance and landings of lower-trophic-level species was a result of the unintended cultivation phenome- non (brown & trebilco 2014), is a trophic release of prey or competitor species when predators are overfished, or as a result of a habitat degradation that is less detrimental to generalist species. replace- ment of traditionally exploited fish species with non- native fish species has been already documented in other regions (brown & trebilco 2014). relative abundance of small and early-maturing species tends to increase in an intensively exploited multispecies fishery (jennings et al. 1998), and species with smal- ler body size and higher production may be more likely to be unintentionally cultivated because they can sustain heavy fishing pressure (brown & tre- bilco 2014). the shorter reproductive lifespans of these species may, however, lead to greater instability in population size (jennings et al. 1998). that while the catch experienced a shift towards smal- ler, early-maturing low-trophic level fish, total land- ings increased over the studied period (smederevac- lalic 2013). according to pauly et al. (1998) and pauly & palomares (2005), initial increase in total landings following overall trophic level decline is expected, primarily due to a higher biological produc- tion at lower trophic levels. an increase in the annual landings can mask actual negative trends and present 94 a false image of fishery sustainability (pauly & palo- mares 2005). ‘fishing through the food web’ phenomenon is generally considered as less detrimental than ‘fishing down the food web’. ‘fishing down’ produces a stee- per initial decline in the mean trophic level and results in a higher number of collapsed species than ‘fishing through’ (branch et al. 2010). however, both phenomena will result in large stock depletions and ultimately reach the same minimum trophic level (branch et al. 2010; foley 2013). moreover, under the ‘fishing through’ phenomenon, occurrence of a trophic cascade would be less likely, but it would result in a more comprehensive attack on trophic interactions within the ecosystem (foley 2013). ‘fishing through’ can also result in unforeseen con- flicts, because developing fisheries that demand dif- ferent ecosystem services (i.e., productive forage fish stocks instead of top predator fish stocks) and shift- ing baselines will force policy makers to make judg- ments, assign values to these alternative fisheries and consequently to develop suboptimal policy and man- agement measures, which may ultimately lead to the disparity or even incompatibility between fisheries and conservation goals (essington et al. 2006; brown & trebilco 2014). observed negative trends in fishery in the six assessed parameters are also supported by the esti- mated fib and fsi values. positive values of the fib index indicate that the fishery in the studied region either experienced a geographical expansion or a con- tinual increase in the primary productivity over the studied period (pauly & palomares 2005; kleisner & pauly 2011). although it is not intuitively expected that an inland fishery with a long history of high- intensity exploitation should experience an expansion of fishing grounds, there are indications that this may be the case in the middle danube during the studied period. this region was characterised by a continuous presence of commercial fishery along the river, with a stable number of fishing grounds over the assessed period, mainly due to the traditional character of this activity (smederevac-lalic et al. 2012; smederevac- lalic 2013). however, the number of recreational fishers greatly increased over the studied period, as well as their contribution to the total catch (smeder- evac-lalic et al. 2011). given that the recreational fishers are not limited in their activity to specific areas, as opposed to commercial fishers whose activ- ity is limited to local fishing grounds, it is likely that this may have resulted in an expansion of overall fishing grounds over time. trends in fsi over the studied period indicated that, when the spatial expan- sion is accounted for, there was a clear trend of decline in the trophic level in catch over time. with- out the expansion of fishing grounds, overall fishing pressure would have resulted in an even more pro- nounced decline of the mean catch-weighted trophic level (kleisner & pauly 2011). however, information regarding potential increases in the primary produc- tivity in the middle danube over the studied period is not clear, as well as the complex influence of the construction of dams in the iron gates area and the consequent reduction of water flow in the upstream river section (cociasu et al. 1996; perisic et al. 1996; brezeanu & cioboiu 2006; oguz & gilbert 2007; dokulil & donabaum 2014). future studies should be focused on resolving the influence of these factors on the observed trends in fish catch. despite its drawbacks, mean trophic level is con- sidered by many to be a sufficiently robust indicator of biodiversity loss (freire & pauly 2010). it was adopted as one of the 2010 biodiversity target indi- cators by the convention on biological diversity (biodiversity indicators partnership 2010). according to pauly et al. (1998), overall accuracy of the official landing statistics is not of major importance if the trends are unbiased. moreover, catch statistics will probably remain the cheapest source of annual fish- ery assessments, while estimates of fish life history traits will become increasingly available in online da- tabases (stergiou & tsikliras 2011). nevertheless, it is important to note that there are certain limitations of the use of catch data to estimate the state and trends in fish stocks (branch et al. 2011; stergiou & tsikliras 2011). as stated by cheung & pitcher (2008), potential bias in catch data is an inherent problem of the original data that cannot be avoided. catches often do not reflect actual changes in bio- mass, and the fishery collapses estimated by catch data can result from a variety of mechanisms other than an actual stock collapse, such as changes in reg- ulations, market demand or sociopolitical changes (branch et al. 2011). due to the risk of bias, espe- cially when confounding effects cannot be properly disentangled, indices such as the mean trophic level must be used and interpreted with caution (stergiou & tsikliras 2011). branch et al. (2010) argued that mean trophic level is an unreliable measure of biodi- versity loss, and this issue is still frequent subject of scientific debate (foley 2013; hornborg et al. 2013; ainley & pauly 2014). in the current study, we also applied an approach of using the catch-weighted mean egg-per-recruit (epr) index as a proxy to estimate species resilience to fishing, and consequently to use those data to assess trends in exploited fish stocks. incomplete information and a lack of data for the majority of fish species limit rapid direct assessments of the sta- tus of exploited fish species (cheung et al. 2005). as a lack of reliable mortality and life history data makes rigorous assessments of vulnerability rarely unsustainable fishery in danube possible, the alternative approach is to make a priori predictions of the susceptibility of exploited stocks using widely available data, without resorting to com- plex studies of population dynamics (jennings et al. 1998). some authors attempted to use proxies for general life history and resilience to overfishing, such as body size, growth or the age at maturity (jennings 2001; beddington & kirkwood 2005; molloy et al. 2009). cheung et al. (2005, 2007) developed a fuzzy expert system that integrates fish life history and eco- logical characteristics to estimate their intrinsic vul- nerability to fishing. the method of estimating vulnerability of fish to exploitation presented here represents a more direct assessment of the vulnerabil- ity to fishing than those that comprise scoring sys- tems of fish life history traits. the presented approach requires only a limited number of life his- tory parameters, which makes it simple and easy to apply. required input parameters include the female fecundity, age at maturity, longevity, adult and eggs- to-age-1 survival, and spawning frequency. lack of knowledge on one of the parameters can be resolved by fitting the parameter value to reach either a known population growth rate or a zero population growth, as was demonstrated in the present study. further- more, unknown parameters can be also estimated by the established relationships among different life his- tory traits, such as the age at maturity, longevity and survival (rikhter & efanov 1976; hoenig 1983; jaric & gacic 2012). it is important to note that besides 20% of the unfished spawning potential that was applied in the current study as a threshold value, there are other thresholds that were recognised and used in fisheries science to infer fishing sustainability (e.g., clark 1991, 2002). besides the 2-parameter exponential model applied in the current study to assess trends in the studied indices, we also tested the performance of a more complex, 5-parameter oscillatory model that was applied in our previous work (lenhardt et al. 2006). however, while the comparison of the two models (small sample akaike’s information criterion, see appendix s1 for more information) indicated better performance of the oscillatory model, we preferred to use the simpler one for two main reasons: firstly, it was based on fewer assumptions than the 5-parameter model, and secondly, we were unable to provide a clear rationale for the inclusion of oscillations in the former model. this study focused on a rather limited area, as it assessed only the danube fishery on the territory of serbia, and not the danube watershed. analysis of datasets on regional and local level is advisable to avoid potential bias produced by geo- graphical over-aggregation of catch data (pauly & palomares 2005; stergiou & tsikliras 2011; de graaf throughout 95 jaric et al. et al. 2014). trends can often become apparent only after data are disaggregated into smaller entities (fre- ire & pauly 2010). to conclude, results of the current study indicated the presence of negative trends in the fish catch in the danube river in serbia. fishery shifted towards smaller, shorter-lived, early-maturing species, more resilient to fishing and situated at lower trophic lev- els. obtained results indicated the importance of using such metrics for the assessments of trends in fishery. future fishery surveys should include the mean trophic level and related metrics as an integral part of fishery sustainability indicators (pauly & pal- omares 2005). in this respect, it will be necessary to direct future national and international efforts in the danube river basin on the improvement of the reli- ability and quality of catch statistics, as well as on the harmonisation of the fishery statistics among all danube countries. acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support by the project no. 173045, funded by the ministry of education, science and technological development of the republic
