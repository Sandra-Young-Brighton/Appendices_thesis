results from this study suggest that conditions experienced by female atlantic salmon during both early life and adulthood have implications for the size and number of eggs that they produce. key words: egg size; fecundity; early development; maternal inﬂuences; trade-off introduction a large body of theoretical and empirical work has examined the trade-off between producing many small or fewer larger offspring (roff 1992). studies of teleost ﬁsh have been utilised extensively in this regard and have revealed that the nature of maternal investment in offspring can vary greatly within spe- cies (green 2008). reproductive investment in ﬁshes is affected by environmental conditions experienced during adulthood (e.g., food supply, donelson et al. 2008) and also during early development. for exam- ple, female cichlid ﬁsh that experienced slow rates of growth as juveniles produced larger offspring, irrespective of growth conditions experienced after sexual maturity (taborsky 2006). here, we report relationships between the juvenile growth rate (represented by age at smolting) and adult condition of female atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and the size and number of eggs they produce. patterns of egg size and fecundity have been exten- sively studied in salmonid ﬁshes. salmon eggs are generally large compared with those of most teleost ﬁsh; both egg size and number tend to increase with female size (fleming 1998). variation in juvenile growth rate of atlantic sal- mon is also linked with reproductive investment. sal- mon spawn in freshwater rivers and streams, where juveniles live until smolting (the physiological and morphological preparation for marine life). age and size at smolting are determined principally by growth rate because fast-growing juveniles tend to smolt ear- lier and at a smaller size than slower-growing juve- niles (metcalfe & thorpe 1990; økland et al. 1993). the process of smolting and the subsequent migra- tion to sea occurs mainly in spring (although pres- molt emigrations in autumn and early winter have also been documented, youngson et al. 1983), and ﬁsh that do not smolt in a given year remain in fresh water for another year or more (metcalfe & thorpe 1990). thus, the fastest growing individuals tend to smolt before those that grow at a slower rate. females that grow relatively slowly as juveniles (i.e., smolt at older ages) produce larger eggs at maturity, correspondence: t. burton, institute of biodiversity, animal health and comparative medicine, college of medical, veterinary and life sciences, graham kerr building, university of glasgow g12 8qq, scotland, uk. e-mail: t.burton.1@research.gla.ac.uk doi: 10.1111/eff.12019 317 burton et al. even after correcting for body size (thorpe et al. 1984; jonsson et al. 1996; but see jonsson & jonsson 1999; quinn et al. 2004, 2011 for studies on other salmonids), meaning that such females face a likely reduction in offspring number for a given body size. however, egg production is also likely to be inﬂu- enced by adult body condition (donelson et al. 2008). before they return to fresh waters to spawn, salmon can vary in body condition (a strong correlate of somatic lipid content, todd et al. 2008). this is likely to translate into variation in condition at spawning (some weeks or months later) because the body lipid content of females declines en route to the spawning grounds (jonsson et al. 1997). in this study, we investigate the independent effects of age at smolting and condition at the time of spawning on reproductive investment in female atlantic salmon. materials and methods sexually mature adult salmon were captured at a ﬁsh trap on the river blackwater, ross-shire, northern scotland. using body size distributions to distinguish one-sea-winter salmon (1sw) from larger multi- sea-winter (msw) ﬁsh, we randomly selected 91 ripe females over a four-day period (30 november 2009 –3 december 2009). a sample of scales was col- lected from each ﬁsh to conﬁrm sea age, spawning history and to determine age at smolting. all ﬁsh used in the study were virgin spawners that had spent either 2 (n = 47) or 3 (n = 44) years in fresh water prior to smolting (hereafter, ‘smolt age’). fork length (lf, to 0.5 cm) and body mass (to 0.1 g) were recorded for all females prior to the stripping their eggs, which were then drained of ovarian ﬂuid and weighed (to 0.1 g; hereafter ‘clutch mass’). clutch mass was subtracted from body mass to estimate the somatic mass of each female. somatic mass was then used in subsequent analyses because it does not confound body mass with ovarian invest- ment. body condition was calculated as relative con- dition factor, krel, according to froese (2006), which measures the deviation of an individual from the average weight for a given length in a sample or pop- ulation. krel ¼ w=alb where w is somatic mass in grams (range, 978.0– 1835.9 g), l is fork length in centimetres (range, lf 50.0–63.5 cm), and a and b are the exponential form of the intercept and slope, respectively, from the log- arithmic weight–length relationship for the sample of ﬁsh (log10 w = log10 a + b log10 l). approximately 10 g of eggs from each clutch was weighed (to 0.01 g) and preserved with 5% buffered 318 formalin (a technique that does not alter the mass of individual eggs, fleming & ng 1987). eggs from these subsamples were later weighed individually (to 0.0001 g, n = 10 per clutch) to calculate the mean egg mass per female. fecundity was calculated by counting the number of eggs in each weighed sub- sample and extrapolating this value to the total clutch mass of each ﬁsh. linear model (gls) and a general to analyse maternal inﬂuences on fecundity and mean egg size, we ﬁtted a generalised least squares model (lm), respectively. both models included the following maternal traits as a ﬁxed structure: fork length, body condition, smolt age and all two-way interaction terms between each of these variables. gls analysis was chosen over general linear modelling because log transformation of fork length data did not reduce the residual variance associated with this trait. thus, the gls model included an exponential variance structure (varexp) that allowed residual variance to increase with fork length. model selection and valida- tion was performed according to protocols suggested in zuur et al. (2009, see pages 101–142). brieﬂy, likelihood ratio tests were used to sequentially com- pare the log-likelihoods (model ﬁt) of nested models (using maximum likelihood, ml). more parsimoni- ous models were retained if an increase in the log- likelihood ratio statistic was statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). final models were then re-ﬁtted with restricted maximum likelihood (reml). all statisti- cal analyses were conducted in r version 2.13.0 (r development core team 2012). the gls and lm models were implemented with the nlme (pinheiro et al. 2011) package. results fecundity varied nearly four-fold among females (fig. 1a,b). all of the main effects (but none of the interaction terms) were retained in the ﬁnal gls model that explained variation among individuals in fecundity, indicating that body size and body condi- tion had independent effects on fecundity. speciﬁ- cally, females that were large and in relatively good body condition were more fecund (table 1, fig. 1a, b). however, for females of a given body size and body condition, individuals that smolted at 3 years of age produced fewer eggs than those that smolted a year earlier (table 1, fig. 1b). egg size varied nearly two-fold among females (fig. 1c), with larger females producing the largest eggs (table 1, none of the interaction terms were retained). after controlling for body size, females that smolted at 3 years of age produced larger eggs than females that smolted a year earlier (table 1, fig. 1c). given that overall levels of reproductive investment (i.e., clutch mass) did not smolt age and adult body condition affect egg production (a) (b) (c) fig. 1. fecundity of 1sw female atlantic salmon in relation to their (a) body condition and (b) fork length. data are plotted separately for females that smolted at 2 or 3 years of age (open and ﬁlled circles, respectively). the dashed and solid lines are the predicted values from the ﬁnal generalised least squares (gls) model for females that smolted at 2 and 3 years, respectively. body condition was calculated as relative condition factor, according to the equation, krel = w/(0.0230 9 l2.724). in (a), the predicted values are adjusted to the mean female fork length (57.18 cm) and in (b) they are adjusted to the mean female body condition of 1.0. panel (c) shows the relationship between the fork length of the female and the mean mass (g) of the eggs she produced. data and predicted values from the ﬁnal lm model plotted as in (a) and (b). see text for further details of each analysis. table 1. summary of the ﬁnal generalised least squares (gls) and general linear (lm) models which respectively explain variation in fecundity and mean egg size among 1sw female salmon. each analysis initially controlled for the following maternal traits: fork length, body condition and smolt age. body condition was calculated as relative condition factor, according to the equation, krel = w/(0.0230 9 l2.724). parameter estimates are presented as treatment contrasts with female salmon that smolted at 2 years of age set as the intercept. estimate se t-value p-value fecundity intercept (smolt age 2)  4839.55 4191.91 body condition fork length 60.704  387.86 smolt age 3  24.33 2.17 15.38 intercept (smolt age 2) fork length smolt age 3 egg size 1601.52  3.02 1236.40 3.390 18.94 3.205 124.35  3.119 24.88  0.978 4.932 0.44 2.73 5.630 0.0033 <0.01 <0.01 <0.01 0.3308 <0.0001 <0.0001 (parameter female body size differ with respect to maternal smolt age, when con- trolling for esti- mate  se comparing clutch mass of females who smolted at age three vs. females who smolted at age two;

 0.006  0.002, t-value =  2.66, p < 0.01). however, this relationship became marginally non- signiﬁcant when also controlling for the smolt age of the mother in addition to her body size (parameter estimate  se for fecundity;  0.004  0.002, t-value =  1.83, p = 0.07). this suggests that the effect of smolt age absorbs some of the statistical variation associated with the negative relationship between egg size and egg number, thereby obscuring the trade-off between these two traits in the study population. discussion as in many other species of teleost ﬁshes, the number and size of eggs produced by female atlantic salmon were related positively to their body size (wootton 1998). we also found that reproductive investment by female salmon was related to their body condition and smolt age. females who were in better body con- dition, for a given body size, at spawning were likely to produce more eggs than poorer-condition individu- als. this is consistent with studies on other species of ﬁsh (lambert & dutil 2000; donelson et al. 2008). however, the relationship between body condition and fecundity does not appear to result from a trade- off between egg size and egg number because we did not ﬁnd evidence of a correlation between body con- dition and egg size, unlike previous studies (lambert & dutil 2000; donelson et al. 2008). our data also demonstrate that for a given body size, an older age at smoltiﬁcation (and likely slower rate of juvenile growth) tends to be associated with the production of fewer, larger eggs. this is congruent with previous studies on atlantic salmon (thorpe et al. 1984; jonsson et al. 1996). overall this study provides further empirical evi- dence of correlations between offspring size and/or number in salmonids that are linked to the juvenile growth opportunities of the mother (thorpe et al. 1984; jonsson et al. 1996; morita et al. 1999). due to the performance beneﬁts conferred upon juvenile salmon that hatch from large eggs, particularly in adverse environments (einum & fleming 2000a,b), it 319 burton et al. has been suggested that female salmon may respond to the potential growth opportunities of their off- spring by adjusting the size and number of their eggs according to their own early growth experience (jonsson et al. 1996). given that the adult environ- ment of atlantic salmon is vastly dissimilar to the juvenile environment, it seems intuitive that cues experienced by females during early life may be bet- ter predictors of the conditions likely to be faced by their own offspring (taborsky 2006). however, it in the current study, we must also be noted that found evidence that maternal fecundity may be mod- ulated in response to variation in body condition near spawning. this ﬁnding is consistent with evidence from atlantic herring, clupea harengus, demonstrat- ing that females undergoing nutritional stress can reduce their fecundity by resorbing individual oocytes (van damme et al. 2009; kennedy et al. 2010). in summary, we show that investment in offspring by female atlantic salmon is related to their body size, smolt age and body condition at spawning. this indicates that the environments experienced both dur- ing early life and adulthood are likely to be important for reproductive investment decisions in this species. however, the implications of variation in maternal body condition and smolt age for offspring perfor- mance and hence maternal ﬁtness are currently unknown. acknowledgements we thank l. brydon for assistance with ﬁsh husbandry and two referees for comments that improved the paper. this pro- ject was funded by a nerc small project grant to nbm, jda and sm and a fsbi small grant to tb, who was supported by a university of glasgow postgraduate scholarship and an orsas award. this experiment was authorised by licences from the uk home ofﬁce. references van damme, c.j.g., dickey-collas, m., rijnsdorp, a.g. & kjesbu, o.s. 2009. fecundity, atresia and spawning strate- gies of atlantic herring (clupea harengus). canadian jour- nal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 66: 2130–2141. donelson, j.m., mccormick, m.i. & munday, p.l. 2008. parental condition affects early life-history of a coral reef ﬁsh. journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 360: 109–116. einum, s. & fleming, i.a. 2000a. highly fecund mothers sac- to maximize ﬁtness. nature 405: riﬁce offspring survival 565–567. einum, s. & fleming, i.a. 2000b. selection against late emer- gence and small offspring in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). evolution 54: 628–639. fleming, i.a. 1998. pattern and variability in the breeding sys- tem of atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), with comparisons to 320 other salmonids. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 55: 59–76. fleming, i.a. & ng, s. 1987. evaluation of techniques for ﬁx- ing, preserving, and measuring salmon eggs. canadian jour- nal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 44: 1957–1962. froese, r. 2006. cube law, condition factor and weight-length relationships: history meta-analysis and recommendations. journal of applied ichthyology 22: 241–253. green, b.s. 2008. maternal effects in ﬁsh populations. advances in marine biology 54: 1–105. jonsson, n. & jonsson, b. 1999. trade-off between egg mass and egg number in brown_trout. journal of fish biology 55: 767–783. jonsson, n., jonsson, b. & fleming, i.a. 1996. does early growth cause a phenotypically plastic response in egg production of atlantic salmon? functional ecology 10: 89– 96. jonsson, n., jonsson, b. & hansen, l.p. 1997. changes in proximate composition and estimates of energetic costs dur- ing upstream migration and spawning in atlantic salmon salmo_salar. journal of animal ecology 66: 425–436. kennedy, j., skjaeraasen, j.e., nash, r.d.m., thorsen, a., slotte, a., hansen, t. & kjesbu, o.s. 2010. do capital breeders like atlantic herring (clupea harengus) exhibit sen- sitive periods of nutritional control on ovary development and fecundity regulation? canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 67: 16–27. lambert, y. & dutil, j.d. 2000. energetic consequences of reproduction in atlantic cod (gadus morhua) in relation to spawning level of somatic energy reserves. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 57: 815–825. metcalfe, n.b. & thorpe, j.e. 1990. determinants of geo- graphical variation in the age of seaward-migrating salmon, salmo_salar. journal of animal ecology 59: 135–145. morita, k., yamamoto, s., takashima, y., matsuishi, t., kanno, y. & nishimura, k. 1999. effect of maternal growth history on egg number and size in wild white-spotted char (salvelinus_leucomaenis). canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 56: 1585–1589. økland, f., jonsson, b., jensen, a.j. & hansen, l.p. 1993. is there a threshold size regulating seaward migration of brown_trout and atlantic salmon? journal of fish biology 42: 541– 550. pinheiro, j., bates, d., debroy, s. & sarkar, d. & the r development core team. 2011. nlme: linear and nonlinear mixed effect models. r package version 3.1 - 101. quinn, t.p., vøllestad, l.a., peterson, j. & galucci, v. 2004. inﬂuences of freshwater and marine growth on the egg size - egg number tradeoff in coho and chinook salmon. trans- actions of the american fisheries society 133: 55–65. quinn, t.p., seamons, t.r., vøllestad, l.a. & duffy, e. 2011. effects of growth and reproductive history on the egg size - fecundity trade-off in steelhead. transactions of the american fisheries society 140: 45–51. r development core team 2012. r: a language and environ- ment for statistical computing. r 2.13.0. vienna, austria: r foundation for statistical computing, isbn 3-900051-07-0, url: http://www.r-project.org/. roff, d.a. 1992. the evolution of life histories;
