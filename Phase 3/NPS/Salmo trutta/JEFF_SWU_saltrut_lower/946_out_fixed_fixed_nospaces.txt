hocutt et al. 1994b; hay et al. 1996; tvedten 2002). floodplain rivers, like the zambezi and okavango rivers, experience an annual sequences of low water during the dry period, followed by rising and high water during and after the rainy periods. flooding inundates large grassland and forest areas. many ﬁsh species have adapted to this cycle by spawning at the beginning of the ﬂood, thereby placing their juveniles in the more productive areas of the ﬂoodplain (williams 1971; van der waal 1996; hoggarth et al. 1999). management of a sustainable ﬁshery may depend on a better understanding of ﬁsh migrations and habitat preferences in these complex ﬂoodplain ecosystems. the tigerﬁsh hydrocynus vittatus castelnau, 1861 is one of the most important predatory ﬁshes in african freshwaters (jackson 1961; lewis 1974; winemiller & kelso-winemiller 1994). although widespread in africa and still abundant, tigerﬁsh have declined in many rivers because of pollution, water extraction and migration barriers, such as weirs and dams (skelton 1993; steyn et al. 1996). the objective of the study doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00080.x 79 økland et al. was to analyse the movements and habitat utilisation of tigerﬁsh in the zambezi river (namibia) during the low, rainy season and high-water period. to this aim we radiotagged and tracked individual tigerﬁsh during a 6-month period. study area, material and methods study area is the fourth largest riverine the zambezi river drainage in africa, both in length (2660 km) and catchment area (1æ45 million km2). the river arises in north-western zambia, passes through angola, then back into zambia, before it forms the north-eastern border between zambia and caprivi in namibia from katima mulilo to impalila island, a distance of approximately 120 km (fig. 1). annual variation in water level attains 7–8 m in caprivi (van der waal & skelton 1984). the water level usually rises sharply in january, with one or more peaks during february to april, and declines during may to june. thus, the ﬂoodplains are inundated from february to june (van der waal & skelton 1984). in the study area, the river consists of a wide channel, with bends and deep pools. small, vegetated islands, sandbanks, bays, backwaters and narrow side channels occur frequently. water velocity varies from stagnant to fast ﬂowing. rapids occur at katima mulilo and impalila. there are also larger, slow- ﬂowing channels and isolated pools. in the main stem, sandy bottom dominates. muddy bottom is common in isolated pools, bays, backwaters and on ﬂoodplains where siltation occurs. side channels and smaller side streams usually have sandy bottom. the water is transparent with low amounts of suspended particles during the period of low waters. the river has overhanging cover in the form of overhanging margi- nal terrestrial vegetation and aquatic vegetation. marginal terrestrial vegetation can be described as fringing vegetation on riverbanks in the form of terrestrial grass, reeds, overhanging trees and shrubs. vegetation can be dense in places, making the riverbank impenetrable. in other areas, grass and terrestrial reeds grow on sandy riverbanks and substi- tute the dominant dense vegetation of trees and shrubs, which grow on more stable grounds. inundated grassland is the dominant ﬂoodplain vegetation. fig. 1. the upper part of zambezi river in caprivi in north-eastern namibia. sites where individual tigerﬁsh were radiotagged and released are indicated. individual ﬁsh numbers correspond to the numbers in table 1. shaded areas indicate ﬂoodplain during high waters. the dotted lines indicate national borders. where not shown, the border between zambia and namibia and between zambia and zimbabwe follows the middle of zambezi river. solid lines indicate main roads. 80 fish capture and tagging twenty-three tigerﬁsh were captured by hook and line (n ¼ 13) and seine netting (n ¼ 10) in the main stem of zambezi river, 229–611 km downstream from katima mulilo in caprivi (namibia) between 6 november and 24 december 2000 (fig. 1; table 1). the ﬁsh were immersed in an anaesthetic solution (5 mg metomidate per litre water, mariniltm; wild- inc., fort collins, co, usa). radio life labs., transmitters (advanced telemetry systems, inc., isanti, mn, usa; table 1) were externally attached to the ﬁsh, using the method described in thorstad et al. (2001). during the tagging procedure, which lasted about 2 min, the ﬁsh were kept in a water- ﬁlled tube. transmitter weight in water was 7–8 g, or <2æ2% of the body weight of the smallest ﬁsh. total body length was recorded, before the ﬁsh were placed in a container for recovery (2–5 min). the ﬁsh were released at the capture site, except one ﬁsh (no. 16) released 600 m downstream because of drift of the boat. the water temperatures were 25æ4–29æ6 °c during capture and tagging. that was fish tracking fish were tracked during daytime from a boat by using a portable receiver (r2100, ats) connected to a movements and habitat utilisation by tigerﬁsh 4-element yagi antenna. the ﬁsh were located with a precision of minimum ±10 m in the main river. some of the backwaters were inaccessible by boat, and the location had to be estimated based on the direction and signal strength. the ﬁsh were tracked on average every 4æ1 day during 23 november to 18 may, and individual ﬁsh were tracked up to 46 times (table 1). the ﬁsh were tracked intensively during a period of low water (23 november to 27 december), rising water (28 december to 11 march) and high water (12 march to 8 may) (fig. 2; table 1). surface water temperature at ﬁsh positions varied between 20æ7 and 30æ1 °c. habitat classiﬁcation habitat classiﬁcations were made each time a ﬁsh was positioned. we recorded the following: water cover (1: permanent water cover, 2: temporary water cover, i.e., areas ﬂooded each year during the rain period), main habitat type (1: main stem, 2: backwater, 3: mouth of backwater, 4: side channel, 5: tributary, 6: permanent swamp, 7: temporary swamp 8: ﬂood- plain), position relative to vegetation (1: no vegetation, 2: near vegetation, i.e., 1–5 m from vegetation, 3: at vegetation i.e. 0–1 m from vegetation), and vegetation type if near or at vegetation (1: aquatic submerged, 2: aquatic ﬂoating, 3: aquatic anchored, 4: marginal table 1. radiotagged tigerﬁsh in the zambezi river (namibia) during 6–24 december 2000. release site is given as distance from catch site. fish no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 tagging date 06 november 2000 06 november 2000 06 november 2000 06 november 2000 06 november 2000 06 november 2000 08 november 2000 10 november 2000 10 november 2000 10 november 2000 10 november 2000 10 november 2000 14 november 2000 14 november 2000 14 november 2000 15 november 2000 17 november 2000 22 november 2000 22 november 2000 16 december 2000 20 december 2000 24 december 2000 24 december 2000 body length (cm) transmitter model* total number of ﬁxes 37 37 49 40 38 37 37 39 39 39 43 49 37 30 32 39 40 32 54 49 42 38 35 f2040 f2120 f2120 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2120 f2040 f2040 f2120 f2120 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2120 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2040 f2040 2 35 32 21 0 24 2 16 18 22 37 46 0 0 0 1 44 18 23 9 6 12 24 number of ﬁxes during each period (low, rising, high water) 2, 0, 0 12, 17, 6 11, 17, 4 11, 10, 0 0, 0, 0 11, 13, 0 2, 0, 0 0, 4, 12 12, 6, 0 12, 10, 0 7, 13, 15 12, 18, 14 0, 0, 0 0, 0, 0 0, 0, 0 1, 0, 0 11, 17, 14 10, 8, 0 10, 13, 0 2, 7, 0 2, 4, 0 0, 11, 1 0, 15, 9 last tracking date 30 november 2000 31 march 2001 26 march 2001 03 february 2001 07 november 2000 20 february 2001 30 november 2000 08 may 2001 21 january 2001 28 january 2001 18 may 2001 18 may 2001 15 november 2000 23 november 2000 14 november 2000 21 november 2000 18 may 2001 22 january 2001 20 february 2001 20 february 2001 08 january 2001 02 april 2001 14 april 2001 recaptured · · · · · · *model f2120 are ﬂat transmitters with outline dimensions of 19 · 50 · 9 mm, weight in air of 15 g and weight in water of 7 g. model f2040 are cylindrical transmitters with diameter of 12 mm, length of 46 mm, weight in air of 10 g and weight in water of 8 g. 81 økland et al. fig. 2. the water levels in zambezi river from 1 august 2000 to 31 august 2001 (dates on x-axis are given as date and month). the study periods at low, rising and high water are indicated. aquatic submerged, 5: marginal aquatic ﬂoating, 6: marginal aquatic anchored, 7: marginal terrestrial submerged, 8: marginal terrestrial overhanging). moreover, we recorded surface water temperature, depth (measured by an echo sounder or manually with a rope and weight, vertical position of the ﬁsh was unknown), and substrate (1: mud, 2: clay, 3: sand, 4: gravel, 5: pebble, 6: rock, 7: bedrock). the distance to the nearest shore and the total width of the river was measured. a laser range ﬁnder (bushnell bu yardage 800; bushnell corporation, kansas city, ks, usa) was used to record distances to shore and river width. data analyses eight tagged individuals were never encountered within the study area (table 1) and were therefore not included in the analyses. descriptive statistics for the entire study period were based on 15 ﬁsh (see table 1). descriptive statistics for each of the periods low, rising and high water were based on ﬁsh with more than ﬁve ﬁxes (i.e., positions recorded during tracking) during a given time period, which resulted in a sample size of 11 ﬁsh during low water, 14 ﬁsh during rising water and six ﬁsh during high water (see table 1). behaviour traits and habitat utilisation between the periods were analysed through nonpara- metric paired comparisons. as a result of the low number of individuals tracked across all three periods, statistical comparisons were made between low and rising water through wilcoxon signed ranks tests, including 11 ﬁsh with more than ﬁve ﬁxes during both periods (see table 1). descriptive statistics and statistical analyses were based on average values for individual ﬁsh. to ensure that we did not include movements because of handling and tagging effects, data from the ﬁrst week after tagging were excluded from analysis. 82 home ranges were estimated using the nonpara- metric kernel method and a probability density function (worton 1989; seaman & powell 1996; lawson & rodgers 1997). for the kernel smoothing parameter h, the ad hoc solution was rejected in favour of the least-square cross-validation approach, which is more effective with multimodal distributions (worton 1989). when h was larger than 100, h was set to 100 to avoid inclusion of too much area within the home range. the utilisation distribution was estimated, in terms of perimeter and area covered, at two different levels of probability (95 and 50%). home ranges were not analysed when the number of ﬁxes was lower than 10 (table 1). the capture and release sites were excluded from analyses. home ranges were estimated using arcview gis 3.2 (environmental systems research institute, inc., redlands, ca, usa). results movements mean total distance moved by individual tigerﬁsh during the study was 26,492 m (sd ¼ 25,468, indi- vidual means ranged from 547 to 105,988 m). aver- age distance moved between tracking surveys was 1447 m (sd ¼ 2,289, individual means from 17 to 7210 m), and was larger during low than during rising (z ¼ )2æ85, p ¼ 0æ004). average distance water moved was not dependent on ﬁsh length (r2 ¼ 0æ05, p ¼ 0æ42). distance moved between tracking surveys was longer than 1000 m in only 7% of the instances. two movement patterns typify individual ﬁshes: (i) exclusive movements shorter than 1000 m between tracking surveys (53% of the ﬁsh), or (ii) residency for periods, with long distance movements to new areas between residency periods (47% of the ﬁsh) (fig. 3). there was no difference in body length between individuals associated with the sets of different movement patterns (mann–whitney u-test, u ¼ 18, p ¼ 0æ28). the movements longer than 1000 m were on average 18,784 m, and 42% were downstream and 58% upstream. there seemed to be no seasonality in the long-distance movements, as 25% occurred in december, 30% in january, 8% in february, 35% in march and 2% in april. the fastest movement )1 recorded was 39,740 m in 6 days, i.e. 6623 m day (ﬁsh no. 12). the individual released 600 downstream from the capture site was recorded at the catch site <10 min after release, and was caught by an angler 3 h later. during low water, tigerﬁsh were only recorded in permanently water-covered areas. during rising and high water, all (100%) and 83% of the ﬁsh, respect- ively, partly or fully used permanently water-covered movements and habitat utilisation by tigerﬁsh fig. 3. kernel home ranges of individual radio tagged tigerﬁsh (n ¼ 14) in zambezi river over the entire study period during the years 2000 and 2001. red dots show ﬁxes during tracking, and the contours of home ranges refer to two different levels of pro- bability (kernel 95 and 50%). landscape contours refer to permanent and temporary water covered areas. individual ﬁsh num- bers correspond to numbers in table 1. note that scales differ widely among individual ﬁsh because of their different movement patterns (see results). areas. however, 21% of the individuals also moved to temporary ﬂooded areas during rising water and 67% during high water, although they did not undertake long-distance migrations into the ﬂoodplains. (note that percentages add up to more than hundred because some individuals were recorded in more than one habitat within a period.) individuals utilising tempor- ary ﬂooded areas were larger than those staying only in permanently water covered areas during rising water (mean length 49 cm vs. 40 cm, mann–whitney test, u ¼ 3æ0, p ¼ 0æ038). home ranges home ranges varied among individuals (fig. 3), with a 50% probability of localisation within an average area of 26,464 m2 (sd ¼ 34,464, range 171–115,564 m2) and 95% probability of localisation within an average area of 276,978 m2 (sd ¼ 398,218, range 1041– 1,191,836 m2) (based on average 27 ﬁxes per ﬁsh, range 13–46 ﬁxes). neither the 95% nor the 50% probability home range differed between low and rising water (wilcoxon test, n ¼ 10, 95%: z ¼ )0æ56, p ¼ 0æ58, 50%: z ¼ )0æ26, p ¼ 0æ80). furthermore, home range size was not dependent on ﬁsh length (95%: r2 ¼ 0æ12, p ¼ 0æ22, 50%: r2 ¼ 0æ17, p ¼ 0æ15). mean length of the river stretch utilised by individuals was 18,836 m (sd ¼ 24,568, range ¼ 90–71,840) and was not dependent on body length (r2 ¼ 0æ19, p ¼ 0æ19). habitat utilisation all tigerﬁsh were recorded in the main stem of the river during radiotracking. however, 40% of the ﬁsh were recorded in one or more additional habitats; 27% of the individuals were recorded in side channels, 7% in permanent swamps, 20% in backwaters, 7% in the mouth of backwaters and 7% into the ﬂoodplain (see also table 2). there was no difference in body length 83 økland et al. between individuals recorded in the main stem of the river only and those recorded in other habitats (mann– whitney u-test, u ¼ 19æ5, p ¼ 0æ39). river width (including the wetted ﬂoodplain) where the ﬁsh were positioned varied between 35 m and 2000 m (average 529 m; 277 m during low, 320 m during rising and 1,382 m during high water). mean distance from the ﬁsh position to the nearest shore was 107 m (69 m during low, 68 m during rising and 356 m during high water, maximum range 1–1000 m), and did not differ between low and rising water (wilcoxon test, z ¼ )0æ45, p ¼ 0æ66). all the ﬁsh (100%) were recorded away from vegetation (>5 m) in one or more instances, 60% were recorded near vegetation (1–5 m), and 47% were recorded at vegetation (0–1 m) (see also table 2). associations with vegetation did not differ between low and rising water (wilcoxon tests, z from )1æ60 to )1æ36, p from 0æ11 to 0æ17). there was no difference in body length between individuals recorded near and at vegetation and those not recorded at vegetation (mann–whitney u-test, u ¼ 22æ5, p ¼ 0æ61). of the ﬁsh recorded near or at vegetation (n ¼ 9), all of them (100%) were associated with marginal aquatic anchored vegetation at least once, 22% were associated with marginal aquatic ﬂoating vegetation, 11% with marginal terrestrial overhanging vegetation, 11% with aquatic anchored vegetation and 11% with marginal terrestrial submerged vegetation. there were no differences among vegetation types with which ﬁsh were associated with between low and rising water (wilcoxon tests, all z ¼ 0æ0, all p ¼ 1æ0). mean water depth where the ﬁsh were recor- ded varied between 0æ5 and 14æ0 m, and averaged 3æ8 m. water depths did not differ between low and (wilcoxon test, z ¼ )1æ50, rising-water periods p ¼ 0æ14), and was not dependent on ﬁsh length (r2 ¼ 0æ004, p ¼ 0æ81). fish were mainly associated with sandy bottom;

bell-cross 1974; skelton 1993; winemiller & kelso-winemiller 1994). however, the present study also showed that tigerﬁsh used other habitats such as side channels, backwaters and ﬂoodplains, especially during rising and high water level. although often recorded in the main stem, tigerﬁsh stayed near shore rather than the middle of the river as they were recorded on average 107 m from the nearest shore, which constituted 22% of the total width of the river. tigerﬁsh were often associated with vegetation (average 42% of ﬁxes), but were never recorded inside or under vegetation. when recorded near (1–5 m) or at (0–1 m) vegetation, they seemed to prefer the shade from vegetation (r. thompson, personal communica- tion). bell-cross (1966), balon (1971) and baras et al. (2002) observed adult tigerﬁsh near the shore and in shallow waters, especially in the evening and night. plausibly, the pursuit method of attacking ﬁsh prey in tigerﬁsh is poorly suited for lentic habitats containing abundant aquatic vegetation, in contrast to the ambush habit of african pike hepsetus odoe (bloch, 1794), which is more suited in densely vegetated habitats (jackson 1961; winemiller & kelso-winemiller 1994). it is likely that tigerﬁsh habitat preferences and movements observed during this study were largely determined by prey availability in different habitats combined with a higher foraging efﬁciency in open water habitats than in vegetated habitats. tigerﬁsh were typically recorded over sandy sub- strates, and only occasionally over clay, muddy bottom or rocks. the association of tigerﬁsh with sandy substrates may not be a preference, but simply a result of the widespread occurrence of sandy bottom in the study area (van der waal & skelton 1984). floodplains during the rainy season affect the local conditions inhabited by tigerﬁsh. tigerﬁsh used ﬂooded areas more frequently during rising and high water periods, although only one ﬁsh moved far into the ﬂoodplain. individuals recorded from ﬂooded areas were larger than those remaining in the permanent waters. average distances moved between tracking surveys were shorter during rising than during low water period. it is not known whether these differences were linked to changes in factors such as prey availability or spawning. minimum size of sexual maturation for tigerﬁsh was 26 cm for males and 15 cm for females in our study area. fifty percent of males were mature at 26 cm length and 50% of the females at 28 cm length (c.j. hay, t.f. næsje, movements and habitat utilisation by tigerﬁsh s. kapirika, j. koekemoer, r. strand, e.b. thorstand & k. ha˚rsaker, unpublished data). thus, most ﬁsh in the present study had probably reached sexual maturity, and it is likely that spawning occurred before or at the onset of the study period, because ripe males observed in this area of the zambezi river in late october and early november (c. hay, personal observation). methods few telemetry studies have been conducted in tropical rivers (hocutt et al. 1994a), and even fewer in large rivers such as the zambezi river. this study and thorstad et al. (2001, 2004) showed that telemetry is a suitable method to assess behavioural traits related to movements and habitat utilisation by ﬁsh in these environments. anaesthetisation and tagging proce- dures seemed to be acceptable, as all tigerﬁsh were alive as long as they were tracked, and no transmitter- loss was recorded. eight ﬁsh were not detected after tagging, and several ﬁsh were lost as the study proceeded. six of them were recaptured by local ﬁshermen, indicating a minimum loss to ﬁsheries of 26%. whether the missing individuals either moved out of the study area, were recaptured without being reported or the transmitter failed could not be assessed. however, most of these ﬁsh were lost during the high-water period near the end of the study, and it is likely that the transmitter ran out of battery power. moreover, some ﬁsh could have been captured by ﬁshermen without being reported. resumen 1. desde el 6 de noviembre hasta el 24 de diciembre del an˜o 2000, 23

localizados en el canal central y, de promedio, el 95% de los ﬁjos estuvieron en el canal central durante el perı´odo de aguas bajas. sin embargo, los peces utilizaron temporalmente las a´reas de inundacio´ n cuanto ma´s al aumentar el nivel del 85 økland et al. agua durante los perı´odos de aguas ascendentes y aguas altas pero no desarrollaron migraciones a larga distancia hacia las zonas de inundacio´ n. los peces se encontraron algunas veces cerca de la vegetacio´n pero no fueron nunca observados dentro o bajo la vegetacio´ n. acknowledgements the study was ﬁnanced by world wildlife fund (wwf), usaid, namibian ministry of fisheries and marine resources (mfmr) and the norwegian institute for nature research (nina). we thank nicolene and rolly thompson for extensive help during catch, tagging and tracking of the ﬁsh. we also thank kari sivertsen and knut kringstad for help with design of ﬁgures. references balon, e.k. 1971. age and growth of hydrocynus vittatus castelnau,
