the structure of ﬁsh assemblages were evaluated from 159 sites in two regions of the great plains with limited anthropogenic disturbance. these regions offered an opportunity to evaluate the structure and variation of streams and ﬁsh assemblages within the great plains. we used canonical correspondence analyses to determine the inﬂuence of environmental conditions on species abundances, species occurrences and assemblage characteristics. analysis of regions separately indicated that similar environmental factors structured streams and ﬁsh assemblages, despite differences in environmental conditions and species composition between regions. variance in ﬁsh abundance and assemblage characteristics from both regions was best explained by metrics of stream size and associated metrics (width, depth, conductivity and instream cover). our results provide a framework and reference for conditions and assemblage structure in north american prairie streams. j. r. fischer1, c. p. paukert2

e-mail: ﬁscher@iastate.edu accepted for publication april 10, 2008 introduction understanding of ﬁsh-habitat relationships is essential to management and conservation of stream ﬁshes (kessler & thorp 1993; wildhaber et al. 2000). however, stream ﬁsh assemblages are structured by habitat at various spatial scales. at local scales, instream physical habitat can inﬂuence community structure and function (gorman & karr 1978; schlos- ser 1982; angermeier & karr 1984; quist & guy 2001), while inﬂuences at broader scales (e.g., geology and climate) can be important determinants of species distributions (matthews & robison 1988; marsh- matthews & matthews 2000). because ﬁsh assem- blages are strongly inﬂuenced by physical habitat, they have long been used to quantify the effects of disturbance on the environment (karr 1981). distur- bance to physical habitat (e.g., riparian vegetation alteration, impoundments; gorman & karr 1978; jones et al. 1999; marchetti & moyle 2000; quist et al. 2003), and water quality (e.g., pollution, sedi- mentation; tsai 1973; rabeni & smale 1995; bonner & wilde 2002) have resulted in ﬁsh assemblage shifts, decreased native species diversity, community homog- enisation, range reduction and extinction. disturbances to stream ecosystems can be assessed by sampling ﬁsh assemblages (karr 1981). fish assemblage structures such as guilds (e.g., feeding, reproduction, behavioural, etc.) can be used determine habitat degradation associated with nonpoint source pollution (moyle 1994). furthermore, the effects of disturbances can be long lasting and possibly perma- nent despite reduction in the intensity of disturbance (harding et al. 1998). in the great plains, only after anthropogenic inﬂuence occurred were most accounts of the ﬁshes recorded, leaving presettlement condi- tions poorly documented (matthews 1988; fausch & bestgen 1997). despite the difﬁculty in quantifying baseline conditions (because of the limited number of unmodiﬁed systems and a long history of disturbance) determining areas of least impact (i.e., reference) is important to designating areas in need of conservation (hughes et al. 1986; harris & silveira 1999), quan- tifying intensity of disturbance (mebane 2001), and determining natural variation in ﬁsh communities (karr et al. 1986; schlosser 1990; smogor & doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00311.x 597 fischer & paukert angermeier 2001). additionally, these systems are important to assessing restoration efforts (hughes et al. 1986) and validating metrics of ﬁsh communities (index of biotic integrity, smogor & angermeier 2001). the great plains are one of the most endangered terrestrial ecosystems in the north america, with 98% of the area of native terrestrial vegetation replaced (samson & knopf 1994). prairie stream ﬁsh are at risk because of alterations to land and water use, primarily driven by agricultural practices, but also physical modiﬁcation (e.g., impoundment for ﬂood control and irrigation, channelisation, and riparian vegetation alteration), pollution, siltation and the introduction of nonnative species (cross & moss 1987; pﬂieger & grace 1987; matthews 1988; dodds et al. 2004; gido et al. 2004). however, the intensity of anthropogenic disturbances is not evenly distributed across the great plains. eastern regions have experienced greater changes to native terrestrial vegetation (e.g., indiana, illinois and iowa have had 99.9% declines in native tallgrass prairie) (samson & knopf 1994), while northern and western regions tend to have less anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., more native range- land, less urbanisation and lower human density) (bramblett et al. 2005) and may be useful as reference. it is therefore important to understand how stream systems with minimal environmental disturbance structure ﬁsh assemblages within regions. our objective was to determine the relationship of ﬁsh community structure in response to environmental variation in two geographically separate regions of the great plains with limited disturbance by: (i) evaluating the structure of stream sites by environmental variables within regions, (ii) determining the environ- mental variables responsible for structuring ﬁsh com- munities for each region and (iii) determining if similar environmental features are related to commu- nity structure across a large scale of minimally disturbed areas. because these regions are relatively unimpacted (see below), we hypothesised local envi- ronmental variables that are not directly related to anthropogenic disturbance will be most important to structuring ﬁsh assemblages. we predict that habitat variables of greatest importance will be similar between regions because of relatively homogenous and similar land use of each region. study area the south-western tablelands located within south central kansas (hereafter referred to as red hills) and the sand hills (located primarily in north central nebraska) environmental protection agency (epa) level iii ecoregions (omernik 1987) are relatively unimpacted regions with low human population density and rangeland as the dominant land use 598 (chapman et al. 2001). the prevalence of rangeland within these regions retains a landcover more similar to the native vegetation (i.e., mixed grass prairie) of both regions when compared with more pervasive land uses (e.g., rowcrop agriculture) elsewhere on the great plains. landcover within the sand hills is 88.8% grassland with only 3.6% rowcrop agriculture, while 50.9% of the red hills is grassland and 42.3% is rowcrop agriculture. however, the sand hills are relatively homogeneous, while the red hills can be divided into two distinct areas, the flat tablelands and cimarron breaks. within the flat tablelands, crop production is greater than that in the cimmaron breaks (chapman et al. 2001), which is where our study occurred. the cimarron breaks region has 77.5% grassland with 16.8% rowcrop agriculture. addition- ally, the number of impoundments in both regions is relatively low. only four impoundments of the 163 documented impoundments (i.e., impoundments with dam heights ‡7.6 m or storage capacity ‡61,675 m3) within nebraska occur within in the sand hills, while only ﬁve of the 211 documented kansas impound- ments occur within the red hills (united states army corps of engineers 2005). streams within the sand hills and red hills are similar, with predominantly sand substrates and tributary streams that are spring fed (chapman et al. 2001). however, prairie streams in the northern great plains (i.e., sand hills) typically have more stable hydrologic regimes than those of southern great plains (oklahoma and kansas) (mat- thews 1988). this is in part because of water levels of high plains aquifer. within the sand hills declines in aquifer levels are much less than in the red hills, which has experienced signiﬁcant declines in the aquifer water (sophocleous 2000; mcguire 2004). level materials and methods data collection fish were sampled with a backpack or tote barge pulsed dc electroﬁsher in a single upstream pass at all 159 sites during the summer (i.e., may to august) of 1996–2005 in two great plains regions (fig. 1). sites were sampled as part of statewide inventories of wadable stream ﬁshes and were sampled only once during the study time frame. electroﬁshing was supplemented by seining when sites did not contain excessive instream vegetation, boulders or woody debris. sampling length was calculated to be 40 times the mean stream width, with a minimum length of 150 m and a maximum length of 300 m (lazorchak et al. 1998). prior to sampling, block nets were set where ﬂows permitted at the upstream and down- stream ends to prevent ﬁsh movement out of the site. sand hills w n s e red hills nebraska kansas 0 150 300 450 km fig. 1. locations of 67 nebraska sand hills and 92 kansas red hills sites (triangles) sampled from 1996 to 2005. inset represents entire great plains region (omernik 1987). easily identiﬁed specimens were counted and released in the ﬁeld and unidentiﬁable or numerous specimens were preserved in 10% formalin. preserved specimens were identiﬁed and counted in the laboratory. physical and chemical habitat variables were measured at all sites with a modiﬁcation of the u.s. epa protocol for sampling wadable streams (lazor- chak et al. 1998). the only variation to epa protocol was the reduction of 11 evenly spaced transects to six for all sand hills and 12% of red hills sites. six to 11 evenly spaced transects for each sampling length were used to survey physical habitat at each site. mean depth was measured at three equally spaced intervals for each transect and the mean of all transects was calculated for each site. wetted width was measured at 10 equally spaced intervals between transects and the mean of all measurements was calculated. canopy cover was measured by using a spherical densiometer at six locations at each transect and the per cent cover for each transect was averaged for each site (lazor- chak et al. 1998). substrate was measured at ﬁve equally spaced intervals at each transect. substrate classes included ﬁne (<0.06 mm), sand (0.06–2 mm), gravel ﬁne (2–16 mm), gravel coarse (16–64 mm) and cobble (64–250 mm). the total percentage of each substrate class was calculated for each site. instream cover (ﬁlamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes, woody debris, overhanging vegetation and undercut banks) was estimated using a rank (0–4) of ﬁve cover classes; absent (0%), sparse (0–10%), moderate (10–40%), dense (40–75%) and very dense (>75%) (lazorchak et al. 1998). mean rank was then averaged across all transects to obtain a value for all instream cover categories for each site. riparian human inﬂuence (i.e., rowcrop agriculture, rangeland and rip–rap) was visually estimated at each transect on each bank. habitat relationships with ﬁsh assemblages categorised into four observations were ranks (i.e., 0–3): absent, on bank (adjacent to water), within 10 m, >10 m. the mean of ranks was averaged across all transects for each site. prior to ﬁsh sampling and physical habitat mea- surements, in situ water chemistry was measured at the )1), downstream transect. dissolved oxygen (mgæl )1), water temperature (°c) and conductivity (lsæcm turbidity (nephlometric turbidity units or ntus) were measured using a handheld metre. twenty evenly spaced measurements across the transect were taken at 60% depth with a marsh mcbirney flo-mate 2000 or gurky pygmy ﬂow metre (troy, new york, usa) to calculate total stream discharge. statistical analyses principal component analyses (pca) were performed using sas 9.1.3 (sas institute 2006) on the 22 environmental variables to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify patterns of structuring within the red hills and sand hills (johnson 1998). all variables were log10 (x + 1) transformed before anal- ysis to better meet the assumptions of normality. only principal components with eigenvalues >2 were inter- preted from pca on the correlation matrix of the environmental variables as suggested by ferre (1995). variable loadings >|0.25| were considered important in structuring streams within each region (chatﬁeld & collins 1980). the association between regions of within region environmental variable correlation was tested using a mantel test (mccune & grace 2002). product moment correlation matrices of all environ- mental variables were conducted for each region separately and the mantel test was calculated with 10,000 randomised runs using pc-ord (ver. 5.0, mccune & grace 2002). a multiple analysis of variance (manova) was conducted using sas 9.1.3 (sas institute. 2006) to compare environmental variables between regions. if the manova was signif- icant then individual one-way anovas were used to identify the variables that differed between regions (johnson 1998). of ﬁsh species abundance fish assemblage data were summarised into two data sets for each region to quantify patterns in relationships between the red hills and sand hills. relative (individu- als ⁄ 100 m) and ﬁsh assemblage characteristics (com- prised of 13 metrics) were calculated for all sites. previous studies have demonstrated the utility of ﬁsh assemblage characteristics for assessment of distur- bance (karr 1981; fausch et al. 1984; smogor & angermeier 2001). the assemblage metrics computed for each site were: total ﬁsh abundance (total individ- uals ⁄ 100 m), species richness, native cyprinid rich- ness, native centrachid richness, native benthic 599 fischer & paukert invertivore richness, proportion of top carnivores, invertivores, omnivores, intolerant, tolerant, simple introduced individuals lithophils, and shannon’s diversity index. metrics included in the assemblage characteristics data set were adapted from similar metrics from regions similar to this study (bramblett & fausch 1991; lydy et al. 2000; bazata 2005). fish species that did not occur at >5% of sites within each region, and sites with a total abundance of <5 individuals per 100 m sampled were removed from all analyses. because ﬁsh community structure may differ between regions, a manova was conducted to compare ﬁsh assemblage characteristics between regions. if the manova was signiﬁcant then individual one-way anovas were used to identify which metrics differed between regions (johnson 1998). canonical correspondence analysis (cca) was used to identify the relationships of environmental variables with ﬁsh assemblage (abundance and assemblage characteristics) data sets for the red hills and sand hills separately. a stepwise forward selection and monte carlo permutation test (1000 random permu- tations) were used to determine environmental vari- ables that signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) explained variation in ﬁsh assemblage data sets. partial ccas were used to determine the variance explained by individual variables after the removal of variables with inﬂation factors >10 (ter braak & smilauer 2002). the inﬂuence of environmental variables on ﬁsh assem- blages in both regions were evaluated with combined ccas for abundance and assemblage characteristics data sets using region as a covariable. all ccas were calculated using canoco 4.5 (ter braak & smilauer 2002). results the pca of red hills sites produced three axes that cumulatively explained 45.5% of the environmental variation in sites (table 1). the ﬁrst axis had high loadings for instream cover (ﬁlamentous algae, mac- rophytes and overhanging vegetation), stream size (mean width and discharge), turbidity and substrate composition (per cent ﬁne and sand). the second axis had high loadings for instream cover of large woody debris, undercut banks, canopy cover and conductiv- ity. the third axes had high loadings for per cent cover of small woody debris, gravel substrate composition (ﬁne and coarse) and adjacent rangeland land use. the pca of sand hills sites produced three axes that explained 41.7% of the environmental variation and had high loadings for all three axes were similar to those of the red hills pca. the ﬁrst axis included high loadings for instream cover (macrophytes and table 1. principal component (pc) loadings from principal component analysis

cover, stream size (mean width and discharge) and adjacent rangeland land use. the second axis produced high loadings for dissolved oxygen and substrate composition (sand and coarse gravel). the third axis had high loadings for mean depth and presence of rip–rap. nine variables (per cent macrophyte cover, large ⁄ small woody debris, canopy cover, mean width, discharge, per cent sand substrate, per cent coarse gravel substrate and adjacent rangeland land use) of 22 total environmental variables had high loadings on at least one of the principal component axes interpreted for both the red hills and sand hills. the primary gradients included stream size (mean width, mean depth and discharge) and instream cover (e.g., mac- rophytes, woody debris, etc.) for both regions. in contrast, water temperature, per cent cobble substrate and adjacent rowcrop agriculture did not have high loadings on any of the ﬁrst three axes for either region (table 1). correlations of environmental variables within regions were associated between the sand hills and red hills (mantel test r = 0.496, p = 0.0001) sug- gesting similar environmental variables structured sites separately within the sand hills and red hills regions. however, environmental variables differed between lambda = 0.079; d.f. = 22,136; p < 0.0001). thus, despite differences in measured environmental variables similar correla- tions among variables existed between regions. (wilk’s regions a total of 61 ﬁsh species was collected from 92 red hills and 67 sand hills sites. within the red hills 32 species were collected, while 47 species were collected from the sand hills (table 2). eighteen species were common between the two regions, of which nine species occurred at >10% of sites in each region. however, 14 species were unique to the red hills and 29 species were unique to the sand hills. many of the region-speciﬁc species were widespread and abundant in their region (table 2). five species that were ubiquitous (>50% of sites) in the red hills cragini included arkansas (a kansas state threatened species; haslouer et al. 2005), green sunﬁsh, lepomis cyanellus, plains killi- ﬁsh, fundulus zebrinus, sand shiner, notropis stramin- eus, central stoneroller, campostoma anomalum and red shiner, cyprinella lutrensis. species that occurred at >50% of the sites in the sand hills included white sucker, catostomus commersonii, creek chub, semo- tilus atromaculatus, longnose dace, rhinichthys cata- ractae, sciadicus (a nebraska tier i at risk species; schneider et al. 2005), bigmouth shiner, notropis dorsalis, fathead minnow, pimephales promelas and sand shiner. topminnow, fundulus darter, etheostoma plains a total of 39,722 ﬁsh was collected from red hills sites and 41,253 ﬁsh from sand hills sites. total catch habitat relationships with ﬁsh assemblages (wilk’s for sites ranged from 12 to 3215 individuals for the red hills and 15 to 6139 for sand hills sites (table 3). fish assemblage characteristics varied between regions lambda = 0.317; d.f. = 13,145; p < 0.0001). the number of native cyprinids, number of benthic invertivores, proportion of tolerant individuals, proportion of lithophilic individuals and shannon’s diversity was higher in the sand hills sites, while the number of native centrachid species and proportion of intolerant individuals was higher in the red hills (table 3). all other assemblage characteristics (total ﬁsh abundance, species richness, proportion of top carnivores, proportion of inverti- vores, proportion of omnivores and the proportion of introduced individuals) did not differ between regions. overall, the mean proportion of individuals of intro- duced species was low (i.e., <5%) in both regions, but the range varied substantially (table 3). sites fish abundance the forward selection procedure retained eight of the 19 environmental variables (p < 0.05) in the cca of red hills sites and ﬁsh abundance data (table 4). axis 1 (33.4% of total variance) represented a gradient of substrate and stream depths, which separated species with associations towards increased mean depth and ﬁne substrate (western mosquitoﬁsh, gambusia afﬁnis, fathead minnow, gizzard shad, dorosoma cepedianum and common carp, cyprinus carpio) from other species (fig. 2). axis 2 (25.3% of total variance) represented a gradient of stream size (mean width and conductivity) and instream cover (ﬁlamentous algae and undercut banks). this axis contrasted species associated with narrower streams having greater instream cover (e.g., arkansas darter, central stone- roller and green sunﬁsh) from species (e.g., plains minnow, emerald shiner, notropis atherinoides, sand shiner) associated with wider streams and less in- stream cover (fig. 2). nearly 40% of the red hills ﬁsh abundance variance was explained by per cent ﬁne (13.0%) and sand substrates (10.1%), mean width (8.5%) and conductivity (7.5%), which was far greater than the cumulative variance explained by the ﬁve remaining forwarded selected variables (14.1%) (table 4). nine variables signiﬁcantly explained variation of sand hills ﬁsh abundance data (table 4). axis 1 (30.9% of total variation) represented a gradient of conductivity, instream cover (i.e., macrophytes) and mean stream depth (fig. 2). deeper streams with higher macrophyte coverage and lower conductivity were associated with orangethroat darter, creek chub, brook stickleback and plains topminnow. shallower streams with higher conductivity and less instream cover contained sites with increased abundance of 601 fischer & paukert table 2. summary of species occurrences from 67

native centrachid richness and proportion of tolerant individuals was higher in deeper and presumably more stable streams compared with that of shallower streams. of the eight variables selected,

the proportion of intolerant, simple lithophilic and invertivore indi- viduals was associated with narrower streams with environmental eight variables 604 lower conductivity and discharges. the proportion of top carnivores and introduced individuals was associ- ated with the presence of rip–rap and cobble substrate. rip–rap (10.6%) and cobble (8.0%) substrate ex- plained the greatest amount of variance of the sand hills assemblage characteristics (table 4). the prox- imity of top carnivore and introduced individuals indicated that introduced species (i.e., northern pike, esox lucius and largemouth bass) were predominately the top carnivores within the sand hills (table 2). overall, the red hills and sand hills sites exhibited patterns of assemblage environmental associations along gradients of stream size, instream cover, and substrate with similar variables and total variation explained (table 4). mean width was included in all four ccas and explained 4.6–9.8% of the variance

geographically separate regions of the great plains, despite large differences in habitat and ﬁsh communities. for example, mean conductivity was eight times higher in the red hills compared with the sand hills, but still inﬂuenced ﬁsh assemblages in both regions. our results indicated that patterns of assemblage structure were inﬂuenced by similar environmental factors that structured assem- blage characteristics concurrently. variation in assem- blages in both regions was explained best by stream size (i.e., depth, width and discharge) and metrics linked to stream size (e.g., smaller streams had increased percentage of instream cover; larger streams had greater conductivity, etc.). taylor et al. (1993) reported conductivity and stream width to be the most important variables in structuring sites and ﬁsh assemblages within streams in the red river drainage of oklahoma, which had a similar ﬁsh assemblage to the red hills (12 of 17 ﬁsh species from the red river shared). our study also indicated conductivity was strongly associated with ﬁsh assemblage structure, but in regions north and west of the taylor et al. (1993) 606 study, suggesting that conductivity may be important in structuring ﬁsh assemblages at local spatial scales across a broad region. although the mean values for 15 of the 22 environmental variables used in our study differed between the red hills and sand hills, often up to threefold or higher differences, ﬁsh communities were structured by similar environmental variables. disparity in environmental conditions between regions suggested regional geology was important to the variables of our study, but sites within regions structured similarly to environmental variables despite these differences. (poff & allan 1995). however, in addition to environmental conditions, ﬁsh com- munities differed between the red hills and sand hills, but the total ﬁsh abundance and species richness at sites between regions did not differ. great plains streams have relatively low species diversity compared with warmwater streams of other regions (pﬂieger 1997) as a result of the widely ﬂuctuating environ- mental conditions that characterise prairie streams. therefore, great plains ﬁshes are adapted to harsh conditions and are often trophic and substratum generalists the proportion of omnivores in both of our study regions did not differ and was relatively low (x< 20%) compared with prairie reaches of the purgatorie river (x= 35–65%) of the arkansas river basin in colorado (bramblett & fausch 1991). prairie stream ﬁsh assemblages are often tolerant as an adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions, such as ﬂow regime (bramblett et al. 2005). however, we found the proportion of tolerant individuals greater in the more hydrologically stable sand hills streams, whereas the proportion of intolerant individuals was greater in the red hills. results from our assemblage characteristic analysis suggested differing ﬁsh assem- blages were structured by similar environmental variables (e.g., proportion of intolerant individuals in both regions was associated with narrower streams) in two separate regions of the great plains. of the environmental variables structuring assem- blages in our study, stream size was the most important factor, which is consistent with schlosser (1987). however, stream habitat and ﬁsh assemblages throughout the great plains are not uniform (matthews 1988), which may inﬂuence how ﬁsh assemblages at small spatial scales respond to environmental varia- tion. we found that substrate composition and instream cover were also important in structuring ﬁsh assemblages in both regions, but likely were indirectly associated with stream size. large streams of the region are typically broad, shallow, and often braided with sandy substrates, and have increased dissolved solids (matthews 1988). large streams often have low habitat diversity (bramblett & fausch 1991), which is in contrast to the schlosser’s (1987) conceptual model of increased habitat heterogeneity with increased stream size. for example, in narrower streams canopy cover was often higher, thereby increasing per cent cover of woody debris relative to that of larger streams. prairie streams of the great plains are unique systems that support unique ﬁshes. our samples included several species of regional conservation concern in high abundance in both regions. many of these species were strongly associated with the environmental factors of our study. for example, the presence and abundance of the arkansas darter (kansas state threatened; haslouer et al. 2005), which was collected at >60% of the sites in the red hills, was strongly associated with narrower streams con- taining greater instream cover and lower conductivity. the plains topminnow is an endemic species to the great plains whose conservation status is listed as vulnerable, critically imperiled or extinct in seven of the nine states where it once occurred (natureserve 2008). our study collected the plains topminnow at >60% of sand hills sites sampled and our analysis indicated the species was strongly associated with small streams containing high per cent macrophyte cover. the presence of rare and, sometimes, intolerant species and the low mean proportion of introduced individuals initial assumption that these streams are minimally disturbed or healthy systems (bramblett & fausch 1991; lydy et al. 2000; shearer & berry 2002; bramblett et al. 2005). in both regions supports our the local environmental conditions of streams are linked to the landscape at multiple spatial scales. our results indicate that local factors were important in structuring ﬁsh assemblages in two regions of the great plains, but we did not directly test landscape or large-scale factors in this study. large-scale terrestrial and geographic features are important to structuring assemblages (roth et al. 1996; marsh-matthews & matthews 2000; gido et al. 2006). however, ﬁsh assemblages have been found to be more inﬂuenced by local factors in largely undisturbed catchments (wang et al. 2006) or highly disturbed regions (stauffer et al. 2000; heitke et al. 2006). the strong local environmental inﬂuence of ﬁsh assemblage structure may be the result of the largely homogenous and minimally disturbed landscapes of the sand hills and red hills regions. conservation of stream ﬁshes is dependent on understanding inﬂuences at multiple scales, and refer- ence conditions are essential to assessing restoration efforts (roni et al. 2005). although our collections were from regions with minimal anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., low proportion of rowcrop agricul- ture, low number of impoundments and low human population density), we observed a range of assem- habitat relationships with ﬁsh assemblages blage characteristics that indicated varying levels of disturbance. for example, although the mean propor- tion of introduced individuals was <5%, collections in both regions yielded as high as 60% introduced individuals at certain sites. furthermore, introduced species of the great plains are often sport ﬁsh species (gido et al. 2004) that are likely top predators (e.g., largemouth bass, northern pike, etc.). this range in assemblage characteristics emphasises the widespread degradation of great plains streams, even in areas of relatively low terrestrial disturbance, and further addresses the need for conservation and management of prairie stream ﬁsh and their habitat. despite the range in assemblage characteristics, our results provide a framework of the how local habitat factors structure differing stream ﬁsh assemblages in two minimally disturbed great plains regions. although few undis- turbed regions may currently exist in the great plains, our study provides a comprehensive survey of condi- tions in areas of low anthropogenic disturbance and demonstrates the current variability in ﬁsh communi- ties and environmental conditions of these two regions. the consistency of our results across a large region suggests the importance of local inﬂuences on communities and can be used by managers to assess conditions of streams in other great plains regions. acknowledgements we thank all of personnel involved with the
