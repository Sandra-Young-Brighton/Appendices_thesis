(fenderson 1964; bodaly 1979; sva¨rdson 1979; bergstrand 1982; mcphail 1984; malmquist et al. 1992; mcphail 1993; sku´ lason & smith 1995). separate lineages of ﬁsh species show similarity in divergence to ecomorphs: pelagic (limnetic) morph uses pelagic zooplankton and benthic morph con- sumes larger food items, such as benthic macroinver- tebrates (schluter & mcphail 1993; robinson & wilson 1994). in postglacial lakes polymorphic whiteﬁsh have been documented in large and complex lakes, where habitat and food resources are diverse (lindstro¨m & nilsson 1962; bergstrand 1982; sandlund et al. 1995). different whiteﬁsh forms (or morphs) share available habitat and food resources of the lakes, showing trophic 50 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00075.x specialization towards pelagic or epibenthic niches (bergstrand 1982; amundsen 1988; kahilainen & lehtonen 2002a; lehtonen & kahilainen 2002; amundsen et al. 2004). because of distinct resource partitioning of polymorphic populations, ontogenetic habitat and diet shifts of whiteﬁsh forms with increasing size and age might be more limited than in monomorphic populations (hessen et al. 1986; tolonen 1998; kahilainen et al. 2003). thus, in polymorphic whiteﬁsh lakes, habitat-speciﬁc food resources may govern the level of form-speciﬁc diet- overlap and have a direct effect on somatic growth. usually, the planktivorous pelagic forms are small- sized and slow growing in various ﬁsh lineages (schluter & mcphail 1993; robinson & wilson 1994). however, reasons for small-size and slow growth of the pelagic form have rarely been linked to the available food resources in the pelagial and to the possible effect of intercohort diet-overlap on growth. the aim of this study was to explore reasons for the small size of the pelagic densely rakered (dr) whiteﬁsh form in subarctic lake muddusja¨rvi by examining availability of pelagic zooplankton, food composition and diet-overlap between age groups of dr whiteﬁsh during the growing season (june to september). dr whiteﬁsh is the most numerous whiteﬁsh form in this lake and consisted of small- sized individuals (kahilainen & lehtonen 2003; kahilainen et al. 2004). altogether three whiteﬁsh forms segregate available food and habitat resources in lake muddusja¨rvi: two sparsely rakered whiteﬁsh forms use benthic food resources in littoral and profundal habitats, whereas dr whiteﬁsh uses mostly pelagic habitat and food resources (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002a; lehtonen & kahilainen 2002; kahilainen et al. 2003, 2004). resource partitioning between whiteﬁsh forms is well deﬁned and diet- overlap between them rather low (lehtonen & kahilainen 2002). materials and methods study area the paatsjoki drainage area. total lake muddusja¨rvi is situated in northern finland (69°n, 27°e). muddusja¨rvi is one of the headwater lakes of lake surface area is 48 km2 of which the area (where depth is >6 m) covers 54%. the rivers kaamasjoki and terstojoki discharge their waters into the lake. these rivers are rich in humic substances, making the water brownish. aquatic vegetation in oligo- trophic lake muddusja¨rvi is scanty. icefree period in 1998 began in early june and lasted until early october. planktivory and diet-overlap of whiteﬁsh the natural ﬁsh fauna of lake muddusja¨rvi consists of 10 species: whiteﬁsh, arctic charr, brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.), grayling (thymallus_thymallus (l.)), perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.), pike (esox lucius l.), burbot (lota lota (l.)), minnow (phoxinus phoxinus (l.)), three-spined stickleback and nine-spined stickle- back (pungitius pungitius (l.)). whiteﬁsh is the most numerous species in lake muddusja¨rvi, dividing into three forms according to gillraker distribution (kahil- ainen & lehtonen 2002a). two forms are sparsely rakered and one form is densely rakered. dr whiteﬁsh is the most numerous form dwelling in both pelagic and epibenthic zones, whereas two sparsely rakered forms dwell only in epibenthic areas (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002a,b; kahilainen et al. 2004). large sparsely rakered (lsr) whiteﬁsh uses littoral habitats and small sparsely rakered (ssr) whiteﬁsh profundal habitats (kahilainen et al. 2003). whiteﬁsh whiteﬁsh sampling was performed in the vicinity of zooplankton stations during june to september 1998. whiteﬁsh were caught with a set of eight gill nets. each net was 1.8-m high and 30-m long (mesh sizes 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45 and 60 mm). nets were set in the evening at around 8.00 pm and collected in the morning at around 8.00 am. only epibenthic netting was performed during 1998. at this time, no obser- vations were available concerning the changes of pelagic distribution of dr whiteﬁsh. in june, dr whiteﬁsh can be caught efﬁciently with epibenthic nets, because of the absence of diel migrations (kahilainen et al. 2004). towards autumn (august– september) dr whiteﬁsh perform distinct vertical migrations, ascending from epibenthic habitats to midwater and surface at night (kahilainen et al. 2004). during dawn, dr whiteﬁsh descend to the bottom and can be efﬁciently caught with epibenthic nets. thus, the epibenthic gillnetting strategy used in this study was suggested to be a sufﬁcient for dr whiteﬁsh stomach sampling. whiteﬁsh were immediately chilled in ice after sampling. whiteﬁsh catch was ﬁeld identiﬁed according to appearance and morphometry of gill- rakers. ssr whiteﬁsh can be easily distinguished from other forms by appearance (brownish colour, large eyes and large reddish pectoral and pelvic ﬁns). lsr and dr whiteﬁsh have normal whiteﬁsh coloration with silvery sides and dark ﬁns and back. gillrakers of ssr whiteﬁsh are short and extremely widely spaced. gillraker tip of ssr whiteﬁsh can be bent. lsr whiteﬁsh have widely spaced and short gillrakers, whereas dr whiteﬁsh have closely spaced and long gillrakers. dr whiteﬁsh gillrakers are ﬂexible, whereas lsr and ssr whiteﬁsh gillrakers 51 kahilainen et al. are rather unbending. a subsample of dr whiteﬁsh catch was frozen for stomach content and gillraker analyses. total length and weight of whiteﬁsh was measured at an accuracy of 1 mm and 0.1 g. the number of gillrakers was counted from the ﬁrst brancial gillarch under a preparation microscope. the stomach was removed and food categories were identiﬁed to order or family level. for zooplankton, the following main taxa were found: bosmina spp., daphnia spp., cycl- opoida and calanoida. in addition, a few stomach contained alonella spp. and eurycercus spp. wet weight method was used for stomach analyses (windell & bowen 1978), in which different food categories were separately weighted and presented as a proportion of total stomach content. zooplankton body length (for daphnia spp. eye length ¼ length from centre of eye to the root of tail spine) in each whiteﬁsh stomach was measured from 30 randomly selected and undeteriorated individuals under the preparation microscope (magniﬁcation 36·), if possible. diet-overlap between dr whiteﬁsh age groups was calculated with schoener (1970) index: x  a ¼ 1   0:5 n i¼1 !  pxi   pyi ð1þ where pxi is the proportion of food item i used by dr whiteﬁsh age group x and pyi is the proportion of food item i used by dr whiteﬁsh age group y, and n is the number of prey categories. a value of zero indicates no overlap, and a value of 1.0 suggests complete overlap. diet-overlap value 0.60 or higher was con- sidered biologically signiﬁcant (wallace 1981). both otoliths (sagitta) and a suitable number of scales behind the ventral ﬁns were taken for age determination. one otolith was burned and cracked through the nucleus. both otoliths (burnt and unburnt) and scales were used for age determination to improve the reliability. otoliths are the most suitable for whiteﬁsh age determination (skurdal et al. 1985). this was observed also in age determination of slow growing dr whiteﬁsh. the average length-at-age of dr whiteﬁsh was calculated at beginning and in the end of growing season, i.e., during june and septem- ber. the average length-at-age in june and september of age groups 2–10 was ﬁrst log-transformed and then tested with t-test. results were considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. for sexual maturity measurements mature and immature specimens were separated. this separation was made only for august and september samples to ensure that possible maturation had been clearly started. age and length at sexual maturity was determined when >50% of age/length group was mature. sexes were analysed separately. 52 zooplankton zooplankton was sampled fortnightly during june to september 1998. two sampling stations were used in the pelagic area at the total depths of 15 and 20 m. zooplankton was collected with a tube sampler (volume 6.79 l, length 1 m). the sample was imme- diately sieved through the plankton net (bar mesh size 25 lm) and stored in 5% formalin solution. as a result of similarity in zooplankton densities at both stations during the study months and continuous ﬁshing data, zooplankton data was pooled. zooplankton densities were presented as number of individuals per litre in the whole water column. the average water column temperatures (°c) were measured simultaneously with zooplankton sampling. stored zooplankton samples were counted under together a light microscope in the laboratory. all and 13 cladoceran species were six copepoda identiﬁed. bosminids (bosmina coregoni obtusirostris, longirostris) and daphnids b. c. longispina, b. longiremis) were the most (daphnia cristata, d. abundant cladoceran species. in addition, a few specimens of following cladocerans were found during the summer 1998: ceriodaphnia quadrangula, diap- hanosoma brachyurum, holopedium gibberum, leptodora kindtii, polyphemus pediculus, alonella nana, alonella rostrata and camptocercus rectirostris. identiﬁed calanoids and cyclopoids were eudiaptomus gracilis, eudiaptomus graciloides, heterocope appen- diculata, heterocope borealis, limnocalanus macru- rus and cyclops scutifer. total number of individuals per sample was measured and presented as number of individuals per litre. nauplii larvae of copepods were excluded from zooplankton density estimates, because of low importance in adult whiteﬁsh diet. zooplankton body length (for daphnia spp. eye length) was measured from ﬁrst 30 specimens. rep- resentative length distributions during june to sep- tember were obtained from four pooled taxa: bosmina spp., daphnia spp., cyclopoida and calanoida. zooplankton lengths from the lake samples and dr whiteﬁsh stomachs were log (x + 1) transformed, and then each zooplankton taxon was separately tested with anova. pairwise comparisons were made with tukey’s hsd tests. results were considered signiﬁ- cant if p < 0.05. their results zooplankton density and dr whiteﬁsh diet density of zooplankton increased in parallel with rising water temperatures during summer 1998 (fig. 1). in june, the average water temperature was low (c. 5 °c) and the total zooplankton density was <4 planktivory and diet-overlap of whiteﬁsh june–september (fig. 3). in the anova model for zooplankton length, signiﬁcant differences were found between stomach and zooplankton samples (table 1). the average length of zooplankton in the dr whiteﬁsh stomach was higher than in the zooplankton sample in all months and every taxa (tukey’s hsd tests, p < 0.05), except calanoida in june (p ¼ ns). the average zooplankton length differences between the zooplankton sample and the dr whiteﬁsh stomach were the lowest with small-sized cladoceran species; bosmina spp. and daphnia spp., but differences were more pronounced with cyclopoida and calanoida (fig. 3). diet and diet-overlap between dr whiteﬁsh age groups food selection of different dr whiteﬁsh age groups was very uniform during most of the summer, the diet was composed mostly of zooplankton, and no onto- genetic food shift with increasing age was detected (fig. 4). in addition, high diet-overlap values between age groups indicated the same (table 2). in 72% of the studied cases, diet-overlap index values were equal or higher than 0.60. especially high diet-overlap values were observed in june and september when the availability of zooplankton and other potential pelagic food (insect pupae and adults) was low (table 2). diet-overlap values were lowest in august, when the proportion of insect pupae and adults in the diet of dr whiteﬁsh was high (fig. 4; table 2). length-at-age and sexual maturity of dr whiteﬁsh length increment of dr whiteﬁsh was slow during the open water season (fig. 5). the length range of studied dr whiteﬁsh samples was 9.3–19.1 cm, including age groups 1–10. growth of dr whiteﬁsh stagnated at 4–5 years of age and from the length 13–14 cm onwards (fig. 5). the length-at-age differ- ences between june and september were signiﬁcant for ages 2–4 (t-tests, p < 0.05). the length-at-age in june and september for other age groups did not differ (t-tests, p ¼ ns). both males and females matured (>50% of samples were mature) at 3 years of age and at length of 12 cm. only minor somatic growth was observed after sexual maturity (fig. 5). the total discussion fig. 1. zooplankton density and water column temperature in lake muddusja¨rvi during june to september in 1998.

highest. the cyclopoids were still the dominant taxon, but also the proportion of bosminids and calanoids was increased. in august, the total zooplankton density resembled the situation in july and also the highest water column temperature (c. 12 °c) was observed. bosminids, daphnids and calanoids reached the highest density in august, whereas cyclopoids decreased (fig. 1). in september, zooplankton density decreased in concert with water temperature. cladoc- erans dominated in september, whereas the proportion of copepods decreased. the density of larvae and pupae) food items (insect food selection of dr whiteﬁsh followed the observed zooplankton succession (fig. 2). only a minor proportion of the dr whiteﬁsh diet consisted of other than zooplankton (fig. 2). the proportion of copepods in the diet of dr whiteﬁsh was high in early summer, decreasing towards autumn as in the zooplankton samples (fig. 2). the importance of bosminids increased towards autumn in the diet of dr whiteﬁsh, being highest in september. despite the increased proportion of daphnids in the water column towards autumn, they were rarely consumed. gillrakers and zooplankton length the average number and median of dr whiteﬁsh gillrakers was 35.1 and 35 (range 30–41). bosmina spp., daphnia spp., cyclopoida and calanoida were abundant zooplankton taxa in the water column and were used in the average length calculations during lakes, and usually at polymorphic whiteﬁsh populations are documented in several postglacial least one pelagic and one benthic whiteﬁsh form inhabits these lakes (lindstro¨m & nilsson 1962; sva¨rdson 1979; bergstrand 1982; amundsen 1988; bøhn & amund- sen 1998; amundsen et al. 2004). this is a common pattern also in other polymorphic ﬁsh species, such as 53 kahilainen et

planktivore/insectivore, ssr whiteﬁsh is a profundal benthivore and lsr whiteﬁsh is a littoral benthivore (kahilainen et al. 2003, 2004). correlation between the feeding morphology and for- aging environment is evident in the average number of gillrakers, which are 16.8, 22.9 and 35.1 for ssr, lsr and dr whiteﬁsh (kahilainen et al. 2003; this study). zooplankton succession is strongly inﬂuenced by water temperature especially in the northern lakes as the zooplankton biomass peak is coincident with maximum water temperatures (selin & hakkari 1982; primicerio & klemetsen 1999). selin & hakkari (1982) studied pelagic zooplankton during june to september in lake inarija¨rvi, which is situated below three-spined stickleback and arctic charr, suggesting similar availability of niches in various postglacial lakes (mcphail 1984, 1993; malmquist et al. 1992; sku´ lason et al. 1999). the benthic forms of these species have fewer number of short gillrakers and are more robust in body shape, whereas pelagic forms have slender body shape and numerous, densely spaced and long gillrakers (mcphail 1993; snorrason et al. 1994), observed also for the whiteﬁsh forms in lake muddusja¨rvi (k. kahilainen and k. østbye, unpublished data). pelagic forms usually consume zooplankton, whereas benthic forms consume larger such as benthic macroinvertebrates food items, in lake (larson 1976; malmquist et al. 1992). muddusja¨rvi, are resources habitat and food 54 table 1. anova table for the effects of month (june to september), sampler (dr whiteﬁsh or zooplankton sample) and their

lower paatsjoki watercourse below lake inarija¨rvi, zooplankton biomass was highest in august (bøhn & amundsen 2001). summer 1998 was cold and zooplankton density was high only during a short period in lake muddusja¨rvi. high density of crusta- cean zooplankton was observed in july (12.0 individ- )1) in concert uals (ind.) l with high water temperatures. the zooplankton suc- cession period was short and maximum density was low in lake muddusja¨rvi compared with the southern lakes in finland (hakkari 1978; kankaala et al. 1990; ja¨rvinen et al. 1995). )1) and august (11.9 ind. l planktivory and diet-overlap of whiteﬁsh the intensity of zooplankton predation by dr whiteﬁsh followed the changes of prey density. copepods were frequently consumed in june and july, when their availability was high. towards the autumn, importance of bosminids in the diet of dr whiteﬁsh increased in concert with the increasing density in the lake. interestingly daphnids were seldom consumed, despite the high density in the lake during september. this might be a consequence of the rather small size and high transparency of daphnids and the less transparent appearance of bosminids. in addition, the circular shape of bosminids may be efﬁciently detected by chasing ﬁsh (eggers 1977). high proportion of bosminids in the diet of dr whiteﬁsh may also be inﬂuenced by their slow swimming speed compared with copepods, which are able to escape suction of planktivorous ﬁsh (drenner et al. 1978). dominance of bosminids in the diet is most plausibly inﬂuenced also by the feeding tactic of dr whiteﬁsh. in aquarium, dr whiteﬁsh searches zooplankton swimming slowly and attacks are made only at short distances (k. kahila- inen, personal observation). this feeding tactic is energetically proﬁtable as the energy content of zooplankton is low (cummins & wuycheck 1971) and individual prey size is small. furthermore, slow approach may be a prerequisite for successful feeding because, at least copepods, perceive predators by sensing their movements, which are directly propor- tional the approaching predator (viitasalo et al. 1998). to the speed of planktivorous ﬁshes are size-selective predators, preferring large-sized zooplankton over smaller ones (brooks & dodson 1965). planktivorous ﬁshes can be fig. 4. food composition of densely ra- kered whiteﬁsh age groups from june to september 1998.

ﬁlter feeders (lazzaro 1987). whiteﬁshes are particulate feeders, which visually detect, locate and attack a single individual of zooplankton (lazzaro 1987; langeland & nøst 1995). size selection is pronounced in particulate feeding ﬁsh (lazzaro 1987), and this was observed also in lake muddusja¨rvi, where the average size of zooplankton in dr whiteﬁsh stomach was larger than in zooplankton sample. selection was most pro- nounced for prey with a large size range, such as cyclopoids and calanoids. however, the difference between copepod length in zooplankton sample and dr whiteﬁsh stomach is partly induced by sampling gear (tube sampler), which may not collect large-sized specimens of especially fast swimming calanoida (drenner et al. 1978). the extremely slow growing planktivorous dr whiteﬁsh samples consisted of age groups 1–10. majority of the dr whiteﬁsh population consists of small-sized individuals using similar food and habitat 56 fig. 5. the average length-at-age of densely

ontogenetic food shifts were not observed as all age groups fed mainly on pelagic zooplankton. this is in contrast with monomorphic whiteﬁsh populations, where ontogenetic food and habitat shift may reduce niche overlap between age groups (hessen et al. 1986; sandlund et al. 1992). in lake muddusja¨rvi, whiteﬁsh population consist of three forms sharing available benthic and pelagic habitats. similar to dr whiteﬁsh, ontogenetic habitat shifts were not observed for two benthic whiteﬁsh forms; ssr and lsr whiteﬁsh (kahilainen et al. 2003). this suggests that possibilities for ontogenetic habitat shift are limited among sympatric whiteﬁsh, at least in lake muddusja¨rvi. diet-overlap between the age groups of dr white- ﬁsh was pronounced during the study period suggest- ing resource competition. furthermore, all age groups fed on rather similar-sized zooplankton. food compe- tition between the age groups of dr whiteﬁsh is likely because the population density of dr whiteﬁsh in the )1 and almost all (95%) pelagic zone is c. 750 ind.æha consisted of small-sized (<15 cm) ﬁsh (kahilainen et al. 2004). this suggests that dr whiteﬁsh predation pressure on relatively scarce zooplankton resources of lake muddusja¨rvi is high. interaction between high population density of dr and pronounced diet-overlap between age groups most plausibly reduced the growth of dr whiteﬁsh. furthermore, the risk of predation has inﬂuence the ability of dr whiteﬁsh to use pelagic zooplankton. brown_trout is the most numerous piscivore in the pelagial, consuming dr whiteﬁsh as main prey and presumably induces vertical migrations of dr whiteﬁsh (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002b; kahilainen et al. 2004). during the daytime, dr whiteﬁsh dwells in the vicinity of the bottom, where the light level is low, reducing the feeding efﬁciency of whiteﬁsh (mayr 2002). dr whiteﬁsh dwells at the upper pelagic zone only at late summer and autumn nights, when feeding efﬁciency is again reduced because of lower light level (kahilainen et al. 2004). despite the relatively scarce zooplankton re- sources in lake muddusja¨rvi, dr whiteﬁsh is the most numerous whiteﬁsh form. this might be the result of life history, as this form reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3 and at the length of 12 cm. early maturation is essential for dr whiteﬁsh, because it is the main prey for piscivorous brown_trout, arctic charr, burbot and pike (kahilainen & lehtonen 2003). as all these piscivores are able to consume dr whiteﬁsh at least up to 20 cm of length (kahilainen & lehtonen 2003), only few dr whiteﬁsh reach refuge size from predation. the two whiteﬁsh forms, ssr and lsr reach other sexual maturity at 15 and 23 cm of length (kahilainen et al. 2003). these forms have minor importance in predator’s diet, and they are able to delay sexual maturity. in contrast, dr whiteﬁsh has high probability of death and it reproduces at early age and size. resumen 1. tres morfas simpa´tridas de coregonus_lavaretus (l.) habitan el lago muddusja¨rvi, una lago sub-a´rtico del norte de finlandia. una de las morfas con branqui-espinas muy numerosas y espacialmente muy densiﬁcadas es pela´gica mientras que las otras dos morfas con branqui-espinas mas separadas son bento´nicas. en este estudio, investigamos las causas del menor taman˜o (95% de la poblacio´ n <15 cm. de longitud) de la morfa con numerosas branqui-espinas (dr). para ello, utilizamos datos sobre disponibilidad de zooplancton pela´gico, seleccio´n alimenticia, solapamiento alimenticio entre grupos de edad y crecimiento. 2. la densidad de zooplancton y la temperatura del agua fueron altas solamente en julio y agosto. los individuos dr de los grupos de edad 1–10 consumieron fundamentalmente zoop- lancton durante el periodo junio-septiembre, preﬁriendo cop- e´podos al inicio del verano y bosmı´nidos en oton˜o. en general, la longitud promedio del zooplancton en los esto´magos de los individuos dr fue signiﬁcativamente mayor que en los muestreos de zooplancton. 3. el solapamiento en la dieta entre los grupos de edad de individuos dr fue alto durante todos los meses indicando competicio´n de recursos entre-cohortes. los individuos dr alcanzaron la madurez sexual a la edad de 3 an˜os y a una longitud de 12 cm., taman˜o a partir del cual, solo observamos un menor crecimiento soma´tico. 4. las causas de un menor taman˜o medio y de un menor crecimiento estuvieron relacionadas con un alto solapamiento alimenticio y una pronta maduracio´ n sexual. planktivory and diet-overlap of whiteﬁsh
