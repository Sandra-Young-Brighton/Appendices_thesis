time-integrated diet; parasites; anadromous salmonids; naı¨ve and experienced predators introduction individual specialisation in trophic behaviour seems to occur commonly over a wide range of taxonomic groups (bolnick et al. 2003). an important question is how common and how stable are such interindividual heterogeneities in trophic behaviour. indicators of the temporal stability of individual dietary specialisation have used several indirect methods to assess historical dietary niche (e.g., bolnick et al. 2002, 2003). as most foodborne parasites use speciﬁc prey species as intermediate hosts, one of these methods tracks former diet by using the occurrence of trophically transmitted parasites (e.g., curtis et al. 1995; mackenzie & abaunza 1998). this method has been shown to compare favourably with other methods such as muscle stable isotope signals as time-integrated tracers of historical dietary niches of individual ﬁsh (knudsen et al. 2011). specialisation appears to have originated from an interplay between the innate and ⁄ or the plasticity of both behavioural and interindividual niche morphological adaptations (bolnick et al. 2003; gard- un˜o-paz & adams 2010). the accidental escape of hatchery-reared rainbow (oncorhynchus_mykiss walbaum) postsmolts trout serendipitously provided the opportunity to investigate the extent to which individual feeding specialisation occurs within a population of naive individuals living under natural conditions, using food-transmitted par- asites as time-integrated tracers for past trophic behaviour. in this study, a low natural selection for morphological traits is likely with hatchery-reared individuals; therefore, the role of behaviour in forag- ing specialisation here is likely to be more important than morphological adaptations. the escaped rainbow trout were naı¨ve predators in the sense that they had no experience with live prey prior to the escape. rainbow trout are non-native to the study region (a subarctic fjord in norway). to compare these naı¨ve predators with natural populations, we used native veteran migrants of sea-run arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) and sea-trout (salmo_trutta), which both are present in correspondence: r. knudsen, department of arctic and marine biology, university of tromsø, breivika, n-9037 tromsø, norway. e-mail: rune.knudsen@uit.no 522 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00500.x the same fjord system. landlocked salmonids are known from both experimental and ﬁeld studies to exhibit foraging specialisation at the individual level (amundsen et al. 1995; knudsen et al. 2004, 2010). furthermore, hatchery-reared naı¨ve brown_trout showed different foraging tactics towards live prey when compared with wild experienced trout (sund- strom & johnsson 2001). the diet of anadromous native salmonids in north- ern norwegian fjords seems to consist mainly of juvenile ﬁsh and large crustaceans (grønvik & klemetsen 1987; rikardsen et al. 2004, 2006, 2007). consequently, indigenous anadromous salmonids from this region are mainly infected by generalist parasite species transmitted via amphipods or small prey ﬁsh that are shared with different marine ﬁsh such as gadoids and herring (bristow et al. 1996; hemmingsen & mackenzie 2001; knudsen et al. 2005). non-native rainbow trout is observed to be infected of typically generalist parasite species in europe (kennedy & bush 1994), and such species were expected to dominate the parasitic fauna of the escaped rainbow trout. salmonids would exhibit in this study, we aim to explore the degree to which naı¨ve predators (no experience with live prey) are able to specialise on a subset of the, in total, high number of potential prey groups while living under natural conditions. we hypothesised that both the naı¨ve non-native rainbow trout and the experienced veteran native similar foraging behaviour in a common marine environ- ment. we further predicted that there will be a positive association between the infestation intensity of a speciﬁc parasite species (time-integrated histor- the ical dietary niche) and the occurrence of respective intermediate host in the stomachs (snapshot of the recent dietary niche) of individual naı¨ve ﬁsh. the presence of such an association will provide supportive evidence for a persistent resulting in several subgroups of behaviourally specialised phenotypes of predators co-existing in both the naı¨ve and veteran populations. (prey items) feeding behaviour individual trophic behaviour mm and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. in june and july, 33 arctic charr (mean size: 315.4 mm ± 48.7 sd, range: 218–465 mm) and 19 sea-trout (mean size: 282.1 mm ± 80.9 sd, range: 174–439 mm) were captured. during these months, additional 22 individ- ually tagged arctic charr were recaptured in the fjord after being released from the talvik research station within the altafjord system (more details of ﬁsh sampling and the mark–recapture procedures are given by rikardsen & sandring (2006) and rikardsen et al. (2006, 2007)). unfortunately, no parasite or diet data exist for these recaptured ﬁsh. the size of the arctic charr smolts (ﬁrst year to sea) and veteran migrants range: 185–243 mm, was 198.9 mm (±14.8 sd, n = 14) and 302.6 mm (±34.6 sd, range: 272– 329 mm, n = 8), respectively, and had been to sea for 5.4 (±9.6 sd; range: 1–34 days) and 23.4 (±19.9 sd; range: 1–51 days) days before recaptured, respec- tively. no such data existed for sea-trout. thus, almost all caught charr and it is assumed that most sea-trout in this study are, by their size range, veteran migrants with at least one earlier season in the fjord. stomach contents of rainbow trout (naı¨ve predators) and arctic charr and sea-trout (veteran predators) were classiﬁed into four main groups of prey: (i) terrestrial insects (adults, pupae and larvae), (ii) marine amphi- pods, (iii) marine ﬁsh; sand-eel (ammodytes spp.), gadoids (gadus morhua) or herring (clupea harengus) and (iv) other prey (other crustaceans and snails). each stomach was opened and the total fullness visually determined on a percentage scale ranging from empty (0%) to full (100%). the importance of each prey category in the diet was calculated in terms of per cent abundance (ai), frequency of occurrence (fi) and prey- (pi) abundance speciﬁc estimated according to  x x amundsen et al.

(2004). during mid-may 2002, an unknown number of postsmolt (120–340 g) rainbow trout escaped from a local ﬁsh farm shortly after transfer to saltwater during a single event. in total, 37 rainbow trout were caught in june to august 2002 by using ﬂoating gill nets close to the shore in the inner part of the fjord system. all ﬁsh caught were measured (fork length) to the nearest where ni is the number of ﬁsh with prey i in their stomach, n is the total numbers of ﬁsh with stomach contents, si is the contribution of prey i to stomach fullness, sti is the total stomach fullness of ﬁsh with prey i in their stomach, and st is the total stomach fullness of all the ﬁsh. fish with a stomach fullness of <5% were excluded from the analyses of diet and diet– parasite associations. dietary specialisation was quan- tiﬁed by comparing each individual’s diet niche with population diet niche, and proportional similarity for individual’s diet niche was calculated according to bolnick et al.

(i.e., the terms ‘prevalence’ the proportion of infected hosts) and ‘abundance’ (i.e., the mean number of parasites in both infected and uninfected hosts) of parasites are used according to bush et al. (1997). statistical analyses were conducted with chi-square tests (v2) or mann–whitney u-tests (systat, version 13.0; systat inc., chicago, usa). correlation analyses between parasite and prey comparisons in individual ﬁsh were carried out with spearman rank correlations. knudsen et al. 0.3 0.2 0.1 s l a u d i v i d n i f o n o i t r o p o r p 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 psi - value 0.8 1.0 fig. 1.

is the proportion of the same prey type in the whole population sample. the lower the psi value, the more specialised the individuals are compared to the overall population (see bolnick et al. 2003; sargeant 2007). three salmonid species were recorded and enumerated from mainly the intestine and the stomachs and a few from the body cavity of the ﬁsh. the parasites are established in their ﬁsh host at once their intermediate hosts are digested, which usually will occur within relatively few hours after ingestion at the water temperatures observed during the study period (8–15 °c). based on atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) postsmolts studies in the same fjord system (see knudsen et al. 2005), the parasites were divided into two groups according to their intermedi- ate host (i) parasites transmitted by gammarids such as the achantocephalan echinorhyncus gadi and (ii) parasites transmitted mainly by ﬁsh, such as trematodes (e.g., lecithaster gibbosus and derogenes varicus) and several nematode species. based on the estimation of prey (the intermediate host) consumption rates, the abundance of parasites observed in the ﬁsh hosts type (mackenzie & abaunza 1998): recorded from any of the diet of postsmolt rainbow trout, sea-trout and arctic charr was dominated by small-sized ﬁshes (sand-eel, gadoids or herring), crustaceans (benthic amphipods) and insects (adults and larvae) (table 1). zooplankton was not the stomach contents. the frequency of empty stomachs was similar across all species (rainbow trout: 24.3%, charr: 27.3% and trout: 21.1%. the dietary niche of each individual predator was narrow (i.e., low per cent similarity), compared with the diet composition of the total sample of all of the three predator species (fig. 1). the veteran migrants (sea-trout and charr) had more variable psi values than the naı¨ve predator. for all three predator species, prey-speciﬁc abundance of ﬁsh as prey was between 70% and 100% and for insects between 59% and 100%. amphipods as prey was 48% for both rainbow trout and charr but comprised only 6% of the prey-speciﬁc abundance for sea-trout (table 1). gammarids and ﬁsh rarely co- occurred in stomachs. one rainbow trout but no veteran migrants (1.3% of the total of all ﬁsh) had eaten both prey types. this individual is not included in further parasite–stomach associations. according to their stomach contents, individual ﬁsh could thus be grouped as either gammaridivore, piscivore or as a third foraging group that had consumed other prey (mainly insectivore). the mean ﬁsh length or weight was not different

the stomach con- tents (empty stomachs excluded) were evident in both individual naı¨ve and veteran predators separately [spearman rank correlations: achanthocephalans vs. gammaridivore, 0.464, n = 28; and 0.680, n = 39, respectively, p < 0.001; trematodes ⁄ nematodes (com- bined) versus piscivore, 0.400 and 0.433, respectively; p < 0.01]. in contrast, highly signiﬁcant negative correlations (p < 0.01) were observed between para- site infection and the per cent stomach fullness of non- corresponding intermediate host from the stomach content in both individual naı¨ve and veteran predators (achanthocephalans vs. piscivore: spearman rank )0.324 and )0.542, respectively; trematodes ⁄ nema- todes vs. gammaridivore: spearman rank )0.607 and )0.345, respectively). in both naı¨ve and veteran predators, there was a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence (i.e., the proportion of infected hosts) of infection of acanthocephalans in gammaridivore ﬁsh than in both piscivore and insec- tivore foraging groups (table 2; d.f. = 1; v2-tests p < 0.05). furthermore, there was a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of infection of both nematodes (v2-tests: d.f. = 1; p < 0.005) and trematodes (p < 0.01) in the piscivore foraging group compared with gammaridi- vore ﬁsh in both naı¨ve and veterans predators. differ- ences in the prevalence of infection of both nematodes and trematodes were signiﬁcant between piscivore and insectivore veteran ﬁsh (v2-tests: d.f. = 1; p < 0.05), but this difference was not evident between these two foraging groups in the naı¨ve predators (p > 0.05). similarly, in both arctic charr and naı¨ve rainbow trout, signiﬁcantly higher abundances (i.e., the mean number of parasites) of achanthocephalans and lower abun- dances of nematode ⁄ trematodes were evident in the gammaridivore ﬁsh compared with the other two foraging groups (mann–whitney u-tests d.f. = 1: vs. piscivore, u-statistics between 46.5 and 208; p-values between 0.000 and 0.007; vs. insectivore: u-statistics between 9 and 57; p-values between 0.008 and 0.026; fig. 2). parasite abundance between piscivore and insectivore ﬁsh did not differ in either naı¨ve or veteran ﬁsh species (mann–whitney u-tests: u-statistics be- tween 22.5 and 38.5; p-values between 0.288 and 0.578). the nine specimens of rainbow trout, nine specimens of arctic charr and four specimens of sea- trout with empty or low (<5%) stomach contents had low infections of all parasite taxa. discussion as expected, there were positive associations between the occurrence of speciﬁc prey categories in ﬁsh stomach contents and

readily acquired helminth species transmitted by their corresponding prey and had in contrast low levels of other helminth species that would have been transmitted by other potential prey. this clearly shows that both the naı¨ve non-native predators and native experienced (veteran) migrants exhibited a pronounced individual specialisation on amphipods or ﬁsh prey in this fjord system. the coexistence of several behavioural phenotypes within a salmonid population has been observed from both ﬁeld and laboratory studies (wilson & mclaughlin 2007; farewell & mclaughlin 2009; knudsen et al. 2011). such narrow individual resource use is also observed in many other natural populations (bolnick et al. 2003), but not previously detected by naı¨ve predators in a natural marine environment. this corre- sponds to divergent foraging behaviours described from polymorphic salmonid populations with a resource specialisation towards either benthic or pelagic prey (respectively, amphipods and ﬁsh larvae in the present study) (e.g., robinson & parsons 2002). parasites have been found to be a promising time- integrated ecological marker of temporal consistency in diet specialisation at both the individual and population levels of different ﬁsh species (e.g., knud- sen et al. 1996, 2003; wilson et al. 1996). several indirect methods indicate that the temporal consistency in feeding specialisation may last over longer periods of time (e.g., months to years) in wild ﬁsh (bolnick et al. 2003; knudsen et al. 2010). unfortunately, no exact date for the escape of the rainbow trout is available, but they were placed in the sea cages in mid- the following three may and were caught over successive months. we conclude that the temporal consistency in foraging behaviour of the naı¨ve preda- tors most probably has lasted for at least 2 months in the marine environment. this is comparable with marine feeding period of the experienced ﬁsh, as the individually tagged arctic charr stayed in the fjord system for up to 2 months before their capture. the abundance of foodborne parasites were rela- tively similar in rainbow trout compared with native salmonids found within this fjord system. this sim- ilarity in abundance probably reﬂects the high feeding rates and ⁄ or selective predation on infected prey (knudsen et al. 2001; amundsen et al. 2003) as the infection level of the intermediate hosts (i.e., echino- rynchus gadi in gammarid hosts) seems, in general, to be low (marcogliese 1994; knudsen et al. 2005). a large proportion of individual predators in this study exhibited a specialised foraging behaviour; 77% of the naı¨ve and 85% of the experienced predators were gammaridivore or piscivore (empty stomachs ex- cluded). the dietary breadth of each individual ﬁsh, both naı¨ve and experienced, was also clearly narrow 526 when compared with the overall food resource use. thus, speciﬁc prey preferences among the salmonid species were observed. the sea-trout seemed to be the most piscivorous species, while arctic charr and rainbow trout fed relatively more on gammarus prey. these differences were found among the predators, even though all ﬁsh were caught in the near-shore zone (<5 m depth) of the fjord. such differences in diet between arctic charr and trout are seen in other northern fjords (grønvik & klemetsen 1987). mechanisms of interindividual variation in feeding specialisation are often related to the innate and ⁄ or the plasticity in either, behaviourally (e.g., search image, capture and handling behaviour) or trophically related morphological traits (bolnick et al. 2003; gardun˜o-paz & adams 2010). morphological adaptations associated with trophic specialisation seem to be common in wild salmonids (adams et al. 1998; klemetsen et al. 2002; knudsen et al. 2007). in contrast, selective breeding of rainbow trout has focused on rapid growth and pellet feeding over generations. thus, low diet–morpholog- ical associations with low specialisation in trophic morphology are likely to result in low adaptations to forage in a novel environment. this suggests that behavioural mechanisms for prey detection and con- sumption (de kerckhove et al. 2006) must be impor- tant in dietary specialisation of the naı¨ve rainbow trout. the ﬂexibility of behavioural traits is high (west- eberhard 2005) and has both a heritable and a plastic component in salmonids (klemetsen et al. 2006; keeley et al. 2007; wilson & mclaughlin 2007). the similar foraging patterns observed between naı¨ve and experienced predators that common mechanisms are driving the occurrence of similar specialised phenotypes in both groups of ﬁsh. suggest as hatchery-reared rainbow trout typically are naı¨ve to live prey, the adaptation to wild prey highlighted here may pinpoint both heritable and ⁄ or learned components of foraging behaviour. the similar forag- ing patterns of the naı¨ve rainbow trout (no experience with live prey) and veteran predators (foraging behaviour has learned experience element) suggest that the predator’s ability to search, recognise and attack live prey has an innate component. however, as salmonids have fast learning response towards novel prey (e.g., reiriz et al. 1998; klemetsen et al. 2006), learning could also be a key factor (warburton 2003). learning behaviour is expected in generalist predators (ishii & shimada 2010) such as salmonids that search for a variety of prey types (klemetsen et al. 2003). novel experience with speciﬁc live prey may, if successful, be a food reward for a naı¨ve predator, which may initiate selective searching behaviour for this particular prey among the large variety of prey types available in this marine environment. this may be important for the observed specialisation in forag- ing behaviour of these naı¨ve predators, as a predator’s efﬁciency is greatly increased when they specialise on a single prey type (dukas & kamil 2001). this individual feeding specialisation should also be adap- tive to prey types that are locally abundant, like gammarids and small ﬁsh are in this fjord (rikardsen et al. 2004, 2007). thus, behavioural components seem to be key factors in the origin of interindividual niche specialisation where several behavioural pheno- types co-occur within a population. the parasites recorded in the rainbow trout were all generalist species that are common in atlantic salmon and many marine ﬁsh species in northern areas, which have a life expectancy of several months in their ﬁsh hosts, and none are regarded as severely pathogenic species (bristow et al. 1996; hemmingsen & mac- kenzie 2001; knudsen et al. 2005). thus, relatively low species-speciﬁc host–parasite interactions were likely to occur which could have inﬂuenced the observed parasite patterns in the naı¨ve predators. on the other hand, the differences in the abundance of parasites between the two native ﬁsh predators or between naı¨ve and veteran predators (e.g., arctic charr) suggest that species-speciﬁc susceptibility against these parasite species may occur, along with species-speciﬁc dietary preferences among the predators. in conclusion, the naı¨ve, non-native hatchery-reared rainbow trout postsmolts showed an individual forag- ing specialisation after their release into the marine environment. these naı¨ve predators had a similar foraging behaviour to the native veteran migrants of sea-trout and anadromous arctic charr. individual ﬁsh were able to specialise on benthic (gammarids) or pelagic prey (small ﬁsh), and these behavioural specialist phenotypes co-existed in both the naı¨ve and experienced predator populations. the most important mechanism behind the observed diet spe- cialisation seems to rely on ﬂexible behaviour rather than foraging-related morphological traits. the tem- poral consistency in trophic behaviour was apparently maintained for at least 2 months. acknowledgements we thank stig sandring
