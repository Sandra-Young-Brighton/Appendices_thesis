car- penter et al. 1987; persson et al. 1993). reduction of ﬁsh biomass by intensive ﬁshing can be a tool to control nutrients and development of algae in lakes (e.g. andersson et al. 1978; shapiro & wright 1984; sanni & wærvågen 1990; sønder- gaard et al. 1990). through top-down effects, a de- crease in planktivore ﬁsh leads to higher densities of zooplankton grazers and further diminishes algal biomass (shapiro & wright 1984; carpenter et al. 1985; reynolds 1994). benthivorous ﬁsh and especially detrivorous cyprinids can affect water quality and development of algae in water column by releasing nutrients from the bottom (andersson et al. 1978; tatrai & istvanovits 1986; horppila & kairesalo 1990; tatrai et al. 1990, persson & ham- rin 1994). a direct effect on turbidity by resuspen- sion of bottom particles has been noticed at the same time (meijer et al. 1990). this study is part of the analysis of a biomanip- ulation study. biomanipulation was conducted through mass removal of cyprinid ﬁsh. food con- sumption, the feeding ecology and diet of four dominant ﬁsh species, roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)), bream (abramis brama (l.)), perch (perca ﬂuviat- ilis (l.)) and ruffe gymnocephalus cernuus (l.)), were evaluated in mesotrophic lake pohjalampi (eastern finland), which was ﬁshed intensively from 1992 to 1996. the total food consumption of ﬁsh populations was evaluated by using a bioener- getics model (hewett & johnson 1992). we focused on the diet of ﬁsh species and the change in food consumption by the ﬁsh population. possible mechanisms of the inﬂuence to water quality by intensive ﬁshing are discussed (top-down effect ver- sus nutrient release from the bottom). during the study years, the biomass of zooplankton in lake 153 tolonen et al. pohjalampi decreased and the biomass of benthic invertebrates increased (leppä et al. 1995). description of the study lake lake pohjalampi is situated in eastern finland (62(cid:190)40¿n, 29(cid:190)33¿e); its surface area is 0.61 km2, mean depth 3.2 m and maximum depth 5.3 m. the lake receives mainly nutrient-poor groundwater from several brooks originating from the sur- rounding ridges, and the retention time of water (volume 1.97 million m3) is only 5 months. the catchment area has one dairy farm and ten holiday residences but no other major sources of nutrients. the area under cultivation has shrunk from about 20% of the catchment area in the 1970s to 10% today. in summertime, algal blooms and decreased water clarity have lowered the recreational value of the lake. the ﬁrst recorded massive bloom of blue- green algae in august 1986 was followed by similar blooms in 1990 and 1992. during the 6-month ice- covered period, the lake has also for several years suffered from oxygen depletion in the hypolim- nion. the summertime average for total phos- phorus varies around 30 mg ` l»1, chlorophyll-a around 12 mg ` l»1 and secchi depth around 1.5– 2.0 m. the composition of ﬁsh species has also gone through some major changes during the past two decades. in the 1970s the catch included mainly perch, less roach, bleak (alburnus alburnus (l.)), ruffe, pike (esox lucius (l.)) and bream, some of which weighed up to several kilograms. but from the 1980s, the roach and bream populations be- came very dense, the average size of bream and perch decreased, and pike became scarce. simultaneously with the changes in ﬁsh popula- tion, the macrophyte vegetation decreased and was scarce at the beginning of biomanipulation in 1993. for example, in the 1960s and 1970s the shal- low (about 1 m) lamperinlahti bay was sur- rounded by dense vegetation of sedges (carex spp.), and bur reed (sparganium spp.) and yellow water lily (nuphar sp.) were abundant on the open water area. in the beginning of biomanipulation, the sedges had retreated, and the bur reeds and yellow water lilies on open water were become sparse. material and methods stomach contents of ﬁsh 45 mm and 55 mm and a seine net with 6 mm mesh size. the sampling time with gill nets varied between 1 and 3 hours. an additional 30 roach caught in august 1995 were also analyzed. the in- testinal tracts of the ﬁsh were removed in the ﬁeld and preserved in 70% ethanol. perch and roach were divided into four size classes. individuals of ruffe were divided into three size classes, and if possible the stomachs of 20 individuals from each size class were analysed. the size classes of perch were ,8 cm, 8–11.9 cm, 12–15.9 cm and –16 cm; the size classes of roach were ,11 cm, 11–14.9 cm, 15–18.9 cm and –19 cm; and the size classes of ruffe were ,9 cm, 9–10.4 cm and –10.5 cm. the ages of the ﬁsh were determined from the scales. since bream and roach lack a distinct stomach, only the anterior third of the intestine was ana- lyzed. the stomach contents were examined with a stereomicroscope. the food items were identiﬁed to species level, if possible. zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and ﬁsh ingested were identiﬁed, counted and measured. reconstructed carbon bio- mass of the ingested zooplankton was estimated using length-weight regressions (vasama & kan- kaala 1991; rahkola et al. 1998). for benthic in- vertebrates, length-weight regressions of dry mass were used (smock 1980; meyer 1989; haugen & rygg 1996; holopainen & paasivirta unpublished data); and the dry masses were converted to car- bon masses by using the carbon mass-dry mass re- lationships of salonen et al. (1976). broken macro- invertebrates were common, especially, in the guts of cyprinids and head capsule width-weight re- gressions (smock 1980) were used. for ﬁsh prey, the length-weight regressions of wet mass (kor- honen & heikinheimo-schmid 1993) were used; and wet masses were converted to carbon masses according to karjalainen et al. (1995). the pro- portions (%) of detritus, macrophytes and ﬁla- mentous green algae were estimated visually as the volume of the stomach contents. frequency of oc- currence (f%) was also calculated for some of the most important prey species. f% expresses how many stomachs examined include a certain prey item (e.g. jamet et al. 1990). differences in the proportions of food categories (e.g. zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, ﬁsh) be- tween the different size classes of ﬁsh species were examined using kruskal-wallis nonparametric analysis of variance and paired comparisons (pc- test, conover 1980). the stomach contents of 83 roach, 14 bream, 52 ruffe and 84 perch from lake pohjalampi were analyzed in 1996. the ﬁsh were caught in august (12–29 august 1996) using gill nets with mesh sizes 12 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, estimation of food consumption bioenergetics models were used to estimate the population-level roach, bream, perch and ruffe in lake pohjalampi. the food consumption of 154 table 1. parameter values used in bioenergetics models for 0„ and –0„ roach and perch. symbols are the same as those used by hewett & johnson (1992). symbol parameter description roach 0„ roach –0„ perch 0„ perch –0„ food consumption of cyprinids and percids intercept for cmax coefﬁcient, cmax vs. fm temperature coefﬁcient optimum temperature maximum temperature consumption, cmax g ` g»1 ` day»1 ca cb cq cto ctm metabolism, r go2 ` g»1 ` day»1 ra rb rq act sda fa fb fg ua ub ug intercept for routine rate of r coefﬁcient, routine rate of r vs. fm coefﬁcient, r vs. temperature coefﬁcient, activity coefﬁcient, speciﬁc dynamic action proportion of c egested coefﬁcient, egestion vs. temperature coefﬁcient, egestion vs. feeding rate proportion of absorbed c excreted coefﬁcient, egestion vs. temperature coefﬁcient, egestion vs. feeding rate energy content cal ` fm»1 detritus algae-macrophytes benthic invertebrates zooplankton fish larvae fish 0.0431 »0.3821 0.09351 0.001011 »0.12731 0.11881 11 0.151 0.201 0.33 »0.153 3.03 273 303 0.01883 »0.283 13 0.183 0.13 0.511 »0.421 2.31 0.01081 »0.21 2.11 11 0.1721 0.151 0.051 0.0643 0.151 0.405 »0.275 3.95 235 285 0.0355 »0.25 2.85 15 0.155 0.1585 »0.2225 0.6315 0.02925 0.585 »0.2995 1062 7503 8003 6764 10001 10001 1062 7503 8003 6764 10001 1000–16111 8003 6764 10001 1016–16111 8003 6764 10001 1016–16111 1 karjalainen et al. (1997a) 4 karjalainen et al. (1997b) 2 ahlgren (1990) 5 karås & thoresson (1992) 3 horppila & peltonen (1997) model parameters of roach were used for both cyp- rinids, and the parameters of perch were applied for both percids (table 1). young-of-the-year and –1-year-old ﬁsh had separate sets of parameters. the growth and population size of each age group were estimated every year from the population samples, and the food consumption of an individ- ual ﬁsh was multiplied by the population size. the diet of the ﬁsh was based only on samples taken in august 1996. seasonal changes in the diet can be occur (e.g. horppila 1994), but due to limited re- sources it was not possible to sample more thor- oughly. in august, food consumption of the ﬁsh peaks, and august samples will therefore give the best insight into the food consumption of the ﬁsh population in lake pohjalampi. construction of the bioenergetics models is described in detail by karjalainen et al. (1997a). the computer program of hewett & johnson (1992) was used for calcu- lation of food consumption. water temperatures in lake pohjalampi were recorded during the ice-free period when the lake was not stratiﬁed. roach and bream are omnivorous ﬁsh, and the speciﬁc assimilation efﬁciencies were used for the different types of prey. the proportions of con- sumed food egested have been reported to be 0.20, 0.40 and 0.50 for animal prey (hofer et al. 1985), detritus (alhgren 1990) and algae-macrophyte diet (persson 1983; hofer et al. 1985), respectively. the energy content of detritus in our bioenergetic cal- culations was lower than the values used by horppila & peltonen (1997). ahlgren (1990) found that the energy content of detritus with 16% or- ganic matter content was 3.5 kcal (14.9 kj) per gram of ash-free dry mass in a small pond. the dry and organic matter contents in the sediment of lake pohjalampi were 8.5”1.4% and 23.6”0.7% of dry mass, respectively. when the dif- ference in the organic content were taken into ac- count, the energy content was 106 calories per gram of fresh mass (fm). on the other hand, the difference in the energy content of detritus were compensated for in the calculations of horppila & peltonen (1997) due to the higher indigestible coef- ﬁcient (0.9). for estimating the population size of roach, bream, perch and ruffe, the total catch data for the years 1993–1996 were used in the virtual popula- tion analysis (vpa; gulland 1983; peltonen & horppila 1992). for the gradual removal of ﬁsh stocks, seining was used in winter and in autumn, and pound-nets in spring. a constant instan- taneous natural mortality value, m‰0.2 year»1, was used for all ages and years. the catchability coefﬁcient from the complete cohorts was used to calculate the terminal ﬁshing mortality for each 155 tolonen et al. fig. 1. relative composition (%) of the diet of roach, bream, perch and ruffe in 1996 in lake pohjalampi age group. the age of recruitment was 2 years and the maximum age was 6–10 years. the population size of 0„ ﬁsh was estimated by larval sampling (karjalainen et al. 1997b) performed twice during each summer from 1993 to 1996. the population sizes of the ﬁsh at age 1 were estimated by calculat- ing the relative number of 1-year-old ﬁsh in the autumn seine catches. the average individual growth rates of ﬁsh were estimated from population samples taken ran- domly from the seine and net catches. the annual sample size ranges for roach, bream, perch and ruffe were 129–164, 23–50, 41–89 and 28–77, re- spectively. the standard length (sl) and (fm) of roach, bream, perch and ruffe were measured; and their scales were stored for age determination. the age of 2- to 9-year-old ﬁsh was determined from scales; and for back-calculations, the radius of the scales and the ﬁrst annuli were measured. the back-calculated standard lengths were estimated by the non-linear method generally attributed to monastyrsky (e.g. francis 1990). standard length was converted to fm by the power functions ﬁtted yearly for each species of ﬁsh. results diet of roach, bream, perch and ruffe in lake pohjalampi, the diets of the dominant ﬁsh species differed: cyprinids had an omnivorous diet, while percids ate mainly invertebrates or small ﬁsh (fig. 1). in 1996, detritus composed 53–72% of the stomach content by volume in all size classes of roach. the proportion of detritus was greatest in the largest size class, i.e. –19 cm (72%), and there was a signiﬁcant difference between size classes in the use of detritus as a food (kruskal-wallis, p‰ table 2. relative composition of animal food in the diet of cyprinids in lake pohjalampi. values are percentages of the total carbon weight of the diet. standard deviation is in parentheses (”sd). food items zooplankton total bosmina spp. sidacrystallina other cladocerans copepods surface insects benthic invertebrates total ceratopogonids chironomid larvae chironomid pupae ephemeropterans trichopterans water mites ostracods molluscs others fish total number of cases age of ﬁsh 156 roach ,11 cm 11–14.9 cm 15–18.9 cm –19 cm 27.4 (”40.1) 20.0 (”35.5) 4.9 (”20.6) 0.4 2.1 (”9.3) 0.4 (”1.6) 72.2 (”40.0) 0.0 22.1 (”36.4) 18.4 (”35.4) 5.0 (”22.0) 0.0 14.4 (”23.9) 6.0 (”12.4) 6.3 (”23.1) 0.0 0.0 100.0 20 ,3 8.9 (”24.5) 6.8 (”24.1) 0.6 (”2.5) 1.5 0.0 6.0 (”14.7) 85.1 (”28.0) 3.3 (”13.5) 12.0 (”25.9) 44.8 (”43.5) 4.5 (”10.3) 5.4 (”22.4) 4.8 (”13.1) 4.8 (”10.4) 0.0 5.5 0.0 100.0 20 3–4 7.6 (”25.0) 0.0 1.1 (”4.4) 6.5 „ 8.6 (”24.0) 83.8 (”32.6) 6.3 (”25.0) 25.0 (”37.5) 19.7 (”31.5) 0.0 6.0 (”16.6) 5.6 (”16.1) 21.2 (”34.5) 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 20 5–6 1.2 (”3.8) 0.2 (”0.7) 0.0 0.1 0.9 (”3.8) 0.0 93.9 (”22.1) 0.0 32.3 (”35.6) 11.6 (”26.4) 0.0 0.1 (”0.4) 11.7 (”27.5) 19.9 (”28.4) 18.3 (”37.7) 0.0 4.9 (”22.0) 100.0 20 –7 bream 30–40 cm „ 0.0 0.0 „ 0.0 0.0 100.0 (”0.1) 0.0 51.0 (”56.6) 3.1 (”5.4) 2.1 (”2.8) 9.3 (”18.6) 0.0 0.0 33.1 (”39.6) 1.4 (”2.4) 0.0 100.0 14 5–9 table 3. composition of the diet of percids in different size classes. values are percentages of the total carbon weight of the diet. standard deviation is in parentheses (”sd). perch ruffe food items ,8 cm 8–11.9 cm 12–15.9 cm –16 cm ,9 cm 9–10.5 cm –10.5 cm food consumption of cyprinids and percids zooplankton total bosminaspp. ceriodaphniaspp. leptodorakindti sidacrystallina other cladocerans copepods benthic invertebrates total chironomidae larvae chironomidae pupae trichopterans others fish tot. perch (0„) ruffe (0„) other ﬁsh fish unidentiﬁed total number of cases age of ﬁsh 66.1 (”38.6) 39.9 (”33.6) 11.3 (”17.7) 4.4 (”11.2) „ 3.3 7.2 (”10.0) 33.9 (”38.6) 3.6 (”5.4) 26.7 (”35.9) 0.0 3.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 20 ,2 34.0 (”31.7) 0.1 (”0.1) 0.0 32.4 (”32.3) 1.3 (”3.2) 0.2 „ 61.9 (”32.6) 5.6 (”16.6) 53.9 (”30.0) 1.6 (”6.4) 2.4 4.1 (”18.5) 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.1 (”18.5) 100.0 20 2–3 0.2 (”0.8) 0.2 (”0.8) 0.0 0.0 „ 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 16.8 (”35.7) 4.2 (”13.5) 6.9 (”17.0) 0.0 5.7 83.0 (”36.1) 8.7 (”25.5) 34.3 (”45.3) 0.5 (”2.3) 39.5 (”46.3) 100.0 20 4–6 29.7 (”45.6) 0.9 (”4.2) 24.5 (”42.7) 0.0 4.2 70.4 (”45.6) 17.4 (”36.4) 22.8 (”41.0) 0.0 30.1 (”46.1) 100.0 20 –6 0.2 (”0.3) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 (”0.3) 0.0 99.8 (”0.3) 61.1 (”30.2) 15.3 (”24.5) 8.8 (15.3) 14.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 10 ,3 3.4 (”18.2) 3.2 (”18.0) 0.0 0.0 0.1 (”0.5) 0.1 0.0 0.7 (”1.4) 0.0 0.0 0.2 (”0.6) 0.2 (”0.6) 0.3 0.0 96.6 (”18.8) 74.4 (”31.7) 14.4 (”23.9) 3.9 (”17.0) 3.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 31 3–5 99.3 (”1.4) 84.1 (”25.3) 9.8 (”25.9) 0.0 5.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 8 –5 0.07 and pc-test, p,0.05). likewise, a major part of the diet of bream consisted of detritus; the pro- portion of animal food was 30%. filamentous green algae and pieces of macrophytes were also very important in the diet of roach. the three smallest size classes ate more green algae than the larger ﬁsh did, and there was a signiﬁcant differ- ence between the largest and the other classes (kruskal-wallis, p,0.001 and pc-test, p,0.05). in all size classes of roach, animal food made up 14–29% of the total volume of the stomach con- tent, and no signiﬁcant differences were found be- tween size classes (kruskal-wallis, p–0.05). the animal diets were dominated by benthic invert- ebrates (–70% of the animal food), and zooplank- ton was only of minor importance. in the smallest size class of roach (,11 cm or 1-year-old ﬁsh) the proportion of zooplankton was 27% and thus sig- niﬁcantly higher than in the other size classes (kruskal-wallis, p,0.001 and pc-test, p,0.01). the most important genus of zooplankton in the diet was bosmina (table 2). the dominant benthic food items of cyprinids included molluscs (pisidium spp., gyraulus spp. and valvata piscinalis), ostracods, water mites (hydrachnellae), and the larvae and pupae of chi- ronomids (e.g. chironomus spp., cladopelma spp., endochironomus spp., tanytarsus spp. and procla- dius spp.). ceratopogonids, ephemeropterans (e.g. caenis spp.), trichopterans (e.g. molanna spp., athripsodes aterrimus, cyrnus ﬂavidus and phry- ganeidae) and surface food (ﬂying insects) were of minor importance in the diet of roach. a 24-cm- long roach had caught one young-of-the-year perch. small perch and all ruffe ate only invertebrates. the diet of ,8 cm perch was dominated by zo- oplankton, and the rest of the diet consisted of benthic invertebrates. the diet of ruffe consisted almost exclusively of benthic invertebrates. the zo- oplankton diet of small perch was dominated by bosmina, but sida crystallina, ceriodaphnia and copepods were also important prey items (table 3). most of the benthic invertebrate prey of small perch and ruffe were chironomids (chironomus spp., cladopelma spp., tanytarsus spp. and procla- dius spp.). trichopterans (athripsodes spp., mysta- cides spp. and molanna spp.), ceratopogonids, ephemeropterans, oligochaetes and amphipod (pallasea quadrispinosa) were also found in the stomachs of ruffe (table 3). the diet of perch 8–11.9 cm long was dominated by benthic invertebrates and zooplankton, but some ﬁsh were also caught by middle-sized perch. a large cladoceran species, leptodora kindti, was the dominant prey item in the zooplankton and chironomids in the zoobenthos. perch –12 cm long fed mostly on young-of-the-year ruffe and perch. the frequency of occurrence (f%) of ﬁsh in the diet of large perch was 80%. in addition, large perch fed on chironomids, ephemeropterans, trich- opterans, dragonﬂy larvae (aeshna spp.) and the amphipod (pallasea quadrispinosa). in summary, perch of various sizes ate different types of food: 157 tolonen et al. fig. 2. size of roach, bream, perch and ruffe populations (kg fresh mass ` ha»1 and ind. ` ha»1) in lake pohjalampi during ﬁsh removal the variation in the roach diet between years was studied by comparing the stomach contents of roach collected in august 1995 and 1996. roach caught in august 1995 were mostly –15 cm long. in 1995, the relative proportions of detritus and plant material in the diet of –15 cm roach were 73.5% and 8.1%, respectively; and there were no signiﬁcant differences between years (mann-whit- ney u, p–0.05). the proportion of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates in the diet of roach –15 cm differed between years (mann-whitney u, p,0.05). in 1995 and 1996, the relative pro- portions of zooplankton were 25.6% and 4.0%, re- spectively, and the proportions of benthic invert- ebrates 74.4% and 89.4%, respectively. in 1995, the zooplankton diet consisted mainly of chydorids and bosmina. of the benthic invertebrates, chiron- omids (mostly larvae), ostracods, molluscs and trichopterans were the dominant food items. population-level food consumption of ﬁsh before the population-level estimates of food con- sumption were calculated, the population size, mean growth and individual food consumption of ﬁsh of different age groups were estimated. in lake pohjalampi, the total biomass of ﬁsh decreased during intensive ﬁshing (fig. 2). in 1996, the bio- fig. 3. relative proportions (%, numbers of individuals) of age classes of roach, bream, perch and ruffe during intensive ﬁshing in lake pohjalampi the proportions of zooplankton, benthic invert- ebrates and ﬁsh differed signiﬁcantly between the four size classes (kruskal-wallis, p,0.001 and pc-test, p,0.05). 158 fig. 4. average fresh mass (g) of roach, bream, perch and ruffe at various ages in 1992–1996 in lake pohjalampi mass of roach and bream were 14% and 6%, re- spectively, of the biomass at the beginning of ﬁsh- ing. on the other hand, the total biomass of perch and ruffe was unchanged or increased slightly dur- ing the study period, while the number of perch increased dramatically in 1996. at the same time the total food consumption of the ﬁsh population decreased by 66%. the roach population was dominated by old ﬁsh at the beginning of ﬁshing and by young ﬁsh at the end of the study period (fig. 3). the bream population consisted mainly of four dominating year-classes. the age distri- butions of the percids were skewed to the young age classes. the growth of roach and bream differed be- tween sampling years (fig. 4), as shown by the dif- ference (p,0.05) in the slopes of the linear growth regressions. in 1995 and 1996, the growth of –4- year-old ﬁsh was clearly faster than in 1992–1994. improvement of the growth, during the study period, may indicate intense intraspesiﬁc compe- tition at high densities. during the whole sampling period, most of the bream were over 4 years old. food consumption of cyprinids and percids fig. 6. total food consumption (kg) of roach, bream, perch and ruffe populations in 1992–1996 in lake pohjalampi. the estimates were calculated with the bioenergetics model. during the study period, no changes were ob- served in the growth of percids; i.e. the slopes did not differ (p–0.05). the food consumption of individual ﬁsh varied during the growth season (fig. 5). at the end of april, when the water temperature was less than 6(cid:190)c, the food consumption of all species was low. feeding started to increase rapidly with increasing water temperature and reached the maximum in the middle of august. individual food consump- tion increased in relation to the age and size of the ﬁsh. in 1992, the total food consumption of the roach population was higher than the food con- sumption of the other three species put together (fig. 6). ruffe had the lowest population biomass and food consumption. at the beginning of the intensive ﬁshing in 1992, zooplankton made up 31% of the total consumption (gfm) of the animal food of the whole ﬁsh population in lake pohjal- ampi, but increased to 56% during the study period. the total consumption of benthic invert- ebrates made up 57% and 36% of the animal diet in 1992 and 1996, respectively. the increase in the proportion of zooplankton was due to the con- siderable decrease in benthivorous ﬁsh during the study period and to the successful reproduction of perch in 1994 and 1996. 159 fig. 5. daily food consumption (g) of an individual roach, bream, perch and ruffe in 1994 in lake pohjalampi. food con- sumption is given separately for different age classes. tolonen et al. of the four ﬁsh species, only perch caught sig- niﬁcant amounts of ﬁsh for food; and the total consumption of ﬁsh remained low (7–26% of the total animal diet) throughout the study period. omnivorous roach and bream collected large amounts of detritus from the bottom of the lake: the total amount of detritus swallowed yearly by the cyprinids was estimated to be about 620 kg ` ha»1 in 1992 and 113 kg ` ha»1 in 1996. discussion during the period of intensive ﬁshing in lake pohjalampi, populations of cyprinids decreased considerably and percid populations increased. in 1996 perch was the most abundant ﬁsh species in our study lake, comprising 58% of the total ﬁsh biomass. the proportion of benthivorous ﬁsh de- creased due to the intensive ﬁshing between 1992 and 1996. at the same time, planktivorous ﬁsh in- creased as a result of the dominance of younger age classes, e.g. due to the successful reproduction of perch in 1994 and 1996. the ability of roach and bream to consume de- tritus is one of the characteristics that gives them a competitive advantage over species like perch under eutrophic conditions (persson 1983) and makes it possible for cyprinids to maintain dense populations despite shortage of high-value invert- ebrate food (michelsen et al. 1994). persson (1983) observed that during the whole ice-free period, de- tritus made up a high proportion of the stomach contents of 3- to 4-year-old roach in a swedish lake. in 1995 and 1996, our diet samples were col- lected in august and the proportion of detritus in the guts of roach was high (50–72%) during both sampling periods. the diet of roach and ruffe were quite similar in all size classes. however, detritus seemed to be a more important source of food for large roach than younger ones. the diet of perch shifted from zooplankton and benthic invert- ebrates (,12 cm) to ﬁsh (–12 cm). roach and ruf- fe do not undergo a substantial ontogenetic niche shift (bergman & greenberg 1994) as perch do (collette et al. 1977; hartmann & nümann 1977; bergman 1991). in the summer of 1993, the mean biomass of crustacean zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were 7380 kg and 1568 kg, respectively in the whole of lake pohjalampi. at the end of our study period 1996, the mean biomass of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were 3972 kg and 3267 kg, respectively. (rahkola, m. unpublished data; leppä, m. unpublished data). at the same time consumption of zooplankton by ﬁsh population increased slightly (4%) and consumption of ben- thic invertebrates decreased by 69%, in lake 160 by was pohjalampi. during the study period, the main strategy of feeding by ﬁsh changed from benthivo- ry towards planktivory due to a change in popula- tion structure of ﬁsh. about cyprinids the impact of detrivorous ﬁsh, like roach and bream, on the maintainance of high phytoplank- ton productivity can be remarkable, due to recyc- ling of nutrients taken directly from the sediments (andersson et al. 1978; horppila & kairesalo 1990; persson & hamrin 1994). at the beginning of the biomanipulation, the amount of detritus in- gested 620 kg ` ha»1summer»1 but decreased by 82% due to intensive ﬁshing. this means that disturbance of the sediment decreased considerably. removal of planktivorous ﬁsh is considered to be an effective tool in biomanipulation by changing the compo- sition of the zooplankton community from small sized to large zooplankters, like daphnia, which are more effective grazers on phytoplankton (e.g. shapiro & wright 1984; carpenter et al. 1987). planktivorous ﬁsh also accelerate recycling of nu- trients and thereby algal production, but they do not load the open water column with ‘‘new’’ nutri- ents from outside of the cycle as benthivorous ﬁsh do (shapiro & carlson 1982). in lake pohjalampi the biomass of planktivorous ﬁsh has been rela- tively low compared to the biomass of benthiv- orous ﬁsh. after external nutrient loading from the nearby farms diminished, the detrivorous-benthiv- orous feeding of cyprinids may, by recycling nutri- ents from the sediment, have been an important factor fertilizing the lake. we have not measured the sediment nutrient release, and the relative sig- niﬁcance of nutrient recycling by benthivorous ﬁsh cannot be quantitatively estimated either, but our results support the conclutions of several studies emphasizing the impact of omnivorous and ben- thivorous ﬁsh on the regulation of lake pro- ductivity (e.g. mcqueen et al. 1989; mcqueen et al. 1992; horppila et al. 1998). in many cases, biot- urbation and recycling of nutrients from the sedi- ment (bottom-up effects) by cyprinids, rather than zooplanktivory, have concluded to be the main fac- tors linking ﬁsh to water quality (horppila & kai- resalo 1990; tatrai et al. 1990; van donk et al. 1990; horppila et al. 1998). resumen 1. entre los an˜os 1993 y 1996 pescamos de forma intensa el lago pohjalampi (un lago mesotro´fı´co situado al este de fin- landia). en 1996 las biomasas de las especies dominantes, ru- tilus rutilus y abramis brama, fue´ solamente del 14% y 6% res- pecto a las biomasas observadas durante la campan˜a de 1993. sin embargo, la biomasa total de pe´rcidos permanecio´ pra´ctica- mente inalterada o´ incluso aumento´ ligeramente. 2. el detrito supuso entre un 53 y un 72% en la dieta de los ciprı´nidos de todas las clases de taman˜o. las algas verdes ﬁla- mentosas y pedazos de macro´ﬁtos fueron tambie´n importantes en la dieta de r. rutilus. la dieta animal de los ciprı´nidos con- sistio´ basicamente en invertebrados bento´nicos; cantidades no- tables de zooplancton fueron consumidas solamente por los in- dividuos pequen˜os de r. rutilus. tanto zooplancton como pu- pas de quirono´midos dominaron la dieta de los ejemplares pequen˜os de p. ﬂuviatilis, mientras que los individuos de mayor taman˜o se alimentaron esencialmente de peces juveniles. 3. durante el perı´odo de estudio, la proporcio´n de inver- tebrados bento´nicos en la dieta total de los peces disminuyo´ de un 57 a un 36%, mientras que la proporcio´n de zooplancton aumento´ de un 31 a un 56%. al mismo tiempo, aumento´ el nu´mero de peces juveniles plantı´voros. ası´, el objeto de preda- cio´n cambio´ de invertebrados bento´nicos a zooplancton debido a cambios en la estructura de la poblacio´n. 4. al comienzo del estudio la cantidad de detrito consumido por los ciprı´nidos fue de 620 kg ha»1 an˜o»1, pero la intensa actividad pesquera lo hizo disminuir en un 82%. en consecuen- cia, al reciclar nutrientes del sedimento, la alimentacio´n detritrı´- vora-bento´nica de los ciprı´nidos se convierte en un importante factor en el balance de nutrientes en el lago. acknowledgments we thank all those who helped us with the ﬁeld work as well as drs. ismo holopainen, jukka horppila and hannu huuskon- en for useful comments on the manuscript;
