(1989), but most studies report two (jonsson & jonsson 2001). these two forms are generally characterised as: doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00387.x 39 gallagher & dick (i) a smaller epibenthic zoobenthivore, and (ii) a larger pelagic dwelling consumer of either zooplankton or other ﬁsh including conspeciﬁcs (grifﬁths 1994; jonsson & jonsson 2001). nitrogen stable isotope (d15n) analysis has been used to determine the trophic status organisms in a foodweb (minagawa & wada 1984; mccarthy et al. 2004). carbon stable isotope (d13c) values reﬂect the carbon sources of the diet (hobson & welch 1992; vander zanden et al. 1997; power et al. 2002) and both stable isotopes complement stomach content analysis. stable isotopes (peterson & fry 1987; power et al. 2007) and parasites (curtis 1984; knudsen et al. 1996, 2004) provide useful information on the diet of an organism over a longer term (several months to >1 year). and trucatus the value of parasites in ﬁsh trophic studies is that many are transmitted in the diet. for example, the tapeworms diphyllobothrium ditremum, d. dendriti- cum, eubothrium salvelini, proteocephalus longicollis and the nematode philonema agubernaculum are transmitted by copepods, the acanthocephalan neo- echinorhynchus pungitius by ostracods, and the tape- worm cyathocephalus trematode crepidostomum farionis by amphipods (hoffman 1999). larval tapeworms of diphyllobothrium spp. are transmitted paratenically by piscivory. diphyllo- bothrium spp. procercoids are transmitted to ﬁsh when infected copepods are eaten. in the ﬁsh, this infective stage transforms into a plercercoid that encysts primarily along the intestinal wall and ⁄ or the liver where it can live for several years. plercercoids from smaller ﬁsh are transmitted to larger ﬁsh by piscivory where they encyst again and remain as plerocercoids until the ﬁsh is eaten by a bird. these plerocercoids are a good indicator of trophic level as they are long lived and their numbers accumulate overtime in piscivorous ﬁsh. parasites have been used to differentiate forms and elucidate trophic status in arctic char (fransden et al. 1989; knudsen et al. 1997; hammar 2000). no studies have examined arctic char trophic structure using stable isotopes, diet and parasites together, although these three methods have been used by johnson et al. (2004) for yellow perch (perca ﬂaves- cens). seasonal variation in the diets of arctic char is poorly understood but summer and winter diets have been reported by knudsen et al. (1997), svenning et al. (2007) and amundsen et al. (2008). diet studies of arctic char often focus on cannibalism (polis 1988; amundsen 1994) as it has an effect on population dynamics, predator energetics and the density of char as prey (claessen et al. 2000; persson et al. 2004; bystrom 2006). most reports on cannibalism are from data collected from european lakes where arctic char is the only ﬁsh species present. the examination of 40 cannibalism in lakes with ﬁsh species, in addition to char, has received less attention (see amundsen 1994). the objectives of this study were to examine a population of landlocked arctic char from the cana- dian arctic (iqalugaajuruluit lake) to (i) characterise the population structure and infer length and age of sexual maturity, (ii) describe diet and parasites among size classes in summer and winter samples, (iii) describe the trophic characteristics of arctic char using stable isotopes, food and parasites, and (iv) examine piscivory ⁄ cannibalism in a lake also populated by ninespine stickleback (pungitius pungitius). material and methods study site iqalugaajuruluit lake (63°41¢n, 68°22¢w) is a small (119 ha) freshwater lake situated near the coast of frobisher bay and is located 10 km southeast of iqaluit, bafﬁn island, canada. the lake has a maxi- mum depth of 18 m with a single small creek ﬂowing into and draining the lake. a more detailed description of the lake is found in dick et al. (2009). the only ﬁsh species inhabiting the lake are landlocked arctic char and ninespine stickleback. the char population from the same lake was examined by curtis (1984) who studied infection by the parasitic cestodes diphyllo- bothrium spp. sample collection and processing arctic char were collected using 60 m long sinking and pelagic experimental multiple mesh gill nets with 10 m panels of 12.7, 38.1, 63.5, 88.9, 114.3 and 139.7 mm mesh (manufactured by lundgrens fiskr- edskapsfabrik, stockholm, sweden). gill net sampling occurred in 2004 during winter (n = 4 sets) (february 3–4) and summer (n = 17 sets) (july 14–16). winter gill nets sets were in 3–11.5 m of water and summer gill net sets 2–15 m of water. fish were also sampled in the littoral margins of the lake using a smith-root backpack electroﬁsher during the summer (july 13–14 and august 22–23). all specimens were frozen shortly after capture. sagittal otoliths were removed in the laboratory and viewed with the aid of a dissecting microscope and aged according to nordeng (1961). fish were mea- sured for fork length (±1 mm) and weighed (±1 g). the sex of the ﬁsh and weight of the gonads were also recorded for ﬁsh >40 mm. the sex of small char was identiﬁed by examining the gonads under a dissecting microscope. a piece of tissue was removed from the epaxial muscle, placed in tinfoil and dried for 48 h in an oven at 70 °c prior to stable isotope analysis. stomach contents from a subsample were examined and insects, arachnids, crustaceans and molluscs were identiﬁed to order or family while ﬁsh as diet items were identiﬁed to species with the aid of a dissecting microscope. if decomposition was too advanced, the presence of the taxonomic group was recorded while samples with unidentiﬁed ﬁsh were recorded as such. the pros and cons of freezing and thawing ﬁsh sample for parasite studies was reviewed by pence et al. (1988) and the conclusion was that it is not a problem. the mouth, opercula, esophagus, heart, stomach, pyloric caecae, intestine divided into fore-, mid- and hindgut, liver, spleen and body cavity were examined for each ﬁsh. the gills and mesentery tissue were also examined. parasites were identiﬁed to species and enumerated, and a subsample was ﬁxed and stained for veriﬁcation. stable isotope analysis d13c and d15n isotopic analyses on the muscle (protein) were accomplished by continuous ﬂow ion ratio mass spectrometry (cf-irms) using a gv- instrumentsò isoprime attached to a peripheral tem- perature controlled eurovectorò elemental analyzer (ea) (university of winnipeg isotope laboratory, uwil). one mg samples of freeze dried ﬁsh muscle were loaded into tin capsules and placed in the ea auto-sampler in accompaniment with internally cali- brated carbon ⁄ nitrogen standards [pharma and casein proteins: d13c = )22.95% and )26.98% vienna pee- dee belemnite (vpdb); d15n = 5.00% and 5.94% air, respectively]. carbon and nitrogen isotope results are expressed using standard delta (d) notation in units per mil (&). the delta values of carbon (d13ccell) and nitrogen (d15ncell) represent deviations from a standard, such that: dsample ¼ ½ðrsample=rstandardþ   1  103 where r is the 13c ⁄ 12c or 15n ⁄ 14n ratio in the sample and the standard. the standards used for carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses are vpdb and iaea-n-1 (iaea, vienna), respectively. analytical precision, determined from the analysis of duplicate samples, was ±0.16% for d13c and ±0.18% for d15n. accuracy was obtained through the analysis of laboratory standards used for calibra- tion of results. trophic structure of landlocked arctic char from the winter it provided additional and 400+ mm) and summer samples. the prevalence and mean intensity (mar- golis et al. 1982) of each parasite species among size classes in both sampling seasons was also determined. while we realise the limitations of the it was calculated for gonadosomatic index (gsi) each ﬁsh as information supporting separation of char into immature and mature categories. gsi¼ weight of gonads/(total weight of fish100þ: gonadosomatic index of females and males was plotted against length and age to infer the length and age of maturity. maturity was estimated based on gsi values that were ‡2% for females and males (hunter 1970). fulton’s condition factor (ricker 1975): total weight  105=length3 was also calculated for all ﬁsh. due to the broad range of sizes in the sample, analysis of covariance was used to examine for differences in weight using length (both logarithmically base 10 transformed) as a covariate to infer differences in condition factor. resource parti- tioning of arctic char from separate trophic levels between summer and winter was estimated using horn’s index of dietary overlap (horn 1966): p p p ðpij þ pikþ logðpij þ pikþ   pij log pij   r0 ¼ 2 log 2 pik log pik j, and pik resources used by level where r0 is the index of dietary overlap between levels j and k, pij is the proportion of resource i of total is the proportion of resource i of total resources used by level k. mean length-at-age was plotted and curves were ﬁtted with a logarithmic trend line. a mann– whitney u-test was used to determine if there were signiﬁcant differences in the level of diphylloboth- rium spp. infection between trophic levels, and immature and mature arctic char. all statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows v. 11.0.1 (spss inc 2001) and the data were examined to determine assumptions of test were met and transformed if each statistical required. the if results population characteristics data analysis the frequency of occurrence of each diet item (%

were absent from the sample. the majority of char captured by electroﬁsh- ing in the littoral areas were <100 mm and £1 year old (fig. 1). yoy char captured in august ranged between 29 and 56.7 mm (mean = 39.2 mm). sexual maturity was inferred by gsi data (not for char captured during the summer, as shown) maturing gonads were observed in the summer sample. the minimum length and age of maturity for females was approximately 150 mm and 5–6 years, respectively, as indicated by the signiﬁcant increase in gsi. all male char (65.1–656 mm) had a gsi < 0.7%, although the timing of sample collection may account for this result. no female char ‡300 mm (n = 18) or ‡11 years (n = 11) were in spawning condition in the year sampled. stable isotopes stable isotopes data were collected from

different from the lower trophic level (f1,95 = 0.49, p > 0.05), indicating that the carbon source was from the lower trophic level. the d15n of higher trophic level char ranged from 13.99% to 16.33% with a mean enrichment of 4.01%. one ﬁsh (347 mm and 9 years old) appeared to be intermediate between both trophic levels (d13c: )19.56%, d15n: 13.22%). the lower trophic level consisted of juvenile and adult arctic char ranging in length from 29 mm to 390 mm and in age from yoy to 13 years with an average condition factor of 0.94. these ﬁsh were found in both modes of the length and age frequency distributions, although predominantly (96.9%, n = 95) in the in the lower mode. length-at-age of char from the lower trophic level was less than for char from the higher trophic level but there was overlap between both groups (fig. 3). the higher trophic level demon- strated a higher coefﬁcient of variation (161.5%) than the lower (29.8%). pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient demonstrated

(f1,112 = 9.99, p < 0.05). a greater positive correla- tion (r = 0.59, p < 0.05) between length and d15n was detected in higher trophic level char. multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated no statistically signiﬁcant differences in d13c and d15n among similar size classes between the summer and winter samples (f1,96 = 1.95 p > 0.05, wilk’s lamb- da = 0.15). female arctic char with gsi ‡ 2% were only found in the lower trophic level while none were present in the higher trophic level. approximately 72% of females greater than the minimum age and length of maturity had gsi values <2%. trophic structure of landlocked arctic char the stomach of a 568 mm char. large char (300– 399 mm) consumed mostly ninespine stickleback and insects from the order trichoptera (caddisﬂy larvae) in the summer, and consumed mostly ninespine stickle- back and chironomid larvae in the winter. winter samples of char 300 to >400 mm in length fed on similar food items (table 1). empty stomachs were more common during the winter relative to summer among most comparable size classes (table 1). differences were observed in stomach contents between lower and higher trophic level char (table 1). char from the lower trophic level had a greater number of diet items (n = 15) than char from the higher trophic level (n = 4). the diet of lower trophic level char had a high frequency of occurrence of chironomid larvae (55.6%) and unknown insect remains (34.3%) plus a small frequency of ninespine stickleback (3.0%) and char (2.0%). arctic char from the higher trophic level fed predominantly on nine- spine stickleback (35.3%) and conspeciﬁcs (17.6%). chironomids were also detected in the stomachs of higher trophic level char (17.6%), although only in the winter. higher trophic level char had an increased frequency of occurrence of empty stomachs among comparable size classes (35.3%), particularly during the winter, while those with stomach contents all had ﬁsh remains (table 1). horn’s index indicated little overlap between the diets of lower and higher trophic arctic char, although overlap was greater during [r0 = 0.342 (0.03–1.16 90% ci)] winter than in summer [r0 = 0.029 (0.00–0.506 90% ci)]. although sample size is small, no signiﬁcant differences in weight were observed between canni- balistic and noncannibalistic individuals among char from the higher (f1,14 = 1.38, p > 0.05) and lower (f1,184 = 1.55, p > 0.05) trophic levels. diet parasites fifteen diet item types were recovered from 219 arctic char from iqalugaajuruluit lake (table 1). the num- ber of diet items was less in winter than in summer. for example, chironomid larvae (order diptera) were present in the stomach of all sizes classes of arctic char from the winter sample but only found in char up to 199 mm in the summer sample. during the summer, crustaceans (copepoda, cladocera and ostracoda) were common in the stomachs of char and absent from stomachs in the winter sample. ninespine stickleback or conspeciﬁcs were also found in the diet in both seasons in most size classes of char. smaller char (30– 199 mm) had mostly invertebrates in their stomachs but ninespine stickleback and arctic char were found in the stomachs of a 65 mm char (1 year old), 79 mm (2 years old), and 195 mm char (10 years old). the only intact arctic char (131 mm) was collected from nine freshwater species of parasites were recovered from 279 arctic char: ﬁve cestodes, one trematode, one acanthocephalan, one nematode and one crusta- infections by d. ditremum and cean (table 2). d. dendriticum plerocercoids larvae were highest in char >300 mm in the winter and >200 mm in the summer. both e. salvelini and p. longicollis were recovered from most size classes of arctic char while c. truncuatus was recovered from only one large ﬁsh. the trematode c. farionis was found in all size classes, but was most abundant in larger char collected during the winter. the acanthocephalan n. pungitius was recovered, in low numbers, from all size classes of arctic char. the greatest difference between the lower and higher trophic levels was the number of encysted diphyllobothrium spp. the combined

as high as the lower trophic level (52.5%) (u = 5.5, p < 0.05) (table 2). there was a signiﬁcant, positive correlation detected between diphyllobothrium spp. and d15n (r = 0.80, p < 0.05). there was also a signiﬁcant, positive correlation detected between diphyllobothrium spp. and age (r = 0.70, p < 0.05). the mean intensity increased dramatically in arctic char from the higher trophic level as some ﬁsh were infected with >1000 diphyllobothrium spp. plerocercoids, which were mostly encysted in the stomach wall. mature arctic char had a signiﬁcantly lower abundance of diphyllo- (u = 647, bothrium spp. p < 0.05). no signiﬁcant correlation was found between condition factor and diphyllobothrium spp. levels in char. among infected ﬁsh in the lower trophic level, the number of diphyllobothrium spp. plerocerc- oids ranged from 0 to 163. an average of 0.18 diphyllobothrium spp. plerocercoids were detected in arctic char that were vulnerable to predation (£131 mm). higher numbers of e. salvelini, n. pungitius and salmincola edwardsi were also observed in char from the higher trophic level. immature than char associations among stable isotope, diet and parasites the relationship of trophic level (lower and higher), diet (piscivory and nonpiscivory) and parasites (log10 1 + x diphyllobothrium spp.) over time was exam- ined by plotting these variables against char

were excluded because it was not known if they belonged to the lower or higher trophic level. all higher trophic level char with food in their stomachs were piscivorous and some lower trophic level char also had ﬁsh in their stomachs. level of abundance of diphyllobothrium spp. generally increased with ﬁsh age, especially for char in the higher trophic level. the number of diphyllobothrium spp. among the lower trophic level nonpiscivorous arctic char was low and, excluding the single outlier (age 9), were <50 (log1050 = 1.7). analysis of vari- ance demonstrated that both trophic levels signi- ﬁcantly differed in the infection of diphyllobothrium spp. among nine-year-old char (f1,13 = 31.0, p < 0.05) but age classes 8 and 10 did not show overlap. the abundance of diphyllobothrium spp. among lower trophic arctic char aged 4–8 with ﬁsh remains in the stomachs was consistently higher, ranging from 24 to 125 plerocercoids, than char with only invertebrates in their stomachs (wilcoxon rank- sum test, w = 990, p < 0.05) (fig. 4). the lowest numbers of diphyllobothrium spp. for piscivorous 4-year-olds, were similar to the highest values among 9-year-old char. these four to nine year-old char, among the largest in their age class (see fig. 3), had ﬁve of the six samples with d15n values, ranging from 11.0 to 12.2%. their stomach contents comprised ninespine stickleback or unidentiﬁable ﬁsh remains. piscivorous trophic level char were also observed in char aged 2 (79 mm), 9 (185 mm), 10 (195 mm) and 13 (390 mm) years but differed from other lower trophic level piscivorous char by lower numbers (0–4) of diphyllobothrium spp. conspeciﬁcs were recovered from two of these char from summer and winter samples while the stomachs of two other char, from the summer and winter, contained ninespine stickleback. lower an arctic char with a d15n value of 13.22%, intermediate between the lower and higher trophic levels harboured 339 diphyllobothrium spp. pleroc-

indicate ﬁsh with identiﬁable arctic char remains in the stomach. asterisks indicate lower trophic piscivorous char that have a greater length-at-age, diphyllobothrium spp. abundance and d15n compared

nets apart from the age 2 sample. 46 discussion size structure the size structure of the population from our study is similar to that described by curtis (1984). the bimodal distribution of char collected with gill nets is well documented in the literature (grifﬁths 1994; hammar 2000). the reasons for this biomodality were discussed by johnson (1976) and finstad et al. (2003). the importance of ﬁshing gear is illustrated by our observation that experimental gill nets used in this study did not catch char smaller than 58.9 mm even though ninespine sticklebacks (43.5–62.7 mm) were caught by the 10 mm mesh. electroﬁshing was the only way that the smaller sized char could be collected within inshore cobble and boulder habitats and indicates how important this habitat is to small char. sexually mature individuals were only found in char from the lower trophic level and char with high numbers of diphyllobothrium spp. plerocercoids did not reach sexual maturity. these observations agree with curtis (1984) and hammar (2000) who reported that high levels of diphyllobthrium spp. affected reproduction in arctic char. stable isotopes the d15n stable isotope values separated char into two trophic levels beginning at 8 years of age (fig. 4). combined data from diets and parasites revealed that six char, as young as 4 years, assigned to the lower trophic level based on stable isotopes, were piscivorous, and relative to others in their age class were larger, harboured greater numbers of diphyllobothrium spp., had higher d15n values and a greater (figs 3 and 4). stable isotopes results did not place these ﬁsh in the trophic level as d15n values (9.9–12.3%) higher were not elevated because their diets also contained invertebrates. an exception was one two-year-old piscivorous char with a low d15n value, nine- spine stickleback in its stomach and no encysted diphyllobothrium spp. length-at-age diets there were consistent differences in diets between the lower and higher trophic level char and between char sampled in summer and winter. both large and small char consumed signiﬁcant amounts of chironomids during summer and winter, a ﬁnding that is similar to that reported by svenning et al. (2007). furthermore, most of the common summer diet items were absent from the winter samples, with the exception of chironomids and ﬁsh. we agree with svenning et al. (2007) and amundsen et al. (2008) that to understand food utilization in small arctic lakes we need more seasonal char feeding data. undoubtedly char feed in the winter under the ice and the importance of chironomids in their year round diet is unequivocal. still to be determined is how char feed in the absence of light and their growth rate, if any, during the winter. trophic structure of landlocked arctic char parasites numerous the arctic char parasite community was dominated by zooplankton transmitted parasites, indicating that char consumed infected copepods (hoffman 1999). the dendriticum and most d. ditremum, were transmitted by copepods and paratenically through ninespine stickleback and char as a result of piscivory (curtis 1984; fransden et al. 1989; hammar 2000). cestodes, d. we note differences between our study on parasite species recovered and the parasite list reported by curtis (1984) but it is not due to methods as curtis (1984) also used frozen samples. further, the absence in the diet of intermediate hosts of several parasite species present in char needs to be reviewed. since n. pungitius is a parasite of the ninespine stickleback, older char likely acquired the parasite by feeding on ninespine stickleback while younger char acquired the parasite from infected ostracods in their diet (t. dick, unpublished data). signiﬁcant numbers of e. salvelini and p. longicollis were only found in stomachs of char <200 mm. interestingly, svenning et al. (2007) found that char >15 cm fed on copepods in october but not during november-march or august. by contrast char <200 mm, fed on copepods during july and august. clearly there are differences among lakes and between continents in feeding patterns but terms of char the study by svenning et al. (2007) provides a complete year round study on char feeding. since prevalence and intensity of e. salvelini and p. longicollis were highest in the winter samples for both lower and higher trophic level char (table 2) it is likely that the high infections of e. savelini and p. longicollis are due to char, especially larger ones, feeding on copepods during the late fall. from our study, piscivory and cannibalism larger and that can be piscivorous it is apparent from our data that very young arctic char char (>300 mm) during the winter are more likely to be cannibals. cannibalism in higher trophic level arctic char only occurred among char ‡13 years of age (fig. 3) but these char also consumed ninespine stickleback. there was no evidence that young char consumed conspeciﬁcs but some did consume nine- spine stickleback. interestingly, svenning et al. (2007) found that cannibalism occurred at similar frequency among seasons in arctic char >15 cm although there were no ninespine stickleback in the lake. by contrast, cannibalism by char in iqalugaajuruluit lake was reduced during the summer and may relate to the observation that large char frequently made forays into shallow water where most of the ninespine stickleback 47 gallagher & dick were found (dick et al. 2009). by contrast, during the winter, the inshore shallow areas are inaccessible to char due to ice and the frequency of conspeciﬁcs in the diet of char increased. increased cannibalism may be a result of greater intraspeciﬁc competition (grifﬁths 1994) and data from iqalugaajuruluit lake suggest that dietary overlap of both trophic levels of arctic char is greatest during the winter. piscivory ⁄ cannibalism occurred in char from iqalugaajuruluit lake irrespective of long-term lower trophic afﬁliation. for example, two older char (10 and 13 years) with low diphyllobothrium spp. numbers (1–4) and low d15n values had conspeciﬁcs detected in their stomachs. the advantage for some char to shift to a higher trophic level was mixed as the shift did not enhance reproduction but char condition improved. further, a trophic shift was not ﬁxed by age or size. for example, some char that shifted to a higher trophic level were not as large as the largest char in the lower trophic level but were more heavily parasitised, had higher d15n values and did not have mature gonads. associations among stable isotopes, diet and parasites and trophic status stable isotopes, diet and parasites provided methods for determining trophic characteristics of arctic char from iqalugaajuruluit lake with each revealing differ- ences in the timing of feeding on diet items. stable isotopes revealed long-term dietary patterns while a char that switched feeding to a different trophic level for a short time would not demonstrate signiﬁcant changes in stable isotopes signatures, particularly for animals with low metabolic and growth rates (hesslein et al. 1993; post 2002). diet analysis is limited as it only provides a snapshot of what was recently consumed by an organism and is limited by the absence of food in the stomach but diet provides greater taxonomic resolution than stable isotopes (pinnegar & polunin 2000). parasites species compo- sition and abundance in a host provides information on trophic characteristics although some parasite species are present, seasonally (simkova et al. 2005; knudsen et al. 2008). however, since most ﬁsh parasites have an annual cycle they are usually present as immature or mature individuals and reﬂect diet the intermediate host). diphyllobothrium spp. is unique as the plerocercoids are long lived and are parateni- cally transmitted to piscivorous char. unlike a stable isotope signature, which takes time (e.g., years in slow growing adults) to reach equilibrium in tissues such as muscle, diphyllobothrium spp. procercoids are present in the intestine as soon as an infected copepod is digested, and as cysts are a long term indictor of piscivory. it is worth noting that it is the change in numbers of diphyllobothrium spp. cysts, relative to (i.e., 48 size ⁄ age of char that is indicative of piscivory, and this will differ among lakes as it is determined by number of infected copepods, the rate and timing of consump- tion of copepods by juvenile arctic char and the frequency of piscivory ⁄ cannibalism in the population. the use of a parasite such as diphyllobothrium spp. to determine trophic characteristics plus diet analysis among age classes, improves our ability to determine a threshold level for piscivory. stable isotopes, diet and parasites (diphyllobothrium spp.) combined revealed ontogenetic changes in tro- phic characteristics of arctic char from iqalugaajuruluit lake. neither stable isotopes nor encysted parasites alone or together indicated ﬁsh in the diet of char 0–3 years old. this is not surprising considering that a pattern of accumulation for diphyllobothrium spp. could take at least two years to show up. stomach contents were the only method to unequivocally establish piscivory in these char. by contrast, for char 4–7 years old, which overlaps with the age of sexual maturity, the numbers of diphyllobothrium spp. and diet were better indicators of trophic status than stable isotopes. although some 4- to 7-year-old char adopted a higher trophic feeding strategy, these char still consumed macroinvertebrates. interestingly, for char to reveal a trophic shift by age four, based on numbers of encysted diphyllobothrium spp., piscivory had to occur earlier in life, which was observed in one and two year-old char. stable isotopes were a good predictor of trophic status for adult char (‡8 years) as our data indicates it takes up to eight years for a char to consume sufﬁcient ﬁsh to increase their d15n values to >13.22%. consequently, stable isotope, diet and parasites results were complementary for char ‡8 years old in revealing ecologically segregated arctic char. post (2002) stated that stable isotopes should be used in conjunction with other information in order to discern complex trophic resolution. we concur with post (2002) as our results reveal the advantages of examining multiple proxies (stable isotopes, diet and parasites) to elucidate the trophic characteristics of an organism. the advantage of applying the three meth- ods to the same samples was that we were able to establish that segregation into lower and higher trophic feeding strategies occurred as early as age 4, and perhaps earlier, in the ontogeny of arctic char from iqalugaajuruluit lake. acknowledgements we acknowledge
