saunders 1991; swain et al. 1991; waples 1991; fleming & gross 1992). this concern arises from the potentially deleterious effects of ecological and genetic interac- tions between hatchery and wild ﬁsh. fish reared in hatchery facilities may differ from their wild conspe- ciﬁcs for several reasons. first, ﬁsh are highly phenotypically plastic and therefore their phenotypes may be shaped considerably by the rearing environ- ment. secondly, hatchery ﬁsh could potentially differ from wild ﬁsh due to the intensity and direction of selection that differ between hatchery and natural conditions. for example, survivals in juveniles are substantially higher in the hatchery environment than in the wild. genotypes that potentially die in the wild are instead brought through the dangerous period of 388 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00150.x comparison of survival rates, growth and morphologies among brown_trout offspring selection during early juvenile stages (elliott 1989). also the spawning behaviour of sea_trout includes competition among females for suitable nesting habi- tats, female nest-preparation and male competition for spawning females. the process of artiﬁcial breeding on the other hand involves ﬁsh farmers selecting the mates. further, due to the relationship between surface area and volume of the egg, there may be an optimal egg size. reduced oxygen ﬂow due to bad gravel quality may favour smaller eggs, whereas competition may favour large eggs (pakkasmaa et al. 2001). because growth is favoured in hatcheries and because the oxygen supply is normally not a limiting factor, domestication may promote bigger offspring (peters- son & ja¨rvi 1995). releases aimed at saving populations from extinc- tion, often referred to as conservation releases, typi- cally involve the use of local brood-stock for production of stocking material. in salmonid ﬁshes, hatchery programmes are frequently used for artiﬁcial propagation of endangered wild populations. a frac- tion of the wild population is brought into captivity and their offspring are typically reared in a hatchery for a period of time before they are released into the natural habitat to mix with wild conspeciﬁcs, a practice referred to as supportive breeding (e.g., laikre & ryman 1996). the main goal of this practice is to boost the total population size without causing harmful genetic effects through introduction of exo- genous genes. in theory, supportive breeding is to be considered a temporary solution until the factors the population decline have been responsible for identiﬁed and removed. in reality, however, most supplementation programmes tend to continue without fulﬁlling the desired goals, i.e., to restore the natural productivity. for example, large rivers in sweden, supportive breeding programmes for atlantic salmon salmo_salar and brown_trout salmo_trutta have been initiated to compensate for the loss of natural production caused by hydroelectric exploitation. most of these release programmes were initiated with the primary aim of maintaining ﬁsh production and at the same time avoid negative effects that may follow introduction of nonlocal genes. in most how a female partition her resources available for egg production is thought to have important ﬁtness consequences affecting the number of surviving offspring (pakkasmaa et al. 2001). large eggs have been found to give rise to larger juveniles than smaller ones (thorpe et al. 1984) which in turn may affect juvenile growth (bagenal 1969). individuals from larger eggs may also have higher status (wankowski & thorpe 1979), reduced susceptibility to starvation and predation risk (hutchings 1991). these fac- tors together are thought to increase survival for larger eggs (fleming & petersson 2001). however, surprisingly few studies have tested these predictions in the wild. the major goal of this study was to determine whether survival rates, growth and morphologies differed among the offspring of native wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout in river dala¨lven during a 1-year ﬁeld experiment. several previous papers have studied differences between wild and hatchery ﬁsh with respect to behaviour, life history and morphology (e.g., einum & fleming 2001; weber & fausch 2002). however, no studies have included hybrid brown_trout and most studies have been conducted during a limited time (days–weeks). we were also interested to under- stand the mechanisms behind any potential effects in the ﬁeld study and therefore performed complement- ary laboratory studies. speciﬁcally, we tested the following null hypothesis: (i) survival and growth does not differ in juvenile trout between wild-born, hatch- ery and their hybrids; (ii) morphologies are similar between wild-born trout, hatchery trout and their hybrids; (i.e., activity, escalation, aggressiveness, feeding and dominance) and growth rates are similar among wild-born and hatchery trout in the laboratory. (iii) behaviour methods these studies were conducted during the period between september 1999 and september 2000 at the fishery research station at a¨ lvkarleby, central swe- den. the research station is situated on the river dala¨lven that ﬂows into the gulf of bothnia. anadro- mous ﬁshes are prevented from following their natural migration route due to the hydropower-dam at a¨ lvkarleby. both salmon and brown_trout migrating upstream are caught in a trap, and transported to a sorting hall, where they are kept and used for artiﬁcial breeding. below the dam, a natural section of the river still exists, where both trout and salmon frequently spawn during the fall. cutting of the left pelvic ﬁn marks the offspring of hatchery trout and having both pelvic ﬁns intact identiﬁes wild-born trout. a recent study by palm et al. (2003) assessed the level of gene ﬂow from hatchery to wild-born trout to be 80% per generation (with a lower conﬁdence limit of 20%). these results suggest that the reproductive success of hatchery and naturally produced trout may be quite similar in the wild, and that introgressed genes from hatchery ﬁsh largely determine the genetic characteristics of the wild stock. therefore, potential differences between hatchery and wild-born trout refer to one-generation hatchery selection. at the spawning season in 1998, 20 brown_trout females (10 wild-born and 10 hatchery) and 20 males (10 wild-born and 10 hatchery) were used to create 389 dahl et al. four different families of ‘cross-types’; hatchery female · hatchery male, hatchery female · wild-born male, wild-born female · hatchery male and wild- born female · wild-born male. these parental ﬁsh has lived 2 years as juveniles in river and has spent two to three sea-winters before returning to their home river (dahl et al. 2004). ten families of each cross-type, except for wild-born female · hatchery male where only six families were raised due to that some hatchling groups died, were included making a total of 36 full-sib families. there was no difference among the wild and hatchery parents (one-way anova; males: length: f3,30 ¼ 1.03, p ¼ 0.39; weight: f3,30 ¼ 1.0, p ¼ 0.40; females: length: f3,29 ¼ 0.55, p ¼ 0.65; weight f3,29 ¼ 1.14, p ¼ 0.35). sizes of male and female trout ranged between 1.7 and 8.5 kg (male 1.7– 8.5 kg; female 2.2–7.3 kg). these groups were reared separately in 0.5 ·1 m tanks under normal hatchery conditions. hatchery · wild-born in total 1125 nose-tagged trout were released in the stream on 6 september 1999 (for more information about this technique see jefferts et al. 1963 and bergman et al. 1968). the sizes of wild-born, hatchery (one-way anova: and hybrid trout were similar f ¼ 3,52, p ¼ 0.28; wild-born: 10.15 + 2.72 g; hatch- ery: 10.02 + 3.67 g; wild-born · hatchery: 10.93 + 2.41 g; 8.4 + 2.38 g). the experiment was terminated during september 2000. to terminate the ﬁeld experiment, the water level was reduced in the stream, basically conﬁning the ﬁsh to their nearest pool or rifﬂe. fish in the draining rifﬂes were carefully sampled by netting. fish in the pools were also caught by netting, after gradual emptying using a submerged pump. the pools were also electrochocked to ﬁnd the remaining trout. all ﬁsh were then transported back to the hatchery where they were killed and the nose tags were recovered. the stream, which was constructed in 1994, is situated downstream the dam of the hydroelectrical power station at a¨ lvkarleby. a tube from the dam supplies the stream with river water (by gravity). the length of the stream is 110 m, including one wolf trap at the upper end and one at the lower end of the stream. the total area of the stream is 345 m2. the wolf traps are solid constructions made of concrete and all water runs through the traps. a system of stainless gratings led the ﬁsh to a collection tank. the mesh in the inlet was 1 · 1 mm2 and in the outlet 20 · 4 mm2. hence trout fry could not escape the stream, nor can any ﬁsh invade the system (see johnsson et al. 1999 for a picture of the stream). during the experiment, the adjustable water ﬂow was set to its maximum, 150 l)1 and no extreme hydro- logical events occurred. morphometric measurements were obtained on all remaining trout with a digital camera and analysed 390 with image analysis software. viewing the trout from the side we digitised all our morphological characters. morphometric measurements included fork length (1), height behind gills (2), height before dorsal ﬁn (3), height in front of anal ﬁn (4), caudal pendicule height (5), eye diameter (6), snout-dorsal ﬁn length (7), length snout-anal ﬁn (8), snout-jaw length (9), head length (10), length of the left pectoral ﬁn (11) and width of caudal ﬁn (12) (see fig. 1). as a mechanistic test to ﬁnd out whether potential differences seen in the ﬁeld experiment were due to social interactions we conducted an indoor experi- ment. the experiment determined whether there were any differences between wild-born and hatchery trout with respect to aggressiveness, growth, activity and food intake. at the spawning season in 1999, 20 brown_trout females (10 wild-born and 10 hatchery) and 20 males (10 wild-born and 10 hatchery) were used to create families. the eggs of half of the families were further divided into two batches, giving rise to a total of 60 groups. these groups were reared sepa- rately in 0.5 · 1 m tanks under normal hatchery conditions. the juveniles from these groups were used in the experiments. this experiment was repeated at four different times (august 2000, september 2000, january 2001 and march 2001). in total 24 replicates were made. in each replicate 12 ﬁsh were used, originating from 12 different families (i.e., six ﬁsh with either wild-born or hatchery origin). the ﬁsh were randomly sampled, which means that they were not matched for size. initial ﬁsh weight was on average august 2000: hatchery 3.71 + 1.55 g, wild-born 3.92 + 1.38 g; september 2000: hatchery 6.50 + 2.63 g, wild-born 5.32 + 1.7; january 2001: hatchery 14.58 + 6.08, wild-born 13.18 + 5.52; march 2001: hatchery 16.51 + 6.25, wild-born 12.78 + 4.74. there was a signiﬁcant difference in ﬁsh weight in september 2000 (paired t-test; t ¼ 2.24, d.f. ¼ 70, p ¼ 0.03) and march 2001 (t ¼ 2.85, d.f. ¼ 70, p ¼ 0.006), whereas no differ- (t ¼ 0.63, d.f. ¼ 70, ence was found in august p ¼ 0.53) d.f. ¼ 70, (t ¼ 1.02, p ¼ 0.31). each ﬁsh was freeze branded dorsally (using a metal rod chilled in liquid nitrogen) with one of 12 different combinations of dots, allowing january and fig. 1. location of the morphometric landmarks used. winans (1984) and hedenskog et al. (1997) described all landmarks in detail. comparison of survival rates, growth and morphologies among brown_trout offspring individuals to be distinguished during the experiment. the aquarium used were plastic tanks, 82 · 56 cm, water depth 11 cm, the current was on average )1. sides and bottom were grey coloured and 3 cmæs no stones, gravel and sand were used. six such aquariums were used simultaneously. each aquarium had its own water inlet, i.e., they were not in contact with each other via water ﬂow. the food consisted of frozen chironomid larvae (about 1% per body weight and day). in the upstream part of the aquarium seven holes (diameter 2 mm) were drilled in the wall. the water entered the experimental part of the aquarium through these holes. in a small mesh cage outside the wall, covering the holes, the larvae were placed immediately before each observation period. the larvae then thawed and were ﬂushed into the aquar- ium, often in bundles of ﬁve to 10 larvae that fairly quick become distributed over the entire aquarium. foddering was done in two ways; ﬁsh were fed either in a ‘predictable’ way, i.e., the same amount of food was given at each feeding occasion, or in an ‘unpre- dictable’ way, i.e., the amount of food varied between feeding occasions. each replicate lasted for 13 days and each aquarium was observed on nine of those days, two times a day (10 min per observation period). the outcomes of the aggressive interactions were used to calculate dominance indices (approximately the ﬁghting ability, following boyd & silk 1983). this index gives low values to dominant individuals and high values to subordinates. we also noted the type of ﬁghting behaviour to get information of escalation levels during the agonistic interactions. six types of ﬁghting behaviour were noted: display (both lateral and frontal), circling, charge, ram, chase and bite. for closer description of these behaviours, see johnsson et al. (1996), ho¨jesjo¨ et al. (1998) and petersson & ja¨rvi (2000). display, circling, chase and charge do not involve physical contact between the interacting individuals, whereas chase may and ram and bite always involve physical contact. the last three types of ﬁghting behaviour were regarded as ‘escalated’ and the escalation level was calculated as the proportion of initiated interaction that ended with any of these three behaviours. five levels of activity were noted; holding low, holding high, swimming, feeding and ﬁghting (see petersson & ja¨rvi 2000 for a closer description of these behaviours). activity level was calculated as the proportion of observation time the ﬁsh was not holding low. statistics all data were log-transformed using systat (wilk- insson 1992, systat for windows version 5. systat, evanston, usa). we did not have individual weight on trout the that were released into the stream at beginning of the experiment. however, we had initial mean weight of juveniles from each family and we therefore analysed mean family survival and growth. survival was calculated by subtracting number of stocked ﬁsh with number of surviving individuals for each family. the effect of growth rates and survival was then tested with one-way anova. as some individuals were caught in the wolf traps during the experiment, we analysed both trout remaining in the stream and the total of surviving trout. morphological measurements were conducted after the experiment was terminated and the remaining individuals were standardised for length. allometric adjustment was performed using the residuals from the regression of log (trait) on log (length). these residuals were then analysed in a discriminant analy- sis. the data were classiﬁed using jack-kniﬁng to prevent bias from classiﬁcation of individuals used to derive the discriminant function. this analysis provi- ded an overall multivariate measure of the ability to distinguish wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout based on morphological characters. classiﬁcation success was assessed by comparing the mean per cent of correct classiﬁcation with the per cent expected under random classiﬁcation conditions. because the laboratory data used for the analyses were not normally distributed and also showed heteroscedasticity (see fig. 3) parametric anova could not be performed. instead we used scheirer– ray–hare extension of the kruskal–wallis test (sokal & rolhf 1995) for the speciﬁc growth rate and the behavioural data. the values for each variable in each trial were ranked and the mean rank for each strain (wild-born or sea-ranched) in all experimental groups was calculated. these mean values (n ¼ 48) were used in the analyses. there were few differences between trial (season) in the analysed variables and we therefore pooled the trials in the analyses. however, signiﬁcant interactions between trial and food regime for number of food item eaten and between trial and strain for growth rate were found, which is presented in results section. speciﬁc growth rate in mass (gm) was calculated from gm ¼ 100[(ln w2)ln w1)(t2)t1) )1], where w1 and w2 are the masses at times t1 and t2, respectively (days). as growth rate is well known to exhibit an allometric relation, growth rates were adjusted using the growth model of elliott & hurley (1995), in which adjusted growth gadj ¼ gm+(b ln wg)-(b ln(wa), where b is a constant (0.308 for brown_trout), wg the geometric mean body mass of individual ﬁsh prior and after growth period and wa the body mass growth adjusted to the mean initial mass used. we also studied parental inﬂuence on juvenile performance in the ﬁeld experiment. some life history traits of parental ﬁsh are always noted during the 391 dahl et al. course of artiﬁcial breeding. for females total body weight and length before and after stripping, as well as date of ovulation are always noted. average egg size of each female used for breeding is always assessed by counting the number of eggs needed to reach 25 cm, which is a traditional method used in sweden and norway. stripping is a rough method to determine ﬁsh fecundity, the number of eggs left behind after stripping varies from a few to several hundred. at the hatchery in a¨ lvkarleby on average 90% of the females eggs are recovered. however, we assume that this effect is random. in this study we only used egg size and as egg size has a very low variability among single females (1–2%, petersson & ja¨rvi 1995), the problems with remaining eggs after stripping is of minor importance. for males, total body length and weight were recorded. effects of egg size on juvenile performance were analysed with t-tests and linear regressions. results in total, 1125 trout were released in the stream and when the experiment was terminated, a total of 614 individuals had been recovered. of those remaining, 368 individuals were caught in the stream and 246 in the wolf traps. total survival rates did not differ among our four groups (one-way anova: f3,29 ¼ 0.07, p ¼ 0.98) and survival was also similar among groups of the remaining trout in the stream (one-way anova: f3,29 ¼ 0.18, p ¼ 0.65; fig. 2a). growth rates were also similar among groups in total number of trout (one-way anova: f 3,29 ¼ 0.55, p ¼ 0.65) and in those remaining in the stream (one-way anova: f3,29 ¼ 0.50, p ¼ 0.70; fig. 2b). for both sexes, discriminant factor analyses did not discriminate very well among morphological charac- ters between wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout. for females, 38% were classiﬁed into the right category and for males 36% were classiﬁed into right group. for females and males analysed together 32% were classiﬁed into right category. this was only about 12% better than random classiﬁcation. this suggests that there are very small (if any) morphological differences between wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout after 1 year in the stream. and 0.05 g/experimental the average growth in the laboratory study ranged between )0.05 period (12 days). comparisons between wild-born and hatch- ery brown_trout showed an effect in speciﬁc growth rate and an interaction in escalation between food interval and strain (table 1, fig. 3). the interaction is probably explained by the large variation in the wild- born trout that received food in an unpredictable way. the effect of food items eaten was just an effect of that individuals receiving food in an unpredictable way had 392 (a) 1.0 l a v i v r u s 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 (b) 140 ) g ( h t w o r g 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 hatchery wild hatch. + w w + hatch. hatchery wild hatch. + ww + hatch. treatment fig. 2.

fig. 4). this interaction was perhaps due to that the feeding rate was higher during the ﬁrst and last trial, making it hard to score all feeding attempts in the tanks having unpredictable feeding attempts. thus, the number of eaten items in those tanks might have been underestimated. this is supported by the fact that the growth rate did not differ between the two feeding regimes. there was also a signiﬁcant interaction between trial (season) and strain for growth rate (v2 ¼ 12.76, p ¼ 0.025; fig. 5). this comparison of survival rates, growth and morphologies among brown_trout offspring table 1. result from the nonparametric anova (scheirer–ray–hare exten- sion of the kruskal–wallis test) on growth rate and ﬁve behavioural variables (see text for details) on brown_trout juveniles. variable activity escalation no. aggressive attacks no. food items eaten dominance index speciﬁc growth rate source of variation foddering strain foddering · strain foddering strain foddering · strain foddering strain foddering · strain foddering strain foddering · strain foddering strain foddering·strain foddering strain foddering · strain v2 0.04 1.30 0.06 1.62 1.62 4.27 0.02 0.41 1.71 8.01 0.04 0.09 0.172 2.27 0.35 0.02 10.09 0.48 p-value 0.842 0.254 0.805 0.203 0.203 0.039 0.884 0.520 0.190 0.0047 0.836 0.766 0.682 0.132 0.555 0.878 0.0015 0.489 foddering was done in two ways; ﬁsh were fed either in a ‘predictable’ way, i.e., the same amount of food were given at each feeding occasion, or in an ‘unpredictable’ way, food varied between feeding occasions. two strains were used; the juveniles were either of hatchery or wild origin. the amount of i.e., interaction was due to that juveniles having hatchery parents grew signiﬁcantly faster than juveniles having wild-born parents in the ﬁrst and second trial but not in the third and last trial. we found no initial difference in egg size among wild-born and hatchery trout (paired t-test; t ¼ 1.06, d.f. ¼ 31, p ¼ 0.30). no overall effects (all groups analysed together) were found of egg size on growth and survival at the end of the experiment (linear regression; survival: r2 ¼ 0.05, p ¼ 0.69; growth: r2 ¼ 0.04, p ¼ 0.25). when dividing the data into wild-born and hatchery origin, no effects of egg size were found on either survival or growth (linear regression; wild-born: r2 < 0.01, n ¼ 15, p > 0.86; hatchery: r2 < 0.05, n ¼ 18, p > 0.35). discussion we found no differences among wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout with respect to survival, growth and morphology in the ﬁeld experiment but some differ- ences in social interactions, feeding and activity were found in our laboratory experiments. these results contrast other studies, which have found effects of hatchery rearing on several different traits in salmo- nids. studies comparing the performance of hatchery and wild trout usually try to identify the environmental effect and/or the genetic effect. tests for environmen- tal effects compare ﬁsh, of a common origin, hatched and reared in a hatchery with wild individuals grown in nature. by contrast, tests for genetic effects compare hatchery and wild ﬁsh reared from eggs in a common environment. because tests of differences are usually conducted under artiﬁcial conditions, their value for predicting effects of interactions in the wild may be limited. this may be particularly problematic if genotype/phenotype by environment interactions exist, whereby the relative expression of traits between the two types of ﬁsh differs among environments. some studies try to control for such interactions by con- ducting tests under differing environments (hatchery and wild), yet most studies do not. any lack of correspondence between hatchery tests and data from the wild, therefore, may be partly attributable to this problem (einum & fleming 2001; weber & fausch 2002). few studies have dealt with survival and growth of native (i.e., strains with similar genetic origin) hatchery and wild-born brown_trout. in two studies that were conducted in the same stream as the present study, survival, growth and reproductive success of hatchery and wild-born brown_trout were studied (dannewitz et al. 2003 and dannewitz et al. 2004). the ﬁrst study followed the offspring of hatchery and wild-born trout, from eyed eggs until they were 1 year old (dannewitz et al. 2003) and the other study allowed hatchery and wild-born trout to spawn freely in the experimental stream and all (dannewitz offspring were collected after 1 year et al. 2004). both these studies showed that the offspring of hatchery and wild-born trout had a similar survival and growth. in this present study, both survival rates and growth were similar among the offspring of hatchery, wild-born and hybrid brown_trout. these three studies together suggests, even if they lack true replication at the stream level, that there is no difference in growth and survival in the offspring of wild-born, hatchery and hybrid brown_trout in river dala¨lven. labee-lund & langeland (1995) studied native hatchery and wild trout in a norwegian lake and found no difference in survival among wild and hatchery trout. studies comparing growth among wild and hatchery ﬁsh of different genetic origin in a variety of trout and salmon species have shown equivocal results, where some studies have found lower growth in hatchery ﬁsh (finstad & heggberget 1993), whereas others have found higher growth (kallio-nyberg & koljo- nen 1997). our laboratory studies suggested that hatchery trout had a better growth than wild trout. hatchery trout from river dala¨lven have been reported to have a higher growth potential (petersson & ja¨rvi 1995, 2000; johnsson et al. 1996; hedenskog et al. 2002). they have also been found to take more 393 dahl et al. fig. 3. boxplots for speciﬁc growth rate and ﬁve behavioural variables on brown_trout juveniles of hatchery (h) or wild-born (w) origin. the ﬁsh were fed either in a ‘pre- dictable’ way (p), i.e., the same amount of food was given at each feeding occasion, or in an ‘unpredictable’ way (u), the amount of food varied between feeding occasions. the lower and upper ends of the boxes denote the ﬁrst and third quartiles, respectively. the horizontal line within the boxes shows the median values. the bars show the ﬁrst and ninth percentiles. the dots denote the extreme values. for statis- tical tests and levels of signiﬁcance, see table 1. i.e., it is important to point out that the most critical period for juveniles is the period after emergence from the gravel (elliott 1986; einum & fleming 2000a,b). the trout in this experiment were reared in the hatchery until they weighed about 10 g, therefore, trout avoided a critical period in nature, i.e., a period of intense selection. however, a previous study conducted within the same system released eggs of wild and hatchery trout but found no difference in survival and growth between hatchery and wild brown_trout (dannewitz et al. 2003). survival after 1 year ranged between 0% and 25% among families but no difference among groups were found. this suggests that at least wild-born and hatchery trout experience similar mortality during the initial period (dannewitz et al. 2003). it is also important to remember that even if trout were exposed to heron (ardea cinera) and mink (mustela vison) during the experiment, ﬁsh predators, such as pike (esox lucius) and larger trout were absent. this could potentially have affected the survival and growth among wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout. previous studies have found it display less-pronounced physiological (2003) and dannewitz et al. risks (johnsson et al. 1996; ferno¨ & ja¨rvi 1998) and to stress responses (lepage et al. 2000) than wild ﬁsh from the same river. the reasons for these differences among laboratory and ﬁeld experiment is unclear. palm et al. (2003) suggested that there might be several reasons for these discrepancies. all previous studies have been performed in the laboratory under relatively short time periods (days–weeks) and relatively small differences seen in laboratory might diminish during long-term studies in natural systems. further, hatch- ery trout might not be able to utilise their growth potential fully when reared under natural conditions because food abundance in the wild is lower and less predictable than in the hatchery. also, is possible that observed phenotypic differences repre- sent nongenetic maternal effects (johnsson et al. 1996). this strongly suggests that results obtained from laboratory studies may not easily be extrapo- lated to natural environments. 394 comparison of survival rates, growth and

performance, and thereby its ﬁtness (arnold 1983). fish morphology is under different selection pressures, and there are clear relationships between form and function, swimming performance (robinson & wilson 1996). some studies have found differences in morphology between wild-born and hatchery trout, reared under similar so that body shape affects conditions, whereas others have not (swain et al. 1991; petersson & ja¨rvi 1995; einum & fleming 1997). in this present study, no evidence was found that wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout differed in morphology, only 38% females and 36% males were classiﬁed into the right category and this is only about 12% better than random classiﬁcation. einum & fleming (1997) found morphological differences between wild and hatchery atlantic salmon (salmo_salar). however, the farm salmon used in their study have spent their whole life cycle in captivity, and have undergone intentional selection for rapid growth and other commercial traits for many generations. it is not surprising that hatchery programmes for farming have resulted in a more pronounced divergence between the hatchery ﬁsh and their wild conspeciﬁcs than in the case for supplemental releases. in this present case, these data suggest that trout is highly plastic, where the environment predominantly determines their mor- phology, rather than any potential genetic differences among wild and hatchery ﬁsh. in the present study, there were no signs of an effect of egg size on survival and growth. einum & fleming (1999) found distinct reaction norms in the perfor- mance of juvenile brown_trout from small and large eggs. growth and survival was similar among high- quality environments but became increasingly diver- gent in poorer environments. they suggested that the existence of such reaction norms indicate that the optimal egg size varies across gradients of environ- mental qualities. following the reasoning of einum & fleming (1999), the lack of effects of egg size on survival and growth suggests that our experiment was performed in a high-quality environment, i.e., food resources were plentiful and densities of trout were not to high. overall growth ranged between 25 and 140 g after 1 year, which is high compared to other streams in the area (t. ja¨rvi, unpublished data). densities of )2, which is in the remaining trout were about 1 ﬁshæm range of natural densities (eklo¨v 1997). it is also possible that initial advantage for larger eggs disappear during juvenile’s growth. is worth noting that several of these above-mentioned studies have been conducted during a short time span (days–weeks) whereas this study lasted a year. it our studies (see also dannewitz et al. 2003 and dannewitz et al. 2004) suggest that there is only small differences (if any) in survival, growth, morphology and social interactions among wild-born, hatchery and hybrid trout in river dala¨lven. this indicates that one- generation selection is not enough to create differences among wild-born, hatchery and hybrid individuals. these results also suggest that results obtained from laboratory studies should be used with caution to predict interactions in the wild between hatchery and wild-born trout. 395 dahl et al. acknowledgements we are grateful to the staff at the fishery research station in a¨ lvkarleby, erik ahlin, elsie-marie
