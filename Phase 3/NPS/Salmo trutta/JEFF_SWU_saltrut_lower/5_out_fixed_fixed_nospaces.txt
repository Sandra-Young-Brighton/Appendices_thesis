alpine lake; fish introduction; growth; harvest introduction the catadromous european eel (anguilla anguilla) undergoes a more than 5000 km long migration from its freshwater habitats in europe and northern africa to its spawning area in the sargasso sea. the larvae drift back with the gulf stream and enter the medi- terranean sea through the strait of gibraltar (righton et al. 2012). contrasting opinions exist as to how far european eels migrate into the black sea and up the danube river. there are historical records that they were indeed caught in the upper danube before any stocking campaigns (schmidt 1909 and references therein; dekker 2003), but most authors believe that they have never occurred naturally on austrian terri- tory, except for lake constance and a small catch- ment area in the north (lainsitz river) draining into the rhine and elbe river systems respectively (balon et al. 1986; lelek 1987; berg 1988; herzig & her- zig-straschil 2001; wolfram & mikschi 2007). the majority of austrian lakes drain into the danube and hence eels could have theoretically reached them, but their appearance was never described before 1900 (e.g. heckel & kner 1858; fitzinger 1878; von dem borne 1880; gaßner 1893; wallner 1911; diem 1964; j€ager & schillinger 1988), and an early record from zellersee in 1603 remains anecdotal (gassner et al. 2003). as early as 1909 glass eels bought in northern germany were stocked in lake irrsee, and shortly afterwards had downstream reached the hitherto eel- free mondsee and attersee (haempel 1930; dumitriu 1932). as a conclusion from analysis of old catch statistics, stocking activities must have concurrently correspondence: r. schabetsberger, department of cell biology, university of salzburg, hellbrunnerstrasse 34, 5020 salzburg, austria. e-mail: robert.schabetsberger@sbg.ac.at doi: 10.1111/eff.12179 17 essl et al. occurred in wallersee, zeller see, traunsee and neu- siedler see (fitzinger 1832; haempel 1930; freudl- sperger 1936; fig. 1). on the other hand, stocking the upper danube river basin with glass eels has been well documented since the end of the 19th century (haack 1881; hofer 1897; tesch 2003, p. 95). it is assumed that from there eels migrated into other aus- trian river systems. although there is no proof, these stocked eels probably never reach their spawning area in the sargasso sea (einsele 1961; berg 1988; spindler 1997; wolfram & mikschi 2007). beginning in the early 1950s, 13 new fish species such as north american lake_trout (salvelinus na- maycush walbaum), grass carp (ctenopharyngodon idella val.) or starlet (acipenser ruthenus l.) were introduced into austrian alpine lakes to enhance commercial and recreational fisheries (zick et al. 2006). the development of new transportation meth- ods had made it easier to ship large quantities of live fish in oxygenated and cooled water tanks (berka 1986). at the same time, translocation of glass eels over long distances started on a large scale (einsele 1961). those stocked into austrian lakes originated predominantly from the french atlantic coast, had a total length of approximately 7 cm, and were not pig- mented. they were shipped in specially designed holding tanks with an oxygen supply. one kilogram of glass eels corresponds to approximately 3200 individual eels. all imports into austria were pro- cessed by the federal agency for water management in scharfling. after recovery for a few days in the local hatchery, the glass eels were stocked into numerous austrian waters. little was known about the fate of these austrian eels and their harvest. besides an early study on growth (einsele 1961), more recent investigations dealt with parasite infestations (jagsch & rydlo 1993; konecny & wais 1993; gelnar et al. 1996; schabuss et al. 2005) and with age determination in neusiedler see (paulovits & bıro 1986). the introduction of translocated and alien fish spe- cies in lakes often has detrimental effects on the native fish communities and the entire ecosystem (holcik 1991; cowx 1998; parker et al. 1999; jacob- sen et al. 2004; wolter & r€ohr 2010; cucherousset & olden 2011). eels in particular have been shown to negatively affect native fish and crayfish commu- nities (herrmann & marre 1961; sinha & jones 1975; herzig-straschil 1989; mikschi et al. 1996; cowx 1998; p€ockl & pekny 2002; zick et al. 2006). the aim of this study was the analysis of the stock- ing history of eels in austria and the assessment of growth, stock development and annual yields in selected alpine lakes. additionally, the potentially negative effects of stocked eels on native fish com- munities are discussed. fig. 1. location of the six investigated lakes fuschlsee, irrsee, mondsee, traunsee wallersee and attersee within the salzkammergut lake district. the geographical positions of lake constance (1), river lainsitz (2) and lake neusiedlersee (3) are shown on the insert. the time period of stocking and the total number of introduced eels is shown for each lake. 18 material and methods throughout the entire period of intensive stocking with glass eels (1954–1987), numbers and destina- tions were recorded at the federal agency for water management in scharfling. thus, presence/absence information was available for 39 natural austrian alpine lakes (30 north of the alps, 9 south). addi- tional information was collected from archives and by an enquiry to fisheries managers (gassner et al. 2003). data on catch per unit effort, length and weight of eels were derived from the austrian fish database (afd, sasano et al. 2009), containing results of previ- ous fisheries surveys of austrian lakes >50 ha. this database also includes historical and recent presence/ absence data on small-bodied taxa, for example min- now (phoxinus phoxinus l.), bullhead (cottus gobio l.), stone loach (barbatula barbatula l.), bleak (al- burnus alburnus l.), gudgeon (gobio gobio l.), and bitterling (rhodeus sericeus pallas). a special focus was directed on six austrian alpine lakes (fuschlsee, irrsee, mondsee, attersee, traunsee and wallersee), because data on length, weight and occurrence of european eels were avail- able for three different sampling periods (1980s- per- iod 1, 1998/1999- period 2, and 2009/2010- period 3; table 1, fig. 1). additionally, catch statistics, includ- ing yearly eel catches, were available from the fisher- ies management of nine austrian lakes (fuschlsee 1966–1999, irrsee 1979–2007, mondsee 1948–2011, traunsee 1991–2001, wallersee 1948–2003, zeller- see 1972–2006, klopeinersee 1999–2004, mattsee 1966–1999, obertrumersee 1986–1999). the six study lakes are subject to commercial fish- eries and are also used for angling (gassner et al. 2005). between may and october eels were caught by electrofishing from a boat along the shore with an 8-kw (periods 1 and 2) or 13-kw (period 3) aggre- gate. the maximum depth fished was approximately 1.5 m. during period 1, between one and three sites per lake were sampled with different effort (table 2). the surveys during periods 2 and 3 were performed on one site per square kilometre lake area for 15 min eel stocking in austrian lakes each. the starting and end points of each site were registered with gps for distance measurements. eels were stored in oxygenated tanks and full weight (5 g) and total length (0.5 cm) were measured. after that, the animals were either released or trans- ported to the fisheries manager for marketing. yearly length and weight increments were esti- mated by linear regression of mean length against time of capture (periods 1–3). catch per unit effort (cpue) was calculated as number of eels caught per hour of electro-fishing along the shoreline. data on yearly harvest are based on catch statistics from com- mercial fisheries and angling. of standing developed stocks, we for fuschlsee, irrsee, mondsee, traunsee and wal- lersee annual yield data were available. to get a sur- rogate a mechanistic individual-based simulation of stocked glass eels with cycle steps of 1 year. the ontogeny of each individual was controlled by three parameter sets, which were either iteratively sampled from a randomised normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation or predicted from allometric formulae as follows: (i) we assumed mortality rate (l, in units of deaths per 100 individualsyear  1) to scale with body mass and fitted a regression model with values taken from bevacqua et al. (2011) as to reflect a low-density stock and low water temperature (6–8°c) scenario. for example, juvenile fish (6.5 cm  1, total length) were assigned a l value of 0.18 year and average-sized individuals (30 cm) had l = 0.019 and large eels (60 cm) l = 0.0007. (ii) the maxi- mum age an individual could reach in the simulation was restricted to 40 years 2 sd. (iii) values for annual growth increment for a specific lake were found by experimentation to obtain a similar density distribution of fish length in the simulation experi- ments compared with the density distribution for the final 2000s fishing period. kruskal–wallis rank sum tests were applied to test whether location parameters of the measured and simulated size distributions can be distinguished. the relationship between total length (l) in centimetres and total weight (w) in grams was calculated using the equation w = alb. table 1. limnological and morphological characteristics

stock was then thinned according to size weighted mortality rate. we regarded predicted l as an event probability of death and used these values of probability weights for sam- pling the stock for exitus candidates. in any case, if an individual outreached the maximum obtainable age its life span expired. after death events were assigned to individuals, the standing stock was fur- ther for

before 1954 has occurred. to prevent a breakdown of the stock during the simulation cycle as induced by fishing withdrawals, this lake had to be initialised with a hypothetical stock (2000 glass eels per year beginning with the year 1908 and up 1953) that ensured to provide the documented fishing yield already starting with year 1947. results in the period between 1954 and 1987, a total of 11.9 million glass eels were imported and stocked in austrian alpine water bodies. annual imports fluctu- ated widely from zero (1956, 1977 and 1978) to 1,092,200 glass eels (1971) per year (fig. 2). peak values of more than 500,000 glass eels were observed 20 fig. 2. yearly glass eel imports into austria from 1954 to 1987. from 1964 to 1972. afterwards, from 1974 to 1980, the imports dropped. in the 1980s, the total numbers of imported glass eels decreased to below 100,000 per year and finally ceased in 1988. nearly half (48%) of the imported glass eels were put into 18 large natural, alpine lakes. twenty-three per cent of the imported glass eels were stocked into the shallow (average depth: 1.0 m) pannonian neu- siedlersee. those remaining (29%) were released in rivers, fishponds, fish farms or in a few lakes smaller than 50 ha in surface area. in several lakes, (l€angsee, irrsee, fuschlsee and wallersee) more than 500 glass eels per hectare have been stocked. the majority was introduced into lake attersee (2,190,000 glass eels). four lakes (irrsee, attersee, wallersee and mondsee) have been stocked over a period of 18 years. during period 3, eels could be detected in 56% (n = 22) of austrian natural lakes >50 ha. into four these 22 lakes (hallst€atter see, wolfgangsee, of grundlsee and toplitzsee), they must have migrated from surrounding water bodies, as there were

in irrsee and wallersee, the stock biomasses started declining in the late 1990s, but in traunsee, the turning point was reached a few years later, because the eels were pre- dominantly harvested during this decade. the actual fishing yield remained below 1.5 kgha  1 in all but one lake (wallersee, >4 kgha  1). while in mondsee, the stock is probably almost extinct by now, irrsee, traunsee and wallersee still could have contained more than 50 kgha when comparing presence/absence data of small- bodied fish taxa from the 18th century and 2010 available for 17 unstocked and 22 lakes stocked with eels, 41% (seven lakes) of the pristine and 59% (13) of lakes containing eels had lost one or more species. however, no quantitative information is available to separate effects of eel stocking, introduction and management other predatory fish (e.g. pike), habitat loss and climate change.  1 in 2010. 21 fig. 3. length frequencies of eels for the three sampling periods (period 1:

66.3  1.1 cm respectively. average lengths and weights were sig- nificantly different between the three sampling peri- ods (kruskal–wallis test, p ≤ 0.001; fig. 3). the mean annual length increment ranged from a min- imum of 0.6 cmyear  1 (mondsee), to 0.9 cmyear  1 (attersee and wallersee), 1.0 cmyear  1 (fuschlsee), 1.1 cmyear  1 and to a maximum of 1.5 cmyear  1 (traunsee). average annual length incre- ment was 1.0 cm. (irrsee), for most of the time, the harvest of eels in nine austrian alpine lakes remained (fig. 4) below 3% of the total yearly catch. only in the mesotrophic lake wallersee, it exceeded 8% during peak harvest in the 1980s over a period of 8 years. the average yearly catch for the entire time period in lake wallersee was 600 kg (max: 2.6 tons in 1986). indicate took more simulations than 15 years after first stocking to establish harvestable eel stocks (fig. 5). when comparing estimated eel biomass under observed fishing pressure to theoreti- cal stock development assuming no harvest, both val- ues differed substantially in fuschlsee and wallersee, where eels were caught on a regular basis over 4–6 decades. in irrsee intensive stocking followed by intermediate harvest resulted in a similar trend for both estimates, while they were almost congruent in traunsee, where fishing pressure was negligible. in mondsee comparatively low-stocking densities cou- pled to early harvest resulted in an overall low eel biomass. unexploited eel biomasses in fuschlsee, irr- see and wallersee could have at times theoretically that it essl et al. fig. 5. estimated eel stock development

model description. discussion due to the unique situation that almost all eel imports and stocking campaigns for the alpine lakes in austria were carried out by the federal agency for water management, we have a clear picture of the stocking history since the 1950s. at the beginning, the aim was to improve the yields of commercial fishermen and to make the lakes more attractive for anglers. glass eels were readily available and cheap (mean price of 2.75 € per kg (0.0009 € per fish) during 1970s; ices 2006). effi- cient transport technologies and high availability of glass eels made it easy to import and stock large numbers of eels. the total confirmed import was almost 12 million glass eels. 22 besides this strong effort to stock naturally eel-free austrian alpine lakes over more than 30 years, lucra- tive eel fisheries were not established. our simula- tions suggest that stocking was probably effective at least in some of the smaller lakes. in wallersee, catches did exceed two tons for a couple of years and in irrsee a higher yield could have been harvested, but overall catches remained relatively low for sev- eral reasons. eels never had a tradition in local cui- sine and hence were never valued by customers. the few professional fishermen caught eels in fyke nets or in a few cases, by electrofishing, but due to low- demand eels were only harvested infrequently and a tradition of eel fishing never developed. additionally, catches were too small to lead to a profitable export business. between the 1950s and the 1980s, the num- ber of anglers increased considerably (spindler 1997), but again eel did not become a target species. anglers kept focusing on whitefish (coregonus sp.), pike (esox lucius), and arctic charr (salvelinus_umbla; gassner et al. 2004; steyskal et al. 2009). the failure of a profitable eel fishery was also due to relatively poor growth conditions in the compara- tively cold and oligotrophic alpine lakes. yearly length increments, although just a rough estimate of growth, were five times less than reported for various lakes (paulovits & bıro temperate european eel 1986; berg 1990; nagiec & bahnsawy 1990; simon 2007). we have no information on age, but in other cold and nutrient poor, european watersheds average growth rates were similar (bisgaard & pedersen 1991; poole & reynolds 1996; daverat et al. 2012). growth of european eel is fast at optimum water temperatures from 21 to 27°c (yalcßin- €ozdilek et al. 2006), but only little or no activity of eels is observed below 13°c (vøllestad & jonsson 1986; baras et al. 1998). mean annual surface temperature in the aus- trian alpine lakes is 9.7°c (livingstone & dokulil 2001) and hence significantly below the optimal water temperature of the european eel. only between july and september, surface temperatures in the six study lakes ranged from 14.3 to 17.3°c and values above 20°c are rarely recorded (dokulil 2014). addi- tionally, the majority of lakes are oligo- to meso- trophic and food resources are probably limited (beiwl & rodinger 2010). it is still a matter of debate whether this slow growing stocked eels may attempt downstream migration from the lakes into the outflowing rivers. while some studies suggest that stocked eels are unable to recognise the outlet and remain in the lake (westin 2003; shiao et al. 2006), others found proof of downstream migration (limburg et al. 2003; ver- reault et al. 2010). hence, the proportion of eels leav- ing the austrian lakes remains unknown. eels were still caught 25 years after stocking ceased including in comparison, large females (>1 m length). the majority of female eels in lake constance start their downward migration into the rhine river and on into the atlantic ocean at a total length of 70–85 cm cor- responding to an age of 13–16 years (berg 1988). however, there are a number of hydroelectric power plants in the effluent rivers of austrian alpine lakes, so likely only very few if any eels would reach the danube river. not only did the stocking activities fail to develop a flourishing fishery, but they likely also resulted in negative effects on the entire lake community. although we cannot clearly separate the effect of eel predation from the impacts of stocking other preda- tory fish species, water level regulations and destruc- tion of littoral habitats, or changes in the temperature regime during the past 60 years (jeppesen et al. 2012), eels may have contributed to the extinction of small-bodied fish species such as minnow, stone loach, bullhead, bleak, gudgeon and bitterling. sev- eral studies have shown that eels can be piscivorous (moriarty 1973; biro 1974; schulze et al. 2004). as a primarily bottom-dwelling littoral fish, eels seek their prey in habitats where small-bodied taxa are most abundant (barak & mason 1992; tesch 2003). in neusiedlersee, they likely drove the european mud-minnow (umbra krameri; iucn status: vulnera- ble) to extinction (herzig-straschil 1991). small-bod- ied fish taxa are only found in shallow reed channels not inhabited by eels (wanzenb€ock & keresztessy 1995). the international trade with life eels has also negatively affected european eel populations them- selves. through the import of japanese eels for aqua- culture during the 1980s the parasitic nematode anguillicoloides crassus was introduced from asia to europe and may be partly responsible for the drastic decline in european eel populations (palstra et al. 2007). additionally, crayfish populations have decreased due to eel predation (e.g. sv€ardson 1972; bohl 1989; f€ureder & hanel 2000; p€ockl & pekny 2002). abun- dance of noble crayfish (astacus astacus) was nega- tively correlated with eel stocking intensity in nine polish lakes (schulz et al. 2006). in italy eels were even used for the biological control of the invasive red swamp crayfish (procambarus clarkii; aquiloni et al. 2010). most of the crayfish stocks in the aus- trian lakes disappeared decades ago due to the cray- fish plague (aphanomyces astaci). however, negative impacts of eels on the few remaining crayfish popula- tions and restocking programmes in europe were reported (sv€ardson 1972; p€ockl & pekny 2002). negative effects of stocked eels on natural commu- nities were already noticed as early as the 1970s (sv€ardson 1972), but the stocking campaign contin- ued unopposed. only because of catches diminishing eel stocking in austrian lakes and prices for glass eels rising steeply, did import and stocking of glass eels finally decline during the 1980s. the market price for glass eels rose up 10- fold during the period from 1960 to 1990 (ices 2006; briand et al. 2008). today, it has reached thousands of euros per kg rendering any stocking into natural lakes impossible. the eel is now classi- fied as a translocated fish species in most of the aus- trian provinces, and stocking is either restricted or completely prohibited. as maximum age ranges from 26 to 84 years (moriarty 1973, 1974; dekker et al. 1998; poole & reynolds 1998), we can assume that the very last eels in austrian lakes will disappear dur- ing the middle of this century. however, as the num- bers these introduced predators may still have on the natural communities will likely become insignificant within the next 10–20 years. are declining steadily, any effects acknowledgements we thank martin luger, g€unter bruschek, josef schachl and hubert daxner for help in the field. the fisheries managers from lakes irrsee
