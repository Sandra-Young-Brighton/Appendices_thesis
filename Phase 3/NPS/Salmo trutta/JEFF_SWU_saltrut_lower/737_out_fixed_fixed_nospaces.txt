3.2  1.4 m) and sympatric (3.3  1.4 m) situations. occupied water depths largely reflected available water, but water depths <15 cm were avoided by salmon parr. under experimental conditions, habitat use of allopatric salmon was density independent and salmon size had only minor effects, with smaller fish being more likely to occur in the shallow. habitat use of salmon in sympatry with trout did not differ from allopatric salmon habitat use, and only salmon size had minor effects on depth choice – occurrence of trout or fish density had no effect. allopatric trout was in general more frequent in the shallow habitat than salmon. habitat use of sympatric trout was affected by the occurrence of salmon and trout size, resulting in a higher use of the shallow habitats for small trout. to conclude, selective segregation has a dominant role in salmon habitat use (not affected by trout occurrence), whereas a mixed situation occurs in trout habitat use with elements of interactive segregation when competing with atlantic salmon (affected by salmon occurrence). key words: niche segregation; allopatric salmon; allopatry–sympatry comparison introduction (tilman 1982). fitness will competition is defined as ‘the negative effect which one organism has upon another by consuming, or is limited in controlling access to, a resource that availability’ therefore decrease as an effect of competition (blanchet et al. 2006), because competitors will reduce access to resources needed to increase survival, growth or reproduction. competition can be in terms of interfer- ence (when individuals interact directly with each other) or exploitation (the level of resources available is depressed by other individuals’ consumption (wootton 1998; begon et al. 2005). quantifying competition between two species can be carried put by the comparison of the species-spe- cific use of resources in both allopatry and sympatry (wootton 1998). the results of such studies fall into two categories: selective segregation when the use of resources is the same in both sympatry and allopatry, whereas segregation occurs when the use of resources differs between allopatry and sympatry (nilsson 1967). if selective segregation is the mechanism determining the segre- gation in habitat characteristics of two species, the two species are considered to use different resources which may be the result from previous competition (contemporary competition). competition can be an interactive or interselective correspondence: ole kristian berg, department of biology, ntnu – norwegian university of science and technology, 7491 trondheim, norway. e-mail: ole.berg@bio.ntnu.no * present address: norwegian nature inspectorate, 7485, trondheim, norway 544 doi: 10.1111/eff.12107 selective segregation between atlantic salmon and brown_trout important modifying factor in species interactions, and it is important to know whether interactive mech- anisms or selective differences have significant roles when analysing patterns in nature: for example, cli- mate (ritchie et al. 2009) or habitat restoration (whiteway et al. 2010; van zwol et al. 2012). the potential of modification of competitive interactions is completely different whether selective or interac- tive segregation occurs. sympatric atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) parr are segregated in riv- ers and streams, with trout predominantly holding positions in slow-flowing areas close to the river bank, whereas salmon are found at longer distances from the river bank (heggberget 1991), in deeper (bremset & berg 1999; linnansaari 2003; linnansa- ari et al. 2010) at places with swifter currents and closer to the river bed (e.g., bremset & heggenes 2001). this segregation has been explained by com- petition for profitable feeding places (heggenes et al. 1999; nislow et al. 2011). when adding the fact that young brown_trout as a rule grow faster than young salmon, a stronger dominance of brown_trout is likely to be seen in the wild (gibson 1993; klemetsen et al. 2003; nislow et al. 2011). based on an early set of aquaria experiments, kalleberg (1958) suggested that juvenile trout is a superior competitor to salmon of similar or slightly larger size. this assumption has been widely accepted by fish biologists without any vigorous testing, and more comprehensive studies on dominance relations under different conditions have never been conducted (maher & lott 2000). this lack of validation of a general assumption is not sound in scientific terms (kosso 1992; sober 1993), especially as numerous field studies have shown a numeric dominance of atlantic salmon compared with brown_trout in sympatric populations, chal- lenging the general validity of kalleberg (1958) assumption. from general competition theory, the general pre- dictions for interactive or selective segregation are, respectively, the following: if allopatric salmon show a wider range in habitat use than sympatric salmon, interselective or interactive segregation is the mecha- nism to explain the observed habitat segregation between juveniles of salmon and trout. this will sup- port the traditional view based on kalleberg (1958) aquaria-studies, which are heavily cited in fisheries literature. if allopatric and sympatric salmon use sim- ilar habitats, selective segregation is the mechanism indicating selectively specialisation for different habitats. the purpose of this paper was to present two dif- ferent allopatry–sympatry habitat use comparisons of atlantic salmon and brown_trout: one field study and one experimental study to focus on a simple niche character and the use of shallow and deep water for the two species. this was performed to test predic- tions from competitive interaction theory for the two species. allopatric populations of atlantic salmon do not occur under natural conditions, due to the distribu- tional overlap with brown_trout in europe and parts of north america (thorstad et al. 2011) and other salmonids such as brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis) in other parts of north america (maccrimmon & gots 1979; nislow et al. 2011; thorstad et al. 2011). in river ogna in mid-norway, however, an artificial situation occurred, as all fish inhabiting the river were killed after eradication measures (rotenone treat- ment) against the fatal salmon parasite gyrodactylus salaris in 2001 and 2002. after eradication of fish, only atlantic salmon was present in the early recov- ery period due to a major salmon egg-stocking pro- gramme. as a result, the lower stretches of river ogna were inhabited by an allopatric juvenile popula- tion of atlantic salmon. a study was designed to compare wild, sympatric and allopatric populations of juvenile salmon with respect to habitat use, habitat choice and use of resources based on the hypotheses above. because the allopatric situation was restricted to one river, a set of additional experiments were per- formed under controlled conditions to test the general validity of the findings. material and methods field study: area description all sites in the natural habitat use comparison were situated in mid-norway. habitat characteristics of anadromous salmon living in sympatry with brown_trout in rivers tovdalselva, vindøla, and humla (c.f. bremset & berg 1999) were compared with those of allopatric salmon (river ogna). the observations in the sympatric rivers were carried out in late summer in 1994 (tovdalselva: august 18th, vindøla: july 30th, humla: august 11th), while observations in allopatric river ogna were carried out in mid-august 2005. in addition to the collection of biological data (species, size and position), physical habitat charac- teristics were determined such as fish density, water depth, water velocity and temperature (table 1). in general, the sympatric sites were deeper and more slow-flowing than the allopatric sites. river ogna was chosen because of the unique situ- ation with an allopatric salmon population, because after rotenone treatment, approximately six million atlantic salmon eggs have been planted during winter (2001–2005), and the river was therefore densely populated with young salmon. based on the lack of trout in our observation series, it was concluded that 545 berg et al. table 1. number of fish observations during underwater surveys at allopatric salmon sites (river ogna in 2005) and sympatric sites (rivers tovdalselva, vindøla and humla in 1994), with some essential physical features such as water temperature, mean water depth (cm), mean water velocity (at 60% depth) and density. salmon (n) trout (n) temperature (°c) depth cm velocity (per cms) fish density fish per 100 m2 allopatric sites river ogna site 1 river ogna site 2 river ogna site 3 total number in allopatry sympatric sites river tovdalselva site 4 river vindøla site 5 river humla site 6 total number in sympatry 140 44 18 202 214 92 83 389 – – – – 35 29 30 94 15.0 15.0 15.0 13.2–17.3 10.3–18.3 13.1–13.7 40 29 43 102 80 57 50 55 31 25 11 17 23 22 9 37.5 40–65 50 temperatures and density in sympatric sites as given by bremset and berg (1997). river ogna in competitive terms had an allopatric population of atlantic salmon. the river ogna (64º16′n, 12º67′e) has a catch- ment area of 578 km2 and a mean annual stream flow of 19 m3s  1. the underwater visibility was up to 5 m during the surveys. the relative low visibility was mainly a result of brownish water colour (humic conditions) and in some areas due to high occurrence of attached and floating algae. three study sites were chosen in river ogna (one was approximately 600 m2, two were approximately 200 m2). the larg- est study site ranged from shore to shore, while the other two were covering about one-third of the river width. the study sites were chosen on the basis of their heterogeneous combination of mainly shallow, but also deep habitats. habitat use of a total of 202 salmon parr was observed in allopatry (table 1). the sympatric sites were in three rivers: the river tovdalselva (62°45′n, 8°45′e) has a catchment area of 207 km2 and mean annual stream flow is 6.4 m3s  1. underwater visibility was very high (up to 30 m). the river vindøla (63°00′n, 8°56′e) catchment area is 91 km2 and has a mean annual stream flow of 4.7 m3s  1. the river humla (63°25′n, 10°49′e) has a catchment area of 158 km2 and an annual mean stream flow of 4.2 m3s  1. details of the previously studied sites have been given in previous published papers on habitat use by atlantic salmon and brown_trout (brem- set & berg 1997, 1999; bremset 2000). because no schooling was observed in allopatry schooling, salmon were omitted from the sympatric data set (omitting 50 salmon observed more than 50 cm above bottom). nat- ural habitat use observations were carried out for 389 atlantic salmon parr living in sympatry with brown_trout (n = 94) (table 1). field study: methods of habitat use the sites were divided with a grid system (1 9 1 m) consisting of leaded lines (see bremset & berg 1999) 546 supplemented with coloured stones (hanssen 2007) organised as transects, which also were used as a ref- erence for the physical measurements and positioning of the observed fish. water velocities were measured with a water velocity meter (schiltknecht messtechnik ag; gos- sau, switzerland; mini air 2 with water probe; preci- sion 1 cms  1). the measurements were conducted at each crossing point of the grid system and included surface velocity (1 cm below the water sur- face) and mean velocity (at 60% of the total depth). underwater observations of fish were conducted by snorkelling between 12:00 and 18:00 local time. at each site, the observer started at the lower section and moved systematically along the transect lines, recording all fish observed in the closest stream sec- tion upstream. for each fish, the following parame- ters were recorded (c.f. bremset & berg 1999): 1. distance from river bank 2. height above bottom (estimated directly or as a fraction of total depth) 3. size group (small parr <7 cm; medium parr 7–10 cm; large parr >10 cm). as the width varied between the rivers in the study, a relative distance (rd) was computed on the basis of the distance from shore (d) and width of the river section (w): rd ¼ d=0:5  w comparison of natural occurring allopatric/sympat- ric atlantic salmon distance to river bank was analy- sed with three different measurements (distance to river bank, distance for those recorded within nearest 5 m from bank and rd). if the deviations from normal distribution were rel- atively small (kolmogorov–smirnov z), anova tests were used. in cases where distribution deviated con- siderably from the normal distribution, nonparametric rank-tests were used. significance level was set to selective segregation between atlantic salmon and brown_trout p < 0.05. statistical computations were performed using the statistical packages of ibm-spss (version 20.0) (ibm corp, armonk, ny). experimental study: design and study site at ims the experimental design was based on a comparison of habitat use (use of deep vs. shallow habitat) of allopatric atlantic salmon compared with that of sal- mon in sympatry with brown_trout. additionally, the effect of salmon presence on habitat choice of trout was tested. 5°57′e), (58°54′n, experiments were performed during summer 2010 (allopatric salmon) and 2012 (allopatric trout; sym- patric salmon and trout) at the nina research sta- tion south-western norway. four circular outdoor stream-channels were used in the experiments with water drawn from a nearby lake. each stream-channel was divided trans- versal into three sections (mean width: 218 cm; mean length: 507 cm; mean surface area: 10 m2) by mesh screens, which the fish could not pass. about 50% of each section was covered with white plastic tarp above the water surface to provide overhead cover. to simulate a natural stream, gravel from a river was covering the bottom in a several centimetre thick layer. the gravel was arranged like a sloped riverbed, creating a shallow habitat on one side and a deeper habitat on the other. to observe habitat use, the shallow and deep parts of the sections could be separated by remote-controlled wooden screens installed longitudinally above the streams (fig. 1). 1 5 6 2 3 4 these screens were held in place well above the water surface during the settling phase of fish and did therefore not affect fish behaviour. after releasing the wooden screens, fish were recaptured by electro- fishing with a portable electrofishing gear, and there- with, the use of shallow and deep habitats was determined. fork length (fl; i.e., body length, 1 mm) was measured immediately after fishing when the fish were still stunned. the shallow habitats ranged in depth from 0 to 29 cm (mean = 17.9 cm; 5.8 sd), had a bottom current of 0.03 ms  1 (0.01 sd) and a current of 0.05 ms  1 (0.01 sd) at a depth of 60% above the the deep habitats ranged in substrate. in contrast, depth from 21.8 to 40 cm (mean = 31.2 cm; 3.4 sd), had a bottom current of 0.06 ms  1 (0.03 sd) and a current of 0.10 ms  1 (0.03 sd) at a depth of 60% above the substrate. the effect of residence time for allopatric salmon habitat use was previously determined by different residency times to ascertain a temporal stability of habitat use. stability in deep/shallow habitat use was occurring after about 18 h. habitat use of allopatric salmon and allopatric trout was determined at both low (one fish per m2) and high density (three fish per m2), which illustrated habitat use with intraspecific competition. for the stream-channels were stocked in an additive design (weber & fausch 2003; tatara & berejikian 2012) with high-density salmon (three fish per m2) and low-density trout (one fish per m2). the sympatric experiment, the number of replicates varied between the differ- ent treatments, with 21 replicates for both the low- and high-density allopatric salmon treatment, 30 rep- licates for the low density and 29 replicates for the high-density allopatric trout treatment and 24 repli- cates for the sympatric salmon versus trout treatment. statistical analysis and model building for the allopatric treatments, the influence of the sin- gle variables fish density (d, low or high) and fl (l), as well as the interaction between these two vari- ables, on habitat choice of individual fish was mod- elled using a generalised linear mixed model (glmm), with section (s) and replicate (r) as random effects (replicate nested within section). the full models can be written as: psisr ¼ a þ b1di þ b2li þ b3dili þ as þ ar þ ei fig. 1. structure of the artificial stream-channel: (1) adjustable water inlet;

(r core team 2012), and the significance level was set to p ≤ 0.05. the function lmer with a binomial error distribution from the linear mixed-effects models package lme4 package was used for these analyses (bates et al. 2012). model simplification started with testing to remove the interaction effect and thereafter a sequen- tial removal of other fixed effects until the model could not be further simplified without causing a sig- nificant decrease in log-likelihoods. in this model validation, models were calculated with ‘maximum likelihood (ml)’ and the sequential models were compared with each other using an anova (zuur et al. 2009). the final models were then refitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (reml) and validated. the 95% confidence intervals for the parameter estimates were obtained using the arm package (gelman et al. 2012). results field study in sympatry, the smaller salmon parr occurred closer to the river bank than medium-sized and large sal- mon, whereas in allopatry, there was no difference between small- and medium-sized salmon, and the largest fish were further away from the shore than the other two size groups. the rd between the smallest sized salmon in allopatry and sympatry was signifi- cantly different the same situation was observed for medium-sized fish (p < 0.001, anova) (fig. 2). several of the different measurements of distance were significantly different (p < 0.05 or higher, anova) for allopatric and sym- patric salmon. the results were contrary to what should be expected if interactive selection should occur.

 1) and the (allopatry: 0.48 ms  1; surface values sympatry: 0.22 ms  1). when investigating relative water veloc- ity values, the use of water velocities in both allopa- try and sympatry reflected the availability (fig. 3) and no major difference was seen between allopatric and sympatric salmon. the habitat use comparison between trout and sal- mon shows a significant (p < 0.01, f = 7) difference in current, and a significant difference in height above bottom (p < 0.001, f = 47) but a nonsignifi- cant (p < 0.17) effect of distance to land. this con- clusion was not changed if fish size was included in the model (fish size: anova, p < 0.001, f = 38); spe- cies still had no significant role on explaining the dis- tance to land contrary to what should be expected in interactive competition occurred. experimental study: allopatric treatment juvenile atlantic salmon (n = 842) were mainly found in the deep habitat (average probabil- ity = 0.94), and only the smallest fish sizes were more likely to be found in the shallow. the interac- tion effect between fish size and fish density could be removed (p = 0.17) from the analyses, as well as the fish density in the next step of the model simplifi- cation (p = 0.24). fish size was then the remaining main factor affecting the habitat use (p < 0.001). the effect of size was not strong: an increase in fl from 33 to 43 mm increased the probability to be found in the deep by 0.11; a further increase to 53 and 63 mm increased the probability by 0.04 and 0.01, respec- tively (fig. 4; black solid line). brown_trout (n = 1134) occurred more often in the shallow habitat in comparison with the results of the allopatric salmon experiments; even the shallowest parts where the gravel broke through the water sur- face were used. habitat use of trout was found to be affected by an interaction between fish density and fish size (p = 0.03). the probability to find a trout in 549 berg et al.

fig. 4; grey dashed line). whether allopatric habitat use of trout differed from their sympatric habitat use was tested by the same type of model like above. the model suggested that allopatric trout habitat use differed significantly from their sympatric habitat use and that the interac- tion between salmon density and trout fl (p = 0.02) explained that difference. sympatric trout had in gen- eral a probability of about 0.50 to be found in the deep habitat, but that does not show the real picture. due to the interaction and density effect, the smallest trout (39 mm) had only a probability of 0.19 to be found in the deep, whereas the largest trout (62 mm) had a probability of 0.82; that is, with each centimetre increase in fl, the probability of being in the deep increased by about 0.28 (n = 552; fig. 5; habitat grey dashed line). discussion both field and experimental studies were designed to test whether selective or interactive segregation is influencing habitat use in sympatric atlantic salmon and brown_trout. emphasis was therefore given to habitat characteristics which can be predicted to change differently if interactive or selective interac- tion (e.g., nilsson 1967) occurs. an objection to the field study is that the allopatric salmon situation is only found in one river, and our results therefore have no true replication. on the other hand – com- bined with the experimental situation, the observa- tions from nature confirm the results from the experimental situation. in the field study, allopatric salmon were observed relatively farther away from the river bank than sym- patric salmon (except the larger-sized fish group). in sympatry, the smallest size group of salmon stayed closer to the shore than their larger conspecifics. additionally, this smallest size group was found to stay higher above the bottom when in allopatry. allo- patric salmon were observed at shallower water that might depths than sympatric salmon, but just reflect the larger available depth range in the latter case. in general, salmon avoided water depths of less than 15 cm and sought water depths greater than 30 cm. in both allopatry and sympatry, salmon used the available range of water velocities in the studied rivers. this indicates that competitive interactions with brown_trout (preferring slow-flowing areas; bremset & heggenes 2001; klemetsen et al. 2003), have little impact on salmon habitat use. allopatric salmon in the experimental study used mainly the deeper parts of the stream-channels, and habitat use was not affected by fish density. this behaviour did not change in the sympatric treatment – salmon still used the deep sections to a high degree and did not extend their habitat use into the shallower sections. in comparison with these findings, trout was almost equally often in the shallow and deep parts; but in the high-density treatment, the smallest trout were driven more often into the shallow habitat. when in sympatry with salmon, the smaller the trout, the more likely it was to be found in the shallow habitat. physical parameters such as water depth, water velocity and substrate strongly interact (heggenes & saltveit 1990; greenberg 1994; armstrong et al. 2003), and all physical parameters must be viewed together with the biotic interactions (greenberg 1994) to understand the complex picture of habitat choice in the rivers. however, examining each parameter, valuable information can be gained on basic habitat selection of juvenile salmonids, but one must keep in mind that many of the parameters are interdependent, but there are no satisfactory statistical alternatives to traditional parametric tests (plowman 2008). the allopatric and sympatric conditions varied with respect to physical habitat parameters, but the range of each parameter was wide enough to have great variability in the microhabitat. because of this vari- ance, relative values were also analysed for some of the parameters, but allopatry/sympatry comparisons showed no evidence of interactive segregation. investigation support existing knowledge: as trout have been described to prefer areas close to the shore (lindroth 1955; heggenes & saltveit 1990; bremset & berg 1999), and these shallow areas have been considered as especially favourable, depth and distance to land were the principal factors investigated in this study. the results from the pres- ent trout prefer depths <35 cm (heggenes et al. 1999), whereas water depths appear less important for atlan- tic salmon (hearn & kynard 1986; bremset & berg 1997, 1999; heggenes et al. 1999). the size interac- tion for salmon parr in the experimental situation was weaker than expected from the literature description of size-specific differences in summer habitat use of salmon juveniles, where small specimens are found 551 berg et al. in shallower and slower-flowing areas than larger individuals (bremset & berg 1999; m€aki-pet€ays et al. 2004). (1999) water velocity has been emphasised in earlier hab- itat use studies (bagliniere & champigneulle 1982; heggenes 1996; heggenes et al. 1999), and salmon parr are found to prefer snout velocities in the range of 5–25 cms  1 (heggenes et al. 1995), whereas young trout are primarily found in microhabitats with lower water velocities than salmon (heggberget 1991; heggenes et al. 1995, 1999). in spite of these published water velocity preferences measured in sympatry, the allopatric salmon were found at higher water velocity than in sympatry – showing that sal- mon have a preference for higher water velocity. found that small heggenes et al. trout (<7 cm) were abundant in shallow areas with water velocities ranging from 10 to 50 cm3s  1, while larger trout (>7 cm) were found in deeper and more slow- flowing habitats. shelter or cover is related to the sub- strate composition (finstad et al. 2007; venter et al. 2008), and survival has been connected to access to shelter and cover for salmonids (chapman 1966; hunt 1976; marschall & crowder 1995; finstad et al. 2007). in our study, trout has a higher variation in hab- itat choice dependent on species, density and fish size. kalleberg (1958) conducted his experiments with juvenile atlantic salmon and brown_trout in a stream tank (aquarium) with natural substrata, water depths of 20–30 cm and surface current typically between 18 and 25 cms  1. these habitat characteristics are largely corresponding to the innate habitat preferences of juve- nile trout and especially larger parr (see above). it could therefore be argued that the experimental condi- tions of*** kalleberg (1958) were more favourable for young trout than for young salmon and that the inter- pretation of the results should take this into account. height above bottom is another habitat parameter which has shown interspecific differences. allen (1969) found that salmon juveniles in general held position closer to the substratum than trout juveniles, and the same phenomenon has been reported from rivers (bremset & berg 1999; bremset & other heggenes 2001). moreover, in the latter studies, young-of-the-year held position closer to the bottom and closer to the river bank than older individuals (bremset & berg 1999). however, there was an indi- cation of salmon holding position higher above bot- tom in allopatry, that is, the smallest fish size, which should be expected if the habitat use in sympatry was restricted by the presence of trout (interactive segre- gation hypothesis). in the experimental study, indica- tions for interactive segregation have been found because small- and medium-sized trout in the sympat- ric treatment were using the shallow habitat more often than in the allopatric treatment. the interactive 552 segregation was size selective, as it did not affect all trout size classes equally. as our smallest trout were more often in the shallow habitats when in sympatry with salmon, agonistic interactions must have taken place, which is evidence for interactive segregation as a mechanism in habitat use of trout in sympatry with salmon. in several previous studies of atlantic salmon living in sympatry with other salmonids, interactive segrega- tion has been reported (kalleberg 1958; kennedy & strange 1986; heggenes et al. 1999, 2002; stradmeyer et al. 2008). selective segregation has also been reported: in a study of atlantic salmon and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) in vermont, small differ- ences in habitat use in early stages were indicating selective segregation for the 0 + , while interactive segregation appeared to be the mechanism in competi- tion among yearlings (hearn & kynard 1986). later experiments on the competitive interaction between salmonid species have used growth rate changes to assess competitive interactions (van zwol et al. 2012), and their conclusion resembles ours: ‘outside of den- sity-dependent effects, atlantic salmon will not impact stream production of brown_trout’. in spite of the limi- tations in the numbers of repetitions in van zwol et al. (2012), the authors were able to illustrate the asymmet- ric completion between the different species. accord- ing to our results from the present investigation, a modified conclusion would be the following: brown_trout will not impact production of atlantic salmon. the effect of large trout and predation is then of course not included, and the results are based on interactions between fish of matching size. (2005) have reported that the competitive asymmetry of atlantic salmon and brown_trout, where an element of interaction is seen from salmon on brown_trout habitat use, has been indicated for early life stages by heggenes et al. (1999). the interactive element of brown_trout has been recognised by a number of authors, for example, harwood et al. (2001), volpe et al. (2001) and arm- strong et al. (2003). numerous authors like h€ojesj€o et al. less-competitive atlantic salmon parr consumed fewer food items as they were excluded from foraging areas by more aggressive brown_trout or completely driven away from areas occupied by brown_trout (gibson & erkinaro 2009). the selective element of atlantic salmon is probably favoured in our experiments with normal densities and with a relatively wide availabil- ity of habitats where atlantic salmon habitat use and resource use have not been shown to be negatively affected by brown_trout. brown_trout as a species is well known to have a low threshold for competitive interactions, illustrated in interactions with other spe- cies like arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) (hesthagen et al. 2011), where brown_trout may dominate over selective segregation between atlantic salmon and brown_trout arctic char in summertime when food resources are abundant, whereas these relationships may be shifted at periods with less food (finstad et al. 2011) where trout appears to have a competitive advantage under high availability of energy. interspecific comparative studies of fish under contrasting com- petitive conditions are an adequate method to illumi- nate interactions. however, wrong conclusions may be made when allopatric circum- stances are severely different from the sympatric ones. an advantage with the current investigation is the combination of field and experimental studies with overlapping and similar results. this indicates that a general mechanism has been uncovered with many consequences for the understanding of salmonid production. the present study show that salmon are selective in their habitat use, according to the avail- ability, and do not change their preferences regardless of the presence of brown_trout. brown_trout, however, have a marked element of interactive segregation in sympatry with atlantic salmon, and the numerous observations of high growth among brown_trout in sympatry with atlantic salmon are therefore probably a reflection of a flexible species with both selective and interactive elements with high performance within a narrow niche compared with the selectively adapted atlantic salmon parr. if selective segregation domi- nates the competitive interaction between brown_trout and atlantic salmon, this will have major effects on how natural production of one species interacts with the other in the river. further studies should be con- ducted to ensure, for example, the water temperature effects, ontogenetic and spatial variation (ayllon et al. 2010) effects on the interactions, but there is definitely, contrary to earlier reports, an element of selective inter- action in the habitat choice of atlantic salmon parr in the interaction with brown_trout. acknowledgements the data of the field study were sampled with the help of a number of benevolent persons, who all are hereby thanked. however, specially mentioned are the field assistance from kare øyen, frank øyen, magdalene langseth and sjur kvam- men, and the comments of two anonymous referees. the data of the experimental study have been sampled with the help of frøydis bolme hamnes, vidar bentsen, wouter koch and øystein kielland and was funded by centre of environmental design of renewable energy (cedren) http://www.cedren. no. the study was conducted according to the national regula- tions for the treatment and welfare of experimental animals. references allen, k.r. 1969. distinctive aspects of ecology of stream fishes - a review. journal of the fisheries research board of canada 26: 1429–1438. armstrong, j.d., kemp, p.s., kennedy, g.j.a., ladle, m. & milner, n.j. 2003. habitat requirements of atlantic salmon and brown_trout in rivers and streams. fisheries research 62: 143–170. ayllon, d., almodovar, a., nicola, g.g. & elvira, b. 2010. ontogenetic and spatial variations in brown_trout habitat selection. ecology of freshwater fish 19: 420–432. bagliniere, j.l. & champigneulle, a. 1982. population- (salmo_trutta l.) and atlantic density of brown_trout juveniles on the river scorff salmon (salmo_salar l.)
