(1997) showed that a constructed man-made channel was rapidly colonised by drifting ﬁsh. fish may also use drifting to facilitate their migration from ﬂooded meadows as ﬂood waters recede (savenkova & asanov 1988) and for short migrations related to habitat shift within the river channel (schmutz & jungwirth 1999). finally, many studies have inter- preted drifting as a passive dislodgement related to visual disorientation (pavlov 1966; manteifel et al. 1978; brown & armstrong 1985) or inability to withstand high ﬂow velocities (harvey 1987; vanderkooy & peterson 1998). here, we use a species-speciﬁc approach to investigate differences in the importance of drifting and its seasonal and developmental timing among seven cyprinid species in two rivers of the central europe. our previous study (reichard et al. 2002a) showed that drift is an important component of the life history in most european cyprinids and indicated there may be differences in the propensity to drift among species, analysed by comparing the relative abundance 482 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00229.x (ra) of drifting yoy ﬁsh to the ra of juv collected during autumnal electroﬁshing censuses. similarly, zitek et al. (2004a) found differences between the assemblage structure of drifting ﬁsh and the adult stock, while sonny et al. (2006) showed that species dominant in adult stock also dominated the drift samples. precise data on the developmental stages of drifting european cyprinid ﬁshes are scarce, though some studies suggest size- and stage-speciﬁc drifting in european cyprinids (reichard et al. 2004; zitek et al. 2004b; sonny et al. 2006). other seasonal studies do not separate species for the analysis of size structure and developmental stages of drifting ﬁsh (carter & reader 2000) or comprise relatively few species (jurajda 1998). some data on size- and stage- speciﬁc drift from short-term (maximum 1 week) studies (e.g., copp & cellot 1988; penˇa´z et al. 1992; schmutz et al. 1997) that cannot encom- pass all developmental stages. notably, no previous study compared drifting cyprinid ﬁsh to resident ﬁsh both collected at the same time. come in the present study, we investigated interspeciﬁc differences in propensity to drift, seasonal dynamics of drift density, and size and developmental stages of drifting ﬁsh in two european lowland rivers over 2 years, using a comparison with nondrifting ﬁsh collected from nurseries during the day and night and the drifting ﬁsh collected at the same time and from the same site. we present data on seven abundant cyprinid species that dominated our samples; bream abramis brama (l.), silver bream abramis bjoerkna (l.), bleak alburnus alburnus (l.), chub leuciscus cephalus (l.), gudgeon gobio spp., prussian carp carassius auratus gibelio (bloch) and roach rutilus rutilus (l.). materials and methods study area (60 m wide, the study was undertaken in two adjacent lowland rivers (danube basin, czech republic). the river morava an average discharge of )1, maximum depth of 1 m) has been chann- 65 m3 s elised and regulated by weirs. in the study area, the shoreline was a boulder bank with a deposit of silt. woody debris and overhanging emergent vegetation provided shelter for yoy ﬁsh at the river margins, but there were no nurseries available in mid-channel (reichard 2002). the river kyjovka, smaller than the r. morava (5 m wide, average discharge of )1, maximum depth 0.5 m) has also been 1.1 m3 s channelised, but has no weirs. the shoreline com- prised an eroded clay bank with overhanging emergent vegetation. for a detailed description of the study sites see reichard et al. (2002a). drift of yoy cyprinid ﬁshes sampling the mesh size did not affect sampling was conducted at 7- to 11-day intervals from may to august (15 dates from 4 may to 26 august in 1999 and eight dates from 26 may to 26 july in 2000). samples of drifting ﬁsh were taken using a net with an opening of 0.6 m2 (1.01 m width by 0.59 m depth) and the mesh size 0.5 mm. the mesh size used was a typical size for drift studies (for a review see schmutz et al. 1997) and has been proven to be efﬁcient for capturing ﬁsh >5 mm (copp & cellot 1988; schmutz et al. 1997; robinson et al. 1998; reichard 2002; zitek et al. 2004a; sonny et al. 2006). consequently, we believe that the observed size structure of the drifting ﬁsh. the net was set 1–2.5 m from the bank for a period of 10–20 min (to avoid any clogging from suspended material). the position of net was chosen according to a pilot study that revealed that >95% of all ﬁsh drifted nearshore, at a distance of <3 m from the riverbank (reichard et al. 2004). samples were taken three times during the day (09:00, 12:00 and 18:00 hours) and three times a night (22:00, 24:00 and 02:00 hours) in each river on each sampling date. daily mean values of river discharge and water temperature were obtained from the nearest hydrometeorological station of the czech hydromete- orological institute in stra´zˇnice (fig. 1). the hydro- meteorological data from the river kyjovka were not available; there is no hydrometeorological station in the study stretch. resident yoy ﬁsh were sampled along the river banks (referred to as nurseries hereafter) using a dipnet (2 m pole, ring diameter of 40 cm, mesh size 0.5 mm). one sample was taken during daytime (09:00–12:00 or 18:00–19:00; light level >500 lx) and one at night (22:30–01:00; light level <5 lx) on the same dates that drift sampling was conducted. each sample consisted of 4–34 dipnet hauls. the samples were collected downstream from the drift net in all types of nurseries available (depositional pool, low ﬂow areas along the boulder bank and overhanging vegetation, rifﬂes near a bridge pier). sampling effort was in proportion to the availability of the different types of nursery habitats. all yoy ﬁsh caught were ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde within 30 min to ensure high quality tissue preserva- tion and transported to the laboratory for identiﬁcation and staging. sample processing and data analyses fishes were identiﬁed using koblickaya (1981) and our own reference collection derived from laboratory- reared specimens. because gobio gobio (l.) and gobio albipinnatus lukasch cannot be separated as larvae, they were treated as gobio spp. throughout the analyses. the standard length (sl) of all ﬁsh was 483 reichard & jurajda e g r a h c s d i y l i  a d n a e m 500 400 300 200 100 0 e r u t a r e p m e t t r e a w 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1999 m arch april m ay june july aug 1999 m arch april m ay june july aug 500 400 300 200 100 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2000 april m ay june july aug m arch 2000 )1) and mean water fig. 1. mean daily discharge (upper panels;

ﬁve species from the r. morava and three species from the r. kyjovka. alburnus alburnus was common in both rivers. bitterling, rhodes amarus (bloch), the most abundant species in the drift, do not scatter the eggs over a spawning substrate, but lay them deep into the gill cavities of living unionid mussels where eggs and embryos develop for 4–6 weeks (smith et al. 2004). this unique reproductive strategy has several import- ant consequences for the life history of early devel- opmental stages, including drifting (reichard 2002), and therefore we have not included this species in the present study. drift density of each species was calculated as the number of individuals per 1000 m3 of ﬁltered water (the current velocity in the centre of the net opening multiplied by the area of an active net opening). most 484 ﬁsh in the study area drifted at night (reichard et al. 2002b) and only night samples were used for the drift density estimates. there was no difference found in the drift density and no temporal pattern among the three night-time samples for any species (kruskall–wallis tests, all p > 0.05). consequently, the mean (±1 se) drift density was calculated for each night. the abundance of resident ﬁsh was expressed as a catch per unit effort (number of ﬁsh per 10 dipnet hauls). considering that the density estimates in nurseries were less accurate than the estimates of drift densities, we divided the density of the resident ﬁsh into three categories (0, 0– 25 and >25 ﬁsh per 10 hauls) and used them only for a graphical representation. we calculated a drift index (zitek et al. 2004a) to compare the ra of drifting ﬁsh to those in nurseries (for night samples), using a formula e ¼ [ra in drift (%) ) ra in nurseries (%)]/ [ra in drift (%) + ra in nurseries (%)]. the size structure of drifting ﬁsh was compared with the size structure of ﬁsh in nurseries using kolgomorov–smirnov two-sample tests. this proce- dure compares the shapes of distribution in the two samples and tests a hypothesis that the two samples were drawn from the same statistical population. all the data from the entire sampling season were pooled for analysis. frequencies of the particular develop- mental stages collected from nurseries during day, collected from nurseries during night, and from the drift samples (collected at night) were compared to each other using the chi-squared tests. the frequencies of particular developmental stages in nurseries during day were used to calculate expected frequencies of the resident and drifting ﬁsh in the night samples. data from the entire season were pooled for analysis. while the comparison between the resident ﬁsh from daytime samples and the drift samples measured propensity to drifting among particular stages, the comparison of the daytime and night-time samples from nurseries (col- lected using the same sampling gear) controlled for the sampling gear effect. tests were corrected for multiple testing by a bonferroni method whenever applicable. the analyses are based on 6789 individual ﬁsh (1625, 1645, and 3519 ﬁsh collected in nurseries during the day, at night, and drifting at night, respectively). results propensity to drift there were clear differences in the propensity to drifting among species and these differences were consistent during the study years and among the populations. relative abundance of a. brama, gobio spp. and c. a. gibelio in the drift samples were higher than their ra in nurseries. alburnus alburnus and l. cephalus were more frequent in samples from nurseries compared with drift samples. rutilus rutilus and a. bjoerkna were equally represented in both the drift and nursery assemblages (fig. 2). gobio spp. (24% and 16% in 1999 and 2000, respectively) and r. rutilus (22% and 18%) dominated the drift samples in the r. morava during both years, together with r. amarus (17% and 51%). in the r. kyjovka, r. amarus (49%), c. a. gibelio (17%) and a. alburnus (13%) dominated the drift samples in 1999. in 2000, the drift densities in the r. kyjovka were low (fig. 3) and largely dominated by r. amarus (65%). seasonal patterns the magnitude of the peak drift density and the start and duration of the drifting period varied among species (fig. 3). the interannual variability in the drift densities and the seasonal dynamics within popula- tions differed among species, being lowest for a. brama in the r. morava (fig. 3a) and highest for r. rutilus and gobio spp. in the r. morava (fig. 3b). in the r. kyjovka, there were large differences in drift densities between 1999 and 2000, though the seasonal patterns were similar (fig. 3c). only a. alburnus drifted abundantly in both rivers and the seasonal pattern was consistent between populations (bimodal, relatively late start of drifting compared with other species; fig. 3a,c). the maximum drift density for a single species was in the )3 535 ± 114.8 ﬁsh 1000 m r. morava in 1999, and 557 ± 147.6 ﬁsh 1000 m for r. rutilus in the r. morava in 2000 (fig. 3b). in the river kyjovka, c. a. gibelio reached a maximum )3 for gobio spp. drift of yoy cyprinid ﬁshes morava 1999 a. alburnus a. brama gobio spp. l. cephalus r. rutilus morava 2000 a. alburnus a. brama gobio spp. r. rutilus cephalus l. kyjovka 1999 a. alburnus a. bjoerkna c. a. gibelio 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5 –1.0 x e d n i t f i r d x e d n i t f i r d x e d n i t f i r d fig. 2. propensity of the seven abundant cyprinids to drift. the positive values of drift index (see text for its calculation) indicate propensity to drift, negative values indicate drift avoidance. )3 in 1999 (fig. 3c). density of 377 ± 49.9 ﬁsh 1000 m abramis brama was the ﬁrst species that peaked in the drift in the r. morava in the beginning of june 1999, followed by r. rutilus and l. cephalus. the drift of a. alburnus and gobio spp. peaked in late-june. the ﬁrst sampling in 2000 (26 may) probably coincided with a seasonal peak of the drift for a. brama, r. rutilus and l. cephalus, while a. alburnus and gobio spp. peaked later (fig. 3a,b). in the kyjovka, the drift seasonal dynamics exhibited bimodal (c. a. gibelio, a. albur- nus) or trimodal (a. bjoerkna) patterns (fig. 3c). size structure of drifting ﬁsh and its comparison to ﬁsh in nurseries the size range of drifting ﬁsh varied among species;

carter et al. 1986) and a north american cyprinid (johnston 1997). among these ﬁshes, several strategies for using river current for a downstream transport have been proposed. for pelagophilous ﬁshes, their downstream drift begins immediately after spawning and pelagic eggs develop in the water column while drifting (balon 1975). amphidromous gobies and potamodr- omous percids enter the drift after hatching to move from spawning to nursery habitats before the onset of feeding (iguchi & mizuno 1990; mion et al. 1998), while other ﬁshes drift during the distinct develop- mental interval within the larval period (brown & armstrong 1985; carter et al. 1986; jurajda 1998). carter et al. (1986) reported that, in contrast to the riverine species drifting in well-deﬁned developmental intervals, the introduced nonriverine species did not exhibit any body size pattern of drifting. this suggests that drifting by riverine ﬁshes may be an adaptation to the riverine conditions rather than a passive dislodge- ment by river currents, and ﬁsh may enter the current actively as a result of stage- and species-speciﬁc behavioural levels and a rheogradient (manteifel et al. 1978). responses to the light drifting may be attributed to swimming ability (reichard et al. 2004). most ﬁsh drifted at l3 or l6/ juv stage and these developmental intervals coincide with signiﬁcant changes in their swimming ability (copp & kova´cˇ 1996; garner 1999; penˇa´z 2001). at stage l3, the anterior chamber of the swim bladder starts to ﬁll with gas, which allows ﬁsh to swim actively. however, their manoeuvring ability remains poor because they still lack ventral ﬁns and possess a large ﬁnfold area rather than discrete unpaired ﬁns. at l6/juv stage, their swimming ability is considerably improved, as both paired and unpaired ﬁns are well developed (penˇa´z & gajdu˚sˇek 1979; prokesˇ & penˇa´z 1979). drifting at l3 stage could be a density- dependent response to a competition. cyprinids deposit a large number of eggs in clusters over the substrate. after the onset of exogenous feeding, larvae 487 reichard & jurajda r. rutilus morava, 1999 resident day resident night drifting night 6 10 14 18 22 26 30 34 l. cephalus morava, 2000 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 a. brama morava, 1999 100 80 60 40 20 s n o i t a v r e s b o f o r e b m u n s n o i t a v r e s b o f o r e b m u n s n o i t a v r e s b o f o r e b m u n 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 8 10 standard length (mm) 12 14 16 fig. 4. length–frequency distribution of drifting ﬁsh (black bars), ﬁsh resident in nurseries during day (white bars) and ﬁsh in nurseries during night (hatched bars) for rutilus rutilus, leuciscus cephalus and abramis brama. data from the entire study period within a given year were pooled. note that the scale on the y-axis differs among three species. have a limited swimming capacity and therefore dispersal ability (l1 and l2 stages). fish at l3 stage have the capability to actively enter the river current and may use it as a means of transport (pavlov 1994; kova´cˇ 2000). whether this movement is related to habitat shift from spawning to feeding areas (i.e., obligatory, performed by all ﬁsh) or is a density- dependent response to high competitor density or low food abundance (i.e., optional, only some ﬁsh drift) is unclear and requires an experimental study. a trans- ition from larval to juv period in cyprinid ﬁshes (l6/ juv stages) coincides with a habitat and diet shift 488 300 240 180 120 60 0 200 150 100 50 0 300 240 180 120 60 0 a. alburnus l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv a. bjoerkna l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv c. a. gibelio l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv 300 240 180 120 60 0 300 240 180 120 60 0 800 600 400 200 0 600 450 300 150 0 a. brama l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv l. cephalus l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv gobio spp. l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv r. rutilus l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 juv fig. 5. number of developmental stages in the samples of drifting ﬁsh (black bars), ﬁsh resident in nurseries during day (white bars) and ﬁsh in nurseries during night (hatched bars). data were pooled within the species across years and rivers for the graphical representation. (copp & kova´cˇ 1996), and drifting is the most suitable means of transport between distinct habitats in riverine conditions (schmutz & jungwirth 1999). notwithstanding these adaptive explanations of drift- ing, drift might also be largely accidental and its species- and stage-dependent structure may simply match the susceptibility of particular stages and species to be taken by the water current as a result of their behavioural responses to the light and the water current at certain stages. only a general understanding of the yoy behaviour and ecology would allow linking ontogenetic changes to propensity to drift. whilst habitat use of yoy european cyprinids has extensively been studied during the day (e.g., copp 1992), sampling at twilight and night is deﬁcient due to logistic constraints (baras & nindaba 1999a,b). this limits any ﬁnal conclusion of why ﬁsh enter the river current to drift and what ﬁtness consequences such decision can have. two long-term studies (zitek et al. 2004a; sonny et al. 2006) have previously investigated developmen- tal stages of drifting ﬁsh, them compared with yoy ﬁsh in nurseries. notably, l1 and l2 stages dominated drift samples in both studies. though none of table 2. results of chi-squared tests on differences in frequencies of particular developmental stages in samples of resident and drifting ﬁsh from the rivers morava and kyjovka. drift of yoy cyprinid ﬁshes resident ﬁsh drifting ﬁsh v2 d.f. p-value v2 d.f. p-value drifting stage r. morava 1999 alburnus alburnus abramis brama gobio spp. leuciscus cephalus rutilus rutilus r. morava 2000 a. alburnus a. brama gobio spp. l. cephalus r. rutilus r. kyjovka 1999 a. alburnus a. bjoerkna c. a. gibelio 23.5 5.3 low sample size 15.4 30.5 13.6 low sample size low sample size 67.7 37.9 272.1 180.1 14.8 4 3 5 5 5 5 3 4 4 5 <0.0001* 0.149 0.009 <0.0001* 0.019 <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* 0.011 20.1 65.1 low sample size 48.3 626.1 234.2 low sample size low sample size 20.2 26.3 250.9 380.4 1297 4 3 5 5 5 5 3 4 4 5 0.0005* <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* 0.001* <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* <0.0001* l3 l3 juv l3 juv juv l3 juv l3, l4 l6 l6 l2, juv l5, l6 chi-squared value (v2), degrees of freedom (d.f.), statistical signiﬁcance of the test (p-value) and developmental stages that were overrepresented in the drift samples are shown. asterisks denote statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.005) after bonferroni correction. comparison of the ﬁsh body sizes in the present study and studies by zitek et al. (2004a) and sonny et al. (2006) reveals that these differences cannot be attrib- uted to a differential classiﬁcation of developmental stages among studies, but rather reﬂect real differences in the ontogenetic timing of drifting among popula- tions. we may also discount that the difference arose as an artefact of the sampling gear differences or methodology; all three studies used conical-shaped drift nets with mesh size of 0.5 mm. zitek et al. (2004a) used nets with a 0.07 m2 opening and positioned their nets at locations with the highest current velocities within a 2 m wide artiﬁcial side- channel connected to the r. danube. sonny et al. (2006) placed their nets with 0.09 m2 opening 1 m from the bank, on the edge of the main current. the present study used nets with an opening of 0.6 m2, but their placement on the edge of the main current is similar to sonny et al. (2006). in our previous study from a different (but adjacent) river (reichard et al. 2004), we have used smaller nets with an opening of 0.13 m2 (all the other sampling gear speciﬁcation being equal), but found the same developmental stages (l3 and older) in the drift. the size and developmental stage of drifting ﬁsh correlated positively with the distance from the bank and with the current velocity (reichard et al. 2004). however, ﬁsh (mainly a. brama) at stage l3 dominated even those samples collected closest to the bank and l1 (<0.1%) and l2 (2.9% of 1666 drifting ﬁsh) stages were rarely encountered, rejecting the hypothesis that observed differences between the present data and the previous studies come from this correlation. another possible explanation for the lack of l1 and l2 larvae in our samples might be that our sampling started later than the previous studies. however, our ﬁrst sampling in 1999 (4 may) predated that of zitek et al. (2004a) by 17 days, while temperature regime was very similar between the two studies (zitek et al. 2004b). similarly, sonny et al. (2006) started their sampling in mid-may. this indicates that the lack of l1 and l2 stages in our drift samples is not likely to be accounted for a difference in methodology, but rather represents a characteristic of the study populations. the abundance of a. brama in the drift samples from the r. morava is notable, because a. brama is almost absent in the yoy ﬁsh assemblage of the lower morava collected in september (jurajda 1995, 1999). the drift data showed that bream spawned in the study stretch of the river and moved downstream at stage l3, i.e., about 8 days after hatching (penˇa´z & gajdu˚sˇek 1979). after the end of the drift period, no a. brama were caught in nursery areas. as a. brama drifted abundantly elsewhere (pavlov et al. 1977; carter & reader 2000; reichard et al. 2004; zitek et al. 2004a), drifting could be an essential link in their complex migratory life cycle within a ﬂood plain, with distinct spawning, nursery and adult habitats (molls 1999; grift et al. 2001; lucas & baras 2001). gobio spp. has also been overrepresented in the drift samples compared with samples collected in nurseries, in agreement with ﬁndings of zitek et al. (2004a). we are aware that the low abundance of gobio spp. from nurseries may be a consequence of the sampling bias, through underestimating the bot- tom-dwelling gobio spp. in the dipnet samples. on the other hand, gobio spp. drift densities were, along with densities of r. rutilus, highest of all species consid- 489 reichard & jurajda ered. gobio gobio drifted at juv stage in the r. morava, though has been reported drifting at stage l3 in the river rhoˆne (copp & cellot 1988). however, the mean sl of 15.9 mm given by copp & cellot (1988) is the size at which gudgeon have already reached the juv stage (present study; penˇa´z et al. 1978; prokesˇ & penˇa´z 1979). thus, the data on developmental stage are questionable, though the body size is within the range encountered in the present study. zitek et al. (2004a) found that stage l1 largely dominated gobio spp. drift. rutilus rutilus drifted frequently at the threshold between larval and juv periods at sl of 14–17.5 mm. this species was shown to drift either at juv stage (penˇa´z et al. 1992), l3 and l6/juv stages (pavlov et al. 1990; jurajda 1998), l1, l3 and juv stages (zitek et al. 2004a) or l1–l2 stages (sonny et al. 2006). notwithstanding the developmental stage, r. rutilus is a common species encountered in the drift (pavlov 1994; carter & reader 2000; reichard et al. 2001) and variability in the drift and migratory behaviour among and within roach populations is well described (pavlov et al. 1990; pavlov 1994). carassius a. gibelio is an exotic species from east asia that became widespread in central europe after the 1970s following its incidental release with a stock of asian cyprinids for aquaculture in 1954 (holcˇı´k 1978). carassius a. gibelio is a common species in the r. kyjovka and connected water bodies (reichard 2002) and its drifting may serve as an effective dispersal strategy along and across the r. kyjovka system. zitek et al. (2004a) found c. a. gibelio almost absent in the drift samples, though they attribute this ﬁnding to a failure to spawn rather than to drift avoidance. abramis bjoerkna and a. alburnus exhibited multi- modal seasonal patterns in the drift density. these two species drifted at two distinct developmental stages and are batch spawners. alburnus alburnus is fre- quently encountered in the drift samples (zitek et al. 2004a) and was the only species that drifted abun- dantly in both study rivers, while the drift of a. bjoerkna has rarely been reported (pavlov 1966). leuciscus cephalus were the dominant ﬁsh in the yoy ﬁsh assemblage in the r. morava (reichard et al. 2002a), but did not drift at high densities. leuciscus cephalus is reported to drift infrequently (copp & cellot 1988; jurajda 1998; carter & reader 2000; reichard et al. 2001, 2004; zitek et al. 2004a; sonny et al. 2006), though is described to migrate upstream to spawn (reviewed by lucas & baras 2001). in conclusion, we found interspeciﬁc differences in the utilisation of the drift, its seasonal patterns and size- and stage-dependency, and related them to life history patterns of the individual species. we hope that our study stimulate further research into the import- 490 ance of drifting for stream and river ﬁsh populations. the future research should focus on the importance of drift behaviour at the population level. the next step should include an estimate of proportion of yoy individuals undergoing drift, the mortality risks of drifting and the distance travelled by an individual over a drifting period. while such questions pose a serious methodological challenge, answering these points will certainly confer signiﬁcant insights into our understanding of drifting and its population conse- quences.
