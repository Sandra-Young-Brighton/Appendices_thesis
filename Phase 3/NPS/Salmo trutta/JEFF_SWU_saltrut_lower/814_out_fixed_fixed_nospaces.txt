hereafter termed salmon), multi- annual spawning is possible and reproductive success is in part dependent on other factors, such as competition for spawn- ing habitat and mates (fleming, 1998). during salmonid migration, movements made to find habitat suitable for nest or redd construction is known as the search phase of migration (sensu thorstad, økland, aarestrup, & heggberget, 2008). although several studies have inves- tigated the influence of environmental conditions on the timing and success of migratory behaviour in the period preceding the search phase, (known as the upstream phase, see reviews by thorstad et al., 2008; jonsson & jonsson, 2009; warren, dunbar, & smith, 2015), fewer studies have investigated the role played by environmental 128  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:128–137. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd﻿paary et pal conditions on the final distribution of redds throughout rivers, that is the outcome of the search phase (chapman, weitkamp, welsh, dell, & schadt, 1986; klett, torgersen, henning, & murray, 2013). this is somewhat surprising given the importance of the search phase for successful reproduction and fitness. studies to date have revealed that salmon construct redds in fine river gravels at the upstream part of riffles, which provide optimum oxygenation for incubating their eggs and embryos (bardonnet & baglinière, 2000). spawning close to deep pools or vegetative cover can also be advantageous as these habitats can reduce predation of breeding adults and developing juveniles (white, 1942 as cited in armstrong, kemp, kennedy, ladle, & milner, 2003). other environ- mental factors, including temperature, sedimentation, river depth and water velocity, can also affect the location of a salmon redd (armstrong et al., 2003; jonsson & jonsson, 2009; moir, soulsby, & youngson, 1998, 2002). for example, water velocity and depth, as well as gravel size, are important factors for chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) redd site selection (groves & chandler, 1999; kondolf & wolman, 1993). climate change is considered one of the greatest threats to bio- diversity in the 21st century (bellard, bertelsmeier, leadley, thuiller, & courchamp, 2012; thuiller, 2007). rivers are less stable than ma- rine ecosystems and therefore more prone to rapid changes in con- ditions, such as temperature or flow (armstrong et al., 2003). under current climate change predictions, the number of extreme weather events will increase over the next century, which may directly impact rivers through increases in extreme flow and temperature events (hulme et al., 2002). climate- driven changes in extreme flow might affect salmon spawning success in a number of ways. extreme high flow can result in gravel washout and damage to existing redds, while sedimentation of redds following high flows can negatively affect egg and embryo development and subsequent juvenile survival (lapointe, bergeron, bérubé, pouliot, & johnston, 2004; levasseur, bergeron, lapointe, & bérubé, 2006). on the other hand, at extreme low flow, factors such as reduced oxygen content and increased temperature may also hinder upstream migration (solomon & sambrook, 2004). at the very extreme, drought conditions could result in the drying out of redds and subsequent mortality of developing embryos (becker & neitzel, 1985). while the flow requirements and other preferences of spawning salmon have been studied extensively, little research has focused on the impact of flow on the overall distribution and density of redds along a river. it has been suggested that reduced flow during the pe- riod of peak migration can slow the upstream phase of migration, par- ticularly of larger adults that preferentially spawn further upstream, leading to spawning aggregations below within- river barriers (mitchell & cunjak, 2007; solomon, sambrook, & broad, 1999). studies on the river tay and dee in scotland suggest that increased water discharge during the period of final migration, here assumed to be the search phase of migration, allowed salmon to access shallower spawning trib- utaries that did not provide suitable conditions for residence earlier in the season (hawkins, 1989; webb, 1989; webb & hawkins, 1989). aside from these studies, there are few studies that have directly     |  129 investigated the effects of flows—and particularly extreme flows—on annual salmon redd distributions. geist and dauble (1998) examined the role of river geomorphology and its interaction with microhabitat variables in explaining chinook salmon redd distributions, but their contrasts were different rivers. chapman et al. (1986) examined the influence of flow on annual variation in the morphology and density of chinook salmon redds on the columbia river, but their study was carried out at a single location. the findings from these studies should arguably be compared with caution, as the species and riverine hydrol- ogy can vary significantly compared with british or european rivers. using one of the longest running data sets on salmonid redds in the uk, we investigate how river flow affects the distribution of salmon redds on a british chalk stream. we build and compare statistical mod- els to describe observed interannual changes in salmon redd densities at multiple survey locations on the river frome, uk, from simple ex- planatory variables including river flow. initial analysis of redds along the river frome suggests that distribution is greatest within the middle reaches, due to the higher abundance of suitable flow conditions and habitat. we predict that low flows during the upstream and search migration phases will result in a higher redd density in the middle rel- ative to the upper sections of the river (figure 1). we also predict that as flow increases, redd density will become more uniform across the river (figure 1). to our knowledge, this is the first example of how flow conditions during the search phase of atlantic salmon spawning mi- gration may directly affect the distribution of salmon redds along a british river. our findings are important due to the density- dependent survival of juvenile salmon, which may be governed by the location of redds along the river (armstrong & nislow, 2006). our results may therefore have implications for the future recruitment and survival of salmon within uk rivers under current climate change predictions. 2 |  methods 2.1 | site description and data collection the river frome, dorset, uk, is one of 224 british chalk streams, comprising over 80 km of braided channels, and is fed primarily by groundwater upwellings from the surrounding chalk and clay geology figure 1 diagram showing how the density of redds is predicted to change with distance from the tidal limit under low, medium and high flow conditions 130  |     (brunner, dennis, & girvan, 2010; sear, armitage, & dawson, 1999). the river discharge is therefore alkaline, relatively stable and seldom prone to spates or flooding (national rivers authority south western region, 1995). the river frome has seen considerable anthropomor- phic change over the past two centuries, including additions and re- movals of a number of weirs, fish passes and other modifications to river levels and discharge, such as abstraction (solomon, 2000). salmon have been studied for over 50 years on the river frome (lauridsen, beaumont, gregory, scott, & roberts, 2015). they re- produce in freshwater between november and february each year. females excavate a redd in suitable gravel riverbed substrate, into which they deposit their eggs. a description of river frome salmon redd structure and function (compared with those in other rivers) is given in crisp and carling (1989). male(s) then fertilises the eggs after which the female buries them. algae and aquatic macrophytes grow slowly in the cold winter water temperature in the river frome so that redds can be identified from the river bank by their size and presence of clean (i.e. recently disturbed) gravel (riedl & peter, 2013). 2.2 | redd surveys river frome salmonid redd surveys (hereafter redd surveys) were started by river wardens in the 1950s to monitor salmonid stocks. initially, these surveys were irregular and inconsistent. since the 1980s, however, the centre for ecology and hydrology and the environment agency, with the support from the river frome, piddle and west dorset fishing association and the weld estate, have carried out comparable salmonid redd surveys throughout the river frome, from headwaters near cattistock (section 14 in figure 2) downstream worgret (section 0 in figure 2). redd surveys were carried out in january or february, dependent on conditions. two surveyors, equipped with polarised lenses, counted the number of redds within each survey section and estimated their ﻿paary et pal length, width and the cleanliness of riverbed gravel, an indication of the age of the redd. the location of each salmonid redd was recorded; approximate locations were recorded on maps from 1980 to 1992, while the actual location of each redd was recorded on a handheld global positioning system for surveys after 2000. maps indicating ap- proximate redd locations were digitised and georeferenced, allowing the longitude and latitude of each redd to be extracted. up to a total of 29 survey sections were surveyed in any 1 year (figure 2), although the proportion of sections surveyed in each year varied from 20% to 93% (mean 53%). redds more than 110 cm wide were deemed to be salmon redds, whereas redds less than 110 cm wide were noted as trout (wessex water authority, 1987). trout redds were omitted from analysis and redd density was calculated as the number of salmon redds divided by the length of the survey section. we calculated two types of explanatory variables for our analysis. distance from tidal limit (in kilometres) of survey section start and end points was calculated by hand using qgis software (www.qgis. org) and later verified by the online mapping system magic (magic. defra.gov.uk). the uk environment agency has recorded flow at east stoke on the river frome every 15 min since 1965 (es on figure 2; see nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/44001). flow measured at east stoke was highly correlated with flow measured at louds mill, a flow gauge station located approximately 20 km upstream (lm on figure 2; pearson’s r = .75, confidence intervals: 0.74–0.77), con- firming that flow measured at east stoke is representative of flow elsewhere in the catchment. two flow variables were calculated for this analysis, chosen to represent the critical flow conditions avail- able for spawning migration, shown to be an important determinant of migration success (e.g. thorstad et al., 2008; warren et al., 2015): (i) mean flows—average flow per year based on mean daily flow be- tween 1 october to 31 december each year and (ii) high flows—the number of days between 1 october and 31 december that the daily flow exceeded the q75 flow calculated for the same period in each figure 2 map showing the redd survey sections on the river frome, dorset, uk. major settlements wareham, wool and dorchester are shown in grey. black dots indicate the start and end points of each survey section. black circles are locations of flow gauging stations east stoke (es) and louds mill (lm) ﻿paary et pal year. the precise details of these variables, for example the dates, were agreed after extensive consultation with local experts about the patterns of spawning salmon migration (fig. s1). these two flow variables were highly correlated (pearson’s r = .923) and were thus explored in separate models analysing the effect of flow on redd density. 2.3 | data analysis a total of 16 years of redd surveys between 1980 and 2014 were chosen for analysis (table 1). these 16- year surveys were taken from a larger data set of 22 years between 1957 and 2014 because they were surveyed using comparable methods and had the most complete redd survey and river discharge records. plots of these redd density against distance from tidal limit are presented for these years in fig. s2. of these 16 representative years, 5 years (1983, 1985, 2007, 2008 and 2012) were both high flow years and years in which less than 50% of the sections were surveyed. to test whether inclusion of these years biased our results, we repeated our analysis excluding them and report the results in the supporting information. not all sections were surveyed in all years and the pro- portion of survey sections surveyed varied from 20% (1985) to 94% (2014; table 1). overall, however, more than 70% of sections were surveyed in each year (table 1) and the number of missing section surveys tended to decrease with increasing distance from the tidal limit and increase with increasing flow (fig. s3). linear mixed- effects models were constructed within the statis- tical software package r (version 3.2.1, r core team, 2015). models tested whether redd density varied with distance from tidal limit be- tween years and whether this distribution of redds was affected by     |  131 flow during the previous year. the models compared are shown in table 2. the saturated model was the following: y ∼ αi + β1dist + β2dist 2 2 + β3flow + β4dist × flow + β5dist × flow + ϵ where y is redd density during january/february, dist is distance from tidal limit (in km), flow is either mean flows or high flows, αi is a random intercept for year i that is gaussian distributed with mean 0 and variation year to account for variation in redd density between years that could σ2 not be explained by our explanatory variables, βj ∈ [β1, … ,βj] is a coef- ficient relating the explanatory variable j to y and ϵ is a gaussian error term with mean 0 and variation σ2. we assumed a gaussian error term despite the possibility that could predict negative (<0) redd densities be- cause it is more commonly used than a truncated gaussian distribution, such as the gamma distribution. in practice, negative redd densities were predicted only in the uppermost sections of the catchment. explanatory variables were standardised before entering the model. dist and flow were divided by their standard deviation cal- culated for all years combined; dist2 was then calculated as the dist raised to the power of 2. we standardised the explanatory variables to ensure the stability of coefficient estimates and thus the comparison of their effects on the response variable. the models were fit by maximum likelihood using r package lme4, the estimated coefficient p values were calculated using satterthwaite’s approximations implemented in the r package lmertest, and the con- ditional and marginal r2 values were calculated using the method of nakagawa and schielzeth (2013) implemented in r package piecewis- esem. there is no “best practice” method to calculate standard errors for linear mixed- effects models and so we present model fits without standard error bands. table 1 summary of redd, flow and survey site data each survey year, and an indication of whether it was considered a “high flow year” mean daily flow m3 s−1 survey year october–december january–february percentage of sites surveyed total redds high flow year included in analysis 1980–1981 1982–1983 1983–1984 1985–1986 1988–1989 1991–1992 2001–2002 2004–2005 2005–2006 2007–2008 2008–2009 2009–2010 2010–2011 2011–2012 2012–2013 2014–2015 5.14 7.28 3.97 4.00 3.57 5.78 4.04 4.33 5.91 5.97 5.58 6.88 4.34 2.94 10.82 4.60 5.41 8.05 9.34 9.71 3.65 3.72 6.40 4.55 4.25 8.90 8.24 8.03 6.86 3.41 12.67 6.68 87 87 40 20 76 73 93 47 80 37 40 67 67 93 33 94 376 139 101 67 308 167 335 189 345 141 237 182 129 492 60 256 n n y n n n n n n y y n n n y n y y n n y y y y y n n y y y n y 132  |     ﻿paary et pal table 2 a table presenting the maximum- likelihood model comparison statistics comparing fits for models in which flow is measured as mean flows: the mean daily flow from october to december in the year previous to the redd survey. the table is ordered by difference in akaike information criteria (daic) from the “top- ranked” model (i.e. the model with the lowest aic). marginal and conditional r2 were calculated according to the method of nakagawa and schielzeth (2013) model name quaddfint quaddf lindf lindfint lind model terms dist, dist2, flow, dist × flow, dist2 × flow dist, dist2, flow dist, flow dist, flow, dist × flow dist model fit sigma 3.33 3.37 3.73 3.73 3.73 comparison r2 loglik −775.0 −778.4 −805.6 −805.3 deviance 1,550.0 1,556.8 1,611.2 1,610.6 aic 1,566.0 1,568.8 1,621.2 1,622.6 −807.4 1,614.8 1,622.8 daic 0 2.74 55.20 56.52 56.80 marginal conditional .26 .24 .10 .10 .07 .34 .33 .17 .16 .17 3 |  results we fitted and compared five models explaining interannual differ- ences in salmon redd distribution along the river frome that used lin- ear and quadratic combinations of distance from tidal limit and mean flows during the “upstream phase” of the salmon migration period. both linear and quadratic terms were included in analysis due to the curvilinear nature of redd density across the river frome (figure 1). final models were chosen based on factors including akaike informa- tion criteria (aic) and conditional and marginal r2 values. comparing the models by aic suggested that the saturated model (quaddfint in table 2) was the “top- ranked” model. this model included linear terms for distance and mean flows and their interaction and a quadratic term for distance and its interaction with flow (table 2). the difference in aic (daic) between the “top- ranked” model and the second- ranked model (the same model omitting the interaction between distance and flow; quaddf) was 2.74, which exceeds the oft- cited threshold value of 2 aic points (e.g. burnham & anderson, 2003) indicating a substantially better model, but not the more conservative threshold of 6 points (e.g. richards, 2005). moreover, the interaction between distance and mean flow in model quaddfint was judged to be statistically significant (t280.19 = 1.98, p < .05; figure 3a; table s1) by satterthwaite’s approximation. this suggests that mean flow may affect the distribution of redds within the river frome. as this inter- action was statistically significant, we retained the lower order mean flows term even though it was not statistically significant (figure 3a). residuals from the “top- ranked” model were approximately normally distributed, suggesting that our assumption of gaussian errors was appropriate (fig. s4). random year effect estimates generally overlapped zero (figure 3b). estimates for 2 years, however, were substantially differ- ent to zero; that is, their standard errors did not overlap zero, sug- gesting that the random effect was non- negligible. moreover, the assumption that the random effect was gaussian was supported; the estimated year effects conformed to a theoretical gaussian distribution (fig. s5). marginal effect plots of each term suggested a concave quadratic relationship between redd density and distance (a positive effect of distance together with a negative effect of distance- squared; figure 4), which was modified by a weakly convex quadratic relationship be- tween redd density and the interaction between distance and flow (a negative effect of distance by flow together with a positive effect of distance- squared by flow; figure 4). combined, these relationships suggest that redd density was highest at intermediate distances from the tidal limit under low flow and more evenly distributed throughout the river during high flow. plotting model fits to the observed redd densities ordered by increasing annual critical flow appear to support this pattern (figure 5). we repeated this analysis using high flows as the measure of flow. for these models, the saturated model (quaddfint in table 2) was again the “top- ranked” model, although the daic between this and the second- ranked model was slightly lower than for the models using mean flows as the measure of flow (table s2). unlike the “top- ranked” model for mean flow, no significant relationship between high flows and redd density was observed; none of the terms including flow were statistically significant by satterthwaite’s approximation (table s2). we repeated the analyses using mean flows and high flows as the measures of flow but omitted years with low survey coverage, namely years 1983, 2007, 2008 and 2012. for both measures of flow, the “top- ranked” model was the model including the quadratic effect of distance and the effect of flow but not including their interaction, that is, model quaddf (tables s3 and s4). again, however, the daic be- tween the “top- ranked” and second- ranked models was lower than for the models including all data, as were the marginal and conditional r2 values, despite the additional variance present in the full data sets. 4 |  discussion our analysis suggests that river flow limits the upstream distance that salmon can migrate to spawn and that low flows cause aggre- gated spawning in the middle sections of the river, with potentially ﻿paary et pal     |  133 figure 3 caterpillar plots showing maximum- likelihood estimates of (a) the fixed effects and (b) the random effect for the “top- ranked” model. points are the estimates; lines are the estimate standard errors; labels are the estimate values followed by an indication of their statistical significance, whereby: ***p < .001, **p < .01 and *p < .05. explanatory variable definitions are as follows: dist_std = standardised distance; dist2_std = standardised distance- squared; flow_std = standardised flow; dist_flow_ std = standardised distance and flow interaction; dist2_flow_std = standardised distance- squared and flow interaction. as flow and distance were standardised, no units are specified for these variables detrimental consequences for emerging fry subject to strong density- dependent competition (armstrong et al., 2003; beall, dumas, claireaux, barriere, & marty, 1994). to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate an interannual effect of flow on redd distribu- tion in a uk chalk stream. this relationship was detected despite the relatively stable flow conditions in our groundwater- fed study river. the effect of flow on salmon redd distribution within freshet rivers may be far greater than those experienced in chalk streams, such as the river frome. compared with years of high flow, we found that the difference in redd density between the middle and upper sections of the river was accentuated in years when river flow was low during the search phase of spawning migration, taken to be 1 october to 31 december on the river frome. this was characterised by a pronounced humped (or quadratic) relationship between redd density and distance in the middle river sections, which might represent spawning aggregations. conversely, we found that relative to years of low flow, the difference in redd density between the middle and upper sections of the river was smaller. redds were more evenly distributed throughout the river, and the quadratic relationship between redd density and distance was less pronounced in years of higher flow. furthermore, when we re- peated our analysis omitting years of limited survey coverage due to high flows, the “top- ranked” models omitted the distance–flow inter- action, providing circumstantial evidence that the distance–flow in- teraction captured the difference in patterns of redd density between high and low river flow years. the increased redd density observed within the middle reaches under low flow may have occurred due to two factors. under extreme low flow, potential barriers to migration may have become difficult to pass, leading to aggregations directly downstream. salmon gather- ing below various weirs along the river frome has been documented since 1913 (solomon, 2000). aggregation below power stations, weirs and other barriers have also been documented across europe, and the ability to pass these barriers within the river can be exacerbated under low flow (klett et al., 2013; thorstad, økland, kroglund, & jepsen, 2003; ugedal et al., 2008). secondly, tributaries used for spawning and upstream passage might become unfavourable under low flow, resulting in an increase in individuals within the middle reaches of the main river. studies on the tay and dee in scotland suggest that higher water discharge towards the period of final spawning migration allows salmon to access spawning tributaries that are otherwise inac- cessible because of insufficient water (webb, 1989; webb & hawkins, 1989). assuming that these salmon construct redds in these other- wise inaccessible tributaries, these results would support our finding 134  |     ﻿paary et pal figure 4 line plots showing the marginal effects of each of the explanatory variables: dist_std = standardised distance;

isaak, wollrab, horan, & chandler, 2012). from the perspective of our findings, the forecast extreme flow events and their effect on salmon spawning behaviour could have significant negative impacts on spawning success. one feasible negative outcome could be large spawning aggregations due to sus- tained low flows during the search phase of migration would result in a highly competitive environment for emerging fry (jonsson, jonsson, & hansen, 1998). another potential negative outcome might be that high flows during the search phase of migration facilitate salmon entry into upstream spawning habitat that subsequently dries out under drought conditions, resulting in unsuccessful redds (becker, neitzel, & abernethy, 1983; reiser & white, 1983). any effect of flow on redd distribution might cause a shift in the behaviour and ultimately survival of juvenile parr. previous research on parr survival and movement in the river frome revealed that some parr move past the smolt monitoring station in autumn (october– january) prior to the main spring smolt migration between march and may (ibbotson et al., 2013). while parr that remain in their natal river site have a higher probability to smoltify with increasing distance up- stream, it is currently unknown whether autumn migration make a sig- nificant contribution to spawning stock and success (riley, ibbotson, & beaumont, 2009). under extreme low flow, a higher proportion of redds might occur within the middle reaches, which might lead to a higher proportion of autumn migrating parr. moreover, competition for limited resources in the middle to lower reaches of the river might increase during low flow years, with detrimental consequences for in- dividual parr survival. a significant challenge in this study was to decide how best to rep- resent flow conditions, so that they accurately corresponded to the search time frame of southern uk salmon. to avoid subjectivity, we followed expert opinion to define the period of final migration and summarised the flow data for that period in two ways: (i) mean flows and (ii) high flows, supposed to represent mean and extreme flow events respectively. we repeated our analyses with each measure of flow separately. we found that the models including the distance– flow interaction were “top- ranked” for both measures of flow. the most parsimonious explanation for this finding is that the two vari- ables were highly related; that is, they were measuring the same effect. ﻿paary et pal     |  135 figure 5 scatter plots showing observed redd densities as a function of standardised distance from the tidal limit. each panel represents a different year characterised by a measure of mean daily flow from 1 october to 31 december, and panels are ordered from low (top left) to high (bottom right) flow. lines are the “top- ranked” model fits. as flow and distance were standardised, no units are specified for these variables indeed, the pearson’s correlation coefficient between the variables was >.9. nevertheless, it is reassuring that the “top- ranked” models with two highly—but not perfectly—related variables included the distance–flow interaction, particularly as these “top- ranked” models were not different from the second- ranked models at the more con- servative daic level of 6 (richards, 2005). although we have taken care to ensure our findings are robust, we acknowledge some study limitations, several of which relate to pitfalls in redd surveying methods. regarding the statistical analysis, we used aic for model selection, which can favour more complex models com- pared with, for example, bayesian information criteria (bic; burnham & anderson, 2003). we argue that more complex models will better capture the reality of redd distribution patterns. thus, reality should be favoured over parsimony and aic over bic. moreover, we argue that aic should be preferred when the possibility of making false- negative result is considered more harmful than the possibility of making a false- positive result, which we consider the case with this small but valuable data set. we had a limited number of predictors to explain the interannual patterns of salmon redd density, primarily because data on other factors are limited or have not been collected. for example, locations of groundwater upwellings are believed to influence redd site selection (saltveit, 2013) and sedimentation may also affect redd success, but we do not have these data for the river frome. aside from the statistical limitations of our findings, there are some well- known issues with redd surveys that deserve mention. first, there is growing evidence that multiple males and females are in- volved in spawning on any individual redd and that individual fish can construct multiple redds, frequently >1 km apart (taggart, mclaren, hay, webb, & youngson, 2001). second, redd superimposition (the construction of one redd over another) was not uncommon in the girnock burn, a tributary of the river dee in scotland (taggart et al., 2001). finally, there are several issues that question the accuracy of redd surveys. they are measured without an assessment of their asso- ciated uncertainty (e.g. dunham, rieman, & davis, 2001). a number of factors may affect a redd census such as the redd age, size and colour, the vegetation cover in the survey section and observer experience. most importantly, the river depth, flow and turbidity are also thought to affect the survey accuracy. to investigate the possible effect of flow conditions on redd survey accuracy, we repeated our analyses omit- ting low survey coverage years, which tended to occur in high flow years. we found that the top- ranked models for these reduced data omitted the distance–flow interaction. while this could be interpreted as evidence for the importance of the interaction term to describe the difference in redd distributions in low and high flow years, it does not clarify the potential bias from poor survey accuracy because low survey coverage is confounded with high flows. to better understand this potential bias requires further work. in the meantime, we hold some confidence in the accuracy of the redd survey data because it is often significantly correlated with spawner abundances (beland, 1996; dunham et al., 2001; gallagher & gallagher, 2005). 136  |     while our study focused on a single uk chalk stream, and a sin- gle species, atlantic salmon, we feel that our results could generalise to other systems and fish species. there are several fish species that undertake spawning migrations, including diadromous species, such as salmon and sea_trout (salmo_trutta) that migrate between fresh- and sea waters, and potamodromous species, such as european grayling (thymallus_thymallus) that migrate within the freshwater only. we see no reason why migrations of these species could not also be influenced by flow conditions. indeed, for some species, such as the european grayling, the effects of flow on recruitment might be more severe than for salmon because they construct comparatively shallow redds that will be less resilient to extreme events which may further increase their highly variable recruitment (crisp, 1996; ibbotson et al., 2001). we believe our results can also be generalised to other systems, that is rivers. chalk streams are fed by groundwater upwellings and have stable flow regimes compared with rain- fed rivers. that we were able to detect an effect of flow on redd distributions in a stable southern uk chalk stream suggests that the effects of flow on the search phase of salmonid migration might be more pronounced on rain- fed rivers. 5 |  conclusion in conclusion, this study has—for the first time—revealed the multi- annual effect of flow conditions on chalk stream salmon spawning behaviour. our results suggest that under low flow, densities become aggregated within the middle reaches which could have a negative impact on juvenile survival and overall recruitment. as human popu- lations continue to grow, balancing the abstraction needs of the uk with the flow requirements of salmon, all under increased climate change, is an issue which will need to be addressed if we are to pre- serve this ecologically and economically important species. managing habitat and potentially removing weirs still present on the frome may also improve the movement of spawning salmon upstream, leading to fewer spawning aggregations under extreme low flow. our findings could also be used to revise current abstraction practices during this key migration period, to improve the spawning success of salmon and other salmonids under adverse flow conditions and potentially aid in future conservation of atlantic salmon within the river frome and other chalk stream rivers. acknowledgements we thank nicole caetano and andy martin of the uk environment agency, and dylan roberts, william beaumont and luke scott of the game & wildlife conservation trust. this work was part funded through an eu knowledge economy skills scholarships grant awarded to elinor parry. references armstrong, j. d., kemp, p. s., kennedy, g. j. a., ladle, m., & milner, n. j.
