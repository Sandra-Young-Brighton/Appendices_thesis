(1969) related substrate composition to bluegill fry abundance in an ohio pond. two biotelemetry studies also addressed bluegill spawning; weimer (2004) investigated blue- gill habitat use during spawning in a south dakota lake while paukert & willis (2002) determined bluegill use of vegetation types during spring and early summer in a nebraska lake. however, we found limited information speciﬁcally related to bluegill nest site selection. according to krebs (1985), factors affecting reproductive habitat selection are poorly understood. selection of appropriate spawning habitat could inﬂuence survival during early life history and subsequent recruitment. gunn (1995) suggested that spawning site selection may inﬂuence egg survival of lake_trout (salvelinus_namaycush). thus, the objective of this study was to identify nesting habitat selected by bluegill in a south dakota glacial lake. study area lake cochrane is a 144-ha natural lake of glacial origin in deuel county in northeastern south dakota near the minnesota border. this lake is relatively clear, ranking in the upper 15% of 111 south dakota lakes in secchi depth trophic state indices (stueven & stewart 1996). the lake has a maximum depth of 7.3 m, mean depth of 4.0 m and a shoreline development index of 464 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00178.x 1.4 (stukel 2003). the submergent vegetation com- munity consists of chara spp., ranunculus longirostis and utricularia vulgaris (stukel 2003). during mid- summer, submergent vegetation coverage is approxi- mately 30%. the ﬁsh community consists of largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides), bluegill, green sunﬁsh (lepomis cyanellus), hybrid sunﬁsh (l. macrochirus · l. cyanellus), black crappie (pomo- xis nigromaculatus), walleye (sander vitreus), nor- thern pike (esox lucius), yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), common carp (cyrinus carpio), black bullhead (ameiurus melas) and white sucker (cato- stomus commersoni). materials and methods in early june 2005, the entire shoreline was inspected to visually locate bluegill spawning colonies. nesting ﬁsh were collected from each colony by angling for species identiﬁcation and were then released. nesting colonies where at least ﬁve bluegills were caught were then considered bluegill nesting areas. one week later, habitat characteristics at each nesting colony were measured according to the methods described by pope & willis (1997). water depth (m), secchi depth (m), surface water tempera- ture (°c), shore gradient (m), dissolved oxygen )1), distance to shore (m), substrate ﬁrmness (mgæl (cm), maximum fetch (distance to farthest shore in m), south fetch (distance to the south shore in m), distance to deep water (distance from site to the 4.6 m depth contour) and vegetation height (cm) were measured. dissolved oxygen and water temperature were recor- ded once at approximately the centre of each spawning colony near the surface using a yellow springs instrument (ysi) (yellow springs, oh, usa) 85 meter. shore gradient was measured by the decline in elevation (m) 5 m from shore. substrate was classiﬁed as muck (a mixture of silt and decaying vegetation), sand, gravel or rock. vegetation type was subjectively classiﬁed as no vegetation present, submergent veget- ation, live emergent vegetation, dead emergent veget- ation or woody debris. vegetation density was visually categorised by an approximate 1-m circle around each nest or random location as low, medium, high or no vegetation present. low density was categorised by the ability to see the bottom through interstitial spaces between vegetation. medium density was categorised by a more limited ability to see the bottom through interstitial spaces between the vegetation. high density was categorised by inability to see the bottom. substrate ﬁrmness was determined by using a 9.3-kg weight placed on top of a 32-mm diameter pole and measuring the distance the pole sank into the substrate (mitzner 1987). distance to deep water was measured bluegill spawning colony habitat characteristics as the distance from the centre of the spawning colony to the 4.6-m depth contour. in lake cochrane, vegetation typically grows to 4.3-m depth contour and rarely exceeds the 4.9-m depth contour. the 4.3- and 4.9-m depth contours thus were averaged (i.e., 4.6 m) to determine the distance-to-deep-water depth. global positioning system (gps) coordinates were entered into arc view gis 3.3 (environmental systems research institute, inc., redlands, ca, usa) to measure these distances. similarly, gps coordinates and arc view gis 3.3 were used to determine the maximum fetch and south fetch for each site. all the habitat characteristics measured at each colony were also determined at 75 randomly selected sites at the 0.8-m depth contour. we systematically spaced 225 selected sites around the perimeter of the lake with arc view gis 3.3. then, microsoft excel random number generator was used to randomly select 75 sites. the 0.8-m depth contour was selected a priori because scott & crossman (1973) reported that as the approximate depth of bluegill nests. a kolmogorov–smirnov test was used to determine if signiﬁcant differences existed between nesting and random sites for cumulative frequency distributions of the continuous-data variables. for categorical varia- bles, a chi-square test of homogeneity was used for statistical analysis. results in lake cochrane, we located 15 bluegill-nesting colonies; seven of those sites also were selected random sites. colonies were located along much of the lake shoreline (fig. 1), excluding the shallow south- western bay. water depths at spawning colonies ranged from 0.8 to 1.3 m with a mean depth of 1.0 m (se ¼ 0.04). all colonies were located in live submergent vegetation. lower signiﬁcantly bottom substrate type was signiﬁcantly different at spawning colonies compared with the 75 random sites (v2 ¼ 25.8, p < 0.0001). all nesting sites were located on gravel substrate while only 29% of the random sites had gravel substrate (fig. 2). vegetation (v2 ¼ 19.7, density was p ¼ 0.0002) at nesting locations. all bluegill colonies occurred in low vegetation density, which accounted for only 39% of random sites that we measured (fig. 3). substrate ﬁrmness was indexed at 0 cm of penetration at all nesting sites, which was signiﬁcantly different than random sites [kolmogorov–smirnov statistic (ksa) ¼ 2.1, p ¼ 0.0004; table 1, fig. 4]. bluegills also nested in areas with a signiﬁcantly (ksa ¼ 1.6, p ¼ 0.02) dissolved oxygen different distribution (table 1, fig. 5). vegetation height, distance to shore, shore gradient, secchi depth, 465 gosch et al.  s e t i s f o r e b m u n 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 20 10 0 fig. 1. locations

(mgæl and random sites in lake cochrane, south dakota. )1) at bluegill nesting studies. bluegills commonly nest at depths from 0.2 to 1.2 m, but spawning depths to 3.3 m have been documented (carlander 1977). other centrarchids demonstrate a wide range in depths selected for spawning. gross & nowell (1980) found that rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) nests were located in 0.5- to 0.8-m depths in an ontario lake. largemouth bass nest at depths between 0.2 and 5.5 m, with depths 467 gosch et al. from 0.3 to 1.3 m being most common (heidinger (micropterus dolomieu) 1975). smallmouth bass spawned at a depth of 0.4 m in an ohio stream (winemiller & taylor 1982). in lentic habitats, smallmouth bass commonly nest between 0.3 and 1.0 m, but nests have been found as deep as 6.1 m (coble 1975). similarly, spotted bass (micropterus punctulatus) nests have been documented as deep as 6.7 m, with deepest nests in clear water along steep shorelines (vogele 1975). substrate composition, ﬁrmness and vegetation density were related to bluegill nesting locations in lake cochrane. every colony that we located was on hard-bottomed gravel with relatively low-density chara spp., suggesting that this was the preferred habitat for bluegills in lake cochrane. perhaps these gravel areas maximise bluegill survival during early life stages. stevenson et al. (1969) found that small gravel and sand sites yielded the most bluegill fry in an ohio farm pond. bain & helfrich (1983) suggested interstitial spaces in gravel substrate provided that protection for larval bluegill. they found that mortality of larvae decreased as the proportion of nest substrate ‡8 mm increased. dissolved oxygen levels also were related to nesting locations. bluegills selected locations with moderate dissolved oxygen levels, while locations with the highest and lowest dissolved oxygen levels were not used for nesting. the random sites with the highest dissolved oxygen levels were areas with high or medium vegetation densities. we question whether the differences in dissolved oxygen levels are biologically signiﬁcant as median dissolved oxygen levels were )1 at random 2.7 mgæl sites. )1 at nesting sites and 2.4 mgæl our results indicated that protection from prevailing south winds was not important in nest site selection of bluegills in lake cochrane. ten of 15 spawning colonies were located along the north shoreline. in contrast, black crappies nested in areas that were protected from south winds in a south dakota impoundment (pope & willis 1997). however, lake cochrane is a small lake and may be less affected by strong winds than other lakes. shore gradient, distance to deep water, and distance to shore were not signiﬁcantly different between nesting and random sites. however, nests were not found in the southwestern bay of the lake. this area of the lake has a much more gradual shore gradient and greater distance to deep water in contrast to the rest of the lake (fig. 1). bluegills typically hatch in the littoral zone, migrate to the limnetic zone after yolk-sac absorption, and then return to the littoral zone after attaining larger body size (werner 1969; dimond et al. 1985). gravel substrates were available in the bay. perhaps the 468 southwestern bay is not sufﬁciently close to deep water for selection as a bluegill nesting site. all bluegill colonies were found at locations categorised as low vegetation density. however, we cannot be certain if bluegills preferred low density vegetation or if they simply reduced it during their spawning activities. weimer reported that transmittered density vegetation during the spawning season in enemy swim lake, south dakota, which supports our ﬁndings. (2004) bluegills preferred sparse substrate type, substrate ﬁrmness, vegetation density and dissolved oxygen thus were the primary habitat characteristics related to bluegill nesting colonies in lake cochrane. however, we are uncertain if similar habitat types are used at other lakes. other substrates likely would be used for spawning in a lake without available gravel (hatleli 1996). other vegetation types might be preferred over chara spp. in lakes with a more diverse plant community. perhaps nesting depth will vary with varying water clarity. ability to visually identify nests was an obvious advantage in our study; however, further research should be conducted on more turbid waters to see what differences may exist. nest site selection obviously could have substantial inﬂuences on reproductive success and subsequent recruitment of bluegill. we suggest that similar evalu- ations should occur in a variety of water body types and geographic locations. spawning habitat selected may vary with available habitat and the associated ﬁsh community in a water body. similarly, bluegill popu- lations at southern latitudes could exhibit more spawn- ing episodes than at northern latitudes. spawning habitat selected could also vary seasonally. only after more studies have been completed to assess these various aspects of bluegill spawning will we be able to fully understand the implication of reproductive habitat selection. acknowledgements statistical guidance was provided by dr dwight galster. we thank christopher longhenry and nicholas radabaugh for assistance with gis
