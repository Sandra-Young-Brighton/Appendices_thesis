(2010) showed that p. nyererei females were more attracted to live males associated with conspecific sound than to silent males. as these findings confirm a role for male sounds in courtship, we decided to test whether sound alone is sufficient for female phonotactic responses in the absence of live males. we observed female side preferences dur- ing playback, from either one of the sides or both the left and right side of a fish tank, for pairwise compar- isons between conspecific sound, white noise and no sound (experiment 1). we also conducted a separate experiment testing whether cichlids are sensitive to specific features of conspecific calls or whether the cichlids may just be responsive to any kind of sound. the behaviour of male and female p. nyererei was compared during exposure to cichlid call recordings and to white noise, broadcasted at the same peak amplitude and in bursts with the same temporal pat- tern, both played back through the same speaker sys- tem (experiment 2). methods study species is a cichlid species from the pundamilia nyererei rocky shores of lake victoria. males often defend adjacent mating territories at rock surfaces at moder- ate depths (3–10 m) (bouton et al. 1997; seehausen & bouton 1997), while nonterritorial males and females associate in multispecies shoals (bouton et al. 1997; seehausen & bouton 1997). they are female mouth-brooders, and males provide no brood 306 care (witte-maas & witte 1985; seehausen et al. 1998). all fish used in this study were f2 or f3 descendants from a wild-caught stock collected at makobe island (2º21′58″ s, 32 º55′23″ e) by mnv in 2003. all recordings of male calls were collected in the laboratory for a previous study in a standard situation in which a single male was courting a female presented inside a transparent plexiglas cylin- der (ø 10 cm) (see verzijden et al. 2010). housing conditions in single housed genders were single-species groups of no more than 19 adults of both tanks (100 9 40 9 45 cm) with sand as substrate and pvc cylinders as shelters. fish were kept on a 12:12 h light/dark regime and a water temperature of 24.5  1 °c. fish were fed six times per week with a mixture of fresh food (i.e., shrimps and peas) or dry food (i.e., cichlid pellets and cichlid flake food). recordings and behavioural observations were all made in the same experimental tank (dimensions 200 9 40 9 45 cm, water level at 40 cm), in which focal males were housed for at least 24 h before a recording session started. housing conditions and all experimental procedures described here were in accordance with asab guidelines and licensed by approval from the ethical committee on animal exper- imentation of leiden university (licence number: udec 08055). playback set-up and stimuli preparations prior to playback test, individuals were separated temporarily from their group housing tanks into small tanks (50 9 40 9 35.5 cm) with a single pvc tube for 2–3 days before testing, which is for shelter expected to increase the willingness to associate with a conspecific during the test. female cichlids were screened not to have fry or overly fat bellies and were thus in the reproductive phase in between these conditions in which they are likely to show willing- ness to associate with courting males. female repro- ductive condition, speaker locations, fish tank layout, playback stimuli and playback levels were all identi- cal to the set-up in our previous paper in which we have shown that playback of male sounds in the pres- ence of live males affects female preferences (verzij- den et al. 2010). as in our previous study, acoustic stimuli were broadcasted from two underwater speak- ers (knowles non-rohs, mr-3333-000), which were connected to an ing 32 mv, mr-333 amplifier and a desktop computer. we recorded the video and sound of each trial with an hti-96-min hydrophone connected to a jvc hard disk camera (gz-505 e). during all playback trials in this and the second response to cichlid sounds but no phonotaxis (a) (b) 01 4 9 12 17 20 23 female release left: c right: wn left: wn right: 0 left: 0 right: c trial 1 trial 2 trial 3 tank was the playback, at which we the fig. 1.

(computer-generated) randomised order for which of the three was used first, second or third in each trip- let. for each trial, we randomly assigned playback treatment to left or right speaker and determined the side of the starting speaker by tossing a coin. for experiment 1, the playback and testing proce- dures were as in our previous preference tests with live males (verzijden et al. 2010). a speaker was placed at about 80 cm from a cage (l 9 w 9 h: 13 9 13 9 41 cm), hanging in the middle of the fish tank, on both the left and right sides of the tank behind a ‘burrow’ of three stone slabs, which also served as potential hiding places (fig. 1a). each trial started by placing the female in the middle compart- ment of the experimental tank. after one hour of acclimatisation, the female was put into the cage in the centre of the middle compartment and the female was enclosed for 10 min. next, the opaque slides were removed, and recordings of the first stimulus pair were played back from both speakers (see fig. 1b). the female had to listen first while in the cage, for the whole period of 46 s of playback, after which she was released by lifting her cage. the play- back and testing procedures were identical with our previous study except for the absence now of two live males in each of the outer compartments (verzij- den et al. 2010). while verzijden et al. (2010) had tested female phonotactic responses in the presence of males, we now tested whether females would also show a phonotactic response towards conspecific calls in the absence of visual or chemical cues. females that did not enter either of the subdivided areas on the left or right side within the first minute after release were discarded from the analyses. we recaptured the female after 15 min of swimming around to enclose her again for 10 min into the cage before we started the next trial. experiment 2: activity changes during playback of cichlid calls and white noise each stimulus consisted of three of the same consec- utive single calls of one cichlid individual and three consecutive bursts of white noise of matching ampli- tude and temporal pattern. interval duration between subsequent sounds was 15 s, leading to approxi- mately 31 s of playback for one sound type, while the interval duration between series of different sounds was 90 s. the sequence of calls and noise bursts stimuli was played back once through a single speaker, either from the left or from the right side, and we alternated the stimulus order. we used 14 different stimulus sets made from recordings of 14 different individuals to perform a total of 26 trials with 12 males and 14 females. all but two of the stimulus sets were used twice: once for each sex. 308 a focal in the middle of individual was placed in a cage (the same as in experiment 1) the experimental tank before the start of the observa- tions. after 10 min of acclimatisation, a playback sequence started from one of the speakers, which were both at a distance of approximately 14 cm from the cage. as in experiment 1, the whole trial was recorded on video. one observer (ne) analysed females’ activity patterns on all videos. sounds were muted when videos were analysed so that the observer was blind with respect to the treatment. for each female, the duration of dorsal fin move- ments while stationary or actual swimming was measured when playing back the video. we com- pared the activity in the minute before with the minute after the first call or white noise burst by using fit-system software (held & manser 2005) on a palm iiix handheld computer. statistical analyses we used shapiro–wilk tests to explore the distribu- tion of our data for normality and bartlett tests for checking homogeneity of variance. binomial exact tests were used to detect differences of success in the different pairwise comparisons. we applied general linear models (family binomial) to test for side pref- erence in the different comparisons. to test for differ- ences in the number of fish responding with an increase in activity after sound exposure, we used a generalised linear mixed model with fish activity increase as

http://www.r-project.org), or sas, version 8.2 (http://support.sas.com). results experiment 1: test for female phonotaxis towards male calls in the absence of live males we were able to assess a choice of side for twelve of fourteen females through swimming towards one or the other side of the tank in each of the three trials (fig. 2). two of 42 trials were discarded: in one trial, the female remained for more than eight minutes in the middle compartment; in the other trial, we had technical problems with the equipment. females chose the side with conspecific calls 12 times, the side with white noise 13 times and the side with no sound 15 times. no statistical differences were observed in the three different pairwise comparisons: calls versus no sound (exact binomial test, n = 13, p =

exposure (males, test, n = 26, discussion the current study provides new insight into the role of sound in fish communication through two main findings. first, we showed that male sounds alone are not sufficient to attract females in p. nyererei cichlids under our test conditions. we found no evidence of a phonotactic response to just playback of conspecific calls, although we had found a response to playback of the same calls in the presence of live males in an earlier study. second, we showed experimentally that male and female p. nyererei perceive conspecific sounds as different from white noise bursts of the same amplitude and temporal pattern. the role of sound in cichlid courtship our earlier experiments (verzijden et al. 2010) sug- gest that sounds can be important for modifying mate choice decisions, but our current findings suggest that sounds alone are not sufficient to attract females in the direction of the sound immediately after an exposure to sound. we cannot exclude that a phono- tactic response could still be found for louder play- back levels, which were not in our experimental set-up due to restrictions on low-fre- quency sound transmission in relatively small fish tanks (akamatsu et al. 2002). however, as the cur- rent acoustic exposure was exactly the same as in our feasible 309 estramil et al. that previous experiment, our data do reveal live males are essential for the acoustic induction of a side preference at least for our experimental condi- tions. therefore, we believe that the first playback experiment revealed that hearing conspecific sounds from a particular direction, in the absence of a live male, does not necessarily attract female cichlids. our second playback experiment confirmed that call playback was discriminated from the white noise playback and suggests that some fish call–specific acoustic feature(s) critical for a behavioural response were conveyed to the test individuals. our data are in line with findings in other species which have shown that the attractiveness of sound is dependent on the presence of a live male (e.g., myr- berg et al. 1986; lugli et al. 1996; mckibben & bass 1998; rollo et al. 2007; zeddies et al. 2010). in some species, sounds may serve in advertising the presence and location of males, which allows females to find a potential mate. in other species, sounds may only serve a purpose after localisation has already taken place and potential mates are already in close proximity to each other. for example, males of the azorean rock pool blenny (parablennius parvicor- nus) seem to restrict sound production to when females are about to enter or already inside the male burrow (de jong et al. 2007). the sounds generated by cichlids are also restricted to the elaborate visual courtship display when females are already in close proximity. a recent associations between acoustic and visual courtship components revealed a highly congruent pattern in six species of lake malawi cichlids (smith & van staaden 2009), which was consistent with the lake victoria cichlids in our study. it may therefore be true in general that cichlid sounds are not sufficient nor essential for courtship, as sounds alone do not attract females and not all potentially successful displays are accompa- nied by sounds. screening of speaker during playback. the cross-modal correla- tive response behaviour was specific for playback of conspecific calls as their behaviour remained unaffected by white noise bursts (lugli 1997). apparently, the presence of an acoustic stimulus becomes only relevant for behavioural modification together with a visual stimulus, even when sepa- rated in time through sequential exposure (c.f. ver- zijden et al. 2010). the variable role of fish sounds in a multimodal signal is not only apparent in a courtship context, but also reported for agonistic interactions (ladich & myrberg 2006). sounds generated in a competitive context may attract, repel or be neglected, and sounds accompanying a visual display may increase or decrease the aggressiveness of the opponent (schwarz 1974; valinski & rigley 1981). a recent study on a rock-dwelling cichlid from lake malawi mbuna, (metriaclima zebra), for example, suggested that communication of aggressiveness is based primarily on visual signals with only a secondary and appeas- ing role for sounds (bertucci et al. 2010). experimen- tal exposure to sound alone did not yield any response in males of this cichlid species, sound together with a visual stimulus did trigger a response, but the most aggressive response was triggered by a visual stimulus alone (also see k€unzler & bakker 2001). multimodal signals and cross-modal influences in fish are not restricted to visual and acoustic stimuli, as there are, for example, also reports on the commu- nicatory integration of olfactory cues (e.g., tavolga 1976; mclennan 2003; lugli et al. 2004; but see ya- vno & corkum 2010). it remains to be tested what role olfactory cues play in cichlids in combination with visual signals (myrberg 1975, 1997; crapon de caprona 1982; plenderleith et al. 2005) as this could provide a possible mechanism as to how the presence of live males enhances the salience of conspecific sounds. sounds as part of multimodal signalling a modifying role for sound as part of a multimodal display in cichlid courtship is in line with observa- tions in several other fish species. male italian freshwater gobies responded strongly to playback of territorial sounds only when previously exposed to a visual stimulation through their own mirror image (lugli 1997). the more aggressive they had reacted to their own mirror image, the more responsive they were in approaching the speaker during the subse- quent playback period. lugli (1997) suggested that visual stimulation had likely induced a motivational state that made them perceptive for subsequent acoustic stimulation. in the absence of the mirror image stimulation, males even tended to avoid the 310 conclusions the current data together with those from our previ- ous study (verzijden et al. 2010) indicate a dominant role for visual displays and a modifying role for sounds in sequential phases of the courtship interac- tion in p. nyererei cichlids from lake victoria (not excluding a possible role for olfactory cues). our playback results also suggest that it is unlikely that serve in improving long-distance cichlid sounds detection, localisation thresholds. however, in addition to the suggested sequential nat- ure of communicative value of signal components of different modalities, synchronous exposure of visual and acoustic cues may also enhance short-distance recognition or signal strength through multisensory integration (c.f. hultsch et al. 1999; rowe 2002; montgomery et al. 2002; new 2002). studies on human perception pro- vide various examples of the beneficial impact of cross-modal influences of sounds on visual percep- tion (e.g., stein et al. 1996; giard & peronnet 1999; bolognini et al. 2007). our results further suggest that courting fish could be a fruitful model system for studying the role of multimodal signals and multi- sensory integration in animal communication (partan & marler 1999; rowe 1999; candolin 2003). acknowledgements we thank peter snelderwaard, jan vink and gadaris francisco for technical
