electricité de france abstract otolith microchemistry can provide crucial information to address gaps of knowl- edge in spatio- temporal ecology of fish species. however, understanding the sea- sonal variability of water chemistry and its effect on otolith signatures is needed to interpret fish movements. otolith multi- elemental signatures were used to examine the diadromous migration and small- scale movements of a tropical goby (sicyopterus lagocephalus) within a watershed in la réunion island, indian ocean. the elemental ratios sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba recorded monthly in the water of nine sampling sites varied between localities and were correlated with otolith signatures, whereas the mg:ca signature was not. the incorporation of some trace elements in otoliths was influenced by the size of fish and site where they were caught, reflecting an effect of endogenous and exogenous factors. despite these sources of variation, the elemen- tal signatures did not overlap for three river sections distributed along the 26- km- long watershed. the diadromous migration and fish lifetime movements between these river sections were reconstructed using an original process based on random forest analysis. this approach revealed distinct migratory behaviours after fish entered in the river, with some individuals progressing slowly in the watershed whereas other rapidly reached the upper localities. as adults, s. lagocephalus showed a restricted exploratory behaviour and a strong site fidelity to a particular part of the watershed. the detection of adult movement was typically only between adjacent locations and is possibly explained by shifts in local intraspecific hierarchies and/or displacement during extreme discharge caused by cyclones. k e y w o r d s habitat discrimination, individual life histories, movement patterns, otolith chemistry, random forest, river networks, water chemistry 1 |  introduction several methods have been developed to investigate fish move- ments in their natural environment: electronic tags (e.g. arnold & dewar, 2001), dna markers (e.g. manel, gaggiotti, & waples, 2005), stable isotopes (e.g. hobson, 1999) or otolith chemical signature (e.g. campana, chouinard, hanson, frechet, & brattey, 2000). thanks to their structural and chemical properties, the otoliths are an efficient tool to reconstruct the movement patterns over the entire individ- ual life history of fishes, even those of small size (secor, henderson- arzapalo, & piccoli, 1995). when fish move between habitats of different chemical signatures, some elements present in the water are incorporated in the matrix of their otoliths. hence, elemental profiles along otoliths transect can record how fish move between 834  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:834–846. © 2018 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdthese habitats (campana, 1999). for example, the sr:ca ratio has been widely used to reveal the migration of diadromous fish, relying that the sr:ca ratio is generally much elevated in the marine environ- ment than in freshwater (e.g. lord, tabouret, claverie, pécheyran, & keith, 2011; radtke, 1989). however, the incorporation processes of trace elements can be influenced by several exogenous and endog- enous factors (elsdon et al., 2008) that should be factored into any interpretation of fish movement (walther, kingsford, o’callaghan, & mcculloch, 2010). for instance, the temperature regime, food availability, growth rate or life history stage has been reported to affect the incorporation rate of several elements in fish otoliths (e.g. bath et al., 2000; elsdon & gillanders, 2002; tabouret et al., 2011; walther et al., 2010). understanding the relationship between water chemistry and otolith signatures is thus mandatory to avoid misin- terpretation related to environmental variability or physiological effects. indigenous fish species living in freshwater of tropical islands are mainly diadromous. among them, amphidromous fish species, which represent an important part of the fish diversity in insular tropical streams (keith, 2003), grow and spawn in freshwater (mcdowall, 1988; myers, 1949). immediately after hatching, larvae drift to the sea where they grow before returning to rivers (manacop, 1953). once in freshwater, juveniles migrate upstream and settle in various locations along the river to grow and reproduce (keith, 2003). some species are able to climb waterfalls, and reach upstream reaches where predation and competition are generally reduced (blob et al., 2010; schoenfuss & blob, 2007). amphidromous species can be threatened by a range of anthropogenic stressors that currently im- pact the river systems, such as habitat loss and alteration (cooney & kwak, 2013), pollution (ramírez, de jesús- crespo, martinó- cardona, martínez- rivera, & burgos- caraballo, 2009) or introduc- tion of exotic species (jenkins, jupiter, qauqau, & atherton, 2010). however, the alteration of migratory pathways is probably one of the main threats related to the loss of the ocean- stream connectivity (walter et al., 2012). by definition, amphidromous species move between the ma- rine and freshwater environments; however, there is scope for considerable movement with the stream network during the juve- nile and adult phase. partial or facultative migration is also possible as demonstrated by recent research for species that are classified as amphidromous such as awaous stamineus or gobiomorus dormi- tor (e.g. hogan, blum, gilliam, bickford, & mcintyre, 2014; smith & kwak, 2014b). this flexibility in behaviour was assumed to be related to some landscape characteristics (river flow intensity, distance from the sea, longitudinal slope of the river, etc.) that can allow larval re- tention and survival in freshwater (closs, hicks, & jellyman, 2013; huey et al., 2014). otolith microchemistry has been used for inves- tigating migrations of a large number of taxa between marine and freshwater environments (e.g. huey et al., 2014; shen, lee, & tzeng, 1998; tabouret et al., 2014). oppositely, the patterns of fish move- ments within river systems remain largely unknown (bell, 2009). several studies have detected variations in otolith microchemistry of some amphidromous fish that could be interpreted as movements     |  835 from the upper river reaches to downstream areas or to the estuar- ies (lord et al., 2011; smith & kwak, 2014b). downstream migration can be related to movement of adult fish towards spawning grounds close to the marine environment. this behaviour has been reported in several species, such as prototroctes maraena (koster, dawson, & crook, 2013), and is believed to reduce the time larvae spend in freshwater, and thus their mortality (mcdowall, 2009). however, fish movements between river reaches are not exclusively linked to reproduction, but can also be related to foraging behaviour or com- petition for food and/or territory, or caused by involuntary displace- ment due to periodic disturbances, such as cyclonic floods (lord et al., 2011). for instance, lagarde, teichert, boussarie, grondin, and valade (2015) documented upstream movements of sicyopterus lagocephalus adults that were probably recolonising their initial hab- itats after having been washed down during flood events. given the high diversity in movement patterns observed among amphidro- mous species, insights on the successive habitats crossed by indi- viduals in both marine and freshwater environments are essential to understand populations dynamic and improve conservation efforts. sicyopterus lagocephalus is one of the most widespread amphi- dromous gobies, distributed from the western indian ocean to the eastern pacific (lord et al., 2012). this small- sized species measures from 4 cm to 12 cm standard length. postlarvae recruit in the oligo- trophic coastal streams where juveniles and adults settle and feed on microalgae that cover the river substratum (bielsa, francisco, mastrorillo, & parent, 2003). in la réunion island, s. lagocephalus dominates the freshwater fish assemblages from the estuaries to upper river habitats, more than 20 km upstream (teichert, valade, lim, et al., 2014). the species shows weak preference for specific habitats in rivers, excepting during the reproductive period when the males select specific spawning habitats (teichert, valade, bosc, richarson, & gaudin, 2013). the reproduction can happen through- out the year in downstream reaches, but is restricted to the warmer months, that is from february to may, in the middle and upper reaches (teichert, valade, fostier, lagarde, & gaudin, 2014). in this study, we investigated how variations in otoliths multi- elemental signatures can help to reconstruct individual lifetime movements of s. lagocephalus within a small- scale watershed of la réunion island. the spatial congruence between otolith elemental signatures and ambient water chemistry was first assessed during an annual hydrological cycle, aiming to identify river localities with distinct elemental signatures. then, the diadromous migration and fish lifetime movements between river sections were reconstructed. sources of variability related to annual hydrological cycle, site- specific incorporation rate and fish size were carefully taken into account. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study sites fish sampling and water sampling were carried out in nine sites dis- tributed within the st- etienne river watershed, la réunion island, teichert et al.836  |     east african coast la réunion island madagascar n 500 km ) m m ( h t g n e l d r a d n a t s 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 n = a b c d e f g h i 23 20 20 20 19 20 16 sampling site 19 19 i bras de cilaos h g e bras de la plaine d f b a c sea st-e enne river sampling sites 5 km f i g u r e 1 location of sampling sites within the st- etienne river watershed, la réunion island, south- western indian ocean. the nine river sites, from a to i, were distributed along the st- etienne river and its two main tributaries, that is bras de la plaine and bras de cilaos. the bar plot indicates the mean standard length of fish sampled in each site, and bars represent the range of measures. the dashed horizontal line indicates the mean size of the 176 fish collected. n: number of individuals per site south- western indian ocean (21°5′s, 55°3′e; figure 1). the river flows over approximately 26 km from the sources of its two main tributaries, bras de la plaine and bras de cilaos, to the sea. the mean annual discharge of the bras de la plaine is about twice the discharge of bras de cilaos, that is 4 m3/s versus 2 m3/s (deal, 2011). to cover most of the spatial repartition of the species, the sampling sites were located from 1.9 to 22.7 km from the river mouth, the corresponding elevation varying from 46 to 650 m. sampling was designed to cap- ture the individual signature of several tributaries and river reaches (figure 1). the riverine habitats were overall homogenous across the nine sites. they consisted in torrential and turbulent flow conditions (i.e. succession of riffles and pools). the substratum was dominated by pebbles and boulders, which can be used by s. lagocephalus for re- production (teichert, valade, lim, et al., 2014). the salinity remained null in all river sites. indeed, no transition area with brackish water is present at the mouth of this river: the freshwater flow directly enters into the sea along a coastal dune of cobbles. 2.2 | water sampling and chemical analysis water samples (50 ml) were collected monthly at the subsurface from april 2013 to april 2014 and were processed using ultraclean protocol. samples were filtered with syringes through a pvdf filter (0.45 μm; millipore) into acid- washed polyethylene bottles, fixed with nitric acid 2% (jt baker ultrex; germany) and then stored at 4°c. samples were diluted four times with nitric acid 2% immediately before being analysed. the elemental composition was analysed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrom- eter (icp- ms; aurora elite; bruker, germany). internal standard of indium (1 ppb) was used to correct for the instrumental drift. the general performance of the procedure was checked using the certified reference freshwater slrs- 5 (nrcc, canada). although the concentrations of 20 elements were initially tracked (i.e. mg, k, ca, be, al, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, sr, mo, ag, cd, ba, pb, u), we thereafter restricted the analyses to mg, ca, ba and sr be- cause concentrations of other elements in the otoliths were below detection limits. accepted recovery of reference materials ranged from 93% to 103%. sr, ba and mg were standardised to ca (i.e. sr:ca and mg:ca in mg/g and ba:ca in μg/g) for comparison with otolith ratios. external precision for the laboratory standard was 0.7% for sr:ca, 1.1% for ba:ca and 2.1% for mg:ca. for each el- emental ratio, an anova was conducted to compare the concen- trations in water samples between the nine river sites, and then, pairwise comparisons were conducted using tukey’s hsd tests at a significance level α = .05. 2.3 | fish sampling and otolith preparation fish were sampled by electrofishing (portable electrofisher ig200/2d; hans grassl gmbh, germany) in october 2013. on each site, sampling was focused on the largest adults of s. lago- cephalus, independently of their sex, to reconstruct fish movements over long periods. selected fish were anaesthetised and euthanised with an overdose of eugenol prior to fixation in 90% ethanol. an anova was conducted on the standard lengths (sl, mm) of fish to test for differences between sampling sites. pairwise comparisons were then conducted based on tukey’s hsd test to determine ho- mogeneous groups. in the laboratory, both sagittal otoliths were ex- tracted from the fish under a binocular magnifier, carefully cleaned with ultrapure water and stored dry in 5- ml eppendorf® tubes. one otolith per fish (randomly left or right) was embedded in epoxy resin (araldite 2020; escil, chassieu, france), sectioned transversely with a low- speed saw, ground to the core using sandpaper (from 400 to 2000 grains per inch) and polished with diamond- tipped polishing powder. lastly, it was carefully rinsed with ultrapure water and dried prior to storage. teichert et al.2.4 | otolith microchemistry analysis the elemental composition (mg, ca, sr, ba) of the otoliths was quan- tified using a femtosecond laser ablation (la, ir 1030 nm; alfamet- novalase, france) coupled to an icp- ms (drcii; perkin elmer, shelton, ct). the ablation was performed from one edge of the oto- lith to the other through the core with a raster scan strategy previ- ously described by tabouret et al. (2011) at a 50 hz frequency, with a 25 μm laser beam diameter and a 5 μm/s speed. the resulting el- emental profile consists of successive measures (hereafter referred to as laser spots) distributed each 5 μm along the otolith. this strat- egy represents the best compromise to ablate enough material to detect the elements while keeping a fine spatial resolution (tabouret et al., 2011). the analysis of three certified reference glasses nist614, nist612 and nist610 (national institute of standards and technology, usa) ensured the quantification. calcium was used as an internal standard to account for any variations in the amount of ablated material and laser energy in the ablation yield. analytical accuracy was measured with the fish certified otolith reference materials nies22 (national institute for environmental studies, japan; yoshinaga, nakama, morita, & edmonds, 2000) and febs- 1 (national research council canada, canada). strontium, barium and magnesium compositions were expressed as mass elemental ratios (i.e. sr:ca, ba:ca and mg:ca) on the basis of the stoichiometry of ca carbonate (380,000 μgca/g otolith) (campana, 1999). the aver- age detection limits based on three standard deviations of the blank gas were 0.97 μg/g for 25mg, that is 2.53 × 10−6 for mg:ca ratio; 6.62 μg/g for 86sr, that is 1.73 × 10−5 for sr:ca ratio; and 0.22 μg/g for 138ba, that is 5.74 × 10−7 for ba:ca. accepted recovery of refer- ence materials ranged from 95% to 110%. 2.5 | congruence between water and otolith chemistry we assumed that the otolith signature at the otolith edge, that is the last period of the fish life, indicates the chemical signature of the site where the fish was living at the moment it was caught. a number of six consecutive laser spots from the edge of each otolith was se- lected to determine the site- specific signatures, and for verifying the congruence between otolith and water signatures. six laser spots, corresponding distance of 30 μm (6 x 5 μm), were selected because they provided the best discrimination of sites according to several principal component analyses on mg:ca, sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba ra- tios, integrating from 1 to 15 successive laser spots from the edges (supplementary material appendix a: table s1). the congruence between otolith elemental signatures and ambi- ent water chemistry was verified using linear regressions. for each elemental ratio, the mean value recorded in the six laser spots at the otolith edge was regressed against the mean value recorded in the water samples collected before fish sampling, that is from april to september. the otolith elemental ratios that were significantly re- lated to water chemistry were conserved in following analyses to determine the site- specific signatures. the partition coefficient of     |  837 elemental ratios (dratio) for each fish was also determined to assess the influence of local environment and fish size on elemental incor- poration in otoliths. these coefficients describe the proportion of trace elements in water that are incorporated in otoliths (campana, 1999) and can therefore be used to detect changes in incorporation rates between sites or according to fish size (walther et al., 2010). for each elemental ratio, a linear model (i.e. two- way anova) was conducted with the partition coefficient as response variable, whereas the sampling site and fish size (sl mm) were integrated as explanatory variables, along with their interaction. tukey’s hsd tests were then conducted to compare the partition coefficients among the nine river sites. during this study, samples of coastal seawater were not collected; therefore, the partition coefficients for the larval phase were calculated using elemental concentrations reported in a previous study (riou, 2016). kruskal–wallis nonparametric tests were used to compare the partition confidents between the marine and the freshwater phase. 2.6 | analysis of site- specific signatures to assess the spatial variability in water chemistry across the wa- tershed, a principal component analysis (pca) on the elemental ra- tios, that is sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba, was conducted using all monthly samples collected during 1 year, that is from april 2013 to april 2014. nevertheless, spatial differences in otolith composition can substantially differ from differences in water chemistry because of variations in the incorporation rate according to sites and fish size. therefore, to identify clusters of sites with distinct elemental signa- tures, estimates of elemental concentrations in otoliths were inferred from partition coefficients predicted by the linear models adjusted previously. partition coefficients were predicted for each date and site using 100 body sizes randomly generated following a uniform distribution on the interval from 40 to 110 mm, that is the range of fish size collected during the study. then, these modelled partition coefficients were applied to monthly records of water chemistry to obtain expected elemental signatures in otoliths for each site during an annual cycle, integrating the variability related to fish size. a pca was conducted on these expected signatures to determine the sites, or clusters of sites, presenting distinct elemental signatures over the year. these sites, or clusters of sites, were then used to reconstruct the individual movements. 2.7 | random forest classifier and site attribution the reconstruction of individual movements was achieved using a random forest classifier (breiman, 2001), as suggested by mercier, mouillot, bruguier, vigliola, and darnaude (2011). random forest is a machine learning method, which allows freedom from normal- ity and homoscedasticity assumptions and does not require data transformation (mercier, darnaude, et al., 2011). the random forest algorithm generates a great number of decision trees. the model prediction (i.e. site attribution) is then commonly obtained by taking the majority vote from all the individual classification trees of the teichert et al.838  |     forest. in this study, we also considered the site that got the second- largest number of votes to enhance accuracy of model predictions (see supplementary material appendix b). a forest of 500 regres- sion trees was built to predict a site for each laser spot according to the elemental ratios recorded along to the otoliths, that is sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba. to identify the signature of marine environment, we randomly selected six laser spots distributed in the central area of each otolith. the limit of this central area was defined by the pres- ence of visible metamorphosis check mark that is formed when the postlarvae return to the rivers (shen & tzeng, 2002). the laser spots corresponding to the marine larval stage were combined with the six laser spots of otolith edge to form the matrix used to train the ran- dom forest algorithm and evaluate model accuracy. the model was trained using a random selection of four edge spots and four central spots from each individual. the remaining four laser spots of each fish, two at the edge spots and two in the central area, were used to provide estimates of the prediction errors. along each transect on the otoliths, the random forest model was used to predict which site corresponded to each spot by tak- ing the majority vote from all the classification trees. however, this classical procedure sometimes results in sporadic isolated predic- tions within homogeneous sequences as sites are attributed inde- pendently of each other (fablet, daverat, & pontual, 2007). these errors in site attribution can cause an overestimation in the number of sites crossed by an individual during its life. in the context of this study, we developed a procedure for correcting this problem (see appendix sb for detailed explanations of the process and r code). the main idea is to produce sequences consisting in a minimum of three successive similar attributions to ensure the chronological co- herence of continuous sequences. in a final step, the effectiveness of attribution process was evaluated by estimating the prediction error before and after the sequence corrections using the remaining four laser spots of each fish not used for training the model. the statistical analyses were performed using the r software, version 3.2.1 (r core team, 2014), supplemented by the package “agricolae” for the post hoc tukey’s hsd tests (de mendiburu, 2014), “ade4” for the multivariate analyses (chessel, dufour, & thioulouse, 2004) and “randomforestsrc” for the random forest algorithm (ishwaran & kogalur, 2014). 3 |  results a total of 176 individuals were collected, their number varying between 16 and 23 per sampling site. the mean total length was 74.4 mm (range 41–110 mm sl), and it varied significantly between sites (anova, n = 176, f = 40.1, p < .001). overall, the pairwise com- parisons based on tukey’s hsd test revealed that individuals from the lower reaches (sites a and b) were smaller than those from the other sites, individuals from the upper reaches (sites i and e) being larger (figure 1; appendix a: table s2). 3.1 | congruence between water and otolith chemistry the water chemistry varied significantly between the nine river sites regarding the four elemental ratios (anovas, n = 108; f = 91.17, p < .001 for sr:ca; f = 19.22, p < .001 for ba:ca; f = 23.43, p < .001 for sr:ba; and f = 11.04, p < .001 for mg:ca). the highest sr:ca con- centrations were recorded in water samples of the sites c, d and i, whereas the lowest were observed in site h (figure 2). overall, the sites located in the bras de cilaos tributary (sites f, g,

while an inverse trend was observed for the sr:ba concentrations (figure 2c). the highest mg:ca values were recorded in the site h (figure 2d; appendix a: table s3). the elemental ratios recorded in the oto- lith edges were linearly related to the water composition of sam- pling sites for the 6 months preceding the fish sampling for sr:ca (figure 3a; n = 9, r² = .81, f = 29.4, p < .001), ba:ca (figure 3b; n = 9, r² = .71, f = 17.1, p < .001) and sr:ba (figure 3c; n = 9, r² = .82, f = 30.9, p < .001). the relationship was not significant for mg:ca (figure 3d; n = 9, r² = .05, f = 0.40, p = .54); therefore, this elemen- tal ratio was excluded from the following analyses because concen- trations recorded in otoliths were not directly related to the local environment. for sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba, the partition coefficients were sig- nificantly affected by the site where fish were caught (table 1). the partition coefficient of sr:ca was lower than 1 for all sites ex- cept site h where it reached a value of 2, which indicates that sr is being concentrated in otoliths at this site (figure 4a). the variation of partition coefficients of ba:ca and sr:ba presented an inverse trend between sites, revealing a gradient in incorporation rate of ba from downstream to upstream sites, especially from site a to site e (figure 4b,c). the partition coefficient of sr:ca was not af- fected by fish size (table 1; figure 4d), but the incorporation rate of ba:ca slightly decreased, whereas that of sr:ba increased, with the standard length of fish (table 1; figure 4e,f). although remain- ing in the

were inferred from water chemistry using the partition coefficients derived from the linear models integrating the effects of site and fish size. the vertical and horizontal bars represent the standard deviance. the dashed circles in colours indicate the site and clusters of sites with distinct elemental signatures used to reconstruct the fish movements 3.2 | insights on site- specific

explained variation) and revealed spatial variations of water chemistry within the watershed (figure 5a). distinct geochemical signatures were identified for two sites (h and i) and two clusters of sites (cluster of sites a- b- c- d- e and cluster f- g). for these sites, or clusters of sites, the annual variability in water chemistry did not induce substantial overlap teichert et al.    |  841

otolith elemental ratios inferred from water chemistry explained 90.0% of the total variation (axis 1: 64.2% and axis 2: 25.8% of ex- plained variation). although the general trends were similar to those reported for the water chemistry, the elemental signature of site h overlapped with that of cluster f- g (figure 5b). this change is essen- tially related to the high rate of incorporation observed for sr:ca in site h which buffers the variation in water chemistry. consequently, sites f, g and h were merged to form a single cluster (cluster f- g- h). the final clustering allowed to clearly separate the st- etienne river and bras de la plaine tributary (cluster a- b- c- d- e) from the bras de cilaos tributary (cluster f- g- h), which also differed from the upper site i (figure 5b). the elemental signatures of these localities were assumed stable enough to support robust interpretation of fish movement patterns. indeed, inferences about otolith composition integrated sources of variability related to annual hydrological cycle, site- specific incorporation rate and fish size. 3.3 | model training and attribution accuracy the attribution process was achieved using four localities: sea, clus- ter a- b- c- d- e, cluster f- g- h and site i. the random forest classifier was trained using 1,408 laser spots, 704 from the central area of the otoliths and 704 from their edge (i.e. four spots by otolith area for each individual, the total number of individuals being 176). the percentage of correct classification was on average 97.0% before the sequences were corrected, values ranging from 92.5% to 99.7% de- pending on localities (table 2). after the sequences were corrected, 3.1% of the whole initial attributions were modified (1,107 laser spots). a total of 42 laser spots (0.1% of the total attributions) were suppressed because they remained isolated after the sequences were corrected. when sequences were corrected, the percentage of correct classification raised to an average of 98.3% (table 2), and the spots corresponding to the marine period of life became clearly seg- regated from freshwater signatures (100% of correct classification). similarly, the river localities were also well discriminated, the per- centages of correct classification ranging from 94.4% to 100.0%. the number of movements estimated for fish was reduced by sup- pressing the short transitions caused by isolated predictions (i.e. 7.4 ± 5.9 [mean ± sd] before corrections and 3.5 ± 2.3 after applying the correcting process). 3.4 | reconstruction of lifetime movements all analysed specimens had experienced a marine phase before re- cruiting in the st- etienne watershed where they settled for the rest of their life. the overview of individual sequences emphasised a set- tlement phase once entering the river during which most of the fish were briefly assigned to downstream reaches, that is cluster a- b- c- d- e (figure 6). although the elemental signature of this cluster was observed for 84.8% of fish after the marine signature, some individu- als were directly assigned to the cluster f- g- h, or the upstream site i (10.1% and 5.2% respectively). for fish caught at site i, 13.9% were directly assigned to the cluster f- g- h and 27.7% to site i. moreover, most of individuals firstly assigned to the downstream reaches rap- idly reached the upstream site i, without being assigned to the middle location (i.e. cluster f- g- h). this indicates that an important propor- tion of s. lagocephalus progress rapidly through the watershed. after the settlement phase, the fish assignations were more sta- ble over the time and frequently corresponded to the sampling sites where the fish were caught (figure 6). overall patterns of lifetime movements suggested very few displacements between distant local- ities, especially between the two main tributaries of the watershed (i.e. bras de la plaine versus bras de cilaos). these movements between the two main tributaries were essentially observed for individuals caught at sites b, c and f, that is close to the tributaries’ junction and <5 km distant from each other. in contrast, small- scale movements appeared more frequent within the bras de cilaos tributary, for which the spatial dissimilarity in elemental signatures allowed discriminating sites along the longitudinal gradient. for instance, 83.3% and 81.2% teichert et al.842  |     otolith leftside residence phase settlement residence phase site a site b site c site d site e site f site g site h site

e 6 overview of the individual sequences for both sides of the otolith of sicyopterus lagocephalus after entering in the st- etienne river, la réunion. fish caught in the nine sampling sites (from site a to site i) were used to reconstruct the movements across three localities (cluster a- b- c- d- e, cluster f- g- h and site i). sites in blue colour are located in the st- etienne river or in the bras de la plaine tributary, whereas sites in orange and red are located in the bras de cilaos tributary of fish caught respectively in middle sites f and g were assigned at least once to the upstream site i throughout their lifetime. similarly, all fish caught in the site i completed at least one round trip to the middle reaches (cluster f- g- h), but these downstream movements were not related to periodic trends. such downstream movements cannot be examined for fish caught at site h because of signature overlap with the sites f and g, but the stability of attributions to the site h indi- cated that fish movements between upstream sites h and i were ex- tremely rare. this result suggests that once s. lagocephalus completed their first upstream migration, they tended to use the same migration route and did not explore other tributaries. 4 |  discussion 4.1 | otolith signatures and relationship with water chemistry the reconstruction of fish movements based on otolith signatures is challenged by the ability to detect and interpret elemental dif- ferences relating to water chemistry (elsdon et al., 2008). several studies have been conducted in tropical streams, but most of them focused on large- scale variations among river basins, or along coarse estuarine gradients (hogan et al., 2014; lord et al., 2011; smith & kwak, 2014b; tabouret et al., 2011). among these studies, few con- sidered the relationship between elemental signatures of water and otoliths (huey et al., 2014; pouilly, point, sondag, henry, & santos, 2014). low concentrations of trace elements are commonly ex- pected in coastal rivers of tropical regions where water chemistry is closely related to the substratum composition (louvat & allègre, 1997). in the present study, although 20 trace elements were initially tracked, only mg, ba, sr and ca overstepped the analytic detection limits in otoliths, and sr:ca, ba:ca and sr:ba elemental ratios re- vealed a strong congruence with water chemistry. as reported in previous studies (e.g. elsdon & gillanders, 2002), the mg:ca signa- ture recorded in otoliths was not directly related to ambient water chemistry. the mg concentration in otoliths is influenced by other factors, such as physiological processes; therefore, this trace ele- ment appears unlikely to reflect spatial patterns in the watershed (elsdon et al., 2008). for the three other elemental ratios, the re- sults indicated significant effects of fish size and sampling site on partition coefficients. these differences in incorporation rates between river sites may have been influenced by endogenous pro- cesses and local environmental conditions, including temperature, type of sediment or food availability (e.g. bath et al., 2000; elsdon & gillanders, 2002; tabouret et al., 2011; walther et al., 2010). the most obvious effect was observed for the site h where sr con- centration in water was the lowest of all the river sites and where the partition coefficient of sr:ca was greater than 1. this indicates that sr is being concentrated in otoliths and suggests that com- plex mechanisms are involved in regulating elemental deposition when some elements are in low concentrations in water. further laboratory experiments are required to confirm whether the re- lationship between water and otolith concentration can become nonlinear when a species- specific threshold of concentration in water is reached (bath et al., 2000). although the ba:ca partition teichert et al.coefficients varied between sites, the amplitude of variations was less noticeable than for the sr:ca and essentially reflected a lon- gitudinal gradient along the watershed. a similar, but inverse, pat- tern was observed for sr:ba partition coefficients. both patterns are probably related to the decrease in water temperature from downstream to upstream sites. temperature is known to have an impact on the incorporation of ba in otoliths (elsdon & gillanders, 2002), although the effect of temperature on sr and ba incorpo- ration may vary between species (bath et al., 2000; walther et al., 2010). alternatively, tabouret et al. (2011) suggested that differ- ences in biofilm composition consumed by grazing fish, such as s. lagocephalus, may induce variation in ba otolith concentration. an additional source of variability in otolith composition can be related to fish body size and developmental stage, which are gen- erally correlated with the growth rate (chittaro, hogan, gagnon, fryer, & sale, 2006; elsdon et al., 2008; walther et al., 2010). despite significant differences between marine and freshwater life stages, the partition coefficients of the three elemental ratios remained relatively similar for s. lagocephalus in comparison with findings previously reported between life stages of other species, such as the bicolour damselfish, stegastes partitus (chittaro et al., 2006). this result confirms that the change in otolith elemental sig- natures of s. lagocephalus between the marine larval phase and the juvenile/adult freshwater phase indicates a habitat shift rather than an ontogenetic artefact (lord et al., 2011). on the other hand, our results revealed that the ba incorporation was weakly, but signifi- cantly, influenced by fish size during the freshwater phase, whereas the sr partition coefficient remained unaffected. it is likely that the ba partition coefficient decreased progressively in response to the decrease in the growth rate over the fish life. although a progres- sive diet shift could also explain the relationship (walther et al., 2010), this hypothesis is unconvincing because juveniles and adults of s. lagocephalus feed on biofilm as soon as they enter freshwater (bielsa et al., 2003). ontogenetic and site- specific effects on otolith deposition are important factors to consider for reconstructing fish movements across river locations because otolith signatures can substantially differ from the direct records of water chemistry. accounting for these sources of variations, three localities within the small water- shed of st- etienne river were segregated on the basis of their water chemical signatures, which were reflected in otoliths. the elemental signatures of the downstream sites (a and b) were comparable to those recorded in sites located in the bras de la plaine (sites c, d and e) certainly because water inputs of this tributary are much greater. the upstream site i was clearly segregated from the other sites (f, g and h) located in the bras de cilaos, allowing disentangling small- scale movements of fish along this part of the watershed. despite substantial fluctuations during the annual hydrological cycle, the spatial structure was stable enough over the year to avoid signatures overlapping between the different localities. the changes in otolith signatures are thus assumed to reflect fish movements between lo- calities, rather than the temporal variability of the elemental compo- sition for a given locality.     |  843 4.2 | reconstruction of fish movements several methods have been proposed to assign localities from otolith elemental composition, but random forest classifier is particularly efficient for multi- elemental data (mercier, darnaude, et al., 2011). the high prediction accuracies reached in our study were compara- ble to those obtained with similar methods for fish in mangrove areas (paillon, wantiez, kulbicki, labonne, & vigliola, 2014). however, the attribution process frequently generates isolated unlikely predic- tions because sites are attributed independently of each other. to limit the overestimation in the number of fish movements between localities, a simple correcting process focusing on the doubtful parts of individual sequences (i.e. isolated attributions) was devel- oped. the temporal dimension of otolith sequences has also been considered in other studies, for instance using a signal- processing procedure embedded in a bayesian framework (fablet et al., 2007). overall, such quantitative approaches enable a nonsubjective recon- struction of fish movements when compared to visual interpreta- tions of otolith elemental composition (vignon, 2015). the final clustering properly discriminated a larval period in the ocean for all the s. lagocephalus specimens. this result supports previous studies that demonstrated the amphidromous behaviour of this species, without evidence of facultative marine migration (lord et al., 2011). as for most of sicydiinae, larvae die after three or four days in freshwater (ellien et al., 2011; valade et al., 2009). moreover, the steep rivers with high flow velocity of la réunion island rapidly flush fish larvae into the marine environment as they cannot resist the strong river currents (lagarde et al., 2017). steep flowing streams do not provide suitable habitats for larval retention in freshwater (e.g. huey et al., 2014) and favour marine nurseries for diadromous species (closs et al., 2013). it can be safely concluded that larvae of s. lagocephalus experience a mandatory marine phase lasting four to ten months (teichert et al., 2016). the upstream migration of amphidromous gobies has mainly been described using conventional methods based on sampling nets or electrofishing in few sites (e.g. bell, brown, & pepin, 1995; lagarde et al., 2015). these approaches provided a partial view of fish movements at the watershed scale. in contrast, otolith micro- chemistry used in this study allowed focusing on the successive habitats occupied by fish over their entire life after they recruit in rivers. in this study, the first freshwater habitats attributed to most juveniles of s. lagocephalus were generally those of downstream localities (cluster of sites a- b- c- d- e). this probably suggests that most fish need some time to complete their metamorphosis into ju- veniles (keith et al., 2008). however, a fast progression to the upper reaches was the strategy undertaken by some individuals, especially for those collected in the upstream site l located at least 18 km from the river mouth. these contrasted migratory patterns may originate from differences in the individual condition or from exogenous fac- tors, such as habitat availability or biotic interactions, that are known to affect the ability of juveniles to settle in adults’ habitats (keith et al., 2008; schoenfuss et al., 2013). nevertheless, it is important to note that the movement patterns were reconstructed only from fish teichert et al.844  |     that survived and reached a large size. some type of movements may thus be underrepresented in our study, especially those associated with higher rates of mortality during juvenile or young adult stage. movements of adult fishes within river continuum have been reported for several amphidromous species (fitzsimons, mcrae, & nishimoto, 2007; koster et al., 2013; smith & kwak, 2014a), includ- ing s. lagocephalus (lagarde et al., 2015; lord et al., 2011). however, the results of this study indicate that individuals did not appear to move much between the two main tributaries and that most showed a strong site fidelity to a particular part of the watershed during their entire lifetime. this limited dispersion of adults appears in accordance with the territorial lifestyles commonly reported in sicydiinae species (fitzsimons & nishimoto, 1990; keith, 2003). moreover, the results indicated a restricted exploratory behaviour across tributaries of the watershed because fish tend to use the same tributary when complet- ing longitudinal movements. it is likely that males are more territorial than females because they need to select a place where they take care alone for the eggs until hatching (teichert, keith, et al., 2013). however, the assumption that the males travel less frequently and/ or far than the females should be addressed by future investigations because the sex of individuals was not recorded in this present study. overall, fish movements along the longitudinal gradient ap- peared to be constrained between adjacent localities, although scarce distant displacements were observed. the hypotheses explaining these displacements are generally related to fish com- petition for habitat (fitzsimons & nishimoto, 1990), extreme cli- matic events that induce fish flushing (lagarde et al., 2015; smith & kwak, 2014a), or reproduction (koster et al., 2013; lord et al., 2011). adults of some amphidromous species move to down- stream spawning grounds probably for shortening the distance larvae must travel to the sea (mcdowall, 2009) and thus reducing the risk of mortality due to predation or starvation (bell, 2009; closs & warburton, 2016). however, the current study did not re- veal any periodic trends in s. lagocephalus movements. moreover, field surveys conducted on different rivers of la réunion island demonstrated that egg clutches and larvae of s. lagocephalus can be found more than 20 km from the river mouth (lagarde et al., 2017; teichert, valade, et al., 2013). it is thus unlikely that fish movements observed in this study were related to reproduction. once settled, adults of sicydiinae species are known to have a small territory (fitzsimons, nishimoto, & yuen, 1993), and to show a strong fidelity to their territory over the years (fitzsimons & nishimoto, 1990). displacements due to foraging behaviour are thus unlikely to explain most of the movements reported during this study. on the other hand, tropical rivers are regularly sub- jected to extreme cyclonic floods that induce sudden increases in river discharge and strongly affect the structure of fish com- munities (chen, wen, meng, cherh, & shao, 2015; fitzsimons & nishimoto, 1995; monti & legendre, 2009; smith & kwak, 2015). for instance, smith and kwak (2014a) explained the higher dis- placement rate of the freshwater mullet, agonostomus monticola, in rivers of puerto rico as a result of cyclonic floods. floods may thus explain the movement patterns of s. lagocephalus observed in la réunion island, where lagarde et al. (2015) reported adults recolonising upper reaches after flood events. despite the recur- rence of extreme floods in tropical streams, their impact on the spatial structure of aquatic fauna remains poorly documented (chen et al., 2015; fitzsimons & nishimoto, 1995; smith & kwak, 2015) and deserves further investigation. acknowledgements we would like thank brendan ebner (james cook university) and another anonymous referee for their useful comments on a previ- ous version of this manuscript. we are very thankful to everyone who assisted us in the field, especially dominique hoarau. this study was supported by the european regional development fund and the european social fund, région réunion (avenue rené cassin, bp 7190, 97719 saint denis, cedex 9), and electricité de france (22–30 avenue de wagram, 75382 paris, cedex 8). this scientific study was approved by the local environmental authorities in accordance with the certificate no. 13- 030/deal/seb/upema delivered by the direction de l’environnement, de l’aménagement et du logement de la réunion (saint- denis, la réunion). orcid nils teichert raphaël lagarde http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8873-9613 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9809-1673 references arnold, g., & dewar, h.
