klementsen et al., 2003). anadromous brown_trout stay in the natal watershed usually for at least one to several years and descend to the sea in spring after parr–smolt trans- formation (e.g. jonsson & jonsson, 2011; klementsen et al., 2003). however, seaward movements of abt have also been documented at times of the year not associated with the spring parr–smolt transfor- mation (e.g. holmes, hayes, jiang, quarterman, & davey, 2014; järvi et al., 1996; jonsson & jonsson, 2009; limburg, landergren, westin, elfman, & kristiansson, 2001; marine institute 2014; taal et al., 2014; winter, tummers, aarestrup, baktoft, & lucas, 2016). autumn de- scents of brown_trout parr to the habitats where salinity is low enough for them to survive have been recorded in irish (marine institute 2014), norwegian (jonsson & jonsson, 2009), baltic (taal et al., 2014), new zealand (holmes et al., 2014), great british and danish (winter et al., 2016) abt populations. in the baltic sea, it has also been reported that fry and parr of abt from small gotland streams (with high number of spawners and decreasing water levels during spring and summer) move to sea soon after hatching in spring and early summer (e.g. järvi et al., 1996; landergren, 2004; limburg et al., 2001). those various seaward movements of abt parallel with various potamodromous movements of brown_trout parr from tributaries (spawning and nursery grounds) into the main river or from inlet or outlet streams into freshwater lakes (reviewed in jonsson & jonsson, 2011). it is also known that immature juveniles of anadromous dolly varden salvelinus_malma may use the saline environment to colonise non- natal streams for wintering (e.g. armstrong, 1974; bond, crane, larson, & quinn, 2014). in the baltic sea, investigation on the origin of adult sea- caught trout (using individual otolith microchemistry profiles) from the gotland area revealed that some individuals showed no evidence of freshwater history, thereby provoking a hypothesis that a proportion of this popu- lation may not depend on riverine spawning at all (limburg et al., 2001). however, experiments by landergren and vallin (1998) demonstrated that successful development of brown_trout is unlikely to occur at ambi- ent salinity around gotland (6–7‰). thus, landergren and vallin (1998) concluded that the spawning grounds located at the stream outlets could, on account of the low salinity (<4‰), contribute to the recruit- ment. still, eggs deposited in such areas always face the risk of being adversely influenced by storms (landergren & vallin, 1998). annual estonian salmonid parr density surveys have detected the occurrence of brown_trout parr in several years (kesler, taal, & svirgsden, 2015) in a stream characterised by the absence (järvekülg, 2001) of suitable spawning habitat (sensu ottaway, carling, clarke, ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:209–215. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  209 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd210  |     taal et al. * 0 2,5 5 10 km figure 1 map of the study area. asterisk = ermespu stream (coordinates of the river mouth = 58°25′8.3″n 22°6′39.4″e). all the other streams marked in the detailed part of the map are known to be abt spawning streams (kesler et al., 2015) & reader, 1981; louhi, mäki- petäys, & erkinaro, 2008; jonsson & jonsson, 2011). it has been observed that juvenile abt (not trans- formed into smolt) can follow several alternative life histories in coastal areas of the baltic sea (e.g. järvi et al., 1996; landergren, 2004; limburg et al., 2001; taal et al., 2014). this study was under- taken to test whether abt display stream shifting through the marine environment (ssme) before transformation into smolt as the brack- ish water of the baltic sea (6–7‰ and less) is not an unsurpassable barrier in terms of the physiological tolerance to salinity of early out- migrating abt parr (landergren, 2001; see also limburg et al., 2001). stream shifting through the marine environment among abt has not to date been described. 2 |  materials and methods the study area consisted of the ermespu stream which is situated on saaremaa island and drains into tagalaht bay (järvekülg, 2001), baltic proper (figure 1), where surface water salinity ranges between 5 and 7‰ (martin, torn, kotta, & orav- kotta, 2003). the influence of the fresh water is very low as tagalaht bay receives marginal freshwater inflow from a few small streams (järvekülg, 2001). ermespu stream is spring fed and 3.4 km long. it has a catchment area of 4.9 km2, no tributaries and no suitable spawning habitat for brown_trout (sensu ottaway et al., 1981; louhi et al., 2008; jonsson & jonsson, 2011), as the substrate consists entirely of fine sediment (järvekülg, kesler, pihu, & lauringson, 2012). the closest neighbouring trout spawning stream (i.e. river pidula) discharges to the baltic sea 0.5 km eastwards from ermespu stream (figure 1) and has viable abt stock (kesler et al., 2015). to test whether ssme occurs, 20 abt were electrofished in the ermespu stream on 27 september 2015. the fish were killed im- mediately after capture by cervical dislocation. in the laboratory, total length (tl, ±1 mm) of all caught fish was recorded, and sex was deter- mined by visual examination of the gonad (e.g. uren webster & santos, 2015). parr status of the caught fish was confirmed by visual analysis of their parr markings and the absence of any signs of smoltification (jonsson & jonsson, 2011). otolith strontium- to- calcium (sr:ca) ratios were quantified to test whether parr otoliths revealed patterns that taal et al. indicated ssme. we aimed only to determine whether ssme occurs, and not how frequently it may occur or the possible specific sources of the parr. thus, the number of captured individuals was limited to reduce the impact of research- induced mortality upon the local population. according to miller (2011), otolith sr:ca can readily be used to iden- tify individual movements among distinct water masses as for juvenile chinook salmon oncorhynchus_tshawytscha, changes in otolith composi- tion were detected 2–3 days after a change in ambient water chemistry. similar methodology has been used in recent studies to examine juve- nile movement patterns in coho salmon oncorhynchus_kisutch, chinook salmon (shrimpton et al., 2014) and sockeye salmon oncorhynchus_nerka (walsworth, schindler, griffiths, & zimmerman, 2015). sagittal otoliths were removed, cleaned and stored dry in micro- tubes. for the chemical analysis, one randomly chosen otolith from each fish was glued sulcus side down onto a coverslip, which was then partly glued to a standard glass slide. all otoliths were ground- down manually using silicon carbide sandpaper until the core became visi- ble and finally polished. each prepared otolith thin- section was glued onto a standard glass slide and stored in a clean plastic bag for later analysis. before the chemical analyses, all otolith thin- sections were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in ultrapure water and subsequently dried in a laminar flow hood. 43ca and 88sr were quantified using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (la- icpms). an agilent 8,800× icpms with a cetac lsx213 laser was used. the laser was set to 10 hz, with a 40 μm ablation spot size, and a scan speed of 5 μm/s. a continuous line scan was traced from the core to the dorsal edge. helium was used as the carrier gas. a reference glass material (nist 612) and calcium carbonate standard (macs- 3) were analysed before and after all 20 otoliths. data were handled following the methods of miller (2007) as described in rohtla et al. (2014). the precision (%rsd) of quantifying 43ca and 88sr for the nist 612 glass was 15%. precisions for sr:ca ratios were 2%; otolith sr:ca values were corrected for this drift. the age of the sampled fish, including during the ssme (as determined by shifts in otolith elemental profiles), was determined by counting the otolith annuli. in the baltic basin the sr:ca as a tracker of fish migration is known to have positive relation- ship between salinity, water sr:ca and otolith sr:ca (e.g. engstedt, koch- schmidt, & larsson, 2012; rohtla et al., 2014, 2015; svirgsden et al., 2016). thus, we expected that individuals who underwent ssme show initial lower sr:ca levels, followed by increase and subsequent decrease in sr:ca levels. 3 |  results the otoliths of all the caught individuals had sr:ca patterns that indi- cated ssme; however, these patterns were not uniform as different strategies were employed. all the sampled trout were the progeny of abt, as evidenced by the high sr:ca values in their otolith cores (figure 2a,b,c,d). natal values (pre- ssme in table 1) were significantly lower (z = 3.57; p = .0004; n = 17 wilcoxon matched pairs test) than measurements indicating residence in the ermespu stream (post- ssme in table 1). three individuals had a sr:ca profile with distinct     |  211 natal stream values, followed by a sudden increase, subsequent de- crease, and stabilisation of sr:ca at levels dissimilar to the natal value (figure 2a). this suggests emigration from the natal stream, a brief (<14 days) residency in brackish waters, and subsequent entry to a non- natal stream (i.e. ermespu stream). two individuals had a moder- ate sr:ca peak just next to the maternally influenced region (id14 and id19 in table 1), which was interpreted as emigration from the natal stream before the environmental chemical signal reached a plateau in the otolith (figure 2c). otolith sr:ca profile revealed that another sampled individual (id 9 in table 1) can be also classified as early out- migrating fry (together with id14 and id19) due to unstabilised natal freshwater value (figure 2a). the rest of the sampled abt parr did not possess a peak in sr:ca values that would indicate prolonged brackish water residency (id1, id3- id8, id10- 13, id15- 17 in table 1), but a clear or subtle shift in sr:ca freshwater values was evident (figure 2b,d). this suggested parr emigration from their natal stream, a minimal (up to 2 days) residency in brackish waters, and then entry to a non- natal stream. parr movement to a non- natal stream through the marine environment occurred during the period between early spring and late autumn, but mostly during mid- summer (table 1). age at dispersal varied from early stage fry to 4- summer old individuals (all older individuals were milt producing sneaker- males with a parr phenotype; table 1). otolith sr:ca values revealed that some parr may have shifted between tributaries within their natal watershed (id1, id4, id6, id12, id17, id18 in table 1), before a subsequent shift to the ermespu stream via the marine environment. 4 |  discussion the collected otolith microchemical profiles demonstrated that as a life- history strategy of abt, ssme occurred with both fry and 1- to 4- year- old parr caught from the ermespu stream. these shifts were not restricted to spring, which is the typical sea descent season for abt (e.g. jonsson & jonsson, 2011). similar life histories have been previously observed in coho salmon populations (e.g. koski, 2009; roni et al., 2012). as the timing of ssme differed in parr of the same age, we sug- gest that the changes in the otolith chemistry were due to migrations between streams with distinctive water chemistry, and not because of alternating chemistry of the waters inhabited by sedentary parr or other potential factors that could influence otolith chemistry (e.g. diet, ontogeny, temperature). alternating water chemistry would imply that parr of the same age from the ermespu stream should have displayed similar otolith chemistry; however, this was not the case in the pres- ent study. otolith chemical profiles demonstrate clear stage- shifts (i.e. concentrations shift from one stable plateau to another stable plateau with significantly different values). such temporally stable “plateau shifts” in otolith chemical profiles are possible if the fish has shifted from one chemically stable environment to another as minor changes in otolith composition could be detected 2–3 days after a change in water composition (miller, 2011). same logic also applies for other po- tential confounding factors (e.g. diet, temperature). it is also important 212  |     (a) (c) taal et al.

(b) parr (id 15) with a clear shift in sr:ca values; (c) parr (id 14) that descended/drifted to the sea immediately after yolk sac resorption or even during it and subsequently entered the ermespu stream; (d) parr (id 1) that possibly migrated between tributaries within its natal watershed and subsequently migrated to the ermespu stream via the marine environment, as evidenced by increased sr:ca values. numbered brackets represent distinct stages in the chemical profiles: (1) maternally influenced region (sensu kalish, 1990), (2) natal freshwater habitat, (3) possible migration between tributaries in the natal watershed, (4) brackish water experience and (5) non- natal freshwater habitat (ermespu stream). the sr:ca freshwater threshold is <0.5 mmol/mol in the freshwaters of estonia (matetski, 2014). note the different scales of sr:ca profiles. arrows denote the annuli that several brown_trout (id2, id9, id14, id18, id19, id20 in table 1) had a clear brackish water signal in their otolith chemical profiles and it had merely taken them longer to reach ermespu stream. our hypoth- esis is also supported by matetski (2014) who analysed 257 brown_trout parr otoliths from 19 streams from different regions of estonia. all the analysed otolith profiles were stable without such clear stage- shifts (matetski, 2014). moreover, ermespu stream is a small spring- fed stream with a total length of ca 3 km and has no tributaries. it is unlikely that spatial and/or temporal variability of water chemistry in such a marginal stream has this kind of effect on otolith chemical profiles. altogether, this evidence coupled with the fact that there are no suitable spawning grounds in the ermespu stream suggests that all the sampled brown_trout had hatched elsewhere and immigrated to the ermespu stream via the baltic sea. there are several streams with viable abt populations and spawning grounds in the vicinity of the ermespu stream (kesler et al., 2015; figure 1) that could be the sources of such immigration. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence of such a life- history pattern among abt, that is immigration to non- natal streams via the marine environment. although two abt individuals (id14 and id19 in table 1) did not show natal freshwater values, the possibility that these fish may be offspring of brown_trout spawning in the baltic sea (sensu landergren & vallin, 1998; limburg et al., 2001) is unlikely in our case as ambient surface water salinity in tagalaht bay (5–7‰; martin et al., 2003) is too high for egg survival (landergren & vallin, 1998). moreover, the coastal area of tagalaht bay near stream outlets is sandy and also exposed to northerly winds which may displace the bottom substrate during stormy weather. these conditions (landergren & vallin, 1998) taal et al.     |  213 table 1 recorded biological and life- history parameters of brown_trout parr from the ermespu stream id 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 tl 193 182 173 195 154 153 184 189 169 168 151 160 204 190 180 167 160 87 90 70 sex maturity age m f f m m f m m f m f m m m f f f f f m mature juvenile juvenile mature mature juvenile mature mature juvenile mature juvenile juvenile mature mature juvenile juvenile juvenile juvenile juvenile juvenile 4 3 2 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 1 1 3 3 2 2 2 2 0 0 ssme event start iii sum. end iii sum. mid ii sum. mid iii sum. i aut./ii spr. i aut./ii spr. ii aut./iii spr. iv spr. start i sum. ii aut./iii spr. start ii sum. i aut./ii spr. mid iii sum. i spr. mid ii sum. mid ii sum. iii spr. ii aut./iii spr. i spr. mid i sum. sr:ca pre- ssme sr:ca peak sr:ca post- ssme 0.16 & 0.18 0.18 0.14 0.14 & 16 0.14 0.14 & 0.18 0.17 0.15 ns 0.14 0.13 0.14 & 0.17 0.14 early stage 0.14 0.22 0.15 & 0.18 0.17 & 0.14 early stage 0.16 absent 0.35 absent absent absent absent absent absent 0.88 absent absent absent absent 0.40 absent absent absent 0.43 0.78 0.47 0.22 0.22 0.19 0.23 0.20 0.21 0.23 0.19 0.20 0.19 0.19 0.19 0.20 0.20 0.19 0.19 0.20 0.20 0.21 0.22 tl, total length in mm. age, age at capture in years. ssme event, the estimated age and season when stream shifting via the marine environment occurred (spr., spring;

see also figure 2c) occurred during spring shortly after hatching and distance between ermespu stream and closest trout stream outside the tagalaht bay is approxi- mately 26 km. thus, it is safe to conclude that aforementioned abt individuals descended to the sea immediately after yolk sac resorp- tion or even during it and subsequently entered the ermespu stream. our results do not contradict the possibility that offspring of brown_trout spawning in the baltic sea (landergren & vallin, 1998; limburg et al., 2001) may enter “non- natal” streams in less saline parts of the baltic sea where suitable spawning substrate and shelter against storms may be found. it is known that salmonids [e.g. atlantic salmon and brown_trout (e.g. klementsen et al., 2003; jonsson & jonsson, 2011)]; coho salmon, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, steelhead oncorhynchus_mykiss (e.g. hodge, wilzbach, duffy, quiñones, & hobbs, 2016; koski, 2009; roni et al., 2012; shrimpton et al., 2014; walsworth et al., 2015) and charrs e.g. dolly varden (e.g. armstrong, 1974; bond et al., 2014; hart, bond, may- mcnally, miller, & quinn, 2015) and arctic charr salvelinus_alpinus (e.g. klementsen et al., 2003) exhibit a vast array of life histories, which differ in duration of fresh- water and/or marine rearing, age at maturation and incidence of re- peat spawning etc. it is widely accepted that salmonids imprint to their natal stream during transformation to a smolt and are known to return there to spawn (“homing”) (e.g. hansen & jonsson, 1994; quinn, 1993). therefore, it is likely that abt parr that become smolts in non- natal streams (e.g. ermespu stream), may fixate their homing to those new waterbodies. this hypothesis is also supported by hansen and jonsson (1994) who experimentally demonstrated that atlantic salmon, regard- less of their genetic origin returned the river they left as smolt. this would imply that ssme may result in adult spawning migrations to streams that are non- natal to these particular individuals. thus, in the current study, ssme would have resulted in adult trout spawning mi- gration to a stream unsuitable for spawning, indicating to a possible ecological trap. however, it remains to be determined whether ssme has an overall positive effect on recruitment by allowing to colonise unused nursery grounds in closely situated rivers or results in an eco- logical dead end (kokko & sutherland, 2001). 214  |     although the ecological significance of ssme is unclear, it may partly explain the straying behaviour documented during the spawn- ing runs of abt populations in the brackish baltic sea basin (e.g. degerman, leonardsson, & lundqvist, 2012). our results, combined with those of previous studies (järvi et al., 1996; landergren, 2001; landergren & vallin, 1998; landergren, 2004; limburg et al., 2001; taal et al., 2014), suggest that the importance of viable abt spawning rivers may be underestimated during parr density surveys, as these populations may function as source populations (sensu pulliam, 1988) for neighbouring streams and shallow brackish littoral zones (see also bond et al., 2014). furthermore, ssme of unsmolted abt (as of adults; e.g. jonsson & jonsson, 2011) may result in gene flow between closely situated streams suitable for salmonids. parr dispersal between streams through the marine environment may therefore further in- crease straying behaviour during adult spawning runs, at least in the baltic sea region. in conclusion, our findings provide new information on the life history of abt. however, as the extent and ecological significance of this behaviour remains unclear, future studies are warranted to clarify the potential impact of ssme on overall straying rates, as well as the ecological and physiological mechanisms behind this phenomenon. stream shifting through the marine environment should to be consid- ered in the context of the restoration and management of salmonid populations and their habitats, as it may affect population quality char- acteristics in different spawning streams. acknowledgements we thank rein nellis and maarja nõmm for their help during field- work. we also thank james phillips for improving the english. references armstrong, r. h.
