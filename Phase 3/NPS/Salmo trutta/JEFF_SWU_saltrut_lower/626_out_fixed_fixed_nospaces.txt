otoliths; origins; la-icp-ms introduction salmon and trout (genera oncorhynchus, salmo and salvelinus) are renowned for distant anadromous migrations, followed by precise homing and spawn- ing in natal locations (reviewed by klemetsen et al. 2003; quinn 2005; jonsson & jonsson 2011). the duration of time spent at sea and the distance trav- elled from a home river all fall along a behavioural continuum (quinn & myers 2004). marked variation notwithstanding, an ultimate consequence of anadro- mous migrations coupled with homing to natal sites is population mixing on the foraging grounds at sea and reproductive isolation among populations on the spawning grounds in freshwater (hendry & stearns 2004). as a result, multiple populations may be harvested at the same time and place when ﬁsheries occur during the ocean phase of the life history. unfortunately, a lack of understanding of population structure in mixed-stock ﬁsheries can lead to inappro- priate harvest rates that, when high enough, can drive small or unproductive populations to extinction (hilborn & walters 1992). thus, knowing the extent to which populations mix while at sea is an important step towards implementing sound management. an increasingly common approach to identify sources of individuals in mixed-stock ﬁsheries is to compare otolith chemical signatures (campana et al. 2000; elsdon et al. 2008). the otoliths, or ear stones, of teleost ﬁsh are composed primarily of calcium correspondence: g. veinott, northwest atlantic fisheries centre, fisheries and oceans canada, box 5667, st. john’s, nl, canada a1e 2h8. email: geoff. veinott@dfo-mpo.gc.ca *present addresses: school of aquatic and fishery sciences, university of washington, box 355020, seattle, wa 98195, usa †eba, a tetra tech company, riverbend atrium one, 115, 200 rivercrest drive se, calgary, ab canada t2c 2x5 reproduced with the permission of the minister of department of fisheries and oceans. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00574.x 541 veinott et al. the use of these natural carbonate held together by an organic matrix (campana 1999). secondary elements such as stron- tium (sr), magnesium (mg) and barium (ba) can be incorporated into the otolith and are reﬂective of environmental conditions experienced during rearing, which can then be used as natural tags for stock iden- tiﬁcation. however, tags requires that each stock or population displays unique chemical otolith signatures (elsdon et al. 2008). this requirement can be tested either by analysing the water chemistry in which each stock rears, or by examining the otolith chemistry of juvenile ﬁsh with known rearing histories. if differences are found among locations, then the juvenile chemical ﬁnger- print can be used as a baseline to facilitate classiﬁca- tion of individuals with unknown rearing origins. importantly, the technique can separate groups of ﬁsh that have lived in different habitats but do not vary genetically and therefore can be used on very ﬁne spatial and temporal scales. encouragingly, a number of studies have successfully employed the use of differential otolith chemistries to associate individu- als with habitat (veinott & porter 2005; lara et al. 2008; patterson & swearer 2008; walther et al. 2008; clarke et al. 2010; cuveliers et al. 2010) and to quantify recruitment patterns in freshwater recreational ﬁsheries (e.g. olley et al. 2011; ramsay et al. 2011). here, we use otolith chemistry to assess the extent that populations of brown_trout (salmo_trutta) overlap while in nearshore marine estuaries; a necessary step towards potential dispersal (i.e. straying) among populations. brown_trout exhibit anadromous (i.e. sea-going) as well as nonanadromous (i.e. freshwater resident) life histories, with the frequency of the migratory life history varying among populations and among individuals within populations (jonsson & jonsson 1993). in many regions, the marine migra- tions by brown_trout are short in distance (usually no more than 100 km from the natal river) and limited in duration (individuals often only spend a summer at sea) before ﬁsh return to freshwater for spawning and overwintering (e.g. berg & berg 1987, 1989; olsen et al. 2006). on the avalon peninsula on the east coast of the island of newfoundland (fig. 1), canada, the anadromous life history form of brown_trout, referred to locally as ‘sea_trout’, is a popular sport ﬁsh and is frequently targeted in estuaries and coastal waters by anglers (hustins 2007). given its importance as a recreational game ﬁsh coupled with the potential that non-native brown_trout, introduced from europe in the 1880s, are competing with native salmonids such as atlantic salmon (s. salar) and brook charr (salvelinus_fontinalis), is surprising that so little biological work has focused on brown_trout in newfoundland (gibson & cunjak 1986; it 542 54° 53° port rexton newfoundland 100 km 48° avalon peninsula witless bay (pierre’s brook) renews chance cove 47° 48° 47° 25 km 54° 53° fig. 1. map showing sampling locations on the east coast of newfoundland. shaded area in the insert is expanded in main map. it appears that anadromy in brown_trout westley et al. 2011). in the northern hemisphere, it is uncommon for introduced populations of brown_trout to exhibit anadromous life histories, despite populations often having access to the ocean. curi- ously, is more common in the southern hemisphere (mcdo- wall 2006), which may reﬂect closer proximity to the ocean by many populations or greater feeding oppor- tunities in higher southern latitudes (hendry et al. 2004a). whatever the reasons, the anadromous life history form of brown_trout in newfoundland, and recently detected in honda et al. (2012), are appar- ently rare exceptions to the general life history pat- terns and are not well known. as an applied issue, it is currently unclear whether, and to what extent, pop- ulations of anadromous brown_trout mix while in the marine environment and therefore are susceptible to angler harvest. in addition, the extent of natal ﬁdelity and distance of marine migrations are not known in newfoundland brown_trout. this lack of biological understanding limits both the ability to implement sound management and the ability to predict the potential of non-native brown_trout to further spread. in this article, we attempt to address these knowl- edge gaps by evaluating the stock structure of sea_trout captured in a recreational ﬁshery in eastern newfoundland. the ultimate goal was to determine whether ﬁsh caught in a speciﬁc semi-enclosed estu- ary were produced (i.e. spawned and reared while juveniles) in the river closest to the point of capture. our objectives were to: (i) create and quantify the utility of a baseline of otolith chemistry from juve- niles reared in four rivers, (ii) assign adult ﬁsh cap- tured in a potentially mixed-stock ﬁshery to rivers of natal origin using the baseline and (iii) quantify the proportion of locally produced versus foreign individ- uals captured in the estuaries of two rivers important to anglers. we hypothesised that the proportion of foreign ﬁsh captured in estuaries may be high as sea_trout in other areas extensively use estuaries and near-shore habitats during marine migrations, thereby increasing the chance of population mixing (harris & milner 2006), and because straying into non-natal areas may be atypically common during the early stages of invasion (hendry et al. 2004b). methods site description and ﬁsh sampling this study focuses on four rivers popular with anglers targeting anadromous brown_trout in eastern newfoundland, canada, and speciﬁcally on assigning trout captured in the estuaries of the renews river and chance cove brook to natal locations (fig. 1). although information is limited, there is a known migration of sea_trout out of the renews river and into the estuary (a shallow semi-enclosed body of brackish water) and adjacent coastal waters (veinott 2010). a number of other nearby rivers also support sea_trout populations. for a review of the history and current status of the brown_trout, invasion readers should see westley & fleming (2011). origins of sea_trout juvenile brown_trout were collected in 2008 from four rivers (renews river, pierre’s brook, chance cove brook and port rexton river) on the east coast of newfoundland (fig. 1). all juvenile ﬁsh were col- lected using a backpack electroﬁsher. pierre’s brook, chance cove brook and port rexton were sampled upstream of the tidal inﬂuence but within 1 km of the mouth of the river. every 5th captured brown_trout was euthanised with an overdose of clove oil  1), and from all of the euthanised ﬁsh, a (0.25 mg l random sample from each river was selected for oto- lith analyses. renews river has two natural potential barriers to ﬁsh migration; aptly named first falls and second falls, respectively (fig. 2). first falls is at approximately river km 1, and second falls is at approximately river km 4. in 2008, sampling in renews river took place upstream of the tidal inﬂu- ence but downstream of first falls, but yielded few ﬁsh (n = 6). thus, we returned in 2009 and expanded our effort the watershed to increase our sample size and to gauge variation in otolith chemistry among individuals reared in differ- ent habitats within the renews river watershed. we collected juvenile trout in locations we designated as ‘downstream’ (tidal inﬂuence to first falls), ‘mid- stream’ (first to second falls) and ‘upstream’ (above second falls), respectively and subsequently used in analyses to produce our otolith chemistry baseline. throughout harvested ﬁsh were provided by anglers from the recreational ﬁshery in the renews estuary. occasion- ally whole ﬁsh were provided but most often only the heads, or heads and entrails were collected. sam- ples were placed on ice and transported to the labora- tory where they were frozen at  20 °c. the modal 52.9° w n s e highway primary angling location big butterpot s eco n d f alls first falls 46.9° head of tide estuary 1 km renews harbour fig. 2. map of

vested in the recreational ﬁshery, but evidence of spawning marks on the scales did not occur until age 4+ (veinott 2011). despite the discrepancy, we refer to ﬁsh harvested in the recreational ﬁshery as ‘adults’ for clarity. in 2007, the recreational ﬁshery was sam- pled opportunistically, whereas in 2008 and 2009, a standardised creel survey (malvestuto et al. 1978; beckley et al. 2008; veinott 2011) was conducted. in each year, a subsample, selected to represent the observed size distribution of harvested ﬁsh across sea- sons, was selected for otolith chemical analysis. by 2009, anglers in the area were aware of this study and volunteered harvested ﬁsh from other locations including the chance cove estuary. all of the chance cove samples were analysed for otolith chemistry. the ultimate decision on sample sizes used in the analyses reﬂects a trade-off between specimen avail- ability and funding to run the samples, but is in line with other studies (e.g. patterson & swearer 2008; gibson-reinemer et al. 2009; zitek et al. 2010). otolith sampling and analyses otoliths were removed from the ﬁsh, cleaned in deionised water, air dried and placed in individual plastic vials for storage. to expose the early life growth in the adult ﬁsh, otoliths were embedded in epoxy and sectioned following jenke (2002). otoliths of both angled adults and electro ﬁshed juveniles were then mounted on glass slides using two-sided tape; only the adult otoliths were sectioned, whereas juve- niles were mounted whole with the sulcus side down. to determine trace element composition, otoliths were ablated using a geolas 193 nm arf excimer laser system attached to a thermo element-xr dou- ble focusing sector ﬁeld icp-ms. the laser was ﬁred at a rate of 10 hz and had an output energy of  2). on sectioned ot- approximately 0.15 mj (12 j·cm oliths the laser travelled across the surface of the oto- lith from the primordium (i.e. core or centre) to the growing edge along the axis of maximum growth at  1. for whole otoliths (juveniles), a rate of 10 lm s the laser was held stationary and a hole was drilled into the centre of the otolith (veinott et al., unpub- lished). ablated material was carried to the icp-ms  1 ﬂow of he, where it combined with by a 1.1 l·min  1 before a stream of ar carrier gas at 0.70 l·min reaching the icp as a dry aerosol. all measurements at the icp-ms were performed in time resolved anal- yses mode utilising peak jumping mode with 1 point per mass peak. integration time was 10 ms per mass, with a settling time of 1 ms per mass. a typical acquisition consisted of a 20- to 30-s measurement of the gas blank before the laser was switched on (back- 544 ground), followed by 100- to 200-s measurement with the laser on and material being ablated depend- ing on whether the laser was drilling or scanning. raw counts of calcium (ca43), magnesium (mg24), manganese (mn55), zinc (zn66), strontium (sr88) and barium (ba137) from the icp-ms were processed off line using lamtrace software pro- duced by memorial university (longerich et al. 1996). calcium ratios were calculated to compensate for changes in ablation efﬁciency between scans or along a single laser scan. however, normalising laser ablation data to ca does not correct for mass-depen- dent changes in instrument sensitivity that can occur throughout the day (drift) or after the instrument has been shut off and re-tuned after start-up. therefore, to compare laser data over longer periods of time, the element:ca ratios must be compared to a standard reference material. therefore, the national institute of standards and testing, standard reference material 612 (trace element spiked glass bead), was used to convert background corrected data to concentrations (parts per million). rather than treat each 10-ms cycle of the icp as an independent sample, approximately 1 s of back- ground corrected data was averaged and then used to produce a concentration for each element in that 1 s of ablated material. statically, this is equivalent to ab- lating the material for a short time, taking the average counts for that time then continuing to ablate new material. running a continuous scan or drilling (as we did with the juvenile otoliths) and dividing the counts into discrete 1-s blocks simply facilitate the analyses. sampling and analysing freshwater growth in otoliths to assign marine caught ﬁsh to a particular river requires that the otolith material that is analysed and compared be produced during a period of river resi- dency. for juvenile ﬁsh, it was assumed that no mar- ine migrations had occurred as ﬁsh were sampled at an age and size prior to seaward migrations. there- fore, all materials deposited on the juvenile otolith after emergence should reﬂect the water chemistry in the river of natal origin. test drilling in the centre of a sample of otoliths found that no transgenerational sr marks (kalish 1990) occurred within 20–30 lm of the surface of the otoliths. therefore, in juvenile oto- liths, the ﬁrst 5-s of drilling was discarded to elimi- nate surface contamination, and the second 5-s of drilling was used in the analysis. this is equivalent to approximately 5 lm of otolith material. all the harvested adults used in the study were captured in estuarine waters and as expected, each otolith revealed a distinct rise in sr concentration indicating the transition from fresh to saline waters (fig. 3). the beginning of this transition was used to indicate the end of the freshwater growth phase, and therefore, material ablated just prior to the entrance to marine waters was used in the analyses to deter- mine river of origin. ten seconds of ablation which is approximately 100 lm of otolith material was averaged to provide elemental concentrations for that portion of the freshwater growth (see fig. 3). baseline construction with juvenile otoliths and assignment of adults we used discriminant function analysis (dfa) in the sas enterprise guide 4.2 statistical software package (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa) to differentiate among chemistry of juvenile otoliths from freshwater and to create a baseline for comparison among estu- ary harvested adults. all elemental concentrations were log transformed prior to the dfa. the ﬁrst attempt to identify group membership based on otolith chemistry was carried out on the within-river samples from renews river. the classiﬁcation variable was the within-river location (downstream, midstream or upstream), and the dependent variables were the mg, mn, zn, sr and ba concentrations. prior probabilities were based on sample size, and a jackknifed classiﬁcation was computed. this within- river analysis was carried out to ﬁrst determine whether adults could be assigned to speciﬁc locations within the river, or conversely, whether juveniles from renews river could be pooled. however, after cross-validation, the dfa only correctly assigned 14 –50% of the juveniles to their collection location within the renews river (table 1). we interpreted to conﬁdently assign these results as insufﬁcient adults to speciﬁc within-river locations nor poor enough to pool the sample. therefore, we constructed the renews river baseline using the 2008 samples and the 2009 juveniles collected in the downstream  r s m p p 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 0 area

rivers (ﬁsh from downstream areas used), and because brown_trout disproportionately use the downstream areas of the renews river watershed for rearing (warner et al. unpublished data). one of the 2008 juvenile samples was dropped prior to the analyses because of its unusually high sr concentration (>1800 ppm) that was more consistent with estuarine growth rather than freshwater growth and may have been a ﬁsh that had previously resided in the estua- rine environment. the analytical approach to construct discriminant functions to assign adult ﬁsh to natal origins was the same as described previously, except classiﬁcations were based on the juvenile baseline. that is, once the initial jackknifed classiﬁcation of juveniles was com- pleted that juvenile ‘training data’ were used to clas- sify a new data set that consisted of the otolith elemental concentrations from the adult trout cap- tured in the recreational ﬁshery. each year (2007, 2008 and 2009) for which samples from the recrea- tional ﬁshery were available was analysed separately. results juvenile samples from freshwater mean juvenile otolith elemental concentrations varied among rivers but were relatively stable among sites within renews river and between the renews river 2008 and 2009 samples (fig. 4). the otoliths of juve- niles from chance cove and port rexton had the highest mg and zn concentrations, and port rexton had the lowest sr concentration. pierre’s brook sam- ples had the highest mn and sr concentrations, whereas renews river ﬁsh had the highest ba con- centrations in their otoliths. the greatest variation between years was in the mg and zn concentrations. on the basis of the freshwater juvenile otolith chemistry, the among-river dfa was able to clearly separate individuals based on their natal rivers (fig. 5a). the ﬁrst discriminant function was able to 545 veinott et al. mg mn zn 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 200 150 100 50 0 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 sr ba 1400 1200 1000 800 600

renews river from port rex- ton. with the use of a jackknifed classiﬁcation procedure, there was only one misclassiﬁcation – a port rexton ﬁsh classiﬁed as a chance cove individ- ual (table 2). angler samples from estuary ﬁsheries from the 2007 recreational ﬁshery in the renews estuary, 42 of the 45 ﬁsh analysed (95.5%) were clas- siﬁed as renews river individuals (table 3). of the three ﬁsh not assigned to the renews river group, one ﬁsh was assigned to each of the other three rivers (fig. 5b). from visual inspection of fig. 5b, the one ﬁsh classiﬁed as a pierre’s brook individual (fig. 5b arrow top right) is immediately apparent. given the clear separation of pierre’s brook ﬁsh from renews ﬁsh, it is likely this is a true migrant from pierre’s brook. the other two ﬁsh not assigned to renews river fall along an imaginary line from the bottom left to the top right of fig. 4b that seems to be a bor- der between renews ﬁsh and the other three rivers. it is difﬁcult to robustly state that these ﬁsh are true migrants from those other rivers given the variation 546 of the adult data around the renews river training data (i.e. juveniles) cluster. the amount of variation around the renews training data is likely a function of the within-river variability, observed in the within stream dfa (table 1), and that the angled ﬁsh are of different ages. the different age classes would have migrated from the river in different years which pre- sumably also resulted in some variation in their fresh- water otolith chemistry signatures. similar variation, as was seen in 2007, was observed around the dfa training data when the otoliths analysed from the 2008 recreational catch from the renews estuary were plotted (fig. 5c). however, in 2008, 100% of the ﬁsh (n = 25) were classiﬁed as of renews river origin. the 2009 sample of the recreational ﬁshery included individuals harvested in the renews estuary (n = 53) and the chance cove estuary (n = 9). for the ﬁsh harvested in the renews estuary, 96% were classiﬁed as of renews river origin. the two ﬁsh harvested in renews but not classiﬁed as of renews river origin (fig. 5d arrows) were assigned to chance cove river. in contrast, of the nine ﬁsh har- vested in the chance cove estuary, only two (22%) were classiﬁed as chance cove river ﬁsh. the remaining seven ﬁsh harvested from chance cove (a)  2 s e r o c s l i a c

there is a cluster of three chance cove ﬁsh directly on top of the renews river juve- nile cluster. the close proximity of the chance cove ﬁsh to the renews training data means that the otolith chemistry of all of these ﬁsh is nearly identical sug- gesting that these ﬁsh truly originated from the renews river. discussion in this article, we examined the population structure in a potentially mixed-stock recreational ﬁshery for sea_trout and the results yielded several salient points. first, we showed that otolith chemistry in juveniles reﬂects site-speciﬁc conditions and can be used successfully to differentiate among anadromous adults later in life. second, we found evidence counter to our predictions of high population mixing, but detected variation in the extent of mixing among rivers. for example, of the 118 ﬁsh harvested in the renews river estuary over 3 years, 96% were classiﬁed as having been produced in that river, whereas only 22% of ﬁsh captured at the chance

and source- sink dynamics among recently established brown_trout populations in newfoundland. taken as whole, the results conﬁrm the role of otolith microchemistry as a useful tool for identifying stock structure in marine recreational ﬁsheries for anadromous species and sug- gest limited overlap among populations in estuaries, migrations of short distances, and that individuals from some populations may act as harvest subsidies to anglers in other locations. given these results, we sug- gest conservation towards the maintenance of the pro- cesses that produce these patterns if there is a long- term goal of sustainable angler harvests. however, we acknowledge the unenviable dilemma faced by managers to balance the contradictory calls to treat non-native brown_trout as a prize worth preserving, or a pest to eradicate. the use of otolith chemistry is an increasingly common tool to infer stock structure in recreationally important species (patterson & swearer 2008; wells et al. 2010; newman et al. 2011; ramsay et al. 2011). for example, walther et al. (2008) found that only 6% of spawning american shad (alosa sapidiss- ima) in the york river system in virginia were pro- duced elsewhere and thus were potential strays from other rivers, and olley et al. (2011) were able to use otolith chemistry to show that recruitment sources for brown_trout were spread evenly throughout their study catchment. however, to the best of our knowl- edge, our study was the ﬁrst to investigate population mixing between catchments in sea run brown_trout in a recreational ﬁshery. despite their obvious utility, otolith chemistry is not a panacea immune to caveats and assumptions. in this study, we make several com- mon assumptions that are worthy of discussion. first, we assume that chemistry in the four rivers we sampled is stable through time. we detected greater variability in chemistry of harvested ﬁsh compared with juvenile ﬁsh, which we interpret as arising from at least two potential, not mutually exclusive, path- ways. first, the assumption of temporal stability in water chemistry within rivers may not be entirely jus- tiﬁed. our samples of harvested ﬁsh from the renews river estuary were comprised of multiple age classes and migratory histories. not only were individuals necessarily compared to chemistry several years after they reared in the river, but in addition there was variation of when ﬁsh emigrated to sea and thus temporal differences of when they were rearing in freshwater. the variability detected in the harvested adult otolith may reﬂect temporal differences in chemistry, suggesting instability in environmental signatures. however, the temporal chemistry variabil- ity is not sufﬁcient to result in the assignment of individuals to rivers other than renews. 548 (88, 102 and 76 km2 second, the inﬂuence of ‘ghost’ populations (i.e. populations we did not sample but that may have chemistry similar to renews) may be reﬂected in the greater variability in adult versus juvenile chem- istry. the east coast of the avalon peninsula has at least eight watersheds with established populations of brown_trout (westley & fleming 2011), though we were only able to sample three. we chose these locations as they are important areas for recreational ﬁshing and because they are relatively large water- sheds for chance cove, pierre’s brook, and renews, respectively compared to mean size of other watersheds 78 km2, range 51 –123 km2). the large area likely translates to greater habitat for the production of potential strays and migrants compared to smaller watersheds. our analyses allow us few migrants from chance cove or pierre’s brook are inter-mixing with renews ﬁsh in the estuary, and only one potential migrant from port rexton a watershed at the edge of the brown_trout range in newfoundland, 271 km as from renews, was detected. whether individuals from unsampled watersheds are represented in the sample of adults harvested in the renews river estuary is not known, but seems unlikely. to conﬁdently say that a ﬁsh swims assumptions and caveats notwithstanding, our results reveal that, on average, 96% of the ﬁsh caught in the renews recreational ﬁshery were of renews river origin, suggesting short-distance marine migra- tions. our data are consistent with the general con- sensus that while at sea, trout typically remain close to their home river, but individual and site-speciﬁc variation is considerable (klemetsen et al. 2003). for example, of 2122 sea_trout tagged leaving the river vardness, norway, 52.8% were caught within 3 km of the river mouth, and only 0.6% travelled more than 80 km distance (berg & berg 1987). in contrast, sea_trout from the northwest iberian peninsula, spain, typically travelled in excess of 200 km from their tagging site in the ulla river (caballero et al. 2006), and populations in the black sea may migrate as far as 900 km from the point of release (okumus et al. 2006 and references therein). thus, while sea_trout have the capacity to migrate long distances, typically they do not. our data support the consensus of lim- ited marine migrations in newfoundland sea_trout. the most likely source of foreign ﬁsh in the renews ﬁshery is chance cove, followed by pierre’s brook. chance cove contributed 2.5% of the harvest from the renews ﬁshery, whereas pierre’s brook contrib- uted <1%. these patterns likely, at in part, reﬂect distance between watersheds (chance cove and pierre’s brook are 24 and 61 km from the renew river, respectively), and migratory costs incurred by sea_trout. that is, trout may not migrate least far from home and if they do go elsewhere are more likely to enter a nearby, rather than distant, estuary. anadromy and homing are behaviourally coupled in sea_trout and other salmonids (mcdowall 2001), and both are thought to reﬂect and promote local adaptation to environmental conditions (quinn 2005). the small proportion of nonlocal individuals detected in the renews river estuary suggest limited potential for straying of foreign individuals into the system. efforts to quantify rates straying in salmonids are exceedingly difﬁcult, due in part, because individuals can stray into and out of populations (quinn 1993). in this article, we assess potential straying of foreign individuals into the renews river and consider these data to be indicative of maximum potential straying rates. individuals may have left the renews estuary and gone to their home river if given the choice, but they of course were not as they were all killed by anglers. additionally, straying conventionally implies spawning and gene ﬂow among populations (quinn 1993), but whether the ﬁsh caught in the renew estu- ary were there simply for feeding or were indeed headed upriver to spawn is unknown. if ﬁsh were in the estuary primarily for feeding, one might have expected foreign individuals to be more common in the renews estuary during the nonreproductive sea- son (spring and summer). in contrast, we detected consistent seasons (table 3). our estimates of a potential 5–7% stray rate are within the range of published estimates (see review by jonsson & jonsson 2011), which combine to suggest that brown_trout home with marked ﬁdel- ity. indeed, ﬁne scale local adaptation observed in brown_trout populations also implies accurate homing as excessive gene ﬂow would likely erode adaptation in the absence of philopatry (hendry et al. 2004b; meier et al. 2011). local dominance during all for we detected the potential for the renews river population to contribute disproportionately to the harvest in the chance cove ﬁshery (seven of the nine harvested ﬁsh in chance cove estuary were identiﬁed as of renews river origin), at least at certain times. the high-proportion of foreign ﬁsh in chance cove includes periods of the fall when adults would be maturing. these patterns highlight the potential among brown_trout populations in newfoundland (schtick- zelle & quinn 2007); however, a small sample of harvested ﬁsh at chance cove collected in septem- ber and october of the same year necessitates cau- tion in interpretation. unknown details about the chance cove and renews river populations, such as their relative size, make conclusions difﬁcult. even a modest straying rate in a numerically large population can result in a high absolute number of strays and may then comprise a large proportion of source-sink dynamics origins of sea_trout the total ﬁsh returning in a numerically small popu- lation. regardless, the results suggest the potential for population mixing and dispersal, and that har- vests within a watershed may be subsidised from other areas. productivity among populations can change through time (hilborn et al. 2003; schindler et al. 2010), and thus, to maintain population structure and connectivity of brown_trout populations assuming that long-term sustainable har- vests are the goal. is prudent it acknowledgements this work was funded by fisheries
