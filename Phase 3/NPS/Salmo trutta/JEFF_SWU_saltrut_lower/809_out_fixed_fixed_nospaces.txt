(hereafter referred as min- now) is a small slender schooling freshwater fish, belonging to the cyprinidae family. its native range encompasses almost the whole of europe and northern asia (mills, 1988). typically minnows inhabit rivers, streams and clean lakes with bottoms of stones and gravel (frost, 1943). this short- lived species produces successive batches of eggs during an extended spawning season, which usually lasts from may to july (mills & eloranta, 1985; saat, järvekülg, & turovski, 2003). spawning season is shorter, and the number of egg batches is smaller in northern regions than in southern ones (mills, 1988). in estonia, it is one of the most widespread species in streams, but it is also common in the brackish coastal waters of the baltic sea (saat et al., 2003). furthermore, minnows inhabiting the coastal sea of west estonian archipelago (they are absent from streams of those islands themselves) are so far considered as a separate ecomorph that resides solely in brackish waters and do not enter freshwater streams and riv- ers (järvekülg, 2001). in recent decades, otolith microchemistry has emerged as an effi- cient tool for studying the movements of fish between environments with different water chemistry (campana, 1999; elsdon et al., 2008; gillanders, 2005; walther & limburg, 2012). a variety of trace ele- ments and stable isotope markers have been used. to successfully use these markers, they must comply with two key assumptions: ambient dissolved concentrations of the selected markers in water must vary among environments investigated, and they must be incorporated into otoliths in proportion with their ambient values with minimal inter- ferences from confounding environmental and physiological factors (elsdon et al., 2008; walther & limburg, 2012). strontium- to- calcium ratio (sr:ca) has proven to be the most efficient marker for studying fish migrations when movements occur between habitats with dif- ferent salinity, for example in a river–sea system (gillanders, 2005; rohtla, vetemaa, urtson, & soesoo, 2012; secor & rooker, 2000). strontium- to- calcium ratio in the water is generally positively cor- related with salinity (limburg, 2004; zimmerman, 2005), and those ambient sr:ca values are reflected in the otoliths (bath et al., 2000; kraus & secor, 2004). several previous studies have successfully used otolith microchemistry (sr:ca as a chemical tracer) for studying fish movements in the baltic sea, although, yet again, research has svirgsden et al. been focused on economically valuable species (limburg, landergren, westin, elfman, & kristiansson, 2001; limburg, wickström, svedäng, elfman, & kristiansson, 2003; rohtla et al., 2015; shiao, ložys, iizuka, & tzeng, 2006; taal, kesler et al., 2014). the objective of this study was to use otolith sr:ca concentra- tions and age data to investigate eurasian minnow’s movements in the brackish coastal areas of the baltic sea. specifically, whether min- nows inhabiting the coastal sea of the western estonian archipelago undertake spawning migrations into fresh water. so far those fish have been considered as a separate ecomorph that inhabit only the brackish environments. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study sites fish were collected from four sites around saaremaa island: kõiguste bay, uudepanga bay, ligeoja brook and jämaja brook (figure 1). kõiguste bay is situated in the northern part of the gulf of riga, baltic sea. it is a shallow semi- enclosed bay with a dominant sediment type of sandy clay mixed with pebbles, gravel and boulders (lauringson & kotta, 2006). the area is affected by a diffuse nu- trient load from the moderately eutrophicated gulf of riga (astok, otsmann, & suursaar, 1999). the bay is divided into two relatively distinct subunits (inner and outer bay) by a peninsula and a belt of small islets. the inner bay is shallower (up to 2 m) and slightly less saline (3–5 psu) compared to the outer bay (up to 6 m and 4–6 psu). a number of seasonal ditches and one small river (maadevahe river) drain into the inner bay, and only a few ditches drain into the outer bay. the sampling site was situated on the northern shore of the outer bay. uudepanga bay is situated in the eastern part of the northern baltic proper. it is a small open bay with depths reaching up to 20 m. the dominating substrate in shallower areas is sand, except in the eastern coast, where a limestone bottom with patches of rocks and gravel dominates. surface water salinity ranges between 5 and 7 psu. the bay receives marginal freshwater inflows from a few seasonal brooks (most notable are the tüdru and urva brooks). the sampling site was situated on the eastern shore of the bay. ligeoja brook is situated in the north- western part of saaremaa island. this perennial spring- fed stream is only 1.3 km long with a catchment area of 3.3 km2. the prevailing sediment type is sand with only limited patches of gravel. dominant fish species are brown_trout salmo_trutta l. and ninespine stickleback pungitius pungitius l. (järvekülg, 2001). the brook drains into tagalaht bay. the mouth is situated 200 m north from the mouth of pidula brook, which is sig- nificantly larger than ligeoja brook. the sampling site was situated approximately 150 m upstream from the brook mouth. jämaja brook is located on the sõrve peninsula in the south- western part of saaremaa island. this perennial brook is 8.6 km long and has a catchment area of 25.3 km2. rapids alternate with deeper water sections with a sandy bottom. dominant fish species is brown_trout. the brook drains into the northern baltic proper, and the mouth svirgsden et al.     |  91 a e altic s b uudepanga ligeoja saaremaa kõiguste baltic proper jämaja gulf of riga figure 1 location map of the study sites is fully exposed to the open sea. there are no other significant fresh- water streams nearby. the sampling site was located in the stream mouth, approximately 80 m from the sea. 2.2 | fish sampling and processing in kõiguste and uudepanga bays, the fish were caught by beach seine; in ligeoja and jämaja brooks fish were collected by electrofishing. in kõiguste and uudepanga bays, sampling was carried out in 2010 on 3 july at kõiguste (n = 36) and on 29 may and 14 june at uudepanga (n = 22 and 19 respectively). in ligeoja brook and jämaja brook, fish collection was carried out in 2011 on 28 september at ligeoja (n = 11) and on 29 october at jämaja (n = 36). the fish were killed immediately after capture by severing the central nervous system. total length (tl, to the nearest 1 mm) and weight (tw, to the nearest 0.1 g) were re- corded in the laboratory. sex was determined by visual examination of the gonad. otoliths (lapilli) were extracted, cleaned from adhering tissue and stored dry in microtubes. 2.3 | otolith preparation and ageing each otolith was individually embedded into a mixture of epoxy resin and hardener (epofix, stuers aps, radovre, denmark) so that a frontal section could be ground out. to expose the core area, the mount was ground manually with a grinding machine (metaserv 250, buehler ltd., il, usa) from both sides using abrasive papers with grit sizes p400 and p2500. final polishing was carried out with p4000- grit sanding paper. prepared otoliths were mounted on a petrographic slide. individual ages were determined by counting the narrow winter growth zones from unstained and stained (1% neutral red and 0.5% acetic acid) oto- liths under a stereomicroscope against dark and light backgrounds. otoliths were carefully checked for any vaterite intrusions before and after the staining. 2.4 | la- icpms and water analysis the elemental composition of otoliths was quantified with laser ab- lation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (la- icpms) in oregon state university’s wm keck collaboratory of plasma spectrometry, corvallis, or. before the analysis, otoliths were soni- cated in ultrapure water for 10 min and dried under a laminar flow fume hood. a vg pq excell icpms (thermo scientific, waltham, ma, usa) with a new wave duv193 excimer laser (new wave research, fremont, ca, usa) was used for quantifying the con- centrations of 43ca, 86sr and 55mn. the laser was operated at 70% output power with a 10- hz pulse rate and a 40- μm ablation spot size, scanning speed was 5 μm s−1. a carrier gas mixture of he and ar was used to introduce ablated material into the inductively cou- pled ar plasma. a continuous line scan was traced along the longest axis from the otolith core to the edge. data reduction was carried out by following the methods of miller (2007). background levels of 43ca, 86sr and 55mn were measured for 33 s prior to otolith ablation and subtracted from those measured during otolith ablation. count rates for 86sr and 55mn were normalised to 43ca to account for vari- ations in instrument sensitivity and ablation rate (campana et al., 1997). the ion ratios were converted to elemental concentrations using measurements of nist- 612 glass standard. elemental ratios were further converted to molar ratios based on the molar mass of sr, mn and ca and presented as mmol mol−1. extreme outliers were removed following the methods of veinott and porter (2005). an eight- point moving mean was used to reduce the noise and smooth the data. water samples from the relevant sites were collected in 2012 (table 1). from every site a, single sample of 20 ml was filtered through nylon filter (0.45 μm) and acidified to ph 2 with nitric acid. acidified samples were analysed using x series ii icpms coupled with a cetac asx100 autosampler (cetac technologies inc., omaha, ne, usa). 92  |     site (sampling date) kõiguste (08.11.2012) maadevahe river kõiguste bay uudepanga (17.11.2012) tüdru brook urva brook uudepanga bay ligeoja (11.11.2012) ligeoja brook pidula brook tagalaht bay jämaja (08.11.2012) jämaja brook 200 m from the mouth of the jämaja brook baltic proper near jämaja salinity sr (ppm) ca (ppm) sr:ca (mmol mol−1) table 1 water sample data for the fish collecting sites and adjacent locations (in italic) svirgsden et al. <0.5 4.7 <0.5 <0.5 6.5 <0.5 <0.5 6.6 <0.5 1.8 6.2 0.102 1.186 0.079 0.087 1.541 0.100 0.070 1.551 0.116 0.573 1.498 105.6 102.9 61.5 63.2 119.5 71.7 57.7 138.1 105.0 107.6 117.0 0.4 5.3 0.6 0.6 5.9 0.6 0.5 5.1 0.5 2.4 5.9 external calibration with claritas ppt multielement standards clms- 1 and clms- 2 (spex certiprep inc., metuchen, nj, usa) were used to quantify sr and ca in the water. nist standard reference material 1643e was used for quality control. 3 |  results strontium concentrations and sr:ca values in the water showed a strong positive relationship with salinity (table 1). otolith sr:ca re- vealed that at least three different migratory patterns exist: (i) seawa- ter residency, (ii) fast springtime migrations to fresh water or to bays with lower salinities (e.g. areas near stream mouths) and (iii) prolonged migrations to fresh water (figure 2). those patterns were not evenly distributed among the sites (table 2; figure 3). no freshwater resident fish were observed among the sampled fish. about half of the fish in kõiguste bay did not show any clearly distinguishable sr:ca oscillations (figure 2a). the other half showed small- scale fluctuations in their sr:ca profile that were often located on the annulus, indicating that those changes occurred in springtime (figure 2b). small part (17%) of the fish in kõiguste showed limited oc- casional increases or decreases in their sr:ca values after which those new values were stable for a period of time (figure 2c). the majority of fish in uudepanga bay showed just one moderate nadir in their sr:ca profile which coincided with an annulus (figure 2d). this indicates that in springtime, fish experienced fresh water or water with lower salinity compared to the ambient sea water. some fish exhibited deeper nadirs (figure 2e) indicating temporally longer stays in fresh water or water with lower salinity. in both cases, the nadir usually occurred only once which means that fish did not migrate to fresh water in every year. as in kõiguste, some fish in uudepanga did not show any notable sr:ca oscillations (figure 2f). sr:ca profiles in ligeoja and jämaja brooks were more complex than in the bays. all fish in ligeoja brook showed fluctuations in their sr:ca profiles. a majority of the profiles had relatively deep nadirs which usually concurred with annulus (figure 2g). some fish had modest nadirs indicating shorter stays in fresh water (figure 2h). in some cases, the nadirs did not occur every year. all fish from the ligeoja showed a decrease at the end of their sr:ca profile; in three cases, this decrease was quite prominent (figure 2i). about half of the fish in the jämaja brook showed moderate oscillations in their sr:ca profiles (figure 2j). most of the other profiles exhibited deeper nadirs (figure 2k). in the majority of the cases, nadirs did not occur in every year. three individuals did not display any fluctuations in their profiles (figure 2l). two specimens in the jämaja had very low core values (sr:ca <0.5 mmol mol−1) indicating that those fish were presumably hatched and reared for some time in fresh water (figure 2m). forty- seven per cent of the fish in the jämaja showed a decrease at the end of their sr:ca profiles. a new maximum age for minnows in estonia was recorded in the jämaja (7 years; table 2; figure 2j). reduced sr:ca core values (≥0.3 mmol mol−1 difference between core and adjacent zone) were observed in the otoliths of most fish, which in the majority of cases concurred with a mn peak (mn:ca peak ≥0.005 mmol mol−1) (figure 2a–d,f–i,k–n). diminished sr values in the core were also apparent in freshwater resident minnows from the umbusi river in central estonia (58º35.37′n 26º6.15′e) (figure 2n). elevated mn in the core was positively associated with the occurrence of decreased sr levels in the core (chi- squared test, χ2=40.31, 1 df, p < .001; table 3). there was a significant relationship between sex and migratory behaviour (chi- squared test, χ2 = 5.58, 1 df, p = .018). males tended to migrate to fresh(er) water more than expected by chance, whereas females tended to be more likely seawater residents (table 4). svirgsden et al. ) l o m / l o m m ( a c : r s 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 (a) kõiguste 65 mm female 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 100 200 300 400 500 600 0.00 0 (d) uudepanga 70 mm female 0 (g) 100 200 300 400 500 ligeoja 77 mm female 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 (j) jämaja 90 mm female 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0.00 0 (m) jämaja 74 mm male 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 (b) kõiguste 70 mm male 100 200 300 400 500 0 (e) uudepanga 75 mm female 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 (h) ligeoja 68 mm male 100 200 300 400 500 0 (k) jämaja 60 mm male 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 (n) 0.3 umbusi 78 mm female 0.2 0.1 0.0 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0 (i) 0 (l) 0 (c) kõiguste 78 mm female     |  93 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 (f) uudepanga 74 mm male 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 ligeoja 55 mm male 100 200 300 400 jämaja 69 mm male 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 ) l o m / l o m m ( a c : n m 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0.00 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 100 200 300 400 500 600 0.00 distance from the core (µm) figure 2 representative otolith sr:ca (black line) and mn:ca (grey line) profiles of eurasian minnow: (a) kõiguste bay, demonstrating seawater residency (migration type i);

zivkov & trichkova, 2006). a substantial proportion of minnows did not migrate to fresh water in every year. this could be the result of skipped spawning (rideout & tomkiewicz, 2011) or more likely that springtime conditions in freshwater streams were suboptimal in certain years (i.e. low water volume). skipped migrations were most prominent in uudepanga bay where there are only a few seasonal streams avail- able for freshwater spawning. those streams are heavily influenced by springtime snowmelt and therefore in years with low snow cover have low water levels which may prevent minnow’s springtime spawning mi- grations. as we observed large numbers of seawater residents and also migrants with skipped migrations in the same population, it seems that minnows can freely switch between freshwater and brackish water re- production. this switching between spawning biotopes is further sup- ported by the fact that some individuals from brackish uudepanga bay were caught with running gametes (indicating brackish water spawn- ing), but their sr:ca profiles displayed clear nadirs during the previous breeding season (indicating freshwater spawning). some of the fish in ligeoja and jämaja brooks entered the streams in autumn or even in summer and overwintered there. this overwin- tering and also springtime spawning migration patterns, whereby only a fraction of the minnow population migrates, can be regarded as par- tial migration (chapman, hulthén et al., 2012; chapman et al., 2012). we did not identify any winter migrants in kõiguste and uudepanga bays. the reason behind this is probably the lack of suitable streams for overwintering in those areas. previous tagging studies have shown     |  95 partial winter migration in many species of cyprinids in lake–stream systems (brodersen et al., 2012; jepsen & berg, 2002; skov, brodersen, nilsson, hansson, & brönmark, 2008). it has been shown that predator avoidance may be the main driving factor behind cyprinids winter mi- gration (bronmark, skov, brodersen, nilsson, & hansson, 2008; skov et al., 2011). also, fish condition (brodersen, nilsson, hansson, skov, & brönmark, 2008) and an individual’s personality traits (chapman et al., 2011) can influence migratory propensity. predator avoidance is the most plausible explanation for minnow’s winter migration observed in our study, because in winter, ligeoja and jämaja brooks are relatively devoid of predators compared to the coastal waters. on the other hand, the sea has a more stable environment in winter and provides more food resources than the streams. bronmark et al. (2008) con- cluded that individual winter migration decisions are based on trade- offs between predator avoidance and growth, and this might also be the case for the coastal minnows. aforementioned studies have shown that partial winter migration is a common phenomenon in lake- dwelling cyprinids; we demonstrate that it is also common in minnows inhabiting a brackish coastal sea. the majority of analysed fish showed elevated mn:ca values in otolith core regions. markedly high mn concentrations in otolith cores have been observed in a wide range of fish species (brophy, jeffries, & danilowicz, 2004; miller & kent, 2009; ruttenberg et al., 2005). those elevated mn:ca levels are seemingly not related to dissolved mn concentrations in the ambient environments, and exact mechanisms behind high mn values in otolith cores remain obscure (bouchard, thorrold, & fortier, 2015; brophy et al., 2004). several studies have used increased mn as a clear marker for identification of the otolith primordia (macdonald, shelley, & crook, 2008; miller & kent, 2009; veinott, westley, purchase, & warner, 2014), and it performed satis- factorily in the current study as well. our failure to identify the distinct mn peak in some individuals was probably caused either by misplace- ment of laser transect or over/under grinding of the otolith core. to our knowledge, eurasian minnow is the only cyprinid species besides common carp cyprinus carpio l. (blair & hicks 2012) with a reported distinct mn peak in the otolith core. besides elevated mn levels, we observed decreased sr values in the core. it has been shown that ma- ternal associations with fresh- and/or seawater may affect offspring’s otolith core sr concentrations in some fish species (kalish, 1990; rohtla et al., 2012; volk, blakley, schroder, & kuehner, 2000). usually this manifests as a sr peak (mother peak) in otolith cores of offspring with anadromous maternal origin, but we observed the opposite of that: a nadir in the core. our data suggest that those diminished sr levels in the cores of the minnow’s otoliths have ontogenetic origin and are not associated with the mother’s life history. this is because those nadirs were evident in the majority of the individuals regard- less of their migration patterns (even for the freshwater residents [figure 2n]). also, most of the fishes without a sr nadir in the core did not exhibit a mn peak which indicates that we did not ablate the otolith core and thus missed the sr nadir. this unusual pattern of sr concentrations in the core has not been previously reported. this has important implications for interpreting of otolith sr:ca profiles, as it may mask or distort a natal freshwater signal. 96  |     considering the aforementioned ontogenetic effect on the core sr:ca values, we cannot assign analysed minnows hatching habitat for certain, except for two specimens from the jämaja brook, which showed very low natal sr values (sr:ca <0.5 mmol mol−1). water chem- istry data and previous studies (rohtla et al., 2012, 2014, 2015) sug- gest that sr:ca natal values ≤0.6 mmol mol−1 should be considered as fresh water. this indicates that those two individuals were hatched in fresh water and had freshwater natal rearing habitat. for the rest of the fishes, one of two scenarios may apply: a) fish were hatched and reared in the brackish coastal sea or b) fish were hatched in the fresh water, but shortly drifted or emigrated to brackish water. in the case of the latter scenario, the brief freshwater signal in otolith sr:ca profile could have been masked by aforementioned sr phenomenon in the core. in the current study, we observed fish up to seven years (eight summers) old. this is a new maximum age for minnows in estonia, as the previous reported age was four summers (saat et al., 2003). in kõiguste, uudepanga and jämaja, we observed a number of fish older than four years, which means that those age groups are not uncom- mon in those populations. the minnow displays a notable variability in its life- history traits, including lifespan, over its wide geographical range. in warmer southern regions, its age does not usually exceed three years (mills, 1987), but in northern areas, ages up to 13 years have been observed (mills, 1988). our reported seven years fit well into the before mentioned south- north gradient. it is worth mentioning that age reading from the otoliths was occasionally quite complicated because in many cases annuli in otoliths were not clearly recognisable. problems with age determination of the minnow have been reported in previous studies as well (frost, 1943; mills, 1987). in this study we demonstrated, for the first time, movement pat- terns of eurasian minnow between brackish and freshwater environ- ments using otolith microchemistry. it was revealed that much more complex migration patterns exist in brackish water inhabiting minnow populations than previously thought. furthermore, we observed po- tentially ontogenetically affected mn and sr concentrations in the otolith core regions that may aid (mn peak) and/or complicate (sr nadir) the interpretation of otolith element:ca data. the answer to the titular question “do eurasian minnows (phoxinus phoxinus) inhabiting brackish water enter fresh water to reproduce?” is no (in the case of kõiguste), maybe (in the case of uudepanga) and yes (in the cases of ligeoja and jämaja). acknowledgements we thank j.a. miller, m. loewen and a. ungerer for their help with the otolith analyses and data processing. financial support was pro- vided by estonian science foundation grant no. 8281 and target fi- nanced project sf0180005s10. references astok, v., otsmann, m. & suursaar, ü.
