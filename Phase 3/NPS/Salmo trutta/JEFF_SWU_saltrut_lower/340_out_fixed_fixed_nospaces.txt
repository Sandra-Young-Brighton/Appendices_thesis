e-mail: pascal.laffaille@ensat.fr accepted for publication september 15, 2010 introduction the distribution of salmon (salmo_salar l.) popula- tions in europe and north america indicates that in many rivers that have historically supported atlantic salmon populations, these populations have been the exterminated or suffered a severe decline. conse- quently, the atlantic salmon is now considered to be a threatened species in some regions. in many cases, this can be attributed to a number of factors, such as dam construction, pollution, overﬁshing, changing ocean conditions, introduction of non-native ﬁsh and aqua- culture (parrish et al. 1998). as well as additional marine research (klemetsen et al. 2003), there is also a need for a better understanding of the factors that inﬂuence the production of salmon in freshwater habitats (heggenes et al. 1999), and especially the interactions between farmed, stocked salmon and wild populations. in fact, large numbers of farmed ﬁsh are invading salmon habitats, by escaping or as a result of stocking throughout the north atlantic to conserve and restore salmon populations (hansen et al. 1991; gross 1998) even if a wild salmon population seems to subsist. for example, it is the case in france in the loire (descroix et al. 2009) or in the aulne (croze 2008) basins. although it is usually difﬁcult to predict the speciﬁc introductions (e.g., leprieur impacts of biological et al. 2009), we do know that introduced ﬁsh can have profound effects on wild ﬁsh, particularly in the case of salmonids (e.g., fausch 1998; levin et al. 2002; scott et al. 2005; blanchet et al. 2007). for example, there is a large literature about the potential complex interactions between stocked and wild salmons (gross 1998; youngson & verspoor 1998; hutchinson 2006; ford & myers 2008). however, these effects are either too subtle or not sufﬁciently clearly identiﬁed to make it possible to deﬁnitely attribute the patterns of extermination and decline of atlantic salmon popula- tions to them. this concern arises from the potentially deleterious effects of ecological interactions between stocked and wild salmon, and especially ﬁsh origi- nated from wild spawning salmon caught in the river and reared in speciﬁc salmon hatchery before stocked in the same river. in fact, little is known about direct effects of stocked salmon in modifying the use of speciﬁc habitats by wild salmon. the aim of this study was to investigate the meso- and micro-habitats used doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00459.x 67 laffaille by stocked salmon and the wild population in a small stream during summer low-ﬂow conditions under allopatric and sympatric conditions. materials and methods the aulne is a 145-km-long river, with a 1495-km2 catchment area, characteristic of brittany (france) rivers (see croze 2008 for more details). the indices of the abundance of juveniles in this river indicate a low average density (5.5 ind. per 5 min of electro- ﬁshing), which is well below the average level for brittany (21 ind. per 5 min). this low density of juvenile salmon produced naturally by the river conﬁrmed the threat to the stock of wild salmon in the aulne. in response to the major decline in the wild population of salmon, between 70,000 and 100,000 parr have been stocked every year since 1986. the ﬁsh stocked originated from wild spawning salmon caught each autumn in the river. juveniles were reared from the egg stage in a speciﬁc salmon hatchery and fed commercial pellets. in june, young-of-the-year (0+ parr, fork length ranging from 40 to 50 mm) were released into various different river sections (the number of fry released ranging between 0.5 and 1 salmonæm2 of habitat area suitable for parr). because parr–smolt transformation takes place at the age of 1+ in most ﬁsh, 0+ parr were virtually the only age group in the river during the summer months. consequently, only results for 0+ parr were used. stocked and wild salmon were identiﬁed by observing the adipose ﬁn. indeed, all stocked ﬁsh have been ﬁnclipped before release. fifty-eight river sections corresponding to all the different tributaries were selected randomly (one section for each small tributaries and two for large ones), without taking the resettlement areas into account, to represent the range of habitat conditions available for young-of-the-year atlantic salmon in the aulne streams. backpack electroﬁshing equipment was used to catch ﬁsh late in the summers of 2002 and 2003, using a point abundance sampling by electro- ﬁshing (pase) technique (laffaille et al. 2005). salmon were caught during one electroﬁshing pass at the different sampling points at each river section. as soon as each point was reached, the anode was immediately placed on the bottom of the stream and was kept turning in an area of 1 m2 for at least 30 s. fish were then collected with several ﬁne-mesh dipnets (50 mm mesh size). electroﬁshing was con- ducted in an upstream direction and always with systematically a distance of 3 m between sampling points to prevent possible contamination of the salmon by downstream samples. the total number of sampling points in the experiment was 1540 (averaging 27 per river section, depending on the sampling points 68 available in each river section). approximately 1 ⁄ 3 of the total habitat area was point-sampled in each river section. the salmon were measured (fork length, to the nearest mm). after a log (x + 1) transformation to ensure the normality of the distribution, the sizes of the salmon were compared using student’s t-test (t-test). the correlation between salmon density (number of ﬁsh per sampling point) for the different river sections and the origin of the salmon was tested using pearson’s correlation. the general habitat several parameters were measured to analyse salmon distribution vs. habitat conditions according to bardonnet & baglinie`re (2000). at each sampling point, type (meso-habitat) was )1 and deep >30 cm), deﬁned as a pool (slow <50 cmæs glide (slow to fast, nonturbulent), rifﬂe (shallow )1 and turbulent) according to <30 cm, fast >50 cmæs the deﬁnitions of delacoste et al. (1995). we measured ﬁve micro-scale habitat parameters that are known to inﬂuence the spatial organisation of salmonid com- munities. these micro-scale parameters were esti- mated at each sampling point to assess the salmon micro-habitat: • three topographical variables: depth (in cm), the presence or absence of ﬁsh shelter and distance from the bank (described as sampling from the bank or as sampling in the middle of the river); the • one biotic variable: aquatic vegetation expressed as the cover index (from minimum 0 to maximum 5) calculated for the whole area covered by all the sampling points; and • one substratum composition expressed as the dominant type: sand, gravel or boulders. atlantic salmon habitats (the spatial distribution of salmon densities according to the environmental variables, the origin of the salmon and salmon size classes) were analysed in greater detail using eco- logical proﬁles. the inﬂuence of each variable was visualised independently. to test the origin effect, we used data from allopatric and sympatric conditions. to test the salmon size effect, we used four size classes (total salmon, <75, 75–85 and >85 mm). finally, each matrix (i.e., one for salmon from each origin in allopatric and sympatric conditions, from each size class and with or without presence of salmo_trutta – the most abundant salmonid) was used to develop habitat preference indices for each envi- ronmental variable as a measurement of the habitat used by salmon vs. habitat availability, based on the method of brosse et al. (2001). the habitat used was calculated as a normalised ratio of utilisation to availability for different modality of each environ- mental variable. indices of the habitat used were obtained after dividing each variable into several modalities. their number was deﬁned according to the range of variation of each variable. the following formula was used: i ¼ ½ðob=exþ=ðob=exþmax   0:5 where ob is the density of ﬁsh observed for each modality of each environmental variable, ex is the expected density for a theoretical random distribution and (ob ⁄ ex)max is the maximum value of (ob ⁄ ex) for

taken to reveal indifference; those from )0.3 to )0.1 and from +0.1 to +0.3 indicate slight avoidance and slight use, respectively; and those from )0.5 to )0.3 and +0.3 to +0.5 reveal strong avoidance and use, respectively. ecological proﬁles were compared using wilcoxon’s nonparametric test (z-test). results a total of 641 (385 stocked and 256 wilds) young- of-the-year (0+) salmons were collected. stocked salmon fork lengths ranged from 43 to 108 mm (mean ± sd = 79.9 ± 12.5 mm) (fig. 1) and were larger (t-test, t = 7.984, p < 0.001) than wild salmon length ranged from 43 to 101 mm (mean ± sd = 70.1 ± 12.2 mm). present, the mean density of 0+ salmon was 0.42 ± 0.70 ﬁsh per sampling point. half of the river sections studied (30) were found to contain 0+ salmon. when salmon were density was 0.66 ± 0.69 ﬁsh per sampling point. other salmonids (native salmo_trutta and non-native oncorhynchus_mykiss) were present under sympatric conditions, but comparatively in low numbers (mean density: 0.26 ± 0.23 and 0.09 ± 0.09 ﬁsh per sampling point, respectively). nine river sections were colonised the mean habitat of wild and stocked salmon 0.3 0.2 0.1  s e  i t i s n e d n o m a s d l  ) 1 + x

(fig. 3) used habitats with the same char- acteristics (wilcoxon’s test, z = )1.76, p = 0.07). moreover, wilcoxon’s nonparametric test showed nonsigniﬁcant difference between the ecological pro- ﬁles of the different size classes and with or without the presence of salmo_trutta (z between 0.28 and 0.94 and p between 0.77 and 0.35). at the meso-habitat scale, the salmon chose a rifﬂe habitat (i.e., a shallow, fast-ﬂowing turbulent stream) and avoided pools (slow ﬂowing and deep) and glides (slow to fast and nonturbulent). at the micro-habitat scale, ecological proﬁles revealed no strong avoidance, and both stocked and wild salmons were ubiquitous. salmon preferred shallow to intermediate depth streams (<50 cm) and coarse substrates (gravel and boulder). the minor differences concerned their use of aquatic vegetation and shelters. wild salmon preferred micro- habitats with little aquatic vegetation cover (<3) or indeed no shelter, whereas stocked salmon preferred ) % ( e g

proﬁles of the three size classes and with or without presence of salmo_trutta (z between 0.20 and 0.54 and p between 0.85 and 0.62). regardless of whether wild salmon were present, 0+ stocked salmon showed no difference (wilcoxon’s test, z = )1.06, p = 0.29). in contrast, the ecological proﬁles of wild salmon revealed major differences in habitat descriptions (wilcoxon’s test, z = )2.98, p < 0.01), with strong choice and avoid- ance behaviour being evident. at the meso-habitat scale, wild salmon preferred glides and avoided pools and rifﬂes. at the micro-habitat scale, they preferred deeper habitats without aquatic vegetation and a substrate composed of small particles. they also preferred habitats containing ﬁsh shelters. in summary, our analyses of the ecological proﬁles revealed habitat 70 discussion in our study, ecological proﬁles indicated only minor habitat differences in salmon of different origins (stocked or wild) under allopatric conditions, whereas major differences appeared under sympatric condi- tions. in numerous studies concerning salmon ⁄ habitat relationships, micro-habitat parameters such as veloc- ity, water depth, substrate and geomorphological unit type have generally been used to evaluate the suitability of habitats for young salmon. the impact of biotic parameters has received relatively little attention. however, the spatial niche occupied depends both on intra- and inter-speciﬁc competition, and on habitat availability. in this study, other salmonids (native salmo_trutta and non-native oncorhynchus_mykiss) were present in low numbers, and salmon habitats were not different with or without the presence of salmo_trutta, suggesting that inter-speciﬁc competition was certainly limited from salmonid habitat of

sympatric as populations. heggenes (1990) characterised the habitat preference of young salmon in terms of depth, as shallow to intermediate (20–70 cm), and in terms of water velocity, relatively fast ﬂowing (10– )1). however, young salmon are generally 60 cmæs found towards the lower end of these values (bardon- net & baglinie`re 2000). generally, under allopatric conditions, in the summer, young-of-the-year (0+) are mainly present in rifﬂes and glides with a coarse substrate and markedly avoid pools (see for example bardonnet & baglinie`re 2000). although we did ﬁnd that salmon were more abundant in certain habitat types, this species does appear to be generally tolerant of a wide range of habitats and sometimes occupies less typical habitats, such as deeper pools. for example, bremset & berg (1997) and blanchet et al. (2006) have both reported extensive use of pools by atlantic salmon, but to have included areas with high water ﬂow rates and low to medium ﬁsh densities, respectively. when confronted by competition, young salmon demonstrate ﬂexibility in their choice of habitat (heggenes et al. 1995). our results show that when two salmon populations (wild and stocked origin in our study) live under sympatric these pools appear conditions: the stocked ﬁsh used rifﬂes, whereas the wild salmon mainly used glides. consequently, the habitat used by wild salmon in aulne tributaries probably reﬂects the limited space available in these relatively small streams, potentially aggravated by intra-species competition for space, because in small streams, salmonid populations are generally present at high densities. body size has a considerable impact on inter- species interactions among ﬁsh. for example, size is known to be a decisive factor in competitive interac- tions between brown_trout and other stream salmonids (fausch 1998, faush & white 1986). size is also an important element in intra-species interactions, because spatial segregation is determined largely by the body size of the ﬁsh (vehanen et al. 1999). different size classes of atlantic salmon are often segregated spatially in rivers. generally, small salmon are found in shallow rifﬂe areas, whereas larger ﬁsh occupy deeper habitats (bardonnet & baglinie`re 2000). in our study, size is not a signiﬁcant factor in allopatric conditions and for each salmon origin in sympatric conditions. then, salmon origin rather than size contributed to spatial distribution and habitat use 71 laffaille under sympatric conditions. however, the stocked salmon were larger than the wild salmon. stocked salmon have adapted to an aquaculture niche, and this has made them maladapted to the wild niche (gross 1998). however, the establishment of a stocked population in a river suggests that some of the habitats in this river must be suitable for the wild population, because they have similar habitat requirements, which are indeed similar to those of non-native salmonids (see for example, fausch 1998; harwood et al. 2002; armstrong et al. 2003). after a growth period spent in a high-density niche environment of aquaculture, stocked juveniles are larger than wild salmon and aggressively out-compete wild juveniles in competi- tion experiments (einum & fleming 1997). thus, the presence of stocked salmon modiﬁes the characteris- tics of the habitats occupied by wild salmon despite their prior residence. this indicates that the newcom- ers (the stocked salmon) are able to displace the wild salmon that were already in the habitats, which suggests that there must be strong interaction between these two groups of salmon. consequently, ecological impacts can occur through food and space competi- tion. the difference in body size depending on salmon origin was certainly the most important factor explain- ing the meso- and micro-habitat segregation. more- over, farm background may affect the behaviour of the ﬁsh, because probably even in the case of similar sized ﬁsh, stocked ﬁsh are more aggressive than wild ﬁsh because of high rearing densities, differences in food delivery and the absence of predators. the stocked salmon clearly behaviourally displaced the wild ﬁsh into meso- and micro-habitats, where feeding rates were probably lower. the origin-dependent distribu- tion observed is a consequence of this size-dependent segregation. the ﬁndings of this study provide evidence of the impact of stocking with farmed salmon (in our case, ﬁsh originated from wild spawning salmon caught in the river and reared in speciﬁc salmon hatchery before stocked in the same river) on habitat use by wild salmon, and especially on the selection of more suitable meso- and micro-habitats. thus, wild salmon are found in sheltered habitats or in replacement habitats in the presence of stocked salmon, which probably reduces their food intake, and consequently their growth, and ultimately their chances of survival as demonstrated with escaped salmon from hatchery (mcginnity et al. 2003). the actual cost of this change in habitat remains to be determined. given that intensive stocking with farmed atlantic salmon was carried out to enhance recreational angling and conservation programs (see for example parrish et al. 1998; scott et al. 2005; descroix et al. 2009), this study warns us that this can have negative impacts on extant wild atlantic salmon populations, especially in 72 small rivers, if the stocked salmon are larger than the wild salmon present. stocking should not therefore be carried out in tributaries used by wild ﬁsh. this is certainly applicable generally throughout the european salmon distribution range, and so these consequences should be taken into account in global and local management plans. acknowledgements this study was funded by the ‘fe´de´ration de peˆche et de protection des milieux aquatiques du finiste`re’, the ‘contrat de plan poissons migrateurs’ and various regional and local councils. i thank l.a. vollestad, reviewers, s. brosse (university of toulouse 3) and a. senecal (logrami) for their valuable comments on an earlier version of the manuscript. references armstrong, j.d., kemp, p.s., kennedy, g.j.a., ladle, m. & milner, n.j. 2003. habitat requirements of atlantic salmon and brown_trout in rivers and streams. fisheries research 62: 143–170. bardonnet, a. & baglinie`re, j.l. 2000. freshwater habitat of atlantic salmon (salmon salar). canadian journal of fish- eries and aquatic sciences 57: 497–506. blanchet, s., dodson, j.j. & brosse, s. 2006. inﬂuence of habitat structure and ﬁsh density on atlantic salmon salmo_salar l. territorial behaviour. journal of fish biology 68: 951–957. blanchet, s., loot, g., grenouillet, g. & brosse, s. 2007. competitive interactions between native and exotic salmo- nids: a combined ﬁeld and laboratory demonstration. ecology of freshwater fish 16: 133–143. bremset, g. & berg, o.k. 1997. density, size-at-age and distribution of young atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) in deep pools. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 54: 2827–2836. brosse, s., laffaille, p., gabas, s. & lek, s. 2001. is scuba sampling a relevant method to study ﬁsh microhabitat in lakes? examples and comparisons three european species. ecology of freshwater fish 10: 138–146. for croze, o. 2008. the impact of the channeled part of the aulne river (france) on the upstream migration of returning adult atlantic salmon as determined by radio-tracking. american fisheries society symposium 61: 23–37. delacoste, m., baran, p., lek, s. & lascaux, j.m. 1995. classiﬁcation et cle´ de de´termination des facie`s d’e´coulement en rivie`res de montagne. bulletin franc¸ais de la peˆche et de la pisciculture 337 ⁄ 338 ⁄ 339: 149–156. descroix, a., desvilettes, c., martin, p., anneville, o., bec, a. & bourdier, g. 2009. feeding, growth and nutritional status of restocked salmon parr along longitudinal gradient of a large european river, the allier. ecology of freshwater fish 18: 282–296. einum, s. & fleming, i.a. 1997. genetic divergence and interactions in the wild among native, farmed and hybrid atlantic salmon. journal of fish biology 50: 634–651. fausch, k.d. 1998. interspeciﬁc competition and juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo_salar): on testing effects and evaluating evidence across fisheries and aquatic sciences 55: 218–231. scale. canadian journal of faush, k.d. & white, r.j. 1986. competition among juveniles of coho salmon, brook_trout, and brown_trout in a laboratory stream, and implications for great lakes tributaries. trans- actions of the american fisheries society 115: 363–381. ford, j.s. & myers, r.a. 2008. a global assessment of salmon aquaculture impacts on wild salmonids. plos biology 6: e33. gross, m.r. 1998. one species with two biologies: atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) in the wild and in aquaculture. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 55: 131–144. hansen, l.p., hastein, t., naevdal, g., saunders, r.l. & thorpe, j.e.
