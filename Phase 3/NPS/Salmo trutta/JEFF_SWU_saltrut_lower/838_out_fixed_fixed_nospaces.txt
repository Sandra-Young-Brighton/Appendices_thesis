olden & poff 2004; marchetti et al. 2006; mckinney 2006; smith 2006; light & marchetti 2007). fish and other biological invasions result from human activities including boat trafﬁc (i.e., ballast water invasion), aquarium ﬁsh imports, aquaculture, releases for biological control, releases to develop new ﬁsheries, irrigation and the con- struction of inter-catchment canals, pipes and tunnels (allan and flecker 1993; padilla et al. 1996; a positive tailwaters, ruesink 2005; brasher et al. 2006; jeschke & strayer 2006; stohlgren et al. 2006). exotic ﬁshes spatial generally have linkage with reservoirs, their impounded waterways and headwater above some large waterfalls and dams because of stocking those locations for sport ﬁshing (pringle et al. 2000; leprieur et al. 2006). in particular, they have a higher abundance above than below large dams in tropical streams (holmquist et al. 1998). anthropogenic disturbances such as water abstraction for irrigation, damming without spillway and altered thermal regime by damming also facilitate their invasion and expansion. inten- tional releases to establish a new species are most responsible for the widespread establishment of the non-native ﬁsh species et al. 2004; (marchetti 416 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00294.x spatial linkage between dams and non-native ﬁsh species ruesink 2005). it is therefore logical to hypothesise that successful ﬁsh invasions have a strong spatial linkage with locations of known ﬁsh releases, i.e., dams and associated reservoirs (iguchi et al. 2004; marchetti et al. 2004; curry et al. 2007). dams alter physical and hydrologic aspects of riverine systems affecting both quality and quantity of water ﬂows. the majority of the largest river systems in the northern hemisphere are currently affected by fragmentation of river channels by dams (dynesius & nilsson 1994). consequently, dams are considered one of the most signiﬁcant obstacles in restoring the biodiversity and integrity of riverine systems (the heinz center 2002). a number of studies have demonstrated the negative effects of dams on native ﬁsh species. dams can be a barrier to migration and degrade habitats because of altered ﬂow and sediment regime (e.g., morita & yamam- oto 2002; wofford et al. 2005; fukushima et al. 2007; han et al. 2007; isaak et al. 2007). although stocking reservoirs with alien or translocated ﬁsh species for recreational ﬁshing has long been a pervasive human activity (allan & flecker 1993), lower reaches of rivers and streams below dams have also been invaded by a large number of non- native ﬁshes, especially in systems with high levels of human disturbance (moyle & light 1996). in such cases, dams, weirs and waterfalls can serve as barriers to prevent the downstream non-native spe- cies to protect endangered native species there (townsend & crowl 1991; novinger & rahel 2003). the possible linkage between dams can therefore be complex depending on ﬁsh species and mechanisms in the invasion process. from invading upstream reaches and ﬁsh invasions we examined the spatial linkage between dams and ﬁsh invasions by comparing the distributions of native and non-native species relative to the distributions of dams in hokkaido, japan. our primary goal was to determine whether dams have contributed to the successful invasions of non-native ﬁsh species. we also examined differences between native and non- native species richness patterns in relation to various environmental characteristics. the spread and estab- lishment of non-native ﬁshes have rarely been exam- ined in a quantitative manner on a broad spatial scale. understanding such environmental conditions and mechanisms is crucial in preventing further expansion of invasive species and biotic homogenization in aquatic ecosystems. methods study area a northernmost island of 41°21¢–45°33¢n, japan hokkaido is 139°20¢– (area = 78,423 km2; 148°53¢e; fig. 1a). its climate is temperate to sub- arctic with average annual temperature ranging from 6–10 °c and average annual precipitation in the range of 800 –1500 mm. the island has 167 large dams (>15 m high) that have been built for hydropower generation, irrigation, water supply and ﬂood control (fig. 1a). a number of small watersheds have been left isolated in headwater areas that resulted when rivers and streams were blocked by the dams (kameyama et al. 2004). hokkaido is comprised of forests (70.9%), agricultural areas (15.7%), roads (2.1%) and buildings (1.4%;

http://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj). the land use pattern was represented by the ﬁrst principal component of the proportions of three land use types within a square grid of 1 km2, i.e., a developed area of roads and buildings, an agricultural area of rice ﬁelds and other farmlands and forests. the ﬁrst principal component explained a substantial amount of overall variance in land use patterns (0.65) with correlation coefﬁcients in individual land use types being )0.54, )0.49 and 0.68 for developed areas, agricultural areas and forests, respectively. the dam variable was categorical, representing one of the following: (i) no 418 table 1. changes in deviance when dropping a variable from the models of native species richness, non-native species richness, and the proportion of native species. variable null deviance residual deviance degrees of freedom (full model) deviance change watershed area elevation precipitation air temperature survey year land use pattern (pc axis 1) latitude & longitude dam native species richness 12,399 8013 7460 non-native species richness proportion of native species 9043 6347 7459 2255 1844 7467 87 (2.0)** 380 (8.7)** 21 (0.5)* 30 (0.7)** 1219 (27.8)** 60 (1.4)** 78 (2.9)** 22 (0.8)* 18 (0.7)* 72 (2.7)** 307 (11.4)** 91 (3.4)** 29 (7.1)** ns ns 13 (3.2)** 14 (3.4)* 27 (6.6)** 109 (2.5)** ns 335 (12.4)** 83 (3.1)** 86 (20.9)** 26 (6.3)** percentage change in deviance is given in parenthesis as deviance change ⁄ (null deviance ) residual deviance) · 100. *p < 0.01;

or (iii) inlet stream: site was located in one of the inlet streams of a reservoir. in this study, we included only the large dams because they are typically asso- ciated with reservoirs where non-native species are likely to occur, as opposed to smaller dams. the absolute correlation coefﬁcients between all pairs of the nine environmental variables were less than 0.6. statistical analysis generalised additive modelling we modelled both native and non-native species richness using generalised additive models (gams) with poisson error distributions (hastie & tibshirani 1990). we also modelled the proportion of native to all species (i.e., native and non-native) with gam, with a binomial error distribution. gams are a nonparametric extension of general linear models (glms) which extend the application of classical regression models into other statistical error distributions (binomial, poisson, gamma, negative binomial) (venables & ripley 2002). gams estimate nonparametric smooth- ing functions relationships between response and predictor variables. spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nearby points in space are more similar to each other than distant points) is problematic in most regression analyses (legendre & fortin 1989). nevertheless, nonparametric models such as gams successfully eliminate spatial autocorrelation from the residuals by including coordinate variables (augustin et al. 1998; knapp et al. 2003). to describe nonlinear spatial linkage between dams and non-native ﬁsh species all regression analyses start with the following full model: log richnessðor logit proportionþ ¼ a þ s1ðwatershed areaþ þ s2ðelevationþ þ s3ðprecipitationþ þ s4ðair temperatureþ þ s5ðsurvey yearþ þ s6ðland use patternþ þ loðlatitude; longitudeþ þ dam where a is an intercept, s represent smoothing spline functions and lo is a bivariate smoothing function of a locally weighted polynomial (chambers & hastie 1991). insigniﬁcant variables were dropped from the full model based on likelihood ratio tests at p = 0.01. the contribution of each signiﬁcant predictor to the model ﬁt was visually assessed by plotting ﬁtted responses with point-wise twice standard-error bands. canonical correspondence analysis on non-native ﬁsh species out of the 16 non-native ﬁsh species, we applied canonical correspondence analysis (cca) to 12 pre- dominant species that were observed at more than 15 grids, representing one per cent of all grids where at least one non-native species was observed using canoco 4.5 (ter braak and smilauer 1999). cca identiﬁes an environmental basis for species composi- tion by selecting the linear combination of environ- mental variables that maximises the dispersion of the species scores which are calculated by averaging the environmental values of the sites in which the species is present. (ter braak 1986). the same nine environ- mental variables described above were simultaneously examined in cca with respect to their relationships to the non-native species. the original dam variable deﬁned by three categories, i.e., no dam, reservoir and inlet stream was simpliﬁed to a binomial variable deﬁned as no dam (0) and above dam: site was located in reservoir or one of the inlet streams of reservoirs (1). we selected the signiﬁcant variables for cca using a forward selection procedure with unrestricted monte carlo permutation tests at p = 0.05 (99 permutations). results responses of native and non-native species to environmental characteristics observed native and non-native ﬁsh species richness per 1-km2 grid ranged from 0 to 23 and from 0 to 7, respectively. the mean native species richness (± sd) was signiﬁcantly higher at grids with no dams (3.62 ± 2.63) than sites in inlet streams (2.73 ± 1.71) and lowest at sites in reservoirs (2.44 ± 0.14; kruskal– wallis rank sum test, v2 = 91.5, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001). in contrast, the mean non-native species richness was signiﬁcantly higher at sites in reservoirs (1.20 ± 1.09) compared to sites in inlet streams (0.53 ± 0.74) and lowest at sites with no dams (0.42 ± 0.86) (kruskal– wallis rank sum test, v2 = 160.7, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001). the most signiﬁcant environmental variables in terms of changes in deviance were survey year for the native species richness model and the combination of latitude and longitude for the non-native species richness model and the model of the proportion of native species (table 1). these two terms explained considerable percentages of the variance in the native and non-native species richness (30.3% and 23.8%, respectively). elevation was the second most impor- tant predictor in the native species richness model (8.7%), but it is barely signiﬁcant in the non-native species richness model (0.8%). for the latter model, variables such as dam (3.1%) and land use (3.4%) were more important. air relationship with the native species richness and its proportion to the total species richness reached maximum at a watershed area of about 2,000 km2 (fig. 2a,c), while non-native species richness was maximum in larger watersheds of about 6,000 km2 (fig. 2b). both native and non-native species richness decreased with increasing elevation (fig. 2d,e); the latter declined sharply at elevations higher than 100 m. both native and non-native species richness decreased with increasing annual precipita- tion (fig. 2f,g). native species richness decreased with increasing annual mean air temperature (fig. 2h), while non-native species richness appeared to have a parabolic temperature (fig. 2i). the proportion of native species showed an opposite trend for the air temperature to the non-native richness (fig. 2j). both native and non-native species richness increased considerably in ﬁsh surveys con- ducted after the proportion of native species decreased steadily after the mid 1970s (fig. 2m). both native and non-native species richness decreased with increasing proportion of forest and decreasing proportions of developed and agricultural areas (fig. 2n,o). the proportion of native species showed an opposite response and increased with increasing forest cover (fig. 2p). native species richness was higher along the western side of hokka- ido, whereas non-native richness tended to increase toward the south-western part of hokkaido (fig. 2q,r). the proportion of native species showed an opposite geographical trend to the non-native species richness (fig. 2s). the native richness model did not have the dam variable as a signiﬁcant predictor despite the signiﬁcant differences in the mean native species richness among the three categories of the survey sites. the dam variable, however was a signiﬁcant predictor for non-native species richness and proportion of the 1990s (fig. 2k,l), whereas 419 han et al.

of all the other environmental variables were taken into account (fig. 2t). con- versely, reservoirs were predicted to have the smallest proportion of native ﬁsh species followed by sites in inlet streams (fig. 2u). canonical correspondence analysis for the non-native ﬁsh species gudgeon topmouth the highest non-native species richness (eight species) occurred in the grid denoting the lower reaches of the ishikari river (fig. 1a). the distributions of the 12 non-native species differed from species to species (fig. 3). field gudgeon (gnathopogon elongates elongatus), (pseudorasbora parva), common carp (cyprinus carpio), deep-bodied crucian carp (carassius cuvieri), rose bitterling (rho- deus ocellatus ocellatus), far eastern catﬁsh (silurus asotus) and northern snakehead (channa argus) were concentrated in the ishikari river basin (fig. 3a–g). in particular, ﬁeld gudgeon and rose bitterling were only observed in this river system. the other non-native species exhibited distinct distributions that were not conﬁned to the single river basin. asian pond loach (misgurnus anguillicaudatus) and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) were distributed widely throughout hokkaido (fig. 3h,i). brown_trout (salmo_trutta) were much less common when compared with rainbow trout but occurred in more than 15 river (fig. 3j). red-spotted masu salmon (o. systems masou ishikawae) and coho salmon (o. kisutch) occurred only in limited rivers (fig. 3k,l). 420 the ﬁrst and second canonical axes of cca explain 26.8% and 8.3% of the overall variance in the relationship between non-native species and the envi- ronmental variables, respectively. the cca bi-plot divided the 12 non-native ﬁsh species into two groups (fig. 4). the ﬁrst group consisted primarily of cypri- nids (i.e., ﬁeld gudgeon, topmouth gudgeon, common carp, deep-bodied crucian carp and rose bitterling) as well as far eastern catﬁsh and northern snakehead. this group represents non-native species found pri- marily in the lower reaches of the ishikari river (fig. 3a–g) where the land use is predominantly developed or agricultural areas as indicated by the lower principal component scores. the second group consisted exclusively of non-native salmonids, namely rainbow trout, brown_trout, red-spotted masu salmon and coho salmon. as described above, their distribu- tions were not limited to the ishikari river (fig. 3i–l) but were associated with areas at higher elevations, areas with higher proportions of forest, or areas above dams (fig. 4). although asian pond loach were widely distributed like rainbow trout (fig. 3h), they occurred at lower elevations with relatively warmer air temperatures (fig. 4). discussion non-native ﬁsh species have increased in species richness in hokkaido since the mid 1970s. although both native and non-native ﬁsh appear to have increased, the rate of increase was greater for non- native species as indicated by the decreasing propor- tion of native species per ﬁsh survey. the apparent increases of not only non-native but also native (a) noegdugdleif (d) pracnaicurcdeidobpeed (g) daehekansnrehtron (j) tuortnworb spatial linkage between

late 1980s and increased sur- veyor attention to newly described species (fukushi- ma et al. 2007). we identiﬁed differences between native and non-native freshwater ﬁshes in their responses to various environmental characteristics. while elevation, a natural environmental variable was for native the second most species the most signiﬁcant variable, variables related to human activ- ities, dam construction and land use patterns were more important to determine non-native species richness. the distribution of non-native species richness was also geographically uneven with the strong inﬂuence of latitude and longitude as the most important predictor when considered together. important predictor survey year as richness after damming generally exerts negative effects on native ﬁsh species, especially on migratory species (holmquist et al. 1998; joy & death 2001; fukushima et al. 2007). in this study, however, native species richness was not signiﬁcantly correlated with the presence of dams. this is explained in part by nonrandom distribution of dams, i.e., dams were mostly constructed at higher elevations; the mean elevation of survey sites above dams were 262 m. at higher elevations, only a few native ﬁsh species can occur in hokkaido (fukushima 2005) suggesting that potentially negative effects of dams on the native species were difﬁcult to detect statistically. in addition, although fukushima (2005) found the negative effect of dams on native ﬁsh species richness by including both large dams and low-head dams using glm with an interaction term of dam and elevation, this effect diminishes at higher elevations (e.g., >200 m) because of the dam-elevation interaction. therefore, our result does not mean that native ﬁsh richness is not inﬂuenced by damming, but only was probably caused by dam data with higher elevation. fishery propaga- tion practices may be an other reason. it was known that both non-native and native species have widely been released into reservoirs across the island (the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries of japan; http://www.tdb.maff.go.jp/toukei/a02smenu? touid=j126). some of the commonly introduced species included native diadromous species such as masu salmon and japanese smelt. these ﬁsh often become artiﬁcially landlocked and no longer perform seaward migration (miyadi et al. 1996). we concluded that these circumstances obscured the effects of dams on native ﬁsh populations. non-native ﬁsh species richness had a clear linkage with the presence of dams. the non-native species richness was highest in reservoirs, followed by inlet streams above reservoirs. it was lowest in reaches with no dams. this is consistent with the ﬁndings from 422 previous studies (holmquist et al. 1998; pringle et al. 2000; leprieur et al. 2006), where exotic ﬁshes generally are introduced in reservoirs and favoured by regulated ﬂow. the spatial linkage must be interpreted cautiously, however, because it did not apply to non-native ﬁsh species in general but was only speciﬁc to salmonids. numerous reservoirs in hokkaido have experienced proliﬁc releases of rain- bow and brown_trout for sport ﬁshing (takami & aoyama 1999; takayama et al. 2002). the introduc- tion of large non-native piscivores such as salmonids can lead to dramatic shifts not only in the ﬁsh assemblage structure but also the entire food-web structure as a result of the cascading nature of trophic levels (carpenter et al. 1985). this may be especially true for japan where native large piscivores were originally absent (iguchi et al. 2004). other non-native ﬁsh species commonly observed in hokkaido belong mostly to cyprinids. their occur- rence was not associated with dams or reservoirs but with development and ⁄ or agriculture at relatively lower elevations in the ishikari river, the largest river basin of hokkaido. these non-native ﬁsh species (excluding common carp) have been introduced through unintentional or unauthorised stocking (e.g., accidental introduction of bitterling and gudgeon associated with intentional stocking of common carp) which prevents a complete invasion history (hokkaido government; http://bluelist.hokkaido-ies.go.jp). the ishikari river is most densely populated and has the longest history of reclamation in hokkaido (ishigaki & fukuda 1994). the proportion of riverbanks that are adjacent to an urban area is highest in this river among all in hokkaido (http://www.biodic.go.jp/ reports2/4th/kasen.html). the distributions of non- native ﬁsh species have been positively correlated with human population density and the proportion of developed area (shea & chesson 2002; meador et al. 2003; mckinney 2006). rivers our hypothesis that the invasion of non-native ﬁsh species is spatially linked to the location of dams was partly supported. although species richness of non- native ﬁshes was signiﬁcantly higher above dams, the species that increase in reservoirs and inlet streams comprised only salmonids. non-native salmonids can be a signiﬁcant threat to the indigenous ﬁsh fauna of hokkaido, especially native salmonids (hasegawa et al. 2004). located higher in latitude, hokkaido has historically supported healthy populations of various native salmonids, such as sakhalin taimen (hucho_perryi), whitespotted char (salvelinus leuco- maenis), dolly varden (s. malma), masu salmon (o. masou), chum salon (o. keta) and pink salmon (o. gorbuscha) (miyadi et al. 1996). large dams have land-locked some of the native salmonid populations in reservoirs and inlet streams (edo et al. 2000; spatial linkage between dams and non-native ﬁsh species tamate & maekawa 2002), potentially intensifying the interaction between native and non-native salmonids. competition with predation by and hybridization with the introduced non-native salmonids could increase the risk of extinction of the land-locked native salmonids. constructing ﬁsh ladders may not provide a solution to dams because it also enables non-native ﬁshes to escape from reservoirs and to enlarge their distribution. the introduction of non-native species. if this occurs, their populations can multiply at the expense of native species. is most desireable to prevent it acknowledgments we thank satoshi kameyama and bunkei matsushita for thoughtful discussions, and masayuki
