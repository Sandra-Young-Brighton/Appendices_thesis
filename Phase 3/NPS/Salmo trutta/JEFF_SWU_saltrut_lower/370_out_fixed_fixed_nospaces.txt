(see jonsson & jonsson 2001 for a review). in loch rannoch, scotland, three sympatric morphs exist with clearly distinct diets and trophic morphology. a benthivorous morph forages exclusively on benthic- living, macro-invertebrate prey, a planktivorous morph feeds solely on zooplankton in the pelagic zone, while the third (a piscivorous morph) feeds on macro- invertebrates when small, switching to a diet of ﬁsh above a length of about 16 cm (adams et al. 1998). the differences in diet that characterise these morphs have potential consequences for an inter-related suite of life-history traits, stemming from their effect on size-related foraging efﬁciency. the most signiﬁcant difference between the diets of these three foraging specialists is in prey size. zooplankton are small and have a relatively small size range (typically 0.1–3 mm; scourﬁeld & hard- ing 1966; harding & smith 1974; pontin 1978) and thus typically yield a low per capita energy gain to predators. in contrast, ﬁsh prey are relatively large, but also display a very large variation in size (of the order of 4–50 cm in length; maitland 2004) and as a result in general higher, per capita energy gain to predators. macro- invertebrates are intermediate in absolute size and in size variability (typically 1–35 mm in length; elliott 1977; hynes 1977; macan 1979) compared with the two alternative prey types considered here and thus yield an intermediate per capita energy gain. this prey yields a variable, but implications for life-history pattern theoretical, ﬁeld and there is now substantial for gape-limited ﬁsh experimental evidence that predators, there is an optimum prey size, deﬁned by the per capita energy gain to the predator (which increases with prey size) relative to energy expen- diture on prey handling (which also increases with prey size) (see, e.g., werner & hall 1974; mittel- bach 1981; werner et al. 1983; hoyle & keast 1987; walton et al. 1992). one consequence of the trade-off between prey handling time and per capita energy gain is that the optimum prey size increases with predator size. this relationship has now been widely tested in a range of species in both experimental and ﬁeld study systems; see examples from a range of species in werner et al. 1983; keast 1985; li et al. 1985; walton et al. 1992; mittelebach & persson 1998; nilsson & bronmark 2000; wahlstrom et al. 2000; hjelm & persson 2001. in arctic charr, bystro¨m et al. (2004) showed an increasing attack rate, body size relationship in underyearlings from the wild feeding on zooplank- ton and chironomid prey. in controlled experiments (bystro¨m & andersson 2005) charr showed a size- 2 dependent peak in attack rate at around 7 g of weight when feeding on zooplankton, above and below which attack rate declined. relationships between prey size and size-related foraging efﬁciency have implications for patterns of growth in ﬁsh specialising in different diets. reduced foraging efﬁciency beyond a critical body size in ﬁsh feeding on plankton or macrobenthos is likely to place an upper limit on body size in such ﬁsh; this upper limit will be higher for macroben- thos feeders than for planktivores. in contrast, as a result of the relatively wide size range of prey, foraging efﬁciency will remain high over a wide range of body sizes for piscivores. thus foraging cost–beneﬁts are likely to place maximum body size constraints on specialist plankton and macrobenthos feeders which will be for piscivores. these relationships between body size and foraging efﬁciency are, in turn, likely to have implications for the timing of maturation and for patterns of reproductive investment. considerably wider it is well established that in breeding animals, energy is diverted to reproductive activity at the expense of somatic growth (see stearns 1992 and roff 1992 for reviews). in many species with continuous growth patterns (including ﬁsh), reproductive invest- ment during any given reproductive event is a function of body size (alm 1959). therefore, there may be a signiﬁcant ﬁtness advantage in delaying maturation to accrue size-related ﬁtness, but only where survivorship is high and rapid growth possible. for ﬁsh that feed exclusively on prey with a narrow size range (such as plankton and macrobenthos) then foraging efﬁciency and consequently growth should decline beyond an optimal body size deﬁned by prey size, so the beneﬁt of delaying maturation is likely to decrease in ﬁsh at or near to these optima. a trade-off between investment in reproduction and future survival is now well established (stearns 1992). given the predictions of body size limitation and early maturation in ﬁsh exploiting prey with a narrow size range, individuals utilising these diets are likely to have a shorter lifespan and to invest more at each breeding event than ﬁsh feeding on prey with a wider prey size range. life-history predictions for loch rannoch morphs applying the argument developed above to the trophic specialisms in the arctic charr morphs in loch rannoch leads to the general prediction that there are likely to be signiﬁcant differences in life history between the different foraging specialists. combining these life-history and foraging theory arguments leads to ﬁve speciﬁc predictions of the form and direction that variation in life-history traits should take in these three morphs: 1 growth pattern. both the planktivorous and benthivorous forms will show evidence of constraints on maximal body size but this should not occur (or will be very large) in the piscivorous form. 2 relative size. maximal body size will be smallest in the planktivorous form, largest in the piscivorous and intermediate in the benthivorous form. 3 longevity. the planktivores will have the shortest life span, piscivores the longest, with the benthivores again intermediate in life span. 4 age of maturation. of the three morphs, plank- tivores will become sexually mature at the youngest age, piscivores at the oldest age and benthivores at intermediate age. 5 annual reproductive investment. planktivorous charr will invest the most, piscivorous the least, with the benthivorous morph intermediate in annual repro- ductive investment. the main aim of the study described here was to test these ﬁve speciﬁc life-history predictions on the sympatric trophic specialist arctic charr morph system from loch rannoch. in the process of collecting these data, information on additional life-history events was also collected for which no speciﬁc a priori predic- tions are made, other than that there is likely to be variation between morphs. these data (on age-speciﬁc and lifetime reproductive investment) are also presented here. materials and methods capture of ﬁsh fish were sampled from loch rannoch, perthshire, scotland (56° 41¢ 28n 4° 17¢42w). loch rannoch is a deep, fjord-like, oligotrophic lake (maximum depth 116 m, mean depth of 51 m (murray & pullar 1910) at 203 m above sea level. fish were sampled during the spawning season from 15 october to 8 november over 3 years (1995–1997). multi-panelled gill nets (eight panels, knot-to-knot mesh size ranging from 8 to 50 mm) were set at a range of depths in both the east and west basins (murray & pullar 1910). nets were set for approximately 24 h, all charr captured were removed from nets and were frozen within 6 h. life-history strategies in sympatric charr fecundity in females was determined by immersing the ovaries in modiﬁed gilson’s solution (bagenal 1969) to separate individual ova, thereafter eggs were counted, weighed and mean egg weight for each individual ﬁsh determined. otoliths were removed for age determination. the external faces of otoliths were ground using ﬁne (1000 grit) aluminium oxide grind- ing powder to increase the clarity of annuli. annuli were counted by viewing the external face of the otoliths laterally, illuminated from below under a compound microscope at 400· magniﬁcation. immersed in glycerol, analysis of life-history traits the von bertalanffy growth model was used to provide an estimate of asymptotic size for each of the three morphs. a general linear model (glm) was used to test for between-morph differences in total ovary and testes weight, individual egg weight and total ovary weight. all variables were loge transformed prior to the analysis and loge fork length was used in the analysis as a size covariate. to enable determination of female lifetime repro- ductive output, a static life table was produced for each morph separately. due to some size (and hence age) selectivity of even multi-mesh gill nets, smaller ﬁsh tend to be under-represented in catches (johnson 1976; parker & johnson 1991). thus to construct the static life table (standardised to 100 individuals) a ﬁxed mortality rate for the youngest age classes was applied to age classes less than the peak abundance (ricker 1975) (i.e., age 4 for benthivorous and piscivorous and age 3 for planktivorous). an annual mortality rate of 15% derived from studies on brown_trout (salmo_trutta (l.)) (jonsson 1977; jonsson et al. 1984) and arctic charr (jonsson & hindar 1982) was applied to all morphs to reconstruct a relatively early-age class size. age-speciﬁc maturation proportions in the population, age-speciﬁc fecundity and gonad weights were calculated for, and applied to, each age cohort in the static life table to estimate total lifetime reproduc- tive output. results post-mortem procedure growth pattern and relative body size: predictions 1 and 2 fish were subsequently thawed and then assigned to a morph category (planktivorous, piscivorous or bent- hivorous) on the basis of a multivariate analysis of head measurements (adams et al. 1998). the follow- ing characteristics were then recorded: fork length (to the nearest mm), ﬁsh weight (g), gender, reproductive status based on the status of the gonads (spawning or not spawning in current season) and gonad weight. the von bertalanffy growth model identiﬁed a clear asymptotic size for both the planktivorous and benthivorous morphs (fig. 1). as predicted, asymp- totic size was smaller for the planktivorous morph (203 mm) than the benthivores (245 mm). the von bertalanffy model only explained a small amount of variation in length at age for piscivorous ﬁsh (table 1), indicating that a clear asymptotic size did 3 fraser et al. ) m m ( h t g n e l k r o f 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 piscivorous benthivorous planktivorous 0+ 5+ 10+ 15+ 20+ age (years) fig. 1. length at age (mean ± se) of each loch rannoch charr ¼ planktivorous, population as determined from otoliths. ¼ piscivorous, h ¼ benthivorous. in contrast comprised only 4.4% of males and 6.5% of females and by age 4+ all ﬁsh in this morph were reproductively active. in benthivorous charr, 50% of females and 100% of males in the 2+ age class were mature, 100% of ﬁsh of both sexes were mature in the 3+ and 4+ age groups. however, to planktivorous ﬁsh, small numbers of nonreproductive male and female benthiv- orous morph charr were still evident at ages 5+, 6+, 7+ and 9+. in the piscivorous morph, mature piscivorous females were recorded at age 1+ years, but mature males were not recorded until age 3+. as in the benthivorous form, nonspawning (but presumably previously matur- ing) individuals of both sexes were found in older age groups (up to 16+). not exist in this morph over the length range in this study and suggesting indeterminate growth. annual reproductive investment: prediction 5 longevity: prediction 3 between morphs the age of all ﬁsh collected during this study (regardless of sex or maturity status) differed signiﬁ- (fig. 2;

p < 0.0001, fig. 2). planktivorous and benthivorous ﬁsh had comparable mean ages of sexual maturity (p ¼ 0.479; mean ±se on the mean (sem) 3.89 ± 0.11 and 4.20 ± 0.17 years, respectively), and these were both signiﬁcantly lower than that of the piscivorous morph (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons; piscivorous morph mean ± sem 8.9 ± 0.58 years). males and females of the planktiv- orous morph showed identical maturation patterns, with 50% of ﬁsh maturing at age 2+. at age 3+, immature ﬁsh table 1. values of the parameters of the von bertalanffy growth equation ﬁtted to length at age data for three morphs of arctic charr from loch rannoch, where (l¥ is the asymptotic length (mm) and k is a growth coefﬁcient). linear model analysis of a general testis weight (loge transformed) showed a highly signiﬁcant effect of both fork length and morph on testis weight (table 2). a post hoc analysis of the effect of morphs (adjusted for the effect of multiple compar- isons and evaluated at a loge fork length of 5.3) showed that in planktivores was signiﬁcantly higher than in males of both the benthivores and piscivores (p < 0.001) which did not differ signiﬁcantly from each other (fig. 3a). testis weight in females both fork length (p < 0.001) and morph (p < 0.001) had a signiﬁcant effect on fecundity (egg number) (table 2). a post hoc analysis of the effect of morph showed a signiﬁcant difference between all three morphs (all pairwise comparisons p < 0.001) with size-corrected egg number the highest in the benthivorous morph, intermediate in planktivores and the lowest in piscivores (fig. 3b). both ﬁsh length (p < 0.001) and morph (p < 0.001) signiﬁcantly predicted variations in in- dividual egg weight (table 2). a post hoc analysis of the effect of morphs showed that planktivores had a signiﬁcantly higher egg weight than both benthivores and piscivores (p < 0.001) which did not differ signiﬁcantly from each other (fig. 3c). total ovary weight in females was not signiﬁcantly affected by body size (p ¼ 0.50) but was signiﬁcantly affected by morph (p < 0.001) (table 2). post hoc tests of morph effects showed that ovary weight in planktivores did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of benthivores (p ¼ 0.68) but that both had a signiﬁ- piscivores cantly (p < 0.001) (fig. 3d). ovary weight higher than parameter planktivorous benthivorous piscivorous other life-history events 203 0.94 96.0 245 0.72 98.9 414 0.10 36.8 age-speciﬁc reproductive output in the planktivores, ﬁsh of age 3+ contributed the most to the overall population fecundity eggs l¥ k r2 (%) 4 life-history strategies in sympatric charr males females planktivorous 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 n males females benthivorous 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 n males females piscivorous (a) ) s r a e y ( e g a (b) ) s r a e y ( e g a (c) ) s r a e y ( e g a 17+ 15+ 13+ 11+ 9+ 7+ 5+ 3+ 1+ 17+ 15+ 13+ 11+ 9+ 7+ 5+ 3+ 1+ 17+ 15+ 13+ 11+ 9+ 7+ 5+ 3+ 1+ 15 10 5 0 n 5 10 15 fig. 2. age frequency distribution of mature and immature males and females of (a) planktivorous charr, (b) benthivorous charr and (c) piscivorous charr from loch rannoch during the spawning period in 1994–1996.

benthivores, produces 40.2% of the benthivores output) and lower still in piscivores (producing 35.4% of the benthivores output) (fig. 5). this apparent difference in reproduc- tive output between planktivorous and benthivorous charr is reduced by the fact that planktivores produced heavier eggs (fig. 3c and 5) than the benthivores. discussion between-population variation in life-history traits in arctic charr has been demonstrated elsewhere (jons- son et al. 1988; snorrason et al. 1994; vøllestad & l’abe´e-lund 1994; sku´ lason et al. 1996; tallman et al. 1996; review in klemetsen et al. 2003). thus, it is perhaps not surprising that this study demonstrates clear differences in life-history strategies of the three 6 egg mass fecundity 100 80 60 40 20 0 planktivorous benthivorous

sympatric morphs of arctic charr for loch rannoch, supporting the very general prediction that these foraging specialists should show differences in a range of life-history characteristics. some of the more speciﬁc predictions of the relative nature of traits between morphs are supported; others are not. as predicted, both planktivores and benthi- vores showed a determinate growth pattern, with a maximal size beyond which no further growth occurred. this maximal size was larger in the benthi- vores than in the planktivores. in the piscivorous form, growth apparently continued throughout life. these ﬁndings are clearly consistent with predictions 1 and 2. thus, we conclude that these specialist feeders are showing a body size response that optimises the ratio of per capita energy intake to handling time. this results in a constrained maximal body size for the specialists foraging on restricted prey size range (planktivores and benthivores), but not for the spe- cialist foraging on a prey with a wide size range (the piscivorous feeder). differences in longevity between the morphs were as predicted (prediction 3), with the piscivorous morph displaying the greatest age (at least 18 years), followed by the benthivorous morph (11 years) and with the planktivorous morph living for the shortest time (9 years). by contrast, predictions about the relative age of maturation (prediction 4) were only partially con- ﬁrmed by the data. as predicted, both benthivorous and planktivorous forms matured signiﬁcantly earlier than piscivores, but, contrary to prediction, there was no difference between the benthivorous and planktiv- orous morphs in age at maturation. thus, the results presented here are consistent with earlier maturation in the foraging specialists with constrained maximum body size compared with the specialist with no maximum body size constraints. presumably, this is because the advantages of delayed maturation (greater investment in breeding resulting from greater body reserves) do not apply to the two restricted prey size ranges, foraging specialists (planktivores and benthi- vores), but do apply to the specialist with a signiﬁ- cantly less restricted prey size range (the piscivore). however, the predicted effect of larger maximal body size in the specialist foraging on macrobenthos did not translate into a delay in age at ﬁrst maturation. the morph-speciﬁc pattern of annual reproductive investment (prediction 5) was only partly as predicted. male planktivorous charr invested signiﬁcantly more in total gonad weight than did either benthivores or piscivores, suggesting that this specialist is responding to constraints on maximum body size by investing signiﬁcantly more in any one annual reproductive event. however, there was no difference in male reproductive investment between the benthivorous and the piscivorous morphs suggesting that the benthivor- ous males were not. in females, benthivores produced more eggs than piscivores, and more (though smaller) eggs than the planktivorous charr. egg size is known to signiﬁcantly affect survivorship in salmonids (hutchings 1991; ojanguren et al. 1996) and thus variation in egg size between morphs may reﬂect differential egg mortality pressures experienced by different morphs which are known to spawn in different localities (adams et al. 1998). total invest- ment in ovarian tissue (weight) in any one breeding season was higher in the two maximum body size- constrained morphs than in the morph showing unconstrained maximal body size (the piscivore). this is consistent with the trade-off between reproductive investment at any one breeding season and the probability of mortality before the next breeding life-history strategies in sympatric charr season, which is the highest for planktivores, the lowest for piscivores and intermediate for the bent- hivorous morphs. the age-speciﬁc pattern of sexual maturation also varied between morphs. in both the benthivorous and piscivorous ﬁsh a signiﬁcant proportion of both males and females that had presumably matured in previous years, were found in nonreproductive conditions. this was particularly evident in the long-lived piscivorous morph, but was also seen in the benthivorous form, even though these ﬁsh were much shorter lived. such a maturation pattern (with ﬁsh taking breaks from spawning) has been recorded elsewhere for arctic charr and is thought to be a response to low rates of acquisition of surplus energy (nordeng 1961; dutil 1986). measured in terms of female lifetime fecundity, the benthivorous morph had the highest lifetime repro- ductive output. however, the larger egg size of the planktivorous morph reduced the differential some- what between benthivores and planktivores morphs when lifetime egg mass production was compared. lifetime egg number or mass production does not necessarily represent ﬁtness differences between morphs as it there are signiﬁcant survivorship differences between morphs. is possible that in conclusion, the speciﬁc predictions of life-history outcomes based on optimal foraging theory and between morph foraging specialisms are largely sup- ported by the empirical evidence presented here. the study of life-history variation has, to a large extent, focused on examining linkages between traits. in most studies, the trade-offs deﬁning trait linkages have been examined in pairs, yet there are at least 45 readily deﬁned between trait trade-offs (stearns 1992). this high level of complexity should make the prediction of a ﬁnal life-history outcome very difﬁcult in any speciﬁc case. adopting a highly simplistic approach, here we use optimal foraging theory to predict differential body size constraints and subse- quently the effects of these constraints on maturation pattern, reproductive investment and longevity in three closely associated populations occupying the same lake. the fact these predictions are largely supported, despite the possibility of a large number of potential confounding trade-offs inﬂuencing the traits expressed, suggests that the size constraints placed on specialist feeders have a critical role in shaping life-history traits. that acknowledgements we thank the loch rannoch improvement association and rannoch school for kindly providing access to the study site to nicola bissett for help with
