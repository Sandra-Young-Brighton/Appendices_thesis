invasion; ﬁshes; antipredator behaviour; functional traits; wetlands introduction natural systems are threatened by ‘cocktails’ of non- native species (sensu johnson et al. 2009), whose impact on ecosystem structure and function is depen- dent on interactions among the non-native species themselves (richardson et al. 2000; ricciardi 2001; o’dowd et al. 2003; grosholz 2005). non-native species may interact in positive ways, facilitating their invasion success (adams et al. 2003), increasing impacts (johnson et al. 2009) and contributing to invasion meltdown (simberloff & von holle 1999; simberloff 2006 and references therein). alternatively, non-native species may interact in negative ways, resulting in the inhibition of one species’ invasion success (harvey et al. 2004; britton et al. 2010), or impact (griffen et al. 2008), and even replacement of one invader by another (lohrer & whitlatch 2002). yet, in other circumstances, no effect of one invasive species on another has been detected (cope & winterbourn 2004). thus, the outcome of multiple invasions is difﬁcult requiring closer examination of invader interactions (johnson et al. 2009), including of underlying behavioural mecha- nisms that help mediate evolutionarily novel interac- tions between non-native predators and native prey (sih et al. 2011). to predict, (sih effects of predators are also strongly inﬂuenced by predator–predator 1998; schmitz 2007), overall predator diversity (bruno & interactions et al. correspondence: a.e. porter-whitaker, oceanographic center, nova southeastern university, 8000 north ocean drive, dania beach, fl 33004, usa. e-mail: ashlport@nova.edu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00557.x 375 porter-whitaker et al. cardinale 2008) and predator hunting modes (schmitz 2007). multiple predators may interact in a linear fashion to affect prey mortality rates (i.e., additive effects) or demonstrate a variety of nonlinear interac- tions because they consume one another (i.e., intra- guild predation, crumrine & crowley 2003), inﬂuence one another’s foraging behaviour (i.e., interference competition, griffen & byers 2006) or inﬂuence prey behaviour (lima 1998). ineffective or multiple predators also present conﬂicting de- mands on prey (lima 1998; sih et al. 1998; relyea 2003). the ability of prey to respond adaptively to multiple predators simultaneously is thus somewhat limited, especially when predators are non-native (e.g., bryan et al. 2002). prey may lack antipredator responses or exhibit inappropriate responses when exposed to novel predators (cox & lima 2006; sih et al. 2010). even if novel predators are similar to native predators (e.g., both are ﬁsh), variation in morphological and behavioural foraging adaptations can result in some degree of predator novelty (cox & lima 2006; dunlop- hayden & rehage 2011). maladaptive antipredator responses will increase prey mortality (nannini & belk 2006), often resulting in stronger consumptive effects of non-native predators relative to native predators, as seen in freshwater ecosystems (cox & lima 2006; salo et al. 2007; sih et al. 2010). thus, a key component of understanding the effects of non-native predators and the variation in native prey vulnerability is examining how multiple non-native predators interact, and how multiple prey species respond to these complex predation threats. during the past 40 years, ﬁsh diversity in the southern florida everglades has increased by at least 40% due to species introductions (mostly cichlids). seventeen non-native, freshwater ﬁsh species are currently established in everglades national park (enp; j. kline personal communication; shaﬂand et al. 2008). despite this high invasion rate, our understanding of non-native ﬁsh impacts throughout the system remains poor (trexler et al. 2000), and empirical work that mechanistically examines interac- tions between native and non-native aquatic taxa and the underlying behaviours remains limited (brooks & jordan 2010). in this study, we examined predator– predator and predator–prey interactions among the two most abundant non-native ﬁshes in the everglades ecosystem and an assemblage of native prey. our main objective was to compare predation effects between a recent invader, the african jewelﬁsh (hemichromis letourneuxi, sauvage 1880), and a well-established invader, the mayan cichlid (cichlasoma urophthal- mus, gu¨nther 1862), to better understand native species vulnerability, and how vulnerability may be affected by multiple predator interactions. 376 both cichlids are generalist predators in the ever- glades, where they consume ﬁshes, macroinvertebrates and some plant material during ontogeny (loftus 1987; bergmann & motta 2005; w.f. loftus, unpub- lished data), but little is known about diets or prey preferences in their native range. mayan cichlids were ﬁrst detected in 1983 (loftus 1987), and since then have become widespread and numerous, particularly in estuarine mangrove regions (trexler et al. 2000; lorenz & serafy 2006). the african jewelﬁsh is a more recent invader (since 2000), highly abundant in short-hydroperiod marshes and currently undergoing rapid spread, including into coastal regions where mayan cichlids dominate (langston et al. 2010; rehage et al., unpublished data). whether these two invaders may facilitate each other’s invasion success, exacerbating their impact, or may interact in a negative way, leading to displacement or a predation release for affected prey, remains unknown. we used ﬁeld and laboratory experiments to answer three questions: (i) do mayan cichlids and african jewelﬁsh have similar predation rates and prey pref- erences (i.e., are they functionally redundant)? (ii) do their interactions alter predatory effects on native prey? (iii) do prey exhibit effective antipredator responses to both non-native predators? using in situ ﬁeld enclosures, we compared predation rates by the two cichlids on an assemblage of ﬁve native prey (four ﬁsh species and one macroinvertebrate). field enclo- sures are less likely to constrain species interactions than laboratory experiments, providing an appropriate context roles of predators in nature (schmitz 2007). next, we exam- ined variation in predator tactics and antipredator behaviour in laboratory aquaria. we predicted higher predation rates for the african jewelﬁsh because of greater prey naivete´. we hypothesised that interference competition among the cichlids would lead to lower predation rates when together, resulting in prey being released from predation in mixed predator treatments. we expected prey to exhibit stronger antipredator responses to the mayan cichlid, due to greater experience with this predator. for understanding the functional methods field collections for both the ﬁeld and laboratory experiments, we used a natural prey assemblage consisting of the ﬁve most abundant everglades ﬁsh and macroinvertebrate taxa (trexler et al. 2000): riverine grass shrimp (palae- monetes paludosus, gibbes 1850), eastern mosquito- ﬁsh (gambusia holbrooki, girard 1859), blueﬁn killiﬁsh (lucania goodei, jordan 1880), least killiﬁsh (heterandria formosa, girard 1859) and ﬂagﬁsh (jordanella ﬂoridae, goode & bean 1879). we used unbaited minnow traps and dip nets to collect prey from several locations in the everglades. collections of african jewelﬁsh and smaller mayan cichlids were made with unbaited minnow traps along with the prey collections at enp and the big cypress national preserve, while larger mayan cichlids were collected by angling in canals bordering enp and northern water conservation area 3a. similar predator–prey studies for ioannou et al. 2008; cote prior to the ﬁeld experiment, prey were held in 1-m3 in situ enclosures at the ﬁeld site, while predators were held in 1200-l outdoor tanks at enp. for the laboratory experiment, predators and prey were held in 795-l tanks at nova southeastern university’s oceanographic center. predators were collected over the course of 10 weeks, while prey were collected up to 2 weeks before starting both experiments, which falls within the range of holding periods (4–24 weeks; et al. 2010; harcourt et al. 2010; schurch & heg 2010). during the holding period, predators were fed an assortment of live prey ad libitum (including experimental prey taxa), but were starved the evening before behavio- trials. for the ﬁeld experiment, prey fed on ural ambient (e.g., periphyton and infauna added to cages), whereas in the laboratory experi- ment, food ad libitum. in both experiments, prey sizes (carapace or standard length) and wet weights (±1 se), based on a random sample of 60 individuals of each species, were as follows: riverine grass shrimp, 10.33 ± 0.34 mm, 0.10 ± 0.01 g; eastern mosquito- ﬁsh, 18.76 ± 0.45 mm, 0.11 ± 0.01 g; blueﬁn killi- ﬁsh, 23.59 ± 0.44 mm, 0.20 ± 0.01 g; least killiﬁsh, 14.25 ± 0.42 mm, ﬂagﬁsh, 21.01 ± 0.51 mm, 0.35 ± 0.02 g. prey sizes were within the natural range of prey found throughout marshes (trexler et al. 2005), as well as found in gut content analyses of the two predator species (w.f. loftus, unpublished data). commercial ﬂake 0.08 ± 0.01 g;

(primarily eleocharis using a randomised block design, we assigned ﬁve predator treatments to the 25 enclosures: two african jewelﬁsh (jj), two subadult mayan cichlids (mm), one subadult mayan cichlid + 1 african jewelﬁsh (mj, size-matched), one adult mayan cichlid + 1 african jewelﬁsh (mj, mayan cichlid is 2.5 times larger than african jewelﬁsh) and a no-predator treatment (np). we used a replacement series experimental design, where predator density remained constant, allowing us to examine inter- and intraspeciﬁc interactions be- tween the cichlids (sih et al. 1998; schmitz 2007). stocked prey assemblages in each cage consisted of six individuals per prey species (6 · 5 spp. = 30 prey m)2), a prey density that fell within the natural range of everglades marshes (1–55 ﬁsh m)2, trexler et al. 2005; 21–31 ﬁsh m)2, 0–431 grass shrimp m)2, rehage & trexler 2006). the experiment was conducted at the peak of the 2007 wet season (25–29 october) at 33.4 ± 0.6 cm (n = 25) water depth and 26.7 ± 0.2 °c water tem- perature (n = 93). prey were introduced into enclo- sures and allowed to acclimate for 48 h before predator stocking. during this time, we checked for and replaced any prey mortalities (<0.5% of prey were replaced). the experiment ran for 4 days, after which we collected all remaining individuals using dip nets, and by turning enclosures on their side, and manually sorting through the benthos and periphyton. specimens 377 porter-whitaker et al. were preserved in 10% formalin and returned to the laboratory for identiﬁcation and enumeration. predator and prey behaviour laboratory experiment to examine the behavioural interactions among afri- can jewelﬁsh, mayan cichlids and the ﬁve native prey species, we conducted behavioural trials in indoor 56.8-l tanks (50 · 24.5 · 40 cm height). the same ﬁve treatments were assigned to 15 tanks in a randomised block design. behavioural trials were conducted in two 2-day blocks, with 12 replicates per treatment (three replicates per day). block 1 was conducted on 5–6 january 2008 and block 2 on 12–13 january 2008. though the prey assemblage was comprised of the ﬁve species used in the ﬁeld experiment, prey number was reduced to 10 prey ⁄ tank because of the smaller container size and the difﬁculty in observing a large number of prey accurately (2 prey · 5 spp. · 5 treatments · 12 replicates = 600 total prey). to minimise observer disturbance, lateral observa- tions were conducted from behind a blind that surrounded the entire tank area. tanks were covered on three sides and bottom with a white vinyl covering. we provided habitat structure to simulate submerged macrophytes strips (4 · 22 cm) to a weighted 16 · 16 cm black plastic grid, covering 1 ⁄ 3 of the tank bottom and extending through 2 ⁄ 3 of the water column. the water depth matched ﬁeld conditions (33.4 cm), and photoperiod over the course of the experiment was maintained at 12 l ⁄ 12 d. attaching plastic black by the evening before trials began, prey were ran- domly placed in conspeciﬁc pairs and added to the observation tanks to acclimate, while predators were isolated in individual 5.7-l containers (27.5 · 14.5 · 11 cm). the following morning, tanks were checked for prey mortality prior to the start of the experiment, and mortalities were replaced prior to data collection (2% of prey were replaced). for the predator treatments, predators were released into a randomly selected tank, and data collection began 10 min after release. we quantiﬁed predator and prey behaviour through multiple spot check observations conducted at each of the 15 replicate tanks (martin & bateson 2007). tanks were observed in a random order, and a new randomisation was done daily. spot check observations were made in each tank every hour for 6 h, after which the six scores were averaged (dunlop- hayden & rehage 2011). at each spot check, we recorded the activity and microhabitat use of the predators and of each prey. for the prey, we averaged the score of the two individuals of each species to obtain a single value per replicate. activity was scored as ‘0’ if immobile in one location, 378 ‘1’ if there was a slight movement of the body (slow and stop and go swimming for the ﬁshes and movement of appendages for grass shrimp) and ‘2’ if there was constant and ⁄ or faster swimming for the ﬁsh, or any walking or swimming that resulted in a change in location for grass shrimp. microhabitat use by the predators and prey was assessed by noting their vertical distribution within the tank (‘1’ for bottom third, ‘2’ for middle and ‘3’ for the top third of the water column), and whether ﬁsh were in or out of the habitat structure (‘1’ or ‘0’). all observations were conducted between 0900 and 1600 h. predator–predator interactions were counted from spot observations and totalled for the entire trial. they included approaches by one predator to another, schooling of both predators in close proximity (within one body length) and chases with or without physical contact. predators were free ranging, so a small number of predation events were recorded during our observations, accounting for 8% of the prey in the experiment (37 shrimp, ﬁve ﬂagﬁsh, ﬁve least killiﬁsh and two blueﬁn killiﬁsh). consumed prey were not replaced, and data for consumed prey were averaged or counted for period of observation. data analyses for the enclosure study, we compared total and prey- speciﬁc predation rates (number of prey stocked – number recovered after 4 days) using generalised linear mixed models (glmm) that tested prey species, treatment and interaction effects (all ﬁxed) and treated block as a random effect (bolker et al. 2009). we calculated expected predation rates for the mj multiple predator treatment, assuming that each predator had independent effects. we used griffen’s (2006) formula for calculating expected predation: emj = (mjj · mmm)0.5, where mjj and mmm were the prey mortalities in african jewelﬁsh and mayan cichlid predator pairs, respectively. we calculated expected mortality rates separately for each block (crumrine & crowley 2003) and then tested for an emergent multiple predator effect using an anova that compared expected and observed mortalities for the mj treat- ment. for the laboratory data, we used glmms to treatment, block) and examine predator (two-way: prey (three-way factorial: treatment, prey species, treatment x prey species and block) activity, use of habitat structure and vertical distribution, as well as predator–predator interactions. these models treated species and treatment as ﬁxed effects, and block as a random effect. based on the behaviour of residuals (kery & hatﬁeld 2003), raw prey counts and activity values were square root-transformed, while use of habitat structure and distributions were vertical used, arcsin(square interactions were root)- predator transformed to satisfy normality assumptions. in preliminary analyses, we examined the effect of trial time (the six hourly observations per trial) on response variables using repeated measures anovas. no signiﬁcant treatment or species effects were found over the course of the trials (all p > 0.05), so averaged observations over the entire trial period were used for all analyses. least signiﬁcant difference (lsd) pair- wise comparisons and planned orthogonal contrasts (i.e., all predator treatments versus no predator con- trol) were used to compare means. for the pairwise comparisons, we denote signiﬁcant differences at p = 0.05 using letters in bar graphs (figs 1–5). all analyses were performed using proc mixed and proc glm in sasò 9.2 (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa). results predation rates in ﬁeld enclosures predation rates over the 4-day ﬁeld experiment varied as a function of treatment and prey taxa (table 1). as expected, prey mortality was higher in the presence versus absence of predators (fig. 1). prey recovery at

predation on everglades prey the end of the experiment in the no-predator enclo- sures was rather low, 64%, but was signiﬁcantly higher than recovery across predator treatments, 28% (np versus all predator treatments: f1, 16 = 15.3, p = 0.0012). predation rates on all prey combined were highest by the mayan cichlid pair (mm). over the 4 days of the experiment, mayan cichlids consumed on average 23 of the 30 prey stocked, compared to 17 prey consumed by the african jewelﬁsh pair, and 18 prey consumed by the size-matched mj treatment (fig. 1). we detected no evidence that the prey assemblage experienced a release or enhanced predation when both predators were present. total predation by the mj pair was not signiﬁcantly different from rates when predators were alone (mm and jj, fig. 1). based on the substitutive model, expected predation for the mj pair was 19.1 prey, which did not differ from the observed predation rate of 18.4 prey (f1, 8 = 0.07, p = 0.80). further, predation rates did not vary between mj and mj, suggesting that size may not play a critical role in mediating multiple predator effects (at least in the absence of intraguild predation). no african jewelﬁsh mortality was recorded in the mj treatment, despite the size differential. the mm pair consumed not only more prey, but also more prey types than the jj treatment (3 versus 1 prey species, fig. 2). flagﬁsh were readily consumed by all predator combinations and had the lowest mortality in the absence of predators (81.7% across predation treatments versus 13.3% in np). blueﬁn killiﬁsh experienced high mortality only when the predators were mm and mj, while eastern mosquitoﬁsh experi- enced no predation. riverine grass shrimp suffered signiﬁcant mortality relative to the control only in mm treatments (72.5% versus 53%; fig. 2), while least killiﬁsh experienced high mortality both in the pres- ence and absence of predators (78.3% versus 70%). comparing the effects of single versus multiple predators on individual prey species, we found little evidence of changes in risk. flagﬁsh was the only prey consumed in both jj and mm treatments, and their mortality in single predator treatments was similar to that in the two mixed treatments (fig. 2). predator behaviour in laboratory experiment the other predator activity levels for the jj pair were more than double those of treatments (table 1, fig. 3a). activity levels for the mixed-predator treat- ments were similar to those of the mm pair and were unaffected by size. variation in predator–predator interactions mirrored the predator activity results (table 1, fig. 3b). interactions were highest among jj and relatively low in the other two treatments. despite the large disparity in activity levels between 379

and mayan cichlids, their use of tank microhabitats was similar (table 1). predators spent 50–60% of the time in cover (fig. 4a) and mainly occupied the mid- to low water column, with the use of the lower areas increasing for the mj pair (fig. 4b). prey behaviour in laboratory experiment strong antipredator responses, particularly prey- and predator-speciﬁc responses, were seen only in the prey’s activity and not in their use of tank microhab- itats. prey did not alter vertical distributions in response to predators (table 1). in the use of habitat structure, there was lower usage with the mj predator pair (mj versus all other treatments: p < 0.0149). instead, we saw consistent prey-speciﬁc microhabitat use patterns (fig. 4c and d). eastern mosquitoﬁsh and least killiﬁsh occurred highest in the water column and used habitat structure the least, while the opposite pattern was seen for ﬂagﬁsh and riverine grass shrimp. blueﬁn killiﬁsh were found midwater, and their use of structure was intermediate. thus, the more demersal species also appeared to use cover more frequently, suggesting variation in the habitat domain of these species. prey species differed in overall activity levels, but also exhibited distinct responses to the predator treatments (table 1). in general, eastern mosquitoﬁsh and least killiﬁsh were most active, ﬂagﬁsh and blueﬁn killiﬁsh showed intermediate levels of activity, and riverine grass shrimp were least active (fig. 5). yet, prey showed the full gamut of activity responses to 380 predation threats: generalised (i.e., same response to all predator combinations), speciﬁc and no response. generalised responses were seen in ﬂagﬁsh and riverine grass shrimp; both species lowered their activity indiscriminately to all predator combinations relative to the control (fig. 5). speciﬁc antipredator responses were measured for the poeciliids. eastern mosquitoﬁsh lowered their activity markedly in the presence of the african jewelﬁsh pair, while least killiﬁsh responded in the opposite manner by becom- ing more active in the african jewelﬁsh + adult mayan cichlid treatment (fig. 5). lastly, blueﬁn killiﬁsh did not alter activity across predator treat- ments. discussion to drastically alter an earlier invaders have the interactions between sequential potential invader’s abundance, distribution and per capita effects (e.g., o’dowd et al. 2003; grosholz 2005; britton et al. 2010). the presence of one invader may facilitate subsequent invasions or may exacerbate impact by a second invader. alternatively, interactions between invaders may result in displacement of one invader by a later invader. our examination of sequential invasions by two cichlid predators in the everglades revealed no evidence of interactions between the two predators that could alter each species’ predation effects when sympatric. predation rates of the two cichlids together were intermediate to predation rates by each cichlid alone, suggesting no

predators by altering activity levels but not microhab- itat use, which appeared to be consistently varied across prey taxa. in our study, both predators were demersal, and the three species that experienced predation were also demersal, supporting the notion that habitat domain overlap between predators and prey is a key determinant of predation effects (schmitz 2007). but, habitat domain overlap is not the only determinant since we saw differential predation between the two cichlids, with african jewelﬁsh consuming only one of the three prey with which they overlapped in domain, ﬂagﬁsh. we hypothesise two mechanisms for the exclusive predation of african jewelﬁsh pairs on ﬂagﬁsh, despite high encounter rates with three bottom-dwelling prey. first, with the highest biomass of the prey used in the study, ﬂagﬁsh may provide the highest energetic content, and thus may have appeared more proﬁtable to african jewelﬁsh (lima 1998). second, prey novelty may have played a role. non-native predator tactics may be less efﬁcient at catching prey if the interaction is rather novel (salo et al. 2007; sih et al. 2010), despite the prey’s ability to detect and respond to new invaders (dunlop-hayden & rehage 2011). african jewelﬁsh foraging tactics may have been 382 relatively ineffective at capturing everglades prey, being only successful with the slowest, large-sized and most visible prey. overall, our results show that the vulnerability of native everglades prey to non-native cichlid predators was higher for the longer-established mayan cichlid, was unaffected by multiple predators interactions and varied among prey taxa in relation to prey activity levels and microhabitat use. marsh species that were more demersal, overlapping in habitat domain with both predators and were less active appeared to be at higher risk. vulnerability to african jewelﬁsh was lower for two of the ﬁve prey tested, suggesting species-speciﬁc variation in the ability of prey to cope with novel predation, likely related to the prey’s individual evolutionary history and resulting traits (sih et al. 2011). vulnerability to non-native predation was unaffected by sympatry, suggesting that the potential for synergistic and antagonistic effects where these predators co-occur is low. regardless, these non- native cichlids shared prey resources, perhaps with african jewelﬁsh being less effective or more ‘choosy’ and targeting larger prey, while mayan cichlids had greater consumptive effects and on more prey taxa. non-native cichlid predation on everglades prey a

and thus greater consumptive effects in areas where invaders are present (sih et al. 2010), which could be detrimental to higher consumers in the everglades (i.e., wading birds). at minimum, our that african jewelﬁsh may experiments than their represent confamilial mayan cichlid due lower lesser of a predation threat suggest to their predation rates and selective predation. however, seasonal drying limits the abundance of large native piscivores in shorter hydroperiod wetlands of the resulting in lower predation regimes everglades, throughout much of the landscape (trexler et al. 2005). but african jewelﬁsh, with their small body size, seem to cope well with the higher frequency of drydown and are abundant in these shallow habitats (kobza et al. 2004; schoﬁeld et al. 2010), while larger ﬁsh predators, both native and non-native, are 383 porter-whitaker et al. for altered predation regimes excluded. thus, despite their lower predatory effect, african jewelﬁsh may have an important predation effect in parts of the ecosystem that are shallower and experience frequent drydown. as african jew- the elﬁsh continue to expand into coastal areas, potential in other shallow habitats across the everglades landscape (e.g., forested wetlands, freshwater and tidal creeks) deserves the number of invaders continues to increase in the everglades and across aquatic ecosystems globally, the need to better understand the relative impact of non-native predators, the importance of predator– predator interactions to invader success and impact and overall multiple non-native predator effects, will likely increase. as further examination. similarly, acknowledgements this project was funded by the park oriented biological support initiative of the u.s. geological survey
