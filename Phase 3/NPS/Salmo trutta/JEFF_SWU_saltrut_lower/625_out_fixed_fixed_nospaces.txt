climate change; dams; habitat; lakes; latitude; phylogenetics; rivers; impoundment introduction growth rates are vital indicators of ﬁsh population dynamics (ricker 1979; campana & thorrold 2001). a number of core physiological and ecological pro- cesses in ﬁshes are mediated through growth (arendt 1997), and growth plays an essential role in determin- ing ﬁsh secondary production (kwak & waters 1997; pierce & tomcko 2003). variations in growth are inﬂuenced by a range of abiotic and biotic factors that vary both spatially (brandt et al. 1992) and temporally (pereira et al. 1995). for example, climate (rypel 2009), habitat quality (rypel et al. 2006), genetic effects (silverstein et al. 1999), density dependence (pierce et al. 2003) and exploitation (kipling 1983) frequently play large roles in determining growth rates. however, variations in ﬁsh growth are normally examined at relatively small spatial scales, for exam- ple, between nearby systems or, at most, across the scale of a country or regional territory (mann 1997; schindler et al. 2000; rypel et al. 2006). while this allows for more controllable growth comparisons, macrolevel variations in growth frequently go unap- preciated (but see heibo et al. 2005; lappalainen et al. 2008), even though these variations can be criti- cal for understanding broad patterns in ﬁsh ecology correspondence: a. l. rypel, department of fisheries and wildlife, virginia tech, 100 cheatham hall, blacksburg, va 24061-0321, usa. e-mail: andrewrypel@ gmail.com doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00570.x 521 rypel (conover & present 1990) and reﬁning management initiatives (rose & cowan 2000). the northern pike (esox lucius) is a carnivorous ﬁsh species with a holarctic distribution (scott & crossman 1973; becker 1983). as such, it is a com- mon predator- and sport-ﬁsh in lakes and rivers across northern latitudes in north america and eurasia (scott & crossman 1973). described as a cool-water, mesothermic species (becker 1983), pike are often thought to grow best in unexploited, large, deepwater lakes that retain cooler waters and ade- quate prey availability (voellestad 1986; headrick & carline 1993; margenau et al. 1998; pierce & tomcko 2005). pike have been documented to be particularly sensitive to growth stunting as a result of changes in local temperature (diana 1987), ﬁsh density (margenau et al. 1998; pierce & tomcko 2005) and prey availability (diana 1987; venturelli & tonn 2006). considerable debate exists concerning the genetic basis for phenotypic variation in body size and depth between north american and eurasian pike populations (senanan & kapuscinski 2000; jac- obsen et al. 2005; laikre et al. 2005). in particular, north american pike have been frequently and anec- dotally described as seldom reaching the lengths and weights of their eurasian counterparts (buller 1979). however, reports of very large eurasian pike are usu- ally old (pre-1900) and lack validation (buller 1979). more importantly, there has not been a comprehen- sive comparison of growth rates across the range of northern pike to inform whether such observations actually operate at a functional level. increasing threats from climate change suggest that links between pike growth and climate should be investigated at large spatial scales. it has been hy- pothesised that cool-water, circumpolar species, such as northern pike, will be differentially susceptible to global climate change impacts because of evolved patterns of spawning, egg development, hatching times and growth that are purportedly temperature dependant (carpenter et al. 1992; chu et al. 2005; lyons et al. 2010). however, there is not a great amount of information available on potential climate change impacts on northern pike (but see stefan et al. 1995; reist et al. 2006; winﬁeld et al. 2008). lyons et al. (2010) predicted that the geographical range of cool-water species like pike will probably shrink dramatically as a result of climate warming. further- more, recent declines in pike catch per unit effort and weight in lake windermere, uk, might be attributed to high levels of warming (winﬁeld et al. 2008). however, most studies of climate change effects on ﬁshes have focused overwhelmingly on community- level responses to temperature rather than functional- level impacts (e.g., lyons et al. 2010). yet, it is ﬁrst through the modiﬁcation of functional life-history 522 traits that community-level changes are manifested (winemiller & rose 1992; kraft et al. 2008; kraft & ackerly 2010). this study asked ﬁve speciﬁc questions concerning northern pike growth rates at large spatial scales: (i) how do growth rates differ by continent for a species with a holarctic distribution? (ii) how do climate variables affect the growth of northern pike on differ- ent continents and in different regions of continents? (iii) does northern pike growth generally differ between lentic and lotic habitats? (iv) to what extent might compensatory growth for length of growing season operate across latitudes for northern pike, and do these patterns vary by continent? (v) how do other life-history factors (speciﬁcally longevity) vary with latitude on different continents? materials and methods total length (tl)-at-age data were obtained for northern pike populations throughout north america, europe and asia (primarily russia) from available peer-reviewed and grey literature. meta-data were limited to back-calculated lengths-at-age and von bertalanffy growth models from which mean lengths- at-ages could be extracted. standardisation based on back-calculated lengths was attributable primarily to a wider availability of these data, as well as interest in the genetic basis for growth differences as back- calculated lengths emphasise surviving individuals that differentially pass on more genes. data were also limited to studies of populations where investigators had determined ages for >30 individuals (a minimum number that seemed to be used by many management agencies in grey literature reports). in applicable cases, standard and fork lengths were converted to tls (the more frequently reported length metric) using length conversion equations available at http:// www.ﬁshbase.org. hydrologic habitats from which ﬁsh were captured in each study were classiﬁed a posteriori as being lentic or lotic. aerial images from the software pro- gram google earth (mountain view, ca, usa) were used to assess the hydrologic habitat from each study as being lentic or lotic. if there was confusion regard- ing this classiﬁcation [e.g., low retention time reservoirs can often appear riverine and can exert mixed effects on ﬁsh growth (rypel et al. 2006)], the data and study were discarded. a latitude–longitude data point, estimated as the centroid of each aquatic ecosystem, was also collected from each study site using google earth. latitude–longitude data were uploaded into the climate interpolation software pack- age new locclim 1.1 (fao/sdrn, rome, italy). new locclim generates estimates of elevation, and long-term (~50 years) annual averages of temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, pre- cipitation, water vapour pressure, potential evapo- transpiration, wind speed and sunshine fraction based on interpolations of long-term weather station data around a georeferenced point of interest. recent research suggests that growing degree days (gdd) are a strong and underutilised predictor of ﬁsh growth at a variety of scales (neuheimer & taggart 2007; venturelli et al. 2010). thus, we also estimated gdd >10 °c (one of the most common thermals standards used in macro-agricultural studies) for each site using online gdd databases (http://climate.weatherofﬁce. gc.ca/; http://www.weather.com/outdoors/agriculture/ growing-degree-days). a principle component analy- sis (pca) was used to eliminate colinearity of available climate and geographical variables. pca reduced available climatological and geographical data for each site into three new uncorrelated variables (i.e., pcs 1, 2 and 3) for further analysis with growth. these pcs were chosen based on their relatively high eigenvalues and because evaluation of a scree plot revealed a sharp drop in eigenvalues for subsequent pcs (gotelli & ellison 2004). growth differences between lentic and lotic habi- tats and correlations with pcs of climate variables were analysed using analysis of covariance, ancova (sakaris et al. 2006; rypel 2010). two ancova mod- els (one for north america and another for eurasia) were initially run. in each ancova model, each mean lengths-at-age was a dependent variable, hydrologic habitat type (lentic or lotic) was a categorical vari- able, and log10(age), and pcs 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., climate effects) were covariates. because no signiﬁcant effect of hydrologic habitat type was found on either conti- nent, hydrologic habitat types were grouped for all subsequent analyses. next, an ancova was performed northern pike growth as above, but with continent used as the categorical variable instead of hydrologic habitat type. then, based on observed differences in the pike growth and climate data in eurasia, populations were broken up into two separate eurasian regions (‘coastal’ and ‘inland’) based on the hypothesis that ﬁsh in these different regions undergo different climate regimes and thus may also develop different growth variants and climate–growth relationships. furthermore, most inland populations were located in russia and appeared to have a uniquely sparser geographical dis- tribution (fig. 1). thus, data from atlantic coast areas (e.g., ireland, uk, sweden) were grouped into the coastal classiﬁcation, and data from inland eur- asian areas (e.g., russia, ukraine, czech republic) were grouped into the inland classiﬁcation. in north america, coastal data were lacking for northern pike, primarily because of its distribution as an inland ﬁsh on this continent, and thus, this analysis was not pos- sible for pike in north america. ancova was per- formed using this regional classiﬁcation system as a categorical variable to evaluate potential growth dif- ferences among general eurasian regions. a ﬁnal an- cova with tukey’s post hoc comparisons was also performed that compared north american, coastal eurasian and inland eurasian populations in a single analysis. pseudoreplication could be an issue with the above ancovas as multiple mean lengths-at-ages were used for each population whose sample sizes varied unequally (hurlbert 1984). to address this problem, and also to revisit the above approach, all analyses were repeated using a mean residual value approach (benstead et al. 2007; storm & angilletta 2007) for each population. a logarith- mic growth function was ﬁtted to all northern pike the usefulness of 80°n 80°n 60°n aratic circle 60°n 40°n tropic of cancer 20°n equator 0° 20°s tropic of capricorn 40°s 60°s antaretic circle 60°s fig. 1. location of 119 ﬁsh populations used in the meta-analysis. 80°s 80°s 40°n 40°s 20°n 0° 20°s 523 rypel lengths-at-age data from which residual values were generated. mean residual values were then calculated for each population as a relative index of growth for each population, and thus, populations with a nega- tive mean residual would indicate relatively poor growth, whereas a positive mean residual value would indicate relatively strong growth. a logarith- mic function was selected over a von bertalanffy function because it provided a superior statistical ﬁt, especially at older pike ages, concomitant with previ- ous research on the potential ineffectiveness of the von bertalanffy function at modelling growth for ﬁshes with highly indeterminate growth, especially at older ages (roff 1980; haag 2009). each of the above four ancovas were then re-run, but with mean residual value for each population as the dependent variable, pcs 1, 2, 3 as independent variables and continent or region or habitat type as categorical variables. sexual differences in lengths-at-age data were not available for the majority of studies, and thus, it is assumed in this study that a single unisex growth curve sufﬁciently described pike growth at each site. sex-speciﬁc growth data were available for 22 pike populations, and the differences between male and female tl at each age class were calculated and com- pared across systems to assess whether sexual differ- ences in growth were population speciﬁc. an ancova with tukey’s post hoc tests was performed using the difference between male and female tl-at-age as the dependent variable, age as a covariate (because sex differences are increasingly expressed with age) and population as a categorical variable. the ancova model (p < 0.0001, r2=0.47) rightly indicated that age signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the difference between male and female tl (p < 0.0001). however, after accounting for the difference between male-to-female tl did not differ signiﬁ- cantly between any pike population. thus, sexual dif- ferences in pike growth appear to be highly stable across populations, and a single tl-at-age data set for both sexes likely accurately reﬂects average pike growth across populations. the effect of age, countergradient growth rates appear to be a com- mon feature of ﬁshes with broad geographical distri- butions. countergradient growth is deﬁned as a capacity for faster subannual growth in higher-lati- tude populations as a compensation mechanism for shorter growing seasons (conover & present 1990; conover & schultz 1995; conover et al. 2009). while countergradient effects are often evaluated in the laboratory by rearing juvenile ﬁshes from various populations under standardised conditions (conover & present 1990; schultz et al. 1996; conover et al. 1997), such effects can also be investigated using basic lengths-at-age data (power & mckinley 1997; 524 chavarie et al. 2010). to examine countergradient variations using lengths-at-age data, comparisons should be made at a standardised age prior to sexual maturation to eliminate the effects of variable repro- ductive development times and energy allocation dynamics for somatic versus gonadal growth (power & mckinley 1997). thus in this study, age-speciﬁc estimates of countergradient growth are presented for age classes 1–3 with age class 3 representing pre- cisely 20% of the maximum observed longevity observed for northern pike (15 years). normalised growth rates were computed by dividing average tl- at-age in question for each population by an estimate of gdd accrued over life to that point, that is, mean annual gdd 9 age (power & mckinley 1997). nor-  1) were then log- malised growth values (mm·gdd transformed and linearly regressed against latitude to evaluate whether signiﬁcant countergradient growth patterns were present by continent. power & mckin- ley (1997), chavarie et al. (2010) and rypel (2011) used this same approach to evaluate apparent count- ergradient growth variations in lake sturgeon (aci- penser fulvescens), arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) and ﬁve north american catﬁshes. similarly, rela- tionships between maximum age and latitude were examined on both continents using linear regressions of maximum observed age for each population against latitude. all statistics were considered signiﬁ- cant at a < 0.05. assumptions and limitations are inherent to meta- analyses (egger et al. 1997). in this study, one assumption was that ageing error was homogenous across studies. this is likely an appropriate assump- tion considering the many readers used to generate the lengths-at-age data ultimately used in this study. however, error across ageing structures (i.e., a com- bination of otoliths, vertebrae and scales) should also be acknowledged. scales in particular might be prob- lematic for northern pike age estimation (frost & kipling 1959; mann & beaumont 1990; laine et al. 1991). therefore, caution was taken in including age data generated from scales. data from scale studies were scrutinised by carefully reading each study, evaluating age data and ultimately discarding studies that clearly appeared unreasonable (e.g., likely age under-estimates based on experience reading numer- ous pike age and growth studies). furthermore, statis- tics for this study were repeated using only nonscale studies (appendix s2); however, because no major changes in signiﬁcance were found, scale studies were included in the reported analysis. finally, other growth drivers (e.g., physicochemistry, density and pollution) were left unexamined in this study. while including many of these factors would be optimal, it is often unreasonable because these data often do not exist, and many of these factors might be more important at the intrasystem level (e.g., between lakes rather than lakes versus rivers). ultimately, meta- analyses of growth remain one of the few tools avail- able for ﬁsheries scientists to explore large-scale driv- ers of ﬁsh growth (helser & lai 2004; rypel 2011). results the ﬁnal data set on pike growth included informa- tion from a total of 119 pike populations and 908 mean lengths-at-ages across north america and eur- asia (fig. s1). a total of 695 mean lengths-at-ages representing 90 populations were derived from lentic habitats whereas 212 mean lengths-at-ages represent- ing 29 populations were derived from lotic habitats. table 1. pc loadings and % contribution of variables (in parentheses) extracted from pca of geographical and climatological variables at each site. eigenvalues were 5.7, 3.3 and 1.1 for pcs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. other pcs were not used because eigenvalues were <1.0. pcs 1, 2 and 3 were subsequently used as covariates in ancova evaluations of pike growth. geographical/climatological variable latitude longitude elevation potential evapotranspiration annual precipitation sunshine fraction mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature growing degree days water vapour pressure wind speed pc 2 pc 3 pc 1  0.80 (11.2)  0.49 (7.2) 0.15 (1.9)  0.09 (3.8) 0.54 (15.3)  0.43 (14.2) 0.01 (0.1) 0.21 (16.5) 0.95 (8.7) 0.88 (23.2)  0.07 (0.5) 0.41 (3.0)  0.71 (2.8)  0.39 (12.2) 0.46 (7.4) 0.68 (4.0) 0.50 (0.0) 0.20 (27.1) 0.65 (16.7)  0.31 (0.7) 0.37 (0.3)  0.28 (0.2) 0.57 (0.1) 0.67 (15.8) 0.90 (14.3)  0.25 (1.9)  0.06 (0.3)  0.06 (7.2)  0.15 (9.7) 0.97 (7.8) 0.94 (15.5)  0.26 (2.1) 0.04 (0.1)  0.04 (1.2)  0.04 (42.7) 0.94 (4.5) northern pike growth pca generated three principle components that described 84% of variation in climate and geographi- cal variation across sites (table 1). pc1 was driven almost exclusively by temperature variation. the four temperature metrics (mean, maximum, minimum temperature and gdd) and water vapour pressure and latitude (also highly temperature sensitive) com- bined to describe 82% of variability in pc1. pc2 was driven primarily by evapotranspiration, sunshine frac- tion (i.e., cloudiness) and longitude – combining to explain 66% of variability in pc2. pc3 was driven primarily by wind (43%) along with altitude, precipi- tation and longitude to explain 86% of variation in pc3. log10(age) was after log-transformation of age and pca transfor- mation of climate variables, assumptions of normality were met for all ancova models. all ancova models length data were highly signiﬁcant that used all (table 2). unsurprisingly, signiﬁ- cantly and positively correlated with tl in every age-speciﬁc ancova model. in the north american analysis, growth correlated signiﬁcantly and posi- tively with pc1 – a temperature factor – and possibly negatively with pc 3 – a wind and precipitation fac- tor (table 2). in the eurasian analysis, no pc was a signiﬁcant covariate of pike growth (table 2). after accounting for climate effects on growth, there was no difference in growth between hydrological habitat types in either north america or eurasia (fig. 2, table 2). in a third ancova model, growth was sig- niﬁcantly higher for eurasian compared to north america pike (fig. 2, table 2). in eurasia, coastal pike populations had signiﬁcantly higher growth compared to inland pike populations, and growth did not correlate with pc 1, but did correlate negatively table 2. results of ancova for effects of continent, hydrologic habitat type and climate on growth of northern pike. pcs 1, 2 and 3 are composite indices of climate;

however, these patterns were visibly weaker in eurasia (fig. 3a). furthermore, differences in the temperature –latitude gradient can also be observed for the coastal and inland eurasian sites. signiﬁcant ‘apparent’ countergradient variations in growth were observed 526 for northern pike in both north america and eurasia (fig. 3b). slopes of these relationships differed between north america and eurasia at age classes 1 and 2 but did not differ at age-3 (table 3). further- more in eurasia, slopes of countergradient relation- ships simply remained consistent over age classes, whereas in north america slopes declined with age (table 3). r2 values of apparent countergradient rela- tionships were noticeably higher for north america versus eurasia (table 3). maximum pike age was signiﬁcantly related to latitude in north america, but not in eurasia (fig. 3c). discussion northern pike growth rates varied at different spatial scales. at the circumpolar scale, signiﬁcant differ- ences in climate–neutral growth curves were observed for pike between continents. furthermore, strong cor- relations between growth and climate and latitude were found in north america, while these same pat- terns were considerably weaker in eurasia. pike growth did not vary across hydrologic habitat types on either continent. these data underscore the highly variable and scale-dependant nature of northern pike growth. below, i explore these results in ﬁner detail and address the implications of these patterns for ) (a) c o ( e r u t a r e p m e t l a u n n a n a e m 12 9 6 3 0 30 40 50 latitude 60 70 (b) ) 1 – d d g m m · , e t a r h t w o r g ( g o l northern pike growth 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 30 (c) ) s r a e y ( e g a m u m x a m i 16 12 8 4 0 40 50 latitude 60 70 30 40 50 latitude 60 70 fig. 3.

aguilar et al. 2005; jacobsen et al. 2005; laikre et al. 2005). current genetic analyses retain that e. lucius is a single circumpolar distribution; however, signiﬁcant genetic variations do exist across its range. in particular, there are apparent genetic variations between north american, west european and eurasian (russian) pike stocks (senanan & kapu- scinski 2000; jacobsen et al. 2005; laikre et al. 2005) – groupings that are not dissimilar to the north american coastal eurasian, and inland eurasian climate–growth groupings found in this study. this meta-analysis of growth rates therefore supports the potential existence of distinct e. lucius genetic units; however, additional phylogenetic research is required on this topic. in north america, annual growth rates of pike decreased with increasing latitude. it was also revealed that the main climate driver of this pattern was apparently temperature. concordant with this gradient, and basic principles of bioenergetics (lopez- lluch et al. 2006), was a predictable lengthening of lifespan in pike populations with increasing lati- tude. myriad other poikilothermic animals in north america present these same correlations between growth, longevity, latitude and climate (rypel 2010, 2011; haag & rypel 2011). however, that northern pike are widely regarded as a cool-water ﬁsh species makes this case a particularly intriguing example. the implication of these data is that basic laws of thermodynamics and bioenergetics also apply to cool-water species like northern pike (i.e., growth of cool-water species increases with temperature to some thermal maxima), and other studies of pike and cool-/cold-water ﬁsh growth support this ﬁnding (paukert & willis 2003; matta et al. 2010). conse- quently, it is possible that the range of northern pike is not limited by temperature per se as much as by other factors (e.g., competition with nonglaciated predator species, availability of key prey types). this hypothesis is also supported by successful introduc- tions of northern pike into some relatively warm- water ecosystems around the globe such as in cali- fornia, morocco, spain and tunisia (welcomme 1988; elvira 1995; aguilar et al. 2005). there is a clear need to better identify contributory factors to pike declines and range shifts as this information would assist in identifying potential warning signs and particularly vulnerable regions to pike losses. 527 rypel in eurasia, northern pike annual growth rates showed notably weaker relationships with latitude and climate. these results also indicate patterns that deserve future research consideration as the climatic system in eurasia seems to function in a fundamen- tally different way compared to north america (fig. 3a). the spatial heterogeneity in the thermal opportunity for growth across eurasia also suggests that similar (i.e., weaker) climate–growth patterns could be manifested, not just for pike, but perhaps many eurasian ﬁshes (mäkinen et al. 2002; dunca et al. 2005; black 2009; rypel 2009). this raises an important question of whether ﬁsh growth paradigms and conceptual frameworks developed from study sites on one continent would be at all appropriate for studies on other continents. growth and climate– growth coupling also differed substantially between pike populations in mainland eurasian populations (e.g., russia) compared to coastal european popula- tions (e.g., in ireland, scotland and the uk). as one example, high-latitude pike populations in the uk (~58°n) can have a growing season that is more than triple in length compared to populations at the same latitude in parts of russia. signiﬁcant differences obviously exist in the ecology of eurasian pike stocks that should be investigated in more detail, par- ticularly by examining genetic variations among vari- ous stock groups. however, the lack of correlation between pike growth and pc1 in the eurasian models strongly suggests that temperature and climate play a far less prominent role in structuring eurasian pike growth. thus, local growth drivers (i.e., productivity, density, prey availability) likely play larger roles for eurasia pike. it is all together possible that eurasian pike, whose growth is not as strongly coupled to cli- mate, might be more resilient to impacts of climate change compared to north american pike. there is increasing recognition of the signiﬁcance of latitudinal countergradients in ﬁsh growth (schultz et al. 1996; conover et al. 1997, 2009; trussell 2002; niewiarowski & angilletta 2008). it may seem counterintuitive that subannual pike growth (e.g.,  1) would actually be higher in colder envi- mm·gdd ronments. this paradox arises from differences in and a lack of accounting for the thermal opportunity for growth (power & mckinley 1997). thus, while pike grow to larger sizes at the same age in the south, northern ﬁsh populations are forced to grow faster during a shorter growing season window (i.e., suban-  1). latitudinal countergradients nually – mm·gdd in growth are in fact quite common and have now been documented for a diverse number of ﬁshes (conover & present 1990; conover et al. 1997; power & mckinley 1997; chavarie et al. 2010; rypel 2011). one particularly interesting result from this study was the notably weaker countergradient 528 growth relationships observed for eurasian compared to north american pike. this result is congruent with hypotheses of chavarie et al. (2010) who similarly identiﬁed differences in the thermal opportunity for growth between eastern canada and coastal nor- way. here, we conﬁrm that differences in apparent countergradient growth variations exist between con- tinents, but for a different circumpolar ﬁsh species, the northern pike. northern pike showed no differences in growth between lentic and lotic habitats on either continent. these results conﬂict with those of penczak (2007) who found faster growth of lentic compared to lotic northern pike in europe. however, a much smaller meta-database (n = 6 lengths-at-age studies) was assembled for the penczak (2007) study and effects of covariates were not addressed. the results of this larger study highlight the cosmopolitan nature of pike in relation to habitat and challenge the popular notion that pike are a principally lake-adapted species. many lotic ecosystems appear to have excellent pike popu- lations that can support vigorous growth. the number of published studies available suggests that stream and river pike populations are woefully understudied and that considerably more information is needed on these populations to properly inform management. managers are encouraged to assess population char- acteristics of lotic pike populations to better evaluate the extent to which pike population characteristics in lotic systems can vary. pike may also have equivalent growth rates in lotic compared to lentic ecosystems, but because of lower densities, which would ulti- mately be reﬂected in reduced production and not growth. further research on lotic pike population characteristics, density, biomass and secondary pro- duction can help better resolve these questions. cool-water ﬁsh species are thought to be differen- tially affected by recent climate change, and northern pike are often cited as an example of a species that could be particularly vulnerable to warming (chu et al. 2005; winﬁeld et al. 2008; lyons et al. 2011). however, this study revealed that pike growth rates can show complex, nonlinear trends that are variable at multiple scales, including in their interaction with climate. a potential ﬂaw in current ﬁsheries climate change models is the over-reliance on community and abundance data, and the assumption that func- tional traits like growth remain spatially and tempo- rally static. yet as this study and others (pereira et al. 1995; paukert & fisher 2001; rypel 2011) have shown, ﬁsh growth rates vary tremendously at differ- ent temporal and spatial scales. furthermore, there is even less knowledge on how other functional life- history traits might be affected by warming (e.g., spawning timing, egg survival and recruitment). that northern pike growth rates were in fact higher in lower warmer, more southern latitudes suggests that as growing seasons lengthen across the continent, pike growth might actually be enhanced at all scales in the short term, but especially in colder, northern regions where genetic stocks have evolved to grow maxi- mally during the available growing season window (i.e., because of compensatory growth, fig. 3b). however, trophic-level productivity would need to keep pace with increasing pike metabolic demands over the long term. thus, long-term impli- cations of warming on growth and population dynamics for pike are unclear and deserve research attention. under various long-term warming scenar- ios, it is possible that northern pike stocks would rap- idly and backwardly evolve (hendry et al. 2000; losos et al. 2006) to lose or weaken their genetic basis for compensatory growth. this could ultimately mean that pike become slower growing in northern areas making them even more susceptible to stunting. in lake windermere, uk, this exact pattern may already be playing out – increased pike sizes during short-term warming followed by long-term declines in pike size coincident with long-term warming (winﬁeld et al. 2008). (i.e., compensatory effects of warming on pike and perhaps other cool-water species might not be as straightforward as is commonly thought, and could be highly scale dependent. this framework aligns with previous speculation that effects of climate change on species displaying countergradient) growth may be highly nonlinear and counterintuitive (jobling 1997). in species with large geographical ranges, multiple genetically unique stocks often exist with growth plans that are a product of regionally endemic climate–growth relationships (worm & myers 2004; gienapp et al. 2008; hauser & carvalho 2008). thus, it is possible that north american pike growth could be more responsive to effects of climate change, whereas eurasian pike growth may be more resilient to climate change effects. consequently, i suggest that climate change models in ﬁsheries might be improved by capturing data on growth rates, climate–growth relationships and other functional metrics and integrating this information across large spatial and temporal scales. acknowledgements funding was provided by the virginia tech department of fish and wildlife conservation and us forest service agree- ment
