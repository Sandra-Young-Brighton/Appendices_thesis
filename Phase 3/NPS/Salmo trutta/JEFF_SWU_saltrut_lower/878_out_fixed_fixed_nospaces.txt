and the signs of reduced recruitment have been observed in continental europe since the early 1970s. to aid recovery of the european eel, stocking is used by many european countries as a manage- ment option. in this study, tagging experiments were conducted to follow eel migration from lake mälaren and four sites along the swedish east coast in the baltic sea. the recaptured tagged eels were retrieved from fishermen, allowing for the opportunity to investigate their origin (brackish water, stocked in freshwater or a mix in between) by otolith microchemistry and to assess for morphological differences after tagging. several changes took place; for example, eye index increased while weight and condition decreased with migrated distance and time until recap- ture. in lake mälaren, the majority of tagged eels did not migrate out of the outlets, irrespective of their origin. most of them were caught in the opposite direction and continued to be caught in the lake 1–3 years after tagging, with significant weight losses. overall, overwintering is suggested to be an inferior option, but it is uncertain whether this is a natural behaviour or a result of trans- location and restocking. for coastal eels, origin had no effect on migratory behav- iour; a majority of the tagged eels migrated towards the outlet of the baltic sea. interestingly, a minority of the recaptured eels originated from stocked fish. instead, recaptures were dominated by natural immigrants that had spent most of their lives in brackish waters. k e y w o r d s anguilla anguilla, silver eel, carlin

[l.]) have been observed ever since the early 1970s (svärdson, 1976). the natural recruitment is just a few per cent of historical levels (dekker, 2003), and several hypotheses are proposed for the decline, among others; over- fishing, pollution, parasites, migration obstacles, reduced grow- ing areas, turbine mortality and changed oceanic conditions. the situ- ation has motivated eu (the european union) to introduce a regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the stock (ec 2007). accord- ing to this regulation, member states are obliged to produce eel man- agement plans for the stocks on their territory (there is only one stock for eel). the main objective is to allow 40% of spawners (silver eels) from a pristine stock to migrate towards the spawning area in the sargasso sea (ec, 2007). besides reduced fishing and hydro power mortalities, restocking with eels from areas with a surplus of young recruits (glass eels) is proposed as a possible measure in the eel reg- ulation. restocking will also most probably be eligible for economical support from eu’s maritime fishing fund (emff). ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:517–532. wileyonlinelibrary.com/eff © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd  |  517 518 |  as a consequence of the regulation and the financial support from eu, the approved management plans from many european states are more or less based on restocking to improve the production of spawn- ers. this has been discussed and questioned (eifaac/ices 2011; ices 2011), but restocking has become the most direct measure to enhance the eel stock, especially in countries around the baltic sea where the natural immigration is believed to be generally low (eu com/2014/0640 final). the benefit of eel stocking has been questioned by several researchers. westin (2003) claimed that stocking programmes just facilitate a fishery but do not increase the eel population as stocked eels lacking behavioural cues would later be unable to find the way back to the spawning grounds once in the silver eel stage. the con- clusion was based on tagging experiments which showed exam- ples of deviant behaviour compared to earlier tagging. stocked eels migrated in the wrong direction and with a high degree of overwin- tering (westin, 1990, 1998). however, the generality of these stud- ies could be questioned, in part because of the geography (most of the eels were tagged and released at the island of gotland, which is far from the mainland coast where earlier tagging studies were con- ducted), and in part because experimental designs differed, with long distance transportation and several weeks of delay before release. all in all, the gotland tagging yielded very few recaptures in the sea com- pared to the conventional silver eel tagging in the baltic sea area (ask & erichsen, 1976). more recent experiments in a german river near the baltic coast showed former stocked eels to have an initial delay to their migration and that recaptured eels decrease in body length and weight, which was attributed to the stocked origin (prigge, marohn, & hanel, 2013). the study, however, had no naturally immigrated con- trols for comparisons. recent work from canada on the outcome from full scale stocking experiments with american eel (anguilla rostrata) in upper st. lawrence and in lake ontario has raised serious concerns and new knowledge on the use of translocated glass eels to enhance the local eel stock (pavey et al., 2015). in contrast to the old and large female silver eels normally produced in this area, translocated glass eels from the coast of eastern canada (maritime provinces) grow fast, mature at a younger age, at a smaller size and with an increasing incidence of male eels. this cannot be explained as phenotypic plasticity only; polygenic dif- ferences apparently discriminates these two habitat- specific ecotypes within the same panmictic population. both genotype- dependent habitat choice and intragenerational spatially variable selection are proposed as explanations by the authors (pavey et al., 2015). whether any of these mechanisms could explain the findings in our study is not known. since time immemorial humans have moved fish in general and perhaps eels in particular (dekker & beaulaton, 2016). the economical value in combination with the fact that eel is a hardy species makes them suitably for stocking purposes. in sweden, the authority encour- aged stocking activities starting from the end of 19th century (trybom, 1893), and in the early 20th century eel stocking programmes started in sweden and other countries around the baltic sea (sjöberg & peters- son, 2005). large amounts of eels have been stocked in freshwaters of poland and germany, and since 1910s more than a billion of small eels have been stocked in the baltic sea drainage area (dekker & beaula- ton, 2016; sjöberg & petersson, 2005). in recent years, the majority of the imported glass eels are from river severn in england, but in some years, there were also imports from france. in the past, also large quantities have been translocated nationally as medium- sized yellow eels (bootlace), for example from the swedish west coast to inland lakes (holmgren & wickström, 1988). for these reasons, it is important: • to investigate further whether stocked eels do migrate in the same way as natural ones and to determine where stockings are effective in increasing the spawning stock. • to investigate how morphological characteristics, origin (stocked/ natural) and growing area (coastal/lake) affect migration patterns. • to examine how morphological characters change after tagging and during the migration as a way to predict/assess the chance of successful migration. based on an applied study on the outcome from stocking (sjöberg, wickström, & petersson, 2008), silver eels were caught in the autumn, both along the east coast and in lake mälaren. they were tagged and released in direct connection to where they were fished. life history (stocked or natural) was unknown beforehand, but in contrast to earli- er experiments, the recaptured eels were brought back from the fishery and analysed to determine the eel’s origin and to derive measurements of physical changes after migration (eye size, length and weight). from these parameters, eye and condition index were estimated and togeth- er with length and weight correlated with the eel’s origin and migration behaviour. 2 |  material and methods 2.1 | study area and fisheries the baltic sea is a 377,000 km2 brackish sea in northern europe, which drains through several narrow and shallow straits in the south- west via the kattegat/skagerrak into the north sea and the atlantic ocean. the average depth of the baltic is 62 m, with a maximum of 459 m. most of the east coast of sweden is domi- nated by rocky shores and archipelagos, but towards the south, there are more open and sandy shores. the salinity of surface waters varies from 1‰ to 5‰ in the north to 10‰ to 15‰ in the southern parts. approximately 500 km3 of freshwater enters the baltic annually and on average about the same amount of sea water comes in through the straits in the south (elmgren & hill, 1997). lake mälaren is the third largest lake in sweden (1,140 km2) and drains into the baltic sea via two sluices and one rapid in stockholm city centre (latitude 59°20′ n) and one sluice in södertälje (latitude 59°11′ n) 35 km south- west of stockholm. it is a shallow nutrient rich lake with an average depth of 13 m. maximum depth is 64 m, and the sjöberg et al.sjöberg et al.   | 519 lake spans 120 km from west to east near the outlet connection to the baltic sea. for the geographical distribution of the fishery and for a more detailed description of the lake, see westerberg and sjöberg (2015). eel occurs in many different coastal and inland habitats all over the baltic area. stock densities vary naturally as well as due to human activities (e.g. construction of migration obstacles and stockings of young eels), but the stock densities decline rapidly north from väddö (fig. 1). in the baltic, the onset of maturation to the silver eel stage starts earlier in summertime in the north and continues during autumn further south. an extensive fishing occurs from about 200 km north of stockholm along the east coast of sweden and at the danish coast and in the straits between denmark–germany and denmark–sweden (the öresund strait). the fishing gears used are large pound nets (berntsson, 1971). it is generally believed that the pound net fishery targets silver eel derived from all over the baltic area. historical tag experiments showed that the general direction for eel originating in the east- ern parts of the baltic (finland, estonia and latvia) was to migrate westerly across the baltic towards the outlet straits (määr, 1947). outside the baltic outlet, north of the öresund strait, there is no fishery for silver eel. 10°e 60°n 57°n 54°n 10°e 20°e väddö n mälaren marsö borgholm 57°n hanö 54°n 20°e figure 1 map of the study area, the release sites and an illustration of a carlin tagged

(dst) was implanted. results from dst tags are presented sepa- rately in westerberg and sjöberg (2015). ball eels in this tag experiment were also tagged with external telemetry tags (vemco), but the results are not presented in this study. 2.2 | tagging and release during the autumn of 2006 and 2008, silver eels (n = 1,197) were caught with pound nets at four different locations along the swedish baltic sea coast and in lake mälaren (fig. 1, table 1). eels were classified as migrants after examining their external appearance. length and weight were measured, and the maturity of each eel was judged from the ratio between eye- area and body length (pankhurst, 1982) as ei = 25π 8tl a + b2 r l +a + b2 where a and b are the horizontal and vertical eye diameters respectively, tl is the total length, and r and l are right and left eyes respectively. pankhurst (1982) classified eels with an eye index larger than 6.5 as silver eels. the condition index was calculated according to fulton (1904) as cl = w l3 where w = the weight of the fish, and l is the total length. the eels were tagged with a carlin dangler (a 18 × 4 mm plas- tic plate, cf. carlin, 1955; mcfarlane, wydoski, & prince, 1990) that was attached in front of the dorsal fin (fig. 1). as the carlin tags were small, it was assumed that their influence on the large a. anguilla used was minimal (jepsen, koed, thorstad, & baras, 2002). the fish were released at the site where they were captured. each tag had a unique number and information about what to do with a recaptured eel (freeze the fish and contact the swedish board of fisheries for fur- ther details, reward, etc.). information about the study was given to eel fishermen associations and in the trade press. 2.3 | recaptures eels were recaptured by swedish and danish fishermen and sent to the institute of freshwater research. eye diameter, total length and weight were measured. as the eels had been frozen before analyses, length and weight were corrected for shrinkage (wickström, 1986). ear stones (otoliths) were used for ageing and prepared for otolith microchemical analyses. the fat content was measured by the ec method (anon 1998), that is a solvent extraction- gravimetric method. an eye index was used to decide maturation stage according to pankhurst (1982). the condition index was calculated according to fulton (1904), and age readings were taken by counting winter zones in the sagittae otolith (svedäng, wickström, reizenstein, holmgren, & florenius, 1998). prevalence and intensity of the infestation of the parasitic nematode anguillicola crassus were determined according to methods described in wickström, clevestam, and höglund (1998). migrated distance from place of release to recapture was measured as the shortest route in open water (arcgis version 9.3). the migration speed was derived as the distance covered in km day−1. in the lake mälaren experiment, most eels recaptured were mainly released again to give them a second chance to find the outlet, especially during the first year after tagging. later on, after two winter seasons, the eels still caught in the lake were collected for dissection procedures as described above. 2.4 | presentation of the characteristics tables 4–7 describe four different characteristics (ei [eye index], ci [condition index], weight and length) in relation to time until recapture (time) and migrated distance (distance). we present results for these characteristics taken at tagging (tag) and as a change from tagging until recapture. the change is calculated as change = (tag − rec) tag where rec is the corresponding measurement taken after the recaptured eels have been collected from the fisher. a difference for tag indicates a predetermined difference as measurements were taken before the tagging and release. a difference for change describes if the eels have changed individually during migration from tagging until recapture. in our calculations, time and distance are dependent on the characteristics of the eel (ci, ei, weight or length), which then are independent variables and predict after how long migrated distance or after how long time the eels are sjöberg et al.sjöberg et al.   | 521 (a) (b) (c) (d) figure 2 examples of strontium (sr) level in the otoliths of recaptured eels from this study representing, (a and b) stocked in

corresponding microscope image is inserted 522 |  recaptured. on the other hand, when analysing the change of the characteristics, it is the time or distance which is the predictor. the calculations are presented with or without overwintered eels and the tagging inside lake mälaren (tables 4–7). this is to better understand the quite complex relationship that shows in the material of tagged eels. 2.5 | analysis of sr/ca data from otoliths the strontium (sr) levels in the otoliths were determined with analysis made at lund nuclear microprobe laboratory, using par- ticle induced x- ray emission spectrometry (μpixe, malmqvist et al., 1993). recaptured eels were divided into three different groups according to their origin and habitat preference based on the strontium level. the interpretation of data was based on a reference material of known origin (tzeng, severin, & wickström, 1997). the decision that eels were of stocked origin was made according to clevestam and wick- ström (2008). analysing sr/ca ratios with pixe as in this case gives slightly higher values than from an electron microprobe (emp), but the form of the transects is the same (campana et al., 1997). examples of the three types are shown in fig. 2(a–d); • • • sfw—stocked in freshwater. eels have been stocked into fresh- water at a small size, stayed there (fig. 2a) or migrated out to the coast later on (fig. 2b). bw—brackish water. after arriving to baltic sea waters the eels have stayed in coastal areas (fig. 2c). in this group, there are supposed to be a large majority of natural immigrants, but there may also be some stocked eel, the ones stocked on the coast which we were not able to distinguish from the natural recruits. bw & fw—brackish and freshwater. after living their first years in a brackish environment, they have migrated or been translocated into a freshwater lake (fig. 2d). table 2 number of eels used in the tagging experiment ( ntag) nrec year 2 release place 1 10 54 (r27, k17) 0 0 0

means have been analysed using t- test (two samples) of least- square means from mixed linear models. if the data were not normally distributed, normality was achieved using log- transformation prior to analyses. in one- way models with het- erogeneous variance, multiplicity adjustments were made using dunnett’s t3 method (dunnett, 1980), which is based on the stu- dentised maximum modulus. the dependence of several variables on independent variables was analysed with mixed model covariance analyses: first release site and independent variable and the inter- action was used, release site and interaction being random effects and the independent variable fixed effect. if the interaction was not significant, it was removed from the model and analyses were run once more, with release site as random effect and the inde- pendent variable as fixed effect. the estimate of the slope from that model was used to illustrate the relation between dependent and independent variables. the dependence of binary responses (leaving or not leaving a lake) on various predictors (independent variables) was analysed using logistic regression. to compensate for over- dispersion, the dispersion parameter was estimated by the pearson chi- squared statistic divided by its degrees of freedom. all values are given as mean ± standard deviation, if not otherwise stated. two- way frequency tables were analysed using pearson’s chi- squared test with yate’s correction for continuity. for statistical analyses, sas statistical software is used. 3 |  results 3.1 | general characteristics of 1,197 a.

were recaptured again (r13). four eels of the 58 were killed (k4) and sampled. the second year (2009), 54 other eels were recaptured; in addition, 27 were recaptured for more than one time (first years recaptures included, which means that when an eel recaptured and released in 2008 (from the 58) was recaptured again in 2009, the eel was included among those 27). in the second year, 17 eels were killed and collected for dissection. third year (2010), 8 new eels were recaptured (never caught in year 1 or 2). nine eels, already caught for one or several times in year 1, 2 (not 3 since all 17 were killed), were caught again, and 17 eels were killed. year 4, four new eels were recaptured and killed, and year 5, one new eel caught and brought to laboratory. sjöberg et al.sjöberg et al.

released and caught again 4 months later, but this time in the sound between denmark and sweden as expected for silver eels on their way to spawning grounds. the fish were all caught along the swedish and danish shores, and none was recaptured in the kattegat or skagerrak as there are no fisheries for migrating eels migrating north of the öresund strait. eels tagged at marsö and borgholm located near and inside kalmar strait moved slower than eels from other coastal sites (table 3). a majority of the recaptures were made the same autumn that the eels were tagged. however, some overwintering also occurred, especially in the lake mälaren where recaptured eels were found up till 4 years after release (fig. 4). the release site in lake mälaren was in the eastern half of the lake, but eels were recaptured predominately fur- ther inside the lake and in the opposite direction of the outlet (fig. 4). when reports of tagged eels began to appear from the western part of the lake, fishermen were asked to re- release the eels for the chance to investigate the continuation of their migration. as can be seen in table 2, eels were re- released (denoted with r) the first 3 years, some were collected/killed (k) and 19 eels were recaptured more than two times. one eel was caught six times and after the last time col- lected for dissection procedures. two eels were first captured about 40 km westerly in the lake. after one and two overwintering seasons, they were caught out on the coast 528 and 214 km from the release site respectively (fig. 4, id a839 and a799). a839 lost 31% in weight after 1 year from tagging and was either natural immigrated or stocked as a bootlace (type fig. 2d). a799 was of stocked origin (type fig. 2a) and had lost 17% of its body weight at the time of recapture, almost 2 years after tagging. overwintering was also seen in some of the eels tagged at the northernmost area (väddö), located reasonably close to lake mälaren. one eel from the tagging in 2006 and 10 eels in 2008 overwintered (table 2). one of the overwintered eels (2008) was caught 26 km north of the release site in july and then caught again 4 months later; this time around 800 km further south near the danish island mön with a 19% decrease in body weight (origin unknown). results from the coastal tagging show that fat content was posi- tively correlated with the eel length (p = .022, slope = 0.0052, t = 2.31, n = 218) and weight (p = .0054, slope = 0.0023, t = 2.81, n = 218). fat content did not correlate to migrated distance, condition index or time until recapture (p > .15 in all cases, place of release included as random factor). in lake mälaren, the recaptures were not measured for fat con- tent (numbers in table 3 are from a reference material). 524 |   ) ( % w

lake when the condition index was 0.265, but at average condition index (0.20, see table 1), the probability of leaving the lake was just 5% during the study period (2008–2012; no recaptures in 2013

four which were recaptured outside the lake, three from the type translocated/natural and one 3.3.2 | on the coast regardless of their origin, all but one (top in fig. 1 and mentioned above) recaptured eels migrated south, towards the outlet straits of the baltic sea. a majority had grown up in brackish coastal water and had not spent any part of their lives in freshwater habitats. among the 213 recaptures, 194 were presumable natural immigrants which have lived and grown up on the coast. eighteen had been stocked as imported elvers into freshwater (type as in fig. 2a,b), while the remaining single eel most certainly was a translocated bootlace (excluded in the following analysis). a number of variables were tested to see if the two groups differed from each other and if migration diverged regarding direction or speed. the migration speed did not differ (p = .97) where the speed was 11.1 km day−1 for both the ones stocked in freshwater and eels originating from coastal waters (conf. limits 5.6–16.7 and 1.8–20.5 respectively). the eels stocked in freshwater were older (p = .024) than the coastal eels (15.3 vs. 13.9, conf. limits 13.9–16.7 and 12.1–15.1 respectively). but length and weight did not differ (p = .60 and .12 respectively). 3.4 | overwintering the condition index and weight decreased after tagging (i.e. during migration), and this result became even stronger when overwintered eels were included (tables 5 and 6). in contrast, the eye index increased, but this was only significant when overwintered fish were excluded (table 4). in lake mälaren, 67 of the 125 recap- tured eels overwintered one or several seasons (table 2). the eye index did not change after tagging for lake mälaren eels (table 4). the weight loss was 11.5% on average, and the decrease was sjöberg et al.sjöberg et al.   | 527 figure 6 weight change of each eel between time of tagging and recapture in lake mälaren. there was no seasonal difference. eels were tagged first week of september 2008 figure 7 the tagging in väddö 2008 shows a weight decrease for each eel between time of tagging until recapture. eels were tagged 9 september to 10 september 2008 significantly correlated with time after tagging (fig. 6). one could expect overwintered eels to gain weight during summer and autumn. however, there was no seasonal difference between eels recaptured in spring compared with those caught later in the season (fig. 6; p = .27, n = 12 [springtime] and n = 35 [summer and autumn combined]). in addition, overwintering was substantial from the coastal tag- ging at väddö in 2008. ten of 33 recaptures were made the fol- lowing autumn, in 2009. these overwintered eels showed similar results as those in lake mälaren. they also lost weight (on aver- age 10.5%), and the weight loss increased significantly over time (fig. 7). in addition, the condition index was lower at time of tagging (ci- tag) for eels recaptured after long time (p < .05, slope = −2.10, t = −2.05, n = 33), indicating that eels with lower condition index from start were more prone to overwinter. the increasing eye size seemed to be triggered by the migration distance but ceased if the fish overwintered (table 4). consequently, the overwin- tered eels did not differ from not overwintering eels in terms of their eye size (p = .79, n = 9 [overwintering] and n = 24 [not overwintering]). the origin of the overwintered fish from lake mälaren was evenly distributed between the two groups viewed in fig. 2(a,d) (14 stocked 528 |  table 7 length versus time and

translocated/natural in 2010 (9–6) which was the last year of recapture. however, the overall distribution between years for overwintered eels was not significantly different (χ2- test, p = .34, n = 27), presumably as the number of eels/recaptures per year was low. among the 213 coastal recaptures, 8 of the 11 overwintered eels were analysed according to origin by otolith chemistry. six had grown up in brackish water (type as in fig. 2c), one had been stocked as an elver in freshwater (fig. 2b), and the last one stocked as a bootlace or is a natural immigrant to freshwater (fig. 2d). 4 |  discussion 4.1 | maturation process in the baltic sea, it is possible to follow the eel during a long time and for a long distance, as the fishery is situated all the way along the coastline. in turn, this allows researchers to study migration behaviour, routes taken and effects on physiological characteristics and possible changes during this first step of the journey back to the spawning grounds. this study shows how the development of the eel seems to be a continuous process and therefore also a response to the new environment, that is not only a preparation before leaving, which has been stated earlier (hain, 1975). on the coast, eye size increases while eels are actively migrating. it seems to be the migration as such which causes increased eye index, as when the overwintered eels are included in the analysis the increase is less or no longer significant (table 4, distance vs. ei- change and time vs. ei- change). in lake mälaren, eye size is unaffected (table 4). however, this is not consistent with earlier findings showing that eye diameter increases during migration only in freshwater (palstra & thillart, 2010). eye size was relatively large from the beginning in the lake (table 1), but these eels were also older (table 3) and age- dependent maturation has been suggested as a key factor for successful maturation (palstra & thillart, 2010). we can conclude that even if the eels in lake mälaren still continue some of their migrating activity (westerberg & sjöberg, 2015), these unsuccessful eels had stopped their silvering, and such findings also apply to the overwintered eels on the coast. the eye size index is used to distinguish between silver eels and stationary yellow eels (pankhurst, 1982). however, in this study, the eye size indices of eels from the lake and at the coast indicate that it might be difficult to separate eels based on this metric only. appar- ently, there was not any clear limit in size; there seems to be eels with relatively small eyes that still migrate with good speed towards the baltic outlet while others do not, even though they do have the exte- rior look of silver eels, and there is no correlation between eye index at tagging and migrated distance (table 4, ei- tag vs. distance). thus, eye as well as the condition index can only be used as proximate indicators of migrant behaviour. however, those should be preferred to colour shift or the development of neuromast (lateral line system), as those indicators are more subjective in nature. unfortunately, no measure- ments of pectoral fins were included in the dissection procedures at the time of the study, and durif indicators could not be calculated (durif, dufour, & elie, 2005). 4.2 | eel size and catchability our results indicate that smaller eels are recaptured after longer migrated distance (tables 6 and 7). the amount of explained vari- ance is low. this is, however, an interesting result if the fact that in the swedish fishery eels are smaller towards the outlet of the baltic sea is regarded. the explanation generally accepted is that larger and older eels are coming from north and waters with rela- tively low productivity, whereas the eels from the southern and more productive water are smaller. this is consistent with the result from the southernmost place (hanö in table 3). however, based on the correlation between length/weight and migrated dis- tance, it seems that the migration behaviour could be connected to size of the eel. are larger eels migrating closer to the shore? this explanation is comparable with the one that eels more infested by parasites were more easily caught (sjöberg, petersson, wickström, & hansson, 2009). however, there is no correlation between eel size and prevalence or infestation of the swimbladder nematode sjöberg et al.sjöberg et al.   | 529 anguillicola crassus. in addition, there is no indication that fisher- men release smaller eels for some reason, and furthermore, most eels are larger than the minimum according to the legislation and smaller eels maintain the same market value per kilogram. we suggest the explanation that the equipment used in the silver eel fishery, the large pound nets, are size- selective and more easily trap larger eels. 4.3 | origin the otolith chemistry data indicated that an overwhelming majority of the recaptured eels had inhabited brackish waters and that only 10% derived from freshwater. such a low contribution from freshwater areas has also been noted by tsukamoto, nakai, and tesch (1998), who concluded that eels are facultative catadromous. in addition, the low proportion of freshwater eels found in this study may mirror a situation with relatively low natural immigra- tion, enough habitats in estuaries and effective migration barriers to exclude eels from many heavily modified freshwater areas. earlier investigations show that the share of stocked eels in the out- let öresund strait are around 20–30% (clevestam & wickström, 2008; limburg, wickström, svedäng, elfman, & kristiansson, 2003), com- pared to 10% in this study. this difference could be partly explained by a general decrease in stocking activity, but also by how the stocked eels are distributed. when taking samples in the outlet straits, it is rea- sonable to believe that the major part derives from freshwater areas of poland and germany, as they stand for most of stocking in the baltic sea drainage area (westerberg & wickström, 2016). in theory, an eel with a sr/ca- history as in fig. 2(b) could not just have been stocked in freshwater, but instead a natural recruit from the swedish west coast ascending freshwater and stayed there until migrated back to the sea and further into the baltic sea. our inter- pretation follows clevestam and wickström (2008) which favours the former alternative as we now deal with eels from the baltic sea where stocking often occurred in adjacent freshwater. furthermore, there were no eels of this type among the yellow eels we have analysed from the swedish west coast (wickström unpublished), that is the only coast from where natural recruits of this kind could come. unfortunately, we cannot distinguish the fraction of eels stocked at the coast among the recaptures as they have a similar otolith microchemical signature as natural recruits (fig. 2c). however, coastal stocked eel seems to constitute a very small fraction of the coastal population (clevestam & wickström, 2008; national eel stocking database [kept at slu aqua]). in addition, we have not yet been able to decide with certainty if an eel of the bw & fw type (fig. 2d) is stocked as a medium- sized yellow eel from the marine swedish west coast or originates from a natural recruitment through a salinity gradient along the baltic coast. as the strontium content is not linearly correlated with salinity at low psu as in the baltic sea (limburg et al., 2003), we cannot easily differentiate between natural recruits in freshwater from stocked yellow eels of a more marine origin. an attempt to back calcu- late the size when entering freshwater directly from the sr/ca- curves as in fig. 2(d) resulted in estimated lengths that overlapped both the length of natural recruits in neighbouring rivers (wickström, 2002) and the normal size of stocked yellow eels (holmgren & wickström, 1988). neither did an analysis of age at the sudden dip in sr/ca solve the problem as also estimated ages overlapped with age of natural recruits and stocked yellow eels (ask, berntsson, & öhlund, 1971; holmgren & wickström, 1988). in the future, it will be possible to distinguish all stocked eels (coastal or freshwater) from natural immigrants because since 2009 all swedish and finnish elvers are chemically marked with strontium before release (wickström & sjöberg, 2014). a similar approach has also been taken in canada where large numbers of glass eels were marked with a fluorescent dye (oxytetracycline) before stocking (cf. verreault, dargere, & tardif, 2009; verreault, dumont, dussureault, & tardif, 2010). moreover, it is highly desirable to have all stocked eels marked in a similar way and with opportunity to distinguish also national origin, not just in the baltic but in all countries using the european eel for stocking purposes. this will be a good way to evaluate the stocking programmes and also to provide better knowledge for future eel management plans. 4.4 | overwintering westin (1998) showed that many stocked eels from gotland over- wintered, and a similar effect was indicated in our study. one explanation for such behaviour might be that eels delayed their migration and stayed another winter as a strategy to increase energy for the consuming journey (svedäng & wickström, 1997), but our study actually showed an opposite effect. even if a true starvation gives greater weight loss and the eels in lake mälaren seem to feed after waking up from dormancy (westerberg & sjöberg, 2015), this weight decrease is substantial and many of the eels were caught late in the following seasons, which should have enabled them to regain weight. in other words, they did not seem to recover body mass. the same results could be seen in 16 recaptured eels from a german tag experiment (prigge et al., 2013), which also found a decrease in body length. however, the length decrease in that study was most likely an effect of freezing shrinkage. however, our study did compensate for that and found no such connection (table 7). one obvious question is whether the difficulty to find the outlet from lake mälaren reflects the normal situation before 1960–1970s, when the stocking programmes started and the fishery became more intense (rundberg, 1968). there are indications that this is the case, as there has been no extensive eel fishery in or near the outlet of the lake, at least not in modern times because there is no data at all for hundreds of years. the fishery is instead located westerly from the release site and the recaptures in lake mälaren do quite well reflect the geograph- ical distribution of the large pound nets inside the lake (westerberg & sjöberg, 2015). furthermore, it seems to be a random autumn wander- ing, where eels are recaptured several kilometres in the wrong direc- tion than towards the exit, several years after release. on the other hand, higher condition increases chance to reach out of the lake (fig. 5), 530 |  which suggests that it is not a coincidence which eels eventually suc- ceed their spawning migration. consequently, eels with higher condi- tion index would be the ones most advanced in their metamorphosis (from physical aspect not covered in this study) and therefore have some sort of advantage in finding the exit. a possible interpretation is that eels in lake mälaren are not allowed to mature enough to really decide to leave because of the extensive fishing. instead the eel get caught, often several times, which may interfere with physical develop- ment and the ability to migrate, resulting in a decreased condition and a potential hindering of the metamorphic mechanism. an initial delay among migrating eels has also been identified and discussed earlier (crook et al., 2014; westerberg, sjöberg, lagenfelt, aarestrup, & righton, 2014). one complicating matter is that eel having spent all their lives at the coast—which means they most likely are of natural origin—also chose to overwinter (väddö in 2008). overwintering has previously been shown to increase with latitude of site of release (more frequent up north) and is 2.2% based on total amount of ear- lier taggings made in the baltic sea (sjöberg & petersson, 2005). the variable and lack of clear cut salinity gradients in the baltic, especially up north, may complicate the migration and result in overwintering, as salinity seems to be a factor for the positive rheotaxis of migration of silver eels (hain, 1975). in addition, the further from the baltic outlet the migration begins, the greater risk that the eels experience a multitude of disturbances hindering a continued migration. in our experiments, the handling procedure (fishing and tagging) is a distraction in itself. other anthropogenic stressors and obstacles such as electric cables, sound and light from bridges and wind mills, different discharges as cooling water or effluents from paper mills could all end up in undesirable over- wintering. consequently, these disturbances increase with migrated dis- tance, that is with latitude of release site, regardless of origin. the condition index seems to play a central role for eel migration behaviour. in lake mälaren, eels with higher condition had a higher probability of migrating (fig. 5) and eels from the northern release site väddö (who had a lower condition from start) more often chose to stay another winter with further decreased condition. altogether, higher condition seems to trigger or being a prerequisite for a more targeted migration without overwintering. 5 |  conclusions this study provides a deeper understanding concerning migration of stocked eels and shows that there are large concerns, in terms of the ability of eels to find their way out of a lake, as well as the conceivable delays of this migration. there is a risk associated with judging stocked eels potential migra- tion success based on just tagging result, because this method gives an artificial view of the migration behaviour, not telling the fact of unaffected eel migration behaviour. however, the majority of silver eel taggings in the baltic sea have resulted in recaptured eels in expected direction and with expected speed. in addition, a study on the swed- ish west coast gave substantial migratory behavioural information using data storage tags in spite of relatively rough handling procedures (westerberg et al., 2014). the same investigation still remains to be repeated with eels from the baltic sea, where eels of known origin are traced long distances, especially as large amounts of former stocked eels nowadays are trapped in lakes and transported around hydro- power plants and released on the east coast, without monitoring. it is obvious that eels from lake mälaren have huge problem find- ing the outlet. once they find their way out they have lost a lot of weight. therefore, it seems to be an unsafe choice to use lake mälaren for stocking purposes. future studies will tell whether it is feasible to use trap and transport to bypass the problem or whether the eel at reduced fishing pressure may have the chance to increase their condi- tion and migrate out by themselves. perhaps the weight decrease may not be associated with a migration failure but instead be a result of the maturation process where, for example, muscle is converted into fat. the exact relationship between condition indices and body composi- tion of eels should also be further investigated. the proportion of natural to stocked eel is unknown, and the need to answer the question is becoming outdated as the translocation of west coast eel has stopped (and time will tell). in the present situation, where the focus is to support the eel stock rather than fishery, the advice and conclusion is that west coast eels have a better opportu- nity to increase the eel population by determining their growing areas themselves. if stocking imported elvers, it seems preferably to stock them at the west coast where they have the opportunity to migrate to the baltic sea if needed.
