e-mail: mehner@igb-berlin.de accepted for publication december 14, 2005 introduction diel vertical migration (dvm) is a widespread behavioural pattern among many aquatic biological taxa. in most cases, the organisms stay in deep and dark environments during the day, ascend into higher water layers during the night, and descend back to the dark layers during dawn. these migrations have been described in marine (huse & korneliussen 2000; gauthier & rose 2002; nichol & somerton 2002) and freshwater ﬁshes (rudstam & magnuson 1985; hamrin 1986; luecke & wurtsbaugh 1993; scheuerell & schindler 2003), euphausiids (de robertis et al. 2003) and marine and freshwater mesozooplankton (bollens & frost 1989; lampert 1989; ringelberg 1991; winder et al. 2003). the evolutionary devel- oped adaptational value of the migrations is seen in the resulting trade-off between safety against visually feeding predators in the deep and dark environments during daytime, and the higher food availability or 146 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00137.x higher temperatures in upper water layers which may be used under reduced predation risk during the night (sekino & yamamura 1999; scheuerell & schindler 2003, reviewed by hays 2003). whereas these migration patterns and their prox- imate and ultimate reasons have been described and analysed in detail for populations, less is known with respect to individual variability of diel habitat shifts. in general, the ultimate reasons for a population beha- viour can be more reliably explained if size differences between individuals are taken into account (persson & de roos 2003). according to evolutionary theory, those individuals with the highest predation risk and/or lowest daily energy requirements should start later than the others with the migration into the more risky habitat at dusk (sekino & yamamura 1999; hays 2003). whereas in herbivorous zooplankton the largest animals are faced with the highest predation risk, this situation is reversed in ﬁsh where often the smallest developmental stages have to cope with the broadest range of potential predators (sogard 1997). therefore, it is to be expected that in ﬁsh populations, juvenile stages start later with the dusk ascent, and start earlier with the dawn descent, than adult ﬁshes. this hypothesis is easily testable if any appropriate method to track individual ﬁsh behaviour can be developed. vertical (hamrin echo-sounding among freshwater ﬁshes, dvms have been fre- quently reported in cisco (vendace coregonus_albula, lake cisco c. artedii) populations. ciscoes are small- sized pelagic planktivores inhabiting low-productive deep lakes in north america or north to central europe. the differing habitat choice of vendace between day and night has often been studied using mobile 1986; syda¨noja et al. 1995; kahilainen et al. 2004). although echo-sounding as a tool to study ﬁsh ecology and behaviour is highly developed (maclennan & simmonds 1992), there is one general problem when studying vertically migrating ﬁsh by hydroacoustics. as hydrostatic pressure declines when ﬁsh ascend, the swimbladder of physostomous ﬁsh consequently inﬂates (alexander 1966) thus increasing its acoustical cross section. as a result, earlier studies found the population average target strength (ts) to become greater while ﬁsh ascend, but to decline when ﬁsh descend (eckmann 1991; fleischer & tewinkel 1998). in contrast, knudsen & gjelland (2004) have recently shown that whiteﬁsh (coregonus_lavaretus) and vendace release gas bubbles during upward migration thus preventing a too high gas pressure in the swimbladder. consequently, these authors did not observe an increase in ts with decreasing water depth. potential variations in acoustic sizes during vertical migrations could be more precisely documented if migration patterns of individual ﬁsh could be studied. however, tracks long enough to observe speciﬁc diel vertical migration in vendace the surface or at features of upward or downward swimming of indi- vidual ﬁsh cannot be derived from echograms obtained with a moving echosounder at the water surface. instead, vertical echo-sounding may record substantial individual ﬁsh tracks only if the echosounder is ﬁxed near the bottom. this general approach of stationary hydroacoustics is common in ﬁsh behavioural studies, but has almost exclusively been applied in a horizontal orientation during studies of ﬁsh migrations in rivers (kubecka & duncan 1998; peirson & frear 2003) or lakes (arrhenius et al. 2000; romare 2001). in contrast, there is no study where dvms of freshwater ﬁsh have been explored by stationary hydroacoustics see torgersen & kaartvedt 2001; axenrot et al. 2004 for studies on marine ﬁsh). (but is vertical echo-sounding, here, individual variability of vertical migrations of vendace in lake stechlin (germany), obtained by stationary presented. according to previous studies, the diel rhythms of habitat choice of the vendace population in lake stechlin are clearly expressed with maximum migra- tion activities at dusk and dawn (mehner et al. 1999). however, a detailed individual-based picture of the temporal course of the migrations has not been previously achieved. therefore, the aims of this study were: (i) to describe vertical migrations of vendace with respect to individual differences in swimming speeds or swimming distances, (ii) to correlate the individual variability in swimming with the temporal course of the migrations or with the size of the ﬁshes to ﬁnd explanations for the speciﬁc behavioural patterns, (iii) to explore whether the distance or speed of the vertical migrations had an impact on the acoustic size of ﬁsh, and thus (iv) to evaluate whether stationary vertical echo-sounding is an appropriate method to study individual ﬁsh behaviour. material and methods diel vertical migrations were studied in the deep (69 m) oligotrophic lake stechlin, situated approxi- mately 100 km north of berlin (germany). the hypolimnetic ﬁsh community is dominated to almost 100% by two cisco species, namely the european vendace coregonus_albula and the fontane cisco c. fontanae (mehner & schulz 2002; schulz & freyhof 2003), for which initial studies suggest that only the numerically clearly dominating european vendace performs a dvm (schulz et al. 2003). the annual average population density of vendace was )1 (mehner & schulz estimated with 5038 ind. ha 2002). other frequently occurring species are roach (rutilus rutilus), bleak (alburnus alburnus) and perch (perca ﬂuviatilis), all of which mainly inhabit the upper pelagic and littoral areas (anwand et al. 2003). 147 mehner records by stationary vertical hydroacoustics were performed at dusk and dawn on 18 and 19 march and on 17 and 18 may 2004. these days were extremely calm and there was almost no wind at the lake’s surface. a boat was anchored at three points at a location near the deepest point of the lake (exact position 53°09.356¢n,13°01.889¢e). a simrad ey 60 echo-sounder with a 120 khz 7° · 7° circular transducer was used. transducer settings were 0.128 s pulse duration, vertical resolution 2.3 cm, receiver bandwidth 10.92 khz, 300 w power, 0.3 s ping interval and noise estimates constantly lower than )135 db. transducer depth was 0.4 m, and all data presented are true depths and not ranges from the transducer. all raw data were continuously stored on a notebook computer with maximum ﬁle sizes limited to 10 mb. this limitation was used to facilitate the subsequent evaluation of the recordings by the simple tracking algorithm included in the sonar 4 software (balk & lindem 2004). evaluation was restricted to ﬁles which were recorded between about 30–60 min after sunset at dusk, and 60–30 min before sunrise at dawn (table 1). raw data were converted by the 40 log time varied gain equation with a volumetric backscattering (sv) threshold at )70 db and a single ts threshold at )68 db. only single echoes were used in the tracking by applying detection thresholds of 0.7–1.3 echo lengths, a maximum gain compensation of 5 db and a maximum phase standard deviation of 0.8°. the area covered by the hydroacoustic beam was about 0.15 m2 at 3 m depth and almost 64 m2 in 60 m depth. the minimum ping number to build a track was set to 10. as the simple tracking algorithm required a manual tracks which could track identiﬁcation, all table 1. overview on the main features of the four stationary hydroacoustic samplings on lake stechlin in march and may 2004. dusk march 18 dawn march 19 dusk may 17 dawn may 18 +31 +68 253 84.5 12.0 219.6 )44.1 )59.2 )37.4 27.6 7.4 60.4 )60 )29 201 71.8 8.1 218.4 )46.2 )59.8 )38.9 31.4 6.4 61.1 +35 +68 )66 )29 164 191 52.6 5.6 91.5 )46.8 )64.4 )41.1 37.8 13.6 60.3 46.3 3.3 95.8 )45.6 )65.5 )35.7 34.7 5.4 61.1 date start [minutes after sunset (+) or before sunrise ())] end [minutes after sunset (+) or before sunrise ())] number of tracks track duration (s) average minimum maximum target strength (db) average minimum maximum depth of tracks (m) average minimum maximum 148 easily be differentiated from other single echoes nearby were included. track identiﬁcation was aided by visually inspecting the position of the single echoes in the three-dimensional space, ultimately combining only those neighbouring echoes whose positions or ts did not deviate substantially from each other. the tracking algorithm calculates several features related to time, position, distance, echo strength and velocity of the manually selected tracks. these features were recorded for each track within the four sampling periods (dusk and dawn in march and may), from which minimum, maximum and average were subse- quently calculated for each period. correlations between track features were calculated using the spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient rs. results the ﬁles recorded by stationary vertical echo-sound- ings contained between 164 and 253 manually selec- ted tracks during each of the four periods studied, each with a temporal duration of between 3.3 and 219.6 s (table 1). the average duration was slightly longer in march (71.8 or 84.5 s) than in may (46.3 or 52.6 s, table 1). the mean ts (gain compensated values in db; average calculated in the linear domain) of the recorded echoes ranged from )65.5 to )35.7 db reﬂecting ﬁsh sizes from about 1 to 30 cm total length (table 1) according to the standard ts–length rela- tionship for 120 khz transducers (love 1971). combined: the average depths of tracks varied between 5 and 61 m (table 1). there was a slightly signiﬁcant decline in mean depth of the tracks with time, calculated in seconds after start of the recordings during dusk (march rs ¼ )0.105, n ¼ 417, and may p ¼ 0.033, fig. 1a), whereas this relationship was not signiﬁcant at dawn (march and may combined, rs ¼ 0.03, n ¼ 396, p ¼ 0.55, fig. 1b). the mean absolute speeds of depth change of the individual ﬁsh between all echoes in a track along the depth axis were very low in march with less than 5% of the ﬁsh migrating )1 (fig. 2a,b). the population aver- faster than 1 cm s age of vertical swimming speeds for the 30 min of observation was thus close to zero at dusk )1).

behavioural studies, in particular if individual variability of vertical ﬁsh migrations needs to be explored. fish abundance may practically limit the application, however, as too few ﬁsh do not allow to record sufﬁcient tracks (i.j. winﬁeld, personal com- munication), whereas a too high density with little vertical distance may prevent unequivocal track separation. when a calm location can be found on a lake where water depth and hence area of the transducer beam are relatively large, the behaviour of individual ﬁshes can be recorded over long time periods. for example, the longest track recorded in lake stechlin covered more than 3 min or 732 pings in total. it appears possible that this duration can be further expanded if the maximum ﬁle size during recording is increased beyond the 10 mb used here. longer ﬁles with more tracks can easily be handled with the automatic track identiﬁcation routines inclu- ded in the more advanced software version sonar5-pro (balk & lindem 2004) which was not available for this study. this would allow the individual differences in swimming speeds and vertical distances to be better correlated with ﬁsh size or time of the day than was achieved in the recordings presented here. 149 mehner fig. 3. part of hydroacoustic recordings during dusk in march 2004 (time period about 2 min, water depth 35–38 m) showing ﬁve different tracks with

samplings in march and may 2004. details of correlation statistics are given in the text. the individual variability in vertical swimming speeds was very high. it was found that only a maximum of 20% of the vendace population actively migrated within the limited duration of each of the single recordings of 2–4 min length. all other ﬁsh did not change their vertical position, but stayed more or less constantly in the same water depth. this stationary behaviour is not an artefact of a too short duration of the recordings as the average track length per sampling period was in the range of 45–85 s. instead, the data suggest that migrations are not an uniform population- wide feature, but reﬂect a strong individuality in the temporal course. in addition, there were always a few single ﬁsh which even migrated in the opposite direction compared with the other active ﬁsh, such that the total net movement of the ﬁsh populations is a complex sum of non-moving and upwards and down- wards swimming ﬁsh. the net movement velocity was almost zero during dusk in march. there is no obvious explanation why so few ﬁsh were observed migrating during this period, as the overall migration amplitudes of the vendace population are relatively stable over the seasons according to mobile hydroacoustic surveys performed in 2002 (compare mehner et al. 2005). it appears possible that the low proportion of migrating ﬁsh reﬂects a biased picture of the population behaviour. the chance that ﬁsh which move upwards leave the acoustical beam due to accompanying horizontal migrations is likely much higher than for ﬁsh that remain in constant depth. future comparative quasi-simultaneous stationary and mobile recordings have to demonstrate whether stationary tracks indeed reﬂect the same population migration pattern as can be found from mobile echo-sounding. furthermore, a few tracks at constant depths may have come also from the non-migrating fontane cisco whose population density is assumed to be substantially smaller than that of the vendace. the vertical migration speeds were several times higher during dawn than during dusk in march, and )1 in both directions in may. reached about 0.35 cm s if this speed is extrapolated to the average vertical distance which the vendace population in the deep areas of lake stechlin has to cover (from 45 to 25 m on average; t. mehner, unpublished results), about 5700 s or 1.5 h are required for the entire vendace population to reach the respective other habitat. this estimate is in good correspondence with other obser- vations that the upward migrations are completed about 1–1.5 hours after sunset (mehner et al. 1999). scheuerell & schindler (2003) calculated that juvenile sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka) covered ver- tical distances of 60 m within 3–4 h, a ﬁgure which corresponds with the vertical swimming speeds found here. furthermore, ﬁsh activity declined with increas- ing time from sunset or declining time to sunrise thus underlining the fact the individual migration activity is most pronounced between sunset plus 1 h, or 1 h before sunrise until sunrise. according to previous studies, the change in illumination strength in the water column is the proximate reason to induce dvms both in ﬁsh and zooplankton (hamrin 1986; hays 2003). this supports the conclusion that migra- tion activity peaks during dusk and dawn. that according to theory, intra-population differences in size, age, hunger or reproductive phase should have an impact on how individuals balance the different predation risk and food availability in two alternative habitats (krause et al. 1998; ho¨lker et al. 2002; candolin & voigt 2003; persson & de roos 2003). however, a clear correspondence between ﬁsh size and onset or duration of activity in response to the time after sunset or before sunrise could not be found in the records of this study. only during dusk on 17 may was there a weak tendency for the average size of the actively swimming ﬁsh to decline with temporal distance to the previous sunset. as a consequence of the migrations, however, the access to abundant zooplankton resources is extremely limited for vendace. the great majority of the zooplankton in lake stechlin concentrates in depths between the surface and 25 m and migrates with amplitudes of only a few meters on a diel scale (kasprzak & schwabe 1987). therefore, vendace always have to ascend into the upper hypolimnion to start efﬁcient zooplankton feeding. in mid-may, the time between sunset and sunrise is approximately 8 h, and declines further to about 6.5 h in mid-june. if the estimated migration duration of 1.5 h in each direction (see above) is included, not more than 4–5 h remain for feeding in the zooplankton-rich water layers during diel vertical migration in vendace the ﬁsh. therefore, late spring and early summer. simultaneously, the higher water temperatures close to the thermocline in summer also result in higher daily basal energy requirements for it may be speculated that the overall energy budget for the vendace is so tight during spring and summer that any size-dependent differences in migration patterns are less clearly expressed in favour of the population-wide temporal maximisation of energy uptake in the zooplankton-rich water layers during the short dark- ness phases. laboratory-based behavioural studies in sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus) clearly demon- strated that hungry ﬁshes took a higher predation risk than satiated ones (milinski & heller 1978; krause et al. 1998). therefore, is possible that hungry juvenile vendace prolong their stay in the risky upper water layers to cope with the increasing energy demands during the summer. furthermore, as the relative food availabilities and predation risks in the upper and lower hypolimnetic area of lake stechlin vary during the season, a strong month-to-month difference in migration patterns of vendace can be expected (see for example the seasonal variability of dvm in sockeye salmon, o. nerka; scheuerell & schindler 2003). indeed, the migration activity of vendace weakly differed between the march and may recordings. however, whether a correspondence exists between habitat-speciﬁc mortality risks and zooplank- ton densities on the one hand, and amplitude, activity peaks and vertical swimming velocities of vendace on the other, needs to be explored in further studies. it fishes which swam the longest vertical distances also showed the highest variability of their individual ts values within a track, which could be interpreted as a conﬁrmation of the impact of changing hydrostatic pressure during vertical migrations on the acoustic size of ﬁsh (eckmann 1991). accordingly, one has to expect that the population-wide estimates of ﬁsh size should become virtually larger at dusk, and smaller at dawn. however, the average ts of all tracks was not time dependent such that increasing acoustic sizes during upward migrations and declining acoustic sizes during downward migrations could be observed only in individual ﬁsh for short periods. furthermore, by the examination of individual tracks, it was apparent that very few ﬁsh covered vertical distances of more than 2 m within 1 or 2 min. most often, ﬁsh migrated a few cm up to half a metre within short time intervals, and then remained at that depth for some further period. it is possible that this time is required to adapt the internal gas pressure in the swimbladder to the external hydro- static pressure, for example by releasing gas bubbles (knudsen & gjelland 2004). only after such pressures are balanced does the ﬁsh start to the next step of vertical migration. although this interpretation of the observed behaviour remains in part speculative, there were a few 151 mehner tracks which serve as evidence for a saltatory move- ment. furthermore, the majority of ﬁsh had vertical swimming speeds around zero, which supports the interpretation that vertical migration is not a continuous event, but a saltatory behaviour where upward or downward swimming is frequently interrupted by longer phases of constant depth. a similar saltatory swimming mode was documented in stationary tracks of vertical migrations of the marine mesopelagic mu¨ller’s pearlside (maurolicus muelleri; torgersen & kaartvedt 2001). consequently, the changes in acoustic sizes of individual ﬁsh during dvm have no impact on the accuracy of size frequency estimates for the population when nightly hydroacoustic recordings late enough, preferably at least 1.5 h after sunset when dvm is almost completed. start this conclusion is not necessarily a full contradic- tion to the observations that coregonids can compen- sate their swimbladder volume only to a limited extent (eckmann 1991; fleischer & tewinkel 1998). instead, the degree of volume compensation may be dependent on amplitude and velocity of the migrations such that differences have to be expected between lakes of varying depth, productivity and transparency. for example, ﬁsh migrations in both lake constance (eckmann 1991) and lake michigan (fleischer et al. 1997; fleischer & tewinkel 1998) have potentially to cover more than 100 m due to the greater maximum depths in those lakes when compared with the 25 m migration amplitudes found in lake stechlin. accord- ing to the results presented here, stationary vertical echo-sounding may be of great help in elucidating the interdependencies between individual variability in dvm of ﬁsh and features related to lake morphology or productivity. acknowledgements i would like to thank christian helms for technical support during the surveys. many thanks also to helge balk and reiner eckmann
