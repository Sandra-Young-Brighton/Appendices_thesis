(1992) and kay et al. (1994). in some areas within its range, the greater redhorse is considered rare, but it is a major com- ponent of the fish assemblage in the grand river, ontario, canada. to help clarify the ecological role of this species in riverine systems, home ranges and habitats used during various life history phases should be described. the purpose of this study was to determine movement patterns and habitat types used by male and female greater redhorse after spawning. material and methods greater redhorse were collected, radio-tagged, tracked and observed between the mannheim weir (kitchener), and parkhill dam (cambridge), in the grand river, ontario, canada. in the area where this study was conducted, the river is mid-sized with typical summer widths between 20 and 40 m, relatively shallow (mean depth <1 m) and has riffle-pool-run sequences. details of the study site downstream from the mannheim weir are in bunt et al. (1998), and riffles used by spawning greater redhorse in 1997 are described in cooke & bunt (1999). we used a combination of seines and gill nets to corral adult greater redhorse 800 m downstream from the mannheim weir on may 30 and 31, 1997. handling was minimized, and all fish were held in a mesh pen in the river for no more than 15 min 57 bunt & cooke before they were examined, measured and radio- tagged. fifteen greater redhorse were externally tagged with small radio transmitters (dimensions: 29 x 10 mm x 7 mm, weight in air: 3.7 g, battery life: ca. 50 days, model mbft-2, lotek inc.), each of which broadcast a unique frequency. transmitters were attached through the dorsal musculature on the right side of each fish as follows. the head and eyes were covered with a wet cloth to retain moist- ure, exclude light and instill a calming effect. a few scales were removed approximately 2 cm ventral to the dorsal fin. removal of scales permitted the insertion of two 6-cm-long, 20-g hypodermic needles on fused syringes, through the dorsal musculature. transmitter attachment wires (surgi- cal stainless steel) were then passed through the needles to the opposite side of the body. neoprene coated plastic strips were used as a back-plate over which the attachment wires were twisted together several times. the tagging procedure required ap- proximately 1 min. males (mean length= 565.6k6.2 mm total length (tl), n=8, table 1) and females (mean length=601.1?7.8 mm tl, n= 7, table i) were tagged and released at the capture site within 1 h of collection. daytime positions of greater redhorse were de- termined to within 3 m by triangulation using shore-based landmarks. to document movements, the reach between the mannheim weir and parkhill dam - approximately 17 river km - was scanned for valid transmitter signals every 3 or 4 d by in- flatable boat from june 2 to july 20. to collect habitat data, crews with polarized glasses observed and recorded substrate, water velocity, cover and habitat types from the positions of tagged and un- table 1. codes, genders, lengths and weights of greater redhorse used in this study. the tagging date and the number of days each fish was tracked is indicated. code sex total length (mm) weight (9) m f m m m f f m m f f f m f m 595 585 548 579 561 601 646 542 575 598 592 588 555 598 570 2680 2425 1975 2525 2325 2750 4000 1825 2050 2260 261 0 2150 2090 2700 2275 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 58 tagging date 30-may 30-may 30-may 30-may 30-may 30-may 31 -may 31-may 31-may 31 -may 31 -may 31 -may 31 -may 31-may 31-may days tracked 51 34 62 45 34 34 44 44 44 44 33 33 44 33 44 tagged greater redhorse throughout the study reach during each tracking episode. habitat data were collected until late july, and patterns of gen- eral activity and abundance of greater redhorse within the study reach were documented until late october. when greater redhorse were located, depth at each fish position was measured with a graduated wading pole (to within 1 cm). surface water velo- city was recorded to the nearest 5 cm/s using an ultrasonic doppler-shift velocity meter (sigma inc.). substrate was classified according to a modi- fied wentworth scale (cummins 1962), and veg- etation and cover were evaluated by type and abundance. habitats were identified and classified as run, riffle or pool. critical values for all statisti- cal tests were evaluated at a=0.05, and all means are reported tl s.e. results and discussion greater redhorse spawning usually ends by the first week of june in the grand river (cooke & bunt 1999), earlier than other larger and cooler rivers (i.e., jenkins & jenkins 1980; mongeau et al. 1992). as reported for greater redhorse congeners (kwak & skelly 1992), a major rain event or noon water temperatures above approximately 15 "c usually terminates spawning for the season in the grand river (cooke & bunt 1999). radio-tagged greater redhorse were tracked for 33-62 d. we located radio-tagged fish on 113 oc- casions and each fish was pinpointed 7.5-+0.4 times (range 4-10). by the second week of june, no greater redhorse were located in areas where spawning occurred. mean downstream movement 2.00 1 0.00 8 8.00 s 10.00 1 12.00 u u) 16.00 i4.o0 32 30 i f 35 10-may 30-may 19-jun 9-jul 1 i 29-jul date fig. 1. areas of the grand river used by radio-tagged greater redhorse after spawning (n=15). the position of the mannheim weir is at 0 km on the ordinate axis. numbers represent individ- ual fish as reported in table 1. among males was 5.4k0.9 river km (range 2.4-8.6 km). females used 7.02 1.9 km of the river (range 2.1-15.2 km). female greater redhorse used in this study were significantly larger than males (mann- whitney u-test, u=53, p=0.004), but the differ- ence in net movement between males and females was not significant (u=31, p=0.728). there was also no significant correlation between total length and net movement for either sex (pearson corre- lation analysis, males: r=0.33, p=0.425, females: r= -0.17, p=0.721). although considerable vari- ation occurred in the movement patterns of one female and one male (fish #35 and fish #42, fig. l), most fish tended to remain in the same area of the river (ica. 1 km) after the first two weeks of june. by mid-june, radio-tagged fish were uni- formly distributed throughout the study reach (fig. 1). on three occasions, radio-tagged greater redhorse were visually observed among groups of untagged individuals, suggesting that the behav- iour of radio-tagged and untagged fish was similar. the mean water depth at the exact location where greater redhorse were located was 46.3 20.9 cm (n=245). the mean water depth in riffles where greater redhorse spawned earlier in the same year was 34.421 cm and the mean surface water velo- city was 3822 cm/s (cooke & bunt 1999). post- spawn habitat was deeper and water velocities were reduced compared to spawning areas. all greater redhorse observations but one (n = 245), were in water with surface velocities <5 cmls (log-likeli- hood ratio test, g=326.7, p<o.ool). most fish were located over cobble/gravel (42% of obser- vations, g=377.8, p<o.ool) fully covered with cladophora (38% of observations) followed by scattered cladophora (50% coverage, 15% of obser- vations) and sparse cladophora (20% coverage, 13% of observations, g=528.6, p<o.ool). runs, specifically the margins of runs, were the most fre- quently used habitat type (78.8%), followed by riffles (20%) (g=407.1, p<o.ool). pools were used infrequently (1.2%). untagged greater redhorse were observed in groups of up to 12 individuals on 153 occasions. during 3.9% of total observations with multiple fish, greater redhorse were observed to associate with golden redhorse m. erythrurum. in addition, northern hog sucker, hypentelium nigricans, com- mon carp, cyprinus carpio, and smallmouth bass, micropterus dolomieu were associated with greater redhorse for 1.3%, 2.6% and 3.9%, respectively, of total observations with multiple fish. similar to our findings, mongeau et al. (1992) reported that greater redhorse formed associations with common carp and smallmouth bass. when greater redhorse associated with conspecifics in the grand river, the mean aggregation size was 1.6+0.1 individuals. greater redhorse movements and habitat it has been suggested that greater redhorse in- habit large, clear-water streams with sand, gravel and boulders throughout the year, and that they are particularly sensitive to siltation (trautman 198 1; yoder & beaumier 1986). other congeners are sensi- tive to silt (e.g., river redhorse, m. carinatum, jenk- ins 1970; black redhorse, m. duquesnei, parker 1989), and this likely affects their distribution and abundance. similar to our observations, yoder & beaumier (1986) noted that greater redhorse were collected by electrofishing most commonly in riffle- run habitats with boulder, cobble and gravel sub- strates. over 99% of our greater redhorse locations were in slow current. although the substrate con- sisted mostly of cobble/gravel, silt was present within interstitial spaces. we observed greater redhorse creating silt plumes while they fed. radio transmitter batteries expired by late july, but greater redhorse were visually located and ap- peared to use similar habitat until approximately the second week in september. crews continued to monitor the study reach for greater redhorse activ- ity from late september to late october, but no fish were observed. thus, there appeared to be no change in greater redhorse behavior or habitat until overwintering movements occurred in early au- tumn. resumen 1. radio-telemetria y observaciones de superficie fueron utiliza- dos en el rio grand (ontario, canada) para caracterizar 10s movimientos y el habitat de moxostoma valenciennesi, despues de la puesta. este rio mantiene una poblacion considerable de m. valenciennesi que migra rio arriba en primavera para repro- ducirse en zonas de chorreras. 2. despues de la puesta m. valenciennesi se mueve aguas abajo 15.2 km desde las zonas de freza donde mantienen “home ranges” veraniegos en tablas de baja velocidad. la profundidad media del agua fue de 46.350.9 cm y la velocidad media menor de 5 cm . seg-’. generalmente, 10s individuos de m. valencien- nesi fueron localizados sobre sustratos de grava y piedra cubier- tos de cladophora. aunque observamos asociaciones interespe- cificas con m. erythrurum, cyprinus carpio, micropterus dolo- mieu, y hypentelium nigricans, la mayor parte de 10s individuos de m. valenciennesi fueron observados asociados con indivi- duos de su misma especie. las areas y 10s tipos de habitat utili- zados a lo largo del verano no cambiaron hasta que a1 inicio del otoiio se produjo una recolocacion de areas para el invierno. acknowledgements we thank brett van poorten and lin wong for field assistance and the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for postgraduate scholarships to c.m.b. and s.j.c. biotactic inc. provided technical support. references bunt, c.m., cooke, s.j & mckinley, r.s. 1998. creation and maintenance of habitat downstream from a weir for the 59 kwak, t.j. & skelly, t.m. 1992. spawning habitat, behavior, and morphology as isolating mechanisms of the golden redhorse, moxostomu erythrurum, and the black redhorse, m duquesnei, two syntopic fishes. environmental biology of fishes 34: 127-137. mongeau, j.r., dumont, i?
