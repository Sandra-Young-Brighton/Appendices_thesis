diehl 1995; schriver et al. 1995). as foraging 150 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00086.x interactions between juveniles and their invertebrate prey success of predators decreases with increasing struc- tural complexity, prey survival is normally highest in the densest structures (winﬁeld 1986). survival of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate prey in complex structures may be reduced, however, if their principal predators, juvenile ﬁsh, are simultaneously forced to seek refuge from piscivorous predators (diehl & eklo¨v 1995; persson & eklo¨v 1995; jacobsen et al. 1997). outcome of interactions may then be highly complex and diurnally structured, and depends on habitat complexity, densities of predators and prey, and feeding modes and efﬁciencies of the predators (jeppesen et al. 1998). interaction patterns in complex structures have frequently been tested in habitats covered with submerged macrophytes (johansson 1987; venugopal & winﬁeld 1993; diehl & eklo¨v 1995; schriver et al. 1995). less information is available for littoral reed (phragmites spp.) stands where the interaction patterns may differ from those in macrophyte beds because of the potentially lower complexity offered by the reed. in a previous ﬁeld study in the littoral zone of the shallow eutrophic lake mu¨ggelsee, okun & mehner (2005) found biomasses of both juvenile roach [rutilus rutilus (l.)] and perch (perca ﬂuviatilis l.) to be higher in reed stands compared with the adjacent open water area. the numerical dominance of roach in the reed and their preferred occurrence in the complex littoral structure did not reﬂect the reduced species- speciﬁc foraging efﬁciencies of roach for invertebrate prey in structured habitats, which had been shown to be lower than for perch (winﬁeld 1986; diehl 1988; persson & eklo¨v 1995). thus, the dominance of roach in the reed was probably not triggered by a higher feeding efﬁciency in the structured habitat, but alter- natively reﬂects strong predator avoidance of all juvenile ﬁsh. a strong support for the refuge function of reed came from the distribution of ﬁsh over the diel cycle. the daytime preference of reed stands by both roach and perch, which was partly upset by roach at night, may have been caused by the presence of visually hunting littoral piscivores (ﬁsh and birds). finally, growth rates of juvenile roach were only slightly depressed indicating that roach may have balanced the reduced foraging efﬁciencies in the reed. okun & mehner (2005) presented four hypotheses how the roach might cope with the forced stay in a suboptimal feeding habitat. (1) the lower degree of structural complexity of reed stands when compared with submerged macrophytes might allow sufﬁcient foraging success for all species. (2) the biomass of zooplankton which was the preferred food of roach is high enough even in the reed stands thus allowing for sufﬁcient energy intake. (3) diel horizontal migrations of roach between the reed and the open water zone may allow roach to take proﬁt of the relatively higher zooplankton availability in the open water zone at night. (4) the survival of roach is higher than that of perch, mainly attributed to more effective anti-predator strategies (e.g. shoaling) at low habitat complexity. the aim of this study was to test experimentally three of the hypotheses mentioned above to explain the observed feeding and distribution patterns of juvenile ﬁsh in the littoral area of mu¨ggelsee. therefore, we separately analysed the predator–prey interactions in both reed and open water enclosures using one species having a high (perch) and the other a low (roach) capacity to forage in the complex reed habitat. by preventing diel horizontal migrations of ﬁsh, we expected to see a substantially reduced performance of roach in the reed enclosures when compared with both roach in the open water enclo- sures and perch in the reed enclosures (hypothesis 3). in contrast, if growth rates of roach and perch are not inﬂuenced by the habitat treatment, the lower com- plexity of reed stands (hypothesis 1) and the generally high resource availability in the reed (hypothesis 2) may alternatively explain why roach and perch can successfully coexist in the reed stands of mu¨ggelsee. material and methods experimental design the experiment was conducted during may and june 2001 in the shallow eutrophic lake mu¨ggelsee situated in the south-east of berlin, germany. for more details of the lake and its ﬁsh community, see okun & mehner (2005). a total of 22 enclosures (each 1.8 · 1.8 m) was placed along the western shore of the lake at a water depth of 60–80 cm on 18/19 may 2001. eleven enclosures were situated within dense reed stands, whereas 11 others were placed into the vegetation-free open water zone in front of the reed (distance to the reed 4 m). the bottom consisted of ﬁrm sand, covered by 5–10 cm of mud within the reed stands. the enclosures were made of nylon reinforced plastic walls, attached to iron frames. the lower end of the quadratic iron frame was spade-like and pushed about 15 cm into the sediment. the upper end of the frame projected 30 cm above the water surface to prevent ﬁsh loss by jumps out of the enclosures, as well as wave overrun. in addition, the enclosures were covered with nets to prevent predation by ﬁsh-feeding birds. after having placed the frames into the bottom, the walls were gently lifted thus enclosing the respective water volume with the littoral zooplankton included. fish which retained in the enclosures were removed by electroﬁshing. we randomly assigned enclosures to six different treatments (reed two habitat treatments: 151 okun & mehner present or absent) combined with three ﬁsh treatments (no ﬁsh, four age-1 roach, four age-1 perch). all ﬁsh treatments were replicated four times per vegetation site, whereas no-ﬁsh treatments were replicated three times. fish were collected in the littoral of mu¨ggelsee with a lift net and by electroﬁshing. after measuring total length and wet mass, ﬁsh were stocked into the enclosures on 21 may. to allow an individual recognition during the experiment, individual ﬁsh least 4 mm in each of the lengths differed by at enclosures. therefore, roach total length (tl) ranged from 68 to 90 mm (mean 75 mm), with wet mass (w.m.) ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 g (mean 4.4 g, areal )2). in perch treatments, ﬁsh tl biomass 1.23 gæm ranged from 65 to 88 mm (mean 75 mm) and w.m. from 3.0 to 9.0 g (mean 5.0 g, areal biomass )2). densities and biomasses of age-1 roach 1.30 gæm and perch in the enclosures approximately correspon- ded to natural densities found in the littoral area of mu¨ggelsee during summer (see okun & mehner, 2005). furthermore, zooplankton and benthos bio- masses, which were present in the enclosures at the start of the experiments, closely matched the natural biomasses in the littoral of mu¨ggelsee. sampling and laboratory analyses the total experiment was run from 21 may to 10 june 2001. there were several reasons to conﬁne the experiment to a relatively short period. at ﬁrst, as enclosures had to be situated at the highly wind- exposed and populated littoral zone of mu¨ggelsee, short-term duration was aimed to prevent potential mechanical damage and malicious destruction. sec- ondly, as monthly variability of juvenile ﬁsh biomass in the littoral zone of the lake is high, a short-term experiment with constant ﬁsh biomass rather mirrors the natural situation. thirdly, the aim of the experi- ment was to detect immediate impacts of ﬁsh feeding on their resources. if experimental duration is longer than 4 weeks, indirect effects mediated by growth of wall vegetation or demographic responses in the prey populations may mask the strength of the feeding impact by the ﬁsh. water temperature and oxygen content in the enclosures were measured every second day. fish mortality was also checked every second day by counting dead ﬁsh at the water surface (altogether 25% of ﬁsh died during the experiment, the mortality rate was not related to species and habitat). only at the ﬁrst day after stocking, dead ﬁsh were replaced by individuals of similar lengths. zooplankton and ben- thic macroinvertebrates were sampled three times during the experiment, namely at the start (before the enclosures were stocked with ﬁsh, 21 may, t0), in 152 t1) and at the end of the middle (31 may, the experiment (10 june, t2). two zooplankton samples were taken from each enclosure with a 7 l plexiglass tube, sampling the entire water column. pooled samples were ﬁltered through a 100 lm net and ﬁxed with formaldehyde solution (4%). organisms were identiﬁed to species or genus, and their lengths measured. wet weight of zooplankton was calculated by length–weight regressions (mehner et al. 1995). zooplankton was grouped into cladocerans (main species bosmina spp., alona sp.) and copepods (mainly cyclopoids). rotifers were excluded because of their absence in the ﬁsh diet. three replicate samples of macroinvertebrates from each enclosure were obtained using a core sampler (area 30 cm2, length 120 cm), getting down into the sediment to a depth of 10 cm. pooled samples were sieved through a 0.5 mm net and preserved in formaldehyde solution (4%). organisms living on the stems of the reed were not retained with this sampling technique. benthic organisms were determined to genus, and later grouped into insect larvae (chirono- mids, chironomus spp.) and amphipods (gammarus sp.) to calculate mean wet biomasses of resources, lengths of prey items were converted into wet weight by length–weight regressions (mehner et al. 1995). molluscs were excluded from zoobenthos data, because of their general absence in the diet of juvenile ﬁsh. the intestinal fish were sampled by electroﬁshing both in the middle (31 may) and at the end of the experiment (10 june). immediately after capture, ﬁsh were killed, counted, measured to nearest mm tl and weighed to nearest 0.01 g w.m. fish sampled on 31 may were replaced by new ones of similar length and weight. in the laboratory, tracts of ﬁsh were removed and preserved in formaldehyde solution (4%). for further diet analysis, the gut of roach was cut off at the middle of the second bend of s-shaped alimentary canal (persson 1982). contents of intestinal tracts were identiﬁed to species or genus (exception: chironomids, copepods), counted and, if possible, 25 individuals of each prey category were measured. the lengths of all prey items were converted into wet mass using length–mass relationships (mehner et al. 1995). calculations )1) daily growth rates of ﬁsh (g w.m. g w.m. during the two

1997). calculations were based on observed growth rates, and the water temperatures during the experiment, by using the parameter sets juvenile yellow perch (perca recommended for ﬂavescens, kitchell et al. 1977; mehner et al. 1998) and juvenile roach (karjalainen et al. 1997; mehner et al. 1998). energy contents of zooplankton and benthos were taken from mehner et al. (1998). the energetic densities for age-1 roach and age-1 perch )1 (hanson et al. 1997; mehner were 4200 j (g w.m.) et al. 1998). total individual daily consumption was split according to the biomass distribution of prey in the stomachs of ﬁsh, and an average daily consump- tion rate on certain prey groups was calculated for each treatment. pearson’s product moment correlation coefﬁcients between daily prey consumption of roach or perch and available prey biomass in reed and open water treatments were calculated. additionally, the relative proportion of daily prey consumption on the available prey biomass was calculated for both species in both habitats. available prey biomasses were the zooplank- ton and benthos data measured at the middle and the end of the experiment. data on zooplankton, benthos, consumption and growth rates were analysed using measurements of the same response variable within each enclosure at times as repeated measurements (anova). different to compare different experimental designs, statistical analyses were performed using one- or two-way anova with habitat (reed, open water) and ﬁsh (no ﬁsh, roach, perch) as treatments. prior to analysis, data usually were ln(x + 1) transformed to stabilize vari- ances. statistics were run with spss 9.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). results water temperature during the experiment was almost constant and deviated from the mean value of 15 °c by one degree at maximum in all enclosures. oxygen )1 (oxygen content ranged between 4.8 and 10.8 mgæl saturation 50–105%) with lower values in the reed enclosures (anova, f1,66 ¼ 193.03, p < 0.05). zooplankton and macroinvertebrates biomasses of cladocerans, copepods, amphipods and insect larvae did not differ between the different ﬁsh treatment and control enclosures at the start of the ﬁsh · habitat, experiment f2,22 ¼ 0.36, p ¼ 0.33). therefore, ﬁlling of the enclosures resulted in comparable conditions for the treatments (figs 1 and 2).

table 3). in contrast, perch fed more amphipods than roach, and ingested a higher biomass of amphipods in the reed than in the open water (fig. 4a,b; table 3). overall ingestion of insect larvae was higher in the open water than in the reed in both ﬁsh treatments (table 3). for consumption of copepods, both species fed slightly more copepods in the open water (table 3;

schriver et al. 1995; lauridsen et al. 1996; jacobsen et al. 1997; manatunge et al. 2000; burks et al. 2001). provided that the refuge effects of reed and submerged macrophytes are comparable, higher prey biomasses within the reed for both roach and perch might be expected. however, our results did not conﬁrm these expectations. biomasses of prey groups were highly similar the experiment, with the exception of amphipods which were indeed more abundant in the reed. this suggests that the refuge effect of reed for invertebrates was lower in comparison with submerged macrophytes. schriver et al. (1995) found the refuge effect to be negligible when per cent volume infested (pvi) of submerged macrophytes was <15–20%, a value which was never exceeded in the reed stands in mu¨ggelsee (maximum 15–20%). as a consequence, prey avail- ability did not differ between reed and open water, and prey distribution cannot explain the differing diet composition and growth performance of roach in either habitat. however, the reed obviously interfered with the foraging mode of roach, particularly while feeding on cladocerans. uptake of cladocerans by roach was substantially lower in the reed than in the open water. consequently, growth rates of roach were lower in the reed which may indicate that the slightly increased amphipod consumption in the reed did not buffer the energy lost by the reduced uptake of cladocerans. this reﬂects that roach has a generally low foraging efﬁciency on macroinvertebrates (diehl 1988; persson 1993). in addition, roach has a low plasticity to counterbalance the loss of feeding opportunities in the open water, when conﬁned in a habitat of increased structural degree. several experiments with submerged macrophytes have shown that the foraging efﬁciency of roach decreases with increasing structural habitat complexity (winﬁeld 1986; diehl 1988; persson & eklo¨v 1995). as roach feed by fast swimming, snapping and not chasing the prey (winﬁeld 1986; diehl 1988), this behaviour is obviously optimal to feed on cladocerans in the non-structured open water, but not within structured habitats, such as complex submerged macrophytes or even the lower degree of structure offered by reed (winﬁeld 1986; persson & eklo¨v 1995). by contrast, a high feeding plasticity of perch allowed this species to feed efﬁciently in both reed and open water. therefore, the energy intake was sufﬁcient to be converted into similar growth rates in both habitats. the behaviour of perch to swim slowly and attack prey mostly with a burst (winﬁeld 1986) is better suited for foraging in narrow and complex habitats, such as the reed. the high efﬁciency of perch in feeding on macroinvertebrates was supported by the high availability of amphipods in the reed and insect larvae in the open water. therefore, perch has found suitable feeding conditions in both habitats. although not being affected by interspeciﬁc competition from other ﬁsh, e.g., roach, perch hardly consumed zooplankton in both habitats. the nearly complete switch to benthic prey is assumed to be a response to the dominance of small cladocerans (bosmina sp.) in the zooplankton community (mehner et al. 1995), probably not allowing for sufﬁcient energy intake for perch while feeding on zooplankton. our aim to simulate natural predator–prey interac- tions by stocking ﬁsh in densities found also in littoral reed stands of the lake, corresponds with several previous studies (crowder & cooper 1982; johansson 1987; bergman & greenberg 1994; persson & eklo¨v 1995; jacobsen et al. 1997). surprisingly, prey dynam- ics in the enclosures did not indicate a substantial feeding impact by the ﬁsh. abrupt changes in the biomass of planktonic and benthic prey were often shown when critical ﬁsh biomasses were exceeded (post & mcqueen 1987; schriver et al. 1995; hu¨ls- mann & mehner 1997). this ﬁsh density threshold appears to be lake-speciﬁc, controlled by several factors, e.g., lake trophy, structural complexity or predator–prey ratios (schriver et al. 1995; hu¨lsmann & mehner 1997). the overall low impact on planktonic and benthic resources by roach and perch which was found in our study indicates that in a littoral zone with reed stands, ﬁsh biomass did not attain the threshold to develop a sufﬁcient predatory impact to suppress planktonic and benthic prey communities. even a daily uptake higher than 10% of prey biomass (roach: cladocerans in the open water; perch: insect larvae/amphipods in the open water/reed) was appar- ently too low to reduce speciﬁc prey groups. a low predatory impact by ﬁsh was often reported for macroinvertebrates (thorp & bergey 1981; allan 1982; flecker & allan 1984), but was indeed surprising for zooplankton. by examining enclosures separately, roach’s consumption on cladocerans was even positively correlated to cladoceran biomass during the ﬁrst experimental period, whereas during the second period cladoceran biomass decreased despite a low consumption rate by roach. thus, other processes than ﬁsh predation may control prey biomasses as well, e.g., food availability and compe- tition between zooplankton species, or additional predation by invertebrates (hu¨lsmann & mehner 1997). this assumption is corroborated by the decrease of copepod biomass in all treatments, despite almost no predation by ﬁsh on copepods was observed. all the prey biomasses in the littoral zones with reed stands were high enough for both perch and roach to survive. however, only the foraging plasticity of perch allows in all, we conclude that 157 okun & mehner for a substantial energy intake in both habitats, whereas roach were hindered by their low feeding plasticity in the reed and thus need to feed in the open water to maximise their energy intake. in a previous ﬁeld study, okun & mehner (2005) suggested that predation risk by piscivorous ﬁsh forces both young roach and perch to use the reed in mu¨ggelsee as refuge, thus increasing their survival. our enclosure experiment simulated a forced habitat choice over the full diel cycle, as ﬁsh were enclosed within one habitat, thus preventing diel horizontal migrations. as a result, growth rates of roach were lower in the reed than in the open water. under natural conditions, however, diel horizontal migrations between protected and more proﬁtable habitats (bohl 1980; naud & magnan 1988; gliwicz & jachner 1992; jacobsen & berg 1998) may allow the species with nocturnal feeding activity (roach) to balance their ‘feeding inferiority’ against the species which is better adapted to daylight feeding in complex structures (perch). these diel distribution patterns indicate that migrations can be considered as a behavioural trade- off between predator avoidance and food availability. according to our results, diel horizontal migrations seem to be even necessary for roach to optimise energy intake (horppila & peltonen 1997). combined with other behavioural traits, for example, the more effective anti-predator strategies of roach when com- pared with perch (christensen & persson 1993; persson & eklo¨v 1995), we conclude that the behavioural plasticity of roach is the key to allow the coexistence of roach and perch if both species are forced to seek daytime refuge in highly structured habitats, supported by perch’s predominant uptake of macroinvertebrates, especially amphipods, in the reed. our conclusions from this and the previous (okun & mehner 2005) studies can be discussed also in relation to the mechanistic model of ﬁsh community composition along a in lakes (persson et al. 1991). in that model, a dominance of perch over cyprinids in mesotrophic lakes was predicted, and was conﬁrmed by several studies (persson et al. 1991; jeppesen et al. 2000). interest- ingly, however, many mesotrophic lakes in north-east germany do not show a general percid dominance (radke & eckmann 2001, haertel et al. 2002). it the behavioural plasticity of appears possible that roach may also enhance the ﬁtness of roach in mesotrophic lakes with high structural complexity. the energetic advantage of diel horizontal migrations of roach between littoral and pelagic zones to feed on the highly proﬁtable pelagic zooplankton resource during twilight and darkness periods was demonstra- ted for at least one of the mesotrophic lakes in that area where roach numerically dominates (ho¨lker et al. 2002). therefore, roach may successfully trophic gradient 158 compete with perch even in mesotrophic lakes with high structural complexity. resumen 1. la presencia de ha´bitats estructuralmente complejos en las zonas litorales de los lagos puede tener efectos fundamentales sobre las interacciones entre los peces y sus presas. varios estudios han mostrado que las macro´ ﬁtas sumergidas pueden servir de refugio tanto para los invertebrados contra la predacio´n de los peces como para los peces-presa contra la de los peces piscı´voros. sin embargo, hay menos informacio´ n para las manchas de can˜as litorales (phragmites spp.) donde los patrones de interaccio´ n pueden diferir de las de las macro´ ﬁtas debido a la potencialmente menor complejidad ofrecida por las can˜as. dado que el e´xito de forrajeo de los predadores decrece al incrementar la complejidad estructural, la supervivencia de las presas es normalmente mas alta en las estructuras mas densas. 2. un estudio previo encontro´ que los juveniles de rutilus rutilus y perca ﬂuviatilis co-existen de manchas de phragmites. la abundancia nume´rica de r. rutilus en las can˜as y su presencia preferida en estructuras litorales complejas no reﬂejaron la menor eﬁciencia de forrajeo de r. rutilus por presas de invertebrados en ha´bitats estructurados que habı´an sido mostrados ser menores que para p. ﬂuviatilis. ello sugirio que las can˜as sirven esencialmente como refugio contra los piscı´voros litorales de manera que la co-existencia de p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus en las can˜as fue forzada externamente. planteamos varias hipo´ tesis sobre por que´ r. rutilus mostro´ un buen desarrollo de crecimiento. tres de estas hipo´ tesis fueron analizadas experimentalmente. en particular estuvimos intere- sados en saber como el conﬁnamiento de los peces en ha´bitats de can˜a contra ha´bitats de aguas abiertas altera los patrones alimenticios y de crecimiento de los juveniles de edad 1+ de p. ﬂuviatilis y r. rutilus. 3. los peces fueron repoblados separadamente en cerrados litorales por un perı´odo de tres semanas a densidades similares a las observadas en algunos lagos de los alrededores. los cerrados fueron colocados tanto en manchas densas de phrag- mites como en zonas de agua abiertas libres de vegetacio´n. las biomasas de zooplancton y de macro-invertebrados fueron observados muestreando los cerrados tres veces durante el perı´odo experimental. el consumo individual de grupos de presas por los peces fue calculado con un modelo bio- energe´tico y comparado con las biomasas de los grupos de presas de los tratamientos. 4. el conﬁnamiento de los peces en un ha´bitat litoral tuvo claros efectos sobre la composicio´ n de la dieta y sobre las tasas de crecimiento. r. rutilus se alimento´ menos de zooplancton y parcialmente cambio´ a macro-invertebrados en los cerrados de phragmites comparado con los tratamientos en aguas abiertas. como consecuencia, sus tasas de crecimiento fueron menores en las can˜as. p. ﬂuviatilis preﬁrio´ macro-invertebrados en ambos ha´bitats sin que aparecieran diferencias en las tasas de crecimiento. los efectos de la predacio´ n sobre las biomasas de zooplancton y de macro-invertebrados fueron bajas tanto en los cerrados de aguas abiertas como en los de can˜as. las tasas de consumo alimenticio fueron en unos pocos casos mayores del 40% de la biomasa disponible de los respectivos grupos de interactions between juveniles and their invertebrate prey presas pero ba´sicamente estuvieron por debajo del 10% de la biomasa disponible. por ello, argumentamos que tanto las migraciones circadianas horizontales de r. rutilus y el relati- vamente bajo consumo alimenticio de los peces comparado con la biomasas de los recursos disponibles permite la coexistencia de los juveniles de r. rutilus y p. ﬂuviatilis en las manchas de phragmites litorales. acknowledgements we thank
