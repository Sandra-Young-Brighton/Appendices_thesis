(2002), however, gave no details on abiotic factors and food abundance that may affect the observed migration patterns (hohausova et al. 2003), and the cause for the varying numbers of migrating ﬁsh during the winter remained unclear as well (borcherding et al. 2002). consequently, in our study we focused on abiotic factors, such as light intensity, current velocity, water level and temperature. in addition, zooplankton and macrozoobenthos were sampled to gain more information on the food resources of the lake hagener meer and the channel haffensche landwehr, in order to elucidate if differ- ences in food availability between the two habitats could explain the patterns of daily migration. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00132.x 161 heermann & borcherding material and methods site description the hagener meer is a ﬂoodplain lake near the city of rees (western germany), with an area of 15 ha, and a maximum depth of about 2.5 m. the substrate consists of sand, mud and organic material. during summer, there are large areas of submerged and ﬂoating vegetation (nuphar luteum), while the shores are dominated by helophytes, especially phragmites com- munis, which grow in belts of up to 4 m in width. the total vegetation covers 40–50% of the water surface. the hagener meer, hence ‘lake hm’ is drained by the haffensche landwehr channel, hence ‘channel hl’ via the oxbow rees to the river rhine. the ‘channel hl’ is 3-km long and 6 to 7-m wide (fig. 1 in borcherding et al. 2002). its depth depends on the water level adjusted at the weir at the channel’s end, and varies between 40 and 120 cm. the substrate is dominated by sand, gravel, small pieces of wood and other organic materials. a dense growth of trees, bushes and reeds covers most of the banks. in summer, ﬂoating and submerged vegetation can be found. abiotic variables during the study period from november 2002 until may 2003, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conduc- tivity and ph were measured monthly in both the ‘lake hm’ and the ‘channel hl’. in addition, a data- logger recorded the temperature of the ‘channel hl’ daily every 2 h. the water level and the current velocity of the ‘channel hl’ were determined at least every third day (using a ﬂow meter lp-asdi, fa ho¨ntzsch, germany; daily mean value of ten measurements). regular sampling was not possible between december 2002 and february 2003 due to ice coverage. daily weather data, such as rainfall, insolation and wind velocity were received from a nearby weather station (distance to the study site was about 10 km). macroinvertebrates sampling of macroinvertebrates was conducted every 6 weeks from december 2002 to april 2003 using a birge-ekmann grab (university of cologne, germany) (total area 225 cm2). three samples were taken in the ‘channel hl’ and the ‘lake hm’, and sieved through a net of 1-mm mesh size. all organisms were identiﬁed at least to the family level and if possible to the genus level. ten randomly chosen individuals of each taxon were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm. the mean )2) was calculated using biomass (g wet weight m published length–mass relationships (borcherding 1990;

mehner et al. 1995). )1) fish migration fish migrations were observed using a white foil stripe placed on the bottom of the ‘channel hl’ about 40 m downstream from the outlet of the ‘lake hm’ (borc- herding et al. 2002). the foil stripe stretched across the whole channel with a length of 6 m and a width of 60 cm. fish were easily visible against the white stripe, therefore the direction of migration, the abun- dance of migrating ﬁsh and the size of the ﬁsh (juveniles or larger) were observed from a bridge. migrating ﬁsh were counted using hand counters for both directions. to estimate extremely high abundances of ﬁsh, the foil stripe was divided into areas of 60 cm in length. fish needed 3–4 s to pass the foil stripe. therefore, every 3–4 s all areas covered by ﬁsh were counted. the number of ﬁsh per foil stripe area was counted by video recording. therefore, migrating ﬁsh were recorded by a video camera on three different days and the mean value of ﬁsh per area was determined. using this mean value of ﬁsh per area, the abundance of ﬁsh was calculated for the respective period of observation. fish migration was usually observed for two 2-h periods (divided into eight 15-min periods) each day, for which the start was determined randomly per week. in total, ﬁsh migration was observed for 212 h. in addition, the foil stripe was illuminated with a torch from both sides to extend the observation periods at twilight. as revealed by several observations during preliminary studies (borcherding et al. 2002), light had no visible effect on the migration of the juvenile ﬁsh and only a minimal inﬂuence on that of the adults. during the night no observations were possible. during periods of ice cover, observation of ﬁsh migrations were normally possible, because either the ice layer was transparent, or only the lake was covered with ice, while the channel was at least partly free of ice due to the current. differences in abiotic variables between the ‘channel hl’ and the ‘lake hm’ were analysed using a mann– whitney u-test. this test was also used to verify differences in biomass of macrozoobenthos and zoo- plankton between the two sampling sites. to analyse the ﬁsh migrations observed over the foil stripe, the counts of each 15-min interval were transformed [log (x + 1)] and treated as positive for immigrations and negative for emigrations. subsequently, the migration was summarised for the sunrise period (1 h before and 1 h after sunrise), the sunset period (1 h before and 1 h after sunset) and the rest of the day in between. one-way anova and tukey’s post hoc tests were used in order to examine differences in abundance and direction of migrating ﬁsh between these periods. in order to search for abiotic factors that might have affected the seasonal migration patterns, the seasonal trend of decreasing ﬁsh numbers (borcherding et al. 2002) was eliminated with a regression analysis, of which corresponding residuals were calculated. these residuals were used in a mann–whitney u-test to verify the inﬂuence of the qualitative parameter ‘ice coverage’. finally, the residuals were compared in a stepwise multiple regression analysis with values of a theoretical moon cycle, water level, current velocity, rainfall, insolation, wind velocity and water tempera- ture. all statistical analyses were performed using spss (ver. 12.0, spss gmbh, hu¨nchen, germany). results abiotic variables temperature: the ‘channel hl’ and the ‘lake hm’ were not different in terms of chemical parameters such as ph, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature during the winter season (mann–whitney u-test, n ¼ 12 for all parameters;

6 – 20 january and 30 january – 26 february, 2003 (fig. 1a)]. the temperature maximum during the period of investigation was 18.4°c on 12 may and the minimum was 0.7°c on 11 december. during the study, the water level decreased from 109 cm in december to 59 cm in april (fig. 1c). the current velocity was signiﬁcantly correlated to the water level (spearman-rank: r ¼ 0.72, n ¼ 59, p < 0.01), )1 in and decreased from a maximum of 0.25 m s )1 in december to an average of about 0.15 m s march (fig. 1d). 163 heermann & borcherding (a) ) 1 – l t h g e w i t e w g m ( s s a m o b i 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 (b) 4 h after dusk dusk xx xx daphnia spp. small-sized cladocera copepoda others hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm nov jan feb mar dec hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm hl hm nov apr jan feb mar dec apr )1] of zooplankton in the ‘channel hl’ (haffensche landwehr;

table 1). )1 during dusk, and to about 0.9 mg l during winter, the total biomass decreased from )1 in november and december, to about about 6 mg l )1 4 h 0.5 mg l after dusk in january and february, and then increased again in spring. during dusk, the total biomass was signiﬁcantly higher in the ‘channel hl’ than in the ‘lake hm’ in december and february (mann–whitney 164 u-test; table 1), whereas the total biomass of zooplankton sampled 4 h after dusk did not show any differences between the two sites (mann–whitney u-test; table 1). fish migration in this study, only juvenile ﬁshes (sizes up to 120 mm tl) were counted, although sometimes, larger ﬁshes were observed. the number of migra- ting ﬁshes was pooled into three periods: 1 h before to 1 h after sunrise, 1 h before to 1 h after sunset, and the rest of the day between sunrise and sunset. juvenile ﬁshes migrated only during the twilight the day (fig. 3, one-way anova; periods of d.f. ¼ 2, 1701; p < 0.0001). fish entered the ‘channel hl’ in the morning (tukey post-hoc-test, p < 0.05), and exclusively emigrated out of the ‘channel hl’ into the ‘lake hm’ in the evening (tukey post-hoc-test, p < 0.05). the observed movements were strongly correlated to the times of sunrise and sunset (fig. 4). the correlation of the maximum of the morning migration to sunrise was r2 ¼ 0.98 into the ‘channel hl’ (n ¼ 14, p < 0.001), and the maximum of the evening migration out of the ‘channel hl’ to sunset was r2 ¼ 0.98 (n ¼ 17, p < 0.001). the mean time of the maximum migration was calculated using a regression analysis, for which the time of the day was transformed to minutes after midnight. with the formulas shown in fig. 4, the exact time of maximal migration was calculated with a mean of 15 min before sunrise and of 25 min after sunset. to exhibit the seasonal level of migration, only the periods of migration movement were considered, i.e., the twilight periods (fig. 5). if both twilight periods were observed on one day, the mean value of the sum of both periods was calculated. fish migration decreased from a maximum of about table 1. statistical analysis (mann–whitney u-test) of zooplankton samples taken in the ‘channel hl’ (haffensche landwehr;

(mann–whitney u-test, no ﬁsh migration occurred when there was ice coverage, neither on the ‘channel hl’ nor on ‘lake z ¼ 5.25, n ¼ 65, hm’ p < 0.001). the stepwise-regression analysis found that water temperature was the only signiﬁcant factor r2 ¼ 0.25; affecting the migration activity (total d.f. ¼ 1, 44; p < 0.0001) in that juvenile ﬁsh were winter migrations of juvenile ﬁsh most abundant at about 7 °c, with a second increased intensity at around 17 °c in spring. all other factors considered in the stepwise regression analysis were excluded from the model if their signiﬁcance exceeded p ¼ 0.1 (n ¼ 46 for all, theoretical moon cycle: p ¼ 0.36, water level: p ¼ 0.21, current velocity: p ¼ 0.88, rainfall: p ¼ 0.42, insolation: p ¼ 0.91, wind velocity: 0.89). discussion over the day period studied (dawn to dusk), migration of juvenile ﬁsh occurred only during the period from 1 h before to 1 h after sunset or sunrise. in several studies on migratory behaviour of ﬁsh in general, the twilight periods were the main periods of migration (helfmann 1993; eckmann & imbrock 1996; baras & nindaba 1999; borcherding et al. 2002; lucas & baras 2002). in the present study, it was even possible to show that migration of the main number of ﬁsh into the ‘channel hl’ was correlated to the time of 15 min before sunrise on average and emigration from the ‘channel hl’ to the time of 25 min after sunset, suggesting that the light intensity is a critical cue for the daily start of the migration. the total number of ﬁsh emigrating from the ‘channel hl’ in the evening was about 36% lower than the number of ﬁsh immigrating in the morning. this corresponds to results of a study on juvenile ﬁsh by borcherding et al. (2002) at the ‘channel hl’. the reason for the lower percentage of emigrating ﬁsh could be that emigration continued during the night, when no observations were possible (borcherding et al. 2002). reduced numbers of in our study overall numbers of ﬁshes that migrated decreased over the period of the investigation. this may either be caused by over-winter mortality, and thus, overall juvenile ﬁshes (borcherding et al. 2002), or an ever-increasing num- ber of ﬁshes remaining permanently in the ‘lake hm’, or decreased activity in general (eckmann & imbrock 1996). during winter, most ﬁsh reduce their feeding activity, which forces them to exhaust their energy reserves and can lead to death (post & evans 1989; kirjasniemi & valtonen 1997). in addition, increasing energy demands of osmoregulation at very low water temperatures (toneys & cobble 1979) may accelerate over-winter mortality. the sum of ﬁsh migrating not only decreased during winter and spring, but also ﬂuctuated. days where 10,000 ﬁshes migrated were followed by days on which no ﬁsh were observed. to investigate this, the pattern of migration was compared with several abiotic factors. ice was the most inﬂuential factor, and its presence was negatively related to the number of migrating ﬁsh. during periods of ice coverage, the 165 heermann & borcherding days ofobservation ) 1 – y a d  d n i ( h s f i 15,000 10,000 5000 0 5000 10,000 15,000 20,000 into the channel v o n c e d n a j b e f r a m r p a y a m v o n c e d n a j b e f r a m r p a y a m v o n c e d n a j b e f r a m r p a y a m dawn day dusk out of the channel fig. 3. total number of migrating ﬁsh per day 1 h before to 1 h after sunrise (dawn), 1 h before to 1 h after sunset (dusk) and the rest of the day in between, from november 2002 to may 2003. the days of observation are shown at the top of the ﬁgure. winter spring 06:00 08:00 sunrise (time of the day) 07:00 09:00 (a) 09:00 08:00 07:00 06:00 05:00 05:00 (b) 22:00 21:00 20:00 19:00 18:00 17:00 16:00 ) y a d  e h t f o  e m i t ( n o i t a r g m i f o k a e p spring 21:00 22:00 winter 16:00 17:00 19:00 18:00 20:00 sunset (time of the day) fig. 4.

(1998) and lorentsen et al. (2004) showed that the birds even prefer 0+ ﬁsh in some cases. cormorants did not follow the ﬁsh shoals ‘channel hl’ into the winter migrations of juvenile ﬁsh days of observation ) 1 – y a d  d n i

(rutschke 1998). therefore, the ‘channel hl’ represents a better refuge than the ‘lake hm’ during the day. in addition, the ‘channel hl’ is highly structured by vegetation and roots covering the banks as well as the water’s edge and due to this, the channel is assumed to be a refuge comparable to the littoral of the ‘lake hm’. although, this gives some support to theory that a trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance should explain the observed patterns of winter migration, it cannot explain the daily migration patterns. these, however, could be related to energy conservation. one of the major factors governing the ﬁsh behaviour in running waters is current velocity (pavlov 1979). the current velocity of the ‘channel hl’ could therefore be an important factor. holcik (1988) showed that ﬁsh respond to low current velocities with a positive rheotactic response, trying to keep in one place. through increased activity, cold-adapted ﬁsh, such as roach elevate their metabolic rate on a sustained basis by two to three times (brett & groves 1979). we therefore tentatively suggest that energy conservancy may be one important reason for the ﬁsh to migrate into the ‘lake hm’ at night. acknowledgements our thanks are due to hartmut arndt for his support and discussion of this work as well as to dietrich neumann for valuable discussion. the weather data was kindly provided by
