brock doctoral scholarship; nserc research grant; oregon department of fish and wildlife abstract intraspecific phenotypic diversity is the raw material for evolution, so understanding its origin and maintenance is critically important for conservation of biodiversity. intraspecific diversity in a trait or a suite of traits can result from genetic diversity and/ or phenotypic plasticity. the two are, however, not independent as plasticity has been shown to evolve. in this study, we evaluated the importance of phenotypic plasticity in generating morphological diversity in populations of small benthic arctic charr in iceland, using a rearing experiment with contrasting modes of feeding. we also exam- ined the association between phenotypic plasticity in offspring groups generated by the contrasting feeding modes and important ecological variables characterising the natural habitats of the respective populations. although the level of plasticity could not be related to any of the ecological measurements, clear differences in morphologi- cal reaction norms among populations suggest that plasticity is an important aspect of morphological diversity of the charr. it is not clear whether that plasticity is adaptive, but it is notable that reaction norms in all populations have similar reaction to the treatments. k e y w o r d s adaptation, biodiversity, ecological factors, evolutionary ecology, groundwater, iceland 1 |  introduction intraspecific diversity is the raw material for evolution and specia- tion. intraspecific diversity is the product of the genetic structure of the organism, the environment and how these two interact in shap- ing the phenotype (hendry, 2016). the ecology shapes the phe- notype through phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic effects (who are closely related) and through parental effects (gilbert & epel, 2008). biological diversity constantly undergoes dynamic changes and at an ever increasing rate due to human actions. for sustainable harvest and conservation of biodiversity, it is important to study the relationships between ecological and evolutionary processes in maintaining and creating biological diversity of wild populations. here, we study the importance of phenotypic plasticity for morphological diversity in mul- tiple populations of small benthic charr in iceland, and how ecological factors may shape plastic responses in this highly polymorphic species (snorrason & skúlason, 2004). phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a given genotype to pro- duce different phenotypes in different environments (pigliucci, 2005; schlichting & pigliucci, 1998; via, 1994; waples, beechie, & pess, 2011; west- eberhard, 1989, 2003). phenotypic plasticity can occur because specific genes are only expressed in certain environments or because specific genes or alleles are environmentally sensitive and their expressions differ in different environments (schlichting & pigliucci, 1993). furthermore, phenotypic plasticity is believed to be influenced by epigenetic factors, for example dna methylation (leung, breton, & angers, 2016). phenotypic plasticity can be seen as an evolvable trait (pigliucci, 2005; scheiner, 1993, 2002). thus, plas- ticity of a given phenotype (i.e., suite of traits) can evolve (increase/ decrease and direction of change) within populations, if the genetic 636  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:636–645. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltddiversity underlying this plasticity exists. mechanisms for plastic developmental responses are likely to be influenced by many genes and epigenetical factors working in complex circuits (christie, marine, fox, french, & blouin, 2016; leung et al., 2016), and in general, our knowledge as to how phenotypic plasticity evolves in response to selection is limited (czesak, fox, & wolf, 2006; pigliucci, 2005; waples et al., 2011). habitat instability or unpredictability has been suggested to promote the evolution of phenotypic plasticity (masel, king, & maughan, 2007; west- eberhard, 2003). similarly, increased numbers of microhabitats within a specific environment (i.e., niches) or habitat heterogeneity are believed to favour increased phenotypic plasticity (merckx & van dyck, 2006; van buskirk, 2002) as plasticity may allow a higher proportion of the available resources to be used by individu- als within a population. several studies have focused on phenotypic plasticity as an important factor in the origin and evolution of intraspecific diver- sity (e.g., eklöv & svänback, 2006; garduno- paz, couderc, & adams, 2010; leimar, hammerstein, & van dooren, 2006; merilä & fry, 1998; parsons & robinson, 2006; parsons, sheets, skúlason, & ferguson, 2011; robinson & parsons, 2002; svanbäck & schluter, 2012). plasticity may be important in the first generations after populations colonise and/or specialise to a new habitat (christie et al., 2016). in such situations, plasticity, especially in behaviour and physiology (i.e., traits that associate with responses on small timescales), might jumpstart adaptation to novel environments, a process that in some cases can lead to divergence of morphs and even speciation (skúlason & smith, 1995; snorrason & skúlason, 2004). thus, it is predicted that success in invading a new habitat may rely on the presence and frequency of a generalist phenotype that is phenotypically plastic (snorrason & skúlason, 2004). a comparison of levels of plasticity in generalist and specialist populations of threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus, linnaeus 1758) in british columbia supports this prediction (svanbäck & schluter, 2012). in a geographic context, phenotypic plasticity would, in the early phases of colonisation, enable an invading species to successfully populate variable ecosystems. if gene flow among such ecosys- tems is minimal and these ecosystems are stable or predictable, we would expect the new invaders to adapt to the novel habitats and resources. this is a process that could be recognised as specialisa- tions to key elements of the new habitats, in other words morph formation through differential specialisation. as the populations become more specialised, phenotypic development should become more canalised and less plastic (parsons et al., 2011; skúlason & smith, 1995; skúlason, snorrason, & jónsson, 1999; snorrason & skúlason, 2004; svanbäck & schluter, 2012). this could happen in two, potentially combined, ways. one is through the “baldwin effect” where plasticity will allow individuals to survive in new habitats, followed by selection on phenotypic variation (angers, castonguay, & massicotte, 2010; baldwin, 1902; crispo, 2007). the other way is through genetic assimilation, where the plastic phe- notype expressed in a given environment will become genetically hardwired through canalising selection on developmental processes (angers et al., 2010; crispo, 2007; waddington, 1961). the fixation     |  637 may be due to the cost involved in being plastic, which involves the maintenance of a sensory system that can detect the environment and alter developmental pathways accordingly, as well as the cost associated with producing the phenotype, the cost of developmen- tal instability and the cost of having the possibilities of evolving im- proper phenotypes (dewitt, sih, & wilson, 1998; pigliucci, 2005). this strongly suggests that the environmental conditions a popula- tion experiences may be important for the evolution and mainte- nance of phenotypic plasticity. northern freshwater fishes offer good opportunities to study the role of phenotypic plasticity in the evolution of intraspecific biolog- ical diversity (skúlason & smith, 1995). fish communities in these areas are often simple, and systems with only one or two fish spe- cies are common (lehtonen, rask, pakkasmaa, & hesthagen, 2008; robinson & schluter, 2000; robinson & wilson, 1994; schluter, 2000; skúlason & smith, 1995). consequently, competition for resources among fish species is often limited, and intraspecific competition becomes important in driving diversification, which, given stability in different resources, could lead to specialisation. such intraspecific competition is a key factor in contemporary biological diversity that can be seen among many northern freshwater fishes (robinson & schluter, 2000; robinson & wilson, 1998; schluter, 2000; skúlason & smith, 1995; smith & skúlason, 1996; snorrason & skúlason, 2004). phenotypically similar morphs or species are commonly found in sim- ilar habitats among different localities, which supports the hypothesis that natural selection has led to parallel evolution in these populations (kristjánsson, skúlason, snorrason, & noakes, 2012; nagel & schluter, 1998; schluter, 2000; schluter, clifford, nemethy, & mckinnon, 2004). at the same time, plasticity has been seen to be important as a partial source of this diversity (robinson & parsons, 2002; wimberger, 1994). for example, arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus, linnaeus 1758), experimentally subjected to various diet and habitat treatments, shows clear plastic responses in morphology and behaviour (adams & huntingford, 2004; andersson, byström, persson, & de roos, 2005; hindar & jonsson, 1993; klemetsen, 2010; parsons et al., 2011; robinson & parsons, 2002; skúlason, noakes, & snorrason, 1989). assuming that keeping up plasticity in various traits comes at a cost, we predict that adaptation to discrete resources and habitats, that is specialisation, should also result in decreased plasticity (snorrason & skúlason, 2004). small benthic charr found in spring- fed habitats in iceland offer a great opportunity to study this in a high number of specialised populations (kristjánsson et al., 2012). in iceland, arctic charr populations are widespread and show high intraspecific diversity both among and within systems (kristjánsson et al., 2011; skúlason, antonsson, guðbergsson, malmquist, & snorrason, 1992; skúlason et al., 1999; snorrason & skúlason, 2004). an interesting aspect of this phenotypic diversity is the frequent occurrence of small benthic phenotypes (kristjánsson et al., 2012). all these fish are similar in morphology: small, sturdy with subter- minal mouth and dark, cryptic body coloration. these fish have var- ious juvenile characteristics seen in head shape and the retention of parr- marks (kristjánsson et al., 2012), which is a strong indicator that these fish have evolved through paedomorphic specialisation kristjánsson et al.638  |     (kristjánsson et al., 2012; snorrason & skúlason, 2004). they are typically found where cold groundwater emerges as springs in areas rich in lava (sturlaugsson, jónsson, stefánsson, & guðjónsson, 1989; sigursteinsdóttir & kristjánsson, 2005; egilsdóttir & kristjánsson, 2008; kristjánsson et al., 2012). although similar in overall morphol- ogy, they differ among populations in important morphological fea- tures related to foraging (egilsdóttir & kristjánsson, 2008; kristjánsson et al., 2012; sigursteinsdóttir & kristjánsson, 2005). morphological and diet diversity of these fish can be related to ecological conditions in their habitats, indicating parallel patterns (kristjánsson et al., 2012), and genetic studies indicate that these morphs have evolved inde- pendently in each location (kapralova et al., 2011). the numerous populations of icelandic small benthic charr pro- vide a remarkable opportunity to study the relationship between level of specialisation, environmental parameters and phenotypic plasticity. the degree of phenotypic plasticity in these small benthic charr was evaluated using a rearing experiment with two feeding mode treatments. offspring from small benthic charr parents from several populations were fed a common diet delivered in either a “benthic” or a “pelagic” mode. we tested the specific prediction that more ecologically specialised populations, as measured by diet se- lection indices, would have lower plasticity. to further explore the variation in plasticity among populations, we evaluated the possible associations between morphological plasticity and ecological vari- ables characterising the habitats of these icelandic small benthic charr. specifically, we tested the prediction that populations found in springs that flow on as a stream (rheocrene) would show lower plasticity than those found in springs that flow into ponds or lakes (limnocrene). this prediction is based on the complexity of the in- vertebrate biodiversity in these two spring types that is higher in the limnocrene springs (govoni, 2011). 2 |  methods in the fall of 2006, mature small benthic charr from seven popula- tions (figure 1) were collected by electrofishing. the populations were found both in limnocrene and rheocrene springs, and were spatially and reproductive isolated from each other, even when found in relatively close proximity. the fish were transported alive to verið—hólar university college aquaculture research station. eggs from each female were fertilised using milt from one male of the same population (single pair matings). females were small and had relatively large eggs, so the number of offspring from each female was low. the number of families ranged from 5 to 13 among popula- tions (table 1). fertilised embryos from each female were placed in net cages (105 × 105 × 55 mm; 2- mm mesh fibreglass screen). the individual cages were randomly placed in an ewos incubator with a constant flow of water (groundwater from bore holes, 4.1 ± 0.57°c, mean ± sd) and held in total darkness. embryos were observed daily and treated regularly (malachite green 1:500,000) to prevent fungal infection. when embryos had developed eyes and could be handled, dead embryos were removed manually on a daily basis. just before the onset of feeding (more than two of three of the yolk sack was depleted), each progeny group was split in two equal halves and placed in 30- l white plastic buckets (30 cm diameter and 50 cm deep), with constant water flow (7.7 ± 1.23 l/hr) and constant light (overhead fluorescent lighting, 500 lux). progeny from a number of females within each population were pooled to create similar initial densities in the buckets (40–50 fish). prior to this pooling, the progeny groups were split so that progeny from each female were included in both treatments. replicates (i.e., buckets) ranged from two to four for each treatment within each population, and groups were assigned randomly to the experimental set- up. figure 1 locations of populations of small benthic charr in iceland used for this study of phenotypic plasticity kristjánsson et al.s s e n h g u o r  e n o t s  n o i t r o p o r p  y k c o r f o m o t t o b h t g n e l n i a h c t n e r r u c y t i c o e v l e r u t a r e p m e t h p y t i v i t c u d n o c x e d n i n o i t c e e s l 5 4 . 0 5 . 5 2 . 6 1 3 . 7 1 3 . 1 2 2 . 0 4 . 0 9 0 9 0 7 0 2 0 1 9 9 9 9 8 6 3 . 5 4 4 . 5 3 3 . 8 8 4 . 5 7 4 . 5 1 3 . 8 0 5 . 1 0 0 . 0 6 0 . 7 0 0 . 1 1 0 . 6 6 1 . 1 0 0 . 1 1 0 . 8 7 . 5 4 . 5 5 . 2 4 . 4 5 . 0 5 . 9 4 . 8 7 . 3 8 . 1 9 . 5 9 . 9 7 . 9 8 . 0 8 . 0 7 1 0 7 1 2 1 5 9 2 3 1 9 9 1 6 7 0 3 0 − . 2 3 0 − . 9 3 0 − . 4 4 0 − . 7 2 0 − . 0 3 0 − . 7 2 0 − .  d s ± x e d n i v e v i l  d s ± x e d n i s p s e t s u c o r p e c n a t s i d .  9 1 1 0 ± 1 6 0 −  . .  8 3 1 0 ± 1 6 0 −  . .  7 3 1 0 ± 3 6 0 −  . .  2 5 1 0 ± 7 6 0 −  . .  8 5 1 0 ± 2 6 0 −  . .  7 5 1 0 ± 0 6 0 −  . .  9 8 1 0 ± 2 5 0 −  . .  0 7 1 0 ± 9 4 0  . .  1 0 2 0 ± 8 4 0  . .  7 5 2 0 ± 4 6 0  . .  9 6 1 0 ± 6 6 0  . .  9 2 1 0 ± 3 4 0  . .  4 0 1 0 ± 1 4 0  . .  9 0 2 0 ± 6 5 0  . 0 0 1 0 0 . 6 1 1 0 0 . 8 0 2 0 0 . 8 9 1 0 0 . 3 9 0 0 0 . 0 7 1 0 0 . 8 3 1 0 0 . 8 6 1 0 0 . e r u t l u c a u q a n t a v r a ð í l h r a n t o b r á d a k l l n o i t a u p o p r u g ó k s a s ú h ð m i n r ö j t a l í s r a d d o í k v s m u a r t s á r e v þ s e n o t s e v i f f o s s e n h g u o r e g a r e v a d n a ,  m o t t o b e h t n o k c o r f o n o i t r o p o r p  , h t g n e l i n a h c : l y t i x e p m o c t a t i b a h f o s r o t a c i d n i e e r h t d n a , l y t i c o e v t n e r r u c     |  639 immediately after transfer to the buckets, the fish were offered food (0.05–0.08 g start feed, dana feed a|s) to stimulate feed- ing. the food was offered on the surface of the water by hand. after an acclimation of 20 days in the buckets, treatments were initiated where all the fish were fed the same food (see above), but the food was delivered in two different ways. half of the fish were subjected to a “benthic” food delivery treatment in which the food was delivered to the bottom of the buckets via a tube attached to a funnel. the other half was subjected to a “pelagic” food treatment in which the food was distributed on the water surface, where it slowly sank towards the bottom. this experiment followed the same set- up as parsons et al. (2011). all fish were fed to satiation by hand twice a day, but after about 170 days, food (nutra st 0.75) was delivered to the fish by automatic feeders. the pellet size was gradually increased for the “benthic” treatment whereas the food for the “pelagic” treatment was ground down to a smaller size (approximately 0.75 mm) to imitate a natural pelagic diet. the experiment was terminated about 210 days after the transfer to the buckets. fish were killed by an overdose of phenoxyethanol (1,000 ppm). a digital photograph (nikon coolpix 4500, 3.14 megapix- els) was taken of the left side of each fish. the tpsdig program was used to digitise 26 landmarks on each digital image (tps programs; f. james rohlf; http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph). eight of those land- marks were sliding semi- landmarks, and the other were homologous landmarks (figure 2). the sliding semi- landmarks are landmarks that are allowed to slide to the left or right along a curve to minimise the shape change between the procrustes average of all the specimens and each specimen. before analysing morphology, up and down bend- ing of the specimens was corrected using the “unbend” module in the tpsutil program. the module created a line between landmarks at the snout, the end of caudal peduncle and at the fork of the caudal fin. when the fish are bent, this line is curved. the “unbend” procedure calculates the movement of each landmark so that the line becomes straight. in r, package geomorph (adams, collyer, kaliontzopoulou, & sherratt, 2016; adams & otarola- castillo, 2013), procrustes analysis was conducted. this analysis scales the landmarks from each fish to a centroid configuration (mean shape), position and rotation, as well as calculating centroid size, which is the square root of the summed, squared distance of all landmarks from their centroid. procrustes ancova (goodall, 1991), with procrustes landmarks (the measure- ment of morphology) as dependent variables, was used to test for dif- ferences in morphology among populations, between “benthic” and “pelagic” food treatments, nested within buckets, and the interaction of population and treatments. centroid size was used as a covariate to account for the effect of size. thus, the ancova model was body shape = constant + centroid size + population +treatment/bucket + population * treatment. to get an understanding of the magnitude of these effects, we performed a discriminant function analysis (dfa) using the procrustes landmarks as the dependent variable and differ- ent factor (population, treatment and population * treatment) as the independent variable. thus, it was possible to determine how well fish could be classified into groups (population, treatment and popu- lation * treatment) based on their morphology. furthermore, the size  , e r u t a r e p m e t , h p , y t i v i t c u d n o c e r a s e b a i r a v l l a t n e m n o r i v n e e h t  . ) x e d n i l n o i t c e e s v e v

mann–whitney–wilcoxon test, and survival between treatments among populations with a paired t test. measurements of ecological characteristics of the fish habitats were compiled from a larger study (govoni, 2011; kristjánsson, 2008; kristjánsson et al., 2012). these data included information on physical variables, temperature, conductivity, ph, water velocity, the propor- tional cover of rocky bottom and the level of physical complexity of the habitat (table 1), as well as the species composition and density of stone- dwelling invertebrates (govoni, 2011). the mean proportional similarity index (ps) (bolnick, yang, fordyce, davis, & svanbäck, 2002; schoener, 1971) was used from a study on the diet of small benthic charr (kristjánsson, 2008; kristjánsson et al., 2012; table 1). this index provides an estimation of individual specialisation within a population, with values near 1 indicating that all individuals are eating the same prey in the same proportions. as the specialisation of individual’s in- creases, the index gets nearer to 0. the mean ivlev’s electivity index (ivlev, 1961) within populations was also used from the diet study (kristjánsson, 2008; table 1). this index compares proportion of diet groups in the stomach and in the environment to give an indication of diet selection. the index ranges from - 1 (no selection) to 1 (full selec- tion). we estimated populations to be specialised when there was a clear diet selection (ivlev’s index closer to 1), and low variation among individuals within the population (ps index closer to 1). we thus mul- tiplied the two indexes together to get an index of selection within a population. the index ranges from −1 to 1, with higher scores on the index indicating a more specialised population. the procrustes morphological distances between the average fish in the benthic and pelagic treatment were calculated for each population. this distance is an indicator of phenotypic plasticity, with larger values, that is a larger response to the feeding mode treatments, indicating more morphological plasticity. these morphological distances were compared to the specialisation indices and ecological variables (table 1), using nonparametric tests (spearman rank correlation, kruskal–wallis), to test more specific predictions. in all cases, a value of p < .05 was accepted as indicating statistical significance. two populations, kaldárbotnar and oddar, were found to have nonsignificant morphological differences between the treatment groups. these were the populations where the sample size (kaldárbotn, 12 benthic and five pelagic, oddar, 10 benthic and 19 pelagic) was the lowest. thus, the comparisons between mor- phological distances and ecological variables were repeated with these figure 2 landmarks used for morphometric analysis of phenotypic plasticity in small benthic icelandic arctic charr. light grey points represent sliding semi- landmarks, and dark grey points

survival within each population ranged from 1.8% in kaldárbotn pelagic to 28.9% in hlíðarvatn pelagic (table 2). most commonly, the survival was higher in the pelagic treatment, than in the benthic treat- ment (exception kaldárbotnar), which was close to being significant (paired t test, t(6) = −2.2, p = .07). the procrustes ancova revealed a significant effect of size, as measured by centroid size (f(1, 446) = 47.6, p < .01) on shape indicat- ing allometric effects. the model also found significant morphological differences among populations (f(6, 446) = 9.9, p < .01) and treatments,

kaldárbotnar (wilcoxon w = 6, p < .01), although þverá (wilcoxon w = 712, p = .09) was close to being significant. the dfa model on populations classified 84% of the fish correctly to a population, indicating clear morphological differences among populations. the dfa model on diet classified 79% of the fish cor- rectly to a treatment, indicating that the “benthic vs. pelagic” treat- ment affected the morphology of the fish (figure 3). in general, fish in the “benthic” treatment were thinner and had longer caudal fins than fish in the “pelagic” treatment, but the clearest differences were seen in the head of the fish. fish in the “benthic” treatment had larger heads, longer maxillae and a more subterminal mouth than the fish in the “pelagic” treatment (figure 3). as seen above, there were significant interactions between pop- ulation and treatment in the ancova model. when explored further with dfa, the third model classified 77% of the fish correctly to both population and treatment (table 2, figure 4). the populations seemed to separate in two groups on the first dfa axis, where three popu- lations (oddar, sílatjörn and kaldárbotn) showed thicker body and more benthic head shape. these differences are further reflected in procrustes distances between diet treatments within populations that ranged from 0.0081 procrustes distance in oddar to 0.018 in miðhúsaskógur (figure 5). in two populations, kaldárbotn and oddar, the differences between the treatment groups were not found to be significant (table 1). no significant relationships were found between the morphological distances and the specialisation index or with the measured ecological variables (table 3). we reran the tests without the two nonsignificant populations, but no significant relationships were found. 4 |  discussion the small benthic charr populations showed considerable mor- phological plasticity, as demonstrated in their response to the two kristjánsson et al.642  |

between treatments have been omitted. test statistics are t values for pearson’s and chi- square for kruskal–wallis contrasting feeding mode treatments. the effects were clearly seen in body depth, head morphology and caudal fin size. this is consistent with other studies on phenotypic plasticity in arctic charr, showing plastic responses in relation to diet (adams, woltering, & alexander, 2003; andersson, 2003; parsons et al., 2011) and habitat complexity (andersson et al., 2005). however, there were considerable differ- ences in the level of plasticity among the populations, which may represent adaptation in plastic responses, or different plastic ability in populations founding these small benthic charr morphs. in general, studies on other freshwater fishes show benthic morphs to have larger more robust heads, often with subterminal mouth, similarly as seen here, in comparison with more pelagic morphs (reviewed in robinson & parsons, 2002; parsons & robinson, 2006; wund, baker, clancy, golub, & foster, 2008; svanbäck & schluter, 2012). although head morphology of the fish in our experiment was similar as in other studies, we found the benthic fish to be more slender than the pelagic fed fish, which is opposite to most studies. we have no clear explanation for this, but it could be related to the foraging environment. in the benthic treatment, food was delivered in one spot via the funnel, but distributed across the water surface in the pelagic treatment. the results of this may be that fish could more easily defend the food source in the benthic treatment. this could also explain differences in size (fish were larger in the pelagic treat- ment) and survival across treatment; in general, more fish survived in the pelagic treatment, and that relationship was close to being significant. the low survival in the experiment cannot be clearly ex- plained, as there were no indications of any illness and fish were fed excess of food. as there were differences in the number of fish surviving among populations and in the treatments, we cannot rule out that some form of morphological selection took place in addition to plastic responses. but there are no means of testing for that with our design. kristjánsson et al.the magnitude of plasticity, as measured by treatment responses of offspring, did not correlate with the specialisation index that was calculated from the selection indexes derived from adult diet data. thus, the prediction that more specialised populations have lower plasticity (parsons et al., 2011; skúlason & smith, 1995; snorrason & skúlason, 2004) was not supported. however, we have to take these results with a grain of salt as our sample size within each population was low. as pointed out by bolnick et al. (2003), definitions of a spe- cialist are quite subjective. specialists are often defined based on diet, where the organisms in question consume skewed ratios of the avail- able resources and all individuals within the populations consume a similar diet (bolnick et al., 2003). we used this approach in our study. however, stomach contents are not the only measure of diet special- isation. it is well known that alternative diet measurements, such as stable isotope analysis that summarises diet over longer time peri- ods (áraujo, bolnick, machardo, giaretta, & reis, 2007; church et al., 2009), could give different conclusions as to which populations are more specialised. nonetheless, we can conclude that from our results diet specialisation, as conventionally defined, is not correlated with morphological plasticity in small benthic arctic charr. our findings are not supported by studies on other icelandic charr morphs, from lakes thingvallavatn and vatnshlídarvatn. these studies support the prediction that more derived morphs are less plastic than more gen- eralist morphs (parsons et al., 2011). similarly, svanbäck and schluter (2012) found a repeated tendency for more generalised populations of threespine stickleback to evolve a higher degree of phenotypic plas- ticity in morphology compared to more specialised populations. we found no relationships between the magnitude of plasticity and the measured environmental variables, and our prediction that the populations in the limocrene springs have increased plasticity was not supported. relationships between plasticity and environmental fac- tors have previously been found in amphibians. merilä, laurila, and lindgren (2004) examined the influence of latitude on the ability of rana temporaria, linnaeus, 1758, populations to accelerate develop- ment in response to pond drying risk. they found clear differences between northern and southern populations in the magnitude of this plastic response, and related this to the cost of plasticity. similarly, lind and johansson (2007) reported a positive relationship between phenotypic plasticity in developmental time of r. temporaria popu- lations and spatial variation in pool- drying regimes on neighbouring islands of the coast of northern sweden. hutchings et al. (2007) and kobayashi, nagahama, and nakamura (2015) have demonstrated ge- netic variation in life- history reaction norms in a marine fish, and di- versity and plasticity of sex determination and differentiation in fishes, and crozier and hutchings (2014) have described plastic and evolu- tionary responses to climate change, but all over larger scales than are evident in our study. we analysed relationships between environ- mental variations and level of phenotypic plasticity on a much finer scale than previously done. it is possible to conclude from the lack of significant relationships in our study, given the low sample size and few populations, that it will be difficult to identify and quantify such relations on fine geographical and ecological scales.     |  643 in this study, populations of small benthic charr differed in reaction norms for morphology. in all cases, the morphological responses to treatments went in a similar direction. however, the slope of the reac- tion norms differed among populations, as can be seen by differences in morphological distances and deformation grids. these results are consistent with results from plasticity experiments on other icelandic charr morphs (parsons et al., 2011) and populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (parsons & robinson, 2006). the origin of these differences could be caused by chance alone, or because of responses to selec- tion on the reaction norms, for example through genetic assimilation and/or baldwin effect. it is, however, not clear how the level of plas- ticity found in these highly specialised small benthic charr populations compares to the more ancestral form of charr in iceland, which is be- lieved to be anadromous (snorrason & skúlason, 2004). anadromous charr in iceland commonly spawn in rivers, where the offspring stay for 1–3 years posthatching, feeding mostly on drift (skúlason et al. 1992). they later migrate to the ocean to feed and mature. because of the variable environment that anadromous fish encounter during their life cycle, it is not unlikely to expect that they have retained high levels of plasticity (although that has not yet been much studied), that may enable them to adapt rapidly to various freshwater environments (e.g., skúlason et al., 1992; snorrason & skúlason, 2004). to conclude, the occurrence of numerous small benthic charr pop- ulations in icelandic springs is a clear example of the great diversity ob- served within this species. the specialised adaptation of these fish is likely the result of paedomorphosis, as they retain a number of juvenile phenotypic traits, for example the subterminal mouth, small size and parr- marks (kristjánsson et al., 2012). the charr are however diverse in the fine tuning of their morphology, where plasticity is likely to be a key element in shaping the phenotypic diversity. these specialised paedomorphic arctic charr populations show considerable plasticity, but this differs among populations. phenotypic plasticity is clearly an important factor shaping morphological diversity of these populations. it is not clear whether this plasticity is adaptive as we did not find significant relationships between plasticity and ecological factors at a relatively fine geographic scale. acknowledgements we thank j. ackerman, k. räsänen, h. li, j. s. ólafsson and two anonymous reviewers for suggestions, advice and discussions of this study. i. arnarson, e. l. jónsdóttir, and r. sturlaugsdóttir, all assisted with fieldwork and sample analyses. the project was supported by the brock doctoral scholarship, university of guelph, and a graduate student grant from the icelandic science foundation to bkk. dlgn was supported by an nserc research grant, and by the oregon department of fish and wildlife. hólar university college also gener- ously funded this project. the authors declare no conflict of interests. orcid bjarni k. kristjánsson http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6984-5771 kristjánsson et al.644  |     references adams, d. c., collyer, m. l., kaliontzopoulou, a., & sherratt, e.
