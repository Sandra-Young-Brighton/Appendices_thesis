colonisation; freshwater fishes; glacial maximum; phylogeography introduction from the beginning of the quaternary (2.6 million years before present, ybp) and the formation of the arctic ice cap to the present day, the northern hemi- sphere has been subjected to cyclical patterns of ice sheet expansion and contraction (hewitt 2000) which has dramatically influenced the distribution and genetic structure of the current biota (hewitt 1996; dynesius & jansson 2000). during the quaternary glacial periods, temperate regions of the northern hemisphere saw extinctions and southward shifts in species ranges, with a corresponding recolonisation into northern areas during the warmer interglacials (culling et al. 2006). phylogeographical analysis has suggested many western european species persisted during these glacial periods in refugia located in ibe- ria, italy, the balkans-greece and the caspian/cauca- sus regions (hewitt 2004). terrestrial postglacial colonisation patterns have been described based on several model species (hewitt 1999), with geographi- cal features such as mountain ranges and water bodies impacting species’ capacity to disperse (taberlet et al. 1998). freshwater fishes, however, are restricted in their dispersal ability by the interconnectedness of river catchments (culling et al. 2006; reyjol et al. correspondence: thomas a. worthington, school of biosciences, cardiff university, cardiff cf10 3ax, uk. e-mail: worthingtont1@cardiff.ac.uk current address: cardiff school of biosciences, cardiff university, cardiff, uk doi: 10.1111/eff.12285 415 worthington et al. 2007) leading hewitt (2004) to suggest a ‘new para- digm’ was required. postglacial colonisation of euro- pean rivers appears to have been generally from the black sea via rivers such as the danube or dnieper, although routes and glacial refugia are often species specific (hewitt 2004; makhrov & bolotov 2006). more recent studies (e.g., h€anfling et al. 2002; fin- negan et al. 2013) have suggested some species may have persisted in ‘cryptic northern refugia’ (stewart & lister 2001). fishes of in his paper, ‘the origin and distribution of the freshwater the british isles’, wheeler (1977) discussed two potential mechanisms for the colonisation of british rivers by stenohaline fishes. the first, proposed by scharff (1899) was that the freshwater fish species of southern and eastern eng- land colonised following the last glacial maximum during the existence of a land bridge between great britain and europe. the land bridge is thought to have persisted until 7500 ybp, enabling the connec- tion of the eastern english rivers from the humber through east anglia, with the rhine system as tributaries or through the formation of a shared sea- sonal floodplain (wheeler 1977). the second, pro- posed by orkin (in schindler 1957), was that certain species persisted in refugia during the last glacial maximum, having established in british riv- ers during an earlier interglacial. wheeler (1977) suggests that this glacial refugia theory is unlikely, due to the unsuitable environmental conditions for spawning, although he did advocate the possibility that both mechanisms may have been possible. the landbridge theory would seem to be supported by the present day distribution of freshwater fishes as species richness is reduced to the north and west of the british isles (maitland & lyle 1996), although this pattern is confused by human induced move- ments of fishes or dispersal through canal systems (wheeler & easton 1978). the distribution of the freshwater gadoid, the burbot lota lota, stretches across north america and eurasia (scott & crossman 1973). despite this extensive range, many populations, particularly in western europe, are threatened with extirpation (stapanian et al. 2010), while l. lota is thought to have become extinct in english rivers in the early 1970s (worthington et al. 2010). recent analysis of mitochondrial dna sequence variation in l. lota from across its global distribution suggested divi- sion into two subspecies: l. l. lota found in eurasia and alaska and l. l. maculosa from north amer- ica, south of the great slave lake (van houdt et al. 2005). after separation, the l. l. lota popula- tion was limited to a glacial refuge from where it colonised eurasia (van houdt et al. 2003). euro- pean l. lota have been subjected to three or four 416 it is hypothesised that subsequent glacial cycles, splitting the species into several genetic clades (see fig. 1 in van houdt et al. 2005). the english population belonged to the western european clade owing to the likely colonisation of english rivers via the landbridge that existed following the last glacial maximum. lota lota’s former english distri- bution corresponds well with this theory, as the species was restricted to forty-two rivers in eastern england prior to extinction around the beginning of the 1970s (worthington et al. 2010). lota is subject the aim of this study was to examine the origin and timing of the colonisation of the british stenoha- line fish fauna using l. lota. due to its recent extirpa- tion from english rivers, l. to an investigation as to the feasibility of reintroduction to the rivers of its former english range (worthington et al. 2009). as such, understanding the genetic rela- tionship between the former english l. lota popula- tion and potential source populations is an important consideration in reintroduction planning (leonard 2008). material and methods samples tissue samples were collected from l. lota specimens known to have been captured in england. museums and universities with natural history collections were contacted to determine whether they held preserved english l. lota, and samples were taken from those with suitable specimens (table 1). a sample of accessible material, either fin clips or muscle tissue, was collected either by the institution’s staff or a trained taxidermist. the samples were either from dried taxidermy specimens (n = 8) or fixed using formaldehyde and stored using industrial methylated spirit (ims, n = 7). the english samples were then compared to sequences from burbot collected from across the species’ global distribution (genbank numbers ay656840–ay656915; van accession houdt et al. 2005). dna extraction and sequence analyses dna analyses were carried out in a laboratory dedi- cated to the analyses of archival material. burbot material had never previously been sequenced within the building that housed the laboratory, removing the possibility of contamination from samples outside the study. to control for cross-sample contamination, analyses were duplicated with a maximum of three samples analysed concurrently. all sequencing was carried out in a laminar flow cabinet. dna was extracted using the nucleospin extraction kit burbot colonisation of english rivers yorkshire east stockwith bur15 river/area river trent river wissey river tame river thet middle level drain yorkshire sample bur02, bur08, bur09 bur05 bur06 bur07 bur10 bur12 near noƫngham bur01 welney bur04 river thet aldreth bridge bur03 near cambridge bur14 theƞord bur11, bur13 fig. 1. the rivers of the former english lota lota distribution in relation to the maximum ice sheet extent during the last glacial maximum (red dashed line, adapted from bowen et al. 2002). location of samples with specimen capture site and river information denoted by green circles (numbers relate to sample number in table 1), rivers/areas without site information marked. 417 worthington et al. table 1. the capture date and location of the 15 lota lota specimens if known, the current location of the specimen and the success of the genetic analysis. ref river location date institution preservation sequenced river trent river trent old west river great ouse river wissey river tame river thet river trent river trent bur01 bur02 bur03 bur04 bur05 bur06 bur07 bur08 bur09 bur10 middle level drain bur11 bur12 bur13 bur14 bur15 river thet - river thet – river trent nr nottingham – nr. aldreth bridge welney – – – – – – thetford, norfolk yorkshire thetford, norfolk nr. cambridge east stockwith 3 mar 1905 – 21/22 sep 1969 1929 1936 1886 – – – 1884 – – – – 3 nov 1869 dried wollaton park museum wollaton park museum dried cambridge university museum ims cambridge university museum ims dried norwich museum dried warrington museum dried victoria museum, cawthorne dried calke abbey calke abbey dried dried wisbech museum ims natural history museum ims natural history museum ims natural history museum natural history museum ims ims oxford university museum yes yes no no yes yes yes no no yes yes no no no yes ims, industrial methylated spirit. genbank accession numbers kj381202 kj381203 kj381204–kj381205 kj381206 kj381207 kj381208–kj381209 kj381210 kj381211–kj381212 (macherey-nagel gmbh). the digestion, undertaken over a period of 3–5 h, was enhanced by grinding the samples with a pestle during the incubation phase;

(2005). network ver- sion 4.0.0.1 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com) was used to construct reduced median (rm) and median- joining (mj) networks (bandelt et al. 1999, 2000). to estimate the divergence time between english and continental haplotypes, reduced mj networks were used to calculate q  r (forster et al. 1996), where q is the average distance from all descendant haplo- types to the ancestral node of the mj network and r is a variance estimator. the q statistic was translated into years using a mutation rate for the lota lota con- trol region of 2–6% per million years. this value was based on previous research estimating lineage-speci- fic mutation rates (van houdt et al. 2005). the abso- lute time since divergence estimations should be interpreted with caution; however, the rough scale of time since divergence can provide valuable insights. results samples a total of fifteen l. lota specimens were sampled (table 1), three of which had duplicate samples taken l19progm and glacial lineages of l. lota have been described using domain i, 450 base pairs (bp), of the mito- chondrial control region (cr) which has been identi- fied as containing 90% of the variation found within the entire l. lota control region (van houdt et al. 2005). domain i of the cr was targeted using the -cca cta gct c 0 primers (5 cc aaa gct aga-3 0 hdl400ll ) -gat tta gga ttt atg tac tcc-3 0 0 (5 ) resulting in an amplicon of approximately 420 bp (van houdt et al. 2005). the l19progm primer was also combined with the newly developed hdl230ll -cgc tag atg atc tct ta 0 (5 primer c tac-3 0 ) specifically to amplify the first 270 bp of the cr. a minimum of two independent pcr amplifications were carried out per sample per mar- ker. the pcr was carried out in 30 ll containing (invitrogen), 1–20 ng template 1 9 pcr buffer dna, 2.0 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm dntps, 0.6 units of taq dna polymerase (platinum taq, invitrogen) and 0.4 lm of forward and reverse primers. the pcr profiling commenced with an initial denaturation of 3 min at 94 °c, followed by 40 cycles of 45 s at 94 °c, 50 °c and 72 °c, finishing with a final 7 min at 72 °c. pcr products were purified by means of the nucleofast pcr cleanup (macherey-nagel, gmbh) or with ‘gfx pcr dna and gel band purification 418 burbot colonisation of english rivers (table 1; genbank (bur05, both samples); however, 270-bp amplicons were obtained for eight of the 15 specimens and no sequence was obtained for the remaining seven speci- mens numbers kj381202–kj381212). samples that had been taken from the taxidermy specimens more frequently pro- duced sequences (six sequences from eight specimens) than those stored in ims (2/7). for quality control, the obtained sequences were compared to the mitochon- drial genome sequence of l. lota (ap004412). accession in comparison with the reference sample, three c?t mutations at positions 15718, 15719 and 419 fig. 2. reduced median-joining (mj) network of lota lota control region haplotypes for (a) the 420-bp data set and (b) the 270-bp data set showing the relationship between the english haplotypes (green circles) and haplotypes from alaska (yellow), beringia (pink), eurasia (red), west europe (blue) and north europe (purple). each branch represents a single nucleotide change, and black dots indicate unsampled haplotypes. (bur05, bur10 and bur15). the samples were almost exclusively from the river trent (six samples) or great ouse (eight) catchments with only a single sample from yorkshire in the northern extent of the species’ former english distribution (fig. 1). dna extraction and sequence analyses two dna extracts were obtained for each of the 15 l. lota specimens (n = 36, extraction was duplicated for specimens bur05, bur10 and bur15). a 420-bp amplicon was specimen achieved for single a worthington et al. 15892 were observed in a single sample for the bur10 specimen. these mutations, however, were absent from the second bur10 sample. a c?t vari- ant at position 15785 was observed in bur07 that was not present in any other specimen, and a repli- cate sample was not available to confirm this muta- tion. consequently, both bur10 and bur07 were removed from further analyses. all other variants were observed in at least two independent specimens or the matching samples from the same specimen. overall, one new english haplotype was detected in the 270-bp amplicon: a haplotype shared by five specimens (bur01, bur02, bur05, bur06 and bur15) from the rivers trent, wissey and tame. all specimens were characterised by an a?g muta- tion except bur11 which was similar to the refer- ence sequence at that position. in the specimen from which a 420-bp sequence was obtained (bur05), two additional t?c transitions at 16031 and 16081 were observed (positions 330 and 380 on the 420-bp amplicon). these variants were confirmed in the two independently analysed samples of this specimen. network analyses separate network analyses were constructed for both the 270-bp and 420-bp sequences, firstly, for the 420-bp sequence that combined the bur05 haplo- type with the relevant known european haplotypes. all network construction methods produced identical results (fig. 2a). the bur05 haplotype was clearly different from the previously reported l. lota haplo- types, differing by two mutations at positions 144 and 381 from eb01, a variant observed in western europe. the same analysis was performed on the 270-bp sequence, including the bur11 haplotype. due to the limited data set, the bur11 haplotype could not be distinguished from the common eura- sian/west european haplotype (fig. 2b). neverthe- less, the shared bur01, bur02, bur05, bur06, bur15 haplotype was still differentiated by a single mutation from all other known variants. using a divergence estimate of 2–6% per million years to examine the observed divergence in the 420-bp and 270-bp data sets indicates that the english population diverged from the continental population between 80,000 and 240,000 years ago for the 420-bp data set and between 62,000 and 186,000 year ago for the 270-bp data set. discussion analysis of the 420-bp sequence from bur05 sug- gests that the extinct english l. lota population was distinct from the clades highlighted by van houdt et al. (2003, 2005) who sampled l. lota from across 420 its global distribution. in this data set, we find the presence of a haplotype in england that is not present in the western/northern europe samples examined by van houdt et al. (2005) which included 84 samples from across the species range in western/northern europe and yielded 13 distinct haplotypes. given the sampling effort of van houdt et al. the absence of the english haplotype from western/north- ern europe suggests that the english haplotype is indeed restricted to england and not the result of a sampling artefact. (2005), despite supporting the mainland european origin of l. lota in the british isles, the presence of a dis- tinct haplotype provides evidence that l. lota was present in england during the last glacial maximum (~14,000 ybp). our study gives further support to the hypothesis that certain species survived recent glacia- tions in northern refuges (stewart & lister 2001). the freshwater fish fauna of great britain is gener- ally considered to be comparatively young in geo- graphical and evolutionarily terms (hughes et al. 2001), with the widely accepted theory being that lota, the six useable samples produced two new eng- lish haplotypes in the 270-bp amplicon data set. the 270-bp network provides additional insight about geographical differentiation between england and western/northern europe. the relationships among these shorter haplotypes illustrates a single shared haplotype with western/northern europe, while none of the other english samples group within any of the other geographical areas, further suggesting a distinct english lineage of l. lota. while the results suggest a slight divergence of english l. the analysis reveals the extirpated population was closely related to western and central european clades and likely founded through colonisation from western europe via a land bridge (see wheeler 1977). historical liter- ature published from the 12th century onwards sug- gests that l. lota was confined to rivers of eastern england (worthington et al. 2010), which would have been linked to the rhine system as tributaries or through the formation of a shared seasonal floodplain (wheeler 1977). the sequences from the english population share much of the genetic code with the haplotypes of the central and western european clades including the ancestral eb30 from central eur- ope. however, degradation of the samples, owing to age and storage, meant that with one exception, too few base pairs were produced to fully disentangle the relationship between former english population and these two ancestral clades. the sole exception permit- ted a preliminary evaluation of the relationship, which suggests the english population diverged from the western european clade. however, this result should be treated with caution due to the lack of replication. stenohaline fishes colonised from the rhine basin fol- lowing the last glacial maximum (see wheeler 1977). however, species with current northerly distributions (>60°n) appear to have ecological and physiological traits that would have allowed them to persist in northern glacial refuges (bhagwat & willis 2008). the physiological tolerance of l. lota would help to explain the possibility the species survived in english rivers during the devensian (12,000 – 110, 000 ybp). the extent of the ice sheet during the last glacial maximum indicates a significant proportion of the l. lota’s english distribution would have been unavail- able (bowen et al. 2002; fig. 1). however, l. lota are cold-adapted (h€olker et al. 2004) and able to spawn in temperatures as low as 1 °c (mcphail & paragamian 2000 and references therein). evidence from the archaeological record also supports the pres- ence of l. lota prior to the last glacial maximum, with the species recorded from lower palaeolithic (300,000–2.5 million ypb) deposits at barnham, suf- folk (ashton et al. 1994). this study and similar phy- logenetic cold-adapted taxa, bullhead cottus gobio (h€anfling et al. 2002) and brown_trout salmo_trutta (garcıa-marın et al. 1999; mckeown et al. 2010), suggest that freshwater fishes may have colonised the british isles prior to and per- sisted through the last glacial maximum. for other analyses to represent the majority of the study was based on samples collected from fif- teen specimens, of which eight provided suitable material for sequencing. the samples analysed are thought available museum l. lota specimens of known english origin (pers. obs.). analysis of historical material stored in museum collections is one of the only ways to map genetic relationships for extinct populations (e.g., hammond et al. 2001; gugolz et al. 2008). as such, analyses consisting of limited samples still provide valuable insight for understanding phylogenetic and conservation questions (e.g., reintroduction; pages et al. 2009). future genetic analysis could include data from bone fragments, with those from outside the species’ known range (e.g., the river thames; astill & lobb 1989; hawkes & fasham 1997) poten- tially providing greater a glacial refugium. while this study is underpinned by a mod- est sample size in the context of modern genetic investigations, the authors consider that the results provide a preliminary picture of the relatedness of the former english stock to the remainder of the global population. the validity of the results is underlined by replicated sequences from two different samples from the same specimen and the close correspon- dence from geographically separate river catchments. sequences between evidence for this study suggests that the extirpated english l. lota was genetically different from the other populations in burbot colonisation of english rivers both eurasia and north america. despite this differ- ence, the english population was closely related and probably diverged from those in central and western europe. this provides a framework for selecting suit- able source populations, should reintroduction of l. lota to english rivers be deemed feasible. there appears the possibility that lota lota colonised eng- lish rivers prior to the last glacial maximum surviving the ice age in refugia. this information, together with studies of other freshwater fishes, illustrates that the impact of global climatic cycles on species distribu- tions are species specific and linked to the organism’s physiological, biological and ecological traits. acknowledgements the research was funded
