(2010) found distinct resource partitioning between the species in lake biggijavri, northern norway, with arctic charr and grayling occupying different littoral niches and whiteﬁsh utilising the pelagic habitat and food resources. amundsen et al. the stable coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh could be facilitated by the presence of sympatric grayling forcing whiteﬁsh to utilise primarily the planktivorous niche. this suggestion is supported by the theoretical model developments of abrams & ruefﬂer (2009) arguing that coexistence of three competing species may occur if the intermediate species (i.e., arctic charr) is more similar in niche use to one of the others (i.e., grayling). however, in shallow lakes with small profundal and pelagic areas, arctic charr and whiteﬁsh have lower ability for resource partitioning. in such lakes, the higher potential of arctic charr to piscivory (l’abe´e-lund et al. 1992; amundsen 1994) may potentially help to escape interspeciﬁc interactions from planktivorous whiteﬁsh as well as from benthiv- orous species like grayling. thus, the availability of small-sized prey ﬁsh species may suggestively favour the coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh (sva¨rd- son 1976; kahilainen & lehtonen 2002). here, we studied the habitat use and diet of arctic charr coexisting naturally with both whiteﬁsh and grayling in three near-pristine lakes in subarctic norway. we extended the study of amundsen et al. (2010) by analysing stable carbon (d13c) and nitrogen (d15n) isotope ratios from ﬁsh muscle tissue to trace the long-term niche use of the three species. the stomach contents reveal the recently ingested prey items, whereas the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios reﬂect the assimilated food sources and the trophic position of ﬁsh over several months (fry 2006; buchheister & latour 2010). by combining these methods and data collected from one relatively deep coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh (zmax = 52 m) and two shallower lakes (zmax = 12 and 17 m), we were able to explore the temporal and spatial stability of the possible resource partitioning between the three ﬁsh species. we hypothesised that resource partitioning between arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling should be evident: (i) in all the study lakes despite differences in lake maximum depth, and (ii) from both stomach contents and stable isotopes results, demonstrating temporal stability of niche segregation. finally, we hypothesised (iii) that high dietary plasticity of arctic charr the observed species coexistence. facilitates methods study site the three study lakes, biggijavri (69°33¢n, 23°46¢e), vuolit spielgajavri (69°26¢n, 23°33¢e) and datkujavri (69°29¢n, 23°26¢e), are all oligotrophic and slightly humic lakes located at different altitudes along the mazejokka tributary of the kautokeino–alta water- course in northern norway. biggijavri is the deepest, largest and most oligotrophic lake, but otherwise, the lakes have rather similar physical and chemical (measured by the university of tromsø) characteristics (table 1). the lakes are dimictic and usually ice-free from june to october. the catchment area (approxi- mately 120 km2 in total) consists mainly of mountain birch forest and bogs. the ﬁsh communities are dominated by whiteﬁsh, arctic charr and grayling, whereas burbot (lota lota), brown_trout (salmo_trutta), pike (esox lucius) and european minnow (phoxinus phoxinus) are present in relatively low densities. arctic charr and whiteﬁsh occur as monomorphic populations in all the study lakes. no considerable ﬁshery or any stocking activity is occurring in the lakes. habitat and stomach content analyses in 1st–3rd samples were collected from biggijavri september 2008, from vuolit spielgajavri in 4th– 6th september 2008 and from datkujavri in 7th–8th september 2009 (table 1). fish were sampled in littoral, profundal and pelagic habitats using 40-m- long survey gill nets composed of eight randomly distributed 5-m panels of 10, 12.5, 15, 18.5, 22, 26, 35 and 45 mm bar mesh sizes. in the littoral and profundal sampling sites, 1.5-m-deep bottom nets (9–13 per lake) were used, whereas 6-m-deep ﬂoating nets (2 per lake) were used in the pelagic zone in each lake (1–2 nights per lake). some additional ﬁsh for the stomach content and stable isotope analyses were sampled using 30-m-long and 1.5-m-deep single mesh-sized (20, 22, 26, 32,

for each ﬁsh species at each sampling occasion from the littoral, profundal and pelagic habitats. after removal from the gill nets, ﬁsh were kept cool and brought to the ﬁeld laboratory, where they were identiﬁed, measured (fork length, mm) and weighed (g). the stomachs were removed and preserved in 96% ethanol until subsequent analysis. later, the stomachs were opened, and the total fullness was visually determined on a percentage scale ranging from empty (0%) to full (100%). the prey items were identiﬁed to species, genus or family level, and their contribution to the total fullness was estimated (amundsen et al. 1996). the prey taxa were cladoceran zooplankton (bosmina sp., daphnia sp., holopedium gibberum, bythotrephes longimanus, polyphemus sp.) and (ii) copepod zooplankton (cyclops scutifer, eudiaptomus sp., acanthocyclops sp.), (iii) adult and pupal stages of aquatic and terrestrial insects, (iv) chironomid larvae, (v) trichoptera larvae, (vi) other larvae (megaloptera, ephemeroptera, plecoptera, tipulidae sp.), (vii) gammarus lacustris amphipods, (viii) eurycercus lamellatus chydorids, (ix) clams (pisidium sp., sphaerium sp.), (x) snails subsequently grouped into (i) insect 560 (lymnaea sp., valvata sp., planorbidae sp.) and (xi) ﬁsh. cladoceran and copepod zooplankton were considered as pelagic prey, whereas all benthic invertebrates were considered as littoral prey. how- ever, chironomid larvae and pupae and clams can either have a littoral or profundal origin and thus represent different energy sources for the ﬁsh. in the same way, adult insects include both aquatic (e.g., chironomids, trichoptera, tipulidae sp.) and terres- trial (e.g., hymenoptera) species, which can have clearly different isotope values. the habitat and dietary overlap between arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling were estimated using schoener’s (1970) similarity index: ! jpxi   pyij x a ¼ 1   0:5 n i¼1 where pxi is the proportion of habitat ⁄ prey group i used by species x, pyi is the proportion of habitat ⁄ prey group i used by species y, and n is the number of habitat ⁄ prey categories. the same index was also used to estimate species-speciﬁc similarities in habitat and diet use between the lakes. the overlap ⁄ similarity is considered high when the index value exceeds 60% (wallace 1981). the dietary niche width (b) was calculated using levins (1968) index: x b ¼ 1= p2 i where pi is the proportion of each prey type i in the diet expressed as fraction rather than percentage. stable isotope analyses in addition, qualitative samples of for stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen, a small block of white dorsal muscle tissue posterior to the dorsal ﬁn was dissected from fresh subsamples of ﬁsh (table 1) and stored at )20 °c until later prep- aration. the muscle samples were dried at 60 °c for 48 h and ground to a ﬁne powder using a mortar and pestle. littoral (depth <2 m) and profundal (depth 12–30 m) benthic macroinvertebrates (hereafter benthos) and zooplank- ton (several vertical hauls from 10 to 0 m) were collected and prepared for isotope analyses. animals were sorted to genus level, dried at 60 °c for 48 h and ground using an iron bar or a mortar and pestle. from molluscs, only the soft body tissue was prepared for later stable isotope analyses. isotopic analyses of carbon and nitrogen were mainly carried out at the institute for environmental research, university of jyva¨skyla¨, finland, using a flashea 1112 elemen- a thermo finnigan tal deltaplus advantage mass spectrometer (thermo fisher scientiﬁc, waltham, ma, usa). some isotope analyser coupled to samples from biggijavri were analysed at the nerc life sciences mass spectrometry facility, east kil- bride, scotland, by continuous ﬂow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (cf-irms) using a costech ecs 4010 elemental analyser interfaced with a thermo fisher scientiﬁc delta xp plus irms. we checked the consistency of the instruments by analysing d13c and d15n values from a ﬁsh standard (i.e., whiteﬁsh muscle tissue) and found no signiﬁcant differences. isotope ratios are expressed as values in parts per thousands (&), and differences from a standard reference material are calculated as: x ¼ 103ðrsample   rstandardþr 1 standard where x is d13c or d15n, rsample is the corresponding ratio 13c:12c or 15n:14n, and rstandard is the ratio of the international references vienna peedee belemnite (vpdb) for carbon and atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen. the analysed c:n values, which are posi- tively correlated with the lipid content of sample, indicated no need for lipid adjustment of d13c values (see kiljunen et al. 2006). the d13c and d15n values of arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling were compared within each lake using nonparametric kruskal–wallis and mann–whitney u tests as assumptions for parametric tests were not met. the same statistical tests were used to compare the total length of arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling within each lake and between the lakes. in addition, the recently developed isotope mixing model stable isotope analysis in r (siar; parnell et al. 2010) was employed to estimate the relative contributions of littoral and profundal benthos and zooplankton in the diets of arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling. for arctic charr, ﬁsh were also included as a food source by combining all the available isotope data from small prey ﬁsh (i.e., minnows and burbots of fork length 80– 172 mm). the siar model utilises a bayesian approach to estimate source contribution and incorpo- rates isotopic variability both in the consumer and in the food sources. siar has recently been successfully used in estimations of littoral, profundal and pelagic diet contributions for whiteﬁsh populations in northern finland (harrod et al. 2010). here, modelling the diets of arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling in siar was enabled by the clear isotopic separation between littoral, profundal and pelagic invertebrates and small ﬁsh of 1.0 ± 1.0& for d13c and 3.3 ± 1.0& for d15n were chosen to correspond to the most often reported and used factors (vander zanden & rasmussen 1999; post 2002) and to incorporate the variation of fractionation values observed in a meta-analysis (mccutchan et al. 2003). concentrations of carbon and nitrogen were also incorporated into the siar model despite only (fig. 5). trophic enrichment factors coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh minor differences between the food sources (total range 47–53% for carbon and 7–13% for nitrogen). to investigate the dietary plasticity and trophic niche width of arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling in each lake, we calculated the areas encompassing the indi- viduals of each species in the d13c–d15n bi-plot space (cf. fig. 4) using the ‘minimum convex polygon estimator’ in the ‘adehabitat’ package in r (calenge 2006). instead of calculating total convex hull areas encompassing the isotope values of all individuals (cf. layman et al. 2007), we restricted the isotopic niche areas to bound 95% of the individuals of each species to exclude possible outliers, which could potentially overextend the niche areas. all statistical analyses were performed using pasw statistics 18 for windows (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) and r 2.10.1 (r development core team 2009). results niche segregation between the species a total of 73 arctic charr, 382 whiteﬁsh, 294 grayling, 21 burbot, two minnow and two brown_trout were caught with the survey and single mesh-sized gill nets from the three study lakes. the arctic charr catch (cpue) was relatively low compared to whiteﬁsh and grayling, but substantially higher compared to other ﬁsh species (fig. 1). the arctic charr cpue was highest in biggijavri, although the total cpue for all ﬁsh species was higher in vuolit spielgajavri and datkujavri. in biggijavri and vuolit spielgajavri, the sampled arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling were all about the same size except that grayling were slightly larger than whiteﬁsh in vuolit spielgajavri (mann– whitney test: p = 0.003; table 1). the three species differed signiﬁcantly in total length in datkujavri (kruskal–wallis test: p < 0.001), where arctic charr were on average larger than whiteﬁsh and grayling (mann–whitney tests: p < 0.001), and grayling were slightly larger than whiteﬁsh (mann–whitney test: p < 0.001). the total length of arctic charr also differed between the lakes test: p < 0.001) as they were signiﬁcantly larger in dat- kujavri (mann–whitney test: p < 0.001) and vuolit spielgajavri (mann–whitney test: p = 0.002). than in biggijavri (kruskal–wallis arctic charr preferred the littoral and profundal habitats in all lakes, and only few individuals were caught in the pelagic zone (fig. 1). whiteﬁsh used all main habitats and were the only ﬁsh species caught frequently in the pelagic zone. in contrast, grayling were almost exclusively caught in the littoral zone and thus exhibited distinct habitat segregation from whiteﬁsh in all three lakes (fig. 2). arctic charr and 561 biggijavri arctic charr whitefish grayling vuolit spielgajavri datkujavri eloranta et

overlapping habitat utilisation in all three lakes despite a generally more pronounced pelagic habitat use by whiteﬁsh. arctic charr and grayling exhibited overlapping habitat use in big- gijavri, whereas there was clear habitat segregation between these two species in the other lakes. the three ﬁsh species showed clear dietary segre- gation in all three lakes (fig. 2). the highest diet similarity was observed between arctic charr and grayling in biggijavri and vuolit spielgajavri, where they both fed substantially on trichoptera larvae (fig. 3). however, the dietary overlap was not marked as arctic charr also fed substantially on ﬁsh (minnows and burbots) and snails (particularly lymnaea sp.), and partly also on zooplankton. hence, arctic charr trophic niche than grayling and showed a wider whiteﬁsh in biggijavri and vuolit spielgajavri (fig. 3). whiteﬁsh had a distinct pelagic niche with a diet mainly consisting of planktonic cladocerans and copepods. the semi-benthic chydorid e. lamellatus was also an important food for whiteﬁsh, particularly in biggijavri and datkujavri. in all lakes, grayling was rather strictly specialised in littoral prey by consuming mainly trichoptera larvae as well as adult and pupal stages of insects. between-lake differences in habitat use and diet arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling showed similar habitat utilisation in all three

particularly evident in datkujavri where arctic charr had on average 3& higher d15n value compared to the other two ﬁsh species. the results of the siar isotope mixing model broadly corresponded to the habitat and dietary data. in particular, the siar conﬁrmed the distinct niche segregation between whiteﬁsh and grayling by dem- onstrating a strong reliance on pelagic versus littoral food sources, respectively (fig. 5). furthermore, the model revealed clear between-lake differences for arctic charr with littoral benthos dominating in biggijavri and ﬁsh and profundal benthos in vuolit 564 spielgajavri and datkujavri. according to both siar and stomach contents, arctic charr had the most generalist diet in vuolit spielgajavri. the minimum convex polygons in d13c–d15n bi-plot space indicated a wide trophic niche for arctic charr, particularly in biggijavri where the individual isotope values for arctic charr encompass an area over threefold compared to whiteﬁsh or grayling (fig. 6). the convex polygons of the three species were most distinct in datkujavri and most overlapping in vuolit spielgajavri, where arctic charr and whiteﬁsh had only slightly larger niches compared to grayling. in all lakes, most whiteﬁsh had clustered together in a pelagic niche as denoted by their low d13c values, whereas grayling dominated the littoral niche. biggijavri ac = 16.8 wf = 5.4 gr =

segregation and demonstrate a high dietary plasticity of arctic charr, which likely facilitates the coexistence of this species with whiteﬁsh and grayling. arctic charr showed in general the widest trophic niche of the species by feeding on all main types of prey, including littoral benthos, zooplankton and small ﬁsh, the latter never being found in the stomach contents of whiteﬁsh or grayling. whiteﬁsh dominated the pelagic niche by feeding mainly on zooplankton and being the only ﬁsh species caught abundantly in the pelagic zone. grayling was in contrast rather strictly specialised in a littoral niche in all lake systems. despite high niche segrega- tion, the three species may, however, feed on common prey items (e.g., chironomid pupae in springtime) when they are superabundant (robinson & wilson 1998; amundsen et al. 2010). our ﬁndings illustrate a classic interactive segrega- tion between sympatric salmonids (e.g., nilsson 1965; jonsson et al. 2008), which, according to competition theory (gause 1934; pianka 2000), is fundamental for ecologically similar species to prevent extinction of the weaker competitor. here, the trophic niche of arctic charr was conﬁned to benthivory and piscivory, most probably due to an inferior ability to compete for pelagic food resources with the superior whiteﬁsh (e.g., sva¨rdson 1976). whiteﬁsh also largely mono- polised the consumption of the semi-benthic chydorid e. lamellatus commonly utilised by arctic charr in some lakes (adalsteinsson 1979; amundsen et al. 2008). whiteﬁsh is a generalist forager and commonly includes a variety of zoobenthos in its diet (amundsen et al. 2004; harrod et al. 2010), but rarely consumed large benthic invertebrates in the present study lakes. these prey groups were important food sources for arctic charr and particularly for grayling. hence, whiteﬁsh seemed to have a restricted trophic niche, likely resulting from competitive interactions with the other two ﬁsh species. grayling usually forage on surface insects and benthic invertebrates along the shallow lake shores (northcote 1995), but in sympatry with brown_trout, they may shift foraging habitat to deeper areas (haugen & rygg 1996). in our study lakes, there were no clear signs of competitive constraints on grayling as they appeared to utilise their principal littoral niche. a few grayling were caught in the pelagic and profundal habitats, but these individuals had littoral benthos in their stomachs and high d13c values, indicating that they just brieﬂy had left their principal littoral foraging habitat. coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh our study clearly demonstrates that arctic charr can naturally coexist with whiteﬁsh even in shallow lakes with relatively smaller contributions of profundal habitat offering refuge against competitive interactions between the species (cf. sva¨rdson 1976; sandlund et al. 2010). however, a well-developed profundal zone may to some extent explain the higher density of arctic in the deep biggijavri than in the other two shallow lakes. the presence of grayling in the littoral zone apparently facilitates the stable coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh in biggijavri (abrams & ruefﬂer 2009; amundsen et al. 2010), but is apparently important also in the two shallower lakes. in vuolit spielgajavri, grayling was the most abundant species and, by dominating the littoral niche, seemed to relegate whiteﬁsh from the littoral zone into the profundal and pelagic habitat to feed mainly on zooplankton. these competitive constraints on whiteﬁsh probably give arctic charr better possibilities to exploit some littoral and pelagic resources commonly taken over by white- ﬁsh. sandlund et al. (2010) also suggested that the existence of perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) in the littoral zone may restrict the niche use of whiteﬁsh and thereby facilitate survival of sympatric arctic charr. the stable coexistence of arctic charr and whiteﬁsh can also be facilitated by heavy whiteﬁsh exploitation or extensive stocking of arctic charr (gerdeaux et al. 2002; museth et al. 2007), but no considerable ﬁshery or any stocking is occurring in the present study lakes. the largely congruent results of the habitat, stomach contents and stable isotope analyses, and of the present and the previous study from biggijavri (amundsen et al. 2010), suggest a temporally stable niche segre- gation between arctic charr, whiteﬁsh and grayling. although the present study is based on only one ﬁeld sampling period with no information on seasonal variations in the trophic niches (cf. amundsen et al. 2010), our stable isotope estimates from ﬁsh muscle samples provide a time-integrated, indirect measure of resource use covering the last few months before sampling (fry 2006; buchheister & latour 2010). the siar model generally succeeded in interpreting raw stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios into estima- tions of important diet contributions. likewise, the larger individual variation in d13c and d15n values indicated a wider trophic niche (i.e., higher dietary plasticity) for arctic charr compared to sympatric whiteﬁsh and grayling, similar to what was indicated by the stomach content data. the high d15n values and the large contribution of ﬁsh in the stomach contents of arctic charr also demonstrated a strong shift towards piscivory in the two shallow lakes. according to both siar and habitat data, whiteﬁsh relied strongly on pelagic and profundal resources in vuolit spielgajavri, likely due to interspeciﬁc interactions by abundant grayling in the littoral niche. 565 eloranta et al. results, despite the generally congruent there were, however, some mismatches between the siar and stomach content data, likely due to (i) missing food sources or (ii) other uncertainties incorporated in the siar, or simply due to (iii) the different temporal resolutions of the methods. for instance, the siar model could apparently not distinguish well between the contributions of profundal benthos and ﬁsh because of the similar d15n values of these food sources. consequently, based on the siar estimates, arctic charr predominantly fed on pro- fundal benthos in datkujavri, whereas the stomach contents indicated a nearly pure piscivorous diet. however, some piscivorous arctic charr in dat- kujavri may actually have consumed small whiteﬁsh, which have notably lower (i.e., more pelagic) d13c values (ranging from )27.0 to )28.7& in 93- to 150-mm-long whiteﬁsh) compared to the prey ﬁsh used in the siar model (i.e., small littoral minnows and burbots). the estimated contributions of profun- dal benthos and zooplankton in the grayling diet may result from foraging on terrestrial insects, which commonly have lower d13c values than littoral aquatic insects (bennet & hobson 2009). further- more, the stomach contents suggested that whiteﬁsh in vuolit spielgajavri and datkujavri had fed mainly on zooplankton, whereas the siar estimates sug- gested a larger contribution of profundal prey. this difference might result from the fact that the d13c and d15n values largely reﬂect the summertime diet of whiteﬁsh, which commonly consists of benthic prey and chironomid pupae (kahilainen et al. 2004; amundsen et al. 2010) and thus not reﬂect the most recent food utilisation dominated by zooplankton. altogether, the resource partitioning observed from the habitat and prey utilisation of the three salmonid species was largely captured by the siar model. arctic charr is crucial a generalist is known as and opportunistic species with the potential to utilise all kinds of habitats and food sources in a lake (amundsen et al. 2008; eloranta et al. 2010). the dietary plasticity of arctic charr for survival in high-latitude lakes with seasonally ﬂuc- tuating food supplies (johnson 1980), but it also has evolutionary consequences as in some lakes arctic charr may occur as 1–4 sympatric morphs with distinct benthivorous, planktivorous and ⁄ or piscivo- rous niches (klemetsen 2010). arctic charr in our lakes showed no signs of polymorphism, but nevertheless, a high dietary plasticity was observed as they utilised mainly benthic food in the deep biggijavri and shifted to a partially piscivorous niche in the shallower for piscivory in arctic charr is probably an important factor widening the trophic niche and thereby supporting the stable coexistence of arctic charr lakes. the potential 566 and whiteﬁsh in subarctic lakes. in some large and deep lakes in northern finland, large piscivorous arctic charr mainly consume whiteﬁsh and thereby regulate the population size and niche use of this potential competitor (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002). however, no remains of whiteﬁsh were found from the stomach contents of arctic charr from our lakes. the presence of other small prey ﬁsh (i.e., minnows and burbots) presumably supported the piscivorous feeding of arctic charr in these lakes, as also observed in some shallow swedish lakes where arctic charr prey extensively on nine-spined stick- lebacks (pungitius pungitius) (karlsson & bystro¨m 2005). the low catches of small arctic charr in datkujavri could be attributed to cannibalism (bys- tro¨m 2006) or burbot predation (knudsen et al. 2010), although no cannibalism was observed and the burbot catch was low in all three study lakes. the classic competitive in general, exclusion principle (gause 1934; hardin 1960) seems to apply to the interactions between arctic charr and white- ﬁsh, as many native arctic charr populations in northern europe have become extinct or have severely declined after introduction or invasion of whiteﬁsh (nilsson 1965; nilsson & pejler 1973; sva¨rdson 1976). however, in our three study lakes, the two species naturally co-occur in substantial densities because of niche divergence. in large and deep lakes, arctic charr may ﬁnd a suitable niche in the deep profundal habitat (sandlund et al. 2010) and ⁄ or by undergoing an ontogenetic dietary shift to piscivory (kahilainen & lehtonen 2002). however, our study clearly demonstrates that arctic charr does not necessarily need an extensive profundal zone as a refuge against deleterious interactions from white- ﬁsh. this is likely a consequence of the exceptional dietary plasticity of arctic charr enabling adaptation to different trophic niches depending on the avail- ability of habitat and food sources. in conclusion, the ability of arctic charr to widen its trophic niche towards piscivory in the presence of suitable prey ﬁsh, and the presence of a third competing ﬁsh species like grayling in the littoral zone evidently facilitates the coexistence of arctic charr with the commonly competitively superior whiteﬁsh. acknowledgements we thank laina dalsbø, cesilie lien, anne kettunen, kim præbel and grethe robertsen for assistance in the ﬁeld and laboratory work. roger i.
