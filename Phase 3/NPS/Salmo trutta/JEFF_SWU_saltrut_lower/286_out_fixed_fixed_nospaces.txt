e-mail: rstuarts@utas.edu.au accepted for publication june 23, 2006 introduction whether they are nocturnal, diurnal or crepuscular, most ﬁshes exhibit a distinct diel pattern in feeding (fraser et al. 1993; bra¨nna¨s & alana¨ra¨ 1997; fraser & metcalfe 1997). the potential causes of such patterns are complicated and may include factors such as prey availability (glova et al. 1987), preda- tion risk (metcalfe et al. 1999), potential for intra- or interspeciﬁc competition (keast & welsh 1968), capabilities of each ﬁsh species (e.g., dependence on vision for locating prey: forrester et al. 1994; kreivi et al. 1999) or a range of seasonal effects, (e.g., temperature and day length: riehle & grifﬁth 1993; fraser et al. 1995). many of these are also interdependent. studying the diel feeding pattern of a ﬁsh species can thus suggest a lot about its ecology and provides the foundation for estimating the amount of food it consumes daily. there are some cases where the feeding of a ﬁsh species has both diurnal and nocturnal peaks (e.g., rock bass, ambloplites rupestris; keast & welsh 1968). for ﬁshes that occur in high densities (or when food is limited) this may be caused by temporal partitioning of feeding: in order to reduce the effects of intraspeciﬁc competition, some individuals feed noc- turnally and some diurnally (bra¨nna¨s & alana¨ra 1997). this partitioning may be size-structured and brought about by social interactions, where only the larger, more dominant individuals feed at the most preferred time of day (‘preferred’ in terms of the trade- off between optimising foraging efﬁciency and avoid- ing predators sensu lima & dill 1990). members of the galaxiidae form an important component of the native freshwater ﬁsh fauna in temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, yet diel feeding patterns are unknown for most species. the lotic galaxiids of new zealand have been the best studied in this respect, and many are nocturnal foragers (glova & sagar 1989a,b). galaxias auratus (johnston) is a lentic tasmanian galaxiid that has co- existed with introduced brown_trout (salmo_trutta doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00192.x 521 stuart-smith et al. linnaeus) in lakes crescent and sorell, to which it is endemic, since 1868 and still remains in very high densities. little is known, however, of its ecology. it is believed that the activity of this species is greater at night, but its diel feeding pattern is unknown (hardie et al. 2006). we hypothesised that g. auratus would also be a nocturnal forager both because of the prevailing evidence from new zealand congeners and because the potential selective pressures imposed by brown_trout (the major predator of g. auratus) would foster feeding in low light conditions. thus, the primary objective of this study was to examine the diel feeding pattern of this lentic galaxiid. the potential size-based temporal partitioning of feeding was also examined in relation to the observed feeding patterns. for when the diel feeding pattern is known, daily ration (or daily food intake) can be estimated with greatest accuracy (darnell & meierotto 1962; mann 1978; madon 1998). if samples of stomach contents have been collected in the ﬁeld and the nature of gastric evacuation is known, daily ration can be estimated using a number of existing models, the most commonly used being those of elliot & persson (1978) and eggers (1977) (boisclair & marchand 1993; speczia´r 2002). despite the importance of galaxiids in temperate southern hemisphere fresh- water systems, there are no published estimates of daily ration for any species. a secondary objective of this study was to use the diel feeding data in conjunction with an estimate of the rate of gastric evacuation to estimate daily ration. methods study species and site it galaxias auratus is a relatively large galaxiid [max total length (tl) approx. 240 mm, but more com- monly to 140 mm], which is endemic to the intercon- nected lakes crescent and sorell on the tasmanian central plateau (c. 42°5¢s; 147°10¢e). is an opportunistic feeder, with adults eating a variety of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, but most often consuming epibenthic crustaceans and insect larvae and plankton when available (hardie et al. 2004). brown_trout are also abundant in these lakes, which also contain smaller numbers of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss walbaum), short-ﬁnned eel (anguilla australis richardson) and common carp (cyprinus carpio l.). the brown_trout prey heavily on g. auratus, although their efﬁciency appears to have been reduced since the mid-1990s, when both lakes became highly turbid (uytendaal 2003) and g. auratus presumably became harder to locate and capture (stuart-smith et al. 2004). 522 galaxias auratus is listed as ‘rare’ under the tasmanian threatened species protection act 1995 the national environment and ‘vulnerable’ under protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 due to its restricted distribution, yet within these lakes it occurs in arguably the highest densities of any of tasmania’s lentic galaxiids. although lakes crescent and sorell are relatively large (23.1 and 51.6 km2, respectively), they are shallow (2.3 and 3.1 m average depth, respectively) and there are estimated to be in excess of 2 million and 0.5 million g. auratus in lakes crescent and sorell, respectively (a. uytendaal, unpublished data). diel feeding patterns (model 12-b; smith-root galaxias auratus were captured using a backpack electroﬁshing unit inc., vancouver, washington, usa) at 3-h intervals for 24 h. a replicate sample was taken exactly 24 h from the ﬁrst. this was done on three occasions over summer 2002–2003, with two of these from lake crescent (11–12 december 2002 and 6–7 february 2003) and one from lake sorell (13–14 february 2003). the study was conducted in both lakes crescent and sorell in case the feeding pattern of g. auratus was affected by differences in their own populations, or trout or prey populations between the lakes. on each occasion, a suitable stretch of shoreline consisting of uniform cobble rock habitat was chosen and divided into nine shorter stretches, each to be sampled once in that day. immediately after capture, the ﬁsh were killed )1), weighed, by overdosing in benzocaine (300 mgæl measured (tl) and preserved in 4% formalin with their abdominal cavity slit open. the water temperature was measured at the time and place of each sample. (afdw) was estimated for stomachs were dissected from ﬁsh and contents were removed. each prey taxon was identiﬁed at least to genus, and the relative proportion of volume made up by each was estimated. stomach contents were then dried (60 °c > 48 h) and weighed (to 0.1 mg) using a mettler ae 100 (mettler toledo, columbus, o.h., usa) analytical balance. a subsample of contents from 40 stomachs was ashed (540 °c > 24 h) and ash- free dry weight the remainder of stomach contents using the relationship between afdw and dry weight (dw) of stomach contents in the subsample (linear regression, afdw ¼ 0.8324 · dw + 0.0007, p < 0.001, n ¼ 40). to calculate the dw of whole ﬁsh minus their stomach contents, the emptied stomachs were returned to the abdominal cavity of the ﬁsh, which were then also dried (60 °c > 96 h) and weighed. for graphical purposes and use in daily ration estimation, the relative stomach contents weight (ft) was also calculated for ﬁsh captured each time using equation (1): r2 ¼ 0.99, ft ¼ gt dt  1000 ; ð1þ is the weight of where gt the stomach contents (mg dw) and dt is the dw (g) of a ﬁsh captured at time t. stomach contents afdw were log transformed to homogenise variances and compared between times of day by one-way analysis of covariance (ancova) with loge(ﬁsh dw) as the covariate. the positive relation- ships between transformed ﬁsh weights and stomach content weights were similar for all times on all days, satisfying the ancova assumption of homogeneity of slopes. any differences in ﬁsh sizes are thus unlikely to affect interpretation of results. where signiﬁcant differences across the nine samples were identiﬁed, tukey’s post hoc test was used to determine which pairs of times differed. in addition to analysis of the amount of food in the stomach, estimates of con- sumption during each of the 3-h intervals were also used to determine the diel feeding pattern of g. auratus. these were based on the model of elliot & persson (1978) (equation 2, below). trellis plots, as implemented in the lattice package of r (sarkar 2005), were used to examine whether there was any evidence of size-based temporal partitioning in feeding. on each sample date, the ﬁsh were split into six slightly overlapping size classes (i.e., ‘shingles’ sensu cleveland 1994) with equal numbers of ﬁsh in each size class, and ft was plotted against time. any trends were visualised using a loess smoother. if size-based partitioning occurred, we expected that these plots would show different trends over time for small and large ﬁsh. epibenthic prey in lotic times of invertebrates samples of epibenthic invertebrate prey were also taken with ﬁsh samples with the aim of detecting if diel changes in prey positioning resulted in changes in abundance of prey that may be available to the ﬁsh at the day, a phenomenon well different documented (cowan & peckarsky 1994; mcintosh & townsend 1994). immediately before electroﬁshing each stretch of shoreline, prey were sampled using a suction sampler, with three randomly located quadrats of 576 cm2 sampled in each stretch. this method samples prey from exposed surfaces of the substrate, so it probably more closely represents prey that were available to the ﬁsh than other sampling methods which sample interstitial and other subsurface habitats (e.g., cores or grabs). prey samples were preserved in 80% ethanol and later identiﬁed to a minimum of genus level and enumerated in the laboratory using a dissecting microscope. the densities of the amphipod, austro- nocturnal and diurnal feeding by galaxias auratus chiltonia australis on 6–7 february 2003 were estimated by subsampling because of the particularly large numbers of this species. precision of estimates based on subsampling ranged up to ±23%, but for most samples was approximately ±15%. the diet of the ﬁsh was very low in diversity, with a single prey taxon forming the bulk of stomach contents on each day (table 1). only the amphipod austrochiltonia australis and the gastropod austro- pyrgus sp. were used in analyses as these were the most dominant epibenthic prey found in stomach contents. the densities of each in the environment at each sample time were analysed for correlation with their mean relative proportion in stomach contents of those times. densities of austrochiltonia ﬁsh at australis on 11–12 december 2002 were log trans- formed as they differed by more than an order of magnitude between times. gastric evacuation the rates at which prey are evacuated from the stomach of g. auratus were determined under controlled laboratory conditions. due to the domin- ance of austrochiltonia australis and daphnia carinata in the diets of ﬁeld-sampled ﬁsh on different days (table 1), two experiments were conducted, one with each prey species. water temperature inﬂuences the rate of gastric evacuation (elliot 1972; dos santos & jobling 1991; andersen 1999), so as the purpose of the gastric evacuation experiments was to allow estimation of daily ration on different days, experiments were run at the mean temperatures recorded on the days on which these prey were dominant (11.5 °c for austrochiltonia australis and 16.5 °c for d. carinata). otherwise, both experi- ments followed the same protocol. fish were captured in lake crescent by electroﬁsh- er (n ¼ 54, mean tl ¼ 103 mm, range 84–144 mm) and maintained in the laboratory in two large holding tanks (approx. 350 l) for a minimum of 2 weeks to allow them to acclimate. at the beginning of a trial, they were placed in individual, food-free tanks (350 · 210 · 260 mm) for 48 h. a known number of prey was introduced and the ﬁsh were allowed to feed for 3 h. fish were then transferred into new tanks without any prey and the number of remaining prey was counted. the dw of prey consumed by each ﬁsh was estimated from linear regression of number and dw of each prey species (austrochiltonia australis: loge(dw) ¼ )0.9182 + 1.0362 loge (number), r2 ¼ 0.95, p < 0.001, n ¼ 20; d. carinata: loge(dw) ¼ r2 ¼ 0.93, p < )1.8949 + 0.9860 loge 0.001, n ¼ 20). fish were killed at each of a series of predetermined intervals after the feeding period and the ﬁsh and remaining stomach contents were dried (number), 523 table 1. times of ﬁsh sampling, sample and ﬁsh sizes and %volume of dominant prey found in stomachs of galaxias auratus sampled from lake crescent (11–12 december 2002 and 6–7 febru- ary 2003) and lake sorell (13–14 february 2003). stuart-smith et al. date 11 december 2002 12 december 2002 6 february 2003 7 february 2003 13 february 2003 14 february 2003 time 15:15 18:15 21:15 00:15 03:15 06:15 09:15 12:15 15:15 09:15 12:15 15:15 18:15 21:15 00:15 03:15 06:15 09:15 09:15 12:15 15:15 18:15 21:15 00:15 03:15 06:15 09:15 n 27 29 28 27 23 27 26 26 25 21 20 21 21 17 7 10 24 28 21 20 18 20 20 20 22 24 21 mean total length (range) % austrochiltonia australis % daphnia carinata % austropyrgus 103 (83–123) 104 (79–143) 103 (81–145) 101 (84–124) 107 (82–166) 106 (89–136) 100 (80–131) 104 (81–132) 100 (82–128) 91 (76–112) 95 (85–116) 93 (82–114) 88 (78–101) 89 (79–111) 89 (81–100) 95 (88–114) 93 (84–113) 91 (78–123) 98 (87–120) 99 (81–147) 98 (86–136) 95 (80–144) 94 (76–117) 97 (81–134) 96 (78–120) 99 (81–149) 97 (82–130) 40.85 93.57 88.73 83.71 63.48 83.53 98.34 97.44 82.03 25.32 20.06 48.34 20.63 8.02 30.12 28.89 34.45 27.21 0 2.68 2.42 0.26 0.28 10.88 1.75 2.36 6.87 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 73.55 77.33 51.01 70.16 91.83 69.28 71.11 65.55 69.36 99.24 97.32 97.58 99.48 99.44 83.08 98.00 97.41 91.66 45.10 5.63 0 5.09 20.89 14.46 0.30 0 16.41 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.28 0 0 0 0 and weighed separately, following the same proce- dures and equipment as for the ﬁeld-sampled ﬁsh. regression analysis was used to identify the best model to describe the evacuation of austrochiltonia australis and d. carinata from the stomach of g. auratus and for estimation of the rate parameter r, which was required for the elliot & persson and eggers models. we used nonlinear regression, rather than linear regression on transformed variables, so that the best model could be chosen and comparisons could be made based on r2 and se values (elashoff et al. 1982; bromley 1994). daily ration it is widely reported that the elliot & persson model usually provides accurate estimates of consumption (hayward 1991; he´roux & magnan 1996; speczia´r 2002), but it is subject to two major sources of error. the ﬁrst is that as it is based on differences in mean relative stomach content weights between sample times, and does not account for variation about these means, or when data are not normally distributed or do not satisfy parametric assumptions. some researchers have used geometric means or medians rather than arithmetic means because of this (amundsen & klemetsen 1986; parrish & margraf 1990). the second is that there is error associated with the measurement of the gastric evacuation rate (r), which is not accounted for. many studies have completely neglected this. 524 in our study, estimates of consumption based on the elliot & persson model (ci) for each 3-h interval were made using the bootstrap method, which allowed the error associated with both ft and r to be estimated (trudel & boisclair 1993). transformed (arcsine ö) ft values from each time period were sampled 5000 times with replacement and means from each were back-transformed. each of the 5000 back-transformed means (multiplied by 100 to convert to %dw of ﬁsh) (ft *) was then used in the elliot & persson model: i ¼ c ðf  ðtþ1þ   f  t e rtþrt 1   e rt ; ð2þ * and f* * estimates the where ci is the mean of the 5000 ci consumption during the interval i (always 3 h in this study) expressed as %dw of ﬁsh, ft (t+1) are mean back-transformed relative stomach content weights (%) at two successive sampling times, and r* is a bootstrap estimate of the evacuation rate. values of r* were generated using equation (3): ð3þ r ¼ r þ ðser  rnþ; where ser is the standard error of r, and rn is a normally distributed random number with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (trudel & boisclair 1993). values of r and ser were estimated from the nonlinear regressions of gastric evacuation (i.e., of austrochiltonia australis for 11–12 december 2002, and of d. carinata in calculations for 6–7 and 13–14 february 2003). using hall’s basic method, 95% conﬁdence intervals of bootstrap estimates were calculated (davison & hinkley 1997). these analyses were conducted in the package ‘boot’ (canty & ripley 2005) in r version 2.2.0 (r development core team 2005). (5000 permutations) daily ration using the elliot & persson model is equal to the sum of ci for each day. the bootstrap method was also employed to estimate daily ration using the eggers model (c24), with re-sampling of transformed ft values and combining the back-transformed means (%) with appropriate r* values in equation (4): ð4þ c24 ¼ f   r  24; where c24 is the daily ration expressed as %dw of ﬁsh and f* is the mean of all ft * for that day. the correction method of eggers (1979) was not used as ft values did not differ signiﬁcantly between replicate samples at the same time 24 h apart on any day (anova: 11–12 december: f1,50 ¼ 0.001, p ¼ 0.971; 6–7 february: f1,47 ¼ 1.279, p ¼ 0.264; 13–14 feb- ruary: f1,40 ¼ 0.098, p ¼ 0.756). results diel feeding pattern on the day following only four empty stomachs were found in 593 ﬁsh sampled, and afdw of stomach contents were consistently high and variable. differences in afdw between times on any of the days sampled were not signiﬁcant, with the exception of the sample at 18:15 hours on 6 february 2003, in which stomach contents weights were signiﬁcantly lower than sam- ples at 12:15, 15:15 and 00:15, 03:15 hours and at (ancova: 09:15 hours f8,159 ¼ 2.153, p ¼ 0.034). estimates of consump- tion in each of the time intervals revealed feeding during both day and night, but did differ signiﬁcantly between some sample times, as indicated by nonover- lapping conﬁdence intervals (fig. 1). the greatest feeding occurred between 15:15–18:15 and 00:15– 03:15 hours on 11–12 december 2002, and 18:15– 00:15 hours on 6–7 february 2003. feeding was more consistent in lake sorell on 13–14 february. there were also periods in which elliot & persson estimates were negative. however, conﬁdence intervals of all of these overlapped zero. these were between 15:15– 18:15 and 00:15–03:15 hours on 6–7 february 2003, and 03:15–06:15 hours on 13–14 february 2003 (fig. 1). although feeding occurred during both the day and night, this was not the result of different sized ﬁsh feeding at different times, i.e., there was no evidence of any size-based differences or temporal partitioning nocturnal and diurnal feeding by galaxias auratus of feeding. visual inspection of the trellis plots of relative stomach contents weights from different size classes of ﬁsh (fig. a1) revealed no differences in trends over the day on any of the sampling dates. there were also no signiﬁcant differences in the size (tl) of ﬁsh captured at each time on any day (anova: 11–12 december: f8,229 ¼ 0.641, p ¼ 0.743; 6–7 february: f8,160 ¼ 1.680, p ¼ 0.107; 13–14 febru- ary: f8,177 ¼ 0.312, p ¼ 0.961). epibenthic prey austrochiltonia australis dominated both stomach contents and epibenthic prey samples on 11–12 december 2002. there was a strong, positive linear relationship between the proportion of austrochiltonia australis in stomachs of g. auratus and its densities in environmental samples on this day (pearson correla- tion coefﬁcient, r ¼ 0.76), with peaks early in the night and early in the day (fig. 2). there were no correlations between stomach contents and the densi- ties of austropyrgus sp. on this day despite the fact that this species increased in proportion in stomach contents late in the day and late in the night. there were no correlations between stomach contents and the densities of either prey on the 6–7 and 13–14 february 2003 (all |r| < 0.13). gastric evacuation the evacuation of both austrochiltonia australis and d. carinata from the stomach of g. auratus followed a curvilinear decay with time (fig. 3). a simple expo- nential model yielded the greatest r2 and smallest se for both prey species (equation 5): ð5þ mt ¼ m0e rt; where mt is the amount of prey remaining in the stomach at time t (mg dw) and m0 is the initial meal size (mg dw). daily ration )1æday )1æ day daily ration estimates ranged from 2.2% dw (0.43 )1, eggers model, 6–7 february gæ100 gæwet wt )1, 2003) to 3.9% dw (0.76 gæ100 gæwet wt eggers model, 11–12 december 2002) (fig. 4), with the overall mean close to 3%. this equates to around 118 amphipods (austrochiltonia australis) or 406 daphnia carinata for a ﬁsh of the average sampled size (1.87 g dw, 98 mm tl). eggers and elliot & persson estimates differed by almost 1% on 6–7 february 2003, but this was not statistically signiﬁ- cant, and estimates on other days were more similar. elliot & persson estimates were almost identical for all 3 days. although not statistically signiﬁcant, the 525 stuart-smith et al. ) % ( t f ) % ( t f 5 4 3 2 1 0 5 4 3 2 1 0 5 4

plots with raw data overlaid as open circles. consumption estimates are bootstrap estimates of mean values + 95% conﬁdence intervals. horizontal black bars represent hours of darkness. highest estimates were on 11–12 december 2002, despite the water temperature being considerably cooler on this day (mean 11.5 °c as opposed to mean 16.5 °c on the other 2 days). discussion both analysis of stomach content weights and the estimation of consumption using the elliot & persson model show that there were no signiﬁcant peaks in feeding by g. auratus and that they fed rather consistently during both night and day on all the dates sampled and in both lakes. thus, the hypothesis that they feed primarily at night was not supported by our ﬁndings. feeding appeared to be more consistent throughout the 24-h day in ﬁsh sampled from lake sorell, but this does not alter the conclusions of the study, with g. auratus still observed feeding during day, night and twilight periods. although the varia- bility in stomach content weights was high, this is characteristic of ﬁsh feeding (jenkins & green 1977; grant & kott 1999; hartman 2000), and, in the these data were context of other similar studies, remarkably free of the problems emphasised by amundsen & klemetsen (1986): weights of stomach contents were not skewed, nor were there many empty 526 h c a m o t s n i n o i t t o p

(e.g., brodeur & pearcy 1987; johnson & dropkin 1995; madon 1998). one of the assumptions of the elliot & persson model is that feeding is continuous during each 3-h interval (elliot & persson 1978). failure to satisfy this assumption can lead to errors in estimates of consumption and possibly negative estimates during intervals in which consumption is low and not continuous. by keeping the sampling interval short (£3 h, elliot & persson 1978; corte´s 1997), and because the diet was ‘ﬁne-grained’ (large numbers of small food particles, cochran & adelman 1982), the likelihood of violating this assumption was minimised. however, this assumption may still be violated when ﬁsh are feeding close to satiation (elliot & persson 1978; cochran & adelman 1982; persson 1983). as there were very few empty stomachs found in g. auratus and stomach content weights were consis- tently high, it is possible that they were feeding close to satiation, and therefore, in an inconsistent manner. elliot & persson (1978) experimentally tested the effects of violating this assumption and found that nocturnal and diurnal feeding by galaxias auratus ) % ( n o i t a r y l i a d 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 dec 11 feb 6

even in extreme cases (a ﬁsh feeding for only 20 min every 3 h) their model still provided good estimates of actual consumption when the interval was 3 h, but that when there were differences between estimates and actual consumption, the estimates were normally slightly lower than actual consumption. thus, even if the assumption of continuous feeding was not satisﬁed in our study, the resulting estimates are unlikely to differ considerably from the real consumption of g. auratus; but if at all, they may be slight underes- timates. this may help explain those estimates that were low (some negative but with 95% ci overlapping zero). feeding of g. auratus was consistent and was not signiﬁcantly greater during night, day or twilight periods. although this pattern has occasionally been seen in other species (e.g., coho salmon, oncorhyn- chus kisutch: ruggerone 1989, and brook charr, fig. 3. evacuation of austrochiltonia aus- tralis (left) and daphnia carinata (right) from the

salvelinus_fontinalis: he´roux & magnan 1996) it is unusual amongst ﬁsh (fraser et al. 1993; fraser & metcalfe 1997). although mcintosh & townsend (1995) found that galaxias vulgaris (the common river galaxias) foraged both nocturnally and diurnally, most galaxiid species have been reported to be nocturnal foragers (cadwallader 1975; glova & sagar 1989a,b; mcdowall 1990) and there is evidence that activity and movement of this species is also greater at night. diel surveys of g. auratus in a recently translocated population in a trout-free, clear-water dam (hardie suggested that g. auratus spends more time in the cover of complex habitats such as macrophytes during the day, and then moves about in search of food at night. this was supported by preliminary electroﬁshing for this study, which indicated that numbers of g. auratus in areas of uniform silt substrate were low throughout the day but increased at night. interestingly, mcintosh & town- send (1995) recorded this type of activity/habitat use pattern for g. vulgaris even though this species also feeds during the day. they found that g. vulgaris spent most of the daylight hours in cover, emerging only to capture prey, but actively moved about in search of food during the night. although further research is needed to establish whether the proposed diel activity/habitat use pattern of g. auratus persists in the presence of brown_trout, it appears that like g. vulgaris, g. auratus still captures prey during times in which it uses complex habitats. this may be due either to a change in feeding strategy from ambush or sit-and-wait foraging from the edge of complex habitats during the day, to actively searching for prey at night, or to the ability to search for, and capture prey amongst the complex habitat. the latter may be realistic in habitats such as macrophytes, because the ability to feed at night suggests that this species is capable of locating and capturing prey using nonvisual stimuli, which would also be advantageous in habitats that reduce or break up the visual ﬁeld. this ability also suggests that the current high turbidity of lakes crescent and sorell may not negatively affect their feeding ability. another reason that we hypothesised that g. auratus would show a nocturnal peak in foraging is because the risk of predation by brown_trout is also likely to differ during the diel cycle. brown_trout are primarily visual predators; although they are capable of nocturnal foraging, they present the greatest preda- tion threat from dawn through to dusk (allan 1978; ringler 1979). brown_trout were introduced into lakes crescent and sorell in 1868 and it is possible that they have provided a selective pressure for g. auratus to forage nocturnally. while this study cannot determine inﬂuence habitat use by g. whether brown_trout auratus, however, threat of it does appear that 528 predation by brown_trout has not nocturnally biased feeding pattern by g. auratus. resulted in a diel patterns in prey availability are also known to inﬂuence feeding patterns of ﬁshes, and have been implicated in causing the nocturnal peaks in the feeding of other galaxiids (glova & sagar 1989a,b). prey availability in our study was consistently high throughout the day and night and we suggest that it did not inﬂuence the feeding pattern of g. auratus. the evidence for this includes the presence of very few empty stomachs, very high densities of sampled epibenthic invertebrates (the mean density of austro- )2 and austropyrgus chiltonia australis was 13,300 m )2), and the observation of very large, dense sp., 264 m swarms of daphnia carinata during all ﬁsh sampling periods on the 6–7 and 13–14 february 2003. unfor- tunately daphnia carinata were not quantitatively sampled as a part of this study due to the absence of planktonic prey in the diet of g. auratus in preliminary samples and the added logistical considerations of attempting to quantitatively and efﬁciently sample an invertebrate with such a patchy distribution. feeding during both day and night may be caused by intraspeciﬁc interactions. size is the most com- monly recorded determinant of social structure in ﬁshes (danylchuk & tonn 2001; whiteman & cote 2004), and size-based resource partitioning has been reported in other galaxiids (whitehead et al. 2002; david & stoffels 2003). although, we could not test explicitly for differences in feeding patterns of individuals in this study because we did not sample the same individual ﬁsh at each time of day, there was no evidence of size-based differences in feeding when we examined the amount of food in the stomach throughout the day in different sized individuals within the range of sizes sampled. eos · p. the gastric evacuation rates and daily ration estimates of g. auratus are slightly lower than, but still similar to other similar sized lentic ﬁshes from studies undertaken in the northern hemisphere (persson 1982; boisclair & leggett 1988). interest- ingly, even though consumption by g. auratus may be a little less than other planktivorous ﬁsh (e.g., dace, phoxinus neogaeus: trudel & boisclair 1993; gauthier & boisclair 1997), adult g. auratus may still consume around 400 daphnia carinata per day. daphnia carinata are relatively large zooplankters (up to 6 mm), and are probably the dominant algal grazers in lakes crescent and sorell (uytendaal 2003). thus, the predation pressure exerted by such high densities of g. auratus on d. carinata may possibly have a strong inﬂuence on algal biomass in these lakes. there has been a growing number of studies that have demonstrated such abilities of ﬁshes to exert top-down control on lower trophic levels through trophic cascades (he & wright 1992; karjalainen et al. 1999; zambrano et al. 2001). this study has not only provided an unusual example of a ﬁsh that feeds throughout both night and day, but has also provided empirical data on the predatory capabilities of a galaxiid ﬁsh, which offer insight into their role as predators in southern hemisphere freshwater systems. acknowledgements the authors wish to thank jemina stuart-smith,
