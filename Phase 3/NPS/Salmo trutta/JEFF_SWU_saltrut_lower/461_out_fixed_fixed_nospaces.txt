gowan & fausch 2002; albanese et al. 2004; petty & grossman 2004; gowan 2007; roberts & angermeier 2007). longer, migratory movements provide access to patchily distributed feeding, breed- ing and refuge resources needed over life history (winn 1958; welcomme 1979; matheney & rabeni 1995). infrequent, long-distance dispersal movements enable the exchange of genes, colonists and surplus individuals between ﬁsh populations (schlosser 1995; schlosser & angermeier 1995). our understanding of the frequency and extent of stream-ﬁsh movement is limited, especially for non- salmonid taxa. existing studies have focused, often unintentionally, on small-scale, habitat-tracking move- ments. our understanding of large-scale, migration and dispersal movements is therefore particularly poor. our progress has been hampered by the logistical difﬁculty of executing movement studies spatiotem- porally extensive enough to observe large-scale movements (gowan et al. 1994; albanese et al. 2003), the limited options available for tagging small ﬁshes (roberts & angermeier 2004), and the legacy of 374 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00288.x the paradigm that the population dynamics of stream ﬁshes (gerking 1953; grossman et al. 1982). factors control ‘local-site’ movement studies indicate that some nonsalmonid stream ﬁshes exhibit generally high ﬁdelity to meso- habitat patches within life-stages (gerking 1953; funk 1955; stott 1967; hill & grossman 1987; smithson & johnston 1999), whereas others are nomadic (stott 1967; hoyt & kruskamp 1982; linﬁeld 1985). stream ﬁshes movement studies also show that sometimes make extensive (e.g., stream- to wa- tershed-scale) movements (gorman 1986; todd & rabeni 1989; matheny & rabeni 1995; albanese 2001), though most mark–recapture studies are not designed to detect such movements. there is also strong indirect evidence that stream ﬁshes move extensively: ﬁsh can quickly re-colonise depopulated streams (peterson & bayley 1993; ensign et al. 1997; albanese 2001) and may spread rapidly through non- native streams when introduced there (denoncourt et al. 1975; buchanan & stevenson 2003; neely & george 2006). movements of darters (percidae: etheostomatini) appear to follow these same general patterns (winn 1958; reed 1968; freeman 1995; schaefer et al. 2003; roberts & angermeier 2007), but movement studies of darters are sparse. more knowledge of darter movement would enhance our basic understanding of population structure and persistence, as well as inform conservation strategies for this highly imperiled group. this paper describes our study of movements of the endangered roanoke logperch (percina rex), a benthic darter, in the roanoke river, virginia, usa. we use these data to draw inferences about the small- and large-scale movements of the species. materials and methods study species and area the roanoke logperch is a benthic darter endemic to the roanoke and chowan river drainages of virginia, where it occupies several medium to large streams in the ridge and valley, piedmont and upper coastal plain physiographic regions (jenkins & burkhead 1994). roanoke logperch utilise a variety of habitat conﬁgurations over their life history, but at all stages are intolerant of heavy silt deposition (jenkins & burkhead 1994; rosenberger & angermeier 2003). after emergence, age-0 individuals occupy pool margins (roberts & angermeier 2006) and backwaters (rosenberger & angermeier 2003). maturation occurs at age 1 or 2, and spawning takes place in spring in swift run mesohabitats (jenkins & burkhead 1994). fish one or more years of age forage and over-winter in rifﬂes, runs and ﬂowing pools (rosenberger & roanoke logperch movement angermeier 2002). roanoke logperch can live up to 6 years and reach a total length (tl) of around 160 mm (jenkins & burkhead 1994). the species has presumably suffered dramatic range reductions, be- cause of anthropogenic reductions of silt-free habitats, and was therefore listed as endangered under the u.s. endangered species act in 1989 (u.s. federal register 54:34468-34472). the upper roanoke river (upstream of smith mountain reservoir) is an unregulated, sixth-order stream containing series of rifﬂe, run and pool meso- habitats (fig. 1). roanoke logperch occupy the main- stem roanoke river and downstream portions of two large tributaries (north fork and south fork roanoke river; jenkins & burkhead 1994). therein, large juvenile and adult ﬁsh are mostly restricted to rifﬂe– run sequences, where they reach their highest range-wide population densities (rosenberger 2007).

separate suitable rifﬂe–runs by 1 km or more. within rifﬂe– runs, ﬁsh typically select deeper, swifter microhab- itats with larger, less-silted substrate (ensign & angermeier 1994; rosenberger & angermeier 2003). we have observed that the spatial locations of such microhabitats within roanoke river rifﬂe– runs change little over time (roberts & angermeier 2006). this observation suggests that roanoke logperch might exhibit ﬁdelity to small areas within rifﬂe–runs. study design for a concurrent monitoring study of roanoke logperch, 12 sampling sites were established along a 23-km-long segment of the roanoke river (fig. 1; roberts & angermeier 2006). mason creek, which historically contained roanoke logperch, enters the roanoke river within the study segment; however, we presume that the tributary functioned as neither a source nor destination of roanoke logperch because recent surveys have failed to capture the species there (rosenberger 2007). each sampling site comprised a discrete rifﬂe–run complex and averaged 23 m in width (range 14–34 m) and 120 m in length (range 55–160 m). the average distance between neighbour- ing sites was 2.1 km (range 0.6–3.7 km). unsampled, intervening reaches contained various habitat types, including rifﬂe–runs and pools. no obvious physical barriers separated sites, except for bridge culverts between sites 2 and 3 and sites 3 and 4 and a 1-m-tall dam between sites 4 and 5 (fig. 1). we divided each site into a series of permanent, 15-m-long sampling transects (4–11 per site). transect width ran the width of the stream. during each ﬁsh-sampling occasion, transects were sampled by backpack electroﬁshing a 4- m-wide by 10-m-long area (i.e., quadrat) immediately upstream of a stationary 5-mm-mesh bag seine. we sampled as many nonoverlapping quadrats as would ﬁt across a transect’s width. this is an effective method for collecting adult and large juvenile roanoke logperch in the roanoke river (ensign & angermeier 1994; roberts & angermeier 2006). with a few exceptions, all 12 sites were sampled twice annually between 1998 and 2006, after the spawning season: once in summer (29 june–31 august) and once in autumn (1 september–31 october) (table 1). omissions resulted from high- streamﬂow periods that prevented sampling of all sites in a given sampling season, and were haphazard with respect to site identity. within this study design, we used mark–recapture methods to determine spatiotemporal movement pat- terns of roanoke logperch. although the long, unsampled reaches separating sites and long temporal intervals between sampling occasions were not ideal for characterising the full distribution of ﬁsh move- ments, we reasoned that the spatiotemporal extensive- ness of the study would provide us a unique opportunity to observe movement over larger scales sampling year sampling season number of sites sampled mark type number of ﬁsh marked number of ﬁsh recaptured from (recapture rate) number of

marked in a particular sampling interval that were subsequently recaptured. 376 than most study designs allow. during each sampling event from summer 1998 to autumn 2003, all captured roanoke logperch that had no existing tag were anaesthetised with ms-222, given a unique tag using two injectable ﬂuorescent marks of varying colour and body location, and, following recovery from anaes- thesia, were released into a low-velocity area within the transect of capture. we recorded the capture location (transect and site), conﬁguration of marks, age group (0 vs. 1+), and, beginning in 2000, sex of marked and recaptured individuals. in 1998 and 2001– 2003, we marked ﬁsh using visible implant elastomer (vie; northwest marine technology, inc., shaw island, washington, usa), which exhibited >95% retention and no mortality in 21 individuals of closelyrelated northern logperch (percina caprodes) in a 428-day-long laboratory trial (rosenberger & angermeier 2002). in 1999 and 2000, we used injectable photonic dye (ipd; new west technology, inc., arcata, california, usa) in the ﬁeld study, but because of its apparent poor retention (see results), returned to using vie in 2001. marking was discon- tinued after 2003, but in sampling events between summer 2004 and autumn 2006, we continued to anaesthetise all captured roanoke logperch, check them for marks and record information as above. data analysis using recapture data, we characterised general patterns of within- and between-site movement and speciﬁcally asked whether roanoke logperch exhibited ﬁdelity to their initial marking locations within sites. for anal- ysis, we assumed that the net displacement distance of a ﬁsh between its initial marking and subsequent recapture locations represented the total distance the ﬁsh had moved over that time interval. we measured this distance as the distance between the midpoints of marking and recapture transects; individuals captured twice in the same transect exhibited a movement distance of 0 m (i.e., nonmovement), individuals recaptured one transect away from the one in which they were marked exhibited a movement distance of 15 m, and so forth. the same distance- assignment scheme was applied to between-site movements. this approach provided only a minimum estimate of the potential distance moved, as it did not account for complex, exploratory movements (e.g., matheney & rabeni 1995). thus, a more serious limitation of our study design was the reduced ability to detect movements relative to nonmovements. mobile marked ﬁsh could escape recapture by moving into unsampled areas within sites or unsampled reaches outside of sites. as a result, our estimates both of movement rate (i.e., the proportion of recaptured individuals that exhibited movement) roanoke logperch movement and of average distance moved were likely biased downward. such sampling bias is pervasive in mark– recapture studies, and is an oft-cited explanation for the longstanding ‘restricted movement paradigm’ of stream ﬁsh movement (gowan et al. 1994). we therefore interpreted observed movement patterns in light of this potential bias. we also explicitly accounted for our sampling bias when analysing within-site movement. our rationale was as follows: if ﬁsh exhibit no ﬁdelity to particular areas (i.e., are nomadic) within sites, then all within- site movement distances should have an equal likeli- hood of being observed. on the other hand, if ﬁsh exhibit ﬁdelity to particular spatial locations within sites, then, within these sites, short movement dis- tances should be more likely to be observed than long movement distances. these contrasting expectations provide a means to test for ﬁdelity using movement data. however, in our study design, not all within-site movement distances were equally detectable. for example, 15-m-long movements could be detected from all transects, whereas 150-m-long movements could be detected only from transects located at the endpoints of our longest sites (fig. 2; see also albanese et al. 2003; roberts & angermeier 2007). we therefore generated an empirical distribution of the movement distances that were detectable in our study, in 15-m-long increments. we compared the mean (d) of this distribution to the mean (m) of the distribution of movement distances actually observed during the study. under the null hypothesis, supported by a test detectable movements actual movements y c n e u q e r f e v i t l a e r 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 135 150 movement

of distance distributions differed signiﬁcantly (p = 0.004, t=2.892; see text), indicating that ﬁsh moved shorter distances than would be predicted if ﬁsh had moved to all parts of sites with equal likelihood. 377 roberts et al. to reject result of m ‡ d, we would fail that ﬁsh exhibited no ﬁdelity to particular areas within sites. under the alternative hypothesis, supported by a test result of m < d, we would reject the null in favour of the conclusion that ﬁsh exhibited ﬁdelity to initial marking locations within sites. we conducted statisti- cal comparisons of m to d using monte carlo-based nonparametric t-tests in the program resampling procedures (howell 2000; 100,000 randomisations), assessing signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level. to account for potential bias in movement direction, we conducted tests using: (i) only upstream within-site movements plus nonmovements, (ii) only downstream within-site movements plus nonmovements and (iii) all within- site movements plus nonmovements, but because conclusions were the same across all tests, we report results only for the latter. we used monte carlo t-tests to assess variability in movement distance between directions (within-site movements only) and between sexes (all within-site recaptures). we used linear regression to assess relationships between an individual’s size-at-marking tl and the distance it moved, and between the time- lapse between marking and recapture of an individual (days) and the distance it moved. in both cases, regression models were built separately using: (i) within-site and within-year recaptures only, (ii) within- site recaptures over all years and (iii) all recapture data. in all of the above procedures, signiﬁcance was assessed at the 0.05 level. results over the duration of the study, we marked 485 roanoke logperch, 22 of which (5%) we recaptured (table 1). recapture rates were generally higher for ﬁsh marked in summer than in autumn (6% vs. 3%), and were higher for ﬁsh marked with vie than with ipd (6% vs. 1%). only two of 156 ﬁsh marked with ipd were ever recaptured. recaptures were evenly distributed across sites, occurring in all but site 6. two marked individuals were captured during the summer 2004 recapture-only sampling period, but no additional marked ﬁsh were captured in 2005 or 2006 (table 1). of the 22 recaptured individuals, eight (36%) from their marking exhibited no net movement transect, 12 (55%) exhibited between-transect, with- in-site movement and two (9%) exhibited between-site movement (table 2). within sites, downstream move- ments were more common than upstream ones (8 vs. 4), but mean (±sd) within-site movement distance did not differ signiﬁcantly between directions (28 ± 13 m t = 0.490, downstream vs. 34 ± 28 m upstream; p = 0.836). mean within-site movement distance was greater for males (23 ± 26 m) than for females signiﬁcantly so (t = 0.812, (11 ± 14 m), but not p = 0.498). pooling directions and sexes, the mean movement distance (m) of within-site recaptures, including non-movers, was 18 ± 20 m (fig. 2). the mean detectable movement distance within sites (d) was 41 ± 36 m, and was signiﬁcantly greater than m table 2. individual recapture records for roanoke logperch, ordered by date of marking. date marked date recaptured capture interval (d) marking site recapture site mark type distance

the alternative hypothesis that roanoke logperch exhibited ﬁdelity to the locations of their initial marking within sites. likelihood, the time interval between marking and recapture of an individual ranged from 24 to 1807 days (table 2). the two longest intervals corresponded to the two between-site movements. one male ﬁsh moved 2.5 km upstream from site 2 to site 3, crossing a bridge culvert in transit, between autumn 1998 and autumn 2003. based on its length, the ﬁsh was at least 1 year old at marking (j. roberts, unpublished data), and was therefore at least 6 years old at recapture. another male ﬁsh moved 3.2 km upstream from site 1 to site 2 between summer 2002 and summer 2004. this ﬁsh was the only marked age-0 individual that was ever recaptured. neither ﬁsh-size nor the mark–recapture time interval signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced within-site movement distance, but both signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced movement when the two between-site movements were included. distance moved was not signiﬁcantly related to individual (f = length-at-marking within sites within years 0.115, p = 0.743, d.f. = 9) or within sites across all years (f = 0.410, p = 0.530, d.f. = 19), but was sig- niﬁcantly negatively related to length when all data were considered (f = 11.979, p = 0.002, d.f. = 21). similarly, distance moved was not signiﬁcantly related to the mark–recapture time interval within sites within years (f = 2.449, p = 0.156, d.f. = 9) or within sites across all years (f = 0.304, p = 0.588, d.f. = 19), but was signiﬁcantly positively related to the time interval (f = 23.423, when p < 0.0001, d.f. = 21). data were all considered discussion we recorded frequent roanoke logperch movement over the 9-year period of study. most (64%) recaptured ﬁsh had moved between marking and recapture, relocating either to a different part of the marking site (15–75 m away) or to another site altogether (2.5–3.2 km away). in our view, these within- and between-site movements represented different move- ment processes, corresponding to the centre and tails, respectively, of a leptokurtic movement distribution (stott 1967; skalski & gilliam 2000; fausch et al. 2002), so we analysed and considered them separately. we viewed within-site movements as opportunities for roanoke logperch to track dynamic changes in the spatial conﬁgurations of microhabitat conditions with- in rifﬂe–run mesohabitats (power 1984; petty & grossman 2004; gowan 2007). although roanoke logperch moved frequently among transects within sites, these movements tended to be to transects roanoke logperch movement adjacent to the transect of initial ﬁsh marking; mean movement distance was signiﬁcantly shorter than would be predicted if ﬁsh had moved to all parts of sites with equal likelihood. our results thus indicate that adult and large-juvenile roanoke logperch exhib- ited ﬁdelity to restricted areas that were relatively stable in location, lengthier than a 15-m-long transect, yet shorter than a 150-m-long rifﬂe–run. this ﬁdelity was persistent over time, given that within-site move- ment distance did not increase with the length of the mark–recapture interval. fidelity was also unrelated to the size of the individual, in contrast to studies of other stream ﬁshes, which have shown higher transience in smaller, sub-dominant individuals (gowan & fausch 2002; petty & grossman 2004). fidelity of roanoke logperch to restricted portions of sites could have been due to: (i) low species vagility in general, (ii) lack of temporal variation in the spatial locations of suitable microhabitats within sites or (iii) an inability of individuals to perceive, or unwillingness of individuals to move in response to, spatial variation in habitat quality. our underwater observations of roa- noke logperch swimming actively within rifﬂe–runs, as well as our observations of occasional, long-distance movements (see results), leads us to reject the ﬁrst explanation, at least at the mesohabitat scale. we lack the behavioural data necessary to examine the third explanation. however, we have observed that the amounts and locations of suitable roanoke logperch microhabitats (sensu ensign & angermeier 1994; rosenberger & angermeier 2003) have remained relatively stable over the course of this study (roberts & angermeier 2006). such stability could reduce the need for substantial habitat-tracking movement within sites, and thus supports the second explanation for home-range ﬁdelity. in contrast to small-scale, within-site movements, we categorise the two between-site movements as either migration or dispersal. these two upstream movements of 3.2 and 2.5 km, represent exceptional movement records for a darter, and indeed for nonsalmonid stream ﬁshes in general (see also hoyt & kruskamp 1982; matheny & rabeni 1995; alba- nese 2001). both movements were based on observa- tions made over a long time interval (2–5 years), though we do not know whether movement was rapid or gradual over the interval. distant movements could serve any of various ecological functions for roanoke logperch, including accessing new resources in new mesohabitats and stream-reaches (schlosser 1995), counteracting larval drift (hall 1972; turner 2001; slack et al. 2004), connecting sub-populations occu- pying patchily distributed rifﬂe–runs (slack et al. 2004; roberts & angermeier 2007), or colonising new populations (denoncourt et al. 1975; buchanan & stevenson 2003; neely & george 2006). 379 roberts et al. various lines of evidence suggest that, when roa- noke logperch leave a local area within a rifﬂe–run, they tend to move extensively. first, given that the survival rate of subcutaneously marked logperch is high (rosenberger & angermeier 2002), our low recapture rate of marked ﬁsh suggests that many marked ﬁsh emigrated from sites prior to re-sampling. such emi- gration may have been artiﬁcially increased by our electroﬁshing; however, if present, this response was exhibited nonuniformly across individuals, given that we observed low transience among ﬁsh recaptured within sites. second, although our odds of detecting movements >150 m in length were quite low, 9% of the ﬁsh that we recaptured had moved more than 2 km. burkhead (1983) serendipitously observed a similarly long roanoke logperch movement in the upper roanoke river; the marked adult was caught by an angler 2.3 km downstream from the site where it was marked 10 months prior. finally, roanoke logperch have been captured in coves of smith mountain reservoir (one adult in 1981) and leesville reservoir (two adults in 1989), at least 20 km downstream from the nearest known reproducing populations in roanoke river and pigg river, respectively (jenkins & burkhead 1994). these ﬁsh may have been attempting dispersal. mark–recapture studies are inherently biased to- wards over-sampling sedentary individuals and under- sampling mobile ones. this is particularly true for stream ﬁshes, whose movements often exceed the boundaries of mark–recapture sites (gowan et al. 1994; skalski & gilliam 2000). even within an evenly-sampled mark–recapture site, subtler bias arises because not all movement distances are equally detectable (albanese et al. 2003). such bias was present in our study, but we confronted it directly using a post hoc method for generating the distribution and expected value of movement under the null hypothesis of spatially random movement, given knowledge of the distribution of sampling effort. this general approach may prove applicable to other hypothesis tests conducted on movement distributions that have been obtained using mark–recapture data. like many darters, roanoke logperch face perva- sive threats from agriculture, urbanisation and hydro- power generation (rosenberger 2007). more complete knowledge of roanoke logperch movement would help managers delineate the areas needed to protect populations from further threats and ensure that these areas remain demographically interconnected. future movement studies of roanoke logperch should be tailored speciﬁcally to document: (i) the spatial and temporal variability of home ranges in different environments, (ii) the size and variance of the mobile fraction of the population, (iii) the spatial extents over which migration and dispersal processes operate, (iv) whether and how much movement has been affected 380 by anthropogenic alterations of habitat and (v) how movement contributes to population viability and persistence. such knowledge is critical to the effective management of roanoke logperch, as well as other darters living in dynamic stream environments. acknowledgements this study was funded by the u.s. army corps of engineers. we thank all past members of team
