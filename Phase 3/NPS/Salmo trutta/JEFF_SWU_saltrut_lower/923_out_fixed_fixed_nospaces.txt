(2008) found reduced swimming activity during winter as compared to summer. contrasting these ﬁndings, other studies found winter activity to be similar or even higher than summer activity (diana et al. 1977; jepsen et al. 2001; koed et al. 2006). these discrepancies might reﬂect biological variability in pike behaviour in different ecosystems. however, the methodologies implemented are diverse, poten- tially invalidating direct comparisons between studies. furthermore, the above-mentioned ﬁeld studies used telemetry with manual tracking protocols that can have repercussions on the quality of the acquired data. for instance, a trade-off between temporal resolution and the number of ﬁsh tracked is inevitable. moreover, the manual tracking process per se may disturb the tagged ﬁsh and thereby induce nonvolitional behaviour biasing the data. a recently developed alternative to manual tracking is acoustic positional telemetry sys- tems (apts), enabling continuous automatic posi- tional telemetry (niezgoda et al. 2002). this method effectively surmounts potential imperfections of man- ual tracking. a large number of ﬁsh can be positioned simultaneously with high temporal and spatial resolu- tion and, as the data collection is carried out automat- ically by stationary hydrophones, the risk of disturbing the focal ﬁsh as part of the tracking process is eliminated. lowest activity at night and higher activity during the day, and activity peaks at dusk and dawn (diana 1980; cook & bergersen 1988; beaumont et al. 2005). however, given the ecological importance of this species, relatively little is known about the detailed pike winter biology including activity level and behaviour. in this study, we aimed at increasing the knowledge on winter biology of pike. speciﬁcally, patterns and levels of activity, in terms of movement, are investigated and compared between seasons. by implementing an apts, a very detailed data set on pike behaviour in a natural environment was acquired. pike were continuously positioned through two con- secutive years. from this data set, subsamples from late summer in both years were selected for further analysis. through winter seasonal and diel activity of pike materials and methods study area is, the study was conducted in a small danish eutrophic temperate lake [lake gosmer; 55°9¢n, 10°2¢w; area approximately 1 ha; ellipse-shaped, ca. 140 · 80 m; maximum depth 8 m; mean annual secchi depth 1.2 m (range: 0.4–2.4 m)]. the lake is an isolated water body, that there are no connected streams. the ﬁsh community was dominated by pike, perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) and roach (rutilus rutilus). submerged vegetation was restricted to a single bed of water lilies (nuphar lutea) along the southern shore. narrow and dense stands of emergent macrophytes (typha latifolia) covered the majority of the shoreline apart from the northern shore that was shaded by overhanging trees. environmental variables water temperature and dissolved oxygen content were registered at four depths through the water column (1.0 m, 2.5 m, 4.0 m and 5.5 m from the surface) by stationary data loggers (fdo 700 iq probes, iq sensor net, wtw gmbh, weilheim, germany). calculations of mean water temperature and oxygen content were based on data from the loggers at 1.0 and 2.5 m. lake volumes were calculated using gis software (arcgis 9.3, esri, redlands, ca, usa). fish during the period march 2009–october 2010, a total of 29 pike were captured using rod and line, trammel nets or electro ﬁshing on several ﬁshing occasions and tagged at the time of capture. pike were anesthetised in 0.5 mgæl)1 solution of 2-phenoxyethanol, and an acoustic transmitter (lotek ma-tp11-25; 11 mm diameter; 61 mm long; 11 g in air; 45 s burst interval, lotek wireless inc., newmarket, ontario, canada) was inserted into the body cavity through an incision anterior to the pelvic ﬁns. the incision was closed by two separate sutures using absorbable suture material (vicryl 3-0 fs-2, ethicon, johnson & johnson medical limited, livingston, scotland). total length and body mass were registered. duration of the complete tagging procedure was 3–5 min. finally, pike were released following full recovery in aerated lake water. a previous study using a comparable tagging procedure (jepsen & aarestrup 1999) found no or only minor adverse effects on growth and survival of pike. tracking system the study lake was equipped with an apts (lotek map_600; lotek wireless inc., newmarket, ontario, 387 baktoft et al. canada) that continuously monitored the tagged ﬁsh. in short, a receiver stored data collected by eight hydrophones covering the entire lake. the data were processed using proprietary software (biomap v. 2.1.12.1; build 2.633; lotek wireless inc., new- market, ontario, canada) yielding raw calculated positions based on registration by at three hydrophones (niezgoda et al. 2002). the raw posi- tions were ﬁltered and smoothed using a hidden markov model–based approach with a t-distributed observation noise (pedersen et al. 2008). validity of the tracking system was veriﬁed by monitoring transmitters moored at known positions and transmit- ters towed by a boat (baktoft, unpublished results). least data analysis and statistics from the complete data set, four subsample periods (per) through late summer, autumn and winter were selected for further analysis for two consecutive years, 2009 and 2010. each period consisted of ﬁve consec- utive days. the periods were selected to represent different seasons and thus water temperature regimes while keeping other environmental factors as identical as possible. the lake was left undisturbed, for example, no boat trafﬁc, sampling or ﬁshing while data were collected. distance calculations activity of each individual pike was calculated as the minimum moved distance per hour (dphind) based on observations within 60-min periods. thus, in each of the eight pers, a total of 24 · 5 = 120 measures of dphind were made on each individual pike included in the respective period. dphind was deﬁned as the two-dimensional euclidian distance between consec- utive locations. as the transmitters used had a burst interval of 45 s, each individual was positioned up to 80 times every hour, yielding a maximum of 79 calculated distances per hour. however, the actual number of positions per hour (nobs) varied between zero and full coverage (79 calculated distances) because of the probabilistic nature of detecting the acoustic signals. as observed activity is estimated as the sum of line segment lengths, the maximum obtainable observed activity (dphind) will inevitably be a function of nobs. however, as the true level of activity is a ﬁnite value, there exists a given threshold of nobs above which the observed activity credibly reﬂect true activity. visual inspection of mean dphind plotted against nobs revealed that at nobs < 24, there was a positive correlation between nobs and dphind, indicating that dphind was underestimated. at nobs ‡ 24, this corre- lation was absent. therefore, all data with nobs < 24 388 were excluded from further analysis, reducing the data set from 19,440 to 10,606 observations on dphind. mean moved distance for each hour of the day (dphind mean) within each per:year combination was calculated as the mean of dphind means grouped by time of day (tod; [0:23] each representing an hour). thus, for each tod in each per:year combination, the mean moved distance was calculated for each individual pike. subsequently, the mean and variance of these individual means were calculated to get the overall mean moved distance (dphtod mean) and corresponding variance for each tod grouped by per:year. finally, these were summed within each per:year combination to get mean daily moved distances. variances of the dphtod mean values were summed and square rooted to give standard deviations (sd) of the daily means. statistics (2009) statistical analyses were performed to investigate how overall activity and diel patterns of activity varied between periods and years. initial analysis according to zuur et al. revealed (i) no extreme outliers present in the data set, (ii) potential interactions between per:tod and per:year and (iii) the effect of tod on dphind was complex and nonlinear. dphind was log10(y + 1)-transformed to meet the assumption of normality. data were anal- ysed using a mixed-effects model with random intercept including individual ﬁsh (fishid) as a random factor. this model imposes a compound symmetry correlation structure allowing multiple observations from the same individual to be corre- lated (pinheiro & bates 2000). furthermore, a ﬁrst- order autoregressive correlation structure (ar1; pin- heiro & bates 2000) was included to model the temporal correlation between observations within each fishid nested in per and year. the model was further extended to a generalised additive mixed- effects model (gamm; wood 2006), thereby allow- ing the nonlinear tod-dphind relationship to be ﬁtted by smoothers. cyclic cubic regression splines were used to model the cyclic nature of tod (wood 2006). finally, length, centred around 60 cm (tl60), was included as a covariate. by centring total length, the estimated intercept from the gamm repre- sents a 60-cm pike instead of a 0-cm pike. total in summary, the following gamm was ﬁtted: log10ðdphind þ 1þ ¼a þ tl60 þ per þ year þ per:year þ fðtodþ:per:year þ a þ e where a is the overall intercept; tl60 is total length centred around 60 cm; per is period of year; f(tod) is a smoothing function modelling time of day using a cyclic cubic regression spline; a is a random component that is normally distributed with expectation 0 and variance r2 a; and, ﬁnally, e is the error term, which is modelled by the ar1-structure along with random noise following a normal distribution. the effect on model ﬁt of all included terms and interactions was tested by comparing full and nested models using akaike information crite- rion (aic) as described by zuur et al. (2009) and wood (2006). in short, aic is a measure of goodness of ﬁt that incorporates model complexity; the lower the aic, the better the model ﬁts the data. terms and interactions that did not improve model ﬁt were removed. statistical analyses were performed in r version 2.12.1 (r development core team 2010) using the mgcv 1.7-2 (wood 2006) and the nlme 3.1-97 (pinheiro et al. 2010) packages. results the number of pike and summary of environmental variables in each period are given in table 1. a thermocline at approximately 4 m from the surface was present during per1 in both years, rendering the hypolimnion anoxic. the hypolimnion constituted approximately 17% of total lake volume. no stratiﬁ- cation was present in other periods. the number of pike varied, because of the longitudinal nature of the study and associated natural mortality of tagged and sequential tagging of new pike. mean daily movement ranged from 621 to 938 mæday)1 in 2009 and 928 to 1248 mæday)1 in 2010. although between-period variation was appar- ent, there was no consistent seasonal trend in mean daily movement (fig. 1). ) 1 – y a d · m ( t n e m e v o m y l i a d  n a e m 1500 1250 1000 750 500 250 0 seasonal and diel activity of pike 2009 2010 per1 per2 per3 per4 fig. 1. observed mean activity per day (mæday)1) in the four periods (per) grouped by year (2009: open bars;

craig 1996), studies have revealed that pike also utilise active hunting strategies (turesson & bro¨nmark 2004) and regularly perform active movements (diana 1980; jepsen et al. 2001; kobler et al. 2008). the present study corroborates these studies by showing that the pike on average moved 621–1248 mæday)1. variation in water temperature is an integral part of the seasonal variation in lentic ecosystems and may inﬂuence pike activity (casselman 1978). however, in is often impossible to longitudinal ﬁeld studies, isolate from other changing environmental factors that also may affect pike activity, for example, photoperiod and turbidity. therefore, in the present study, potential effects of water temperature on pike activity were not temperature of water the effect it seasonal and diel activity of pike statistically tested per se but were included in the combined effect of the periods (table 1). thus, as water temperature declined monotonically through the periods whereas pike activity remained high, the present study indicates that, although inconclusive, water temperature and ice cover seem not to affect pike activity levels. previous studies report variable seasonal effects on pike activity, including decreasing, unchanging and increasing overall activity levels when comparing summer and winter (diana et al. 1977; cook & bergersen 1988; jepsen et al. 2001; koed et al. 2006; kobler et al. 2008). however, a direct comparison of these studies, including the present, is difﬁcult because of the differences in applied meth- odology. moreover, each study site comprises a unique suite of complex biological, environmental and physical variables and interactions, each of which the pike potentially respond to or utilise in variable ways. indeed, considerable between-lake variation in pike behaviour and response to environmental stimuli has previously been documented (jepsen et al. 2001; andersen et al. 2008). in this respect, lake gosmer differs from the majority of study sites [e.g., lac ste. anne (diana 1980), eleven mile reservoir (cook & bergersen 1988) and lake kleiner do¨llnsee (kobler et al. 2008)] in being smaller, more turbid and lacking submerged macrophytes. it is conceivable that the lack of submerged macrophytes could reduce the success rate of ambush attacks and oblige the pike to use more active hunting methods. however, turesson & bro¨n- mark (2004) found that pike are able to utilise sit-and- wait attacks even when exposed, by remaining motionless for extended periods of time followed by a sudden strike towards prey. thus, macrophyte cover might not be a prerequisite for the pike to utilise sit- and-wait attacks. in that case, the relatively high turbidity of lake gosmer might increase the sit-and- wait success rate because the distance at which the prey detects the pike is reduced (turesson & bro¨nmark 2007). however, the reduced detection range also inﬂuences the ability of pike to visually detect the prey and, thus, reduces the visual predator–prey encounter rate (turesson & bro¨nmark 2007), which might impel the pike to increase swimming activity in search of prey. inter-study differences aside, there seems to be consensus from ﬁeld studies that pike maintain at least some activity through the cold seasons, even under ice cover (diana et al. 1977; cook & bergersen 1988; jepsen et al. 2001; koed et al. 2006; kobler et al. 2008). in contrast to this, casselman (1978) found a strong correlation between swimming activity and temperature in laboratory settings, with optimum activity at approximately 20 °c and virtually no activity below 6 °c. in the light of casselman temperature on (1978) and the general effect of physiological processes (fry 1971), the observed 391 baktoft et al. pattern of high activity levels during the cold season may seem surprising. however, although decreasing water temperature affects the ﬁsh’s maximum swim- ming speed (claireaux et al. 2006), it does not render the pike immobile. furthermore, the ﬁndings of casselman (1978) are based on juvenile and subadult pike, whereas the present and other ﬁeld studies (diana et al. 1977; cook & bergersen 1988; jepsen et al. 2001; koed et al. 2006; kobler et al. 2008) examined adult pike. moreover, casselman (1978) provided the pike food ad libitum, which might have reduced the pike’s motivation for movement. addi- tionally, schwalme & mackay (1992) suggest that the majority of fatty acids accumulating during winter in recrudescing pike ovaries originate from dietary nutrients consumed during ovarian recrudescence as opposed to transfers from somatic tissue. this indi- cates that at least mature female pike forage and, thus, are active, year-round, to optimise reproductive suc- cess. supporting this, diana (1979) found that both female and male pike from lac ste. anne forage through winter, although daily rations were low. a distinct diel pattern was evident in all periods, showing differences in activity between night and day. the shifts from night to day, and vice versa, were often accompanied by a peak in activity (figs 2 and 3). furthermore, timing of these shifts between night and day levels of activity followed the times of sunrise and sunset. previous ﬁeld studies have found diel varia- tions in activity with main ﬁndings comparable to the present study (diana 1980; cook & bergersen 1988; jepsen et al. 2001; beaumont et al. 2005; kobler et al. 2008) and, although variation is ubiquitous, there seems to be consensus that pike activity is low at night, higher at daylight and peaks at twilight. this diel pattern substantiates the notion that pike generally is a visual predator feeding during the crepuscular periods (casselman 1996), even though it should be noticed that movement per se might not be a good indicator of pike foraging periods as pike are known to utilise a sit-and-wait foraging strategy (eklo¨v 1992; craig 1996). nevertheless, as discussed above, pike may also use active hunting strategies (turesson & bro¨nmark 2004) and the low-light conditions in twilight might promote these. thus, the activity peaks at twilight could be related to increased forage intensity whereby the pike could exploit a competitive advantage as stated by the ‘twilight hypothesis’ (pitcher & turner 1986). according to this, the pike have an advantage in low-light conditions as the prey react later than in full light, when approached by a stalking pike (pitcher & turner 1986). in spite of progressively reduced day lengths, the pike sustained a relatively high daily activity level throughout the periods (fig. 1). this might be caused by increased activity during the illuminated hours of 392 which there are some indications in fig. 2. temperate lake prey ﬁsh are known to display signiﬁcant seasonal changes in behaviour including reduced activity and altered habitat utilisation (jacobsen et al. 2004; skov et al. 2011). this could, although specu- lative, be a reasonable explanation for the increased pike activity in winter as the pike may have to increase movement in order to encounter prey. temperate freshwater lakes are often considered to be inactive and static ecosystems during winter (salonen et al. 2009). however, as shown in the present study, the natural apex predator in these lakes remains active in cold water and even under ice. it is well known that pike can have a profound structuring effect on lower trophic levels in freshwater lakes during summer, through cascading top-down effects exerted on the prey ﬁsh community (prejs et al. 1994; berg et al. 1997; skov et al. 2011). besides the direct effects on prey ﬁsh abundance and population struc- ture, mediated through predation, indirect effects on the prey ﬁsh community are known. these include changes in morphology (bro¨nmark & miner 1992; eklo¨v & jonsson 2007), reduced activity (lima & dill 1990; bean & winﬁeld 1995; jacobsen & berg 1998) and altered habitat utilisation (jacobsen & perrow 1998) underpinning the ecological importance of this species. the overriding factor driving this structuring effect is undoubtedly that the pike represents an instant threat to the prey ﬁsh. as visual cues from pike induce changes in prey ﬁsh behaviour (mikheev et al. 2006; martin et al. 2010) and the probability of pike–prey encounters, ceteris paribus, is positively correlated with pike activity, the magnitude of the structuring effect is likely linked to pike activity. furthermore, as discussed above, at least mature female pike appear to be foraging year-round. as our study strongly suggests that pike remain active to the same extent summer and winter, it seems plausible that some structuring effects of pike on the prey ﬁsh community might also be present during winter. supporting the hypothesis of a structuring effect during winter, skov et al. (2011) found that in partially migratory prey ﬁsh communi- ties, the individual propensity to migrate for predation refuge in connected streams during winter is positively correlated with individual size-related risk of predation from pike. however, more research, simultaneously studying the behaviour of pike and prey ﬁsh during winter, is warranted to further test the hypothesis of a year-round structuring effect. the implementation of an atps to study the behaviour of a lentic ﬁsh species proved to be successful by yielding unprecedented time series on individual pike behaviour in natural settings. from this large data set, it is evident that the behaviour of pike is very variable both within and between individuals (data not presented here). as the present study and the to test applied statistical model focus on establishing and analysing general patterns in pike behaviour, it should be noted that these general patterns potentially enshroud this large variation. furthermore, it should be noted that the presented results are based on the behaviour of pike in a single lake for which reason replicate studies should be carried out the generality of the ﬁndings. nevertheless, the present study covers two consecutive years and although year- to-year variation was apparent, winter activity was high in both years. furthermore, owing to the small size of the study lake, long unidirectional movements (i.e. >140 m), as have been found in larger lakes (e.g. kobler et al. 2008), were impossible. therefore, it is conceivable that activity could be at the same level or even higher in larger lakes. we acknowledge that the habitat constriction in per1 both years caused by a thermocline rendering 17% of lake volume anoxic potentially compromises the between-period compar- isons. however, as the reduction in available habitat was relatively small the additional information gained from including a period with warm water, relative to the other periods, outweighs the potential impediments. (17%), we believe that in conclusion, the present study indicates that the activity of pike in a temperate lake remains high through the seasons from late summer to winter. these ﬁndings add to the accumulating evidence, suggesting that lentic ecosystems are less static and more active during the cold season than previously assumed. furthermore, the ﬁndings suggest that the structuring effects of pike on lower trophic levels, which have been documented during summer, potentially can be present during the winter as well. acknowledgements we thank the owner of lake gosmer, søren anton hansen,
