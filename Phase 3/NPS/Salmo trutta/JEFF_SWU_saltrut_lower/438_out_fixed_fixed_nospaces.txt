however, by electroﬁshing concealment habitat during the day, we captured 10 times more adult trout than we counted immediately beforehand by snor- keling. adult trout were concealed in cobble-boulder substrate and woody debris during the day. k. a. meyer1*, j. s. gregory2 1water resources team winema national forest, klamath falls, oregon, 2gregory aquatics, mackay, idaho, usa * present address: idaho department of fish and game, 1414 east locust lane, nampa, id 83686, usa;

heggenes et al. 1993), rainbow trout o. mykiss (campbell & neuner 1985; contor & grifﬁth 1995; grifﬁth & smith 1995), and bull trout salvelinus conﬂuentus (thurow 1997), emerge at night from daytime concealment during winter. daytime concealment most often occurs in cobble- boulder substrate, woody debris, undercut banks and submerged aquatic macrophytes. it has been suggested that large-bodied adult trout are unable to ﬁnd suitably sized concealment habitat, espe- cially in the interstitial spaces of cobble-boulder substrate, and instead overwinter above the sub- strate in deep pools, often forming large aggre- gations (bjornn & reiser 1991; cunjak 1996). this assertion, however, is based on few studies that have directly observed diel behavior of adult trout during winter. campbell & neuner (1985) found resident adult rainbow trout (ﬁ15 cm in length) concealed in the substrate during the day 138 and resting lethargically on the bottom at night; however, their study streams contained few ﬁsh larger than 20 cm. cunjak & power (1986) ob- served adult brown_trout and brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis aggregating in large main stem pools during the day and speculated that suitably sized concealment habitat was generally absent, but they did not report nighttime observations. brown_trout larger than 25 cm actively aggregated in deep, slow stream areas during the day, whereas smaller ﬁsh ((cid:176)25 cm) sheltered passively in the substrate or in submerged aquatic macrophytes (heggenes et al. 1993). thus, assessment of winter diurnal activity of adult trout is lacking, particu- larly for larger (–20 cm) ﬁsh. our primary objective was to assess, under a variety of geomorphic stream conditions, whether adult trout exhibited daytime concealment behav- ior during winter. concealment behavior in young salmonids appears to begin as water temperatures decline below 7–10(cid:190)c (hartman 1963; chapman & bjornn 1969; rimmer et al. 1983; heggenes et al. 1993; contor & grifﬁth 1995) and ﬁsh gradually shift to nocturnalism with decreasing temperatures (fraser et al. 1995). if we found adult trout con- evidence of concealment behavior by adult rainbow trout and brook_trout in winter cealed during the day, our second objective was to assess if a similar shift to nocturnalism occurred in adult trout as water temperatures declined. methods we selected study streams in idaho (big lost river, parsons creek) and oregon (cherry creek, sevenmile creek) with varying geomorphic and habitat characteristics (table 1). underwater ob- servations were made in these streams using a dry suit, mask, snorkel and recording sleeve or bank recorder. one study site of approximately 100 m was established for each stream, and the same site was sampled during each survey. the diver started at the downstream end of the site and proceeded cautiously upstream searching for ﬁsh throughout the unit, including the cover components and stream margins. when a ﬁsh was encountered, an estimate of total length (tl) to the nearest cent- imeter was recorded. we regularly calibrated our- selves by aligning the snout and tail with adjacent substrate material and measuring that distance (cf. cunjak & power 1986). our search time was di- rected at enumeration and not behavioral obser- vations. because we did not want to disturb ﬁsh during the day dives and therefore affect their be- havior at night, and because there was a limit to the size of structure we could manipulate (thurow 1997) to search adult concealment habitat, few rocks or pieces of wood were turned to search for ﬁsh. however, efforts were made to rigorously search any concealment habitat where ﬁsh could be detected without disturbing the concealment structure, such as woody debris, undercut banks and larger substrate where vision into interstitial chambers was possible. the few ﬁsh we did observe when searching concealment structure, we deﬁned as concealed. dives typically lasted about 1 hour and were be- gun between 1200 and 1430 during the day and at least 1 hour after sunset at night. night dives were aided by the use of a dive-light, with the beam di- rected to the underside of the water surface to minimize ﬁsh disturbance (cf. contor & grifﬁth 1995). underwater visibility exceeded 3 m for each sampling occasion. at each study site water tem- peratures were recorded hourly through the winter with thermographs, and air and water tempera- tures were recorded before each dive with a hand- held thermometer. scale and otolith analysis re- vealed that ﬁsh ﬂ15 cm tl in cherry creek and sevenmile creek and fish ﬂ20 cm tl in parsons creek and big lost river were age»2„. the dis- crepancy was due to colder water temperature, lower productivity and consequently slower growth rates in the oregon streams than the idaho streams. to control for possible variation in noctur- nalism through the winter, we stratiﬁed our sur- veys into early, mid- and late winter dives. on the eastern slope of the southern cascade range in oregon, winter typically lasts from mid-november, when water temperatures drop below 7–10(cid:190)c, to mid-march when rain-on-snow events often lead to an early runoff. consequently, dives in oregon were made on 27 november 1996 (early winter), 11 and 12 january 1997 (mid-winter), and 8 march 1997 (late winter). in idaho, where winter con- ditions were more prolonged, dives were made on 7 november 1996 (early winter), 3 february 1997 (mid-winter), and 31 march 1997 (late winter). to compare day and night counts of brook_trout and rainbow trout, we used a three-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) blocked by stream with phase (day vs night) as a repeated measure and sample period (early, mid- and late winter) as a main factor. to compare patterns of table 1. selected biological and hydrological characteristics of the study streams in idaho and oregon at the snorkeling sites latitude/longitude elevation (m) gradient (%) stream order rosgen typea stream big lost parsons sevenmile cherry 43(cid:190)59˜n/113(cid:190)46˜w 43(cid:190)59˜n/113(cid:190)46˜w 42(cid:190)42˜n/122(cid:190)04˜w 42(cid:190)36˜n/122(cid:190)08˜w 1890 1890 1280 1329 0.5 (cid:176)0.1 1.0 3.0 mean wetted width (m) mean annual discharge (m3/s) 10 7 8 8 9.6 0.1 0.7 0.7 mean monthly water temperature ((cid:190)c) n 7.5 5.5 3.7 3.3 d 5.8 4.1 2.5 na j 5.3 3.9 2.4 1.6 f 5.6 4.3 3.2 2.1 m na na 3.6 2.6 4 2 3 3 c4 c4 e4 b3 available concealment coverb swd/lwd swd/ucb lwd/ucb cbs a based on stream type classiﬁcation in rosgen (1994). b cbs‰cobble-boulder substrate;

this difference between day and night counts was signiﬁcant for both rain- bow trout (p‰0.009) and brook_trout (p‰0.002). only once (big lost river, early winter, brook_trout) did we count more of one species of trout during the day than at night. the number of ﬁsh counted consistently de- clined as winter progressed for both species, but the relationship was not signiﬁcant for rainbow 140 fig. 1. mean numbers of adult rainbow trout and brook_trout counted during day and night snorkeling surveys in four study streams in idaho and oregon fig. 2. mean nocturnal index of rainbow trout and brook_trout and average water temperature during snorkeling surveys in four study streams in idaho and oregon trout (p‰0.573) and only marginally signiﬁcant for brook_trout (p‰0.075). on average, 25% fewer rainbow trout were observed at night in late winter vs early winter. in contrast, 78% fewer brook_trout were observed at night in late winter vs early winter. the nocturnal index was slightly higher in each stream for brook_trout than rainbow trout (fig. 2), but the difference was not signiﬁcant (p‰0.504). brook_trout were exposed during the day at two of the four sites (both idaho streams) but consistently only in the big lost river, whereas rainbow trout were consistently exposed in all locations where evidence of concealment behavior by adult rainbow trout and brook_trout in winter rather a shallower pool that contained a large, dense complex of small woody debris. at night, some trout were observed in the pools but did not appear to be associated closely with the cover. in parsons creek, exposed trout during the day and at night were found in deep pools which contained large, dense patches of small woody debris; how- ever, at night some trout (primarily brook_trout) were observed in rifﬂes where the closest cover was undercut banks. in sevenmile creek, no ﬁsh were ever located during the day, and at night, adult brook_trout were almost exclusively observed in holding positions in the large pools adjacent to but well distanced from the complexes of woody ma- terial. exposed ﬁsh in cherry creek during both day and night were located in pools, behind boul- ders in mid-channel, or along the stream margins. three adult rainbow trout (all ﬂ33 cm) were ob- served by snorkeling in the abbreviated site in the big lost river prior to electroﬁshing the area. in that same abbreviated site, 29 adult rainbow trout and 1 adult brook_trout were captured with the electroﬁsher in two passes (nhat‰30, 95% conﬁ- dence interval 30–32, capture probability 0.882). most ﬁsh were captured from small woody debris in the site. five of 31 adult trout were ﬂ33 cm and 27 of 31 were ﬂ25 cm. water temperature during the snorkeling/electroﬁshing survey was 9(cid:190)c. discussion our results indicate that, in winter, many adult trout, at least in our study streams, seek shelter in concealment structure during the day and emerge at night. previously, this type of behavior has been afﬁrmed only for juvenile salmonids. by con- cealing during the day, adult trout attain the same ecological beneﬁts that juvenile salmonids gain from concealment, including protection from ﬂoods or ice (hartman 1965), reduced energy ex- penditure (heggenes et al. 1993), and avoidance of fig. 3. the relationship between average instantaneous water temperatures (day and night) and nocturnal index of adult trout (rainbow and brook_trout combined) during snorkeling surveys in four study streams in idaho and oregon they occurred. the nocturnal index for both spe- cies was signiﬁcantly higher in the streams with colder water temperature (p‰0.034; fig. 2) but did not change within each stream over the course of winter (p‰0.446). since there was no difference in nocturnalism between species in our anova model, we pooled species to calculate an overall nocturnal index value for each survey and re- gressed it against average instantaneous water tem- perature for each paired survey. there was a strong negative relationship between water temperature and overall nocturnal index (p‰0.001; r2‰0.670; n‰12; fig. 3). the estimated size of ﬁsh observed did not differ between day and night dives for either species in any of the study streams (table 2). though the mean ﬁsh length was usually slightly larger during the day than at night, there was never a signiﬁcant difference for any comparison (p–0.135). in the big lost river, trout exposed during the day were always in pools, although most of the trout observed were not in the deepest pool but table 2. sizes of rainbow trout and brook_trout observed while day and night snorkeling at each study stream during winter 1996–1997. means”1 se are shown stream big lost parsons sevenmile cherry big lost parsons sevenmile cherry n 49 13 3 12 1 day mean size night mean size (cm tl) range n (cm tl) range 31”1 36”1 ---na--- 20”3 28”1 23 ---na--- ---na--- rainbow trout 66 41 20–41 30–43 17–22 24 brook_trout 20–36 ---na--- 18 4 64 10 29”1 33”1 ---na--- 18”1 26”1 26”2 18”1 17”1 20–41 20–43 15–22 20–36 20–30 15–27 15–22 141 meyer & gregory predators (fraser et al. 1993). in a recent study, valdimarsson & metcalfe (1998) showed that juv- enile atlantic salmon salmo_salar clearly selected refuges that allowed them to hide but offered little shelter from the current, and suggested the pri- mary function of winter nocturnal behavior is to hide from diurnal predators. if hiding from pred- ators is the overriding factor leading adult trout to conceal in winter, it follows that concealment behavior would be reduced when vulnerability is lower, such as under turbid or ice-covered con- ditions (young 1995; gregory & grifﬁth 1996a, jakober et al. 1998), neither of which occurred in our streams during our surveys. although in winter all juvenile salmonids exhibit nocturnal behavior, our results suggest that in streams and rivers where adult trout do conceal during the day, some adult ﬁsh remain diurnally exposed. this may be due to competition for larger spaces, which could result in adult exclusion from daytime concealment, as has been observed with juvenile trout (gregory & grifﬁth 1996b). this ul- timately could lead to emigration from the area or reduced survival of excluded trout. such a hypo- thesis suggests that smaller adults would be ex- cluded from spaces during the day, which is not supported by our ﬁnding that the size of rainbow trout and brook_trout counted at night did not dif- fer from those counted during the day. alterna- tively, adult trout densities are typically lower than juvenile densities, therefore competition may be re- duced or absent. adult trout may be more ﬂexible in their concealment behavior than juvenile trout, shifting between diurnalism and nocturnalism de- pending on food availability, water temperature, competitive (bra¨nna¨s & alana¨ra¨ 1997), or other conditions. interactions the concealment behavior we observed was not limited to the smaller adult trout in the popula- tions. rainbow trout and brook_trout up to 22 cm were concealed during the day in cobble-boulder substrate and up to 43 cm were concealed in small and large woody debris. in contrast to our ﬁnd- ings, heggenes et al. (1993) found adult brown_trout up to 25 cm concealed in cobble-boulder sub- strate and submerged aquatic macrophytes, but larger ﬁsh were not concealed. species differences in habitat suitability (meyer & grifﬁth 1997) or the availability of adequately sized concealment chambers (bustard & narver 19975; gregory & grifﬁth 1996a) may inﬂuence the extent of daytime concealment. our results suggest that, at tempera- tures ﬁ9(cid:190)c, even the larger trout in a given popula- tion may become nocturnal if suitably sized con- cealment habitat is available. in the big lost river, we captured 58% more adult trout from a 15-m section of our 100-m snor- 142 keling site with the electroﬁsher than we ever counted at night over the entire site, suggesting that all adult trout may not emerge from conceal- ment each night. grifﬁth & smith (1993) found that 61–66% of juvenile cutthrout trout and brown_trout emerged at night at water temperatures around 7(cid:190)c, similar to the range of 5–9(cid:190)c in the big lost river. the slower rate of gastric evacu- ation during winter (36 hours required to evacuate 95% of stomach contents of adult brown_trout at 4(cid:190)c; elliott 1972) may relax the need to feed each night. our results illustrate the need to carefully con- sider observational methods in future ﬁeld studies to assess adult trout winter habitat use. had we only snorkeled during the day, we would have con- cluded, at least in the idaho streams, that adult trout overwintered in deep pools above the sub- strate, as previous daytime snorkeling and radio- telemetry studies have found (cunjak & power 1986; chisholm et al. 1987; heggenes et al. 1993; brown & mackay 1995; jakober et al. 1998). we believe that searching the substrate and other con- cealment habitat for sheltered ﬁsh, which has been effective for juvenile salmonids (rimmer et al. 1984; cunjak 1998; heggenes et al. 1993; thurow 1997) and has been recommended as a means of calibrating winter habitat use (heggenes & saltveit 1990), will be largely ineffective for adult trout be- cause of the physical size of concealment spaces necessary to hold adult trout and the physical limit to the size of stone or woody debris a snorkeler can overturn. we located only four adult trout during our study that we deﬁned as concealed; two were in cherry creek, wedged deep in interstitial chambers between immovable boulders, and two were in big lost river, deep in woody debris com- plexes, all with only a portion of their body visible. investigations of adult trout winter habitat use may need to use a combination of survey methods, including radio-telemetry, electroﬁshing, and day/ night snorkeling. previous studies of juvenile salmonids have found that concealment behavior begins around 7– 10(cid:190)c (hartman 1963; chapman & bjornn 1969; rimmer et al. 1983; heggenes et al. 1993; con- tor & grifﬁth 1995); however, in a recent investiga- tion of juvenile atlantic salmon, gries et al. (1997) found no threshold to nocturnalism at tempera- tures up to 23(cid:190)c. we found adult trout concealed at temperatures ﬁ9(cid:190)c but do not know whether a concealment threshold existed. our temperature vs nocturnal index regression suggests that a thresh- old in our streams may have occurred at 10(cid:190)c. we suspect that threshold may vary by species and ge- omorphic characteristics, but this remains to be tested for adult trout. a potentially confounding evidence of concealment behavior by adult rainbow trout and brook_trout in winter factor in the temperature-ﬁsh count relationship is that there was no overlap in water temperature be- tween idaho streams and oregon streams. thus, we cannot be certain that the higher ﬁsh counts we observed were speciﬁcally due to higher tempera- ture and not a difference in ﬁsh behavior between the idaho and oregon streams. studies over a wider range of temperatures and seasons (spring and fall) are needed to more fully assess the effect temperature has on adult concealment behavior. our study design had some limitations. the small sample size may have led to a failure in ﬁnd- ing signiﬁcant differences in some of the variables in our models that were truly different, but we did not estimate the power (1–b) of the tests because retrospective power analysis on observed data and effect size is meaningless (steidl et al. 1997). since we did not use block-nets to close our snorkeling sites to ﬁsh movement, we cannot be certain that the discrepancy between day and night counts was not the result of ﬁsh moving into our study sites after our day dives and before our night dives. however, our snorkeling and electroﬁshing results suggest this is highly unlikely. we believe, instead, that the ﬁsh that were exposed at night in excess of those counted during the day had emerged from daytime concealment. our ﬁnding that adult trout concealed during the day in winter may have important implications for the management of stream-dwelling salmonids. considering that trout typically do not reach sizes much larger than those in our streams (except in large rivers and unusually productive streams) and that our observations were made in streams with varying channel characteristics and water tem- pertures, the concealment behavior we observed by adult trout might be widespread. research of the magnitude previously devoted to juvenile salmonid winter ecology is needed to assess the extent of adult trout concealment during winter and the ef- fects that stream size and type, ﬁsh species and size, water temperature, concealment habitat type and availability, and ice and turbidity conditions have on that concealment and, ultimately, on over- winter survival or carrying capacity of adult trout. resumen 1. se ha realizado poca investigacio´n sobre la ecologı´a invernal de truchas adultas, en particular sobre el comportamiento de escondite. buceando, comparamos conteos bajo el aqua, de dia y de noche, de adultos de oncorhynchus_mykiss y salvelinus_fontinalis en cuatro rı´os. 2. a temperatura entre 1(cid:190)c y 9(cid:190)c, los conteos durante el dia fueron el 44% mientras que el 16% de los conteos por buzeo fueron observados durante la noche para ambas especies. al avanzar el invierno, los conteos de noche disminuyeron ma´s para s. fontinalis que para o. mykiss pero esta disminucio´n no fue signiﬁcativa en ninguna de las dos especies. el nocturnalis- mo de ambas especies fue mayor en los rı´os con temperatures mas frias. 3. observamos pocos individuos en estructuras de escondite, sin embargo, durante el dia, capturamos con pesca ele´ctrica 10 veces ma´s truchas adultas en habitats de escondite que las con- tadas previamente con buzeo. las truchas adultas se esconden en sustratos de grava y restos vegetales durante el dia. acknowledgments we thank the winema national forest for logistical support and j. s. grifﬁth for insightful discussions on winter ﬁsh ecol- ogy and for comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript. critiques by michael k. young, chris peery, russ f. thurow and an anonymous reviewer greaty improved the manuscript. references bjornn, t.c. & reiser, d.w. 1991. habitat requirements. american fisheries society special publication 19: 83–138. bra¨nna¨s, e. & alana¨ra¨, a. 1997. is diel dualism in feeding ac- tivity inﬂuenced by competition between individuals?
