(2) fish farm manag- ers in china argue that glass eels collected from dif- ferent localities at different times exhibit different growth rates, temperature preferences and disease resistance. hence, recruitments at different places at different times probably differ genetically. (3) al- though no genetic differentiation has been found in 45 chan et al. the european eel anguielu anguillu (rodino & comparini, 1978), the same does not hold true for the america eel anguilla rustrutu (williams, koehn & mitton 1973; koehn & williams, 1978). with re- gard to geographic layout, the east coast of asia and that of north america resemble each other closely. all these led us to doubt the assumption of the existence of a large homogeneous eel popula- tion. the objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of existence of genetic differentiation in the natural population of a. juponica and to provide some hint on the pattern of differentiation and their causes. material and methods four samples of 100 individual glass eels each were collected in taipei (december 26, 1993), shizuoka (march 10, 1993), shanghai (april 15, 1993) and dandong (may 3, 1993) respectively. sampling sta- tions were chosen for their latitudinal location, posi- tion relative to the kuroshio current and availability of local scientists who could help in sampling. fro- zen samples were transported to hong kong by air i 0.800 0.750 xidhloo / / 0.700 0.650 / / - 3 0.500.- c .- w y1 0.450- 0 0.400 4 20 4 25 30 35 40 latitude i degree 1 45 fig 1. regression of frequencies of idhloo and pgdloo (both arcsine transformed) with latitude. the regression equations are: arcsine (idh100)=0.0122 (latitude)+0.293 and arcsine (pgd100)=0.00681 (latitude)+0.349. for the first regression (idhloo), r'=0.887, f=15.7 and p=0.0579. for the second re- gression (pgdloo), r2=0.872, f=13.6 and p=0.0663. 46 and kept in a -70°c freezer until electrophoretic analysis. isozyme genotypes were revealed by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis (smith, 1976). the ante- rior half of the body (including liver and heart) of each individual was homogenized with an equal vol- ume (1 g: 1 ml) of 0.01 m tris-hc1 (ph 7.0) at 4°c. samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 rpm. electrophoresis was conducted with a continuous tris-citric, ph 8.0 buffer system. gel was prepared by mixing starch (from sigma) with gel buffer (1 1:100, w:v) in a side-armed thick-walled flask, and heated on a hot plate while being vigorously swirled. a typical run lasted for 2700 vh (constant 180 v, 15 h). the gel was then ready for slicing and staining. isozyme genotypes were visualized with an agar overlay method modified by refield & salini (1980). nadp-isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh- 1) and 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (pgd) were cho- sen because of their high variabilities (observed het- erozygosity=63.8% and 58.1 % respectively in the taiwan sample) and constant electrophoretic resolu- tion for determination of allelic frequencies. in our preliminary observations on taiwan glass eels, we found that pgt-1 and pgi-2 were moderately vari- able (observed heterozygosity=8.6% and 5.4% re- spectively). pgm-1, pgm-2, and idh-2 were rarely variable (observed heterozygosity=1.5%, 1.1 %, and 1.1% respectively). mpi and sdh-1,-2 were stained with very low activity. adh was non-detectable. ldh (both heart and muscle forms), ck, and g3p were monmorphic. me and est were polymorphic but their resolution was not satisfactory. the most common alleles of each loci were arbi- trarily named as 100 and other alleles were named according to their relative distance from 100. idh- 1 has three common alleles, 100, 110 and 120 (their respective frequencies were 0.58, 0.225 and 0.165 in the taiwan sample). a rare allele, 90, was later dis- covered in shanghai and dandong samples with a frequency of 0.012. pgd also has three common (110, 100, 90) and one rare (80) alleles. their re- spective frequencies were 0.032, 0.484, 0.473 and 0.011 in the taiwan sample. the high variabilities of these two loci allow quick monitoring of changes in allelic frequencies. departures from hardy-weinberg equilibrium ex- pectancy are calculated as d = (ho -he)/ he, where ho = observed heterozygosity and he = expected heterozygosity. significance of deviations is tested by x2 = ( n -1)nd2 with n(n -1)/2 degrees of free- dom, where n is the sample size and n is the number of alleles (pamilo & varvio-aho, 1984; lessios, 1992). nei's genetic distances were calculated ac- cording to hoezel(l992).  results genetic diversity (he) generally decreased as our sampling station moved further away from the spawning ground (table 1). this was apparent for idh- 1, where the decrease in genetic diversity was 11.5% from taipei to dandong. this reduction in genetic diversity coupled with the increasing domi- nance of the most common allele in glass eels re- cruiting to the northern latitudes. although a 2.1 % decrease in genetic diversity heldfor pgd, the mag- table i. genetic diversity (he) decreases with latitudinal distance from the spawning ground, except pgd at shanghai (sh). tp=taipei. sz=shizuoka. dd =dandong. se=standard error. latitudinal distance from spawning ground (km) 1080 1720 21 50 2690 idh genetic diversity (hekse) 0.571*0.026 0.570+0.030 0.498k0.034 0.4561t0.041 pgd genetic diversity (hekse) 0.541*0.014 0.578k0.023 0.531*0.018 0.520ko.019 site tp sh sz dd table 2. departures (d) from hardy-weinberg expectations of nadp-isocitrate dehydrogenase, idh-1, were insignificant in each of the localities except at shanghai (sh). ho=observed heterozygosity. ksample size idh-1 n ho d chi-square significance tp 94 0.638 0.117 2.571 ns sh 83 0.422 -0.261 16.938 p<o.ol sz 98 0.408 -0.1 80 6.338 ns do 83 0.386 -0.1 54 5.875 ns table 3. departures from hardy-weinberg expectations of 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pgd were insignificant in all localities. ho = observed heterozygosity. n = sample size.

(1973) found genetic differentiation of the american eel a. rostrutu along the east coast of 47 chan et al. north america. koehn & williams (1978) further demonstrated that the latitudinal cline they observed in phi and sdh loci were temporally stable. in this study, we also detected genetic differentiation in a. japonica and found a comparable magnitude of dif- ferentiation (about 10% differences in allelic fre- quencies from 25"n to 40"n). williams et al. (1973) and koehn & williams (1978) made an excellent record of genetic differentiation in the american eel a. rosrrara. however, in their account of mainte- nance of the geographic cline, they assumed pan- mixia in these eels and attributed the observed ge- netic differentiation to effects of natural selection on a single generation. similarly, a single spawning ground of a. japonica has been found in the western pacific (tsukamoto, 1992). nevertheless, we did not favor the hypothesis of the existence of a panmitic eel population nor the maintenance of genetic dif- ferentiation by natural selection operating in a sin- gle generation. a. japonica inhabits a large geo- graphic area including china, korea and japan. it is unlikely that all the eels of different origins arrive at the spawning ground at exactly the same time. if they arrive at different times, they are likely to arrive at different points in the spawning ground since the spawning ground may span over several longitudi- nal degrees and the exact place of spawning may vary (otake & tsukamoto, 1994). by studying eel otoliths, tsukamoto ( 1990) suggested that the long estimated duration of the spawning season (april- november; 7 months) could not be caused by the counting error in age determination since the latter did not exceed 10% (about 20 days at most for glass eels) (tsukamoto & umezawa, 1990). tsukamoto & umezawa (1990) suggested that multiple subpop- ulations of adult eel might prolong the duration of estimated spawning season. in the light of otolith studies in recent years (tsukamoto, 1992; otake & tsukamoto, 1994), we know that spawning of eels is not single event but take place in different area within the spawning ground at different times, depending on the origin of the spawning eels. clear correspondence was ob- served between birth and the time of arrival at the coast (tsukamoto, 1990; umezawa, 1991). although our results did not favor the hypothesis that natural selection play a very significant role in the maintenance of geographic cline (lack of devia- tion from hwe and all samples were the glass eel stage instead of adults), the role of natural selection cannot be excluded, especially in the establishment of the geographic cline in the first circumstance. co- incidentally, both phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and nadp-isocitrate dehydrogenase, which are found to have latitudinal cline in allelic frequencies in this study, are also important enzymes related to 48 cold acclimation in a. japanica (chan et al., 1993). both enzymes generate nadph which is an impor- tant co-enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. it is still to be determined whether this coincidental observations have any thermal adaptative significance, especially during winter in northern latitudes. therefore the maintenance of the geographic cline may have some adaptive significance related to the survival of the species in different geographic area. nevertheless, the complete random mixing of genes in a. jupon- ica, which inhabit such a large and heterogeneous geographic area, and the maintenance of geographic cline by the sole action of large scale selective mor- tality is unlikely. as evidenced from otolith studies (otake & tsukamoto, 1994), genetic differentiation may be maintained through partial isolation which can be a result of temporal and/or spatial differentia- tion in the utilization of the spawning ground. resumen 1. isozymas de 400 angulas de 4 localidades seleccionadas a lo largo de la costa este de asia, desde taiwan haste el rio yula en el noreste de china, fueron estudiados utilizando starch-gel electroforesis. encontramos un cline geogrifico en dos loci: nadp-isocitrato deshydrogenasa-1 y 6-fosfogluconato deshy- drogenasa. 2. las frecuencias de 10s alelos mis comunes de estos dos loci aumentaron de sur a norte. en el rango latitudinal de 10s 25"n a 10s 40"n, la magnitud de la diferencia de idh100 y pgdl 00 fu- eron 13 y 19% respectivamente. sin embargo, ]as desviaciones del equilibrio de hardy-winberg fueron encontradas ser no sig- nificativas para ambos loci en tres de ]as cuatro localidades. por ello, es improbable que el cline sea resultado de la selecci6n. sugenmos que migraciones en penodos de tiempo distintos desde distintas partes del continente a las zonas de reproducci6n en el pacific0 occidental pueden ser las responsables de la for- macidn de este cline. acknowl ed u e m e n t we would like to thank prof. h. l. wu of shanghai fisheries university and prof. y. h. xie of research institute for fresh- water fisheries of liaoning province for their arrangements for sampling in mainland china. references chan, d. k. o., wong, a. 0. l. & wong, c. k. c. 1993. envi- ronmental adaptation of the eel -
