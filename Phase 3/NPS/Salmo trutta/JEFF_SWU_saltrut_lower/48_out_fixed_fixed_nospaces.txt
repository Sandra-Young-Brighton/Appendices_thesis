(langerhans different local environmental conditions have often been found to generate phenotypic diversity, which from either genetic differentiation or may result phenotypic plasticity 2004; andersson et al. 2006; sharpe et al. 2008). when phenotypic diversity (independent of its origin) repre- sents an adaptive response to a constant selection pressure, new traits may evolve and become geneti- cally assimilated (sultan & spencer 2002; price et al. 2003). one important structuring force in freshwater communities is predation (eklo¨v & hamrin 1989; langerhans et al. 2004; sharma & borgstro¨m 2008). most predators hunt selectively (moodie et al. 1973; christensen & persson 1993; kishida & nishimura 2005; bell & sih 2007), inﬂuencing not only species assemblage but also the distribution and abundance of phenotypes within species (kishida & nishimura 2005; bell & sih 2007). in many taxa, the morpho- logical characters of the prey are important factors determining the outcome of predator-prey interactions (ﬁsh: nilsson et al. 1995; lundvall et al. 1999; domenici et al. 2008; amphibian larvae: kishida & nishimura 2005; cladocera: swaffar & o‘brien 1996; kolar & wahl 1998). furthermore, the presence or absence of a predator as well as differences in predator assemblages have been shown to lead to morpholog- ical differences between populations (pettersson et al. 2001; langerhans et al. 2004; kishida & nishimura 2005; kishida et al. 2007). for example, crucian carp (carassius carassius) developed a deeper body (bro¨n- mark & pettersson 1994) in the presence of pike (esox lucius), which is an advantage when confronted with gape-limited piscivores (nilsson et al. 1995; domenici et al. 2008). similarly, langerhans et al. (2004) found doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00400.x 163 heynen et al. features that morphological differences between populations of western mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia afﬁnis) that experi- ence different levels of predation pressure, where the ﬁsh from populations with higher predation pressure exhibited morphological facilitate increased acceleration, which in turn increased escape speed and therewith survival (domenici 2003; lan- gerhans et al. 2004). however, predators can also have a variety of indirect effects on prey that could potentially lead to evolutionary responses (lima 1998). eklo¨v & svanba¨ck (2006) demonstrated that a change in predation risk in varying habitats caused shifts in behaviour of the prey that, in turn, affected the prey’s morphology. therefore, to disentangle the genetic and environmental contribu- tions and their components when investigating a highly plastic character like morphology. this permits a better understanding of the ongoing mechanisms and operating dynamics that promote the observed diver- siﬁcation (crispo 2008; sharpe et al. 2008). is important it investigating nutritional effects in a comparison of ﬁve lakes in northern sweden, magnhagen & heibo (2004) demonstrated that body depth and dorsal ﬁn ray length in young-of-the-year (yoy) perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) were positively correlated with the relative predation risk posed by pike. in juvenile perch using ﬁsh from the two lakes that showed the biggest differences in size-speciﬁc predation risk, borcherding & magnhagen (2008) observed morpho- logical head and body depth differences between the two populations that persisted even after changes in food availability. these ﬁndings raised the question as to whether the observed morphological differences might have a genetic basis, created by the differences in size-speciﬁc predation risk (magnhagen & heibo 2004; magnhagen 2006; borcherding & magnhagen 2008). we reared juvenile perch from lake fisksjo¨n and lake a¨ ngersjo¨n in a predator-free common garden setup to study the morphological variations among the pond perch and to compare the results with analyses of yoy ﬁsh that were collected from the wild. assuming stable population structures and therewith constant differences between both lakes, we expected to ﬁnd the same morphological differences between the wild perch as in previous studies. if these morphological differences are heritable, then they should be main- tained under common-garden rearing. such results would indicate that differences in size-speciﬁc preda- tion pressure generated by the same predator species create heritable morphological differences. addition- ally we are taking into account the diet of the ﬁsh in the different environments, which has earlier been shown to strongly inﬂuence morphology (e.g., hjelm et al. 2001). thus, we could evaluate to what extent genetic and plastic predator related effects and dietary 164 effects actually inﬂuence the morphological patterns observed in the ﬁeld. material and method the study populations we used yoy perch originating from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n and lake fisksjo¨n. both lakes are located near ume°a (63°47¢n; 20°17¢e), sweden. the perch populations in the two lakes were investigated earlier with regards to life history, population structure, behaviour, predation regimes and morphology (magnhagen & heibo 2001, 2004; heibo & magnhagen 2005; magnhagen 2006; borcherding & magnhagen 2008; magnhagen & borcherding 2008). the ﬁsh species composition is similar in the two lakes and dominated by perch, pike and roach (rutilus rutilus; magnhagen & heibo 2001). however, there are some differences in the ﬁsh communities that have been consistent over years (magnhagen & heibo 2001; magnhagen & borcherd- ing 2008; also conﬁrmed by test ﬁshing in 2008 hellstro¨m, g., heynen m., borcherding, j. & magnhagen, c. in preparation). lake fisksjo¨n has a high density of similarly sized, small perch while the perch population in lake a¨ ngersjo¨n has a more variable size distribution with generally larger perch (magnhagen & heibo 2001). in fisksjo¨n, the risk of cannibalism is, already at a length of 80 mm, only 50% of the risk at the most vulnerable size (magn- hagen & borcherding 2008). in contrast, in a¨ ngersjo¨n, the decrease in risk to 50% was reached ﬁrst at 120 mm (magnhagen & borcherding 2008). addi- tionally, pike (magnhagen & heibo 2001) and perch (borcherding, j. & magnhagen, c. unpublished data) have larger gapes, compared to the predators of equal length in lake fisksjo¨n. this generates a higher direct size-speciﬁc predation risk for perch of the analysed size in lake fisksjo¨n (magnhagen & borcherding 2008), but a longer size-speciﬁc predation window for the juvenile ﬁsh in lake a¨ ngersjo¨n (magnhagen & borcherding 2008). the two lakes are similar in size and morphology (lake a¨ ngersjo¨n: 1.45 km2 surface area, 0.9 m mean depth, 3.5 m maximum depth, lake fisksjo¨n: 0.75 km2, 1.9 m, 3.1 m), in productivity (lake )1 a¨ ngersjo¨n: 21 lgæl total p;

stony brook, ny, usa). all following analyses were performed with integrated morphomet- rics package (imp) developed by sheets (which is available at: http://www2.canisius.edu/~sheets/morph soft.html; buffalo, ny, usa). all specimens were transformed to the same baseline orientation and length, using imp software coordgen6 (buffalo, ny, usa). nonshape-variations were removed, using the procrustes superimposition option of the imp software. this involved rescaling and rotating the raw conﬁgurations to minimise the sum of squared errors (i.e., the offset between corresponding landmarks) between forms (see webster et al. 2001 and references therein). shape differences between groups were analyzed with a canonical variates analysis (cva). using the software cvagen6 (buffalo, ny, usa), partial warp scores were computed and a manova (wilk’s lambda value p < 0.05) followed by a cva was conducted. cvagen6 was also used to visualise the cvaplot and the morphometric distinction along the signiﬁcant cva axes as vectors on landmarks. statistics the t-tests to compare the conditional variables and the mann–whitney u-tests to analyse diet differences table 1. catch date, origin, hatching place, n per group, condition factor (mean ± sd), weight [g] (mean ± sd) and length [mm] (mean ± sd) for all perch used in the different analyses of the presented study. analysis catch date origin hatched morphology morphology morphology morphology morphology morphology morphology morphology stomach content stomach content stomach content stomach content 04.09.2007 12.09.2007 04.09.2007 12.09.2007 10.09.2008 03.09.2008 10.09.2008 03.09.2008 10.09.2008 08.09.2008 10.09.2008 05.08.2008 a¨ ngersjo¨n a¨ ngersjo¨n fisksjo¨n fisksjo¨n a¨ ngersjo¨n a¨ ngersjo¨n fisksjo¨n fisksjo¨n a¨ ngersjo¨n a¨ ngersjo¨n fisksjo¨n fisksjo¨n pond wild pond wild pond wild pond wild pond wild pond wild n 21 20 22 23 20 21 20 20 23 20 27 16 condition factor weight [g] length [mm] 0.90 ± 0.07 0.88 ± 0.07 0.92 ± 0.07 0.88 ± 0.06 0.96 ± 0.08 0.94 ± 0.05 1.06 ± 0.09 0.95 ± 0.07 0.99 ± 0.08 0.89 ± 0.06 1.05 ± 0.09 0.92 ± 0.11 2.31 ± 0.38 1.61 ± 0.27 2.63 ± 0.62 1.94 ± 0.38 1.89 ± 0.73 1.72 ± 0.35 1.81 ± 0.69 1.94 ± 0.38 2.22 ± 1.7 1.39 ± 0.3 1.74 ± 0.69 0.94 ± 0.33 63.5 ± 3.6 56.6 ± 3.2 65.4 ± 5.3 60.3 ± 3.6 57.3 ± 6.9 56.6 ± 3.9 54.9 ± 5.9 58.8 ± 3.3 57.7 ± 12.2 53.6 ± 3.7 54.3 ± 6.3 46.1 ± 4.36 165 heynen et al. were performed using spss 17 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). all statistic morphological analyses were performed with integrated morphometrics package (imp) developed by sheets (which is available at: http://www2.canisius.edu/~sheets/morphsoft.html;

cva not (fig. 1, eigen- value = 0.958). comparing the wild and pond perch from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n or lake fisksjo¨n, always revealed one signiﬁcant cv axis (p < 0.0001). the pond-perch originating from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n devel- oped an overall deeper body and a relatively shorter head than their conspeciﬁcs from the wild (fig. 2, a¨ ngersjo¨n; cva: k = 0.13, v2 = 130.01, d.f. = 32, p < 0.001, eigenvalue = 6.6). we found similar dif- ferences between the pond and wild perch from lake fisksjo¨n (fig. 2, fisksjo¨n; cva: k = 0.1, v2 = 152.5, d.f. = 32, p < 0.001, eigenvalue = 8.7). the pond perch originating from lake fisksjo¨n were also deeper bodied, but had a relatively longer head than their wild conspeciﬁcs. diet the pond ﬁsh that were used for stomach content analyses were of similar size and condition as the pond perch used for the morphological analyses. unfortunately, as the original stomach samples for the wild ﬁsh were accidentally destroyed, we used samples from slightly different dates (table 1). thus, the wild perch used for the stomach content analyses were smaller than their conspeciﬁcs used for the morphometric analyses (table 1). the stomach con- tent analyses showed clear differences between the diet in the pond and the lakes. the perch hatched in the pond fed nearly exclusively on benthic prey, mainly insect larvae and benthic cladocerans, while the wild perch primarily consumed zooplankton (b) wild : fisksjön ängersjön ) 3 – 0 1 ( x i 2 s x a v c  ) 3 – 0 1 ( x 2 i s x a v c  wild: ängersjön fisksjön pond: ängersjön fisksjön 4 2 0 –2 –4 4 2 0 –2 –4 –8 –6 –4 4 6 8 pond : fisksjön ängersjön 0 –2 cv axis 1 x (10–3) 2 fig. 1.

the morphological differences between the wild perch are in accordance with the results from previous studies (borcherding & magnhagen 2008), but the morphological differences were not maintained under common-garden rearing. the most striking morphological differences between the wild yoy perch from the two lakes occurred in the anterior part of the body, with the perch from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n having a relatively larger head and gape than the ﬁsh from lake fisksjo¨n. wild yoy and 1+ perch studied in 2006 (borcherding & magnhagen 2008) showed the same morphological head differences between the juvenile perch from indicating relatively stable the two populations, differences between the two lakes. however, the morphological differences we found between the wild yoy perch from the two populations were not maintained under common hatching and rearing conditions. direct comparison of the wild and pond perch from the two lakes seems to further conﬁrm phenotypic plasticity as the major source of the differences in head morphology. while the pond perch from lake fisksjo¨n developed a larger head and gape than their wild conspeciﬁcs, the pond perch from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n had a smaller head and gape than their conspeciﬁcs caught in the wild. previous studies showed that differences in mor- phology of the head in ﬁsh are often related to differences in diet (heermann et al. 2007; heynen, m. & borcherding, j. unpublished data) and ⁄ or status of nourishment (borcherding & magnhagen 2008). for example, under-nourishment and ⁄ or a planktivorous 167 heynen et al. diet have been shown to induce phenotypes with relatively large heads and gapes (borcherding & magnhagen 2008; heynen, m. & borcherding, j. unpublished data). we did not ﬁnd any differences in diet between the wild perch that would explain the difference in head morphology, nor were there any differences in length, weight or condition factor between the analysed groups of wild or pond perch in our study. however, we can not rule out the possibility that the size differences between the group used for morphometric analysis and the group used for stomach content analysis inﬂuenced the results, e.g., that ﬁsh of different size consumed different prey. direct comparison between the wild and pond perch from the two populations also revealed plastic effects associated with rearing environment (pond vs. lake). most obviously the pond-reared perch had a deeper body than the wild-caught perch, independent of origin. these differences were probably driven by resource and structural differences between the shallow pond with its mainly littoral habitats and the pelagic-dominated lakes. correspondingly the diet of the pond perch was dominated by benthic prey, while the perch caught in the lakes mainly consumed plankton. in many ﬁeld studies and experiments juvenile perch were shown to exhibit a trophic polymorphism with a more slender pelagic form feeding mainly on zooplankton and a deeper-bodied littoral form feeding mainly on macroinvertebrates (hjelm et al. 2001; eklo¨v & svanba¨ck 2006). how- ever, in aquaria it was shown that perch also react morphologically to predator presence in that individ- uals that were exposed to a pike predator became more deep-bodied than control ﬁsh held in predator absence (eklo¨v & jonsson 2007). the pond and lakes in our study differ in their predation intensity, with the pond being free from predators, but producing the deeper- bodied ﬁsh. these ﬁndings indicate that the plastic morphological response to different resources is much stronger than the response to predator cues and even seems to overrule potential predator-induced responses, supporting the results of eklo¨v & svanba¨ck (2006). they demonstrated that differences in preda- tion risk in different habitats may cause shifts in behaviour of the prey which, in turn, affect the prey’s morphology. the authors suggested that differences in body depth between habitats with different predation risks do not primarily stem from a direct reaction to predator cues, but more likely reﬂect an indirect effect of habitat and resource shifts (eklo¨v & svanba¨ck 2006). in the present study we found some differences in body depth between the wild yoy perch, but not between the pond perch from the two populations. in accordance, magnhagen & heibo (2004) found that body depth and dorsal ﬁn ray length in yoy perch were positively correlated with the relative predation 168 risk from pike. similar body depth patterns were also found in 2006, when perch also slightly differed in their resource use, with wild perch from lake a¨ ngersjo¨n having a more benthic diet than the yoy perch from lake fisksjo¨n (borcherding, j. & magnhagen, c. unpublished data). although body depth differences of yoy perch seem to be constant between the two lakes, our results indicate that they do not have a heritable basis, but seem to stem mainly from a plastic response to different environmental conditions in the two lakes. the it morphological inﬂuenced by direct traits are not reaction to the risk of cannibalism, but probably stem from a combination of different environment charac- teristics, including resource and habitat use, and the density of other piscivores, such as pike. is clear that the results of in conclusion, the present study indicate that the morphological differences between the yoy perch from two lakes with different size- speciﬁc predation risk are primarily attributed to phenotypic plasticity. furthermore, our results indicate that resource utilisation seems to contribute to mor- phological development to a greater extent than direct response to predation risk. acknowledgements we thank a˚ sa stenman and martin vestman for assistance in
