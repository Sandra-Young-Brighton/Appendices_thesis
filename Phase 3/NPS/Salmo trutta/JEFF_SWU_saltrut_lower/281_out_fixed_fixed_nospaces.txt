heggenes & saltveit 1990). habitat complexity (presence of shel- ters) also reduces competition among salmonids, allowing a better growth and limiting aggressive interactions (salmo_trutta, ho¨jesjo¨ et al. 2004; s. salar juveniles, gibson 2002; finstad et al. 2007). since the spatial and temporal variations of environment inﬂu- ence behavioural the relative reproductive success of each tactic should vary accordingly (andersson 1994). tactics, intrasexual competition generates some variance in the success of male breeders. the standard prediction is that the most competitive males will monopolise mating, thus decreasing reproductive success for low- ranking males. dominated males can nevertheless get access to fertilisation by choosing an alternative breeding tactic (andersson 1994). the coexistence of these tactics has been well studied in ﬁsh, particularly in salmonids (taborsky 1998; review in esteve 2005). in atlantic salmon, a variable proportion of the male parr, which may mature before realising their marine migration, use a sneaking tactic to get access to females (gross 1985; fleming 1996). gross (1991) suggested that environmental changes in reproductive habitat could inﬂuence the frequency of such conditional strategy tactics, as well as their success (see also fleming 1998). various studies have estimated the contribution to the fertilisation of eggs 510 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00421.x by atlantic salmon mature male parr, and shown very variable rates, from 27% to 65% (thomaz et al. 1997; martinez et al. 2000; taggart et al. 2001; saura et al. 2008). reproductive success is also known to be inﬂuenced by factors like density of precocious breeders or their body size (hutchings & myers 1988, 1994; thomaz et al. 1997). beall & de gaude- mar (1999) suggested that the presence of shelters would allow sneaking breeders of atlantic salmon to come close to the nest, and would favour their few experiments have reproductive success. but empirically tested the inﬂuence of habitat on repro- ductive tactics in salmonid species. thus, koseki et al. (2002) did not ﬁnd any habitat effect on the behaviour of spawning salvelinus_malma miyabei. the aim of this study was to estimate the repro- ductive success of mature male parr, in terms of their overall contribution to egg fertilisation, and to deter- mine the role of habitat complexity. habitat complex- ity was expected to diminish intrasexual competition, thus allowing a higher contribution of mature male parr, as well as an increase in the number of parr breeders in the redds. materials and methods the nivelle river, a small coastal stream in the southwest of france, holds a small population of atlantic salmon, which is monitored during the running season at ﬁsh traps on the uxondoa and olha dams (fig. 1), where morphometric measurements fig. 1. map of the catchment area of the nivelle river. (a) uxondoa dam with ﬁsh ladder and trap; (b–d) impassable dams equipped with a ﬁsh ladder and trap (b) or without (c, d). the study area is delimited by b, c and d. mature male parr success and shelters (length, body mass) are taken and various samples (scales, ﬁn tissue) collected before tagging and release of the ﬁsh. the juvenile population is routinely estimated by electroﬁshing censuses conducted in the fall (dumas & prouzet 2003). the study took place in the intermediate part of the nivelle river and in one of its tributaries, the lurgorrieta. three impassable dams (b, c & d in fig. 1) close a 14 km long stretch including the two rivers. detection of the redds the breeding activity (redd building) of atlantic salmon was monitored during the spawning season, from december 1, 2006 to january 26, 2007. every three days, the whole length of the study area was controlled by two observers who detected any new redd or any enlargement of an existing one. when a new redd was discovered, it was mapped, its gps position noted, and it was then marked with a metallic stake at its downstream limit to ﬁnd it easily later. when no modiﬁcation in the redd contours was detected during two visits in a row, it was considered as ﬁnished and another stake was placed at its upstream limit. sampling for genetic analysis the redd. water during this study, 37 redds were monitored and 12 of them were sampled. thus 563 eggs (48 eggs from each redd studied except for redd #12 where only 35 eggs were found) were collected during the eyed stage, i.e., after 250 cumulated day-degrees since the date of ﬁrst observation of temperature was recorded by vemco temperature data loggers placed on various sites of the nivelle river. this stage was chosen because the eggs are no longer sensitive to mechanical shock (prouzet & gaignon 1982). eggs were excavated by hand. a 1-m diameter circular bottomless tank was placed on the redd to reduce water ﬂow and increase visibility. the substrate was carefully removed stone by stone until an egg pocket was located, without trying to distinguish the different nests to minimise disturbance of the redd structure. forty-eight eggs were sampled in each redd and stored individually in eppendorf vials with 99% ethanol. the removed substrate was put back in place. all the anadromous salmon (15 females and 11 males) which went up in the study area were tissue- sampled for genetic analysis (adipose ﬁn clip, stored in 99% ethanol). in addition to those ﬁsh, the anadromous salmon which had crossed the downstream pass (a in fig. 1) were also analysed to make sure that none could have gone over the olha dam (during high ﬂows for instance) and contributed to spawning. 511 grimardias et al. microsatellite analysis for parental identiﬁcation dna was extracted from adipose tissue for the anadromous ﬁsh or from eggs using the wizard sv96 genomic kitò (promega, madison, wisconsin, usa). seven microsatellite loci were analysed by pcr– fragment size methodology: sssp1605, sssp2210, sssp2215, sssp2201, ssspg7 (paterson et al. 2004), ssosl417 (slettan et al. 1995) and ssa197 (o’reilly et al. 1996). pcr ampliﬁcations were performed at 54 °c using the hot start master mix kit (promega) containing approximately 0.1 lg of extracted dna template, and 0.35 lg of ﬂuorescently labelled primers. after 15 min of taq polymerase activation at 94 °c, 30 cycles were performed with denaturing (94 °c), annealing (54 °c) and extension (72 °c) during one minute each step. ampliﬁed products were size sepa- rated on a four capillary automated sequencer (applied biosystems 3100-avantò, applied biosystems, carls- bad, california, usa). allele size was estimated using genemapper 3.5 software. for each redd sampled, maternity was assigned to one of the females present in the study area, with the cervus 3.0 software (marshall et al. 1998; kalinowski 2007), under the hypothesis of one female per redd (conﬁrmed by the analyses). once the female was identiﬁed by a maximum likelihood method (ml), the colony 2.0 software (wang 2004) was used over all the eggs sampled in the river to group half-sib eggs (same mother) and sib eggs (same mother and father). the software assigned kinship by the ml method and provided the most probable paternal genotype. colony 2.0 software required the genetic structure of the studied population. it was determined from a sample of 50 parr caught in the nivelle river in october 2006. parr were tissue sampled and genotyped as described above. these theoretical paternal genotypes allowed assigning paternity directly to an anadromous male when a genotype was recognised and indirectly to mature male parr when it was not. manual veriﬁca- tions were made to check that only one male could be considered as potential father for each egg. in a few cases, there were mismatches probably due to different stochastic errors like those reported by o’reilly et al. (1998) and wang (2004): mutations, false alleles or allele miscalling during genotyping. if there was any doubt in the parentage, no parents were assigned. by this analysis, the contributions of anadromous and parr males were obtained, as well as the number of breeders (anadromous and parr) which fertilised the sample of eggs from each redd. characterisation of habitat complexity once the breeding activity was ﬁnished, 12 redds were selected to cover a large panel of habitat with different 512 levels of complexity. to precisely describe this complexity, different physical parameters were mea- sured at two different scales: over a large morpholog- ical unit such as a rapid, a rifﬂe or a ﬂat, named here mesohabitat, and over the immediate vicinity of the redd, named here the microhabitat. the mesohabitat was characterised with ﬁve tran- sects covering the whole width of the river bed. one transect ran across the redd, and four were placed at 5 and 10 m upstream and downstream, respectively (bain & stevenson 1999). at every meter on each transect, water depth was measured (nearest cm) as well as velocity (m s-1), using a ﬂow-meteró flo-mate model 2000 (marsh-mcbirney, inc., loveland, colorado, usa). the froude number, a dimensionless index, was calculated to characterise the water ﬂow regime and turbulences, which may provide hydraulic cover to parr (armantrout 1998). substrate composition (granulometry) was estimated by the wentworth method. the dominant class of substrate (sand, gravel, stone or blocks) was determined over each section of a 1-m long metallic chain divided into 10 sections, and the mean calculated over all the sections (cummins 1962; bain & stevenson 1999). the microhabitat was characterised within a 9 m2 quadrat centred on the dome of the redd. on each 1 m2 unit, one measure of granulometry, using the went- worth method, and three measures of water depth and velocity were taken at random. furthermore, any natural or artiﬁcial structure larger than 8 cm which could serve as shelter for parr (cobbles and boulders, woody debris, roots and metallic wastes, that is any element standing out of the substrate composed by sand and stones less than 8 cm in diameter) was counted, and its height and width measured. to take into account not only the number of shelters, but also their size, an index for the diversity of shelters was needed. thus, a shelter diversity index (sdi) was adapted from the shannon index, a diversity index derived from biodiversity (magurran 2004). this sdi considers the number of shelters (the number of species in a biotope in the original shannon index), and also the units of vertical cover surface of each shelter, in cm2 (integer, the number of individuals for each species in the original shannon index). following the original formula of the shannon index (magurran 2004), the shelter diversity index was calculated thus: x sdi ¼   ððsi=sþ  lnðsi=sþþ i where si is the cover surface provided by each shelter i (vertical cover surface = height · width), and s is the total vertical cover surface provided by all the shelters around the redd. in this formula, a value of 0 corresponds to a substrate without shelter, and a value tending toward inﬁnity indicates a habitat providing a high diversity of shelters. finally, since undercut banks could also be used as shelters, their width was measured at the redd level (in cm, noted 0 if there were none). statistical analysis patterns of habitat complexity were identiﬁed using a principal component analysis (pca) on the parameters characterising the habitat of the different redds. to investigate the relationship between habitat character- istics and reproductive success, the contribution of mature male parr and the number of precocious breeders for each redd were projected on to the factorial map of the pca, and the pattern of their disposition was analysed. this step of the analysis revealed which of the variables might explain the distribution of breeders in redds. the pca was performed with the grimmersoft statbox 6.6 software. the effect of each variable identiﬁed as possibly related was estimated by a model selection process using the akaike information criterion. linear models were computed, after logarithmic transformation of data to respect conditions of use, by adding one by one the variables (r models). because of the limited number of data (n = 12 redds), and since the number of parameters k provided a n ⁄ k ratio inferior to 40, the corrected akaike information criterion (aicc) was used to compare the adjustment of the r different models to the data set. the lowest aicc selected the best approximating model (burnham & anderson 2002): aic ¼  2 logðlikelihoodþ þ 2k and aicc ¼ aic þ 2kðk þ 1þ n   k   1 for interpretation, di and akaike weights (wi) were considered for the r models (burnham & anderson 2002): di ¼ aicc;

visscher et al. 2002; saura et al. 2008). however, the present results could have been biased by the small sample size due to the reduced population and the limited number of redds and eggs allowed by the sampling permit (a total of 600 eggs for the studied area, representing 2–2.5% of the total egg deposition). furthermore, the sampling method used to minimise disturbance of redds did not allow to clearly consider possible multiple spawning events in a given redd. thus, the results presented here may be more repre- sentative of the contributions to one spawning event than to the whole redd, and have to be considered with caution. however, by analysing one third of the monitored redds, about one third of the anadromous males and females present in the study area were detected, suggesting the sampling strategy was appro- priate. if this cannot be considered a strong support for the hypothesis that results were representative of the whole area, it suggested that the global contribution of table 3. summary of 11 models for the number of precocious breeders fertilising eggs on each redd, ranked by their corrected akaike information criterion values (aicc). model k loglik aicc di wi granulometry (mean on quadrat) sdi (shelter diversity index) shelters (number on quadrat) null model sdi + granulometry granulometry + shelters sdi + shelters sdi + granulometry + shelter granulometry * shelters sdi * granulometry sdi * shelter 2 2 2 1 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 )7.764 )8.187 )8.524 )10.148 )7.402 )7.555 )7.801 )7.009 )7.261 )7.302 )7.622 22.862 0.000 0.312 23.707 24.381 24.697 25.803 26.111 26.602 29.732 30.235 30.318 30.959 0.845 1.519 1.835 2.942 3.249 3.740 6.870 7.374 7.457 8.097 0.205 0.146 0.125 0.072 0.062 0.048 0.010 0.008 0.008 0.005 explaining variables (log-transformed data) are shown, as well as the number of parameters (k), the maximum likelihood (loglik), the aicc values, di = aicc,i–aicc,min, and akaike weights (wi). anadromous male ﬁsh was likely the one detected on the sampled eggs. the ﬁrst obvious result of this study was the low overall reproductive success of anadromous males (13%), maybe in relation to their low numbers, only 11 individuals for 15 females present in the studied area in 2006. moreover, the eggs analysed showed anad- romous paternity in only 5 of the 12 redds sampled in this study. in contrast, the rate of parr contribution is probably one of the highest reported to date. moran et al. (1996) observed parr contributions ranging from 24.7 to 89.3% in situations of varying parr densities, but those estimates concerned the eggs of a single female in an experimental set-up. in natural condi- tions, the contribution of male mature parr was estimated on the girnock burn at 10.8% on average, ranging from 0.9 to 27.7% on individual redds (jordan & youngson 1992). taggart et al. (2001) found over three years on the same stream a 40 to 50% contribution of parr. saura et al.

beall et al. 1997; martinez et al. 2001) have shown that mature male parr could successfully mate alone with an anadromous female, without any courting stimulus. furthermore, jones & hutchings (2001) provided evidence that the fertilisation success of parr increased with low competition intensity with anadromous males. thus, the very high reproductive success detected here could be explained by the low compe- tition pressure with anadromous males induced by their very small numbers in the study area. a second hypothesis suggests that hybridisation with male trout could have occurred. indeed, such an event has frequently been described, here and else- where (garcia de leaniz & verspoor 1989; beall et al. 1997; ayllon et al. 2004). trout males may have beneﬁted from the low number of anadromous male salmon and of the weaker competition to fertilise eggs deposited by female salmon. of the seven microsat- ellite markers used in this experiment, two are known to amplify in salmo_trutta (ssal97 and ssosl417). unfortunately the entire dna extracted from eggs had been fully utilised, and complementary analyses could not be made to test the ampliﬁcation of trout speciﬁc markers. however, a recent study showed that hybrid proportion in juvenile salmonids was no higher than 1% in the nivelle river in the years 1985-1995, and was null in 2004 (castillo et al. 2008). thus, even though hybridisation remains a possibility, is unlikely it could explain the high rate of unknown male contribution detected in this study. it the second objective of this study was to determine the role of habitat in the reproductive success of mature male parr. no relationship could be established 516 between the total contribution of parr and habitat complexity near the redds, mainly due to the 100% rate of fertilisation detected in most of these. however, habitat complexity may inﬂuence the number of breeders fertilising eggs in those redds. granulometry on the quadrat was retained in the aicc-selected model. furthermore, shelter diversity around the redd, included in the second-ranked model, may also have an inﬂuence on the number of breeders. this result is not surprising since the measure of granulometry also took the number of shelters and their size into account. thus, the presence of large particles (shelters) around the redd would allow a larger number of parr to contribute to egg fertilisation. the size of shelters was not directly studied due to the structure of the data which did not match the conditions of use for parametric tests. however, a non-parametric analysis revealed that shelter size seemed correlated to the number of precocious breeders (spearman correlation: s = 116.72, n = 12, p = 0.04). finally, the model including the number of shelters alone was only third- ranked, and its aicc value was close to the null model. thus, model selection with aicc showed an effect of habitat complexity on the sneaking tactic at the scale of the redd vicinity (microhabitat). but the akaike weight for the selected model is weak. relative to the weight of other models, the ratio of weights was 1.53 and 2.14 with respectively the second and third ranked model. furthermore, the akaike weight ratio between the aicc-selected model and the null model was small (2.50), suggesting that the shelter effect was not large, or that more samples were needed to clearly show this effect (only 12 redds studied). (2007) showed that habitat complexity could signiﬁcantly act on the reproductive success of mature male parr, conﬁrming gross’ hypothesis (1991). even though no shelter effect could be found on the overall contribution of parr, and thus on the competition between anadromous and parr males, as suggested by beall & de gaudemar (1999), richness of large particles (visual shelters) could modify intrasexual competition among parr, in the same way it affects food competition among juveniles. finstad et al. the availability of shelters (interstitial spaces in the substrate) is strongly correlated with the mass loss rates of atlantic salmon juveniles. thomaz et al. (1997) demonstrated that larger individuals generally monopolise access to the nest and egg fertilisation to the detriment of the smaller ones (see also for oncorhynchus_masou, watanabe et al. 2008). body size is the main determinant of the dominance hierarchy prevailing among parr (myers & hutchings 1987). even though jones & hutchings (2001) did not detect they provided some evidence that in absence of anadromous males individual parr size and reproductive success were such a relationship, however, correlated. thus, shelters might allow the smaller, less competitive parr avoiding aggressive interactions with the dominant male parr and contributing to spawning. further experiments are necessary to clearly understand how the complexity of habitat affects the mature male parr individual reproductive success. thus, since the linear relationship between number of breeders and granulometry around the redd explained only 33% of the variability, others factors might interact with habitat complexity to inﬂuence this number, such as density or aggressive interactions with anadromous individuals. no relationship between parr densities and the number of breeders detected in the different redd areas was found. the parr density estimates obtained in october, i.e., 2–3 months before reproduction, showed that all sections of the study area held mature male parr. however, the time lag between parr sampling and reproduction, and the fact that precocious males are capable of travelling long distances from rearing to spawning grounds (beall et al. 1994) would make it difﬁcult to test these relations. moreover, the role of shelters offered to parr during the feeding competition, increasing their density and growth performance, could explain the density found in october (gibson 2002; finstad et al. 2007). however, an increase in parr density favours their overall contribution with respect to that of anadromous males (hutchings & myers 1988; thomaz et al. 1997). the population of breeders was heavily skewed towards mature male parr (between 60 and 130 times more abundant than anadromous males), which could explain their high contribution. thus, the results of this study may be important for the conservation of the atlantic salmon population in the nivelle river, which presently shows very small runs of anadromous individuals. habitat complexity may have a beneﬁcial effect for the population. not only do shelters allow a better growth for more juveniles, but they also favour the presence of a larger number of breeders. in addition to the high contribu- tion of mature male parr, they may allow maintaining genetic variability by increasing multiple paternity and the effective size of breeders (l’abe´e-lund 1989; moran & garcia-vazquez 1998; martinez et al. 2000; jones & hutchings 2001). the combined effect of habitat complexity with the high contribution of mature male parr could forecast a better conservation of this endangered population (ryman 1991; finstad et al. 2007). but more studies are needed to extend the present ﬁndings to other small populations. acknowledgement this research was supported by the conseil ge´ne´ral des
