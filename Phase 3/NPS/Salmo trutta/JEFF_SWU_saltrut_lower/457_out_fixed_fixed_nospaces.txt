kuhlia malo; otolith sr ⁄ ca and ba ⁄ ca; femtosecond laser ablation icp-ms introduction volcanic islands in the paciﬁc ocean, such as in french polynesia, are geologically young environ- ments. colonisation of freshwater habitats commonly occurs by the invasion of marine ﬁsh species, via estuaries, or by diadromous species that are adapted for marine larval dispersal between freshwater habi- tats. thus, in french polynesian streams, diadromous species represent the major part of the native ichthy- ofauna (keith et al. 2002). also, these freshwater ﬁsh populations depend on strong larval marine dispersal for persistence among habitats. the perturbation regime occurring in freshwater habitats on these islands (i.e., ﬂoods and droughts, as well as anthro- pogenic disturbances such as ﬁshing) is so strong that marine dispersal to ensure recruitment when local reproduction is limited (macarthur & wilson 1963; robinet 2004). is essential the kuhliidae family has a tropical indo-paciﬁc distribution containing 12–13 species described in the single genus (kuhlia) (randall & randall 2001; loiselle & stiassny 2007). species of this genus occur in seawater and freshwater habitats (regan 1913; senou 1989). two freshwater species, kuhlia margin- ata (cuvier 1829) and kuhlia rupestris (lace´pe`de 1802) are considered to be catadromous (hogan & nicholson 1987; oka & tachihara 2001, 2008). four species are reported in french polynesia: kuhlia mugil (forster, 1801), kuhlia sandvicensis (steindachner, correspondence: p. feutry, de´partement milieux et peuplements aquatiques, biologie des organismes et ecosyste`mes aquatiques (umr cnrs-mnhn 7208), muse´um national d’histoire naturelle, cp-026, 43 rue cuvier, 75231 paris, france. e-mail: feutry@mnhn.fr 636 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00514.x 1876) and kuhlia petiti (schultz, 1943) are marine species and kuhlia malo (valenciennes, 1831), which is the only one found in streams of this archipelago, is presumed to be diadromous, but no studies have been published on its life history. because of habitat destruction and overﬁshing, kuhliidae representatives have become rare in many streams. knowledge on their life history is critical for their management and conservation (keith et al. 2002). in addition, freshwater species of the kuhlia genus are considered to be evolving from a strictly marine niche, and information on their migratory behaviour would be important to discussions concern- ing the evolution of catadromy (oka & tachihara 2001) and diadromy in general as well as for protecting the evolutionary potential of the genus. otolith microchemistry is a very common approach used to determine teleost migratory patterns (pontual & geffen 2002). otoliths are metabolically inert environmental recorders, and the detection of trace elements in their calciﬁed matrix has enabled the identiﬁcation of individual life history events (kalish 1989; radtke 1989). measurement of strontium ⁄ cal- cium ratio (sr ⁄ ca) is of particular interest for tracing migratory history between marine and freshwater environments. depending on bedrock geology, sr ⁄ ca in fresh water can be either lower (casselman 1982; kalish 1989, 1990; radtke 1989; secor 1992; secor kuhlia malo ﬂexible life history et al. 1995; tzeng et al. 1997) or higher (kraus & secor 2004; brown & severin 2009) than in marine water. more recently, barium ⁄ calcium ratios (ba ⁄ ca) have also been proven to be a useful indicator of habitat salinity from otolith chemistry (thorrold & shuttleworth 2000; elsdon & gillanders 2005a). the main objective of this study was to test whether diadromy exists in k. malo, based on the determina- tion of sr ⁄ ca and ba ⁄ ca ratios in cross-sectioned otoliths from adults, using femtosecond laser ablation inductively spectrometry (la-icp-ms). the ﬁndings provide basic life history information that is essential for habitat conservation and the protection of this species and a broader understanding of ﬁsh life history evolution in tropical island areas. plasma mass coupled materials and methods field study sampling was carried out in the society archipelago between june and july 2007 in three rivers from raiatea island and two rivers from moorea island (fig. 1;

(i.e., lower stream, table 1). the upper zone was located mid-way up on the original volcanic cone with steep slopes up to 10% (i.e., mid-stream, table 1). a total of 162 ﬁsh from these three zones were sampled by electroﬁshing using a deka 3000 (efko manufacturer, leutkirch, ger- )1, 350 v, 4–6 a. standard length (sl) many), 30 iæs of all specimens was measured to the nearest milli- metre with a digital calliper. a subsample of 60 ﬁsh, chosen randomly from captures in ﬁve streams of raiatea and moorea islands (table 1), were preserved whole in three successive 90% ethanol baths before otolith extraction. this procedure is considered to be robust by proctor & thresher (1998) as it only slightly affects ca and sr concentrations in otoliths. in addition, milton & chenery (1998) found that sr and ba concentrations did not differ signiﬁcantly between immediate extraction and extraction after specimen storage in ethanol for a minimum of 1 month. likewise, no effect of ethanol preservation or ethanol quality was found on sr and ba concen- trations in otoliths by hedges et al. (2004). otolith preparation after extraction, any organic material on otoliths was removed using an ultrasonic cleaner for 3–5 min. otoliths were rinsed with triple-distilled water and air- dried before being embedded in araldite 2020 epoxy resin (escil, chassieu, france). they were then sectioned with a diamond saw as close to the core region as possible along a frontal plane. the sections were mounted on glass slides with crystalbond thermoplastic adhesive and polished on both sides with grit wet–dry sandpaper of 15.3–10 lm (g1200 and g2400; escil) until the section was about 80– 100 lm thick and the core was exposed on one side. to remove any contaminant introduced during the sectioning and polishing processes, the superﬁcial layer of otoliths was removed using a 3-lm mesh diamond polishing disc (mdi 3; escil) followed by 638 ultrasonication in triple-distilled water. in addition, pre-ablation of the outermost surface (approximately 2 lm) over the designated track was undertaken using the laser just before analysis (wyndham et al. 2004). the laser followed the posterior axis of maximal growth (fig. 2). transect la-icp-ms strategy the la-icp-ms coupling used for otolith micro- chemistry analyses consisted of a femtosecond laser ablation system (alfamet, novalase sa – amplitude systemes, canejan, france) connected to an elan drc ii icp-ms (perkin elmer, waltham, ma, usa). it delivered 360 fs pulses at an ir wavelength of 1030 nm and was operated at a repetition of 500 hz. operating conditions are listed in table 2. otoliths 200 μm nucleus fig. 2. kuhlia malo otolith from the vaipapa river (frontal plane). dotted line from the nucleus to the edge indicates the laser ablation track over the posterior axis of maximal growth. black arrow indicates recruitment in estuaries. table 2. operating conditions for the femtosecond la-icp-ms. laser ablation instrumentation wavelength repetition rate energy on the sample sampling strategies plate speed carrier gas ﬂow (he) icp-ms instrumentation dual sample introduction system torch nebuliser spray chamber coolant gas ﬂow (ar) auxiliary gas ﬂow (ar) nebuliser gas ﬂow (he) isotopes internal standard dwell-time femtosecond laser (alfamet – novalase, france) 1030 nm 500 hz 9 ljæpulse)1 linear scan with a 20-lm laser beam 50 lmæs (ablation) )1 0.6 læmin )1 (pre-ablation), 5 lmæs )1 elan drc ii, perkin elmer )1 2 inlets – internal injector diameter 1.5 mm pneumatic concentric nebulizer 1 mlæmin bafﬂed cyclonic 15 læmin 1.2 læmin 0.6 læmin 138ba, 137ba, 87sr, 86sr 43ca 50 ms )1 )1 )1 were ablated across the striae from the core to the edge, with a laser beam size of 20 lm applied at a )1. this procedure has been described speed of 5 lmæs in detail by tabouret (2009). la-icp-ms standardisation )1) two calcium carbonate standards containing trace elements in expected concentrations of 100 and )1 were prepared by pressing 20 mg of dried 500 lgæg precipitate prepared by the method of barats et al.

fig. 3). elemental signature on otolith edge sr ⁄ ca ratio was an indicator of environmental seawa- ter concentrations in rivers. no signiﬁcant differences were found between river zones for the ba ⁄ ca ratios, but the sr ⁄ ca ratios were signiﬁcantly lower in the mid-stream zone than in the lower stream and the near- stream zones (p = 0.017;

(2010), )1). this is also consistent with the ratios (>4.5 lgæg found on the otolith margin of ﬁsh captured in the )1, ba ⁄ mid-stream course (sr ⁄ ca = 2.14 ± 0.27 mgæg )1; fig. 4). however, ratios ca > 180.67 ± 96.05 lgæg from the edge of otoliths of ﬁsh from the lower stream zone, which were sampled in fresh water, were signiﬁcantly higher than mid-stream values. in french polynesia, the lower stream zone is very short, and some ﬁsh caught there may have been in brackish water just before capture. the second combination of ratios in the outer otolith zone were characterised by a relatively high and unstable sr ⁄ ca ratio with a high ba ⁄ ca ratio. this combination is representative of estuarine hab- itats, which are chemically variable environments. high ba ⁄ ca ratios are inconsistent with sea water (campana 1999), and high and unstable sr ⁄ ca ratios are inconsistent with fresh water (campana 1999; brown & severin 2009). however, bath et al.

(1997), the negative relationship between salinity and bioavailable ba is not in an estuarine gradient, but only after it reaches a maxi- mum. this prevents the relationship being used to discriminate easily between fresh and brackish waters but facilitates the distinction between oceanic and terrestrial inﬂuences. for a better understanding, regular monitoring of water geochemical composition is required. linear migratory life history of k. malo life history of k. malo appears to be as follows. juveniles grow at sea until they reach an estimated sl of 23–28 mm and recruit into brackish water. juve- niles then adopt different patterns of residency. some stay in the estuary, others shift to fresh water, and some individuals may share their time between fresh and brackish waters later in their life. none of the ﬁsh analysed in this study present a marine chemical signature in the outer part of otolith. unfortunately, there is insufﬁcient evidence to infer whether repro- duction occurs in fresh, brackish or seawater. short- duration spawning movements to sea water may not be detected in these kind of proﬁles owing to both the decreased temporal resolution of the laser as the ﬁsh gets older (less material is accreted in the otolith with time) (jones 2000) and the potential lag in time to equilibration for otolith chemistry after movements across (20–21 days) (elsdon & gillanders 2005c; lowe et al. 2009). further research is necessary to test alternate hypo- theses of reproductive behaviour. salinity gradients signiﬁcant conclusion the ﬁndings of this study increase the prevalence of diadromy among french polynesian freshwater ﬁsh species. kuhlia malo probably spawns in fresh or brackish water although spawning in marine habitats cannot be discounted. the young move to the sea early in life and within a few months return to grow to maturity in estuarine and freshwater areas. as these habitats are under considerable pressure from human occupation, it is important that ﬁsheries managers and environmental planners provide for adequate protec- tion and conservation of these areas for the survival of this endemic ﬁsh species. acknowledgements we thank c.
