quinn & foote 1994; preziosi & fairbairn 2000). in addition, in butterﬂy (gotthard et al. 2000) and salmon (holtby & healey 1990) may have also evolved through sex-speciﬁc breeding selection. thus, sex-speciﬁc selection ap- pears to produce life history strategies peculiar to each sex. sex-speciﬁc mortality rates in several salmonid populations, sexual differences in feeding behaviour (e.g., holtby & healey 1990), mortality rate (holtby & healey 1990; spidle et al. 1998) and body size at maturity (e.g., beacham & murray 1985; jonsson 1989; quinn & foote 1994) have been reported. for example, holtby & healey 96 (1990) demonstrated that the sex ratio of coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch walbaum) caught with trolling gear at sea (i.e., with baited hooks or lures) became more biased to females in their ﬁnal summer before spawning. they interpreted the sex bias as indicating that females forage more aggressively than males. for the same age at maturity, males often tend to be larger in mean body size than females in paciﬁc salmon populations (beacham & murray 1985; blair et al. 1993). in some coho salmon populations, however, a higher mortality rate in females and a female-biased ssd co-occur (holtby & healey 1990; spidle et al. 1998). holtby & healey (1990) considered that these sexual differences would occur in coho salmon populations where breeding selection for larger adult size acts more strongly in females than in males because the sex-biased selection will lead females to an enhanced foraging behaviour with a concurrent increased risk but more rapid growth. thus, these that sex-speciﬁc ﬁndings in coho salmon suggest ‘breeding’ selection causes feeding behaviour, mortality rate and body size. sexual differences in after smolting) or after 1-seawinter masu salmon (o. masou brevoort), a species of paciﬁc salmon, distribute in far east asia. like other salmonids, many populations of masu salmon consist of migratory (sea-run or lake-run forms) females and males and also some ﬂuvial males (kiso 1995). the life cycle of migratory masu salmon is as follows: parr (juvenile ﬁsh) usually spend 1 or 2 years in rivers, then smolt in the spring and migrate to the sea or lake. after 1 year of migration phase (marine or lacustrine phase (or 1-lakewinter), they return to their natal streams and reproduce in the autumn. although jacks (precocious migratory males), which mature in the smolting year and thus do not winter in the sea or lake after smolting, occur in some masu salmon populations, such males are unusual for this species (tsiger et al. 1994; tamate & maekawa 2000b). all adults (including jacks) die after reproduction, i.e., migratory masu salmon are semelparous (kubo 1980; kato 1991; tsiger et al. 1994; tamate & maekawa 2000b). migratory adults range from about 30 to 70 cm in fork length (kato 1991; tamate & maekawa 2000a,b). the sex ratio of smolts (range 70–80% females) seems to be more skewed to females than that of anadromous adults (mean 65.9% females) in japanese (hokkaido) popu- lations (see kato 1991), suggesting that females might have a higher mortality rate during the migration- phase. in addition, sea-run adults often show a female- biased ssd within a population in japan (kato 1991; mayama 1992). within a masu salmon population, however, it has not been thoroughly investigated whether such sex-speciﬁc mortality rate and ssd co-occur. the aim of this study is twofold: (i) to examine in the migratory form (lake-run form) of a masu salmon female-biased traits in masu salmon population (shumarinai lake system) in japan whe- ther there are any sexual differences in mortality and growth during the migration-phase (lacustrine-phase); and (ii) to suppose the evolutionary process of these sexual difference. natural reproduction has maintained this population, unlike many other stocks in japan (the fishermen’s society at lake shumarinai, personal communication). we can therefore discuss whether sex-speciﬁc breeding selection under natural condi- tions is related to the sex-biased mortality and growth in the migratory masu salmon. materials and methods study population shumarinai lake, which is located in northern hokkaido, japan (fig. 1), was artiﬁcially constructed in 1943 by damming the upper reaches of the uryu river (ishikari river system) for hydroelectric power generation. masu salmon inhabiting the shumarinai lake system were originally land-locked (osanai 1962) and now reproduce mainly in four inlet streams, doro creek (dr), butokamabetsu creek (bt), bi- fukakoshizawa creek (bf) and moshiriunnai creek (ms) (t. tamate, unpublished data). these streams are approximately 3–10 m in width. in all inlet streams of the lake, capturing masu salmon has been prohibited by hokkaido government in masu salmon, all females become migratory (lake-run) ﬁsh while in males both migratory and ﬂuvial forms (mature parr) occur (tamate & maekawa 2000b). the life-cycle of the shumarinai masu salmon is similar to that of anadromous populations in japan (tamate & maekawa 2000b). the sex ratios of smolts and returning adults, and the body sizes of smolts and returning adults have been monitored in the lake since 1964. the shumarinai lake fig. 1. map of system. creek names and creek abbrevia- tions are shown for inlet streams (creeks) sampled. in these creeks, ‘bold line’ indicates each main stream. four 97 tamate & maekawa system over several years. we used these data here to test if sexual differences of mortality and growth occur during the lacustrine-phase. fish sampling smolts were captured in bf (fig. 1) by electroﬁshing, cast netting and angling in spring (mid-may–early july) from 1997 to 2001. lake-run adults were collected in four inlet streams (dr, bt, bf and ms, fig. 1) by electroﬁshing during the spawning season (late-august–mid-september) from 1997 to 2001. for all freshly sampled ﬁsh except two lake-run males in 1999 (measured as defrosted ﬁsh), fork length (fl, mm) and body mass (g) of each ﬁsh were measured. smolts were sexed by visual inspection of the gonads. sex of lake-run adults was judged by the sexual dimorphism of morphology (kato 1991). adults collected were measured in the hatchery of the fishermen’s society at lake shumarinai or in the ﬁeld, after being anaesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol. adults carried to the hatchery were killed after the measurement for other studies. adults measured in the ﬁeld were released after marking using plastic anchor tags to avoid re-measurement. scales were used to determine age. fish determined as potential jacks, which are 1+ male smolts with developed gonads and have the ability to mature at age 1+ (shimoda 2000), were excluded from the data analysis because jacks are unusual migratory form in the population studied (tamate & maekawa 2000b; see introduction) and no such precocious migratory form occur in female masu salmon (i.e., is impossible to test whether the mortality rate and body size of migratory ﬁsh maturing at age 1+ differ between the sexes). it statistical analyses in order to examine the sexual difference in mortality rates during the lacustrine life, the sex ratio (female ratio) was compared between 1+ smolts and 2+ lake- run adults (the returning adults) in bf by a two-way analysis of variance (anova) without replication. the sex ratio data (proportion of females) were arcsine square root transformed. the unit of transformed data (angle) is the degree (°). the sex ratio data (trans- formed data) of three cohorts (1998 cohort (1998 for 1+ smolts and 1999 for 2+ lake-run adults), 1999 cohort and 2000 cohort) were used for the anova (see table 1). the reason why only the data of 1+ smolts (or 2+ lake-run adults) is that in bf about 85% of smolts are age 1+ and about 88% of the lake-run adults mature at age 2+: in bf, thus, most migratory ﬁsh smolt at age 1+ and therefore mature at age 2+ as returning adults (see tamate & maekawa 2000b). the factors of this anova were ‘cohort’ and ‘ﬁsh’ (1+ smolts or 2+ lake- 98 table 1. arcsine square root transformed sex ratios of 1+ smolts and 2+ lake-run adults (three cohorts) caught in the bifukakoshizawa creek. cohort\ﬁsh 1+ smolts (n) 2+ lake-run adults (n) 1998 1999 2000 63.43 (30) 65.91 (12) 69.30 (16) 56.79 (20) 56.31 (13) 64.43 (20) the unit of the transformed data (angle) is the degree (°). the cohort when the sex ratio of 2+ lake-run adults is set indicates their smolting year (see text). run adults). the former and latter were considered as random and ﬁxed factors, respectively. years (f3,9 ¼ 0.398;

fleming & gross 1994). for breeding success of males in salmonids, although larger males usually seem to be more advantageous than smaller ones (e.g., fleming 1996), the difference (fertilization success) between larger and smaller males varies with ecological factors affecting the male–male competi- tion, e.g., the density of competitors (fleming & gross 1994). holtby & healey (1990) hypothesized for coho salmon populations with female-biased ssd that sexual selection on male body size (favouring larger males) is weak, i.e., small and large males have similar breeding success. in the breeding behaviour of male masu salmon, yamamoto & edo (2002) observed that migratory males compete intensively among them- selves but do not frequently interact with mature male parr. this suggests in masu salmon that the male–male competition among migratory males mainly shapes the pressure of sexual selection on adult size of migratory males: the more intensive competition is, the larger males the selection favours. sexual selection favouring larger migratory males will therefore be weaker in populations with lower competition among migratory males. in migratory populations of masu salmon where mature male parr frequently occur (as typically occurs in japanese populations), breeding competition among migratory males is probably low because the sex ratio of migratory spawners is biased to females. it is also likely in the shumarinai population, where mature male parr (tamate & maekawa 2000b), that the male–male competition is low (i.e., sexual selection for larger size in migratory males is weak); the sex ratio (females: males) of all lake-run adults including jacks collected (n ¼ 227) during 1997–2001 was 1 : 0.67 (t. tamate, unpub- lished data) although migratory males of the same age have a higher survival rate during the lacustrine phase than females. in addition, as the density (or number) of migratory spawners in this population seems to be very low (y. koseki, unpublished data), this ‘low density’ might also reduce the male–male competition (holtby & healey 1990). these considerations suggest that in the population studied, breeding selection for larger adult size acts more strongly in females than in males. frequently occur this breeding selection will require females to undertake a more active feeding ‘during the migration female-biased traits in masu salmon phase’ because adult sizes in migratory salmonids mainly depend on growth in the sea or the lake. although there is no direct information on sex-speciﬁc foraging behaviour for shumarinai lake, the sex ratio of ﬁsh (potential migratory adults) caught by angling with bait or lures in the lake during 1997–2001 was signiﬁcantly more female biased than that of smolts collected in bf during 1998–2001 (t. tamate, unpublished data). this suggests that females forage more intensively in shumarinai lake. more active foraging behaviour may be susceptible to higher predation risk (mittelbach & chesson 1987). in shumarinai lake, predator abundance is probably low because marine mammal species, which are a primary predator on anadromous salmon (fiscus 1980), are not present. however, angling has been conducted intensively in this lake. fishing pressure during the lacustrine phase may be more intense on females than on males. the other likely explanation is that the maintenance of faster growth (i.e., more intense foraging behaviour) involves more substantial costs in terms of energy losses (nicieza & metcalfe 1999): the more intense foraging of females may be more susceptible to energy losses. especially under severe growth conditions (e.g., low food density or lower water temperature than that appropriate for growth), active feeding behaviour seems to increase the risk of energy losses (metcalfe et al. 1988; metcalfe & thorpe 1992). shumarinai lake has severe growth conditions for masu salmon, probably because of low production of japanese smelt (hypo- mesus nipponensis mcallister – a typical food species of lacustrine masu salmon) and low water temperature for long periods (the lake freezes over for about half of the year). this is also reﬂected by the extremely small body size of migratory adults in this population compared with migrants of other populations (tamate & maekawa 2000a,b). severe growth conditions in the lake may lead to the higher mortality rate of females. in conclusion of this paragraph, we suppose that irrespective of sex, individuals foraging more actively are more susceptible to ﬁshing pressure or energy loss than ones foraging less actively. the higher mortality rate of females found seems to be attributable to the more active foraging of females. individuals susceptivity of these costs of active foraging behaviour (or the higher foraging more actively to ﬁshing pressure or energy loss) are synonymous with ‘the reverse selection’ for individ- uals attempting rapid growth during the migration phase. this reverse selection may equally operate in both sexes (act irrespective of sex) and then favour the similar ‘maximum body size’ in both sexes (holtby & healey 1990). in the population studied, therefore, if the intensity of breeding selection for larger adult sizes did not differ between the sexes, stabilizing selection 101 tamate & maekawa on adult body size (the reverse selection + breeding selection) would not vary with sex, and then no sex- speciﬁc foraging strategy or no sex-speciﬁc mortality rate and adult size would occur. it is thus plausible that the female-biased mortality rate and ssd found in this study is ultimately attributed to sex-speciﬁc breeding selection that favours a larger size for females than for males. in spite of the costs of active foraging, females during the lacustrine phase may forage more inten- sively to acquire larger body sizes, likely because of the sex-speciﬁc selection favouring a larger size for females than for males. the sexual difference of feeding behaviour will establish sexual differences in mortality schedule and growth pattern. the more intensive foraging of females may therefore proxi- mately cause the female-biased mortality and ssd in masu salmon inhabiting the shumarinai lake system. in salmonids, the co-occurrence of female-biased mortality rate and ssd has been found only in coho (holtby & healey 1990; spidle et al. 1998) and masu (salmo salmon (this study). female brown_trout trutta l.) are more pelagic than males are, i.e., female trout seem to forage more risky than males do (because risk of predation is much greater in pelagic than in epibenthic areas), but acquire larger size than males in some populations (jonsson & gravem 1985; jonsson 1989). like some previous studies, our report on female-biased traits in masu salmon is also helpful the progress of evolutionary ecology because our study throws light on the evolution of sex-speciﬁc traits. in addition, our ﬁndings seem to have important implications for stock management of salmonid populations because sex-speciﬁc data on mortality and adult size are useful for grasping the stock recruitment or the population dynamics. although some researches on the female-biased traits in salmonids have been performed, the evolutionary (ultimate) and proximate factors remain unclear as yet. in future, in salmonid populations, sex-speciﬁc breeding selection on body size should be kept our eyes on as the ultimate factor of the sex-biased mortality and body size. in addition, the proximate factor of such sexual differences would be clariﬁed by the examination of sex-speciﬁc foraging behaviour (e.g., in diel activity period, susceptivity to ﬁshing pressure and responses to predator) during the migration phase, as spidle et al. (1998) suggested. sexual differences for resumen 1. en muchos animales, algunas caracterı´sticas biolo´ gicas a menudo diﬁeren entre sexos. muchos estudios previos han atribuido tales diferencias sexuales a seleccio´ n especı´ﬁca del sexo. examinamos procesos evolutivos de caracterı´sticas espe- ciﬁcas del sexo, analizando si la mortalidad y el crecimiento 102 durante la fase migratoria (fase de lago despue´s de la esmoltiﬁcacio´ n) diﬁrieron entre sexos en individuos migratorios del salmo´ n oncorhyncus masou de una poblacio´ n lacustre del norte de hokkaido (japo´ n). 2. la proporcio´ n de sexos en smolts de edad 1+ parecio inclinarse a favor de las hembras que hacia los adultos de vuelta en tres cohortes examinadas, indicando que las hembras tienen una mayor mortalidad durante la fase de migracio´ n. aunque no hubo diferencia en la longitud entre ambos sexos, las hembras adultas fueron mayores en la longitud corporal que los machos de la misma edad, es decir, existio´ dimorﬁsmo en el taman˜ o sexual. 3. planteamos como hipo´ tesis que la seleccio´ n reproductiva, al favorecer un mayor taman˜ o corporal para las hembras que para los machos en esta poblacio´ n, probablemente requiera que las hembras asuman un comportamiento de forrajeo ma´s intenso durante la fase de migracio´ n. parece por ello ma´s probable que la seleccio´ n sea la causa u´ ltima de las mayores tasas de mortalidad y dimorﬁsmo en el taman˜ o en las hembras. acknowledgements for we thank the members of the fishermen’s society at lake shumarinai, especially n. nakano and s. tada, their
