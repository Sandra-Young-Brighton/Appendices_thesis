schleuter & eckmann 2007) and the potential for competition between two members of the pelagic ﬁsh community of lake constance perch, perca ﬂuviatilis l., and burbot, lota lota (l.), may have increased. while prefer- ences for similar zooplankton prey taxa by perch and burbot are described (hartmann 1983, 1986; wang & appenzeller 1998), no attempt has been made to quantify the potential for exploitive competition between both species during their pelagic stage. for this endeavour, the analysis of diet overlap provides an approach to quantify the common resource use of different (schoener 1971; bowen 1996; schleuter & eckmann 2007). species or individuals during their earliest life-history stages, young-of- the-year (yoy) perch and burbot co-exist in the pelagic zone of lake constance (wang & appenz- eller 1998; miler & fischer 2004). whereas perch larvae migrate from the littoral towards the pelagic doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00367.x 527 probst & eckmann start zone within a few days after hatch (wang & eckmann 1994), burbot larvae migrate from the lake profundal towards the surface waters (fischer 1999). both species can be found in the pelagic zone between may and july. from the beginning of june burbot to perform diel vertical migrations (dvm) and by july achieve considerable amplitudes of more than 50 m (miler & fischer 2004; probst & eckmann 2009). contrary to burbot, yoy perch always remain in epilimnetic waters and are rarely found below 10 m depth (wang & appenzeller 1998). perch perform an ontogenetic niche shift as juveniles, when they migrate towards the littoral zone in july (wang & eckmann 1994). the feeding periodicities of both species indicate that perch feed during the day and crepuscular hours (wang 1994a,b), whereas burbot seem to feed mainly around dusk. due to the dvm of burbot, the spatial overlap between yoy perch and burbot during feeding hours, which is a prerequisite for interference competition, is conﬁned to daylight hours in may and early june. however, both species may exploit the same zoo- plankton resources. that during the ontogeny of both species, it is reasonable to expect the magnitude of diet overlap will decrease, because both species will overcome the gape size limitation for large zooplankton taxa and thus become able to diversify their diet. a more diverse spectrum of ingestible prey increases the potential for individual specialisation, which may reduce intra- as well as interspeciﬁc competition (bolnick et al. 2003; svanba¨ck & eklov 2003). however, because of their faster growth perch overcome gape size limitation for each taxon earlier than burbot (wang & appenzeller 1998). as a consequence, the diet overlap should decrease when perch overcome gape size limitation for taxa, which burbot cannot yet ingest and increase, when burbot becomes able to feed on the same resource as perch. the aim of this study was to assess the diet overlap between perch and burbot during their larval and early juvenile life-history stages and to capture the temporal dynamics of diet overlap under various constellations of gape size limitation. we expected to ﬁnd periods of higher and lower diet overlap according to the gape size limitations of both species. furthermore, the intraspeciﬁc diet overlap of both species was assumed to decrease as their diet spectrum increased. the multivariate methods applied in this study also allow the analysis of intraspeciﬁc diet overlap within both species, which especially for yoy perch may be of major impor- tance, as in the middle of the summer perch are the most abundant species in many parts of the pelagic zone of lake constance (wang & appenzeller 1998). 528 materials and methods study site )1 to more than 80 lgæl lake constance is the second largest prealpine lake in central europe. it has a total surface area of 536 km2 and a maximum depth of 254 m (igkb 2008a,b). since the 1950s the loading of total phosphorous had )1 in increased from <10 lgæl the mid-1980s (mu¨rle et al. 2004). to overcome the problem of eutrophication in lake constance, nutrient loadings were reduced since the 1970s by lake-wide installations of sewage plants and the introduction of phosphorous-free detergents. consequently, the con- tent of total phosphorous has decreased to about )1 since the mid-1980s (igkb 2008a,b). the 8 lgæl reduction of nutrient loading has been demonstrated to affect lake whiteﬁsh growth (thomas & eckmann 2007), and may have caused a decline of invasive ruffe (schleuter 2007), but the inﬂuence on zooplankton dynamics remains uncertain. while gaedke (1998) did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant changes in zooplankton crustacean biomass by 1998, bu¨rgi et al. (2006) report the declines of zooplankton biomass during spring and summer since the 1990s. the pelagic ﬁsh community of lake constance is dominated by lake whiteﬁsh, coregonus_lavaretus l., which is also the commercially most important ﬁsh species (thomas & eckmann 2007). however, besides whiteﬁsh, perch and burbot are the only two ﬁsh species, which utilise the pelagic zone as a nursery habitat as larvae and juveniles (wang & appenzeller 1998). while perch is the second most important species for commercial ﬁshing, burbot is caught in low quantities of <5 t per year (klein 2002). fish sampling and diet analysis fish larvae and juveniles were caught every second to third week between may and august on ﬁve occasions in 2006 and on seven occasions in 2007. during each occasion, sampling was conducted at day (around noon) and night (around midnight). for detailed description of catch methods, see probst & eckmann (2009) and probst et al. (2009). to catch yoy perch and burbot, two different net types were used: (i) three-meter long ichthyoplankton nets with a circular opening of 1.4 m diameter were used to catch larvae and early juveniles of both species. mesh sizes of the two nets were 1200 ⁄ 800 and 1600⁄ 1200 lm in the front and the rear end respectively. the ichtyoplankton nets were attached to a 160-m-long tow line of 10 mm diameter. (ii) a fry- net of 8 m length with 6 mm mesh size in the front and 4 mm mesh size at the cod end was used to catch perch juveniles in july ⁄ august 2006 and july 2007. in 2006, all nets were ﬁtted with a ﬂow meter to calculate the sampled volume of the water body. unfortunately no ﬂow meter was used in 2007 and thus quantitative data on perch and burbot abundance are lacking from this year. to adjust the trawl depth (from surface to 25 m depth), appropriate weights were attached. for towing depths > 10 m, a hydrodynamic v-ﬁn with 15 kg weight (hydrobios, kiel, germany) was used. information on trawl depth was derived from an ultrasonic depth transponder attached to the bridle of the nets. the depth transponder measured the trawl depth to the nearest meter. depending on the time of the year and weather con- ditions, the nets were trawled between the surface and )1. the speed 35 m depth with a speed of 2.5–5.5 kmæh was adjusted to maintain a consistent depth, but was held as fast as possible. fish samples were killed in )1) directly after catch trichloromethyl-propanol (2 gæl and subsequently preserved in 4% formalin or put on ice. within 6 h, all ﬁsh that had been put on ice were stored in a freezer at )18 °c until they were further processed. table 1. five periods of different gape size limitations of perch and burbot. diet overlap of perch and burbot into the total following length length (tl) of larvae and juveniles (only frozen individuals) were recorded in the laboratory to the nearest millimetre. fish were dissected under a stereo microscope and stomach contents were counted and classiﬁed according to the traditional classiﬁcation system of zooplankton within the working group ‘fish ecology’ from the limnological institute of konstanz taxa: daphnia university (cp), daphnia sp. < 1.6 mm carapace sp. > 1.6 mm cp, daphnia galeata < 1.6 mm cp, d. galeata > 1.6 cp, cyclopoid copepods < 0.8 mm cp and cyclopoid copepods > 0.8 mm cp, calanoid copepods < 0.8 mm cp, calanoid copepods > 0.8 mm cp, leptodora kindtii, bythotrephes longimanus, bos- mina sp. and copepod nauplii (table 1). the numerical abundance of prey taxa, was converted into biomass by using mean lengths and wet weights from the literature (becker 1992; mehner et al. 1995; eckmann et al. 2002). only stomach contents from individuals containing at least two food items were included into the data set. period (doy) <138 138–147 147–167 167–178 >178 perch taxa naup cyc < 0.8 cal < 0.8 naup cyc < 0.8; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8 ds < 1.6 dg < 1.6* bos* naup cyc < 0.8; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8* ds < 1.6; (ds > 1.6)* dg < 1.6* bos* naup cyc < 0.8*; cyc > 0.8* cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8* ds < 1.6; ds > 1.6 dg < 1.6; dg > 1.6 bos* byt lept naup cyc < 0.8; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8* ds < 1.6; ds > 1.6 dg < 1.6*; dg > 1.6 bos byt* lept no.pred. no.obs. 3 8 8 1 6 8 12 11 12 11 burbot taxa naup* cyc < 0.8 cal < 0.8 naup* cyc < 0.8;(cyc > 0.8) cal < 0.8* naup cyc < 0.8; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8* ds < 1.6*, (ds > 1.6)* dg < 1.6 bos naup cyc < 0.8; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8*; cal > 0.8* ds < 1.6*; ds > 1.6 dg < 1.6; dg > 1.6 bos* byt lept naup cyc < 0.8*; cyc > 0.8 cal < 0.8; cal > 0.8 ds < 1.6*; ds > 1.6 dg < 1.6; dg > 1.6* bos byt* lept* no.pred. no.obs. 3 3 8 12 12 2 4 6 6 7 doy, day of year counted continuously from 1st of january; no., the taxa which can be ingested by perch and burbot according to the gape size models (pred.) and actually observed (obs.); cyc, cyclopoid copepods; naup, nauplii; ds, daphnia sp.; dg, daphnia galeata; bos, bosmina sp. numbers behind taxa abbreviations indicate size class. taxa printed in bold indicate taxa which were observed to be ingested, taxa in brackets are taxa which were observed to be ingested, but not predicted to be consumable according to gape size models. asterisks denote taxa which contributed <5% to the mean stomach content biomass. 529 probst & eckmann gape size calculation at the time of ﬁrst catches in the middle of may, burbot and perch had similar tl (6.0–7.0 mm), but in august, perch had grown to more than twice the size of yoy burbot (fig. 1). from the regression between the day of the year (doy) and tl (tl = adoyb with a and b as estimated regression coefﬁcients), a predicted tl at a given doy was calculated and used to compute the gape size of both species at the according doy. the gape size (gs) of perch and burbot were calculated using the following equations: gsperch ¼ 0:2152 þ 0:0781tlðmmþ (guma’a 1978) gsburbot ¼  0:36 þ 0:15tlðmmþ (ghan & sprules 1993) fig. 1. the growth of yoy perch and burbot during spring and summer in lake constance.

inﬂuence on mean tl: of f = 1.168, p = 0.290; inﬂuence of doy on mean tl: f = 155.387, p < 0.001. furthermore, no differ- ences in diet composition between 2006 and 2007 were found for either perch or burbot in nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (nmds) plots produced by primer-e (clarke & gorley 2006). in nmds plots, the distances of the bray–curtis similarities are projected onto a two-dimensional plane and result in groups (in this case categorised by years), which are clustered according to their similarity. in our case, if all stomach content data are aggregated within a single group, there is no visual evidence for differences in the stomach contents. because no signiﬁcant differences in growth or diet composition were observed, the stomach content data of both years were pooled. this approach increased diet overlap of perch and burbot the sample size within the ﬁve periods of various gape size limitations and was assumed to result in a better statistical resolution of stomach content differences or similarities. for all analyses of stomach contents, biomass data were used. the stomach contents by wet weight were compared between perch and burbot with similarity percentage analysis (simper) using primer-e 6.0 (clarke & warwick 2001; clarke & gorley 2006). the simper-analysis allows to investigate the similarity of stomach contents between individual perch and burbot. simper also identiﬁes the dissimilarity between perch and burbot stomach contents and allocates the relative contribution of the ingested zooplankton taxa to the observed similarity or dissim- ilarity. prior to the simper-analysis, the absolute biomass data of stomach contents were standardised to relative amount of biomass per stomach. the diet overlap (c) between perch and burbot for the ﬁve periods was calculated after schoener (1971):  c ¼ 100 1   0:5 pbi   ppi x    ; where pbi is the mean proportion of prey item i in the stomach of burbot and ppi is the mean proportion of food item i in the stomach of perch. results catches the pelagic ﬁsh catches from 2006 and 2007 consisted exclusively of yoy perch and burbot. from the total of 657 perch and 236 burbot caught in both years, 548 perch and 223 burbot stomachs were analysed. this amounted to 83% and 94% of analysed perch and burbot stomachs, respectively. in 2006, perch catches peaked in the middle of june, sharply declined by the middle of july and became absent by the beginning of august (fig. 2). burbot catches were highest in early may and continuously declined until august. perch were always more abundant than burbot, the maxi- mum abundance dominance occurred by the middle of june, when perch were 36 times more abundant than burbot (fig. 2). stomach contents composition the predictions of gape size limitation matched the observed taxa ingested by perch (table 1, fig. 3). as perch grew and their gape size increased during summer, their diet spectrum diversiﬁed, and after doy 167 all prey taxa except for copepod nauplii could be found within the perch stomachs. before doy 138, larval yoy perch fed exclusively on small cyclopoid copepods. from doy 138 onwards, daph- fig. 2. trends in seasonal abundance of yoy perch and burbot in the pelagic zone of lake constance in 2006.

(b) ratio of perch versus burbot abundance. doy, day of year counted from the 1st of january 2006. different scales for perch and burbot abundance are shown in this ﬁgure. nids became increasingly abundant in perch stomach contents until after doy 167 even larger daphnids were ingested and daphnids accounted for more than 66% of all consumed biomass. after doy 167 also large cladocerans (bythotrephes longimanus and lept- odora kindtii) as well as bosmina sp. contributed to about 10% of perch diet, whereas copepods became less dominant: before doy 167 copepods contributed about 66% to the consumed biomass, but after perch overcame the gape size limitation for large daphnids, copepods contributed <33% to perch stomach content biomass. similar to perch, the diet of burbot became more diverse as they grew, however, not as many different prey taxa were consumed (fig. 3, perch = 11 prey taxa, burbot = 7 prey taxa after doy 178, table 1). burbot fed mainly on small cyclopoid copepods before doy 147, but to a small extent also consumed nauplii during this time (fig. 3). from doy 147 onwards, large cyclopoid copepods constituted at least 40% of the diet, which matched the predicted ending of gape size limitation for this taxon. the regression model between tl and gape size predicted a gape size of >1.6 mm at doy 180, and in accordance, large daphnids were not found before doy 179. however, small daphnids (<1.6 mm cp) were only consumed in minimal proportions during the entire summer. after 531 probst & eckmann fig. 3. relative composition of stomach content biomass of perch and burbot during the ﬁve investigation periods with different gape size limitations. doy indicates the ﬁrst and last day of the year for the according period. numbers of analysed stomachs are indicated above each column. zooplankton taxa are abbreviated as: ds, daphnia sp.; dg, daphnia galeata; cyc, cyclopoid copepods; cal, calanoid copepods; lept, leptodora kindtii; byt, bytho- trephes longimanus; bos, bosmina sp. numbers behind abbrevi- ations refer to carapace length in millimetre. doy 178, also a small number of bythotrephes longimanus was consumed, indicating that burbot overcame gape size limitation for even the largest taxon of crustacean zooplankton. diet overlap the stomach content dissimilarities between perch and burbot increased until doy 178, but decreased in the last period after doy 178 (table 2). until doy 147, table 2. results of simper-analysis on square-root transformed, standar- dised biomass data of perch and burbot stomach contents. period (doy) <138 138–147 147–167 167–179 >179 similarity perch (%) similarity burbot (%) dissimilarity (%) 100.0 55.4 40.4 22.9 22.9 98.1 80.2 53.0 44.7 46.4 1.1 36.3 57.3 95.4 79.8 similarity refers to the arithmetic mean similarity between perch and burbot samples respectively. dissimilarity refers to the mean dissimilarity between perch and burbot stomach contents of the according period. mean similarities and dissimilarities are based on bray–curtis distances calculated for pair-wise comparison samples within the according period based, which is doy = day of year counted from the 1st of january. 532 the interspeciﬁc differences in stomach content com- position were mostly attributable to copepod nauplii, small cyclopoid copepods and small daphnia sp. (table 3). after doy 147, however, the stomach contents of both species also differed as a result of different amounts of consumed large cyclopoid cope- pods accounting for about 27% of the observed dissimilarity. comparing the trajectories of schoener’s c and simper dissimilarity during the periods of varying gape size limitations between perch and burbot, the observed values of both methods indicate similar trends in diet overlap (fig. 4). interspeciﬁc diet overlap decreased continuously until the last period (>doy 178), when burbot began to consume large daphnids and thus their diet spectrum approached a similar width as the diet spectrum of perch. the intraspeciﬁc similarity of perch stomach con- tents decreased until doy 178 and remained at 23% (table 2). the ingested prey taxa, which accounted most often for the similarity of perch stomach contents, were small cyclopoid copepods until doy 167 and small daphnids after doy 167 (table 4). the contributions to similarity of single taxa deceased constantly over time, reaching <10% of the total similarity after doy 168 and thus reﬂecting the diversiﬁcation of perch diet. the intraspeciﬁc similarity between burbot stomach contents decreased during the summer (table 2) and was caused exclusively by cyclopoid copepods, which always contributed more than 50% to the calculated total similarity (table 4). discussion the earliest catches of perch and burbot in this study occurred in the middle of may, which correspond well to the ﬁrst presence of both species within the pelagic zone of lake constance as found by wang & appenzeller (1998). however, perch and burbot are well known to commence exogenous feeding on green algae and rotifers (guma’a 1978; ryder & pesendorfer 1992; ghan & sprules 1993; wang 1994a,b), which in this study were not found in any stomach. hence, the earliest stages of exogenous feeding must have been missed by the present sampling scheme. despite this shortcoming, this study gathered data before the diets of perch and burbot diverged as indicated by the high diet similarity before doy 138 (fig. 2). hartmann (1986) described that larval perch and burbot are mostly limited in prey type selection by their gape size. the present results generally conﬁrm this pattern during the larval stage, but as juveniles the feeding strategies of perch and burbot diverge. whereas only a total of seven different prey taxa were found in all burbot stomachs after doy 178, diet overlap of perch and burbot table 3. main taxa responsible for interspeciﬁc dissimilarities between perch and burbot stomach contents during the ﬁve periods of various gape size limitations. period (doy) <138 138–147 148–167 168–178 >178 prey taxa cyc < 0.8 naup cyc < 0.8 ds < 1.6 cyc < 0.8 cyc > 0.8 cyc > 0.8 cyc < 0.8 dg < 1.6 cyc > 0.8 ds > 1.6 av.abund. perch av.abund. burbot av.diss.

(2002) the evidence for resource limitations for planktiv- orous ﬁsh is scarce (mehner & thiel 1999; persson et al. 2000). gaedke (1998) found no evidence, that the re-oligotrophication of lake constance has caused a decline in lake whiteﬁsh by the end of the there is no reason to millennium. consequently, assume food limitation for other planktivorous ﬁsh. however, while eckmann et al. found no evidence for a top-down control of daphnids by lake whiteﬁsh, coregonus_lavaretus l., whiteﬁsh were estimated to affect signiﬁcantly the mortality rate of bythotrephes longimanus leydig 1860. furthermore, during the eutrophication from 1915 until 1970, the ﬁsheries’ yields of perch and burbot have increased (nu¨mann 1973). therefore, lower densities of zoo- plankton in oligotrophic lakes may generally lead to increased competition between yoy ﬁsh (guillard et al. 2006). the re-oligotrophication of lake con- stance may increase mortality rates during the com- mon pelagic stage of perch and burbot due to increased inter- and intraspeciﬁc competition. the potential the relative compositions of stomach content biomass indicate that for exploitive competition between both species exists mainly until doy 147, which was the time when the interspeciﬁc dissimilarities between stomach contents of perch and burbot were <50% (table 2). because of their depen- dency on small cyclopoid copepods during their early life history, both perch and burbot can be expected to react sensitive to absolute changes in abundance of 534 the changes cyclopoid copepods. however, due to extended dependency of burbot on cyclopoid copepods, their year-class strength should be particularly affected by this zooplankton taxon. contrary, changes in the abundance and population dynamics of a single prey taxon should have less impact on the survival and growth of yoy perch. hence, in zooplankton community as a result of re-oligotroph- ication may affect the ontogeny of yoy perch and burbot differently. when copepods densities remain at similar levels, but cladocerans decrease in abundance, re-oligotrophication may have stronger impacts on the population of lake constance perch than burbot. contrary, a total decline in copepods abundance may affect burbot more severely than perch, because they rely longer on this zooplankton taxon and do not seem to be able to utilise other prey taxa as ﬂexible as perch. the lake constance zooplankton time series of community indicates that the total abundance of zooplankton as well as the ratio of daphnid:copepod abundance is decreasing (bu¨rgi et al. 2006). there- fore, the reoligotrophication of lake constance may be expected to have less impacts on the feeding of burbot, but is increasing the competition between perch for zooplankton resources. after their ontoge- netic habitat shift to the littoral zone in july, juvenile perch are currently found to consume increasing proportions of benthic invertebrates (schleuter & eckmann 2007). this observation provides evidence for the limited zooplankton availability for juvenile perch during summer, which fed exclusively on zooplankton during this season in years of eutrophi- cation (schleuter 2007). the intraspeciﬁc total similarity between perch stomach contents decreased to <25%, but remained at almost 50% in burbot (table 2). thus, perch seem to become individual specialists, whereas burbot continue to feed on a common resource, i.e., cyclopoid copepods. by the middle of june, the abundance of burbot decreases to such low numbers, that perch may rather be subject to intraspeciﬁc competition than to inter- speciﬁc competition with burbot (fig. 2). the simi- larity in stomach contents of perch decreased continuously until doy 178, with total similarities remaining at 23% during the last period of their pelagic stage (table 2). while overcoming gape size limitations for various zooplankton prey taxa, the decreasing intraspeciﬁc similarity values suggest that individual perch specialised on a limited number of prey taxa and thereby reduce intraspeciﬁc competition (bolnick et al. 2003). the intraspeciﬁc similarity values of perch decreased most markedly after the gape size limitation for large copepods and large daphnids were overcome by doy 147 and doy 167 respectively. before doy 167, more than 50% of taxon-related similarity resulted from small cyclopoid copepods, whereas after doy 168 values of taxon- related similarities were small (<10%, table 4) and only attributable to daphnids and cyclopoid copepods. during the last two periods (from doy 168 onwards), the similarity of perch stomach contents remained at 23% (table 2). the inability to further reduce intra- speciﬁc competition in combination with declining zooplankton abundances in july may induce the ontogenetic habitat shift towards the littoral zone frequently observed in juvenile perch populations (treasurer 1988; wu & culver 1992; wang & eckmann 1994; urho 1996). the intraspeciﬁc diet overlap of burbot remained high even after the overcoming of gape size limitation for large daphnids (table 2). however, considering the low densities of yoy burbot in lake constance in summer (fig. 2), intraspeciﬁc competition for zoo- plankton resources may affect burbot growth or survival only during spring. however, the diet overlap of juvenile burbot, which have settled to the lake bottom, remains to be quantiﬁed to assess the full potential for intraspeciﬁc competition between burbot during their ﬁrst year of life. in meso- and oligotrophic lakes, the ﬁsh community is usually dominated by percids and salmonids (persson et al. 1991). mehner et al. (2005) further identify two types of ﬁsh communities depending rather on water depth and temperature than on trophic status: in warm, shallow lakes the ﬁsh community is dominated by cyprinids, whereas in deep, cold lakes salmonids and percids are proportionally most abun- dant. accordingly, perch is the dominant ﬁsh in the littoral zone, while burbot abundance is fourfold lower (reyjol et al. 2005). the study by mehner et al. diet overlap of perch and burbot (2005) revealed that deep lakes with cool, oxygen rich water are also a preferred habitat of burbot. because perch and burbot have been native members of the lake constance ﬁsh community prior to the eutrophi- cation, they can be expected to remain present in the lake throughout the ongoing process of re-oligotroph- ication (nu¨mann 1973; hartmann & nu¨mann 1977). acknowledgements this work was funded by the german research foundation (dfg) within the collaborative research centre crc 454 ‘the littoral zone of lake
