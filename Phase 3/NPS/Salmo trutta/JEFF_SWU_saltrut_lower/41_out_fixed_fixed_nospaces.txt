matthews, 1988). †rob klumb (deceased july 8, 2013) worked for the united states fish and wildlife service and was a co-investigator on this project from the proposal through the data collection stages. rob also served as a graduate committee member for jessica howell and was a friend and colleague to katie bertrand and brian graeb. seasonal hydrologic regimes influence the distribution and quality of water resources and structure biotic communities (covich et al., 1997; dodds, gido, whiles, fritz, & matthews, 2004; fausch & bestgen, 1997). highly variable mid- continental weather patterns frequently cause localised flood events or periods of drought, but native prai- rie stream communities are adapted to these disturbances and are resistant to change (dodds et al., 2004; fausch & bramblett, 1991; franssen et al., 2006; gido, bertrand, murdock, dodds, & whiles, 2010; matthews & marsh- matthews, 2003; scheurer, fausch, & ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:389–397. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  389 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd390  |     bestgen, 2003). although disturbance events alter physical habitat and water chemistry, native prairie stream fishes have historically re- covered quickly from temporary reductions in abundance or extent (dodds et al., 2004; franssen et al., 2006; lake, 2000; matthews, 1988; scheurer et al., 2003). modern agricultural practices have dramatically altered prairie landscapes and streams, by degrading water quality, homogenising and fragmenting stream habitat, and reducing available refugia (dodds et al., 2004; hrodey, sutton, frimpong, & simon, 2009; sampson & knopf, 1994; weitzel, 2002). as a result, the fish assemblage struc- tures in altered prairie stream habitats are less resilient to seasonal hydrologic change and disturbance events (flood and drought) than they once were (dodds et al., 2004). scouring floods may reset stream communities to early successional seres, and droughts may progres- sively eliminate species from communities. duration, intensity, timing and frequency of drought and flood influence the species affected by the disturbance and to what degree (dodds et al., 2004; matthews, 1988). fish assemblage structure resilience depends on species- specific recolonisation potential and reproductive success during or imme- diately following a disturbance. many plains fishes have life history traits that allow for rapid dispersal over large areas and the ability to contribute offspring following disturbance. for example, numer- ous riverine fishes (i.e., lithophilic spawners; balon, 1975) distribute eggs using the current (brown & armstrong, 1985; johnston & page, 1992; perkin & gido, 2012). fish that take advantage of conditions during or immediately following disturbances (i.e., water tempera- ture, discharge and photoperiod) for spawning are able to recover quickly following a spate, while others may follow in succession during periods of stability (bye, 1984; winemiller & rose, 1992). using spawning cues or protracting multiple spawning events during long periods may increase survival by matching the timing of one or many hatch events with peaks in resource availability (cushing, 1969). abiotic and biotic drivers of larval fish assemblage structure in prairie streams remain understudied, relative to drivers of commercial and sport fish population structure (but see fischer & paukert, 2008; bertrand, gido, dodds, murdock, & whiles, 2009; murdock, gido, dodds, bertrand, & whiles, 2010). descriptions of temporal and spa- tial patterns in larval assemblage structures in prairie streams also are scarce (but see muth & schmulbach, 1984; doyle, morse, & kendall, 1993; gogola, sanches, gubiani, & da silva, 2013). quantifying the abundance of drifting larval fishes before, during and after flood dis- turbance in eastern south dakota prairie streams will improve our un- derstanding of the mechanisms structuring larval fish assemblages in prairie streams. the objectives of this research were to (i) evaluate the timing and relative abundance of native fish larval drift in three eastern south dakota basins (vermillion, james and big sioux) and (ii) describe the response of drifting larval fish assemblage structure to hydrologic disturbance in the james river basin. we expect that species will uti- lise different periods for reproduction and that relative abundance of drifting larvae will change seasonally and in response to disturbance events. garcia et al. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study area we sampled drifting larval fishes from three prairie rivers in eastern south dakota: james, vermillion and big sioux (figure 1). the james river drains approximately 57,000 km2 is 1,195 km in length (shearer & berry, 2003) and has one of the flattest gradients of any river in north america (mean gradient = 0.035 m/km; owen, elsen, & russell, 1981; benson, 1983). prolonged overbank flooding occurs frequently (recurrence interval <10 years; benson, 1983). the james river also is one of the most dammed rivers in the region with approximately 230 lowhead dams and rock crossings (shearer & berry, 2003). the wa- tershed area of the big sioux river is approximately 23,325 km2, and its elevation drops approximately 305 m in the 510 km between its headwaters and its confluence with the missouri river (galat, berry, peters, & white, 2005). the vermillion river drains the smallest of the three basins (~5,800 km2), is approximately 220 km long and ex- periences frequent flooding as a result of the flat gradient and nar- row channel (johnson, 1997; schmulbach & braaten, 1993). whereas historic landcover was grassland, current landuse in eastern south dakota is predominantly row crop agriculture and livestock grazing (owen, elsen, & russel, 1981). figure 1 map of eastern south dakota depicting study sites and united states geological survey water gaging stations from which mean daily water data were procured for comparisons across years from 2003, 2004 and 2010–2012 garcia et al. to sample representative drifting larval fish diversity in these three south dakota rivers, sample sites were distributed from the northern extent of each basin in south dakota to the confluence of each of the three streams with the missouri river (figure 1). we varied the num- ber of sample sites in each river basin in approximate proportion to the basin drainage area: james (n = 5), big sioux (n = 3) and vermillion (n = 2). these sites were sampled during the spawning season (april– september) from 2010 to 2012 to describe the timing and relative abundance of native fish larval drift in the three river basins. we also examined a longer- term effect of flooding (variable: discharge) on lar- val fish assemblage structure using data collected near the confluence of the james and missouri rivers in 2003, 2004, 2010 and 2012. data collected in 2003, 2004 and 2012 were baseflow or “drought” years and were compared to 2010, which was a “flood” year. including 2003 and 2004 provided more data on larval fish assemblage structure during baseflow conditions for comparison with larval fish assemblage structure during a flood event. discharge data were compiled from april 1 through august 31 in 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011 and 2012 at local united states geological survey (usgs) water gages to describe river stage (figure 1). on the james river, we used data from five gages: columbia (usgs gage 06471000), huron (usgs gage 06476000), near mitchell (usgs gage 06478000), near scotland (usgs gage 06478500) and yankton (usgs gage 06478513). on the big sioux river, we used data from three gages: brookings (usgs gage 06480000), sioux falls (usgs gage 06482020) and akron (usgs gage 06485500). on the vermillion river, we used data from two gages: parker (usgs gage 06478690) and vermillion (usgs gage 06479010). data were averaged by river and compared among years to describe baseflow and flood conditions. 2.2 | collection methods in 2003 and 2004, we fished two conical nets (0.5 m diameter, 3 m length, 500- μm mesh) for 1 to 5 minutes just below the surface of the water (average of 15% of the water column sampled) from a boat anchored in the current. fishing time varied to prevent the net from clogging with detritus. when current was negligible, we used the boat to push the nets through the water at approximately 3 km/h. in 2010, 2011 and 2012, we fished a larval drift net (0.5 m by 1 m rectangu- lar frame, 2.5 m length, 500- μm mesh) three times at each site for 2–15 minutes per net set, by wading in from the stream bank (average of 100% of the water column sampled at 0.5 m depth). again, fishing time was shortened when heavy detritus loads clogged the net. water volume sampled was measured with a mechanical flow meter (model 2030 series, general oceanics, inc.) in the centre of the mouth of the net frame. larval fish were collected bi- weekly from mid- may to september, with an additional sampling event in october 2010. in 2011, sampling began in april (a month earlier) in an attempt to collect drifting lar- vae of early spawning fish. an additional truncated sampling season in 2012 targeted bighead and silver carp spawning and was conducted bi- weekly in june and july. to facilitate comparisons among flood and drought conditions, we divided each year into seven larval fish     |  391 sampling periods identified as late may (16–31), early june (1–15), late june (16–30), early july (1–15), late july (16–31), early august (1–15) and late august (16–31). 2.3 | laboratory sample processing samples were preserved in the field in a 10% formalin solution, sieved in the lab, rinsed and stored in distilled water for seven days, sieved and stored in a 30% ethanol from days 8–14, and transferred per- manently to a 75% ethanol solution thereafter. identification relied on myomere counts and morphological characteristics (auer, 1982; fuiman et al., 1983; holland–bartels, littlejohn, & huston, 1990; margulies, 1983; mcguire, 1981; snyder, snyder, & douglas, 1977; yeager & semmens, 1987). catch per unit effort (cpue) was reported as the number of larvae per 1000 m3 of water sampled per net by developmental stage. catch per unit effort from replicate nets on a single sample date (two per site for 2003–2004, three per site for 2010–2012) were averaged. total annual cpues were calculated from these site and day averages. 2.4 | data analysis frequency of occurrence was calculated as number of sample events containing particular taxa divided by the total number of samples col- lected. larval fish taxa richness was summarised by stream and year. we calculated shannon diversity index (shannon h’) and evenness (simpson, 1949). we used jaccard’s (1908) coefficient of community within rivers and among years and sampling events to examine quali- tative (presence–absence) similarities in assemblages: s (x1, x2) = a a + b + c (1) where x1 is the sample from a given stream at sampling event 1 and year 1 and x2 is the sample from the same stream at a different time step. the number of species present in both assemblages, x1 and x2, is represented by a, whereas b and c represent the number of species present in either assemblage. we estimated assemblage turnover time at each sample site using the distance- decay method (anderson et al., 2011; qian & ricklefs, 2007). bray–curtis distance was calculated as a quantitative (cpue of taxa) coefficient of community structure: dbcd (i,j) = ∑n−1 ∑n−1 k=0 �yi,k − yi,k� k=0 �yi,k + yi,k� (2) where n is number of variables y, k is the index of the variable, and the i and j are the objects compared (bray & curtis, 1957; odum, 1950). in this dissimilarity coefficient, distances between abundant species contribute the same to overall assemblage dissimilarity as distances between rare species (legendre & legendre, 1998). taxa with less than two occurrences were excluded from analyses. to evaluate resiliency of larval fish assemblages to disturbance, we compared bray–curtis distances among sampling events across the three river basins and three study years in nonmetric multidimensional scaling using the vegan (adonis) package in software r (version 2.9.1). 392  |     3 |  results 3.1 | emergence patterns of drifting larval fishes in eastern south dakota similar fish taxa were collected from the three south dakota basins (table 1). from 2010 to 2012, total larval taxa richness was highest in the james river (20 taxa representing eight families; table 1). twelve fish species were collected from both the big sioux (five families) and vermillion rivers (seven families; table 1) but were not detected garcia et al. in the james river. three species were unique to the james river: emerald shiner notropis atherinoides, brook stickleback culaea incon- stans and blue sucker cycleptus elongatus (table 1). no species were captured in the big sioux or vermillion rivers that were not captured in the james river (table 1). one south dakota species of greatest conservation need (south dakota game, fish and parks [sdgfp], 2014), blue sucker, was collected (n = 141) from three sites in the lower james river during late may 2011. this species was associ- ated with gravel and sand beds near olivet, huron and mitchell, sd (table 1). table 1 list of larval fish taxa by family collected for each year sampled in the james, big sioux and vermillion rivers, south dakota, from 1 april through 31 august 2010–2012 river common name james big sioux vermillion year 2003a 2004 a 2010 2011 2012 scientific name clupeidae dorosoma cepedianum gizzard shad hiodontidae hiodon spp. cyprinidae goldeye/mooneye cyprinus carpio notemigonus crysoleucas notropis atherinoides notropis hudsonius notropis stramineus pimephales promelas cyprinella lutrensis cyprinella spiloptera common carp golden shiner emerald shiner spottail shiner sand shiner fathead minnow red shiner spotfin shiner catostomidae carpsucker spp. carpiodes spp. catostomus commersonii white sucker cycleptus elongatus ictiobus spp. moxostoma macrolepidotum blue sucker buffalo spp. shorthead redhorse gasterosteidae culaea inconstans brook stickleback moronidae morone chrysops white bass centrarchidae lepomis spp. pomoxis spp. percidae etheostoma nigrum perca flavescens sander spp. sciaenidae sunfish spp. crappie spp. johnny darter yellow perch walleye/sauger aplodinotus grunniens freshwater drum x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x aidentifies sampling events limited to the lower james river from 16 may to 15 august during 2003 and 2004. garcia et al. although similar larval fish assemblages occurred in each river, taxa richness varied among years (table 1). nine fish taxa were col- lected repeatedly in each sampling year, and two taxa were collected in 2010 and 2011, but not 2012 (table 1). fish species richness ranged from 12 to 18 in each basin and was uniformly lowest during sampling efforts in 2012 (table 1). six fish taxa were collected at enough loca- tions to evaluate patterns of larval occurrence throughout the open water, spawning season (figure 2). sand shiner notropis stramineus was the most frequently col- lected (34% of all sample events) species and was captured from all sampling locations. sand shiner collections occurred when water tem- peratures were 20–30°c (mean = 24.2, sd = 2.56) during flood years and 22–30°c (mean = 26.9, sd = 2.25) during drought years. during flooding, discharges when sand shiner were captured ranged from 97 to 637 m3/s (mean = 215.5, sd = 108.01), whereas discharge ranged from 3 to 28 m3/s (mean = 14.8, sd = 8.08) during drought conditions. larval fish were typically first encountered during the second week in june and through the third week of july on the ascending and de- scending limbs of the hydrograph (figures 2 and 3). sand shiner was most frequently collected during the first week of july (figure 2). sunfishes (lepomis spp., unable to resolve to species) were pro- tracted spawners in all three rivers (figure 2). larval sunfishes were collected at 60% of sampling locations, but only during 15% of all sample events. collections of sunfishes were most frequent during the second week of july, but occasionally from mid- june through the third week of august (figure 2). in flood years, water temperatures during their capture period ranged from 20 to 28°c (mean = 25.5, sd = 2.08), and discharge ranged from 97 to 419 m3/s (mean = 240.3, sd = 96.28). in drought years, water temperatures during this capture period ranged from 25 to 30°c (mean = 27.6, sd = 1.52), and dis- charge ranged from 3 to 28 m3/s (mean = 8.4, sd = 9.39). similar to sand shiners, sunfishes were typically collected when discharge was either rising or falling (i.e., not steady; figure 3). carpsuckers (carpiodes spp., unable to resolve to species) were collected within a shorter, less variable window than sunfishes and     |  393 sand shiner (figure 2). carpsucker larvae were collected from 60% of sites, but they were not taken as frequently as sunfishes (5% of all sample events). larval carpsuckers began appearing in our collec- tions during the second week of june and continued through the sec- ond week of july, typically coincident with a descending hydrograph (figures 2 and 3). in flood years, water temperatures during this pe- riod ranged from 18 to 23°c (mean = 20.0, sd = 1.66) and discharges ranged from 125 to 637 m3/s (mean = 197.3, sd = 148.15). in drought years, water temperatures when carpsuckers were collected ranged from 25 to 26°c (mean = 25.6, sd = 0.78) and discharges ranged from 5 to 26 m3/s (mean = 11.8, sd = 9.92). gizzard shad dorosoma cepedianum was collected at 70% of sam- pling locations and was captured more frequently in the james than in the big sioux or vermillion rivers, even considering that there were more sites in the james river (7% of all sample events). collections of larval gizzard shad were often obtained from the beginning of june until mid- july and were taken most frequently during the third week of june (figure 2). during flood years, gizzard shad collections occurred when water temperatures ranged from 20 to 25°c (mean = 21.8, sd = 1.23) and discharge ranged from 114 to 331 m3/s (mean = 141.3, sd = 52.51). during drought conditions, gizzard shad were collected when water temperatures ranged from 25 to 30°c (mean = 27.4, sd = 1.77) and discharge ranged from 5 to 17 m3/s (mean = 15.1, sd = 3.08). occurrence of gizzard shad larvae was more likely during the descending limb of the hydrograph (figures 2 and 3). johnny darter etheostoma nigrum larvae only occurred in 3% of all sampling events, but they were encountered each year and in each river. johnny darters occurred at 40% of sampling locations, more fre- quently in the big sioux than in the james or vermillion rivers. johnny darter larvae appeared earlier in spring (late may) than most species and were not detected beyond mid- june (figure 2). johnny darters were most often collected in the first week of june during when water temperatures ranged from 17 to 22°c (mean = 19.5, sd = 2.05) in flood years and 17 to 26°c (mean = 21.3, sd = 2.92) in drought years. in flood years, discharge during when johnny darter was figure 2 spawning windows of six of the most abundant and common fishes in the james, big sioux and vermillion rivers in eastern south dakota in 2010–2012 394  |     figure 3 mean daily discharge (m 3/s) and 95th percentile of 75 years of data (horizontal line) for the james, big sioux and vermillion rivers in eastern south dakota, usa. mean daily discharge is presented for 1 april through 31 august for 2003, 2004 and 2010- 2012. data were compiled from united states geological survey gaging stations along each river (gaging stations on james river: 06471000, 06476000, 06478000, 06478500 and 06478513; on big sioux river: 06480000, 06482020 and 06485500; on vermillion river: 06478690 and 06479010) captured ranged from 113 to 193 m3/s (mean = 156.2, sd = 21.45). in drought years, discharge during this period ranged from 17 to 21 m3/s (mean = 18.4, sd = 1.29). shorthead redhorse moxostoma macrolepidotum larvae occurred infrequently (6% of all sample events) and only from mid- may to mid- june (figure 2). shorthead redhorse larvae were detected at 60% of sampling locations, including sites in all three rivers. in flood years, water temperature during their capture period ranged from 18 to 20°c (mean = 19.6, sd = 0.42) and discharge ranged from 116 to 160 m3/s (mean = 138.5, sd = 14.37). in drought years, water tem- perature during this period ranged from 22 to 23°c (mean = 22.8, sd = 0.37) and discharge ranged from 20 to 28 m3/s (mean = 26.4, sd = 2.78). 3.2 | floods and droughts structure larval fish assemblages mean discharge exceeded the 75- year (1940–2016) 95th percen- tile (i.e., flood stage) from 1 april to 31 august in 2010 and 2011 (figure 3). the highest recorded mean spawning season discharge in 2011 (668 m3/s) was nearly 2,500 times greater than the lowest recorded mean spawning season discharge (0.27 m3/s). although the mean magnitude of disturbance events varied among rivers, the pattern in which discharge increased and decreased was similar among systems (figure 3). discharge in 2010 and 2011 represented a substantial flood event, whereas discharge during 2003, 2004 and 2012 was characteristic of typical drought conditions in the region (figure 3). during periods of drought (i.e., 2003, 2004 and 2012) mean spawning season discharge (april–september) was significantly lower than flood years in each of the three river basins (figure 3). no garcia et al. difference in discharge was apparent between the 2010 and 2011 flood years (figure 3). larval fish collected in the drift varied substantially during distur- bance events (figure 4). a strong horizontal (axis 1) gradient represent- ing season suggests that larval assemblages in eastern south dakota rivers change during the spawning season (figure 4). a secondary gradient (axis 2) highlights the divergence in assemblage structure between flood and drought years. during floods slack water species such as lepomis spp., pomoxis spp. and common carp cyprinus carpio characterise assemblages, whereas during droughts, channel obligates such as hiodon spp., freshwater drum aplodinotus grunniens, gizzard shad, sand shiner and emerald shiner notropis atherinoides are more common (figure 4). 3.3 | decadal patterns: james river confluence we compared larval fish samples collected at the confluence of the james river during 2003 and 2004 to establish whether drought had the same effects on larval assemblage structure 10 years prior to the 2012 drought (i.e., below the mean for the 83 years of available data). no data were collected from this site during 2011 because extreme flooding prohibited boat access. in the james river 22 larval fish taxa were collected, representing nine families in 2003 and 2004, which was similar to taxa collected in 2010 and 2012 (table 1). larval fish assemblage structure varied through time (jaccard’s similarity <40%); collections between drought years and the 2010 flood year were the least similar (table 1). only sand shiners were captured in all sampling years (table 1). although larval assemblage diversity (shannon h’) var- ied considerably among years, all drought year samples were up to 76% less diverse (2004) than the 2010 flood year (range: 8%–76%). figure 4 nonmetric multidimensional scaling of bray–curtis distances among sampling events in the james, big sioux and vermillion rivers in eastern sd in 2010–2012. species centroids are depicted with text;

thus, our analysis precludes native fishes that do not produce drifting larvae. while some taxa spawned over an extended temporal period under varying habitat conditions, others spawned in response to narrow temperature and discharge cues. variation in reproductive effort and timing may be adaptations to maximise persistence probability in harsh prairie streams. 4.1 | emergence patterns of larval fishes in eastern south dakota species captured have life history traits that seem to help them con- tribute offspring during or immediately after a disturbance. larval sand shiners and sunfishes were collected during a relatively long spawn- ing period (>9 weeks), suggesting that these species spawned repeat- edly during a protracted season. in general, these species spawned throughout the season and did not directly respond to specific hydro- logic or temperature cues. catch rates of sunfishes peaked 2–3 times during each protracted spawning season, potentially evidence of mul- tiple cohesive spawning events or differing spawning periods for the three species present in the region (green sunfish lepomis cyanellus, bluegill l. macrochirus and orangespotted sunfish l. humilis). shorthead redhorse, carpsuckers and gizzard shad spawned during more abbreviated periods (<6 weeks), seemingly when proper hydrologic or temperature conditions were met. water tempera- tures approximating 19°c seemed to initiate spawning of shorthead redhorse in 2010 and 2011. the onset of spawning was not observed in 2012; but we did not sample until later in the season when tempera- tures exceeded 23°c. although the sand shiners spawning window was broad, the species was rarely collected at temperatures <20°c. the onset of the sand shiner protracted summer spawning season may correlate with water temperature. similar research in kansas has demonstrated peak spawning for sand shiners occurred during july and august when water temperatures exceed 21°c (summerfelt & minckley, 1969). the shorter growing season in south dakota relative to kansas may explain the earlier onset of sand shiner reproduction. this species seems to behave as fractional spawners with bimodal larval distributions during floods and protracted spawners in drought years. summer spawning at generally high water temperatures may be an adaptation to the dramatic variability of great plains rivers in spring (summerfelt & minckley, 1969). other taxa tended to spawn in response to changing discharge (i.e., on the ascending or descending limb of the hydrograph). carpsuckers     |  395 and gizzard shad were more abundant during the descending limb of the hydrograph; sustained high discharges were associated with lower abundances of larval gizzard shad, consistent with findings in missouri (michaletz, 1997). bednarski, miller, and scarnecchia (2008) found that in the lower milk river, montana, the timing of spring peaks in discharge affected which species were collected in a given year. many lotic fishes in eastern south dakota vary the onset of spawning activ- ities in response to annual, cues while others spawn during extended seasons to maximise recruitment. 4.2 |  floods and droughts structure larval fish assemblages historic flood and periods of prolonged drought caused fish assem- blages to diverge. prolonged drought is a press disturbance (lake, 2000) that altered larval fish assemblage structure of the james river basin; however, it was secondary to the effect of season in a given year. during flood years, larval fish assemblage structure was charac- terised by slack water species that potentially respond to increased floodplain habitat availability (franssen et al., 2006). these species have been shown to associate with floodplain habitats which become accessible during large flood events (franssen et al., 2006; rinne & stefferud, 1999). during periods of drought, taxa richness declined and channel obligates dominated. variation in reproductive effort and timing may be adaptations to maximise persistence probability in harsh prairie streams (magoulick, 2000). flood events seem to reinvigorate the larval fish assemblage by cuing reproductive efforts in many species and by providing access to additional habitats. periods of high water or single flood events have the ability to change channel morphology, displace biota downstream (dodds et al., 2004; franssen et al., 2006; fritz, tripe, & guy, 2002) and supplement local resources (fausch, togersen, baxter, & li, 2002; fritz et al., 2002; fritz & dodds, 2005). drought years seem to restrict the assemblage to species associated with the main river channel and those with extended spawning periods (but see “the low flow recruitment hypothesis”, humphries, king, & koehn, 1999). typically, periods of low water limit fish assemblage expansion by reducing hab- itat availability and stressing intolerant individuals (franssen et al., 2006). sand shiner was the only species to be collected during all sampling years during both flood and drought disturbances. this spe- cies’ lengthy spawning season likely provides it an opportunity to suc- cessfully spawn when proper conditions exist regardless of hydrology (dodds et al., 2004; matthews, 1988). variable environmental conditions in the great plains region seem to result in erratic recruitment among years; however, protracted spawning seasons and spawning events in response to particular en- vironmental cues provide these species ample opportunity to persist (smith, beebling, & quist, 2010). subtle variability in spawning tactics of prairie fishes and an apparent seasonal progression of larval fish taxa that secondarily respond to disturbance regimes suggests that reproductive efforts are adapted to maximise the potential for suc- cessful recruitment in these dynamic systems. 396  |     acknowledgements the authors thank south dakota game, fish and parks (project 1516), the south dakota agricultural experiment station (hatch project sd00h300- 09—conservation of fisheries and stream ecosystem in the northern great plains) and u.s. fish and wildlife service for pro- ject funding support. special thanks are offered to south dakota state university, department of natural resource management, for provid- ing lab space and equipment. assistance with sampling was provided by k. grohs, c.- a hayer, c. koehler, c. warner, t. davis, t. trimpe, c. bex, j. stane, a. von eschen, j. sholly, j. davis, j. breeggemann and t. stevens. we sincerely thank two anonymous reviewers and dr. marty hamel for very beneficial comments and suggestions that greatly im- proved this article. references anderson, m. j., crist, t. o., chase, j. m., vellend, m., inouye, b.d., freestone, a. l., … swenson, n. g.
