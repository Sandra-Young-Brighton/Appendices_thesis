brown_trout; lake spawning; microsatellites; population change; stocking introduction many salmonid populations are characterised by genetic differentiation, even on relatively small geo- graphical scales, in both fragmented and unfragment- ed natural environments (heggenes et al. 2002; whiteley et al. 2010). genetic structuring in frag- mented populations is often a consequence of isola- tion or limited admixture between populations (meldgaard et al. 2003; heggenes & røed 2006). salmonid populations existing without migration and dispersal barriers have also been found to be geneti- cally structured between drainages (hindar et al. 1991; hansen et al. 2002). on even smaller geo- graphical scales, genetic differentiation has been found within continuous river systems (carlsson et al. 1999; primmer et al. 2006), between tributaries (ferguson & taggart 1991; lehtonen et al. 2009), and lake-run populations (hendry et al. 1995; hegg- enes et al. 2009). strong natal homing instinct and imprinting to site of fry emergence (hasler et al. 1978) are factors that may lead to such genetic struc- turing and reproductive isolation, although this is bal- anced by the potential for genetic exchange between such populations. overharvesting and habitat destruction affect many salmonid populations, and as compensation, stocking is often the primary effort for sustaining population sizes and allowing for continued harvesting. stocking is commonly carried out using nonindigenous indi- viduals, affecting the level of genetic differentiation within and between populations (araguas et al. 2004; vasem€agi et al. 2005). despite continuous stocking over long time periods, there are reported instances where there is a lack of genetic effect on indigenous populations (heggenes et al. 2002; caudron et al. correspondence: m. heun, department of ecology and natural resource management (ina), norwegian university of life sciences (umb), 1432 as, norway. e-mail:manfred.heun@umb.no doi: 10.1111/eff.12102 485 thaulow et al. 2009), possibly as a consequence of higher mortality rates of stocked fish compared with wild born indi- viduals (berg & jørgensen 1991; weiss & schmutz 1999). on the hardangervidda mountain plateau in south- ern norway, brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) have been present and harvested for at least 6500 years, as doc- umented by findings of brown_trout bones in kitchen middens from the stone age (indrelid 1985). brown_trout has been the only fish species present in thou- sands of lakes and streams on this mountain plateau until the last hundred years and is still allopatric in the central and western part. the lacustrine popula- tions have been exploited by gillnetting, and enhancement stocking has been commonly performed to maintain harvests. in some lakes, stocking has led to an almost complete replacement of the genetic population structure (sønstebø et al. 2008; thaulow et al. 2013). within the last 100 years, many head- water lakes in this area have been stocked with brown_trout, often without precise records or knowl- edge of origin. one such headwater lake is skavatn, which most likely was fishless until it was stocked twice in the mid 1930s (mountain board leader tomas sekse pers. comm.). the lake was later restocked both in 1974 and 1982. the brown_trout used in the 1974 stocking are assumed to originate from lake gjuvsja, whereas the 1982 origin is unknown (sønstebø et al. 2008). sønstebø et al. in the genetic population (2008) detected a shift structure within the lake, identified by analysing microsatellite dna markers in scales of individuals from the initial population, and contemporary tissue samples. tests showed that only 6 of 50 analysed individuals seemed to belong to the historical population, indicating a marked decline of the initial population founded in the 1930s (sønstebø et al. 2008). the genetic analysis by these authors furthermore identified the likely presence of two subpopulations, in addition to the genetic signal from the initial population, and the assumed stocking source from gjuvsja (sønstebø et al. 2008). the objectives of the present study were to: (i) assign the suggested substructure to suspected spawning loca- tions and (ii) evaluate their contribution to the total population in the lake. traditionally, spawning in running water is expected to be the main reproductive strategy of brown_trout. however, high recruitment rates have been found for several brown_trout popula- tions despite limited available stream spawning habitat (e.g., barlaup et al. 1998; heggenes et al. 2009), and often lake spawning has been identified in such cases (barlaup et al. 1998; brabrand et al. 2002; heggenes et al. 2009). the relative contribution from lake spawning is generally unknown, but potentially high (jensen & senstad 1962). as lake skavatn most individual assignment 486 different conditions, where likely was fishless before initial introduction of brown_trout, the lake offers a unique opportunity to study the effect of additional stocking on an artifi- cially established population under alpine environ- mental spawning strategies may be present (i.e., stream spawning and lake spawning). the goal of the study was therefore to evaluate whether suggested subpopulations were present and whether these could be assigned to indi- vidual spawning habitats. we furthermore expect that lake spawning might occur and possibly serve as an important spawning strategy in a system with poten- tial small water discharge and periodically bottom freezing of streams. materials and methods study area lake skavatn is an oligotrophic alpine lake (60°6′52′′ n, 7°8′39′′e) located at 1249 m above sea level (asl; fig. 1). the lake has a surface area of 0.48 km2, with maximum depth 15 m and mean depth 5.7 m. skavatn has two main tributaries (t1 and t2) and an outlet stream (sko; fig. 1). the catchment area is c. 4.3 km2, giving a low discharge in the tributaries, as well as in the outlet stream, espe- cially during periods with little rainfall and during winter. in this area, snow depth in beginning of april may vary from less than one metre to more than three metres (borgstrøm 2001). based on the low mean annual discharge, it is expected that in cold autumns, with precipitation falling as snow, spawning migra- tions to the streams may be highly restricted or even prevented (fig. 2). on the other hand, the northern and north-western littoral area of the lake may pro- vide suitable lake spawning habitat (skl), due to both suitable gravel and possible groundwater influx, as indicated by the large area and thickness of coarse glacial till in the above hillside, seen in the back- ground in fig. 2. t1 is a c. 500-m long tributary entering the lake at its north-eastern end. the tribu- tary consists of four shallow (<1 m) pool-like sec- tions of almost standing water connected by very shallow (<10 cm) sections dominated by embedded large stones. t2 is c. 1.2 km, running into the lake at its eastern side (fig. 1). the first c. 200 m is a very shallow rapid (fig. 2), with the same sub- strate as t1. the rapid is followed by a larger pool with depth >1 m. the remaining stretch of the tribu- tary (c. 800 m) is about 0.5–1 m in width, with many deep undercut sections. the bottom substrate of this upper section, after the large pool, seems to be of good spawning quality. a 500 m section of sko, from an upstream impassable waterfall to the lake outlet, was electro-fished. the first c. 50 m from the riffle lake spawning alpine brown_trout fig. 1. map of skavatn with surrounding elevation contours. note the slope of the northern lake side, indicating potential for groundwater influx. the two tributaries (t1 and t2), outlet stream (sko) and littoral (skl, black line) sampling locations are shown. dotted line in sko indicates the position of the exposed bedrock. lake is characterised by faster running and deeper water compared with the downstream, broader and more shallow (<10 cm deep) section, as observed during the sampling periods. between these two sec- tions, the stream runs over a c. 5 m exposed bedrock, with c. 1.5 m elevation difference from top to bot- tom, potentially limiting upstream migration of small juveniles (fig. 1). borgstrøm et al. (1993) considered the upper few metres of the outlet, in the transition zone between the lake and the stream, to be a spawn- ing area, as they found fry with mean length at 22 mm during electrofishing here, but not further downstream. part of this spawning area, however, has been changed in later years due to a rearrange- ment of several large stones to facilitate crossing of the stream, possibly reducing the quality of the spawning habitat. in periods during the last 25 years, the brown_trout population in lake skavatn has been very dense, initiating programmes to reduce the pop- ulation by high gillnet exploitation. as a result, a total of 1410 fish in length-class 28–40 cm, that is, mainly mature fish were removed in 1988–1989 (borgstrøm et al. 1993). test fishing in 2004 resulted in a catch of 88 fish, in length-class 14–44 cm, of which 79 were in age-class 1997. correspondingly, 835 fish, of which c. 650 fish belonged to year-class 1997, were removed by gillnetting performed by ullensvang mountain board in july 2005. sample collection in 2009, 40 brown_trout were collected by gillnetting in the lake (ska09). in 2011, 40 juveniles (1+, length-class 4–5 cm, fig. 3) were collected by 487 thaulow et al. fig. 2. the lower part of tributary t2, in late july 2012, showing a typical summer situation with low discharge. electrofishing in the shallow part of the littoral zone in the northern end of the lake (skl; fig. 1). skl was deliberately only sampled for the smallest juve- niles (2010 year-class) in 2011, as older fish may have migrated into this area from the streams. in 2009 and 2010, a total of 40 (n20 + 20) individuals were collected by electrofishing in the outlet (sko), whereas 40 (n17 + 23) and 48 (n11 + 37) individu- als were collected in 2010 and 2011 from the tribu- taries t1 and t2, respectively. in addition, scale samples from 19 individuals captured in the lake in 1967 (ska67) were included to represent the genetic structure before the 1974 and 1982 stocking events. a reference sample of 40 brown_trout from gjuvsja (gju), collected in 2005, was also included, as this was the suggested stocking origin (sønstebø et al. 2008). the ska67 and gju samples were the same as also used by sønstebø et al. (2008). fin clips were collected from all contemporary samples from ska- vatn and preserved in 96% ethanol. otoliths (sagitta) were used to identify year-classes, total length was measured to nearest mm, and sex and maturity stage was determined by visual inspection of the gonads (dahl 1917). genetic analyses dna was extracted from tissue (fin clips) or scales using the enza tissue kit (omega bio-tek, norcross, 488 ssa16nvh, str15inra, loci ga, usa) following the manufactures’ recommenda- tions. final elution was carried out in three rounds of 100 ll each for tissue samples, and 60 ll for scale samples. dna extractions from tissue and scale sam- ples were carried out separately to minimise potential cross-contamination, as were all downstream labora- tory analyses. fifteen microsatellites were analysed (ssa85, ssa197, (table 1), of which eight ssa8nvh, str60inra, str73inra and strutta58) overlap with sønstebø et al. (2008). the 6.3 ll multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) consisted of ca. 125 ng of template dna, 19 qiagen multiplex pcr master mix and 0.2 lm of each primer as either multiplex or singu- lar. thermo-cycling parameters were initiated with heat activation at 95 °c for 15 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 57 °c (hansen et al. 2009) for 90 s and extension at 72 °c for 60 s. the pcr was terminated after 30 min of final extension at 60 °c. pcr conditions were the same for scale samples, except that 0.4 lm of each primer was used without multiplexing, and 37 cycles of denaturing, annealing and extension were conducted. pcr products were analysed on a li-cor 4300 dna analyzer (li-cor biosciences, lincoln, ne, usa) together with a minimum of two 50–350 bp dna ladders (li-cor biosciences). allele scoring was performed using the sagamx software run (li-cor biosciences). each gel lake spawning alpine brown_trout fig. 3. length-class (grey columns) and year-class (black columns) distributions of brown_trout from each sampling location in the ska- vatn area, used in the genetic analyses: gillnetted in the lake (ska09), and sampled by electrofishing in tributaries (t1 and t2), outlet stream (sko), and shallow part of the littoral zone (skl). ska09 (n40) individuals were sampled in 2009, sko (n20 + n20) in 2009 and 2010, t1 (n23 + n17) and t2 (n11 + n37) in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and skl (n40) in 2011. * one fish with hyaline otoliths was not aged. the hatched parts of the columns denote the number, and year-class of individuals removed based upon the colony analysis. included positive controls to ensure consistency between runs. in addition, these positive controls also served to ensure correct scoring of alleles. data analysis the program hp-rare v1.1 (kalinowski 2005) was used to calculate observed numbers of alleles (no) and allelic richness (na), the latter using the rare- fraction option implemented in the programme. genepop v4.1.1 (raymond & rousset 1995; rous- set 2008) was used to test for possible deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium within sampling locations, and linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci in each sample after 200 batches and 10,000 iterations. in all tests of statistical significance, a was 489 thaulow et al. table 1. list of microsatellite loci used for genotyping the seven brown_trout samples, gene bank accession number, forward and reverse primer sequences, and reference. for loci ssa94nvh, ssa207nvh and ssa408uos, a gttt tail was added to the 5′ end of the reverse primer (not shown here). locus genebank accession no. forward reverse reference ssa85 ssa197 ssa8nvh ssa16nvh ssa30nvh ssa52nvh ssa94nvh ssa156nvh ssa207nvh ssa408uos str15inra str60inra str73inra strutta12 strutta58 u43692 u43694 af256661 af256667 af256680 af256702 af256739 af256789 af256836 aj402725 ab001058 ab001057 ab001056 u60220.1 u60223 aggtgggtcctccaagctac gggttgagtagggaggcttg tcctctatcatacggctg tgaaactaggatgcctgg ccaaataactgacaagtgag tgatgggatggtgtttcc aaactaggggtgcatagg gatacagaggaggtgagc agccattactcgggatag aatggattacgggtacgttagaca tgcaggcagacggatcaggc cggtgtgcttgtcaggtttc cctggagatcctccagcagga aatctcaaatcgatcagaag aacaatgactttctctgac acccgctcctcacttaatc tggcagggatttgacataac atcagatgacccagtggc tctgacccacacacaagc cagaggttgataatgggg acatttgcacacgggtag aatgtattgaccgtagtagc taactgctgtggtgtggc agaggacaggagataccac ctcttgtgcaggttcttcatctgt atcctctacgtaagggatttgc gtcaagtcagcaagcctcac ctattctgcttgtaactagaccta agctatttcagacatcacc aaggacttgaaggacgac o’reilly et al.

(2008) showed only scoring mismatches in loci ssa8nvh and ssa85, sug- gesting an error rate of 4.9% (7 of 144 comparisons). a total of 174 alleles were scored from all analysed samples, with allele numbers among loci from 2 to 22 (table 2). the number of significant (p<0.05) deviations from linkage disequilibrium over all sam- pling locations was higher (160) than expected by chance (37 of 735). after fdr correction, 98 (13.3%) pairwise comparisons remained significant (p<0.00697). however, none of the 98 comparisons were significant in all samples. locus ssa207nvh was found to deviate significantly from hardy–wein- berg equilibrium in all samples, except ska67 and gju, and was therefore excluded from further analy- ses (table 2). subsequent analyses were therefore run with 14 polymorphic loci. colony analysis identified 59 full-sibling families, among the sampled individuals from the four suspected spawning loca- tions. sampling locations skl and t1 were both rep- resented by seven full-sibling families, whereas t2 and sko were represented by 26 and 19 full-sibling families, respectively. a total of three families were identified, consisting of 5, 15 and 18 full siblings, with a probability >99%, in sampling locations sko, skl and t1, respectively. these three families were culled to represent four full-siblings each, by random selection within each of the identified families, further analyses were therefore respectively. all based on a reduced data set according to the col- ony reduction, with t1 now being represented by 26 fish, sko by 39, skl by 29 and t2 by 48. the remaining samples, not included in the colony analysis, were represented by 38, 19 and 40, for ska09, ska67 and gju, respectively. structure analyses with all fish gave the high- est delta value at k = 2, with an additional lower peak at k = 4 (see inlet of fig. 4). cluster 1 (shown in violet) was represented by gju and ska67, whereas the remaining samples were all represented by cluster 2 (blue; fig. 4, bottom). comparison of the structuring to a nj of the same samples (fig 4, top) made it evident that only the 100% bootstrap- ping was picked up by the deviation into 2 clusters, but not the remaining two significant (>70%) boot- strapping. gju was eliminated [as we conclude that it was (i) not representing a source sample, (ii) cannot be connected to the initial population due to stocking time and (iii) biases the analyses by dragging the most diverse populations apart from the rest] and the remaining fish reanalysed: structure now sug- gested k = 3 (see inlet in fig. 5). partitioning of individuals into these cluster components within each lake spawning alpine brown_trout sample showed that three clusters were present in all contemporary samples, but at different frequencies (fig. 5, bottom). cluster 1 (green) represented ska67 (91%) and also comprised the largest compo- nent in skl (48%), while cluster 2 (blue) showed largest representation within t2 (60%), and cluster 3 (red) in sko (65%) and t1 (48%). the ska09 sam- ple was partitioned into 25%, 48% and 27% from cluster 1, 2 and 3, respectively. figure 5 (top) shows a nj with indication of the main assignment to the three coloured clusters and parallels the significant bootstrapping. discussion lake spawning many populations of freshwater fishes are genetically differentiated (e.g., sepulveda-villet & stepien 2011; telles et al. 2011; kapuscinski et al. 2013), possibly as a consequence of homing to specific spawning areas, and thereby restricting the gene flow between populations (carvalho 1993). we estimated three unique genetic clusters within the six samples from skavatn, but the brown_trout population in this lake seem to be less diversified compared with published records for brown_trout in larger lake and stream sys- tems (ferguson & taggart 1991; heggenes et al. 2009; swatdipong et al. 2010), or other salmonid spe- cies, such as atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) and bull (salvelinus_confluentus suckley 1859; v€ah€a trout et al. 2007; warnock et al. 2010). yet, the most important observation here comprises three facts: (i) 1+ juveniles in the lake were caught only along the shallow littoral part of the north and north-western shores (skl), (ii) this location coincides with the larg- est potential groundwater supply from the surrounding catchment, lake spawning (brabrand et al. 2002) and (iii) these juve- niles had the highest similarity to the initial popula- tion. lake spawning as a reproductive strategy for brown_trout has been reported from several lakes in norway, foremost in lakes where brown_trout is allo- patric (e.g., jensen & senstad 1962; barlaup et al. 1998; heggenes et al. 2009), like in skavatn. the identification of genetically diverse juveniles in our sample from the littoral zone potentially indicates that lake spawning not necessarily is a function of local adaptation, but rather the willingness of foreign indi- viduals to utilise suitable groundwater influx for spon- taneous lake spawning, as has been experimentally demonstrated (brabrand et al. 2006). we further assume that the harsh weather conditions and the low water supply to lake skavatn restrict stream spawning in some years and that lake spawning might offer a stabilizing factor. in a neighbouring lake, krokavatn, thereby suggesting conditions for 491 thaulow et al. table 2. summary statistics for genetic variation at 15 microsatellite loci in the seven analysed samples. sample ska09 11 10.956 ns 4 4.000 ns 2 2.000 ns 4 4.000 ns 4 3.998 ns 6 5.992 ns 2 2.000 ns 3 2.992 ns 10 9.687 ns 10 9.485 ns 12 11.410 ns 9 8.804 *** 9 8.554 ns 13 12.056 ns 6 6.000 ns loci ssa16nvh no na hwe ssa8nvh no na hwe ssa30nvh no na hwe ssa85 no na hwe ssa197 no na hwe str15inra no na hwe str60inra no na hwe str73inra no na hwe strutta58 no na hwe strutta12 no na hwe ssa408uos no na hwe ssa207nvh(a) no na hwe ssa94nvh no na hwe ssa52nvh no na hwe ssa156nvh no na hwe t1 t2 sko skl ska67 gju 10 9.732 ***(b) 5 4.736 ns 2 1.997 ns 4 4.000 ns 5 4.440 ns 5 5.000 * 2 1.995 ns 3 2.940 ns 10 9.705 ns 8 7.486 ns 10 9.675 *** 7 6.972 * 10 9.676 * 15 13.618 ns 6 5.630 * 12 11.452 ns 4 4.000 ns 2 1.994 ns 4 4.000 ns 4 3.862 ns 6 5.862 ns 2 2.000 ns 2 2.000 ns 12 11.319 ns 10 8.731 ns 10 8.956 ns 10 9.188 *** 11 9.769 ns 10 9.561 ns 6 5.998 ns 13 11.985 ns 5 4.880 ns 2 2.000 ns 4 4.000 ns 6 5.937 ns 6 6.000 ns 3 2.934 ns 3 3.000 ns 12 11.378 **(b) 12 11.375 ns 13 12.161 ns 12 11.349 *** 13 12.259 ns 12 11.458 ns 8 7.440 ns 12 11.408 *** 4 4.000 ns 2 1.750 - 5 4.940 ns 5 4.750 ns 5 4.997 ns 2 1.999 ns 3 3.000 ns 9 8.906 ns 8 7.676 * 8 7.500 *** 7 6.948 *** 9 8.477 *** 12 10.926 * 9 8.423 ***(b) 7 7.000 ns 5 5.000 ns 2 2.000 ns 3 3.000 ns 5 5.000 ns 5 5.000 ns 2 2.000 ns 2 2.000 ns 6 6.000 ns 8 8.000 ns 7 7.000 ns 6 6.000 ns 9 9.000 ns 9 9.000 ns 10 10.000 ns 9 8.542 ns 3 2.986 ns 2 1.997 ns 5 4.676 ns 4 3.986 ns 4 3.999 ns 2 1.995 ns 3 2.999 ns 6 5.690 ns 11 10.303 ns 9 8.905 ns 11 9.876 ns 11 10.465 ns 11 10.468 ns 10 9.485 ns total 17 5 2 6 9 7 3 3 13 19 13 19 18 22 18 fdr (k = 15) significance levels: *5%, **1%, ***0.1%. ns, not significant;

elliott 1994), and end up in the downstream stretch or ascending to the littoral area, although none was captured by electrofishing in this part of the lake in the current study. in years with optimal water flow 494 conditions may result and survival, more juvenile individuals may pass the obstacle, thereby still maintaining a spawning stock homing to the outlet. these three potential spawning habitats have in common that fluctuations in environ- mental annual variations in the recruitment contribution from each of them. the proportion of the identified genetic clus- ters in the total lake population may therefore decline or increase in abundance over time, that is, more or less as has been observed in, for example, sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka walbaum 1792; hil- born et al. 2003). in large conclusion the the partial persistence of this study demonstrates that diversity at both the molecular and the ecological level may exist in small brown_trout populations. lake spawning as a repro- ductive strategy seems to provide the best explana- tion for initial population despite successful stocking of foreign fish. as enhancement stocking most probably is used mainly in periods with low population density as a result of intensive fishing or low natural recruitment (thaulow et al. 2013), stocked foreign individuals may be successful in all possible spawning habitats, including both tributaries and outlet, as well as the lake itself. stocking of individuals with foreign geno- types may therefore easily lead to changes in the genetic structure of initial populations, as observed in the present study. for salmonids, separation between spawning units may be the result of homing to differ- ent spawning locations, that is, genetic differentiation et al. 2010; between tributaries swatdipong et al. 2010), isolation (dynes et al. 1999; zimmerman & reeves 2000) and differences in spawning strategies (hendry et al. 2000; heggenes et al. 2009; and this study). there- fore, all life-history aspects and spawning strategies should be considered and included when future recruitment is estimated as part of population assess- ments. a typical example is compensatory stocking in hydroelectric reservoirs, which often is based on assumed loss of recruitment areas in running waters, without considering lake spawning, and thereby potentially overestimating the need for stocking. the presence of lake spawning should therefore be identi- fied before enhancement or compensatory stocking is decided upon.
