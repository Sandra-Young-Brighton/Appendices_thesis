e-mail: jgortazar@ecohidraulica.com accepted for publication march 22, 2007 introduction the natural distribution area of brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) ranges within 71–33° north in europe. the northernmost populations are in iceland, northern scandinavia and russia, and the southern limit is in the mountain streams of northern morocco (elliott 1994). close to this southern boundary, the region of andalusia (southern iberian peninsula) maintains indigenous brown_trout populations that have been isolated in mountain streams since the last glacial period. despite the abundance of scientiﬁc literature on brown_trout ecology and biology, very few studies have focused on the southernmost natural populations. even within the iberian peninsula, most papers have dealt with northern or central populations. moreover, brown_trout in andalusia is endangered by human pressures, and has been declared ‘at risk of extinction’ (franco ruiz & rodrı´guez de los santos 2001), so anglers are forbidden to kill their captures since 2005. this protection status highlights the importance of good management practices for the species’ conservation in this region. to fulﬁl this task, it is necessary to achieve a sound knowledge of the ecology and biology of brown_trout in this latitude. longevity, lifespan, proportion of geographical latitude has been shown to be related to several life history traits, like growth, age at ﬁrst maturity, repeat spawners and smolt age (jonsson & l’abe´e-lund 1993). the most important factor responsible for these clines is probably water temperature (elliott 1982). in particular, latitude affects the spawning period: brown_trout spawn earlier the higher the latitude because of the lower water temperature and the longer egg incubation period (klemetsen et al. 2003). for in- stance, the inﬂuence of low latitude on the spawning doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00246.x 515 gorta´zar et al. period has been documented in the river aller (northern spain, latitude: 43°10¢n), where garcı´a & bran˜a (1988) reported that spawning took place from late january to late march. such belated reproduction has important implications in ﬁsheries management, as ﬁshing should be forbidden during spawning and incubation in order to protect the recruitment. popu- lations located even further south are likely to show even later spawning dates. the present study deals with the population in the river castril, which is one of the best preserved in andalusia and has no introgression of foreign trout alleles. it also shows very low genetic diversity due to a strong process of genetic drift, caused by the small population size and its isolation (p. martı´nez, personal communication). the objectives of this study were to identify the spawning time and duration, the potential relation of these traits to environmental conditions, particularly the ﬂow regime unpredictability, and to compare our ﬁndings on the spawning period with published data from other natural populations. redd counts were chosen to identify the spawning period, as they are less expensive and less disruptive than other population monitoring methods (dunham et al. 2001). salmonid redd counts have been used for a variety of purposes: to detect trends in the population size (rieman & myers 1997), to predict parr abundance (beland 1996), to analyse the spatial variability of reproduction (beard & carline 1991; mayo et al. 1995; baxter et al. 1999) or to identify the spawning period of brown_trout populations (cham- pigneulle et al. 1988, 2003), among others. redd counts are a relative index of the intensity of spawning, if several surveys are done during the whole spawning season (champigneulle et al. 1988). we also chose this method for conservation reasons, since it does not require the sacriﬁce of any ﬁsh (dunham et al. 2001). material and methods study site it rises at 1283 m.a.s.l., the river castril is an aquifer-fed mountain stream located in the province of granada (andalusia, southern spain, fig. 1), between 37°48¢–37°54¢ north and 2°46¢ west. in the limestone southern slopes of the segura mountains, and ﬂows southward into the river guadiana menor, which is a tributary of the river guadalquivir. the aquifer provides a rather constant water temperature throughout the year (yearly range in the headwaters: 8.8–10.2 °c). this region has the mediterranean climate, which makes the ﬂow regime highly unpre- dictable: high ﬂows usually occur in winter and/or spring, but there are also very dry years, and others 516 fig. 1. map of the iberian peninsula showing the geographical situation of the river castril. the location of the impassable obstacles (transverse lines), the town of castril (light grey), redd counts reaches, electroﬁshing sites (open circles) and temperature data loggers (t) are also shown. with two or three peak ﬂows which may occur in summer or autumn (fig. 2). our study was conducted in the uppermost part of the river, where brown_trout is the only ﬁsh species present. in the study area there are several impassable anthropogenic obstacles (fig. 1), described here from upstream to downstream: a small hydroelectric dam in the headwaters; a 500 m long reach, where the river becomes to ﬂow detraction subterranean, upstream; the dam of el portillo reservoir, which releases water from the bottom; and when passing through the town of castril there are two ramps to dissipate hydraulic energy. thus, the castril brown_trout population is divided into several isolated groups. the area upstream of the reservoir belongs to the sierra de castril natural park. due redd counts water clarity, stream ﬂow, gradient and width (ca. 8 m) enabled good visibility and working condi- spawning of southern brown_trout fig. 2. historical ﬂow regimes for 23 years, illustrating interannual unpredictability. tions during ﬁeldwork. redds were identiﬁed by their characteristic conﬁguration, with a pit upstream followed immediately by a dome downstream, and by a lack of periphyton over the substrate, caused by female digging activities (crisp & carling 1989; grost et al. 1991; delacoste et al. 1993). excavations with- out an obvious tailspill were not considered as redds. the relationships between redd tail length, horizontal dimensions of redds and ﬁsh length given by crisp & carling (1989) were used to estimate a minimum redd size. thus, any redd shorter than 60 cm in total length (tl) was rejected in the analyses. for conservation reasons, we did not excavate any redd to check for the presence of eggs, but several were positively con- ﬁrmed as redds by observing spawning trout. a preliminary survey was conducted in the 2003– 2004 season to roughly identify the spawning period and to select the reaches that would be surveyed the following year. study reaches were chosen based on the presence of suitable spawning habitat and on their accessibility. four visits to the stream were conducted during the preliminary survey: in late october, early december, mid-february and early march. these visits were conducted by walking along the riverbank without entering the riverbed, so the sampling effort was much lower than that of the following year (see below). the main survey in 2004–2005 was conducted in four stream reaches (reaches 1–4, fig. 1, table 1). we decided to survey quite long stream reaches weekly, instead of intensively surveying small index areas, for the following reasons: (i) the expectation of a long spawning period;

(1993). the macrohabitat types considered were rifﬂe, run, glide and pool, named from faster and shallower to slower and deeper. when the redd was located in the transition between two different macrohabitats, both of them were included. redds were considered to be ‘close to the water’s edge’ if they were <25 cm from the margin. any redd already recorded in a previous survey was measured again to see if it had increased in size, and it was compared with the previous sketch to check for changes in its conﬁguration (position and size of pit and dome). comparison of redd sketches, photographs and horizontal dimensions served to ascertain whether the redd remained unchanged or had increased due to superimposition. if the redd had changed, new meas- urements, photographs and a sketch were made. visual surveys of redds were conducted every week, except at the end of the season, when surveys were conducted every second week. several problems (mainly increases in stream ﬂow and turbidity) 518 prevented us from surveying all the reaches on every visit to the stream. in particular, a high ﬂow around 15 march impeded ﬁeldwork on reaches 2 and 3 for 3 weeks. spawning period to identify the temporal development of brown_trout reproduction in the castril, the accumulated number of redds was plotted against time. following knapp & vredenburg (1996) we counted the number of new redds plus the number of redds that had changed signiﬁcantly since the previous count. in this way, we also considered superimposed redds, thus minimising the bias of the estimate of the actual redd numbers. the relationship between redd size and time was analysed by simple regression. to compare our results with those from other populations, we carried out a literature review on the brown_trout spawning period throughout the natural distribution area of the species. the data obtained from the bibliography were average spawning date, duration of the spawning period, latitude and altitude. the literature usually reports the spawning period with low precision (e.g., 7 or 15 days). we used the date in the middle of the spawning period reported in each paper as the average spawning date. the data were analysed by means of simple and multiple regressions. water temperature and ﬂow data water temperature was recorded every 2 h at four sites on the river (fig. 1) using vemco minilog data loggers. historical ﬂow data were recorded where the river ﬂows into the reservoir. daily mean ﬂow data for the study season were obtained from the reservoir inﬂow and outﬂow data. all ﬂow data were provided by the confederacio´ n hidrogra´ﬁca del guadalquivir (guadalquivir water authority). spawner data electroﬁshing was performed in february 2004 at six sites on the river (fig. 1). fork length and live weight were measured and scales were taken. maturity was tested by gently squeezing ﬁsh to determine ripeness. at the sites connected with the reservoir, scales from mature trout were examined to ﬁnd zones with high growth, typical of the reservoir phase (champigneulle et al. 1988). this allowed us to determine whether each mature trout came from the reservoir or from the stream. a mann–whitney test was performed to compare the lengths of the two types of spawners (reservoir and stream dwelling). results spawning period in the ﬁrst visual survey in 2004–2005, ﬁve redds were found on reach 3, on 22 december, so reproduction had started before. the spawning season ended before 27 april, when the last redd was detected, and after 12 april, when the previous survey was conducted. we found two different patterns in the development of the spawning activity in the castril (fig. 3). on one hand, on reaches 2 and 3 (on the middle part of the river, connected to each other and to the reservoir), the spawning period lasted more than 3 months. it started in december or early january and ended in april. spawning took place about 2 weeks later on reach 2 than on reach 3. on reach 3, there was more spawning activity at the beginning of the reproductive period, so 50% of the total redds were already recorded by 29 january. on reach 2, 50% of the total redd count was not attained until 22 february (fig. 3). on the other hand, on reaches 1 (headwaters, isolated from the rest of the river) and 4 (downstream of the reservoir, also isolated), spawning only lasted approximately a month and a half. it started in the second week of february and ended in late march. in the middle of the spawning season, a slight drop in the number of new redds was detected on reaches 2 and 3, resulting in two peaks of reproductive intensity: one in the ﬁrst half of february and the second in late fig. 3. summary of the spawning period on the river castril, showing 10%,

southern brown_trout february to early march (fig. 4). this decrease happened one week later on reach 2, following the temporal pattern described above (delayed spawning on reach 2). this slight drop was related neither to water temperature nor to stream ﬂow, and it was more drastic on reach 2. results from the preliminary survey conducted in 2003–2004 were consistent with those from the more intensive 2004–2005 sampling. in the former season no redds were seen in or before early december, 67.9% of the redds were detected in mid-february and 32.1% in early march. is completely different

(ca. 4 m3æs on reach 4, the ﬂow regime is altered by the reservoir, so it from the natural reproduction began after a slight drop in the ﬂow, but, at the same time, as on reach 1. during the high ﬂow on 15 march, reproduction continued on reaches 1 and 4, despite the fact that surveys were impeded on the more affected reaches (2 and 3). when the water level subsided on reaches 2 and 3, few more new redds were observed there (fig. 4). regime. here, because the castril is fed by an aquifer, the water temperature is extremely constant, especially on reach 1, close to the main spring. throughout the spawning period, the greatest variability was recorded on reach 3. in the headwaters (reach 1), the water temperature never went outside the interval of 8.8–9.9 °c. the temperature on reach 4 is inﬂuenced by the reservoir bottom outlet, so it is colder and more constant than expected (table 1). on the reaches with less variable temperature regimes (1 and 4), spawning was concen- trated in february and march and it lasted for about a month and a half. spawner and redd features during the electroﬁshing survey, 14 mature trout were captured. eleven of them were stream dwelling (fork length ranged within 16.6–22.1 cm) and three were spawners from the reservoir (48–59.8 cm). mature brown_trout from the reservoir were signiﬁcantly longer than stream-dwelling ﬁsh (mann–whitney test p < 0.05). reach 3 had the highest number of redds and the highest redd density, while the isolated reaches (1 and 4) showed the lowest values (table 1). there was no signiﬁcant relationship between total redd length and date on the isolated reaches (p ¼ 0.92, fig. 5a). however, in the part of the stream that is connected 519 gorta´zar et al. fig. 4.

(p ¼ 0.29) mean spawning date yielded a signiﬁcant relationship (p < 0.0001) which accounted for 62.84% of the variability (fig. 6a). furthermore, altitude was not signiﬁcant in the multiple regression between the spawning period duration and latitude and altitude, and the model was not signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.11). however, simple regression between latitude and spawning duration yielded a signiﬁcant relationship (p < 0.006) which accounted for 24.4% of the variability (fig. 6b). discussion spawning period it was not possible to precisely identify the start of spawning, as ﬁve redds were already found in the ﬁrst survey on reach 3. however, the preliminary survey showed that there were no redds in early december. therefore, assuming that the spawning period does not change signiﬁcantly between years (anderson 1983; champigneulle et al. 1988; scott 1990; sorensen et al. 1995), we can state that spawning in the castril began in december. the river castril showed the latest date for brown_trout reproduction mentioned in the literature: from december until april. however, this belated spawning period agrees with the known latitudinal cline: spawning is earlier the higher the latitude (klemetsen et al. 2003). our literature review clearly showed the inﬂuence of latitude on the spawning date, but it did not show the inﬂuence of altitude, although both variables are known to be related (illies & botosanea- fig. 6. simple regression analysis between latitude and (a) mean spawning date, and (b) duration of spawning period. solid circles represent data from this study. open circles are data from the literature (see appendix). nu 1963). the lack of signiﬁcance of this variable might be due to the scarcity of altitude data obtained from the literature review: stream altitude is shown in only 12 populations of 29 reviewed. regression between spawning duration and latitude the lower the latitude the longer the showed that spawning period (fig. 5b). the causes of this latitu- dinal cline might be linked to temperature and habitat predictability, although the low coefﬁcient of deter- mination reﬂects the high variability among stream habitats even at similar latitudes. as water temperature is not such a strong environmental constraint in warmer streams, southern trout populations might have the opportunity to mature and spawn over a wider time range. we believe that habitat predictability also inﬂuences the duration of the spawning period, as is explained below. historical ﬂow records show that the river castril is not a predictable habitat (fig. 2). the mediterranean climate of this region shapes the ﬂow regime, making its interannual variations highly unpredictable: peak ﬂows may occur at any time during the spawning season. we support that a long spawning period is an advantage for survival in unpredictable habitats. it is known that a catastrophic event (like a spate or a drought) may weaken the year’s recruitment if it happens at the critical stages of the life cycle (e.g., frost & brown 1967; anderson 1983; spina 2001; cattane´o et al. 2002) and thus, it might put the population at risk. speciﬁcally, stream the hypothesis 521 gorta´zar et al. ﬂow has been highlighted as a major factor affecting the recruitment of stream brown_trout (jensen & johnsen 1999; alonso-gonza´lez et al. 2004; lobo´ n- cervia´ 2004; lobo´ n-cervia´ & rinco´n 2004; lobo´ n- cervia´ & mortensen 2005). in unpredictable habitats, where it is not possible to know when a catastrophic event will occur, it is a great advantage to spawn over a long period, and in this way it is more likely that at least a part of the recruitment will survive each year. champigneulle et al. (2003) already suggested that spatio-temporal dispersion of reproduction is likely to impede population extinction. several researchers have provided evidence for this hypothesis in other ﬁsh groups (bye 1984; munro 1990; mazzoni & iglesias-rios 2002). we have suggested that habitat predictability may be linked to the latitudinal cline found in our literature review: the lower the latitude the longer the duration of spawning. despite the huge variability in habitat predictability throughout the brown_trout’s natural distribution range, northern streams might be somewhat more predictable than southern ones. if this was the case, it would support the hypothesis that unpredicta- bility in southern habitats may be a reason for the longer spawning periods detected in southern populations. although the advantage of a long spawning period is clear in unpredictable habitats, its origin may be adaptive or phenotypic. the phenotypic plasticity of brown_trout is well known and documented (e.g., elliott 1994) and thus may be responsible for this characteristic. however, a genetic origin of this phenomenon cannot be ruled out, because these southern populations have been isolated in mountain streams since the last glacial retreat (ca. 13,000 years ago), and processes of speciation may well have been taking place. brown_trout populations which have naturally persisted in isolated headwaters may have developed adaptations to particular environmental conditions (northcote 1992; elliott 1994). inﬂuence of stream ﬂow and water temperature increasing water ﬂow is known to force brown_trout to abandon redd construction, although some individuals may still be able to spawn near the water’s edge (pender & kwak 2002). on reaches 2 and 3, it was not possible to determine whether spawning was impeded or not during the spate, because surveys were aborted at that time. sediment deposition during decreasing ﬂows may have covered redds built during that period. thus, it is possible that redd numbers after the spate were underestimated. low water temperature can lead to a cessation in spawning activity. libosvarsky (1974, 1976) found a break in reproduction when the temperature fell below 3 °c. beall & de gaudemar (1999) observed that 522 spawning stops below 3–4 °c for atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.). however, in the river castril the water temperature was not so extreme. the coldest temperature was 4.2 °c (table 1), attained on reach 3 only for 2 days and no break was observed. further- more, the water temperature in the castril was always within the brown_trout ‘growth zone’, as deﬁned by elliott (1994). redd features beard & carline (1991) reported roughly similar redd )2) to those observed densities (0.02–1.06 reddsæ100 m in the castril (table 1). the highest redd density in our study (reach 3) was slightly lower than that reported by rubin et al.

(2003) in a highly fragmented )2) greatly excee- mountain stream (6.3 reddsæ100 m ded the castril redd densities. this suggests that habitat fragmentation may lead to an increase in redd densities in the areas with suitable spawning habitat. most of the redds in the castril were situated in places where intragravel ﬂow was likely to occur, as stated by previous researchers (crisp & carling 1989; baglinie`re & maisse 2002, among others). many redds (15.6%) were excavated close to the water’s edge, more than in the river dulce in central spain (4.2%, mayo et al. 1995). as most of the redds were built at or near base ﬂow, there was no risk of dewatering for egg pockets laid beside the margins. we observed a similar proportion of redds in glides and pool tailouts than in river dulce (mayo et al. 1995). however, we found fewer redds in the middle of pools (10% in the dulce) and more in rifﬂes or runs (10% in the dulce). the spatial dispersion of redd sites among different macrohabitats may be a good system to avoid complete loss of the offspring if a catastrophic event happens (champigneulle et al. 2003). redds located in different macrohabitats may have different probabili- ties of being destroyed, for instance, by a high ﬂow which may scour the gravels and the eggs (kondolf et al. 1991), or by a drought, which may leave the shallower redds stranded. the percentage of superimposed redds was very high in some parts of the stream, especially on reach 3 (table 1). superimposition rates in the castril were among the highest values reported in the literature for brown_trout (anderson 1983; beard & carline 1991; essington et al. 1998; rubin et al. 2004). the reservoir inﬂuence our results showed two different spawning patterns: on the reaches connected with the reservoir, the spawning period lasted more than 3 months, twice as long as on the isolated reaches. the presence of spawners from the reservoir, which are signiﬁcantly larger than stream residents, may partly explain the long spawning season on reaches 2 and 3: larger females are known to excavate larger redds than smaller females (ottaway et al. 1981; champigneulle et al. 1988; crisp & carling 1989) and the redd length decreased with time on reaches 2 and 3, although this accounted for very little variability. more signiﬁcant was the absence of redds longer than 1.9 m after 10 march (fig. 6b), suggesting that the ﬁsh which spawned on very late dates were from the stream- resident population, which is usual in salmonids (e.g., campbell 1977; elliott 1984; knapp & vredenburg 1996; jonsson & jonsson 1999). the slight drop in spawning activity in the second half of february suggests that there may be two waves of spawners: migrants from the reservoir spawning ﬁrst, followed by the smaller stream-dwelling trout. furthermore, larger females are known to bury their eggs deeper (van den berghe & gross 1984, 1989). as there is a high rate of redd superimposition, it would be logical for smaller females to spawn later to avoid having their nests destroyed by larger females, whereas the progeny of larger females would be less susceptible to damage from the superimposition of smaller spawners (van den berghe & gross 1984). therefore, the long spawning period may be partly explained by the competition for spawning space between the large reservoir and the small-resident trout. nevertheless, there is another part of the river, isolated from the reservoir, which might have a similar spawning pattern: data were also gathered from reach 5, which is located about 1 km downstream from the lowermost sampling site (fig. 1). due to logistical constraints, reach 5 was only surveyed during january. these limited data showed that there were spawning trout in reach 5 at least from 3 january, about the same time that spawning began on reach 2. this suggests that the spawning duration on reach 5 might be similar to that on reach 2, even though there are no reservoir spawners here. however, the duration of spawning on reach 5 remains unknown, so at this point it is not possible to answer this question. it would be very valuable to identify the different population compo- nents on reaches 2 and 3 and to obtain systematic redd counts on reach 5. in any case, the shorter spawning period on reaches 1 and 4 may also be related to other factors: (i) the weak environmental constraints on these reaches can lead brown_trout to concentrate their spawning, as it is more unlikely that catastrophic events would destroy the recruitment: the headwaters beneﬁt from a constant water temperature and less drastic spates; on reach 4, the reservoir outlet provides a smoothened ﬂow spawning of southern brown_trout regime and similar temperatures to those in the headwaters. (ii) the small population size caused by habitat fragmentation: it has been observed by anglers and managers that smaller trout populations usually show shorter spawning durations. this highlights the problems with habitat fragmentation, and emphasises the need for suitable spawning habitat along the river continuum. sampling error there are several potential sources of sampling error in redd counts: interobserver variability, redd age, redd density and variation in ﬁeldwork conditions due to changes in stream ﬂow or turbidity (dunham et al. 2001). other problems with this method are the delineation between test-digs and actual redds and the phenomenon of redd superimposition (al-chokhachy et al. 2005). in this study, throughout is possible, however, interobserver variability had no inﬂuence as all the surveys were performed by the same researcher. similarly, redd age was probably irrelevant because the observed new redds were never more than 2 weeks old. visibility conditions were good and rather constant the spawning season, except for the spate on 15 march, when the surveys were aborted until the ﬂow subsided and the turbidity disappeared. it that redds built during the high ﬂow period remained undetected. redd density has been shown to increase the omissions of actual redds (dunham et al. 2001), and redd superimposition may act in the same direction, so redd numbers may have been underesti- mated when surveying at high redd densities and high superimposition rates. however, these biases would have decreased the number of redds detected in the middle of the spawning season, especially on reaches 2 and 3, but they do not detract from our main results, namely the long spawning period and the dates in which it occurred. finally, it is difﬁcult to distinguish between test-digs and redds without excavation to ﬁnd eggs (dunham et al. 2001). to address this problem, any redd without an obvious tailspill (dunham et al. 2001) or shorter than 60 cm in tl was systematically rejected in the analyses. in conclusion, we reported here on the reproduction of a natural brown_trout population close to the southern limit of the species distribution. it has shown a belated and protracted spawning period which has important implications in population management and conservation. our ﬁndings highlight the importance of a sound knowledge of brown_trout ecology and biology at this extreme latitude for which there is a critical lack of data. further research is also needed in different predictable and unpredictable habitats to check the hypotheses proposed above and to better 523 gorta´zar et al. understand the factors that determine the duration of spawning in brown_trout populations. acknowledgements we thank javier lobo´ n-cervia´ (csic, spain) and eddy beall (inra, st pe´e-sur-nivelle, france) for their helpful comments on our work. we also thank jose´ marı´a montoro (director of sierra de castril natural park) and the regional government of andalusia for allowing us to survey in the river castril. paulino martı´nez (university of santiago de compostela) showed us and commented on the results of the genetic analysis. the natural park guards shared their knowledge and experience on the river with us. the guadalquivir water authority provided us with stream ﬂow data. olga herranz and javier herranz did excellent ﬁeldwork. this work was partially funded by a postgraduate grant awarded to j. gorta´zar by the polytechnic university of madrid. we also thank the company ecohidra´ulica s.l.
