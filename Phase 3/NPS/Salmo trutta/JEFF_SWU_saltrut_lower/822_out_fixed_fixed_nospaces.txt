dynamics of reproductive isolation during secondary contacts. the high levels of hybridisation and introgression between atlantic and mediterranean lineages in contemporary populations of brown_trout in the northern part of the french alps are a good case in point. after a long period of allopatry, which one assumes has facilitated their divergent phenotypic and genetic evolution, man has removed a geographical reproductive barrier via stocking the atlantic lineage in the mediterranean area, thereby potentially enabling gene flow between native and non native populations. we investigate how much a prezygotic reproductive behaviour, that is female preference for male phenotype, can influence hybridisation in natural environments, using subaquatic video recording of reproduction. our statistical model indicates that female preference appears to be largely heterogamous: females tend to select dissimilar males with respect to their own phenotype; thus, rather than acting as a barrier to gene flow, female preference is favouring gene flow between lineages that have been artificially placed in sympatry. this finding based on observational data is in agreement with previously reported genetic data, high levels of hybridisation between the lineages. we suggest that a knowledge of reproductive behaviour in natural environments is an essential tool for biodiversity managers to assess the potential risks associated with the introduction into recipient populations of non-native lineage fish at the intraspecific level. key words: female preference; secondary contact; intraspecific biodiversity; reproductive isolation; hybridisation introduction evolution of reproductive isolation is central to the understanding of possible routes to speciation (sch- luter 2000). an expected reinforcing mechanism for reproductive isolation lies in the preference for locally adapted phenotypes (fisher 1930; lande 1981). the rationale is that through natural selection, local individuals have a fitness advantage over migrants and consequently should be preferred as sexual partners (williams 1966). yet, a number of recent experimental or theoretical studies point to the absence of a correlation between evolution of pheno- type and mate preference (martin & mendelson 2013; r€as€anen et al. 2014; servedio & b€urger 2014), while in natura there is little evidence to support this idea (raeymaekers et al. 2010). this question is equally crucial for the management of biodiversity at both inter- and intraspecific levels (crandall et al. 2000), where lack of reproductive isolation can lead to dramatic loss of diversity following human medi- ated introductions or population reinforcements. salmonids species are largely impacted by these prac- tices (hansen et al. 2009) and they often show high levels of local adaptation (fraser et al. 2011). the brown_trout (salmo_trutta, l.) itself displays a high level of intraspecific variation, with potentially five genetic distinct lineages that have evolved independently fol- lowing their separation an estimated 0.5–2 ma (bernat- chez 2001). as a result, phenotypic differences have arisen between the lineages. for example, atlantic (atl) and mediterranean (med) lineages show signifi- correspondence: jacques labonne, umr 1224 ecobiop, aquap^ole inra, quartier ibarron, 64310, saint-pee sur nivelle, france.

lineages have been brought into sympatry through intensive stocking in the mediterranean area (barbat-leterrier et al. 1989). the outcome of these practices is heterogeneous, but many rivers now shelter introgressed populations with a large numbers of viable hybrids (hyb). the reasons behind this incomplete reproductive isolation between lineages remain largely unexplored. in salmonids, female preference is a putative candi- date for prezygotic reproductive isolation. some phe- notypic traits are known to be preferred by females like body size (quinn & foote 1994), body size ratio (labonne et al. 2009) and adipose fin size (petersson et al. 2009). the honesty of some signals has also been demonstrated (i.e., signals that may inform the partner about potential direct or indirect benefits). for instance, in arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus, l.), increased male ornamentation signals lower suscepti- bility to parasite infection (skarstein et al. 2005), and in atl brown_trout, paternal melanin-based colora- tion is positively correlated to offspring survival (wedekind et al. 2008). and yet, very few studies have directly investigated the influence of female preference and its mechanisms on reproductive isolation directly in wild populations. studies undertaken under natural conditions allow the actual strength of mechanisms at work to be measured (qvarnstr€om et al. 2006). here, we investigate possi- ble reproductive barriers related to female preference for male phenotype in natura, using video recording, lineage-related phenotypic indicators and a behaviour- al model to describe female preference. three differ- ent versions of the model are evaluated to explain observed data: a null model, where preference is based on body size and osr only (labonne et al. 2009); a model with preference based on phenotypic dissimilarity; a lineage dependent preference model. our results are interpreted with regard to the pub- lished introgression patterns in this species and with regard to the general expectation of female preference evolution following a secondary contact. we finish by discussing the relevance of our findings and approach for other similar salmonids conservation issues. methods data sampling during two spawning seasons (winters 2011–2012 and 2012–2013), we monitored the mating behaviour of brown_trout in natura using subaquatic videos in four streams located in the northern french alps (river borne, river dranse d’abondance, chevenne creek, serve creek) 07.40e’’/ 0 57.68n’’;6°24 0 (46.55 preference for phenotypic dissimilarity 0

observation unit (ou) every video sequence longer than 15 min in which an active female (i.e., digging a nest) was seen in the presence of at least one male. the ou was stopped if the female left the redd for more than 20 min. the camera was installed 50 cm from the redd, a distance sufficient to distinguish and analyze fish phenotypes. a ruler was placed behind the nest to measure fish. sixty ous were thus obtained for analysis. fish were individually identified using body size and a set of four traits, which could be unambiguously associated with either med or atl lineages: presence of stripes; absence of spot aureole; absence of lateral line; and number of opercular spots (lascaux 1996; aparicio et al. 2005; see appendix s1). the first two traits are categorical variables with two modalities: presence of stripes and absence of spot aureole are both med characters. the lateral line trait is a cate- gorical variable with three modalities: absence (med), partial (hyb) and present (atl). the num- ber or opercular spots is a quantitative trait ranging between 0 and 26 in our data; a high number of oper- cular spots indicate med origin and vice versa. we had individual identities assigned to 58 males and 27 females. in some cases, one of the traits could not be satisfactorily assessed (3.5% of individualised fish). operational sex ratio (osr) was calculated as the number of males observed in attendance to females in the ou. using jwatcher freeware (blumstein & daniel 2007), we noted the occurrence of the follow- ing behaviours: arrival and departures from the scope of the camera by either male or female, and digging movements by the female. a total of 499 behavioural events were recorded. calculation of a phenotypic score based on the four discriminant documented pheno- typic traits, we calculated a general phenotypic score p as the mean of the score at each trait (table 1) as follows: table 1. modalities for the various phenotypic traits, the origin they can be unambiguously linked to and their value in the calculation of a phenotypic score. phenotypic trait modalities origin associated value for calculation presence of stripes lack of spot aureole lack

dissimilarity between a pair of male and female (d) was calculated as the absolute value of difference between male and female scores. preference model the behavioural model is directly derived from a pre- vious published study (labonne et al. 2009) (fig. 1). it assumes different outcomes following the encounter of a male and a female trout on the redd. first, the female can leave the redd (probability 1-s). if the female stays on the nest, she can be inactive (no dig- ging) or active (probability a). we defined female preference as the product of s and a, that is the proba- bility that a female stays on the nest and is active fol- lowing an encounter with a male. we then fitted three models by inferring the effect of explanatory variables on s and a. the first model (m1) was considered as our null hypothesis and integrated the body size ratio (bsr) and osr (labonne et al. 2009), as well as ran- dom effects to handle male and female pseudoreplica- tion in our observations. as an example, the inference on s probability is described as follows: m1 : logitðsþ ¼ as;j þ bs;k þ cðsþ  bsri þ dðsþ  osri female willingly leave the nest y1 inactive female y2 n s ns active female a y3 fig. 1. behavioural model describing the possible behavioural answers of a female to the presence of a male on the redd. s is the probability for the female to stay on the red and a is the probabil- ity for the female to be active conditional on being present. y1, y2 and y3 are the three possible outcomes of female/male inter- action in this model. 354 the second model (m2) additionally integrated the effect of phenotypic dissimilarity d: m2 : logitðsþ ¼as;j þ bs;k þ cðsþ  bsri þ dðsþ  osri þ fðsþ  di the third model (m3) integrated the score of the male (pj), the score of the female (pk) and the inter- action between both, thus assuming that female pref- erence could be lineage dependent. m3 : logits ¼as;j þ bs;k þ cðsþ  bsri þ dðsþ  osri þ gðsþ  pj þ hðsþ  pk þ kðsþ 

the model code, random effects and noninformative prior distributions are pro- vided in appendix s2. statistical inference was conducted in the bayesian framework using openbugs software (3.2.2). the joint values of hyperparameters were obtained by mcmc samplings (10,000 draws, thinning = 10) after check- ing its convergence using the gelman–rubin diagnos- tic (gelman & rubin 1992) based on a 5000 draws undertaken as part of a burning-in period. the three models were compared using the deviance information criterion (dic, spiegelhalter et al. 2002). for the best model, we evaluated the percentage of correct predic- tions made from the model posterior compared to the observed data. results observation data summary the distribution of observed phenotypes on redds shows that males often present an intermediate pheno- typic score p (around 0.5, fig. 2a) with fewer individ- uals presenting phenotypically pure values of 0 or 1. female scores are more evenly distributed between 0 and 1, although intermediate scores still represent the majority of individuals. as a result, some combina- tions of male and female with extreme phenotypes are less represented. the distribution of behavioural items (fig. 2b) shows an important variation between observed couples, that is the number of behavioural items recorded per observed couple can range between 1 and 40 (mean = 8.32). model

(2009) found female mhc- based preference in chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha, w.), indicating a possible female aver- sion for males with similar mhc genotypes. simi- larly, that intermediately dissimilar mhc matings were more frequent than expected in brown_trout. to our knowl- edge, no relationship between mhc type and the phenotypic traits used here has been published, so it remains difficult link finding and the mhc dissimilarity between our to hypothesise for an actual forsberg showed (2007) et al. hypothesis. alternative explanations can be evoked such as sensory bias (ryan 1990), which could lead to a preference for dissimilar males. alternatively, females could be deceived by a trait that would be adaptive for local males and overexpressed, yet un- correlated to fitness (dishonest) in allopatric males. in both cases, the mechanism has to evolve in an antag- onistic way in each lineage before the secondary con- tact to produce the general heterogamous pattern observed. lastly, the preference for dissimilarity can be considered as a mechanism to prevent inbreeding in small populations, a frequent situation in mountain areas such as haute-savoie. the panel of possible evolutionary causes for this heterogamous female preference model in brown_trout offers several ave- nues and some of them could now be easily explored. our observations somehow echo recent data and predictions (r€as€anen et al. 2014; servedio & b€urger 2014) nuancing the strength and possible pathways for coevolution of female preference and male pheno- types. from an applied point of view, this has direct consequences on our expectations of intraspecific diversity dynamics long allopatric evolution will not necessarily prevent hydridisation in case of secondary contact. population managers have therefore a direct impact and control on intraspecific diversity, through the effects of their management practices on the genetic admixture between lineages. the precaution- ary approach must be to preclude any contact between lineages in mediterranean areas that have not yet been stocked with atlantic fish. for those areas where introgression has already occurred, one can assume that there will be potential fitness varia- tion among newly generated hybrid combinations and presume that natural selection will act on the new genetic admixture to achieve new, but different adap- tive peaks. for instance, introgression patterns show some local variations, the pure atl sometimes dis- appearing in some areas, and the pure med persist- ing in others (largiader & scholl 1996), which could be the result of environmentally controlled postzygot- ic selection. but in most areas, hybrids represent a large part of the population even many years after stocking have ceased (gil et al. submitted). the med versus atl conservation challenge is a typical case in salmonids: the introgression of a native population arising from contact between lin- eages or species facilitated by man (scribner et al. 2001; gozlan et al. 2010). as an example, young et al. (2001) underlined the lack of knowledge on the mechanisms generating reproductive isolation in the cut-throat versus rainbow trout conservation issue. rubidge & taylor (2004b) also pointed at the lack of study focusing on prezygotic isolation. mating systems have been tentatively inferred from preference for phenotypic dissimilarity a posteriori molecular analyses (rubidge & taylor 2004a; metcalf et al. 2008), but generally, no direct evidence is available to validate the assumptions used. interestingly, weigel et al. (2002) identified throat slash pattern or spot shape as being discrimi- nant phenotypic traits during reproduction between westslope cut-throat trout and rainbow trout; suba- quatic video recording could therefore be success- fully applied in this case to evaluate the relative influence of prezygotic barriers on total reproduc- tive isolation by performing observations of mating systems under various environmental set-ups and conditions. this should help understanding why ecological factors may sometimes constrain gene flow between gene pools (weigel et al. 2003) while they do not seem to matter in other occasions (hitt et al. 2003). in a more general context, the method used in this study could be transposable to other conservation issues in salmonids, where the phenotypic recognition for fish of different origin is possible. in natura observations contribute actively to the detection of mechanisms controlling for reproductive isolation between gene pools of major interest for biodiversity conservation. acknowledgements jordi gil’s phd grant has been funded by the ‘assemblee des pays de savoie’ and inra. field equipment was funded by the ‘federation de haute savoie pour la p^eche & protection des milieux aquatiques’ and the european interreg atlan- tic aquatic resource conservation program. references aparicio, e., garcıa-berthou, e., araguas, r.m., martınez, p. & garcia marin, j.l. 2005. body pigmentation pattern to assess introgression by hatchery stocks in native salmo tru- tta from mediterranean streams. journal of fish biology 67: 931–949. barbat-leterrier, a., guyomard, r. & krieg, f. 1989. intro- gression between domesticated strains and mediterranean native populations of brown_trout (salmo_trutta, l.). aquatic living resources 2: 215–223. bernatchez, l. 2001. the evolutionary history of brown_trout salmo_trutta l. inferred from phylogeographic, nested clade, and mismatch analyses of mitochondrial dna variation. evolution 55: 351–379. blumstein, d.t. & daniel, j.c. 2007. quantifying behavior the jwatcher way. sunderland: sinauer associates. caudron, a., champigneulle, a., vigie, l., hamelet, v. & guyomard, r. 2012. early effects of the strategies of creat- ing a genetic refuge and direct translocation for conserving and restoring populations of native brown_trout. freshwater biology 57: 1702–1715. crandall, c.a., bininda-edmonds, o.r.p., mace, g.m. & wayne, r.k. 2000. considering evolutionary processes in 357 gil et al. conservation biology. trends in ecology and evolution 15: 290–295. fisher, r.a. 1930. the genetical theory of natural selection. oxford: clarendon press, pp. 135–162. forsberg, l.a., dannewitz, j., petersson, e. & grahn, m. 2007. influence of genetic dissimilarity in the reproductive success and mate choice of brown_trout females fishing for optimal mhc dissimilarity. journal of evolutionary biology 20: 1859–1869. fraser, d.j., weir, l.k., bernatchez, l., hansen, m.m. & taylor, e.b. 2011. extent and scale of local adaptation in salmonid fishes: review and meta-analysis. heredity 106: 404–420. garner, s.r., bortoluzzi, r.n., heath, d.d. & neff, d.d. 2009. sexual conflict inhibits female mate choice for major histocompatibility complex dissimilarity in chinook salmon. proceedings of the royal society b, biological sciences 277: 885–894. gelman, a. & rubin, d. 1992. inference from iterative simu- lation using multiple sequences. statistical sciences 7: 457– 511. gil, j., labonne, j. & caudron, a. submitted. evaluation of strategies to conserve and restore intraspecific biodiversity of brown_trout: outcomes from genetic monitoring in the french alps. review in fish biology and fisheries (unpublished data, gil j., caudron a., labonne j.). gozlan, r.e., britton, j.r., cowx, i. & copp, g.h. 2010. cur- rent knowledge on non-native freshwater fish introductions. journal of fish biology 76: 751–786. hansen, m.m., fraser, d.j., meier, k. & menseberg, k.l. 2009. sixty years of anthropogenic pressure: a spatio-tempo- ral genetic analysis of brown_trout populations subject to stocking and population declines. molecular ecology 18: 2549–2562. hitt, n.p., frissell, c.a., muhfeld, c.c. & allendorf, f.w. 2003. spread of hybridization between native westslope cut- throat and nonnative rainbow trout. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 60: 1440–1451. labonne, l., augery, m., parade, m., brinkert, s., prevost, e., heland, m. & beall, e. 2009. female preference for male body size in brown_trout, salmo_trutta: is big still fash- ionable?
