(2008) and taverny et al. (2012). the results of the studies have been variable. for instance, the greatest larval abundance was asso- ciated with different grain sizes. large scale variables such as geomorphology and hydrology of given watershed may affect field studies (torgersen & close 2004) and may offer an explanation for this variation. river regulation measures such as dredging, impoundment, embankment and hydropeaking have decreased the quality and quantity of larval habitats, and consequently, lamprey populations have declined (ojutkangas et al. 1995; renaud 1997; maitland 2003). river, brook and sea lampreys (petromyzon marinus) are listed under annex ii of european com- mission habitats directive (92/43/eec), and member states are obligated to create special areas of conser- vation for them. efforts to restore lamprey popula- tions have also increased in the united states of america (close et al. 2009). in finland, there have been efforts to rehabilitate lamprey populations by restoring rivers, lampreys over migration barriers, mitigating the water level regula- tion and outplanting subyearling larvae. however, the results have been variable (ojutkangas et al. 1995). the life cycle of lamprey is not well understood, and more information on the ecology of lamprey is needed to improve measures aiming to rehabilitate lamprey populations. one of important issues is to understand habitat requirements of lam- prey in the different stages of the life cycle. transferring adult the most habitat preferences of lamprey change when they grow (beamish & jebbink 1994; almeida & quintella 2002; sugiyama & goto 2002; smith et al. 2011). however, almost all the habitat studies larval substrate selection by subyearling lampreys have dealt with larvae older than one year, and to our knowledge, quantitative studies on habitats of subyearling lampreys have not been conducted. recently, due to the outplanting of subyearling lar- vae and restoration efforts of rivers, the need for information on habitats suitable for subyearling lar- vae has increased. therefore, the main focus of our aquarium experiments was to study substrate selec- tion by subyearling larvae of l. fluviatilis during the first three months after hatching. in addition, we studied differences in substrate selection by differ- ent-sized larvae (l. fluviatilis and l. planeri) older than one year and substrate depth selection by large larvae. material and methods substrate selection by subyearling lamprey substrates used substrate selection by subyearling lamprey was stud- ied using four gravel and four soft sediments. the coarsest gravel was created by sieving natural gravel collected from a gravel pit. other gravel sediments were collected from the rivers perhonjoki or siiponjoki and used as unmodified or were modified by remov- ing fine material (<1 mm and <2 mm). all the soft sediments were collected from rivers and used unmodified. sediments were frozen in 0.5 l plastic containers. freezing made it possible to use the same sediment in the various tests and eliminated the invertebrate predators. prior to freezing, a sample of approxi- mately 0.5 l was taken for grain size and composition analysis from each sediment type. for grain size analysis, the samples were sifted through nested sieves with mesh sizes of 11, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.075 mm. first, dry empty sieves were weighed. the nested sieves were set on a plastic container, and the sediment sample was placed on the topmost sieve (11 mm). sifting was carried out as a wet sieving with a hand-held shower by rins- ing every sieve with water for about 10 s and leaving to drain for 5 min. subsequently, the sides of the sieves were dried with a hand towel, the sieves were weighed and the wet mass for every grain size class was calculated. a sample was taken from each grain size and dry weight (dw) and proportion of organic matter deter- mined according to finnish laboratory standards (sfs-en 12880, sfs-en 12879; table 1). weight of the water gathered in the plastic container below the nested sieve was measured. a random sample of two litres was taken from the container and dry weight and proportion of organic matter of grain size less than 0.075 mm was determined. 645 aronsuu & virkkala m m 9 0 1 > . m m 9 0 1 – 0 . . 8 m m 9 7 – 0 . . 6 m m 9 5 – 0 4 . . m m 9 . 3 – 0 . 2 m m 9 . 1

1 l e b a t 646 soft after laboratory measurements, sediments were classified and named according to udden– wentworth grain size classification (wentworth 1922) and the amount of organic matter. soft sedi- ment types were very fine sand (vfs; median grain size of 0.075–0.125 mm, organic matter 4.8% of dw), organic very fine sand (ofvs; median grain size of 0.075–0.125 mm, organic matter 7.5% of dw), fine sand (fs; median grain size of 0.125– 0.250 mm, organic matter 1.5% of dw) and coarse sand (cs; median grain size of 0.5–1.0 mm, organic matter 0.13% of dw). the gravels were named according to the lowest and highest grain size as follows: gravel 0–11 mm, gravel 1–11 mm, gravel 2–11 mm and gravel 4–15 mm. the proportion of organic matter in the gravel sediments varied between 1.0 and 1.2%. the acquisition and maintenance of larval lampreys adult river lampreys were collected from the river perhonjoki in the autumn and kept over winter in the holding tanks in the lamprey hatchery of the environ- mental center of west finland. as lampreys were ready to spawn, eggs were fertilised and incubated in the hatchery. after hatching, larvae were transferred to the laboratory and placed in three aerated holding tanks with volumes of 40, 60 and 60 l and bottom surface areas of 0.3, 0.45 and 0.45 m2, respectively. bottoms of the holding tanks were covered with about 4 cm layer of soft river sediment. for addi- tional nutrition, 1–2 g of baker yeast was added into each holding tank twice a week. water used in the holding tanks was derived from the river perhonjoki and changed twice a week. the temperature was kept at 15 °c for 30 days and after that at 18 °c. a con- stant photoperiod of 8:18 l/d was maintained throughout the study. the growth of lampreys was monitored by measuring the total length (tl) of 40 randomly selected individuals in the beginning of each experiment week. the mean tl of individuals during the first experiment week was 6.9 mm and on the last (10th) experiment week 11.5 mm (table 2). the exact time when lampreys achieve the larval stage was not studied. therefore, lampreys both pro- larval and larval stages are called larva throughout the study. experiment set-up six round plastic basins with inner diameter of 46 cm and height of 36 cm were used as test aquari- ums. the bottom of each aquarium was divided with 8 cm high partition walls into four equal sized sec- tors. four aeration tubes were installed in the inner wall of each aquarium about 3 cm above each parti- tion wall to circulate water 3 cms  1 in the clockwise direction.

second series (b), four gravel types with different grain size (0–11, 1–11, 2–11 and 4–15 mm) were studied. in the third series (c), the selection of gravel sediment (0–11 mm) and soft sediment (fs or ovfs) was compared. in each experiment, there were two parallel aquariums. the sediment order in the sectors was constant in all experiments as the preliminary substrate selection experiments conducted with subyearling larvae earlier showed that the order of the sediments did not affect the substrate selection (aronsuu, unpublished data). the order of sediments in series a was vfs, fs, ovfs and cs, and in series b, 4–15, 0–11, 2–11 and 1–11 mm. in series c, every other sector was filled with the soft sediment and every other with gravel. the experiments were carried out for 10 weeks. the first experiments were started 8 days (experiment week 1) and the last ones 71 days (experiment week 10) after hatching. experiment series c was con- ducted at weeks 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10. experiment series b was conducted at weeks 1, 3 and 5 and series c at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 (table 2). frozen sediments were melted and placed in the sectors immediately before starting the experiments. when the average tl of the larvae was less than 10 mm, the thickness of the sediment was 30 mm, and when the average tl of the individuals was over 10 mm, the thickness of the sediment was 50 mm. the surface of sediment was adjusted approximately 5 mm below the top of the partition wall by setting styrofoam pieces under the sediment layer. after sediments were placed in the sectors, the aquariums were filled with water from the river perhonjoki. water was allowed to clarify for about an hour prior to beginning aeration. lids with a 2 cm substrate selection by subyearling lampreys hole in the middle were placed on the top of aquari- ums, and using a funnel, larvae were released through the hole to the aquariums. the lids were removed after 30 min when the lights went off. in the week 1 experiments, one hundred larvae were released into every aquarium. later, the number of larvae was pro- portioned to the mean tl of larvae and calculated using the formula 6.9/x 9 100 where 6.9 is the aver- age tl of lampreys in millimetres at the week 1 and x is the average tl of individuals in millimetres at the week the experiment was conducted. overall, the number of larvae tested ranged from 60 to 100. the lampreys were allowed to select the substrate for 40 h. subsequently, water was removed by a siphon hose, so that the water level was just below the top of the partition wall. at this moment, only larvae were few larvae were observed. almost all buried in the sediment. gravel sediments were removed from the sectors, and individuals were sepa- rated from gravel by a sieve. soft sediments were left in the sectors, and the surface layer was gently dis- rupted with a pipette, so that the lampreys started to move and they were picked up with a pipette after a visual observation. finally, the upper layer of soft sediments was transferred onto a plastic tray and remaining individuals were picked up. in all the experiments, the number of individuals found in each sector was counted. on average, 92.6% of the larvae released into the aquariums were found at the end of the experiments. the fewest (83.2%) larvae were found in experiment series a at week 5. in other experiments, the percentage of larvae found, ranged between 89.1 (experiment series c, week 5) and 98.5 (experiment series c, week 1). substrate selection by larvae older than one year substrate selection by larvae of three size groups substrate selection by larvae of three different size groups was studied using three kinds of river sedi- ments typical for rivers on the west coast of finland. all the sediments were collected directly from the river and were not modified in any way. two sam- ples were taken from every sediment type. grain size and composition were analysed in the same way as described above for the subyearling larvae, and an average of the two samples was used for percentage calculations (table 3). sediments were separated by grain size, proportion of organic matter and depth. the sediments used were a 15 cm layer of fine sand (fs), 4 cm layer of fine sand on the top of 11 cm layer of clay (fs/clay), coarse particle organic mat- ter (cpom) and clay (clay). larvae used in the experiments were collected one to two days before starting the experiments by sampling from river bed substrates in the rivers 647 aronsuu & virkkala m m 9 7 > . ) 7 5 ( 9 2 . ) 7

siiponjoki and perhonjoki, where l. fluviatilis popu- lations are known to exist. it is not possible to rule out that some closely related l. planeri larvae were also collected. therefore, lampetra spp is used for large larvae instead of l. fluviatilis. in the laboratory, the larvae were sorted according to their tl into three size groups: 23–55, 70–98 and 110–146 mm and kept in the aerated holding tanks. three plastic square tanks with rounded corners were used as test aquariums. the total area of the aquariums was 3.8 m2 and the total height 52 cm. the bottom of each aquarium was divided with a 16 cm high partition wall into four equal sized sec- tors. water tubes, which directed water to circulate at 2 cms  1 in a clockwise direction, were installed in the inner wall of the aquariums about 1 cm above each partition wall. water was recycled via a water outlet in the middle of the aquarium, pumped to a main container and then sent through four tubes back to the aquarium. a 25 w lamp was installed about one metre above each aquarium. the experiments were conducted under a 12:12 l/d photoperiod at ambient room temperature (18–21 °c). a day before starting the experiment, the sediments were placed into the sectors, 25 cm layer of water from river perhonjoki was added into the aquariums and water circulation was switched on. larvae were released on the top cover of the outlet container in the middle of the aquarium. in the sepa- rate aquariums, 50, 30 and 20 individuals of the size classes 23–55, 70–98 and 110–146 mm, respectively, were released. larvae were allowed to select burrow- ing substrate for 64 h. subsequently, water was removed and larvae buried in different substrates were collected and counted. the experiment was con- ducted twice. during the experiments, five individu- als from size class 23–55 mm, one individual from size class 70–98 mm and two individuals from size class 110–146 mm disappeared. substrate depth selection in the second experiment conducted with larvae older than one year, the substrate depth selection of large larvae (tl of 80–110 mm with an average of 92 mm) was studied. four sediment depths (1, 3, 6 and 10 cm) of very fine sand (table 3) were compared. the total depth of the sediment in each sector was adjusted to 15 cm using a layer of hard clay sediment underneath the vfs. the experiment was carried out in three aquariums each having a different order of sediments. twenty-five larvae were released into each aquarium. the larvae had been used earlier in another experi- ment, and they had been collected from the river 5 to 7 days before starting the experiment. otherwise, the experiment was conducted in the same way as described above for the different size groups. data analysis the chi-square test of homogeneity (v2-test) was used to determine whether there were differences between replicates. in experiment series a and c, substrate selection differed significantly between some repli- cates. however, for further data analysis, the results of parallel aquariums in each experiment were pooled to focus on overall substrate selection by larvae not on differences between replicates. the chi-square test of homogeneity was used to determine whether there were differences in substrate selection between experiment weeks within experi- ment series (a–c). the same test was used to study the difference between size classes in the substrate selection study of older larvae and the difference between sector orders in substrate depth experiment. in every experiment, the chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to study whether the selection of sub- strates differed significantly from the availability of substrates. furthermore, in all experiments, except experiment series c for subyearling larvae, selection ratios (w; proportion used: proportion available) were calculated for all substrates and pairwise comparisons between selection ratios were conducted (manly et al. 2002). in pairwise comparisons, first confidence inter- vals for the difference of selection ratios (wi–wj) were calculated using bonferroni adjustment by replacing z0.05/2 with z0.05/(2i’) where i’ = i(i-1)/2, and i is a number of categories. selection ratios were declared significantly different if the confidence interval for wi–wj did not contain zero (manly et al. 2002). chi-square tests were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows, version 20.0, and pair wise comparisons of selection rations were calculated by entering needed equations (manly et al. 2002) into microsoft office excel 2007 (microsoft, redmond, wa, usa). results substrate selection by subyearling larvae in experiment series a, the selection of soft substrates by subyearling lamprey differed between experiments conducted at weeks 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 (chi-square test, df = 12, p < 0.001). substrates were not selected in proportion to availability in any of the experiments, (chi-square tests, df = 3, p < 0.001).

the selection was closer to availability (fig. 3). in weeks 2–9 in which fs was used as soft sediment, substrate selec- tion did not differ significantly from availability at weeks 2 and 9 (chi-square tests, week 2: df = 1, p = 0.38; week 9: df = 1, p = 0.25). in contrast at weeks 3, 5 and 7, the selection was not in proportion to availability (chi-square tests, week 3: df = 1, p = 0.002; week 5: df = 1, p < 0.001; week 7: df = 1, p < 0.001). only at week 3 did the larger number of larvae select fs than gravel sediment. in the experiments where ovfs was used as a soft sedi- ment, to ovfs at

differed significantly from availability (chi- square test, df = 3, p < 0.001). larvae preferred the deepest sediment (10 cm) to other sediment depths (fig. 5). discussion substrate selection by subyearling lampreys substrate selection by larvae during the first experi- ment week differed clearly from that of later weeks. in experiment series b, larvae initially showed no preference, but eventually preferred gravel substrate that included fine grains. in experiment series c at week 1, larvae clearly preferred gravel substrate to larval soft sediment furthermore, we observed that in experiment series a at week 1, in the most selected soft sediment ovfs larvae were mainly under large detritus pieces. taken together, it seems that approxi- mately 8–10 days after hatching, larvae were not able to construct a burrow, but actively selected a sub- strate which offered existing holes to hide in or shades to hide under. according to piavis (1971), before they develop the ability to construct a burrow- ing, lampreys swim after which they settle down to lie on the sediment. lampreys may continue this habit until they find suitable substrate. the habit to actively search for existing holes may have evolved to increase survival of those individuals which passively leave the nest before the burrowing ability has developed (see hardisty 1979; kirillova et al. 2011). sea lampreys are able to burrow into the sediment 125 day degrees after hatching (piavis 1971). for l. fluviatilis, it seems to take longer, somewhere between 150 and 225 day degrees. the change in substrate selection by larvae after week 1 was likely due to the development of the abil- ity to construct a burrow. in experiment series b, lar- vae favoured the gravel type with the finest material which made it possible to construct a burrow, and in experiment series c, larvae started to select fine sedi- ments showing that larvae were now able construct a burrow and they were not dependent on existing holes. it for pacific lamprey (entosphenus tridentatus), sea lamprey and lethenteron reissneri, takes 20–23 days and 300 to over 400 day degrees after hatching to achieve the larval stage where formation of digestive tract is completed (piavis 1971; tahara 1988; yamasaki et al. 2003). if the development tim- ing is the same for l. fluviatilis, individuals in the current experiments achieved the larval stage at the 3rd or 4th experiment week. during the experiment weeks 2–10, there were no major changes in the sub- strate selection, and therefore, it seems that the ability to use external food may not have had a significant influence on substrate selection. the size of the lar- vae may be one of the most important factors affect- ing the changes in the selection of substrate after burrowing ability has achieved. the mean length of larvae from the experiment week 2 to the experiment week 10 increased only by 3 mm; is understandable that substrate preference did not change much during that time period. therefore, it trend. furthermore, substrate selection differed significantly between some experiments at weeks 2–10, although there was no clear in five experiments (experiment series a: weeks 3 and 5; experiment ser- ies c: weeks 3, 5 and 7 with fs as a soft sediment), there were significant differences between replicates. it is probable that the small differences on the surface substrate selection by subyearling lampreys layers of substrates in different experiments and repli- cates explain at least a part of the variation in the results. on several occasions, we found that larvae had aggregated in shallow hollows of the top layer of the soft sediment especially in fs. however, this var- iation did not significantly hamper the interpretation of the results. after larvae have achieved the ability to burrow, the substrate has to provide the characteristics that allow burrowing into sediment and construction of a tube. secondly, the substrate has to allow vital water flow for gas exchanges and also for feeding when use of external food begins. it has been suggested that lamprey larvae distribution is mostly a function of sediment grain size (see young et al. 1990; alme- ida & quintella 2002). in many studies, fine (0.125– 0.25 mm) or medium fine sand (0.25–0.5 mm) has been the most preferred substrate for larvae older than one year (potter et al. 1986; lee 1989; beamish & lowartz 1996; yamasaki 2007; smith et al. 2011), and it has been suggested that its properties meet the needs of larvae (beamish & lowartz 1996). in some studies, the highest densities of larval river and/or brook lampreys have been associated with even coar- ser sediment (malmqvist 1980; goodwin et al. 2008; taverny et al. 2012). in experiment series a, larvae able to burrow (weeks 3–10) selected vfs 196 and ovfs 201 times, but fs only 103 times. the coars- est sediment cs was selected 29 times. subyearling larvae preferred finer soft sediment than larger larvae in earlier studies and clearly selected against coarse sand which was associated with the highest lampetra spp abundance by goodwin et al. (2008) and taverny et al. (2012). our results agree with those of beamish and jebbink (1994), who found that the abundance of small larvae of southern brook lamprey (ichthyomyzon gagei; 45 mm) increased more than large larvae (75 mm), when the proportion of fine fraction (<0.125 mm) increased. also sugiyama and goto (2002) and almeida and quintella (2002) reported that smaller larvae selected finer sediment than bigger larvae. however, in all these studies, lar- vae were older than one year, and to our knowledge, there are no earlier quantitative studies on habitat requirements of subyearling lampreys. the selection of ovfs and vfs by subyearling larvae may be linked to their weak burrowing capacity (see quintel- la et al. 2007) or/and small diameter of tube, which may lead to a need for small particles to construct a stable burrow. gravel and coarse sand has been found to be a rejected substrate for lamprey larvae (lee 1989; smith et al. 2011), especially for the smaller ones (20–60 mm and <50 mm; almeida & quintella 2002; sugiyama & goto 2002). this may be due to the fact that large particles are too heavy to dislodge 651 aronsuu & virkkala for larvae (beamish & jebbink 1994; beamish & lo- wartz 1996). quintella et al. (2007) showed that small sea lamprey larvae had more difficulties bur- rowing into coarse sediments than larger ones. we suggest that difficulties in burrowing were one of the reasons why coarse sand was rejected by subyearling larvae. most of the particles in gravel substrates may have been too heavy for subyearling larvae to dis- lodge and larvae probably had to use interstitial space between big particles. subyearling larvae selected against sieved gravels after experiment week 1 even though these substrates offered existing holes. the main reason for that was probably a very low portion of fine material (<1, <2 and <4 mm), which made it difficult or impossible to construct a stable burrow (see beamish & jebbink 1994; beamish & lowartz 1996). natural gravel (0–11 mm) was clearly preferred to sieved gravels by subyearling larvae after experiment week 1 in experiment series b. it was likely that nat- ural gravel that included fine material offered a better opportunity to construct a burrow. furthermore, in experiment series c, natural gravel seemed to be at least as desired substrate for larvae as soft sediments, suggesting that in the natural conditions gravel beds may, beside soft sediments, offer an important habitat for subyearling lampreys. however, in rivers and streams, gravel beds are usually subjected to a higher current speed than gravel substrates in our experi- ments, and therefore, using only aquarium tests, it is not possible to predict the suitability of gravel sub- strate in natural environment. still, some field obser- vations support the importance of gravel beds for subyearling larvae. tuikkala (1971) reported densities over 1000 subyearling lampetra spp larvae per m2 in the gravel bed in late july about 6 weeks after hatch- ing. this observation suggests that larvae may stay in the nest after the free embryonic phase, if conditions in the nests are favourable. while larvae grow, the space between gravel grains may become a limiting factor, and it is probable that larvae have to move to soft sediment areas during the first summer. sieved gravel has been used as a test substrate to reflect the suitability of gravels as burrowing habitat (e.g., kelso 1993; smith et al. 2011). according to the results of current study, even a small proportion of fine material in gravel may affect the substrate selection of small larvae and natural gravels usually contain fine material. therefore, under experimental conditions, it may be necessary to add fine material to substrates to get results more applicable to the nat- ural environment. although the proportion of organic matter in sedi- ment as regarded as important factor predicting abun- dance of larvae (potter et al. 1986; beamish & jebbink 1994; beamish & lowartz 1996), there are 652 also contrasting results (malmqvist 1980; sugiyama & goto 2002). in the current study, the substrate ovfs had the highest proportion of organic matter, but larvae did not prefer ovfs to vfs or to gravel 0–11 mm, suggesting that proportion of organic mat- ter may not be very important factor for substrate selection of subyearling lampreys. however, the experiment time may not have been long enough to allow nutritional factors to affect substrate selection. consequently, further studies are needed to define the importance of organic matter in sediment for su- byearling lampreys. substrate selection by larvae older than one year for larvae older than one year, only a few sediment types were compared. consequently, the results did not give a full picture on substrate selection by older larvae of lampetra spp. however, some new findings were made and results of earlier studies confirmed. many studies have shown that habitat selection by larval lampreys change while they grow (beamish & jebbink 1994; almeida & quintella 2002; sugiyama & goto 2002; smith et al. 2011). the results of the present study also showed differences in substrate selection between size groups of larvae older than one year. the two largest size groups preferred coarse organic sediments to fine sand, whilst the smallest larvae did not have that preference. medium or fine sand is regarded as the most suit- able habitat for larvae older than one year (potter et al. 1986; lee 1989; beamish & lowartz 1996; yamasaki 2007; smith et al. 2011). in contrast to our study, most earlier studies have not found coarse organic matter preferable to fine sand as a burrowing substrate (e.g., smith et al. 2011). however, in the aquarium experiments conducted by smith et al. (2011), coarse organic sediment was the second most selected substrate after fine sand both for small and large larvae of the least brook lamprey (lampetra ae- pyptera). the importance of organic material as a part of the substrate has been widely emphasised (enequist 1937; applegate 1950; sterba 1962; potter et al. 1986; beamish & lowartz 1996). the benefit of organic sediment is connected to food availability (hardisty & potter 1971; shirakawa et al. 2009), although it has also been suggested that dietary sig- nificance of organic matter is limited (malmqvist 1980; beamish & lowartz 1996; sugiyama & goto 2002). according to lee (1989) permeability of sedi- ment is an important determinant of larval lamprey habitat selection, and organic matter may be impor- tant to the interstitial movement of water through the sediment as suggested by beamish and lowartz (1996). while coarse organic sediment is very porous and water flow through the sediment is high, the gas exchange and food intake is probably easier in coarse organic sediment than in fine or medium-size sand. the larvae are mainly breathing through gills, but a portion of the gas exchange takes place through skin (randall 1972). when growing the skin area of larval lamprey is decreasing compared with the body mass, which may be one of the reasons why bigger larvae select porous sediments. based on the current aquarium experiments, it is not, however, appropriate to suggest that coarse organic matter is always the best burrowing substrate for large larvae. the composition of coarse organic matter is not as homogenous as inorganic substrates, and it has been found that the source of particle organic matter may have an effect on its suitability for lamprey larvae (beamish & jebbink 1994). in addition, the proportion of fine particles mixed with coarse organic particles may play an important role (smith et al. 2011) and small larvae may need a higher proportion of fine particles to construct a sta- ble burrow than large larvae (see beamish & jebbink 1994). furthermore, in natural conditions, decompos- ing coarse organic material may lead to the depletion of oxygen in the sediment especially when the water flow through the sediment is low causing sediment to be unsuitable for larvae. in field studies carried out in late summer, we have recognised that larvae are usu- ally missing if coarse organic matter smells rotten reflecting oxygen depletion. in conclusion, coarse organic matter with the right composition may offer an excellent habitat especially for large larvae, but may be unsuitable for any size larvae after long per- iod of low flows. our result indicating that clay is rejected as a bur- rowing substrate by larval lampreys is consistent with other aquarium experiments performed with different lamprey species (lee 1989; smith et al. 2011). clay as a burrowing substrate is challenging for larval lam- prey in many ways. first, clay is usually compacted and prevents or slows down the movement of larvae into the sediment (young et al. 1990; smith et al. 2012). second, the weak permeability of sediment consisting of very fine particles slows down the water flow through the sediment (lee 1989). third, very fine particles may clog the gill lamellae and dermal pores and hinder the gas exchange of larvae (beam- ish & lowartz 1996). river regulation measures and hydropeaking have changed the soft sediment areas into areas where clay is prevailing (ojutkangas et al. 1995); hence, larval habitats may have changed for the worse. sediment depth is an important factor for predict- ing larval abundance (potter et al. 1986; kelso & todd 1993; goodwin et al. 2008). the burrow- ing depth is known to increase while larva grows (hardisty & potter 1971) and large-sized lampreys substrate selection by subyearling lampreys need deeper substrate than smaller ones (sugiyama & goto 2002). in our study, large larvae preferred the deepest sediment available. this is consistent with results of sugiyama and goto (2002) large lethenteron reissneri larvae and with those of kelso (1993) for geotria australis larvae. our experiments and those carried out previously cannot rule out that larvae would have selected even deeper sediment if it had been available. more detailed information is needed on substrate depth selection of different-sized larvae to better understand habit requirements of larval lampreys. for rehabilitation aspect in finland, subyearling river lampreys have been artificially propagated for decades for outplantings aimed at the rehabilitation of depleted populations. lampreys have been artificially propagated also in japan and in the united states of america. current propagation methods to produce significant numbers of lamprey up to the prolarval stage, but the risk of high mortality increases after individuals have reached a mean size of 7 mm. methods for rearing lampreys beyond the larval stage have not been developed, and larvae have to be outplanted before they begin to use external food sources. adequate are it is probable that site suitability plays an important role in the survival of outplanted individuals and in the success of outplantings. according to the results of the current study, river lamprey <7 mm should be outplanted in areas where substrate provides existing holes for prolarvae. gravel areas with low or moder- ate current speed may offer the best sites. individuals averaging 7–8 mm should likely also outplanted in the similar areas as smaller ones, because it is proba- ble that at least some portion of prolarvae are still unable to construct a burrow. when the mean tl of lampreys exceeds 8 mm, it is likely that most indi- viduals are able to construct a burrow; hence, the out- plantings could be carried out also in soft sediments. according to the results of the present study, sub- strate with high proportion of the fine fraction (<0.125 mm) is the best type of soft sediment. water regulation measures including dredging, channelisation, embankment and water flow regula- tion have impaired larval habitats and anthropogenic activities degrading larval habitats may lead to decreasing populations et al. 1995; renaud 1997; close et al. 2002; maitland 2003). when restoring previously regulated rivers, habitat requirements of different size larvae should be taken into account: straightened shore lines and embank- ments should be modified so that accumulation of fine sediments and organic matter is possible, and (ojutkangas 653 aronsuu & virkkala especially in the channelised rivers, the pool-riffle structure should be restored. furthermore, dredging of fast-flowing sections of the rivers has reduced sig- nificantly the amount of gravel beds (yrj€an€a 1998). these habitats are important sites for spawning, incu- bation off eggs and, according to this study, also as habitat of prolarvae and maybe that of subyearling larvae. therefore, when restoring regulated rivers, gravel beds should also be restored. acknowledgements we would like to thank all staff of environmental center of west finland who has participated in conducting the experi- ments
