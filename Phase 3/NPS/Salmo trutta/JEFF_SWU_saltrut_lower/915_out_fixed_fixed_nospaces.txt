elsdon et al., 2008). certain elements from water are constantly layered onto the otolith. incorporation of elements (e.g. ba, sr, mg, zn, mn) into oto- liths normally increases along with increased elemental concentra- tion in the ambient water (bath et al., 2000; campana, 1999; clarke, telmer, & shrimpton, 2007; elsdon & gillanders, 2005; engstedt, koch- schmidt, & larsson, 2012; zimmerman, 2005). ba and sr are known salinity indicators, where otolith ba concentration decreases and otolith sr concentration increases with increasing water salinity (campana, 1999; gillanders, 2005; tabouret et al. 2010). despite the small salinity differences (≤7‰) in the gulf of bothnia, white- fish otolith ba concentration significantly decreases with increasing water salinity, while the increase of otolith sr with salinity is small (hägerstrand et al., 2015). besides ba and sr, otolith mg, zn and mn may aid to distinguish between populations of fish that have stayed in differently composed waters, and be of use in identifying migrat- ing fish (chang, geffen, kosler, dundas, & maes, 2012; clarke et al., 2007; engstedt, engkvist, & larsson, 2014; hägerstrand et al., 2015; heidemann et al., 2012; thorrold, jones, campana, mclaren, & lam, 1998). the differentiation may be accomplished by whole (bulk) otolith analysis, as previously shown (campana, 1999; elsdon et al., 2008; hägerstrand et al., 2015). notably, to distinguish between spa- tially separated fish populations by whole otolith chemistry analysis, knowledge on the elemental composition of water in the study area is not a prerequisite, as pointed out by several authors (campana, 1999; marohn, 2011). in the present study, concentrations of elements (ba, sr, mg, zn, mn, ca) in whole whitefish otoliths were studied by inductively cou- pled plasma- optical emission spectrometry. we hypothesised that dif- ferences in growth rate of whitefish from river kemijoki are due to differences in foraging habitat regions including southward migration distance and that this is expressed as dissimilarities in otolith elemen- tal concentration characteristics particularly concerning concentra- tions of ba, a salinity indicator. the knowledge collected may have relevance for understanding the population structure and dynamics, including habitat use, of river- spawning whitefish and thereby aid in sustainable management of the whitefish populations. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study area gulf of bothnia in the baltic sea reaches ~725 km in north–south direction (fig. 1). the salinity of its brackish water forms a weak gradient as it receives freshwater from several large rivers in the north and saltier post- atlantic water from the baltic proper in the south. the salinity of the surface water increases from ~2‰ in the north to ~7‰ in the south. in rivers and estuaries, the salinity 458 |   is lower. besides salinity, average insolation increases when going from north to south. 2.2 | sampling sites whitefish were sampled from river kemijoki below the lowest hydropower station isohaara, which is about 5 km from the sea (fig. 1). the station was constructed in 1946 ceasing the migration of anadromous fish species in the river. kemijoki is the longest river in finland, 550 km, and its mean discharge is 556 m3 s−1. before damming, it was the most important spawning river for whitefish in finland. compensatory stocking of whitefish, 3.1 mil- lion one- summer- old fingerlings annually, was ordered by the finnish supreme administrative court 1980. 2.3 | fish sampling and analysis whitefish were caught with standing gill nets during their spawning run in october in 2012 and 2013 by local fishermen. fishing was made in the lower reach of the river below the isohaara dam in order to catch brood fish to satisfy the needs of compensatory stocking. fish total length (mm), weight (g) and sex were recorded. gill rakers were counted to verify the homogeneity of the river- spawning whitefish stock (jokikokko & huhmarniemi, 1998). the spawning mature whitefish population in the river consists of fish with different growth rates. the ageing of whitefish was based on the otoliths. after ageing, 18 fishes were selected for otolith elemental studies. nine of the sampled fishes were young (4 years) and fast growing (fastg), and nine other fishes were old (8 years) and slowly growing (slowlyg). the aim was to choose the largest fishes of the young group and the smallest possible of the old group to assure a clear growth rate difference between these two groups. by this procedure, the largest possible difference (if any) in otolith elemental composition related to fish growth rate could be obtained. in order to gather comparative data on otolith elemental concentrations of whitefish from different parts of the baltic sea, we analysed otoliths from whitefish sampled at kalix in october 2005 (sea, n = 10), at hailuoto in october 2013 (sea, n = 10) and at simpevarp in october 2006 (sea, n = 10) (fig. 1). the fish was caught with standing gill nets. 2.4 | otolith preparation and analysis sagittal otoliths were removed, cleaned with paper, air- dried, weighted and stored in eppendorf tubes until analysis. whole otoliths were analysed for elemental concentrations with varian vista- mpx inductively coupled plasma- optical (atomic) emission spectrometer. the otolith samples were dissolved in 2 ml hno3 in the microwave accelerating system mars 5 (cem): 1200 w, 50% power, 15 min, 60 psi pressure, max temperature 210°c, 10 min hold time. after mineralisation, 8 ml milli- q water was added. calibration standard solutions were prepared from single- element fluka- branded certified reference materials for icp (ca, hägerstrand et al. no. 94458; sr, no. 75267; ba, no. 59943; zn, no. 18562; mg, no. 80759; mn, no. 74128; fe, no. 43149; ni, no. 28944). calculations of elemental concentrations (% and μg g−1) in otoliths were based on analysis of these standards. analysis of the otolith reference material febs- 1 (nrcc, canada) gave the following average values (n = 4): ca, 44.05% (38.3 ± 1.4%); ba, 3.9 μg g−1 (5.09 ± 0.23 μg g−1); sr, 2075 μg g−1 (2055 ± 79 μg g−1); mg, 23.0 μg g−1 (23.6 ± 1.3 μg g−1); and mn, <1 μg g−1 (0.69 ± 0.02 μg g−1), where the certified values are within parentheses. the average value for zn was 8.2 μg g−1 (3.2–6.3 μg g−1). the information value is within parentheses. 2.5 | statistical analysis (tables 1–3). student’s t test fish and otolith data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (unpaired two- tailed, www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/t-test.html) was applied to compare otolith elemental concentrations from river kemijoki fastg and slowlyg whitefish, for each element separately (table 1). anova (www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/anova.html) was applied on elemental concentrations in otoliths of whitefish from sea locations kalix, hailuoto and simpevarp (table 2), and four groups of whitefish: river kemijoki fastg, river kemijoki slowg, åland islands sea (kobbaklintar, mariehamn and tengsöda) and northern gulf of bothnia sea (kalix and hailuoto) (table 3). post hoc test (www. graphpad.com/quickcalcs/posttest1/) was used to verify differ- ences in means within elemental groups. the principal component analysis (pca) which included otolith ba, mg, zn and ca concen- trations was based on the correlation data matrix (fig. 2). 2.6 | results the average length, weight, sex and age of the two whitefish groups fastg and slowlyg from river kemijoki are shown in table 1. the average weight and length of four- year- old fastg fish (795 g, 443 mm) were significantly higher (t test, t(16) = 3.35, p < .01 and t(16) = 3.49, p < .01, respectively) than that of eight- year- old slowlyg fish (642 g, 418 mm). nine otoliths from both whitefish groups were analysed for elemental concentrations and weight (table 1). ba, mg, zn and ca significantly differed between the groups. ba concentration was markedly (~45%, t test, t(16) = 3.37, p < .01), mg and zn markedly higher (~25%, t(16) = 6.02, p < .001 and ~20%, t(16) = 2.93, p < .01) and ca slightly lower (~5%, t(16) = 3.46, p < .01), in otoliths from fastg whitefish, com- pared with concentrations in otoliths from slowlyg fish (table 1). sex was not regarded in the analysis. in the principal component analysis (pca), the variance explained was 57.8% (pc1), 20.1% (pc2), 12.6% (pc3) and 9.4% (pc4). ba, mg and zn contributed most to pc1 while ca contributed most to pc2. we used pc1 and pc2 for the ordination of the samples (fig. 2). the fastg and the slowlyg samples are clearly separated on pc1. in a comparative purpose, elemental compositions of otoliths from whitefish sampled from three sites representing the northern (kalix sea and hailuoto lower hägerstrand et al.   | 459  1 − g g μ  , n m .  7 1 ± 2 5  . .  2 1 ± 7 5  . 1 − g g μ  , n z .  1 8 ± 3 3 5  . .  9 8 ± 6 1 4  . .  6 1 ± 7 6 1  . .  3 3 0 ± 3 3 0  . .  3 1 ± 6 2 1  . .  4 0 0 ± 4 3 0  . .  9 0 ± 8 1  . .  0 1 ± 4 3  . .  6 1 ± 5 0 4  . .  5 2 ± 0 4 3  . .  6 2 ± 3 8 2  . .  6 0 ± 6 2 4  . .  7 4 ± 2 3 3  . .  6 2 ± 7 7 2  . 1 − g g μ  , g m % , r s 1 − g g μ  , a b h t i l o t o % , a c , t h g e w i g m r e k a r l l i g r e b m u n , e g a s r a e y 0 * * * 0 * * 0 0  x e s s h t i l  o t o h s fi e t i h w i k o j i l i m e k r e v r f o s i s y a n a l a t n e m e e   1 l 4 8 –  - e f + e a m l ( , t h g e w i  s c p 7 + 2   s c p 8 + 1   8 9 ± 5 9 7  5 9 ± 3 4 6  l ) e a m g , h t g n e l m m  6 ± 3 4 4  1 2 ± 8 1 4  n 9 9  g n i l p m a s , e m ti r a e y - h t n o m l e p m a s 3 1 0 2 / 2 1 0 2 r e b o t c o 9 – 1 3 1 0 2 / 2 1 0 2 r e b o t c o 8 1 – 0 1 g y l w o l s – * * i e c n a c fi n g i s l a c ti s ti a t s  . s n a e m n e e w t e b s e c n e r e ff d d e t a c i d n  i i t s e t t s ’ t n e d u t s . i  n e v g e r a d s ± n a e m  . i g n w o r g y w o l s ;
