(2003) argued that genetically distinct populations should be consid- 550 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00369.x ered evolutionarily signiﬁcant units (sensu crandall et al. 2000) and be effectively protected in order to conserve the evolutionary heritage of the stickleback adaptive radiation. in the iberian peninsula, both in portugal and spain, the species is listed as endangered following iucn (international union for conserva- tion of nature) criteria, after having disappeared from most of its past distribution (doadrio 2002; cabral et al. 2005). these declines have been especially strong in mediterranean climate areas, while stickle- back seems to be still widespread and abundant in some areas under atlantic climatic conditions in nw iberian peninsula (ferna´ndez et al. 2006). despite intensive study of the stickleback as a model in ethological and evolutionary studies (woot- ton 1984; bell & foster 1994), few studies have examined stickleback in the southern limits of its distribution range, where the species faces its main conservation problems. most of the available infor- mation on stickleback in mediterranean areas comes from camargue (france), a large coastal wetland and agricultural area in the delta of the rhoˆne river (crivelli & britton 1987; poizat et al. 2002). similar studies are lacking in running waters with a mediter- ranean ﬂow-regime, although there is inherent interest in plasticity of in such harsh environments, and such information is critical for informed conservation. life-history traits in this work, we analyse the biology and habitat use of stickleback populations inhabiting streams with a typical mediterranean ﬂow-regime in catalonia (ne spain). our speciﬁc objectives were to: (i) report the ﬁrst data on the population structure, growth and variation in somatic condition among stickleback populations in mediterranean seasonal streams; (ii) identify the main habitat characteristics related to the presence and abundance of stickleback; and (iii) ' n " 0 0 ° 2 4 stickleback in mediterranean streams analyse the relationships of stickleback with other ﬁsh species and invasive crayﬁsh. materials and methods study area in these catchments this study was conducted in three different catch- ments, daro´, onyar and se`quia de sils, in girona (catalonia, ne spain), draining a mostly siliceous area (fig. 1). streams run from medium altitude forested mountain areas (600– 700 m elevation) to lowland alluvial plains with irrigated croplands and tree (mostly populus) planta- tions. the daro´ was originally an independent basin, running into the mediterranean sea through a small marsh area, but is now artiﬁcially connected to the larger ter river through a water diversion that maintains a constant ﬂow in the daro´ ’s lower reaches. the onyar is a natural tributary of the ter river, joining it in the city of girona. the se`quia de sils (henceforth simply se`quia) is a tributary of the tordera river, to the south of the ter. all three catchments are relatively homogeneous in terms of drainage area, lithology and land use (pou-rovira et al. 2007). climate in the study area is typically mediterranean, with an alternation of predictable dry and hot periods and much more unpredictable wet periods with frequent ﬂash ﬂoods (gasith & resh 1999). all streams in the study area cease their superﬁcial water ﬂow during summer, with water being retained only in a few isolated pools or runs that tend to occur where bedrock appears near the surface, mostly concentrated in the foothill sectors. the effects of summer droughts are exacerbated by water extractions for agricultural (mainly corn) irrigation and urban supply. in average years, summer water ﬂow in the lower reaches is maintained almost 3°0'0"e fig. 1. location of the study area, showing the 118 sites in which fyke net surveys were performed. black dots indicate sites in which three-spined stickleback was present and white dots denote sites in which the species was not detected. the main three drainages in the area and their limits (broken lines) are also shown. north arrow indicates true north. onyar sèquia de sils 3°0'0"e daró n 5 0 10 km ' n " 0 0 ° 2 4 551 clavero et al. exclusively through the efﬂuents of sewage plants, which bear an important organic load, or through punctual water diversions (as in the lower daro´ ). as a result of these water inputs, the lower reaches of the three basins maintain some water ﬂow throughout summer. the studied streams are mostly unregulated, harbouring only some small weirs (pou-rovira et al. 2007). potential stickleback predators in the study area include ﬁsh (especially eel, anguilla anguilla, which is present throughout the area), birds (mainly little egret, egretta garzetta; night heron, nycticorax nycticorax; and kingﬁsher, alcedo atthis), mammals (the invasive american mink, mustela vison) and viperine snake (natrix maura), which is locally abundant. fish surveys and habitat characterisation we performed two complementary ﬁsh surveys to address our main objectives. to characterise stickle- back growth, reproduction and somatic condition we collected individuals in 60 sites on 97 occasions, using a variety of ﬁshing methodologies, including fyke nets, dip nets and backpack electroﬁshing (samus 725g, samus special electronics, http://www. electro-ﬁsher.com). although these surveys were not seasonally replicated in a systematic fashion they covered every month (except october) and could thus be used to analyse temporal variation in ﬁsh size and condition, or to identify reproduction events. captured stickleback were measured (fork length to the nearest millimetre), weighed (to the nearest 0.01 g) and, when possible, sexed attending to external sexual dimor- phism. whenever we made large stickleback captures we only measured and weighed a subsample of 100– 200 individuals. to study the characteristics of stickleback popula- tions and their relationships with other ﬁsh and crayﬁsh species and with habitat features, we per- formed standardised ﬁsh sampling between april and september in 118 sites (in 2006 and 2007; fig. 1). in these surveys, we used unbaited fyke nets with a single wing (of approx. 1 m), two funnels and a 3.5-mm mesh size. this type of fyke net is an efﬁcient passive method for monitoring small-stream ﬁsh populations (clavero et al. 2006). we usually set three fyke nets per site (mean 3.67; range 2–10) leaving them for 24 h. captured ﬁsh were identiﬁed to species, counted, measured (stickleback were also weighed) and re- turned to the water. we also counted captured red swamp crayﬁsh (procambarus clarkii), an invasive north american species widely distributed in the iberian peninsula and often abundant in the study area, in which native white-clawed crayﬁsh (austropotamo- bius pallipes) is presently absent. fish and crayﬁsh captures were expressed as catch per unit of effort (cpue, individuals · trap )1 · day )1). 552 table 1. environmental variables recorded in each of the 118 sites surveyed by means of fyke nets. transformations are also given whenever they were used for further statistical analyses. environmental variables values transformation mean (±sd) )1) conductivity (ls · cm ph mean width (m) mean depth (cm) maximum depth (cm) bedrock boulders cobbles and gravel sand silt tree cover leafy debris woody debris roots periphyton filamentous algae and bryophytes submerged macrophytes helophytes natural dykes continuous continuous continuous continuous continuous coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 log10 – square root square root square root – – – – – – – – – – – coded 0–5 coded 0–5 coded 0–5 – – – 650.2 ± 342.9 7.62 ± 0.34 3.53 ± 2.57 0.46 ± 36 1.01 ± 0.58 0.46 ± 1.01 1.89 ± 1.41 2.03 ± 1.07 2.81 ± 1.38 1.79 ± 1.49 3.24 ± 1.43 1.31 ± 1.04 1.53 ± 0.78 1.01 ± 0.85 1.06 ± 1.11 1.46 ± 1.57 0.61 ± 0.87 1.76 ± 1.34 0.79 ± 1.11 at each sampling site, we recorded 19 habitat variables (table 1). many of these variables, espe- cially those related to cover proportions, were codiﬁed in a 0–5 semi-quantitative scale, where: 0, 0%; 1, 1–10%; 2, 11–25%, 3, 26–50%; 4, 51–75%; and 5, 76–100%. these proportions were visually estimated and usually averaged between at least two observers. to assess the relative proportion of different substrate types (using the 0–5 scale), we used a simpliﬁed substrate classiﬁcation with ﬁve levels: silt (<1 ⁄ 8 mm in diameter; i.e., materials able to be suspended in water); sand (1 ⁄ 8–2 mm); gravel (2–64 mm); cobble and boulders (>64 mm) and bedrock. data analyses the stickleback population structure was graphically analysed through the variation of length–frequency histograms constructed for six bimensual periods and the monthly mean fork length. somatic condition of stickleback was calculated using fulton’s condition factor (mills & eloranta 1985; copp & kovac 2003): )3, where w is the wet weight (in k = w · 105 · fl g) and fl is the fork length (in mm). the monthly variation in stickleback somatic condition was assessed through one-way anova, using k as the dependent variable and month as factor. main habitat gradients present in our study area were deﬁned by means of partial principal components analysis (pca) on a matrix of 118 study sites · 19 habitat variables. basins (daro´ , onyar and se`quia) were included as covariates in order to extract environmental gradients common to the whole study area. in order the species (cpue, we assessed habitat use of stickleback following two complementary approaches. first, we compared habitat characteristics of sites where stickleback were present with those of the sites where the species was not detected (henceforth absences). we conducted one-way anova using the components (factor scores) extracted by the pca, the abundance of invasive ﬁsh species and the abundance of red swamp crayﬁsh as dependent variables, to detect possible inﬂuences of habitat gradients on the presence of stickleback. we excluded, from these analyses, 27 sites in which no ﬁsh were detected (usually low-order small brooks). in a second approach, we related the relative abundance of log10- transformed) with habitat characteristics from sites where stickleback were detected. simple correlation analyses were used to test the associations between stickleback relative abundance and the habitat gradi- ents deﬁned by the pca, the abundance of invasive ﬁsh species and the abundance of red swamp crayﬁsh. then we used these variables to build a multiple regression model with stickleback abundance as the dependent variable. we followed a manually con- ducted backward stepwise procedure to construct minimum adequate models (mam). retention of independent variables in the models relied on statis- tical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05), which is a more restric- tive criterion than information criteria (i.e., akaike information criterion) that tend to leave more inde- pendent variables in ﬁnal models (crawley 2002). finally, we performed a partial canonical corre- spondence analysis (cca) to summarise the variation in ﬁsh and crayﬁsh communities, and the role of stickleback, in relation to habitat characteristics. cca is a direct gradient multivariate analysis in which species data can be directly related to a set of environmental variables, through a combination of ordination and multiple regression techniques. the stickleback in mediterranean streams species matrix submitted to the cca consisted of 107 sites (excluding sites without ﬁsh or crayﬁsh catch- es) · the log10(cpue+1) of 11 species (10 ﬁsh + 1 crayﬁsh). rare non-native species (<5% occurrence) were pooled as a single ‘species’ (other invasive species or ois; table 2). the environmental matrix used in the cca included the 19 variables listed in table 1. environmental variables were selected using manual forward selection, which tests the signiﬁcance of the variables through monte carlo permutations (n = 499), and only variables with p < 0.05 were retained (ter braak & smilauer 1998). the statistical signiﬁcance of the cca’s ﬁrst axis and of the whole ordination were also tested through monte carlo permutations (n = 1000), testing whether these ﬁnal solutions explained more variance than expected by chance. the three different basins were included as covariables in order to control for the possible spatial structure of our data. we used the biplot scaling, which is recommended for gradient lengths up to 4 sd (ter braak & smilauer 1998), as preliminary detrended correspondence analysis produced a ﬁrst axis of 3.8 sd units in length. we also used the downweigh- ing of rare species. statistical analyses were performed using spss 15.0 and canoco 4.5 programs. results population structure, somatic growth and condition we measured 6177 and weighed 2243 stickleback individuals during the year-round stickleback collec- tions. stickleback populations were mainly composed of young-of-the-year (yoy) individuals, which al- most disappeared in early summer, after the end of their ﬁrst breeding season (fig. 2a). we only caught a few individuals that survived their second summer, most of them females, although we did not get any table 2. frequency of occurrence of ﬁsh and crayﬁsh species captured during the fyke net surveys in 118 sites and their relative abundance in relation to the total catch. species codes and their status (n, native;

p = 0.001 for males). the somatic condition of juve- niles reached minimum values during summer and early autumn months, coinciding with the stop in somatic growth, progressively increasing thereafter until the end of the winter. adult somatic condition suffered a sharp decline during and after spring-time reproduction 554 events, both in males and females, reaching minimum levels, as for juveniles, in summer (fig. 3c). habitat gradients and stickleback populations (pc1, pc2 and pc3) the pca of habitat variables produced three habitat gradients that altogether explained 60.8% of the variance contained in the original dataset. pc1 described an upstream–down- stream gradient; pc2 was related to the presence of submerged vegetation; and pc3 was associated with changes in substrate coarseness (table 3). there was a clear difference between the positions of occupied and unoccupied locations along pc2 (table 4), the former having more cobbles and gravels, more ﬁlamentous algae and bryophytes, less silty substrates and less woody and leafy debris. after selecting only locations occupied by stickle- back, abundances were positively related to submerged and ﬁlamentous macrophyte algae-bryophytes the proportion of (p = 0.001), (p < 0.001) cover e c n a d n u b a k c a b e k c i t l s ) 1 + e u p c ( 0 1 g o l 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –2 –1 tree cover woody debris leave debris silt 0 pc2 1 2 3 fil. algae and bryophytes cobbles and gravel periphyton fig. 3. relationships between stickleback abundance and the environmental gradient deﬁned by principal component 2. stick- leback abundance tended to increase towards areas with cobble and gravel substrates, abundant submerged vegetation and scarce riverine forest cover. table 3. main environmental gradients (pc1, pc2 and pc3) deﬁned in the study area by means of partial principal components analysis (pca). the three studied basins were included in the analysis as covariates. factors loadings with absolute value >0.3 are marked in bold. environmental variables pc1 pc2 conductivity ph mean width mean depth maximum depth bedrock boulders cobbles and gravel sand silt tree cover leafy debris woody debris roots periphyton filamentous algae and bryophytes submerged macrophytes helophytes natural dykes eigenvalues 0.50 0.38 0.54 0.22 0.49 )0.49 )0.70 )0.60 )0.14 0.81 )0.66 )0.56 )0.15 )0.58 )0.15 )0.32 0.17 0.63 )0.68 6.27 0.21 0.09 0.11 )0.05 )0.14 )0.20 0.21 0.32 0.26 )0.33 )0.52 )0.39 )0.49 )0.35 0.32 0.72 0.21 0.26 )0.27 3.20 pc3 )0.12 )0.10 )0.08 0.16 0.12 0.31 0.35 )0.12 )0.78 0.32 )0.08 )0.08 )0.06 )0.07 0.27 0.21 0.12 0.07 0.30 2.08 stickleback in mediterranean streams abundance and included, as signiﬁcant independent variables, pc2 (b = 0.38; p < 0.001) and the abun- dance of invasive species (b = )0.29; p = 0.042). thus, after accounting for the relationship between stickleback abundance and pc2 (fig. 3), the species tended to be scarcer in locations with a high abundance of invasive ﬁsh species. habitat gradients and ﬁsh communities only 9 of the original 19 environmental variables were retained in the ﬁnal solution of the cca, which, as well as the ﬁrst axis, the monte carlo test proved to be signiﬁcant (p < 0.001 in both cases). the covariates included in the analysis (i.e., the three different basins) accounted for 14.9% of the variation in the species dataset, with environmental variables accounting for a further 31.0%, 72% of which was accounted for in the ﬁrst and the second axes. the ﬁrst axis of the cca (eigenvalue = 0.361; 56.6% of the species–environ- ment relationship) clearly segregated locations domi- nated by invasive ﬁsh species from those dominated by freshwater native ones (excluding eel; fig. 4a). invasive species dominance was associated to down- stream areas, with high water conductivity and proportion of silt, wide channels and low proportion of bedrock (fig. 4b). both eel and crayﬁsh had intermediate values along cca’s axis 1, suggesting a random-fashioned use of the upstream–downstream gradient. the second axis of the cca (eigenvalue = 0.098; 15.4% of the species–environment relationship) was mainly related to the variation in native-dominated communities (fig. 4c). this axis segregated locations dominated by native cyprinids (barbel and chub), characterised by the high proportion of bedrock and abundant leafy debris (i.e., more forested stretches), from those dominated by stickleback, which were associated with high abundance of submerged vege- tation. stickleback and crayﬁsh scored towards oppo- site extremes along cca’s axis 2, a segregation that was related to the presence of aquatic vegetation. cumulative per cent of explained variance 33.0 49.8 60.8 discussion boulders (p = 0.008) and maximum depth (p = 0.04), while they were negatively related to the proportion of silt (p = 0.05). as in the presence–absence analyses, the habitat gradient deﬁned by pc2 was strongly and positively related to stickleback abundance (fig. 3). stickleback were also found to be less abundant in locations with high crayﬁsh densities (table 4). the ﬁnal mam resulting from the multiple regression analyses explained 27.3% of the variation in stickleback population structure, somatic growth and condition in the study area the stickleback has an almost strictly annual life cycle, with all individuals maturing after them dying after their ﬁrst winter, and most of reproduction. a small proportion of individuals survived their second summer, as we caught three adult males between august and september and up to nine adult females as late as december, but they did not seem to participate in reproduction events as 2+ ﬁsh. in mediterranean wetlands in southern france, 555 clavero et al. mean absences (n = 41) mean presences (n = 50) t-value p correlation with stickleback cpue p pc1 pc2 pc3 invasive ﬁsh cpue crayﬁsh cpue 0.26 )0.36 )0.04 0.38 0.49 )0.07 0.41 0.00 0.43 0.69 1.57 3.70 0.20 0.37 1.65 0.120 )0.24 0.45 >0.001 0.843 0.11 0.712 )0.21 0.103 )0.28 0.096 0.001 0.462 0.147 0.049 pc, principal component;

(2008) described a wide range in the mean breeding age of female stickleback from alaska, which varied between 1+ and 3–4+. anadromous stickleback populations also dis- play late maturation, often at age 2+ with a low proportion of 1+ individuals participating in repro- duction events (e.g., dufrense et al. 1990; baker et al. 2008). in our study area, stickleback growth was concen- trated in two different periods, one in spring and early summer and another in autumn–winter. there was a well-deﬁned low growth phase during summer months (fig. 2b), coinciding with the harshest period of summer droughts in mediterranean streams (gasith & resh 1999). growth also seemed to stop after reproduction events (february–april), when mean sizes of both males and females even started decreas- ing. this latter pattern could be related to earlier reproduction of larger individuals that would after- wards lead to increased mortality rates (jones & hynes 1950). both periods of slow or null body growth coincided with periods of low somatic condition, although patterns in body condition changes were more or less delayed by one month with respect to those in growth rates (fig. 2b,c). the growth pattern of stickleback in mediterranean environments clearly contrasts with those reported elsewhere. in the camargue wetlands, in southern france and also under mediterranean climate condi- tions, stickleback growth slowed during summer, although this pattern was only evident in terms of body weight, as mean body size showed a constant increase at least from april to january (crivelli & britton 1987). the summer stop in somatic growth detected in our study area could be highlighting the harsher environmental conditions found in intermittent mediterranean streams in comparison with the rela- tively more stable wetlands. in more northern latitudes stickleback growth is concentrated in the ﬁrst spring and summer of life, almost stopping during winter (e.g., pollux et al. 2006). continuous growth during winter allows stickleback in our study area to reach large sizes at the time of reproduction. in september– october mean length was 32.4 mm, which is slightly larger than individuals from the camargue (29 mm; crivelli & britton 1987) but smaller than those from wales (36 mm; wootton 2007) or the meuse estuary (40 mm; pollux et al. 2006). however, in february– march stickleback from streams in our study area were clearly larger (mean length for males and females combined was 54.6 mm) than those from the camar- gue (39–45 mm, data from two different cohorts) or wales (41 mm). this high grow rate in mediterranean locations during winter, especially intense in intermit- tent streams, could be interpreted as some kind of compensatory growth, which is deﬁned as a high growth rate phase following a period of growth depression (wootton 2004). this growth depression is typically caused by low food availability (ali et al. 2003), but in isolated summer pools in mediterranean streams food shortages are combined with high water temperatures (often above 25 °c) and low oxygen concentrations (magalha˜es et al. 2002). interestingly, other native freshwater ﬁshes in iberian mediterranean streams experience neither a low growth summer phase comparable with that of the stickleback nor a continuous growth phase in winter. in fact, the growth of native cyprinids and cobitids is usually continuous in spring and summer and slows down or even stops during winter (e.g., torralva et al. 1997; oliva-paterna et al. 2002). the freshwater blenny (salaria ﬂuviatilis) shows some growth decel- eration during summer, but growth is also reduced in winter (vinyoles & de sostoa 2007). the stickleback growth pattern is therefore exceptional among med- iterranean stream ﬁsh. having evolved in colder environments, stickleback are able to grow in the relatively mild mediterranean winters, but the harsh conditions imposed by summer droughts might put the species near its tolerance limits. habitat, communities and stickleback the most consistent associations between stickleback presence or abundance and habitat features were the preference for stream stretches with an important aquatic vegetation cover and the relative avoidance of both strongly forested stretches and areas where silty substrates dominated (table 4 and fig. 3). the selec- tion of areas with abundant aquatic vegetation should be in part linked to the reproductive behaviour of stickleback. at the beginning of the breeding season stickleback males defend a territory where they build a nest, using mainly plant materials glued together with a protein secretion (bell & foster 1994). choice of nest site by male stickleback has been shown to be stickleback in mediterranean streams variable, although in the presence of predators vege- tated sites are usually preferred (candolin & voigt 1998) and some works have even noted a strict preference for such vegetated sites (cleveland 1994). as has been shown for other ﬁsh species, yoy may also prefer submerged vegetation, which affords protection from predators (rodewald & foster 1998; clavero et al. 2005) and increased availability of trophic resources (rozas & odum 1988; diehl & kornijow 1998). the negative relationship between the abundances of red swamp crayﬁsh and stickleback (table 3) as well as the separation of the two species along cca axis 2 (fig. 4) could be mediated by the stickleback’s preference for vegetated sites. red swamp crayﬁsh have a high potential to transform aquatic ecosystems, often reducing dramatically the abundance of sub- merged macrophytes and leading to strong decreases in water transparency (go´ mez-yurita & montes 1999; rodrı´guez et al. 2005), processes that have been pointed out as one of the main threats for iberian stickleback populations (doadrio 2002). however, red swamp crayﬁsh might be unable to achieve high densities in intermittent streams such as those of our study area, and thus, although its negative effects have been detected, there can be a certain level of coexistence between this species and stickleback. the ﬁrst axis of the cca showed a clear segrega- tion of native- and invasive-dominated communities, with the latter occupying mostly lower reaches (fig. 4). these lower reaches are the only stretches in the area that maintain running waters in summer through artiﬁcial inﬂows (pou-rovira et al. 2007). this produces an attenuation of the natural drought and ﬂood cycles in mediterranean streams, which favours invasive species that have evolved in more stable aquatic environments (e.g., clavero et al. 2004). the dominance of invasive ﬁsh species in mediterra- nean areas with altered ﬂow regimes has been noted both in europe (e.g., godinho & ferreira 2000) and california (e.g., marchetti & moyle 2001). the high abundance of invasive ﬁsh species in the lower reaches of the studied streams could be related to the scarce presence of stickleback in them, and could thus limit their possible role of refugia during summer droughts. this idea is reinforced by the multiple regression model the effects of environmental gradients, showed a negative relation between the abundances of stickleback and invasive species. previous local extinctions of stickleback populations have been related to the introduction of invasive ﬁsh species, both in the iberian peninsula (ferna´ndez-delgado et al. 2000; garcı´a-berthou & moreno-amich 2000) and in north america (foster et al. 2003; von hippel 2008). however, the mecha- nisms involved in the negative effects of invasive that, after accounting for 557 clavero et al. species (e.g., predation, competition, reproductive interference) are often unclear, and deserve further work, ideally in controlled experimental environments. this work presents the ﬁrst data on stickleback biology and habitat use in intermittent mediterranean streams. mediterranean aquatic ecosystems are highly variable both temporally and spatially and at different scales (e.g., both in intra- and inter-annual bases) (gasith & resh 1999). thus, it would be necessary to obtain comparable data on stickleback biology from different mediterranean locations, as well as to initiate long-term monitoring programmes (e.g., wootton 2007) in order to better understand the life-history adaptations of stickleback to such unstable environ- ments. this information should be a useful tool for the conservation of stickleback populations in mediterra- nean streams, which have suffered sharp and wide- spread declines. the interest to preserve stickleback populations is enhanced by their exceptional value to infer evolu- tionary processes (foster et al. 2003). the stickleback is a highly variable taxon that has colonised a wide variety of freshwater environments in multiple colo- nisation events occurring from millions of years ago until the present (baker et al. 2008). this has resulted in repeated and independent adaptive radiation from an oceanic ancestor that has given rise to many forms varying in external features and life history (bell & foster 1994) and has provided an exceptional case study to analyse evolutionary radiation and speciation (e.g., mckinnon & rundle 2002; foster & baker 2004). foster et al. (2003) argued that the value of each stickleback population is elevated by its mem- bership in the adaptive radiation. southern populations of the species are exceptional in that they do not come from postglacial colonisation events and are among the oldest extant freshwater stickleback populations. they should thus be an important component of the adaptive radiation of the species. the current imper- illed status of mediterranean populations should motivate the society to conserve them and avoid further irreplaceable losses within the stickleback evolutionary heritage. acknowledgements many people took part in the ﬁeld work, too many to write their names here. the authors are grateful to all of them. they also thank v. hermoso, f. blanco-garrido and two anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions on early versions of the manuscript. this work was partially ﬁnanced by the consorci de les gavarres through the ‘joan xirgu’ grant, the cityhall of torroella de montgrı´ through the ‘joan torro´ ’ grant and by the diputacio´ de girona through the ‘francesc eiximenis’ grant. m. clavero beneﬁted from juan de la cierva contract funded by the spanish ministry of education and science (mec). 558 references ali, m., nicieza, a. & wootton, r.j. 2003. compensatory growth in ﬁshes: a response to growth depression. fish and fisheries 4: 147–190. baker, j.a., heins, d.c., foster, s.a. & king, r.w. 2008. an life-history variation in female threespine overview of stickleback. behaviour 145: 579–602. bell, m.a. & foster, s.a. 1994. the evolutionary biology of the threespine stickleback. oxford: oxford university press. 584 pp. ter braak, c.j.f. & smilauer, p. 1998. canoco reference manual and user’s guide to canoco for windows: software for canonical community ordination (version 4). ithaca: microcomputer power. cabral, m.j., almeida, j., almeida, p.r., dellinger, t., ferrand de almeida, n., oliveira, m.e., palmeirim, j.m., queiroz, a.m., rogado, l. & santos reis, m.
