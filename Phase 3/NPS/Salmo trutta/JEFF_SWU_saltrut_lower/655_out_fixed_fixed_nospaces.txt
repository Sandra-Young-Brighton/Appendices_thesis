(1999) demonstrated that exclusion of terrestrial litter inputs from a headwater stream resulted in a 78% decline in secondary production by benthic inverte- brates. nakano & murakami (2001) estimated that ter- restrial the annual total energy budget of a ﬁsh assemblage in a stream ﬂowing through a deciduous broadleaved forest. because quantity and quality of such allochth- invertebrate inputs supported 44% of correspondence: m. inoue, graduate school of science and engineering, ehime university, bunkyo-cho 2-5, matsuyama 790-8577, japan. e-mail: inom@sci. ehime-u.ac.jp doi: 10.1111/eff.12029 335 inoue et al. onous resources can vary depending on riparian con- ditions, alteration of riparian forests could strongly affect stream communities. to conifer plantations has in many regions of the world, plantation forestry is a major cause of extensive changes in forest vegeta- tion (friberg 1997; kerr 1999; giller & o’halloran 2004; hicks et al. 2004; nagaike et al. 2006). coni- fers are often used for commercial forestry, and such conifer plantations are characterised as monotypic, even-aged stands. most regions where conifer planta- tions dominate are located in biomes of deciduous or evergreen broadleaved forests (northern europe: friberg 1997; kerr 1999; giller & o’halloran 2004; new zealand: hicks et al. 2004; japan: inoue & nakamura 2004). therefore, conversion of broad- leaved forests raised concerns about their impacts on stream ecosystems (friberg 1997; riipinen et al. 2010). although effects of deforestation (timber harvest, agricultural develop- ment) on stream communities have been widely examined (murphy et al. 1986; benstead & pringle 2004; england & rosemond 2004), studies on drastic changes in forest types owing to effects of conifer plantations have been limited to relatively restricted geographical regions, such as northern europe (e.g., giller & o’halloran 2004). most of these have focused on input of plant litter as an energy source for benthic invertebrates. effects of conifer planta- tions on terrestrial invertebrate inputs as food for stream ﬁshes have rarely been examined (but see ormerod et al. 2004). terrestrial although the importance of inverte- brates as food for stream ﬁshes has long been recognised (mason & macdonald 1982), only recently have strong effects of terrestrial prey sub- sidy on stream communities been demonstrated (nakano et al. 1999; kawaguchi et al. 2003; baxter et al. 2004). nakano et al. (1999) and baxter et al. (2004) showed that experimental reduction in terres- trial prey inputs to fenced reaches of a headwater stream altered foraging behaviour of ﬁsh, which in turn caused strong indirect effects on invertebrates and periphyton. when a similar experiment was conducted in un-fenced reaches, exclusion of terres- trial prey inputs reduced ﬁsh biomass by nearly half via et al. 2003). these experiments showed that differences in terrestrial prey inputs can alter ﬁsh abundance and benthic communities. deciduous broadleaved trees can sup- port higher densities of terrestrial invertebrates than conifers (allan et al. 2003) and conifer plantations have lower species richness of certain terrestrial insect taxa compared to natural broadleaved forests (ohsawa 2005; makino et al. 2007; and references therein). therefore, terrestrial prey inputs may be in streams ﬂowing through conifer less abundant emigration (kawaguchi 336 plantations than in those through natural broad- leaved forests. in japan, 67% of the total land area is covered by forests, most of which have been affected by human activities (inoue & nakamura 2004). although plan- tation forestry in japan had been established by the 1800s (totman 1998), it was not until the 1960s that intensive conversion from natural broadleaved forests (including coppices) to conifer plantations became prevalent. at present, 40% of the total forest areas (i.e., more than a quarter of the total land area of japan) is occupied by conifer plantations (typically japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica, or japanese cypress chamaecyparis obtusa) (inoue & nakamura 2004; nagaike et al. 2006). the extensive and drastic changes in forest vegetation to conifer plantations since the 1960s may have greatly altered stream communities and ecological processes. in this study, we compared terrestrial prey inputs, drifting prey abundance and ﬁsh diet among stream reaches with contrasting riparian vegetation (decidu- ous broadleaved forests, conifer plantations and clear-cut sites) across seasons to provide fundamental information for forest and ﬁsheries management. we also examined whether differences in ﬁsh abundance among reaches were linked to the riparian forest types. if conifer plantations support lower densities of terrestrial invertebrates, streams in conifer planta- tions could receive lower terrestrial prey inputs and support lower ﬁsh abundance. methods study area (33°55′n, 132°54′e; near the study was conducted in headwater streams of the ishite river the forest research center of ehime university), a tributary of the shigenobu river in shikoku, southwestern japan. the climate is warm-temperate and potential natural vegetation is evergreen (elevation <700 m) or decidu- ous (>700 m) broadleaved forests. annual precipita- tion is ca. 1800 mm, with a rainy season from mid june to mid july (rainy season in japan). headwater catchments of the ishite river are covered by natural broadleaved forest, plantations of evergreen conifers (japanese cedar or japanese cypress), or clear-cut harvested area. natural broadleaved forests and har- vested areas are patchily distributed in the matrix of conifer plantation stands. the natural broadleaved forests are secondary forests of deciduous-dominated stands, formerly harvested using coppice forestry for charcoal production. streams in the study area have high-gradient, boulder-dominated channels, although sand and gravel are common owing to weathered granite underlying the catchments. the dominant ﬁsh is red-spotted masu salmon (oncorhynchus_masou ishikawae, hereafter masu salmon), a resident form which is common in headwater streams in southwest- ern japan and the focus of this study. two other species, a minnow (rhynchocypris oxycephalus) and a goby (rhinogobius ﬂumineus), are distributed in several locations in the study area. a few headwater reaches are inhabited by resident japanese charr (salvelinus_leucomaenis), which is nonnative in this region. we established six study sites (50–100 m stream reaches) representing the three vegetation types (deciduous broadleaved, conifer plantation, clear-cut; two sites per type) to measure seasonal and among-site differences in the abundance of potential prey for masu salmon and their diet. in 46 reaches with four different riparian conditions, we also quan- tiﬁed habitat characteristics and the abundance of masu salmon to examine whether masu salmon abun- dance was related to riparian forest types. prey abundance and masu salmon diet such as the six study sites were selected according to the contrast in riparian conditions (broadleaved: b1, b2; plantation: p1, p2; clear-cut: c1, c2; table 1). the riparian zones of the two broadleaved sites (b1, b2) were secondary forests dominated by deciduous spe- cies, fusa-zakura (euptelea polyandra), yama-guwa (morus australis), maples (acer spp.) and an oak (quercus serrata), with some evergreen broadleaved species (e.g., camellia japonica, laura- ceae) mixed in the lower layer, whereas those of the plantation sites (p1, p2) were occupied by japanese cedar plantations. the plantation of p2 consisted entirely of japanese cedar, whereas that of p1 also included a few japanese cypress. both plantations were ca. 45 years old, with no insecticide applied. the clear-cut sites were established at areas harvested 1 year (c2) and more than 8 years (c1) before our investigation (both formerly japanese cedar planta- tion). the harvested area of c1 stretched ca. 200 m along the stream on the right-hand slope. although seedlings of japanese cedar had been replanted in the harvested area, the tree heights were less than 2 m and streamside vegetation was dominated by shrubs (e.g., deutzia spp., rhus javanica) and herbs. there- fore, stream channel of the c1 was not yet covered by canopy (see table 1 for canopy openness). the harvested area of c2 was smaller than that of c1, stretching ca. 80 m along the stream on the left-hand slope. a few broadleaved trees (low-valued timber) along the stream banks were left uncut, and the chan- nel was partially covered by their canopies. there- fore, canopy openness at c2 was lower than that at c1 (table 1). although canopy openness was higher at the broadleaved and the clear-cut sites than at effects of plantation forestry on masu salmon plantation sites, water temperature was similar among the six sites (around 20 °c at the summer maximum; table 1). at each site, we sampled terrestrial invertebrate inputs, drifting invertebrates and masu salmon for their diets. we also quantiﬁed the abundance of aerial invertebrates as a potential source of terrestrial prey inputs to streams. although aquatically derived inver- tebrates (aerial adults of aquatic insects) have often been not regarded as terrestrial invertebrates (e.g., cloe & garman 1996; wipﬂi 1997), ‘terrestrial inver- tebrates’ in this study was deﬁned as invertebrates that live in the riparian zone and fall into streams. therefore, adults of aquatic insects were regarded as terrestrial, because we focus on prey inputs from out- side of the stream as food availability reﬂecting ripar- ian vegetation effects. adult aquatic insects need terrestrial vegetation for resting and moulting sites, and thus, can be strongly inﬂuenced by terrestrial vegetation (saunders & fausch 2007). aerial invertebrates were sampled using malaise trap (townes 1972) bimonthly from august 2006 to june 2007. a malaise trap (1.9 m high, 2.1 m long, 1.2 mm mesh) was placed across the stream at upstream end, middle and downstream end of each study site (three traps per site) for 5 days in each sampling month. invertebrates sampled were pre- served in 70% ethanol. falling inputs of terrestrial invertebrates were sampled using pan traps bimonthly from august 2006 to august 2007. eight grey-col- oured pan traps (0.3 m 9 0.4 m area, 0.15 m depth) ﬁlled with water and a few drops of surfactant (liquid soap) were placed along the banks of each site for 10 days. the invertebrates were removed with a hand net (0.3 mm mesh) and preserved in 70% ethanol. drifting invertebrates were sampled in early summer (june 2006), early autumn (september 2006), winter (february 2007) and again in early summer (may table 1. characteristics of of the ishite river.

0.25-m opening, 0.3-mm mesh) was placed in a rifﬂe at each site for 30– 50 min, depending on current velocity (care was taken so as not to be overﬂowed by clogging). to estimate the volume of water sieved, current velocity was measured at the centre of the net opening using a current metre (model cr-11; cosmo riken inc., kashihara, japan). the sampling was conducted on 5 days each month in june and september 2006 and february 2007 and on 4 days in may 2007. on each sampling day, the six sites were sampled simulta- neously during the daytime (900–1600 h). masu salmon was sampled in early summer (june 2006) and early autumn (september 2006) for diet composition and population estimates. in winter (february 2007) and early the next summer (may 2007), sampling was conducted only for diets. in june and september 2006, both ends of the study reach of each site were blocked with 5-mm mesh nets and three removal passes were made using an electro- ﬁshing unit (model 12 backpack electroﬁsher; smith-root inc., vancouver, wa, usa). all ﬁsh captured were measured for fork length. ten to 20 individuals were anaesthetised with fa100 (tamura- seiyaku pharmaceutical, tokyo, japan) and their stomach contents were sampled by ﬂushing the stom- ach with ﬁltered stream water (kawaguchi & nakano 2001). all ﬁsh were then released alive. the number of individuals in each study site was estimated using the removal method (carle & strub 1978). the bio- mass of masu salmon was estimated using a length- weight regression (m. inoue, unpublished data) and expressed as wet weight (g) per 100-m2 area. in feb- ruary and may 2007, 10–20 individuals were cap- tured by electroﬁshing in each site and their stomach contents sampled. unfortunately, we caught only one individual in site b2 in february; hence, this was not included in the analysis. samples of aerial invertebrates (malaise trap), fall- ing invertebrates (pan traps), drift and stomach con- tents were sorted, identiﬁed to order or family and categorised as terrestrial or aquatic invertebrates and weighed (dry weight; 60 °c for 48 h). the abun- dances of aerial, falling, and drifting invertebrates were expressed as dry weight per trap per 5 days (mgtrap  1), dry weight per area per day  1 5-day (mgm  2 day  1) and dry weight per volume of (mg100 m  3), sieved water respectively. annual (gm inputs falling invertebrate from august 2006 to july 2007, were estimated using the daily input rate (mgm  2 day  1) from pan traps in each month. daily input rate in the other months when sampling was not conducted was estimated as the mean value of the neighbouring months. because our values of invertebrate abundance included aquatically derived insects, we also roughly  2 year terrestrial  1), 338 estimated values only for terrestrially derived inverte- brates by excluding most adult aquatic insects (ephemeroptera, odonata, plecoptera, trichoptera and nematocera) so that our results could be com- pared with previous studies that did not consider adult aquatic insects as terrestrial. detected among-site differences were to examine among-site differences in the abun- dances of aerial, falling and drifting invertebrates, two-way analysis of variance (anova) with site and sampling month as factors was used. when a site effect was signiﬁcant without site 9 month interac- tion, subsequently examined using least signiﬁcant difference (lsd) multiple comparisons. when a signiﬁcant effect of site 9 month interaction was by the two-way anova, the site effect was examined sepa- rately by month using one-way anova and subsequent lsd multiple comparisons. we could not statistically assess effects of riparian forest types owing to insufﬁ- cient site replication (only two sites per type). there- fore, we statistically assessed effects of site, and then considered whether detected site effects could be attributed to differences in riparian forest types. we also assessed correlations between abundances of aer- ial and falling invertebrates, falling and drifting inver- tebrates and drifting invertebrates and masu salmon, to examine the links between forest vegetation and salmon abundance through prey ﬂux. because the abundances of falling and drifting invertebrates can reﬂect an immediate effect of those of aerial and fall- ing invertebrates, respectively (e.g., falling inverte- brates can easily become drifting invertebrates), correlations among aerial, falling, and drifting inver- tebrates were examined separately in autumn (sep- tember–october 2006), winter (february 2007), and early summer (may–june 2007), in which these three types of data were all available. on the other hand, effects of drifting invertebrate abundance on salmon abundance are not immediate but longer term. there- fore, we averaged all data available when examining correlations between salmon and drift abundances. abundance values were log10-transformed to improve normality, and the analyses were performed using spss (version 13; spss inc., chicago, il, usa). riparian vegetation, habitat characteristics, and masu salmon abundance we established 46 study reaches (40–60 m in length) over the area of the headwater catchment (about 25-km2 catchment area including ﬁve tributaries) to examine effects of riparian vegetation types on resi- dent masu salmon abundance. the study reaches were categorised into four types based on riparian vegetation and canopy above the channel. reaches were categorised as deciduous broadleaved (n = 6), conifer plantations (n = 11), or clear-cut reaches (n = 5). however, in conifer plantations, natural broadleaved trees had frequently colonised stream banks, forming broadleaved canopies above the chan- nel. such reaches were categorised as b/p reaches (broadleaved canopy in plantation, n = 24). in each study reach, masu salmon were sampled using one-pass electroﬁshing (model 12 backpack electroﬁsher, smith-root inc.) with 5-mm mesh block nets during june–july 2007. the fork length of captured ﬁsh was measured, and their wet weight was estimated using the length–weight regression. masu salmon relative abundance was expressed as biomass (g wet weight per 100-m2 area) of captured ﬁsh (we did not conduct population estimate, as the ﬁsh were captured by one-pass electroﬁshing). we conﬁrmed that the biomass based on one-pass elec- troﬁshing was strongly correlated with that based on three-pass removal estimates by carle & strub (1978) (r2 = 0.997, p < 0.001, n = 36; regression slope = 0.978). habitat variables representing longitudinal position (catchment area), stream size (mean wetted width) and the area of habitat types (areal percentages of pools and cover), which are potentially important fac- tors inﬂuencing salmonid abundance (inoue et al. 1997; inoue & nakano 1998; urabe & nakano 1998), were measured during august – september 2007. although high water temperature and the pres- ence of competitor species are also important factors (e.g., inoue et al. 1997, 2009), these variables were not measured in our study, because (i) masu salmon were distributed in downstream reaches, where water temperature was higher, and (ii) japanese charr, the potential competitor of masu salmon in the study area, were rare and masu salmon generally dominate charr (e.g., miyasaka et al. 2003). in each study reach, wetted width was measured along equally spaced transects set at 1–3 m intervals, depending on stream size. each study reach was divided into channel units, classiﬁed as cascade, rif- ﬂe, glide, or pool. the length of each channel unit was measured and the area of each channel unit was estimated as length times mean wetted width. cover is generally considered as any object that conceals ﬁsh from predators or provides shelter from strong current (fausch 1993). in this study, we considered coarse woody debris, brush (often structured by twigs), undercut banks and overhanging vegetation (instream or within 40 cm of the water surface) as cover materials. the length and several widths of each cover material were measured to calculate the occupied area within the wetted channel surface. catchment area above each study reach was mea- sured using a topographical map (1:25000 scale) to represent the longitudinal position and stream size. effects of plantation forestry on masu salmon to examine whether masu salmon abundance was affected by riparian vegetation types, we used regres- sion tree analysis with the chi-square automatic inter- action detection (chaid) algorithm (kass 1980). this analysis is now widely used as a robust tool for ecological modelling that can effectively represent relationships between a single response variable and a set of predictor variables (both continuous and cate- gorical) (brewer et al. 2007; desch^enes et al. 2007). the biomass of masu salmon was used as a response variable, with the riparian vegetation type and four habitat variables (catchment area, mean wetted width, pool area and cover area) as predictor variables. the stopping rules in tree growth were (i) maximum tree depth = 3, and (ii) minimum number of cases in a subgroup = 5. the response variable (biomass) was log10-transformed to reduce the potential inﬂuence of outliers, and the analysis was performed using spss (version 13; spss inc.). results differences among seasons seasonal differences in the abundances of aerial, fall- ing and drifting invertebrates were similar among the three riparian vegetation types (fig. 1). aerial inver- tebrate abundance peaked in august, sharply declined from october and increased from february to april. a similar pattern was found for falling inputs. terres- trial invertebrate contribution to drift were about 40– 60% in early summer and early autumn (may, june, september), but declined to around 20% in winter (february). however, the total weight of drifting invertebrates did not decline in winter, indicating that decreases in terrestrial invertebrates in winter were compensated for by increases in aquatic invertebrates. the seasonal changes in terrestrial invertebrate contri- bution to masu salmon diets were broadly consistent with those in terrestrial prey availability (table 2). terrestrial invertebrates contributed 30–90% to masu salmon diets in early summer and early autumn (>50% in every site in september 2006 and may 2007), and declined to <20% in winter (february) except for b1. the large percentage of terrestrial invertebrates (60.5%) at b1 in winter was due to one large earthworm (oligochaeta) individual, which con- tributed 51.1% to total stomach contents. differences among sites two-way anovas detected signiﬁcant site effects without site 9 month interactions for

differ- ences in both august samples and december 2006, the abundance of falling invertebrates tended to be indicating that 340 higher at the broadleaved sites than at the plantation sites in other months (table 3). the estimation of annual falling inputs indicated that the values in the broadleaved sites (31.3 and 41.1 gm  2 year  1 in b1 and b2) were 2.5–3.3 times higher than those in the

primarily by riparian vegetation type and secondarily by catchment area (fig. 4). salmon biomass was higher in broad- leaved and clear-cut reaches, and lower in plantation reaches, with that in b/p reaches being intermediate. within b/p reaches, in reaches with smaller catchment areas. the biomass was higher discussion previous studies comparing habitat use and diet among salmonids showed that masu salmon is highly specialised for drift-feeding, and that terrestrial inver- tebrates are an important food resource for masu salmon (nakano & kaeriyama 1995; miyasaka et al. 2003; inoue et al. 2009). our data indicated that ter- restrial invertebrates contributed to substantial por- tions of drifting invertebrates (up to more than half) and masu salmon diet (up to more than 80%) in non- winter seasons, supporting the previous ﬁndings. unfortunately, we could not statistically assess effects of riparian forest type on the abundance of aerial, falling and drifting invertebrates because of insufﬁ- cient site replication. however, the among-site com- parisons indicated that the two plantation sites had lower food availability for masu salmon. on an annual basis, input of terrestrial invertebrates at the plantation sites was equivalent to only 30–40% of that at the broadleaved sites, and both of the planta- tion sites had lower drifting invertebrate abundance than the two broadleaved sites. furthermore, the extensive survey of ﬁsh abundance revealed a trend 342 log (biomass 100·m–2) 2.01 ± 0.45 (n = 46) riparian type (f = 6.83, p = 0.016) broadleaved, clear-cut b/p

was consistent with the trend in fall- ing input and drift abundance. these results indicated that streams bordered by conifer stands of plantation received lower terrestrial prey inputs, and this likely resulted in lower salmon abundance.  2 year falling inputs of terrestrial (pasture: edwards & huryn  2 year invertebrates to our streams were greater than those previously recorded. annual inputs of terrestrial prey falling into streams have been reported as <1 gm  1 in new 1996), zealand 5–11 gm  1 in scotland, uk (conifer forest:  1 in hokkaido, northern  2 year bridcut 2000), 9 g m japan (deciduous broadleaved forest: kawaguchi & nakano 2001), and 8–9 gm  2 year  1 in california, usa (mixed conifer and deciduous broadleaved forest: rundio & lindley 2008). our estimates of annual inputs for the plantation sites (12.4 gm  2 year  1 in both) and a clear-cut site (9.3 gm  1 in c1) are  2 year similar to the values in scotland, hokkaido and cali- fornia. however, those in our broadleaved sites (31.3 and 41.1 gm  1) and another clear-cut site (16.1 gm  1 in c1), where the channel was partly shaded by broadleaved canopy, are considerably higher than the previously reported values. because we regarded aerial adults of aquatic invertebrates as terrestrial, our values are overestimation relative to those from hokkaido (kawaguchi & nakano 2001) and california (rundio & lindley 2008). however, even if aerial adults are excluded, our values are still high (28.6, 37.6, 11.5, 11.5, 8.1 and 15.3 gm  2  1 in b1, b2, p1, p2, c1 and c2, respectively; year aerial

broadleaved sites. kawaguchi (1995), which is a rare example of studies conducted in conifer planta- tion streams in japan, produced a similar result. he found that summer daily input rate of falling inverte- brates was 2.5 times higher in a stream ﬂowing through a deciduous broadleaved forest than that through a conifer (japanese cedar) plantation (no. 9 in fig. 5 and appendix s1) in honshu (niigata), central japan. in addition, the value from his broadleaved site was also high relative to previously reported values (250 mgm  1; fig. 5). the among-region vari- ation in terrestrial prey inputs from deciduous broad- leaved forests in japan (fig. 5: no. 7, hokkaido; no. 9, honshu; no. 13, shikoku) may be explained by a latitudinal gradient in terrestrial productivity (uchij- ima & seino 1985). although sampling and measure- ment methods differ among the studies (e.g., pan trap or drift net; dry weight or ash-free dry mass; see appendix s1), the geographical comparisons by fig. 5 suggest that (i) riparian forests in central to southwestern japan have great potential to supply abundant food to stream ﬁshes and (ii) such potential in these regions can be cancelled out when broad- leaved forests are converted to conifer plantations. although lateral input of ground-surface inverte- brates may be important as well (sato et al. 2011), falling input is the main component of prey inputs from outside of the stream (nakano et al. 1999; kawaguchi et al. 2003), and its sources are broadly categorised as either aerial or foliage invertebrates. our malaise samples indicated that the two clear-cut sites had higher abundance of aerial invertebrates, but it contributed less to prey inputs, as no strong corre- lation was found between aerial abundance and fall- ing inputs. in addition, as the data referred above, aerial adults of aquatic invertebrates contributed only 4–12% to total falling inputs on annual basis and <10% in mean daily input rate in august (1.4, 1.3 and 6.8% in broadleaved, plantation and clear-cut sites respectively). therefore, although forest clear- cutting (canopy removal) may increase aerial inverte- brate abundance, such an effect would not be reﬂected in prey inputs to streams. our data suggest that foliage invertebrates in riparian canopy are the major source of falling inputs to streams, and thus, the among-site differences in the abundance of falling inputs are largely attributable to differences in canopy characteristics. higher falling inputs at the broad- leaved sites than at the conifer plantation sites in our study are consistent with previous studies focusing on differences between deciduous (broadleaved) and conifer canopies in alaska (allan et al. 2003) and oregon (romero et al. 2005), north america. they reported that foliage of deciduous broadleaved spe- cies supported greater invertebrate densities than that of conifer species (allan et al. 2003), and the abun- 343 inoue et al. dance of prey inputs to streams was positively corre- lated with the proportion of deciduous canopy cover (romero et al. 2005). positive correlations among falling inputs, drifting invertebrates and masu salmon biomass (figs 2 and 3) illustrate that higher falling inputs from can- opy result in higher food availability, which leads to higher salmon biomass. although these positive cor- relations were not statistically signiﬁcant except one case (falling input and drift in early summer), the results of the extensive survey on masu salmon abun- dance were consistent with the relations described by the correlations. the regression tree analysis, in which several habitat variables (e.g., pool area, cover area) and riparian types were used as potential predic- tors, revealed that masu salmon biomass was explained primarily by riparian types, with the broad- leaved and clear-cut reaches having higher biomass than the plantation reaches. in general, riparian vege- tation affects salmonid abundance mainly through food availability (hawkins et al. 1983; murphy et al. 1986), water temperature (li et al. 1994; inoue et al. 1997), and coarse woody debris that create pool and/ or cover habitat (murphy et al. 1986; inoue & nak- ano 1998; urabe & nakano 1998). high water tem- peratures caused by removal of riparian canopy (timber harvest, agricultural development) sometimes eliminate salmonids (li et al. 1994; inoue et al. 1997), because they are typical coldwater species. such a possible effect of canopy modiﬁcation via water temperature cannot explain our case, because the riparian effect in our study occurred as the lower biomass in the conifer plantation reaches, rather than in the clear-cut reaches. also, the riparian effect in our study was not mediated by coarse woody debris, because the regression tree analysis detected neither pool nor cover area as a predictor variable. consider- ing the data on falling and drifting invertebrates in our six study sites, it is reasonable to explain the lower salmon biomass in the conifer plantation reaches as due to lower food availability there. effects of food availability on salmonid abundance have frequently been detected by comparative studies assessing forestry activities (e.g., hawkins et al. 1983; murphy et al. 1986; nislow & lowe 2006). these studies commonly reported that salmonid abundance was higher in streams ﬂowing through clear-cut sites than in those covered by forest canopy, owing to higher food (benthic invertebrates) avail- ability associated with higher autotrophic production in the former streams. although benthic invertebrate abundance was not quantiﬁed in this study, the gen- eral trend that clear-cut reaches have higher abun- dance of benthic invertebrates than forested reaches has been conﬁrmed in our study area (sugihara & miyake 2011; m. inoue, unpublished). therefore, 344 masu salmon abundance is expected to be higher in the clear-cut reaches than in the broadleaved and plantation reaches, as many previous studies have reported. nevertheless, masu salmon biomass was similar between the clear-cut and broadleaved reaches (fig. 4). this may indicate that, although benthic autotrophic production in the broadleaved reaches is suppressed by light limitation from canopy cover, such a loss is compensated for by the great quantity of falling inputs from broadleaved canopy. overall, our results suggest that deciduous broad- leaved forests provide better food conditions for masu salmon than plantation stands of conifer do. so far, several studies have suggested effects of conifer plantations on stream ecosystems, such as alterations in quality, quantity and seasonal stability of in-stream detritus and taxonomic composition of its consumer assemblages (benthic invertebrates) (murphy & giller 2000; yoshimura 2007; riipinen et al. 2010; hisabae et al. 2011; inoue et al. 2012). these alterations are not necessarily regarded as negative impacts on stream biota. that is, drastic declines due to conifer plantations have generally not been found in the availability of the detrital resource and total inverte- brate abundance. on the other hand, the decrease in terrestrial prey inputs reported here is a negative aspect of conifer plantations for stream biota, espe- cially in headwater streams, where predator popula- tions are strongly supported by terrestrial prey subsidy (nakano & murakami 2001; kawaguchi et al. 2003; baxter et al. 2004). many headwater streams in japan may have been degraded in terms of ﬁsh habitat because of the extensive conversion of broadleaved forests to conifer plantations during the past decades. such a negative effect of conifer planta- tions is possible also in other regions where conifer plantations are prevalent (e.g., northern europe: friberg 1997; riipinen et al. 2010; new zealand: nagashima et al. 2002; quinn et al. 2004). in the case of deforestation (intensive logging, agricultural and urban development), a common con- servation practice to minimise its negative impacts is to retain forest vegetation along streams as riparian buffers (murphy et al. 1986; davies & nelson 1994; quinn et al. 2004; kiffney & richardson 2010), which can be expected to stabilise stream banks, moderate sediment input, maintain low water temper- ature and provide coarse particulate organic matter (takahashi et al. 2003; broadmeadow & nisbet 2004; lee et al. 2004; and references therein). our results suggest that retention of riparian buffers con- sisting of natural broadleaved stands can be an effec- tive management practice to mitigate the negative aspect of conifer plantations. in regions where natural forests have been extensively converted to conifer plantations, forest management that allows and facili- tates recovery of natural riparian stands is important. additional research on functions and effective dimen- sions (width, length) of natural riparian buffers in conifer plantations would contribute to better man- agement of forest and stream ecosystems. acknowledgements we are grateful to sei-ichi shinotou, takuma kawahara, yuhki nakamoto, yuta kudo, yoshifumi sumizaki, yasutaka hida
