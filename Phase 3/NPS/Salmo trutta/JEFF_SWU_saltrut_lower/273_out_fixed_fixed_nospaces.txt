balık et al. 2004; c¸ elik et al. 2005). pikeperch, which is distributed abundantly in freshwater in turkey and has commercial value in both domestic and foreign markets, is a lean freshwa- ter ﬁsh. to our best knowledge, no reports have yet been published about the effects of sexual and seasonal variations on the liver fatty acid composition of pikeperch. the total lipid and lipid fatty acid composition of all ﬁsh species varies according to the season, geograph- ical location of the catch, size, sex and the state of their reproductive cycle (cai & curtis 1990; shirai et al. 2001, 2002; luzia et al. 2003). while the fatty ﬁshes (e.g. salmon, trout and herring) store fats predomin- antly in muscle tissue, the lean ﬁshes deposit their fats in body cavities and perivisceral organs (e.g. liver). therefore, the livers of lean ﬁshes are commonly more fatty than fatty ﬁshes. although the muscle of gadus morhua (cod) contain insigniﬁcantly small amount of fat, the liver is composed of approximately 60–70% of lipid (jangaard et al. 1967; addison et al. 1968). in many spring-spawning ﬁshes, gonads mature during winter when food supplies are limited and feeding is reduced. therefore, nutrients tissue growth have to be drawn from other tissues like muscle and liver. it was reported that females use mainly saturated fatty acids (sfa) for meeting the energy requirement of gonad maturation while males use monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa). however, during vitellogenesis, females can also mobilise stored precursors (e.g. linoleic and linolenic acids) of fatty acids of n-3 and n-6 family for gonad maturation (medford & mackay 1978; cejas et al. 2003). for germinal fish liver oil (particularly cod liver oil) has long been a preferred source of oil for the prevention of vision and growth problems. there is a growing demand for ﬁsh oils for the use in human food and pharmaceuticals. the suitable sources rich in n-3 fatty acids to meet these demands is thus very important (jayasinghe et al. 2003). the determine present the seasonal variations (especially with respect to the gonad maturation, spawning and environmental temperature) fatty acid composition of pikeperch. identiﬁcation study was performed in liver of to lake is 8–10 m. it is a tectonic lake with sand and gravels in shallow places and bedrocks in some places. the lake is mostly fed with spring waters from the lake bottom. in the east shoreline, canes and reed beds are abundantly found, whereas these are rarely seen on other shorelines. the surface is partly covered with ice in winter. in summer, the water temperature reaches up to 30 °c. the lake has an oligotrophic character (campell 1992; becer 1995). pikeperches used in this study were caught using a gill net and transported on ice to the laboratory. the ages were determined from scales after biometric data analyses (i.e. weight and length). all ﬁshes used in the analyses were almost similar in size and ages (over 2 years old), and had also spawned the previous year as determined by gross examination of gonad mor- phology. once standard performed sampling was (1956). lipids were equation: kl ¼ (total liver condition factor (kl) was determined by the following liver weight/total ﬁsh weight) · 100 (jangaard et al. 1967). gonadosomatic index (gsi) values were calculated according to the equation, gsi ¼ (total weight of gonad/total body weight) · 100 (treasurer 1990). every 2 months. the liver from each sex was extracted for analyses by homogenisation in a warring blender for 3 min. a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1) was used as a solvent. total lipid extraction was performed according to the procedure of folch et al. trans-esteriﬁed with bf3methanol (morrison & smith 1964; moss et al. 1974). routine analysis of the methyl esters was carried out on a shimadzu gc 14b model equipped with ﬂame ionisation detector (fid). the chromato- graphic conditions were as follows: injection-port temperature was at 225 °c; detector temperature at 225 °c; initial oven temperature at 135 °c; but rising )1. the carrier gas was to 185 °c at a rate of 3 °c min )1. samples nitrogen, set at a ﬂow rate of 30 ml min were injected into a 2.1 m · 53-mm columns packed with 10% dmcs on chromosorb paw-dmcs (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa). the gas chromatogra- phy (gc) electrometer was connected to a shimadzu cr electronic integrator for automatic quantitative calculations and programmed peak processing. the peaks were identiﬁed by comparing the relative retention time with pure methyl ester peaks (sigma). materials and methods study area lake eg˘irdir (37°50¢–38°57¢n, 30°44¢–30°57¢e) is situated in the lake’s district of turkey. it is the second largest natural freshwater lake in turkey with a surface area varing between 440 and 490 km2 and an altitude of 914 m above sea level. the maximum depth of the the results are reported as means ± sem of 3–15 determinations. the statistical differences were ana- lysed with one-way anova and the duncan post-test. results were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. results the maturation of ovaries began in july and continued rapidly in winter, and was completed in march. from 442 i s g %  male female 6 4 2 0 n a j r a m y a m l u j p e s v o n fig. 1. gonadosomatic index (gsi). gsi values were plotted as means ± sem (n ¼ 15). r o t c a f n o i t i d n o c 2.4 1.8 1.2 0.6 0.0 male condition factor female condition factor male total lipid female total lipid 9 7 5 3 ( % o  f w e t w e g h i t ) t o a t l l i p d i n a j r a m y a m l u j p e s v o n fig. 2. liver condition factor and total liver lipid. liver condition factor was determined as described by jangaard et al.

(20:5n-3), acid the water in this period, the relative proportion of sfa in liver changed seasonally from 45% to 28% and from 42% to 31% in male and female, respectively. the ratio of sfa in fatty acid composition decreased to a minimum in november. temperature (9.8 °c) signiﬁcantly decreases and gonad maturation begins. on the other hand, the concentration of pufa in liver varied seasonally from 32% to 13% and from 28% to 15% in male and female, respectively (table 1). the relative concentration of n-3 polyenes varied seasonally ranging from 19.5% to 5% and from 16% to 6% annually in male and female liver, respectively. the relative proportion of pufa in liver, particularly n-3 fatty acids, diminished signiﬁcantly with the maturation of gonads and increased during dense feeding periods in summer, and reached its maximum level in fall. the monthly proﬁles of mufa were more similar to that of sfa rather than to that of pufa. discussion the amount of lipids in liver was maximum in september and november, which is a dense feeding period. during dense feeding periods (i.e. september and november), both liver condition factor and gsi were signiﬁcantly lower as compared with the level in other months, but were highest in january and march. in light of this evidence, it is thought that the liver condition of pikeperch may be associated with gonad maturation rather than feeding, as it is known that there is a decrease in feeding in january and march. the reason for higher liver condition factor observed in these months may be because of the temporal and speciﬁc expression of factors in liver, which play 443 uysal et al. table 1. seasonal variations in male and female liver fatty acids of pikeperch (per cent of total fatty acids). january march may july september november male female male female male female male female male female male female c12:0 c14:0 c15:0 c16:0 c16:1 c18:0 c18:1 c18:2 n-6 c18:3 n-3 c20:1 c20:2 n-6 c20:4 n-6 c20:5 n-3 c22:6 n-3 p c24:1 p p p p p p other sfa ufa mufa pufa n-3 n-6 0.9 ± 0.8 2.4 ± 0.5 1.4 ± 0.3 0.2 ± 0.1 1.4 ± 0.0 0.5 ± 0.0 4.3 ± 0.2 3.7 ± 0.3 0.3 ± 0.1 3.0 ± 0.7 1.6 ± 0.4 0.1 ± 0.0 2.5 ± 0.3 0.6 ± 0.0 0.7 ± 0.1 1.5 ± 0.4 1.5 ± 0.1 0.3 ± 0.0 3.3 ± 0.2 0.8 ± 0.0 4.9 ± 0.3 3.3 ± 0.5 2.2 ± 0.4 3.0 ± 0.1 4.2 ± 0.4 3.8 ± 0.5 2.6 ± 0.4 4.3 ± 0.1 2.0 ± 0.6 3.7 ± 0.1 2.3 ± 0.5 4.1 ± 0.1 0.1 ± 0.0 2.9 ± 0.1 1.0 ± 0.1 1.3 ± 0.5 3.6 ± 0.3 4.2 ± 0.6 3.7 ± 0.2 0.4 ± 0.1 0.05 ± 0.0 1.1 ± 0.0 3.5 ± 0.0 1.5 ± 0.0 1.8 ± 0.1 0.2 ± 0.0 0.6 ± 0.3 0.03 ± 0.0 0.9 ± 0.1 2.4 ± 0.4 1.6 ± 0.1 0.7 ± 0.0 1.3 ± 0.7 0.6 ± 0.0 29.7 ± 2.8 35.2 ± 1.8 33.5 ± 0.6 36.0 ± 2.5 33.1 ± 0.9 33.0 ± 1.8 32.1 ± 4.2 36.6 ± 3.0 32.4 ± 0.8 21.1 ± 0.6 25.0 ± 2.3 35.6 ± 4.0 2.1 ± 0.2 5.2 ± 0.5 3.1 ± 0.4 3.2 ± 0.3 4.2 ± 0.3 2.6 ± 0.6 25.7 ± 1.0 26.7 ± 3.2 30.2 ± 1.9 30.6 ± 3.1 27.4 ± 2.1 28.5 ± 1.9 26.8 ± 2.8 26.1 ± 1.7 24.0 ± 1.1 17.1 ± 0.7 24.4 ± 1.4 22.3 ± 2.3 1.7 ± 0.8 2.6 ± 0.8 2.0 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 1.3 3.6 ± 0.4 1.1 ± 0.4 3.6 ± 0.0 1.4 ± 1.0 1.2 ± 0.2 1.5 ± 0.0 1.0 ± 0.2 2.4 ± 0.1 1.3 ± 0.1 1.2 ± 0.0 2.2 ± 0.4 1.3 ± 0.5 8.3 ± 0.3 5.6 ± 0.1 4.5 ± 0.0 4.2 ± 0.5 7.9 ± 0.0 4.2 ± 1.2 6.7 ± 0.0 6.2 ± 0.4 5.5 ± 1.4 4.0 ± 0.6 3.9 ± 0.1 7.0 ± 1.8 1.0 ± 0.3 1.9 ± 0.8 1.8 ± 0.6 2.0 ± 1.0 7.5 ± 1.0 7.8 ± 2.6 14.7 ± 1.2 10.1 ± 3.6 7.1 ± 3.0 40.5 ± 3.4 37.4 ± 3.8 43.3 ± 1.0 38.9 ± 0.6 44.9 ± 1.4 40.8 ± 1.0 40.9 ± 2.0 39.3 ± 4.9 44.9 ± 3.1 41.6 ± 0.8 28.3 ± 0.8 31.2 ± 2.9 52.2 ± 6.5 54. 0 ± 2.7 50.4 ± 1.0 53.2 ± 1.0 51.5 ± 1.3 48.2 ± 0.2 50.9 ± 1.0 54.5 ± 2.2 50.8 ± 1.4 50.2 ± 1.8 57.0 ± 1.8 57.7 ± 0.9 30.0 ± 3.7 34.4 ± 0.5 35.9 ± 2.5 34.5 ± 2.0 36.6 ± 3.2 32.8 ± 2.0 38.0 ± 1.2 31.1 ± 1.5 37.4 ± 1.6 27.0 ± 1.8 24.6 ± 0.5 29.8 ± 1.0 19.6 ± 4.1 14.4 ± 2.9 18.6 ± 1.0 14.8 ± 4.0 15.3 ± 2.0 12.9 ± 1.8 23.4 ± 3.8 13.3 ± 1.8 23.1 ± 0.1 32.3 ± 1.5 27.9 ± 0.2 22.2 ± 3.9 4.8 ± 1.1 14.3 ± 0.1 19.5 ± 2.0 15.5 ± 1.1 10.9 ± 2.3 14.6 ± 2.0 7.5 ± 2.4 8.7 ± 0.8 8.4 ± 0.8 8.7 ± 0.7 12.6 ± 0.6 12.3 ± 1.0 2.5 ± 0.0 2.2 ± 0.3 1.4 ± 0.2 1.4 ± 0.0 5.3 ± 0.5 6.9 ± 0.9 4.3 ± 2.0 1.5 ± 0.5 6.0 ± 2.7 0.7 ± 0.4 1.2 ± 0.8 1.7 ± 0.5 1.4 ± 0.7 3.2 ± 0.2 3.0 ± 0.4 3.4 ± 0.1 3.4 ± 1.5 7.8 ± 1.1 2.7 ± 0.2 1.9 ± 0.4 4.8 ± 0.4 2.6 ± 0.5 3.0 ± 0.6 1.3 ± 0.1 1.5 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 0.8 4.2 ± 2.9 0.8 ± 0.4 1.7 ± 0.8 1.0 ± 0.2 0.8 ± 0.2 5.9 ± 1.0 3.1 ± 0.6 2.5 ± 1.1 0.7 ± 0.0 3.4 ± 0.2 2.1 ± 0.1 2.0 ± 0.5 1.3 ± 0.0 1.2 ± 0.1 6.5 ± 0.4 3.1 ± 0.1 3.5 ± 0.4 0.6 ± 0.1 7.1 ± 1.6 2.1 ± 0.2 2.4 ± 0.3 2.0 ± 0.4 1.7 ± 0.4 5.2 ± 0.4 2.2 ± 1.3 1.6 ± 0.7 0.7 ± 0.2 9.9 ± 0.8 0.6 ± 0.4 1.1 ± 0.8 3.2 ± 0.4 0.7 ± 0.3 5.1 ± 1.6 3.5 ± 0.6 3.1 ± 0.8 0.7 ± 0.0 6.1 ± 1.7 2.0 ± 0.3 2.3 ± 0.2 2.3 ± 0.3 1.1 ± 0.2 9.4 ± 0.5 9.2 ± 0.4 7.7 ± 1.9 2.7 ± 0.4 7.9 ± 1.8 6.5 ± 1.2 8.6 ± 0.8 9.9 ± 0.2 7.4 ± 2.4 7.6 ± 1.6 6.2 ± 2.3 9.1 ± 0.2 7.7 ± 0.6 14.5 ± 3.0 5.4 ± 1.1 9.2 ± 0.5 sfa, saturated fatty acids; ufa, unsaturated fatty acids; mufa, monounsaturated fatty acids; pufa, polyunsaturated fatty acids. signiﬁcant roles in gonad maturation (i.e. gametogo- nesis and vitellogenesis). (ackman et al. 1975). among 25–30 fatty acid peaks, we were able to securely identify 15 main fatty acids in pikeperch liver. unidentiﬁed fatty acids were of minor import- ance quantitatively and their ratios changed between seasons from 14% to 3% (in male) and from 10% to 6% (in female). palmitic acid is a major fatty acid (gibson et al. 1984) in ﬁsh and its level was not inﬂuenced by diet in the the relative proportions of sfa and present study, palmitic acid in liver were similar to those previ- ously published results. oleic acid (18:1) was the most abundant monoenes in both sexes. high levels of oleic acid and palmitoloic acid (16:1) have been reported as a characteristic property of ﬁsh oils in freshwater (ackman 1967; osman et al. 2001). in this study, oleic acid level shows the characteristic property of freshwater ﬁsh and palmitolic acid level did not exceed the levels reported in marine ﬁsh. in male liver, several fatty acids (c12:0, c16:0, c18:1, c18:3n-3) were found greatly lower than their levels in female liver in november. the decreases in sfa (c12:0, c16:0) may be a consequence of the sharp drops together with an increase in pufa, may be a physiological adaptation to an extreme cold environment (logue et al. 2000; hall et al. 2002; c¸ elik et al. 2005). on the other hand, based on the previously published data (luzzana et al. 1996), it is assumed that oleic acid (c18:1) and linolenic acid (c18:3n-3) may be in temperatures, which, 444 on decreased preferential utilisation for the testis development as determined by gsi. account the of acid

al. 1993), the results presented here also show that the levels of pufa in male and female sharply increased during the signiﬁcant decreases in (9.8 °c). although the temperature in november january temperature decrease to (6.4 °c), increase accordingly, which was contrary to our expectations. the decrease in the amount of pufa in this period may be because of the signiﬁcant utilisation of pufa and mufa in gonad maturation, which may overwhelm the stimulatory effects of temperature. the inverse relationship between sfa and pufa observed in the dense feeding period may be because of the upregulation of synthesis of pufa rather sfa. in the level of pufa did not continued acknowledgements the work was supported in part by a grant to k. uysal from the university of su¨leyman demirel,
