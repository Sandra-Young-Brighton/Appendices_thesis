france 1995d). as macrophytes were extremely rare, the predomi- nant littoral autochthonous food source was epilithic algae (france 199%). all sampled fish were healthy, robust individuals of limited size ranges for each species so as to negate major ontogenic diet in- fluences on isotope ratios. samples were frozen, abdominal muscles re- moved and ground, followed by their isotopic mea- surement on a europa tracermass mass spectrome- ter interfaced with a roboprep-cn analyzer as in cabana & rasmussen (1 994) and france (1 995c, e). values reported are means of 2-3 replicates with an average sd of f0.3%0 for standards corrected for sample weight-related drift as in hall (1995) using programs developed by g. cabana (department of biology, mcgill university). as there were no sig- nificant differences (anova, b0.05) in isotope ra- tios for the same species among the four study lakes, they were combined to examine for general trends as in france (1995e). because fish integrate isotope signatures through time (cabana & rasmus- sen in press), there were no seasonal effects ob- served in the present data. in total, 91 individual fish were analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen iso- topes. results and discussion littoral dwelling fish in the study lakes exhibited a considerable range in 613c from -32 to -21%0 (fig. 1: “study 12”), with differences among indi- vidual species being apparent (fig. 2). sixty per- cent of all 613c signatures for fish were within the range -29 to -26%0 and therefore synonymous with those for riparian vegetation in this region (france 19950. these values for fish were also distinct from s13c ranges recorded in the study lakes (france 199%) for both planktonic particu- late organic matter (pom) (range of -35 to -29%0; mean = -32%0) and benthic epilithon (range of -21 to -15%0; mean = -17%0). two possibilities exist to explain food prove- nance for lentic fish with 613c signatures between -29 and -26%0; these organisms are: (a) relying 79 france sculpins dace sticklebacks suckers shiners tadpoles i -30 -28 -28 -22 -20 carbon isotope ratio -24 fig. 2. box and whisker plots (loth, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th per- centiles and outliers shown, means indicated by dashed vertical lines) of stable carbon isotope ratios (6i3c) for five fishes and tadpoles within four oligotrophic canadian shield lakes located in northwestern ontario. predominantly upon allochthonous detritus; or (b) dependent upon some mixture of autochthonous planktonic and benthic algae with no contribution from terrestrial sources. although ‘b’ seems un- likely due to the general rarity of pelagic-littoral food web coupling in lakes (france 1995c), it still remains impossible to definitively identify food provenance from more than two potential sources with use of only a single isotope. because of this, consumers in the present study lakes were also an- alyzed for their stable nitro en isotope ratios. due to the progressive ‘&-enrichment for (non- n,-fixing) autotrophs from terrestrial to freshwater to marine environments (france 1995g), nitrogen isotope ratios (15n/14n expressed as 615n) reflect food source variability in complex ecotones such as estuaries and coastal rivers (kline et al. 1990; france 1994, 1995h). therefore, because consumers of terrestrial plants should on average be character- ized by 615n about 3%0 lower than those for con- sumers of freshwater plants, nitrogen isotope analy- sis has the potential to aid in measuring the incorpo- ration of terrestrial detritus into freshwater food webs as well (france 1995g). in other words, if the carbon isotopic variability of consumers is due solely to the differential assimilation of varying amounts of planktonic and benthic algae, then their 615n signatures should remain constant across the range in s13c. if, however, those consumers with s13c signatures between -29 and -26%0 are actually relying upon terrestrial plants for sustenance, then their 615n signatures should be accordingly lower than those for consumers that are dependent on au- 80 tochthonous algae (i.e. those having 613c signatures either below -29%0 or above -26%0). in the present study lakes, 615n values for plank- tonic pom and benthic algae were found to range from 1 to 5%0 (mean=3%0, n=10), whereas decom- posing terrestrial leaves and wood collected from littoral zones ranged in 615n from -3 to 2%0 (mean=o%o, n=l2) (fig. 3). these values are similar to those documented by meili et al. (1993) for a small boreal lake in sweden, and are within the ranges found for other worldwide data (france 1995g). the lower 6i5n signatures for white suckers hav- ing si3c values close to -27%0 (the average for ter- restrial plant litter - france 1995b, 1996) indicates that these individuals are relying upon riparian de- tritus for some of their energy sustenance, not planktonic terrest. mixture

circled ‘3’ and ‘4’=assumed for secondary and ter- tiary consumers based on a trophic ”n-enrichment of 3%0 from the literature) for diets dependent on autochthonous algae (ei- ther planktonic or benthic), allochthonous detritus (note sup- pression of trophic categories here), and mixed food sources (angled gradients) as described in the test. merely upon some mixture of various algal sources (fig. 3). tadpoles (rana clarnitans), which are strict herbivores in canadian shield lakes (france et al. 1991), were also found to display the same positive relationship between carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios as observed for white suckers, indicating that intraspecific variability in 615n for these two littoral species in the study lakes is due mainly to differ- ences in food provenance rather than trophic posi- tion. decreases in 6i5n for other fishes with 6i3c values close to -27%0 is suggestive but nowhere near as strong as that shown for white suckers and tadpoles, due p h a p s to the more limited ranges displayed in 6' c. periphyton is known to be composed of both al- gae and detritus, each of which displays a different isotopic signature (hamilton & lewis 1992). in the present study, increased 615n values for animals in conjunction with 13c-enrichment above -27%0 im- plies, therefore, a proportionally greater assimilative contribution of benthic algae to diets. additionally, increased 615n values for fishes having 613c signa- tures depleted below -27%0 suggests some incorpo- ration of planktonic pom. this is particularly evi- dent for the two planktivorous suckers with 613c values of about -3 1%0, indicating that these individ- uals are ontogenically still part of the pelagic food web in the study lakes (cf. france 1995c, e) before their subsequent shift to a true benthic diet (scott & crossman 1973). the recent publication by hecky & hesslein (1995) of stable isotope data for biota inhabiting three limnologically similar and proximal canadian shield lakes offers an ideal opportunity in which to examine the generality of the present results. due to increased boundary layer diffusion resistance, epilithon 613c was determined by hecky & hesslein (1995) to be -18fl%0, identical to values found in the present study lakes (france 199%). pelagic zooplankton 613c in hecky & hesslein's lakes averaged -32%0, similar to values of -35%0 determined for the present study lakes (del giorgio and france 1996). because macrophytes and epi- phytic algae are also rare in hecky & hesslein's lakes, littoral 613c values reflect differential use of epilithon and terrestrial detritus as in the present study lakes. carbon isotope ratios in hecky & hesslein's lakes for dace (-26*2%0, compared to - 27f2%0 in my study lakes), burbot (lotu zota: - 25+1%0) and walleye (stizotedion vitreum: - 25fl%o) suggest a preferential assimilation of ter- restrial detritus over epilithic algae, whereas those values for white suckers (-23-t.3%0, com- pared with -25f4%0 in my study lakes) suggests an approximately equal assimilation of both potential food sources. terrestrial food dependence of littoral fishes although the average 615n values for dace (6%0) and suckers (7%0) did not differ between hecky & hesslein's lakes and the present study lakes, there was little indication of any systematic variation in 6i5n in hecky & hesslein's data that could be re- lated to differential use of alternate carbon sources. this is no doubt a reflection of the fact that their s15n values for epilithon (l%o) were lower than those in the present study lakes (3%0). secondary-analysis of literature data (france 19958) indicated that whereas 6i5n differences be- tween terrestrial plants and freshwater algae were more predictable than those for 613c, they were also more likely to be less distinct (i.e., no differences were found for half the comparisons between the two food sources for 6i5n compared to no differ- ences observed for less than a third of the compari- sons between the two food sources for 6i3c). al- though there is an extensive literature on the envi- ronmental determinants of 613c variability in aquatic autotrophs, with the exception of nitrogen- fixation, essentially nothing is known about what regulates 6i5n in these organisms. until we obtain such information, therefore, the use of 615n analysis as an aid for measuring allochthonoy to freshwaters may be problematic, even with respect to the same species in two groups of very similar lakes, or to similar species within the same lakes. this study provides the first isotopic evidence demonstrating the incorporation of terrestrial detri- tus by freshwater fishes inhabiting permanent lakes. the littoral zones of canadian shield lakes, there- fore, rather than being completely uncoupled from their surrounding riparian forests in terms of carbon flow as some forestry managers would like to be- lieve (ontario ministry of natural resources 1988), are instead integrated components in a dynamic ter- restrial-aquatic continuum. consequently, alter- ations in the quantity of allochthonous detrital in- puts, as for example occurs following riparian clearcutting (france & peters 1995), may be an im- portant environmental concern for boreal fisheries ecology and management. as a result, forestry man- agers may have to move toward a requirement for forested buffer strips around all lakes. resumen 1. como resultado de 10s efectos de la turbulencia del agua so- bre la resistencia de difusidn y la discriminaci6n isot6pica del carbono, 10s valores

energia. como consecuencia, las zonas litorales de 10s lagos boreales canadienses no e s t h aisladas de 10s bosques ribereiios en ttrminos del flujo de carbono, como errdneamente asumen las directrices de las explotaciones madereras actuales, sino que, por el contrario, muestran un grado medible de interrela- ci6n tierra-agua. 4. como consecuencia de ello, la tala de 10s bosques-galeria en las riberas de 10s lagos, permitida por la ley en la mayoria de las provincias canadienses en las que hay bosques boreales, deben’a ser seriamente reconsiderada como estrategia de explotaci6n
