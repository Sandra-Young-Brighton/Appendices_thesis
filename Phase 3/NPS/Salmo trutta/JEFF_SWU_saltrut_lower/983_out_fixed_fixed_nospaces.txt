restricted movement; mark–recapture; passive integrated transponders; fishmove package; cottus carolinae introduction movement of fishes across aquatic landscapes is criti- cal for population regulation, community structuring and ecosystem functioning (taylor et al. 1993; radinger & wolter 2014). concepts from early fish movement studies (gerking 1953; funk 1955) are now framed within broader landscape contexts to pre- dict fish movement among spawning, refuge and feeding habitats (schlosser 1991). on fine scales (101–102 m), fishes move to the most suitable habitat to ensure optimum growth and survival (hill & grossman 1993; gowan & fausch 2002). at broader scales (103–105 m), fishes move to access spawning habitats, disperse between populations, colonise or recolonise unoccupied habitats, and move to new habitats based on life-history requirements (wine- miller & jepsen 1998; jackson et al. 2001). however, the mechanistic underpinnings that drive movements and the spatiotemporal scales at which fishes move remain largely unknown for most species despite the implications these processes hold for conservation correspondence: j. s. perkin, department of biology, tennessee technological university, box 5063, 1100 n. dixie avenue, cookeville, tn 38505, usa. e-mail: jperkin@tntech.edu 280 doi: 10.1111/eff.12274 and management of stream fish diversity (fausch et al. 2002; cooke et al. 2012). established theoretical guidelines for the ecology of fish movement in freshwater environments sug- gest stationary and mobile components exist within populations. the theory of restricted movement, also called the restricted movement paradigm (rmp, gowan et al. 1994), posits that mature stream fishes are stationary and spend most of their lives in 20– 50 m reaches of stream (gerking 1953, 1959). this paradigm has been applied to characterise move- ments of fishes, although it is not applicable to all fishes (penczak 2006). for example, 12–33% of individuals across four species in an ouachita high- land stream were captured outside of habitats in which they were marked (smithson & johnston 1999), challenging the notion that fishes remain entirely stationary. one of the first studies to for- mally challenge the rmp used resident salmonids as an example to suggest designs of studies supporting the rmp involved bias against detection of move- ments outside of focal habitats (gowan et al. 1994). more contemporary adjustments to the rmp suggest movements out of focal habitats (displacement) can be short or restricted but still sufficient to cause turnover (replacement of marked fishes by unmarked fishes; rodrıguez 2002). turnover is driven by sta- tionary and mobile contingents within populations (rodrıguez 2002) and is best predicted by leptokur- tic dispersal models that capture the diffusive spread of ‘fast fish’ and ‘slow fish’ across aquatic land- scapes (skalski & gilliam 2000). heterogeneous models such as leptokurtic dispersal models differ from normal distributions because of higher peaks associated with large numbers of stationary fish and longer tails associated with small numbers of mobile fish dispersing longer distances (skalski & gilliam 2000). in a review of 62 species of fish, radinger & wolter (2014) found that leptokurtic dispersal mod- els best-estimated fish movement regardless of movement distance and that the stationary compo- nent (66% of individuals) was larger than the mobile component individuals). this unifying theme of fish movement was recently developed into a modelling tool useful for predicting fish move- ments based on known swimming-related morphol- ogy, stream size and timescales (radinger et al. 2014; radinger & wolter 2015). these theoretical advances and newly developed modelling frame- works fill a gap in research related to stream fish movement by allowing for the estimation of disper- sal for unstudied fishes. however, validation of these models is currently lacking for benthic stream fishes whose movements have generally not been studied (petty & grossman 2004; hudy & shiflet 2009; day et al. 2016). (34% of march of the sculpin within the habitat guild of benthic stream fishes, movement of species within the genus cottus has received increased attention in recent years. move- ment patterns of mottled sculpin cottus bairdii are most widely studied among freshwater sculpins with studies tracking movements in streams in montana (mccleave 1964; brown & downhower 1982), north carolina (hill & grossman 1987; petty & grossman 2004) and michigan (breen et al. 2009; deboer et al. 2015). these studies collectively show stationary and mobile components exist within populations dis- tributed across a broad geographic range and across a gradient of streams ranging from first to fourth order (strahler 1957; hudy & shiflet 2009). movement by banded sculpin cottus carolinae is undocumented beyond a single study suggesting members of the species reside within a 6 m stream reach during their lifetime (greenberg & holtzman 1987). current knowledge of banded sculpin movement is reflective fish movements when of early understanding of ‘restricted movement’ was first coined (gerking 1953, 1959), and it stands to reason that a mobile component might exist in addition to the already- documented stationary component reported by green- berg & holtzman (1987). furthermore, it remains unclear whether cottus fishes are capable of switch- ing between stationary and mobile behaviour within short time periods or within a single season (petty & grossman 2004). switching of dispersal behaviour has strong implications for population regulation and responses by fish to environmental alterations (crook 2004) and might be addressed by applying passive integrated transponder (pit) technology to monitor individual fish dispersal histories (roussel et al. 2000; ruetz et al. 2006). and test the goal of this study was to measure short-term dispersal of banded sculpin in little creek, ten- nessee, to assess the applicability of recently devel- oped predictive dispersal models for temporal variability in movement. specific objectives included the following: (i) assess the validity of mor- phology-based predictive dispersal models; (ii) mea- sure temporal variability in sculpin movement within a single season and relate movement to fish size, stream discharge and water temperature; and (iii) test for switching behaviour in which individual sculpin transition between stationary and mobile movement. we hypothesised that banded sculpin movement would conform to a leptokurtic dispersal model char- acterised by ~66% of individuals remaining station- ary and ~34% of individuals expressing mobility (radinger & wolter 2014). we also hypothesised that temporal variation in sculpin movement would result in switching between stationary and mobile movement behaviours for individual fish (petty & grossman 2004; deboer et al. 2015). 281 wells et al.

(2006), including using an insertion site into the body cavity just off the midventral line of the body, inserting the needle point into the peritoneal cavity at a 45-degree angle, and then aligned the nee- dle parallel with the body as the tag was deployed. tag numbers were then recorded using a handheld pit reader (model rs601-3; biomark) and fish were returned to a bucket filled with stream water at the original capture location. fish were observed for a minimum of 2 h to ensure survival before each indi- vidual was scanned again to evaluate pit tag reten- tion and released at the original capture site. recapture procedure we searched the entire 600 m segment of stream twice per week between april 4 and may 16 (46 days total). on each recapture occasion, scanning was initiated at the downstream boundary and pro- gressed towards the upstream boundary. a multidi- rectional antenna (biomark) mounted on a 3-m telescopic pole was used for bank-to-bank scanning keeping the antenna in contact with the water surface in shallow areas (<30 cm depth) and within 30 cm of the benthos in deep areas (>30 cm depth) following the methods of breen et al. (2009), black et al. (2010) and deboer et al. (2015). the antenna was connected to a tuning box and a portable reader (model no. fs2001f-iso; biomark) that matched the readers employed to track mottled sculpin by breen et al. (2009) and deboer et al. (2015). upon detec- tion, the id number from each pit tag was recorded along with gps coordinates using the trimble geoexplorer 6000. we visually checked for the pres- ence of tagged sculpin and noted when fish flushed because of our tracking activities, but fish were other- wise undisturbed (breen et al. 2009). we repeated recapture searches every saturday (4 april through 16 may) and tuesday (7 april through 12 may) for 46 days to match the temporal extent used to mea- sure short-term dispersal of mottled sculpin in north carolina (45 days; petty & grossman 2004) and michigan (43–53 days; breen et al. 2009). at the completion of the study on 16 may, we conducted an extended search (see fig. 1) for tagged fishes outside of the core and buffer reaches to document maximum displacement and noted any shed tags, which were removed from our analyses. we conducted two experiments to assess the effi- cacy of tagging equipment and observers in detecting march of the sculpin tagged fish. first, we injected 10 pit tags oriented longitudinally in fish-shaped agarose gels to simulate being implanted within a fish and then hid the gels in a 50 m reach of little creek. without knowledge of tag locations, five independent observers scanned the 50 m reach using the sweeping protocol described above and the number of tags successfully detected was recorded to estimate detection probability. sec- ond, without knowledge of the observers operating the scanner, a decoy tag was placed in a whirl- pak (nasco, fort atkinson, wi, usa) weighted down by a rock and hidden in the stream during all recapture occasions. the proportion of times this decoy tag was successfully detected was used as a secondary measure of detection efficiency. movement analyses to ensure submetre accuracy for we analysed movement for banded sculpin recap- tured at least three times during our tracking study. coordinates for each sculpin position were differen- tially corrected as described in detail by breen et al. (2009) recorded locations. we used program gps pathfinder office (trimble navigation limited) to import coordinates from the handheld trimble unit, computed differen- tial corrections using base station data archived by the tennessee department of transportation district 24 station (8 km from study site) and then exported corrected coordinates to arcmap 10.2 (environmen- tal system research institute, inc., redlands, ca, usa). we then used arcmap 10.2 to calculate the longitudinal distance (m) between recapture events and the original tagging position for each fish on each recapture occasion using the centreline of the stream to estimate dispersal distance (breen et al. 2009). from these data, we constructed frequency histograms (bin width = 10 m) of signed movement distances in which upstream movement was given a positive sign and downstream movement was given a negative sign (petty & grossman 2004). we tested normality and kurtosis of each distribution using d’agostino’s for normality and anscombe- glynn’s test of kurtosis (petty & grossman 2004; hudy & shiflet 2009). we tested for directionality bias by comparing upstream and downstream move- ment distances using chi-square tests (skalski & gil- liam 2000; hudy & shiflet 2009). test our first objective was to test the efficacy of pre- dictive dispersal models based on fish morphology, stream size and time. radinger & wolter (2014) used multiple regression to develop parameters for fitting leptokurtic dispersal kernels based on fish total length (mm), caudal fin aspect ratio (sambilay 1990), stream order (strahler 1957) and time (days) between obser- vations. this modelling framework was recently 283 wells et al. developed in the fishmove package for program r (radinger et al. 2014). we used the fishmove pack- age to construct leptokurtic dispersal models specific to each recapture occasion to assess temporal vari- ability in dispersal predictions using the equation: fðxþ ¼ p  stat þ ð1   pþ  e ðx lþ2 2r2 p 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2pr2 stat 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2pr2 mob  p ðx lþ2 2r2 mob  e (2014), length equal including total where p is equal to the share of the stationary compo- nent of the total population, rstat is equal to the mean movement distance of the stationary component of the population, and rmob is equal to the mean move- ment distance of the mobile component of the popu- lation. we parameterised the underlying multiple regression models used to fit leptokurtic dispersal kernels in fishmove with the median value for all spe- cies in the genus cottus as reviewed by radinger & wolter to 74 mm, caudal fin aspect ratio equal to 1.18, stream order equal to 2 and time interval equal to each of our recapture occasions (days = 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, 32, 35, 39, 42 and 46). dispersal models for each recapture occasion were weighted by total num- ber of fish observed during that tracking session to generate the expected number of fish at each distance away from the tagging location. expected frequency distributions were compared to observed frequency distributions calculated from data collected during each recapture occasion using the site of tagging as the origin of dispersal. we used kolmogorov–smir- nov (ks) tests to assess model fit by comparing the observed number of fish during each recapture occa- sion to the number of fish expected according to lep- tokurtic dispersal kernels (petty & grossman 2004). our second objective was to assess variability of the banded stationary and mobile components of sculpin population in little creek. we used the fish- move.estimate function from the fishmove package in program r to generate estimates (and 95% confi- dence intervals) of proportion of stationary fishes (p), average distance moved by stationary fish (rstat) and average distance moved by mobile fish (rmob) based on data obtained from our 13 recapture occasions. we first compared temporal variation in these param- eters estimated using our field data to the median and for p (median = 0.68, 95% confidence intervals ci = 0.07), rstat (3.86, 3.24) and rmob (55.59, 24.72) for all cottus species reviewed in radinger & wolter (2014). we considered differences significant if con- fidence intervals did not overlap. next, we tested for a relationship between flow pulses and water temper- ature (predictor variables) and fish movement (rmob; 284 response variable). as movement by the mobile com- ponent is modelled as constant diffusive spread through time (skalski & gilliam 2000; rodrıguez 2002), we used residual values estimated from the linear relationship between time and rmob to estimate higher than average movement (positive residual val- ues), lower than average movement (negative residual values) and average movement (residual value = 0) for each recapture occasion. we then tested for the effect of flow pulses and temperature increases on movement by regressing residual values (response variable) against maximum flow pulse (m3s  1) and maximum water temperature (°c) for each recapture occasion. finally, to facilitate comparison with previ- ous cottus movement studies, we tested for a linear relationship between fish size (tl, mm) and maxi- mum as well as median displacement distances (m) to evaluate size-specific movement following the methods of breen et al. (2009). our third objective was to determine occurrence and extent of switching between stationary and mobile dispersal behaviours by individual fish. we constructed a frequency histogram of the number of times individual recaptured fish switched between being classified as stationary (s, recapture distance ≤rstat from tagging location for a recapture occasion) and mobile (m, recapture distance >rstat distance from tagging location) between subsequent recaptures while ignoring nondetections. for example, a fish with dispersal history ‘sss0mssssssss’ across the 13 recapture occasions switched between stationary and mobile two times with nondetection during recapture occasion four. estimates from fishmove.esti- mate were used to assign individual fish to stationary or mobile components for each recapture occasion. we repeated this process for all individuals retained for movement analysis to construct a frequency distri- bution of the number of switches observed during tracking. we analysed this distribution using d’agos- tino’s test for normality (petty & grossman 2004) and anscombe-glynn’s test of kurtosis (hudy & shiflet 2009). all statistical analyses were conducted in program r version 3.1.2 (r development core team 2015). results we tagged 79 banded sculpin throughout the core reaches on 31 march 2015. tagged fish ranged 71– length and weighed 4.8–32.5 g. 137 mm total seventy-one fish were recaptured at least once, 51 of which were recaptured ≥3 times and were retained for movement analysis. six shed tags were recovered from the stream and were excluded from analysis. detection of tags during two detection probability experiments was high, including on average 94% march of the sculpin table 1. estimates of normality (skewness), kurtosis and upstream versus downstream bias in movement by banded sculpin tracked in little creek, tn, during 4 april through 16 may 2015. day 4 7 11 14 18 21 25 28 32 35 39 42 46 n 34 37 30 32 43 28 32 31 28 25 20 18 12 detection se skewness p-value kurtosis p-value # us # ds chi-square 0.67 0.73 0.59 0.63 0.84 0.55 0.63 0.61 0.55 0.49 0.39 0.35 0.24 0.07 0.06 0.07 0.07 0.05 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.06 4.41 4.60 4.59 4.98 4.24 4.33 4.09 4.33 3.89 3.92 3.57 3.03 2.25 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 21.49 23.70 22.64 27.41 20.41 22.47 21.17 23.09 20.32 18.47 15.83 12.01 6.90 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 20 17 15 13 27 16 18 21 19 16 12 11 8 1 6 3 3 5 3 4 4 5 3 3 3 2 108.95 126.79 200.00 201.00 136.87 127.35 203.00 184.81 180.22 177.69 172.24 167.26 198.00 df 4 7 7 5 17 11 11 11 11 10 8 7 11 p-value <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 the number of fish recaptured (n), proportion of tagged fish detected and the number of fish moving at least 1 m upstream (# us) and 1 m downstream (# ds) are given.

(range 80–100%) for the experiment with hidden tags and 100% detection of the decoy tag during recapture occasions. despite high detection capability, the pro- portion of the 51 tagged fish detected during each recapture ranged 0.24–0.73 and generally declined with time (table 1). distances moved were not normally distributed and fit a leptokurtic pattern. movement frequency distributions were positively skewed (tail towards upstream) during all recapture occasions (skewness >2.0, p < 0.01 for all dates) but generally became less skewed with time (table 1). all frequency distri- butions were characterised by significant leptokurto- sis (kurtosis >6.9, p < 0.01 for all dates) and a greater number of fish dispersed upstream compared to downstream (v2 > 108, p < 0.01 for all dates). leptokurtic dispersal kernels correctly characterised frequency histograms of signed dispersal distances for all but one recapture occasion (fig. 2). the pre- dicted leptokurtic dispersal kernel for day 18 differed (d = 0.52, p < 0.01) from the observed fish distribu- tions when 27 of the 43 recaptured fish moved upstream, eight of which moved greater distances than expected. fish size (tl) predicted neither med- ian (f1,50 = 0.58, p = 0.45, r2 = 0.01) nor maxi- (f1,50 = 0.13, r2 < 0.01) mum displacement distances. p = 0.71, banded sculpin movement was temporally dynamic. the proportion of stationary fish (p) was not static through time and differed (i.e. nonoverlap- ping confidence intervals) from expected for five of the 13 recapture occasions (fig. 3a). departures from the static, expected value of p increased with time so that p was consistently less than expected during the latter portion of the study. the decrease in p was associated with an increase in rmob calculated with- out regard to upstream or downstream directionality precipitation events caused elevated stream flows and punctuated high pulse events on three occasions, including 5 april, 11 april and 17 april (fig. 4a). precipitation events generally caused short-term (<3 days) declines in water temperature until a dry period with no precipitation and subsequent declining flows caused increased water temperatures between 2 may and 16 may. linear regression fitted to the rela- tionship between time and rmob illustrated variability in movement among recapture occasions expressed as positive, negative and near-zero residual values (fig. 4b). residual values were not related to maxi- mum temperature values (f1,11 = 0.93, p = 0.36, r2 = 0.08) but were positively correlated with maxi- mum flow pulse magnitude (f1,11 = 7.49, p = 0.02, r2 = 0.40) measured during each recapture occasion so that the largest residual value for movement corre- sponded with the recorded flow pulse (fig. 4c). the relationship between movement residu- als and flow pulse magnitude was driven by the sin- gle large pulse so that the test was not significant (f1,10 = 0.6, p = 0.45, r2 = 0.06) when the recap- ture occasion with the large pulse (occasion 5) was removed. banded switching between stationary and mobile movements by some individuals. twenty-three (45%) fish were classified as only stationary or

dis- tribution of switching behaviour was skewed (skew- ness = 1.40, z = 3.68, p < 0.01) and was leptokurtic (kurtosis = 4.39, z = 1.98, p = 0.02). discussion leptokurtic, our study empirically showed short-term movement of banded sculpin was temporally dynamic, and included stationary and mobile compo- nents between which some individuals switched. each of these processes operated at spatial scales broader than expected based on historical accounts of the species residing within 6 m of stream (greenberg & holtzman 1987). we also found that a large flow pulse stimulated increased dispersal so that a lep- tokurtic dispersal kernel did not accurately predict fish movement immediately (within 2 days) follow- ing the pulse, but movement again matched a lep- recapture occasion. tokurtic pattern by the next movement was also heterogeneous at the scale of 286 individuals. the majority of fish switched between mobile and stationary movement behaviours and the overall pattern of switching was leptokurtic and char- acterised by many fish switching few times and few fish switching many times. despite heterogeneity in movement at the population and individual scales, diffusive spread of banded sculpin occurred during our study (skalski & gilliam 2000) as predicted by leptokurtic dispersal models (radinger & wolter 2014). movement by banded sculpin during our study matched patterns documented for multiple cottus species, including upstream-biased movements oper- ating on broader-than-expected scales. although our study was conducted over a relatively short temporal extent, we detected movement distances greater than those reported for most cottus fishes reviewed by hudy & shiflet (2009). similarly, our findings reflect recent documentation of minimally restricted move- ment by mottled sculpin (breen et al. 2009) and upstream-biased movement of potomac sculpin cot- tus girardi (hudy & shiflet 2009). in our study, march of the sculpin of our study and our study reach was too small given what we now know about banded sculpin movement. during design of our study, we assessed what was known for banded sculpin and found they were known to use only 6 m of stream (greenberg & holtzman 1987). although we designed our study to capture the maximum expected movement of such a restricted species (albanese et al. 2003), dispersal was greater than expected most likely because the previously reported value (i.e. 6 m; greenberg & holtzman 1987) only captured the stationary compo- nent (i.e. up to 6 m in this study). in fact, we know our estimates of p and rmob were conservative based on documentation of fish exiting the buffer reaches during the extended search conducted as a part of our final recapture occasion. additionally, there was an incidental recapture (and release) of an individual 518 m downstream on 17 april during unrelated research in little creek (a. gebhard, unpublished data). thus, our findings support conclusions by gowan et al. (1994) and rodrıguez (2002) in that even well-planned movement studies can underesti- mate movement by highly mobile fishes, which can ultimately inhibit conservation of stream fishes (cooke et al. 2012). research is needed to document we found some evidence that banded sculpin movement was related to stream flow variability. the largest shifts in p and rmob corresponded exactly with the recapture occasion that followed the largest flow pulse observed during our study. after the pulse, the mean proportion of stationary fish declined from >0.8 to <0.5 and rmob increased from 50 m to 125 m over the course of 2 days, and to our knowl- edge, no other major change to the stream occurred during this period. although this pattern is sugges- tive, our correlative observation is based on a single large pulse. previous studies have challenged the notion that flow pulses affect sculpin movement or density (anderson 1985; hudy & shiflet 2009) and additional fish responses to flow pulses. in terms of low flow, our study captured the transition from flows regularly sustained by precipitation to a period of zero rainfall and low discharge. across this strong hydrologic gra- dient, diffusive spread of banded sculpin continued uninterrupted. this observation is consistent with conclusions by grossman et al. (2010), who hypothe- sised that fish disperse upstream during low flow periods when the ‘hydrodynamic barrier’ is weakest. our study area is free of perched road culverts that act as small waterfalls to block fish dispersal (perkin & gido 2012), so banded sculpin upstream dispersal was possible even during periods of reduced stream flow. smaller, headwater the unnamed first-order tributaries at the upstream extent of our study area are sensitive to local extirpations streams such as 287 fig. 3. estimates of means (95% confidence interval) for (a) the shared proportion of stationary (p), (b) the mean movement distance of mobile (rmob) and (c) mean movement distance of sta- tionary (rstat) banded sculpin for 13 recapture occasions. solid lines and shaded areas represent median and 95% confidence intervals, respectively, reported for all cottus species by radinger & wolter (2014). departures from expected values of p and rmob were at least partially due to the limited temporal and spa- tial extent of our investigation. our study closely matched the time periods employed by petty & grossman (2004) and breen et al. (2009) to measure within-season movement of congeneric fishes, but we did not measure movement at an annual timescale. this is, in part, because the number of fishes detected within the study area was greatly reduced by the end wells et al. fig. 5. frequency of switching between mobile and stationary movement behaviours for banded sculpin tracked on 13 recapture occasions during april and may 2015 in little creek, tn. the frequency of switching was positively skewed and leptokurtic. 288 fig. 4.

(schlosser hypothesise 1987). we caused by natural disturbances and thus require con- tinued colonisation from downstream source popula- tions that consistent, upstream marching by banded sculpin as well as other cottus species (breen et al. 2009; hudy & shiflet 2009) is a mechanism for sustaining head- water populations through the meta-population frame- work (levins 1969). banded sculpin movement behaviour varied at the scale of individuals, including switching between sta- tionary and mobile dispersals by more than 50% of individuals. we found 23 fish did not switch, and the remaining 28 were partitioned among one, two, three, four, five and seven switches. this pattern resulted in a skewed, leptokurtic distribution of switches by banded sculpin. sculpin switching behaviour was sug- gested for mottled sculpin by petty & grossman (2004) and observed for bullhead cottus gobio by knaepkens et al. (2005). nonuniform switching beha- viour implies there are intrinsic and/or extrinsic mech- anisms involved with dispersal decisions. one potential extrinsic mechanism involves changes in habitat volume with flow variability and associated changes interactions among in density-dependent banded sculpin (downhower et al. 1990; koczaja et al. 2005). intrinsic mechanisms affecting move- ment behaviour are less obvious. spawning of banded sculpin is largely unstudied but presumed to occur from january to february (williams & robins 1970) and possibly into early april (smith 1979). if spawn- ing in little creek continued into april, then our study captured the end of the spawning season when males might have been switching from stationary behaviours while guarding young to mobile beha- viours as nests were abandoned (e.g. knaepkens et al. 2005). we attempted to assign sex to fish recaptured at the completion of our study, but only six fish were successfully captured and gonads were not well devel- oped, thus precluding rigorous statistical analysis. these questions could be answered by further research connecting switching to individual sexes dur- ing a known spawning period. on-going work in lit- tle creek (a. gebhard, unpublished data) will define sexual dimorphism (useful for assigning sex to tracked fish) and reproductive life-history traits (use- ful for defining spawning season) that will allow future reproduction-based movement hypotheses. regardless, our findings advance evolu- tion of the rmp (gowan et al. 1994) by revealing that not only do populations consist of mobile and seden- tary components (skalski & gilliam 2000; rodrıguez 2002), but that fishes apparently switch between these behaviours multiple times during their lifetime. testing of if viewed individually, none of our study provided a brief trajectory of movement characteristics for banded sculpin. despite the short- term extent of our investigation, banded sculpin moved further than expected (greenberg & holtzman 1987), movement followed an increasingly unifying theme in fish movement (i.e. leptokurtosis, radinger & wolter 2014), the population responded to a large flow pulse that stimulated movement and individuals frequently switched between stationary and mobile behaviour. these properties would have revealed the emergent property discovered by a collective view: constant upstream movement expressed as diffusive spread across space and through time (skalski & gilliam 2000). this emergent property represents an apparent paradox, in which upstream movement continues despite individ- ual- and population-scale temporal heterogeneity in movement. we suggest this paradox represents the march of the sculpin, in which constant arrival of individuals at headwater streams mediates density- dependent ecosystem effects (flecker 1984) and links local community properties with regional processes (taylor 1996). such landscape-scale perspectives in fish ecology (schlosser 1991) enhance our under- standing and predictability of fish movement and ulti- mately aid in freshwater resource conservation and management (cooke et al. 2012; day et al. 2016). march of the sculpin acknowledgements this study was conducted as a part of a fish ecology (biol 6660) class project with funding from the department of biol- ogy at tennessee
