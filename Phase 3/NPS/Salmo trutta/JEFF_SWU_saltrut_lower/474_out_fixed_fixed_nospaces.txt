size-related feeding; ontogenetic niche; seasonal overlap; trophic guilds introduction studies from tropical environments demonstrate little agreement on the trophic organisation of ﬁsh assem- blages, particularly in relation to seasonal hydrology. several studies have documented low temporal vari- ability in community trophic structure (rayner et al. 2009; pusey et al. 2010), whereas others have iden- tiﬁed higher dietary specialisation and lower dietary overlap during high-water periods as a feature of neotropical ﬁsh assemblages (lowe-mcconnell 1964; goulding 1980). a contrasting tendency towards more pronounced trophic resource differentiation under dry- season or drought conditions has also been found (zaret & rand 1971; winemiller 1989; jepsen et al. 1997). a potentially confounding factor is the role of evolutionary history: much apparent differentiation in dietary habits can be attributed to family-level evolu- tionary differences in body form or behaviour, rather than an active process of resource partitioning to reduce competitive interaction (rayner et al. 2009; pusey et al. 2010). the coexistence of closely related and morphologically similar species can therefore provide substantial insights into the role of differential resource use in assemblage trophic structure. another factor that complicates the study of the intra- and interspeciﬁc feeding interactions in many aquatic food webs is the strong size-structuring evident in ﬁsh populations. the body sizes of conspeciﬁc individuals in some species can span several orders of magnitude (werner 1986), with concomitant changes in feeding and habitat use occurring throughout life histories. in some cases, these shifts are so profound that an individual species can assume several functional eco- logical roles during its life span. the concept of the ‘ontogenetic niche’ (sensu werner & gilliam 1984) is accordingly well established in ﬁsh ecology (stoner & livingston 1984; post 2003; davis et al. 2011). correspondence: a.m. davis, australian centre for tropical freshwater research, james cook university, townsville, queensland 4811, australia. e-mail: aaron. davis@jcu.edu.au 42 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00521.x wet-dry tropical rivers account for a considerable proportion of global river regimes (latrubesse et al. 2005), but have received little ecological attention in comparison with tropical and temperate systems. this situation is particularly prevalent in australia, where studies on wet-dry tropical rivers are relatively sparse (although see bishop et al. 2001; pusey et al. 2000). australia’s wet-dry monsoonal for almost 40% of total continental discharge (lake 1971; bishop & forbes 1991), as well as supporting a large proportion of australia’s freshwater ﬁsh diversity (allen et al. 2002). australia’s wet-dry tropical rivers are characterised by highly seasonal ﬂows, sharing a climatic–hydrological regime with tropical savanna environments across much of the world (haines et al. 1988). rivers account there has been growing advocacy for aquatic ecology to move beyond the assessment of localised within-catchment processes to adopt an increased spatio-temporal or ‘macro-ecological’ domain of investigation (hugueny et al. 2010). the basis of this approach is comparative ‘natural experiment’ studies where a limited number of potentially important attributes differentiate communities. recent eco- hydrological classiﬁcation of continental ﬂow regimes (kennard et al. 2010) provides a useful starting point for more focused investigations of relationships between ﬂow regime and ecology in an australian context. several distinctive ﬂow regime classes have contrasting size-related diet habits in terapontids been documented across the tropics (kennard et al. 2010). here, we examine the functional organisation of two northern assemblages of australian terapon- tidae (a family of generalised perciform ﬁshes) inhabiting different catchments from both intra- and interspeciﬁc perspectives. the two catchments share many bio-climatic and catchment land-use similarities, but exhibit contrasting long-term ﬂow regimes. we aimed to determine (i) the relationships between changes in body size and dietary resource utilisation in the two assemblages; (ii) whether the patterns of resource use are consistent between systems; and (iii) whether there is any evidence of seasonal effects on resource use. study area both study catchments were located within northern australia’s wet-dry tropics. the region has a sub- humid to humid tropical (monsoonal) climate, char- acterised by pronounced seasonality in rainfall patterns and discharge regimes. highest river ﬂows typically occur from december to april (the wet season) with lowest ﬂows occurring between august and october. burdekin river the burdekin river catchment is the ﬁfth largest in australia (130,000 km2), with a sub-humid monsoonal fig. 1. location of the two study catchments and sampling locations within each river system (left, daly river; right, burdekin river). 43 davis et al. climate, located in the wet-dry tropics of north-eastern australia (fig. 1). regional vegetation is dominated by sclerophylous eucalyptus and acacia woodlands, with the predominant catchment land use being low- intensity cattle grazing. the riparian zone is dominated by melaleuca and occasional open vine thickets (pearson 1991). more than 80% of annual rainfall occurs during the summer wet season between november and april. average annual rainfall through much of the study area is 750 mmæyear)1, although rainfall in some upper catchment reaches in the wet- tropics bioregion can be substantially higher (rogers et al. 1999). the ﬂow regime of the burdekin river is among the most variable in the world for rivers of comparable size (puckridge et al. 1998). the upper burdekin river system is low gradient, with a signiﬁcantly under-ﬁt channel characterised by steep banks, and minimal off-channel, ﬂoodplain habitat. despite its large size, the burdekin river has a very low diversity of in-stream habitats. the river is largely characterised by long shallow reaches dominated by a sand and ﬁne gravel substratum (pearson 1991). flow regimes in the upper burdekin catchment are classiﬁed as ‘unpredictable intermittent’ (kennard et al. 2010). this ﬂow regime class was notable for extreme levels of both intra- and interannual ﬂow variability and variable timing of maximum ﬂows. periods of no ﬂow occur in approximately 9% of years of data record (gauging station 120002c – burdekin river at sellheim, 1947–2005), although permanent long, shallow pools persist along the river. daly river the daly river catchment is 52,600 km2, located in the northern territory (fig. 1). catchment vegetation is dominated by eucalyptus savanna woodlands and open forest, with the predominant land use being low- intensity cattle grazing. more than 90% of the daly catchment’s approximate 1000-mm annual rainfall occurs during the summer wet season between november and march (jolly 2001). dry-season rain- fall (may–october) is negligible, with long periods of slowly declining ﬂows. while approximately a quarter of global tropical savanna rivers regularly cease to ﬂow (dodds 1997), the daly river is perennial, with dry-season baseﬂow maintained by groundwater input from extensive limestone and dolomite formations in the middle catchment. the long-term ﬂow regime in perennial reaches of the daly river is classiﬁed as ‘stable summer baseﬂow’ (kennard et al. 2010). while a strong seasonal run-off signal is evident in the daly (majority of run-off in summer), discharge is typically very stable within and among years (low variability in daily and annual ﬂows). the river is typically 40–60 m in width, with steep banks ranging 44 from 10 to 20 m in height, rising in a series of terraces (faulks 1998). lower terraces are vegetated by strips of melaleuca trees, and lower terraces are often dominated by dense closed forest communities, with many trees typical of monsoon closed forests (la- montagne et al. 2005). river substratum in the studied middle reaches is consistently dominated by coarse sand and ﬁne gravel (townsend & padovan 2005). fish assemblages the terapontidae (grunters) are among the most diverse families occurring in the burdekin and daly river catchments, and among the most numeric and biomass dominant ﬁshes in many habitats across both systems (pusey et al. 1998; b.j. pusey, unpublished data). the two catchments share very similar terapon- tid species assemblages in a taxonomic or functional sense. three of australia’s more widespread ﬁsh species, spangled perch leiopotherapon unicolor (gu¨nther), barred grunter amniataba percoides (gu¨nther) and sooty grunter hephaestus fuliginosus (macleay), are common to both catchments. the small-headed grunter scortum parviceps (macleay) is an endemic herbivore widespread across the burdekin catchment, whereas the closely related algivore–detri- tivore butler’s grunter syncomistes butleri vari is found in the daly catchment. materials and methods fish collection and dietary quantiﬁcation fish assemblages were collected at ﬁve sites on the main channel of the upper burdekin river over two sampling periods (1989–1992 and 2005–2008). these were the ‘upstream’ burdekin river sites outlined by pusey et al. (1998). fish were collected using a combination of backpack electroﬁshing, gill-netting and beach seine netting (see pusey et al. 1998 for a full description). the three sampling methods sampled different macrohabitats within each sample reach (i.e., electroﬁshing: rifﬂes and glides with in-stream cover; seine netting: open run and glide habitats; gill-netting: deepwater pools). sampling was conducted in may– june and october–november of each year. in the daly river, ﬁsh were collected at ﬁve main channel perennial sites on ﬁve separate occasions. seasonal timing of collection in the daly catchment was similar to that of the burdekin, commencing in june 2006 and ending in july 2008, with regular june– july and september–october sample occasions occur- ring over that time period. fish were collected via backpack and boat electroﬁshing, a combination that covered all major macrohabitats within a sample reach. standard length (l) was measured for each speci- men prior to excision of the stomach and viscera from the body cavity. stomachs that were estimated to be more than 20% full were transferred to a watch glass, and the contribution of each prey ⁄ food item was estimated by the indirect volumetric method of hyslop (1980). near-empty stomachs were excluded so as to prevent bias in the calculation of prey diversity or proportional contribution (pusey et al. 1995). all stomachs that were >20% full were treated equally in subsequent analyses. no association between diet composition and stomach fullness was therefore assumed, which may impart some error into analyses, although effects were expected to be minimal. food items were identiﬁed to the lowest practical taxonomic level and grouped within the following 22 food classes: 1, unidentiﬁed fraction (ui); 2, unidentiﬁed arthropoda fragments (uaf); 3, chironomidae larva or pupa (chi); 4, ephemeroptera larva (eph); 5, trichoptera larva (tri); 6, simuliidae larva (sim); 7, odonata larva (odo); 8, water surface invertebrates (gerridae ⁄ mesoveliidae ⁄ veliidae: sin); 9, other aqua- tic invertebrates (oai); 10, terrestrial ⁄ aerial inverte- brates (hymenoptera; odonata adults: tin); 11, palaemonidae (pal); 12, atyidae (aty); 13, zooplank- ton (copepoda; cladocera; acarina: zoo); 14, ostra- coda (ost); 15, mollusca-gastropoda (mol); 16, ﬁsh (fis); 17, detritus (det); 18, ﬁlamentous algae (fa); 19, aquatic macrophytes (am); 20 terrestrial vegeta- tion (tvg); 21, miscellaneous plant parts (mpp); and 22, terrestrial vertebrates (tvt). data analysis fish were allocated to one of the four length classes, corresponding to standard lengths of <40, 40–80, 80– 160 and >160 mm. these size classes correspond closely to the species’ ontogenetic trophic unit (otu) intervals of davis et al. (2011). the ‘unidentiﬁed’ diet category was excluded from all analyses. dietary data for any subsequent analyses was square-root-trans- formed (platell & potter 2001). spatial and temporal variation in diet while the focus of this study was a comparison of assemblage resource partitioning between two separate catchments, some initial analyses were conducted to document both within-catchment (between-site) and temporal (between-year) variation in diets, with the intent to justify pooling of data in subsequent analyses. to explore between-site variability in diet, mean volumetric dietary data for each species’ otu size interval at each site within a drainage division was calculated. a bray–curtis similarity matrix was gen- erated to compare all site-by-species otu comparisons contrasting size-related diet habits in terapontids within each catchment. resultant similarity values for each pairwise comparison between equivalent size class otus across different sites within a catchment were averaged to provide a measure of spatial variability in diet between similar-sized ﬁshes of the same species within the same catchment. to quantify temporal variability in diets between years, average dietary data for all species’ otus were separated according to year and season (early dry and late dry) in each catchment. a bray–curtis similarity matrix was generated comparing all season-by-species otu comparisons within each catchment between years. resultant similarity values for each pairwise comparison between equivalent size class otus across the same season between years within each catchment were averaged to provide a measure of yearly variability in diet between similar- sized ﬁshes of the same species during the same season. the bray–curtis similarity measure ranges between 0 and 100, representing zero to total similarity in diet composition, respectively. although there are no critical levels with which similarity values can be compared, this study considered a bray–curtis simi- larity value higher than 60 to indicate no biologically signiﬁcant difference in dietary habits (wallace 1981; grossman 1986). average (±se) otu bray–curtis diet similarity between sites was 64.1 (±2.48) in the upper burdekin and 63.5 (±2.2) in the daly, indicating that there was little within-catchment spatial variation in diet among similar-sized ﬁshes of the same species in either catchment. average (±se) otu bray–curtis diet similarity between equivalent otus during the same season, but compared between different years, was 70.1 (±2.9) in the upper burdekin and 73.5 (±3.4) in the daly. these results indicate that there was minimal spatial (between-site) or between-year variation in average diet among similar-sized ﬁshes of the same species and in the same season in either catchment. it was therefore assumed that pooling data between sites and across years in each catchment would not unduly confound subsequent analyses. multivariate analyses scaling nonmetric multidimensional ordination (nmds: kruskal 1964) was carried out to provide an unconstrained visual representation of terapontid community trophic structure in ordination space. the nonparametric nature of this analysis circumvents the underlying distributional assumptions associated with many other ordination methods and is widely regarded as the preferred technique when underlying ecological relationships are unknown (clarke 1993). samples collected from each catchment in may–july were pooled to represent the early dry season; similarly, all september–november samples from each catchment 45 davis et al. were pooled to represent a late dry season (see winemiller 2003; pusey et al. 2010). seasonal data sets from each catchment were then separated into the designated otu size classes. the analysis was conducted on a combined otu by otu similarity matrix for both catchments across both seasons, constructed using the bray–curtis dissimilarity coef- ﬁcient. to augment the nmds ordination, the relative dispersion of species’ diets in each catchment on the ordination plot was quantiﬁed using multivariate dispersion indices from the mvdisp routine in primer (somerﬁeld & clarke 1997). multivariate dispersion (spread of variance in diet similarities) can provide an indication of divergence in niche space (i.e., decreased dietary overlap) within communities. all multivariate analysis of dietary data was conducted using primerò v.7 software (clarke & gorley 2006). the collective trophic guild structure of the two catchment assemblages, as well as evidence for seasonal guild switching, was investigated via hierar- chical cluster analysis, employing the bray–curtis similarity matrix and group average linkage. the similarity proﬁle analysis routine in primer (sim- prof, with a p < 0.01 and number of permuta- tions = 999) was applied to clustering outputs to objectively identify valid clusters. simprof performs permutation tests at every node of a completed dendrogram to identify statistically signiﬁcant clusters in samples that are a priori unstructured (clarke & gorley 2006; clarke et al. 2008). the simper (similarity of percentages) sub-routine was used to determine dietary categories characteristic of each identiﬁed guild. simper decomposes average bray– curtis similarities between all pairs of samples in groups (or between groups of samples) into percentage contributions from each dietary item (clarke 1993). dietary overlap the comparative level of dietary overlap evident between catchment assemblages, as well as within catchments between seasons, was compared using the bray–curtis similarity matrix. bray–curtis similarity values range from 0% (no shared species) to 100% (all prey species are shared and consumed in the same proportion), and the index can be used to provide a measure of dietary overlap (marshall & elliott 1997). prey groups that are mutually absent from two diets (double zeros in proportion) are excluded from the similarity calculation as joint absences may not indicate a common negative feeding preference (legendre & legendre 1998). to contrast the average levels of resource overlap occurring between catchment assemblages, all bray– curtis pairwise similarity values over both seasons 46 within each catchment were summed and compared using an unequal variance t-test (see ruxton 2006) (spss version 16.0; spss inc., chicago, il, usa). seasonal differences in the average intensity of resource overlap occurring within each catchment were compared similarly by means of an unequal variance t-test of the average bray–curtis diet simi- larity from all pairwise otu · otu comparisons in the early dry season compared with the late dry season. the intensity of overlap was assessed against the following levels: high (>60), intermediate (40–60) or low (<40), following grossman (1986) and ross (1986). p ( p niche breadth levin’s standardised measure of dietary breadth, ba (hurlbert 1978), was used to compare the levels of dietary specialisation between each catchment’s col- lective otu assemblage and to assess seasonal differences in niche breadth within catchments, as follows: 2) and ba = (bl ) 1) ⁄ (n ) 1) pi bl = 1 ⁄ ( where bl = levin’s measure of niche breadth; pi = proportional contribution of resource i to the total diet pi = 1.0); ba = levin’s standardised niche breadth; and n = number of possible resource (diet) categories. it is useful to standardise bl to a scale of 0 (minimum niche breadth and maximum specialisation) to 1 (maximum niche breadth and minimum special- isation) to allow comparisons among species (krebs 1999). the signiﬁcance of any difference in the average levels of dietary specialisation (niche breadth) evident across both catchments (both seasons com- bined) was tested using a two-tailed, unequal variance t-test. seasonal differences in the average niche breadth occurring within catchment assemblages were tested in the same manner. all niche breadth values were calculated on the average species otu diets outlined in tables 1 and 2. results and larvae trichopteran stomach contents were identiﬁed for 1170 ﬁsh from the burdekin catchment and 850 ﬁsh from the daly river. four food items (ﬁlamentous algae, chironomid larvae, ephemeropteran nymphs) accounted for almost 70% of total diet in burdekin terapontids when averaged across all species otus (table 1). these four items similarly accounted for a substantial proportion of average diet (45%) across daly river terapontid otus, with detritus (10.3%) also constituting an important food category in the daly river (table 2). the unidentiﬁed dietary component was relatively minor for species otus in both catchment, with a maximum of 3.3% for any ; t x e

unlikely to exert any confounding effects on between-catchment comparisons of resource partitioning. . 0 8 5 . 8 8 4 2 . 1 6 . 1 8 4 . 4 8 6 . 4 3 4 0 . 0 7 . 9 3 3 . 5 2 6 . 2 5 4 . 4 8 5 9 . 1 4 . 0

ordination space indicated pronounced size-related dietary shifts in species from the daly river, regardless of season (fig. 2). the diets of small juveniles in the daly (<40 mm l) were all grouped closely, suggesting considerable similarity in diet. size-related diet shifts, while evident in burdekin river terapontids, were more constrained. this interpretation was supported by the outcomes of the mvdisp test, with the multivariate dispersion value for the entire daly river assemblage (1.102) being substantially greater than that of the burdekin (0.871). cluster analysis and simprof tests for signiﬁcant guild structure identiﬁed seven coherent trophic groups (p < 0.01) encompassing a diversity of trophic levels across the two assemblages (fig. 3). each group was allocated to a functional feeding guild on the basis of dominant items in diet identiﬁed through simper analysis (table 3). dietary items such as chironomid larvae, ephemer- opteran nymphs, trichopteran larvae and ﬁlamentous algae were particularly important for several guilds, although the relative contributions or total range of dietary items differentiated several speciﬁc guilds that consumed these prey items. one guild (herbivores) was exclusive to the burdekin catchment, with three guilds (macrophagous consumers, detritivores–algi- vores and meiophagous omnivores) unique to the daly river assemblage. the remaining four guilds com- prised otus from both catchments. size-related and seasonal guild shifts for each species, catchment and season are summarised in table 4. single species occupying multiple trophic guilds occurred in both catchments. ontogenetic niche shifts were particularly evident in h. fuliginosus in both catchments. this species simultaneously occu- pied three distinct trophic guilds in both the early and late dry season in the daly river, while it was the only burdekin species to occupy more than two simulta- neous trophic guilds in any season (late dry season). s i n ; t x e t e h t n i d e t s i l e r a s m e t i y r a t e d i r o f i s n o i t a v e r b b a . n o s a e s o t i g n d r o c c a ) s u t o ( s t i n u i c h p o r t c i t e n e g o t

within-species otus between seasons were uncommon for both assem- blages. guild d (invertivores–planktivores) was the only trophic guild unique to a season in either catchment, with several small juvenile otus from both catchments assuming this dietary mode in the late dry season. the shift by the largest otu of contrasting size-related diet habits in terapontids fig. 3. cluster analysis

shift. dietary overlap the otu by otu bray–curtis similarity matrices for each catchment and season are presented in appendix 1. average (±se) bray–curtis dietary overlap for both seasons combined was signiﬁcantly lower in the daly river (45.59 ± 1.63, n = 156) than in the burdekin river (52.85 ± 1.71, n = 144) (two-tailed, unequal variance t-test, d.f. = 296, t = 3.07, p < 0.01). much of this difference could be attributed to seasonal differences in degree of collective dietary overlap in the daly river. the average level of dietary overlap was signiﬁcantly lower (two-tailed, unequal variance t-test, d.f. = 153, t = 2.447, p < 0.05) in the daly late dry assemblage (41.6 ± 2.19, n = 78) compared with the early dry (49.57 ± 2.35, n = 78). there was no signiﬁcant difference in average dietary overlap between the early dry (54.35 ± 2.38, n = 78) and late dry (51.077 ± 2.44, n = 66) seasons in the burdekin river terapontid assemblage (two-tailed, unequal variance t-test, d.f.

evident in terapontid otu dietary specialisation in relation to size, season or catchment effects (table 5). the otus of the herbiv- orous s. parviceps (burdekin river) and the detritivo- rous–algivorous s. butleri (daly river) demonstrated the highest levels of dietary specialisation of all species, particularly in larger size classes. there were no signiﬁcant differences detected (p > 0.05) in overall levels of dietary specialisation (both seasons combined) between catchments, or within catchments between seasons (two-tailed, unequal variance t-tests). indicating what levels of dietary overlap were both within the range of 40–60, is generally regarded as a moderate level of dietary overlap (see grossman 1986; ross 1986). appendix 1 highlights the degree of dietary overlap occurring between the smallest and largest otus of each species according to catchment and season. intraspeciﬁc pairwise dietary overlap between several burdekin river otus was of high intensity (>80) for species such as a. percoides and l. uni- color, particularly in the early dry season, indicative of minimal size-related dietary divergence. intraspe- ciﬁc dietary overlap between the smallest and largest individuals of species such as h. fuliginosus and l. unicolor in the daly river was very low in comparison (<20), particularly in the late dry season (see also table 1). this outcome

0.15 0.07 0.06 0.04 0.10 discussion this study has demonstrated considerable plasticity in the magnitude of size-related dietary shifts in two terapontid assemblages inhabiting different environ- ments. diets of small juveniles (<40 mm l) within both catchments were invertivorous, regardless of season. while several burdekin river species were contrasting size-related diet habits in terapontids largely invertivorous across all size classes, the diet of larger daly river terapontids diverged signiﬁcantly from the initial period of high juvenile dietary overlap. similarity in resource use early in life history between closely related species, prior to niche divergence with increasing size, has been documented in a range of ﬁsh (mittelbach 1984; mark et al. 1987; garner 1996; olson & young 2003) and other aquatic vertebrates (mushinsky et al. 1982). werner & gilliam (1984) noted that patterns of intraspeciﬁc resource use may vary on a continuum from minimal resource partitioning among size clas- ses, extending through to discrete ontogenetic diet ⁄ habitat shifts with no direct interaction between different size classes. the intraspeciﬁc trophic trajec- tories of burdekin river and daly river terapontid assemblages clearly align closely with either of these two extremes, at least for some species. the low intraspeciﬁc dietary overlap evident between the smallest and largest otus of many daly terapontids coupled with greater numbers of size-related feeding guilds size classes acting as ecologically different species. differential expression in the magnitude of size-related dietary shifts, more than any other factor, appeared to play the major role in the greater trophic guild differentiation in the daly compared with the burdekin river assemblage. indicates different allochthonous food such as riparian fruits and terrestrial vertebrates (frogs and carrion) were conspic- uously absent from the diets of burdekin terapontids. in the daly, these items were major contributors to the diet of larger individuals of species such as h. fuliginosus. this result likely reﬂects the differences in riparian vegetation between the burdekin and daly. the upper burdekin riparian zone has low ﬂoristic diversity, dominated by melaleuca leucadendron (pearson 1991), whereas the daly riparian zone is dominated by a ﬂoristically complex, and highly baseﬂow depen- dent (pheatophytic) closed-monsoon forest (lamonta- gne et al. 2005; o’grady et al. 2006). flow regime and access to groundwater have been shown to be important determinants of vegetation assemblage structure and lateral zonation in northern australian riparian ecosys- tems (pettit et al. 2001; o’grady et al. 2006). a diverse monsoon-forest riparian community is a feature of perennial systems across northern australia, whereas systems with less reliable dry-season ﬂow are domi- nated by melaleuca. thus, the contrasting ﬂow regimes of the two rivers appear to have an important inﬂuence on their respective food webs. while detritivorous or herbivorous dietary strategies are rare within australia’s entire freshwater ich- ythyofauna (kennard et al. 2001), the terapontidae is one of the few australian families to include these diets to a signiﬁcant extent (davis et al. 2010). the evolution of these dietary strategies has very probably 53 davis et al. reduced much interspeciﬁc competition for food, even within assemblages of closely related species. adop- tion of a specialised diet may still constitute a viable life history trait in these variable river systems if the niche is unoccupied and ⁄ or the targeted resource (detritus or aquatic vegetation in this case) is contin- uously available despite environmental variability. both the daly and burdekin river terapontid assem- blages exhibited minor spatial and between-year vari- ability in diets, as has been observed in other tropical australian river systems (rayner et al. 2009; pusey et al. 2010). the decreased dry-season dietary overlap in the daly is similar to that in several other tropical systems (zaret & rand 1971; winemiller 1989; jepsen et al. 1997). baseﬂow stability and predictability of daily ﬂow (key variables differentiating the daly and burdekin) have been identiﬁed as particularly inﬂuen- tial hydrological factors in ﬁltering the suite of ecolog- ical traits likely to be favoured in a region (poff & allan 1995). the maintenance of relatively stable and predictable baseﬂow conditions in the daly during the dry season may facilitate niche complementarity as a mechanism to avoid intense competitive interactions both between and within species. however, the exact mechanism producing the reduced dry-season dietary overlap in the daly is somewhat unclear. while there were some guild shifts associated with the transition to the dry season in the daly, a similar number also occurred in the burdekin, and it is unlikely that the signiﬁcantly lower overlap evident in the late dry season can be solely attributed to these few species’ shifts. given that guild structure remained relatively stable, it is also possible that otus showed greater patterns of intra-guild resource sub-division during the late dry season (see winemiller & pianka 1990). this study has shown that size-related dietary shifts within terapontids can exhibit considerable plasticity. while ﬁsh dietary information needs coupling with resource availability data to rigorously test relation- ships, differences in long-term ﬂow regime, particularly baseﬂow perenniality, may have played a substantial role in the observed differences in diet shifts between the studied assemblages. broader relationships between interspeciﬁc interactions, species’ traits and long-term hydrological variability have received considerable attention (grossman et al. 1982; winemiller & rose 1992; townsend & hildrew 1994; poff & allan 1995; poff 1997; blanck et al. 2007), and the implications of environmental variability on ontogenetic resource use, however, remain largely untested. acknowledgements mark kennard, ian dixon, the staff from northern territory fisheries and steve
