akihito; sicyopus; smilosicyopus; otolith microstructure; amphidromy; pelagic larval duration introduction insular river systems in the tropical and subtropical indo-paciﬁc area are mainly colonised by freshwater gobioids. species from the sicydiinae subfamily have an amphidromous life cycle, which allows them to disperse through the ocean and to recruit in distant island rivers. this cycle is adapted to the conditions in these distinctive habitats, which are young oligo- trophic rivers subject to extreme climatic and hydro- logical seasonal variation (keith 2003; mcdowall 2007). the adults grow, feed and reproduce in fresh- water habitats. hatched larvae drift downstream towards the sea (luton et al. 2005; maeda & tachi- hara 2010) where they spend a variable amount of time, ranging from 2 to 6 months (yamasaki et al. 2007; iida et al. 2008; lord et al. 2010). at the end of the pelagic larval phase, the postlarvae recruit to rivers and they undergo a metamorphosis (keith et al. 2008; valade et al. 2009; taillebois et al. 2011) while migrating upstream to settle in the upper reaches. at certain times of the year, the biomass of gobioid larvae recruiting is so great that they become a major source of food for local human populations in the indo-paciﬁc area (e.g., reunion island, vanuatu and french polynesia) (bell 1999; valade et al. 2009; lord et al. 2010). the adult phase, the larval down- stream migration and the recruiting phase are only starting to be understood in detail (keith et al. 2006; correspondence: l. taillebois, biologie des organismes marins et ecosyste`mes (umr borea 7208 cnrs-mnhn), muse´um national d’histoire naturelle, de´partement milieux et peuplements aquatiques, cp-026, 43 rue cuvier, 75231 paris, france. e-mail: taillebois@mnhn.fr 552 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00575.x yamasaki & tachihara 2006; valade et al. 2009; lord et al. 2010; yamasaki et al. 2011). however, the processes undergone during the pelagic larval phase remain poorly known (radtke & kinzie 1996; shen et al. 1998; radtke et al. 2001) although their understanding would help elucidate how these spe- cies disperse and are distributed. additionally, under- standing these processes is a necessity to implement conservation measures to protect sicydiinae as they contribute most to the diversity of ﬁsh communities in the tropical indo-paciﬁc insular river systems and have the highest level of endemism (lord & keith 2008; keith & lord 2011a). the sicydiinae subfamily comprises nine genera and nearly 110 species (keith & lord 2011b; keith et al. 2011a). no two genera are similarly distributed, with each having a unique distribution of their own (keith et al. 2011a), for example akihito is only dis- tributed in the south paciﬁc ocean (keith et al. 2007; watson et al. 2007), whereas sicyopus is widely distributed from madagascar in the west indian ocean to fiji in the south paciﬁc ocean (watson 1999; keith et al. 2011b). in the present study, pelagic larval duration (pld) was investigated for one widespread and two rare endemic species belonging to different genera of the sicydiinae sub- family: sicyopus zosterophorum (bleeker, 1856) is widely distributed from southern japan to micronesia and from indonesia to fiji (watson 1999); smilosicy- opus chloe (watson et al. 2001) is endemic to new caledonia and vanuatu; and akihito vanuatu watson, keith & marquet 2007 is endemic to vanuatu (fig. 1a). all of them inhabit swift, clear, high-gradi- ent streams. the two endemic species are sympatric with the widespread s. zosterophorum. otoliths are well-known paired calciﬁed structures in the ﬁsh’s inner ear. they are metabolically inert, grow continuously on a daily basis throughout the individual’s life cycle (campana 1999; lecomte- finiger 1999) and do not undergo any mineral resorption (mugiya & uchimura 1989). they have therefore long been used for age estimation in many ﬁsh species (victor 1986; wellington & victor 1989; victor & wellington 2000; kuroki et al. 2007), including sicydiinae (radtke et al. 1988, 2001; shen & tzeng 2002, 2008; yamasaki et al. 2007; lord et al. 2010). the sicydiinae metamorphosis is mate- rialised on the otolith by a metamorphosis check mark, reﬂecting a decrease in the rate of calcareous growth, formed as the postlarvae recruit to the rivers and start to settle the upper reaches (shen & tzeng 2002; keith et al. 2008). the increment count from the core to the metamorphosis check mark is therefore an estimation of the pld. the purpose of this study is to validate the formation of daily increments on otoliths of s. zosterophorum pelagic larval duration of three sicydiinae gobies and to estimate the pld of s. zosterophorum, s. chloe and a. vanuatu in order to better understand the differences between endemic and widespread species. the pld was compared between the three species to test the hypothesis that endemic species has shorter pld than widely distributed species. material and methods studied areas and sample collection for ageing specimens used in the present study were collected in vanuatu, new caledonia, indonesia and japan. in vanuatu, samples of s. zosterophorum and s. chloe were caught on santo and gaua (july 2005), ambae, pentecost, and malekula islands (january–february 2010). the endemic species of vanuatu, a. vanuatu, was collected on ambae and pentecost islands (january–february 2010) (fig. 1e). in new caledo- nia, samples of s. zosterophorum and s. chloe were caught in the north-eastern side of grande terre (january and october 2010) (fig. 1d). the wide- spread species s. zosterophorum was also collected in rivers on okinawa and iriomote islands (december 2010–april 2011) (fig. 1b) in the ryukyu archi- pelago, japan, and in papua province (indonesia) (october 2010) (fig. 1c). a total of 59 a. vanuatu (adults, 22.3–39.9 mm in standard length – sl), 62 s. zosterophorum (adults and juveniles, 20.4–45.0 mm sl) and 47 s. chloe (adults, 21.2–40.4 mm sl) were caught for the age estimation (table 1). specimens were sampled by electro-ﬁshing (portable dekka 3000 electric device; dekka ltd, leutkirch, germany), using a large hand net, or only with the use of hand nets while snorkel- ling. fish were put to sleep and killed using an over- dose of 10% clove essential oil and were then kept in 95% ethyl alcohol. validation of daily increments to validate the daily deposition of the growth incre- ments in the otolith of s. zosterophorum, we used an alizarin complexone (alc) time marking technique. six juveniles were collected from a stream on the northern part of okinawa island on 27 and 28 november 2010. these juveniles were brought alive to the laboratory where they were transferred in the evening of the 28th november to a 3-l freshwater  1 solution of alc and tank containing a 50 mg·l were held there for 24 h. all six juveniles were then kept in two 4-l freshwater tanks (each tank containing three juveniles) for 12 days before a second treatment  1 alc solution for 24 h. after an with the 50 mg·l additional 8-day rearing in freshwater tanks, all ﬁsh were put to sleep and killed using an overdose of 553 taillebois et al.

(2010) on sicyopterus japonicus. and sarasini sicyopterus no signiﬁcant differences were found between plds for the three studied species (54.6 ± 5.6 days for s. zosterophorum, 53.6 ± 5.7 days for s. chloe, 55.4 ± 7.5 days for a. vanuatu) despite the fact that s. zosterophorum is a widespread species unlike the other two. the two endemic species s. chloe and a. vanuatu have a shorter pld than some previously studied endemic sicydiinae such as sicyopterus aien- sis (mean ± sd – 79.2 ± 4.6 days) endemic to vanu- (76.5 ± 3.9 days) atu endemic to new caledonia (lord et al. 2010), cotyl- opus acutipinnis (99.5 ± 18.5 days) endemic to the mascarene islands (hénaff 2008) or lentipes concol- or (86.2 ± 8.5 days) endemic to hawaii (radtke et al. 2001). the widespread species s. zosteropho- rum has a shorter pld than the indo-paciﬁc wide- spread percnopterygionus (99 ± 16 days) from the ryukyu archipelago (japan) to micronesia (yamasaki et al. 2007), sicyopterus lagocephalus and the endemic species cited above. lord et al. (2010) showed that s. lagocephalus had a longer pld (131 ± 3.4 days) than the endemic cong- eners s. aiensis and s. sarasini cited above. they suggested in this case a positive relationship between dispersal abilities, geographical distribution and the pld, that is, a species with a long pld would dis- perse further than a species with a shorter pld. the diadromous (percoidei), which is widely distributed in the indo-paciﬁc area, has a longer pld (40.6 ± 6.9 days) than k. sauvagii (32.3 ± 3.4 days), endemic to the indian ocean species kuhlia rupestris stiphodon species pelagic larval duration of three sicydiinae gobies table 2. age at recruitment (mean days ± sd) for sicyopus zosterophorum, smilosicyopus chloe and akihito vanuatu in the different localities. s. zosterophorum s. chloe a. vanuatu vanuatu 52.9 ± 4.0 (n = 16) 54.2 ± 8.5 (n = 18) 55.4 ± 7.5 (n = 59) new caledonia papua 54.1 ± 5.8 (n = 24) 53.2 ± 4.0 (n = 29) 56.1 ± 4.1 (n = 8) japan 56.6 ± 7.2 (n = 14) total 54.6 ± 5.6 (n = 62) 53.6 ± 5.7 (n = 47) 55.4 ± 7.5 (n = 59) and despite to s. lagocephalus pld, (feutry et al. 2012). the authors concluded that the pld is probably one factor controlling the extent of distribution range in kuhlia. however, for sicyopte- rus japonicus, endemic to the taiwan–japan region, shen & tzeng (2008) showed that the pld of this species in taiwan was 163 ± 12.79, and iida et al. (2008) showed that the age at recruitment in wakay- ama, japan, was 208 ± 22 days; both results are sim- ilar its endemicity, s. japonicus has a long pld. but s. japonicus is the only temperate sicydiinae species, and its long pld may be linked to the timing of reproduction and recruitment during speciﬁc seasons, which are well marked in the temperate zone unlike in the tropical zone (iida et al. 2008). finally, wel- lington & victor (1989) and victor & wellington (2000) compared the pld of endemic (28–68 days) and widespread (18–74 days) marine congeners of wrasses and damselﬁsh in the eastern paciﬁc ocean, and they concluded that there was no correlation between the pld and the geographical distribution of these species. processes reproduction, the discrepancy of these results suggests that ele- ments other than the pld should be considered to explain the differences in the geographical distribu- tion of the studied species. the interaction of biologi- cal larval development, larval behaviour and survival, and physical processes such as climate and ocean currents (direction and strength), could affect dispersal, recruitment and distribution of sicydiinae species (mcdowall 2010). each species might also exhibit different habitat preferences. parameters such as the nature of the substrate could regulate the survival of juveniles and adults. for example, s. sarasini exclu- sively colonises rivers that run on an ultramaﬁc sub- strate (nickel rich substrate) in new caledonia (lord et al. 2010). the substrate in streams could also regu- late recruitment, because the microchemistry of the rivers is suggested to act as a speciﬁc signal for post- larval recruitment into the estuary (lord et al. 2010). even though the pld of s. zosterophorum, s. chloe and a. vanuatu was shorter in comparison with the other sicydiinae species studied so far, the pld of all sicydiinae species is much longer than those found in the typical coastal marine gobies (ca. such as 30–45 days: brothers et al. 1983; beldade et al. 2007; maeda et al. 2008a). some amphidromous gobioids, such as eleotris and awaous, also have a longer pld (radtke et al. 1988; maeda et al. 2007). this may reﬂect sparseness of the habitat of those amphidromous gobioids (insular freshwater streams) compared with coastal ﬁsh, as colonisation to the sparsely distributed habitats might require greater dis- persal ability with longer pld (maeda et al. 2007, 2008b, 2011). the metamorphosis of sicydiinae post- larvae is a physiological phenomenon involved with the recruitment (taillebois et al. 2011), which impli- cates a relatively high plasticity in the recruitment timing. the potential of longer pld enables a delay in metamorphosis to ﬁnd suitable habitat (victor 1986; keith et al. 2008). however, the lack of varia- tion of pld observed between and within (sd between 5.6 and 7.5) the three sicydiinae species in the present study suggests that these three species cannot delay the metamorphosis as much as sicyopte- rus species for example. although some sicydiinae species have generally been considered to have a cer- tain plasticity in timing of the recruitment (keith et al. 2008), the results of the present study suggest that this concept should be reconsidered for some species. the current study has improved our knowledge with regard to the pld of endemic and more widely distributed sicydiinae species. pld is not the only factor determining species’ distribution and most likely interacts with other variables such as larval behaviour, environment, distribution of the pelagic larvae, currents, substrate preferences of adults and juveniles, etc. these variables and factors should be further studied to understand sicydiinae dispersal. these new insights into pld and recruitment plastic- ity will help implement conservation measures for these species and their habitat. acknowledgements first, we would like to thank all the partners that have ﬁnan- cially
