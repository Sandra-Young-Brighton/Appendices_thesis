(richter many major river systems globally have been dammed, leading to altered flow regimes, irreversibly changed habitat characteristics and fragmented fish populations et al. 1997; nilsson et al. 2005). the effects of dams on fish populations are well-documented downstream (pringle et al. 2000), and changes have been identified as important fac- tors contributing to the global decline in freshwater biodiversity (jenkins 2003). upstream of dams, gra- dient and stream size are irreversibly altered when fluvial systems are ponded. declines in species abun- dance and diversity have been reported following correspondence: j.m. shrimpton, ecosystem science and management (biology) program, university of northern british columbia, prince george, bc v2n 4z9, canada. e-mail: shrimptm@unbc.ca *present address: sarah c. f. hawkshaw, department of zoology, university of british columbia, vancouver, bc canada doi: 10.1111/eff.12092 383 hawkshaw et al. grayling populations a flooding of a reservoir, but new species may also invade reservoirs and take advantage of the altered (rahel 2002; sebastian et al. 2003; julio habitat et al. 2009). few studies, however, have examined how fish populations in tributaries that flow into res- ervoirs are altered. recent evidence has shown that some species have been extirpated due to restricted available habitat and an inability to re-colonise through the reservoir (e.g., matthews & marsh- matthews 2007). thus, increased efforts are needed to gather better data on patterns of habitat use by freshwater species and how they respond to environ- mental change. in currently managed as a species of concern in north-central british columbia is the arctic grayling thymallus_arcticus. the williston arctic watershed are catch- and-release fishery due to a drastic decline in arctic grayling abundance over two decades in the williston watershed (northcote 1993). the decline occurred after construction of the wac bennett dam and sub- sequent flooding of the upper peace river forming the williston reservoir in 1968. grayling from the upper peace river watershed exhibit a fluvial life- history strategy and do not appear to use the reservoir (clarke et al. 2007). flooding of the upper peace therefore resulted in considerable loss of habitat. it is difficult, however, to quantify the effects of the dam on populations of grayling given the paucity of infor- mation on arctic grayling before the dam was built (ballard & shrimpton 2009). information on physical and environmental requirements is limited for this species, particularly for juvenile grayling. confound- ing the problem, adult and juvenile arctic grayling in river systems do not appear to overlap in habitat use (hughes 1999; cowie & blackman 2004). young fish tend to be concentrated in the lower sections of rivers by downstream movement during the first year of life (kaya 1991; bradford et al. 2008); however, the distribution of age classes broadens over time as individuals move upstream, so that fish recruiting to headwater reaches are generally older (hughes 1999). our aim was to examine what environmental charac- teristics affected juvenile arctic grayling occurrence in a large watershed altered by formation of a large reservoir. we used an information theoretic approach to identify a priori combinations of environmental variables that have the greatest influence on juvenile grayling distribution. we used measurements devel- oped from digital maps to create landscape models and also made stream reach measurements in a field survey to create site-specific models. it is important to understand what combinations of factors affect dis- tribution to develop an understanding of how habitat changes have, but also may, impact arctic grayling populations. 384 methods landscape model the williston watershed in north-central british columbia, canada, is approximately 70,000 km2. we selected 97 subwatersheds for analysis of arctic gray- ling landscape-level habitat requirements (fig. 1). watersheds were selected to represent potential range of habitats available to arctic grayling in the willis- ton watershed and ranged in size from 2.23 to 19,024 km2. juvenile arctic grayling presence or absence in the study watersheds was determined from previous sampling records summarised by william- son and zimmerman (2004) and from field surveys. where available, results of the field surveys were cross-referenced with previous sampling records. if survey results did not agree, grayling were considered to be present. previous sampling records were not available for 25 study watersheds in the southern part of the williston watershed. the 2010 survey results therefore were used to designate presence or absence in these watersheds. grayling <15 cm in length (2 years and younger; see ballard & shrimpton 2009) were included in the analysis. eleven landscape variables were derived from the terrain resource information management (trim) watershed atlas digital elevation model (dem), a 1:20,000 digital base map of bc in geographic infor- mation systems (gis) software (arcgis 9.3, envi- ronmental systems research institute, redlands, ca, usa) and databases of fish sampling records pro- vided by the british columbia ministry of environ- ment (williamson & zimmerman 2004). for the 97 subwatersheds flowing into the reservoir, average ele- vation (avee; m), maximum elevation (maxe; m) and minimum elevation (mine; m) were derived from the digital base map for each stream in a given watershed. average gradient (aveg;%), maximum gradient (maxg;%) and minimum gradient (ming;%) were calculated using the difference in elevation between the two end points of each stream within a watershed divided by stream length. stream order (so; strahler 1952) and watershed area (wsa; km2) were derived directly from the digital base map for each of the watersheds identified in fig. 1. a data- base with locations of known fish migration barriers (falls, cascades, bridges, beaver dams, culverts and large rocks) (williamson & zimmerman 2004) was mapped on the digital base map and used to deter- mine the watershed density of barriers for each watershed (owsd; #km  2). the total length of all roads within a watershed was measured on the digital base map and used to determine watershed road den- sity for each watershed (wsr; kmkm  2). the num- ber of road–stream crossings within each watershed effect of reservoir formation on a fluvial species fig. 1. map of the williston watershed, indicating approximate location of each watershed included in landscape analysis (n = 97) and field site analysis (n = 57). dashed lines define boundaries for each watershed used in the models. was counted on the digital base map and used to determine stream-crossing density for each watershed (wssx; #km  2). field site model sixty-five study sites were selected in the southern part of the watershed. sites were selected based on previous arctic grayling sampling records (william- son & zimmerman 2004). each study site was located on a different stream system (with the excep- tion of upper and lower sites, >100 km apart, on three larger rivers systems), and we assumed that sites were independent (fig. 1). study sites repre- sented a stream reach and were chosen from a variety of habitats available; sites were located in streams fed by large lake systems, in streams influenced by snowmelt, and located in streams associated with lin- ear developments, such as roads. juvenile arctic grayling presence or absence was determined by field surveys conducted in the low-flow summer months in 2010 and sampling records from 1994 to 2009 (williamson & zimmerman 2004; bc ministry of environment, unpublished data). a back- pack electrofisher (smith-root, vancouver, wa, usa) was used to conduct single-pass surveys on stream reaches containing each study site to confirm presence or absence. we assumed juvenile grayling to be present at a site if at least one individual was observed; presence of all other fish species was also recorded. there was considerable range in width of the different streams and rivers in our study, from 1 m to over 30 m in width. for small streams, we sampled fish over a 50-m stretch, and for larger systems, we 385 hawkshaw et al. sampled up to approximately 200 m up- and down- stream of the transect. electrofishing methods could not safely be used at three sites, and a beach seine sur- vey was conducted. field surveys were cross-refer- enced with previous sampling records, but were only available for 40 of the field sites. field survey results agreed with previous sampling records for the major- ity (88%) of sites, except for five sites. two sites were unsuitable for electrofishing and seine surveys (depth >1 m and excessive water velocity); the most recent previous sampling records therefore were used to determine grayling presence or absence for these sites. twenty variables were measured in the field or derived from the trim 1:20,000 digital base map of bc. all field measurements were taken during sum- mer of 2010 and were collected at sites that were rep- resentative for the stream reach. to capture the range of thermal conditions during the warmest part of the year at each site, hourly temperature data from 18 june 2010 to 18 august 2010 (hobo water temp u22, onset corporation, bourne, ma, usa) were used to calculate three temperature variables: average water temperature (avet; °c), average value for daily water temperature variance (vart; °c2) and average value for daily maximum water temperature (maxt; °c) over the 2 months. other water quality measure- ments taken were dissolved oxygen (do; mgl  1), conductivity (c; lscm  1) and ph and were collected at a single point in time. depth (d; m), wetted-stream width (w; m), water velocity (v; ms  1) and eleva- tion (e; m) were also measured for a single represen- tative transect on the stream reach where a study site was chosen. average gradient (g; %) of stream seg- ments containing field study sites was calculated as described above for the landscape model. average substrate coarseness (aves) and heterogeneity (sds) were measured by visual estimations of the percent- age of each substrate category [a modified went- worth scale from 1 (clay) to 6 (boulders)] within a 0.5-m2 transect at each temperature logger site (bain & stevenson 1999). we quantified large woody deb- ris (lwd; #) by a visual count of all large woody debris (≥1 m long and 10 cm diameter) fully or par- tially submerged in the stream over the same length of stream we sampled for fish. we also included landscape features in our field site models to define the type of watershed and posi- tion within that watershed: so (the top-ranked vari- able in the landscape model) and stream distance from the reservoir (sdr) to indicate length of fluvial habitat below the study site. a database with loca- tions of known fish migration barrier, described above, was mapped on the digital base map and used to determine the density of barriers upstream (oupd; #km  1) for each study site. the total length of all roads was measured  1) and downstream (odnd; #km 386  2). within an area centred on the study site with 0.5 km radius on the digital base map and used to determine local road density (k1r; kmkm  2). the number of road–stream crossings was measured within the same 0.5 km radius area and used to determine the local stream-crossing density (k1sx; #km the presence or absence of other salmonid species (other) at each field site was also recorded during the grayling surveys in 2010 and coded as a binary variable for inclusion in the analysis. presence/ absence results of the survey were checked with pre- vious survey results, and where we could not conduct surveys, previous data were used to assign presence or absence of other salmonid species at a study site (williamson & zimmerman 2004). statistical analysis we used an information theoretic approach (burnham & anderson 2002) to rank a priori models consisting of predictor variables recognised as important for explaining habitat use by arctic grayling. candidate models were based on studies on arctic grayling habi- tat requirements, and information on other salmonids was also used to supplement important data gaps (ballard & shrimpton 2009). for the watershed scale (landscape) modelling approach, 12 ecologically plau- sible candidate models were tested. models for arctic grayling occurrence examined landscape features (l; beecher et al. 1988; williamson & zimmerman 2004), surface features (s; porter et al. 2000; cowie & blackman 2004; scrimgeour et al. 2008), obstacles (o; kruse et al. 1997), linear developments such as roads (r; scrimgeour et al. 2008) and combinations of these feature types. for the stream reach scale (field site) modelling approach, 21 ecologically plau- sible candidate models were tested. models for gray- ling occurrence examined position in the watershed (p; beecher et al. 1988; clarke et al. 2007), water temperature (t; lohr et al. 1996; deegan et al. 1999; wehrly et al. 2007; shrimpton et al. 2007), water quality (q; eklov et al. 1998; ballard & shrimpton 2009; mcrae et al. 2012), surface features (s; porter et al. 2000; cowie & blackman 2004; scrimgeour et al. 2008), instream features (i; vehanen et al. 2003; jones & tonn 2004), obstacles (o; kruse et al. 1997), presence of roads (r; scrimgeour et al. 2008), presence of other salmonid species (b; byorth & magee 1998) and combinations of these feature types. we used logistic regression to fit candidate models to data collected for each variable and presence (1)/ absence (0) of arctic grayling used as the response variable. akaike’s information criteria (aic) values for each candidate model were corrected for small sample size (aicc) (burnham & anderson 2002) and used to rank landscape and field site models sep- arately. akaike weight (wi) was calculated to assess support for top models in each model set. when top competing models had similar support, daicc was <2, a model was calculated using the wi and infer- ences were made using the new model (burnham & anderson 2002). regression coefficients (b) and standard error terms were calculated for each variable to evaluate the components of each model. variance inflation factors (vifs) were examined to assess model for potential multicollinearity, which may influence coefficients and error terms (o’brien 2007). temperature variables and elevation were evaluated for potential nonlinear relationships by fitting models with the individual variable and comparing fit to models with the quadratic variable. due to better fit, elevation was included as a qua- dratic in the field site models. covariates area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve is typically calculated to evaluate pre- dictive ability of logistic regression models (pearce & ferrier 2000); however, data in our study do not rep- resent true absence, limiting reliability of interpreta- tion for roc scores when making predictions (bozek & hubert 1992; dunham et al. 2003). valida- tion of top models therefore was evaluated using a k-fold cross-validation procedure for five random subsets of data, and a spearman’s rank correlation (rs) was produced for each subset with a significance table 1. summary of corrected akaike’s information criteria (aicc) ranking and aic weight (wi) of landscape models for arctic grayling occurrence in the williston watershed (n = 97;

r founda- tion for statistical computing, vienna, austria) and stata statistical software (version 9.2; statacorp, college station, tx, usa). results landscape model watersheds used in the analysis of juvenile arctic grayling landscape analysis ranged considerably in size (stream order from 1 to 8; watershed area from 2.3 to 19024.1 km2). grayling were present in 42% of the 97 watersheds. there was no evidence of col- linearity between the variables (vif < 10); therefore, all of the original ecologically plausible candidate models were included in the analysis. the top two ranked landscape models had aicc weights (wi) of 0.678 and 0.245, respectively (table 1). stream order was the only variable in the top model and appeared to be the most ecologically plau- sible with the highest wi and low standard error for all parameters (table 2). the second-ranked model contained stream order and watershed area, but did not perform better than the simpler model with only stream order. watershed area had a very low coeffi- cient (table 2). in addition, the daicc from the top- ranked model was 2, the aic penalty for adding an additional variable, indicating that the second-ranked model explained no more variation than the simpler top model. the model with only stream order there- fore was selected as the best landscape model; how- ever, the k-fold cross-validation analysis suggested that the model had very low predictive ability for the occurrence of juvenile arctic grayling in the willis- ton watershed (rs = 0.298, p = 0.351). the data sug- gest juvenile grayling are likely to be absent from small systems (so < 4), but they may be pres- ent or absent in the larger systems (so ≥ 4), making the model’s predictive ability weak for larger rivers (fig. 2). that field site model study sites were in watersheds that ranged in size from approximately 2.3 to 6921.2 km2, and sites were located on rivers that ranged in stream order from 2 to 8. eight of the initial 65 study sites were not included in the analysis because temperature data from loggers were lost. arctic grayling were present in 47% of remaining 57 sites. there was little collin- earity between field site variables used in this analy- sis considered candidate models were included in the analysis.

beecher et al. 1988; rieman & mcintyre 1995; williamson & zimmerman 2004). stream order is an indicator of stream size and is related to a number of physical characteristics of a stream (i.e., width, depth and dis- charge). it is relatively easy to determine from topo- graphic maps and often used to identify occurrence of salmonid species in a system (rieman & mcintyre 1995). increasing stream order has been associated with increased species diversity and fish abundance (platts 1979; beecher et al. 1988). the predictive ability of our model with stream order was poor, however, suggesting restricted utility for predicting grayling occurrence. juvenile grayling were absent from sites with small stream order (<4), but were both present and absent in large stream order sites (≥4). inferences therefore can be made about arctic grayling absence from small-order streams, but this model cannot be used to predict arctic grayling occurrence in larger streams. such a finding does not discount the influence of watershed scale habitat fea- tures on arctic grayling occurrence because it is pos- sible that arctic grayling are sensitive to indirect watershed differences or differences that we did not measure. watershed area was present in the second-ranked landscape model combined with stream order, but explained no more variation than the simpler model with stream order alone. previous studies on other stream dwelling salmonids suggested that presence was positively and significantly associated with watershed area (rieman & mcintyre 1995; porter et al. 2000). a difference in preference among salmo- 390 nid species may account for a weak relationship with watershed area in our study. alternatively, predictive ability of watershed area identified in other studies may have been due to collinearity with field site vari- ables. in our study, the majority of watersheds (81%) were small (<1000 km2) and lack of larger water- sheds also likely limited predictive ability of the sec- ond-ranked model. streams there are several factors that could account for the poor predictive ability of our landscape models. although arctic grayling prefer lower velocities and shallower gradient (mcphail & lindsey 1970), the majority of watersheds in our study area had intermediate average stream gradients, low maxi- mum gradients (<2.6%) and minimum gradients and were commonly zero, indicating a lack of watersheds with overall high gradients. the distribution of sal- monid species (porter et al. 2000; paul & post 2001) including grayling (scrimgeour et al. 2008) has also been associated with low elevation and low stream gradient at local habitat scales, but arctic gray- ling were both present and absent over the entire range of stream elevations in the study area (671– 2820 m). barriers to movement fragment fluvial fish popula- tions (novinger & rahel 2003) and migration barrier density was expected to affect grayling occurrence. density of barriers in our study area, however, was generally low (0.02  0.03 barrierskm  2), limiting our ability to test the effect on grayling occurrence. road construction and stream crossings have also been shown to significantly influence occurrence of salmonids (bozek & hubert 1992; paul & post 2001; scrimgeour et al. 2008), but we identified that these variables were poor predictors of arctic grayling occurrence in the williston watershed. road densities and stream crossings were similar in watersheds where arctic grayling were present and absent, indi- cating that in the williston watershed did not influence grayling pres- ence. the level of linear development field site the site-specific analysis sought to explore small- scale attributes that predict occurrence for arctic grayling in the williston watershed. our model showed that position within, and being in a large river system, were more important variables than the site-specific measurements. distance from the reser- voir (sdr) has not previously been measured as an environmental variable affecting salmonid habitat selection, yet the williston reservoir has a major influence on arctic grayling distribution. gillnet and trawl-net surveys failed to capture grayling in the williston reservoir (sebastian et al. 2003) and otolith emergence, microchemistry analysis identified no signature corre- sponding to the reservoir (clarke et al. 2007), indi- cating grayling do not use the reservoir. the significance of sdr and so variables suggests that fluvial fish require considerable habitat downstream of locations where they are commonly found – poten- tially for critical life-history stages. grimardias et al. (2012) identified a positive correlation between drift density and water discharge for european grayling (t. thymallus) trapped ~0.15–4 km downstream just after suggesting passive movement. young arctic grayling have also been documented to move downstream and tend to be concentrated in the lower sections of rivers during the first year of life (kaya 1991; bradford et al. 2008) leading to segrega- tion in streams according to size and age during the summer months (hughes 1999). using otolith ele- mental chemistry signatures to trace movement of arctic grayling, a pattern of movement downstream in the early stages of development and subsequent return to upstream locations of older fish has been observed (clarke, a.d., telmer k.h. & shrimpton, j.m., unpublished data). our model indicated that juvenile arctic grayling occurrence increases with stream size and shorter tributaries (<60 km) are less likely to be used by juvenile arctic grayling. even if suitable habitat is available in shorter river systems, juvenile grayling may be precluded. although lower order streams in large watersheds are not used by juvenile arctic grayling based on our model results, these low-order stream systems may be used by gray- ling at some other point during their life history. for juvenile grayling, movement downstream to suitable fluvial habitat during the first year of life appears important. it is not known what will happen to juve- niles that move downstream if the lower reaches of the rivers are flooded, but we speculate that they will be lost from the population. arctic grayling occurrence was also negatively associated with higher average stream temperatures and increased daily water temperature variance. water temperature has a direct effect on behaviour, physiol- ogy and ecological interactions of salmonids, and average and maximum stream temperatures have been shown to influence distribution (lohr et al. 1996; porter et al. 2000; dunham et al. 2003; johnstone & rahel 2003). daily stream temperature variance, how- ever, has not commonly been investigated in habitat selection models. we identified that daily stream tem- perature variance influenced arctic grayling occur- rence. streams typically undergo daily variation in temperature, and magnitude of this variation is usually associated with stream size and/or nature of headwa- ters (thomas et al. 1986; macdonald et al. 2003). in our study, daily water temperatures fluctuated up to 14.8 °c in low-flow summer months and afternoon effect of reservoir formation on a fluvial species maximum temperatures reached up to 23.0 °c. if stream temperatures exceed upper lethal temperatures, large daily variation in temperature will also expose fish to cooler temperatures that may spare them from the deleterious effects of high temperature as seen in cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus clarki; johnstone & rahel 2003). arctic grayling from the big hole river, montana, had upper incipient lethal temperatures of 23 °c when acclimated at 16 and 25 °c when accli- mated at 20 °c (lohr et al. 1996). it is therefore unli- kely that the maximum water temperature limited arctic grayling in the study area and high-temperature variations would not benefit them in this environment. in fact, juvenile coho salmon (o. kisutch) were stressed when exposed to large fluctuations in diel temperatures (6.5–20 °c) based on elevated levels of plasma cortisol and glucose (thomas et al. 1986). average temperatures during the summer in the study area ranged from 6.9 to 16.4 °c; however, the majority of sites had intermediate temperatures (11.61  1.48 °c). preferred temperature for arctic grayling from southern williston tributaries deter- mined in an experimental tank system where the ani- mal freely ‘shuttled’ between two subcompartments with opposite acting controls (loligo systems) was found to be 16.8  0.7 °c (hawkshaw 2011). con- sequently, avet was considerably less than the pre- ferred temperature. the preferred temperature for grayling was also greater than the daily maximum temperature for most of our study sites (13.11  1.89 °c). arctic grayling, however, were present at the study site with the highest daily maximum tem- perature (17.6 °c). this suggests that other factors are affecting occurrence and our model indicates that the most notable variables are the influence of the reservoir and the daily temperature variance. habitat variables traditionally used to predict pres- ence/absence of stream fish were also evaluated (bal- lard & shrimpton 2009). interestingly, several of the traditional candidate models were considered poor predictors of occurrence of arctic grayling in the study area. given that there is a lack of information on the unique habitat requirements for fluvial arctic grayling populations in the study area, it is possible that arctic grayling in the williston watershed do not respond to these variables. some variables from the poorly ranked models (water quality variables other than temperature) did not differ greatly across study sites, and the lack of effect on arctic grayling occur- rence is likely a result of sampling over a narrow range of measurements for these variables. modelling limitations in this study, we conducted a single-pass electrofish- ing or seine net survey at each field site and cross- 391 hawkshaw et al. referenced the survey results with previous sampling records to establish arctic grayling presence or absence. there were no previous fish sampling records for 22 (39%) of the final field sites used in the analysis, and arctic grayling were determined to be absent from 16 (28%) of these sites by single-pass electrofishing surveys. further confirmation of arctic grayling absence would increase our confidence in the top models identified. additionally, data used to determine presence and absence from williamson & zimmerman (2004) and from our sampling tended to target juveniles and small species. consequently, our models do not reflect habitat use by adult arctic grayling. as arctic grayling segregate in streams dur- ing the summer based on size and age (hughes 1999), we cannot conclude that smaller and lower order streams are not important habitat for other life stages of arctic grayling. the focus of our study on juveniles, however, represents an important contribu- tion to understanding habitat needs for the critical juvenile life stage. presence/absence regression models are commonly used to predict species occur- rence, there are limitations. one thing to consider in presence/absence models is the correct designation of absence (bozek & hubert 1992; dunham et al. 2003). presence can often be confirmed at a location, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to confirm absence. absence may be the result of failing to detect a species that is actually present. in this study, the top models were validated by subsampling the original data set and testing the predictive ability on each subset – limiting our confidence in applying the top models locations because they may have different environmental gradi- ents. additionally, aic only identifies the top pro- posed models, although this approach has been shown to be preferable to other methods such as step- wise regression (whittingham et al. 2006). to different geographical although logistic management implications the creation of the williston reservoir flooded a large portion of a major river system in northern british columbia. because fluvial arctic grayling in the area do not use the reservoir, these populations lost large stretches of fluvial habitat. both scales of analysis, landscape and site specific, identified the size of a stream system as an important influence on the occurrence of juvenile arctic grayling in the willis- ton watershed. although the top landscape model did not validate well and had low predictive ability, it indicated a higher probability of juvenile arctic gray- ling occurrence in large streams. the field site analy- sis results suggest in the summer months, juvenile arctic grayling are likely to be present in that 392 sites further away from the williston reservoir in large streams with low daily temperature and temper- ature variance. overall, both analyses suggest a simi- lar finding: large systems are needed for juvenile arctic grayling to be present throughout the williston watershed. the negative association of juvenile arctic gray- ling occurrence with temperature variables identified in the field site analysis further supports the need to protect large streams as important habitat. large streams are less vulnerable to heat loading due to their higher thermal capacity and exhibit less daily variation in temperature (caissie 2006). conservation and management efforts to benefit juvenile arctic grayling populations therefore would be most effec- tive if existing areas with the characteristics of large stream systems and low daily temperature variance in the summer months were identified. temperature var- ies in natural aquatic systems but it may also be altered directly or indirectly by anthropogenic activi- ties (webb et al. 2008), and our work suggests that management decisions made to prevent warming and increases in variance of summer temperature would benefit arctic grayling populations. river systems impacted by hydroelectric developments are seldom limited to only one disturbance, and resource extrac- tion such as forest harvesting and mining could exac- erbate temperature changes. an effect of timber removal is warmer water temperatures and greater daily temperature variation (macdonald et al. 2003) – a response that our analysis indicates would nega- tively affect grayling. protection of riparian vegetation adjacent to streams (or tributaries flowing into these streams) therefore is a mitigation practice that could protect watersheds where arctic grayling are present. artificially, low flows may also increase water tem- peratures by increasing the area of air–water interface per unit volume of water (webb et al. 2008). the cumulative effect of multiple anthropogenic distur- bances, however, this reason, further disturbances such as extraction of water, clear-cut practices and habitat loss through additional hydroelectric developments should be minimised. is not known. for acknowledgements we thank dr. tom johnson, elizabeth miller, brian black- man, ray pillipow, arne langston, randy zemlak and adrian clarke for their
