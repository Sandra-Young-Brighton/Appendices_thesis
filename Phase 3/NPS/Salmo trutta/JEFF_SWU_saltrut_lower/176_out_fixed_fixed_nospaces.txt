ecology of freshwater fish 1997: 6: 95-101. 0 munksgaard, 1997 abstract - large piscivorous fish are assumed to affect habitat selection and food intake of prey fish. to study the effects of cannibalistic arctic charr, saivefinu.7 a@nzds (l.), on smaller stunted charr, we sampled the prey fish in littoral and pelagic habitats using gill nets, before and shortly after the release of large charr in a small lake (0.52 kmz). in the habitats where the risk of predation was highest, the catch per unit effort de- creased from 13.3 to 4.8 fish per 100 mz of gillnet after release of pred- ators. the large decrease in numbers of charr <18 cm corresponded with the predicted vulnerable prey sizes, according to a model based on the size distribution of predators. the occurrence of planktivorous fish and weight-specific food intake decreased in the high risk habitat and re- mained unaffected in the low risk habitats. changes in the food intake of prey fish could not be explained in terms of fish length, indicating that prey fish changed diet when the risk of predation was high. b. damsgird', 0. ugeda12 'norwegian college of fishery science, university of tromse, 'department

vorory plays a crucial role in the regulation of fish populations (ricker 1954; fox 1975; smith & reay 1991). in addition to increasing prey mortality, pis- civorous fish affect habitat selection and food intake of the prey, by influencing where prey feed, when they feed, how they feed, and how much time they allocate for feeding (milinski & heller 1978; dill & fraser 1984; metcalfe et al. 1987; huntingford et al. 1988, l'abec-lund et al. 1993). on the population level, the risk of predation may reverse the outcome of both interspecific (person 1991) and intraspec- ific competition (damsgard & langeland 1994). prey fish have to make behavioral trade-offs be- tween foraging gains and predation risk (lima & dill 1990). because prey vulnerability depends on gape sizes of the predator and body sizes of the prey, it is assumed that these trade-offs are size-depend- ent. for example, large invulnerable bluegill sunfish, lepomis macrochivus rafinesque, chose habitats that maximized foraging return, whereas smaller vulnerable sunfish changed habitats in the presence of piscivorous largemouth bass, micropterus salmo- ides (lackpkde) (werner et al. 1983). despite that ef- fects of piscivorous predators are well known in freshwater systems, few whole-lake experiments have been conducted to measure the relative changes in habitat selection and food intake when risk of predation increases. a major question of in- terest is whether prey fish constantly evaluate the risk of predation, and change behavior accordingly. to study the change in habitat selection and food in- take in response to predation risk, we released large arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus (l.), in lake kven- vikvatn, northern norway, and measured fish size and food intake of arctic charr prey in littoral and pelagic habitats with high and low risk of predation, compared with before release of predators. study area the study was carried out in lake kvenvikvatn, an oligotrophic lake in northern norway (69"

m; secchi-disc depth 10 m; fig. 1). the lake has a large population of arctic charr, stunted in growth at a maximum size of 20 cm (damsgtird & ugedal, unpublished data). the annual harvest of arctic charr in the lake is low, because of small fish sizes and poor fish quality. the only other fish species in the lake is the three-spined stickleback, gastero- steus aculeatus l. no cannibalistic charr have been reported in lake kvenvikvatn. material and methods large arctic charr from the local hals river stock (n=20,48.7?0.9 cm, 1506294 g [mean2se]) rear- ed at talvik research station, were released in lake kvenvikvatn on 7 september 1994 (fig. 1). the charr population in lake kvenvikvatn was sampled on two occasions: once before the release of predators ( 6 7 september 1994) and once after the release (8-9 september 1994). we sampled at a littoral and a pelagic station in the basin close to the release site of the predators (fig. 1; hrl and hrp), whereas the other stations (lrp and lrl) were located in the other basin, hereafter denoted as littoral and pelagic high and low risk habitats, respectively. based on previous experience with re- lease of predators, we assumed that the stations closest to the release site had the highest perceived predation risk, 96 catch per unit effort (cpue) was calculated as numbers of fish per 100 m2 gillnet per night. total length, weight and stomach content were obtained from all sampled charr. the stomach contents of each fish was categorized as consisting of predom- inantly planktonic food, benthic, surface or three- spined stickleback. stomach contents (except for stomachs containing sticklebacks) were dried in 48 h at 60Â°c, and weight specific food intake (fi) was expressed as mg dry weight food per g fresh weight of fish (mg dw - g-' fw). relative vulnerability of charr prey was calcu- lated after a model based on gape sizes of the pred- ators and body depths of the prey (hambright et al. 1991, damsgiird 1995). gape sizes (g, mm) of the predators were calculated from fish total length (tlpred, cm) according the formula g= (r2=0.85, p<o.o01, ~1=157; 0.999xtlp,,d-8.523 damsgiird 1995) and lateral body depths (or maxi- mum body heights) of the prey were measured at the anterior end of the dorsal fin using a calliper. assuming that all prey fish with body depths less than or equal to half of the predator's gape size can be eaten (damsgird 1995), the relative prey vulnerabilities (v) for a particular body depth (bd) could be calculated as: vbd= 1 --x g, where to in the littoral habitats (hrl and lrl) we used two chains with five 25x1.5 m bottom gillnets (10, 12.5, 16, 19.5 and 24 mm mesh size) at each sta- tion. one chain was set in shallow waters (less than 2 m), while the other chain was set deeper than the secchi-disc depth (more than 10 m). in the pelagic habitats (hrp and lrp) we used one chain with 25x6 m floating gillnets with the same mesh-sizes as the littoral nets at each station, g is the frequency of gape sizes of the released predators, and g is the cumulative frequency of gape sizes. relative vulnerability varies between 0 and 1 for each body depth. for all body depths smaller than the smallest gape size, vbd=l, whereas vbd=o for all body depths larter than the largest gape size. assuming a random encounter between pred- ators and prey, the probability (p) for a certain size group of prey of being caught by a predator could be calculated as: p= vbdrxd, where r is a constant (0.8) used to incorporate increasing consumption as a function of predator size, and d is the fre- quency of body depths in the prey population (hambright et al. 1991). the probability is ex- pressed as a proportion of the prey population. all values are reported as meanskstandard error of the mean (se). differences in fish length were investigated by r-test, and differences in fre- quency of plankivorous fish were tested with pear- son chi-square. differences in weight-specific food intake were investigated by use of 3-way anova with fish length as covariate. the three main effects were: predator (before, after); habitat (littoral, pel- agic) and risk (high, low), and a posteriori tukey- kramer tests were used to identify significant dif- ferences between classes. mann-whitney u-test were used for pairwise comparisons. a probability level less than 0.05 was considered as significant. results before the release of large arctic charr in lake kvenvikvatn, all sizes of charr were caught in both littoral and pelagic habitats (fig. 2), eating a wide range of food items, including planktonic species such as bosmina longispina miiller, daphnza cristata sars, eudiaptomus graciloides lilljeborg, cyclops scutifer sars and bythotrepes longirnanus leydig, and other food items such as garnrnarus lacustris sars, lyrnnuea sp., trichoptera spp., chi- ronomidae spp., eurycercus lamellatus muller, siulis iutaria l., terrestrial insects and three-spined sticklebacks. in all habitats, zooplankton was the most dominant food, with 72 to 86% of the fish having a diet dominated by planktonic food items (fig. 3). after the release of large arctic charr, cpue predation risk in arctic charr decreased from 13.3 to 4.8 fish in the littoral high- risk habitat (table 1). the decrease was especially pronounced for charr less than 18 cm (fig. 2a, e). cpue and the numbers of small charr also de- creased in the pelagic habitats after the release of predators (table 1, fig. 2f, g), whereas cpue slightly increased in the littoral low-risk habitat (table 1). the length of fish in the low-risk littoral was significantly smaller (t-test, p<0.05) after re- lease (17.1k0.5 cm, n=90; fig. lh) compared to before release (18.7k0.4 cm, n=79; fig. 2d). the size of the fish disappearing from the high- risk littoral habitat corresponded with the size of vulnerable prey according to the gape size of the predators. body depth (bd, mm) of charr in lake kvenvikvatn corresponded with fish total length (tl,,, cm) according to the linear regression: bd= 1.790xtlp,,+0.319 (r2=0.88, p<o.ool, n= lls), and mean body depth was 18.1% of fish length. relative vulnerability decreased from a body depth of 16 mm ( vb~=i6=l) to a body depth of 24 mm (vbd,,,=0) (fig. 4a). in the littoral high-risk habitat, we caught charr with body depths down to 18 mm before the release of pred- ators. after the

high-risk littoral habitat (fig. 3a), decreased significantly (pearson x2=5.9, p<0.05) from 84% (n=47) to 69% (n=18) in the pelagic high-risk habitat (fig. 3b), and increased slightly in the low-risk

littoral high-risk habitat (fig. 3e), while changes in other habitats were not significant (fig. 3f, g, h). the presence of predators significantly affected the weight-specific food intake (3-way anova with length as covariate, table 2), both for all fish together (p<o.ol) and for planktiv- orous fish only (p<o.ool). fish length significantly affected the food intake, but the change in the food intake in fish from the littoral high risk habitat could not be explained as an effect of the change in fish length before and after the release of the predators. the interactions between the presence 98 of predators and the risk, and the interaction be- tween predator, risk and habitat were significant, while other interactions were non-significant (table 2). food intake were significantly different in the high risk littoral habitat before and after the release of predators, both for all fish together and planktivorous fish only (tukey-kramer, p<0.05 and p<o.ol), while differences in other habitat were nonsignificant. the present study demonstrated that increasing risk of predation had immediate effects on habitat table 1. numbers of fish caught and catch per unit

selection and food intake by arctic charr. in gen- eral, prey fish may detect and avoid predators both by visual stimulus (dill & fraser 1984; metcalfe et al. 1987; gotceitas & godin 1991), chemical stimulus released from predators (rehnberg & schreck 1987; martel & dill 1993), chemosensory detection of alarm pheromones released from prey frightened or eaten by predators (smith 1992) or vibrations and sounds from the movement of pred- ators (blaxter 1986). there are no reports of alarm signals in salmonids (smith 1992), and in the pres- ent study, visual stimuli from predators are ex- pected to be the most important for detection of predation risk. our study indicated that prey fish during a short period of time have information of the predation risk and are able to respond in accordance with their relative vulnerability. piscivorous fish are gen- erally prey size selective, and prey fish of cannibal- istic arctic charr increase with increasing predator size (l'abee-lund et al.' 1992, damsgird 1995, amundsen 1995, amundsen et al. 1995). the dis- appearance of charr less than 18 cm from the high- risk habitats corresponded well with the size of vulnerable prey. according to the model, larger fish are less susceptible to predation, and thus take larger risks in front of a predator. however, johns- son (1 993) demonstrated that large rainbow trout, oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum), were more risk- prone than small trout, without any differences in mortality rates, indicating that other factors may also affect risk-taking behavior. in addition to the reduction in food intake in the high-risk habitat, we found a reduction in the frequency of fish with zooplankton as dominant prey, indicating that the presence of predators in- duced a shift in foraging behavior. the effects on habitat selection and food intake in the present study correspond with previous empirical data of predator-prey interactions, both in laboratory studies (metcalfe et al. 1987; huntingford et al. 1988; magnhagen 1988; pettersson & bronmark 1993) and field experiments (he & kitchell 1990; werner et al. 1983; brabrand & faafang 1993; damsgird & langeland 1994). for example, parr of atlantic salmon, salmo_salar l., in laboratory flume tanks, move from exposed areas to sheltered areas after a short presentation of a model trout, followed by a reduction in food intake (metcalfe et al. 1987; huntingford et al. 1988). stocking with large pike, esox lucius l., resulted in a decrease in the prey populations due to emigration within few weeks after release of predators (he & kitchell 1990). piscivorous perch, perca fluviatilis l., affected the recruitment of crucian carp, carassius carassius (l.) and change habitat selection of juv- enile carp, while surviving carp rapidly achieved large invulnerable body sizes (tonn et al. 1992). a decrease in the number of prey fish was evident after a release of large zander, stizostedion luciop- erca (l.), eating roach, rutilus rutilus (l.), drasti- cally decreasing the density of pelagic juvenile roach (brabrand & faafang 1993). a recent study with large brown_trout, salmo_trutta l., released in a lake with slow growing, small-sized arctic charr, demonstrated that predators modify the prey population structure in such a manner that sur- viving prey increase their growth, probably due to reduction in intraspecific competition. two years after the trout release, the numbers of charr had decreased significantly, while mean body length of the charr increased (damsgird & langeland 1994). the relative willingness to predator exposure var- ies between species, between populations and be- tween individuals within a population (magnhagen 99 damsghd & ugedal .d t cu 0 " 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28

each size group to be eaten by the predators. 1988; bugert & bjornn 1991; abrahams & healey 1993). body size is obviously an important factor affecting risk-taking behavior (werner et al. 1983; hambright et al. 1991; johnsson 1993; damsgird 1995), but in addition, factors such as hunger, sex, maturation and life strategies will also affect the trade-off between food acquisition and predator avoidance (gilliam & fraser 1987; magnhagen 1988; abrahams & dill 1989; gotceitas & godin 1991; pettersson & bronmark 1993). interspecific competition is reported to change the depth distribution of arctic charr (langeland et al. 1991). risk of predation may as well affect depth distribution (power 1984), and some of the vulnerable arctic charr in the current experiment may have migrated to the profundal zones, or to the low risk littoral habitat. alternatively, the pres- ence of predators in lake kvenvikvatn influenced the activity of potential prey fish, making it less likely that they were caught in our gillnets. corre- spondingly, tadpoles responded behaviorally to the 100 presence of predators by reducing activity and al- tering spatial distribution (shelly & werner 1990; werner 199 1). experimental evidence of size-dependent trade- offs are mainly conducted under controlled labora- tory conditions. by contrast, field experiments have several elements of uncertainty, and we can however not exclude that the first sampling of fish in lake kvenvikvatn affected the sampling after the release of predators. however, the sampling procedures are not likely to affect the differences between the habitats. during the second sampling period, one of the predators was caught in a gillnet at the high risk littoral habitat, and it is reasonable to assume that the risk of predation actually was highest close to the release site of the predators. in addition, the decrease in food intake could not be explained in terms of fish size, indicating that prey fish change both habitat and food intake in the presence of predators. however, the present study represents a short-term reaction of predation-risk, and does not necessarily reflect a long-term anti- predator behavior. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated the influence of predation risk on habitat selection and food intake and indicated the relationship be- tween the size of the predator and the size of the prey. the practical application of the study is the development of general models of predator-prey interactions in order to regulate the numbers of unwanted fish in freshwater systems.
