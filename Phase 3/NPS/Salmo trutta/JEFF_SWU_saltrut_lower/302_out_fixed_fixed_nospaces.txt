microhabitat availability and use by adult and young-of-year (yoy) snail darters (percina tanasi etnier 1976) while snorkelling in the french broad and hiwassee rivers, tn, usa. both age groups of snail darters disproportionately used most microhabitat variables compared to their availability. snail darters primarily occupied moderately deep, swift water over gravel substrates with little macrophyte coverage and no silt. univariate comparisons indicated that adult and yoy darters occupied different habitat, but there was no marked differences between principal components analysis plots of multivariate microhabitat use within a river. although the availability of microhabitat variables differed between the french broad and hiwassee rivers, univariate means and multivariate plots illustrated that the habitats used were generally similar by age groups of snail darters between rivers. because our observations of habitat availability and use were constrained to low ﬂow periods and depths <1 m, the transferability of our results to higher ﬂow periods may be limited. however, the similarity in habitat use between rivers suggests that our results can be applied to low-normal ﬂow conditions in other streams. m. j. ashton1*, j. b. layzer2 1tennessee cooperative fishery research unit, tennessee technological university, po box 5114, cookeville, tn 38501, usa, 2u.s. geolog-

especially the darters (percidae: etheostomantinae), of the southeastern united states is among the most diverse, yet most imperilled fauna in north america (warren et al. 1997). the high rate of imperilment has been attrib- uted to nonpoint source pollution, ﬂow alteration, habitat loss, and fragmentation (miller et al. 1989; benke 1990; richter et al. 1997). the tennessee river drainage has high ﬁsh species diversity and endemism, but is also among the most physically altered systems in usa (etnier 1997). the remaining lotic habitat in the mainstem and major tributaries is primarily within the relatively short tailwaters. fish have complex relationships with their habitat that are often poorly understood (hubert & rahel 1989), though determin- ing habitat requirements has become a common strategy in rare species protection and recovery (freeman & freeman 1994). differences in microhab- itat use among ﬁsh species and their populations can result from differences in size, age, utilisation and partitioning of resources, risk of predation, and habitat availability (schlosser 1987, 1988; freeman & free- man 1994; stauffer et al. 1996; freeman et al. 1997; grossman & ratajczak 1998; welsh & perry 1998; rosenberger & angermeier 2003; skyﬁeld & gross- man 2008). understanding the habitat use of a species throughout ontogeny is particularly important because early life stages of ﬁsh are vulnerable to environmental perturbations, and recruitment often is associated with ﬂow regimes (schlosser 1985; scheidegger & bain 1995; mion et al. 1998; freeman et al. 2001; sim- mons et al. 2008). habitat use by many darters is known (page 1983), but the microhabitat of snail darters, percina (imos- toma) tanasi etnier, has not been studied. the snail darter is a federally threatened ﬁsh endemic to the upper tennessee river basin (etnier 1976). while infamous among imperilled species, most information on snail darter ecology exists outside of published literature and pertained to the population in the little doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00442.x 609 ashton & layzer tennessee river prior to its extirpation (etnier 1976; starnes 1977; hickman & fitz 1978). general accounts of other imostoma darters have noted habitat as swift gravel shoals, an early spawning period (february–april), and downstream drift of pelagic, phototaxic larvae (etnier & starnes 1993; pﬂieger 1997). starnes (1977) hypothesised swift gravel shoals in the little tennessee river below chilhowee dam deﬁned adult snail darter distribution. large, repro- ducing populations of snail darters currently exist in two widely separated, regulated tributaries to the tennessee river, the french broad and hiwassee rivers. small populations of snail darters exist in ﬁve additional streams (ashton & layzer 2008). most often, recovery plans for threatened or endangered species, including the snail darters (biggins & eager 1983), have not taken into account possible differ- ences in habitat use related to age, size, or population. in this article, we describe and compare summer microhabitats used by adult and young-of-year (yoy) snail darters in the french broad and hiwassee rivers during periods of minimum generation. study area hydropeaking facility )1; minimum discharge = 16.6 m3æs we conducted this study at locations that contained the greatest abundance of snail darters throughout their range; shoals in the french broad river below douglas dam and the hiwassee river below appa- lachia dam (ashton & layzer 2008). the french broad river drains approximately 13,271 km2 of the blue ridge, and ridge and valley physiographic provinces in northeast tennessee and western north carolina. we characterised microhabitat in the french broad river at one shoal that was approximately 200 m wide and 500 m long. douglas dam, located 38.6 rkm upstream from our study site, is operated as (maximum discharge = a )1) with 510 m3æs hydrographic pulses that vary in peak, duration and frequency (layzer & scott 2006). in the french broad river, dense patches of water stargrass (heteranthera dubia) and riverweed (podostemum ceratophyllum) were present. water stargrass often reached lengths >1 m and was rooted in crevices ﬁlled with sand and ﬁnes between larger substrate particles. riverweed, an epiphytic dicot found in swift currents (philbrick & crow 1983), covered gravel and cobble substrates. the hiwassee river drains approximately 6995 km2 of the blue ridge, and ridge and valley physio- graphic provinces in southeast tennessee, western north carolina and northeast georgia. appalachia dam, located at rkm 86.0, is operated primarily for recreational purposes, which typically results in daily peaks and valleys in the hydrograph (maxi- )1; minimum discharge = mum discharge = 141 m3æs 610 )1). in the hiwassee river, riverweed was 5.7 m3æs the dominant macrophyte and extensive growths occurred on gravel and cobble substrates. we charac- terised snail darter microhabitat in the hiwassee river at four consecutive shoals 28.4 rkm downstream of the dam that ranged from 50 to 100 m wide and 150 to 300 m long. in both rivers, only small portions of the stream margins are dewatered during minimum dis- charge. methods we quantiﬁed microhabitats used by snail darters while we snorkelled during three sampling periods, each 3–6 days long, from june to september 2006. snorkelling observations were made between 09:00 and 16:00 h. we divided shoals in each river into contiguous 50-m-long sections. within sections, we located potential snorkelling transects parallel to stream ﬂow at 5-m intervals across the stream. we selected sections and transects at random prior to sampling. we included all available transects in the random selection, but did not sample those with depths >1 m, unsafe ﬂow, or were along the stream margin and partly dewatered. the next randomly selected transect was chosen if the original transect could not be sampled. an optical range ﬁnder or tape measure was used to measure the distance from shore to transect location. we anchored ﬂoats at the top of transects to serve as a visual guide for the snorkeller. approximately 15 min after we placed ﬂoats, we began snorkelling from the bottom of a transect and slowly proceeded upstream towards the ﬂoat while searching for snail darters within 1 m of the centreline of travel. when a snail darter was sighted, a weighted marker was placed on the substrate precisely where the ﬁsh was ﬁrst spotted. we used two colours of weighted markers to differentiate yoy (£45 mm tl) and adult snail darters (>45 mm tl) (scott 2003). the availability and use of snail darter microhabitats were recorded concurrently with snorkelling observa- tions during periods of minimum ﬂow. to avoid adversely inﬂuencing ﬁsh behaviour, one or two data collectors maintained a distance ‡10 m behind the snorkeller and measured variables of depth (cm), water )1), predomi- column and near bottom velocity (cmæs nant substrate, macrophyte coverage and silt coverage. we measured depth using a top-setting wading rod and velocities with a marsh-mcbirney 201d portable ﬂow meter. water column velocity was measured at 0.6· depth from the water surface and near bottom velocity adjacent to the substrates surface. we visually esti- mated predominant substrate, macrophyte coverage, and silt coverage within an approximately 0.25 m2 area. substrate was classiﬁed as: sand (<2 mm), small gravel (2–32 mm), large gravel (33–64 mm), small light large cobble (129–256 mm), cobble (65–128 mm), boulder (>256 mm) and bedrock (solid surface). macrophyte and silt coverage of substrate were classiﬁed as none (0%), (1–25%), moderate (26–50%), heavy (51–75%) or complete (76–100%). measuring habitat availability with transects per- pendicular to ﬂow was not possible given the width and areas of unsafe depth or velocity at study sites. as an alternative, we placed transects parallel to ﬂow with the understanding that many darter species exhibit relatively localised home ranges (page 1983; green- berg 1991; freeman & freeman 1994; skyﬁeld & grossman 2008) and that our samples would represent nearby patches of available habitat (petty & grossman 1996). we measured available microhabitats system- atically, beginning at 2.5 m and at 5-m intervals thereafter, along a marked 50 m line attached to the data recorder and anchored at the lower end of the transect. while measuring habitat availability, we measured habitat use at every weighted marker. we considered markers the centre of the area visually estimated for predominant substrate, macrophyte cov- erage and silt coverage. we compared the availability of microhabitat vari- ables between rivers using the kolmogorov–smirnov test for depth, bottom velocity, and water column velocity, and the mann–whitney u-test for substrate, and macrophyte and silt coverage (conover 1971). we used chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt tests to compare the availability and proportional use of microhabitats by adult and yoy snail darters. mann–whitney u-tests were used to compare microhabitat use between age groups. we used principal components analysis (pca) of the correlation matrix to compare plots of multi- variate microhabitat use by adult and yoy snail darters. within each river, habitat variables were ordinated along ecologically interpretable principal component axes with eigenvalues >1 (grossman & freeman 1987). we loaded correlated habitat variables (eigenvectors £|0.50|) retained principal components. next, a polygon was drawn in the component space using the outermost available habitat scoring coefﬁcients and represented the range of multivariate habitat availability. locations of multi- variate microhabitat use by snail darters were calcu- lated using their standardised principal components’ scoring coefﬁcients. we then superimposed darter locations within the component space representing available habitat to illustrate patterns of habitat use. we conducted statistical analyses using sas v8 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa). into their results we snorkelled 85 transects from june to august 2006 (n = 12 days) in the french broad river and 77 habitat use by percina tanasi transects from june to september 2006 (n = 11 days) in the hiwassee river. mean (±1 se) snail darter observations per transect were 5.69 (2.15) in the french broad river and 3.49 (0.65) in the hiwassee river. univariate comparisons indicated that the availability of microhabitat variables differed between rivers, in spite of the fact that habitat variable means were relatively similar between rivers. the shoal at our study site in the french broad river was deeper, faster, contained larger predominant substrate, and had more macrophyte coverage than shoals in the hiwas- see river (table 1). bottom velocity and silt coverage were greater at shoals in the hiwassee river than in the french broad river. in the french broad river, the proportional use of most microhabitat variables by adult and yoy snail darters differed signiﬁcantly from microhabitat avail- ability (table 2). snail darters used depths from 10 to 81 cm, but adults and yoy were more frequently encountered at moderate depths than were available (fig. 1). most adult snail darters used bottom veloc- )1 in greater proportion than their ities £40 cmæs availability, but most yoy disproportionately used )1. young-of-year bottom velocities of 10–20 cmæs snail darters disproportionately used water column )1, while adults used velocities from 20 to 50 cmæs mean water column velocities in proportion to their availability. we observed most adults over large gravel substrate (33–64 mm), while yoy were most abun- dant over small gravel (2–32 mm). macrophytes occurred throughout much of the habitat in the french broad river; however, few snail darters occurred where coverage was >25%. both age groups almost exclusively used substrate without silt coverage. in the hiwassee river, adult snail darters used all microhabitat variables in signiﬁcantly different table 1. comparisons between the distributions (kolmogorov–smirnov test) or means (mann–whitney u-test) of

common. as in the french broad river, both age groups were observed almost entirely over silt-free substrate. in both rivers, we found some indication of habitat use by percina tanasi differential microhabitat use by adult and yoy snail darters (table 3); however, we found no evidence for distinct ontogenetic shifts in resources use. differences between microhabitat variables used by snail darter age classes were generally minimal except for water column velocity in the french broad river and depth in the hiwassee river. we used pca as a descriptive analysis with the aide of univariate results to interpret the correlated factors that microhabitat data often represent. three principal components were retained for pca of microhabitat use and availability data from the french broad river (table 4). the ﬁrst component was loaded with bottom and water column velocity, while the second fig. 2. proportion of microhabitat variables available (solid), used by adult (open), and

not paired because they did not explain the variation in microhabitat data better than the ﬁrst and third components. in the french broad river, age groups of snail darters exhibited an overlapping range of multivariate micro- habitat use that was centred within available depths and velocities, but shifted away from increasing macrophyte coverage (fig. 3). compared to adults, yoy were more concentrated in habitats representing smaller substrate and slower velocities. few darters 614 fig. 3. principal components analysis of microhabitat use by adult (open circles) and young-of-year

selection for those microhabitats. our large sample sizes undoubtedly allowed us to detect signiﬁcant, yet minor differences in habitat availability between rivers and between age groups of snail darters within rivers. however, these differences, do not suggest any clear indication of an ontogenetic shift in resource use. these results are similar to ﬁndings from studies of other small darters (greenberg & stiles 1993; skyﬁeld & grossman 2008), though larger darters can apparently exhibit a more pro- nounced shift in habitat use throughout ontogeny (rosenberger & angermeier 2003). throughout our study, we occasionally observed snail darters in close proximity to congenerics and in aggregations ‡12 snail darters. we treated individuals within aggregations as independent observations because we think it highlighted the speciﬁc habitat requirements of snail darters. for instance, snail darters appeared to avoid silt-covered substrates. although silt coverage >1% occurred at 10–20% of the area we sampled, we saw relatively few snail darters (14 of 752 observations) over silted substrate. a lack silt is likely related to ﬂushing ﬂows during peak generation periods of upstream dams. starnes (1977) found that snail darters diets were primarily composed of organisms associated with clean gravel substrates. we commonly observed snail darters feeding over clean substrates, but not in areas of high macrophyte or silt coverage. consequently, the avail- ability of food resources may be an important factor in snail darter selection or avoidance of habitat. the apparent avoidance of silt may explain the low numbers of snail darters we observed in other streams where silt covered shoals were common (ashton & layzer 2008). though macrophyte beds provide refuge from ﬂow (dodds & biggs 2002), we observed snail darters most frequently using substrate with limited macrophyte coverage. in fact, they were nearly absent over the extensive macrophyte beds in both rivers, which primarily consisted of riverweed and water stargrass. when snail darters occupied habitat with moderate or higher macrophyte coverage, the 0.25 m2 area typi- cally included the margin of a macrophyte bed adjacent to clean substrate. however, other ﬂow refugia created by shoreline irregularities, gravel bars, and to a lesser extent waterwillow (justicia ameri- cana) were used heavily by yoy snail darters in the french broad river. in the hiwassee river, slower water velocities were rarely available at the depths yoy snail darters occupied; therefore, signiﬁcant differences between velocities used and available were not identiﬁed. however, we found that depths used by yoy in the hiwassee river were shallower than those used by adults and both age groups used nearly identical depths in the french broad river. the 615 fig. 4. principal components analysis of microhabitat use by adult (open circles) and young-of-year (closed circles) snail darters in the hiwassee

heavy microhabitat use and availability data from the hiwassee river ordinated into two principal compo- nents (53% variance explained) (table 4). the ﬁrst component loaded with bottom and water column velocity, while the second component loaded with depth and macrophyte coverage. adult snail darters were primarily located in habitat containing greater depths and faster bottom velocities compared to yoy darters (fig. 4). young-of-year were depicted within a subset of the available microhabitat occupied by adults. hiwassee river snail darters of both age groups were generally absent from the component space representing very shallow depths, slow veloci- ties, and increasing macrophyte or silt coverage. in general, a similar pattern of snail darter micro- habitat use between the french broad and hiwassee rivers was illustrated by pca (figs 3 and 4), though minor differences also were apparent. both age groups of snail darters in the french broad river were present within the centre of multivariate microhabitat space, which was representative of moderate depths and velocities with less macrophyte coverage. conversely, snail darters in the hiwassee river were located within multivariate microhabitat shifted more towards the periphery of available habitats that included faster velocities, deeper water, and macrophyte and silt-free substrates. discussion in the french broad and hiwassee rivers, snail darters nonrandomly used microhabitat variables compared to their availability. the high disproportional use of some ashton & layzer absence of yoy darters from depths that adults occupied in the hiwassee river may reﬂect an inability to occupy higher velocities (matthews 1985) that were present as depth increased, rather than a habitat shift attributed to a piscivorous predator (schlosser 1987, 1988). we often observed piscivores (amblopites rupestris raﬁnesque, micropterus spp.) in close proximity to snail darters in both rivers, yet snail darters were rarely found at the shallowest depths (<27 cm) available. similarly, benthic ﬁshes do not consistently exhibit a predator-related shift in habitat use (greenberg 1991 freeman & freeman 1994; grossman & ratajczak 1998). principal components analysis illustrated a pattern of available multivariate microhabitat used by snail darters at two stages in their life. while the range of observations in multivariate plots of habitat use overlapped substantially, differences in the position and concentration of snail darter age groups were present. this highlights the usefulness of multivariate techniques to detect patterns in ecological data, which are unlikely to be discerned as independent variables (grossman et al. 1991). in both rivers, plots of multivariate microhabitat use by age groups of snail darters were concentrated within the area that con- sisted of gravel substrates free of silt and macrophyte coverage, moderate to fast ﬂow, and moderate depths. this habitat conﬁguration represents a subset of the habitat in the french broad and hiwassee rivers. although the proportional availability of microhabitat variables differed between rivers, snail darters gener- ally used comparable microhabitats. this pattern of disproportionately using available habitat within a stream, but using similar habitats among streams has also been reported for the gilt darter (percina evides (percina jordan & copeland) and bronze darter palmaris bailey) (freeman et al. 1997; skyﬁeld & grossman 2008). the amount and location of macrophyte coverage appeared to exert the greatest inﬂuence upon snail darter habitat use, as visible in the pca plots. a wide range of depths and velocities were available in both rivers; however, adult snail darters in the french broad river were centred within availability, while adults used greater depths and velocities in the hiwassee river. areas with high macrophyte coverage were associated with shallower depths in the hiwassee river. in contrast, high macrophyte coverage was associated with greater depths in the french broad river. snail darter larvae, like other members of the subgenus imostoma, are believed to be pelagic and phototaxic (etnier & starnes 1993). if so, we would expect high ﬂow events following hatching to transport larval snail darters considerable distances downstream and affect yoy recruitment. in fact, e.m. scott (unpublished data) found that high catch-per-unit-effort 616 of 1-year-old snail darters in the french broad river followed years of below normal discharge during the spawning and hatching period. likewise, the high abundance of yoy we observed in the french broad river coincided with a period of below normal ﬂow throughout the spawning and hatching period. while this high abundance of yoy was expected in the french broad river, the low abundance of yoy in the hiwassee river was a surprise because ﬂows there were also below normal during the spawning and hatching period. clearly, a better understanding of the effects of ﬂow, year class strength, and the availability of suitable habitat for snail darters is needed. as we limited observations to habitat <1 m deep and occasionally found snail darters up to that depth, that may use deeper water. since our observations of snail darters were depth-limited, the transferability of our ﬁndings to other streams is unknown (freeman et al. 1997; leftwich et al. 1997; mattingly & galat 2004). however, the similarity of microhabitat use between our two study streams suggests that our data are robust enough for use in other streams during periods of low to normal ﬂow. acknowledgements the u.s. fish and wildlife service, cookeville field ofﬁce, tennessee, provided funds for this study. we thank ben davis,
