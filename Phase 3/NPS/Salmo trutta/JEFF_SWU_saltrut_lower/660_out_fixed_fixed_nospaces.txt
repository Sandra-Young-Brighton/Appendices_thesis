habitat linkage; benthic ﬁsh; conservation; connectivity introduction the south-eastern region of the united states has a rich ﬁsh fauna with numerous species restricted to a few river systems (page & burr 2011). the conser- vation of these species and their stream ecosystems is a paramount challenge to resource managers (dud- geon et al. 2006; abell et al. 2008). the decline and bleak outlook of many species have been well documented (etnier 1997; warren et al. 1997; jelks et al. 2008), with the local extinction of many populations attributed to anthropogenic alterations of the landscape, water pollution, habitat degradation and the presence of exotic species (benke 1990; allan & flecker 1993; richter et al. 1997; dudgeon et al. 2006). benthic species (e.g., madtoms and darters) in particular are susceptible to habitat degradation, because the bottom of the stream is typically the most type (angermeier 1995). effective affected habitat management and conservation of these imperiled species will require knowledge of life history, evolu- tion and multiscale habitat associations; only then can implementation of stream restoration projects, species reintroductions, critical habitat designations and sound policy be made successfully (warren et al. 1997; fausch et al. 2002; durance et al. 2006). etheostoma cinereum is an endemic darter within the cumberland and tennessee river drainages in ala- correspondence: michael compton, natural resources management, texas tech university, lubbock, tx 79401, usa. e-mail: mike.compton@ky.gov present addresses: *kentucky state nature preserves commission, 801 schenkel lane, frankfort, ky 40601, usa  abernathy fish technology center, u.s. fish and wildlife service, 1440 abernathy creek rd., longview, wa 98632, usa 178 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00550.x bama, georgia, kentucky, tennessee and virginia (shepard & burr 1984; etnier & starnes 1993; boschung & mayden 2004; page & burr 2011). historically, e. cinereum is known from 15 stream systems, but the distribution has become fragmented and the species is sporadic and uncommon (shepard & burr 1984; powers & mayden 2002; boschung & mayden 2004), and is considered vulnerable (jelks et al. 2008). the isolation and decline of the species across its range have been attributed primarily to the degradation and loss of habitat, resulting from increased sedimentation caused by agriculture and urbanisation, and the impoundment of rivers (shepard & burr 1984; etnier & starnes 1993; powers & mayden 2002; boschung & mayden 2004). appropriate management of the species is hindered because the microhabitats associated with e. cinereum are primarily based on anecdotal observations and vary greatly (shepard & burr 1984; etnier & starnes 1993; powers & mayden 2002; boschung & mayden 2004; page & burr 2011). a comprehensive assessment of microhabitats and stream reaches used by the species is needed. the incorporation of multiple spatial scales in species distribution and habitat association studies has been beneﬁcial for the conservation of many ﬁsh species (e.g., watson & hillman 1997; heggenes et al. 1999; labbe & fausch 2000; mattingly & galat 2002). schlosser & angermeier (1995) indicated an impor- tance in understanding (i) how the interaction of ecosystem processes across spatial and temporal scales creates and maintains habitat features that support ﬁshes and (ii) the spatial variation in demographic processes, such as emigration and immigration, within lotic ﬁsh species across different hierarchical scales. such an understanding should allow resource managers to prioritise local and watershed environmental factors that enhance the persistence of a species or assemblage (schlosser & angermeier 1995; fausch et al. 2002; lowe et al. 2006). therefore, our study was designed to focus efforts within a river system that contained a relatively large population of e. cinereum, so that we could document the distribution, relative abundance and environmental resource use across stream reach and microhabitat spatial scales, and to understand the relationship between the two spatial scales. ultimately, our goal was to provide information about the spatial patterns of e. cinereum, so resource managers can direct conservation efforts in areas most likely to enhance the persistence of the species. materials and methods study area the rockcastle river is a moderate gradient, ﬁfth- order, northern tributary of the cumberland river, imperiled ﬁsh habitat associations in the headwaters of with a catchment area of approximately 2000 km2 (764 mi.2) (fig. 1). the watershed is primarily within the south-western appalachian ecoregion, with only the headwaters of the most north-western tributaries located within the interior plateau ecoregion (woods et al. 2002). the watershed is approximately 40% forest, 25% grassland, 25% urban and 10% agriculture (homer et al. 2004). the watershed, agriculture, grassland and urban landuse are more common and interspersed. the lower main- stem of the river is mostly forested and has been designated as a kentucky wild river, and is primarily within the boundaries of the daniel boone national forest. coal mining activity within the watershed was prominent, but most contemporary anthropogenic inﬂuences include silviculture, agriculture and numer- ous small communities scattered across the landscape. the mouth of the river is inundated by the backwaters of the impounded cumberland river (wolf creek dam), which ﬂuctuates seasonally and can inﬂuence the river approximately 10 river km upstream. study design biological and environmental data were collected from 30 stream reaches within the rockcastle river watershed. on the basis of the absence of e. cinereum from historical records within third-order segments or smaller of the rockcastle river, a stratiﬁed random sampling design was implemented within the fourth- and ﬁfth-order segments during the summers of 2009 and 2010. the rationale was to focus sampling efforts within stream segments likely to contain e. cinereum and to use those data for stream reach and microhabitat resource use analyses. the number of reaches within a given stream order was proportional to the total stream length of that stream order. eighteen fourth-order reaches and twelve ﬁfth-order reaches were selected following the randomisation procedures used by us epa (2006) and olsen & peck (2008). at each of the 30 stream reaches, a series of 3 · 10 m plots were surveyed during each summer (july 20 to september 20) of 2009 and 2010, for a total of 60 sample events at the reach scale and 962 plots at the microhabitat scale. the number of plots surveyed within a reach varied based on stream order. fourth- order reaches were 200 m in length and contained 13 plots, where as ﬁfth-order reaches had a length of 300 m and contained 20 plots. this design provided approximately a 10% (8–12%) subsample of each reach. the conﬁguration of the plots followed a downstream-facing, left-bank, centre, right-bank se- quence, with the ﬁrst plot located most downstream and placed randomly. longitudinal distance between each subsequent plot was 5 m upstream from the end of the previous plot. the width between the consec- 179 compton & taylor fig. 1. study area showing sample sites within the rockcastle river watershed. the major tributaries (>100 km2) are labeled. squares represent sites where ashy darters were not present and circles represent sites where ashy darters were present. utive plots varied based on the wetted stream width of a reach. coloured ﬂagging was placed along the stream bank to indicate the downstream and upstream ends of a plot. overall, ﬁsh and habitat characteristics were sampled thoroughly from all available habitats, except at depths >1.5 m. six plots located in depths >1.5 m were eliminated or moved to adjacent water (<5 m away) if depth allowed for effective sampling. seining (4.5 m · 1.8 m, 0.5 cm mesh seine) were conducted within a stream reach to enhance e. ciner- eum distributional data. all captured e. cinereum were measured for total length (tl mm) and classiﬁed as adult juvenile (<70 mm). the 70 mm cut-off point was determined based on a visual interpretation of length frequency histograms and knowledge of e. cinereum life history. (tl ‡ 70 mm) or fish sampling environmental variables darters were obtained by operating a smith-root gas- powered backpack electroﬁshing unit (50–80 hz, 200–400 volts) upstream through the designated plots. the targeted electroﬁshing duration of a plot was 150 shocking seconds, but varied based on plot habitat complexity, ﬁsh response and ﬁsh capture efﬁciency (mean = 153.4, sd = 29.2 s). one dip-netter with polarised sunglasses was used to capture stunned individuals. all specimens encountered were identiﬁed and enumerated for each individual plot. in addition to the plot sampling, supplemental electroﬁshing and physical, water quality and land cover data were obtained for each reach (appendix s1). physical data included catchment area (km2), mean stream width (m), maximum depth (m), canopy cover (<25%, 25–50%, 50–75% and >75% shading; scored 1–4, respectively), % rifﬂe, run and pool, respectively, and the habitat parameters in the u.s. epa rapid bioassessment protocol (rbp) (barbour et al. 1999). the compilation of depth and substrate data from the plot surveys were used to determine the stream reach mean depth (m) and substrate composition. nutrient and general water 180 quality samples were collected, and analyses were conducted by the kentucky division of water. a multiprobe ysi water quality meter was used to determine conductivity (microseconds per centimetre), ph, temperature (°c) and dissolved oxygen (mgæl)1) at each reach. lastly, per cent land cover for each major tributary and for the upper and lower rockcastle river mainstem corridors were obtained from the 2001 national land cover database (http://www.mrlc.gov/ nlcd01_data.php). we delineated the mainstem into lower and upper sections, with the lower rockcastle river ranging from the conﬂuence of the cumberland river upstream to the conﬂuence of skegg creek, and the upper rockcastle river extending from the skegg creek conﬂuence upstream to the conﬂuence of middle fork and south fork rockcastle river (fig. 1). land cover was classiﬁed as agriculture (cultivated crops and pasture ⁄ hay), forest (deciduous, evergreen and mixed forest), grassland (grassland ⁄ herbaceous and scrub ⁄ shrub), open water, urban (developed open space, low- intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity devel- opment, and barren land), or wetland (woody wetlands and emergent herbaceous wetlands). the b-axis (m) of a series of environmental variables were measured at designated areas within each plot to represent the available microhabitat within a reach. plots were bisected into two 3 · 5 m areas, and the pres- ence ⁄ absence (0 ⁄ 1) of justicia americana (american water willow) and large woody debris (lwd; stable woody substrate, partially embedded, and >200 mm in diameter and >1 m in length) were determined for each half. these represented other forms of natural cover that were noted as important e. cinereum habitat (shepard & burr 1984). also within each half, the largest boulder was if present. the b-axis of a rock is the measured, smallest dimension in which that particle would ﬁt through a sieve (bunte & abt 2001). in addition, a visual estimation of a ﬂow category was determined for each half as no (<0.01 mæs)1), slow (0.01– 0.3 mæs)1), swift (0.3–0.75 mæs)1), and very swift (>0.75 mæs)1) ﬂow and scored as 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively. the visual estimations were consistently made by one observer, and periodic eye-calibration was made using a ﬂow meter. substrate and depth (m) were determined at the corners and centre of each half of a plot, to provide an overall substrate composition and mean depth for the plot. substrate was determined as silt (<0.06 mm), sand (0.06– 2 mm), gravel (2–16 mm), pebble (16–64), cobble (>256 mm), hardpan mud ⁄ (64–256 mm), boulder clay and bedrock. lastly, plot location was noted as left-bank, centre or right-bank, with the plots along the margins of the channel scored as 0, inside bend (depositional zone), or 1, outside bend (erosional zone). imperiled ﬁsh habitat associations data analysis principal components analysis (pca) was used to assess the relationships among the measured environ- mental variables from both the stream reach and plot scales. the pcas (based on correlation matrices) reduced the dimensionality of the abiotic data and ordered reaches and plots along a series of complex environmental gradients that were then compared to e. cinereum presence and abundance. we used pc- ord software to conduct the pcas (mccune & mefford 1999). prior to analysis, the abundance and proportional environmental variables were trans- formed (logarithmic and arcsine square root, respec- tively) to enhance the linearity of the relationships among the variables (mccune & grace 2002; gotelli & ellison 2004). principal components (pcs) with eigenvalues >2.0 and environmental variables with axis loadings ‡ |0.50| were deemed important and retained for further analyses (ferre´ 1995). scatterplots of the measured environmental resources (pcs) and adult and juvenile e. cinereum resource use provided a visual interpretation of habitat use at both scales. we used kolmogorov–smirnov (ks) two-sample tests to statistically compare the distributions of available resources and e. cinereum resource use at the stream reach and plot scales. signiﬁcant p-values (p < 0.05) would indicate differences between the distributions being compared. we conducted kernel density estimation (kde) of the spatial occurrences to show the structure of adult and juvenile e. cinereum frequency at each scale. kde is a nonparametric probability density function that is a powerful tool for estimating multimodal or non-normal distributions (silverman 1986; seaman & powell 1996). we selected the 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 probability levels to determine the mean density of adult and juvenile e. cinereum within each kernel. we viewed the differences in probability levels as a gradient of environment quality for e. cinereum use, with the inner kernels (e.g., 0.25 and 0.50) represent- ing the highest quality of habitat. we created contin- gency tables containing the number of plots and the number of darter individuals for each of the four plot probability levels across the four reach probability levels. we used the likelihood-ratio chi-square test of independence to determine whether the proportions of the number of plots (and the number of darter individuals) the plot probability levels were homogeneous across the reach probability levels. a signiﬁcant result (p < 0.05) would indicate that the two scales were linked, such that higher quality reaches tended to have a greater proportion of higher quality plots and greater ashy darter abundances. we used systat version 13 (systat software inc. 2009) for the kde and likelihood-ratio chi-square test of for 181 compton & taylor independence. lastly, an environmental characterisa- tion of reaches and plots identiﬁed within the respec- tive 0.75 probability level kernels for adults and juveniles was made. this represented the range of core habitat used by the majority of e. cinereum. mann– whitney u-tests were used to identify speciﬁc envi- ronmental variables that were signiﬁcantly different between adult and juvenile darter use at the 0.75 probability level for each spatial scale. results etheostoma cinereum was collected at 21 reaches from 39 sample events (fig. 1). darter presence was detected at least within one plot at 18 reaches, and three reaches through supplemental sampling exclu- sively. overall, 322 individuals were encountered and ranged from 1 to 25 individuals per collection. the species was present at all of the mainstem reaches and at all of the lower reaches of the major tributaries, except for skegg creek. the mean distance from the e. cinereum tributary locations to the conﬂuence of the rockcastle mainstem was 2.7 river km (sd = 2.8), with a range of 0.5–9.5 km. although e. cinereum was present in the lower reaches in most of the major tributaries of the rockcastle river, only the most downstream locations within horse lick creek, middle fork rockcastle river and south fork rock- castle river harboured the species from year to year. however, only the most downstream horse lick creek location had a population with a mean >10 individuals per collection. the presence of the species in roundstone creek and sinking creek were the ﬁrst records from those systems. stream reach the ﬁrst three pcs met our criteria for inclusion and explained 24.6%, 14.6% and 10.1% of the variation in the original data set, respectively. however, the third pc was not considered for further analysis because only two environmental variables, catchment area and conductivity, met our criteria, and both already loaded strongly either on the ﬁrst or second pc. eighteen stream reach environmental variables were considered important contributors (table 1). the ﬁrst pc repre- sented a stream size, substrate size, habitat quality and land cover gradient, where elevation, canopy cover, % agriculture and % urban were positively associated and catchment area, maximum depth, epa rbp habitat score, % forest, % cobble, and % boulder were negatively associated. the second pc primarily represented shifts in water quality and land cover, where organic carbon, % forest and % sand were positively associated and latitude, longitude, alkalin- ity, conductivity, % grassland, % agriculture and % pebble were negatively associated. we encountered 138 adult e. cinereum at 18 reaches from 30 of the 60 reach sample events and 89 juvenile darters from 12 reaches during 19 sample events. adult and juvenile e. cinereum were present together at 10 reaches from 16 sample events. a scatterplot of pc1 and pc2 of the 60 reach sample events suggested that the presence of adult and juvenile e. cinereum was selective (fig. 2). the ks test results provided further evidence that the

associations co-occurred at 10 reaches. the kde for adult and juvenile e. cinereum in the environmental space deﬁned by pc1 and pc2 at the 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 probability levels showed that the higher quality kernels (i.e., 0.25 and 0.50) had a greater mean darter density than the lower quality kernels (i.e., 0.75 and 1.00) (table 2). two separate concentrations of adult individuals occurred in the lower rockcastle river (left-hand corner) and upper rockcastle river (centre) at the 0.25 and 0.50 probability levels (fig. 3a). at the 0.75 probability level, a group composed mostly of mainstem rockcastle river reaches and another group composed of horse lick creek and middle fork rockcastle river reaches were identiﬁed. for juve- niles, only the 0.75 probability level indicated two concentrations of juvenile darters representing reaches in the lower and upper rockcastle river mainstem (fig. 3b). the 0.75 probability level supported 94% and 88% of the adult and juvenile darters, respectively. comparison of environmental variables measured for adults and juveniles from the stream reaches identiﬁed at the kde 0.75 probability showed that the ranges of most environmental variables overlapped greatly and were not signiﬁcantly different (table 3). only alkalinity and epa rba habitat score resulted in a signiﬁcant difference between adult and juvenile darter reaches, with both variables greater at adult reaches juvenile reaches. therefore, we characterised stream reaches used by both adult and juvenile e. cinereum without distinguishing between them. these included all of the mainstem rockcastle river reaches with catchment areas >750 km2, and fourth-order reaches with catchment areas >100 km2 and close proximity (<10 river km) to the mainstem. the land cover associated with these reaches was approximately 40% forest, 25% grassland, 20% urban and <10% agriculture. the reaches contained approx- imately 12% rifﬂe, 55% run and 33% pool habitats, with

in-stream habitat quality at these reaches was good, as indicated by the epa rbp habitat scores. typically reaches included a diverse mixture of ﬂow and depth patterns, numerous habitat types with

plot (30 m2), whereas adult abundance ranged from 1 to 6 individuals per plot. adult and juvenile darter resource use highlighted within the scatterplot deﬁned by pc1 and pc2 suggested that habitat use was selective and that adult and juvenile darter habitat use was segregated (fig. 2). the ks test for pc1 conﬁrmed that the distribution of adult habitat use was nonrandom (dmax = 0.239, p <

distributions were signiﬁcantly different along pc1 (dmax = 0.210, p < 0.001). the ks test for pc2 indicated that the distribution of adult and juvenile habitat use were nonrandom and statistically

mean darter densities were greatest within the 0.50 and 0.75 kernels for adult darters. adult darters exhibited a narrower breadth of microhabitat use than juvenile darters at the 0.75 probability

bold were signiﬁcantly different between juvenile and adult darters. in 52% of those plots, and juvenile darters. adult darters were present along the margin of the stream channel in 68% of the plots, with 80% of those plots present along the outside bend of the channel, indicating a strong association along the erosional zone of the channel. juvenile darters were present along the margin of the channel in 54% of the plots and were present along the outside bend of the channel indicating no preference in channel location. although a difference in channel location was seen among adult and juvenile darters, ﬂow and depth were not statistically different (u = 1436.5, p = 0.679; u = 1507.5, p = 0.964, respectively) between the groups. flow was typically classiﬁed as ‘slow’ (0.01–0.3 mæs)1), but was occa- sionally classiﬁed as ‘no ﬂow’. the median depth for adults and juveniles was 0.33 and 0.34 m, respec- tively. substrate comparison between adult and juvenile darters showed that adult darters associated more with larger rock substrates than juvenile darters. cobble and boulder were present in 87% of the plots with adults and composed approximately 50% of the substrate. cobble and boulder were present within 86% and 50% of the plots occupied by juveniles, and was approx- imately 25% and 6% of the plot substrate composition, respectively. juvenile plots were composed of approx- imately 60% gravel, pebble and cobble substrates. furthermore, the mean largest boulder size for plots occupied by adults and juveniles was 0.73 m and 0.48 m, respectively. similarities in adult and juvenile darters association with sand, silt, bedrock and mud ⁄ clay substrates were observed, with those sub- strates typically lacking within plots and representing a small percentage (<10%) of the substrate composi- tion when present. in addition, water willow and lwd 186 were infrequently used by adult and juvenile darters. water willow was present in <10% of the plots occupied by adult and juvenile darters. the use of lwd was slightly more frequent for juveniles than adults but this habitat was present in less the 25% of plots occupied by juveniles and 15% of plots occupied by adults. discussion inherently ties framework of different conceptually, lotic systems have been viewed as a hierarchical temporal and spatial scales (e.g., frissell et al. 1986), with various physical and biological variables affecting and limiting the distribution of a species (smith & powell 1971). therefore, a species must possess the necessary traits to pass through the series of ﬁlters at the coarse scales before it can occur at a ﬁner-grained scale (smith & powell 1971; tonn et al. 1990; poff 1997). this relationship among scales them together; therefore, it would be expected that different environmental variables inﬂuence the distribution and abundance of e. cinereum across multiple spatial scales (wiens 1989; schlosser 1991; labbe & fausch 2000). in general, our study supports this concept and it is logical to view the stream reach variables as the governing factors in the distribution of e. cinereum within the rockcastle river watershed, with the microhabitats then determining within-reach distribu- tion patterns. given the hierarchical nature of ecological scaling, we suspected that the environmental quality of the stream reaches and microhabitats were linked; higher quality reaches should have a greater proportion of higher quality plots containing e. cinereum and a greater abundance of adult and juvenile individuals within them. however, our results indicated that the two spatial scales were mostly independent of each other. lower quality reaches contained plots of varying quality, as did the higher quality reaches. only the abundance of adult e. cinereum was depen- dent upon the quality of the reaches and the quality of the plots. this result supports the perception that adult darters have a narrower habitat breadth than juveniles (fig. 3c,d). in addition, our results indicated that a sufﬁcient network of suitable microhabitats within a reach is needed to support a large population of adult darters. this type of network was seen in the eight high-quality reaches identiﬁed within the 0.25 and 0.50 kernels (fig. 3a), where over half of the available microhabitat plots present were within the 0.25–0.75 kernels (fig. 3d), and contained 67% of the adult individuals. our assessment of environmental quality also revealed a threshold between the 0.75 and 1.00 reach probability levels (table 4). the number of plots and darter abundance decreased at least 48% between the two probability levels for adult and juvenile darters. these reaches supported only 6% and 12% of the adult and juvenile individuals, respectively. these results provide context into which the two spatial scales are related and explains our ﬁndings that reach quality and plot quality were mostly independent of each other. the speciﬁc quality of the plots did not necessarily matter within a reach, as long as that reach contained a certain level of ecological integrity (i.e., 0.25–0.75). ultimately, the number of plots and darter abundance were constrained by the environmental factors present outside of the 0.75 reach probability level. metapopulation theory proposes that a species (patch) will eventually go within a microhabitat extinct but can be recolonised or rescued from extinction based on species dispersal from neighbour- ing patches (hanski & simberloff 1997). within the metapopulation framework, stream reaches contain a variety of microhabitats which a species can use for life history needs and disperse among, with each microhabitat providing a level of beneﬁt and risk. therefore, the proximity and matrix of the various microhabitat qualities factor into the persistence of a population at a site. we suspect that the 0.25–0.75 probability reaches in our study had sufﬁcient and juxtaposed microhabitats to maintain persistence of e. cinereum, whereas reaches identiﬁed at the 1.00 probability level were lacking in microhabitat quantity and ⁄ or appropriate juxtaposition. therefore, those reaches might represent sinks and would not support a substantial population of e. cinereum. falke & fausch (2010) identiﬁed a similar scenario for a great plains stream ﬁsh, hybognathus hankinsoni (brassy imperiled ﬁsh habitat associations minnow), which represented a hybrid metapopulation model that incorporates both patchy and source-sink population dynamics. the general presence of e. cinereum within the rockcastle river is the result of evolution, drainage history, geological events and suitable habitats asso- ciated with the eastern highland rim and cumberland plateau physiographic regions (burr & page 1986; starnes & etnier 1986). however, we identiﬁed several environmental factors at the reach and micro- habitat scales that inﬂuence the distribution of adult and juvenile darters within the river. one of the most important limiting factors of e. cinereum at the stream reach scale was stream size. etheostoma cinereum was present in all of the mainstem sites (ﬁfth-order and catchment area >750 km2) and in the lower reaches of the tributaries (fourth-order and catchment area >100 km2) typically <3 km upstream from the rock- castle river conﬂuence. etheostoma cinereum has been documented as inhabiting small to large rivers (etnier & starnes 1993; powers & mayden 2002; page & burr 2011). we classiﬁed the rockcastle river mainstem as a medium-size river, the major tributaries as small rivers or large creeks, and the cumberland river as a large river. on the basis of the common occurrence of e. cinereum in medium-size rivers (e.g., big south fork cumberland river, ky ⁄ tn, buffalo river, tn) throughout that e. cinereum primarily inhabits medium-size rivers and is present within small rivers (e.g., buck creek, ky) and large rivers (e.g., clinch river, tn ⁄ va) occa- sionally or seasonally, as they may serve as important systems in the life history of the species. poten- tially, the large rivers could serve as a corridor for e. cinereum to move from one medium-size tributary to the next. its range, we suspect in addition to stream size, a threshold of the minimal proportion of large boulders within a stream reach was identiﬁed. etheostoma cinereum was always present in reaches when at least 20% of the plots surveyed contained at least one boulder >0.5 m b-axis, indicating the importance of large boulders and their proportion within a stream reach was critical for this species. although boulders often have been mentioned as substrate used by e. cinereum (shepard & burr 1984; etnier & starnes 1993), our study is the ﬁrst to highlight the importance of boulder size and frequency within a stream reach. several microhabitat variables inﬂuenced the distri- bution of ashy darters within a reach. adult and juvenile darters frequently occupied pool habitats, or occasionally along the margins of run habitat, with similar depths (0.20–0.80 m) and ﬂows (slow or no ﬂow). however, they were segregated within the stream reach by channel location and rock substrate preference. adults occurred more frequently along 187 compton & taylor channel margins, particularly the outside channel bend, and were mostly associated with larger substrates, such as boulder and cobble. juveniles were more evenly distributed within the channel and were associated with smaller substrates, such as gravel and pebble. in addition, adults were generally associated with boul- ders approximately 50% larger than the boulders associated with juvenile darters. we view the large rock substrates as the primary cover associated with e. cinereum. although bedrock (fractured bedrock) was not signiﬁcantly associated with e. cinereum use, we recognise its importance and similar function as cover (etnier & starnes 1993). microhabitat features such as silt, lwd and water willow often have been noted as factors associated with e. cinereum (shepard & burr 1984; etnier & starnes 1993; boschung & mayden 2004). we quantiﬁed the relative use of these substrates and put into perspective their importance in relation to other microhabitat features used by e. cinereum. we found e. cinereum occasionally associated with silt, which usually represented a small proportion of the general habitat. furthermore, e. cinereum was not present in heavily silted areas unless a large boulder (>1.0 m b- axis) was present in the immediate area, along with an adjacent clean swept benthic area. we encountered three adult individuals within this habitat combination (three plots) and those plots failed to be identiﬁed within the 0.75 probability level kde. our observa- tions support the literature (e.g., shepard & burr 1984) that limits e. cinereum persistence, and we emphasise that excessive silt is one of the principal factors detrimental to e. cinereum. silt the use of lwd or water willow as cover was ﬁrst noted by shepard & burr (1984) and has frequently been noted in subsequent works (burr & warren 1986; etnier & starnes 1993; boschung & mayden 2004). we consider these forms of cover to be secondary, as they were of minimal importance in our study. etheostoma cinereum was rarely associated with lwd when appropriate rock substrate (i.e., boulder) was present within a plot. when a boulder was absent from a plot, lwd was used, for it served as the largest stable substrate. water willow was rarely used (<10%), but we speculate that the vegetative cover may play a role in other aspects of life history not encountered during this study, such as egg attachment (etnier & starnes 1993). lastly, we are aware that the use of densities to categorise habitat quality can be misleading (van horne 1983); however, we are conﬁdent that our use of probability density functions provided a realistic separation of habitat quality. in addition, we are aware that detection of e. cinereum was mostly likely imperfect within a plot, thus providing some level false absence. the peril of not accounting for imper- 188 fect detection could be an underestimate of habitat use (mackenzie et al. 2006). even though we did not account for imperfect detection, we surveyed the 962 plots under ambient sampling conditions and are conﬁdent that our results are robust. conservation implications anthropogenic the dual-scale approach we took to assess the distribution and abundance of e. cinereum within the rockcastle river provides the foundation for two concepts that could beneﬁt the conservation of the species across its entire range. the ﬁrst concept is regionally oriented and is based on our ﬁndings that e. cinereum primarily occupies sections of medium- size rivers. we postulate that e. cinereum conforms to a nonequilibrium metapopulation model, where dis- persal capabilities and connectivity of habitats are diminished by natural or factors (harrison 1991; falke & fausch 2010). the tributaries of the cumberland and tennessee rivers can be viewed as insular systems relatively isolated from each other by the mainstem based on their spatial position within the drainages and exacerbated by the presence of impoundments (osborne & wiley 1992). within this context, the rates of colonisation and gene ﬂow among the tributaries decrease greatly, and the inﬂuence and dependency of local habitats to maintain local popu- lations increase (yan et al. 2011). in addition, viewing the insular tributaries in the framework of island biogeography theory (macarthur & wilson 1967), we suspect e. cinereum within the most isolated tributar- ies with the smallest watershed areas are at the greatest risk of local extinction. for example, the little river population of e. cinereum has been documented as being good (etnier & starnes 1993), but has declined greatly (powers et al. 2004). we suspect that coloni- sation into this system is minimal or nonexistent because of impoundments and that local habitats have degraded over time, with a resulting rapid population decrease. therefore, within this geographic frame- work, an assessment of watershed size (km2), connec- tivity and colonisation potential among the tributaries should be conducted. in addition, an assessment of the available habitat within the tributaries should be made to prioritise conservation efforts. although we did not test transferability within our study, we are conﬁdent that a strong baseline in e. cinereum habitat use was achieved and can be used cautiously in other tributaries. this should guide resource managers in watershed habitat enhancement or species augmentation efforts. restoration projects, critical for the second concept focuses on the microhabitats used by e. cinereum. our study provided strong evidence that stable rock substrates, in particular large boulders (>0.5 m), minimal silt, pool habitat and no or slow ﬂow are important variables in localised e. cinereum presence. we hypothesise that adult e. cinereum are dependent upon the hydrology within the erosional zone of the channel and on the presence of large boulders. the erosional zone contains the greatest current velocities and sheer stress within the channel during high ﬂows (rosgen 2006). during these periods of high ﬂow, material is lifted and transported downstream and is most prevalent within the erosional zone of the channel, where ﬁner substrates such as sand and silt are ﬂushed. it is this hydraulic ﬂushing mechanism that cleans the intersti- tial spaces between the larger substrates used by e. cinereum. this is important because e. cinereum frequently occurs within pool habitat and is associated with no or slow ﬂows (<0.30 mæs)1) during base-ﬂow periods. this makes pools highly susceptible to excessive sediment loads. in addition, we suggest the strong association between e. cinereum and large boulders is related to the fact that boulders are stable substrates that provide shelter against increased sus- pended material being transported downstream during rain events. we believe this hypothesis provides resource managers with a sound framework to focus endeavours in local conservation efforts, such as biological surveys, critical habitat protection and stream restoration efforts. lastly, by incorporating variables across scales, we identiﬁed and linked stream reach features and their speciﬁc microhabitats that were most likely to sustain e. cinereum. we used a suite of watershed, stream reach and microhabitat scale variables to identify patterns of e. cinereum distribution within the rock- castle river and to quantify differences between adult and juvenile darter resource managers will be able to direct conservation efforts across multiple fronts (fausch et al. 2002). for instance, managers can assess land development impacts on the species, direct stream restoration efforts to enhance critical habitats for adult darters, or identify areas that increase the survival of released propagated juvenile individuals. resource use. thus,
