varies throughout its range and is influenced by a variety of environmental variables. this study examined the spawning migration time of landlocked atlantic salmon in a small (4 ha) constructed stream linked to a large reservoir (32,600 ha) in newfoundland, canada. salmon use of the stream was passively monitored using passive integrated transponder (pit) tags from 2006 to 2012. of the salmon tagged throughout the reservoir, 48% entered the stream during the spawning season and remained there for 18–36 days from late september to november before they returned to the reservoir. most fish entered the stream at dusk (32%). the lunar cycle influenced the timing of migration each year. mean stream discharge (cubic metres per second) influenced migration timing in some years, and water temperature appeared to have minimal impact on migration timing. twenty per cent of fish migrated to the stream in multiple years and 51% of these individuals appeared to use the stream on a biennial or alternate year cycle. these results demonstrate that small constructed streams can attract salmon from throughout a large reservoir and can provide valuable habitat in areas where spawning habitat is limited. key words: constructed channel; spawning migration; landlocked salmon; restoration; regulated river introduction landlocked atlantic salmon or ouananiche (salmo_salar) in north america are distributed throughout the eastern canadian provinces as well as some u.s. states including maine, new hampshire and new york (scott & crossman 1964). in newfoundland, canada, ouananiche spawn in autumn (late september to early november) in tributary streams or rocky shorelines of lakes (cowan & baggs 1988). most individuals return to lakes shortly after spawning to overwinter (scruton et al. 1996; scott & crossman 1998). the average fork length of landlocked salmon in newfoundland varies depending on location, with reported mean fork lengths ranging from 112.5 mm (age 2 individuals, terra nova system) to 706.12 mm (age 11 individuals, exploits river system) (scott & crossman 1964). many wild salmonid populations (both anadro- mous and landlocked) have declined worldwide due to a variety of factors including anthropogenic habitat changes and subsequent reductions in the potential productivity of salmon habitats (parrish et al. 1998; sear et al. 2008; thorstad et al. 2008; limburg & waldman 2009; piccolo et al. 2012; piccolo 2015). the ultimate goal of most habitat construction or rehabilitation projects is to increase species produc- tivity, often by providing additional or improved spawning habitat. spawning channels and habitat rehabilitation projects have been constructed for many years, but the effectiveness of these projects have often been measured in terms of construction success rather than biological benefit (smokorowski et al. 1998; stewart et al. 2009). furthermore, many projects have focused on monitoring only the newly

rather than investigat- ing where fish using the new habitat originate from (the zone of influence of the new habitat). constructed streams provide a unique opportunity to explore the spatial influence of new habitats by determining how far fish travel to utilise the habitat. salmon are known to home to their natal spawning areas with precision (thorstad et al. 2008; hagelin et al. 2015). however, when spawning areas are destroyed, salmon must find and utilise new areas for spawning. the ability of salmon to find new spawn- ing habitats without stocking salmon in these habitats has not been well studied, particularly for landlocked salmon. previous studies on the riverine migration of anadromous atlantic salmon have been found to include a search phase (thorstad et al. 2008) where presumably individuals may find new spawning areas. areas of a river that salmon ‘searched’ in two different studies averaged 8 and 15 km in a large river and 1.7 and 1.4 km in other smaller rivers (okland et al. 2001; jokikokko 2002; finstad et al. 2005). studies on other salmon species have shown evidence of a search phase as well (connor & garcia 2006; keefer & caudill 2014), and a study of anadro- mous coho salmon moving into previously inaccessi- ble habitat found that exploration for new habitats is an innate part of sal- mon breeding behaviour (anderson & quinn 2007). other studies have found that streams with restoration methods put in place to improve spawning habitats have been immediately utilised by salmon, indicating that salmon can rapidly find new spawning habitats (baldigo & warren 2008; barlaup et al. 2008). the distances that salmon travel to exploit new habitats, however, is generally unknown. following dam removal found significant the environmental factors that influence the spawn- ing migration of landlocked salmon are also not well known, unlike for anadromous salmon. river dis- charge or changes in flow rates have often been consid- ered important regulating factors controlling spawning migration for salmonids although this varies greatly by species and location (banks 1969). several studies have not relationships between spawning migration and discharge (trepanier et al. 1996; dahl et al. 2004; mitchell & cunjak 2007). in regulated rivers, particularly for landlocked salmonids, discharge cues are reduced (constant flow maintained) or kept at levels not normally experienced in nature and fish in these systems may rely on other environ- mental or internal cues to initiate spawning migration. some of these external cues may include water temper- ature (dahl et al. 2004), diel period and lunar cycle (forsythe et al. 2012; warren & morbey 2012). this study examines the temporal spawning migra- tion patterns of landlocked salmon in a constructed stream and provides information on the distance that 348 salmon migrate to enter this relatively small stream from an adjacent large reservoir. the study also examines the relative proportion of reservoir salmon finding and utilising the new habitat and determines the environmental factors that may be impacting migration timing in this regulated system. the stream is a known spawning location for landlocked salmon as young-of-the-year were found in the stream during electrofishing surveys (dfo, unpublished data), and a 5-year monitoring programme confirmed the pres- ence of salmon redds (amec 2008, mccarthy & sellars 2009). study area the study area is part of a large hydroelectric devel- opment (bay d’espoir system) located in south-cen- tral newfoundland, canada, that consists of a series of adjacent reservoirs created at two different periods over 25 years beginning in the 1960s (scruton et al. 1994, 1996). the largest of these reservoirs is meel- paeg lake at 32,600 ha. before the installation of the granite canal hydroelectric facility, water flowed from granite lake through a manmade canal (granite canal) to meelpaeg lake; the confluence of the canal in meelpaeg lake was a major spawning area for sal- monids. further expansion of the existing hydroelec- tric network in the early 2000s resulted in the closure of granite canal and the creation of a hydropower plant. this construction and change in operation caused the destruction of approximately 44,400 m2 of salmonid spawning and rearing habitat utilised by adult ouananiche and, to a lesser extent, adult brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis) at the outlet of the canal (amec 2008). therefore, nalcor energy (previously newfoundland and labrador hydro) was required under canada’s fisheries act and fisheries and oceans canada’s policy for the management of fish habitat (dfo 1986) to compensate for the destruc- tion of fish habitat, and they did so in part by con- structing an artificial regulated stream adjacent to meelpaeg reservoir called compensation creek. compensation creek (fig. 1) is a low-gradient reg- ulated stream that became operational in 2003. the 1600-metre-long stream consists of a main channel, designed to provide the substrate and flow conditions suitable for salmon spawning and two side channels, designed to provide habitat for brook_trout. the main channel ranges from 15 to 20 m wide with cobble– boulder substrate and is dominated by riffle, pocket water and pool sequences. the side channels range from 5 to 8 m wide with woody debris and undercut banks, dominated by pools and runs (enders et al. 2007). revegetation of riparian areas around the stream was completed in 2007 (gabriel et al. 2010). further details on creek design and construction may be found in mccarthy & sellars (2009). to create compensation creek, a dam was built across rr pond (fig. 1). the water level in rr pond is regu- lated via a control structure (not visible in fig. 1) which in turn regulates the flow through compensa- tion creek. compensation creek was naturally populated, and all fish that utilise the stream did so by finding and entering the stream by natural straying, mostly from meelpaeg lake. likewise, all fish in meelpaeg lake spawning migration to a constructed stream reservoir originate from natural populations, and stocking has never occurred in the reservoir. prior to impoundment, meelpaeg lake was a headwater lake that was likely above the extent of anadromous salmon migration but was populated with other spe- cies including brook_trout, ouananiche, arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) and three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus). there is limited tributary spawning habitat adjacent to the reservoir with only three small tributaries, but fig. 1. top left: location of compensation creek on the island of newfoundland. top right: meelpaeg reservoir showing net locations as points. bottom: compensation creek location on the western side of meelpaeg lake showing locations of passive integrated transpon- der (pit) tag antennae and data loggers. flow in compensation creek is regulated by the water level in rr pond which in turn is regulated via a control structure (not visible on map). 349 loughlin et al. at more (2009) some shoreline spawning is expected to occur. one study estimated the size of the ouananiche population in meelpaeg lake than 30,000 [see mccarthy & sellars information on for unpublished study]. no estimates could be found for the other species. due to the remoteness of the site, low-intensity recreational fishing occurs within the system, particularly for brook_trout, but salmon fish- ing does occur within meelpaeg lake and near com- pensation creek outlet. methods the 7 years of ouananiche were captured by fisheries and oceans canada staff in meelpaeg lake in late august or early september of each year from 2006 to 2012 using 1-cm mesh size fyke nets attached to the shore- line. no capture efforts were made in 2011 although movements of previously tagged fish were recorded. a total of 1811 ouananiche were successfully cap- tured and tagged over the study (table 1). fish were captured in meelpaeg lake at distances ranging from 0.48 to 27.61 km from the stream entrance with the mean distance being 4.62 km. the mean length of tagged fish was 343.4 mm (range 160–480 mm), and the mean mass was 474.7 g (range 106–1503 g). captured fish were transferred to shore in 100-l insulated containers, visually examined for signs of disease or injury and, if deemed healthy and of suitable size, were selected for integrated transponder (pit) tags. transport time to shore was <5 min and was completed to provide a more stable working environment for fish surgery. implantation of passive surgical fish selected for surgery were placed in an anaes- thetic bath (100 ppm of clove oil/ethanol solution) (2– until operculum rate was slow and irregular 3 min) and fish lost equilibrium. each fish was weighed (g), measured for fork length (mm) and then placed in a v-shaped surgical table where water was continuously pumped over its gills by a small bat- tery-operated pump. a 5-mm incision was made using a number 11 surgical blade along the mid-lat- table 1. mean fork length (mm) and mass (g) of ouananiche captured and tagged in meelpaeg lake from 2006 to 2012. eral line anterior to the pelvic girdle. the pit tag instruments 3 9 23 mm model ri-trp- (texas wrhp) programmed with a unique numerical code was then placed into the body cavity and the incision closed with one independent suture (ussc, 2-0 coated braided silk nonabsorbable). the complete procedure lasted approximately 4 min. after surgery, fish were held in a soft mesh holding pen near the capture site for approximately 1 h before release. there were no known mortalities during transport or surgery and no evidence of tag loss. all capture and tagging procedures followed approved canadian council on animal care polices and guidelines. passive integrated transponder telemetry gates consisting of double-gate loop pit antennae, attached to pit tag readers/data loggers (model series 2000; texas instruments inc. dallas, texas, usa) were established at the entrance (mouth) of compensation creek and upstream and downstream of culverts at the outlet of the stream (fig. 1). these antennae were calibrated for 100% detection. gates were installed prior to tagging fish and remained in place year- round. issues with the telemetry gates in 2010 resulted in a lack of information on fish movement into the lake from october 3rd to 28th. during each spawning season, from september 1 to october 15 in 2006 to 2010 (as well as the years 2003–2005 pre- ceding this study), the hydropower plant was shut down each night (19.00–06.00) to attract fish to the stream to spawn. in 2011, this nightly shutdown was discontinued. passive integrated transponder tagging data were compiled for years 2006 to 2012 with entry and exit dates for all fish that entered compensation creek. year, month, day and time of day were recorded for all fish that passed pit data loggers within the stream. the distance of each capture location from the stream was determined using the coordinates of each net and the stream entrance. water temperatures were collected from a thermograph placed in the main stem of the stream. data were analysed using r: a language and environment for statistical com- puting (r core team 2013) and sas enterprise guide 5.1 software (sas institute inc., cary, north carolina, usa). number captured mean fork length (mm) fork length range (mm) mean mass (g) range in mass (g) 238 379 349 236 293 0 316 331 351 357 350 352 – 315 250–420 235–469 290–440

a fish entering the stream to spawn. in almost all cases (with the excep- tion of some smaller deemed to be mature), only individuals over 300 mm were tagged. all data were summarised and recaptures were determined. as one of the goals of the study was to determine whether fish from all areas of the reservoir were able to locate year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 350 compensation creek as a suitable spawning area, nonparametric mann–whitney u-tests (wilcoxon rank sum tests) were used to determine whether cap- ture location in the reservoir (distance from the stream entrance) impacted whether fish entered the stream or not. the impact of fish length on fish entry to the stream was also examined using a mann–whit- ney u-test. all salmon movements into or out of the stream were summarised. first entries of salmon into com- pensation creek for each hour of the day were deter- mined for each year from 2006 to 2012. the diel distribution of hourly counts was compared to a ran- dom distribution using circular statistics (package circstats) (batschelet 1981; jammalamadaka & sen- gupta 2001). the number of consecutive repeat and alternate year spawning fish was determined from the 6 years of data. consecutive repeat spawning fish were defined as individuals that entered the stream in two or more consecutive years while alternate repeat spawning fish entered the stream the year after tag- ging or entered during the tag year then entered again two or more years later. entries of fish to compensation creek were summed for each day, and several factors were inves- tigated to determine their influence on daily counts including water temperature, day of the year, year and lunar phase. these fish entry data are correlated as they involve time series (daily counts over consec- utive spawning seasons), and ignoring the temporal autocorrelation increases the risk of a type i error (zuur et al. 2009). therefore, daily counts were anal- ysed using a generalised linear mixed model using the glimmix procedure in sas specifying a pois- son response distribution and log link function. gauss–hermite quadrature parameter estimation was used for all models which is considered more accu- rate than other techniques for poisson data with mean counts less than five per treatment combination (bolker et al. 2008). a smoother was applied to all daily counts throughout the spawning season to account for possible nonindependence among daily observations (gurrin et al. 2005; forsythe et al. 2012). day of the year was included as a random effect, and variables for year, mean daily stream dis- charge (m3s  1), lunar phase and mean daily tempera- ture (°c) were included as fixed effects in models. to account for periodic processes within the models such as the lunar cycle, the lunar day was converted to an angle and the state of the cycle described by the sine and cosine of the lunar angle (debruyn & meeuwig 2001). cloud cover or illumination of the moon was not taken into account in the analyses. complete water temperature data were only avail- able for the years 2007–2009, so separate models were run on 2007–2009 data only. for models of the spawning migration to a constructed stream number of fish entering the creek in all years, temper- ature was not included (fixed effects included sine and cosine of the lunar angle and mean daily dis- charge). abiotic variables were included in the mod- els with 1-, 2- and 3-day lags, as well as no lag. models with the same suite of variables (no lag, lag 1 day, 2 days or 3 days) were ranked based on akaike information criterion (aic). models with dif- ferent lags of abiotic variables were qualitatively evaluated among each other based on the dispersion parameter free- dom); as the dispersion parameter approaches 1, stan- dard errors and confidence intervals are likely unbiased and correlations among observations are accounted for (littell et al. 2006; forsythe et al. 2012). if models indicated overdispersion (dispersion parameter > 1), it was accounted for using a multi- plicative overdispersion factor on the variance func- tion or by specifying a negative binomial response distribution (littell et al. 2006). (generalised chi-square/degrees of to further examine any potential impact of the lunar cycle on the timing of fish entry to the stream for all years (2006–2012), the number of fish enter- ing the stream for each day of the lunar cycle was compared to a random distribution using circular statistics (batschelet 1981). lunar days 13–20 were considered to be the week of the full moon. results spawning migration patterns and timing of tagged individuals, 876 (48%) entered compensa- tion creek at least once and 938 (52%) did not (table 2). approximately 20% of fish that entered the stream did so in more than 1 year (172 individu- als). one hundred and thirty-one fish entered the stream in two different years, 36 entered in three dif- table 2. number of salmon tagged each year and number of first time entries to compensation creek. no. of fish entering creek (first time) no. of fish newly tagged entered same year as tagged entered in a subsequent year percentage of tagged fish entering creek 238 379 349 236 293 0 316 1811 96 112 140 137 111 – 194 790 13 15 16 12 31 – n/a 86† 45 34 45 63 47 – 61 48 year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 total †one fish that spawned 2 years in a row then skipped a year is not included in this total. 351 loughlin et al. ferent years, four entered in four different years, and one fish entered in five different years. eighty-seven individuals or 51% of multiyear spawners were con- sidered biennial spawners. sixty-two of these salmon did not enter the stream the year they were tagged but entered in a subsequent year, 24 of these fish ‘skipped’ spawning for at least 1 year (e.g. an indi- vidual entered in 2008 and again in 2010), and one of these individuals spawned 2 years in a row then skipped a year. the mean fork length of the 62 indi- viduals that did not enter the stream the year they were tagged was 335 mm (range 250–435 mm). fish entered the stream from all sampled areas of the reservoir, and the capture distance from the stream had no significant impact on fish entry into the stream (mann–whitney u-test, w = 533142, p = 0.2067). fork length also had no impact on whether or not salmon entered the stream (mann– whitney u-test, w = 530492, p = 0.2729). ouananiche entered the stream from august to november, with the peak in october. initial entrance dates for each year ranged from august 17th to september 24th, with mean entrance dates ranging from october 3rd to 12th (table 3). there were two peaks of fish entry into the stream for all years com- bined (fig. 2) and most years individually, with the exception of 2006 (the first year of tagging), 2010 (missing data on most of spawning season) and 2011 (no fish tagged) (fig. 3). fish entered the stream on days with mean daily water temperatures ranging from 2.1 to 14.9 °c across 4 years. mean daily tem- peratures on days when 10 or more fish entered the stream varied from 4.1 to 14.0 °c. final dates of fish entry into the stream ranged from october 28th to november 13th. the stream residence time ranged from 18 to 36 days in length, based on median entry and exit dates from the stream in each year (table 3). almost all tagged fish that entered the stream had exited by the middle of november (table 3), presum- ably to overwinter in the reservoir. mean daily discharge in the stream from septem- ber 1 to november 30 over 6 years was 2.85 m3s  1 (range 0.75–7.98 m3s  1). it was difficult to deter- mine whether stopping the nightly power plant shut- down in 2011 had a detrimental effect on fish attraction to the stream as no fish were tagged in 2011. there was no decline in the proportion of tagged fish entering the stream in 2012; 61% of fish newly tagged in 2012 entered the stream in 2012 (table 2). salmon entered the stream at all hours of the day, but fish movement into the stream was higher at dusk and night with a peak between 18.00 and 20.00 hours in all years (32% of all stream entries) (fig. 4). sun- times for the study area varied from approxi- set mately 16:40 to 18:40 throughout the spawning 352 season for all years (u.s.n.o. 2013). the time of day fish entered the stream significantly differed from random for all years combined (rayleigh test: n = 813, mean direction =  1.092, mean resultant length = 0.411, p < 0.000) and for individual years (p < 0.000 except 2006 p = 0.002). environmental variables impacting spawning migration variables that impacted daily counts of fish entering the stream for all years included the lunar cycle (sine of the lunar angle) and day of the year. the model of best fit of those tested included abiotic variables with no lag (table 4). for the models including water temperature (years 2007–2009 only), variables influencing the number of fish entering the stream included mean daily dis- charge, sine and cosine of the lunar angle and day of the year. mean water temperature was not significant in models, but the best-ranked model had a dispersion factor closer to one when temperature was included (table 5). the two best-ranked models had a negative binomial response distribution and included abiotic variables with a 3-day lag. daily temperature fluctua- tion and interactions did not improve model fit, so final models did not include these. fish entries to the stream by lunar day differed from random (fig. 5, rayleigh test: n = 813, mean direction =  2.128, mean resultant length = 0.2070, p < 0.000). more fish entered the stream during the week of the full moon (fig. 5) and fewer during the first and third quarters. discussion this study provides long-term evidence that an artifi- cial stream can attract salmon from throughout a large reservoir and provide valuable spawning habitat in a regulated system. meelpaeg lake reservoir is a very large waterbody, approximately 32,600 ha (french et al. 1998), and the fact that 48% of tagged ouananiche entered compensation creek (approxi- mately 4 ha) during the spawning season indicates that spawning habitat in the reservoir and associated tributaries is likely very limited and the artificial stream is functioning as intended. ouananiche from all sampled areas of the reservoir utilised compensa- tion creek, indicating that fish can readily locate the small stream. although production in the stream was not measured in this study, the number of new indi- viduals available for tagging each year and the num- ber of those choosing to enter the stream to spawn indicate that spawning is occurring successfully and some proportion of offspring are surviving. compensation creek was completed in early september 2003 and a total of 97 possible redds spawning migration to a constructed stream table 3. spawning migration dates each year based on initial entries to stream. includes initial, mean, median and final dates of entry into compensation creek each year, as well as mean exit dates from stream. spawning season length is the number of days between median entry and exit dates. year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 initial entry date peak entry date (# individuals) mean entry date median entry date final entry date median exit date spawning season length september 22 september 24 september 18 september 15 august 17 september 9 september 11 october 12 (10) october 17 (12) october 20 (13) october 2 (13) september 30 (16) october 18 (5) september 30 (24) october 11 october 12 october 10 october 9 na october 3 october 9 october 12 october 14 october 13 october 8 na october 6 october 7 october 28 november 13 november 3 november 1 november 3 october 30 october 28 november 6 october 31 november 7 november 12 november 7 november 7 november 6 26 18 26 36 na 33 29 fig. 2. number of fish entering compensation creek each day of the year for all years (2006–2012) combined. red dashed vertical lines represent october 1st and november 1st, respectively. (cleaned areas within the stream) were observed over 3 days in october of that year (amec 2008). this study began 3 years later in 2006, and salmon regu- larly entered the stream during the autumn spawning season. the stream was constructed at the confluence of the tailrace of the hydroelectric facility, and the flow associated with a tailrace is a known attractor of salmon (scruton et al. 2007) which may have con- tributed to the immediate utilisation of the stream. the natural tendency for individual fish to ‘search’ for new spawning areas during spawning migration (connor & garcia 2006; thorstad et al. 2008; keefer & caudill 2014) also likely contributed to the stream’s immediate use. spawning migration patterns and timing ouananiche consistently entered the stream in mid- to late september in every year for which there is complete data. the length of time spent in the stream ranged from 18 to 36 days. this is similar to the spawning periods reported for anadromous atlantic salmon from a natural river in scotland (18–48 days) (webb & mclay 1996) and multiple streams in nor- way (approximately 30 days) (heggberget 1988). fleming (1998) suggests that spawning at specific time periods may be how salmon ensure that larval emergence is adjusted to ensure that local environ- mental conditions such as temperature are appropriate 353 loughlin et al. fig. 3. number of fish entering compensation creek each day of the year for the years 2006–2012. the vertical dashed lines in each panel represent october 1st and november 1st, respectively. for survival. several studies have shown that there is a strong heritable component to spawning date for atlantic salmon and for other salmonids such as steelhead trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss), pink (oncor- hynchus gorbuscha), coho (oncorhynchus_kisutch) and chinook (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) salmon (quinn et al. 2002; dickerson et al. 2005; gibbons et al. 2008; abadia-cardoso et al. 2013). stream entry timing and spawn timing are strongly related to fitness due to the impact of timing on spawning opportunity and spawning success (smoker et al. 1998; dickerson et al. 2005) and are also important for the survival and rearing of offspring (morbey & hendry 2008). therefore, it is not surprising that date of entry to the stream in this study shows minimal variation from year to year (table 3). in this study, a single spawning run was the most common behaviour, but 20% of individuals spawned in at least one other year. fleming (1998) reported that, on average, 30% of landlocked atlantic salmon survive to spawn again. likewise, nyqvist et al. (2015) found that 49% of landlocked salmon sur- vived spawning and initiated downstream migration. some biennial spawning was also observed in this study; 51% of multiyear spawners or 10% of all fish that entered the stream were found to skip at least one spawning season. other studies have reported alternate year spawning in landlocked salmon in maine (warner 1962) and anadromous salmon in newfoundland (klemetsen et al. 2003), and a review of the phenomenon of skipped spawning in many fish species is provided by rideout & tomkiewicz 354 (2011). it is not clear why 10% of fish in this study skipped a spawning year. possible explanations may include poor nutrition or trade-offs between reproduc- tion and survival (i.e. spawning every other year may increase total lifetime egg production) (rideout et al. 2005). there was no size difference between biennial and other spawning individuals in this study; biennial spawning individuals had a mean length of 34.2 cm, and annual or one-time spawning individuals had a mean length of 34.4 cm. this differs from results of anadromous biennial spawners where large anadro- mous atlantic salmon (>90 cm) spawned every sec- ond year and smaller individuals (<60 cm) spawned annually (jonsson et al. 1991). most fish migrated to the stream during dusk or night, similar to results discussed in thorstad et al. (2008) for other rivers. some studies have found that movement to spawning areas occurs at night in clear water and both day and night in turbid water (thor- stad et al. 2008). water in the stream is relatively clear (personal observation, results from gabriel et al. (2010) report turbidity of 0.5 ntu in side channels of stream in 2007) which may contribute to evening entries. the fish community in meelpaeg reservoir is depauperate with no aquatic predators for salmon although terrestrial and avian predators may be com- mon and some fishing does occur. movement at dusk/night may be a behavioural technique to avoid visual predators. crepuscular or nocturnal movements have been found in many migrating fish species including brook charr (baril & magnan 2002), koka- nee salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka) (warren & mor- spawning migration to a constructed stream fig. 4. histograms of initial entries to compensation creek each hour of the day (0.00–23.59 hour) binned by hour for years 2006–2012. table 4. parameter estimates of best-ranked model based on the dispersion parameter for variables influencing daily entry of salmon into compensation creek for all years. models included a multiplicative overdispersion factor on the variance function (generalised poisson, sas institute inc. 2015). year of entry was included as a random effect. variables with p values < 0.05 are in bold. dispersion parameter = 0.92 ( 2 log likelihood = 1315.91, pearson chi-square = 287.43, pearson chi- square/d.f. = 0.92). parameter random effects year scale fixed effects intercept sine of lunar angle cosine of lunar angle day of year coefficient estimate 0.1232 0.2740  0.5564  0.4581 standard error t value p 0.07357 0.04911 0.7464 0.1480  0.75  3.09 0.4842 0.0022 0.2410 0.1443 1.67 0.0959 0.0058 0.0026 2.22 0.0273 bey 2012), arctic charr, brown_trout (salmo_trutta) and atlantic salmon (carlsen et al. 2004). for most years, there are two peaks in the fre- quency or number of spawning fish entering the stream each year. this may indicate arrival differ- ences by age or sex; however, neither sex nor age was determined for tagged individuals in this study. dahl et al. (2004) found that female atlantic salmon migrated to spawning rivers approximately 18 days earlier than males in sweden. however, baril & magnan (2002) found that male brook charr arrived on spawning grounds before females and that larger males arrived before smaller ones. trepanier et al. (1996) found that larger landlocked salmon migrated upstream sooner than smaller individuals, and jon- sson et al. (2007) found that larger anadromous sal- mon entered coastal streams slightly earlier than smaller individuals, but smaller individuals ascended the river earlier than larger individuals. there was no evidence in this study that larger individuals entered the stream earlier than small individuals, but this may be due to the narrow size range among tagged individuals. environmental variables impacting spawning migration mean stream discharge did not significantly impact the number of fish entering compensation creek for all years combined. this is what was expected due to the fact that compensation creek is a regulated stream. however, stream discharge did have a nega- tive significant relationship with creek entry for the years 2007–2009. discharge in the stream during these years fluctuated more than in other years (low- est discharge of 0.75 m3s  1 was in 2008; lowest dis- charge in other years was 1.41 m3s  1) which may have contributed to this finding. trepanier et al. (1996) found a similar result with landlocked salmon in quebec; they analysed 12 years of data and found that upstream migration was negatively related to changes in river flow in only six of those years. however, it should be noted that river discharge var- ied widely in their study compared with this study. other studies have shown minimal or no effects of river discharge on salmon migration as well. river discharge did not explain the variation in spawning 355 loughlin et al. table 5. parameter estimates of best-ranked models based on the dispersion parameter for variables influencing daily entry of salmon into compensation creek for years 2007–2009 only. year was included as a random effect in all models, and model was fit using a negative binomial response distribution. all abiotic variables were lagged 3 days. variables with p values <0.05 are in bold. model 1 ( 2 log likelihood = 690.60, pearson chi-square = 156.50, pearson chi-square/d.f. = 0.98 aic = 704.60) model 2 ( 2 log likelihood = 691.04, pearson chi-square = 153.07, pearson chi-square/ d.f. = 0.96) parameter coefficient estimate standard error t value p coefficient estimate standard error t value p random effect year scale fixed effects intercept mean daily temp mean daily discharge sine of lunar angle cosine of lunar angle day of year 0.3855 10.9574  0.0676  0.5003 0.1940 0.2326  0.0275 0.08804 3.6572 0.0464 0.1267 0.1022 0.0937 0.0115 0.004405 0.3885 3.00  1.46  3.95 1.90 2.48  2.40 0.0957 0.1471 0.0001 0.0596 0.0141 0.0175 6.0344  0.5196 0.2066 0.2288  0.0123 0.01584 0.09019 1.5202 0.1399 0.1023 0.0941 0.0055 3.97  3.72 2.02 2.43  2.24 0.0580 0.0003 0.0452 0.0162 0.0264 fig. 5. frequency histogram of recorded entries of fish to compensation creek for each lunar day compared with a frequency histogram of randomly generated numbers for lunar day. the actual frequency of fish entries to stream is higher during the week of the full moon (days 13–20) than would be expected by chance. migration in anadromous atlantic salmon in sweden (dahl et al. 2004) or the timing of river entry of sal- mon in norway (davidsen et al. 2013). temperature did not significantly impact the num- ber of salmon migrating to the creek for the three years (2007–2009) included in the models. again this is consistent with results obtained by trepanier et al. (1996) who found that water temperature did not impact landlocked salmon migration in most years (only 2 of 12 years). webb & mclay (1996) found that atlantic salmon spawning in scotland was asso- ciated with water temperature but not preceded by any specific change in temperature or directly cued by temperature. they also note that spawning occurred over a wide range of temperatures, indicat- ing that temperature is not a proximate cue for spawning. it may be that falling temperature trends in autumn, combined with environmental factors such as the lunar cycle, changing seasonal light rhythms and inherent biological processes combine to initiate fish migration to spawning areas. in this study, there was a significant effect of the lunar cycle on the timing of fish entry into compen- 356 sation creek – higher numbers of fish entered the stream around the week of the full moon (fig. 5) and the sine of the lunar angle negatively impacted the number of daily entries to the stream for all years combined. for models including 2007–2009 only, again the lunar cycle was a significant variable influ- encing entries to the creek. studies on many fish species have found that the lunar cycle impacts upon the timing of migration (upriver or seaward) or spawning (nishioka et al. 1981; devries et al. 2004; takemura et al. 2004; kuparinen et al. 2009; san- chez-cardenas et al. 2011; forsythe et al. 2012) often in combination with other environmental vari- ables. the angular-transformed lunar cycle day was also a significant variable in models describing daily numbers of lake sturgeon (acipenser fulvescens) arriving at spawning sites in michigan. forsythe et al. (2012) found that water temperature, discharge and lunar phase influenced migration to spawning areas and the timing of arrival at spawning sites. spawning activities were most strongly associated with the lunar cycle just before or just after a full moon or a new moon. kuparinen et al. (2009) also that the effect was so small found a very small influence of lunar cycle on the migration of atlantic salmon to fresh water but emphasised that it required a very large data set in order to be detected. environmental and abiotic influences on the timing of salmon migration are complex and cannot be con- sidered in isolation (thorstad et al. 2008). other fac- tors not measured in this study that could influence migration timing include the effect of freshets and changes in turbidity, movement of other intraspeci- fics, heredity, past experience (banks 1969) and body condition (kadri et al. 1996). it is clear that newly constructed spawning streams can be found and utilised by salmon during their spawning migration and therefore help to maintain salmon populations in areas impacted by develop- ment. as illustrated in this study, small stream cre- ation projects can provide viable spawning areas for a large proportion of mature individuals. in this case, half the tagged individuals in the entire meelpaeg reservoir migrated to compensation creek during the spawning season. monitoring the long-term use of created habitats is rarely carried out, but this study illustrates that the use of created habitat can be determined using pas- sive monitoring methods. further research is needed to determine the productivity of compensation creek in order to further determine its effectiveness, but it is clearly evident that fish are migrating to the stream during the spawning season and enter from all areas of the reservoir. acknowledgements the authors would
