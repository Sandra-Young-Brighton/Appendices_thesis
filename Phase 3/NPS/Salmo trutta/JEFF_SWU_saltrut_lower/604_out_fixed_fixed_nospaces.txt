(2004) found that young-of-the-year used littoral nearshore juvenile arctic charr (yoy) arctic charr in three alpine lakes in northern sweden environments. sandlund et al. (1988) also noted that in arctic and alpine lakes, tend to use nearshore environments owing to lower predation risks, possibly related to the absence of competitor species (e.g., brown_trout, salmo_trutta) that dominate the littoral environments of most european subarctic and temperate lakes where yoy arctic charr are typically not found. similar to other salmonid species, seasonal habitat shifts have been well documented for arctic charr (e.g., na¨slund 1990; klemetsen et al. 2003; amund- sen et al. 2008). anadromous individuals undergo seaward migrations with subsequent to freshwater environments to spawn or overwinter returns correspondence: r. niloshini sinnatamby, department of biology, university of waterloo, waterloo, on n2l 3g1, canada. e-mail: nsinnata@scimail.uwaterloo.ca doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00552.x 309 sinnatamby et al. (klemetsen et al. 2003). in some instances, juvenile estuarine migrations have been reported (dempson 1993; jonsson & antonsson 2005). resident and juvenile arctic charr also make seasonal habitat shifts within freshwater to inhabit more productive waters, ﬁnd preferred temperatures, avoid predation and ⁄ or minimise inter- and intraspeciﬁc competition (na¨slund 1990; amundsen et al. 2008; amundsen & knudsen 2009). for example, craig & poulin (1975) ﬁrst reported migration of small numbers of 1+ to 3+ year old arctic charr (subsequently reclassiﬁed as dolly varden, salvelinus_malma, j.d. reist, personal com- munication) from a large arctic river to a small tributary stream in alaska and attributed the shift to water temperature and the abundance of food items. gulseth & nilssen (1999) also observed the migration of immature (2+ to 8+) lake-spawned arctic charr from dieset lake, svalbard, to an outlet river used by anadromous individuals to access the ocean. na¨slund (1990) demonstrated the use of small streams during the migration of a landlocked arctic charr population between two lakes in northern sweden. only a few accounts of seasonal occupancy of small tributary streams by lacustrine juvenile arctic charr have been recorded in the literature. johnson (1980) noted that young lake-spawned arctic charr occupy streams during the summer. similarly, babaluk et al. (2001) observed movement of small lake-spawned arctic charr into the tributary streams of lake hazen. occupancy of tributary streams by lake-spawned juvenile salmonids was previously described for yoy lake-dwelling brook charr, salvelinus_fontinalis (curry et al. 1993, 1997). for juvenile brook charr, small tributary streams were found to represent important rearing habitat because of the potential ﬁtness advantages conferred by maximising length gains in cooler stream habitats that better approxi- mated optimal thermal conditions for growth (curry et al. 1997). descriptions of habitat use by yoy and other small juvenile arctic charr have predominantly come from scandinavian and other high-altitude european lakes where they have been found to primarily use littoral (e.g., sandlund et al. 1988; bystrom et al. 2006; godiksen et al. 2011) or profundal (e.g., hindar & jonsson 1982; klemetsen et al. 1989; godiksen et al. 2011) environments. only two accounts of pelagic habitat use by yoy exist (sandlund et al. 1988; winﬁeld et al. 2002). in canada, johnson (1976) observed juveniles between 30 and 200 mm using rocky parts of the shoreline of keyhole lake, victoria island, nunavut, and using the ﬁne gravel shoreline of tree river, nunavut, the latter of which he described as being unusual because of minimal protection from predation (johnson 1980). similarly, in the koroc river system, ungava bay, quebec, juvenile arctic 310 charr were found to use shoreline environments in the river and lake (stenzel 1987; stenzel & power 1991). in contrast, in the sapukkait river, ungava bay, quebec, yoy and 1+ individuals used both littoral and profundal habitats, but predominantly used the latter (simon 1995). in a recent study by gallagher & dick (2010) on a southern bafﬁn island arctic charr population, most of the juvenile charr obtained during the summer were captured via electroﬁshing in the littoral zone. a review by klemetsen et al. (2003) speciﬁcally highlighted the lack of dietary information for yoy arctic charr. for the most part, whether using littoral or profundal habitats, most dietary accounts of yoy and older juveniles suggest a benthic lifestyle. exam- ples of yoy diet from nordic lakes have shown yoy to feed on a variety of items including chironomid larvae and pupae, benthic copepods, benthic cladoc- erans, ostracods, and other zooplankton, benthic insects and gastropods (lindstro¨m 1955; hindar & jonsson 1982; sparholt 1985; sandlund et al. 1988; bystrom et al. 2004). similar to habitat use, dietary information on yoy from canada is sparse. in cumberland sound, bafﬁn island, nunavut, juveniles <50 mm collected from tributary rivers fed mainly on chironomid larvae and pupae (moore & moore 1974), and in the koroc river system, young juveniles fed most frequently on chironomids and other dipteran larvae (stenzel 1987). yoy charr from a southern bafﬁn island population fed most frequently on chironomid larvae, collembola and acarina (gallagher & dick 2010). given the limited information about the ecology of juvenile arctic charr in general and the particular lack of information on high arctic juveniles, the overall objective of this study was to assemble and analyse all data available on juvenile arctic charr from repeated surveys of lake hazen, ellesmere island, nunavut (summer 2001, 2007 and 2008), to characterise dietary and habitat use patterns. speciﬁcally, the study aimed to test the hypotheses (i) that juvenile arctic charr exhibit preference for stream over nearshore habitats, (ii) that there are signiﬁcant differences in the diets of juvenile arctic charr in stream and nearshore habitats and (iii) that physical features of the stream (e.g., velocity, inﬂuence stream density of arctic charr. temperature and water source) methods site description all samples were collected from within the lake drainage basin. lake hazen (81°50¢n, hazen 70°25¢w) is a large (537.5 km2) lake located at the north end of ellesmere island in quttinirpaaq national summer habitat use and feeding of juvenile arctic charr park, nunavut (fig. 1), with a recorded maximum depth of 267 m (g. ko¨ck, personal communication). the area is part of an arctic oasis formed by a protective ridge of mountains to the north that is noted for stable summer temperatures and higher-than-aver- age biological richness in comparison with other high arctic biomes (oliver et al. 1964; france 1993). the lake is extremely oligotrophic, contains no aquatic macrophytes and has low zooplankton productivity (mclaren 1964) and 34 known species of benthic invertebrates (oliver 1963). arctic charr is the only ﬁsh species in the lake, with the populations consisting of two morphologically distinct forms (reist et al. 1995) resource polymorphism (guiguer et al. 2002; arbour et al. 2011). current knowledge suggests that there is no anadromous component to the lake’s arctic charr population (babaluk et al. 1997, 2001). along the north shore of the lake, streams are fed by glaciers or small upland ponds. on the south shore of the lake, dry stream channels and small streams fed by melting permafrost predominate (fig. 1). represent that a habitat selection preferences for habitat type were estimated using manly’s standardised selection index (manly et al. 1993) based on august 2007 captures. arctic charr were captured with 15-cm-diameter, 75-cm-long y-shaped funnel nets (1-mm mesh) with 1-m wings. the funnel nets were placed randomly at the mouths of small tributary streams and in nearshore habitats (depth £1 m) of lake hazen (fig. 1). at each site, water source (glacial or non-glacial run-off), and net set and retrieval water temperatures were recorded. sixty-seven net sets were deployed for approximately 24-h intervals over the period of a week. charr caught in each trap were counted and measured for fork length (fl, mm). for the habitat preference index calculation, each net was assumed to effectively sample an equivalent area. proportion of habitat types available for use by arctic charr thus equalled the proportion of net sets in a given habitat type. data on the proportion of habitat types available and the proportion of ﬁsh captured in fig. 1. map of lake hazen area indicating sampled stream sites: 1. henrietta nesmith stream, 2. ptarmigan creek, 3. blister creek, 4. muskox creek, 5. cuesta creek, 6. mesa creek, 7. traverse river. 311 sinnatamby et al. each habitat type were used to determine relative preferences for each habitat type following procedures outlined in the study of manly et al. (1993). a g-test was used to test the null hypothesis that habitats were chosen randomly (manly et al. 1993). a t-test (not assuming equal variances) was used to test for differences between lake and stream habitats based on average water temperature measurements deter- mined from temperatures taken at net deployment and retrieval. a welch’s anova and the games–howell multiple comparison test were used to assess differ- ences between lake and stream-mouth trap set tem- peratures when subdivided by water source. data normality and variance homogeneity were assessed prior to all statistical analyses. the maximal type i error in all statistical analyses was set at a = 0.05. stream versus nearshore lake juvenile ecology in 2001, arctic charr were collected from nearshore lake habitat approximately 0.5 km south-west of hazen camp (fig. 1) using an electroﬁsher and dip net. electroﬁshing was carried out from the shore to waters of 1 m depth. all charr were measured for fl, frozen on site and shipped to fisheries and oceans canada, winnipeg, manitoba, for age determination and gut content analyses. in 2008, juveniles were randomly selected from those obtained during stream density estimate surveys and retained for stomach content analysis and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (sia). all charr were frozen on site and shipped to the university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, for subsequent analyses. otoliths were col- lected and ages were determined using the whole otolith method. otolith ages were veriﬁed by length frequency distribution analysis. stomachs were removed, and prey items were identiﬁed to at least subclass, with the exception of ostracoda, and recorded for prey presence or absence. prey item categories chirono- mid pupae, copepoda, acarina, cladocera, ostracoda, diptera (non-chironomid), trichoptera and terres- trial and arachnida). included chironomid larvae, (collembola, hymenoptera arthropods to compare diets for arctic charr from stream and lake shore habitats, yoy were analysed separately from older ﬁsh (1+ to 3+ years). multiway contin- gency tables were used to test the independence of three categorical variables using hierarchical log-linear analysis. the three categorical variables involved were water body (stream vs. lake), prey item and ﬁsh age. chi-square tests were used to test for statistical signiﬁcance in all two-way contingency tables (zar 1999). post hoc tests to determine which speciﬁc prey items differed between stream and lake ﬁsh were carried out as described in the study of corte´s (1997), 312 whereby the main source of variability (the prey item with the largest v2 column total) was removed from the v2 test and the data re-analysed until the overall v2 result was not signiﬁcant. stream density estimates and diet stream density estimates were mainly obtained in august 2008, with the exception of two density estimates obtained in august 2007. sampling sites were selected based on accessibility and suitability (fig. 1). henrietta nesmith stream, ptarmigan creek and blister creek are fed by bridge glacier melt water, and cuesta creek and mesa creek are fed by run-off from the garﬁeld range glaciers. the latter streams are also inﬂuenced by inputs from small tundra lakes. muskox creek is fed by a small upland pond. at the time of sampling, traverse river, located on the south-east shore of lake hazen, was fed largely by permafrost seeps occurring both above and within the sampled reach. the three-pass zippin method for estimating pop- ulation size (seber & lecren 1967; seber & whale 1970) was completed at the selected tributary stream sites using a smith-root lr-24 electroﬁsher (smith- root inc., vancouver, wa, usa). sampling occurred in the ﬁrst 100 m of well-deﬁned channels immedi- ately above the shore, and barrier nets were used to enclose the selected area. stream characteristics recorded included area sampled (m2) and water temperature. twenty random water velocity measure- ments were taken 1 cm above the substrate proximate to observed ﬁsh holding stations in pools using a marsh-mcbirney flow-mate 2000 (hach company inc., loveland, co, usa). a similar set of velocity measurements were taken randomly from rifﬂe areas where ﬁsh were generally not captured or observed. owing to shallow water and the low number of pool sites at henrietta nesmith stream, only two pool- related measurements were obtained for that site. water samples were obtained from each sample site and analysed for a standard suite of nutrients (see babaluk et al. 2009) at fisheries and oceans canada’s freshwater institute analytical water chemistry lab- oratory in winnipeg following methods described in the study of stainton et al. (1977). in august 2007, density estimates were obtained from the 100-m reach closest to the lake shore (muskox creek 2007 – lower) and another 100-m reach upstream (muskox creek 2007 – upper). in august 2008, two population estimates were obtained from the same lower reach of muskox creek 12 days apart (muskox creek 2008 – early, late). two density estimates were obtained at ptarmigan creek, cuesta creek and traverse river. at two sites, smaller side channels were sampled in addition to the the ﬁrst summer habitat use and feeding of juvenile arctic charr main channel (ptarmigan creek – side and cuesta creek – side, respectively). at traverse river, a second channel (traverse river b) was sampled in addition to the main channel (traverse river a); however, unlike the side channels indicated above, traverse river b had an independent connection to the lake. the constant catchability assumption of the three- pass zippin method was veriﬁed using a v2 goodness- of-ﬁt test (seber 1992), and ﬁsh density in streams was calculated by dividing estimated population size ( ^n) by the area sampled. fish density estimates were related to stream characteristics such as water temper- ature, water velocity and water chemistry using linear regression. horn’s index of dietary overlap (horn 1966) was used to assess similarity in the frequency of prey occurrence among age-classes and stream sites as follows: p p p ðpij þ pikþ logðpij þ pikþ   pij log pij   r0 ¼ 2 log 2 where pij and pik are the proportions of prey item i consumed by individuals in categories j and k (age- class or site). levins’ standardised niche breadth (levins 1968) was assessed to compare the diversity of prey items used by each age-class within the streams as follows: p 1   1 n   1 p2 j ba ¼ p where pj is the fraction of items in the diet that are of food category j (estimated by the number of individ- uals found using food category j ⁄ total number of individuals sampled; krebs 1989) and n is the total number of food categories. in both horn’s and levins’ indices, the percentage of frequency of occurrence was standardised by dividing by the sum of the frequencies p of occurrence of all food categories, such that pi and pj = 1.0, respectively. zooplankton samples analysed for stable isotopes were obtained from horizontal tows carried out in an offshore region of lake hazen near hazen camp using a boat. chironomid larvae and pupae samples analysed for stable isotopes were obtained from juvenile arctic charr stomach contents from several lake hazen nearshore and stream sites. the use of stomach and gut contents has been suggested as a useful source of recent prey isotope signatures in trophic studies (teiszen et al. 1983; peterson 1999). however, caution in determining the isotopic values of prey items from gut contents has been suggested owing to the potential impacts of digestive fraction- ation on isotopic ratios (guelinckx et al. 2008) and potential contamination from digestive tract material (ponsard & averbuch 1999). nevertheless, the inﬂu- ence of digestion on stable isotope signatures of ingested prey items was considered negligible in arctic charr dietary studies from loch ness (grey et al. 2002) and was also found to be less likely for prey items obtained from the stomach rather than the hindgut (guelinckx et al. 2008). with that in mind, only foregut prey items with minimal evidence of digestion were selected for sia in this study. to further minimise the inﬂuence of digestive tract material on prey stable isotope values, all stomach- derived prey items were rinsed with deionised water prior to analysis. fish and prey samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures at the environmental isotope laboratory, university of waterloo, on a delta plus continuous ﬂow isotope ratio mass spectrometer pik log pik (thermo finnigan, bremen, germany) coupled to a carlo erba elemental analyzer (chns-o ea1108; carlo erba, milan, italy) with an analytical precision of ±0.2% (d13c) and ±0.3% (d15n). precision was established through repeat analysis of international atomic energy agency ch6, n1 and n2 standards. study measurement variability was additionally assessed by the repeat analysis of one in ten samples. for ﬁsh >80 mm, dorsal muscle tissue was used; otherwise whole ﬁsh samples (minus head, ﬁns and gut) were analysed. all analytical results are quoted in standard delta (d) notation as parts per mil (&) with respect to the relevant international standard (e.g., clark & fritz 1997). the international standards included are peedee belemnite limestone (d13c; craig 1957) and atmospheric nitrogen gas (d15n; mariotti 1983). general linear models and the games–howell multiple comparison tests were used to assess vari- ances in the stable isotope signatures (d13c, d15n) across stream sites and age-classes. yoy data were excluded from these analyses owing to the likely inclusion of maternal source signatures within their tissues (e.g., doucett et al. 1999). simple comparisons between data sets were completed with two-sample t-tests appropriately adjusted for the homogeneity of variance assumption (zar 1999). results habitat selection mean water temperatures were signiﬁcantly higher in stream-mouth sites relative to nearshore lake sites 313 sinnatamby et al. (t-test: t = )4.756, d.f. = 47, p < 0.001). preference indices varied signiﬁcantly between habitat types stream mouth; g-test: v2 = (nearshore lake vs. 11.408, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001), indicating a relative preference for stream-mouth environments (table 1). when classiﬁcation of stream water source was included in the analysis, non-glacial stream-mouth water temperatures were found to be signiﬁcantly higher than glacial- and non-glacial-inﬂuenced lake shore temperatures, and glacier-fed stream-mouth water temperatures were found to be signiﬁcantly higher than non-glacial lake shore temperatures (welch’s anova: f3,26.7 = 8.20, p < 0.001; games-howell: p < 0.05). no other differences were signiﬁcant. signiﬁcant differences in preference indices existed between habitats divided by water source (g-test: v2 = 16.719, d.f. = 3, p < 0.001; table 1), with a relative preference existing for non-glacier-fed streams. no signiﬁcant differences were found between the remaining habitat types. stream versus lake juvenile ecology all arctic charr collected from the nearshore environ- ment ranged in fl between 26 and 94 mm and age- classes from 0+ to 3+ years, with the distribution of the 138 (105 electroﬁshed, 33 trapped) individual charr collected being heavily skewed towards yoy (fig. 2; fl < 41 mm). in 2008, all streams contained only (fig. 2; fl = 29–204 mm; age = 0+ to 7+). most charr using the streams were between 40 and 70 mm, mainly aged 1+ and 2+ (fig. 2). in 2007, one 232-mm ﬁsh was caught at muskox creek; however, this ﬁsh was not retained owing to collection permit restrictions, and its age and maturity were not determined. immature ﬁsh diets of all nearshore charr had a high percentage occurrence of chironomid larvae and pupae (82% and 61%, respectively), moderate occurrences of cope- poda (47%) and acarina (21%), and few occurrences of cladocera (6%), ostracoda (1.9%) and trichoptera table 1. habitat types, number of trap sets, number of arctic charr captured, mean water temperatures ± standard deviation (sd) and selection index values by habitat type: proportion of total ﬁsh using habitat i (oi), proportion of habitat i that is available relative to all habitat types (pi), manly’s standardised selection index (bi). habitat type lake stream lake glacial inﬂuenced non-glacial-inﬂuenced stream glacial-inﬂuenced non-glacial-inﬂuenced number of trap sets number of arctic charr mean temperature (°c) ±sd 39 28 10 29 10 18 33 50 5 28 12 38 6.69 ± 1.47 8.83 ± 2.02 7.23 ± 1.29 6.52 ± 1.52 7.89 ± 1.04 9.37 ± 2.25 signiﬁcant preference as determined by statistical testing is indicated by an asterisk (*). selection index variables oi 0.398 0.602 0.06 0.337 0.145 0.458 pi 0.582 0.418 0.149 0.433 0.149 0.269 bi 0.322 0.678* 0.105 0.202 0.251 0.442* 314 fig. 2. relative length frequency distribu- tions of arctic charr from lake hazen tri- butary streams (black) and the nearshore habitat (grey) captured by electroﬁshing and funnel net traps. streams and in all (1.9%). chironomid larvae and pupae occurred in most stream ﬁsh diets (76% and 58%, respectively) and were the only prey items that occurred in age-classes. copepoda, all non-chironomid diptera, terrestrial arthropods and acarina were also contained in stomachs at most sites. fish remains were found in two individuals – a 4+ ﬁsh from ptarmigan creek – main (fl = 124 mm) and a 7+ ﬁsh at muskox creek (fl = 174 mm). summer habitat use and feeding of juvenile arctic charr (a) (b) fig. 3. percentage occurrences of dietary items from stomachs of young-of-the-year arctic charr (a) and charr aged 1+ to 3+ (b) obtained from lake hazen tributary streams (black) and lake shore (grey) captured by electroﬁshing. asterisks indicate prey item occurrences that were signiﬁcantly different between stream and lake shore ﬁsh. fig. 4. levins’ standardised niche breadth (ba) in stream-captured arctic charr by age-class. 315 a three-way log-linear analysis comparing diet between stream and nearshore lake ﬁsh for individuals aged 1+ to 3+ produced a ﬁnal model that retained only two of the possible two-way interactions: water body · age (v2 and water 2 = 11.800, p < 0.003) body · prey (v2 6 = 18.635, p < 0.005). post hoc tests determined that stream ﬁsh had signiﬁcantly fewer occurrences of cladocera relative to nearshore lake ﬁsh (v2 5 =13.650, p < 0.018; fig. 3b). no signiﬁcant differences were found between stream and lake ﬁsh diets in the frequency of chironomid larvae and pupae, copepoda, terrestrial arthropods and acarina occur- rences (v2 4 = 7.498, p > 0.05). stream yoy had signiﬁcantly more occurrences of terrestrial insects and chironomid pupae relative to nearshore lake yoy (v2 4 = 18.342, p < 0.003, fig. 3a). no signiﬁcant differences were found between stream and lake ﬁsh diets in the frequency of chironomid larvae, copepoda and acarina occurrences 3 = 6.396, p > 0.05). empty stomachs occurred in 5.6% of 1+ to 3+ aged charr and 9.8% of similarly aged stream charr (fig. 3b). no empty stomachs were found in stream or lake shore yoy (fig. 3a).

(fig. 6). a density estimate was not obtainable from blister creek because of low catch numbers (n = 4). the highest density estimates were obtained from the side channels of larger stream systems (cuesta and ptarmigan creeks). spatial and temporal variability in ﬁsh density was evident in the multiple sampling events at muskox creek, with density declining as distance from the lake shore increased and density increasing between the ﬁrst sampling event when ice jamming occurred at the mouth of the creek and the second sampling event once ice had cleared from the lake (fig. 6). charr were found mainly in pool habitats where water velocities ranged from 0.01 to 0.30 mæs)1 (median = 0.04 mæs)1, fig. 7a), rather than in rifﬂe habitat where substrate velocities ranged from 0.12 to 1.39 mæs)1 (median = 0.46 mæs)1). a signiﬁcant posi- tive correlation was found between mean fl and mean pool velocity available at each site (fig. 7b; r2 = 0.61, p < 0.008). no signiﬁcant relationships were found between ﬁsh density estimates and stream temperature, water source or water chemistry measurements includ- ing a suite of measured nutrients. discussion this study demonstrated preferential use of tributary streams by juvenile arctic charr. despite the prefer- ence exhibited for stream habitat, charr diets were found to be similar in both stream and lake shore environments. among streams, charr densities were found to differ, although differences could not be correlated with any of the examined physical features or differences between the streams. despite higher temperatures in streams relative to the lake shore and that water temperature and aquatic primary productivity are tightly linked in the high arctic (michelutti et al. 2005), the diets of similarly aged charr were comparable between stream and lake shore habitats. in both habitats, diet was dominated by chironomid larvae and pupae. the dominance of chironomids in the diet of arctic charr has been observed previously in juveniles and small-form charr obtained from lake hazen (guiguer et al. 2002) and juveniles from rivers feeding cumberland sound (moore & moore 1974). juveniles in the koroc river system, ungava bay, quebec, were similarly found to depend mainly on chironomids and other dipteran larvae (stenzel 1987), and temporal analysis of yoy charr diet from scandinavian lakes has demonstrated the dominance of chironomids during part of the summer when the chironomids are most abundant (sandlund et al. 1988; næsje 1995; bystrom et al. 2004). that chironomids were frequently observed in the diets of both stream- and lake-dwelling juveniles in this study likely reﬂects the predominance of their availability relative to other prey items in the habitats occupied by juvenile arctic charr during our sampling period. although comparisons between lake and stream diets involved comparing samples from differ- ent years, the stable physical environment and simple biological community (oliver 1963; mclaren 1964) within lake hazen suggests little year-to-year vari- ability in the prey resources available to arctic charr. owing to the limited time spent in the streams between ice-melt and capture dates, stable isotope signatures of the stream-dwelling ﬁsh reﬂected a mix of stream and lake feeding. as a result, stomach contents provide a better reﬂection of stream-speciﬁc differences for juveniles in the high arctic. nevertheless, stable isotope signatures supported the high frequency of chironomids (fig. 5) in the diets of juvenile arctic charr. within stream environments, high overlap in diet was found among age-classes, suggesting the occur- rence of intraspeciﬁc competition (amundsen et al. 2001), with stronger competition occurring between adjacent age-classes. diets of older stream charr comprised a greater variety of prey items including the increased incorporation of non-chironomid dip- 317 sinnatamby et al.

(1993) suspected that yoy were incapable of swimming upstream via a 5-km creek with a water velocity of 0.5 mæs)1. similarly, the signiﬁcant positive correlation between mean fl and mean pool velocity demonstrated here suggests that access to tributary streams is restricted based on individual size (fl) and related swimming ability. arctic charr critical swimming speed (css) varies with temperature (beamish 1980), and diet (pettersson et al. 2010) and css estimates range from 2.1 to 4.3 body lengthsæs)1. based on that css range, yoy in lake hazen tributary streams (fl = 29–43 mm) would have maximum swimming abilities ranging from 0.06 to 0.18 mæs)1 (fig. 7a). lower css estimates are more realistic in the high arctic, which is characterised by low-temperature and low-produc- tivity systems. even if upper end css values are assumed, stream environments represent challenging environments for yoy charr and water velocity is most likely the key factor limiting stream use by yoy. at each stream site, smaller individuals were found only in low-velocity pools or in eddies adjacent to stream banks. no yoy were found using habitat with velocities >0.1 mæs)1. that results suggest habitat segregation in stream-dwelling salmonids is common, and yoy are often found using habitat closer to the shore where shallower and slow-ﬂowing water predominates (bohlin 1977; bremset & berg 1999). although segregation may occur as a result of competitive displacement (bohlin 1977) or yoy preference for marginal habitat (nislow et al. 2000), our in high arctic streams, physical barriers created by ﬂow velocities effectively separate ﬁsh by size into distinctive habitat types. thus, under climate warming scenarios, predicted changes in the pattern of stream ﬂow may hold signiﬁcant consequences for stream occupancy either as a result of increased competition where ﬂows decline or as a result of increased physical barriers where ﬂows increase. for pond-fed streams, the former scenario is more likely (smol & douglas 2007), whereas for glacier-supported streams, the latter is more likely. in particular, summer habitat use and feeding of juvenile arctic charr found to increase competition among age-classes within streams (bohlin 1977), suggesting that variable availability may be linked to eventual year-class success. despite the importance of temperature (na¨slund 1991) and substrate type (erkinaro 1995) to salmo- nids, charr density was not detectably related to either factor. additionally, differences in water velocity, source, chemistry and prey composition could not explain differences in measured densities. it is likely that physical factors inﬂuencing stream accessibility impacted relative occupancy rates and obscured potential relationships between density and environ- mental factors. for example, distance from the lake, as observed in muskox creek in 2007, low water depth at the mouth of traverse river a and high sediment loads observed at blister creek may all act as physical barriers to stream use. in addition, access to muskox creek during the ﬁrst sampling event in 2008 was hindered by large amounts of candled ice at the stream mouth and likely contributed to the observed temporal variability in the stream resident density. similarly, curry et al. (1997) demonstrated that dispersal of yoy brook charr upstream varied annually according to habitat accessibility. l’abee-lund et al. (1993) demonstrated that dif- ferences in the distribution of juvenile artic charr between habitats may occur as a trade-off between food availability and predation risk. in contrast, our results suggest that the presence of physical barriers contribute to a higher proportion of yoy occupying the nearshore environment rather than stream envi- ronments preferred by juvenile arctic charr. prefer- ence for stream environments was not attributable to differences in feeding; however, streams provided water temperatures closer to optimal thermal condi- tions for growth (larsson 2005) and contained more structurally complex substrates. lewin et al. (2004) demonstrated that juvenile ﬁsh distributions are con- trolled by habitat structure complexity rather than food biomass, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of cover to salmonids (e.g., cunjak & power 1986; gibson & erkinaro 2009). when acces- sible, stream habitats may be preferred in comparison with the structurally sparse nearshore environment that is associated with increased avian predation risks (e.g., gibson et al. 1993) and ⁄ or cannibalistic adult arctic charr that congregate at stream inlets (babaluk et al. 2001). stream environments represent only a small pro- portion of available habitat relative to the area contributed by the nearshore lake environment (lake hazen circumference: 185 km). as such, the impor- tance of the nearshore environments to the juvenile population of lake hazen should not be underesti- mated. additionally, the potential use of other habitat 319 the mean density of charr occupying sampled tributary streams in 2008 (0.90 ﬁshæm)2) was lower than densities found in the surf zone of thingvallavatn (mean density = 1.83–4.70 ﬁshæm)2; sandlund et al. 1988) but higher than densities found in the nearshore areas of a northern swedish lake (<0.05 ﬁshæm)2; bystrom et al. 2006) or the nearshore areas of alik lake, ungava bay, quebec (density range = 0.01– 0.08 ﬁshæm)2; stenzel & power 1991). in our study, the highest densities were found in the side channels of (ptarmigan creek, cuesta larger creek) and likely reﬂect the higher proportion of low-velocity habitat available relative to the main channels. side channels are sustained by high ﬂows in the main channel and may be susceptible to drought under low ﬂow conditions (milner et al. 2009). reduction in marginal ﬂow environments has been stream systems sinnatamby et al. it is likely that in the lake such as pelagic and profundal zones was not determined. deep-set traps were deployed and were unsuccessful, but efforts made were low relative to the size of the lake. (prowse et al. 2006). the amount of usable stream environment varies annually, depending on snow pack, glacial melt and associated sediment load, and lake-ice dynamics. unless supported by signiﬁcant glaciers or upstream storage in lakes and ponds, summer ﬂow in many high arctic streams occurs only periodically (prowse et al. 2006). reduced snow pack and loss of permafrost will increase the likeli- hood of desiccation of small ponds and the streams they support indeed, as a consequence of climate change, once permanent arctic water bodies have become ephemeral (smol & douglas 2007). within the lake hazen watershed, there is evidence of several intermittently ﬂowing river systems along the south-east shore which are not supported by glaciers. to the south-east of lake hazen, reduced ﬂow on a small creek feeding craig lake caused juvenile arctic charr to be stranded in the remnant pools (r.n. sinnatamby, unpublished data). glacial environments are among the most susceptible to climate change and variability as illustrated by accel- erated shrinking of ice sheets over the last few decades (milner et al. 2009). consequently, the predicted con- tinued warming in the arctic will likely increase glacial run-off. if increased melt water is associated with greater sediment load and higher velocities, more water may not beneﬁt juvenile arctic charr using the streams. until conditions stabilise, a warming climate may not be favourable to the productivity of arctic charr juveniles in lake hazen. acknowledgements the authors would like to thank rick wastle
