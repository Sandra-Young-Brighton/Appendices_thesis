(2000) also identiﬁed a marginally signiﬁcant negative relation- ship between lrd and growth rates of the largest size class (400 mm) of largemouth bass but did not identify a conclusive relationship for smaller size classes. these shifts in behaviour and growth asso- ciated with lrd may have implications for recrea- tional ﬁsheries. in many areas of the united states, such as wisconsin’s northern highland lake district (nhld), recreational ﬁsheries are a pillar of the regional economy (penaloza 1991; postel & carpenter 1997; peterson et al. 2003). therefore, understanding and quantifying whether humans alter these important ﬁsheries is essential. we investigated the relationship between largemouth bass growth rate across both ﬁsh size and lrd. our study built upon the ﬁndings of schindler et al. (2000) by nearly doubling the sample size of lakes and ﬁsh, spanning a larger gradient of lrd, avoiding potential confounding effects of coarse woody habitat, and employing a more sensitive hierarchical analysis method. we performed a cross-lakes comparison of 16 lakes spanning the full regional gradient of lrd )1) in the nhld to test for a (0–45.8 buildingsækm relationship between lrd and largemouth bass growth across ﬁsh size. we used a longitudinal, multilevel approach to estimate growth responses across a range of ﬁsh sizes and found that growth rates of both small and large largemouth bass were signiﬁcantly related to lrd. methods study area we surveyed largemouth bass size-speciﬁc growth rates among 16 lakes spanning the known gradient of lakeshore residential development in wisconsin’s nhld (fig. 1). the nhld is a formerly glaciated, lake-rich region spanning about 5330 km2 with approximately 7600 lakes (peterson et al. 2003; carpenter et al. 2007) and is vegetated by upland conifer-hardwood forests (stearns 1951; brown & curtis 1952). human population densities in the region have increased nearly ﬁvefold in the last half century (carpenter et al. 2007), and since the 1960s, the majority of that development has occurred on lake shorelines (schnaiberg et al. 2002). in the early 2000s, vilas county, the county of our study lakes, had nearly 16,500 buildings within 100 m of lake shorelines (riera et al. 2001). lakeshore residential development of our study )1 within lakes ranged from 0 to 45.8 buildingsækm 100 m of lake shorelines (table 1). predators of largemouth bass from the esocidae family (e.g., muskellunge esox masquinongy or northern pike esox lucius) were common or abundant in all but three lakes in our study: camp lake, little rock lake, and day lake (wisconsin department of natural resources low coarse 2005). study lakes were selected for woody habitat densities and (0–125 logsækm )1) fig. 1. map of study lakes in the northern highlands lake district located in vilas county, wisconsin, usa. 93 gaeta et al. table 1. summary of physical lake characteristics and largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides) sample size (n; young-of-the-year ﬁsh removed). lake lake code perimeter (km) area (ha) maximum depth (m) building density (no. km )1) largemouth bass (n ) 10.2 al allequash 3.5 ar arrowhead 12.0 bo black oak 3.5 br brandy 2.9 cp camp 5.5 dy day 6.4 fd found 3.6 johnson jn 4.8 little crooked lc 5.3 lj little john lr little rock 1.4 lsg 23.3 little st. germain moon round upper buckatabon white sand ws 3.4 3.7 13.2 mn rd ub 9.3 165.3 7.3 40.1 13.1 230.1 25.9 45.1 13.4 17.6 9.4 47.3 14.6 139.3 6.4 34.7 12.8 6.1 63.8 5.8 63.4 6.5 8.1 402.2 16.2 54.4 11.6 71.5 7.6 211.4 14.3 304.6 21.6 0.0 45.8 18.0 30.1 0.0 0.2 16.6 26.2 5.5 2.1 0.0 19.8 15.0 0.3 12.6 5.8 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 28 28 30 30 27 spanned only 13% of the observed regional coarse woody habitat gradient (christensen et al. 1996) to reduce potential confounding effects of coarse woody habitat and lakeshore residential development. fish sampling we sampled largemouth bass between june and august of 2006 primarily via electroﬁshing along the lake perimeter. fish were collected via angling when lake conductivity was not suitable for electro- ﬁshing. thirty ﬁsh were collected from each lake to determine size-speciﬁc growth rates. fish length (total length; mm) was recorded, and 5 to 10 scales were collected from each ﬁsh from the area posterior to a depressed pectoral ﬁn. we removed young-of-the-year ﬁsh from the analysis owing to the lack of annuli, and as a result, sample size varied between lakes (table 1). scales from yearling ﬁsh and older were sonicated and pressed between two slides. nonregen- erated scales were read into a digital imaging system. )1) were determined annual growth rates (mmæyear using fraser-lee’s method of back calculation with carlander’s recommended constant of 20 mm for largemouth bass as used in schindler et al. (2000). it is possible that lrd could have changed during the lifetimes of the longer-lived bass in our study, especially because lrd boomed during the 1990s but slowed substantially during the 2000s (carpenter et al. 2007). to eliminate any potential effects of changing lrd levels, only the annual growth estimates from 2001 to 2005 were included as repeated measures of annual growth for each ﬁsh. (carlander 1982) 94 estimating ages from hard structures such as scales and otoliths is challenging (buckmeier & howells 2003) especially for older largemouth bass (maraldo & maccrimmon 1979); however, largemouth bass have been successfully aged up to 16 years (buckme- ier & howells 2003). we acknowledge that back- calculated growth rates from any structure must be recognised as estimates with inherent errors (maceina et al. 2007), and for that reason, we used relatively large sample sizes (n = 27–30 per lake) to evaluate growth responses in our study. statistical analysis our data were hierarchically structured with repeated measures of annulus-speciﬁc growth observations (mm) nested within individual ﬁsh growth rates )1), individual ﬁsh nested within lakes, and (mmæyear each lake with a unique set of lake characteristics, such as lrd. we designed our analysis around the hierarchical nature of the data and tested for a relationship between lrd and largemouth bass growth rate using a longitudinal (repeated measures) multilevel model (goldstein 1995; ai 2002; wagner et al. 2006). unlike least squares regression methods more commonly used to determine size-speciﬁc growth rates, the longitudinal multilevel model approach allows us to account for repeated measures of annuli and to quantify, rather than lose, variation in growth at multiple levels (among ﬁsh and lakes). we performed all analyses in r-cran statistical package (r development core team 2010; package: ‘lme4’ version 0.999375-33). multilevel modelling methods followed procedures outlined in gelman & hill (2008). growth rates were loge-transformed prior to analysis. likewise, ﬁsh length was loge-trans- formed and grand-mean-centred prior to analysis. we allowed both slopes and intercepts to vary as random effects. based on sample design, we expected our model to include ﬁsh length and lrd; however, we performed forward stepwise selection with a suite of additional covariates to account for unexplained variance. the covariates included in the stepwise selection process were lrd, coarse woody habitat, conductance, max- imum lake depth, secchi depth, chlorophyll a concen- tration, dissolved organic carbon, area, and an index of shoreline morphometry (wetzel 2001). the initial model deﬁned growth only as a function of length. at every step, model ﬁt was assessed as each covariate as well as the interaction of the covariate with ﬁsh length was systematically added to the initial model as a ﬁxed effect. models were ﬁt by maximizing the log likelihood. at each step, the covariate or interaction with the greatest change in deviation information criterion (dic) of four or more was included, as lakeshore residential development and growth of largemouth bass  (2002) suggested by burnham & anderson (1998) for aic and by spiegelhalter et al. for dic. all covariate data, including lrd, were previously surveyed during the summers of 2001–2004 and archived in the north temperate lakes long-term ecological research online database (carpenter & kratz 2001). model structure the multilevel model was composed of three levels: (1) the lowest measurement level in which annulus- speciﬁc observations of ﬁsh length were used to model variation in growth (2032 annuli observations); (2) the ﬁsh level in which the intercepts and slopes of individual ﬁsh growth trajectories were allowed to vary (473 individual ﬁsh); and (3) the lake level in which among-lake variation in growth was modelled using lake characteristics (16 lakes). level 1: annulus level: within ﬁsh, within lake yi  nðb0j½i þ b1j½ixi; r2 yþ; for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n observations ðmodel 1:1þ here, yi is the growth for observation i in ﬁsh j at length xi, b0j½i is the intercept (or growth at the centred or average length) of ﬁsh j, b1j½i is the slope parameter (or growth–length relationship) of ﬁsh j, and r2 y is the residual variance of yi (growth) of observation i in ﬁsh j at length xi the notation n (l,r2) refers to a normal (or, below, a multivariate normal) distribution with mean vector l and covariance matrix r2. in the case of eq.

(a) (c) (b) (d) producing a 1:1 relationship between growth rate and length for observations at annulus one. most lakes had annulus-speciﬁc observations span- ning the entire range of ﬁsh lengths (fig. 3). after young-of-the-year ﬁsh were removed from the analy- sis, we captured ﬁsh from a range of over 300 mm and 15 years. the average maximum size at capture was lakes. two lakes had a sparse 371 mm across all sample of large individuals; the largest individuals from little john and little crooked lakes were a 249- mm 8-year-old and a 310-mm 11-year-old largemouth bass, respectively. model selection the forward stepwise selection process considered both the interaction of ﬁsh length and lrd and the interaction of ﬁsh length and maximum depth as candidate predictors. the initial model ﬁtted growth as a function of length and had a dic of 752.4. adding the interaction of lrd and length at step one improved the dic by 5.3, and adding the interaction of length and maximum depth at step two improved the dic by 5.8. no covariate improved model ﬁt by the minimum cut-off of 4 at step three, based on criteria proposed for the aic (burnham & anderson 1998; spiegelhalter et al. 2002). when compared to the initial model, unconditional at levels 2 and 3, all the standard deviations of the random effects of the ﬁnal stepwise-selected model were within 0.001 or 1% of the initial model except for the slope at level 3. the 96 fig. 2. longitudinal multilevel model ﬁt. )1) (a) observed loge growth rate (mmæyear plotted against predicted loge growth rate )1). model residuals plotted against (mmæyear )1), (b) predicted loge growth rate (mmæyear (c) centred ﬁsh length (logeæmm), and )1). residuals (d) building density (no. km were jittered when plotted against building density. addition of the interactions of lrd and maximum depth with length improved model ﬁt and reduced the standard deviation of the slope at level 3 by 0.116 or 37%. model ﬁt largemouth bass growth rate was successfully mod- elled as a function of ﬁsh length, the interaction of ﬁsh length and lrd, and the interaction of ﬁsh length and maximum depth. predicted growth rates were closely clustered around observed growth rates (fig. 2a). residuals were evenly distributed across predicted growth rate (fig. 2b) and across ﬁsh length (fig. 2c). model ﬁt was also unbiased across the regional gradient of building density (fig. 2d). as an unavoid- able consequence of how growth rates are calculated, growth rate and length at annulus one are equal creating a conspicuous trend for observations at annulus one (clustered observations in the upper right of fig. 2a, on the right side of fig. 2b, and on the left side of fig. 2c). nonetheless, growth calculations at annulus one did not affect model results for later annuli. model results relationship our analysis identiﬁed a signiﬁcant between lrd and largemouth bass size-speciﬁc growth rate that varied across ﬁsh length (table 2). in general, we observed a more negative slope lakeshore residential development and growth of largemouth bass fig. 3. lake-speciﬁc longitudinal multilevel model ﬁt. largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides) annulus-speciﬁc loge growth rate )1) across centred ﬁsh length (logeæmm) per lake (points) is shown with lake-speciﬁc model-predicted growth trajectories (black line) (mmæyear and random effects (grey lines). lake codes are shown in upper right (refer to table 1 for lake name and characteristics) with lrd (buildingsækm )1) in bottom left. table 2. longitudinal multilevel model results. parameter standard deviations (sd), correlations between the intercepts and slopes (corr), coefﬁcients estimates (coef est), and coefﬁcient standard errors (coef se) of ﬁxed and random effects at each level of the model. parameter symbols in parenthesis correlate with parameter symbols in models 1.1–1.3. model details random effects fixed effects model level sample unit sample size parameter sd corr coef parameter coef est coef se level 1 level 2 annuli fish level 3 lake 2032 473 16 residual 0.259 (ry) intercept slope 0.126 (r0b) 0.169 (r1b) 0.496 (q) intercept 0.145 (r0c) 0.060 (q) slope 0.197 (r1c) intercept length lrd: length maximum depth: length 3.105 (d00k) )1.402 (d10k) )0.018 (d11k) 0.029 (d12k) 0.038 0.129 0.005 0.010 between growth and length as lrd increased (fig. 3), although this relationship was dampened with greater maximum depth (table 2;

(2000). furthermore, our sample design and statistical meth- ods showed that the negative relationship of lrd and growth rates of large sizes of largemouth bass is 98 fig. 5. model-predicted growth trajectories for the average large- mouth bass in a lake without development and a lake with high )1). simulations were initiated at development (45.8 buildingsækm the mean observed length at age 1 in the three least and most developed lakes, 80.0 and 99.7 mm, respectively. simulations were performed using the average maximum lake depth (12 m). grey dotted line shows the legal length limit in the nhld, 356 mm (14 inches). statistically robust. thus, our ﬁndings conﬁrm the trends reported by schindler et al. (2000). comparative studies such as ours are powerful for testing patterns or associations across lakes, but inferences about mechanisms must be cautious (cole et al. 1991). nonetheless, we have identiﬁed an ecologically important pattern that suggests lrd alters largemouth bass growth. the mechanisms driving this relationship are likely complex and highly variable. for instance, release from density-dependent growth, shifts in available prey sources, reduced macrophyte cover, and angling-induced selection pressures are all potential mechanisms that could be acting independently or concurrently to drive the observed trends in largemouth bass growth. in lake-wide aggregations of the observed trend of increased growth rates of smaller largemouth bass with lrd (fig. 4) could be driven by several mechanisms. for instance, reduc- tions small ﬁsh (£100 mm) associated with lrd (scheuerell & schindler 2004) may release young-of-the-year and yearling largemouth bass from negative density- dependent growth responses (olson et al. 1995; post et al. 1998), resulting in increased growth rates of these small sizes with lrd. reductions in vegetation, similar to those associated with lrd (jennings et al. 2003; radomski 2006), have also been shown to result in increased growth rates of small largemouth bass (bettoli et al. 1992; olson et al. 1998). likewise, shifts in macroinvertebrate abundance associated with lakeshore residential development and growth of largemouth bass lrd (rosenberger et al. 2008) could result in an increased availability of energetically beneﬁcial food sources with lrd for smaller largemouth bass in highly developed lakes. an increase in energetic food sources could potentially result in greater growth rates for small ﬁsh and induce earlier ontogenetic shift to piscivory with lrd (olson 1996). earlier ontogenetic shifts to piscivory would promote a rapid growth divergence along a lrd gradient for small sizes of largemouth bass that would likely diminish with size as individuals in undeveloped lakes undergo ontoge- netic shift later in the season, similar to the growth trends we observed (fig. 4). angling has also been shown to act as a strong selection pressure not only resulting in an increase in growth rate of smaller size classes, as seen in our model (fig. 4), but also causing a shift in maturity towards smaller sizes and younger ages (reznick et al. 2001; reznick & ghalambor 2005; lewin et al. 2006). reductions in size and age at maturity result in a reallocation of energy from somatic to reproduc- tive growth of mature individuals causing reduced growth rates of larger sizes, similar to our results (fig. 4). furthermore, angling can impact populations by sparing the less-vulnerable, slower-growing indi- viduals. vulnerability to angling has been correlated with growth rate (biro & post 2008), and a quarter- century-long experiment showed that largemouth bass vulnerability is heritable and recreational ﬁsheries can select towards a less-vulnerable population (philipp et al. 2009). this suggests that exploitation of large- mouth bass associated with lrd (nrc 1992) could result in reduced growth rates. however, the selection for slower-growing individuals is not limited to harvested populations. faster-growing individuals are likely more vulner- able to angling, as mentioned above (biro & post 2008; philipp et al. 2009), and largemouth bass are particularly vulnerable while nesting (suski & philipp 2004). therefore, catch-and-release practices during spawning have the potential to promote egg loss and thereby reduce fecundity of these more vulnerable and faster-growing individuals owing to rapid nest preda- tion (uusi-heikkila et al. 2008) and nest abandonment after being handled by anglers (siepker et al. 2009), resulting in the removal of faster growth rates from the population (philipp et al. 2009). an increase in angling associated with lrd, therefore, has the potential to alter growth rates through harvesting or catch-and-release practices. regardless of the mechanism, the observed pattern of largemouth bass size-speciﬁc growth rate versus lrd has implications for ﬁsh ecology and manage- ment. to determine how the observed growth pattern might across the growth lrd, we used our model largemouth bass ﬁsheries impact to predict trajectories of an average individual in both a lake without development and a lake with high develop- )1) given the mean maximum ment (45.8 buildingsækm depth (fig. 5). we initiated the model at the average length at age 1 in the three lakes with the lowest lrd and the three lakes with the highest lrd or 80.0 and 99.7 mm, respectively. we found that the length at age is greater for individuals in highly developed lakes until around age 9 or a length of 300 mm. above this size, the length at age of individuals in lakes without lrd is greater than that of individuals in highly developed lakes. as a result, individuals in highly developed lakes take about 1.5 growing seasons longer to reach the legal length limit of 356 mm. if individ- uals in lakes without lrd follow this growth trajec- tory, they will reach trophy lengths several years before individuals in high-lrd lakes will reach. ages at length for adult largemouth bass in our study are greater than those observed in some other regions (bennett 1937; jackson et al. 2008). however, long-term research on tagged largemouth bass popu- is lations in the northern highland lake district consistent with our ﬁndings. for example, tagged largemouth bass have been observed growing at rates similar to our model in both little rock lake, vilas co. wi (e.g., 304 mm in 2001, 337 mm in 2005; 201 mm in 2001, 330 mm in 2009; gaeta, j.w. unpublished data), and paul lake, gogebic co. mi (e.g., 150 mm in 1988, 312 mm in 1997; 188 mm in 1986, 342 mm in 1997; j.f. kitchell, b. weidel, j. hodgson, t. cline and s. carpenter, unpublished data). largemouth bass adults appear to persist despite rather slow growth rates in some lakes of the northern highland lake district. regional differences in large- mouth bass growth rates in relation to habitat and other factors are an important topic for further research. large we determined that growth rates of small large- mouth bass (<210 mm) are positively correlated with lrd, while growth rates of individuals (>210 mm) are inversely related to lrd as they grow (fig. 4). future work investigating potential mecha- nisms of the observed pattern should study the timing of ontogenetic shifts as well as the diets of young-of- the-year and yearling largemouth bass across lrd. likewise, quantifying both species-speciﬁc retention and catch-and-release rates across the nhld and between the nhld and other regions could provide invaluable insight into this potential driver of growth. researchers should also attempt to establish the relationship between growth rate and vulnerability of largemouth bass to angling. humans may choose to develop lakes with inherent characteristics, such as ﬁsh community structure, that drive the observed pattern of largemouth growth versus lrd. nonethe- less, we have identiﬁed an ecologically important pattern of largemouth bass growth versus lrd. 99 gaeta et al. fisheries’ managers should note that largemouth bass in highly developed lakes take longer to enter the ﬁshery and may reach trophy lengths more rapidly in undeveloped systems. acknowledgements our research was supported by the north temperate lakes lter program, a gers fellowship to
