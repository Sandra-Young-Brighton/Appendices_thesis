the first in late summer/early autumn when 10 b. lenok moved into deeper, overwintering pools, with the second period occurring in late spring and early summer when nine b. lenok were detected entering the surrounding tributaries. diel activity and depth typically increased during daylight hours followed by decreased activity or resting periods in shallower river sections at night. these results highlight the need to maintain a high level of river connectivity and adequate fishing season closures by implementing and enforcing an expansive spatiotemporal management plan that can better protect and recover the mongolian b. lenok populations. such measures should be transferable to other threatened, potadromous fish species residing throughout the world’s boreal river basins. k e y w o r d s acoustic telemetry, brachymystax_lenok, mongolian fish fauna, potadromous fish, seasonal movements, spatial ecology 1 |  introduction in subarctic regions of the world, seasonal weather fluctuations cre- ate extreme environmental conditions that shape riverine habitats and regulate aquatic communities (resh et al., 1988; weber, nilsson, lind, alfredsen, & polvi, 2013). to survive, resident species must endure prolonged minimal water temperatures, complete river ice coverage, reduced light and food availabilities and major flood events (brown, hubert, & daly, 2011; power, cunjak, flannagan, & katopodis, 1993). although such disturbances increase the susceptibility and mortality of individuals (prowse, 2001), on a species level, specific adaptations and behaviours have evolved that maintaining growth, reproduction and ultimately survival of the population. potadromous fish, which do not migrate to the ocean at any time during their life cycle, undertake 752  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:752–766. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdspecific movements and occupy certain habitats at different times of the year within these freshwater systems so that they minimise or avoid the challenging conditions. therefore, it is important for fisher- ies scientists and managers, particularly those responsible for threat- ened populations, to gain an in depth understanding of the species’ spatial ecology in order to develop specific conservation and manage- ment measures. this information is helpful for designing suitable pro- tected areas and identifying appropriate seasonal closures, conducting meaningful biological assessments, improving river rehabilitation ac- tions and installing environmental flow regimes (cooke et al., 2016; donaldson et al., 2014). the possibility to quantify free- swimming fish movements and behaviours has progressed significantly in recent years with the rapid advancement of biotelemetry technology. miniaturisation of trans- mitters and improved sensor capabilities has enabled a wide range of data to be obtained from increased numbers of individuals, and for extended periods of time, without impact on the welfare and natural behaviour of tagged fish (cooke et al., 2013; donaldson et al., 2014; hussey et al., 2015). with the potential to now reliably determine fish home ranges, migration routes, site residency and patterns of activity and depth under a variety of conditions (kaus et al., 2016; o’toole et al., 2010; øland, thorstad, hay, naesje, & chanda, 2005), the future challenge is to identify the full extent of individual movements within an environment that does not restrict access to critical habitats in any way. this is especially difficult for lotic fish populations where dam construction and flow modification have increasingly impeded fish movements throughout a large number of the world’s river systems, which has ultimately impacted on population connectivity, reproduc- tion and gene flow (vörösmarty et al., 2010). therefore, studies that are conducted in natural, highly connected river systems with unregu- lated flow regimes represent a distinct opportunity in the 21st century to identify the extent of a species’ home range movements, seasonal migration patterns and behavioural profiles that have not been influ- enced or restricted by human actions. mongolia, with its vast unfrag- mented and largely pristine river systems, provides a suitable location for investigating such movements for a potadromous species in an extreme environment. brachymystax_lenok (pallas 1773) can attain a maximum size of 70 cm and 8 kg and is one of three species in the genus that form the most basal genetic clade of the subfamily salmoninae (chyung, 1977; igfa 2001; shed’ko, ginatulina, parpura, & ermolenko, 1996). this salmonid inhabits the rivers and lakes of siberia and northern asia, in- cluding mongolia, where it has been listed on the country’s red list of fishes as vulnerable due to widespread population declines that have resulted from increased water pollution, habitat destruction, climate change and fishing activities (dulmaa, 1999; kottelat, 2006; ocock et al., 2006). while fish capture and consumption have traditionally not been a major part of the local culture in mongolia, this is changing rapidly (chandra, gilroy, purevdorj, & erdenebat, 2005; bailey, 2012; hogan & jensen, 2013; tsogtsaikhan et al., 2017) and thus the cur- rent widespread unregulated and illegal fishing operations that occur throughout the country has now been considered as the primary driver of b. lenok population declines. in response, authorities now need to     |  753 adapt more comprehensive protection measures and improve man- agement strategies to conserve and maintain robust b. lenok stocks in mongolia. previous research on b. lenok has focused on phylogenetic ori- gins of conspecifics (froufe, alekseyev, alexandrino, & weiss, 2008; froufe, alekseyev, knizhin, alexandrino, & weiss, 2003; shed’ko et al., 1996), spawning behaviour (esteve & mclennan, 2008), feeding and diet (chandra et al., 2005), thermal ecology (hartman & jensen, 2017) and biometric comparisons between lotic and lentic popula- tions (tsogtsaikhan et al., 2017). however, a detailed knowledge of this species’ spatial ecology remains largely unknown, with only a sin- gle study being conducted on the re-described brachymystax tsinlin- gensis li 1966 (xing et al., 2015) reported as b. lenok tsinlingensis in the nakdong river, south korea. in that study, the spring and winter movements and habitat utilisation of 51 individuals were monitored over multiple years, with the maximum home range detected for a ma- ture individual being 8.17 km in spring and 4.13 km in winter (yoon et al., 2015). while these results were reportedly influenced by road and dam construction, as well as the close proximity of the release locations to suitable spawning sites and the infrequent relocation in- tervals (yoon et al., 2015), they still provide an initial understanding of the spatial requirements within the brachymystax genus. however, further research focused on the extent of such movements across all seasonal extremes, including summer and autumn, and within an un- fragmented river system, is required for advising species conservation, river restoration and sustainable management decisions for not only b. lenok and b. tsinlingensis, but also other medium- sized, potadromous species in highly connected, boreal river basins. in addition to such knowledge regarding longitudinal fish movements, understanding the shifts in both diel and seasonal behaviour (activity) and habitat preferences (depth occupancy) of a species can provide a better in- dication of the key feeding opportunities (mehner et al., 2007; cott, guzzo, chapelsky, milne, & blanchfield, 2015), predatory avoidance tactics (hrabik, jensen, martell, walters, & kitchell, 2006), bioener- getics advantages (busch & mehner, 2009) and critical habitats that are important for a species’ survival within an extreme environment. by documenting and understanding these intricate ecological aspects, populations can be better preserved through informed decisions, which can ultimately improve the durability of threatened species in the face of increased anthropogenic pressures and unpredictable seasonal conditions which are expected across the region in the near future (karthe, chalov, & borchardt, 2014; liu et al., 2013). the aim of the current research was to address the existing knowl- edge gaps relating to the spatial ecology and behaviour of a potadro- mous species in a highly connected, boreal river system using b. lenok as a model species in remote northern mongolian. specifically, the study is focused on identifying the extent of individual home range sizes and peak movement periods, as well as the diel and seasonal shifts in behaviour (activity) and habitat use (depth). obtaining such in- formation is vital for fisheries management, as failure to understand a species’ spatial ecology and incorporate spatiotemporal data into pop- ulation assessments and protective measures can potentially lead to bias and ineffective or counterproductive actions (cooke et al., 2016). kaus et al.754  |     it is hypothesised that the home range of b. lenok in an unfragmented river system is substantially more extensive (>8.17 km) than has been previously reported for a related species from a fragmented river basin, with significant movements upstream in spring and downstream in au- tumn, a pattern that mirrors the movements of the sympatric endan- gered siberian taimen (hucho_taimen pallas 1773; matveyev, pronin, samusenok, & bronte, 1998; gilroy et al., 2010; kaus et al., 2016). it is also expected that this species is more active during the day and less active at night in all seasons, with mean depth occupancy displaying minimal diel variation and seasonal change. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study site the eroo river (also written as yeruu or epɵɵ) is located in north- ern mongolia within the selenge river basin (figure 1). it flows over 250 km from its source in the khan khentii mountain ranges (<2799 m a.s.l.) to its confluence with the orkhon river. the core study reach was located in the upper basin, where two major trib- utaries (sharlan and khongiyn) converge to form the main eroo river channel at khonin nuga. from here, the river flows through steep- sided valleys with a characteristic pool (0.5–1.5 km long)— riffle sequence. under regular flows, river depth in most riffle and run sections was less than one metre, while pool depth gradually in- creased from <1 m to >2 m in the mid- sections, before getting shal- lower again towards the end of the pool. only a small number of the larger pools had a maximum depth of 2.5–3 m, which reached 4 m under increased discharge. the regional climatic conditions consisted of extreme cold, dry winters with mean air temperatures of −23 to −28°c, complete river ice coverage from november to april and short, hot summers with mean air temperatures of 12–18°c when most of the 250–290 mm annual precipitation occurs (dulamsuren & hauck, 2008; tsedendash, 1995; tsegmid, 1989). 2.2 | transmitter implantation/specifications and receiver deployment b. lenok were captured and tagged in the study reach during two periods between the 4 and 20 july 2011 (n = 20; 33–46 cm total length, tl) and on the 23 may 2012 (n = 3; 43–49 cm tl; table 2 summary of 12 individuals with over 40 detection days; table s1—includes all tagged fish). individuals were angled using sin- gle barbless hooks and landed as quickly as possible before being figure 1 map of mongolia (top) with the location of the core study region (upper eroo river) indicated in red. elevation map of the core study reach (bottom) showing the concentrated acoustic receiver array deployed along the main river channel and the positions of the upstream receivers in the sharlan, ichlig, khongiyn and yalbac tributaries. note: an additional two receivers were positioned further downstream, one in the middle basin and another close to the eroo–orkhon confluence—not shown kaus et al.anaesthetised (aqui- s, new zealand) in an 80- l aerated container. total lengths (tl, cm) and weights (wt., g) of each fish were taken; however, gender and maturity of individuals could not be confirmed. the age of tagged fish was estimated to be between five and eight years old based on age- length data from the eroo river population (unpublished data), and thus, it was likely that the majority, if not all, individuals were sexually mature as they were larger than 25 cm, or more than 3 years of age, the minimum reported age of maturity for the species (froufe et al., 2003). once anaesthetised and measured, a 10 - 15 mm incision was made on the ventral side of the indi- vidual, off centre between the pectoral and pelvic fins, for the v9ap transmitter (9 × 45 mm; vemco, canada) to be inserted into the peritoneal cavity. the incision was closed with 3–4 interrupted, ab- sorbable sutures, and the individual was returned to a slow- flowing section of the river and supported until full swimming ability had resumed after approximately 15 min. the transmitters had a unique alternating id code for both acceleration (range: 0–3.43 m/s) and pressure (range: 0–50 m) and a guaranteed battery life of 377 days. this research was conducted under a legally binding agreement be- tween the integrated water resources management in central asia: model region mongolia, phase ii (grant no. 033w016an) project team and several mongolian institutions including the mongolian ministry of nature and tourism and was conducted in full compli- ance with national ethics and environmental regulations (document no. 20/911/2008/08/17). thirty- one acoustic receivers (vr2w; vemco, canada) were de- ployed in the upper eroo river and its major tributaries (sharlan, ichlig, khongiyn and yalbac) in july 2011 (figure 1). all receivers were sepa- rated by small riffles and did not have overlapping detection ranges as was confirmed by range testing experiments. in addition, one receiver was placed in the main eroo river channel downstream (~130 km) in the mid- basin, with another receiver being deployed close to the eroo– okhon river confluence (~245 km) in order to detect more extensive fish movements during the study period. receivers were deployed into deep, slow- flowing pool sections to minimise loss and damage from flooding and floating debris and were positioned as far removed from areas of high turbulence to restrict excess “noise” created from entrained air bubbles associated with these locations (cooke et al., 2013). in addition, the deployment of a concentrated receiver array within the study reach, the focus region of fish capture and tagging, was aimed to improve detection of tagged individuals as they moved longitudinally along the river continuum. this was especially import- ant due to the low sampling programme of the transmitters that were used in order to have an extended battery life (377 days) to sample all seasonal extremes, while retaining the possibility of tagging smaller fish (>340 g) and also gathering data on acceleration and depth. tidbit (onset, usa) water temperature loggers were placed in the river to record seasonal changes in water temperature. motion sensor cam- eras (waldkauz digital trail camera, germany) were attached to ripar- ian vegetation and used to define the specific seasonal periods. eroo river discharge data were obtained from the mongolian academy of sciences and included daily measurements taken by a gauging station on the main eroo river channel downstream of the study reach.     |  755 2.3 | range detection and sensor testing in situ range detection tests were conducted on two random days within the study reach, during river discharge levels of 139 and 334 m3/s. a v9ap test transmitter with a 20- s random delay was placed in the river for 10 min each at a distance of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m from the deployed receiver in both an up and downstream di- rection and on both sides of the river. range detection tests could not be conducted in winter under the river ice due to the inaccessibility of the study location. the acceleration sensor was tested for a station- ary or deceased fish by placing the test transmitter in the river next to a receiver for a 20- min period. a pressure (depth) calibration test was also conducted by lowering the test tag into the water at 50 cm intervals for 10 min each until a depth of 2.5 m. pressure values were detected with a manual tracking receiver (vr100, vemco, canada). 2.4 | data analysis all detections from the first 24 hr postsurgery for each fish were excluded from the analysis to allow for normal movements and be- haviours to return. two b. lenok were detected only once within the study area and so were removed from the analysis (fish id 73/74 and 31/32). fish were assumed to have died or rejected the transmit- ter if the sensor values remained low (as per calibration test values) or constant without any longitudinal movements. as a result, fish id 45/46 was expected to have died or rejected its transmitter on the 1 september 2011 (50 days postsurgery). the residency index (ir) was calculated by dividing the number of days a fish was detected (dd) by the number of days between tagging and the last detection (o’toole et al., 2010). a fish’s home range (hr) was calculated as the distance from the most upstream to the most downstream detection point, including the distance travelled within a tributary, in order to estimate the total area of utilisation for each fish (minns, 1995). kernel densities (kd) were used to depict the probability of an indi- vidual occurring at a location within its home range as a function of the relocation points (receiver detection days) (pillans et al., 2014; white & garrott, 1990). a normal kd function with a bandwidth of 0.75 km was used to calculate the 50% and 95% kd for those fish that had been detected on >15 days during the study period and on >2 receivers (duong, 2017; vokoun, 2003; worton, 1989). the seasonal periods used in the analysis were adapted to better match with local climatic conditions as well as fishery management regula- tions. thus, the adjusted period for autumn was from the first frost on the 16 september 2011, until full river ice coverage on the 11 november 2011; winter dates related to complete river ice cover- age (12 november 2011 until the 1 april 2012); spring was asso- ciated with the current closed fishing season dates in mongolia (1 april until the 15 june 2012); and the adjusted summer period began on 16 june and lasted until the 15 september 2012. the different periods of the day were divided into night (between 1 hr postsunset to 1 hr before sunrise), day (1 hr after sunrise to 1 hr before sunset), dusk (1 hr before sunset to 1 hr after sunset) and dawn (1 hr before sunrise to 1 hr after sunrise). kaus et al.756  |     table 1 summary table including the mean (± sd), median and range of water temperature (°c) and river discharge (m3/s) for the eroo river, mongolia study period 4 july 2011−9 october 2012 eroo river conditions water temp.

p > .05). statistical differences were tested between season and period of the day for b. lenok total distance moved, acceleration and depth using the kruskal–wallis test with a tukey’s hsd post hoc test in- cluding a bonferroni’s adjustment. correlations were performed to test the relationship between fish length and home range, and fish weight and home range. linear mixed- effect models were used to describe the relationship between b. lenok longitudinal movement, acceleration and depth, which were fixed factors, against water temperature, river discharge, photoperiod (period of the day) and fish total length (tl) included as covariables. fish id was added as a random factor in all models and was used as the null model for comparisons. the akaike information criterion (aic) is aic = −2 × loglm + 2 × (nc + p + 1), where loglm is the maximised log like- lihood (or maximised restricted log likelihood) of the model, and nc + p + 1 is the number of parameters estimated in the model. p is the number of fixed- effects coefficients, and nc is the total number of parameters in the random- effects covariance exclud- ing the residual variance. the aic was used to compare models with the null model, and the most parsimonious were identified based on the lowest aic value and its significance (p < .005) to the null model. data analyses and visualisation were performed in r (r core team 2017, version 3.4.0; package ggplot2) and matlab (the mathworks, inc., natick, massachusetts, united states, r2016a). 3 |  results 3.1 | river conditions and range detection tests the mean (±sd) water temperature in the eroo river for the study period was 2.3 ± 2.9°c, with the lowest temperature of −0.09°c re- corded in winter and spring and the highest temperature of 11.6°c recorded in summer (table 1). river water temperature was signifi- cantly different (kruskal–wallis test; p < .001) between all seasons. the mean discharge in the eroo river during the study period was 60.9 ± 76.6 m3/s, with the lowest discharge recorded in winter (0.17 m3/s) and the highest discharge recorded in summer (413 m3/s). river discharge was significantly different (kruskal–wallis test; p < .001) between all seasons, except spring and autumn (kruskal– wallis test; p > .05). the first range detection test indicated the maximum distance an acoustic transmitter (v9ap) could be detected in the study reach during a discharge of 139 m3/s was 60 m, while during the second test, under flooding conditions (discharge of 334 m3/s) the maxi- mum detection range was reduced to 5 m. flow conditions greater than 139 m3/s occurred on 58 days or 12.5% of the total study period, while flow conditions greater than 334 m3/s occurred on 7 days (1.5%) out of the 467 day project duration. therefore, during below average discharge (<60.9 m3/s), which occurred on 334 days (72%) of the study period, the detection range was estimated to be approximately 125 m (range = 100–150 m), while during above average discharge (>60.9 m3/s), which occurred on 133 days (28%) of the study period, the average detection range was estimated to be approximately 50 m (range = 5–100 m). the accelerome- ter calibration trial identified that an immobile transmitter had a mean (±sd) value of 0.091 ± 0.03 m/s (0.041–0.163 m/s). while calibration trials of the pressure sensor indicated that transmitted values of 0, 1, 2 and 3 all corresponded to a depth of between 0 and 25 cm, a pressure sensor value of 4 indicated a depth between 26–50 cm, 5 = 51–75 cm, 6 = 76–100 cm etc., until the maximum pressure value recorded in the study of 17 equated to a depth of 351–375 cm. 3.2 | fish detections and residency mean (±sd) b. lenok total length (tl) and weight were 40.8 ± 4.6 cm and 678.9 ± 354.9 g, respectively (tables 2 and s1). the lengths of these tagged fish appeared to represent the size structure of mature kaus et al.table 2 summary table of 12 tagged b. lenok that were detected on more than 40 days during the study period. included is the fish number (id), total length in cm (tl), total weight in grams (tw), total number of days detected (dd), home range in km (hr), the 50% and 95% kernel densities (kd) in km, the mean acceleration (±sd) in m/s and mean depth (±sd) in cm     |  757 id tl tw dd hr 50% kd 95% kd mean acc. mean depth 79/80 67/68 61/62 65/66 69/70 59/60 55/56 41/42 37/38 23/24 63/64 43/44 mean ±sd median 46.1 40.3 33.4 35.1 39.9 41.2 40.1 42 39.5 39.2 46.8 47 40.8 4.6 40.3 847 642 378 400 546 719 621 733 550 550 790 670 678.9 354.9 630.0 5.4 209 0.2 198 6.5 194 2.9 133 9.4 121 9.3 75 7.7 70 9.3 63 38.8 62 11.7 62 45.3 44 43 33.2 60.2 19.1 66.5 15.1 43.0 11.5 5.4 0.2 6.5 2.9 9.4 9.3 7.7 9.3 8.2 4.1 7.5 10.7 5.8 3.6 6.5 7.2 12.5 9.0 6.7 15.9 10.6 9.0 10.6 22.3 9.1 31.7 20.2 11.7 8.0 9.1 0.49 ± 0.32 0.61 ± 0.36 0.40 ± 0.34 0.47 ± 0.35 0.63 ± 0.44 0.56 ± 0.37 0.69 ± 0.42 0.60 ± 0.40 0.70 ± 0.40 0.41 ± 0.30 0.51 ± 0.38 0.57 ± 0.34 0.61 0.19 0.59 33.7 ± 33.7 52.5 ± 34.2 76.9 ± 29.1 34.1 ± 22.7 44.5 ± 35.8 32.4 ± 29.0 26.7 ± 21.4 21.2 ± 17.1 45.9 ± 34.3 41.6 ± 16.9 22.6 ± 23.4 42.6 ± 30.0 49.83 45.86 34.10 the mean, standard deviation (±sd) and median value are taken from all fish tagged (n = 21). an italicized body weight indicates that it was estimated from a length- weight function. for a full list of tagged fish, refer to the table s1. summer autumn winter spring summer d i k o n e l . b 85 95 99 71 65 23 43 63 21 37 53 45 61 49 41 55 57 67 59 79 69 ) s / 3 m ( e g r a h c s d i 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 05 jul 2011 15 sep 2011 11 nov 2011 01 apr 2012 15 jun 2012 figure 2 detection plot of b. lenok (n = 21) in the eroo river, mongolia, between the 4 july 2011 and the 9 october 2012. each solid black point indicates that an individual was detected on a specific day more than twice. the eroo river hydrograph (m3/s) is included for reference. the vertical dash lines indicate the change in adjusted seasons used for analysis kaus et al.758  |     b. lenok present in the eroo river at the time as their mean tl was only three cm larger than the mean tl of an additional 85 individuals that were also angled in the upper eroo river during the same period (mean ± sd;

table 2, table s1). tagged fish were detected in all seasons and discharge levels including under full ice coverage and during the peak flood event (figure 2). 3.3 | longitudinal movements tagged b. lenok displayed a mean hr of 19.1 ± 15.1 km (0.5– 45.3 km; n = 21) and median hr of 11.5 km (table 2, table s1). thirteen b. lenok (62%) had a hr greater than 10 km, while six indi- viduals (28%) had a home range greater than 30 km. no correlation was evident between total fish length (cm) and hr size (r2 = .336, p = .136) nor between fish weight (g) and hr size (r2 = .387, p = .08). the 50% (core home range) and 95% kd home range estimates ex- tended from 0 to 10.7 km (mean ± sd, 5.8 ± 3.6) and 1.3–31.7 km (mean ± sd, 11.7 ± 8.0) respectively (tables 2 and s1). it is impor- tant to note that the kd estimates, when considered at higher levels (e.g. 95%), can be longer than the upstream to downstream distance because there is some level of probability that the fish moved beyond that point before or after the detection (vokoun, 2003). while the largest hr variance was detected in summer and spring compared to autumn and winter, there was no statistically signifi- cant difference found for hr between seasons (kruskal–wallis test; p = .14–.99, figure 3). there was also no significant differ- ence found between the total distance b. lenok moved and season (kruskal–wallis test; p = .14–.99) and the total distance b. lenok figure 3 median linear home range (km) detected for b. lenok per season in the eroo river, mongolia. the boxes represent the 10th and 90th percentile;

p < .001); however, the com- bination of temperature, discharge and photoperiod produced the best explanation of b. lenok total distance (table s2). there were two periods of increased b. lenok movement detected in the eroo river. the first occurred at the end of summer and begin- ning of autumn, with the second, more pronounced, period occurring between the middle of spring and start of summer (figure 4). during the summer/autumn “cooling” period, 10 b. lenok moved in a down- stream direction with falling water temperature (>14–5°c) and river discharge (100–45 m3/s). these fish that moved downstream did so on or after the 10 september 2011 and exited the detectable study reach by mid- october 2011. there was no mass coordinated move- ment, with no two b. lenok moving on the same day. of the remain- ing b. lenok, three fish first moved downstream before immediately returning back upstream, while three fish did not move at all. only one b. lenok that had remained in the study reach moved upstream >10 km, which greatly influenced the average fish movements at this time in early autumn (figure 4). six individuals that had exited the study reach returned the following year. the b. lenok that remained in the study area (n = 5) did not record any substantial movements during autumn, nor did they move more than 5 km in winter under the river ice (n = 143 days). the second period of increased b. lenok movements occurred in the “warming” end of spring/early summer timeframe as individuals moved rapidly upstream when water temperatures were between 5 and 8°c, and there was a lower discharge between flood pulse events (discharge <50 m3/s; figure 4). nine b. lenok (including fish that had returned from overwintering downstream outside of the study reach and three newly tagged individuals) were detected entering the sur- rounding tributaries including the sharlan and ichlig (n = 5), khongiyn (n = 3) and yalbac (n = 1). these movements occurred between the 14 april 2012 and the 26 june 2012, with individuals remaining in the tributaries for between 5 and 37 days at a time. 3.4 | acceleration and depth mean (±sd) acceleration for b. lenok was 0.61 ± 0.19 m/s (table 2, table s1), with detected values ranging from 0.04 to 3.47 m/s or the entire sensory capacity of the transmitters. individual mean accelera- tion (mean ± sd) ranged between 0.27 ± 0.23 m/s and 1.13 ± 0.24 m/s (table 2, table s1). over half of all acceleration detections (55%) were below 0.5 m/s, while over 90% were under 1.0 m/s. the diel variation in acceleration for b. lenok was characterised by a significant decrease ) m k ( e c n a t s d r e v r i i summer autumn winter spring summer mean b. lenok movements standard deviation of b. lenok movements discharge temperature 50 40 30 20 10 0 –10 –20 05 jul 2011 15 sep 2011 11 nov 2011 01 apr 2012 15 jun 2012 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 ) s / ³ m ( e g r a h c s d i 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 ) t c ° ( e r u a r e p m e t figure 4 average b. lenok (n = 21) movements (±sd), daily mean river discharge (m 3/s) and daily mean water temperature (°c) in the eroo river (mongolia), between the 4 july 2011 and 9 october 2012. the vertical dash grey lines indicate the change in adjusted seasons used in the study. the black dotted line indicates the standard deviation of b. lenok movements kaus et al.760  |     mean in at night compared to day (kruskal–wallis test, p < .001) and dusk (kruskal–wallis test, p = .04;

p = .03), with no other differences found (kruskal–wallis test; p = .16–.97). the highest mean hourly acceleration for b. lenok was in summer at 15:00 (0.78 ± 0.5 m/s), while the lowest mean hourly acceleration was detected at 05:00 in winter (0.13 ± 0.1 m/s). linear mixed- effects modelling results indi- cated there were interactions between all explanatory variables as temperature, discharge and photoperiod were each included in the first two models with considerably lower aic values compared to the other models (table s2). all models, except the one with tl only, were sig- nificantly different from the null model (kruskal–wallis test; p < .001). the eroo river was 45.13 ± 35.13 cm including a range from 0 cm to 350 cm (tables 2, s1, figure 5b). however, b. lenok were most frequently detected be- tween 0 and 25 cm, with 92.5% of all depth detections fewer than one metre. mean (±sd) depth per individual ranged from 20.7 ± 20.2 cm to 226.5 ± 34.9 cm (table 2). diel variation in depth differed signifi- cantly between dawn and dusk (kruskal–wallis test; p = .04) and between day and dusk (kruskal–wallis test; p = .04). brachymystax_lenok summer depth was significantly shallower compared to all other seasons (kruskal–wallis test; p = .001–.04). the lowest mean (±sd) hourly depth was detected at 12:00 in winter (97.41 ± 1.14 cm), and the shallowest mean hourly depth was detected at 22:00 in summer (36.5 ± 0.55 cm). the linear mixed- effects models that included tem- perature as an explanatory variable returned the lowest aic values, with each model significantly different to the null model (kruskal– wallis test; p < .001, table s2).

(2010). while most tagged b. lenok displayed a restricted core home range with separate seasonal departures, there were some individuals that exhibited a restricted core home range with no seasonal departures and a restricted home range with a separate seasonal range. the identification of a mean core home range as high as 5.8 ± 3.6 km (50% kd) suggests that there is no strict, one pool only, site fidelity displayed by b. lenok, as such a range encompasses multiple pools and riffles within the study reach. this extended size of a core home range, with respect to body length, likely reflects the larger river distance that is required to search for sufficient resources in boreal lotic systems. although the limited time and detection area in this study minimised the possibility of identifying a shift in an individual’s home range, as has been reported in h. taimen (gilroy et al., 2010), it was suspected that several individuals may have displayed this behaviour as they left the array downstream in autumn     |  761 without returning back upstream to the detectable area during the study period. only a longer, multiyear research approach would be able to confirm if such behaviour also exists in this species and how common is it. in any case, it was expected that no tagged b. lenok had exited the eroo river basin as there were no fish detections on the most downstream receiver deployed at the eroo–orkhon confluence, although there is always a possibility of missing fish movements espe- cially during flood events, so the possibility that these fish exited the eroo basin cannot be discounted completely. it is recommended, how- ever, that additional research such as a large- scale genetics study be conducted to ascertain the level of interbasin population connectivity and thus gene flow that occurs on both a spatial and temporal scale for b. lenok across mongolia. during the “cooling” period (summer–autumn), over two- thirds of tagged b. lenok undertook extended longitudinal movements in the eroo river with most fish moving in a downstream direction. while h. taimen are also known to move extensively during this period (gilroy et al., 2010; kaus et al., 2016; matveyev et al., 1998), this is the first time concentrated movements have been quantified and de- scribed for this species at this time. as with other species in boreal rivers, these movements are likely associated with fish transitioning from shallower summer feeding habitats to more suitable deeper overwintering pools where there is a lower water velocity (fausch & young, 1995). although no single en masse migration was detected in the eroo river, the majority of individuals that moved did so in a short window of time, starting on the 10 september. while there was no ob- vious, single event or parameter change that appeared to trigger these increased movements, the linear mixed- effects modelling suggested that the was a combination of declining water temperatures (14–4°c), river discharge (>100 to <50 m3/s) and photoperiod together induced the movements. it was not until days later, on the 15 september 2011 that air temperatures first dropped below zero and water tempera- tures below 4°c that saw a noticeable increase in aggression by h. tai- men, but not by b. lenok (pers. obs. a. kaus). it is expected that those fish that did not move (n = 5) at this time were already in habitats that provided adequate resources to survive the extreme winter conditions (heggenes & dokk, 2001). during the harsh palearctic winter, riverine fishes not only need to endure prolonged low temperatures and reduced light intensities, but they also face extensive river ice coverage that can fundamen- tally alter river discharge, hydraulics, habitat availability and gaseous exchange throughout the water column (nykänen, huusko, & lahti, 2004; prowse, 2001). as a result, fish have reduced swimming abil- ities and depleted energy reserves, as well as an overall lower me- tabolism and physical condition (brown et al., 2011; cunjack, 1996; huusko et al., 2007). thus unsurprisingly, all tagged b. lenok in the eroo river displayed limited movement under the ice as they typi- cally remained in one or two pools for the entire period in an effort to conserve energy (cunjak & power, 1987). the radio- tagged b. tsin- lingensis in south korea were also reported to move short distances in winter of <4.13 km (yoon et al., 2015), with comparable reduced movements in other stream- dwelling salmonids such as cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) and bull trout (salvelinus_confluentus) kaus et al.762  |     (schmetterling, 2001; 2003; jakober, mcmahon, thurow, & clancy, 1998). any movements that did occur in winter under the ice were at- tributed to the need to move due to the formation of subsurface frazil and anchor ice in refuge pools, the requirement to forage further afield for increased food resources or to avoid increased predation (brown et al., 2011; cunjack, 1996; power et al., 1993). spawning migrations in the eroo river began in late spring and early summer when b. lenok left the main channel overwintering pools and moved upstream in to smaller tributaries in search of shallow, upwelling sites with coarse gravel, higher dissolved oxygen and lower water temperatures (esteve & mclennan, 2008). again, b. lenok were not detected moving in any single coordinated event, but instead entered and remained in the tributaries starting from the 27 april until the 3 july 2012. this period falls within the rec- ognised spawning time for b. lenok, which has been reported to be in may in the eg- uur river, mongolia (esteve & mclennan, 2008), and between april and may in the nakdong river, south korea (kim & park, 2002). while more than half of the tagged b. lenok did not move into a tributary during the study period, over a quarter still made a substantial movement upstream at this time, suggesting that the eroo river main channel may also be an important spawning lo- cation for this species (esteve & mclennan, 2008). the length of time each b. lenok remained in a tributary was highly variable, with the shorter, faster trips of 4 and 5 days likely undertaken exclusively for spawning, while the longer visits of 37 and up to 78 days could be related to additional summer feeding opportunities or thermal/ hydrological refuge. six b. lenok were not detected re- entering the eroo river at all before early july when flood waters began to rise rapidly and ultimately limited the detection probability of the acous- tic transmitters. in addition, in the following weeks, the batteries of most transmitters had expired; thus, it is unknown exactly how long some of these individuals remained in the tributaries over the sum- mer period. in south korea, b. tsinlingensis stayed at the spawning grounds for 14–21 days before returning downstream (yoon et al., 2015). not all b. lenok were detected moving during this period with more sedentary individuals being in a possible resting repro- ductive state that year indicating that individuals display alternate year spawning behaviour such as been observed in both h. taimen and s. confluentus previously (gilroy et al., 2010; kaus et al., 2016; paragamian & walters, 2011). 4.2 | behaviour and habitat use understanding the behavioural patterns and habitat preferences of a threatened species can be valuable for enhancing conservation and management measures by incorporating daily or seasonally impor- tant times and habitats into the decision making processes. for ex- ample, such knowledge is central for river restoration projects which are increasingly implemented in reaches that have been substantially modified or degraded due to large- scale disturbances like artisanal gold mining operations that currently occur in many river reaches throughout mongolia. while finer- scale investigations of fish activity and depth have been widely described for many marine and lacustrine species (cott et al., 2015; o’toole et al., 2010; rowe, 1994), these details are rarely reported for fish in a riverine environment (koehn, 2009; mehner, 2012). the extensive data set gathered on the behaviour of b. lenok revealed clear circadian patterns of activity and rest combined with rhythmical changes in depth occupancy. mean hourly activity was observed increasing in the hours before dawn and remained elevated during the day, before decreasing again at dusk. these elevated daily acceleration levels are typical of diurnal species that rely on sight to capture prey such as b. lenok and thus is in contrast with lower activity or resting periods during the night. this species’ mean hourly depth occupancy decreased rapidly at sunrise and gradually got shal- lower by the early afternoon and evening, indicating photoperiod and temperature influenced the depth of this species. while diel verti- cal migrations are associated with many marine and lentic species, b. lenok movements are more likely to be diel bank migrations, a ben- thic form of diel vertical migration, where depth is transitioned in close association with the river substrate, rather than through the water column (cott et al., 2015). this movement has been observed previously in lake resident salmonids (gorman, yule, & stockwell, 2012) and burbot (cott et al., 2015). although in the eroo river, the mean hourly depth change between night and day was deter- mined to be in the range of only 10–50 cm depending on the season. however, even these small- scale bank migrations may provide cer- tain benefits including minimising energy expenditure by resting at night in shallower, more sheltered river margins away from the main river currents. these areas may also be more optimal with regard to warmer water temperatures at low river discharge levels, which can aid metabolism and digestion (mehner, 2012). although the exact spatial location of fish at night could not be explicitly determined within the acoustic receiver array, previous fisheries research in the river indicated that there is increased b. lenok capture when electro- fishing on the eroo river margins at night compared to electrofishing the same areas during the day (m. schäffer, personal communication, 20 september 2012). the observed systematic predawn movements back into deeper habitat in the main river channel are likely driven by improved feeding opportunities as well as enhanced predator avoid- ance from both above and below the river surface. while b. lenok are morphologically adapted to feeding on the substrate with ben- thic macroinvertebrates as a major food source (chanda et al., 2005; olson, jensen, & hrabik, 2016), during the late afternoon in summer, b. lenok appeared to take advantage of the hatching aquatic inver- tebrates drifting on the river surface as is indicated by their mean surface depth during this period. seasonal differences in the mean acceleration and depth of b. lenok at night are also attributed to fluctuating river discharge and water temperature. higher flows in summer and spring demand in- creased locomotory movements to maintain the same position in the water column, including on the margins. as a result, summer mean hourly acceleration was generally elevated above all other seasonal means. an unexpected observation regarding b. lenok in winter was the highly elevated mean hourly diurnal acceleration compared to nocturnal acceleration. this heightened activity may indicate the kaus et al.increased effort required to forage adequate food on the substrate during the full river ice coverage, a change in diet from macroinverte- brates to fish (e.g. barbatula spp.) and/or the need to avoid increased predation in the somewhat isolated overwintering pools. in addition, the short sampling period of the transmitters used meant that the full range of behaviours, particularly rapid ambush movements has likely not been detected at the frequency that would have been determined if longer sampling times were possible (o’toole et al., 2010). thus, the current data likely underestimate the occurrences of these short- term bursting movements that have only been captured at a low frequency during the current research. the rapid movements that were detected also attained the maximum acceleration capacity of the transmitter’s sensor, that is 3.43 m/s, thus demonstrating that b. lenok is capable of accelerations greater than the sensor limits, which has been identified as an issue in previous fish behaviour studies (o’toole et al., 2010). 4.3 | methodology issues the use of passive acoustic telemetry to monitor fish movements in a dynamic palearctic river system allowed a high number of indi- viduals to be monitored in a remote location, with minimal presence and across extreme seasonal conditions including during prolonged winter ice coverage. as certain precautionary measures were taken, such as deploying acoustic receivers in deep, upright positions on heavy cement blocks and in consecutive pools, then the loss of equipment and detections could be minimised. while a high number of detections were obtained for several tagged individuals under low river discharges, high river discharges remain a challenge for detect- ing fish as was highlighted during the range detection testing. thus, it must be acknowledged that fish detections during such high flow periods were likely missed in the current study and thus detected fish movements and behaviour should be interpreted with caution during these times. however, it was fortunate that high river dis- charge, which reduced the transmitter range detection to approxi- mately 5 m, occurred on only 7 days towards the end of the study, which ultimately caused minimal disturbance. thus, future research will need to carefully consider the trade- offs between transmitter sampling period, transmitter power, battery life and size, depending on the species to be studied and the objectives of the research. in any case, it is recommended that more comprehensive range detec- tion tests and measurement error trials under field conditions be undertaken in such dynamic riverine environments, along with the deployment of multiply sentinel tags within the study reach to more accurately quantify the changing detection range of the acoustic re- ceivers throughout the entire study period, particularly during more problematic times (i.e. flood events and under winter ice; koehn, 2009; payne, gillanders, webber, & semmens, 2010). 5 |  conclusions this new information detailing the movements and behaviour of b. lenok can help guide the design and development of improved     |  763 conservation and management regulations for this threatened, potadromous species. spatial protection measures, such as the implementation of freshwater protected areas (fpas; abell et al., 2007), must consider the extensive mean home range sizes includ- ing upstream movements of >45 km that have been undertaken by mature b. lenok in the spring/summer period. like h. taimen, these distances are large enough to encompass more than one local administrative zone in mongolia, and thus, specific coordi- nation and cooperation between authorities will be necessary in order to implement adequate protection for river basin popula- tions across regions (gilroy et al., 2010). in contrast, the mean core home range of <6 km is small enough for b. lenok popula- tions to benefit from a series of smaller fpas, which could focus separately on protecting downstream overwintering pool habitats and upstream critical spawning tributaries, with carefully enforced fishing zones in between. in addition, current temporal manage- ment measures including national fishing closures from the 1 april until the 15 june likely need to be extended as the results indi- cate the peak spawning period, at least for the eroo river b. lenok population, occurs after the fish spawning closed season. this means that the influx of local anglers to the eroo for the open- ing of the fishing season on the 16 june represents a significant threat to the long- term sustainability of this population, as a high number of prespawned, ripe individuals are likely caught and re- moved from the system before they can reproduce each year. although these results so far only relate to one population and in one season, further ecological research is urgently recommended on b. lenok populations in other river basins so authorities can be appropriately advised, and if need be, can extend the closed fish- ing season or consider a “floating” date that would depend on the annual seasonal conditions including water temperature and river discharge of specific regions throughout mongolia. these data can also provide a baseline for future work regarding river restoration measures, which is required in several areas due to the large- scale, significant damage that has resulted from past alluvial gold min- ing operations, as well as the development of environmental flow regimes, which will be necessary if the proposed hydroelectric dam projects on several of mongolia’s largest rivers are approved in the near future. acknowledgements this research was conducted as part of the iwrm in central asia: model region mongolia (iwrm momo) project in its second phase (2010–2013). funding was provided by the german federal ministry of education and research (bmbf;
