(1997) showed that increment width is positively correlated with condition factor and growth rate. similar growing slowly growing ﬁsh may yield larger otoliths than size (templeman & squires, 1956; reznick et al., 1989). this may result in intraspeciﬁc variation in the re- lationship between otolith size and ﬁsh size affect- ing back-calculation of individual growth (secor & dean, 1989). however, population-speciﬁc otolith size-ﬁsh size relationships are ubiqutous (cam- pana, 1990). in addition, back-calculation is be- lieved to yield accurate information if it is done from the width of a group of daily increments to reconstruct growth of ﬁsh over a weekly or longer time scale (campana & neilson, 1985). 127 admassu & ahlgren the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus l. (pisc- es: cichlidae) is one of the most important ﬁsh species in the inland ﬁsheries of tropical africa, particularly in the great east african rift valley lakes (fryer & iles, 1972). the species is also the most important in the commercial ﬁsheries of ethiopia. information on the growth of the species in various waters is essential to manage the ﬁsher- ies. in this study we used microincrements in sagit- tal otoliths to determine age and to ﬁt growth curves for juvenile o. niloticus sampled from three ethiopian rift valley lakes (zwai, langeno and chamo). measurements of increment width were used to reconstruct bi-weekly and monthly growth histories. condition factor and relationships be- tween ﬁsh size and otolith size were determined. the growth of the ﬁsh in the three lakes was then compared, and the possible reasons for differences in growth between the three populations were dis- cussed. study lakes lakes zwai, langeno and chamo are located at altitudes between 1233 and 1636 m in the ethiop- ian section of the east african rift valley. lakes zwai and langeno occupy the zwai–shala basin and are about 30 km apart. lake chamo is found at about 300 km further south in the abaya– chamo basin (fig. 1). some physical, chemical and biological features of the lakes are given in table 1. in terms of sur- face area, lake chamo is the largest whereas lake langeno is the smallest. however, the latter lake is the deepest with a maximum depth of 46 m. data on salinity (table 1) suggest that zwai is the most diluted whereas langeno is the most concentrated lake. surface water temperature (mean”standard deviation), measured between 1130 and 1200 hr at the time of sampling, was largest for lake chamo (28.2”0.5(cid:190)c), smallest for lake zwai (25.6”1.7(cid:190)c) and intermediate for lake langeno (26.0”0.5(cid:190)c) (table 1). lake langeno is among the least pro- ductive of the ethiopian rift valley lakes (kebede, 1996) mainly due to a stable colloidal suspension of silt which has been found to be responsible for about 94 to 98% of the total light attenaution (wood et al., 1978). in contrast, lakes zwai and chamo are productive lakes (table 1) (tilahun, 1988; kebede, 1996). there is a remarkable difference in the compo- sition of piscifauna among lakes zwai, langeno and chamo. lake chamo has a most diversiﬁed natural ﬁsh fauna containing 12 species. the main ones are o. niloticus, clarias gariepinus burchell, barbus spp ru¨ppell, lates niloticus l., bagrus doc- mac forsk., hydrocyon forskali cuv., labeo spp forsk. and synodontis schall peters. in addition to the ﬁrst three species, lakes zwai and langeno contain tilapia zillii gerv. and aplocheilichthys sp. furthermore, cyprinus carpio and carassius caras- sius are found in lake zwai; these two are intro- duced species as are t. zillii and c. gariepinus. table 1. some physical, chemical and biological features of lakes zwai, lang- eno and chamo. data from kebede (1996) unless indicated

catches are about 200 tonnes from langeno, 1100 to 2000 tonnes from zwai and 1000 to 1200 tonnes from chamo (alem, 1993; herr- mann, 1993). methods sampling o. niloticus individuals were caught approximately every three weeks between february and may 1996, from lakes zwai, langeno and chamo. we used an 18.3(cid:192)2.7 m beach seine whose stretched mesh size was 6 mm. immediately after capture, total length (tl, nearest 1 mm) and total weight (tw, nearest 0.1 g) of each ﬁsh were measured and simultaneously sorted into 10 mm length groups. a random subsample of ﬁve to seven ﬁsh were then taken from each length group and preserved in 95% ethanol and transported to the laboratory. in the laboratory, the tl of each individual was re-measured and its sagittal otoliths removed. oto- liths were thoroughly cleaned with water and stored dry in labelled vials until examination. the effect of alcohol preservation on tl, which was tested using measurements on preliminary samples from zwai, was found to be signiﬁcant (paired t- test, p‰0.0002, n‰73). thus, we ﬁtted a regression equation (i.e., fresh tl‰0.137„1.003 preserved tl, r2‰0.999, n‰73) to estimate fresh tl. otolith preparation and microstructure examination prior to microscopic examination, each otolith was weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g. otoliths from each individual were then put in a dark dish containing 45% glycerol and the maximum posterior radius was measured under a stereoscope using a reﬂected light. each otolith was then washed, air dried, and mounted (sulcus side down) on a microscope slide using thermoplastic resin. the grinding procedure followed was dependent on the size of the otolith. otoliths from small ﬁsh ((cid:176)30 mm, tl) were ground using a 12-mm aluminium oxide lapping ﬁlm, and polished by a well-used 12-mm lapping ﬁlm and followed by a 0.3-mm aluminoxide paste. increments were readily visible in most otoliths after this stage of the procedure. if not, the slide was reheated to soften the resin and the otolith was remounted with the polished surface down. grind- ing and polishing were then resumed as before on the sulcus side. otoliths from larger ﬁsh were ground on the ex- ternal (concave) side using a well used 600-grit growth of juvenile tilapia in ethiopian rift valley lakes sand paper and polished as described above. grinding and polishing was performed until the increments in the outer one-third surface of the otoliths were readily visibile. otoliths were then re- mounted with the polished surface down, and grinding and polishing continued as before on the sulcus-side. increments were counted using a research micro- scope ((cid:192)250 or more) ﬁtted with a video camera and a monitor. an initial count showed no signiﬁ- cant difference (paired t-test, p–0.55) in the num- ber of increments hetween the left-side and right- side otoliths from the same ﬁsh, thus later counts were made only on the right-side otolith. in- crements in each otolith were counted twice, and the average of the two was recorded. the distances from the centre of each otolith to the end of the 15th increment, and then to the end of every 30th increment (i.e., 30th, 60th, etc.) were measured. measurements were conducted using a locally writ- ten software (h. mosegaard, unpublished). length-age relationship length and age relationship was described using the gompertz growth model (gompertz, 1825 in ricker, 1979). methods of ﬁtting the model are de- scribed by pennington (1979). in order to stabilise the variance, we used the natural logarithm form of the model, i.e., ln(tl)‰ln (tlo)„k(1»e»gt), where tlo is total length at age 0 days, g is speciﬁc growth rate at the inﬂection of the curve (rate of exponential decay), k is a dimensionless par- ameter such that k*g is growth rate when t‰0, and t is age in days. the parameters (i.e., tlo, k & g) were estimated by iterative non-linear regression technique. using the ﬁtted equations, growth curves were derived and age-speciﬁc growth rates were calculated and compared among ﬁsh from the three lakes. an empirical regression equation relating ﬁsh length and maximum posterior radius of otoliths was ﬁtted for back-calculation purposes. the re- lationship between otolith size (weight, radius) and ﬁsh length was investigated using regression analy- sis to determine if they vary between ﬁsh from the three lakes. in addition, fulton’s condition factor of each ﬁsh was also calculaled as tw (g) as a percentage of tl3 (cm) (le cren, 1951). results fish-size and otolith-size relationship the relationship between ﬁsh length (between 10 and 175 mm) and otolith radius (r, mm) was best described by polynomial regression (fig. 2). the regression equations, each with r2‰0.99, were 129 admassu & ahlgren highly signiﬁcant (anova, p–0.0001), and the slopes and intercepts were signiﬁcantly different from zero (t-test, p(cid:176)0.0001). simple linear and log-linear regressions were also found to be sig- niﬁcant, however, the residuals from both of these models were considerably non-random. thus, the polynomial regression models were used for back- calculation purposes. the back-calculation formu- lae, according to the body proportional hypothesis (francis, 1990), were: tli‰(tlc(8.530 „ 29.243ri 2) (lake „ 5.429ri 2))/ zwai), tli‰(tlc(13.557 „ 20.722ri „ 8.731ri 2) (lake langeno), (13.577 „ 20.722rc „ 8.731rc 2))/ and tli‰(tlc(10.137 „ 25.463ri „ 8.541rc 2) (lake chamo), (10.137 „ 25.463rc „ 8.541rc where tli‰ﬁsh total length (mm) at the ith age in days, tlc‰ﬁsh total length (mm) at capture, ri‰ radius (mm) ototolith at the ith age (distance from centre to the ith increment), and rc‰total pos- terior radius (mm) of otolith at capture. 2))/(8.53 „ 29.243rc „ 5.429rc there was some variation in otolith radius among similar-sized ﬁsh of the three populations. at ﬁsh lengths of 20 to 30 mm, for instance, the radius of otoliths of ﬁsh from zwai was 3 to 7% larger than those from langeno and 5% larger than those from chamo. at ﬁsh length between 40 and 80 mm, the radius of otoliths of ﬁsh from langeno was 1 to 2% larger than those from zwai, and 3 to 4% larger than those from chamo. the relationship between total length and oto- lith weight was curvilinear and highly signiﬁcant (anova, p(cid:176)0.0001) for the ﬁsh from all the three lakes. the ﬁtted curves for ﬁsh from lakes zwai and langeno overlapped considerably whereas the curve for ﬁsh from chamo differed, the difference being progressively larger with increase in ﬁsh length (fig. 3). based on the ﬁtted equations and at ﬁsh lengths of 25 to 60 mm, tilapia juveniles from chamo would have otoliths about 27 to 30% lighter than tilapia from zwai or langeno. the dif- ference in otolith weight between ﬁsh from zwai and langeno was generally very small except at 70 to 80 mm tl at which size ﬁsh from zwai had slightly lighter otoliths. length and age relationship daily age from 8 increments to 303 increments was determined for ﬁsh ranging in tl from 10 mm to 60 mm. the smallest ﬁsh was 10, 12 and 14 mm in the sample from lake langeno, zwai and chamo, respectively, corresponding to ages 8, 9 and 21 days. the hatching check, encircling the nucleus re- gion of the otolith was prominently visible almost in all specimens. as also found by zhang & run- ham (1992a), a few and faint increments were pres- 130 fig. 2. relationship between otolith radius and ﬁsh total length in juvenile oreochromis niloticus from lakes zwai (a), langeno (b) and chamo (c). n‰300, 294 & 222, respectively. included in subsequent ent in the region between the otolith centre and the hatching check (fig. 4). these were neither con- sidered to be formed daily (zhang & runham, 1992a) nor increment counts. increments after the hatching check were regular and prominent. zhang & runham (1992a) observed the hatching check at the edge of otoliths from larval tilapia which they sampled one day after hatch. thus, we believed the ﬁrst daily in- crement to be formed two days after hatch, and all counts were corrected accordingly. the gompertz growth model described the re- lationship between length and age quite well for ﬁsh from the three lakes (fig. 5). the correlation coefﬁcient of each equation suggest that each model explained more than 86% of the variation in length at age. from the above growth models, length at hatch (t‰0 days) was predicted to be 10.3 mm for tilapia from lake zwai, 11.0 mm for those from lake growth of juvenile tilapia in ethiopian rift valley lakes

and 9.5 mm for those from lake chamo. these values are likely to be overestimates since we lack small-sized ﬁsh in the sample. instantaneous growth rate at t‰0 days and tl‰tlo was 0.0201, 0.0188 and 0.0345 for tilapia from lake zwai, langeno and chamo, respectively. equations was average growth rate estimates from the gom- pertz models indicated that o. niloticus juveniles from lakes zwai and langeno grew at about simi- lar rates for the ﬁrst 50 days posthatch, after which those from zwai grew slightly more rapidly. in contrast, tilapia juveniles from lake chamo grew more rapidly than ﬁsh of comparable ages from the other two lakes. average growth rate through the ﬁrst 250 days after hatch predicted from the 0.20 mm ` day»1 gompertz (0.72% ` day»1), 0.16 mm/day (0.62% ` day»1) and 0.39 mm ` day»1 (1.14% ` day»1) for juveniles from lake zwai, langeno and chamo, respec- tively. similar growth rates were estimated using simple linear regression equations between length and age: 0.20 mm ` day»1, 0.15 mm ` day»1 and 0.41 mm ` day»1, respectively. hence, among the sampled lakes average daily growth rate of o. nil- oticus juveniles was most rapid in lake chamo, intermediate in lake zwai and slowest in lake langeno. back-calculated growth history back-calculated length-at-age data are presented in tables 2–4 for ﬁsh from lake zwai, langeno and chamo, respectively. back-calculated data

larger than those from chamo, and 12% larger than those from zwai. in addition, at age 30 days ﬁsh from chamo and lan- geno were of similar size, but those from zwai were 7 to 8% smaller. however, there was an overlap in the 95% conﬁdence limits of mean back-calculated length at ages 15 and 30 days (fig. 6a). this sug- gests that tilapia growth during the ﬁrst month after hatch may be similar in the three lakes. after the age of 30 days ﬁsh from lake chamo attained 132 signiﬁcantly larger size-at-age than those from the other two lakes. fish at similar ages (60 days and older) from zwai and langeno were of comparable sizes, but at age 60 and 90 days the ﬁsh from lang- eno were slightly larger than those from zwai whereas after an age of about 105 days ﬁsh from zwai were slightly larger than those from langeno (fig. 6a). fish from chamo that were older than 60 days were remarkably larger than ﬁsh of similar ages from lakes zwai and langeno. at 90 and 120 days of age, for instance, tilapia from chamo were 28 to 30% larger than their counterparts from the other two lakes. mean back-calculated absolute growth rate ranged from 0.15 to 0.32 mm ` day»1 for tilapia from zwai, from 0.11 to 0.28 mm ` day»1 for those from langeno and from 0.28 to 0.43 mm ` day»1 for those from lake chamo. since we lack back- calculated length at age prior to 15 days we used lengths at hatch that were estimated using the gompertz growth models. generally, daily growth rate decreased with age particularly for the ﬁsh from zwai and langeno (fig. 6b). growth rate up to 15 days post-hatch was similar for ﬁsh from the three lakes, after which ﬁsh from chamo grew con- siderably more rapidly. tilapia of 90 days and older from lake zwai grew slightly more rapidly than similar aged ﬁsh from langeno. prior to this age, however, growth rate of juveniles from the two lakes was approximately similar (fig. 6b). fulton’s condition factor fulton’s condition factor ranged from 0.55 to 2.54 for o. niloticus from zwai, 0.51 to 1.71 for those from langeno and from 1.02 to 2.88 for those from chamo. condition factor appeared similar among lakes for ﬁsh smaller than 30.0 mm, be- cause the 95% conﬁdence limits overlapped con- siderably (table 5). generally however, mean con- dition factor was largest for lake chamo ﬁsh, in- termediate for zwai ﬁsh and smallest for langeno ﬁsh, the difference between the latter two lakes being small. discussion we assumed that increments are formed daily in the otoliths of o. niloticus in this study, because this has been validated by several workers (tanaka et al., 1981; zhang & runham, 1992a; yosef, 1990). yosef (1990) validated daily formation of increments using tetracycline injected ﬁsh from lake awassa, another ethiopian rift valley lake. in addition, zhang & runham (1992a) have found that in experimentally reared juvenile o. niloticus, after hatching increments are deposited daily. fur- table 2. growth data for juvenile

(1981) reported that the number of incremental zones is well correlated with chronological age in days after hatch in juven- ile o. niloticus. thus, we believe that the number of incremenus in otoliths of the ﬁsh in this study provide an estimate of age in days. back-calculation of growth from increments is based on two basic assumptions: that increments are formed daily and that otolith and somatic tissue growth rates are coupled. we strongly be- lieve that the ﬁrst assumption is met in o. niloticus in this study. however, it is not known if otolith and somatic tissue growth in this species are coupled resulting in a direct relationship between increment width and daily somatic growth rate. the results on otolith size–ﬁsh size relationship in- dicated that, relative to their counterparts in lakes zwai and langeno, juvenile tilapia from lake chamo grow rapidly, and have smaller otoliths at a given length. similar results have been found for experimentally reared o. niloticus (zhang & run- ham, 1992b), and other ﬁsh species under experi- mental conditions (reznick et al., 1989; secor & dean, 1989) and in the wild (templeman & squires, 1956; neilson et al., 1985; penny & evans, 1985). however, our back-calculation procedure may not be affected by ‘‘uncoupling’’, because we used population-speciﬁc otolith size–ﬁsh size re- lationships each of which were highly signiﬁcant. secor & dean (1989) stated that within a species, 133 admassu & ahlgren table 5. fulton’s condition factor (mean„half 95% cl) of juvenile oreochromis niloticusfrom lakes zwai, langeno and chamo. nis sample size. length group (mm) 10.0–19.9 20.0–29.9 30.0–39.9 40.0–49.9 50.0–59.9 60.0–69.9 overall zwai n langeno 1.46”0.16 1.39”0.11 1.53”0.04 1.46”0.18 1.55”0.02 1.49”0.02 1.46”0.11 11 43 43 37 47 15 196 1.39”0.25 1.23”0.30 1.36”0.02 1.26”0.02 1.29”0.05 1.34”0.11 1.29”0.19 n 10 39 45 47 52 13 206 chamo 1.86”0.26 1.82”0.33 1.88”0.10 1.83”0.09 1.74”0.05 1.76”0.12 1.77”0.15 n 18 35 70 29 20 13 185 models were within 1 to 2% of each other. thus, results from the two procedures of growth esti- mation corroborate each other. our study showed that juvenile o. niloticus in lake chamo grow at a much faster rate than those in lakes zwai and langeno. the growth of the ﬁsh from lakes zwai and langeno is comparable. the difference in growth rate was also reﬂected in the observed population-based differences in the condition factor of the ﬁsh (table 5). however, growth rate of the ﬁsh through the ﬁrst 15 days after hatch appeared similar in the three lakes. the chamo ﬁsh appears to grow more rapidly than the species in other ethiopian lakes as well. juvenile o. niloticus grows 0.21 mm ` day»1 in lake awassa (yosef & casselman, 1995) and 0.25 mm ` day»1 in lake haiq (k. alemu & d. admas- su, unpublished data). thus, the growth rate of the ﬁsh in the latter lakes is comparable to that in lak- es zwai and langeno, but considerably slower than the growth rate of the ﬁsh in lake chamo. interpopulation variability in growth is common in tilapias. fryer & iles (1972: table 14), who pre- sented growth data for various species of tilapia, showed that ﬁrst year growth of tilapia could vary between 0.20 and 0.41 mm ` day»1, the value for lake chad o. niloticus (0.37 mm/day) being com- parable to that of lake chamo o. niloticus. several factors could have resulted in the ob- served difference in growth of juvenile tilapia be- tween lakes zwai, langeno and chamo. lowe- mcconnell (1982) stated that in tilapia the same species grow at different rates in different waters and suggested that environmental differences are more potent than genetic ones in determining maturation and maximum sizes. temperature ap- pears to be important in the present study as there was a distinct difference among the sampled lakes. the temperature of lake chamo was high as com- pared with that of zwai and langeno. strikingly, our measurements show that even the bottom water (7 m depth) temperature of lake chamo (26.5”0.40(cid:190)c) could be higher than the surface fig. 6. back-calculated length at age (a) and growth rate (b) for juvenile oreochromis nilaticus from lakes zwai (squares), langeno (diamonds) and chamo (circles) there are population-speciﬁc relationships which are related to growth rates. in addition, since we used the width of a group of increments to recon- struct growth over a bi-weekly and monthly time scale, our back-calculated growth data may not be seriously biased (campana & neilson, 1985). fur- thermore, the absence of considerable lee’s phe- nomenon in the data may suggest that growth ef- fects (campana, 1990) were not signiﬁcant. there was a close agreement between length-at- age data estimated using the gompertz growth model and those estimated by back-calculation. however, relative to estimates from gompertz models, back-calculated lengths at ages 15 and 30 days were slightly larger for the ﬁsh from zwai (5 to 10%) and langeno (12 to 14%). in addition, back-calculated length was 5% larger than that es- timated using gompertz model for zwai ﬁsh of 180 days old, whereas length from gompertz model was 9% larger for chamo ﬁsh of 60 days old. except these differences, back-calculated lengths and those estimated from gompertz 134 water temperature of lake zwai and lake lang- eno (cf. table 1). the temperature of lake chamo is also distinctly high as compared with the tem- perature of lake awassa and lake haiq (admas- su, 1989; k. alemu & d. admassu, unpublished data). since tilapia are generally strongly thermo- philic (caulton, 1982), the high temperature of lake chamo may have resulted in elevated meta- bolic rates and favoured a much faster growth in o. niloticus. caulton (1982) has shown that juven- ile tilapia experimentally subjected to a thermal gradient (between 21 and 39(cid:190)c) preferred high temperatures (30 to 36(cid:190)c). in addition to its direct effect on metabolism and growth, high tempera- ture also favors foraging and feeding activity (caulton, 1982). differences in food quantity and quality result in growth variations in tilapia (bower, 1982). it is not known whether or not food quantity in any of these lakes is low enough to limit growth of juven- ile tilapia. primary productivity of zwai can be es- timated to be at least 10 times that of langeno (belay & wood, 1984). lake chamo is as pro- ductive as zwai. since juvenile tilapia feed also on algae (tadesse, 1988; tudorancea et al., 1988), their growth could be a reﬂection of productivity of the lakes. a concurrently conducted study (z. tadesse, personal communication) observed that the ﬁsh in langeno feeds mainly on detritus, and the nutrient content in the food and assimilation efﬁciency are quite low. in contrast, in lake chamo and zwai the ﬁsh feeds mainly on planktonic algae, and nu- trient content and assimilation efﬁciency were higher in these lakes being much so in chamo than in zwai (z. tadesse, personal communication). the higher assimilation efﬁciency in chamo tilapia could be a result of high temperature as assimi- lation efﬁciency in tilapia is positively correlated with temperature (caulton, 1982). we are uncertain about the inﬂuence of pre- dation on population density, and hence growth of tilapia in lake chamo. in contrast to lakes zwai- and langeno, lake chamo contains voracious and specialised piscivores such as nile perch (l. nilot- icus) and tiger ﬁsh (h. forskali) which are known to feed on juvenile tilapia (lowe-mcconnell, 1982; ogari, 1985). in addition, based on our prelimi- nary observation on otolith microstructure, we be- lieve that tilapia grows rapidly in the nearby lake abaya (fig. 1). interestingly, lake abaya contains similar ﬁsh fauna to lake chamo, but it is equally light-limited and as unproductive as lake langeno (kebede, 1996). furthermore, because of their proximity we presume the temperature of lakes chamo and abaya to be similar, and equally higher than that of the northern lakes in the series. growth of juvenile tilapia in ethiopian rift valley lakes thus, we believe that differences in the growth rate of tilapia in these lakes may be attributed more to differences in temperature and associated factors. nevertheless, further detailed study is required to address this interesting problem as predation is im- portant at least in culture systems where species such as l. niloticus are used to improve growth in tilapia (guerrero, 1982). intensity of ﬁshing inﬂuences growth rate (hea- ley, 1980). adult tilapia in lakes zwai and chamo are more heavily exploited than those in lake lan- geno (alem, 1993; personal observation). thus, since there is a considerable overlap of diet be- tween juvenile and adult o. niloticus (tadesse, 1988; tudorancea et al., 1988), juveniles in lake langeno may be under a more intense competition with the adults. healey (1980) has shown that growth of lake whiteﬁsh (coregonus_clupeaformis) increased in experimentally exploited lakes, the de- gree of increase being proportional to the intensity of ﬁshing. however, differences in ﬁshing intensity can not explain the observed growth difference be- tween tilapia of zwai and chamo, because the for- mer is more heavily exploited than the latter (alem, 1993). in conclusion, our study showed that the growth of juvenile o. niloticus in lakes zwai, langeno and chamo is best described by the gompertz growth model. growth estimated using the gom- pertz model agreed very closely with growth back- calculated from otolith microstructure. thus, re- sults from the two methods corroborated each other. we found that the growth rate of juvenile tilapia through the ﬁrst 250 days post-hatch was fastest in lake chamo (0.39 mm ` day»1), inter- mediate in lake zwai (0.20 mm ` day»1) and slow- est in lake langeno (0.16 mm ` day»1). indirect supportive evidence is found in that the condition factor of the ﬁsh in lake chamo was largest fol- lowed by that from zwai and from langeno. in addition, juvenile o. niloticus from chamo have smaller otoliths than similar-sized ﬁsh from zwai and langeno indicating that the ﬁsh from chamo grow more rapidly. the rapid growth of the chamo population could be attributed to high temperature and factors associated with it, and to a better quality food consumed by the ﬁsh. in ad- dition, the inﬂuence of differences in predation and ﬁshing intensities can not be ruled out. resumen 1. con el ﬁn de conocer la edad y crecimiento de juveniles de oreochromis niloticus en los lagos zwei, langeno y chamo (etiopı´a) hemos estudiado los microincrementos en los otolitos, el factor de condicio´n de fulton y la relacio´n entre el taman˜o de los otolitos y el de los peces. 2. para estudiar el crecimiento de los individuos durante los 250 135 admassu & ahlgren dı´as despue´s de la eclosio´n utilizamos el modelo descrito por gompertz y comprobamos que la poblacio´n del lago chamo presenta la tasa media de crecimiento ma´s ra´pida (0.39 mm ` dı´a»1, 1.14 % ` dı´a»1), seguida de la del lago zwai (0.20 mm ` dı´a»1, 0.72% ` dı´a»1), y la ma´s lenta la poblacio´n del lago langeno (0.16 mm ` dı´a»1, 0.62% ` dı´a»1). estos resulta- dos coinciden con las estimas de crecimiento retrocalculadas a partir de los incrementos en la anchura de los otolitos y que fueron: 0.28–0.43 mm ` dı´a»1 para las poblaciones del chamo, 0.15–0.32 mm ` dı´a»1 (zwai) y 0.11–0.92 mm ` dı´a»1 (lan- geno). en el primer mes de vida, el crecimiento de los juveniles fue similar en los tres lagos, si bien, posteriormente los indivi- duos del lago chamo fueron un 20% ma´s grandes que los de los otros dos lagos. 3. el factor de condicio´n de fulton ma´s elevado lo presento´ la poblacio´n del lago chamo, mientras que la poblacio´n del lago langeno tiene el nivel ma´s bajo; las diferencias entre las pobla- ciones del langeno y el zwai fueron pequen˜as. 4. el ana´lisis de los otolitos y el taman˜o de los peces ha demos- trado que la poblacio´n del lago chamo tiene otolitos ma´s pe- quen˜os y menos pesados que las de los otros dos lagos, lo que se puede atribuir a diferencias en la tasa de crecimiento. el ra´pido crecimiento de la poblacio´n del lago chamo se debe, fundamentalmente, a la temperatura templada y factores aso- ciados, y tambie´n a una mejor alimentacio´n, si bien las diferen- cias en la predacio´n y la presio´n pesquera tambie´n podrı´an ser factores importantes. acknowledgments we thank z. tadesse and the ﬁsheries research staff at lake zwai laboratory for their help in the ﬁeld work. z. tadesse has also commented on the manuscript. the study was ﬁnanced by the swedish agency for research cooperation with developing countries. references admassu, d. 1989. a study on the age and growth of adult oreochromis niloticus l.
