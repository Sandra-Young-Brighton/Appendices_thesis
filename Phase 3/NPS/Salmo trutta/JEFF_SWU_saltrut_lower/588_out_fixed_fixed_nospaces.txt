1013 ﬁsh positions with 10,130 emg records were further used for statistical analyses. energy consumption increased with decreasing mutual distance between specimens, an effect that occurred predominantly when both of them were simultaneously in overlapping preferred areas [core areas (cas)] appointed within their home ranges (hrs). furthermore, with increasing energy consumption individual’s movement range in longitudinal and lateral proﬁles decreased; i.e., the ﬁsh were positioned within a small area. when the cas of tested individuals did not overlap, no relationship between emg signals and mutual distance of conspeciﬁcs was found. our results indicate that movement activity and also social behaviour can be determined with physiological sensors. key words: siluriformes;

the height of the weirs were 3.8 m (50°09¢n, 15°48¢e; upstream) and 4.1 m (50°02¢n, 15°46¢e; down- stream). the river bottom was either covered with gravel and small boulders (rifﬂes and runs) or with sand and organic sediment (pools). riparian vegeta- tion was created by alder (alnus glutinosa), willow (salix alba), and poplar (populus alba). overhanging plants occasionally shadowed the riverbed, and woody debris only rarely occurred within the studied stretch. fish capture and tagging we caught four catﬁsh males by electro-ﬁshing (650 v, 4 a, pulsed dc). fish were anaesthetised with )1; merck kgaa, darm- 2-phenoxy-ethanol (0.2 mlæl stadt, germany), measured (standard length ls1 = 840; ls2 = 1280; ls3 = 1390 and ls4 = 1600 mm), and weighed (body mass, m1 = 4400; m2 = 13,000; m3 = 20,500 and m4 = 28,500 g). emg transmitters (cemg2–r11–25, 12 g in air, 11 · 49 mm, with an operational life of c. 71 days; lotek, new market, ontario, canada) were implanted into the body cavity through a midventral incision that was closed by three separate stitches using a sterile braided absorbable suture (ethicon-coated vicryl). the two electrodes of the surgically implanted emg transmitters were positioned in the red aerobic musculature below the lateral line on the left side of the ﬁsh. the distance between electrodes ranged from 10 to 12 mm (cooke et al. 2004a). individuals equipped with the emg transmitters were kept in cages immersed in the river stretch for a period of about 60 min, and then they were released at or near the point of capture. to obtain more complete and detailed records on small patterns instead of observing large numbers of of ﬁsh, individuals with lower et al. frequency (cooke 502 2004a), diurnal observations of emg tagged ﬁsh were performed. however, because the emg transmitters were being used in the wild and ﬁsh were mobile, the emg transmitters were implanted in only four indi- viduals. sampling procedures fish were monitored from 1 march to 31 may 2006. all individuals were tracked weekly (14 weeks in total) during the 48-h cycle using two radio receivers (lotek srx_600 w31, srx_400 w31) and a three- element yagi antenna equipped with a compass. fish positions were determined during 16 subsequent 3-h intervals. data on ﬁsh movements were transferred from gps to pc and analysed with the aid of map source version 5.3 (garmin ltd, kansas city, kansas, usa). a computer program was developed to obtain ﬁsh position coordinates and plot them on the map using the biangulation method proposed by white & garrott (1990). three times during each 3-h interval, a set of ten emg values (5-s burst rate) was obtained for all tagged individuals; i.e., 480 values were recorded during 48 h for one individual. the accuracy of ﬁsh positioning was estimated to be ±3 m according to 10 times repeated calibration of a tag located at the river bottom, the position of which an observer did not know. )1 (5.3–10.7 mgæl habitat measurements )1) water temperature (°c) and dissolved oxygen (mgæl were measured at the river bottom during each 3-h interval throughout the study by microprocessors (oxi 196 wtw). average recorded values (minimum – maximum) of measured physicochemical variables were 15.3 °c (9.3–22°c) for the temperature and )1) for the concentration of 6.9 mgæl dissolved oxygen. the light intensity (ev) was measured by seconic super zoom master l – 68 (seconic, tokyo, japan) and was determined at the observed locations of emg-tagged individuals during each 3-h interval. the elbe river authority measured )1) daily at the gauging station located the ﬂow (m3æs within the study stretch. long-term average ﬂow at the )1, and the average ﬂow study site was q330 = 55 m3æs )1, with a throughout the study period was 47 m3æs maximum of 105.2 and a minimum of 20.4 m3æs )1. data analyses the size of the catﬁsh hr was determined using the jennrich-turner (jennrich & turner 1969) method, which suggests that the 50% contour delineates the ca (clutton-brock et al. 1982). both the hrs and cas were calculated for every single diurnal cycle; i.e. hrs and cas were calculated twice for 48-h tracking cycle. the emg-coded transmitters permitted multiple transmitters to be monitored simultaneously at the same frequency. the voltage corresponding with muscle activity was rectiﬁed and sampled during a 5-s time period. the average value over this period was then determined and assigned an activity level that ranged from 0 to 50 (cooke et al. 2004a); these values are henceforth referred to as ‘emg values’. to obtain information on resting activity levels for standardising data, emg transmitters were individually calibrated for each ﬁsh. resting values were collected twice: from anaesthetised ﬁsh and prior to release, when ﬁsh were held in cages. recorded emg resting signals were subsequently considered a baseline value for a particular ﬁsh, and are henceforth referred to as ‘baseline emg value’ (cooke et al. 2004a). every single ‘ﬁnal emg value’ that entered the further analysis was equal to ‘recorded emg value’ minus ‘baseline emg value’. in total 2328 ﬁsh positions were obtained (fig. 1). although the position of the ﬁsh were located during each time interval, the signal in several cases was so weak that biangulation could not be precisely realised. if during a diurnal cycles it was not possible to track all specimens simultaneously, that cycle was removed from further analyses. after this ﬁrst cleaning procedure, data were further divided considering two situations: when electromyogram records of catﬁsh behaviour the cas of two individuals overlapped, and when they did not overlap. these data were subject of an additional cleaning procedure, and only data when both specimens were simultaneously inside or outside their cas (henceforth referred to as ‘presence in the ca’) were considered further (see fig. 1). based on the analyses, the relationship between mutual distance between two tagged individuals, movement activity, and intensity of emg signals was described. one-to-one analyses were done for all combinations of four individuals, obtaining pairs of individuals for particular tracking cycle. subsequently, emg and movement values of the individuals in each p pair were counted, obtaining variables referred to as ‘ movements’. the mutual distance of two individuals in each pair was p referred to as ‘mutual distance’. also computed, ‘ movements’, and ‘mutual distance’ were computed during each positioning. ﬁnal emg values’ and ‘ ﬁnal emg values’, ‘ p p data on light intensity ﬁrst entered the analysis as illumination (1 ev @ 5 lx; the absolute values of y = 0.6211e0.6943x, where y = lx, x = ev), which were referred to as the ‘intensity of illumination’. statistical analyses all data were analysed with the aid of the statistical package sas (version 9.1; sas institute inc. 2006). fig. 1. scheme of the study design includ- ing spatial distribution of two tagged indi- viduals (full-line – hr, dash line – ca) during speciﬁc observation on 14 may 2006 when the cas of individuals overlapped (a), and on 15 may 2006 when the cas of individuals did not overlap (b). 503 slavı´k & horky´ for associations between variables were tested using the general linear mixed model (glmm). the depen- dent variable was ‘mutual distance’. separate models were applied for situations when cas of two speci- mens overlap and⁄ or did not overlap. the data were log-transformed to meet the normality and homosce- dasticity requirements before glmm analyses. to repeated measurements on the same account individuals across different intervals and months during the period of observation, analyses were performed with individual ﬁsh id, an interaction between individual ﬁsh and time interval (id · time interval) and individual ﬁsh and month (id · month) as random factors, using the proc mixed (cary, nc, usa). fixed effects were classes ‘month’ (three levels) and ‘presence in the ca’ (two levels). contin- p uous variables were (21–187), ‘ movements’ (1–286 m), ‘intensity of illumination’ (0–15.6 ev), ‘water temperature’ (9.3–22.0°c), ‘ﬂow’ )1) and ‘dissolved oxygen’ (7.2– (20.4–105.2 m3æs )1). the signiﬁcance of each ﬁxed effect 16.7 mgæl ﬁnal emg’ p ‘ (including interactions) in the mixed glmm was assessed by f-test. backward procedure was used for ﬁxed effect selection, i.e., we started with a full model, and sequentially dropped the least-signiﬁcant effect. fixed effects that were not statistically signiﬁcant are not discussed further. associations between the dependent variable and other continuous variables were estimated by ﬁtting a random coefﬁcient model using the proc mixed, as described by tao et al. (2004). with this random coefﬁcient model, predicted values were calculated for the dependent variable and plotted against the continuous variable. the degrees of freedom were calculated using the kenward-roger method (kenward & roger 1997). results in total, 52 diurnal cycles of the catﬁsh were observed, and 1248 individual ﬁsh positions were determined, resulting in 12,480 records of emg signals. in total, 1013 individual ﬁsh positions with ; ; fig. 2. the relationship between mutual distance of two individuals and (a) sum of ﬁnal emg values when the cas of conspe- ciﬁcs overlapped and both of them were the curve was ﬁtted by inside ( y = )0.3446x + 2.1689; r2 = 0.41) or out- the curve was ﬁtted by side ( y = )0.0193x + 1.922; r2 = 0.001) cas simultaneously, and (b) sum of movements when the cas of conspeciﬁcs overlapped the and both of them were inside ( curve was ﬁtted by y = 0.0171x + 1.5303; r2 = 0.46) or outside ( the curve y = )0.0004x + 1.8946; was r2 = 0.0003) cas simultaneously. ﬁtted by 504 10,130 emg records were used for further statistical analysis (fig. 1). during the observation period, catﬁsh individuals were observed within the river stretch where they were caught and released after tagging. one week after release, the cas within the hrs were determined (fig. 1a, b). when the cas of conspeciﬁcs did not overlap, no relationship between mutual distance and tested explanatory variables was recorded. when the cas of conspeciﬁcs overlapped and both of them were inside cas simultaneously, a decrease in their mutual distance was predicted by an increase in sum of ﬁnal emg values (f2, 468 = 9.26; p < 0.0001; fig 2a) and a decrease in sum of movements (f2, 468 = 3.12; p < 0.04; fig. 2b); i.e., high emg values of approaching ﬁsh were associated with intensive activity within a small area. when the cas of conspeciﬁcs overlapped and both of them were outside cas simultaneously, trends of the relationship between mutual distance and the sum of ﬁnal emg values (fig 2a) or the sum of movements (fig 2b) were not possible to determine. the environmental variables tested (water temper- ature, ﬂow, dissolved oxygen and intensity of illumination and their interactions) were not found to have a signiﬁcant effect on the mutual distance of catﬁsh; i.e., the mutual distance of catﬁsh was not environmentally determined during the 3 months of the study period. discussion predictions of aggressiveness and, consequently, related changes in energy consumption, are not clearly described in the wild with regard to variability in energy consumption associated with different behavio- ural types (huntingford & turner 1987). our results tended to show that emg records can be used to indicate agonistic behaviour in the wild. in our study, it the emg signal increased with decreasing mutual distance of individuals, showing that energy consumption increased for individuals that existed closer to each other. as the catﬁsh prefers solitary hunting tactics (carol et al. 2007), is unlikely to presume that an increase in energy consumption occurs when conspeciﬁcs cooperate while hunting a small prey, as documented, for example, the percidae family (annett 1998). furthermore, high emg signals would result from hunting activity of individuals in the areas of prey aggregation, i.e., individuals might exploit the same school of prey ﬁsh. mass aggregation of south american catﬁsh within the area where their prey seasonally migrated was reported e.g., by barthem & goulding (1997). in such an event, however, a decrease in mutual distance of conspeciﬁcs would for electromyogram records of catﬁsh behaviour not be a cause for increased energy consumption. as documented by our results, an increase in emg values was associated with short-distance movements of catﬁsh within the overlapping cas, when mutual distance of conspeciﬁcs decreases, and individuals occur closer to each other. considering high aggres- siveness particularly of the catﬁsh males (copp et al. 2009), we assume that feeding behaviour was not the key reason for an increase in emg values. demers et al. (1996) recorded high emg activity even of stationary ﬁsh, which corresponds with our results displaying high energy consumption of ﬁsh occurring within a small area. our results show a negative correlation between mutual distance and energy consumption. at the same time, with decreas- ing mutual distance the sum of movements decreased, i.e., when the ﬁsh were close to each other their energy consumption was high, whilst movement activity low. hence, we can plausibly discuss our records in relation to agonistic behaviour of the catﬁsh. this behaviour is further supported by the fact that high emg values within a small area were recorded only when the catﬁsh cas overlapped. agonistic behaviour is a way in which the resources within the hr can be monopolised (grant 1997). to defend territory, ﬁsh use an overt aggressiveness resulting often in an individual’s injury and ⁄ or use an approach of ritual behaviour that precedes direct contact and limits injury (maan et al. 2001). both mechanisms are energetically demanding (neat et al. 1998). increased energy con- sumption is the result of a correlation between overt aggressiveness, display behaviour, locomotor activity and metabolic rate, as experimentally documented by ros et al. (2006). in wild riverine environments, the use of emg tags during diurnal cycles is limited by the number of individuals that can be simultaneously observed accurately. to describe the basic emg values for the period of resting and the period of most activity, all tagged individuals need to be observed throughout the whole diurnal cycle. furthermore, the hr size of large catﬁsh in wild is sufﬁciently large such that make accurate observations by conventional radio tags, only ﬁve individuals were observed (carol et al. 2007). correspondingly, to describe the spawning activity in salmonids, emg signals were recorded for only two and ⁄ or ﬁve individuals (kaseloo et al. 1996; thorstad et al. 2000). although studies observing adequately high numbers of individuals are generally preferable, in justiﬁed occasions, is appropriate to achieve detailed information about a limited number of individuals rather than having a large number of incomplete data (cooke et al. 2004a). according to the presented results, the emg records can be applied to reveal movement activity, as well the aggressive- ness of ﬁsh. it 505 slavı´k & horky´ acknowledgements the authors wish to thank two anonymous referees for valuable comments on the earlier version of the ms, the technical staff at the water research institute in prague for the assistance during the experimental period, and b. peletier and a. slavı´kova´ for the language assistance. the study was ﬁnancially supported by the ministry of environment of the czech republic within the frame of the mzˇ p 000 2071101 project. references annett, a.c. 1998. hunting behavior of florida largemouth in a channelized bass, micropterus salmoides ﬂoridanus, river. environmental biology of fishes 53: 75–87. barthem, r. & goulding, m. 1997. the catﬁsh connection. new york: columbia university press. boujard, t. 1995. diel rhythms of feeding activity in the european catﬁsh. silurus glanis physiology & behavior 58: 641–645. bradbury, c., green, j.m. & bruce-lockhart, m. 1995. home ranges of female cunner, tautogolabrus adspersus (labri- dae), as determined by ultrasonic telemetry. canadian journal of zoology 73: 1268–1279. carol, j., zamora, l. & garcı´a-berthou, e. 2007. preliminary telemetry data on the movement patterns and habitat use of european catﬁsh (silurus glanis) in a reservoir of the river ebro, spain. ecology of freshwater fish 16: 450–456. clutton-brock, t.h., guinness, f.e. & albon, s.d. 1982. red two sexes. edinburgh: deer: behaviour and ecology of edinburgh university press. cooke, j.s., chandroo, p.k., bedow, a.t., moccia, d.r. & mckinley, s.r. 2000. swimming activity and energetic expenditure of captive rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss (walbaum) estimated by electromyogram telemetry. aqua- culture research 31: 495–505. cooke, s.j., mckinley, r.s. & philipp, d.p. 2001. physical activity and behavior of a centrarchid ﬁsh, micropterus salmoides (lace´pe`de), during spawning. ecology of fresh- water fish 10: 227–237. cooke, s.j., philipp, d.p. & wheatherhead, p.j. 2002. parental care patterns and energetics of smallmouth bass, micropterus dolomieu, and largemouth bass m. salmoides, monitored with activity transmitters. canadian journal of zoology 80: 756– 770. cooke, s.j., thorstad, e.b. & hinch, s.g. 2004a. activity and energetics of free-swimming ﬁsh: insight from electromyo- gram telemetry. fish and fisheries 5: 21–52. cooke, s.j., hinch, s.c., wikelski, m., andrews, r.d., kuchel, l.j., wolcot, t.g. & butler, p.j. 2004b. biotelemetry: a mechanistic approach to ecology. trends in ecology & evolution 19: 334–343. copp, g.h., britton, r., cucherousset, j., garcı´a-berthou, e., kirk, r., peeler, e. & stak_enas, s. 2009. voracious invader or benign feline?
