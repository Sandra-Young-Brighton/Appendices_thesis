inoue & nunokawa 2002). the integration of factors across different spatial scales is important in determining the relationship between habitat and the distribution of riverine organisms (parsons et al. 2003; mcrae et al. 2004). an approach incorporating multi- ple spatial scales may provide the best predictive models of species distributions (brosse et al. 2003). three species of lamprey occur in ireland: brook lamprey [lampetra planeri (bloch)], river lamprey [lampetra ﬂuviatilis (linnaeus)] and sea lamprey (petromyzon marinus linnaeus) (igoe et al. 2004). for a comprehensive review of brook, river and sea lamprey ecology see maitland (2003) and hardisty & potter (1971). larval lampreys or ammocoetes are all ﬁlter feeders that live within river sediments. after a period of 3–5 years (in the uk), river and sea lamprey ammocoetes transform into parasitic forms and migrate towards the sea where they feed for an average of 2 years before returning to freshwater to reproduce. l. planeri ammocoetes transform after about 6.5 years (in the uk) into nonfeeding adults that are sexually mature and remain in freshwater (maitland 2003). whilst the inﬂuence of large (baxter 1954) and small (malmqvist 1980; beamish & lowartz 1996; sugiyama & goto 2002) scale habitat variables on lamprey ammocoete distribution have been examined individually, few studies have been undertaken that aim to examine lamprey distribution at multiple scales (but see almeida & quintella 2002; torgersen & close 2004). for ammocoetes, both large scale factors such as stream gradient (baxter 1954) and small scale factors such as particle size (manion & mclain 1971; 542 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00305.x beamish & lowartz 1996) have been found to be important in determining ammocoete abundance. however, examining how abundance is affected by factors on only one scale ignores the modifying effects of factors operating on other scales; these may prevent the colonisation of apparently suitable habitat. conse- quently, using a combination of variables on several habitat scales is often most effective at prediction of species distribution (mcrae et al. 2004). in this study, factors related to ammocoete (lampetra spp.) abun- dance in northern ireland at multiple scales were investigated: regional, catchment and microhabitat level. lampreys are considered to be endangered in much of europe (maitland 2003) and loss of larval lamprey hab- itat is a major contributing factor in their decline (kir- chhofer 1996). brook (l. planeri), river (l. ﬂuviatilis) and sea (p. marinus) lampreys are listed under annex ii of the european commission habitats directive (92 ⁄ 43 ⁄ eec) and member states are obliged to create special areas of conservation for them. information on lamprey distribution is severely lacking in ireland with almost no information from northern ireland (kelly & king 2001). identifying habitat factors that are related to ammocoete presence and abundance should aid in the selection of suitable sites for designation. it is not regarded that there is a signiﬁcant difference in habitat requirements between these closely related lampetra species (hardisty & potter 1971), and the ammocoetes are impossible to distinguish in the ﬁeld. therefore, we lamprey ammocoete habitat associations have not attempted to separate the two species for the purposes of this study. factors affecting ammocoete distribution at three scales (regional, catchment and microhabitat) were examined. the purpose of the study was to determine which habitat factors had the greatest inﬂuence on ammocoete distribution. such data is important infor- mation for managers of this protected species. as well as being generally applicable to other populations of lampetra spp. these data provide information on ammocoete distribution in northern ireland, an area where there is no prior information on ammocoete distribution or ecology. materials and methods the river habitat survey database (raven et al. 1997) was used to select potential sites in rivers with a water depth below 1 m at the bank, as above this depth backpack electroﬁshing is not safe. gis software (arcviewò, esri, redlands, california) was used to select sites visually from within these potential sites, 45 sites across northern ireland were surveyed in total. the number of sites sampled within each catchment was proportional to the percentage of northern ireland rivers the catchment contained. within catchments, sites were selected visually from an onscreen map to give a good geographic spread across the catchment (fig. 1). if access to a particular site proved impossible the closest accessible area was sampled. fig. 1. sampling locations within northern ireland (ballinderry catchment sampling sites are excluded). ammocoete presence ⁄ absence is indicated. 543 goodwin et al. (fig. 2), twenty-seven additional sites were sampled in the ballinderry river catchment to examine factors affecting ammocoete distribution at the catch- ment scale. sites within the ballinderry river were spaced at approximately 2 km intervals in the main channel and along the main tributaries, the smallest tributaries were not sampled. the majority of the northern ireland sites were the surveyed in summer remainder of these and all of the ballinderry sites were surveyed in summer 2003 (june–september). (june–september) 2002, environmental characteristics of the sites were assessed by sampling the bankside of the sites, as the majority of ammocoetes occur at stream margins (torgersen & close 2004). a set of 13 variables, reﬂecting general environmental conditions were measured once per site (table 1). to assess the within-site environmental heterogeneity, additional fig. 2. location of sampling sites within the ballinderry catchment. ammocoete presence ⁄ absence is indicated. stations consisted of (table 2). these variables were measured at 10 ‘stations’ within each site a 2 m · 0.5 m length of bank, giving a 1 m2 total sampling area per station. distance between stations was evenly spaced out over a length approximately equivalent to seven times the width of the river, theoretically to encompass a rpg sequence, with a minimum distance of at least 1 m between stations (leopold et al. 1964). sampling stations were spread out from 30–147 m along the river depending on river width. at each site only one bankside was sampled, usually the one closest to the access point. at each site, ph and speciﬁc conductivity (lsæcm )1) were recorded using a jenwayó 430 ph and conduc- tivity meter (felsted, essex, uk). water temperature (ºc) and percentage saturation dissolved oxygen were recorded using a jenwayó 9150 dissolved oxygen meter (temperature on the sampling day was measured table 1. explanatory variables used in the regression tree model for ammocoetes abundance by site (regional level). variables units range description ph speciﬁc conductance water temperature oxygen river width rpg length biological monitoring working party (bmwp) number of taxa aspt stream gradient distance to largest water body (sea or lough neagh) number of barriers rpg, rifﬂe, pool and glide;

educational field equipment, bodmin, cornwall, uk). sediment samples were taken from each station except where the river was either too swift, too deep or bedrock was present. samples were taken by hand using a trowel and sample pot to scoop sediment from a depth of approximately 10 cm; a bucket with the bottom removed was ﬁrst placed around the area to be sampled to isolate it from the ﬂow to avoid the loss of ﬁner fractions. sediment samples were dried at 70 °c and sieved for 10 min through a series of sizes of sieves from 16 mm to 45 lm. mud samples were dried and a small fraction (around 20 g) removed for wet sieving. from the weights obtained, the percentage of each wentworth grade in the sample was particle diameter using the modiﬁed krumbein phi scale [a logarithmic scale: u = )log2 (grain size mm)] and sorting of the sample were calculated (buchanan & kain 1971). determined. the median 545 goodwin et al. all stations were ﬁshed using a backpack electroﬁsher (electracatchô model wfc911, penn, wolverhampton, uk) with a two-person team. pulsed direct current at 40 pulses per second was used, as low pulse frequencies are most effective in catching ammocoetes (pajos & weise 1994). voltage was varied to allow for differing conductivities, that is, where river conductivity was low (<50 ls) the high voltage mode was used (between 200 and 400 v) and, where conductivities were greater than this, between 100 and 200 v were used. the station was electroﬁshed by holding the anode pole around 5 cm above the sediment and giving two bursts of current approximately 5 s long, and 10 s apart at each point. the operator started at the downstream end of the station and worked up the station until the whole surface area of the site had been covered in this manner. a second ﬁeld team member anode with a stood downstream of large (20 · 20 cm) hand net with 1 mm mesh. if an ammocoete emerged, ﬁshing was paused until the ammocoete had been caught and any disturbed sediment had settled, this ensured that other emerging ammocoetes were not missed. the captured ammocoetes and ﬁsh were placed in a bucket with a battery-operated air pump. upon completion of electroﬁshing for the whole site, all were anaesthetised with clove oil. there is no reliable way to differentiate between l. ﬂuviatilis and l. planeri ammocoetes in the ﬁeld (gardiner 2003). with the aid of a hand lens, ammocoetes were identiﬁed as being either brook ⁄ river or sea lamprey ammocoetes according to the criteria outlined in gardiner (2003), they were then measured using a measuring board. ammocoete length data were only collected from the ballinderry. statistical analyses because of the nature of the data collected (few sites to variables measured) we used a relatively new ensem- ble method of classiﬁcation and regression called random forest (breiman 2001) conducted in the open source statistical package r (r development core team 2005) using the add-on package randomforest (v4.5–15) (breiman et al 2005). random forest is an ensemble method of data analysis (see berk 2006 for an introduction to random forest). trees are created from a bootstrap sample of the data set, but before each tree is split a random sample of predictors is selected before each node split (berk 2006). this is done at each node and the tree is not pruned. each tree is produced from a random sample of sites and at each split from a random sample of predictors, creating a ‘random forest’ (breiman 2001). for the random forest analyses, four random variables were evaluated at each 546 node for site data and six random variables for station data (recommended default for regression trees is the number of variables divided by three), with 5000 trees created for the ‘forest’ and a default node size of ﬁve. variable importance can be assessed in random forest by per cent change in mean square error, and per cent node purity. the per cent change in mean square error of prediction (out of box sample) is calculated by replacing the predictor variable in the model with a random variable. the more important a variable, the greater the mean square error when randomised. ‘a second measure of variable importance is the total decrease in node impurities from splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. node impurity is measured by residual sum of squares’ (liaw & weiner 2005). the top variables are those that result in minimal variance within a node. although random forest provides a measure of variable importance, it does not provide an explicit model. while speciﬁc descriptive factors can be identiﬁed as important, how those factors are impor- tant is not provided. for example, if temperature is identiﬁed as being the most important variable, we do not know if ammocoete abundance increases or decreases with temperature or what value was used to partition the data. the top variables selected in random forest were used in a more traditional regression tree to ascertain how that particular variable was important. this was done using the r add-on package rpart (recursive partitioning and regression trees, v 3.1–27). (therneau, arunsun & ripley, 2005). a random forest analysis was conducted for each scale level (regional, catchment and microhabitat). at the regional (n = 72) and catchment level analyses (n = 27), sites were the unit of measure. for micro- habitat scale associations (stations), statistical analyses were restricted to those sites where ammocoetes were present (32 sites, 320 stations). stations with missing values were dropped leaving 226 stations for analysis. restricting analyses to sites where lamprey are present is based on the assumption that ammocoetes must be present within an area to actively choose a suitable habitat. in sites without lamprey, either large-scale and ⁄ or microhabitat factors not measured may have contributed to their absence, thus deleting these sites from analyses will provide a better measure of relevance of the measured habitat variables (gue´nette & villard 2004). missing values can be handled in random forest using an imputation procedure in r (rfimpute) to create a value that is the weighted average of the nonmissing values (breiman 2003). however, using the imputation procedure on such a large number of missing values would severely bias results. relationship between ammocoete length and dis- tance to lough neagh, and length and median particle lamprey ammocoete habitat associations diameter were examined using linear regression within the ballinderry catchment. the mean length of ammocetes at sites containing ammocoetes (n = 12) was plotted against distance to lough neagh. for median particle diameter mean length of ammo- coetes at stations containing ammocoetes (n = 37) was used. results all the rest only one sea lamprey ammocoete was collected (n = 253) were (kilkeel river), l. ﬂuviatilis ⁄ l. planeri. ammocoetes were present at 32 of 72 of sites (44%), and 110 of 720 stations (15%). at sites where ammocoetes were present, the mean )2, range: 0.10– density was 0.79 m 2.4 m )2 (sd ±0.68 m )2. )2) with a median of 0.55 m at the regional scale (across northern ireland) in an analysis of all sites (n = 72), ph was the most important variable for partitioning sites according to ammocoete abundance (table 3). the rpart analysis revealed a best split at a ph of 8.16. at sites with a ph £8.16 (n = 62) abundance was 2.6 ammocoetes per site, and for those sites with a higher ph (n = 10), abundance was 9.5 ammocoetes per site (rpart: r2 = 0.161). ammocoete abundance increased with ph (r2 = 0.0865, f1, 70 = 6.63, p = 0.0122; fig. 3). in a random forest analysis of sites where lamprey were present (n = 32), distance to a large water body (i.e., lough neagh or the sea) was the most important variable abundance (results not reported). sites <9.6 km from a major water body had a greater abundance of ammocoetes (n = 8, mean of 14.5) compared with sites farther rpart: r2 = 0.316). away (n = 24, mean of 5.75;

rpart: r2 = 0.256). the correlation between barriers and distance to a large water body also held at the larger scale across all sites in northern ireland (r2 = 0.13, f1, 70 = 10.25, p = 0.0021). at the microhabitat scale, station was the unit of measure. although ‘site’ is an important factor, it was not included in the analyses at the station level, as it only indicates a positive correlation among stations within a site. in other words, ammocoetes are more likely to be found at a particular station if other stations within a site contain ammocoetes. results from the random forest analysis at the microhabitat level revealed that sediment diameter (median phi) explained the most variation in ammocoete abundance (table 5). for node purity the top variable was 548 this is equivalent kurtosis, a measure of sediment diameter distribution (peakedness). as there was not concordance between the two importance measures we examined the top two variables separately using rpart. the rpart analysis revealed the best median phi-value for partitioning the data was 0.0588, to a sediment diameter of 1.94 mm, (very coarse sand fraction). stations with median phi-values ‡0.0588 had a mean of 1.61 ammocoetes ⁄ station compared with an average 0.500 ammocoetes for stations with a median phi below this value (i.e., larger diameter sediments) (rpart: r2 = 0.0891). stations with larger diameter sediments had fewer ammocoetes (r2 = 0.0530, f1, 224 = 13.6, p = 0.0003). ammocoetes were more abundant when kurtosis was >1.71, indicating a leptokurtic (peaked) distribution of sediment size with the central portion of the distribution being well sorted (low variance in sediment diameter). stations with a kurtosis <1.71 had an average of 0.981 ammocoetes, while those equal to or greater had an average of 2.6 ammocoetes (rpart: r2 = 0.0473). stations with a sediment depth ‡11.5 cm contained on average 1.97 ammocoetes per station (n = 73) compared with an average of 0.667 ammocoetes per station with sedi- ment depths <11.5 cm (n = 153) (rpart: r2 = 0.109). in the ballinderry catchment 83 ammocoetes were captured and measured ranging in size from 52 to 172 mm. there was no signiﬁcant relationship between ammocoete length and distance to lough neagh (r2 = 0.0433, f1,10 = 0.0435, p = 0.839) or median particle diameter (median phi) (r2 = 0.00124, f1,35 = 0.475, p = 0.495). discussion ammocoete occurrence was related to factors operat- ing at each of the scales examined. at a regional scale, ammocoete abundance was associated with high river ph. at sites where ammocoetes were present at the regional scale, abundance was related to distance to a large water body; more ammocoetes were found at sites that were closer to the sea or lough neagh. although the regression between ammocoete number and distance to large water body (at sites with lamprey) was not the p = 0.05 level, important variable identiﬁed in the random forest analysis. within the ballinderry catchment, where ammocoetes are known to occur, abundance was negatively related to the number of barriers downstream. at the microhabitat scale median phi (grain diameter) and kurtosis [sed- iment diameter (phi) distribution], and sediment depth were the most inﬂuential variables. statistically signiﬁcant at it was the most these results conﬁrm the ﬁndings of other studies, indicating that ammocoete distribution does not appear to be random (kelso & todd 1993; beamish & jebbink 1994; ojutkangas et al. 1995; torgersen & close 2004). these distributions may not necessarily demonstrate ammocoete habitat preferences, but may rather random distribution with differential mortality (olabarria et al. 2002). however, laboratory studies have shown that ammocoetes are able to select for particular habitats (kelso 1993; sugiyama & goto 2002), therefore it seems likely that distribution patterns may be explained at least in part by active selection. relate to differential settlement or many ﬁsh communities are structured around ph gradients, with species abundance and diversity generally negatively correlated with acidity (e.g., matuszek et al. 1990; pinder & morgan 1995). lamprey ammocoetes have been found to be posi- tively associated with more alkaline rivers (polı´ckova et al. 1998). within northern ireland, sites with ph lamprey ammocoete habitat associations ‡8.16 contained more ammocoetes than sites with a lower ph. in these previous studies ph range was much greater than reported here (see table 1). whilst ph may be important in limiting ammocoete distribu- tion and abundance, the effect may be partly because of underlying factors such as climate, bedrock type, land-use and watershed capacity which may all inﬂuence ph (potapova & charles 2002). appear distance to a large water body and presence of potential migration barriers to inﬂuence ammocoete abundance. although presence of barriers was identiﬁed as being important only at the catch- ment level, there is a strong correlation between this and distance to a large water body and it is likely the two factors are interlinked. for ammocoetes of migratorg species (l. ﬂuviatilis and p. marinus) to be present, adult lamprey need to have access to breeding habitats from their feeding ground. migratory lamprey in northern ireland will be travelling from either the sea or lough neagh, where a freshwater feeding population of l. ﬂuviatilis is believed to be present (goodwin et al. 2006). adult lamprey may be pre- vented from spawning by barriers to their upstream migration (polı´ckova et al. 1998; moser et al. 2002). in addition to barriers, other river modiﬁcations may affect lamprey migration; many rivers have been extensively altered for power generation, navigation and ﬂood control. consequently, migratory species may have been unable to reach spawning sites further upstream, resulting in lower ammocoete densities. although l. planeri adults do not migrate out of rivers to feed they do migrate upstream to ﬁnd suitable spawning substrates (hardisty & potter 1971), so also require clear migration routes, albeit over shorter distances than the migratory l. ﬂuviatilis. however, as they remain in the river system their distribution may be less affected by barriers in the lower reaches of rivers. although transformers may be identiﬁed to species level (gardiner 2003), at present it is impossible to distinguish between ammocoetes of lampetra spp. in the ﬁeld. the importance of barrier number in determining ammocoete abundance at the catchment level but not at regional scales may indicate that a greater proportion of the ammocoetes within the ballinderry catchment are migratory l. ﬂuviatilis. l. ﬂuviatilis would be prevented from colonising areas upstream of impassable barriers whereas the persis- tence of l. planeri populations would not be as affected by barriers. upstream migrants of l. ﬂuviatilis have been trapped in the ballinderry at coagh weir but not at a weir further upstream at kildress (goodwin 2004). between the coagh and kildress weirs there are an additional two weirs. although these additional weirs are ﬁtted with box ﬁsh passes, the high ﬂow inside these may prevent lamprey 549 goodwin et al. (2003) suggests passage (laine et al. 1998) potentially restricting l. ﬂuviatilis to the ballymully tributary of the river which has no weirs. maximum length for l. ﬂuviatilis and l. planeri transformers have been reported as 119 mm (hardisty & huggins 1970) and 175 mm (hardisty 1986). gardiner that ammocoetes over 120 mm are likely to be l. planeri. based on this rough size classiﬁcation our length data that l. planeri are from the ballinderry suggest present the river. ammocoetes ‡120 mm was found throughout the catchment with no apparent distribution pattern. revisting sampling stations to sample for transformers might give some indication of the two species present; however, even this would not be conclusive as ammocoetes are likely to move between stations. in addition, older ammocoetes, and hence transformers, are less likely to be found at sites further upstream in an underestimation of which might the number of sites at which l. ﬂuviatilis is present. the proportions of in all areas of result ammocoete length was not signiﬁcantly greater in downstream reaches of the ballinderry, as has been found in other studies (baxter 1954; potter 1970). the presence of multiple spawning sites in the river and or the presence of l. planeri in the upper reaches of the river (valtonen 1980) may account for the lack of a relationship between ammocoete length and river kilometre. is generally thought at smaller scales it that sediment characteristics are key factors related to ammocoetes abundance (manion & mclain 1971; beamish & jebbink 1994; beamish & lowartz 1996). sediment depth has been found to be important in determining both ammocoete distribution (apem 2001; sugiyama & goto 2002) and abundance (apem 1999) and it has been demonstrated experimentally that ammocoetes will chose the deepest sediment available (kelso 1993). deeper areas of sediment also provide a greater volume for colonisation so the abundance may be partly related to the carrying capacity of different areas. in this study ammocoetes were more abundant when sediment depth was >11.5 cm. lamprey ammocoetes may be found in a variety of sediments (baxter 1954); in this study they were found at sites with median phi values ranging from )7.35 (cobble) to 3.81 (silt). however, particle size was shown to have an inﬂuence on abundance. ammoco- ete abundance was associated with a median phi ‡1.94 (very coarse sand), than the 0.05–0.20 mm class found to be associated with l. ﬂuviatilis abundance by kainua & valtonen (1980) and the 0.5–1 mm range that l. ﬂuviatilis has been shown experimentally to select for (kelso 1993). very small sediment particles, such as clay fractions, can compact and prevent movement into the sediment (young et al. 1990) they may also clog gill lamellae somewhat coarser 550 results there was a signiﬁcant gradient (beamish & jebbink 1994). at the other end of the scale, very large particles (e.g., coarse gravel and pebbles) prevent burrow construction (beamish & jebbink 1994). ammocoetes are able to select for particular sediment sizes (kelso 1993) and may therefore actively colonise areas with more favourable conditions. ammocoetes were shown to be more abundant in well-sorted sediments, it is possible that these provide better conditions for burrow construc- tion. ammocoete distribution in other species has been shown to vary by size, with smaller individuals associated with ﬁner sediments (almeida & quintella 2002; sugiyama & goto 2002). it has been shown experimentally (quintella et al. 2007) that smaller (p. marinus l.) ammocoetes have difﬁculty burrowing into coarser sediments. however, in the ballinderry we found no relationship between ammocoete length and particle size; it may be that there are inter-speciﬁc differences in burrowing behaviour. from the microhabitat scale (table 5) revealed that station order was the third most impor- tant variable listed under increase in node purity, yet it was the least important variable according to change in mean square error. this result may indicate a slight bias. a more detailed examination of the data revealed that in the mean number of ammocoetes observed depending on the order of 8 = 13.9, p = 0.0058). stations were sampled from downstream to upstream with ammocoete abundance declining upstream. river width determined the length of stream sampled (rpg = river width · 7). so, the wider a stream, the greater the distance between stations. the minimum size stream width sampled was 2 m, while the largest stream was 21 m, the distance between stations at a site ranged from 1 to 12.7 m. sampling disturbance may have been greater between adjacent stations in smaller streams, resulting in more lamprey being collected on the downstream stations (ﬁrst couple of stations sampled). a potential explanation for the electrical ﬁeld from the electroshocker extended into adjacent station sites, and or the physical disturbance created by sampling was detected by ammocoetes upstream and they responded in a way that decreased capture (e.g., burrowing deeper) as sampling progressed upstream. while there is evidence of a slight bias we do not believe that the results have been greatly affected, as there was little evidence of its importance according to the change in mean square error. thus, when sampling multiple stations, one should strive to ensure that sampling in one station does not impact neighbouring stations (e.g., increase distance between stations). station (r2 = 0.634, f1, the bias is that the both large- and small-scale factors inﬂuence ammocoete distribution within northern ireland. from a management perspective the number of barriers is perhaps the most important factor. adult lamprey may be prevented from spawning by barriers to their upstream migration (granado-lorencio 1991; polı´ck- ova et al. 1998; moser et al. 2002). even where lamprey are able to overcome these barriers, this expends energy and can result in a delay in the spawning migration (almeida et al. 2002), conse- quently ammocoete populations may become frag- mented or even extinct systems (waterstraat & krappe 1998). there is little informa- tion on the suitability of ﬁsh passes for lamprey, thus in many cases these are inappropriately designed (haro & kynard 1997). even where other anadromous species can pass through, the water velocities and the material that the passes are constructed from often prevent lamprey from doing so (laine et al. 1998). we would recommend and encourage the removal and ⁄ or modiﬁcation of barriers to ﬁshes to facilitate lamprey passage. in some river acknowledgements we would like to thank wesley adair, clare aughey, david goodwin, jaimie johnston, gillian riddel and sharon stewart for assistance with ﬁeldwork;
