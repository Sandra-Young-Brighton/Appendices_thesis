ligon et al. 1998; marchetti 1998; candolin 2003). in addition, multiple ornaments have been suggested to give different signals to mates and to same-sex rivals according to a ‘multiple receiver hypothesis’ (andersson et al. 2002). how- ever, most tests of these hypotheses, so far, have been conducted on single populations. the reproductive tactic in ﬁshes with morphological adaptations, like secondary sexual characters, can be subject to both intrasexual and intersexual selection (taborsky 2001), which may allow the ‘multiple receiver hypothesis’ to apply. an increasing number of studies have found that females base their mate choice on several cues (see male roach, rutilus rutilus, develop sexual orna- ments in the form of breeding tubercles (bts; wiley & 119 kortet & taskinen collette 1970; taskinen & kortet 2002; kortet et al. 2003) during the breeding season. their male–male spawning-related interactions include aggressive pok- ing and butting (wedekind 1996; kortet 2003). in roach, the different parts of bt ornamentation have been found to give detailed information of load of certain parasites (wedekind 1992). moreover, in our previous work, we reported that the bts on the lateral sides and operculum (henceforth ‘lateral bts’) of roach correlate with resistance (i.e., proportion of dead parasite specimens in ﬁsh tissue) against rhipidocotyle campanula, a prevalent digenean trematode parasite (taskinen & kortet 2002). as a continuation of that study, we report here the results of a study on another component of sexual ornamentation, the number of bts on the front head (henceforth ‘head bts’) of the ﬁsh from ﬁve separated populations in relation to (i) host resistance (proportion of dead parasites; two parasite species), (ii) parasite load (intensity; ﬁve parasite species), (iii) immune function (spleen size), (iv) somatic condition and (v) lateral bts. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the sexual ornamentation of roach under the scenario of the multiple message hypothesis of sexual orna- mentation. as the lateral bts of roach were previously found to be related to parasite resistance (taskinen & kortet 2002), the multiple message hypothesis of sexual ornaments predicts that head bts of roach should be related to other aspects of male quality than parasite resistance. materials and methods we selected ﬁve parasites of roach to study the relationship between ornamentation and parasite load or parasite resistance. three of the parasites occur on the gills: r. campanula (digenea), paradiplozoon homoion (monogenea) and myxobolus sp. (protozoa). two of the parasites occur in the liver: raphidascaris acus (nematoda) and myxobolus mu¨ lleri (protozoa). these were chosen because (i) they were abundant in roach in the study area (brummer-korvenkontio et al. 1991; koskivaara & valtonen 1991; taskinen et al. 1991; valtonen et al. 1997); (ii) they were expected to be quite harmful (see e.g., bauer & zmerzlaja 1973; baturo 1977; poole & dick 1984; hoffmann et al. 1990; shul’man 1990; valtonen et al. 1994); and (iii) they occurred in different tissues of ﬁsh. in addition, wedekind (1992) had previously shown that the number of bts on the head and body sides of male roach could reveal diplozoon and nematoda infec- tions, respectively. we chose r. campanula and r. acus to study the proportion of dead parasite individuals as a measure of host resistance. we chose the former based on our previous experience in separating dead and living larvae in tissues of roach (see taskinen & kortet 2002) and the latter as valtonen et al. (1994) reported that both dead and living larvae were present in the liver of roach throughout the year in the present study area. as a measure of immune function, we used the relative spleen size (ratio of spleen weight to somatic weight without internal organs) as the spleen is assumed to be an essential secondary lymphatic organ in ﬁsh (manning 1994). this measure has also been used in earlier immunoecological studies (e.g., møller et al. 1999; kortet et al. 2002). using gill net, dip nets and angling, we collected sexually mature (conﬁrmed by dissection) male roach from ﬁve populations close to the city of jyva¨skyla¨, finland (lake konnevesi, lake pa¨ija¨nne, lake lah- naja¨rvi, lake jyva¨sja¨rvi and lake saravesi) during the spawning period, between 19 and 26 may 1999 (table 1). the ﬁsh material was the same as was used previously to study the relationships between lateral bts and condition, parasitism, resistance and immune functions (taskinen & kortet 2002). the details of ﬁsh sampling, as well as lateral bt ornamentation and prevalences and intensities of parasitism, are given by taskinen & kortet (2002). killed ﬁsh were transported and stored on wet paper tissues on ice in a cool box. each day, we caught the ﬁsh in the late evening and examined them during the next morning. in the laboratory, we counted the number of front head bts and also ranked males into three groups according to their lateral bts: (i) no bts or very few or only very small tubercles, smooth skin; (ii) bts clearly present, slightly or moderately rough skin; and (iii) rough skin with many large tubercles. this ranking method is repeatable (see taskinen & kortet 2002). table 1. male roach collected from ﬁve populations during the spawning period in 1999: date, total number of individuals, mean (±se) length, mean (±se) number of bts on the front head of ﬁsh (head bts) and proportion of ﬁshes having head bts. date total length (mm) head bts proportion (%) konnevesi may 19 29 154 ± 3 12.2 ± 2.8 100 pa¨ija¨nne may 25 38 155 ± 3 23.1 ± 4.5 82 lahnaja¨rvi may 23 52 148 ± 2 33.6 ± 3.7 87 jyva¨sja¨rvi may 26 45 189 ± 3 58.5 ± 4.1 100 saravesi may 21 30 142 ± 2 5.7 ± 1.5 100 details of collection methods, and prevalences and intensities of infection by parasites are given by taskinen & kortet (2002). 120 we measured ﬁsh length, total weight, somatic weight (gonads and internal organs removed) and spleen weight. we then examined parasites from the gills and liver microscopically by using transmitted light, pressing the tissues between two large glass plates. we counted the number of dead and living r. campanula and r. acus. live r. campanula were moving inside the metacercarial cyst. dead r. cam- panula were motionless and more or less brownish in colour because of variable degree of melanization, and often clearly degenerated. dead r. acus were motion- less, partly or totally encysted, and at various degree of degeneration, while living worms were moving vig- orously (see taskinen & kortet 2002 for the repeat- ability of the method). the somatic condition of ﬁsh (condition factor, k) was calculated using the equation k ¼ somatic weight (g) ⁄ (length (cm))3 (bolger & connolly 1989). to analyse the proportion of dead r. campanula and r. acus in relation to head bts, we selected males that were infected with at least three parasite individ- uals. for r. campanula, sufﬁcient numbers of ﬁsh were available were lake konnevesi, lake jyva¨sja¨rvi and lake saravesi, and for r. acus, from all the study populations. the prevalence of p. homoion was too low for the analyses in lake pa¨ija¨nne, lake jyva¨sja¨rvi and lake saravesi. we performed statistical analyses using spss (spss, inc., chicago, usa). the relationship between head bts (continuous variable) and lateral bts (three classes) was studied using ancova, with ﬁsh length as a covariate. other relationships between studied parameters were analysed using spearman and pear- son correlation analyses, the former for non-normally distributed variables if transformations (logarithmic or arcsin) did not result in normal distributions. normal- ity of distributions was tested using the shapiro–wilks test (see zar 1999). because the length as a covariate was signiﬁcant in ancovas for lake jyva¨sja¨rvi and lake saravesi (see below), partial correlation analyses were used to control the effect of length in these popu- lations. to be able to use partial correlation analysis in those populations, normally distributed numbers of head tubercles were achieved by omitting zero obser- vations and by using logarithmic transformations for sexual ornaments of roach head bts. however, when normality could not be achieved by any method, spearman correlation analy- ses were used. moreover, because the calculation of condition factor includes length, the effect of ﬁsh length was not partialled out for condition factor. results the mean number of head bts varied from 6 to 59 among the studied populations (table 1). results of ancova indicated that head bts were positively related to lateral bts in lake pa¨ija¨nne and lake lahnaja¨rvi (table 2). the length as a covariate was signiﬁcant in lake konnevesi and lake saravesi (table 2). number of head bts increased with ﬁsh size in these populations. statistics for the correlations of head bts to parasite resistance, condition, immune function and parasitism are given in table 3. proportions of dead r. campan- ula and r. acus did not correlate with head bts in any of the study populations. condition of ﬁsh correlated positively with head bts in lake saravesi (spear- man’s r ¼ 0.398; n ¼ 30; p ¼ 0.029). the measure of immune function, the relative spleen size, correlated negatively with head bts in another population, r ¼ )0.329; n ¼ 45; lake lahnaja¨rvi p ¼ 0.027).

ﬁve populations of roach. a total of 51 parasite taxa have been reported from roach in our study area (e.g., koskivaara et al. 1991a,b; halmetoja et al. 1992; valtonen etal. 1997), not the parasitism may vary extensively between roach pop- ulations. it is possible that the information a male signals with his tubercles may vary, depending on the local variation in parasite communities and current coevolutionary cycles between host and parasites, as suggested by hamilton & zuk (1982). in lake saravesi, male roach, which had many head bts, were in good condition and had few r. campanula parasites. moreover, a negative relationship between head bts and numbers of m. mu¨ lleri was found in lake jyva¨sja¨rvi. this result suggests that head bts may signal parasitism, which could be in accordance with the prediction of the parasite hypothesis of sexual selection by hamilton & zuk (1982). however, in contradiction to that, a positive correlation was found between the number of the liver nematode, r. acus, and head bts in lake lahnaja¨rvi. this discrepancy between lake saravesi and lake lahnaja¨rvi may be caused by their different parasite community structure, as r. campanula is almost absent from lake lah- naja¨rvi (taskinen & kortet 2002). these ﬁndings suggest that variability in the interplay between sexual signals and the factors that produce and maintain them in natural populations may be higher than we have thought. among roach in lake bielersee (switzerland), head bts have been reported to correlate with ﬁsh condition (wedekind 1992). more- over, in one population of another cyprinid, european minnow (phoxinus phoxinus), the number of head bts was positively related to size and condition of a ﬁsh, 122 and the size of the head bts was positively related to the parasitism by two trematode species (mu¨ller & ward 1995). study, another facet of in a previous in three of our sexual ornamentation of roach – lateral bts – was related to resistance against the predominant parasite, r. cam- panula, roach populations (lake saravesi, lake jyva¨sja¨rvi and lake konnevesi), but not to parasite numbers, condition or immune func- tions (taskinen & kortet 2002). the present results indicated that the head bts were not related to parasite resistance in any of the studied populations, but were immune function and correlated with condition, parasite load depending on population. thus, two different aspects of sexual signalling in r. rutilus – head bts and lateral bts – may signal different aspects of male quality. our ﬁndings are in accordance with the study by wedekind (1992) in which the head bts and bts measured from the body sides of roach correlated with loads of different species of parasites. taken together, the results may support the multiple message hypothesis of sexual ornamentation (møller & pomiankowski 1993; ligon et al. 1998; marchetti 1998; candolin 2003). in ﬁshes, multiple secondary sexual characters are known, for example, among the feral guppy, poecilia reticulate (brooks & caithness 1995), and the green swordtail, xiphophorus helleri (basolo & trainor 2002). a status badge (such as bt ornamentation) may signal good quality to females, as well as to males. furthermore, male contests often may favour the same signal traits that females prefer, which can accelerate the evolution of (andersson 1994; berglund et al. 1996). in european minnow, the head bts have been suggested to be primarily weapons for those traits male–male conﬂicts, but could also be used by the females in mate choice (mu¨ ller & ward 1995). likewise, in roach, head bts could be targeted at both males and females. there are observations of male– male interactions in mating roach, where ﬁsh have been noted to butt and poke each other aggressively (wede- kind 1996; kortet 2003). in addition, butting of the anterior side of a female by male roach is also common during courtship (diamond 1985; wedekind 1996; kortet 2003). in general, however, different facets of male sexual ornamentation have been suggested to be targeted at males or at females (andersson et al. 2002). in roach, lateral bts may be assumed to be targeted mainly at the female, as during spawning, a male adheres to the female laterally (diamond 1985). a signal of good condition, in general, may be important information to other rival males (to evaluate ﬁghting ability) and, as a signal of parasite resistance, provide valuable information to females. as a continuation of previous ﬁndings, the present study gives support to the multiple message hypothe- sis of sexual ornamentation in ﬁshes and demonstrates that different aspects of sexual ornamentation of male roach may signal various aspects of quality, such as condition, parasite load and parasite resistance. resumen 1. en un estudio previo sobre los machos de r. rutilus, encontramos una correlacio´ n positiva entre la ornamentacio´ n sexual, los tube´rculos reproductivos laterales (bts) y la resistencia a los para´sitos. como continuacio´ n de ese estudio, hemos examinado otra medida de ornamentacio´ n sexual, el nu´ mero de bts en el frontal de la cabeza en machos de cinco poblaciones. 2. los bts de la cabeza estuvieron positivamente correlacio- nados con el taman˜ o de los peces en dos poblaciones y con la condicio´ n en una poblacio´ n pero no con la resistencia a los para´sitos (proporcio´ n de para´sitos muertos) en ninguna de las poblaciones. sin embargo, los bts de la cabeza estuvieron negativamente correlacionados con el nu´ mero de dos para´sitos (r. campanula y m. mu¨ lleri) en dos poblaciones pero positiv- amente con el nu´ mero de un tercer para´sito (r. acus) en una poblacio´ n. ademas, detectamos una correlacio´ n negativa con el taman˜ o de la irritacio´ n. 3. estos resultados sugieren que los bts de la cabeza de los machos de r. rutilus – aunque los patrones varien entre poblaciones – pueden sen˜alar la condicio´ n y carga de para´sitos pero no la resistencia, al contrario que los btrs laterales. por ello, nuestros resultados son consistentes con la hipo´ tesis de ornamentacio´ n sexual muti-mensaje. acknowledgements we are grateful
