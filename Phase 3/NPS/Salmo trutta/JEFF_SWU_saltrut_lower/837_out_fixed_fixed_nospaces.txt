percidae) that occur along river gradients. this study addressed three specific questions: is there intraspecific geographic variation in the two species across different sites in the ozark highlands of oklahoma (usa)? is phenotypic variation across sites correlated with abiotic environmental conditions? do the two species share site- specific (i.e. convergent) phenotypic variation in areas where they occur together? our results indicated significant body shape variation in both species. population differences in body shape were particularly correlated with variation in substrate composition. the combined analysis of both species indicated a small but significant effect of convergence on body shape wherever they are sympatric; shared variation, however, was not related to any environmental variables included in the analysis. while it remains unclear whether phenotypic variation in these species is due to heritable differentiation or environmentally induced plasticity, our results indicate that even subtle and gradual environmental variation can induce substantial variation in phenotypes on a relatively small spatial scale. key words: environmental variation; etheostoma flabellare; etheostoma spectabile; geometric morphometrics; local adaptation; river gradients introduction environmental variation affects biological processes at all levels of organisation, scaling from subcellular biochemical processes to ecosystem dynamics. from an evolutionary perspective, spatial environmental variation is an important source of divergent selection driving phenotypic evolution, local adaptation and even speciation (schluter 2000; kawecki & ebert 2004; rundle & nosil 2005). evolutionary responses to divergent selection are often studied in proximate habitats that differ in one or few key environmental parameters, whereby habitats are typically classified into dichotomous categories, such as cave vs. surface (dowling et al. 2002; tobler et al. 2008), low vs. or benthic vs. 2007) limnetic high predation (reznick & endler 1982; langerhans et al. habitats (bernatchez et al. 1996; mckinnon & rundle 2002). this approach has been extremely fruitful, leading to the documentation of a broad spectrum of abiotic and biotic factors shaping physiological, morphological and life-history traits in a wide variety of study systems (schluter & nagel 1995; e.g. langerhans & dewitt 2004; vamosi 2005; riesch et al. 2010; tobler et al. 2011). for many systems, we are gain- ing an increasing understanding of both the func- tional significance of divergent traits (ghalambor et al. 2004; langerhans 2009) and their genomic jones et al. underpinnings 2012). moreover, evidence for the deterministic (renaut et al. 2011; correspondence: michael tobler, division of biology, kansas state university, 116 ackert hall, manhattan, ks 66506, usa. e-mail: tobler@ksu.edu 4 doi: 10.1111/eff.12245 nature of natural selection comes from comparative studies, indicating that independent evolutionary lin- eages show similar (i.e. convergent) patterns of trait differentiation when exposed to similar sources of divergent selection (krabbenhoft et al. 2009; landry & bernatchez 2010; franssen 2011; tobler & hast- ings 2011). while the recognition of distinct habitat types has provided crucial insights about the role of abiotic and biotic environmental variation in shaping evolution- ary trajectories of different populations, many organ- isms are exposed to more subtle and gradual, but often multifarious, sources of divergent selection. here, we were interested in investigating whether two stream fish species exhibit geographic variation in body shape across the ozark highland ecoregion. in addition, we tested whether environmental varia- tion across study sites predicts morphological varia- tion and whether the two species show convergent patterns of differentiation across sites. streams have long been recognised for exhibiting complex environ- mental gradients with abiotic and biotic factors covarying from headwater streams to lowland rivers (vannote et al. 1980; allan 1995). the effects of environmental variation in streams on shaping the composition of biotic communities have been studied in great detail (e.g. godinho et al. 2000; arrington et al. 2005; mykr€a et al. 2007), but knowledge about the evolutionary effects on populations remains rela- tively scarce (but see langerhans 2008; schaefer et al. 2011; haas et al. 2015). we focused our study on two species of darters, etheostoma flabellare (fantail darter) and etheostoma spectabile (orangethroat darter), that are common throughout the ozark highlands in the state of okla- homa, usa. darters are small-bodied stream fishes and among the most diverse freshwater fish groups in north america (near et al. 2011). most darters are sexually dimorphic, with males exhibiting bright nup- tial coloration, and show a diversity of reproductive behaviours (kelly et al. 2012). they mostly inhabit lotic environments in the united states east of the rocky mountains and generally have a benthic life style (kuehne & barbour 1983; page 1983). hence, darters exhibit a reduced swim bladder (evans & page 2003) and eco-morphological modifications mediating adaptation to variation in water depth, flow and substrate composition (carlson & wainwright 2010; carlson & lauder 2011). consequential to a benthic life style, many darter species have a low propensity to disperse (reed 1968; ingersoll et al. 1984; freeman 1995), which can also be reflected in strong population genetic structuring (beneteau et al. 2009; haponski et al. 2009; austin et al. 2011). this high site fidelity renders darters as excellent study objects for examining phenotypic differentiation in body shape variation in darters to environmental variation, locally response restricted divergent selection may outweigh the homogenising effects of gene flow (storfer et al. 1999; r€as€anen & hendry 2008). as we addressed the following questions: (i) is there geographic (i.e. site-specific) variation in the body shape of e. spectabile and e. flabellare? we used geometric morphometric analysis of body shape to quantify geographic variation across 30 sites in the ozark highlands of oklahoma. (ii) is intraspecific geographic variation correlated with environmental differences among sites? we tested whether morpho- logical variation among populations is correlated with environmental variation using a dual approach. in addition, we tested for the effects of geographic dis- tance on body shape differences among populations, as spatially proximate populations may exhibit more similar body shapes due to potential homogenising effects of gene flow. (iii) is there a signal of conver- gent evolution in morphological variation between species, and what environmental characteristics corre- late with convergent aspects of body shape? analys- ing e. spectabile and e. flabellare from sites where both species occur sympatrically, we identified shared site-specific morphological variation between the species. we tested whether potential convergence in morphology was correlated with environmental conditions to identify factors potentially driving con- vergent body shape evolution. methods study species etheostoma spectabile (fig. 1a) is a robust darter of the subgenus oligocephalus, exhibits pronounced sexual dichromatism and reaches up to 74 mm in standard length (kuehne & barbour 1983; page 1983). the species lives in shallow gravel and cobble riffles of small to medium sized streams, but both young and adults can also occupy pools with little or no flow (winn 1958; ceas & page 1997). etheos- toma spectabile inhabits much of the central united states, ranging from south-eastern michigan and ohio to eastern wyoming, south to tennessee and northern texas (distler 1968; kuehne & barbour 1983; page 1983). throughout its range, the species exhibits considerable variation in phenotypic traits, including morphology, physiology and life history (feminella & matthews 1984; marsh 1984; ceas & page 1997). spawns between early february and late may (miller & robison 2004). in oklahoma, species this etheostoma flabellare (fig. 1b) is part of the sub- genus catonotus (porterfield et al. 1999) and is a slender darter reaching up to 78 mm in standard 5 hopper et al.

strange 2001). etheostoma flabellare is typically restricted to shallow riffles and fast flow- ing runs with larger substrates (winn 1958; hlo- howskyj & wissing 1986). this species is widely distributed in north america, ranging from southern quebec to minnesota, south to south carolina, ala- bama and north-eastern oklahoma (braasch & may- den 1985). both reproductive and nonreproductive adults. we sampled tributaries of the neosho-grand river, the illinois river and spavinaw creek. fish were collected using 15- to 20-min inter- vals of backpack electrofishing (lr-24 electrofisher, smith-root, inc., vancouver, wa, usa) within 100- m stream transects. upon collection, specimens were immediately euthanised using ms-222 and fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution. in the laboratory, speci- mens were rinsed in water and stored in 70% iso- propyl 1063 individuals (542 e. spectabile and 521 e. flabellare; see table 1 for details). alcohol. overall, we three major drainages: collected sample collection assessing environmental variation specimens were collected during the months of may and june of 2012 and 2013 at thirty different sites in the ozark highlands of north-eastern oklahoma (fig. 1c, table 1). collections were made towards the end of the reproductive season of both species; hence, samples from each of the sites likely included physical environmental characteristics were evaluated at each sampling location based on a protocol for high gradient streams (barbour et al. 1999). we focused predominantly on quantifying physical habitat characteristics related to habitat size, flow and sub- strates (carlson & wainwright 2010). stream size 6 table 1. list of collection sites with latitude and longitude based on gps coordinates. sites are grouped by river drainages. for each site, the numbers of etheostoma spectabile and etheostoma flabellare collected are also listed. body shape variation in darters name/location illinois river drainage ballard creek baron fork at camp egan caney creek evansville creek peacheater creek @ 4700 peavine creek sager creek shellbranch creek tributary of illinois near chance road tributary to flint creek tributary of illinois north of chewey tyner creek neosho-grand river drainage brush creek buffalo creek clear creek five mile creek flint branch little saline creek lost creek mustang creek spring creek #2 spring creek at rocky ford state park sycamore creek warren branch whitewater creek spavinaw creek drainage beaty creek #2 beaty creek at 456 bridge cloud creek spavinaw creek tail waters of spavinaw lake latitude longitude males females males females e. spectabile e. flabellare 36.09138 35.95843 35.83789 35.87596 35.98862 35.89667 36.20124 35.95813 36.12270 36.18657 36.10606 35.99514 36.77839 36.63608 36.02794 36.98299 36.88017 36.28513 36.84374 36.52480 36.13083 36.14394 36.80793 36.90317 36.53923 36.36610 36.35522 36.30595 36.33155 36.38228  94.58956  94.81205  94.65479  94.57000  94.65512  94.62730  94.60518  94.57475  94.64512  94.70946  94.76579  94.75010  94.65563  94.62994  95.17210  94.69307  94.72110  95.08994  94.65531  95.08723  95.18826  94.90664  94.64468  94.70763  94.75930  94.72894  94.77576  94.74545  94.62527  95.05000 15 26 15 35 15 10 14 10 7 19 4 4 8 14 4 15 26 9 15 7 5 7 12 13 2 4 16 10 14 14 11 6 10 12 3 5 9 1 5 12 4 6 3 8 15 10 10 2 12 7 9 4 9 11 9 20 12 20 9 12 11 15 17 16 10 10 11 15 13 15 14 13 4 13 10 23 16 14 12 12 16 8 21 8 11 8 12 24 13 18 10 10 5 was characterised by measuring maximum width and depth at each sampling location. substrate composi- tion was classified into six categories based on parti- cle size (bedrock: solid bedrock; boulder: >256 mm; cobble: 64–256 mm; gravel: 2–64 mm; sand: 0.06– 2 mm; silt: 0.004–0.06 mm) and was estimated visu- ally as per cent coverage along each sampling tran- sect. finally, two hydrological variables (slope and flow accumulation) were obtained from the usgs hydro1k database (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/hydro1k) based on the latitude and longitude of the collection locations. stream slope quantifies the maximum change in elevation between the grid squares includ- ing the sample site and the eight neighbouring grids. flow accumulation describes the number of cells that flow into each down-slope cell and translates into upstream drainage area in square kilometres, so that sites with higher values accumulate more flow and are typically more channelised. prior to analyses, habitat size and hydrological variables were log-transformed, and substrate compo- component sition variables were arcsine-square-root-transformed. we performed a principal analyses (pca) on each group of variables (i.e. hydrological, habitat size and substrates), such that axes con- structed based on environmental variables could be correlated with morphological variation. in summary, hydrological pc scores described an environmental gradient from streams with a high slope and a high flow accumulation to streams with a low slope and low flow accumulation, and stream size pc scores described a gradient from wide and deep streams to narrow and shallow streams (table 2). pca on sub- strate composition yielded two axes of variation (table 2). the first axis invariably described a sub- strate gradient from smaller particle sizes (silt, sand and gravel) dominating to larger particle sizes (cobble, boulder and bedrock) dominating. the sec- ond axis described a gradient from extreme particle sizes dominating (sand, silt, bedrock and boulder) to intermediate particle sizes (gravel and cobble) dominating. 7 hopper et al. table 2. results of principal component analyses on environmental data from sites with etheostoma spectabile, etheostoma flabellare and both species. provided are component loadings, eigenvalues and per cent variance explained for each of the axes. e. spectabile e. flabellare combined pc 1 pc 2 pc 1 pc 2 pc 1 pc 2 hydrological pc slope flow accumulation eigenvalue % variance stream size pc stream width stream depth eigenvalue % variance substrates pc1 and pc2 bedrock and boulder cobble gravel sand and silt eigenvalue % variance 0.747 0.747 1.117 55.8 0.829 0.829 1.375 68.8  0.545  0.649 0.833 0.518 1.680 42.0 assessing phenotypic variation 0.741  0.668  0.408 0.600 1.523 38.1 for geometric morphometric analysis, lateral pho- tographs of the preserved specimens (stored in iso- propyl alcohol) were taken using a canon eos 400d digital camera canon usa inc., lake success, ny, usa mounted on a copy stand. we digitised 16 mor- phological landmarks (fig. 1a,b) using the software program tpsdig (rohlf 2004). landmarks included (i) the tip of the upper jaw; (ii) the centre of the eye; (iii) the posterior head region (nape); (iv) the anterior and (v) posterior insertions of the first, spiny dorsal fin; (vi) the anterior and (vii) the posterior insertions of the second, soft dorsal fin;

see table 2) from each site were used to calculate pairwise environmental dis- tances, as for the phenotypic data. finally, the geo- graphic distance matrix was obtained through arcgis (version 10.0, environmental systems research institute, redlands, ca, usa) using the origin–destination cost matrix analysis implemented in the network analyst extension. we used a gis- based streams layer obtained from the oklahoma water resources board (http://www.owrb.ok.gov/ maps/data/owrbdata.php) to create a network data set that allowed us to measure stream distance (instead of straight line distance) between all pairwise sam- pling points. geographic distances were log-trans- formed. the partial mantel test approach allowed for disentangling the potential roles environmental simi- larity and geographic distance play in shaping mor- phological variation. geographic distance might be a key explanatory variable, because more proximate sites could be more similar in environmental condi- tions and share more gene flow, which would coun- teract phenotypic differentiation. while correlating distance matrices allows for the consideration of environmental similarity and geo- graphic distances simultaneously, this approach has the disadvantage that specific environmental factors correlating with morphological variation cannot be identified. hence, we also determined the relationship between environmental variables and body shape through a two-block partial least-squares analysis (pls) (rohlf & corti 2000; bookstein et al. 2003). pls reduces data dimensionality by creating new lin- ear combinations of the dependent and independent variables, and singular axes are generated to max- imise the covariation between two sets of variables (i.e. morphological and environmental). we per- formed a pls as implemented in the program tpspls (rohlf & corti 2000). population-specific estimated body shape variation in darters means of aligned landmark coordinates (corrected for sex and centroid size with mancova models as described above) were used as dependent variables. the pc scores summarising environmental variation for each site were used as independent variables. a null distribution for establishing the significance of the correlation coefficients was determined by per- forming 10,000 random permutations of the morpho- logical and we compared the actual correlation between morphology and environment to this null distribution to obtain p- values. environmental variables, and analytical approaches: convergent geographic variation to uncover potential convergent patterns of body shape variation between e. spectabile and e. flabel- lare, we realigned coordinates of individuals col- lected from sites with both species (n = 721) and calculated relative warp scores. relative warp scores were subjected to mancova with ‘sex’, ‘species’ and ‘site’ as independent variables. centroid size was included as a covariate to control for allometry. we calculated individual divergence scores based on site divergence vectors for visualisation of shape variation as for analyses described above. these scores repre- sent shared (i.e. convergent) site-specific phenotypic variation between species across sites. we tested for correlations between shared morphological variation and same approaches outlined above. environmental variables using the results geographic variation in etheostoma spectabile analysing body shape variation across e. spectabile populations using mancova indicated significant effects of size, sex, site, as well as the interaction between sex and site (table 3a). sex, centroid size and site explained the bulk of variation in our data set. the nature of sexual dimorphism in body shape is visu- alised in fig. 2. the nature of shape variation among sites is illustrated along the first two site-specific diver- gence axes of shape variation using thin-plate spline transformation grids (fig. 3). along the first axis of shape variation, e. spectabile populations varied par- ticularly in body height and the size of the caudal peduncle. along the second axis, they varied in terms of head position and the degree of dorsal arching. a mantel test correlating phenotypic similarity among all pairwise population comparisons with environmental similarity and geographic distance explained 11% of variation in body shape. pheno- typic similarity was significantly and positively corre- lated with environmental sites similarity across 9 hopper et al. table 3. results of multivariate analyses of covariance examining body shape variation in etheostoma spectabile (a), etheostoma flabellare (b) and both species combined (c). effect (a) e. spectabile centroid size sex site sex 9 site (b) e. flabellare centroid size sex site sex 9 site (c) combined analysis centroid size sex species site sex 9 species sex 9 site species 9 site sex 9 species 9 site f hypothesis d.f. error d.f. p 15.872 8.349 2.590 1.223 11.285 16.074 3.675 1.382 13.773 11.094 303.503 2.960 8.498 1.231 1.914 1.323 28.0 28.0 728.0 700.0 28.0 28.0 532.0 532.0 28.0 28.0 28.0 448.0 28.0 448.0 448.0 420.0 450.0 450.0 8712.0 8524.7 459.0 459.0 7313.8 7313.8 626.0 626.0 626.0 8779.7 626.0 8779.7 8779.7 8353.7 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 0.001 <0.001 <0.001 g2 p 0.497 0.342 0.134 0.069 0.408 0.495 0.178 0.076 0.381 0.332 0.931 0.115 0.275 0.052 0.078 0.055 relative variance 1.00 0.69 0.27 0.14 0.82 1.00 0.36 0.15 0.41 0.36 1.00 0.12 0.30 0.06 0.08 0.06 effects with a relative variance >0.3 are highlighted in bold. fig. 2. visualisation of shape variation between sexes for etheostoma spectabile and etheostoma flabellare (based on the separate analyses for each species), and between the two species (based on the combined analysis).

geographic variation in etheostoma flabellare mancova of shape variation in e. flabellare indicated significant effects of size, sex, site, as well as the interaction between sex and site (table 3b). variation in body shape was largely explained by sex and size, and to a lesser extent explained by site (table 3b). the nature of sexual dimorphism is visualised in fig. 2, and shape variation across sites is visualised in fig. 5. along the first axis of shape variation, e. flabellare populations particularly varied in body height and the shape of the caudal peduncle. along the second axis, they varied in terms of head position and the degree of body arching. a partial mantel test correlating phenotypic simi- larity among e. flabellare populations with environ- mental similarity and geographic distance explained 10% of variation. both environmental similarity (r = 0.273, p < 0.001) and geographic distance (r = 0.148, p = 0.034) explained similarity in body shape. pls analysis of e. flabellare yielded four dimensions of covariation between the environmental and body shape variables, of which only the first pair of singular axes exhibited significantly more covariation than expected by chance (p = 0.02). this dimension accounted for 53% of the covaria- tion between the two blocks (table 4b), and the correlation between the two variable blocks was 0.85 (p = 0.02). as for

latent body shape vectors. histograms depict the correlation of environmental variables with the corresponding body shape. variation in e. flabellare particularly varied along a gradient of substrate composition (table 4b). body shapes associated with positive values (larger streams with larger and more homogenous substrates) are pri- marily characterised by a posterior shift in the dorsal fin insertions and the dimensions of the caudal peduncle (fig. 6). patterns of convergence analysing body shape variation with both species combined revealed a significant and strong effect of species, explaining the bulk of shape variation (fig. 2). in addition, size and sex, as well as all inter- action terms had significant effects (table 3c). most importantly, though, we detected a small but signifi- cant effect of the factor ‘site’, representing conver- gent body shape variation between the two species across different collection locations. assessment of thin-plate spline transformation grids indicated that the convergent aspect of body shape particularly per- tained to body height, the proportions of the caudal 12 peduncle and the degree of arching of the body (fig. 7). the pls revealed no significant correlations between convergent aspects of body shape and envi- ronmental variables (table 4c). discussion our study uncovered geographic variation in body shape of two species of darters across stream sites in oklahoma’s ozark highlands. body shape variation across sites was correlated with environmental vari- ables in both species, and we documented both shared (convergent) and unique (non-convergent) patterns of shape differences wherever they occurred sympatri- cally. overall, our study highlights geographic varia- tion in phenotypes in response to subtle and gradual, but complex environmental gradients within a rela- tively small spatial scale. the mechanisms underlying geographic variation in body shape remain unclear. phenotypic differences could be entirely due to pheno- typic plasticity, as the presence of predators and varia- tion in flow regimes can affect developmental body shape variation in darters fig. 5. phenotypic variation in

janhunen et al. 2009; langerhans 2009; palacios et al. 2013). hence, addi- tional studies exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of darter body shape variation are highly warranted. 13 hopper et al.

functional consequences based on theoretical and empirical studies of fish body shapes (domenici & kapoor 2009). variation in body height and caudal peduncle proportions has been associated with trade- offs between steady and unsteady swimming (dome- nici 2003; langerhans 2009). narrow, tapered caudal peduncles and increased anterior portions of the body minimise drag and maximise thrust during steady swimming, while high bodies and wide caudal regions increase stability during rapid turns and max- imise velocity and acceleration during fast-starts (langerhans 2008). the functional consequences of variation in head position and body arching are less well studied, but population differences in these traits were strikingly similar to behavioural responses of e. flabellare and etheostoma tetrazonum exposed to varying flow conditions (carlson & lauder 2011). individuals exposed to low flows held their head slightly upward or parallel with the substrate, and the dorsal line remained relatively straight. as flow increased, they lowered their heads and their bodies became arched dorsally (carlson & lauder 2011). overall, the morphological responses detected in both species are congruent with studies documenting body shape variation in response to differential flow regimes, and the nature of body shape variation docu- mented here insinuates that flow regimes likely play an essential role in influencing body shape across darter populations. substrate composition likely serves as an indicator of local flow conditions, and the presence of different substrates sizes may also directly modulate darter body shape, as particle size likely determines the availability of low flow micro- habitats where darters can effectively hold their posi- tion in swift waters (carlson & lauder 2011). even though we uncovered trait–environment cor- relations in both species examined, our analyses also indicated that a majority of variation in body shape body shape variation among populations of both e. spectabile and e. flabellare was correlated with local environmental conditions. in contrast, geo- graphic distance among populations explained simi- larity in body shape only in e. flabellare. this could be indicative of higher population connectivity in e. flabellare, even though movement studies indi- cated high site fidelity and low dispersal potential (ingersoll et al. 1984). estimates of gene flow and potential population genetic structuring would facili- tate uncovering potential relationships between popu- lation connectivity and phenotypic divergence in the future. in general, the relatively strong correlations between phenotypic and environmental similarity (compared to geographic distance) indicate that shared features among populations are likely due to parallel evolution in response to similar environmen- tal factors rather than gene flow among proximate populations. overall, populations of e. spectabile and e. flabel- lare particularly varied in the proportions of the cau- dal peduncle, body height, the shape and position of the head, as well as the degree of arching of the body (see figs 3 and 5). however, only a subset of that variation was actually explained by environmental variables. partial least-squares analyses indicated that body shape in both species was primarily related to substrate composition, which is not unexpected con- sidering that darters are benthic fishes inhabiting lotic environments (carlson & wainwright 2010; carlson & lauder 2011). along a substrate gradient from smaller to larger particle sizes, e. spectabile popula- tions changed in body height, head size and position, as well as the shape of the caudal peduncle (fig. 4). in contrast, populations of e. flabellare mostly varied in the position and length of the dorsal fins, as well as the depth of the caudle peduncle (fig. 6). many of these morphological differences have clearly estab- 14 remained unexplained, such that other factors likely influence geographic variation documented here. unexplained shape variation could be attributed to differences in the reproductive state or body condi- tion among sites (wesner et al. 2011). darters also diversified in trophic resource use (carlson & wain- wright 2010), and character displacement in response to the presence of congeners has been documented in various clades (knouft 2003; carlson 2008; carlson et al. 2009). hence, variation in resource availability and darter communities across sites may affect eco- morphological traits in e. spectabile and e. flabel- lare, and future studies need to address how resource competition and niche space occupation may influ- ence phenotypic evolution. furthermore, shape varia- tion could also be affected by sexual selection. male darters are known to exhibit strong territorial beha- viour during breeding season, and there is evidence of intra- and interspecific competition for breeding sites (ingersoll et al. 1984). in addition, there is inter- sexual selection in many darter species (e.g. williams & mendelson 2011), and female e. flabellare show mating preferences for males exhibiting egg-mimick- ing knobs on the dorsal fin (knapp & sargent 1989). variation in environmental characteristics among sites could modulate the intensity of sexual selection, ultimately precipitating in population differences in body shape. but considering characteristics, along with significant geographic variation, our data indicated that there is a small signal of conver- gent evolution in e. spectabile and e. flabellare from the same locality. shared aspects of body shape include body height, proportions of the caudal pedun- cle, as well as the shape and angle of the head (fig. 7). however, convergent aspects of body shape variation were not correlated with any of the environ- mental variables included in this study. these results support the idea that shared environmental conditions can cause two species to converge towards similar phenotypic that e. spectabile and e. flabellare body shapes varied differently along the gradient of substrate composi- tion, nonconvergent responses to shared sources of selection seem to be prevailing in this system. the balance between convergent and nonconvergent evo- lutionary responses to shared sources of selection can be shaped by a variety of factors (kaeuffer et al. 2012). for example, nonconvergent responses may be caused by the effects of genetic drift (de brito et al. 2005), or by differences in genetic variation and genomic architecture between species that favour alternative evolutionary trajectories (schluter 1996). in addition, nonconvergent responses may be caused by hidden ecological variation, and even though we analysed both species from the same sites, the two species may actually be exposed to different sources body shape variation in darters of selection. although we found significant correla- tions between darter body shape and environmental variables that were assessed at the stream reach scale, natural selection likely operates at the microhabitat scale to shape body shape evolution. different micro- habitat use and adaptation to those microhabitats may in part explain the nonconvergent changes in body shape along the gradient of substrate composition as well as the large proportion of unexplained body shape variation within each of the species. hence, future studies linking environmental variation and body shape variation in benthic stream fishes should consider quantifying environmental the microhabitat scale to better understand the selective forces shaping trait variation in different species. factors at overall, our results are consistent with the growing body of literature documenting variation in fish body shape in response to abiotic and biotic environmental factors (e.g. hendry et al. 2006; tobler & carson 2010; fluker et al. 2011). to date, most studies on evolutionary responses to selection have focused on dichotomous environmental parameters, when in real- ity selective forces are often multifarious. this study highlights that even subtle and continuous environ- mental variation can elicit organismal responses in the expression of phenotypes (also see schaefer et al. 2011; haas et al. 2015). future studies should com- bine field assays of morphological and environmental variation with population genetic analyses and labora- tory experiments in a broad collection of species to uncover generalities about organismal responses to stream and river gradients.
