(2003) found experimental evidence sug- gesting that non-native salmonids have negative impacts on atlantic salmon, impacts that could affect reintroduction of this species to lake ontario. for example, during spawning, atlantic salmon were more active, spawned later and had higher postspawning mortality when chinook salmon were present in experimental enclosures compared with when they were absent (scott et al. 2003). in the present study, we released hatchery-reared adult atlantic salmon into a lake ontario tributary that is known to have spawning populations of exotic salmonids. our objec- tive was to determine the frequency and impact of the interactions observed in scott et al. (2003) in a free ranging population. methods we obtained 48 female (mean length ¼ 60.7 cm; sd ¼ 3.92) and 17 male (mean length ¼ 54.3 cm; sd ¼ 9.49) atlantic salmon from the ontario minis- try of natural resources fish culture operations (normandale, ontario, canada). all ﬁsh were marked with a 95 mm long · 1.5 mm diameter orange tag that was visible to observers on the stream bank. we released the ﬁsh on 25 october 2000 at three locations within a 1.5 km section of wilmot creek (located c. 75 km east of toronto, ontario, canada) 6.5 km upstream from the mouth at lake ontario (44°02¢30¢¢ latitude, 78°36¢56¢¢ longitude). this section of stream has a mean (sd) width of 6.32 m (1.32) and depth of 36.6 cm (18.6) making all spawning areas highly visible to observers on the stream bank. we conducted walking surveys of the 1.5 km stream section at 2 to 4-day intervals beginning on 28 october 2000. during the surveys, we recorded the location of newly constructed nests (depressions constructed in the stream bottom by females) by attaching ﬂagging tape to vegetation on the stream bank. we returned to all new nests (those with adult salmon present in them) at the end of each survey to determine visually which species was using it. chinook salmon, coho salmon and brown_trout also nest in this section of wilmot creek at about the same time as atlantic salmon and the species are easily distinguishable based on size, shape and colouration. we also made 20-min continu- ous observations of nesting atlantic salmon, recording all interactions with all other non-native salmon present. in particular, we focused on aggressive interactions (chasing, biting, ﬁghting) that interfered with atlantic salmon spawning, behaviours that scott et al. (2003) found impacted adult atlantic salmon activity, spawning time and postspawning mortality. we conducted our surveys and observations until all evidence of nesting activity (females observed con- structing nests or consorting with males during a survey) by atlantic salmon had ceased. fish in this study were not individually marked, so it is possible that individual behavioural observations do not repre- sent different individuals. results and discussion we identiﬁed a total of 74 atlantic salmon nests over the duration our survey. females initiated nest con- struction on 5 november 2000 and we found no evidence of new nest construction later than 8 december 2000 (fig. 1). spawning activity (number of females actively constructing redds or consorting with a male salmon) was highest on 14 november and we also observed a second smaller peak in activity on 29 november 2000. we conducted 20-min continuous observation bouts on 43 female atlantic salmon (860 min of observation time), which accounted for c. 4.4% of daylight hours during the total breeding period on wilmot creek (assuming an average of 9.5 h of daylight per day over the 34 survey days). fig. 1. number of new atlantic salmon nests observed during each survey of our 1500 m study section of wilmot creek, ontario. 403 scott et al. we observed three other species of fall-spawning salmonids in the surveyed stream section: chinook salmon, coho salmon and brown_trout. the other species present were observed to interact with nesting atlantic salmon during 23% (10 of 43) of our observation bouts. chinook salmon spawning activity had peaked prior to release of the atlantic salmon into the stream, but several spawning pairs and some unpaired males (sex identiﬁed by observing males perform stereotypical courtship behaviours) were present in the surveyed stream section. although chinook salmon spawning in wilmott creek tend to be larger than the atlantic salmon used in this study (scott et al. 2003), the male chinook salmon that we observed appeared to be similar in size to the atlantic salmon. chinook salmon accounted for seven of the 10 observation bouts in which exotics interacted with spawning atlantic salmon. of those, six involved courtship of a female atlantic salmon by a male chinook salmon. in addition to courting, the male chinook repeatedly chased away other atlantic salmon that came close to the female. during the remaining (seventh) observation bout, a male chinook salmon behaved aggressively towards several nearby atlantic salmon while a female atlantic salmon was constructing a nest. however, we did not observe courtship during this bout. in all seven bouts, a male chinook salmon was aggressive towards atlantic salmon that approached nesting female atlantic salmon. one male brown_trout was also observed to court an atlantic salmon female, and one male coho salmon was observed to chase an atlantic salmon female from her redd. courtship of atlantic salmon females by exotic salmonids could have several consequences for the atlantic salmon reintro- duction programme. for example, spawning could be delayed or prevented altogether or result in hybridi- sation. in the present study, the predominant form of exotic impact was interspeciﬁc mate guarding and courtship whereas in the previous study on this system (scott et al. 2003) the predominant effect was disruption of atlantic salmon spatial/social structure. the difference between the results of the two studies is likely a result of using pairs of chinook salmon in the enclosure study of scott et al. (2003). in the present study there were very few breeding pairs of chinook salmon left when the atlantic salmon were released into the wilmot creek site. there were several unpaired precocial males present that were highly motivated to spawn. instead, impact of the results of this study provide evidence of the potential introduced salmonids on the reintroduction of atlantic salmon to lake ontario speciﬁcally and on the potentially devastating effect that these non-native species could have on declining 404 and threatened native populations of atlantic salmon on the east coast of north america. given that there are no physical barriers to invasion of east coast atlantic salmon rivers by chinook salmon (hickey 2002), this study is a warning of potential negative impacts in extant wild atlantic salmon populations. resumen 1. salmo_salar es nativo del lago ontario (canada). su nu´ mero decayo´ ra´pidamente despue´s de la colonizacio´ n de los europeos hasta su extirpacio´n en 1896. las agencias gubernamentales que rodean al lago ontario han desarrollado numerosos estudios para evaluar la posibilidad de re-introducirlo. 2. con adultos de s. salar criados en granja repoblamos un aﬂuente del lago ontario para examinar interacciones repro- ductivas entre esta especie y otros salmo´nidos exo´ticos de reproduccio´n oton˜al previamente introducidos en este rı´o durante los an˜os 60. observamos interacciones con la puesta de s. salar por parte de oncorhynchus_tshawytscha, o. kisutch y salmo_trutta al menos en un cuarto del total de observaciones con o. tshawytscha interaccionando ma´s frecuentemente. 3. mientras que una investigacio´n anterior encontro´ que o. tshawytscha causa una mayor actividad general y compor- tamiento agonı´stico en s. salar, este estudio encontro´ que el cortejo inter-especı´ﬁco fue la forma ma´s comu´ n de interaccio´n exo´ tica durante la puesta de s. salar. en particular, observamos que machos precoces de o. tshawytscha cortejaban con hembras de s. salar y defendı´an a las hembras contra aproximaciones de machos de s. salar. 4. discutimos las implicaciones de estas interacciones en el contexto del programa de re-introduccio´ n de s. salar en el lago notario. acknowledgements the authors wish to thank landowners, r. jaeger and w. kerr for access to orono creek, the large number of volunteers who
