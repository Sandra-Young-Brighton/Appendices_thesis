phenotype; morphotypes; geometric morphometrics; species at risk introduction the ciscoes (salmoniformes: coregonidae) have radi- ated into complexes of closely related species, life- history types and ecological variants throughout their holarctic distribution (mcphail & lindsey 1970; sv€ardson 1979; bernatchez 2004; hudson et al. 2007). weak genetic differentiation, incomplete reproductive isolation and strong plastic responses to environmental gradients make taxonomic classifica- tion of coregonines challenging. although the evolu- tionary history of the north american ciscoes has been studied (bernatchez et al. 1991; turgeon et al. 1999; turgeon & bernatchez 2001a,b, 2003; turgeon 2002), the phenotypic and life-history divergence of sympatric ciscoes in of north american lakes is less well known. similar challenges with resolving coreg- onine taxonomy and evolutionary history occur in europe (kahilainen et al. 2005, 2007; ohlberger et al. 2008; helland et al. 2009) and asia (politov et al. 2004; sukhanova et al. 2012). a further complication to resolving cisco taxon- omy is that commercial exploitation, local extirpation (phillips & ehlinger 1995), and hybridisation and correspondence: andrew muir, great lakes fishery commission, 2100 commonwealth blvd., suite 100, ann arbor, michigan 48105, usa. e-mail: amuir@glfc.org this is an open access article under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-noderivs license, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. doi: 10.1111/eff.12098 453 muir et al. introgression (todd & stedman 1989; todd & smith 1992) have acted to reduce diversity in this group of fishes. with the exception of great bear and great slave lakes in the northwest territories, canada, cisco diversity has been altered or supplemented and even replaced by non-native planktivores elsewhere, such as the lower laurentian great lakes (i.e., lakes erie and ontario). great slave lake (61°47′n; 113°43′w; fig. 1) contains an intact assemblage of postglacial fishes, including ciscoes, and offers the opportunity to study this diversity in a relatively unperturbed ecosystem. in this sense, great slave lake serves as a model to understand the historical postglacial food web structure in the laurentian great lakes and may provide insights and expectations to help guide restoration efforts in such systems (zimm- erman & krueger 2009). our ultimate goal is to understand patterns of cisco diversity within and among north american large lakes and the biotic and abiotic processes shaping that diversity. a first step towards that goal is to describe the patterns of cisco diversity in great slave lake (fig. 1). a preliminary survey (vecsei et al. 2012) identified five putative ciscoes including (1) a large morph of coregonus_artedi with a lacustrine life history, (2) a ‘dwarf’ morph of c. artedi with a lacustrine life history, (3) a ‘dwarf’ morph of c. arte- di with an adfluvial life history, (4) coregonus zeni- thicus and (5) coregonus_sardinella. the two lacustrine c. artedi (groups 1 and 2 above) were shown to be synonymous; young lacustrine c. artedi underwent ontogenetic shifts in gillraker and body morphology and habitat use as they aged and grew (muir et al. 2013). this analysis reduced the number of putative morphs and species to four. the lacustrine c. artedi group was subsequently subdivided into the typical lacustrine c. artedi and a deepwater variant – the big-eye cisco (muir et al. 2011), bringing the number of morphs or species to five. strong pheno- typic variation between the lacustrine and adfluvial c. artedi morphs was shown to reflect adaptations to their contrasting life histories and habitats (blackie et al. 2012). identification of c. sardinella in great slave lake by vecsei et al. (2012) was recently confirmed using amplified frag- ment length polymorphisms (aflp; j. turgeon, uni- versite laval, unpublished data). on the basis of these previous studies, five cisco forms were thought to occur in great slave lake including the following: three nominate species (i.e., c. artedi, c. sardinella and c. zenithicus) and within c. artedi, three morphs (i.e., typical lacustrine c. artedi, adfluvial c. artedi and the deepwater big-eye cisco variant). in addition, the the purpose of this study is to provide an updated and more complete description of great slave lake ciscoes and their life history. our specific objectives fig. 1. cisco sampling locations and sample sizes (n) in yellowknife bay and the east arm, great slave lake, nt. 454 (2) were to compare the following among all five cisco species and morphs: (1) gross body morphology and phenotypic traits, life-history dynamics and (3) physical resource use. finally, objective (4) was to assess the validity of the species and morphs within the context of the most recent taxonomy (scott & cross- man 1973). achieving these objectives will facilitate follow-on comparative studies among perturbed and unperturbed lakes to test predictions about the processes generating and maintaining ecological diversity and studies of the functional diversity among cisco morphs. methods study site four lacustrine sites and one riverine site in yellow- knife bay and two lacustrine sites and one riverine site in the east arm of great slave lake (61°n, 113°w) were sampled between 2008 and 2009 (fig. 1; table 1). sites were sampled between 1 and 5 times over the 2-year period in an attempt to span the range of available cisco habitat (i.e., 0–29 m, 30– 59 m, 60–89 m and >90 m). fish collections fish were sampled during autumn because adfluvial cisco can be accessed during september when it moves into the rivers prior to spawning, and the other morphs are distributed throughout that time. the lake’s inclement climate and remote loca- tion also limited our ability to sample during other the lake at cisco diversity in great slave lake, nt, canada times of the year. on the basis of a visual examina- tion of the gonads, 70% of fish sampled were mature, but had not yet spawned; therefore, state of maturity did not likely influence the morphological analyses. fish were caught in the lake using <24 h, bottom set, multimesh gillnets. nets were 200 m long 9 1.8 m deep and composed of eight 25-m panels of 12.7-, 25.4-, 38.1-, 50.8-, 63.5-, 76.2-, 88.9- and 101.6-mm stretch mesh (i.e., 6.4-, 12.7-, 19.1-, 25.4-, 31.8-, 38.1-, 44.5-, 50.8-mm bar length). fish were caught in the two rivers using a dipnet. morphs were visu- ally identified in the field using characteristics given by muir et al. (2011), and these groups were used in subsequent statistical analyses. statistical methods (significance level was statistical analyses set at a = 0.05) were conducted using r (2.15.1; r core team 2012), sigmaplot 11 (systat software inc., san jose, ca, usa), the thin-plate spline software suite (tps; state university of new york at stony brook; http://life. bio.sunysb.edu/morp) and mclust v.3 implemented in r (university of washington; http://cran.r-project. org/web/packages/mclust/index.html). nonparamet- ric tests were used when data could not be transformed to meet the assumptions of parametric methods. morphology gross body shape of each individual was quantified using geometric morphometric methods (bookstein 1989; rohlf & bookstein 2003; zelditch et al. 2004). table 1. location, data (mm/dd/yyyy), depth stratum sampled (m), latitude and longitude (degrees° minutes′ and seconds″), and numbers (n) of cisco collected from great slave lake, northwest territories. site basin date depth stratum latitude (n) longitude (w) mackenzie channel tartan rapids sub islands north sub islands south negus point beaulieu river christie bay red cliff bluffs outer east arm yellowknife bay east arm 8/24/2009 9/27/2008 10/1/2008 10/4/2008 10/4/2008 10/17/2008 10/4/2008 10/9/2008 8/24/2009 9/25/2009 10/17/2008 10/18/2008 10/14/2008 10/16/2008 10/16/2008 10/16/2008 10/17/2008 10/17/2008 10/15/2008 10/15/2008 10/14/2008 0–29 0–29 0–29 30–59 30–59 30–59 30–59 30–59 30–59 30–59 0–29 0–29 0–29 30–59 60–89 >90 60–89 30–59 30–59 >90 >90 62°20′629″ 62°33′530″ 62°33′530″ 62°21′961″ 62°21′961″ 62°21′961″ 62°21′419″ 62°21′419″ 62°21′419″ 62°21′419″ 62°25′475″ 62°25′475″ 62°20′792″ 62°29′053″ 62°29′053″ 62°29′053″ 62°29′053″ 62°29′053″ 62°21′388″ 62°21′388″ 61°59′448″ 114°19′187″ 114°13′100″ 114°13′100″ 114°21′116″ 114°21′116″ 114°21′116″ 114°21′957″ 114°21′957″ 114°21′957″ 114°21′957″ 114°21′030″ 114°21′030″ 113°11′487″ 111°11′790″ 111°11′790″ 111°11′790″ 111°11′790″ 111°11′790″ 111°40′776″ 111°40′776″ 113°92′881″ n 111 50 100 13 14 31 64 10 50 7 7 24 75 12 11 24 23 26 24 18 0 455 muir et al. a calibrated digital image of the left side of each individual was captured on fresh fish in the field according to muir et al. (2012). sixteen homologous and four semi-sliding landmarks were digitised on images using tps and following muir et al. (2013). briefly, landmark data were used to scale each indi- vidual relative to a consensus form using tpsrelw. the 36 partial warp scores (i.e., size-independent shape) were entered into an ordination, and the first two principal components (pcs) were retained as new shape variates and used in subsequent analyses (see zimmerman et al. 2009). body shape was compared among morphs using a bayesian cluster analysis, which does not require a priori assignments of individuals to groups (i.e., mclust; fraley & raftery 2009). two mclust models (eii and vii, see fraley & raftery 2009 for model descriptions) were fit to the body shape data (i.e., pcs 1–4 from an ordination of partial warps), and the ‘best’ model representing the most likely number of groups was identified using bayesian information criterion (bic). the ‘best’ or maximum-bic model to groups and quantified uncertainty in group mem- bership. alternative candidate models were evaluated by bic differences – the difference for the ith model was calculated as dbici = bici   bicmin, where bicmin was the smallest bic value among all candi- date models (burnham & anderson 2002; posada & buckley 2004). evidence supporting model i was con- individuals assigned sidered strong if dbici >150 (posada & buckley 2004). traditional phenotypic traits were also quantified for each individual fish. twenty-three linear mor- phometric measures (table 2), and nine meristic characteristics (table 3) were quantified on thawed specimens according to koelz (1929), scott (1960) and vuorinen et al. (1993). linear measurements were made on the left side of the fish using a digital (0.01 mm). linear measurements were calliper expressed as thousandths of ls (i.e., [x/ls]*1000, where x is the linear measurement for a variable and ls is the standard length). the first left gill arch was extracted, fixed in 5% formalin and transferred to 95% ethanol prior to gillraker enumeration. linear phenotypic measures were treated in a pro- cess that paralleled the analysis of geometric shape data. due to strong correlations with body size, all linear measures were size-adjusted using common- within-group residuals (reist 1985, 1987). a subset of morphometric characters (i.e., ool, psl, iow, grl and cpl; see tables 2 and 3) that are known to vary among cisco morphs (see data herein as well as data in koelz 1929 and clarke 1973) were selected and used to discriminate cisco morphological groups. the first four pcs from an ordination of the size-corrected, linear phenotypic measures were retained as new variates and used in subsequent anal- yses. scores on the first 2–4 pcs were analysed by mclust according to the methods described above table 2. linear morphometric variables measured on ciscoes from great slave lake, nt; modified from koelz (1929); scott (1960) and vuorinen et al.

smith & todd 1992; todd & smith 1992). a kruskal–wallis one-way analysis on ranks tested for differences in gillraker distribution medians and dunn’s test was used for all pairwise comparisons due to unequal sample sizes. among cisco morphs, life history describing seasonal variation in life history was beyond the scope of this study as sampling was lim- ited to the autumn. fish age was estimated using an otolith crack-and-burn method (muir et al. 2013). a kruskal–wallis one-way analysis on ranks tested for differences in age distribution medians among the five putative cisco groups, and dunn’s test was used for all pairwise comparisons due to unequal sample sizes. growth of cisco morphs was quantified by fitting a series of von bertalanffy models to length-at-age data (ogle 2012). the original model parameterisation was used: e½lsjt ¼ l1   ðl1   l0þe  kt þ e; where the expected standard length (ls) at time (t) is a function of the asymptotic mean length (l∞; theo- retical mean length to which a fish would grow if time permitted), the mean length at time zero (l0;  1; i.e., i.e., hatch) and the growth coefficient (k year  1; gallucci & quinn 1979). instantaneous rate at which ls approaches l∞), plus additive error (e) (von bertalanffy 1938). age-0 and age-1 juveniles were underrepresented in the samples; therefore, l0 was fixed to the measured mean length at hatch (i.e., 10.69 mm) for laboratory-reared lake superior c. artedi (oyadomari & auer 2007). annual growth rate (x) was estimated by l∞*k (mmyear four nested models were fit to length-at-age data to compare growth among morphs: (1) general: sep- arate parameter estimates for each morph; (2) com- mon l∞: constant l∞ among morphs, but varying k; (3) common k: constant k, but varying l∞; and (4) common: for all morphs combined. the ‘best’ model was selected by akaike information criterion (aic) (akaike 1973), and a likelihood ratio (bates & watts 1998) tested the best model against the common model (i.e., one growth curve for all morphs combined). the same parameter estimates annual survival (s) was calculated for the adfluvial and lacustrine c. artedi morphs, and for c. zenithi-  z, where the instantaneous total mortality cus as: e (z) was estimated for each morph by the slope of a linear regression through the descending limb of an otolith-based catch curve (ricker 1975). small sam- ple sizes within many of the older age classes pre- vented the calculation of s for the big-eye cisco and c. sardinella. an f-test for the equality of regression slopes was used to detect differences in s among morphs (zar 1999). physical resource use minimum and maximum water depths (m) for each net set were recorded using an echo sounder. a krus- kal–wallis one-way analysis on ranks tested for dif- ferences in median depth of capture between cisco groups. dunn’s test was used for all pairwise compar- isons. catch per-unit-effort (cpue) was standardised  1 and considered a relative to kg of fish·net 457  124 h muir et al. index of abundance among depth strata. a kruskal– wallis one-way analysis with dunn’s comparisons tested for differences in cpue among morphs within depth strata (0–29; 30–59; 60–89; >90 m). buoyancy was used as one physiological indicator of habitat and prey use. per cent buoyancy accounts for differences in density and relative quantity of soft versus hard tissues that affect the specific gravity of the fish (alexander 1972) and is positively correlated with body lipid content and depth of capture in many fishes (zimmerman et al. 2006). high body lipid con- tent is a more energy-efficient adaptation than the swim bladder for facilitating vertical migration in deepwater fishes (alexander 1972, 1993). many great lakes ciscoes undergo diel vertical migration (dvm) to prey on mysis diluviana (hereafter mysis); high per cent buoyancy is indicative of this behaviour (eshenroder et al. 1998; clemens & stevens 2003). per cent buoyancy (b) was calculated by the follow- ing equation: b ¼ ððwa   wwþ=waþ  100; where wa is weight of fish measured in air and ww is the weight of the fish measured in water. weights were measured (1 g) using a pesola spring scale (jennings 1989). to measure ww, an incision was made on the left side of the fish, just below the lat- eral line, and extending from the anterior to the pos- terior of the gut cavity. the swimbladder was punctured; care was taken not to damage the internal organs. once the fish was suspended in water, the remaining air was forced out of the swimbladder and gut cavity so that it did not bias the measurement. an ancova with standard length (ls) as the covari- ate tested for differences in buoyancy among cisco morphs. this analysis was restricted to fish with a weight in water >2 g due to inaccuracies in measur- ing weights <2 g with spring scales. the interaction term was included to test for homogeneity of slopes. a lack of homogeneity of slopes necessitated a size correction; so, per cent buoyancies were adjusted using a regression technique where residuals from the relationship between per cent buoyancy and ls for each of the five morphological groups were retained as new variates (reist 1985). residual per cent buoy- ancies were compared among groups using a krus- kal–wallis one-way analysis on ranks with dunn’s method of multiple comparisons. results morphology three groups were identified on the basis of geomet- ric body shape (fig. 2; mclust; dbic = 259). 458 four of the five next best models also identified three groups (243 ≤ dbic ≤ 254), indicating strong sup- port for three geometric body shape groups. two of the three groups identified by the model conformed to our field taxonomic assignments as well as groups previously identified by vecsei et al. (2012). one of these groups consisted of 99% of fish identified as adfluvial c. artedi in the field, and the second group consisted of 93% of fish identified as c. sardinella in the field (fig. 2). the third group identified by body shape contained the greatest number of speci- mens and the most variation along both pc1 and pc2. this group contained specimens that were iden- tified in the field as lacustrine c. artedi, big-eye cisco and c. zenithicus. the body shape group struc- ture identified by the model was consistent with our expectation based on field and laboratory observa- tions that adfluvial c. artedi and c. sardinella could easily be identified on the basis of body shape alone. in contrast to the body shape model, four groups were identified on the basis of the selected linear (mclust; dbic = 1.60; phenotypic measures fig. 3). the next best model, which was virtually identical to the first, also identified four groups. all four groups were consistent with groups previously identified by vecsei et al. (2012). groups 1–4 con- sisted of 80%, 65%, 77% and 97% of fish identified in the field as adfluvial c. artedi, c. zenithicus, lacustrine c. artedi and c. sardinella, respectively. the selected linear morphometric measures were insufficient to separate the big-eye c. artedi morph – 97% of big-eye cisco were grouped with the adfluvial c. artedi contrary to our expectation that they would group with lacustrine c. artedi. median gillraker number, a character typically used to differentiate coregonines, differed among the mor- phological groups (h = 133.05; d.f. = 4; p < 0.001; fig. 4). the c. zenithicus group had fewer gillrakers than all other cisco groups (all dunn’s q > 5.05; all p < 0.05). lacustrine c. artedi had more gillrakers (dunn’s q = 3.69; than the adfluvial c. artedi p < 0.05). life history age structure differed among the five putative cisco groups (h = 178.25; d.f. = 4; p < 0.001). adfluvial c. artedi was most divergent among the morphs having a narrow age distribution (range = 2–9 years; median = 4 years). by comparison, the other morphs had broad age distributions and were long-lived: lacus- trine c. artedi (range = 1–33 years; median = 6 years); 7 c. zenithicus years); big-eye cisco (range = 3–20 years; median = 8 years); and c. sardinella (range = 3–26 years; median = 10.5 years). the median age of adfluvial (range = 2–22 years; median = cisco diversity in great slave lake, nt, canada fig. 2. ordination of principal component scores (n = 508) for 36 partial warps defining geometric body shape for coregonine ciscoes in great slave lake, nt. three groups were identified on the basis of size-independent body shape with no a priori group assignments. the dot and line illustrations show the thin-plate spline deformation plots representing the shape variation along the two axes. fig. 3. ordination of principal component scores (n = 616) for size-corrected orbital length, postorbital length, interorbital width, middle gillraker length and caudal peduncle length for ciscoes in great slave lake, nt. four groups were identified on the basis of the linear phe- notypic measures with no a priori group assignments. 459 muir et al.

(b = 92.7; discussion previous efforts to resolve coregonine cisco taxon- omy in great slave lake have been inconclusive due 462 to small sample sizes, limited spatial coverage of investigation, poor condition of preserved collections and a limited scope of analysis (dymond 1943; clarke 1973; murray 2006). taxonomic distinctions were also probably confounded by the considerable variation and plasticity in character traits observed among great slave lake ciscoes. allowed us a multivariate approach to analysing levels of vari- ation in morphology, meristics, age, growth, life his- tory and habitat use, to describe ecological groups of ciscoes that generally reflected existing coregonine taxonomy (scott & crossman 1973). at a minimum, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the great slave lake ciscoes include two strongly differentiated species (c. artedi and c. sardinella) and an adfluvial c. artedi morph that is distinct from its lacustrine conspecific in terms of life history, morphology, age, growth and mortality (see also blackie et al. 2012). coregonus_sardinella has previously been identified from great slave lake less-distinct morphs, (turgeon & bernatchez 2003), but herein, we provide the first comprehensive description of this species in the lake and confirm a significant range extension for the species (mcphail & lindsey 1970). the lacustrine c. artedi differs little from descriptions throughout its range. in addition to these three ciscoes, linear phenotypic traits, gillraker number and morphology, and growth data support the possible occurrence of two other, the big-eye cisco c. artedi and c. zenithicus. although the big-eye morph was not identified by the statistical models, it could be discriminated visually on the basis of differ- ences in linear phenotypic traits, such as orbital length, paired fin lengths, head and gillraker mor- phology (expressed as standard length; see table 5). in addition, the big-eye morph showed different age and growth structure compared with the other lacustrine cisco morphs. the c. zeni- thicus morph was distinguished visually and by the statistical model of linear phenotypic traits as well as by gillraker number and morphology (see table 6), which were within the range for the species across its distribution (scott & crossman 1973). thousandths of adfluvial cisco the adfluvial cisco is strikingly uniform in appear- ance with little variation among individuals. this morph is characterised by its small size (max = 192 mm), young maximum age (9 years), young age at maturity, rapid growth, high mortality, relatively short fins with a yellow hue, long caudal peduncle, relatively short snout and a terminal jaw (muir et al. 2011; blackie et al. 2012). adfluvial life-history types occur in lake baikal, [e.g., coregonus_autumnalis migratorius russia (georgi)], throughout siberia (e.g., coregonus_peled; berg 1948), and are common in scandinavia (e.g., coregonus_albula and coregonus_lavaretus; næsje et al. 1986; sandlund et al. 2012). amphidromous (i.e., travelling between fresh and saltwater for feeding rather throughout arctic canada (morin et al. 1981; bernatchez & dodson 1990), but few adfluvial ciscoes have been described in north america (except see blackie et al. 2012). than breeding) c. artedi occur a large population of c. artedi spawns in the st. marys river, the connecting channel between lakes superior and huron. however, the extent these fish use lake habitat is currently unknown (m.p. ebener, chippewa ottawa resource authority, sault ste. marie, michigan, personal communication, 2011). fielder (2000) reported evidence from the st. marys river of an apparent upriver progression in female cpue by week concurrent with an increase in go- nadosomatic index suggesting that these fish had cisco diversity in great slave lake, nt, canada migrated from the lake for spawning. it is probable that other adfluvial cisco populations occurred histor- ically in the laurentian great lakes (lawrie & rah- rer 1973; christie 1974). accumulations of lumber milling wastes and dredged shipping channels have been implicated in the destruction of c. artedi and coregonus_clupeaformis spawning grounds in many great lakes tributaries (christie 1974), demonstrating the susceptibility of adfluvial ciscoes to habitat dis- turbances. in great slave lake, spawning migrations of adflu- vial cisco are subject to intense subsistence and com- mercial dipnet fisheries in some rivers, including the yellowknife river. the effects of these fisheries on population dynamics are unknown. data presented herein show that mortality is relatively high and sur- vival is only 35%, possibly due to the fishery. in addition, mining operations and hydroelectric devel- opments (e.g., bluefish hydro dam replacement; northwest territories power corporation 2010) have the potential for adverse effects on rivers that support adfluvial cisco populations. the adfluvial cisco is a key horizontal vector of energy transfer between great slave lake, inflowing rivers, and its connecting inland lakes. conserving adfluvial cisco populations is a high priority of fisheries and oceans canada (d. leonard, fisheries and oceans canada, yellowknife, northwest territories, personal commu- nication, 2011). its lacustrine cisco the lacustrine c. artedi of great slave lake is similar in gross morphology, ecology and biology to populations throughout their north american range. the ranges of morphometric and meristic traits for lacustrine c. artedi fell within those reported for the taxon, but were the widest among the great slave lake ciscoes. the literature on c. artedi is extensive and need not be repeated here. for data on the spe- cies, see koelz (1929), dymond & pritchard (1930), pritchard (1931), dymond (1943), mcphail & lindsey (1970), scott & crossman (1973). this spe- cies is an important prey fish and has supported subsistence and commercial fisheries throughout its range. big-eye cisco a body small the big-eye cisco was not discriminated by statistical models, but it was visually distinct and characterised (maximum = 204 mm; by table 6), rapid growth, large eye, long, narrow dorsal fin and darkly pigmented scales (muir et al. 2011). the taxonomic affinity of the big-eye cisco remains uncertain, but it could either be a fast-growing deep- size 463 muir et al. 464 l e b a i r a v . s e s e h t n e r a p n i n e v g i e r a a t a d w a r ;

c. artedi, or alterna- tively, a commonly occurring hybrid. turgeon (2000) reported that ciscoes from great slave lake with 40–46 gillrakers had mtdna and nuclear alleles characteristic of c. sardinella, whereas those that had 49–59 gillrakers had mtdna and nuclear alleles characteristic of c. artedi. two of 63 (i.e., 3%) indi- viduals with low gillraker numbers (41 and 46) pos- sessed nuclear alleles unique to both c. artedi and c. sardinella at three loci providing evidence of hybrids between these species (turgeon 2000). if big-eye is indeed a hybrid, it is not rare because it represented about 5% of our sample. least cisco size coregonus_sardinella in great slave lake attain a (maximum = 298-mm stl and moderate 255 g) and can be easily identified by its appear- ance. this species is characterised by a relatively large orbit (but not as big as the big-eye), which often extends beyond the dorsal body margin, nar- low premaxillary angle, row interorbital width, superior mouth orientation, extended lower jaw, long pelvic and dorsal fins, but short dorsal base, >12 anal fin rays (all other ciscoes had <12 anal rays), a long anal fin base, and heavy black pig- mentation, especially on the ventral fins (muir et al. 2011). coregonus_sardinella was also captured in greater numbers in shallower water than the other morphs. uncertainties about the occurrence of c. sardinella in great slave lake date to the early descriptions of north-western coregonines. bean (1889) described a new species coregonus pusillus from alaska and the mackenzie river delta. berg (1932), however, described siberian c. sardinella as nearly identical to c. pusillus, and both dymond (1943) and berg (1948) considered the two species synonymous. the c. pusillus type (usnm 38366) had 88 lateral-line scales, 49 gillrakers and 14 rays in the anal fin. the number of gillrakers on the c. pusillus type exceeded the upper range of the great slave lake c. sardinella specimens (table 6), although anadromous corego- nines typically have more gillrakers than their fresh- water counterparts (scott & crossman 1973). the high number of anal rays in c. pusillus was consis- tent with our finding that c. sardinella never had <12 rays, whereas the other morphs had as few as nine rays (minimum), and the anal fin base length (anl) greatly exceeded that of the other great slave lake ciscoes. the fins of c. pusillus were also reported as dark, especially towards the distal ends, and the ventral fins were quite black. this fin pig- mentation pattern is a key characteristic of c. sardi- nella in great slave lake (muir et al. 2011) and distinctly separated it from all other ciscoes in the lake, which have weakly pigmented or immaculate fins. in general, the morphometric data given for c. pusillus by dymond (1943) are consistent with those for c. sardinella from great slave lake (cur- rent study and murray 2006). moreover, genetic data previously showed c. sardinella dna in great slave lake (turgeon & bernatchez 2003), and recent anal- yses confirm that the specimens described herein belong to c. sardinella (aflp; j. turgeon, univer- site laval, unpublished data). the siberian c. sardinella are typically fluvial, inhabiting rivers, but some populations are amphidr- omous and concentrate in the freshened portions of the sea for feeding (berg 1948). migratory and non- migratory c. sardinella occur across northern north america with amphidromous river- and lake-spawn- ing life-history types (mcphail & lindsey 1970; brown et al. 2007). the north american amphidr- omous form has a gillraker range of 48–53, whereas the freshwater form ranges from 41 to 47 (scott & crossman 1973), consistent with the range for the specimens in the current study (41–46). although we did not confirm lacustrine spawning grounds, no c. sardinella were caught in extensive sampling in the yellowknife, beaulieu or stark rivers flowing into great slave lake (blackie et al. 2012; a. muir & p. vecsei, personal observations). 465 muir et al. coregonus_zenithicus great slave lake shortjaw cisco can be characterised by an included lower jaw, high premaxillary angle, downward projecting mouth and tan dorsum colour- ation in fresh specimens. coregonus_zenithicus is known to show considerable morphological variation across its range (koelz 1929; dymond 1943; rawson 1951; todd & steinhilber 2002), although the great slave lake specimens collected in the current study fall within and close to the mean values reported for the species. the total range of gillraker number for c. zenithicus in the laurentian great lakes was 32– 46 (koelz 1929), almost identical to the range we observed for the species in great slave lake (33–46). dymond (1943), rawson (1947), clarke (1973) and todd & steinhilber (2002) considered c. zeni- thicus to occur in great slave lake, but recent col- lections from the main basin of the lake led murray & reist (2003) to conclude that on the basis of gross morphology, those specimens were more simi- lar to c. artedi than c. zenithicus. dymond (1943) concluded that the type specimen from great slave lake described by harper & nichols (1919) as leucichthys macrognathus was synonymous with c. zenithicus. dymond’s measurements of the type specimen of l. macrognathus [see dymond (1943) p. 216 for data] had morphological characteristics consistent, and in some cases nearly identical to the mean values for c. zenithicus in our collections (tables 5 and 6). although our statistical models of body shape did not discriminate the shortjaw morph from the other great slave lake ciscoes, they were reasonably well discriminated (~65% of individuals) by a model of linear phenotypic traits. consistent with laurentian great lakes specimens, low numbers of short gillrak- ers and a slightly shorter lower jaw than upper jaw were distinguishing traits. the shortjaw morph also had a faster growth rate and a shorter asymptotic average length compared with its closest morphologi- cal variant – lacustrine c. artedi. management implications ciscoes play a key role in nutrient cycling by func- tioning as horizontal and vertical vectors of energy transfer from primary and secondary production to their predators (stockwell et al. 2009; gorman et al. 2012). for example, coregonus_kiyi in the deep waters (i.e., >100 m) of lake superior undertake dvm to prey on m. diluviana in the pelagia during night where they are vulnerable to predation by sisco- wet lake_trout salvelinus_namaycush (hrabik et al. 2006; sitar et al. 2008; stockwell et al. 2010; ahrenstorff et al. 2011; gorman et al. 2012). c. artedi 466 do not undertake deep dvm, but move large quanti- ties of energy from offshore pelagia to nearshore habitats during fall spawning migrations (stockwell et al. 2009). ciscoes are important forage for top predators such as lake_trout and burbot lota lota (scott & crossman 1973; ray et al. 2007; sitar et al. 2008; gamble et al. 2011). framework for the north american ciscoes do not easily fit into the current resource management, which is based on the concept of the ‘biological spe- cies’. for this reason, understanding how ciscoes evolve and their functional role in energy transfer within the food web comes to the forefront as a pre- requisite for determining appropriate means of cate- gorising and conserving diversity within this group of fishes. the ciscoes typically form complexes that show ecological and morphological variations that can be both genetically- and environmentally based. in an extensive mitochondrial and microsatellite survey of north american cisco phylogeography, turgeon & bernatchez (2003) reported that the tax- onomy of reflected geography than evolutionary history. these authors found that, based upon the genetic characters used, c. zenithicus was genetically more similar to sympat- ric or nearby c. artedi than to c. zenithicus from other drainages, indicative of multiple independent origins of morphs. turgeon & bernatchez (2003) argued that c. artedi should be recognised as the sole legitimate taxon for north american ciscoes and that unique ecomorphotypes be recognised as evolution- ary significant units (esus). the c. artedi complex better identifying, characterising and managing locally adapted cisco morphs that reflect important ecologi- cal and bioenergetic linkages are critical to conserv- ing the ecological integrity of northern food webs and ecosystems. the latter approach has been embraced by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada (cosewic). the species at risk act (sara) defines a ‘wildlife spe- cies’ as a ‘species, subspecies, variety or geographi- cally or genetically distinct population of animal, plant or other organism, other than a bacterium or virus’ (government of canada 2002). this defini- tion explicitly recognises the importance of ecologi- cally distinct phenotypes and, therefore, provides protection and status for cisco morphs in canada. on the basis of the available evidence reviewed herein, we concur with the summary conclusion of turgeon & bernatchez (2003) regarding the need to recognise the uniqueness of many lake-dwelling cis- coes and the need to develop management strategies that focus on local circumstances so as to ensure the protection of environments and the processes giving rise to evolutionary divergence within the species complex. acknowledgements this research was supported by canada’s interdepartmental recovery
