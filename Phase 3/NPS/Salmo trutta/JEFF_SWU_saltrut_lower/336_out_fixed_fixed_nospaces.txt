species conservation. we examined the habitat requirements of nine native freshwater ﬁsh species using 165 undisturbed or minimally disturbed sites from eight river basins in western iberia (northern and central portugal). six environmental descriptors were considered at the regional level, and six descriptors at a local scale. statistical associations between local assemblage structure and environmental variables were quantiﬁed by canonical correspondence analyses. logistic regression was performed for each species to identify regional and local factors related to its distribution at the sample sites. the results suggested a reasonable degree of specialisation in the use of local variables and dependence on regional variables. logistic regression models showed a good adjustment (0.75 < auc < 0.93). results of habitat modelling using minimally disturbed sites helped to clarify species preferences for speciﬁc abiotic drivers. m. t. ferreira1, l. sousa1, j. m. santos1, l.

terferreira@isa.utl.pt accepted for publication march 8, 2007 introduction freshwater ecosystems have frequently been cited as among those that are most altered and threatened by human activities (mason 1991; saunders et al. 2002; clavero et al. 2004). although initial approaches to decline and extinction phenomena were mostly centred on terrestrial organisms, more recently increas- ing attention has been paid to the conservation of freshwater fauna (harding et al. 1998; ricciardi & rasmussen 1999). however, to manage aquatic biodiversity we must understand how ﬁsh species are distributed and be able to predict their occurrence in a given area (ormerod 2003). knowledge of ﬁshes’ habitat requirements is an essential tool for species conservation and ﬁshery management (heggenes et al. 1991), but the relationship between ﬁsh species and ﬁsh assemblages and habitat is an extremely complex one (hubert & rahel 1989). the use of different uni- or multivariate methods to study species distribution and habitat requirements has increased over the last 20 years (leps & smilauer 2003). regression models in particular have been widely used to predict species distribution, abundance and habitat preference (e.g., beja & alcazar 2003; filipe et al. 2004; moreira et al. 2005). as predicted by margalef (1968), presence/absence data permit the detection of macroscale patterns in community eco- logical studies. however, most studies either consider sites with different degrees of human disturbance, where populations may thus be in a suboptimal habitat, or else include human-mediated variables to describe the habitat. a valid understanding of natural patterns and processes is an essential prerequisite for viable ecosystem management (stanford et al. 1996). we have therefore focused our research efforts on investigating patterns and processes in riverine land- scapes that are in a near-natural state. a number of studies indicate that ﬁsh assemblage organisation can be determined not only by local processes, but also by large-scale environmental factors (schlosser 1991; marsh-matthews & matthews 2000; magalha˜es et al. 2002; hoeinghaus et al. 2006). the importance of the scale of environmental variables 504 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00241.x that determine the distribution of individual ﬁsh species has not received as much attention (taylor 1996; wiley et al. 1997), because most population studies are focused on local conditions, a particular river or a speciﬁc region (e.g., bovee 1982; gore & nestler 1988; leftwich et al. 1997). in some cases, it has been possible to model the occurrence of ﬁsh species at the individual drainage basin scale (obe- rdorff et al. 2001; filipe et al. 2004), and to test the hypothesis of a common response to local and regional environmental variables (pont et al. 2005). in addi- tion, such as water volume, velocity and thermal regime, are often dependent on regional drivers, such as drainage area, hydrological regime and altitude (poff & allan 1995; wiley et al. 1997). the relative role and importance of scale factors in shaping and regulating species distri- bution can also be related to integrity assessment and conservation efforts, because these depend on species- speciﬁc perturbation drivers and the spatial scale upon which they act. local habitat characteristics, in this study we aim: (i) to look at the habitat requirements of nine native iberian ﬁsh species by identifying their environmental correlates at undis- turbed or minimally disturbed sites; and (ii) to assess the relative importance of these local and regional environmental variables on the occurrence of each species. environmental correlates of iberian ﬁsh fauna study area the study area is located in western iberia and includes the hydrological network of central and northern portugal (fig. 1). these rivers ﬂow ne–sw towards the west atlantic coast, and the largest basins (minho, lima, douro and tagus) are shared with spain. the inland area is dominated by the pre- mesozoic hesperic massif – a complex geological unit that includes granites, schists and quartzites with a various degrees of metamorphism – whereas most of the western coastal fringe is characterised by tertiary layers under quaternary deposits. the southern region below the main course of the river tagus is dominated by the ﬂat platforms of the hesperic massif, and in the lower boundary by the meso-cenozoic strata, which is composed of sedimentary deposits (e.g., sandstones, limestones, conglomerates and marls), mainly with a calcareous background. littoral areas form part of the ceno-antropozoic sedimentary basin, with soft clay and marl deposits. the rainfall pattern exhibits strong seasonal and inter-annual variability, as well as a discharge regime that is typical of mediterranean rivers. high ﬂoods usually occur in autumn or early winter, with a gradual decline in ﬂow that eventually dries out during late spring and summer in the southernmost areas. asym- metries in the regional climate are well marked, and fig. 1. map of the study area and location of sampling sites in the different river bas- ins. 505 ferreira et al. inﬂuenced mainly by elevation and the proximity of the atlantic ocean, with longer summer droughts in the continental parts and southern regions. mean annual temperatures in the latter are typically above 17.5 °c, sometimes with less than 400 mm of mean annual rainfall. by contrast, the northern border of the study area presents a more temperate-like climate: the annual rainfall can reach 2200 mm and mean annual temperature is below 10 °c. the landscape varies greatly across the studied area, with a patchy pattern of land use in central and western basins, including orchards, vineyards, olive groves and irrigation crops. northern areas and those inland or at higher altitudes are mostly forested, with pinus and eucalyptus plantations, or mediterranean woods, whereas the southern areas are more homogenous and characterised by cork-oak and holm-oak wood- lands. the largest human settlements and industries are located in littoral areas. material and methods data collection fish sampling was carried out in early spring by electroﬁshing using european committee for normal- ization standards (norm 14011/2002 for wadeable streams) at 165 sites from eight river basins (minho, lima, ca´vado, douro, vouga, mondego, lis and tagus) in western iberia (northern and central portu- gal). sample sites were considered undisturbed or minimally disturbed and had previously been extracted from a data set of more than 500 available sampling locations. these were identiﬁed using existing euro- pean guidelines (refcond 2003) and the eu-fame project approach (http://fame.boku.ac.at), in which human disturbance is ranked semiquantitatively using all ﬁeld data and available gis information. in this case, we considered ﬁve disturbance variables: integ- rity of the riparian galleries and naturalness of the banks, longitudinal connectivity of the river segment, sediment load, input of toxic and acidic efﬂuents, and nutrient input. each variable was scored from 1 (minimum disturbance) to 5 (maximum disturbance), and only sites scoring 1 or 2 for all ﬁve variables were retained for the analysis. local and regional environmental variables were determined for each site according to their scale of deﬁnition and spatial variability (table 1). the local variables were obtained in situ and regional variables were obtained from arcview gis and 1:25,000 topographic maps. local variables included mean width (m), maximum depth (m), instream cover [deﬁned as any submerged structure in which ﬁsh could be hidden from overhead view, undercut banks and surface water turbulence and scored subjectively from 0 (absent) to 3 (abundant)], abundance of macrophytes substrate coarseness (determined visually as 1 ¼ silt, 2 ¼ sand, 3 ¼ gra- vel/pebble, 4 ¼ cobble, 5 ¼ boulder and 6 ¼ bed- rock), mean depth (m), and overhanging tree shading (scored as 0: absent, 1: <30%, 2: 30–60% and 3: >60%). regional variables included mean air tem- perature (°c), catchment area (km2), altitude (m), (mm), gradient evapotranspiration (mm), runoff (mm) and distance to source (km). to deal with spatial autocorrelation in the response variable, we included an autocorrelation term (see augustin et al. 1996). this term was generated for each site as the slope (%), mean annual average (%), dominant rainfall annual regional variables mean air temperature (°c) altitude (m) gradient slope (%) evapotranspiration (mm) distance to source (m) catchment area (km2) mean annual rainfall (mm) average annual runoff (mm) local variables mean depth (m)

within 30 km in the river continuum where a given species occurs. data analysis a total of 22 species were sampled in western iberia, but only native ﬁsh species with a broad distribution (i.e., occurring at more than 10% of sampling sites) and presenting a reasonable number of individuals along environmental gradients were considered in the analy- sis. altogether, nine species were used in the analysis. statistical association between assemblage structure and environmental variables was quantiﬁed by canon- ical correspondence analysis (cca) (ter braak & verdonschot 1995), using canoco 4 (ter braak & smilauer 1998) on a 165 sites · 9 species matrix. separate ccas were performed using local and regional environmental data sets. a forward stepwise selection procedure was used to obtain the best predictors for the model, at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, using a monte carlo permutation test (999 permutations). fish densities were log(x + 1) to min- imise the effect of extreme values (legendre & legendre 1998). logistic regression analysis was used to model the inﬂuence of different variables (local and regional) on the occurrences of nine ﬁsh species. in mediterranean rivers, many native species are restricted to one or a few basins for palaeo-historical and evolutive reasons (doadrio 2001). to account for this in the models that we developed for each species, we only considered their natural area of occurrence by analysing only basins where a species is potentially present. firstly, spearman’s analysis of correlations between the environmental variables was used to detect redundant variables, and those for which correlation values were greater than |0.8| were excluded from the analysis. twelve variables were considered, plus the variable used to deal with spatial autocorrelation. secondly, a stepwise selection procedure was applied to each variable with a probability of entry of p 6 0.05 and removal of p > 0.05 (see hosmer & lemeshow 1989). the association between the explanatory variables and interactions with the response variable was tested using the maximum likelihood method (hosmer & lemeshow 1989). this procedure was ﬁrst applied separately for the variables from the two different scales (local and regional), and subsequently using only the signiﬁcant environmental correlates obtained in these scales to produce the ﬁnal model. assessing prediction accuracy the predictive accuracy of the ﬁnal models was assessed using the area under the curve (auc) of the environmental correlates of iberian ﬁsh fauna receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (field- ing & bell 1997; pearce & ferrier 2000). we used this graphical method to represent the relationship between the percentage of presences correctly predicted (sensitivity) and one minus the percentage of the absences correctly predicted (speciﬁcity). the area comprised between a 45° line and the curve measures the discrimination – i.e., the model’s ability to correctly classify a species as present or absent at a given plot (auc). we used a rough guide to classify the accuracy: 0.50–0.60 ¼ fail; 0.60–0.70 ¼ poor; 0.70–0.80 ¼ fair; 0.90– 1 ¼ excellent (swets 1988). 0.80–0.90 ¼ good; variation partitioning for glm models the variation in the data set was partitioned to assess the relative importance of regional and local compo- nents in the selected logistic models. the methodology we followed is an adaptation of that proposed by borcard et al. (1992) and legendre & legendre (1998), but extended to logistic regression (e.g., reino 2005). the nagelkerke pseudo-r2 (nagelkerke 1991) was used as a measure of variation explained by each logistic model. the total variation in the expansion model was partitioned into four independent compo- nents: (i) a pure local component, a; (ii) a shared component – i.e., the local variation that is regionally structured, b; (iii) a pure regional component that is probably due to large-scale effects, c; and (iv) unexplained variation, d. the total variation was partitioned by the expression vt ¼ a + b + c + d, which was used to extract any single component. this procedure involves calculating the following statistical models: (i) one ‘partial’ logistic regression using local variables to obtain the signiﬁcant terms (a + b) using a stepwise selection procedure; ‘partial’ logistic regression for regional descriptors (b + c), again using a stepwise selection procedure; and (iii) one joint local–regional model with all previously signiﬁcant variables to obtain the shared effects (a + b + c). all data analyses were performed with spss v. 12.0. (ii) another p results fish assemblages the ﬁsh species we examined were well distributed throughout the sample sites and presented a mean occurrence of at least 15% in our data set (table 2). barbus bocagei steindachner, salmo_trutta linnaeus and squalius carolitertii doadrio were the most frequently captured species and occurred at more than 42% of the sampling sites. cobitis paludica de buen and chondrostoma oligolepis steindachner were the 507 ferreira et al. table 2. mean, standard error (se), maximum (max) and minimum (min) values of relative abundance for the nine species collected at 165 sites in western iberia. species mean se max min fo(%) barbus bocagei (steindachner) squalius pyrenaicus (gu¨nther) squalius alburnoides (steindachner) squalius carolitertii (doadrio) chondrostoma polylepis (steindachner) chondrostoma duriense (coelho) chondrostoma oligolepis (steindachner) cobitis paludica (de buen) salmo_trutta (linnaeus) 50.7 8.8 14.5 22.2 13.9 12.8 9.0 2.7 10.0 13.2 1255 0 214 0 2.2 3.5 358 0 515 0 4.8 321 0 2.8 486 0 4.1 217 0 2.2 0.8 75 0 100 0 1.5 45.8 21.1 24.1 42.2 34.9 18.7 15.7 16.3 44.0 mean frequency of occurrence of each species (fo, %) is also shown. least frequent species, and occurred at 16–18% of the sampling sites – mostly in the douro (53%) and lis river basins (100%), respectively. the smaller cypri- nids squalius pyrenaicus gu¨nther and squalius alburnoides steindachner were mainly restricted to the tagus river basin, whereas c. paludica was not present in the northern part of the study area, nor was chondrostoma duriense coelho found in the southern part of the study area. those composed mostly of s. trutta, followed by a dominance of small cyprinids, such as s. carolitertii and s. pyrenaicus, to assemblages characterised by b. bocagei and c. duriense. this gradient was associated with altitude (t ¼ 4.55, p < 0.05), mean annual temperature (t ¼ 6.27, p < 0.05) and average annual runoff (t ¼ 3.66, p < 0.05). the ﬁrst two axes in the cca ordination based on local variables (fig. 2b) were signiﬁcant (p < 0.05), with eigenvalues of 0.259 and 0.187, respectively. the explanatory variables accounted for 16.1% of the total variation in site-assemblage composition, with the ﬁrst and second axes displaying 85.3% of that variation. as depicted in the biplot, the ﬁsh community changed along the ﬁrst axis from assemblages characterised by the larger sized cyprinids, b. bocagei and c. duriense and also s. trutta, to assemblages characterised such as s. pyrenaicus, by small-sized cyprinids, s. alburnoides and c. oligolepis. this separation was mainly related to instream cover (t ¼ 7.43, p < 0.05) and abundance of macrophytes (t ¼ )4.44, p < 0.05). the second axis revealed a weaker gradient associated with substrate coarseness (t ¼ )3.89, p < 0.05) and shading (t ¼ )3.94, p < 0.05). multivariate response of ﬁsh communities models for individual species the results obtained in cca based on regional variables (fig. 2a) revealed a modest species separ- ation along the two canonical axes (k1 ¼ 0.380; k2 ¼ 0.145, p < 0.05). the explanatory variables accounted for 16% of the total variation in site- assemblage composition, with the ﬁrst and second axes displaying 83% of that variation. the ﬁrst axis revealed a gradient of ﬁsh assemblages going from the variables, evapotranspiration, distance to source and mean depth, were excluded (r p |0.8|) from the analysis. twelve variables were therefore retained for subsequent analyses. the autocorrelation variable was not signiﬁcant for any species univariate models and we did not include this term in further analyses. the models showed that species occurrences were signiﬁcantly related to both regional and local fig. 2. axes one and two of the canonical correspondence analysis biplot for the 9 species and (a) regional variables, (b) local variables, assessed in western iberia. 508 variables, thereby suggesting an interplay of inﬂuences between scales (table 3). substrate coarseness and overhanging shading were the most frequently selec- ted local variables. geomorphological variables (gra- dient slope and altitude) also played an important role in the occurrence of species – namely chondrostoma polylepis steindachner c. oligolepis, s. carolitertii, s. trutta and b. bocagei. the latter species was mainly associated with larger lowland streams. by contrast, s. trutta displayed a positive association with altitude, depth and shading and a negative association with mean annual temperature. local habitat variables, such as stream width, cover, substrate coarseness and shading, were signiﬁcant correlates for the occurrence of s. pyrenaicus, s. alburnoides and c. duriense. cobitis paludica was found to be mainly conﬁned to warmer areas presenting ﬁner substrates – i.e., coastal and lower courses of main rivers. in the ﬁnal model, some species related more to regional (c. oligolepis) or local (c. duriense and s. pyrenaicus) variables. accuracy of glm models the models was classiﬁed in the low- none of accuracy classes (auc < 0.7) (table 4). fit and classiﬁcation accuracies of logistic regression models were high, indicating a strong predictive power (84%). the model for s. alburnoides had the lowest model class (0.8 < auc < 0.9) was assigned to four species s. trutta and belonging to four genera, with c. oligolepis models displaying the highest levels (93% and 90%, respectively). (75%). good accuracy accuracy variation partitioning for glm models local, shared and regional components (considering all signiﬁcant variables obtained in stepwise logistic regression) managed to explain between 70.5% (s. trutta) and 23.5% (s. carolitertii) of model vari- ation, but the explanation of the distribution patterns varied from species to species (fig. 3). some of the studied distributions are highly associated with pure local attributes which are mainly related to habitat (s. alburnoides, s. pyrenaicus and c. duriense), and which ranged from 17.1% to 27.9% of total variation. by contrast, after accounting for local attributes, pure regional covariates are highly represented in three species (s. trutta, c. paludica and c. oligolepis), thus suggesting an underlying large-scale spatial trend in their distribution. moreover, shared effects also represented a variation in distribution, from 1.9% (s. alburnoides) to 35.3% (b. bocagei). we should note that species which are highly associated with regional variables also have strong shared effects, thus suggesting that some of the local attributes may be i d e n a t b o e c n a c ﬁ n g s i i f o l s e v

1997; filipe et al. 2002; santos et al. 2004a) and in other geographical areas (lyons 1989; rahel & hubert 1991). assemblage composition was also related to local-scale features, such as cover, abundance of macrophytes, substrate coarseness and shading – variables that other studies (godinho et al. 2000; pires et al. 2004; santos et al. 2006) have found to be important. cover may be important for resting and hiding, and can be related to invertebrate production (particularly submerged and emergent species) and structural habitat complexity (moyle & cech 1996). the availability of coarse substrate is important in that it provides protection against widespread mammals (such as the otter lutra lutra and beech marten martes foina) and birds (such as kingﬁsher alcedo atthis, grey heron ardea cineria and little egret egretta garzetta) and prevents ﬁsh from being washed away by high ﬂow events. abundance of macrophytes was also found to be essential. in fact, cyprinids, such as b. bocagei and c. polylepis, eat large amounts of plant (magalha˜es 1992; collares-pereira et al. material 1996), and s. alburnoides is a phytophil spawner (fame consortium 2004). regional and local-scale factors were thus both signiﬁcant correlates of the ﬁsh assemblage structure. however, there may be other factors including population dynamics, species interactions and histor- ical factors, such as isolation arising from the forma- tion and evolution of the basin systems (carmona et al. 1999). furthermore, our analyses should be viewed with caution as they represent an ecological snapshot, and interannual or more sampling-intensive studies would help to clarify the environmental correlates that are subject to temporal variability (lohr & fausch 1997; wiley et al. 1997; magalha˜es et al. 2002). inﬂuencing species distribution, the generally high ﬁt and classiﬁcation accuracy of the logistic regression models support the basic hypothesis of our modelling approach that signiﬁcant relationships exist between local habitat features, spatial variables and the occurrence of ﬁsh species in western iberian rivers. however, several factors could fig. 3. variation partitioning applied to the nine glms developed for each ﬁsh species in western iberia. regional or spatially structured. for example, s. trutta this accounts for 20% of total variation. in discussion this study focused on ﬁsh distribution in western iberia and on the relative importance of local and regional factors that shape the ﬁsh assemblage struc- ture. the most signiﬁcant way in which our study differed from most others was that the sampling network consisted of undisturbed or minimally dis- turbed sites. canonical correspondence analysis revealed that generic patterns in the ﬁsh assemblage composition in western iberia were primarily associated with water- shed features and the hydrological regime, such as altitude, slope, rainfall and run-off. overall, the ﬁsh community went from assemblages dominated by s. trutta, followed by assemblages with a dominance of small cyprinids, such as s. pyrenaicus, s. alburno- ides and c. oligolepis, to assemblages characterised by the larger cyprinids, b. bocagei and c. duriense. our results from the network of minimally disturbed sites 510 for the lower have been responsible accuracy classiﬁcation that occurred with some of the models, particularly in the case of s. alburnoides, s. carolitertii and c. polylepis. there may also be habitat measures that are missing from this analysis and could increase predictive power. for example, additional measures often used in predictive models for ﬁsh at a local scale include dissolved oxygen, ph and conductivity (bain & robinson 1988; fausch et al. 1988), and these variables could be important in this system as well. there may be other factors inﬂuencing the presence of ﬁshes, including site-based population dynamics, species interactions and historical factors (guisan & zimmermann 2000). fish are also constrained by their historically deﬁned drainage basins (williams et al. 2003). unlike other authors (hinch et al. 1994), who found that spatial autocorrelation might strongly affect inferences about large-scale distributional patterns, in our study this variable was not a determinant for species models, possibly due to the larger distance between neighbours (30 km) when compared with other studies (magalha˜es et al. 2002). our models clearly emphasised the importance of examining species–habitat relationships at different spatial scales (local and regional). altitude remained a major ecological factor for some species: b. bocagei and c. oligolepis were negatively related to this variable, whereas s. trutta showed a positive associ- ation. it is known that altitude inﬂuences species occurrence through water temperature (huet 1949), thus indirectly governing ﬁsh population density via growth and fecundity (lobo´ n-cervia´ et al. 1996). slope was also a regional key variable selected by the models, as it displayed signiﬁcant negative associa- tions for four cyprinid species (b. bocagei, s. caroli- tertii, c. polylepis and c. oligolepis). slope makes a major contribution to the erosive force acting on substrate and bed scour in a given area (cobb et al. 1992). weaker slopes within our study area are associated with higher habitat heterogeneity, thus favouring higher species richness (e.g., coexistence of cyprinid species). physical habitat and channel morphology descrip- tors also played an important role in species occur- rence. stream width was positively related to the probability of the presence of the larger cyprinids, b. bocagei and c. duriense. this pattern (i.e., larger ﬁsh associated with wider and deeper habitat) has been found elsewhere in other iberian rivers (rincon et al. 1990; godinho et al. 1997; carmona et al. 1999; pires et al. 1999; santos et al. 2004b). sub- strate coarseness and shading were also important correlates of ﬁsh species occurrence. the availability of coarse substrate for small-sized species, such as s. pyrenaicus and s. alburnoides, is important in that it provides cover and concealment and also relatively environmental correlates of iberian ﬁsh fauna better habitat for macroinvertebrates that provide them with a source of food (doadrio 2001). in contrast, c. paludica’s negative response to substrate coarseness is consistent with some studies on this species (perdices & doadrio 1997; valladolid & przybylski 2003; clavero et al. 2005). shading was positively related to probability of occurrence of s. pyrenaicus, c. polyl- epis and s. trutta. the importance of shading, and thus canopy cover, to ﬁshes has been demonstrated in a number of papers (schlosser 1991; schiemer et al. 1995; stauffer et al. 2000). larger ﬁsh, such as c. polylepis and s. trutta, have been found to favour areas with a high canopy cover, and this could be due to a combination of factors including physical stresses, food availability, predation risk or competitive inter- actions (schlosser 1991; collares-pereira et al. 1995; mellina et al. 2005; santos et al. 2006). shading is also important to small-sized s. pyrenaicus, as it is a major component of instream cover that provides refuge in well-conserved upper reaches and small iberian streams (corbacho & sa´nchez 2001; clavero et al. 2005). but our study also provided insights into the occurrence of less well-known iberian species. for example, c. oligolepis was found to be negatively associated to large-scale descriptors, such as altitude, slope and catchment area – i.e., it inhabits mainly small coastal rivers and the lower reaches of main tributaries. both local and regional attributes were signiﬁcant correlates of ﬁsh species distribution in western iberia. the purely local attributes accounted for much of the model variation of c. duriense and s. alburnoides. previous authors (godinho et al. 1997; pires et al. 1999; santos et al. 2006) had pointed out that the distribution of these species is governed ﬁrst by the suitability of physical habitat and hydraulic conditions, such as cover, substrate and velocity. on the other hand, factors that operate on a regional scale (tem- perature, altitude and catchment area) possessed a greater explanatory power for the two species inhab- iting the smallest streams (s. trutta and c. oligolepis). our results seem to demonstrate that the responses of species that inhabit small-order streams differed from those occurring in larger rivers. also, the largest proportion of explained variation for some of the species (s. pyrenaicus and b. bocagei) was due to the interactions between both sets of attributes. moreover, species that were highly associated with regional variables (s. trutta, c. oligolepis and c. paludica) also had strong shared effects, thus suggesting that some of the local attributes may be regional or spatially structured. this overlapping could be a consequence of local data acting partially as a synthetic descriptor of unmeasured underlying regional processes. future research should be extended to the inﬂuence of other factors, to further elucidate the in an attempt 511 ferreira et al. mechanisms governing the occurrence of iberian ﬁsh species. knowing how ﬁsh species respond to habitat heterogeneity on multiple scales can be useful to ﬁshery managers, watershed restoration groups and others with an interest in conservation (fausch et al. 2002; filipe et al. 2002; allan 2004). species that respond primarily to local factors, such as s. alburno- ides, s. pyrenaicus and c. duriense, may have a patchy distribution and hence be more vulnerable to immediate disturbances, but their populations are nonetheless more easily recovered, while species that are principally governed by regional factors, such as s. trutta and c. oligolepis, would be especially affected by broad-scale disturbances, such as climate change and river discontinuities, and therefore less responsive to management actions. nonetheless, the high rate of endemicity of iberian native ichthyofauna (clavero et al. 2004) should deserve special concern for the conservation of inland waters. all studied species, particularly s. alburnoides and s. pyrenaicus, are currently threatened by deterioration or destruction of habitats, both by pollution and intense modiﬁca- tions (i.e., damming and channelisation) and the introduction of exotic species (cabral et al. 2006). the glm models provided insights into how both landscape and reach-scale factors affect ﬁsh species occurrence, and are thus useful for setting or reﬁning management goals and evaluating the effectiveness of species management and conservation. subsequent efforts that include ecological attributes of ﬁsh species, such as reproductive and trophic guilds (oberdorff et al. 1993; belliard et al. 1997) and also colonisation abilities (grenouillet et al. 2004), and others that focus on variables related to dispersal success (dunham & rieman 1999), may improve predictions of the occurrence of native iberian ﬁsh fauna. acknowledgements the authors would
