sprint; dispersal barriers; fishway; conservation introduction invasive species are a major threat to global biodiver- sity (gurevitch & padilla 2004; rahel et al. 2008; vorosmarty et al. 2010), with a review of 170 cases of native extinctions finding over half (54%) were linked to invasive species (clavero & garcia-berthou 2005). extinctions can arise from the many negative effects of alien invasive species, which can include increased predation and competition (komak & crossland 2000; blanchet et al. 2008; kipp & riccia- rdi 2012), new diseases and parasites (langdon & humphrey 1987; salgado-maldonado & pineda- lopez 2003) and degraded habitats (king et al. 1997; miller & crowl 2006; vilizzi et al. 2014) that compromise the health of native populations and communities. consequently, understanding how and why invasive species spread into new habitats is a key priority for natural resource management (mack et al. 2000; rahel et al. 2008; vorosmarty et al. 2010). investigations of new species invasions have often mapped changes in the distribution of an invasive spe- cies over time to monitor and control their spread (e.g. franch et al. 2008; brownscombe & fox 2012; kroon et al. 2015), typically following a human-assisted introduction to a new area (mack et al. 2000; waters et al. 2002; lintermans 2004; gozlan et al. 2010). however, such post-mortem approaches do not allow for risk assessments of invasive species to proactively control or prevent in native ecosystems (mack et al. 2000; kolar & lodge 2001). invasive species become established in new habi- tats by overcoming barriers to their dispersal, which can be geographical, physiological and/or ecological in nature (moyle & light 1996; jackson et al. 2001; peterson & vieglais 2001; johnson et al. 2009). although human-assisted translocation is one of the their establishment correspondence: christopher j. fulton, research school of biology, australian national university, canberra act australia. e-mail: christopher.fulton@anu.edu.au doi: 10.1111/eff.12256 75 starrs et al. major causes of invasive species introductions to an area (mack et al. 2000; lintermans 2004; gozlan et al. 2010), the intrinsic dispersal traits of species can shape their capacity to fully invade new areas (kolar & lodge 2001). for example, behavioural aggression was found to drive the rapid range expan- sion of a passerine bird in north-western usa, where biased dispersal of highly aggressive males on the invasion front allowed western bluebirds to displace mountain bluebirds (duckworth & badyaev 2007). similar insights have been gained into cane toad invasions across northern australia, where examina- tion of changes in the thermal sensitivity and locomo- tor performance of cane toads on the invasion front has revealed why invasion rates have increased five- fold over the past 50 years (kolbe et al. 2010; llewelyn et al. 2010). such examples illustrate the power of using intrinsic characters of invasive species to understand and predict range expansions following their translocation into new areas. alien freshwater fish were first introduced into australian waterways in the mid-1800s by acclimati- sation societies (lintermans 2004). since then, more than 40 species have become established (harris 2013), ranging from small gambusia holbrooki (1–6 cm total length, tl) to large-bodied cyprinus carpio (over 100 cm tl) fishes. apart from direct human intervention in range expansion, the range limits of fish species are often a function of their locomotion capabilities (jackson et al. 2001), with interactions between swimming speed performance and environ- mental variables (e.g. flow speed, temperature) driv- ing the extent of into new upstream habitats (tierney et al. 2011). often the critical limitations to upstream invasions are over- coming potential instream obstacles such as high- velocity flow points or physical breaks in streams (hinch et al. 2002; castro-santos 2005; ovidio et al. 2007). as such, we can assess the likelihood of upstream invasion by fish species, based on their ability to overcome instream obstacles, and most importantly, identify strategies for how such inva- sions may be contained by manipulating flows or targeted trapping at migratory obstacles (leprieur et al. 2006; spens et al. 2007). invasions species duration of swimming activity and attempt rate are considered to be important variables in analysing fish passage through obstacles. although it is commonly measured, ucrit has been found to be of little rele- vance to obstacles where fish can swim much faster for shorter time periods and overcome flows that otherwise appear too fast in terms of ucrit (castro- santos 2004, 2005; starrs et al. 2011). conversely, burst swimming may not be relevant to pipe culverts where high speeds must be maintained for more than 30 s to make passage (starrs et al. 2011). the metric 76 of sprint swimming has been suggested to be most relevant to passage through such areas of intermedi- ate to high-flow velocity (castro-santos 2005; starrs et al. 2011; tierney et al. 2011; donaldson et al. 2013), and provides a compromise between the few seconds and few hours that burst and critical swim- ming speed measures target. their here, we assess the likelihood of upstream inva- sion by four alien fish species into new riverine habi- tats using measurements of intrinsic sprint swimming speed performance (castro-santos 2005; starrs et al. 2011). drawing upon the fact that human-assisted translocations have placed four inva- sive species at different levels in the focal catchment (lintermans 2012; broadhurst et al. 2014), we matched swimming speeds against flows through six potential barriers of natural (two high-flow riffles) and anthropogenic (vertical-slot fishway, rock-ramp fishway, pipe culvert) origin, to calculate the likeli- hood of upstream passage under a range of regulated water discharge rates in a montane river system. to achieve this, we used logistic regression models to combine measures of sprint swimming speed perfor- mance in populations of four alien freshwater fishes spanning a wide range of body sizes (2–32 cm tl), with water flow velocity data to explore the potential role of instream barriers in limiting the upstream invasion risk of these alien freshwater fishes. in con- sidering these invasive species passage probabilities, we explore how this may conflict with the need to minimise barriers to the upstream spawning migra- tions of a threatened species (macquarie perch, mac- quaria australasica) in the same catchment (starrs et al. 2011; lintermans 2012). methods study site and species (goldfish, (redfin perch, family percidae) the cotter river flows north-east from the southern edge of the australian capital territory (act) bor- der, draining into the murrumbidgee river (fig. 1a, b). we studied four alien fish species that occur within the lower cotter river: gambusia holbrooki (eastern gambusia, family poecilidae), carassius family cyprinidae), perca auratus and fluviatilis oncorhynchus_mykiss (rainbow trout, family sal- monidae) following the protocols approved by the australian national university animal experimenta- tion ethics committee. carassius auratus was intro- duced to the cotter river in 1888; o. mykiss was introduced to act waterways in the late 1890s; p. fluviatilis became established in small ponds and subsequently spread to act riverine habitats follow- ing floods in 1983; and g. holbrooki is estimated to have been introduced to the cotter catchment prior to the 1970s (lintermans et al. 1990; lintermans 2002; lintermans unpubl. data). three of these alien species have penetrated different distances upstream of cotter dam (first constructed in 1915), with o. mykiss widely distributed throughout the catchment, but g. holbrooki and c. auratus largely confined to cot- ter dam and approximately 1 km upstream; p. fluvi- atilis is yet to be recorded upstream of cotter dam (lintermans 2012). fish of body sizes representative alien fish invasion risk 0 e; 35°15 0 e; 35°13 0 s, 148°58 for these species in this region (table 1;

(2011). briefly, to measure sprint speeds (usprint), each fish was placed in the working section (20 cm wide, 20 cm high and 95 cm long) of the 194-litre recirculating flow tank and given a 5 min flow acclimation period at  1. if after this 5 min acclimation period the 0.05 ms fish displayed normal rheotaxic behaviour (swim- ming constantly into the flow), water flow velocity  1 every 10 s was increased stepwise by 0.05 ms until the fish could no longer hold position into the main flow and made contact with the downstream retaining grid for more than 3 s. sprint swimming trials were an average (se, n = 80 trials) of 2.2  0.9 min duration (excluding 5 min acclima- tion). sprint swimming speed for each individual was then calculated as: usprint = ui + [u(ti/t)], where  1), ti the amount ui is the penultimate velocity (ms of time swum in the final increment, t the set time increment (10 s), and u the set velocity increment (0.05 ms swimming speed (ucrit) were taken in the same stepwise fash- ion using longer set time increments (15 min), after a 30 min initial acclimation, such that these pro- longed ucrit trials were an average (se, n = 105 trials) (excluding 30 min acclimation). upon completion of a swim- ming trial, the total length, body depth and width of each fish were measured to the nearest millimetre. each fish was used only once for a ucrit and/or  1). measurements of critical 85.0  4.8 min duration of table 1. mean (se) mass and body length of fish from the four alien species examined in the swimming speed trials. species gambusia holbrooki (n = 58) carassius auratus (n = 18) perca fluviatilis (n = 38) onchorynchus mykiss (n = 21) mass (g) 0.4  0.1 17.8  4.1 83.9  8.3 94.0  12.5 total length (cm) 3.0  0.1 9.7  0.8 18.4  4.9 20.9  1.1 77 starrs et al. usprint assessment. corrections for solid blocking effects were made to the measured sprint swimming speeds following the method described by fulton (2007). flow profiling potential barriers flow profiling of a vertical slot fishway in the lower cotter river (below cotter dam, fig. 1b) was conducted at two common drought levels of river dis- charge (i.e. sustained periods of lowest flow) in this regulated catchment: 2 and 20 mlday  1. flows were recorded within 5 cm of the floor of the fish- way based on the assumption that fish will tend to swim close to the bottom (which was confirmed in the swimming trials). flow velocity data for a rock- ramp fishway (vanitys crossing, fig. 1b) and pipe culvert (pipeline crossing, fig. 1b) were also sourced from a previous study using the same equipment and method as used here (starrs et al. 2011). flow mea- surements were recorded with an open-propeller flow probe (vernier labquest flo-bta) connected to a digital recorder set to take flow measurements at a  1 over 30 s. this provided an approxima- rate of 1 s tion of mean flows experienced by a fish swimming at a sprint speed performance level. nearby natural riffle sections immediately downstream of the poten- tial barriers were also flow profiled for comparison following the same method of starrs et al. (2011). data analyses first-quartile flows (lowest 25% of velocities) within the potential barriers (vertical slot and adjacent riffle measured here, plus three other barriers and riffles measured by starrs et al. 2011) were used in all analyses, with the assumption that fish are flow-sen- sitive and will seek areas of slowest flow during upstream passage through a potential barrier, follow- ing starrs et al. (2011). sprint swimming speed per- formances of fish were compared to water velocities through the six potential barriers at varying river discharges to predict passage probability. sprint swimming speed performance was the chosen metric because it provided the most appropriate measure relative to the time and distance needed to overcome the short potential barriers examined here (i.e. swim- ming performance maintained for 30 s–5 min). spe- cies-specific through each potential barrier were made via box plot representa- tions of distances travelled by individuals of each species at (sprint speed – lowest quartile flow velocity) relative to the distance threshold required to make passage through the potential barrier (fig. 1c). to simplify graphical representations, only the section with the lowest respective groundspeeds analyses of passage their 78 a failure section represents predicted passage was presented, as passage through the most difficult section is indicative of passage through all sections, and lack of success at the most difficult to make upstream passage through the obstacle. passage was deemed to be successful if a fish of given size: (i) exhibited a swimming speed faster than the 1st quar- tile of measured flows in that section and (ii) created a positive groundspeed sufficient to swim the length that flow speed in <5 min (the of the section at defined upper time limit that sprint swimming speed can be maintained). for the pipeline road crossing pipe culvert, the pipe (of seven in total) with the lowest flow velocity and sufficient depth to have measureable flow (equal to or >12 cm depth) was selected under each discharge for analysis as the pipe with the highest probability of passage. five large of o. mykiss exceeded the highest measurable speed of the flow  1) and were subsequently excluded tank (1.0 ms from analysis to restrict our examinations to a size range that allowed measurement of maximum sprint speeds only. (>25 cm tl) individuals total fish could pass all community-level assessments of fish invasion potential were explored through a mixed-species model of length against swimming perfor- mance, which involved fitting a community-level nonlinear power function (videler 1993) to all sprint swimming performance data, with total length as the explanatory variable. we then pooled individuals from all species to calculate binary logistic regres- sions that predicted levels of alien fish passage through each obstacle at each river discharge level, with fish size (total length) as the predictive vari- able. a decision matrix was used, where a binary passage outcome (yes/no) was calculated for each individual fish at each section of each obstacle. if an individual (i.e. all answers = yes) of a potential barrier based on its sprint swimming performance, it was predicted to make upstream. this was repeated for all 80 individuals measured across the four alien species in this study. fish size was chosen as the predictive variable for two reasons: (i) fish total length was strongly correlated with swimming speed, and (ii) total length provides an easily mea- sured aspect of a fish individual for an observer to use the logistic regression to calculate likelihood of passage for that individual. for our modelling, a potential barrier was deemed impassable if <5% of fish of a certain size were predicted to make pas- sage. assessments of the likelihood of successful passage by the four species were informed by data on the size range of individuals caught during fish monitoring programs in different parts of this catchment (2010 to present), using fyke and gills successful sections passage alien fish invasion risk removal nets above and below cotter reservoir, backpack electrofishing in the cotter river between cotter and bendora dams (broadhurst et al. 2014) and immediately below cotter dam using electrofishing and chemical (lintermans unpubl. data). decision matrices were compiled in microsoft excel 2000, and logistic regressions analysed in spss (version 17, ibm corporation) and plotted in sigma- plot (version 9, statsoft pty ltd). a 95% level of confidence was used to infer statistical significance in all cases (a = 0.05). results the four alien fish species displayed a wide range of swimming speeds, with mean values for ucrit and to usprint  1 (g. holbrooki) 0.70 ms to 0.92 ms respectively (fig. 2). these speeds were comparable to the flows observed ranging from 0.24 ms  1 (o. mykiss) and 0.35 ms  1 (g. holbrooki) (o. mykiss),  1 slot fishway (i.e. in distance, none of through the vertical slot fishway and adjacent riffle, which varied markedly with section and river dis- charge (table 2). combining fish sprint swimming speeds with flows measured in the six potential barri- ers, we found passage probability by the four alien fish species differed markedly among obstacles (fig. 3). under both high and low river discharge levels, the first-quartile velocities in slot one of the vertical entry point) greatly exceeded the maximum sprint swimming perfor- mances of all fish measured. while the vertical slot was very short these fish appeared capable of producing positive groundspeed at their maximum sprint speed (fig. 3a). notably, the nearby riffle produced much lower velocities and so appeared to allow the passage of all o. mykiss indi- viduals, and most c. auratus and p. fluviatilis, but no g. holbrooki at either river discharge level (fig. 3d). by contrast, much higher probabilities of passage by alien fish were apparent through the rock- ramp fishway at certain river discharges (fig. 3c); most g. holbrooki and all other species appear cap- able of passage through the rock-ramp fishway at 2.7 mlday  1 (fig. 3b); no g. holbrooki were through the fishway at 20- predicted to pass 30 mlday  1, while most c. auratus and p. fluvi- atilis and all o. mykiss were predicted to make pas- sage (fig. 3b). passage probability through the nearby riffle was similarly high to that of the rock- ramp fishway at both river discharges (fig. 3e). potential fish passage through the pipe culvert also decreased with increasing discharge, with at least 95% of the three larger species predicted to pass  1 using through at sprint swimming speeds, as well as at least 25% of (fig. 3c). under a 20- g. holbrooki 30 mlday  1 discharge most of o. mykiss and p. fluviatilis could swim through at least one pipe, while only some of c. auratus and no measured g. holbrooki were likely to make passage (fig. 3c). passage through the 13 m downstream riffle was comparable to the culvert at 2.7 mlday  1 (fig. 3f), least one pipe at 2.7 mlday individuals fig. 2. mean critical (ucrit) and sprint (usprint) swimming speeds of four alien freshwater fish species from the cotter river. *note  1 in an additional five o. mykiss individuals exceeded 1.0 ms sprint swimming speed trials and are not included in this mean. table 2. three levels of water flow speed (minimum–median–maximum,  1) flowing through the cotter campground vertical slot fishway and ms adjacent natural riffle habitat during two drought discharge levels from cotter dam (2 and 20 mlday  1). section slot 1 slots 2–4 cells 1–4 riffle (mainstream) riffle (refuge)  1 2 mlday (min – median – max)  1 20 mlday (min – median – max) 1.34 – 1.38 – 1.45 (n = 62) 1.17 – 1.43 – 1.87 (n = 62) 0.3 – 0.65 – 0.81 (n = 279) 0.34 – 0.52 – 0.84 (n = 279) 0 – 0.03 – 0.7 (n = 743) 0.33 – 0.64 – 1.16 (n = 15) 0.29 – 0.55 – 0.97 (n = 14) 0 – 0.07 – 0.92 (n = 743) 0 – 0.02 – 0.07 (n = 15) 0 – 0 – 0.1 (n = 15) 79 starrs et al. while at 20-30 mlday  1 riffle, passage was likely to be much greater than through the pipe culvert (fig. 3f). community-level swimming performance could be significantly explained by an overarching model of speed against fish total length across the four alien fish species tested (fig. 4a). fish tl at which the model predicted 50% passage by alien fish through the rock-ramp fishway and pipe culvert were 7.3 and 11.6 cm (fig. 4b,d) respectively, as com- pared to values of 7.4 and 6.0 cm for natural riffles adjacent respectively (fig. 4c,e). based on the body length range of indi- viduals detected in this catchment to date, three of the four species appeared likely to pass all of these types of potential instream barrier, particularly p. flu- viatilis and o. mykiss (fig. 4). to each potential barrier (a) (d) discussion managing the effects of alien invasive fishes on native communities has proved problematic, particu- larly in terms of developing proactive plans to limit their spread and establishment (mack et al. 2000; kolar & lodge 2001; kerezsy & fensham 2013). following human-assisted translocations (mack et al. 2000; lintermans 2004; gozlan et al. 2010), invasive animals must overcome a suite of biological and environmental obstacles to successfully invade and establish themselves in new habitats (moyle & light 1996; jackson et al. 2001; peterson & vieglais 2001; waters et al. 2002; johnson et al. 2009). recent studies on locomotor performance (llewelyn et al. 2010; tierney et al. 2011) have helped to explain the (b) (e) (c) (f) 80 fig. 3. distances four alien fish species can swim under maximum usprint performance against flows through potential anthropogenic barriers (a. vertical slot fishway, b. rock-ramp fishway, c. pipe culvert) and natural adjacent riffles (d, e, f respectively) at two river discharge levels (2–3 and 20–30 mlday  1). dashed horizontal lines represent distances fish need to swim at their groundspeed (maximum sprint speed – lowest 25% flow quantile) to pass through each barrier. note five o. mykiss individuals exceeded  1 in sprint swimming speed trials 1.0 ms and may be capable of passing through the vertical slot fishway (a). alien fish invasion risk (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) fig. 4. probability of an alien fish community making passage through four potential instream barriers based on sprint swimming performance.

(2–32 cm tl), the type of structure and level of regulated river discharge. average sprint speeds rang-  1 (up to 44% faster than ing from 0.35 to over 1.0 ms ucrit) across these species were comparable to the flow velocities recorded within natural riffle habitats, such that high levels of passage were predicted for all spe- cies through these natural high-flow stream sections. however, passage success varied widely among artifi- cial structures: the rock-ramp fishway is likely to pro- vide passage to all species except g. holbrooki under all river discharges, versus almost nil passage for fish through the vertical slot fishway (seemingly through a design fault to the fishway entrance), and variable passage through the pipe culvert due to either very high velocities (high discharges) or no water (low dis- charges). the species studied here are representative of the invasive fish species present in the wider region (lintermans 2004), and hence, a large proportion of alien fishes are likely to invade a large upstream sec- tion of the cotter river if they are introduced above the substantial hard barrier of cotter dam (concrete wall 26 m high at time of our study, now raised to 80 m height). have holbrooki, which one way of exploring the veracity of our model predictions is via the varying presence of three of the four study species within the catchment above the oldest and largest barrier of cotter dam. for instance, o. mykiss benefited a century ago from throughout many aus- human-assisted dispersal tralian montane systems, including into the cotter river catchment (around 1890s, lintermans 2004, 2012). following our predictions of high passage probability through all four upstream obstacles, o. mykiss is indeed recorded in all upstream sec- tions of the cotter river upstream of cotter dam to the next substantial fixed barrier (bendora con- crete-arch dam, 47.2 m high, ebner et al. 2007). conversely, g. been recorded upstream of the cotter dam since at least 1970 (lintermans 2012), are seasonally recorded in small numbers in only the first kilometre or two of the river upstream of the cotter reservoir (ebner et al. 2009), suggesting that while they can over- come some natural riffles (fig. 3d-f), anthropogenic barriers upstream of this point (i.e. pipe culvert) may be a limiting factor in their upstream dispersal (fig. 3c). although low water temperatures and pre- dation cannot be ruled out as factors limiting the these species expansion of (ebner et al. 2007), is capable of reaching much higher g. holbrooki elevations (1300 m, lintermans pers. obs.) where water temperatures are colder than the study sites examined here. while further field-based tests of our predictions are hoped to be avoided (and uneth- ical to conduct in the wild), such evidence suggests our reliable predictive models could provide 82 estimates of upstream invasion potential alongside other major risks such as human translocation. (g. holbrooki maximum length aquatic resource managers often have contrasting goals with fish movement throughout catchments: limit the spread of aliens but allow for natural migra- tions of native species. based upon comparisons of sprint swimming performance among the invasive fishes examined here and that of a sympatric, threat- ened fish (macquaria australasica, fig. 2), we find these two goals are likely to be in conflict in this montane river system. using the same methodology as the current study, starrs et al. (2011) found that m. australasica individuals ranging from 8 to 26 cm  1 at 16 °c. tl displayed a mean usprint of 0.72 ms such performance is intermediate to the four alien fish species examined here, being remarkably similar to p. fluviatilis and well below the speed perfor- mance of o. mykiss (especially when considering the  1). five fish whose sprint speed exceeded 1.0 ms only g. holbrooki display swimming speeds below m. australasica, largely due to the marked body size differences of 5.5 cm). as such, flow velocities through a fishway or culvert sufficiently slow to pass a mature mac- quarie perch (>14 cm tl, appleford et al. 1998; starrs et al. 2011; lintermans 2012) will also facili- tate passage of most alien species measured in this study. given that p. fluviatilis is not yet present above the major barrier of cotter dam, our analysis highlights the major invasion risk posed by this species if human translocation placed them into the cotter river upstream of this hard barrier. accord- ingly, intrinsic dispersal evidence can help identify key species of invasion concern for the application of preventative controls on the spread of alien fish spe- cies that can occur via human-assisted introduction into different parts of catchments (mack et al. 2000). the swimming speed performance of a selection of other potential fish invaders of differing body shape and swimming behaviour yields some further insights. for instance, misgurnus anguillicaudatus swims in an anguilliform mode, which is known to produce power- ful acceleration and thrust over short time periods (blake 2004). while one study suggested prolonged  1 for 7 cm individu- swimming speeds of just 0.1 ms als of this species (tsukamoto et al. 1975), a more recent study found 7 cm individuals could ascend  1 flow (munehide et al. pipes against an 0.86 ms 2005). similarly, the climbing galaxias galaxias bre- vipinnis, which has been recorded in a tributary of the murrumbidgee, could also pose a serious invasion risk via their capacity to climb through very steep and/or fast-flowing barriers to invade upland streams of the murray–darling basin (waters et al. 2002). another species of prime concern are cyprinus carpio, which are present immediately below the major barrier of cotter dam, and pose a significant threat based on their detrimental effects and invasive abilities in other rivers and streams (koehn 2004; balcombe et al. 2011). tsukamoto et al. (1975) reported 15 cm tl c.  1 for extended carpio to maintain speeds over 0.8 ms periods, while tudorache et al. (2008) found a ucrit of  1 for 20 cm tl fish. such strong swimming 0.87 ms performance of these species, coupled with an ability to either ‘crawl’ and leave the water (g. brevipinnis, m. anguillicaudatus) or jump (c. carpio, stuart et al. 2006), suggests that it is unlikely flow conditions can be manipulated to exclude these invasive species while allowing passage of native fish such as m. aus- tralasica. instead, alternative proactive methods of limiting passage or are needed, such as targeted trapping of invasive species at key migration points (leprieur et al. 2006; spens et al. 2007). controlling populations swimming speed performance is just one intrinsic measure of invasion rate, and invasion predictions could be enhanced by examining other intrinsic and extrinsic factors. for instance, aspects such as water turbulence and temperature, obstacle morphology and the propensity of species to climb or jump can all affect passage success (hinch et al. 2002; nikora et al. 2003; castro-santos 2004, 2005). behaviour has been repeatedly demonstrated to influence fish passage success at barriers that exhibit steep drops or high-speed flows (hinch et al. 2002; nikora et al. 2003; castro-santos 2004, 2005), where species able to climb or jump have been able to overcome veloc- ity and gradient issues that were otherwise insur- mountable by their direct swimming capacity (e.g. mcdowall 2003; munehide et al. 2005; leonard et al. 2012). turbulence can also hinder or enhance fish passage, depending on the species-specific responses (hinch et al. 2002; nikora et al. 2003; ovidio et al. 2007), which in many cases is linked to their body size relative to the scale of turbulent flow cells (liao 2007). water temperature plays an overar- ching role in all of these effects, with the direct link of thermal conditions to metabolism rate in ectother- mic fish producing up to 10–30% faster swimming speeds in 6–12 °c warmer water for a given species (tudorache et al. 2008; starrs et al. 2011). of course, passage attempt speeds can vary among and within species, with some individuals not using their full swimming potential to overcome a barrier, or trying just once or twice before giving up (castro-santos 2004, 2005). body size is likely to be a key covariate in many of these factors, whereby larger fishes are generally capable of faster swimming speeds and higher/further jumps (castro-santos 2004, 2005). to advance these issues, more data on passage and attempt rates of potential species are needed, with a keen eye to the role of body size and/or age as a alien fish invasion risk covariate to passage success. such measures can be accomplished using constructed replicas of barriers in closed laboratories to avoid problems of possible invasions via escapes from field experiments, while providing crucial information on potential invaders (e.g. castro-santos 2005; tierney et al. 2011). while all of these factors will vary according to the timing of fish migrations (often a factor of a species life history strategy, blake 2004; castro-santos 2005; mallen-cooper & brand 2007), as well as their par- ticular physiology and morphology, these modifying factors deserve consideration in future research to enhance the accuracy of predictive invasion models. conventional tracking of invasive range expan- rates for a species sions may indicate dispersal through a given catchment, but obtaining such rates can be time-consuming, and may not be readily applicable to a wide range of climates, nor provide realistic predictions for other waterways of different hydrology (e.g. hutchison & armstrong 1993). ulti- mately, establishing the intrinsic features that drive the invasion success of a species will provide better tools for resource managers to make effective plans in their approach to the problems of alien species in a changing world (mack et al. 2000; kolar & lodge 2001; gurevitch & padilla 2004; bajer & sorensen 2010). here, we provide the tools for making quanti- tative assessments of invasion risk based on the type of potential barriers and flow conditions within a catchment, relative to the swimming speed perfor- mance of potential invasive fish species. examination of their physiological response to other factors, such as temperature and turbulence, should enhance the predictive capacity of these models when taken into consideration with other potential drivers of invasion success (e.g. ecological niches, human assistance, spawning behaviour; peterson & vieglais 2001; koehn 2004; bajer & sorensen 2010). given rapid changes in the climates and habitats of aquatic ecosystems around the world (vorosmarty et al. 2010; plagany et al. 2011), there is increasing con- cern that alien species may become better established or invade further into non-native habitats following human-assisted range expansions (mack et al. 2000; johnson et al. 2009; balcombe et al. 2011). one proactive targeted research into the physiology and life history of inva- sive species with predictive modelling, can help us target our limited resources towards species of high potential threat to the ecosystem integrity and biodi- versity of a given area of concern. approach, which combines acknowledgements thanks to l. jensen and a. muir for laboratory and field assistance, the staff of act parks,
