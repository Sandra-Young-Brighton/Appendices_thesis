bournemouth, uk accepted for publication july 31, 2015 abstract – niche differentiation facilitates the coexistence of species within a community through avoidance of competition via mechanisms involving spatial, temporal and/or trophic dimensions. where invasive species coexist in their non-native range, niche differentiation could allow their persistence at higher levels of abundance. here, we tested whether there was temporal and/or trophic niche differentiation between two congeneric invasive goby species (rhinogobius cliffordpopei and rhinogobius giurinus) in the sublittoral habitat of lake erhai (south-west china) through quantifying their diel and seasonal rhythm of locomotion activities, feeding activities and diet composition. both species displayed two similar diel peaks in activity and two main feeding periods (6:00–10:00 and 18:00–22:00), with rhythms of locomotion and feeding activity not differing significantly between the species in each season. their diets had a high degree of overlap, being primarily composed of macrozooplankton, aquatic insects and shrimp larvae, with no diel changes across the seasons. thus, in this habitat, there was no clear temporal or trophic niche differentiation between the invasive congeners, indicating their coexistence with high temporal and trophic overlap. in conjunction with data from the littoral and profundal habitats, the gobies revealed different strategies across the habitats (e.g. spatial segregation, trophic niche differentiation) that minimised their competitive interactions and promoted their coexistence. this suggests that the interactions of invasive fishes during the integration into native communities can be context dependent, varying according to factors including habitat and the availability of food resources. key words: gobies; ecological niche; diel activity; feeding rhythm; niche differentiation introduction understanding the mechanisms that allow ecologi- cally similar species to coexist within ecosystems is a central aspect of community ecology (chesson 2000; amarasekare 2003; kylafis & loreau 2011). the competitive exclusion theory predicts that species will eventually out-compete and displace each other when they compete for limited resources (hardin 1960), whereas the niche differentiation theory pre- dicts that other mechanisms, including increased specialisations in resource use that develop as levels of interspecific competition increase, will facilitate their stable coexistence (jones et al. 2001; amarase- kare 2003; kylafis & loreau 2011). when non-native species are introduced into communities, then these mechanisms are integral to determining their out- comes (baiser et al. 2010), such as through influenc- ing their ability to establish abundant populations (lockwood et al. 2005) and then determining their ecological interactions and consequences (woodford et al. 2005; tran et al. 2015). correspondence: j. liu, state key

differentiation involves a spatial axis (habitat), trophic axis (diet), a temporal axis and/ or their combination (chesson 2000; kronfeld-schor & dayan 2003). in heterogeneous environments, the most frequent mechanisms facilitating the coexistence of ecologically similar species involve specialisation in microhabitat use and feeding (jones et al. 2001; amarasekare 2003). the temporal dimension has tended to be overlooked in many studies, despite the- ory suggesting it should mediate ecological interac- tions among competitors through diel and/or seasonal partitioning in resource exploitation (kronfeld-schor & dayan 1999, 2003; kronfeld-schor et al. 2001; richards 2002). thus, even where there is spatial and trophic overlap in niches, diel and seasonal differ- ences in resource exploitation between potential com- petitors could still result in niche differentiation and so facilitate the coexistence of the species (richards 2002; kronfeld-schor & dayan 2003; blanchet et al. 2008). whilst there is now a growing number of studies providing empirical evidence of temporal par- titioning between competing species of ants (albrecht & gotelli 2001), bats (adams & thibault 2006), mice (jones et al. 2001) and birds (veen et al. 2010), there is little supporting evidence from fishes (blan- chet et al. 2008). gobies of the genus rhinogobius (gill 1859) are common benthic fishes in most east asian countries and some areas of south-eastern asia (wu & zhong 2008). rhinogobius giurinus (rutter 1897) and rhinogobius cliffordpopei (nichols 1925), native to japan, and central and south-east china (wu & zhong 2008), were accidentally introduced into sev- lakes in yunnan–guizhou plateau (south-west eral china) in the 1950/1960s and have since spread into neighbouring watersheds (xie et al. 2001; yuan et al. 2010) where they display relatively similar life histo- ries and diet compositions (xie et al. 2000, 2005; zhang 2005). they were introduced into lake erhai in 1961, a 250 km2 lake in the yunnan province of china, and have since become the dominant benthic fish species (du & li 2001). in their native range, r. giurinus is associated with vegetation-free or spar- sely vegetated lentic habitats (xie et al. 2005; li et al. 2010) where r. cliffordpopei occurs only at very low densities. thus, there is no information available about their habitat preferences when the two species co-occur naturally. by contrast, in the littoral and profundal habitats of lake erhai, work has revealed considerable habitat segregation and trophic niche differentiation between them, with highly con- trasting abundances (guo et al. 2012, 2014). in the sublittoral habitat, however, their populations coexist in comparable and moderate abundances, suggesting that this is a mixing or transition zone for the species (guo et al. 2012). consequently, their sublittoral niche differentiation of two invasive gobies populations provide the opportunity to test hypothe- ses on trophic and temporal niche differentiation in two invasive, coexisting and congeneric fishes, and so, the aim here was to (i) quantify their diel and sea- sonal rhythms of locomotion and foraging activities to determine their temporal niches and the extent of their overlap and (ii) identify their diel and seasonal diet compositions to determine their trophic niches and the extent of their overlap within this specific habitat. outputs were then applied to testing the hypothesis that the coexistence of these invasive con- geners was facilitated by diel and seasonal differences in their rhythms of locomotion and feeding activity, and/ or by their trophic (i.e. diel and seasonal differ- ences in diet composition) niche differentiation. materials and methods 0 e, 23°35-58 study area 0 lake erhai (105°5-17 n) is an alpine lake located in yunnan province, south-west china. available habitats for benthic fish species are classi- fied as littoral habitat (water depths <6 m), sublittoral habitat (water depths range 6–12 m) and profundal habitat (water depths ranges 12–20 m). the abun- dance of r. cliffordpopei is highest in the littoral habi- tat, moderate in sublittoral habitat and lowest in profundal habitat, whereas the abundance of r. giuri- nus generally shows the opposite pattern, being also of moderate abundance in the sublittoral (guo et al. 2012). here, the focus is on the sublittoral, charac- terised by the presence of few submerged macro- phytes and a substrate composed of macrophyte detritus and soft mud. in the habitat, the two gobies dominate the fish community and the other fish spe- cies are rare, with species present including pseudo- rasbora parva, hypseleotris swinhonis, hemiculter leucisculus and channa argus (guo et al. 2012). the only piscivorous fish species recorded, c. argus, had abundance littoral their highest (1.46 ind.net  1), very low abundance in the  1day  1) and were absent in sublittoral (0.34 ind. net

same habitats (guo et al. 2012, 2014).  1day in the fish sampling and diet composition rhinogobius giurinus and r. cliffordpopei in the lake were sampled in each season of 2011: spring (april), 43 guo et al. summer (july), autumn (october) and winter (jan- uary). five benthic fyke nets (0.4 cm stretched mesh size) were used on each occasion and were fished over the full 24-h cycle. they were first deployed at 7:00, fished for 2 h, rapidly retrieved, sorted (i.e. all fish removed) and then redeployed approximately 500 m from the last sampling point for a further 2 h. this was repeated until the 24-h cycle had been sam- pled. gobies collected in each of the five nets per 2 h sampling time were identified to species and counted per net before the samples were pooled for that entire 2 h sample, and a random subsample of approximately 30 individuals preserved in 8% forma- lin for 2 weeks before being transferred to 75% ethanol for further analyses. fish larvae, dietary data were generated using gut content anal- yses (gca). the total body length (lt, nearest mm) and body mass (mt, to 0.01 g) were recorded for each preserved specimen (table 1) before the foregut was removed (xie et al. 2000, 2005). all nonempty guts were then weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg, food contents removed and the emptied guts weighed once more so that food weight could be calculated. the food items were identified to the lowest possible tax- onomic level under a dissecting microscope and then were classified into ten categories: macrozooplank- ton, aquatic insects, shrimp larvae, tubificidae, gas- tropoda, fish eggs, ostracoda, plant material and unidentified items. for each food cate- gory, fre- quency of occurrence (%o), percentage of number (%n) and percentage of weight (%w). diet composi- tion was then estimated using the index of relative importance (%iri) using %o, %n and %w (cf. guo et al. 2014). schoener’s index (s) indicated the over- lap in diet between the two species at each diel per- iod and by season (schoener 1970) and was  calculated from: sxy ¼ 1   0:5 , where sxy is the dietary overlap between species x and y, and pxi and pyi are the proportions in number of prey item i in the diet of species x and are the proportions in number of prey item i in the diet of species y, respectively. the values of s range from 0 (indicating no overlap) to 1 (indicating complete overlap), and the following indices were calculated: 1 pxi   pyi p n   values higher than 0.60 indicate high overlap; values between 0.33 and 0.59 indicate moderate overlap, and values lower than 0.33 indicate low overlap. data and statistical analyses  1h the diel and seasonal rhythms of locomotion activity  1) of the were determined using cpue (ind. net benthic fyke nets for each 2-h sampling period. dif- ferences in cpue [log (x + 1) transformed] between species, seasons and sampling periods were tested using three-way anovas. a t-test was then used to test for differences in locomotion activity between the two species in each of the four seasons (i.e. spring, summer, autumn or winter). diel and seasonal rhythms of feeding activity were determined using the vacuity index (vi) and weight of gut content (wgc). for each sampling period, vi was expressed calculated as the proportion (%) of empty guts in the total sample. wgc was calculated as (food weight of nonempty gut/eviscerated weight of the body) 9 100. differences in vi between the two species within the same season were tested using mann–whitney u-tests as there was only one mea- surement of vi for each fish in the same sampling period in each season. note that diel differences in vi between the two species in the same sampling period were not tested. differences in wgc [log (x + 1) transformed] between species, seasons and sampling periods (i.e. each of the 2 h) were tested using three-way anovas. diet composition was quantified using %iri of each of the ten food categories. as sample size on each sampling occasion was occasionally small due to high proportions of empty guts, especially in win- ter, and when the number of guts with food was below 6, then the samples were pooled for further time periods: morning (6:00– analyses into four 11:59 h), afternoon (12:00–17:59 h), early night (18:00–23:59 h) and late night (00:00–5:59 h). thus, the %iri was calculated for each of the four diel time periods and for each season. chi-square tested differ- ences in %iri between species in the same time period and in the same season. table 1. mean (sd) total

differences than r. giurinus in summer 47 guo et al. were observed in winter (t-test, t = 1.26, p = 0.21). given the seasonal changes in day length, the rela- tively stable time-dependency of cpue over seasons suggested that locomotion activity of the two species shifted accordingly, is they were synchronous with seasonal light:dark patterns. that diel and seasonal differences in feeding activity diel vi data indicated that both species had two main periods of feeding activity, with reduced proportions of empty guts from 6:00 to 10:00 and from 18:00 to 22:00 (figs 2 and 3). concomitantly, the wgc was higher during both of these periods (figs 2 and 3). differences in wgc between the two species were not significant (three-way anovas, f1,1432 = 1.59, p = 0.21, table 3), but differences were dependent on seasons and sampling time (three-way anovas, f33,384 = 1.45, p = 0.048, table 3). in each season, the rhythm of feeding activity was similar between the two species, with no significant differences in vi (mann–whitney u-test, p = 0.23, 0.41, 0.72 and 0.96 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respec- tively). in addition, the feeding activities of the two gobies showed a similar seasonal shift with the locomotion activity. differences in diel and seasonal changes of diet composition the diet of the two gobies primarily consisted of macrozooplankton, aquatic insects and shrimp larvae (fig. 4). diet composition (%iri) did not differ sig- nificantly between the two species at the same time period of a day (v2 test, p > 0.05, table 4), and there was a common

evening. their feeding rhythm was closely associated with their activity rhythm, with little evidence for seasonal variation. in combination, this suggests there was no differentiation in the spatial, trophic and tem- poral (diel and seasonal) niches of the two species in the sublittoral habitat, contrary to the hypothesis. in complex and dynamic environments, diel loco- motion activity and feeding rhythm of fishes are highly diverse, varying among species but also among individuals within species (reebs 2002; blanchet et al. 2008). most gobies have been described as primarily nocturnal (thetmeyer 1997; er€os et al. 2005; ehrenberg & ejdung 2008), although variable feeding rhythms between goby spe- cies have been detected (e.g. crepuscular, grabowska & grabowski 2005; nocturnal and crepuscular, kanou et al. 2005; no clear variation in feeding activ- ity within a 24-h periodicity, grabowska et al. 2009). whilst habitat niche differentiation is generally more frequent than trophic and temporal niche differentia- tions (schoener 1974), a review of 37 studies examining habitat, trophic and temporal niche differ- entiation in fish assemblages concluded that 57% of studies found niche differentiation via food partition- ing, 32% via habitat segregation and 11% via time separation (ross 1986). many gobies have been observed to display habitat segregation (e.g. malavasi et al. 2005; sone et al. 2006; hernaman & probert 2008; horinouchi 2008) and/or trophic differentiation (e.g. kakareko et al. 2005; borza et al. 2009; borcherding et al. 2013), whereas we know of no study reporting temporal differentiation among gob- ies, supporting our findings. nevertheless, studies of other fishes have demonstrated that competitive inter- actions between fish species can influence their tem- poral niche (e.g. harwood et al. 2001; blanchet et al. 2008) with, for example, the daytime activity of atlantic salmon salmo_salar significantly increasing when rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss (blanchet et al. 2008). competing with exotic with the sublittoral habitat of the lake appearing to provide a mixing or transition zone for the gobies then their potential diel movements from the neighbouring habitats might have influenced their abundances here and thus influenced their temporal niches. however, given they are benthic species with pelvic fins that form a small sucking plate for attach- ment to the benthos, they tend to have limited capac- ity for quick and long distance swimming (xie et al. 2000; hayden & miner 2009). correspondingly, diel movement across the habitats for feeding would be niche differentiation of two invasive gobies spring 100% spring 100% ) i i r % ( e c n a t r o p m i e v i t a l e r f o x e d n i 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% 100% 80%

appear unlikely. testing this interhabi- tat diel movement would require further study, such as through telemetry approaches. moreover, the den- sity of predator (i.e. c. argus) varies greatly across the different habitats in the lake. the predator pressure is a potential drive for the habitat segrega- tion and the inferior fish growth performance in the littoral habitat with a high abundance of c. argus (guo et al. 2012). within the sublittoral habitat, how- ever, the density of predator is very low, and the predator pressure shows no negative effect on goby growth in relation to those in the profundal habitat where the predator is absent (guo et al. 2012). there- fore, there seems to be no convincing evidences sug- gesting the predator as a determining factor shaping 49 guo et al.

activity and niche differentiation between the two gobies within the sublittoral habitat. when resources are limited, temporal niche differ- entiation could be a viable mechanism for reducing competition, notably when the shared resources also show activity rhythm or are renewed within the time involved in the differentiation (kronfeld-schor & dayan 2003). food supply is often the most important factor driving foraging behaviours and levels of inter- specific competition (al€an€ara et al. 2001; hansen & closs 2005). for instance, letourneur (2000) revealed that the foraging areas and territory sizes of large dom- inant damselfish (stegastes nigricans) were small when food supplies were high in summer but increased when food supplies were low in winter months. in sublittoral habitat of lake erhai, the bio- mass of the two gobies and other ecologically similar fish species (e.g. p. parva, h. swinhonis, h. leuciscu- lus) were much lower than in the littoral and profundal habitats, despite the higher availability of food resources in this habitat (guo et al. 2012). thus, we argue that a potential factor in the lack of niche differ- entiation between the fishes in the sublittoral was through the food resources not being limiting, and thus, competition between all of the fish species was likely to be low. moreover, observations suggested that insect resources, that comprised the main food resources of the two gobies, also did not display clear diel changes the macrozooplankton aquatic and 50 in abundance or renewal patterns, suggesting no requirement for any temporal niche differentiation between the fishes (z. guo, personal observations). invader the present study indicated that the two species did not show any diel changes in diet composition and no trophic niche differentiation within the sublit- toral. both species mainly consumed cladocera and copepod species of zooplankton and chironomid lar- vae, as also observed in the littoral and profundal habitats (guo et al. 2014), as well as in lentic popula- tions in their native range (xie et al. 2000, 2005; zhang 2005). specialisation in food resource is often crucial to enhance coexistence by reducing interspeci- fic competition among closed-related competing fish species, and several invasive gobies have been found to display trophic niche differentiation within a com- munity when they become abundant outside of their native ranges (e.g. kakareko et al. 2005; borza et al. 2009; borcherding et al. 2013). success depends, in part, on the availability of ‘niche oppor- tunities’ and ‘resource opportunities’ (shea & ches- son 2002). in lake erhai, we demonstrated that the two invasive and highly abundant gobies displayed a multistrategy across different habitats to maximise the ‘opportunities’ and to minimise competition between them. firstly, they occupied distinct macro- habitats with spatial segregation, which was the pri- mary mechanism that promoted their resource partitioning and their coexistence at high abundances within the littoral and profundal habitats of the lake (guo et al. 2012). in the sublittoral, however, their shared niches indicated no trophic or temporal differ- entiation, potentially due to abundant food resources, and the two species were able to coexist at similar abundances, albeit reduced from those recorded in the other habitats (guo et al. 2014). in its entirety, the coexistence of the two species in this habitat may just represent a by-product of their successful segre- gation along the depth gradient of the lake. these findings suggest that the integration into native fish communities of invasive gobies specifically, and invasive fish generally, represents relatively complex processes involving the interactions of ecological mechanisms and the physical environment, with some context dependency in their outcomes (shea & ches- son 2002; baiser et al. 2010). in conclusion, this study demonstrated that these two invasive gobies species were primarily nocturnal with crepuscular peaks in activity and feeding. as their diel rhythms of activity and feeding were also similar across the four seasons, this suggested there was no differentiation in their temporal niche. more- over, their high dietary overlap revealed no evidence of trophic niche differentiation within the sublittoral habitat. thus, these findings, that were contrary to the hypothesis (i.e. the coexistence of these invasive congeners was facilitated by the differences in their rhythms of locomotion and feeding activity, and/ or by their trophic niche), suggest that other ecological mechanisms were facilitating their coexistence at sim- ilar abundances in this habitat, with evidence suggest- ing this related to their access to sufficiently high food resources that prevented the development of competitive interactions. acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national natu- ral science foundation of
