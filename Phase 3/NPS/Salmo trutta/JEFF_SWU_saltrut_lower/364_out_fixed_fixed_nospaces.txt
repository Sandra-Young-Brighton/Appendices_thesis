e-mail: lionel.launois@cemagref.fr accepted for publication october 12, 2010 introduction integrity of frey (1977) and then karr & dudley (1981) deﬁned the concept of ecological freshwater ecosystems as their ability to support and maintain ‘a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organ- isms having a species composition diversity and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region.’ since this publication, ﬁsh assemblages have become accepted as reﬂecting the ‘overall integrity of biological communities’ and as ‘excellent indicators of the environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems’ (fausch et al. 1990). following karr’s studies on midwestern u.s. streams, many other multi-metric ﬁsh-based indices of biotic integrity (ibis) have been developed for the running waters of north and central america, and europe (miller et al. 1988; simon & lyons 1995; hughes & oberdorff 1999; roset et al. 2007). conversely, ibis for the development of lakes remains scarce (appelberg et al. 2000; drake & pereira 2002). the main difﬁculty hampering this development was heterogeneity in ﬁsh sampling (jackson & harvey 1997). even scarcer are the attempts to assess the quality of reservoirs using ﬁsh assemblages (but see hickman and mcdonough 1996; jennings et al. 1995) despite their importance for water resource managers (jennings et al. 1995). one reason put forward was that reservoirs are artiﬁcial systems that lack natural reference sites to assess the deviation from unaffected natural conditions (hick- man & mcdonough 1996; jennings et al. 1995). in europe, the implementation of the european water framework directive (wfd) (european com- munity 2000) requires the use of ﬁsh-based tools to assess the ecological status of all lentic water bodies, i.e., natural lakes and reservoirs, over 50 ha. the ﬁrst multi-metric index for lake ﬁsh was developed in 120 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00467.x response of ﬁsh-based metrics to human pressures in french lakes sweden (appelberg et al. 2000; holmgren et al. 2007). however, completed ﬁsh-based indices still remain rare and concern almost solely natural lakes. moreover, they generally focus on speciﬁc types of environments (e.g., mountain or wetland lakes), and they are often based on taxonomic metrics, which are poorly transferable because of limited ﬁsh species distribution areas. in this context, the development of methods for monitoring the biological responses of ﬁsh assemblages to natural and anthropogenic factors is essential and remains to be improved. this is particularly true in some countries (e.g., france, spain, portugal, the czech republic) where most lakes are man-made. reservoirs are frequently considered as an interme- diate between rivers and lakes (gelwick & matthews 1990; wetzel 1990; irz et al. 2006); however, biolog- ical cross-ecosystem studies are currently not common (pace 1991). nevertheless, reservoirs satisfy some of the deﬁnition criteria of lakes (politou et al. 1993), because most of the major processes (e.g., internal mixing, nutrient uptake, predator–prey interactions) occur in both natural lakes and reservoirs (thornton 1990). currently, the question of whether a common ﬁsh-based index could be used for both lentic ecosystems has been raised. therefore, the goals of this study were (i) to test whether some candidate metrics, including functional metrics, are correlated with anthropogenic pressure gradients when the environment is controlled for in each type of lentic ecosystem and (ii) to compare the selected metrics between natural lakes and reservoirs. study sites throughout this article, we refer to lakes of natural origin as natural lakes and to man-made lentic systems as reservoirs; the generic term ‘lakes’ is used for both types. only freshwater lakes are included in this study. anthropogenic pressure indices were computed lakes and 106 reservoirs located using 40 natural throughout france. fish data were collected from 30 natural lakes and 59 reservoirs among these 146 lakes (fig. 1). the lake data set represented a wide range of each environmental condition (table 1), but as dem- onstrated in previous works on french lakes (argillier et al. 2002b; irz et al. 2002, 2004a), sites with altitudes over 1500 m above sea level had to be excluded from these analyses because they shelter only introduced ﬁsh species. material and methods environmental parameters five large-scale environmental parameters related to lake and drainage basin morphology, and known to affect the distribution patterns of ﬁsh assemblages, were considered (table 1). the lake area (al) is a strong predictor of ﬁsh richness (barbour & brown fig. 1. location of the 89 study sites in the french hydrographic network. e natural lakes ¤ reservoirs. 121 launois et al. table 1. environmental parameter mean values and extreme values of the 89 study sites. parameter geological index (gi) (% of the drainage basin as calcareous) residence time (rt) (day) water-level maximal amplitude (wl)* catchment area (adb) (km2) lake area (al) (ha) maximum depth (dmax) (m) shoreline development factor (sldf)  t°c mean jan + t°c mean jul (sumt) t°c mean jul ) t°c mean jan (difft) volume development (vd)à *3 classes: 0 (no variation), 1 (£3 m), 2 (>3 m).  calculated as: perimeter ⁄ (ö4p · surface). àcalculated as: 3 · lake volume ⁄ (maximum depth · lake area). reservoirs (n = 59) natural lakes (n = 30) mean 0.26 137.09 1.53 662.23 251.00 23.87 3.34 23.86 15.97 1.21 range 0–1 0.11–922.80 0–2 8.42–10533.34 44–2272 2–100 1.01–9.20 15.49–31.27 10.43–19.42 0.37–2.96 mean 0.38 692.08 0.45 152.80 781.00 23.13 1.62 20.44 17.19 1.42 range 0–1 5–5095 0–2 1.25–1033.34 13–5768 2–110 1.01–3.80 13.18–31.51 13.48–19.91 0.30–2.66 1974; eadie & keast 1984); the drainage basin area (adb) is an indicator of habitat diversity upstream of lake and of inﬂows into lakes (irz et al. 2004b); the maximum depth (dmax) acts both directly on ﬁsh habitat availability by determining the importance of the lake littoral zone (argillier et al. 2002c) and indirectly on the lake-water-dissolved oxygen level (hondzo & stefan 1996); the lake shoreline develop- ment factor (sldf) (eadie & keast 1984) accounts for an indicator of habitat diversity in lakes; and the volume development (ha˚kanson 1981) gives information on the lake basin shape and therefore on the size of the lake littoral zone. the aurelhy climate model (benichou & le breton 1987) was used to compute january and july mean air temperatures because air temperatures are known to control the distribution of ﬁsh species (daufresne & boet 2007; irz et al. 2007b; mason et al. 2008) by affecting the metabolism (gillet 1991) and the growth of juveniles (jensen 1990; staggs & otis 1996) (sumt; difft; see table 1). the hydrological model developed by pella et al. (2006) was used to evaluate the lake yearly (vd) inﬂow to calculate residence time (rt). a geological index (gi) displaying the percentage of the catchment area as calcareous, based on 1 ⁄ 50,000 geological maps (brgm: http://www.brgm.fr/cartegeol.jsp), was com- puted on the whole-lake catchment area. this gi enables us to understand lake catchment chemistry, which is an important factor affecting ﬁsh abundance (shaw et al. 2004). finally, the water-level maximum amplitude (wl) was considered as an additional hydrological parameter, because of its detrimental effect on ﬁsh feeding conditions, sheltering and reproduction (bragg et al. 2003; winﬁeld 2004). anthropogenic pressures anthropogenic pressures were assessed for the overall french lake data set (n = 146) using seven variables derived from features of the lakes’ catchments (table 2). land cover percentages allow the evalua- tion of the agricultural and urban land use (drake & pereira 2002). population density relates to the watershed dynamic, especially chemical discharges table 2. description of the anthropogenic variables included in the analysis; and principal component analysis (pca) carried out on the

into lakes (see pitt et al. 1995). the network density of roads and railways reﬂects fragmentation (forman & alexander 1998; jones et al. 2000). the soil surface nitrogen balance and phosphorus balance were simu- lated using the nopolu system 2 model (po¨ yry) (g. legall, personal communication). these are the differences between the total quantity of nutrients entering the soil and the quantity of those leaving it annually. the nitrogen balance was kept as a pressure variable, but the phosphorus balance was adjusted according to the recommendation of coale (2000). as particulate phosphorus is not very mobile (carpenter et al. 1998), coale proposed to multiply the phospho- rus balance by the mean value of the lake’s watershed soil erosion after log transformation [log(x + 1)]. this watershed soil erosion was estimated with a model developed by the french national institute for agri- cultural research (inra – ifen – gis sol, 2000 – http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdb_archive/serae/ grimm/erosion/inra/europe/analysis/maps_and_listings/ web_erosion/index.html). this model is based on soil slumping, erodibility, topography, land cover, rainfalls and dominant cultivated land cover. we assume that these seven variables derived from gis data reﬂected the anthropogenic pressures under- gone by lakes at the catchment scale. the population density and agricultural land cover were log-trans- formed [log(x + 1)], and the percentage of the urban- ised catchment area was transformed to arcsineö(x). the other four anthropogenic variables were kept raw. to reduce dimensionality, a standardised principal component analysis (pca) was performed on each group of anthropogenic variables (table 2). on the one hand, we carried out a pca on urban variables, and lake coordinates on the ﬁrst principal component were considered a synthetic urban pressure variable (pu). the same was carried out on agricultural variables to create a synthetic agricultural pressure variable (pa). fish sampling procedures implemented during summer fish data for the 89 french lakes were collected between 2005 and 2009 using a standardised method (c.e.n. 2005). a stratiﬁed random sampling scheme was (june–october, surface water temperature over 15 °c). the sampled lakes were divided into depth strata, and randomly located samplings were performed within each depth stratum. both pelagic and benthic multi-mesh gillnets made out of uncoloured nylon were used. benthic nets were 30 m long and 1.5 m deep and composed of 12 different mesh sizes (the panel for each mesh size was 2.5 m long) ranging between 5 and 55 mm following geometry series, with an approximately 1.25 ratio between mesh sizes. the pelagic nets were 27.5 m species relative for long and 6 m high and had the same mesh sizes without the 5-mm mesh size. the number of nets increased with lake depth and area. nets were set around 7 pm for approximately 12 h. fish were identiﬁed to species and counted. this method provides the number of ﬁsh that were caught and the biomass for each one. we then calculated a whole-lake estimate (ra), expressed as the ratio of the number of individuals belonging to a ﬁsh species to the total number of individuals in the lake; catch per unit effort (cpue); and biomass (in grams) per unit effort (bpue) (including both the benthic and the pelagic nets), respectively, expressed as the overall number of individuals or biomass captured divided by the unit of effort (i.e., nets’ surfaces multiplied by the sampling duration). finally, this method provided ﬁsh data that were comparable over time within a lake and between lakes. abundances candidate metrics altogether, 42 species were caught in these 89 lakes (table 3). ten biological traits (table 4) derived from func- tional guilds were used: two from tolerance guilds [overall tolerant (otol) and overall intolerant (ointol)], three from reproductive guilds [lithophilic species (lith), strict lithophilic species (stlith) and strict phytophilic species (stphyto)], and ﬁve from trophic guilds [omnivorous (omni), invertivorous (invert), planktivorous (plankt), herbivorous (herb) and pisciv- orous species (pisc)]. the 42 ﬁsh species caught were assigned to these attributes (appendix s1), based on previous grey or published literature, online resources (froese & pauly 2009 – http://www.ﬁshbase.org/; pont et al. 2006) or expert judgments (h. persat, o. schlumberger & n. poulet, personal communica- tions). in addition, native species (nat) were distin- guished using keith & allardi’s (2001) classiﬁcation. a set of candidate metrics was derived from species richness and faunal composition as in other lake and stream ibis (drake & pereira 2002; holmgren et al. 2007; karr et al. 1986; minns et al. 1994; schulz et al. 1999). these metrics (table 5) were expressed as (i) number of species sharing a trait (ii) number of species sharing a trait divided by the total number of species in the lake (%sp_trait), (iii) number of individuals sharing a trait caught by unit effort (nb_trait), (iv) number of individuals sharing a trait divided by the total number of individuals in the lake (%nb_trait), (v) biomass of individuals sharing a trait caught by unit effort (b_trait) or (vi) biomass of individuals sharing a trait divided by the total biomass individuals in the lake (%b_trait). the total of species richness (rs) metric was calculated, and three (sp_trait), 123 launois et al. table 3. occurrence rates of the 42 ﬁsh species in

all functional ﬁsh traits considered here are shared by at least three species. moreover, as in other studies (jennings et al. 1995; irz et al. 2007a; pont et al. 2007), introduced species were not excluded from the metric calculations because they may play an impor- tant functional role in lake ecosystems. this set of metrics reﬂects complementary aspects of assemblage richness and functioning.

selected on the basis of the root mean square error (rmse) using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (loo). all statistical analyses were performed using r statistical software (r.2.9.1) as well as ‘vegan’, ‘pls’ and ‘caret’ r packages (ihaka & gentleman 1996; r development core team 2008). results study sites and environmental parameters lakes are located either in this study, natural in mountain areas (e.g., the alps, the massif central) or next to the coast (fig. 1). on the contrary, reservoirs are roughly randomly spread throughout france. the mean values of most environmental parameters are lakes and reservoirs, quite similar between natural lakes have larger rt (692 vs. although natural t-test with welch correction, 137 days) (student t = 2.16, p < 0.05) (table 1), lower sldf (with t = )6.83, p < 0.001), welch correction, smaller catchment areas (t = )3.29, p < 0.001) and lower water-level ﬂuctuations (t = )7.53, p < 0.001) than reservoirs. differences between lake types are clearer with respect to anthropogenic pressures (table 2). apart from network densities and urbanised areas, all anthropogenic pressures displayed higher mean values for artiﬁcial lakes than for natural ones. for natural lakes, the negative nutrient balances indicate a deﬁcit of nutrients in the soil surface of the catchment, whereas their highly positive values for reservoirs show a nutrient accumulation. in addition, all agricul- tural variables reached higher maximum values for reservoirs than for natural lakes – more than twice as much. for example, reservoirs have higher maximum values of agricultural land cover areas (8783.4 vs. 790.6 km2) and nutrient balances [877.1 t(n) vs. 432.3 t(n), and 2523.1 t(p) vs. 849.2 t(p)] than natural lakes. in summary, reservoirs undergo much more agricul- tural pressure than natural lakes do. fish sampling and candidate metrics lakes and reservoirs are very similar in terms of common and rare species (table 3). indeed, 68% of the ﬁsh species occur in both types of ecosystems. in lakes and reservoirs, perca ﬂuviatilis both natural (linnaeus, 1758), rutilus rutilus (l., 1758) and scardinius erythrophthalmus (l., 1758) were wide- spread (more than two-thirds of the sampling sites) and had a high mean ra (>5% in at least one of two types). in addition, ﬁsh species with low occupancy (<10% of the sampling sites) and poor average ra (<1% in at least one of the system types) were nearly the same as well (table 3). on the contrary, we (‡25% in frequency) observed clear differences 125 launois et al. * ) 1 2 . 0 ( 5 1 .

(l., 1758) and coregonus_lavaretus (l., 1758) (table 3). all of them, except the last one, were more frequent in reservoirs than in natural lakes. the functional ﬁsh-based metrics also indicated similarities between lake types (student’s t- test, with welch correction if needed, see table 5). most of strict lithophilic, overall, 11 out of 73 candidate ﬁsh metrics response to anthropogenic displayed a signiﬁcant pressures (table 6). none of the metrics based on the lithophilic, intolerance and invertivorous traits displayed a signiﬁcant response. moreover, anthropogenic impacts do not appear signiﬁcant on species richness or on diversity indices. in addition, none of the candidate metrics indicated a signiﬁcant anthropogenic impact on both natural lakes and reservoirs. three metrics displayed a signiﬁcant response to anthropogenic pressures in natural lakes (table 6). %b_otol increases with urbanisation stress (30% of the variance explained). nb_stphyto and %b_plankt seem to be good indicators of agricultural impacts (table 6) (20% and 17% of variance, respectively, explained exclusively by agricultural pressure). for the reservoirs, eight metrics were selected, including bpue (table 6). five of them relate to assemblage trophic structure and two to tolerance guild metrics (sp_otol and b_otol). the only type of pressure signiﬁcantly contributing to the model was pa (table 6). apart from the percentage of piscivo- rous species, the other seven metrics displayed a positive response to the agricultural pressure when the environment was controlled for. the metric %sp_pisc showed the strongest its variance attributed to pa. b_herb and %sp_plankt came next with 13% and 12%, respectively. response with 17% of all linear models included at least one signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for environmental variables (unpublished results). this highlights the importance of accounting for the environmental patterns of variability when studying the response of ﬁsh-based metrics to anthro- pogenic pressures at broad spatial scales. for the natural the %b_plankt and %b_otol (table 6), with 28% and 27%, their variance attributed to environmental variables. for

although both natural lakes and reservoirs meet the generic deﬁnition of lakes (politou et al. 1993), they clearly differ in terms of morphological characteristics, functioning [e.g., water-level ﬂuctuation (table 1)] and anthropo- genic pressures (thornton 1990; cooke et al. 1993). reservoirs undergo much more agricultural pressures than natural lakes do certainly because the storage of water in artiﬁcial lakes favours the development of irrigation. assessing lake conditions through ﬁsh assemblages the present study provides evidence that ﬁsh assem- blages are good potential indicators of urban and agricultural impacts on lakes. eleven metrics (among the initial set of 73) responded to the lake catchment pressures when the environment was controlled for. most of the selected metrics responded to agricul- tural pressures. this prevailing effect of agriculture versus urban land use can be explained by the differences in intensity of these two pressures. the mean percentage of agricultural land cover in catch- ments exceeds by one order of magnitude that of urban land use (table 2). the building of treatment plants for domestic and industrial sewage certainly contributed to mitigate the impact of urban land use on freshwater ecosystems. conversely, agriculture is still a major user of fertilisers and pesticides, and it contributes to soil erosion. in this context, the prominent effect of agriculture on freshwater assemblages is not really surprising, even though the processes involved remain unclear. direct impacts (e.g., by toxicity) are certainly less important than those explained by habitat alter- ation or eutrophication. finally, there is also more variability in agricultural than in urban land cover (synthesised by higher sd, see table 2), which may explain a clearer response of ﬁsh-based metrics. moreover, in the present study, the urbanisation of catchments was very low compared to that in other studies (whittier 1999; drake & pereira 2002). in addition, the lack of signiﬁcance might also be attributable to the fact that these relationships between metrics and pressures are actually nonlinear, which was not considered here. metrics might indeed be, for example, sensitive to a given pressure above a certain threshold. regarding natural lakes, only three metrics displayed a signiﬁcant response to anthropogenic pressures (table 6). this is less than for reservoirs, which may be explained by the above-mentioned differences in the agricultural pressure between natural lakes and reser- voirs. furthermore, we have to acknowledge that the number of natural lakes included in the present study and the variability between these lakes (i.e., coastal to mountain lakes) may limit the possibility of identifying certain relevant metrics. nevertheless, considering the low number (<70) of french natural lakes over 50 ha, this exercise will remain difﬁcult at a national scale, whatever the sampling method used. at the european level, similar tests would be more powerful. finally, it is obvious that ﬁsh management practices can inﬂuence ﬁsh species composition and abundance (argillier et al. 2002a). however, in this study, ﬁsh species were considered self-sustaining. indeed, all species are not stocked, and when they are, according to our knowledge of local management practices, this is infrequent. furthermore, even if none of the lakes studied was concerned with commercial ﬁshing, we cannot exclude bias in our metric calculations (i.e., metrics related to the abundance of piscivores and salmonids) because of intensive recreational angling. fish-based metric responses on both lentic ecosystems for planktivorous species, for example, agriculture has a signiﬁcant effect on %b_plankt for natural lakes and on %sp_plankt for reservoirs (table 6), but no metric revealed a common response to a pressure on both natural lakes and reservoirs. 127 launois et al. the selected ﬁsh-based metrics only ﬁsh-related metrics based on tolerance, repro- duction and trophic guilds were retained in this study. the tolerance-related metrics seemed to display clear responses to anthropogenic pressures both on reser- voirs and on natural lakes. most ibis developed on rivers (oberdorff et al. 2002; pont et al. 2006), reservoirs (karr & dionne 1991; mcdonough & hickman 1999) or natural lakes (belpaire et al. 2000; drake & pereira 2002) use some measure of the relative dominance of tolerant species to assess moderate to high levels of degradation (simon & lyons 1995). nevertheless, as discussed previously, the metric units of the selected tolerance-related lakes and metrics were different between natural reservoirs. moreover, that 5 of 11 intolerant species are salmonids (see appendix s1), and they likely occupy mainly the coldwater lakes located above 1500 m that were excluded from our analyses. in spite of the absence of response of intolerant species-based metrics, most of our results conﬁrm the value of tolerance-related metrics. is apparent it it is acknowledged that apart from the proportion of piscivorous species, all trophic-based metrics displayed signiﬁcantly other positive relationships with agricultural pressure, among both types of lakes. all six trophic-based metrics selected in this study responded similar to those found in other ibi adaptation studies (karr & dionne 1991; jennings et al. 1995; appelberg et al. 2000; drake & pereira 2002). in contrast to temperate stream ecosystems, lentic ecosystems are considered more stable from an environmental point of view, thereby promoting intra-assemblage interactions (e.g., competition, pre- dation) and giving rise to trophically structured assemblages (hugueny & paugy 1995; oberdorff et al. 1998; iban˜ez et al. 2009). hence, studying the response of to anthropogenic pressures in lentic ecosystems was useful, while nutrient loadings induced by agricultural land use could probably modify the equilibrium between the different trophic levels (carpenter et al. 1985; vitousek et al. 1997). the trophic composition metrics among the metric based on reproductive guilds, nb_stphyto was the only one that showed a signif- icant response to agricultural pressure; this was observed only for natural lakes (table 6). candidate metrics displaying no response species richness was not correlated with catchment- scale anthropogenic pressures. this is congruent with previous results (irz et al. 2007a). various responses were reported for it can increase as a result of eutrophication (dodson et al. this metric. 128 2000; mittelbach et al. 2001) or species introduction (irz et al. 2004a) but decrease as a result of the extirpation of habitat-sensitive taxa (corbacho & sanchez 2001). the three diversity indices were not either corre- lated with anthropogenic factors. these indices have rarely been used in ﬁsh index development, probably because they are highly correlated with each other and because the information they provide is difﬁcult to interpret (holmgren et al. 2007). in addition, zoogeo- graphical factors (e.g., postglacial dispersal, hydro- graphic regions and ph) for explaining species richness and diversity indices have not been considered in this analysis (grifﬁths 1997; irz et al. 2004a). relevant despite a strong negative relationship between the native-related metrics and anthropogenic pressures observed in other studies (e.g., jennings et al. 1999), this association was not detected. however, the species driving this relation in the french data set were in the majority r. rutilus (l., 1758), p. ﬂuviatilis (l., 1758), blicca bjoerkna (l., 1758) and a. brama (l., 1758). these species are overall tolerant as regards degraded lake conditions. hence, the selection of a ﬁsh species able to respond, depending on the biological trait that is studied, in both directions to degraded lake conditions explains why the response of those candidate metrics could be concealed in our study. the same explanation can be advanced to account relationships between agricultural or urban pressure and ﬁsh-based metrics related to lithophilic, strict lithophilic and invertivo- rous species. the absence of for in addition, the near absence of reproduction-related metric responses highlighted by this study may be the result of the poor relevance or the deﬁciency of the lake descriptors considered. it is commonly accepted that both local and large-scale processes inﬂuence local ﬁsh assemblages in lakes (irz et al. 2007a,b; petesse et al. 2007). in this study, only large-scale pressures were considered, and more relevant descrip- tors of habitat and hydromorphological alteration have to be collected; further studies will then be required to better understand the inﬂuence of regional versus local anthropogenic pressures on ﬁsh assemblages (irz et al. 2007a). finally, the relationship between intolerant species- related metrics and anthropogenic pressures can be concealed, as reported by irz et al. (2007a), because ‘a species could be considered as intolerant in some regions where it is restricted to some particular type of environment, and tolerant in another region where it is widespread.’ however, in this study, we can note that, apart from gobio gobio (l., 1758), all other ﬁsh species driving that relation had either low occupancy (<3% of the sampling sites) or poor average ra (<1% response of ﬁsh-based metrics to human pressures in french lakes in at least one of both types). consequently, intolerant species-related metrics displayed a very narrow range of variance, thus explaining their lack of response to anthropogenic pressures. additional work is needed, and as suggested by berrebi dit thomas et al. (1998) and whittier et al. (2007), metrics based on biological traits that are the expression of specialised attributes (e.g., invertivores, lithophilic) should be calculated without considering overall tolerant ﬁsh species. indeed, this modiﬁcation may prevent the sensitivity of a speciﬁc biological parameter the heterogeneity of the ﬁsh species contributing to the calculation of the ﬁsh-based metric. from being concealed because of multiple testing no corrections were made for multiple testing. we are aware of the increasing risk of false positive. however, there is much true dependence between the metrics tested because they are based on guild composed by partly the same species and for a given guild six metrics are based on the same species but measured differently. in short, because of this dependence, the true number of effective testing must be largely fewer than the number of metrics considered (cheverud 2001). nevertheless, much attention must be paid to the levels of signiﬁcance. conclusion this study indicates that ﬁsh assemblages are appro- priate ecological indicators for both natural and artiﬁcial lakes. our results underline the necessity to control for the environment when developing fbis at broad geographical scales. they also prove that the relevant metrics differ between natural lakes and for reservoirs. this challenges the attempts to use natural systems as references to assess the ecological potential of artiﬁcial ones. acknowledgements the authors thank h. persat (cnrs), n. poulet (onema), o. schlumberger (ministe`re de l’agriculture et de la peˆche)
