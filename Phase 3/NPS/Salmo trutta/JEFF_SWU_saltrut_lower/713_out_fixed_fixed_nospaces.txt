somatic growth; otolith; scales; amplified fragment length polymorphism introduction growth in fish is highly dependent on temperature (elliott 1976a,b), and a large number of studies have demonstrated adaptations to local temperature condi- tions both in marine and freshwater environments (haugen & vøllestad 2000; jensen et al. 2008; san- ford & kelly 2011). brown_trout occur from lowland to high mountain areas, experiencing a wide range of habitat conditions and temperature regimes. local adaptations to the prevailing thermal conditions are therefore expected, and genetic variation in growth- related traits among populations is likely to arise as a result temperature adaptation processes (e.g. haugen & vøllestad 2000; jensen from these potential et al. 2008). with maximum rations, brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) may have an optimum growth at temperature around 13 °c (elliott 1975). in alpine areas in norway, however, long winters with ice-cov- ered lakes and much snow prevail, and the short open-water season, combined with low temperatures, may highly affect annual growth of brown_trout in such areas (borgstrøm 2001; borgstrøm & museth 2005). stocking of non-native individuals, with the aim of establishing new populations or improving fish recruitment for harvesting, has been a common practice interbreeding between introduced and native individuals is well documented (hansen & mensberg 2009), but the long-term outcome from such introgression into in these mountain areas. correspondence: j. thaulow, norwegian institute for water research, gaustadalleen 21, n-0349 oslo, norway. e-mail: jens.thaulow@gmail.com doi: 10.1111/eff.12250 53 thaulow et al. native populations is not easily predicted, and represents a situation where gene flow and natural selection act in concert (hansen 2002). the result from these interacting processes may impact the native population’s local adaptation (e.g. gilk et al. 2004; mcginnity et al. 2009; skaala et al. 2012). estimation of age structure and individual growth in fish populations has been an essential component in the study of population dynamics in both marine and freshwater species (francis 1990; morita & mat- suishi 2001; francis & campana 2004). accuracy and precision of scale-based ageing have been shown to decline after sexual maturity and are therefore most applicable for immature individuals (alvord 1954; jonsson 1976). in contrast, otoliths continue to grow throughout the entire lifetime of an individual (campana & neilson 1985) irrespective of somatic growth (nordeng 1961; aass 1972 wright et al. 1990), but with decreasing annual increments as age increases (e.g. black et al. 2005; weisberg et al. 2010; stocks et al. 2011). otoliths are therefore con- sidered the most accurate structure for age determina- tion (jonsson 1976; burnham-curtis & bronte 1996; buckmeier et al. 2012). however, most studies addressing the decoupling of somatic growth and oto- lith growth have been restricted to larval and juvenile fishes under artificial conditions and on relatively short in duration (mosegaard et al. 1988; secor & dean 1989; wright et al. 2001; fey 2006). timescales, most often <1 year in this study, we take advantage of an alpine brown_trout system where three headwater lakes comprise populations established by stocking of individuals of unknown, but nonlocal origin. downstream lakes hold original populations that have experienced gene flow from the headwater populations to varying degrees (sønstebø et al. 2008). this system therefore offers conditions for comparing otolith and scale growth in populations with different genetic backgrounds and the effect of a possible gene flow on thermal effects on these ageing structures. brown_trout in this alpine area reach ages between 30 and 40 years (svalastog 1991), but as seen elsewhere, may stagnate in growth after maturation, especially in dense populations (jen- sen 1977; borgstrøm 1994; wootton 1999). the objective of the study was to explore the ther- mal responses in two growth-increment traits (otoliths and scales) of brown_trout from introduced and native populations. the two growth increment traits are expected to show differentiated thermal responses. in general, scale growth stagnates after maturation in dense populations, while otoliths continue to grow and form annuli irrespective of somatic growth stag- nation of the fish (e.g. nordeng 1961). furthermore, otolith growth has been shown to correlate with sum- mer temperature, and possibly other environmental 54 factors, irrespective of age (black et al. 2005, 2013). however, as all the studied brown_trout populations live in suboptimum temperature conditions with short growth seasons, we expect natural selection to be strong and, hence, prevail over genetic drift and gene flow so as to favour converging thermal growth-in- crement responses among populations. materials and methods study area and population characteristics all six lakes included in the study are located in the upper reaches of the river kvenna watercourse on the hardangervidda mountain plateau, at alti- tudes from 1167 to 1282 m above sea level (asl) (table 1; fig. 1a). the lakes are ice-covered from october–november to june–july, with large varia- tions in ice break-up time among years, but always starting first lake. april snow depth in the area varies annually between less than one metre to more than three metres, and the ice break-up is highly dependent on the spring snow depth, as shown for the lake litlosvatn (borgstrøm 2001). all lakes are relatively shallow, with litlos- vatn being the deepest (about 25-m maximum depth; table 1). in the lowermost brown_trout is the only fish species present in the studied lakes and has been present on the hardan- gervidda mountain plateau for as much as 6500 year (indrelid 1985). the brown_trout populations in the three downstream-connected lakes, kollsvatn (kol), litlosvatn (lit) and kvennsjøen (kve), most likely represent populations of these original fish, which have not been stocked in modern times, and are only influenced by downstream migration from the head- water lakes (sønstebø et al. 2008). as part of a popu- lation assessment study, kol brown_trout individuals were tagged during 1988 and 1989. individuals from this kol tagging programme were recaptured in lit during july–august 1993, clearly demonstrating downstream migration to occur between these lakes. based on original tagging numbers and the number of recaptures, more than 700 individuals from the 1988– 1989 population in kol may still have been present in lit in 1993. the populations in the three headwater lakes krokavatn (kro), skavatn (ska) and nedre vassdalsvatn (nvv) are, on the other hand, isolated by impassable upstream waterfalls (fig. 1a). brown_trout populations were therefore established in these headwater lakes by two stocking episodes in kro and ska during the 1930s (tomas sekse, previous leader of the local mountain board, pers. comm.), and in mid 1940s in nvv (jakob j. eitrheim, participated in the stocking, pers. comm.), with fish of nonlocal, but unknown origin. however, according to jakob j. analyses/amplified table 1. number (n) of brown_trout used in the length biological polymorphism population abbreviation, available), altitude, area, maximum depth and stocking history of the sampled lakes.

(c) frequency of 110 immature (grey bars) and mature (black bars) female brown_trout from lake kollsvatn with ages 3–15 winters (age class 9 is only represented by two individuals). the individuals were sampled in the years 2009–2012. eitrheim (pers. comm.), it is very likely that the nvv population was founded by broodstock from a lowland population. ska was restocked in 1974 and 1982, also using fish of nonlocal and unknown origin. according to local fishermen, individuals larger than two kg were common in all six populations dur- ing the 1950–1960s (jakob h. eitrheim and the late ingvald n. øvregard, pers. comm.). natural recruit- ment to the populations varies, with several weak or missing year classes during the last decades, while others have been exceptionally strong (borgstrøm & museth 2005). this variation in annual recruitment is most in summer temperatures and snow conditions (borgstrøm & museth 2005). according to gillnet catches in july likely governed by variations 2003–2004, the strong year classes 1997 and 1999 doubled the population density in most of the lakes compared to densities in july 1989–1993 (unpub- lished, own data). due to the strong year classes, all populations have been dense during the last years, as indicated by high catch per unit effort by gillnets, and relatively small individual size of captured indi- viduals (unpublished, own data). water temperature temperatures (1 july–15 annual mean summer september) for the years 2004–2008 were recorded by temperature loggers (tinytag12, gemini data loggers, uk) at 2-m depth in open water of lit and in the outlet stream of kro (fig. 1a,b). 55 thaulow et al. sampling (aflp) polymorphism all brown_trout were sampled by gill net fleets con- sisting of the mesh sizes 16.5, 19.5, 22.5, 26, 29, 35, 39 and 45 mm (knot to knot measure), except for kve where only rod fishing was used, allowing both fast and slow growers within each age class to be sam- pled. a small number was captured by rod fishing. from 2009 to 2011, 240 brown_trout were collected from the six lakes and subjected to amplified fragment length fingerprinting (table 1). a subset of these fish and additional collec- tions from 2008 to 2012 were selected for analyses of the otolith and scale interannular widths, yielding a total of 247 individuals for biological analyses (table 1). in addition, 110 females sampled from kol in 2009–2012 were used as a standard for age at maturation (fig. 1c). length of all sampled brown_trout was measured to the nearest mm (lt), and sex and maturity stage were determined according to dahl (1917). sagitta otoliths were removed and cleaned, stored in individual paper envelopes together with scale samples and left to dry before age determination and back calculation of length at age. tissue samples (fin clips) for aflp analysis were stored in 96% etha- nol before dna extraction with the dneasyâ tissue kit (qiagen, d€usseldorf, germany) according to man- ufacturer’s guidelines. molecular analysis amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprint- ing of samples was performed according to vos et al. (1995) with some minor modifications: 300 ng geno- mic dna was digested in 50 ll volumes containing 19 rl-buffer (10 mm tris-aceate ph 7.5, 10 mm mg-aceate, 50 mm potassium-aceate, and 5 mm dtt), 5 u ecori and msei restriction enzymes (fer- mentas, thermo fischer scientific, inc., waltham, ma, usa) for 2 h at 37 °c. adaptors were ligated to cutting sites for 3 h at 37 °c by adding 10 ll of 1 9 rl-buffer containing 5 mm ecori and 50 mm msei adaptors to the 50 ll digestion volume. selec- tive pre-amplification was performed in a 50 ll reac- tion volume containing 5 ll ligated product, 19 pcr-buffer, 1 u taq, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm 0 dntp, 75 ng ecori (5 -gactgcgtaccaattca- 0 0 3 ) and 75 ng msei (5 -gatgagtcctgagtaac- 0 3 ) primers complementary to ligated adaptors. thermo-cycling conditions included 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 56 °c for 30 s and extension at 72 °c for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72 °c for 10 min. the quality and quantity of the pre-amplified products were determined on a 1.0% agarose gel and diluted (1:99) with ddh2o. selective amplification with six 56 primer combinations, with a two-base extension to the ecori and msei pre-amplification primers respec- tively, (i.e. a+ag/c+ct, ag/gt, ct/gt, ct/ta, gc/cg and gt/cg) was performed in a 12 ll reac- tion volume using 2 ll prediluted product, 1 9 pcr buffer, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm dntp, 1 u taq polymerase, 50 lg c-33p-atp labelled ecori primer and 30 lg msei primer. thermo-cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 56 °c for 30 s and extension at 72 °c for 1 min, followed by 11 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 56 °c for 30 s (decreas- ing 0.7 °c for every cycle) and extension at 72 °c for 1 min, followed by 24 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 56 °c for 30 s and extension at 72 °c for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72 °c for 10 min. pcr products were size-separated by 5% polyacrylamide gel elec- trophoresis run at 80 w for 1.5 h. aflps were visu- alised by placing dried gels onto kodak biomax mr films for approximately 48 h. aflp fragments of equal fragment lengths were scored by naked eye as present (1) and absent (0) and arranged in a binary matrix. a subset of the samples (12.5%) was inde- pendently genotyped twice for error rate estimation by direct comparison of scoring mismatches. genetic data analyses the genetic structure of five of the six populations included in this study has already been investigated (sønstebø et al. 2007, 2008). however, with the inclusion of nvv, new and updated genetic analyses of all sampled populations were performed. the num- ber of scored polymorphic loci and percentage of polymorphic loci (%p) in each of the sampled popu- lations were calculated using genalex v6.5 (pea- kall & smouse 2006, 2012). this program was also used to carry out a principal coordinate analysis (pcoa) and pairwise population phipt (analogue to fst for dominant markers) with tests for statistical significance based on 9999 permutations. all analy- ses were performed using polymorphic loci only. otolith and scale analyses otoliths from 247 of the brown_trout sampled between 2008 and 2012 were sectioned through the centre, the fragment surfaces gently polished with no 1200 polish paper, and the surface subsequently burnt over an ethanol flame until winter zones appeared as dark- brown bands (christensen 1964; power 1978). the sectioned and burnt otoliths were placed in plasticine immersed in propandiol and photographed at 40 9 magnification by a meyer instruments, inc., huston, tx, usa, mounted on a dissecting micro- (fig. 2) thermal otolith and scale growth response (a) (b) (c) (d) fig. 2. paired scale and otolith from individual brown_trout. scale (a) and section of broken and burnt otolith (b) from a seven-winter-old brown_trout (year- class 2002) captured in the lake krokavatn, in july 2009, and scale (c) and otolith (d) from a 15-winter-old brown_trout captured in lake kollsvatn, in july 2012. end of winter zones are marked by horizontal lines. grouped lines at the scale margin (c) indicate stagnation as annuli numbers did not concur with that found in the corresponding otolith (d). the 2006 annulus is marked. scope. most of our sampled fish belong to the year classes 1997–2002, and as juveniles seem to use the streams during the first years after hatching, we have avoided analysing the annual growth during the stream residence of the sampled individuals. accord- ingly, we have studied the growth pattern in both immature fish (age ≤7 years), and mature fish (≥8 years) restricted to the annual growth during the years 2004–2008. the differentiation between imma- ture and mature fish was obtained from maturity stages of female fish from kol, indicating a shift from being immature until age 7 to maturity in older fish (fig. 1c). annuli formed in these years were mea- sured along the otolith and scale radii (fig. 2). as the otoliths are not cut at exactly the same transect, the relative widths of the 2004–2008 annuli have been used for statistical analyses, with the width of the 2004 annulus set to 100. imprints of three to five scales from each fish were made in a celluloid strip, magnified in a microfilm reader, and annuli widths measured from scale centre to the edge (fig. 2). scales were used for back calculation of length at age in the same years (i.e. 2004–2008), according to the lea–dahl method (dahl 1910; lea 1910), and indi- vidual annual growth increments were based on these back-calculated lengths. for direct comparison of annual growth increments in otoliths and scales, scale annuli widths were also converted to relative size. statistical analyses to estimate within- and among-population variance components that were as much as possible freed from nongenetic environmental effects, a linear mixed-effects model (lme, e.g. pinheiro & bates 2000) approach was applied for both otolith- and scale-based growth increments, to identify possible differences between immature (≤7 years) and mature 57 thaulow et al. (fig. 1c). individuals (≥8 years) in particular, we included the extrinsic variables water temperature (i.e. mean relative annual summer temperature calcu- lated in the same manner as the relative width of scale and otolith) and population density (see below) to both account for and quantify the effect of density- independent and density-dependent processes on indi- vidual growth respectively. by including principal component values from the pcoa analysis as a can- didate predictor variable, we aimed at retrieving eventual gene-flow effects on individual growth. fish id and population were included as random factors (random intercepts). differences in suitable habitat area and depth, and time of ice-off may all influence annual individual growth in the studied lakes. however, in accordance with literature (jensen 1977; jenkins et al. 1999; vøllestad et al. 2002), we assume that individual growth rates and population density are negatively correlated in brown_trout. as direct or indirect esti- mates of population densities (e.g. cpue data) only were available from the catch year, and not from years at which the back-calculated size increments actually were realised, we fitted scale-based back-cal- culated length at age to the gompertz growth equa- tion (e.g. ricker 1979) and used the l∞ parameter as an indirect index of population density. this parame- ter, the asymptotic length, averages individual growth potential across many years and may therefore pro- vide a reliable proxy for the average population den- sity across years relevant to our samples. in addition to the l∞ parameter, the gompertz growth function has two parameters, g and g. the g parameter is the instantaneous growth rate at age 0 (i.e. t = 0), and the g parameter is the instantaneous rate at which g decreases as age increases: lt ¼ l1e  e ðg gtþ : as expected, the l∞ parameter was negatively asso- ciated with cpue20–40 cm derived from 2004–2007 gillnet surveys conducted in five of the six study lakes (rp =  0.77, n = 5, p = 0.07). unfortunately, no such cpue data exist for the last lake (kve), leaving us with the l∞ parameter as the most complete den- sity-related metric available for our analyses. model selection was conducted using aicc follow- ing routines described in zuur et al. (2009). model averaging was undertaken for models yielding daicc ≤ 4 (richards 2008). all statistical analyses were con- ducted using r version 3.2.0 (r core team 2015), with the lme4 library. the influence.me and aicc- modavg packages were used for lme model valida- tion/diagnostics and model selection, and the nls2 library used for fitting the gompertz model. type iii test statistics for the fitted lme models were per- 58 formed using the wald f test with kenward–roger degrees of freedom (kenward & roger 1997), as implemented in the car package in r. results water temperature mean annual summer temperature in lit during 2004–2008 was 9.97 °c: but varied substantially among years: 12.0, 8.6, 13.1, 6.7 and 9.0 °c for each of the years 2004–2008 respectively. mean daily fell below 1.2 °c or summer exceeded 17.2 °c. additional temperature measure- ments from the kro outlet stream showed the same yearly variation as lit (fig. 1b) and were not used in further analyses. temperature never growth potential the gompertz length-at-age parameters, obtained from back-calculated length-at-age data from scale samples, indicate variation in growth potential among lakes. highest and lowest growth potentials occurred in kve and ska, with asymptotic lengths at 38.4 and 27.8 cm respectively (table s1). population genetics a total of 139 polymorphic aflp loci were scored from the six primer combinations, with an estimated error rate of 1.2%. mean percentage polymorphism among all sampled populations was 75.9% [5.7% (se)], ranging from 49.6% (nvv) to 86.3% (kol) (table s2). all pairwise fst estimates were significant at the 5% level (table s2). the three stocked populations generally showed the strongest differentiation, whereas among the three introgressed populations, genetic differentiation was low, but increased downstream (i.e. kve was more differentiated from kol than lit). genetic differentia- tion between ska and kol was low, compared to ska versus all other sampled populations. principal coordinate analysis separated sampling location kro, with an intermediate positioning of ska and kol from nvv, lit and kve along principal component (pc) 1, explaining 62.3% of the genetic variation (fig. 3). sam- pling location nvv was separated from lit and kve along pc2, explaining 20.2% of the variation, and prin- cipal component 3, explaining 13.9%, separated ska from kol. mean annual growth of scales and otoliths mean relative annuli widths from otoliths and scales across all study populations were positively associ- ated with mean annual summer temperature for all thermal otolith and scale growth response revealed that they were not significantly different (v2 = 4.55, d.f. = 2, p = 0.103). there is therefore little support for among-population differentiation in the thermal otolith-increment responses. as the two top-ranked models both received substantial aicc weights (0.67 and 0.32 respectively), model averag- ing was undertaken for the fixed-effects parameters (table s3). intrinsic and extrinsic effects on scale growth back-calculated included an age*temperature growth on there was strong support in the data for differentiated temperature effects among ages, as the three best sup- ported models, entailing more than 0.99 of the aicc weight, interaction effect increment (table s5). in contrast to the otolith increment analy- sis, there was high support (aic weight = 0.99) for density-regime effects (i.e. l∞) on length increment, where the most supported model structure including this variable as an additive effect. as expected, the positive density-regime effect [0.092  0.017 (se)], individual growth rates are higher in lakes with large l∞. there was more support for models including random popu- lation effects

coefficient was indicating that received less support as can be interpreted from the most supported model parameter estimates displayed in table s6, back-calculated length increment was highest for age 2 and generally decreased as age increased. the tem- perature effect on back-calculated length increment decreased with increasing age, resulting in very low increment responses for ages above seven years (fig. 5b). discussion among responses this study documents parallel thermal otolith- and scale-increment interconnected alpine brown_trout populations. although the two growth-related traits differ in their age-specific tem- perature responses, virtually all populations displayed parallel thermal responses for both traits. these find- ings should be interpreted in light of significant neu- tral among-population genetic structuring and recent introgression of non-native genotypes into the studied populations. the annual increment in scales and otoliths did not match in mature fish (>7 years) from the study area, as scale growth seems to be linked to somatic growth until around age seven, corresponding to age at matu- ration, while otolith increment width was

from mature individuals showed no association with temperature. individual representation of this correlation was consistent from each of the study populations, showing no strong deviation between populations, except kve where no difference in increment width of otoliths and scales was recorded in mature individuals (fig. 4). intrinsic and extrinsic effects on otolith growth there was little support in the data for differentiated temperature effect among ages in otolith increment, as age*temperature interaction effect models attained high aicc values compared to their additive counter- part models (table s3). little support was found for density-regime effects (i.e. l∞) on otolith increment, as daic>9 for candidate models including this vari- able. models including year as a fixed effect (not shown) generally had little support compared to those including temperature as a substitute for year effect. there was more support for models including random population effect rather than using genetic structure predictors (principal components, pc1–pc3). the temperature effect on otolith increment was highly significant and positive (fig. 5a). as can be interpreted from the most supported model parameter estimates displayed in table s4, otolith increment was highest at age 2 and generally decreased as age increased. the highest ranked model involved differential random intercepts and slopes of temperature among populations (i.e. (1 + st.t|population)). however, this model attained an aicc value that was just 1.5 units lower than the simpler second-ranked model which included no random slope effect for temperature. a likelihood ratio test between the two top models thaulow et al. otoliths[mature] otoliths[immature] scales[mature] scales[immature] 2004 2005 2006

(aass 1972). temperature responses have also been observed in lake_trout where otolith annuli widths were related to fluctua- tions in august air temperature over a 22-year inter- val in an alaskan lake (black et al. 2013). likewise, brown_trout showed high correlation between somatic growth and the number of days with temperatures above 7 °c in a subalpine norwegian lake (hestha- gen et al. 2004). somatic growth rate is often found to have a maximum response at an intermediate temperature within the species’ range of tolerance (webb 1978). for brown_trout, the range over which feeding and growth occurs seems to be 2.0–19 °c, with an 60 fig. 4. mean relative annuli widths of otoliths and scales from brown_trout in the six studied populations (blue = scales, red = otoliths) divided into two groups representing mature (solid lines) and immature fish (broken lines) together with mean relative summer temperature for the years 2004–2008. mean relative values are calculated with the width of the 2004 annulus, or temperature, set to 100 respectively. mature individuals are represented by the 1997 year class (except kve represented by year classes 1998 and 1999) and immature by year class 2002 (except nvv represented by year class 2003). population abbreviations are given in table 1. optimum around 13 °c when fed maximum rations (elliott 1975, 1981; forseth et al. 2009), indicating that optimum growth temperature may not be reached every year or only in limited periods during the ice- free season in the study area. in the juvenile stage, somatic and otolith growth of fish seems to match (fey & hare 2012; baumann et al. 2013); however, beyond age at maturity, somatic growth ceases due to allocation of energy into reproduction (hile 1970). despite this expected decrease or halt in somatic growth, otoliths have been shown to continue grow- ing in adult fish, suggesting that otolith growth is linked to metabolism rather than somatic growth per se (mosegaard & titus 1987; mosegaard et al. 1988), a hypothesis that has received support from findings of positive correlation between oxygen con- sumption and otolith growth (wright et al. 2001). the identified significant positive correlation between annual otolith increments and temperature may accordingly represent a metabolic response rather than the effects of local adaptation or plasticity (gauldie & nelson 1990; yamamoto et al. 1998; wright et al. 2001). however, uncoupled otolith and somatic growth has been observed in unfavourable (a) ) % ( t n e m e r c n i h t i l o t  o e v i t l a e r 0 6 1 0 4 1 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 8 7 7 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 9 8 13 mean july−september temperature (°c) 12 10 11 6 0 0 2 14 (b) 6 ) m c ( t n e m e r c n i t h w o r g  d e t l l a u c a c − k c a b 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 thermal otolith and scale growth response age 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 9 8 13 mean july−september temperature (°c) 10 12 11 6 0 0 2 14 fig. 5. prediction plot for the average effect of water temperature on (a) relative otolith increment, here exemplified using age 2, and (b) on age-specific back-calculated annual growth increment from scales. predictions were retrieved from fixed-effects parameter estimates of the most supported lme model, provided in table s4 and table s6 for otolith (a) and scales (b) respectively. year-specific temperature values are indicated along the x-axis.

(b) between ages 7 and 9, back-calculated annual growth is close to 0. favourable conditions, growth conditions, for example, limited food supply (campana 1983; volk et al. 1984) or hyperoptimal temperatures (mosegaard et al. 1988), indicating that a direct linkage between otolith increment and somatic growth is unlikely. positive correlation between otolith growth and temperature may there- fore potentially result from, and thus be used as an indicator of, years with environmental conditions beneficial for high growth and high metabolic rate. under the somatic growth potential may be realised even in older individuals, as was observed in mature individuals from kve. this lake holds the largest potential for individual growth as evident from the gompertz estimates of asymptotic length. the five remaining locations most likely do not provide the same growth potential even under favourable growth temperatures, probably due to higher population densities, as indicated by the estimated asymptotic lengths. several studies have shown that individual growth in salmonids may increase when population density is decreased (jen- sen 1977; donald & alger 1989; klemetsen et al. 2002; janhunen et al. 2010), or translocated to more favourable habitats (rosseland 1956), as also shown for, for example, european perch (perca fluviatilis l.; persson 1986). the among-population parallelism in the positive association between mean summer temperatures and width of otolith increments in mature, growth-stag- nated fish indicates that the same thermal growth response has been favoured in all populations, irre- spective of genetic background. the origin of the stocked fish in the three lakes kro, ska and nvv remains enigmatic; however, the aflp analysis indi- cates high genetic diversity among these populations. the genetic differentiation among the sampled popu- lations was generally in accordance with previous studies in five of the lakes (sønstebø et al. 2007, 2008), as well as the stocking history of nvv. although elevation asl, snow conditions and ice-off varies among the lakes, the temperature profiles show relatively small differences, as seen in lit and kro during the years 2004–2008, and the differences seem to be proportional and comparable. the study system therefore provides a relevant situation for studying scale and otolith growth responses in multi- ple populations under natural conditions, whereas a more controlled experiment under a common-garden design would be problematic due to the large time scope (age range: 6–15 years) that would be required. despite genetic differentiation, especially among the three headwater lakes, stabilising selection may have resulted in convergent adaptation in the thermal growth responses. this should be interpreted in light of the relatively short time since population establish- ment or most recent restocking, indicating that sub- stantial selection enforced by the region-specific temperature regime must have occurred during 3–10 generations (assuming age at maturity = 7 years). adaptation of developmental and life-history traits to 61 thaulow et al. local thermal conditions has been found to occur over relatively short time in introduced salmonids (for examples see: koskinen et al. 2002; kavanagh et al. 2010; crozier & hutchings 2014: 6–30 generations, reviewed in fraser et al. 2011). in fitness-related traits like individual growth, adaptation may take place despite the commonly documented low heri- tability for such traits (mousseau & roff 1987) due to either high selection intensities (kingsolver et al. 2001) or high residual genetic variance that allows evolution via complex genetic architecture pathways (meril€a & sheldon 2000). in fact, a study of multiple nordic populations of brown_trout raised under com- mon-garden conditions found no evidence for tem- perature adaptation in somatic growth performance (forseth et al. 2009), which strongly suggests canali- sation of thermal reaction norms of growth perfor- mance in this species. response patterns for either of in conclusion, despite the presence of profound genetic differentiation among the studied populations, especially for the three introduced headwater popula- tions, we found no indication of differentiation in thermal the two growth-related traits (i.e. annual otolith and scale increments) among populations. this parallelism in thermal growth-response pattern indicates that the study populations have experienced stabilising selec- tion with respect to these traits. the comparison of somatic growth with annuli widths in scales and oto- liths showed that reliable scale annuli were only deposited in the juvenile stage. after maturation, the failure to produce distinct annuli in scales indicates somatic growth stagnation. however, in somatic growth did not seem to affect the continuous formation of otolith annuli, and, most importantly, their positive growth correlation to temperature. the positive correlation between otolith increment width and temperature, irrespective of age and somatic growth, suggests that otoliths, besides being valuable for age determination, may have a value as indicators of difference in mean annual summer temperature in past years, as well. due to continued otolith growth, dependence on fluctuations in summer temperature, the utilisation of otolith annuli widths for back calcu- lation of growth/length at age should be treated with caution. this halt acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge j. g. dokk and
