shortﬁn eels (anguilla dieffenbachii and a. australis) were sampled from southern new zealand in the mid-1990s to determine the status of the eel population. we compared this with historical information on eel populations to highlight changes in the status, and then investigated the likely causes of these changes. a total of 20,722 longﬁns and 2366 shortﬁns were sampled from 216 landings. longﬁns dominated catches comprising 53–100% (mean ¼ 90%) of eel numbers. shortﬁns were predominantly, but not exclusively, coastal in their distribution, whereas longﬁns were widely distributed through all reaches sampled. mean size of shortﬁn was invariably larger than longﬁn and for both species generally increased with distance inland, particularly for longﬁn in the longest rivers. there was no clear geographical separation of longﬁn sexes although females were more common further inland in the longer rivers. longﬁn sex ratio was about 4:1 (male:female), whereas in shortﬁn it was nearly 100% female. there have been marked changes in the status of the eel population in southern new zealand over the last 60 years. we suggest that commercial ﬁshing has resulted in a reduction in the size of both species, and for longﬁns a skewing of the sex ratio toward males – ﬁshing may have favoured differentiation into males as well as the removal of the longer-lived longﬁn females. skewed sex ratio and small size of longﬁns compared with those of shortﬁn suggest that this species has been more affected by ﬁshing pressure than shortﬁns, possibly allowing shortﬁns to expand their range further inland. m. p. beentjes1, d. j. jellyman2, s. w. kim3 1national institute of water and atmospheric research limited, dunedin, new zealand, 2national institute of water and atmospheric

niwa.co.nz accepted for publication march 2, 2006 introduction new zealand has two species of freshwater eel, the shortﬁn, anguilla australis (richardson), and the longﬁn, a. dieffenbachii (gray). the latter is endemic to new zealand whereas a. australis is also found in south-east australia and tasmania (jellyman 1993). eels are diadromous, and the young glass eels arrive in fresh water after an oceanic larval phase of 9– 10 months (arai et al. 1999). growth of new zealand species is generally slow, and female shortﬁns average 22 years when they migrate to sea for spawning, whereas female longﬁns average 34 years (jellyman & todd 1982). both species are found throughout new zealand and distributions overlap extensively. however, there are some differences in the habitat preferences of both species (mcdowall & taylor 2000; jellyman et al. 2003). longﬁns prefer fast-ﬂowing rivers and are distributed from the coast to inland high-altitude rivers 428 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00165.x and lakes, whereas shortﬁns are predominantly found in slower-ﬂowing coastal habitats such as lagoons, estuaries and lower reaches of rivers. the classical theory on the distribution of the sexes of other temperate species of eel suggests that males are restricted to downstream reaches of waterways, whereas females penetrate well upstream (e.g., tesch 1928; bertin 1956). this is partly supported for new zealand eels by cairns (1941) who recorded the sex distribution of about 11,000 eels from southland and otago rivers, and found that males of both species and shortﬁn females were conﬁned to estuarine habitats of lakes and lagoons. longﬁn females, however, were found throughout river systems from the estuaries to inland tributaries and lakes. in contrast, subsequent and more recent studies have found males to be well represented in freshwater habitats (burnet 1969a; harries 1974; mccleave & jellyman 2004). large rivers and to coastal the commercial ﬁshery for new zealand eels began in the 1960s and annual catches over the last 10 years average c. 1400 t (annala et al. 2002) of which c. 60% is shortﬁn and 40% longﬁn (beentjes & bull 2002). about half of the catch is taken from the south island (annala et al. 2002), and the rivers of southland and otago are major ﬁsheries, particularly for longﬁn eels which contribute c. 30% of the total south island longﬁn catch (beentjes & bull 2002). we report results from a programme monitoring commercial catches of freshwater eels from otago and changing population structure of eels southland in the mid-1990s. we use these data to determine the status of the current eel population. we then examine to what extent this has changed over the last 60 years and investigate the likely causes of these changes. methods sampling design landings were sampled from the commercial eel mainstems of the waiau, aparima, oreti, mataura, clutha and waitaki rivers (fig. 1), lower south island, new zealand. a detailed account of the new zealand-wide commercial eel catch sampling pro- gramme is given elsewhere (beentjes & chisnall 1997, 1998; beentjes 1999; chisnall & kemp 2000). sampling was carried out during the ﬁshing season (november–march) in 1995–1996, 1996–1997 and 1997–1998. all of these rivers extend inland for c. 100–200 km, although sampling was conﬁned to regions below the ﬁrst hydro dams on the clutha and waitaki rivers. these six rivers are the major longﬁn eel ﬁsheries in otago and southland and experience relatively high ﬁshing pressure. rivers were subdivided into 2–4 discrete strata, with stratum 1 adjacent to the coast. strata boundaries were based on the length of the river and prominent physical features such as lakes, falls, conﬂuences, dams and bridges (fig. 1). fishing was carried out by fig. 1. map of the lower south island, new zealand, showing the rivers and strata from which commercial landings were sampled. 429 beentjes et al. 13 commercial ﬁshers who were provided with deﬁnitions of strata boundaries and requested to keep separate all eels caught within deﬁned strata. they were not instructed where to ﬁsh, but only to clearly identify the location of each landing, and thus sampling was opportunistic. francis (1999) addressed the issue of optimal design for catch sampling eels in the new zealand commercial ﬁshery and showed that areal stratiﬁcation was appropriate and that variance is more dependent on the number of landings sampled than the number of eels in the landing. additional landings were sampled from taieri river above the taieri gorge and waikaka stream, a tributary of the mataura river (fig. 1). these two areas are not accessible by boat and have only been lightly ﬁshed (victor thompson, commercial eel processor, pers. comm.). fishing practices eels were caught using 12-mm-mesh fyke nets ﬁtted with 31-mm internal diameter escape tubes that allow eels below the minimum legal size (220 g, c. 45 cm total length) to escape. the commercial size range for eels in the south island is between 220 and 4000 g. nets are usually baited with paua (haliotis sp.) guts and left to ﬁsh overnight. jet boats are commonly used in the larger river systems and ﬁshers set, on average, 20–40 nets per night and catch c. 100 kg (beentjes & bull 2002). captured eels are removed from the nets and placed in holding bags for periods ranging from a few hours to several days, before being landed live at the processing factory. biological sampling invercargill, new zealand) all sampling occurred at a single factory (mossburn enterprises ltd, that processes eels from throughout the south island. upon arrival at the factory, total landed weight of eels (species unsorted) was recorded and a random sample of between 100 and 200 eels, or the entire catch from smaller landings, was sampled. species (shortﬁn or longﬁn), length (to the nearest cm), weight (g) and sex (male, female or immature) were recorded individually for each eel in the sample for 1996–1997 and 1997– 1998. sex was assigned by macroscopic examination of gonads using the descriptions from todd (1974). the proportion of each species by weight in the total landed weight was calculated from the proportion by weight of that species in the sample. strata and rivers for the intensively ﬁshed six main rivers. therefore, given the large number of data sets (six rivers, three ﬁshing years, 2–4 strata per river) we investigated whether these data sets were different and, if not, how they could be condensed to simplify presentation and interpret observed patterns. accord- ingly, we used a generalised linear model (glm) with gaussian link function that assumes normally distri- buted error around the model ﬁt. the log-transformed length of eels (shortﬁn and longﬁn analysed sepa- rately) was taken as the response variable. the predictor variables used in the model were river, ﬁshing year and distance (¼strata). distance was deﬁned as the inland boundary of each stratum measured by following the path of the river from 1:50,000 topographical maps (see fig. 1). this method was used because we did not know the exact location within the stratum where the eels were caught. we accepted variables into the model only if the variable increased the explained model variation (r2) by 1%. commercially processed size grades we examined records from mossburn enterprises ltd on size grades and species composition of eels processed over 30 years. although these data included catches from throughout the south island, they were predominantly from the lower south island. records were available for the years 1974–1975, 1977–1978, 1978–1979 and 1983–1984 to 1995–1996. because there were no records for some years, the data for each size grade were combined by decade (1970s, 1980s and 1990s). for each year for which there were data, the proportion of the catch by weight in each size grade was calculated, and then for each decade the mean proportion and standard error of eels in each size grade was determined. because processors only record data on weights and not length, approximate lengths corresponding to the weight grades were calculated from the length–weight relationship of eels from stratum 1 of from the model w ¼ a(l)b, where w is the weight (g) and l is the total length (cm). for longﬁns the regression coefﬁcients (n ¼ 1315, were r2 ¼ 0.90), and b ¼ 3.05 (n ¼ 529, r2 ¼ 0.97) (beentjes & chisnall 1998). the mataura river a ¼ 0.0017 a ¼ 0.0013 and for shortﬁns and b ¼ 3.15 results landings sampled statistical analyses

from the six main rivers, as well as taieri river and waikaka stream. landings from coastal strata were generally more common as they are more accessible to ﬁshers and often more intensively ﬁshed than inland strata. the most intensively sampled catchments were the mataura, clutha and oreti rivers. longﬁns were present in all 216 landings and shortﬁn in 128 landings (table 1). landed weights of longﬁns and shortﬁns from all eight rivers totalled 41.5 and 6.7 t, respect- ively, and the overall proportion of the landed weights sampled was 19.6% for longﬁns and 20.9% for shortﬁns. the overall ratio of longﬁn to shortﬁn eel landed weights was 6:1. length and weight were recorded from 20,722 longﬁns and 2366 shortﬁns and the mean number of ﬁsh sampled per landing was 92 for longﬁns and 10 for shortﬁns. species distribution longﬁns were the predominant species in all 19 strata in terms of numbers, ranging from 53% to 100% longﬁn, and averaging 90%, (table 1). the percentage of longﬁns tended to be higher for inland strata, where it was frequently 100%. indeed, in all six main rivers except the clutha river, the propor- ) % ( n i f g n o l 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 25 waiau oreti clutha

inland between beaumont and roxburgh dam on the clutha river, however, (stratum 4, 77–116 km), only longﬁns were found. shortﬁns were mainly conﬁned to distances <80 km inland, and were most prevalent in the waitaki river, particularly near the coast. species compositions in the inland taieri river and waikaka stream were similar to those from the six main rivers, with few shortﬁns present (table 1). 431 beentjes et al. size combining length distributions among years the variables included in the ﬁnal glm model for longﬁn are shown in table 2 in the order they were included in the model. the ﬁnal model explained 13.5% of the variation in length. the results of the glm indicate that as ﬁshing year did not enter the model, length distributions did not vary with ﬁshing year and it is acceptable to combine the longﬁn data from the three ﬁshing years, but to retain river and stratum distinctions. the interaction term between distance inland and river explained >1% of the model variation and some rivers had signiﬁcantly different coefﬁcients from zero. inclusion of the interaction term indicates that each river has a different coefﬁcient of increase in length distribution with distance inland. for shortﬁn are shown in table 3 in the order they were included in the model. the interaction term between distance inland and river explained >1% of the model variation but none of the coefﬁcients were signiﬁ- cantly different from zero, so the interaction was not included in the ﬁnal model. therefore, there was no difference in the coefﬁcient of increase in length with distance inland. the results of the analysis indicate that the shortﬁn length frequency distribution varies with ﬁshing year, river and strata. thus, unlike longﬁn, it was not appropriate to combine shortﬁn data from the three ﬁshing years. the variables included in the ﬁnal model longﬁn mean length the measured mean length of longﬁn females (63 cm) exceeded that of both males (53.7 cm) and

length of males, females and immature eels for each river generally increased from coastal to inland strata, as did the mean total length (table 4). for the three longest rivers (>80 km; mataura, waiau and clutha rivers), there was a considerable difference in the mean length between the coastal and the most inland strata indicating that eels were larger further inland. to explore this further, longﬁn mean length was estimated for distance inland in each river using the glm model (fig. 3). the results conﬁrm that longﬁn length increases with distance inland, except in waitaki and oreti rivers where it decreases. the mataura and waiau rivers have the steepest increase in length with distance inland. longﬁn length distributions there are only minor differences in the length frequency distributions among the six main rivers, the waiau river strata are hence only those for presented (fig. 4). the distributions from all three waiau river strata also demonstrate the trend of increasing size with distance inland. for example, in stratum 3, 50% of males are <53 cm, compared with 51 cm in strata 1 and 2. similarly, 50% of females are <66 cm in stratum 3 compared with 63 cm and 61 cm for strata 1 and 2, respectively. the trend of increasing mean size with distance inland was also most evident for distributions from the mataura and clutha rivers (not shown), which tended to be more positively skewed the further inland the strata. in these three rivers, this was partially a result of a higher proportion of females in the catch of inland strata (table 5). length frequency distributions for coastal strata (stratum 1) of all the main rivers, except the waitaki, were strongly unimodal with modes at c. 50 cm with few longﬁn eels over 60 cm, similar to that shown by the length-frequency histogram for stratum 1 of the waiau river (fig. 4). in contrast to the six main rivers, the less accessible and lightly ﬁshed taieri river and waikaka stream had greater mean lengths and length- frequency distributions skewed to the right, reﬂecting a longﬁn population with a higher proportion of larger eels, most of which were females (see tables 4 and 5; fig. 5). shortﬁn mean length although shortﬁn length frequency was shown to vary with ﬁshing year, there are considerably fewer data than for longﬁn (see table 1). hence for practical reasons, and to compare with longﬁn, the data for the three years were combined to show relative mean length by river and strata (table 6). the measured mean length of shortﬁn females was 65.3 cm. the total mean length of shortﬁn eels was greater than that of longﬁns in all strata where species distributions changing population structure of eels table 4. descriptive statistics on longﬁn eel (anguilla dieffenbachii) length

where sample size was reasonable, the length frequency distributions between year and river were generally similar and hence only that for stratum 1 of mataura river in 1996–1997 is presented (fig.

see fig. 5) and the ratio of males to females was 1:5.2 and 1:85, respectively. shortﬁns sex was determined for 1398 shortﬁns in 1996–1997 and 1997–1998 (see table 5) and of these, only seven males and one immature eel were recorded, with the remaining 99.4% being female. in all, 13 strata from the six main rivers where shortﬁns were caught, females comprised between 99% and 100% of the catch. shortﬁn males migrate at about 43 cm (145 g) (jellyman 1996; jellyman & todd 1998) and are not generally vulnerable to fyke nets where escapement 434 tubes ensure that few eels less than the minimum legal size of 220 g (c. 45 cm) are retained. historical commercial size grades there has been a progressive trend of declining proportions of all size grades processed from the 1970s to the 1990s (fig. 8, top panel). the proportion of eels in the smallest size grade (<454 g, <57 cm) has progressively increased over time to become the predominant grade processed (i.e., 15% in 1970s, 43% in 1980s and 52% in 1990s). generally, the differences are greatest between the 1970s and the 1980s/1990s. trends in size grades of shortﬁn eels are similar to those for longﬁn eels although the size grades are slightly different (fig. 8, middle panel) and the greatest differences are between the 1970s/1980s and the 1990s. species composition shows a progressive increase in the proportion of shortﬁns processed, especially from 1992–1993 onward (fig. 8, bottom panel). discussion the present study reviewed an extensive data set of over 23,000 commercially caught eels covering rivers from a broad geographic region (southern south island). this extensive numerical and geographical sampling, coupled with the consistency of size distri- butions within strata between years, gives us conﬁd- ence that the results are robust, and indicative of the status of eel populations available to commercial ﬁshing in the mid-1990s. as stated, the primary aim of this paper is to describe the current status of eel populations in otago and southland, to compare this with the historical populations, and to explore possible causes of any changes. species distributions at the time of the study both eel species were found throughout otago and southland, but shortﬁn were most abundant near the coast, and longﬁn from the coast to the most inland reaches of river systems. however, shortﬁn eels were found up to 80 km inland, indicating that they are not conﬁned to the coast. this ﬁnding is consistent with other recent studies (mitchell & davis-te maire 1996; mcdowall & taylor 2000; jellyman et al. 2003; mccleave & jellyman 2004), including niwa’s fish database. mcdowall & taylor (2000) note that the pattern of occurrence for both eel species varies regionally and changes throughout new zealand depending on such factors as habitat topography and climate. type, geology, freshwater table 5. sex composition of longﬁn (anguilla dieffenbachii) and shortﬁn eels (a. australis) landings from eight sampled from commercial southland and otago rivers, new zealand, in 1996–1997 and 1997–1998. river waiau aparima oreti mataura clutha waitaki overall other rivers changing population structure of eels sex composition (%) longﬁn shortﬁn stratum n male female immature n male female immature 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 583 431 240 708 833 1169 462 705 2192 196 0 0 938 805 113 90 269 321 311 10,366 35.3 39.0 43.8 48.7 45.1 44.1 43.3 38.6 34.9 41.3 – – 41.7 40.9 30.1 30.0 33.8 38.9 35.0 39.9 10.3 14.4 30.8 4.0 3.0 10.8 2.4 3.5 1.9 20.9 – – 7.2 8.0 15.0 21.1 39.0 29.6 30.2 9.2 95.5 59.1 54.4 46.6 25.4 47.3 51.9 45.1 54.3 57.9 63.2 37.8 – – 51.1 51.2 54.9 48.9 27.1 31.5 34.7 50.8 3.4 29.6 23 14 0 51 24 74 41 0 645 0 0 0 40 63 2 0 255 149 17 1398 0 0 – 0 0 0 0 – 0.8 – – – 0 0 0 – 0.8 0 0 0.5 4 2 0 0 100 100 – 100 100 100 100 – 99.1 – – – 100 100 100 – 99.2 100 100 99.4 100 100 0 0 – 0 0 0 0 – 0.2 – – – 0 0 0 – 0 0 0 0.1 0 0 waikaka steam – taieri 4 89 494 1.1 11.3 l s e e f o r e b m u n 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 8 6 4 2 0 30 taieri river (stratum 4) males females immature distribution and abundance of shortﬁns after the removal of larger longﬁns from a small waikato stream in the north island (chisnall et al. 2003), and supports mcdowall’s (1993) theory that the distribution of eel species in new zealand is related to habitat suitability or availability rather than the ability to penetrate inland. 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 sex ratios waikaka stream 40 50 60 70 80 length (cm) 90 100 110 fig. 5. length frequency distributions of longﬁn eels (anguilla dieffenbachii) from commercial landings (1996–1997 and 1997– 1998) from taieri river (stratum 4) and waikaka stream (see table 4 for number of eels in each category). historically, shortﬁn eels in southland rivers were found only in estuarine sections of rivers, and coastal lakes and lagoons (cairns 1941). if cairn’s observa- tions were correct, then shortﬁn eels have expanded their inland range in these areas, possibly as longﬁn size and abundance has declined, particularly those of females. this is consistent with an increase in the the shortﬁn commercial ﬁshery is based almost entirely on females because most male shortﬁns migrate below the national minimum legal size of 220 g and, therefore, do not recruit to the ﬁshery (jellyman & todd 1998). in contrast, the longﬁn commercial ﬁshery is based predominantly on immature and male eels (91% of landed longﬁns) (see table 5). more recent biological sampling of aparima river in 2001 and 2002 (mccleave & jellyman 2004) showed a male-to-female ratio of 68:1, compared with 13:1 for this study. the larger proportion of males may be the result of assigning sex to a greater proportion of the catch (95% of eels from the aparima were identiﬁed as male or female by these authors using histological techniques compared with 50% in this study using macroscopic examination). from the results of catch sampling on other commercial eel ﬁsheries throughout the south island, females generally comprised a greater proportion of the catch than in southland, but overall, there were about twice as many males as females (beentjes & chisnall 1998; beentjes 1999). furthermore, if a large proportion of the immature eels were indeed males, 435 beentjes et al. table 6. descriptive statistics on shortﬁn eel (anguilla australis) length sampled from commercial landings from eight southland and otago rivers, new zealand. river stratum waiau river aparima river oreti river mataura clutha river waitaki river overall other rivers waikakasteam taieri river 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 – 4 total mean length (cm) 62.8 65.0 – 62.8 64.1 65.5 67.0 – 61.0 72.0 – – 64.9 63.5 65.6 – 61.6 66.2 71.9 65.3 85.0 73.0 males mean length (cm) – – – – – – – – 53.0 – – – – – – – 47.0 – – 50.0 – – se – – – – – – – – 1.58 – – – – – – – 2.00 – – – – n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 females mean length (cm) 62.8 65.0 – 65.2 64.3 65.4 67.4 – 61.2 – – – 63.8 68.3 71.0 – 61.9 65.8 66.1 65.3 85.0 73.0 se 1.68 2.08 – 1.38 1.79 1.23 1.84 – 0.38 – – – 1.65 1.29 10.00 – 0.63 0.85 2.28 15.5 7.0 immature mean length (cm) se n – – – – – – – – 52.0 – – – – – – – – – – 52.0 – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 n 23 14 0 51 24 74 41 0 639 0 0 0 40 63 2 0 253 149 17 4 2 se 1.68 2.08 – 0.82 1.66 1.17 1.80 – 0.30 5.26 – – 0.98 0.75 1.35 – 0.59 0.84 1.32 15.5 7.0 n 23 14 0 186 26 89 43 0 974 6 0 0 120 226 72 0 285 165 131 4 2 total includes all years (1995–1996, 1996–1997 and 1997–1998). males, females and immature includes 1996–1997 and 1997–1998. ) m c ( h t g n e l n a e m 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 a96 a97 a98 c96 c97 c98 m96 o96 o97 o98 w98 wa96 w97 wa98 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 distance inland (km) fig. 6. mean length of shortﬁn eels (anguilla australis) estimated from the generalised linear model, in relation to distance inland from commercial landings from six rivers for the ﬁshing years 1995–1996, 1996–1997 and 1997–1998. data are shown separately for each river and ﬁshing year (see table 1 for details of landings). the letters in the legend refers to the river, and the numbers the ﬁshing year, where 96 is 1995–1996;

burnet 1952), it is apparent that there has been a substantial shift in the sex ratio towards males. sex distribution overall it is difﬁcult to generalise about the distribu- tion of males and females within the six main river 436 l s e e f o r e b m u n 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 mataura river (stratum1,1996–1997) males females 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 length (cm) fig. 7. length-frequency distribution of shortﬁn eels (anguilla australis) from commercial landings (1996–1997) from stratum 1 of mataura river (see table 2 for number of eels in each category). to the most systems studied. for the longest rivers (clutha, waiau and mataura), the proportion of female longﬁns was less in the upper reaches than near the coast, but for the shorter rivers (aparima, oreti and waitaki) there were no consistent trends in the proportions of sex with distance inland. cairns (1941) concluded that male longﬁns in southland rivers were conﬁned to estuarine locations, however, this does not agree with ﬁndings from the present study or other south island rivers, where males were found in abundance from the coast inland reaches (burnet 1952, 1969a,b; harries 1974; beentjes & chisnall 1998; beentjes 1999; mccleave & jellyman 2004). while a number of studies on the sex distribution of the american eel, anguilla rostrata and european eel, a. anguilla have concluded that females are usually found in fresh water and males in brackish water (tesch 1928; bertin 1956; helfman et al. 1987), a review of the literature (dolan & power 1977) and a series of other studies (sinha & jones 1966; gray & andrews 1970; huver 1996) have found no evidence that this distribution of sexes is universal. therefore, it is not clear whether there has been a shift in the distribution of male and female longﬁns in the lower south island. size distributions before the commencement of commercial ﬁshing for eels in the late 1960s, longﬁn populations in southland were dominated by larger eels that, from size alone, would have been mainly females. for instance, the average weight from more than 11,000 eels caught in tributaries of the oreti river in 1939 for scientiﬁc study was c. 1400 g (cairns 1942), which equates to a length of c. 83 cm. this is more than 30 cm larger than the total mean size of eels from this river in the present study. furthermore, longﬁns from three inland south- land rivers (waiau tributaries) sampled between 1947 and 1949 (burnet 1952) were mainly between c. 60 and changing population structure of eels longfin eels ) % ( n a e m ) % ( n a e m 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0–454 80 454–9 263 908–1 0–500 00 500–9 263 900–1 6181 0722 1816– 1362– size grade (g) shortfin eels 6181 0722 1816– 1362– size grade (g) 1970s 1980s 1990s 8713 2270– 871 3> 1970s 1980s 1990s 8713 2270– 871 3> 19/0 9 91 39/2 9 91 59/4 9 91 ) % ( h c t a c 100 80 60 40 20 0 57/4 7 91 77/6 7 91 97/8 7 91 18/0 8 91 38/2 8 91 longfin shortfin 98/8 8 91 78/6 8 91 58/4 8 91 fishing year fig. 8. comparison of size grades of longﬁn eels (top) and shortﬁn eels (middle) processed at mossburn enterprises (invercargill) in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s. years in 1970s: 1974–1975, 1977–1978 and 1978–1979;

zwanenburg 2000; friedlander & demartini 2002). the commercial size grade data on eels processed show a clear reduction in both the size of both species and the proportion of longﬁn in landings over the differences in longﬁn size grades over time suggest that the main ‘ﬁshing down’ period occurred in the 1970s, whereas for shortﬁns this may have been in the 1980s. although the commercial eel ﬁshery has operated since the mid-1960s (annala et al. 2002), catches have only been signiﬁcant since the early 1970s, coinciding with most marked changes in size grades of longﬁn. thus, the size distribution data of the 1970s may indicate the transition between a semi-virgin and developing ﬁshery. the associated decline in longﬁn species composition in the 1990s is consistent with a catch per unit effort (cpue) analysis of the commer- cial eel ﬁshery that showed a progressive decline in catch rates from southland and otago between 1990 and 2002 (beentjes & dunn 2003). tended to be larger inland. although we had no information on effort (number of net lifts) for each landing, because we generally sampled all available catches from each stratum, the number of landings per stratum can be used as a proxy for effort (see table 1). apart from the waitaki river, most effort was applied to the most accessible coastal strata. we suggest that the trend of increasing size with distance inland is partly related to ﬁshing pressure. this is apparent from the size distribution of longﬁns from the lightly ﬁshed taieri river and waikaka stream, where females dominated the populations and the average length was considerably greater than in any strata of the other main rivers. broad et al. (2002) also found that longﬁn eels from inaccessible sites on the taieri river were larger on average than eels from accessible sites. these ﬁndings suggest that there may be substantial longﬁn females in the smaller tributaries with limited access that are not vulnerable to commercial ﬁshing. longﬁns further reserves of a signiﬁcant ﬁnding of the present study was the unexpected low proportion of female longﬁns from the main rivers sampled. similarly, in a more intensive study of the sex distribution of longﬁns in the aparima river, mccleave & jellyman (2004) also noted the virtual absence of females from the mainstem. in a virgin population, we would expect sex ratios to be balanced. the reduction in size of eels processed between the 1970s and the 1990s indicates that female numbers have declined relative to males. the expres- sion of sex in anguillids has been the subject of considerable debate over many years (e.g., tesch 1977). prevailing understanding is that the sex of eels is principally determined by eel density and that low density tends to favour development of females, and 438 high density, males. thus in lake environments, densities of the american eel (a. rostrata) tend to be low and eel populations are mainly females, whereas rivers tend to have high densities of mainly males (krueger & oliveira 1999; oliveira et al. 2001). similarly, continued stocking of an inland lake in ireland (lough neagh) with elvers over many years resulted in the sex ratio becoming increasingly skewed toward males – this was ascribed to the effect of overcrowding, and in response eels differentiated into males. wiberg (1983) concluded that sex is metagamic (environmentally determined) in the european eel as no heteromorphic (separate male and female) chro- mosomes were found. there is evidence that sex of the new zealand longﬁn is also environmentally deter- mined. for example, in the headwater lakes of the clutha river, hydro development has restricted access to juvenile eels and consequently the lakes are sparsely populated. only female longﬁns have been identiﬁed from these lakes (beentjes et al. 1997; beentjes 1998), and immature longﬁns transplanted from the lower clutha river into lake hawea differentiated exclu- sively into females (beentjes & jellyman 2003). extensive commercial eel ﬁshing in southland/otago rivers may have selectively removed the large top predators, resulting in high densities of small sub-legal size eels competing for similar resources. under these conditions, males would be favoured. this is suppor- ted by the ﬁnding that the females tend to be found in greater numbers in tributaries and less accessible areas where the population structure is more balanced and presumably resources are better partitioned among the sizes and sexes. the commercial ﬁshery may, therefore, have skewed the sex ratio towards males in two ways. first, by removing more females than males as females live longer and are vulnerable to capture for longer than males, and second, by promoting the differenti- ation of immature eels into males. a similar conclu- sion was reached by mccleave & jellyman (2004) from a consideration of the high proportion of males in the aparima river. however, it should be stated that this interpretation is speculative and requires further investigation. non-ﬁshing factors while we suggest that the eel species distribution, size structure and sex ratio have been altered by commer- cial ﬁshing, the impacts of non-ﬁshing factors have not been considered. it is likely that since the studies of cairns (1941) and burnet (1952), there have been extensive habitat modiﬁcation and degradation from anthropogenic activities such as channelisation of streams, hydro-electric dams, riparian zones, drainage of wetlands, and degradation of removal of habitat through nutrient enrichment (beentjes et al. 2005). in, addition, natural processes such as oceanic inﬂuences on recruitment may have contributed to the decline in longﬁn abundance, but are unlikely to have affected such attributes as size, sex ratio and distribu- tion within the river systems. any attempt to link these factors with eel population dynamics is at best speculative. acknowledgments this work was carried out as part of a ministry of fisheries programme to monitor commercial eel ﬁsheries
