(2007) used length–frequency distributions to describe the repro- ductive periodicity of eight english ﬁshes and docu- mented multiple spawning bouts in several species, but they were unable to determine if individual ﬁsh spawned multiple times. in contrast, studies based on laboratory observation and histology (e.g., gale & buynak 1982; burt et al. 1988; rinchard & kestemont 1996; blazer 2002) provide important information on the reproduc- tive activities of individual ﬁsh, but the time, expense and space required for such studies limit sample sizes, which in turn limits population-wide inferences. for these reasons, most studies use only one or two 528 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00303.x approaches when several methods may be required to fully understand the complex reproductive ecology of a species or group of species. many riverine cyprinids native to the great plains of north american are members of a reproductive guild that broadcast-spawns pelagic, semi-bouyant ova (platania & altenbach 1998). the reproductive success of this guild depends on the presence of streamﬂow adequate to keep ova and larval ﬁshes suspended in the water column so that they do not settle to the bottom where they are subjected to being covered with sediments and suffocated. in the past half-century, several members of this reproductive guild have declined in distribution and abundance as a result of construction of impoundments, habitat mod- iﬁcation, and diversion of surface and ground waters for agricultural and other uses (cross & moss 1987; pigg 1991; anderson et al. 1995; taylor et al. 1996; wilde & ostrand 1999; bonner & wilde 2000). these in declines have resulted in a renewed interest understanding the reproductive ecology of these species and, in particular, understanding the relation- ship between streamﬂow and spawning. initial obser- vations of arkansas river shiner notropis girardi hubbs and ortenburger (moore 1944) and plains minnow hybognathus placitus girard (sliger 1967) suggested a strict relationship between spawning and streamﬂow because efforts to collect ova were only successful during periods of elevated streamﬂow. subsequent studies based on juvenile growth rates (bestgen et al. 1989), length–frequency analyses (lehtinen & layzer 1988; bestgen et al. 1989), and gsi (lehtinen & layzer 1988; taylor & miller 1990) were consistent with this apparent relationship. in contrast, bottrell et al. (1964) found ova of peppered chub macrhybopsis in the cimarron river, oklahoma, throughout the summer and mentioned no particular relationship between the presence of ova and streamﬂow. more recently, studies based on ovarian histology of arkansas river shiner and peppered chub (bonner 2000) in the canadian river, texas and new mexico showed that individual ﬁsh spawned ova almost continuously throughout the reproductive season regardless of the magnitude of streamﬂow and that spawning occurred even during a monthlong period of drought when ﬁsh were conﬁned to isolated streambed pools. it is unclear whether differences in the reported relationship between streamﬂow and spawning by these species are due to interspeciﬁc variation in reproductive ecology (e.g., kramer 1978; lobo´ n-cervia´ et al. 1996; nunn et al. 2007) or an artefact of the different approaches used in individual studies. however, the overall similarity in the reproductive ecology of members of this reproductive guild (platania & altenbach 1998) and the conﬂicting evidence for tetranema (girard) reproductive ecology of a broadcast-spawning cyprinid arkansas river shiner suggest that not all reported differences are due to interspeciﬁc variation in repro- ductive ecology. the smalleye shiner notropis buccula cross is endemic to the brazos river, texas and historically was common throughout the entire length of the river. as with other great plains cyprinid ﬁshes, the smalleye shiner has undergone a marked reduction in range and abundance and the species now comprises a single population that is restricted to the unimpounded upper third of the basin (moss & mayes 1993; ostrand & wilde 2002). smalleye shiner is currently recogni- sed as a candidate species under the united states endangered species act (united states department of the interior 2002). except for studies on distribution and abundance (moss & mayes 1993), diet (marks et al. 2001), and tolerance to physical and chemical conditions (ostrand & wilde 2001), no other biolog- ical the smalleye shiner. in particular, there is no published information on its reproductive ecology. the purposes of this study were to: (i) document the reproductive biology and ecology of this imperiled species, (ii) use a combination of approaches to characterise individual and population patterns in reproduction and (iii) determine how those patterns are related to variation in streamﬂow. information exists for study area the brazos river forms in western texas and ﬂows east and south for approximately 2000 km before discharg- ing into the gulf of mexico at freeport. mean annual precipitation is 75 cm but ranges from 40 cm in the north-west to 120 cm in the south-east (hendrickson 2002). our study was conducted in the upper portion of the brazos river where precipitation during the year is sporadic and localised, leading to variable and erratic streamﬂow (echelle et al. 1972). two tributaries, the salt fork and double mountain fork combine to form the mainstem of the brazos river at their conﬂuence in north-eastern stonewall county, texas. the upper brazos river and its tributaries typically become intermittent during summer months. when this occurs, all surface water is restricted to isolated streambed pools (echelle et al. 1972; wilde & ostrand 1999). in general, the upper brazos river and its tributaries are shallow, with braided channels ﬂowing over sand and clay substrate and a distinct lack of instream vegetation or shading canopy (ostrand & wilde 2002). methods field collections we established three sampling sites on the upper brazos river (fig. 1). sites were selected to provide a 529 durham & wilde n o rth f ork d o u ble m o u ntain f ork brazos river doublemountain f o r k

collect smalleye shiner. site 1 was on the mainstem of the brazos river in baylor county, texas (33°34¢9¢¢n; 99°16¢1¢¢w). site 2 was on the mainstem of in knox county, texas (33°30¢03¢¢n; 99°48¢1¢¢w). site 3 was on the double mountain fork of the brazos river in fisher county, texas (32°55¢8¢¢n; 100°29¢3¢¢w). smalleye shiner occur in the salt fork of the brazos river only for short periods when freshets reduce the naturally high salinity in this tributary. thus, we did not establish a sampling site on the salt fork. we obtained stream- ﬂow data for each site from the united states geological survey surface water monitoring station nearest that site. for the brazos river mainstem sites (sites 1 and 2), data were from the same station, number 08082500 at site 1 and approximately 50 km downstream from site 2. data for site 3 were from station number 08080500, approximately 30-km downstream from the sampling site. the study portion of the upper brazos river is unimpounded and, in each case, no tributaries enter between the sampling sites and water-monitoring stations that were used. thus, the monitoring stations used provided a good estimate of streamﬂow at each sampling site. we collected ﬁsh monthly at each site from april 2003 through march 2005, except during the sus- pected spawning season, may through september, when samples were collected twice each month. at each site on each date, we sampled for approx- imately 1 h using a 3.7 · 1.8-m seine (5-mm mesh). naturally high conductivity in this portion of the brazos river precludes the use of electroﬁshing as a 530 primary or complementary collection method. we seined ﬁsh from main channel, side channel and backwater habitats on each sampling date. the distance of river sampled on each date varied with streamﬂow conditions, but ranged between 300 and 1500 m. adult smalleye shiner were preserved in 10% buffered formalin and transported to texas tech university. high discharge conditions prevented col- lection of ﬁsh in the brazos river mainstem on the second sampling date in june 2003 and at all sites in november 2004. hereafter, we use 2003 to refer to the period between april 2003 and march 2004, and 2004 to refer to the period between april 2004 and march 2005. ovarian development for each sampling site and date, we set a target of 25 sexually mature standard length) for dissection and

cyprinid reach the target sample size (table 1). for each ﬁsh in the sample, gonads were removed and sex was determined by macroscopic inspection. we classiﬁed gonads of all female ﬁsh into one of four stages of ovarian development based on appearance. regressed ovaries had no evidence of developing oocytes. recrudescent ovaries contained small translucent oocytes in the early stages of yolk deposition. mature ovaries contained many large cream-coloured, vitell- ogenic oocytes. ovaries that were ﬂaccid and con- tained few or no vitellogenic ova were classiﬁed as spent. ovaries and testes were weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g. gonad weights were used to calculate a gsi [gsi = (gonad weight ⁄ total body weight) · 100]. mean gsi was calculated separately for males and females for each site and date by summing gsi for individuals and dividing by the number of males and females in each sample, respectively. unless otherwise speciﬁed, gsi is presented as the mean of samples taken at each site on each date. oocyte development for each site and date, we selected ﬁve females with mature ovaries for histological analyses and oocyte counts. however, there were instances when samples contained fewer than ﬁve females with mature ovaries. thus, sample size for each site and date ranged from zero to ﬁve ﬁshes. we used one ovary from each ﬁsh for histological analysis and the other to determine number and size distribution of vitellogenic oocytes (see below). preparation of ovaries for histological analysis followed crim & glebe (1990), hinton (1990) and patin˜o & takashima (1995). ovaries were embedded in parafﬁn and sectioned longitudinally at a thickness of 5–7 lm. three to ﬁve sections from the approximate middle of each ovary were ﬁxed to a microscope slide and stained with weigert’s haematoxylin and eosin stain. slides were viewed under a compound micro- scope at 40· magniﬁcation and each oocyte in one complete section of each ovary was classiﬁed into one of the following groups: perinucleolar, cortical alveoli, early vitellogenic, late vitellogenic, germinal vesicle breakdown and postovulatory follicle. oocyte size and fecundity we used one ovary to assess oocyte size distributions and obtain estimates of fecundity. we attached a counting wheel to the stage of a dissecting microscope and ﬁlled the well of the counting wheel with water. we placed each ovary in the well and separated individual oocytes from each other using forceps. we counted all vitellogenic oocytes and measured the diameter of at least 100 randomly selected oocytes from each ovary to the nearest 0.1 mm with a calibrated ocular micrometre. 531 durham & wilde statistical analyses we compared mean gsi among years, sites and sampling dates by ﬁtting a generalised linear model to the data. we used the genmod procedure in sas statistical software (cary, north carolina, usa) to conduct our analyses. because samples were collected at the same sites on each sampling date, we treated site as a repeated measure in all models. we ﬁt models to the data using a normal error distribution with an identity link function. because generalised linear models are ﬁt to data using maximum likelihood methods, signiﬁcance was based on the chi-squared distribution. if year was a signiﬁcant predictor of gsi, calculated as the mean of all sites and dates within a year combined (a = 0.05), we recoded year as a class variable to evaluate differences in gsi between sites and sampling dates within that year. if year was not a signiﬁcant predictor of gsi, we evaluated differences among sites and sampling dates across years. when gsi differed signiﬁcantly among sites, we used the contrast option in the genmod procedure to evaluate the pair-wise site differences. we assessed the relationship between streamﬂow and reproductive output during each spawning season with a linear regression model that compared the running average of daily mean streamﬂow between sampling dates and differences in mean female gsi between sampling dates. we reasoned that any inﬂu- ence of streamﬂow on reproductive output would be reﬂected in changes in mean female gsi from one sampling date to the next. because we anticipated a high degree of variability in male gsi, we did not expect to observe nor did we test for this relationship in males. results ovarian development recrudescent ovaries in females typically appeared in march during both years, but were observed as early as february at site 3 in 2004. ovaries developed rapidly and mature ovaries were the most common ovarian stage found from may to august in 2003 and from april to august in 2004. spent ovaries began to appear in june of 2003 and july of 2004 and increased in frequency in both years until october, when ovaries of most ﬁsh had returned to a regressed state. mean gsi of females ranged from 1.5% to 26.1% in 2003 and from 0.7% to 18.5% in 2004 (fig. 2). female gsi at all three sites increased in early may in both years, peaked in late may, and generally remained elevated until late august. in 2003, gsi peaked in late may and then declined steadily. in 2004, gsi remained elevated and peaked multiple 532 times before rapidly decreasing in august. female gsi was lower in 2003 than in 2004 (v2 = 18.74; d.f. = 1; p = <0.0001). in 2003, gsi differed among sampling dates (v2 = 12.53; d.f. = 1; p = 0.0004) and sites (v2 = 19.24; d.f. = 2; p = <0.0001). pair-wise con- trasts indicated that the only difference was between sites 1 and 3 with female gsi being larger at site 1. in 2004, gsi differed among sampling dates (v2 = 7.36; d.f. = 1; p = <0.0067) but not among sites (v2 = 1.62; d.f. = 2; p = 0.44). there was a signiﬁcant relation- ship between streamﬂow and female gsi in both 2003 (r = )0.65; n = 26; 2004 (r = )0.38; n = 28; p = 0.044). the relationship for 2004 was stronger yet (r = )0.61; n = 26; p = 0.001) if we omitted two observations for the ﬁrst august sampling date, which encompassed a record high streamﬂow event that occurred at sites 1 and 2. p = 0.0003) and mean gsi of males ranged from 0.4% to 3.0% in 2003 and from 0.4% to 2.3% in 2004. overall, male gsi was lower in 2003 than in 2004 (v2 = 11.89; d.f. = 1; p = 0.0006). male gsi generally increased in april and may and remained elevated through september in both years of the study. male gsi was lower in 2003 than in 2004 (v2 = 11.89; d.f. = 1; p = 0.0006). in 2003, gsi differed among sampling dates (v2 = 7.59; d.f. = 1; p = 0.0059) but not sites (v2 = 0.91; d.f. = 2; p = <0.63). in 2004, gsi differed among sampling dates (v2 = 8.68; d.f. = 1; p = <0.0032) d.f. = 2; p = 0.0047). pair-wise contrasts indicated the only difference was between sites 2 and 3, with gsi being greater at site 3.

hunter et al. 1986; clarke 1987; fitzhugh & hettler 1995), although this has not been conﬁrmed for smalleye shiner. on most sampling dates, the proportion of postovulatory follicles was low com- pared with the other stages, which indicates that individual ﬁsh periodically ovulate and spawn small complements of late vitellogenic oocytes throughout the protracted reproductive season. however, ovaries from ﬁsh collected at site 1 in mid-june in 2003 (fig. 3) and at site 3 in late june in 2004 (fig. 4) contained a greater proportion of postovulatory folli- cles and a smaller proportion of late vitellogenic oocytes than typically observed, indicating that there are instances when larger complements of late vitell- ogenic oocytes are ovulated and spawned. oocyte size and fecundity in several across all samples, vitellogenic oocytes ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 mm in diameter. instances, individual ﬁsh contained oocytes that spanned this same range. oocyte size distributions showed evi- dence of several distinct synchronised spawning events within the population (figs 5 and 6). for example, a major shift from predominantly large 533 durham & wilde 16 april 2003 14 may 2003 28 may 2003 16 june 2003 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ) % ( y c n e u q e r f 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf 15 july 2003 29 july 2003 17 august 2003 28 august 2003 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf 6 september 2003 20 september 2003 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf fig. 3. relative abundance of oocytes classiﬁed as cortical alveoli (ca), early vitellogenic (ev), late vitellogenic (lv), germinal vesicle breakdown (gb) or postovulatory follicles (pf) for female smalleye shiner collected from the brazos river on each sampling date during the 2003 reproductive season at site 1. the ﬁve panels under each date represent individual ﬁsh. empty panels indicate dates on which samples contained fewer than ﬁve females with mature ovaries. oocytes on one sampling date to smaller oocytes on the following sampling date occurred between samples taken in late may and mid-june in 2003 (fig. 5). this shift in the size distribution of vitellogenic oocytes corresponded to a peak, and subsequent decrease, in female gsi in 2003 (fig. 2). in 2004, shifts in oocyte size occurred between the two june samples and between late july and mid-august 534 24 april 2004 7 may 2004 21 may 2004 2 june 2004 reproductive ecology of a broadcast-spawning cyprinid 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf 24 june 2004 9 july 2004 24 july 2004 15 august 2004 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf 28 august 2004 20 september 2004 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 50 0 ) % ( y c n e u q e r f ca ev lv gb pf ca ev lv gb pf fig. 4. relative abundance of oocytes classiﬁed as cortical alveoli (ca), early vitellogenic (ev), late vitellogenic (lv), germinal vesicle breakdown (gb) or postovulatory follicles (pf) for female smalleye shiner collected from the brazos river on each sampling date during the 2004 reproductive season at site 3. the ﬁve panels under each date represent individual ﬁsh. empty panels indicate dates on which samples contained fewer than ﬁve females with mature ovaries.

rinchard & kestemont 1996; bonner 2000). in contrast, single spawning species typically have gsi characterised by an extended period of recrudescence that may last up to 9 months during which time gsi gradually increases before reaching a single peak and rapidly decreasing after a 536 distributions fig. 5. size–frequency of vitellogenic oocytes from ovaries of female smalleye shiner collected from the brazos river, texas during the 2003 reproductive season. single spawning bout (malison et al. 1994; rinchard & kestemont 1996). further deﬁnitive evidence of multiple spawning by smalleye shiner was provided by histological examination of ovarian tissue, which revealed that oocytes in all stages of development were present on nearly every sampling date between april and september. ovaries of multiple spawning ﬁsh typically contain oocytes in two or more stages of development (wallace & selman 1981; heins & rabito 1986; ali & kadir 1996), whereas single spawning species have only one complement of vitellogenic oocytes each year that progress together through the different developmental stages (phillip 1993; blazer 2002). our histological analyses revealed the presence of a small proportion of postovulatory follicles in the ovaries of at least one ﬁsh on nearly all sampling dates. in addition, the proportion of postovulatory follicles observed on most sampling dates was small 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 20 0 ) % ( y c n e u q e r f 2003 2004 distributions fig. 6. size–frequency of vitellogenic oocytes from ovaries of female smalleye shiner collected from the brazos river, texas during the 2004 reproductive season. s e t y c o o c n e g o i l l e t i v f o r e b m u n n a e m 600 400 200 l i r p a i y a m i i y a m i e n u j i i e n u j l i y u j i i y u j l i g u a i i g u a i t p e s i i t p e s fig. 7. mean number of vitellogenic oocytes in the ovaries of female smalleye shiner collected from the brazos river, texas during the 2003 and 2004 reproductive seasons. roman numerals indicate the ﬁrst (i) or second (ii) sampling date for months in which two samples were collected. female smalleye shiner was not collected on the ﬁrst sampling date in september 2003. compared with the proportion of late vitellogenic oocytes and indicates that individual ﬁsh within the population asynchronously ovulate and spawn small reproductive ecology of a broadcast-spawning cyprinid 24 april 2004 site 1 site 2 site 3 7 may 2004 21 may 2004 1 june 2004 24 june 2004 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 20 0 40 9 july 2004 23 july 2004 14 august 2004 28 august 2004 18 september 2004 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 0 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 oocyte diameter (mm) batches of late vitellogenic oocytes throughout the reproductive reproductive season. however, other analyses (oocyte size distributions) indicated that individual ﬁsh periodically spawn larger batches of oocytes in synchrony with other individuals. several distinct shifts in oocyte diameter from predominantly large oocytes on one sampling date to smaller oocytes on the following sampling date were observed during both years of the study. these shifts in oocyte size also corresponded to dates on which major decreases in female gsi were observed. in each case, shifts in oocyte size and decreases in female gsi were associated with increases in streamﬂow. for example, the major shift in oocyte size and female gsi observed in 2003 occurred between the late may and mid-june sampling dates, which also corresponded to the greatest peak in streamﬂow in that year. in 2004, shifts in oocyte size and female gsi were observed between the early june and late june sampling dates and again between the late july and mid-august sampling dates. these observations were further supported by the signiﬁcance of our regression models which indicated that reproductive output increased during elevated streamﬂow events. thus, patterns in oocyte development (from histology), oocyte size 537 durham & wilde distribution and gsi observed in both years demon- strated that smalleye shiner spawn asynchronously throughout a protracted reproductive period except during periods of elevated streamﬂow when spawning becomes synchronised within the population. the results of our study challenge the prevailing paradigm of a strict association between spawning and periods of elevated streamﬂow for pelagic, broadcast- spawning cyprinids in the great plains of north america. our results also highlight the importance of using multiple approaches when studying the complex reproductive ecology of some ﬁshes. for instance, if we had only studied smalleye shiner gsi and oocyte size distributions we likely would have concluded, as have others using these approaches (sliger 1967; lehtinen & layzer 1988; taylor & miller 1990), that reproduction was exclusively tied to elevated dis- charge events. similarly, if we had only used histol- ogy, we would likely have concluded that discharge has only a minor inﬂuence on spawning (e.g., bonner 2000). concurrent use of multiple lines of evidence revealed that each of the previous studies, which in some instances appeared contradictory, were actually partially correct but provided an incomplete picture of the reproductive ecology of this guild. oocyte size distributions and gsi clearly showed that synchron- ised spawning occurred in conjunction with elevated discharge, but lacked the detail at the level of the individual to show that asynchronous spawning also occurred. on the other hand, the histological evidence (i.e., presence of postovulatory follicles) clearly showed that spawning occurred almost continuously regardless of the magnitude of streamﬂow. however, because sampling was conducted at approximately 2-week intervals and postovulatory follicles were transient the synchronous spawning revealed by the other methods was not apparent from the histology. peared from collections after the end of may, suggesting that age-2 individuals spawn early in the season and experience high postspawning mortality. a similar disappearance of individuals early in the reproductive season has been reported for the european minnow phoxinus phoxinus (l.) (mills 1987), plains minnow (taylor & miller 1990) and sand shiner notropis stramineus (cope) (summerfelt & minckley 1969). the oldest except for the largest peak in may of 2003, female gsi was lower and peaked fewer times in 2003 than in 2004. this difference was possibly related to differences in streamﬂow that occurred between the 2 years of our study. streamﬂow during the 2003 reproductive season was extremely low as a result of drought conditions in the upper brazos river basin. all discharge ceased and the river was conﬁned to a series of isolated pools during the entire month of august at sites 1 and 2 and from mid-july to late august at site 3. streamﬂow during the 2004 reproductive season, although variable, was consis- tently greater than in 2003 and the river ﬂowed continuously during the reproductive season. thus, there was a greater number of opportunities for ﬁsh to spawn larger batches of ova and to continuously recruit and develop new cohorts of oocytes during 2004 than in 2003. in addition, during periods of intermittent discharge such as those that occurred in 2003, ﬁsh are conﬁned in pools where physical and chemical conditions become increasingly extreme (huntsman 1955; barlow 1958; rutledge & beitinger 1989; mundahl 1990; marks et al. 2001; ostrand & wilde 2001). effects of these harsh conditions could be manifested in a redirection of energy resources from reproductive pathways to somatic maintenance as conditions become increas- ingly extreme. 1942; bailey spawning within in both years of the this pattern may simply reﬂect the study, ovaries contained approximately twice as many vitellogenic oocytes during the ﬁrst half of the reproductive season as in the latter half. in each case, a substantial decrease in the mean number of oocytes was observed by mid- june, following instances of elevated discharge and population. synchronous thus, the general reproductive strategy of to develop vitellogenic oocytes early in the reproductive season, but to delay major spawning events until streamﬂow conditions are optimum for survival of offspring (wootton 1990; moyle 2000). alternatively, variation in the age structure of the population throughout the reproductive season, coupled with differences in age-speciﬁc fecundity (durham 2007), may be responsible for differences in oocyte number. indeed, bonner (2000) reported that the oldest (age 2) arkansas river shiner and peppered chub disap- some stream ﬁshes 538 least annual growth increments on otoliths of smalleye shiner indicate that relatively few individuals reach age 2 and none survive their second year (durham 2007). therefore, most individuals have only one reproductive season. such short-lived organisms have a very narrow window for reproduction and, if the population is to persist, must have strategies that ensure at some offspring are successfully produced each season. the reproductive ecology of the smalleye shiner documented in this study appears to be well suited to the extremely variable and unpredictable environmental conditions that prevail in the upper brazos river, texas. the multiple spawning strategy and protracted reproductive season is strategy commonly observed in short-lived species and those that (starrett 1951; lambert & ware 1984; weddle & burr 1991; lowerre-barbieri et al. 1996; rinchard & kestemont inhabit harsh environments reproductive bet-hedging a classic 1996). asynchronous spawning of small batches of ova throughout the reproductive season ensures that some reproduction occurs during each year regardless of environmental conditions, without sacriﬁcing the ability of large numbers of ﬁsh to spawn in synchrony during periods of elevated discharge when conditions for survival of offspring are optimal. in addition to documenting the reproductive ecol- ogy of smalleye shiner, the results of our study suggest several important considerations for conservation of other broadcast-spawning cyprinids. the presence of postovulatory follicles in the ovaries of smalleye shiner (this study), and arkansas river shiner and peppered chub (bonner 2000) throughout the repro- ductive season deﬁnitively show that spawning occurs under a wide range of environmental conditions, including when ﬁsh were conﬁned to isolated pools. thus, the observed decrease in distribution and abundance of these species does not appear to result from a lack of spawning. instead, we conclude, as have others, that environmental conditions have a greater impact on recruitment and population dynam- ics after spawning has occurred (mills & mann 1985; nunn et al. 2003; durham & wilde 2006; durham 2007; wilde & durham in press) and recommend focusing conservation efforts on these early life stages. studies of recruitment patterns for several north american broadcast-spawning species by durham & wilde (2006) and durham (2007) indicate that the continuous presence of discharge in the river is the most critical factor determining successful recruit- ment. thus, our results suggest the potential for using supplemental discharge from upstream reservoirs or other sources, if available, to support the conservation of imperiled broadcast-spawning cyprinids. water releases, if used properly, would not only enhance reproductive output by eliciting synchronised spawn- ing events but would also help maintain conditions suitable for survival of ova and young larvae (i.e., eliminate periods of intermittent ﬂow). water release strategies in other systems have shown promise for improving the management and conservation of a number of individual species (webb et al. 2001; jeffres et al. 2006; mitchell & cunjak 2007) as well as for entire ﬁsh assemblages (dudley & platania 2007; godinho et al. 2007). however, the timing of these actions for broadcast-spawning cyprinids in the great plains of north america is an important consideration because studies have shown that repro- ductive potential and output is greater during the earlier portion of the reproductive season (bonner 2000; durham & wilde 2006; this study) and that growth of juvenile ﬁshes spawned early in the reproductive season can be signiﬁcantly greater than that of ﬁsh spawned later in the season (durham & wilde 2005). reproductive ecology of a broadcast-spawning cyprinid acknowledgements we thank p. bean, c.
