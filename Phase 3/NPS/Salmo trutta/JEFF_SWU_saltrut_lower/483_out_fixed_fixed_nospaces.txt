furthermore, this competition had the potential to be interspeciﬁc as evidenced by resource overlap. s.w. raborn1, l.e. miranda1, m.t. driscoll1,2 1mississippi cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, mississippi state, ms, usa, 2present address: texas parks and wildlife department, route 2 p.o. box 535, jasper, tx 75951, usa key words: exploitative competition;

muth & wolfert 1986; marwitz & hubert 1997; cavalli et al. 1998). more deﬁnitive evidence of competition among ﬁsh species has been disclosed by ﬁeld experiments with amenable species (e.g., mittelbach 1988), and by lake manipulations (e.g., hodson et al. 1991). neverthe- less, logistical limitations often prevent system-wide control and the mobility of some species prevents the use of smaller scale experiments representative of the natural environment. thus, the search for evidence of competition among predators in large lakes and reservoirs will likely continue to rely on surveys that provide indirect clues. reduced predator performance (e.g., growth, condi- tion and biomass) is ordinarily associated with com- petition for ﬁnite prey. in an attempt to remedy reduced performance, sometimes the harvest and stocking of predators is adjusted (jenkins & morais 1978; eck & brown 1985; ney & orth 1986), or the density of prey species is augmented (devries & stein 1990; hale 1996). such management actions often coincide with assessments of the prey–predator balance, which take on many forms – balance indices (swingle 1950), stock density indices (anderson 1976), available-prey- to-predator ratio (jenkins & morais 1978) and most recently, supply–demand analyses (reviewed by ney 1990). these assessments are used to understand better the relationships between predators and their prey, but the temporal scale of measurement for these methods is usually 1 year. given that levels of predator food requirements and prey production are seasonal, it is likely that competition among predators for limited prey is seasonal as well. for species to compete they must overlap in their use of resources, which can be measured with several indices (gotelli & graves 1996). however, informa- tion on diet overlap alone is insufﬁcient to test the presence or severity of exploitative competition (colwell & futuyma 1971), because low overlap could result from past competition that has caused predators to switch to alternative prey (i.e., ghost of competition past; connell 1980). conversely, signiﬁ- cant overlap may occur with no competition if predators sharing abundant prey resources. accompanying information about how well predators are meeting their resource needs could facilitate interpretation of overlap indices. to this end, we combined seasonal estimates of diet overlap among predators in norris reservoir, tennessee, with their consumption dynamics to predict the times of the year when interspeciﬁc exploitative competition would be most likely or severe. are methods for intraspeciﬁc exploitative competition to occur a resource must be limited. when this resource is shared exploitative competition among piscivores among two or more species, competition can be interspeciﬁc as well. thus, our methods consisted of two exercises: (i) estimating the extent to which prey resources were shared by measuring diet overlap and (ii) assessing prey limitations by measuring how well predators achieved their energy requirements. we used a similarity index (pianka 1973) to estimate the extent to which predator diets overlapped. the assessment of prey limitations was more indirect. the dynamics of competition within a given year depend upon changes in both prey supply (deﬁned as prey that is morpho- logically, behaviorally and spatially available; ney 1990) and predator demand (deﬁned as consumption necessary to maximise production). various approa- ches can be used to assess these dynamics. for instance, ﬂuctuations in prey density could be mon- itored to identify shortage periods; however, in addition to prey density, this approach requires simultaneous knowledge of predator demand and feeding efﬁciency. instead, our approach was to index how well predators realised their seasonal energy needs. the energy requirements of ectotherms are dependent upon animal size, rate of growth and ambient temperature. we used bioenergetics modelling to account for these effects and measure the extent to which energy needs were met. study reservoir norris reservoir (36.25°n, 83.95°w), is a 13 843-ha (full pool) impoundment created in 1936 north of knoxville (tennessee, usa). norris is a deep and dendritic tributary reservoir characterised by steep shorelines, limited littoral habitat and substantial annual water level ﬂuctuation (potential of c. 18 m). the major inﬂows are the clinch and powell rivers that drain mostly forested areas of eastern tennessee and south-western virginia. fertility is low, classiﬁed as mesotrophic in the headwaters and oligotrophic in the lower sectors. thermal stratiﬁcation occurs from midsummer to early autumn. the ﬁsh community includes both introduced and endemic predatory and prey species. after impound- ment, the dominant predators were smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu, spotted bass m. punctulatus, largemouth bass m. salmoides, white crappie pomoxis annularis, black crappie p. nigromaculatus and wall- eye sander vitreum. beginning in the 1960s, striped bass morone saxatilis, black basses micropterus spp., crappies pomoxis spp. and percids sander spp. were stocked by the tennessee wildlife resources agency to control prey and enhance ﬁsheries. except for striped bass, reproduce naturally; these striped bass are maintained by annual stockings (mean ¼ 13 ha )1 from 1983 to 1995; range ¼ 7–19). other resident predators were gars lepisosteus spp., species 277 raborn et al. channel catﬁsh ictalurus punctatus, ﬂathead catﬁsh pylodictis olivaris, white bass morone chrysops and sauger s. canadense. historically, prey ﬁshes consisted primarily of gizzard shad dorosoma cepedianum, threadﬁn shad d. petenense, cyprinids (notropis spp. and pimephales spp.), and lepomids lepomis spp.; since 1991, introduced alewife alosa pseudoharengus have become abundant throughout the reservoir. field collections predator collections were made monthly throughout the reservoir during october 1996 to september 1997 with experimental gill nets, electroﬁshing and fyke nets as described by raborn et al. (2003). for each specimen collected we recorded species, total length (mm), weight (g), and size of gillnet mesh in which specimens were captured. otoliths were extracted from ﬁve ﬁsh per centimetre length group, and stomach contents were removed from all specimens as per van den ayvle & roussel (1980). striped bass, large- mouth bass, black crappie and walleye were included in this study; catﬁshes, smallmouth bass, spotted bass, white crappie and sauger were targeted for collection, but sample sizes prevented adequate description of their diets. insufﬁcient diet overlap (mostly bluegill), (iii) lepomis spp. diet compositions were described from stomach samples based on weight of prey items identiﬁed to the lowest possible taxon. methods for estimating diet compositions are described in raborn et al. (2003). categories of prey included: (i) dorosoma spp. (ii) alewife, (iv) micropterus spp., (v) other ﬁsh (primarily cyprinids), (vi) crayﬁshes orconectes spp., (vii) other prey (oligochaetes, amphibians and unidentiﬁed prey). analyses included the period october 1996 to september 1997. x pianka’s (1973) niche overlap index was used to quantify diet overlap of targeted species, expressed as: o21¼o12¼ ð1þ h x ðp 2iþ2 ðp 1iþ2 p 2ip 1i x i  0:5 where o21 is the overlap in resource use of species 2 on species 1; o12, overlap in resource use of species 1 on species 2; p2i, frequency utilisation of resource state i by species 2; p1i, frequency utilisation of resource state i by species 1. overlap values range from 0 (no shared prey) to 1 (identical prey utilisation) and were calculated by season (december to february, winter; march to may, spring; june to august, summer; september to november, autumn) with all age groups combined. signiﬁcance of diet overlap values (<0.1 probability of observing by chance a 278 value greater than the one observed) was determined with a monte carlo simulation technique (applied with ecosim software developed by gotelli & entsminger 2004) as described by driscoll & miranda (1999). relative consumption as an index of prey shortages the proportion of maximum consumption (p, observed consumption divided by potential maximum consump- tion; more below) at which a ﬁsh feeds has been considered an index of prey availability (rice et al. 1983; brandt & kirsch 1993; hartman & brandt 1995). this value can range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing no feeding and 1 indicating the ﬁsh is feeding at the maximum rate (based on individual size and water temperature). unless predators are deliber- ately not maximising consumption, changes in p may indicate changes in prey availability (hartman & brandt 1995). maximum consumption has been estimated for many species in the laboratory by ad libitum feeding trials (compiled by hanson et al. 1997). the maximum consumption achieved by ﬁsh in laboratory trials likely overestimates what they could achieve in their natural environment. in a natural setting, achieving maximum consumption may not be cost-effective because of the extra energy used during activity. during feeding experiments, much of the activity associated with search and capture of prey is removed; thus, wild ﬁsh seldom achieve p ¼ 1 even in the presence of an abundant prey supply. nevertheless, when p is used to index how well ﬁsh meet their energy needs, it is of no consequence how far it deviates from 1; what matters is how p changes over time. an estimate of p was made for each species, age and month (12 months in all beginning in october 1996) combination. as diet overlap estimates were not age- speciﬁc, p represented an average across ages to facilitate simultaneous interpretation of overlap values and consumption patterns. furthermore, p was aver- aged across months within the four seasons, resulting in four estimates of p that corresponded to the four seasonal estimates of diet overlap. during this avera- ging, each p value was weighted by the sample size used to estimate diet composition for species, age and month combination. additionally, p estimates for each species were relativised by converting to standard normal deviates (z-scores) based on the distribution of scores across relativised p, termed here pr, indexed how well predators met their energy needs throughout the year. our reasoning was that during periods when prey resources decreased or predator metabolic rates increased, pr decreased; we interpreted these periods as having greater possibilities for exploitative competition. seasons. this the four the p value is the proportion of the potential maxi- mum consumption realised. estimation of maximum consumption was described above; observed con- sumption was estimated with the ‘wisconsin’ bioen- ergetics model (kitchell et al. 1977). methods and physiological parameters for bioenergetics modelling and their component algorithms are voluminous and have been extensively described in the literature (e.g., brandt & hartman 1993 and associated papers in the same journal issue; roell & orth 1993; hanson et al. 1997). information required for estimating p with these models included physiological data (energy densities of predators and prey; species-speciﬁc phy- siological parameters of consumers relating to tem- perature dependence and allometric weight functions) and site-speciﬁc information (ambient temperature, diet composition and individual growth). the reader is referred to raborn et al. (2002, 2003) for methods and data associated with the bioenergetics models that were speciﬁc to this research. results a total of 1135 striped bass (279–1,105 mm total length), 589 largemouth bass (95–592 mm), 237 black crappie (146–356 mm) and 1289 walleye (255–681 mm) were sampled for stomach contents (fig. 1). alewife and dorosoma spp. were the dom- inant prey items for most predators during most seasons; although, largemouth bass also relied sub- stantially on lepomis spp. and micropterus spp. exploitative competition among piscivores striped bass and walleye exploited dorosoma spp. heavily in winter, but increased their consumption of alewife in other seasons, especially summer. black crappie diets consisted almost entirely of dorosoma spp., except during spring when their predation on alewife increased. for each season six possible species combinations were available for diet overlap analysis (table 1). due to low sample sizes of black crappie (n < 10) in summer and autumn, only winter and spring compar- isons were possible. overall, 16 of the 18 comparisons showed predator diets to be more similar than would be expected because of chance alone. inconclusive comparisons resulted between largemouth bass and both striped bass and walleye during summer, indicat- ing that largemouth bass utilised slightly different prey during this time. if the overlap value had been low enough for diets to be signiﬁcantly dissimilar, we would have interpreted this ﬁnding as largemouth bass utilising entirely different prey. diets for all other comparisons were signiﬁcantly similar. for largemouth bass and black crappie, prwas least during spring and autumn and greatest during summer and winter (fig. 2). for striped bass and walleye, pr increased from spring to a summer climax and then declined throughout the autumn to reach seasonal low in winter. combining the results from the diet overlap analysis and consumption patterns, summer exhibited the least potential for interspeciﬁc competition. during 100 75 50 25 t n e c r e p t n e c r e p 100 75 50 25 0 spring 85 81 33 45 0 large m outh bass striped bass black crappie w alleye fall other prey

largemouth bass and black crappie were also less likely to be affected by competition. competition among all predators was more likely during spring and autumn and more likely for striped bass and walleye during winter. discussion prediction uncertainties our predictions undeniably have uncertainties. the assessment of diet overlap contains error associated with estimation of diet composition. ricklefs & lau (1980) argued that bias is a concern when sample sizes are small and the overlap index is >0.8. for our comparisons, sample sizes were never <14, and over them >50 with several near or >100. half of furthermore, only three of the 18 comparisons exhibited overlap values >0.8 while having samples sizes <25 for one of the predators in the paired comparison. in all, our assessment that the predator community shared prey resources during much of the year is likely an accurate inference from the data. estimates of p probably carry uncertainty originating from inaccuracies in measures of diet composition, growth and physiological parameters included in the bioenergetics models. although sampling of diets spanned only 1 year, estimates of diet composition concurred with those made in other reservoirs for striped bass (combs 1980; matthews et al. 1988), largemouth bass (timmons et al. 1981; storck 1986), black crappie (reid 1950; ball & kilambi 1972) and walleye (jester 1971; boaze & lackey 1974), and those of earlier studies in norris reservoir (dendy 1946; fitz & holbrook 1978). we are conﬁdent about our estimates of growth because the methodology is well established, and samples sizes were relatively high (raborn et al. 2003). attempts to validate bioenergetics models by comparing model predictions with empirical data have not always been successful (e.g., minton & mcclean 1982; rice & cochran 1984; hartman & brandt 1995), but sensitivity analyses 1.50 0.75 0.00 ) e r o c s - z (  r p –0.75 –1.50 280 black crappie largemouth bass striped bass walleye spring

normal deviates (z-scores) based on the distribution of scores across the four seasons to create an index (pr) of how well predators met their energy needs throughout the year. results are fairly robust (e.g., stewart et al. 1983; bartell et al. 1986) have concluded that model to uncertainty in most of the input parameters applied to our model. overall, we are conﬁdent that estimates of p are not astray because they were based on diet compositions, growth estimates and model parameters deemed reasonable. seasonal diet patterns prey availability can be restricted by prey density, behaviour, morphology and distribution (ney 1990), all of which likely had bearing on the observed diet patterns of predators in norris reservoir. our diet descriptions for striped bass, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye showed clupeids (dorosoma spp. and alewife) to be the dominant prey. clupeids are more numerous in norris reservoir than all other prey ﬁshes combined (raborn 2000) and numerical prey availability may inﬂuence prey choice (lyons 1987; sih & moore 1990). einfalt & wahl (1997) suggested that the escape behaviour of clupeids might render them more susceptible to predation than lepomids; they found bluegill to rely on manoeuvrability for escape, whereas gizzard shad relied on schooling. morphologically, alewife and threadﬁn shad are more available than lepomids because they possess soft rays instead of spines (einfalt & wahl 1997) and generally do not grow beyond the gape width limitations of most predators. spatial distributions of predators and prey also affect prey availability. predation on alewife by striped bass and walleye increased during summer, a time when both predators may have been spatially restricted. during summer lake stratiﬁcation, striped bass and walleye can be vertically conﬁned between heated surface waters above and hypoxic waters below (i.e., the thermal squeeze hypothesis; coutant 1985). alewife, a pelagic species, may have been more spatially available to these predators, which were hindered in their potential foraging movements. ale- wife co-occurred with striped bass and walleye more than gizzard shad in smith mountain lake, virginia (tisa 1989). likewise, largemouth bass and other centrarchids are more littoral-oriented, which may explain why largemouth bass, more than any other predator, relied substantially on centrarchid (micro- pterus spp. and lepomis spp.) prey. moore (1988) found similar seasonal trends in consumption of alewife and gizzard shad by striped bass, largemouth bass, and walleye in smith mountain lake, virginia. inferring potential for competition substantial diet overlap was observed in each season with the exception of largemouth bass and pelagic predators during summer. the forage base in norris exploitative competition among piscivores reservoir is dominated by clupeids, which represent 84% of prey ﬁsh abundance (raborn 2000). these prey species are the most available for reasons stated above. simple prey–predator systems can be unstable as the entire predator assemblage can be affected by random ﬂuctuations in a single forage species (stewart et al. 1981), whereas stability may increase with prey diversity (petchey 2000). multiple weak predator–prey interactions create a more stable community than fewer strong interactions (mccann 2000). in norris, one strong interaction overshadowed all others, as the majority of predator biomass was built upon con- sumption of clupeids (raborn 2000). when clupeid supply is low, alternative prey is not numerically sufﬁcient to support this biomass and may not offset the adverse effects of exploitative competition among predators. demonstrating interspeciﬁc competition among species requires the simultaneous ﬁnding of limited available resources, increased consumer demand and substantial niche overlap (wiens 1977, 1993). a true measure of this phenomenon may never be obtained for highly mobile species such as reservoir ﬁshes, and the intensity of competitive interactions will vary annually as prey supply, predator demand and diet overlap ﬂuctuate from year to year. for now, we suggest that during this 1-year study the likelihood for exploitative competition (both inter- and intraspeciﬁc) varied seasonally as well. when diet overlap was signiﬁcant and pr was reduced, potential for interspe- ciﬁc competition was at its highest; conversely, potential was less when overlap was minimal and pr increased. in spring, all predators exhibited signi- ﬁcant diet overlap and reduced pr. during this time, predator metabolisms increased because of rising water temperatures and prey were nearing their lowest abundance in the annual cycle. however, this explan- ation is confounded by predator spawning activity, which can alter foraging behaviour and curtail pred- ator consumption. the increased pr observed in winter for largemouth bass and black crappie may have been the result of low water temperatures reducing meta- bolic rates. the opposite pattern observed for striped bass and walleye in winter may have been because these species exhibit lower optimum temperatures for consumption than largemouth bass and black crappie (hanson et al. 1997); therefore, metabolic rates may not have abated. in late summer, pr increased for all species in spite of greater metabolic rates, presumably because of increased prey availability during these months when age-0 prey ﬁsh become part of the forage base. all predators exhibited reduced pr during autumn, perhaps because summer consumption low- ered prey abundance. autumn and spring represented times when the potential for exploitative competition was highest, and the presence of substantial diet 281 raborn et al. overlap during these times increased the chances that this competition was interspeciﬁc. other researchers have reported similar seasonal patterns. striped bass in chesapeake bay exhibited reduced p from april to july (hartman & brandt 1995). in degray reservoir, arkansas, there was a prey shortage in spring coinciding with loss of predator biomass in may to june; in this reservoir, prey and predator biomass also peaked in august (ploskey & jenkins 1982). growth and p of large- mouth bass in lake rebecca, minnesota, increased during late summer and autumn (rice & cochran 1984); the fact that this increase in p was later in the year (autumn rather than summer) than in norris reservoir may be the result of different water temperatures that delay timing of physiological chan- ges. these seasonal trends in predator consumption, growth and biomass seem to coincide with patterns of prey spawning, growth and mortality, and suggest that the likelihood or severity of competition is seasonal. exploitative feeding competition results in the decline of an individual’s acquisition of energy, which limits likelihood of mortality, and reduces production by the population. we have shown energy deﬁcits to be most likely during spring and autumn in the study reservoir. we can only speculate the causes of the seasonality observed in pr, but argue that when individuals were achieving less of their energy requirements and were utilising the same resources, the potential for inter- speciﬁc (in addition to intraspeciﬁc) exploitative competition increased. studies to detect reductions in piscivorous ﬁsh production resulting from limited prey supply should be conducted at a seasonal scale of measurement to capture the changes in intensity of these food web interactions.
