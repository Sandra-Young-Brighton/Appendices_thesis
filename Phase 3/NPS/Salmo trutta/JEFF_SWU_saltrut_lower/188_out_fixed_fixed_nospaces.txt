depth, width, substrate) and 2 (pc2; velocity, water temperature, conductivity) accounted for 70% of the variation in habitat variables. principal component 1 varied more spa- tially than temporally, and pc2 exhibited the opposite pattern. species diversity varied spatially with the highest values at the upper midreach and mouth and lowest in the headwaters. species diversity also varied tem- porally with highest values in summer months and lowest in late fall and early spring. catch per unit effort (c/o varied temporally and spatially by trophic guilds and species. in general, c/f values were highest in late fall and early spring and were lowest in early and mid summer. fixed spa- tial variation (i.e., spatial difference independent of temporal factors) was higher than ephemeral spatial variation (i.e., spatial variation that varies temporally) for species with specialized feeding habits. conversely, ephemeral spatial variation was highest for fish species with generalized feeding habits. these data indicate that standardizing reaches and dates are important if habitat, species diversity, and c/f data will be used in managing stream ecosystems. key words: catch per unit effort; streams; spatial variation: temporal variation: species diversity c. s. guy, kansas cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, division of biology, 205 leasure hall, kansas state university, manhattan, ks 66506, usa accepted for publication april 20, 1999 un resumen en espaiiol se incluye detras del texto principal de este articulo. conservation of fish communities requires an understanding of fish population and habitat characteristics. thus, fisheries biologists must be certain that their samples reflect the true fish popu- lation or habitat parameters. sample size, gear sel- ectivity, and environmental variables can cause bi- ases in data used to make management decisions (boxrucker & ploskey 1988; guy & willis 1991; peterson & rabeni 1995). nevertheless, fisheries biologists are often required to make management decisions based on a single sample with a single gear because of time and monetary constraints. this type of approach may result in improper management decisions if the biases associated with the sample data are not well understood. boxruck- er & ploskey (1988) state that understanding the biases associated with sampling data are a high priority among natural resource agencies. spatial and temporal variation in catch per unit effort (c/f) data has been studied for fish popula- tions in lentic ecosystems (boxrucker & ploskey 1988; gabelhouse 1991; guy & willis 1991; hub- ert 1996). however, variation in c/f is not well documented for lotic ecosystems. numerous studies have described the relationships between fish species or trophic guild biomass and habitat parameters in streams (gorman & karr 1978; honvitz 1978; schlosser 1982; schlosser 1985; angermeier & karr 1984; todd & rabeni 1989). a few studies have documented spatiotemporal variation in absolute abundance and biomass (matthews 1990; meador & matthews 1992; peterson & rabeni 1995). although density and biomass are excellent tools to use when making management decisions, many fisheries biologists do not have the time or the resources to conduct 216 the necessary sampling to estimate biomass or den- sity. thus, fisheries biologists typically use c/f as an index to population density (hubert 1996). variability in c/f can be caused by numerous fac- tors other than variability in the density of the tar- get species or guild (hubert 1996); for example, variation in physical habitat can influence c/f. the usefulness of c/f as an index to density is based on reducing variability by standardizing gear and sampling design. thus, understanding the spatial and temporal variation in c/f and physical habitat is imperative if this tool is to be useful for fisheries biologists interested in conserving stream eco- systems. several authors have documented spatial vari- ation in species diversity (e.g., sheldon 1968; ev- ans & noble 1979; stewart et al. 1992). however, few fisheries biologists have studied temporal vari- ation in species diversity. understanding temporal and spatial variation in species diversity is critical if fisheries biologists want to make accurate assess- ments of biological diversity. meador & matthews (1992) state that understanding the spatio-tem- poral variability in fish populations or assemblages is important to detect anthropogenic pertur- bations. thus, the objectives of this study were to study the spatial and temporal variation in physicochemical habitat, fish species diversity, and c/f in a kansas flint hills stream. the impetus for developing this study was to provide the least bias framework for which a standardized long- term sampling program could be developed. in ad- dition, we believe that providing a basic under- standing of spatial and temporal variation in a kansas stream will stimulate more hypothesis- oriented field experiments. study area the topography of the kansas flint hills is domi- nated by gently sloping hills with tall-grass prairie in the uplands and deciduous gallery forest in ri- parian areas (kuchler 1969). the majority of streams in the flint hills of kansas have sub- strates primarily composed of chert and limestone with gravel-cobble particle size (2 mm to 256 mm in diameter) being most common. spates are com- mon and 75% of the annual stream flow usually occurs in about 15% of the year (metzler 1966). mill creek is a major tributary of the kansas river and has a drainage area of approximately 1063 km2 within the flint hills of northeast kan- sas. stream length from the source to the mouth is approximately 102 km with a total stream order of six and bifurcation ratio of 1.89. the average gradient of mill creek is 1.9 mkm. average dis- charge for mill creek at 26 km above its conflu- variation in habitat and fish community ence with the kansas river, was 11.5 m3/s in 1995 and 5.1 m3/s in 1996. discharge during the study was slightly above the 40-year mean for mill creek in 1995 and 1996 (tripe & guy 1998). the study area is canopied in most areas by an oak quercus spp. dominated gallery forest. land adjacent to the forested areas is primarily used for grazing and row-crop farming. we divided the study area into four reaches (i.e., mouth, lower midreach, upper midreach, and headwater). reaches were selected based on geo- morphological characteristics. for example, longi- tudinal boundaries for the reaches were defined by tributary junctions or structural discontinuities (frissell et al. 1986). all reaches were 35 times the mean stream width (msw) (lyons 1992; simon- son et al. 1994) in length, except the lower mid- reach. the mouth had a msw of 44.6 m and was located approximately 100 m upstream from the confluence with the kansas river. this reach had the greatest amount of woody debris, highest amount of silt, and lowest mean velocity (table 1). the lower midreach was located 46.0 km upstream from the mouth, and had pools and runs separated by relatively short riffles. mean depth and velocity were 0.8 m and 0.17 m/s, respectively (table 1). the upper midreach was located 72.6 km upstream from the mouth. this station had the highest diver- sity with respect to mesohabitat (e.g., log complex- es, substrate size, and overhanging vegetation), but was most similar to the lower midreach. the head- water reach was located 118.4 km upstream from mouth and was dominated by shallow riffles, with cobble substrate. the headwater station had the lowest mean depth and width (table 1). methods physicochemical measurements were made bi- monthly (once every two months) in each reach from june 1995 through october 1996. transects were established every two mean stream widths (si- monson et al. 1994). thus, the mouth and lower midreach contained four transects, upper midreach had nine transects, and the headwater reach had twelve transects. physicochemical habitat characteristics were measured on all transects following fish sampling. water temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen were measured at the midpoint of each transect using a hydrolab multiprobe. substrate, depth, and water-column velocity were measured at five points along each transect (platts et al. 1983). sub- strate particle size was classified according to a modified wentworth scale (cumins 1962);

bar measure). boat electrofishing and experimental gill nets were only used at the mouth where depths were greater than 1.2 m. within-month variation for c/f was obtained by sampling three indepen- dent sections within a stream reach. three experi- mental gill nets were set for a minimum of 3 h each sampling period. fish that were not readily identified in the field were placed in 10%) buffered formalin and returned to the laboratory for identi- fication. all species sampled were classified into six trophic guilds (table 2) based on published infor- mation (pflieger 1975; schlosser 1982, berkman & rabeni 1987; gorman 1988; leonard & orth 1988; cross & collins 1995) and were divided into the categories designated by schlosser (1982). the six trophic categories were herbivore-detritivore (hd), generalized insectivores (gi), omnivore (om), benthic insectivores (bt), surface- and water- column insectivore (sw), and insectivore- piscivores (ip). see schlosser (1 982) for specific de- scriptions of trophic guilds. fish species diversity was calculated using the shannon-weaver diversity index (ney 1993). principal component analysis (pca) was used to analyze physicochemical data. only principal components with eigenvalues greater than one were used in subsequent analyses (dillon & goldstein 1984). variables for each principal com- ponent were retained if the variable had a factor loading 20.40. temporal and spatial variation in pc scores was evaluated using mean cv by reach and date. mean species diversity values were tested 218 among reaches using anova. mixed linear model analysis with repeated measures was used to test the null hypothesis that c/f did not differ spatially or temporally in a kansas flint hills stream. reach by date interactions were further analyzed using contrast statements to identify specific inter- action areas. least-squares means were used for multiple comparisons (f-test, p-diff option in sas) when significant differences were observed in the main effects. all statistical analyses were con- ducted using sas (sas institute 1996). an alpha level of 0.05 was established a priori and used to determine statistical significance. we used methods described by meador & mat- thews (1992) to partition the components of spa- tial and temporal variance for c/f by species and trophic guild: s2, =(ms,-msi)/(nd) s ~ ~ = ( m s ~ - ms~)/(n,) s2i=ms;, where, s2=variance, ms=mean r= reaches, d=dates, and i=interaction. the variance was partitioned into ratios (lewis 1978; matthews 1990; meador & matthews 1992) to identify the relative importance of each variance component. square, results principal components 1 and 2 accounted for 70% of the variation in habitat variables. depth (0.52) and width (0.51) were positively loaded while sub- strate (-0.47) was negatively loaded for pc1. tem- perature (0.43) and velocity (0.57) were positively loaded and conductivity (-0.63) was negatively loaded for pc2 (fig. 1). spatial variation in habi- tat was most discernible in pc1 (mean cv for pcl=690, mean cv for pc2= 178). for example, the mouth reach was wider, deeper, and had more silt than upstream reaches. conversely, the head- water reach was narrower, shallower and contained cobble-bedrock substrate. principal component 1 illustrates the similarity in physical habitat be- tween midreaches. principal component 2 ex- hibited more temporal variation than pc1 (mean cv for pc2=545, mean cv for pc1=45;

table 2). species diversity varied spatially and temporally (fig. 2). diversity was sig- nificantly higher (p10.05) at the mouth and upper midreach than lower midreach and headwater (fig. 2); however, species richness was highest at the two midreaches. of the six trophic guilds, c/f differed signifi- cantly among reaches only for the ip (p=o.ool, f=15.3, df=3) and hd (p=0.003, f=11.34, df= 3) guilds (table 3); however, for the hd guild only c/f at the headwater reach differed significantly from the other reaches. catch per unit effort was significantly different (p=o.oool, f=7.6, df=7) temporally for the ip guild at all reaches; headwat- er, lower midreach, and mouth for the hd guild; headwaters for the gi guild; and the upper mid- reach for the om guild (table 3). there was a sig- nificant reach by date interaction for the ip (p= 0.0004, f=3.1, df=21) and hd (p=o.oool, f= 3.6, df=21) guilds. most of the interactions for the hd guild occurred because of the high c/f values in october 1995 and august 1996 at the headwater 220 reach. catch per unit effort values were generally highest in march and october and lowest in june and august, cv values were generally highest in may, june, and august. there were no significant (p10.05) correlations between c/f and cv for any guilds. the spatial variation in c/f for the ip and hd guilds was influenced by physicochemical fac- tors. for example, pc 1 was negatively correlated with c/f of the hd (p=0.003;

mouth reach not included id analysis because fewer than 30 fish were sampled),with the midreach sta- tions having the highest c/f (fig. 3). catch per unit effort also differed significantly by date for the upper (p=0.0004, f=8.66, df=7) and lower (p= 0.0002, f=9.65, df=7) midreaches, with high c/f values occurring in march and october, and low c/f values in june and august. there was a sig- nificant reach by date interaction (p=o.oool, f= 6.99, df=21). the interaction among reach and date was ordinal and caused by the low number of bluntnose minnows captured at the.headwaters. when the headwater reach was removed from the  w y . 5 0 8 0 3 ) 2 3 9 1 ( . ) 7 7 3 8 ( .  . 2 6 4 4 3 ) 1 3 5 6 ( .  . 8 5 4 8 5  0 2 3 . ) 1 1 7 8 ( . ) 5 8 8 4 ( .  . 7 9 9 6 1  . 2 1 9 6 4 . ) 8 1 4 0 1 (  2 4 4 6 . ) 1 1 7 6 ( .  3 7 2 2 . ) 3 9 8 6 ( . y z 0 4 8 8 . ) 7 4 5 1 ( . v 7 2 1 9 1 . ) 6 5 5 3 ( . x y 4 2 1 8 . ) 0 3 1 5 ( . x 5 9 8 2 1 . ) 9 4 6 3 ( . z z ) 7 7 6 6 ( .  . 5 4 7 0 5  . 2 5 2 9 3 . ) 5 8 7 2 1 (  6 4 5 . ) 6 5 0 5 ( .  z o  7 9 2 1 . ) 9 2 1 7 ( .  . . u ) 7 3 1 8 8 3 3 9 ( 5 1 ) 4 3 6 1 ( .  8 1 4 4 . ) 5 2 4 7 ( .  . 4 3 9 0 7 x . 7 2 2 2 6 ) 2 2 2 3 ( .  . 2 3 6 0 6 . ) 5 0 1 3 1 (  . 9 9 8 0 2 ) 1 0 0 5 ( .  1 6 4 1 . ) 9 5 0 9 ( .  z 5 9 2 0 1 .  ) 2 8 9 4 ( . ) 7 8 1 2 ( .  . 4 6 6 3 7 ) 7 6 6 4 ( . . 6 6 5 5 1  6 9 0 3 . ) 3 4 1 4 ( .  w z  ) 1 7 3 3 ( . ) 0 4 3 4 ( .  . 1 8 3 8 2  . 1 8 0 5 4 ) 6 7 0 3 ( .  6 1 6 2 . ) 2 2 8 8 ( . . 3 1 4 9 2  7 3 2 9 .  ) 9 1 6 6 ( .  . 8 5 3 7 5 . ) 9 9 8 2 1 (  6 7 3 7 . ) 0 4 6 8 ( .  8 4 6 . . ) 6 5 5 5 1 (  w z 7 9 9 5 . y z 1 0 1 5 . ) 5 7 3 7 ( . y 8 9 9 0 1 . ) 6 3 9 3 ( . y 7 9 3 3 . ) 6 6 1 3 ( . ) 2 1 6 3 ( . z . y 8 8 3 9 5 1 ) 7 1 0 8 ( .  . 1 3 1 5 2 . ) 3 9 8 3 1 (  1 1 4 . y 9 2 8 4 2 . ) 0 0 7 5 ( . . ) 1 2 3 7 1 (  w z 0 2 6 3 3 .  9 6 0 3 . ) 2 8 4 8 ( .  3 6 6 5 . ) 6 3 8 2 ( . . ) 6 0 3 0 1 (  5 1 3 . ) 1 4 5 9 ( .  0 1 0 8 . ) 9 6 0 5 ( .  . 3 0 4 4 1 ) 5 3 5 6 ( .  4 2 6 2 . ) 8 5 3 4 ( .  6 7 0 1 . ) 3 7 8 8 ( . v w z 9 8 1 9 . y z 8 6 5 5 . ) 0 1 0 7 ( . y z 3 2 6 3 . y z 4 1 5 1 . z 6 5 8 2 2 ) 1 3 3 7 ( . . ) 1 6 2 2 ( . ) 5 2 3 7 ( .  6 5 4 8 .  z 0 4 2 1 ) 1 0 1 9 ( . . z 2 2 9 1 .  ) 1 8 0 4 ( . . ) 4 0 4 0 1 ( . ) 7 4 3 0 1 (  4 6 7 . y z . 1 2 8 1 2 . ) 7 3 0 4 1 ( ) 7 2 6 1 ( .  . 2 5 2 7 3 ) 8 4 4 7 ( .  . 0 8 0 1 ) 5 5 9 1 ( . z  6 6 7 9 .  ) 9 1 8 6 ( . ) 1 8 0 6 ( .  . 2 3 0 0 2  3 2 4 5 . ) 9 8 1 3 ( .  9 5 5 . ) 4 9 4 7 ( .  0 4 9 3 . ) 4 3 9 3 ( .  v w x z 6 4 3 3 1 . y z 7 9 8 1 . ) 7 3 0 1 ( . y 5 1 2 7 . ) 6 8 5 2 ( . y z . ) 8 4 7 4 1 ( ) 0 3 8 5 ( .  . 1 9 1 2 3 . 0 3 7 3 7 . ) 5 1 1 3 1 ( z z 7 3 1 1 ) 2 9 3 7 ( . . ) 8 0 9 2 ( .  5 0 0 2 .  6 7 6 . ) 8 5 9 9 ( .  u x 7 6 4 6 0 1 . ) 6 6 1 3 ( . . ) 8 0 3 2 1 (  . 9 7 8 8 0 3  4 7 7 . . ) 1 2 3 7 1 ( 0 0 0 0  0 0  0  6 4 1 . . ) 5 9 4 6 1 (  d o i r e p g n  i l p m a s r e b o t c o t s u g u a  e n u j y a m h c r a m r e b o t c o t s u g u a e n u j  p  h c a e r  n i s e u a v l .  6 9 9 1 r e b o t c o h g u o r h t 5 9 9 1 e n u j m o r f s a s n a k  , k e e r c l l i m r o f ) h t u o m = m , h c a e r d m i r e w o l = m l , h c a e r d m i r e p p u = m u , r e t a w d a e h = h ( h c a e r d n a d l i i u g c h p o r t y b ) r u o h r e p r e b m u n ;

(1997) found that abundance was highest in the spring and early summer in two headwater streams of the little missouri river, arkansas. they attributed the temporal patterns in fish abundance to water level variation. some of the variation in c/f could be a function of age-0 fish recruiting to the sampling gear. how- ever, if this were true we would expect to find more temporal variation in c/f because of fish recruiting during explicit time periods. peterson & rabeni (1995) found age-0 fish slightly increased temporal variability, but biomass was mostly influenced by spatial variation. as with all sampling gears, back- pack electrofishing is biased and sampling can be influenced by numerous abiotic factors. because c/f was correlated with pc1 it is likely that the variation in c/f is more a function of physical habitat variation among locations (i.e., depth, width, and substrate) than hydrological par- ameters (i.e., velocity, temperature, and conduc- 223 tripe & guy tivity). gorman & karr (1978) and schlosser (1982) have suggested that physical habitat is a critical component in the structure of fish com- munities in streams. spatial distribution of fishes in an oklahoma stream were a function of habitat structure and physicochemical tolerances (stewart et al. 1992). similarly, sheldon (1968) suggested that spatial variation in species diversity was a function of water depth in a new york stream. ev- ans & noble (1979) documented that patterns of longitudinal distribution of fishes were influenced by environmental factors (i.e., depth, flow, tem- perature, and gradient), temporal variation in cli- mate, and fish movement. as stream order in- creases and environmental fluctuations decrease (horowitz 1978), species diversity generally in- creases (harrel et. al. 1967; whiteside & mcnatt 1972). gorman & karr (1978) documented a posi- tive association between habitat diversity and spe- cies diversity, but angermeier & schlosser (1989) suggested that habitat factors are poor indicators of fish distribution and abundance in streams with large degrees of seasonal or environmental vari- ability. we found fish species diversity increased longitudinally, but physicochemical variation was least in the midreaches. the lack of a longitudinal relationship among physicochemical variation and species diversity is likely a function of our mouth reach. fish species diversity at the mouth was pri- marily a function of the replacement of species sampled upstream with large river species com- monly collected in the kansas river. the majority of stream studies documenting longitudinal vari- ation in species diversity do not include a reach similar to the mouth reach in our study. the hypothesis that physical habitat explains most of the variation in c/f is also supported by the sources of variation. spatial variation exceeded temporal variation in c/f for three species and five trophic guilds. interestingly, ephemeral spatial variation (reach variation that changes temporally) was highest in c/f for bluntnose minnow, red shiner, general insectivore, and omnivore. the gen- eralized insectivore and omnivore trophic guilds were highly influenced by red shiner and bluntnose minnow c/f values because they represented a large percentage (by number) of those guilds, re- spectively. fixed spatial variation for c/f values was highest for central stonerollers, benthic insec- tivores, insectivore-piscivore, and herbivore-detriti- vore. the herbivore-detritivore c/f values were highly influenced by central stoneroller c/f valucs. thus, c/f data for fishes with generalized feeding habits (such as the bluntnose minnow and red shiner) has more ephemeral spatial variation than species with more specialized feeding habits despite standardization of sampling locations. feeding 224 habits are closely associated with physical habitat. for example, central stonerollers dominated the fish assemblage in the headwaters. the headwater reach had a high gradient, shallow depth, high per- cent of riffle habitat, and mostly a cobble sub- strate. these conditions were suitable for algal growth and subsequently the fish assemblage was dominated by central stonerollers. these data corroborate results documented by matthews (1990), mcador & matthews (1992), and peterson & rabeni (1995) for biomass and abso- lute abundance data. understanding the temporal and spatial vari- ability in fish population and assemblage charac- teristics is critical if fisheries scientists want to es- tablish standardized long-term data sets or detect the effects of anthropogenic perturbations. few natural resource agencies have standardized long- term data sets for stream ecosystems. thus, these data should help provide a base-line of infor- mation regarding variability in population and as- semblage characteristics. standardized sampling can help reduce biases in data used to manage fish populations. thus, fisheries managers should choose a sampling design that will be least affected by seasonal biases and provide the most amount of information. if a fisheries biologist has to make a choice regarding standardization of sampling reaches or dates, we surmise that standardizing sampling reaches is most important. however, the ideal standardized sampling design would establish sampling reaches and dates during times of low variation in c/f. resumen 1. la conservacion de las comunidades de peces requiere del conocimiento de las poblaciones y las caracteristicas del habi- tat. por tanto, 10s biologos pesqueros deben asegurarse de que sus muestras reflejan la realidad de 10s parametros poblacion- ales y de hkbitat. ademas, el conocimiento de las variaciones temporales y espaciales en la captura por unidad de esfuerzo (cpue) y el habitat fisico son fundamentales para la conserva- cion de 10s ecosistemas fluviales. 2. en rios de la cuenca de flint hills (kansas, usa), por un period0 de dos afios, hemos muestreado cada dos meses cuatro puntos distintos (nacimiento, curso medio, curso alto y desem- bocadura) y hemos realizado anilisis de componentes principa- les. los pcl (profundidad, anchura, substrato) y pc2 (veloci- dad, temperatura del agua y conductividad) explicaron el 70% de la variabilidad en el habitat. pc1 varia mas espacialmentc que temporalmente y pc2 exhibe el patron contrario. 3. en la desembocadura y el curso alto la diversidad de especies varia espacialmente con 10s valores altos, mientras que en las cabeceras de 10s rios lo hace a 10s valores mas bajos. la varia- cion a escala temporal se produce con 10s valores m6s altos durante el verano y la mis baja a finales de otoiio y principio de primavera. 4. la captura por unidad de esfuerzo varia espacial y temporal- mente segun las cadenas troficas y las especies. en general 10s valores de cpue son mayores a iinales de otofio y principios de primavera, dandose 10s mas bajos a primeros y mediados de verano. 5. en especies con habitos alimentarios especializados, la varia- cion espacial fija, es decir la diferencia espacial independiente de factores temporales, es mas elevada que la efimera (variacion espacial que cambia temporalmente). por el contrario, en las especies generalistas la variacion espacial efimera es mayor. 6. todos estos datos indican que las corrientes estandarizadas y las fechas de captura son importantes si se van a utilizar datos sobre habitat, biodiversidad y valores de cpue en la gestion de ecosistemas fluviales. acknowledgments we thank matthew burlingame, curran salter, jeff
