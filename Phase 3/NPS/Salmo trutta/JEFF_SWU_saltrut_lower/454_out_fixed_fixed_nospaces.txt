salvelinus_alpinus; ireland; spawning; eggs; littoral introduction arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) populations in britain and ireland complete their life cycle in freshwater, although they originated from anadromous colonisers around 10,000 years ago, following the retreat of the pleistocene ice cap (maitland 1974). compared with ireland’s other native salmonids, brown_trout and atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), relatively little is known about the spawning habits of arctic charr. this may be largely because of the logistic challenges involved: over much of their northern hemispheric range, spawning generally occurs at the coldest time of year, nocturnally and, in many cases, at great depths (johnson 1980; rubin & buttiker 1992). unlike the majority of salmonid species, arctic charr are neither exclusively river nor lake spawners (klemetsen et al. 2003), with each strategy being performed over much of their geographic range (johnson 1980). in the british isles, the majority of charr populations spawn in lakes; of the 258 native populations documented in scotland (maitland et al. 2007), only 10 populations are known to spawn in rivers, two of which are now extinct (walker 2007). two of the eight english populations (frost 1965; mccubbing et al. 1998) and one of the four welsh populations (mccarthy 2007) have been found to spawn in rivers. of ireland’s 74 documented charr populations (maitland et al. 2007), there is only a single anecdotal account of lotic spawning for lough allua (thompson et al. 1856), where the species is now extinct (igoe & hammar 2004). spawning sites have been located for a number of river spawning anadromous arctic charr populations in norway and north america (nordeng 1961; moore 1975; dempson & green 1985; cunjak et al. 1986) and for nonanadromous river spawning charr in britain (frost 1965; mccubbing et al. 1998; walker 2007). although the proportion of lake spawning populations far exceeds that of river spawning popu- lations, particularly in europe, research on the phys- icochemical characteristics of the littoral spawning correspondence: s.s.c. harrison, department of zoology, ecology and plant sciences, school of biological, earth & environmental sciences, university college cork, the cooperage, distillery fields, north mall, cork, ireland. e-mail: s.harrison@ucc.ie doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00502.x 537 low et al. habitat is limited (e.g., dussart 1952; frost 1965; kircheis 1976; brenner 1980; jonsson & hindar 1982; rubin & buttiker 1992). these studies suggest that lake spawning habitat characteristics vary greatly between localities. eggs have been found deposited from depths of as little as 0.3 m at floods pond, usa (kircheis 1976), to as great as 120 m in lake le´man, switzerland (rubin & buttiker 1992). in the british isles, spawning sites of the windermere charr populations were found to lie between 1 and 21 m depth (frost 1965). the substrate type used by spawning charr also varies greatly, with 1- to 5-cm-diameter gravel being the preferred substrate in lake le´man (rubin & buttiker 1992) and 10-to 100-cm-diameter cobbles and boulders in floods pond, usa (kircheis 1976). frost (1965) found that windermere charr spawned amongst stones of 0.5–25 cm diameter. in ireland, lake-side observations of spawning activity on calm winter evenings allowed several spawning areas to be identiﬁed in loughs conn and corrib prior to their extinctions (igoe et al. 2001). more quantitative approaches, including direct obser- vations of spawned ova via snorkelling and trapping adult spawning ﬁsh with littoral-set fyke nets, have been used successfully to locate spawning sites in several irish lakes (f. igoe, unpublished). however, no study to-date has attempted to locate and describe the entire spawning habitat within a single lake. in the present study, the combined approach of fyke netting and snorkelling was undertaken systematically to locate and describe all spawning grounds in three irish lakes. ireland’s arctic charr populations, which are at the southern margin of their natural range, are under major threat, with approximately one-third of known populations now extinct (igoe et al. 2003). agricultural intensiﬁcation leading to nutrient enrich- ment of lakes is considered the main cause (igoe et al. 2001). long-term monitoring and comparisons of spawning site conditions amongst lakes of different conditions (e.g., nutrient loading) will lead to a better understanding of the threats currently facing arctic charr and so aid their future conservation. study area the three lakes those are located in county kerry, south-west ireland (fig. 1) were selected on the basis of recent conﬁrmation of the presence of arctic charr populations and relative ease of accessibility (irish char conservation group, unpublished). all three populations are indigenous, with no known history of stocking. brown_trout (salmo_trutta), atlantic salmon (salmo_salar) and european eel (anguilla anguilla) are all present in each of the three lakes (j. low, personal observation). 538 fig. 1. position of the three study lakes on the iveragh penninsula, south-west ireland. loughs acoose and cloon both drain into lough caragh. lough coomasaharn lies several kilometres to the west in the behy catchment. the three study lakes are all relatively deep (maximum depths of 19–52 m; irish char conservation group, unpublished) and have similar altitudes (90–163 m; iccg, unpublished), surface areas (0.67–0.81 km2) and small catchment sizes (7.0–17.4 km2). materials and methods locating spawning sites as the timing of spawning in the study lakes was unknown, prior to large-scale systematic netting, the timing of spawning had to be identiﬁed. fyke nets were used to trap spawning charr, as the success of this method had been previously demonstrated (igoe and ruane in press). arctic charr in ireland only enter the shallow littoral in numbers to spawn (f. igoe and n. ruane, unpublished data); therefore, their capture in fyke nets set in littoral areas was a strong indication of the onset of the spawning period. fyke nets were set at 12 equally spaced sites around the littoral of loughs coomasaharn and cloon on a weekly basis from mid- november 2005, until catches indicated that the spawning season had commenced (early december). lough acoose was not netted at this stage as it was expected that timing of spawning would be similar to that of lough cloon, located on the same system. as fyke nets only caught ﬁsh during darkness, nets were set and retrieved over two successive days, so that nets were ﬁshing over a single night period. once this initial netting programme had established that spawning activity had commenced, further fyke netting was undertaken at 24 equidistant points around each of the three lakes (i.e., including lough acoose). this approximated to 180- to 235-m intervals depend- ing on the length of shoreline of each lake. nets were set parallel to the shore with their bases lying at approximately 1 m depth. where the littoral was dominated by large boulders, or too steeply shelving, nets were set at the closest suitable location. double fyke nets (leader length 8 m, height 55 cm), with traps extending from both ends of the leader, were used throughout the study. openings to fyke nets were installed with guards, to prevent otter (lutra lutra) casualties. the leaders and bodies of fyke nets had maximum mesh sizes of 10 mm, which was sufﬁciently narrow to avoid the risk of trapping ﬁsh by their gills, as had occured in preliminary netting. following the netting stage, areas of the lake littoral in which charr had been trapped were surveyed for the presence of eggs by snorkelling. snorkelling continued along the littoral as far as the next netting station at which no charr were caught. eggs were carefully sought by zig-zagging along the littoral from the shore edge down to 2 m depth. to locate eggs, substrate was excavated by hand down to the depth at which large substrate ended and the ﬁne underlying substrate began. this was generally at depths of 5–15 cm from the substrate surface. when eggs were encountered, markers were precisely placed at the beginning and the end of the spawning areas. because of unforeseeable circumstances involving a vehicular failure, a small number of nets could not be set in lough cloon; however, in compensation, additional snorkelling was undertaken in those areas not netted. all signiﬁcant inﬂowing streams (>1 m width) were searched for the presence of charr ova upstream from their mouths until either an impassable waterfall was reached or the stream became too shallow ⁄ narrow to be surveyed. treatment of ﬁsh netted ﬁsh were transferred into a large plastic container ﬁlled with lake water. for the purpose of the current study, only species and sex were recorded. except for occasional casualties through entanglement and suffocation at fyke net entrances, ﬁsh were released unharmed. measurement of egg densities egg densities were measured at spawning sites in lough cloon only, owing to the greater accessibility of this lake. densities were quantiﬁed using three 20 · 20 cm quadrats set haphazardly on each spawn- ing site. within each quadrat, large substrate was carefully excavated so that eggs remained upon the ﬁner underlying substrate for counting. substrate was arctic charr spawning habitats carefully replaced once all eggs were counted. a calm day during the ﬁrst week of january (postspawning), 2006, was chosen for this procedure. mapping of spawning site positions using a garmin exrexò gps1, instructive waypoints were used to accurately map the shoreline and position of spawning sites at each lake. the gps output was resized to match the outlines of bathymetric maps of each lake and the two images superimposed to form a single image, employing adobe photoshopò 5.5. physical measurements of spawning sites at each of the three lakes, a datum mark was inscribed on the face of a suitable large emergent boulder. the water level was recorded in relation to the datum on every date that measurements were taken of spawning sites, as well as throughout the spawning and incuba- tion periods. this permitted the depths recorded at spawning sites to be presented in relation to minimum, maximum and average lake levels. during january 2006, three transects were taken at spawning sites, one at 1 m inwards from each end and one at the centre. along each transect, working perpendicularly out from the shoreline, depths and distances from the shore were recorded at the points where egg presence started and ended. isolated, errat- ically placed eggs were not considered as evidence of a spawning site boundary, as it was possible that these had been washed away from the real spawning substrate. gradients above, on and below spawning sites were later calculated from recorded distances and depths. surface areas of spawning sites were calculated from length and width measurements using simple geometry. spawning site substrate analysis substrate analysis was limited to lough cloon. samples weighing 5–10 kg were removed from two 20 · 20 cm haphazardly placed quadrats at each of the 10 spawning sites. coarse substrate was excavated by hand until the underlying ﬁne substrate layer was reached. stones were individually measured with callipers along their longest axes. the total masses of stones in 1 cm incremental size categories were measured, and the geometric mean calculated follow- ing lotspeich & everest (1981). measurement of interstitial depths interstitial depths of the large loose substrate above the compacted underlying layer were measured in situ 1gps refers to global positioning system. 539 low et al.

two within each of the two lake sub- basins. in addition, there was a 260 m stretch of shore with numerous small spawning areas that ranged in size from 0.1 m2 to approximately 1 m2. this area of littoral was of a low egg density, with spawning sites being separated by areas of large boulders. such sites will henceforth be referred to as ‘diffuse sites’. spawned eggs were found along a total of 348 m of littoral, which is 6.2% of the total length. excluding the low egg density diffuse spawning area, the discrete spawning sites totalled to 88 m, or 1.6% of the 5.6 km lake littoral. littoral in lough acoose, seven discrete spawning beds were found in four separate areas along the eastern shore of the lake (fig. 3b). in addition, on the western shore, a diffuse spawning area continued along 290 m of the littoral in a similar manner to that found in lough coomasaharn. eggs were found along a total of 468 m of littoral (9.9% of the total littoral length). excluding the diffuse area of spawning, the length of discrete sites totalled 178 m, or 3.8% of the 4.7 km lake circumference. in lough cloon, there were seven discrete sites on the western shore and three on the eastern shore (fig. 3c). the two general areas of spawning were highly localised and located adjacent to the deepest part of the single lake basin. no diffuse areas of spawning were found. the combined length of the 10 sites was 166 m, or 3.8% of the 4.4 km littoral length. qualitative snorkelling survey of inﬂowing steams failed to reveal lotic spawned charr ova within any of the three lake catchments. depth, distance off-shore and gradient of spawning sites mean values are shown in table 1. at mean lake level, all 23 spawning sites started at depths of <1 m, with a mean starting depth of 55 (se ± 5) cm. the minimum depth was )2 cm (i.e., emerged) and maximum depth was 124 cm. using the mid-depth of individual the mean depth of spawning sites spawning sites, arctic charr spawning habitats amongst all sites was 64 (±4) cm (n = 23). through- out the spawning season and incubation period, lake levels ﬂuctuated in each of the lakes to a similar degree (coomasahar n = 44 cm; acoose = 50 cm; cloon = 63 cm). distance from the shoreline to spawning sites varied from 0–15.1 m with the mean of all sites being 5.7 (±0.8) m (n = 23). distances from the shoreline were signiﬁcantly correlated with the gradient of the littoral above spawning sites (pearson product-moment cor- relation, r2 = 0.32, d.f. = 23, p < 0.05). if the three lakes are compared, at lough coomasaharn, the deepest and steepest shelving lake, spawning sites to the shore (mean = 3.0 ± 1.5 m, were closest n = 6), whereas at lough acoose, the shallowest and gentlest shelving lake, sites were furthest away from the shore (mean = 9.6 ± 1.3 m, n = 7). on the spawning the gradient of spawning sites ranged from 8.5 to 95.5%, with a mean gradient of 44.5 (±5.0)% (n = 23). the gradient of the littoral shoreward of than the spawning sites was signiﬁcantly lower gradients themselves (h = 3.92, p < 0.05; kruskal–wallis multiple com- parison test) or offshore of the spawning site (h = 4.64, p < 0.01). there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the gradients of the spawning sites and the littoral directly offshore (h = 0.56, p > 0.05), although at 61% of sites, the littoral offshore of the spawning site exhibited a steeper gradient than the spawning site itself. sites length, width and surface area of spawning sites spawning site length was very variable within and between lakes. excluding the small patches of gravel used in the diffuse spawning areas of loughs coo- masaharn and acoose, spawning sites ranged in length from 4 to 99 m (mean = 18.8 ± 4.2 m, n = 23). width of spawning site ranged from as little as 0.72–5.15 m. this widest site (cm 5) was unusual as it lay at the low gradient outﬂow of lough coomasa- harn. spawning sites were mostly of a narrow width (mean = 1.4 ± 0.2 m, n = 23) and showed little variation with 21 of the 23 spawning sites having a width £2 m. surface area of discrete spawning sites ranged from 4.0 to 112.6 m2, with a mean area of 25.2 ± 4.8 m2 (n = 23). the total area of discrete spawning sites (excluding low egg density diffuse sites, which were not quantiﬁed) was 143 m2 in lough coomasaharn, 222 m2 in lough acoose and 214 m2 at lough cloon. the percentage area of available littoral actually used for spawning (excluding diffuse sites) was calculated as 0.4% in loughs coomasaharn and acoose and 0.7% in lough cloon. to estimate the available area of the mean in each lake, littoral 541 low et al.

distribution of spawning sites in relation to aspect and proximity to deep water varied consid- erably, contradicting the common perception that spawning sites are located on the most exposed shores, adjacent to deep water (f. igoe, irish char conservation group, personal communication). the methods employed were unsuitable for detect- ing deepwater spawning sites, which have been found in large, deep lakes elsewhere (frost 1965; rubin & buttiker 1987). our observations indicated that ﬁne sediments always covered substrates at depths >1.5 m in the study lakes; however, is possible that deepwater springs could maintain sediment-free areas it (e.g., blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1997) at depths below our limit of observation. the mean size of spawning substrate varied considerably between individual sites, from 3.5 to 10 cm. this range of spawning substrate sizes is similar to that reported to be used by lake spawning salmon, oncorhynchus_nerka (leonetti sockeye (1997). the same author found substrate particles <1.3 cm diameter to be absent from spawning sub- strate, which is similar to our ﬁndings, where only 0.2% of substrate particles by mass were £1 cm diameter. either the shear stress is too great for such particles to remain at these sites (miller et al. 1977), or it is possible that such particle sizes are of a sufﬁciently small size to fall between the interstitial spaces and become incorporated into the ﬁne gravel matrix below the spawning substrate itself. the absence of eggs from substrate smaller than 3.5 cm diameter may be attributed to the inability of spawned eggs to settle between substrate particles of this size or less. refuge within the substrate interstitial spaces is essential for survival; otherwise, eggs may suffer mortality from physical disturbance or predation (fitzsimons et al. 2007). although charr of certain populations have been observed in aquaria to oviposit into excavated redds (fabricius 1953; fabricius & gustafson 1954; frost 1965), rubin & buttiker (1992) observed that lake le´man charr made no attempt to cut redds, rather eggs were swept into crevices after spawning by the female undulating the tail rapidly. it has been shown that females of about 30 cm long are able to throw up stones measuring up to 4 cm in diameter (fabricius & gustafson 1954). however, given that the maximum length of female charr caught in the irish study lakes is only 22.1 cm (low 2010), redd digging within the relatively large spawning substrate size in these lakes is most unlikely. not only do eggs need to fall within interstitial spaces, the present ﬁndings show that they must do so to an adequate depth to ensure survival. the mean interstitial depth on spawning sites was 8.27 cm, which was 2–3 times the depth of substrate

consisted of multiple layers. the consistently long, narrow proﬁle of littoral spawning sites indicates that the position of spawning sites in these lakes is because of hydraulic sorting. the close proximity of the spawning substrate to the shoulder of gradient change is also seen for lake charr (salvelinus_namaycush) spawning sites in the great lakes (j. fitzsimons, department of fisheries and oceans, ontario, personal communication). it has been suggested that suitable spawning habitat for lake charr probably occurs where wave-generated shear forces are sufﬁciently strong to remove ﬁnes from the interstitial spaces, yet not so strong that they also remove the eggs (eshenroder et al. 1995). contrary to expectations, spawning sites were often located in bays or relatively sheltered areas of the three lakes. although littoral substrate at the most exposed areas of each lake were frequently observed to be free of ﬁne particles and therefore had deep interstitial spaces, their unsuitability as spawning sites may be attributed to excessive physical exposure; during the incubation period, very strong winds and water turbulence were often experienced. egg mortality resulting from physical disturbance can occur either directly from egg displacement (clary 1972; roseman et al. 2001; fitzsimons et al. 2007) or indirectly through damage and subsequent death of eggs that are not displaced (fitzsimons 1995). during the early stages of embryogenesis, developing charr eggs are to physical disturbance (fitzsimons 1994; eshenroder et al. 1995; perkins & krueger 1995). extremely sensitive as well as providing partial refugia from physical disturbance, substrate with large deep interstitials may also be selected to avoid egg predation. frost (1952) observed that european eels (anguilla anguilla) and brown_trout (salmo_trutta) consumed large numbers of charr eggs in windermere. as these same species co-occur with charr in the three study lakes, it can be expected that predation is a factor here also, potentially driving selection for spawning site characteristics that reduce egg predation (moyle 1977). across the three lakes, there was no evidence that spawning sites were exposed to the direction of the south-west prevailing wind; however, 17 of the 23 spawning sites faced either se, w or nw directions. these sites were approxi- mately perpendicular to the prevailing wind and therefore may be expected to be under intermediate exposure. the distribution may in part be explained by the approximately sw–ne orientation of the three lake basins concerned; the majority of the spawning sites were situated along the longest sides of the basins. arctic charr spawning habitats superimposition of the locations of spawning sites on bathymetric maps showed that the majority of spawning sites were located adjacent to relatively steeply shelving parts of the lake basin. charr may preferentially choose these sites because of the close proximity to their deep water habitat, which may minimise energy costs because of short migratory distances or minimise predation risk. egg density was highly variable between spawning )2. this variation sites and ranged from 33–900 eggsæm is great enough to suggest that washout and predation are not solely responsible for the great differences in egg densities and that variation in intensity of oviposition is of importance. of the 12 metrics measured, egg density was signiﬁcantly correlated only with gradient (negatively) and width (positively) of spawning sites. wide and gently sloping spawning sites may be more favoured owing to greater substrate stability or reduced chance of washout. when the spawning sites of lough cloon were revisited in the following year, the position of deposited eggs was similar and relative egg densities were broadly similar across sites for the two years (low 2010). consistency between years and the very small areas of substrate used for spawning (0.4–0.7% of available substrate) suggests that spawning sites in these lakes are ‘hotspots’, with superior characteristics. importantly, this indicates that the success of artiﬁcial spawning sites for threatened populations may be difﬁcult to achieve unless such sites meet the strict physical criteria required. also, deterioration of the physical integrity of these sites owing to catchment- wide (e.g., eutrophication and siltation), lake-wide (e.g., altered water levels) or local disturbance (e.g., engineering and trampling) may markedly reduce a population’s reproductive success, risking collapse. the shallowness of littoral spawning sites is a particular danger for spawning charr; a reduction in water level by only one metre would expose spawning substrate at all 23 spawning sites in the current study, with 14 of the sites being completely exposed. a rise in water level could also be expected threaten such populations, as it would likely take more than a charr’s generation time for the resorting of suitable spawning substrate at increased depths may become clogged with sediment over time, as water movement would likely be insufﬁcient to maintain suitably sediment-free interstitials. the new lake level. sites at the apparent vulnerability of the spawning sites to physical change or catastrophic events emphasises the fragility of charr populations. the threat is particularly apparent in irish charr populations where the maxi- mum age rarely exceeds 7 years (igoe & hammar 2004). it would therefore only take a few years of poor recruitment to put such populations at risk of being an 545 low et al. addition to the long list of exterminated southern arctic charr populations (see maitland 1995). acknowledgements the authors thank micheal o’shea,
