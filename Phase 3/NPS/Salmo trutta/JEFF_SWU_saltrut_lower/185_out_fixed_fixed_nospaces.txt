regulated rivers and canals in the lowlands of germany. ecology of freshwater fish 1997: 6: 174-181. 0 munksgaard, 1997 abstract - simple morphological characteristics and fish assemblage data were collected in representative numbers from 12 inland waterways in the northeastern lowlands of germany between 1992 and 1995. fish abundance data were pooled and classified into three main groups: perch perca juviatilis (l.), roach rutilus rutilus (l.) and other species. spear- man rank correlations between fish abundance and type of embankment revealed that perch showed a statistically significant numerical dominance in waterways consisting predominately of an artificial shoreline, suggesting that perch may be used as an indicator of the structural degradation of watercourses. c. wolter', a.

long-lived and can cover considerable dis- tances. therefore, they have the potential to inte- grate aspects from relatively large-scale habitats in a temporal dimension and thus have been needed as indicators for biological monitoring programs (fausch et al. 1990, wolter & vilcinskas 1996a) as well as target species for conservation and habitat management (cf. bruton 1995). different concepts can be used in setting priorities for conservation action, and the abundance of indicator species that are particularly sensitive to environmental change is one of use in the assessment of habitat quality (bruton 1995). between 1992 and 1994, a representative number of waterways in the northeastern lowlands of ger- many were surveyed to assess the possible impact of reconstruction on their fauna and flora (vil- cinskas & wolter 1994). perch percujuviutilis (l.) was found to be in particularly high abundance in the most canalized waterways, and the aim of the 174 present study was to examine the applicability of perch as an indicator species of structural degrada- tion in watercourses. study area the waterways studied are situated in the north- eastern lowlands of germany (fig. l), and belong to the river elbe catchment. in the west, the mit- tellandkanal (mlk) crosses the watershed be- tween the elbe and weser catchments and in the east the canals oder-spree-kana1 ( o x ) and oder-havel-kana1 (ohk) cross the watershed be- tween the elbe and oder catchments. some physi- cal characteristics of the waterways investigated are given in table 1. fish sampling was carried out in the mittelelbe (elbe) in a representative part between stream-km 438 and 471 and in the mlk from canal-km 250 to the elbe, over a distance of 68 km. in the other waterways, rivers muggelspree (msp), oberspree (osp), unterspree (usp) and untere havel-wasserstrade (uhw), and the ca- regulated the c f .*“my“ .( fi o 2o 4a w no inohm dresden fig. 1. study area in the northeastern lowlands of

out over a 4-year period (1992 to 1995). at each location, fish were caught three times each year (spring, summer and au- tumn) in order to consider seasonal variations in species composition for the assessment of the pro- portion of each species to the total fish assemblage: this consisted of the mlk in 1992, the ehk and msp in both 1993 and 1994, the hk, elbe and uhw in 1993, the bzk, osk, osp and usp in 1994 and also the ohk and tk in 1994 and 1995. all sites were fished from a boat positioned near the shoreline with generator-powered dc electro- fishing equipment (4.5 kw). the length of samples perch as an indicator species varied between 300 m and 1000 m depending on river size and structural variability. additional samples were also collected by bottom-set and pel- agic gillnets in all waterways with exception of bzk, hk and uhw and by trapnets and trawls (pelagic, bottom and special eel trawl; with each ten 1000 m hauls during summer) in the uhw gillnets of different mesh sizes were exposed for 2- 3 h during day and fishes scared with noise or pulsed dc into the nets. this was done in the elbe at 27 sites and in the other waterways at 2 (tk) to 7 (ehk) selected sites (vilcinskas & wolter 1993, 1994). fish were identified to species and abun- dance ascertained; simultaneously the individual lengths and weights were measured and recorded to an accuracy of 0.5 cm and 1 g respectively. pres- ence and relative abundance (percentage of total catch) were calculated for all species. although ab- solute measures of population densities in the waterways investigated were not achieved, the adoption of a similar electrofishing procedure at each site ensured that catches could be used to as- sess relative abundance. the shannon-weaver spe- cies diversity (h’) was calculated as the sum of proportions of individuals that each species con- tributes to the entire community (begon et al. 1990). this was calculated using pooled data for sites and waterways. subsequently, fish were classi- fied after their relative abundance into three main categories: perch, roach rutilus rutilus (l.) and other fish species. the high numerical dominance of perch and roach is typically for lowland water- ways (wolter & vilcinskas 1996b), and the combi- nation of all other, less abundant species was used to avoid an overemphasis of the presence of rare species (oberdorff et al. 1993). scientific and com- mon names of the “other” fish species recorded, their ecoethological guilds (spawning substratum: table 1. morphological characteristics of the waterways

in table 2. the morphological characteristics (table i) of all waterways were surveyed in 1994 and 1995. the various lengths of the embankments, tributaries etc. were measured from special navigational maps and the macrophyte coverage from aerial photos additionally determined (by measuring the area covered). all measurements were subsequently verified by boat while in the field, during july and august; for the bzk, tk, msp, osp, usp and ohk, this was carried out over each entire course length, but for other waterways at only representa- tive sections. the correspondence with map data found allowed an extrapolation to whole water- ways. it proves to be meaningful to simplify typical habitat classifications mentioned in the literature (bauer 1992, copp 1991, lacombe 1992), as width, depth and bottom substrate are widely leveled in the waterways. both shorelines of a waterway were surveyed separately, and the percen- tage of embankment was calculated from total bank length. macrophyte cover was assessed up to 1.5 m from the shoreline (any further away it was too deep and dark for submerged macrophytes) 176 and recorded following penczak & mann (1993) in four states (none to abundant). flow velocity was measured during medium discharge. riprap and sheet pile wall (table 1) were combined for the cal- i t 100 90 h 80 $ 70 1 60 .- - i 50 4 g 40 q 30 10 0 t 1 t riprap n=

embankment. though the number of fish caught was significant higher at sites with riprap (p<0.05, student’s t-test of inde- pendent samples), the relative abundance of spe- cies at both types of embankment was nearly the same (compare fig. 2). therefore, and because the selection of riprap or sheet pile wall for embank- ment depends only on land use and the available space for reconstruction, this combination seemed to be justfied. the kolmogorov-smirnov test was used to test the normal distribution of the original values for further calculations. it showed significant differ- ences from normal distribution for the variables flow velocity, depth variability and macrophyte cover. as kurtosis and skewness were also zo for all the variables, a non-normal distribution of data was supposed. therefore the spearman rank corre- lation was used for further calculations. calcu- lations and plots were performed with spss soft- ware package (spss, 1995, release 6.1.2). resu i ts

no significant influence on fish abundance was found with respect to the absolute percentage of tributaries, convex bank and groyne field, and macrophyte cover (table 4). significant changes in

abundance along a gradient of artificial embankment, involving a change from the numeri- cal dominance of roach to the dominance of perch in the fish assemblages. in the waterways with predominately natural shorelines (elbe, msp, uhw), perch were signifi- cantly (p<0.05, student's t ) less abundant (mean 15.4%, sd 8.2%) than were roach (mean 38.9%, sd 4.1%) and other species (mean 45.7%, sd 8.6%). contrary to this, perch abundance (mean 42.2%, sd 8.8%) exceeded that of roach (32.7%), sd 7.8%) and other species (mean 25.0%, sd 7.6%) in waterways with predominately artificial shorelines. the differences in the mean relative abundance of perch (increase) and other species (decrease) were also significant between both types of waterways ( f y 0 . 0 5 , student's t). similar observations were made with respect to biomass: in the more natural waterways, roach was the dominate species (22.4% of total biomass, sd 5.4%) and in the more artificial waterways perch dominated (26.5% of total bio- mass, sd 2.8%). the relative biomass of perch in the more natural waterways was 6.8% (sd 3.0%) and 19.0% (s 9.1%) for roach within the more artificial waterways. in contrast to the abundance data, the correlations between the relative biomass and embankment type were not statistically significant (table 4). roach was nu- merous in all waters, independent of channel morphology. no notable changes could be re- lated to the type of embankment. discussion all the waterways investigated were polytrophic to hypertrophic (baume & marcinek 1993, behr- endt & opitz 1995, blume et al. 1979, gunkel & mast 1990, spott 1995), which are conditions favorable to cyprinid species, especially roach (persson 1991, 1994, persson et al. 1991). corre- sponding observations were made in the waterways surveyed with predominately natural shorelines, and were also reported from the rivers rhone (carrel & rivier 1996) and from the seine basin (oberdorff & hughes 1992). in the seine basin the percentage of roach increased with degradation and roach became dominant at highly disturbed sites, and so oberdorff & hughes (1992) suggested this species as indicator for degradation. in the lowland waterways, roach were abundant at all sites (compare fig. 2) and therefore unsuitable as indicator. in highly productive waters, the com- petitive superiority of cyprinids involves roach out- competing juvenile perch (persson & greenberg 1990). therefore, the numerical dominance of roach could be expected in all waterways studied. contrary to this, perch was the dominant species in waterways with a higher percentage of artificial embankment . 3) what factors could have influenced the ob- served shifts in the fish assemblages of perch versus roach? limited food resources favor roach (bergmann 1990, bergmann & greenberg 1994, persson 1983, 1986, persson & greenberg 1990). therefore, it was assumed that the available food resources were not a determining factor. a decrease in the roach population as a reason for an increase in perch (persson 1986) was also ex- cluded, because no significant changes in the roach populations were observed between the different waterways and years (vilcinskas & wolter 1993, 1994, wolter & vil- cinskas 1996a, b). another factor mentioned in the literature (persson 1991, persson et al. 1991), affecting interaction between roach and perch is the structural complexity of submerged (table the perch as an indicator species vegetation within the habitat. perch are competi- tively favored over roach within submerged veg- etation (persson 1991, persson et al. 1991). be- cause the macrophyte cover detected in the waterways was generally low, this was excluded as reason for the dominance of perch. with the exception of the ohk, all waterways with a higher abundance of perch possessed only weakly developed stands of submerged macro- phytes. considering the results of persson (1991) and persson et al. (1991), the opposite can there- fore be expected, i.e., that roach should be dominant. these findings do not contradict the known mechanisms for intra- or interspecific interac- tions (bergmann 1990, bergmann & greenberg 1994, persson 1983, 1986, 1991, 1994, persson & greenberg 1990, persson et al. 1991), because they are applicable in the waterways with pre- dominately natural shorelines, but they show their relative inefficiency under human impact. the habitat degradation and simplification caused by artificial embankments became an im- portant factor for structuring these fish com- munities because they promote high abundances of perch against the natural competitive mechan- isms. therefore the abundance of perch seems to be a useful indicator for structural degradations in waterways. what is the actual factor that could have pro- moted the increase of perch? we assume that perch profits by an ontogenetic habitat shift: many authors report movements of postlarval perch off- shore to the epilimnion until they reach a length of 2 cm (cf. thorpe 1977). roach larvae prefer lentic, shallow waters (copp 1990, 1992a, b, copp et al. 1994, garner 1996). for example, in the ohk the convex banks seemed to be the only habitat suitable for roach larvae. similar structures (shallow areas and submerged macrophytes) in the rectificated waterway reaches were not inhabited. one possible reason for that could be the observed high mortality to larvae as a result of shipping, especially by waves. larvae of roach and other cy- prinids were often washed ashore by the ship’s waves. from a total length greater than 25 mm, cyprinid larvae seemed to be not endangered by waves and colonized all of the waterway reaches. offshore the perch larvae were not detectably in- fluenced by the waves from ships. therefore, they were favored against roach under the named an- thropogenic influences. from our study and the published findings men- tioned above, we concluded that the habitat shift of perch larvae offshore to the epilimnion is one main reason for the observed dominance of perch in structurally degraded waterways. this hypo- 179 wolter & vilcinskas thesis has, however, not been empirically or ana- lytically verified. resumen 1. en las tierras bajas del nordeste de alemania estudiamos un total de 12 cursos de agua que representan mhs de 1291 km con un total de orilla de 2582 km. el muestreo de peces se realizo entre 1992 y 1995. con el fin de incluir las variaciones estacio- nales en la composicion de las especies, las capturas se realiza- ron tres veces a1 afio en cada localidad. 2. los datos fueron agrupados para cada localidad y curso de agua, y 10s peces fueron clasificados de acuerdo a su abundan- cia relativa, en tres categorias principales: percufeuviutilis (l.), rutilus rutilus (l.) y otras especies. en cada uno de 10s cursos estudiados, utilizando mapas de navegacion y fotos atireas, me- dimos las siguientes caracteristicas morfologicas, que, poste- riormente verificamos con un barco: proporcion de 10s diferen- tes tipos de orillas, cobertura de macrofitas, profundidad, an- chura y velocidad de la corriente. en las 278 localidades investigadas, colectamos un total de 64.524 peces. 3. en 10s cursos de agua con predominancia de orillas naturales p. ,fluviatilis fue significativamente menos abundante (1 5.4%,, sd=8.2) que r. rutilus (38.9‘%, sd=4.1) y que otras especies (45.7%, sd=8.6). por el contrario, la abundancia de p. fluviati- lis (42.2%, sd=8.8) super6 a la de k . rutilus (32.7%, sd=7.8) y a la de otras especies (25.00/0, sd=7.6) en las cursos con pre- dominancia de orillas artificiales. 4. detectamos las siguientes correlaciones (spearman) signifi- cativas: correlaciones positivas entre la abundancia relativa de p. jluviutilis y orillas artificiales; abundancia relativa de otras especies y orillas naturales, varbabdidad en la profundidad, ve- locidad de la corriente y numero de afluentes. correlaciones negativas entre la abundancia relativa de otras especies y las orillas artificiales, abundancia relativa de p. fluviutilis y orillas naturales, variabilidad de profundidades y velocidad de la cor- riente. 5. correlaciones entre la abundancia de peces y el tip0 de orilla, mostraron que p. fluviutilis es numtiricamente dominante en aqutillas con predominancia de orillas artificiales, lo que sugiere que esta especie puede ser utilizada como indicador de la degra- dacion estructural de aguas corrientes. acknowledgement we thank otfried wustemann and ingo brummer for
