age-0 rainbow smelt were very abundant in 2001 (up to 6 ﬁsh per m2) and age-1 and older were abundant (up to 1.2 ﬁsh per m2) in 2002. growth rates and densities varied among areas and years. we used model selection on eight area–year-speciﬁc variables to investigate biologically plausible predictors of rainbow smelt growth rates. the best supported model of growth rates of age-0 smelt indicated a negative relationship with age-0 density, likely associated with intraspeciﬁc competition for zooplankton. the next best-ﬁt model had age-1 density as a predictor of age-0 growth. the best supported models (n = 4) of growth rates of age-1 ﬁsh indicated a positive relationship with availability of age-0 smelt and resulting levels of cannibalism. other plausible models were contained variants of these parameters. cannibalistic rainbow smelt consumed younger conspeciﬁcs that were up to 53% of their length. prediction of population dynamics for rainbow smelt requires an understanding of the relationship between density and growth as age-0 ﬁsh outgrow their main predators (adult smelt) by autumn in years with fast growth rates, but not in years with slow growth rates. key words: growth rates; rainbow smelt; lake champlain; density dependence; zooplanktivore introduction individual growth rates of most ﬁsh are mediated by biotic interactions (i.e., predation and competition) that are size and density dependent. speciﬁcally, predator–prey interactions are size dependent as ﬁsh typically grow through a gauntlet of different preda- tors during their ﬁrst year of life (luecke et al. 1990; olson et al. 1995; claessen et al. 2002; bystro¨m et al. 2003). the length of time during which a ﬁsh is vulnerable to different predators depends on individ- ual growth rate. compensatory mortality (higher mortality rate when initial density is high) can occur when growth of age-0 ﬁsh is density dependent, leading to slow growth of members of abundant cohorts and longer duration of vulnerability to gape- limited predators. for example, individuals from dense, slow growing cohorts of perch (perca spp.) were vulnerable to predation at older ages than fast growing cohorts (nielsen 1980; persson et al. 2000; irwin et al. 2009). thus, understanding what deter- mines growth rates to predicting the outcome of predator–prey interactions and future year class strength. is central correspondence: d. l. parrish, u. s. geological survey, vermont cooperative fish and wildlife research unit, rubenstein school of environment and natural resources, university of vermont, burlington, vt 05405, usa. e-mail: dparrish@uvm.edu present addresses: *annisquam river marine fisheries station, massachusetts division of marine fisheries, 30 emerson avenue, gloucester, ma 01930, usa.  school of aquatic and fishery sciences, university of washington, box 355020, seattle, wa 98195, usa. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00472.x 503 stritzel thomson et al. cannibalism is important in rainbow smelt (osmer- us mordax) and has been related to alternating year class strength commonly observed in great lakes populations (lantry & stewart 2000). in cannibalistic populations, growth rates in the ﬁrst year are also important for determining when a cohort is large enough to become cannibalistic (claessen et al. 2000; claessen & deroos 2003). in lake champlain, cannibalism is the major source of mortality for age- 0 rainbow smelt from june to september (parker- stetter et al. 2007). vertical overlap and density were important predictors of cannibalism (parker-stetter et al. 2007); however, sizes of prey and predators, especially in the fall, also inﬂuence the rate of cannibalism as adult rainbow smelt are small relative to their prey and age-0 ﬁsh may outgrow their vulnerability to cannibalism. if growth is density dependent, slower growth of large cohorts would make them vulnerable to cannibalism for a longer time period, which would contribute to decreased survival of large cohorts (compensatory mortality). thus, understanding rainbow smelt population dynamics requires consideration of factors affecting their growth rates including density dependence. growth rates of ﬁsh can be affected by prey type. for example, ﬁsh and mysis have double the energy density of zooplankton (lantry & stewart 1993); thus, consumption of these larger prey items can result in faster growth rates. larger prey, especially mysids, are also rich in essential fatty acids that improve survival in cold temperatures (snyder & hennessey 2003; schlechtriem et al. 2008). in addition, as most ﬁsh undergo ontogenetic diet shifts, knowing the diets of a cohort will provide a greater understanding of a prey population and its ﬂuctuations (vinni et al. 2004). in this paper, we analyse the growth patterns of age- 0 and age-1 rainbow smelt in lake champlain using data from 2001 and 2002, two years with dramatically different initial year class strength (parker-stetter et al. 2007). we used model selection with the akaike information criterion (aic) to explore biologically plausible explanations for growth rates of the two age groups, concentrating on densities of the different age groups and the proportion of different diet items. we chose density and diet variables known to affect individual growth rates of ﬁsh (boisclair & leggett 1989; tonn et al. 1994). we also present information on the size ratio of cannibalistic rainbow smelt and their prey, as this relationship is important in rainbow smelt population dynamics. study area lake champlain is bordered by vermont, new york, usa and the province of quebec, canada (fig. 1). 504 fig. 1. lake champlain, bounded by the states vermont and new york, usa; and the province of quebec, canada. the four sampling areas (inland sea, malletts bay, north main lake and south main lake) were used in 2001 and 2002. black zig-zag lines indicate acoustic and trawl transects. lake champlain is a deep, mesotrophic, dimictic lake that is 193 km long and has an average width of 6.3 km (hunkins et al. 1999). we sampled three lake sub-basins: malletts bay, inland sea and the main lake (fig. 1). for this study, the main lake was partitioned into two areas: north and south main lake. malletts bay has two shallow openings, one to the main lake and the other to the inland sea, that are presumed to restrict inward and outward movement of rainbow smelt. malletts bay contains 2.8% of the lake volume and has a mean depth of 13.2 m with a maximum depth of 32 m (potash et al. 1969). the inland sea is separated from the main lake by a chain of islands running north–south, but has a shallow outlet to the main lake in the north. the inland sea contains 13.5% of the lake volume and has a mean depth of 12.8 m with a maximum depth of 49 m (potash et al. 1969). the main lake is the largest and deepest of the areas, containing 82% of the lake volume, with an average depth of 29 m and a maximum depth of 122 m (potash et al. 1969; hun- kins et al. 1999). rainbow smelt are abundant in all lake areas, whereas mysis are found primarily in the main lake. materials and methods sampling rainbow smelt and zooplankton rainbow smelt density was obtained from acoustic surveys in offshore (>20 m) habitats during july and september in 2001 (22–25 july and 16–20 september) and 2002 (21–24 july and 15–18 september). we used a 70-khz split-beam echosounder (simrad ey500, simrad fisheries, lynnwood, wa, usa, 11.4° 3-db beam width, 0.2 ms pulse length). acoustic data were collected along zig-zag transects in all four areas (fig. 1). in 2002, more transects were added in the inland sea to provide greater coverage. the transducer was deployed on a towed body at a depth of 1 m and a )1. data collection began at vessel speed of 11 kmæh least 1 h after sunset and ended at least 1 h before sunrise to ensure that the ﬁsh were dispersed and to minimise the effect of bubbles released by ﬁsh during vertical migration (rudstam et al. 2003). mid-water and tucker trawls were used during the acoustic survey to identify acoustic targets and to obtain specimens for diet analysis. the mid-water trawl (5 m2 opening, graduated mesh of 20.3, 10.2, 3.5, 3.2 and 2.9 cm) was used to target age-1 and older rainbow smelt and age-0 rainbow smelt were targeted with the tucker trawl (2 m2 opening, 500-lm mesh net). both nets were deployed with a depth sounder on the headrope. trawling was used to identify the composi- tion of aggregations observed on the acoustics. the mid- water and tucker trawls were ﬁshed for 5–30 m at depths between 0 and 50 m. total length (mm) was measured in the ﬁeld for age-1 and older rainbow smelt (and age-0 in september). as age-0 specimens in july were too small to measure in the ﬁeld, they were preserved in 95% ethanol and measured in the labora- tory. age-0 and age-1 and older rainbow smelt were ﬂash frozen on dry ice for diet analysis. zooplankton samples were collected each evening before hydroacoustics and trawling transects began in a lake area. a collapsible 0.5-m dia., 64-lm mesh zooplankton net was used to vertically sample 10 m of water from each stratum (epilimnion, metalimnion and hyplimnion) as determined by temperature and dis- solved oxygen proﬁles (stritzel thomson 2006). samples were preserved in 95% ethanol. acoustic analysis acoustics was used to obtain density estimates for age-0 and age-1 and older rainbow smelt. we separated the two age groups using vertical separation in the water growth rates of rainbow smelt column because of the known temperature preferences and an analysis of in situ target strength (ts) distribu- tions. details on the ts analysis are in parker-stetter et al. (2006, 2007). mysids were present only below the thermocline in the main lake, so they did not affect age- 0 rainbow smelt estimates in the epilimnion. mysids are also not likely to contribute substantially to volume backscattering of age-1 and older rainbow smelt located below the thermocline as mysids have a ts around )85 db at 70 khz (rudstam et al. 2008). rainbow smelt densities were calculated in 100-m sections in july surveys and 400-m sections in septem- ber surveys using standard methodology (simmonds & maclennan 2005). volume backscattering was scaled to density using the average in situ backscattering cross- sections (linear version of ts) extracted with echoview 3.25 (sonardata 2004). acoustic survey track lengths ranged from 20 km in malletts bay to 70 km in the north main lake. average densities and variances for age-0 and age-1 and older rainbow smelt were obtained using geostatistics (rivoirard et al. 2000). to quantify age-1 density from the age-1 and older estimates, we scaled total age-1 and older density using the proportion of age-1 ﬁsh based on otolith interpretation in the vermont fish and wildlife department (vtfw) annual rainbow smelt trawling survey (vtfw 2003). although ageing rainbow smelt is difﬁcult (walsh et al. 2008), the separation of age-1 ﬁsh from older ages was conﬁrmed by length distributions and by the consistent increase in age of dominant cohorts to at least age 3 (nick staats, u.s. fish and wildlife service, lake champlain fish and wildlife resources complex, essex junction, vt, personal communication). fish diet and zooplankton analysis in the laboratory, thawed rainbow smelt were weighed (nearest g) and measured (tl, nearest mm). for each lake area and season, a maximum of 10 rainbow smelt per size class (70–120, 121–170 and >171 mm) were examined. stomachs were removed and contents were identiﬁed and counted. zooplankton were enumerated by whole organism when possible but if stomach contents were highly digested, only heads of inverte- brates were counted to prevent overestimation. stom- ach fullness in rainbow smelt was assessed using a modiﬁcation the hynes-thompson method (thompson 1959) for estimating diet volume and proportion of each diet item. partially digested ﬁsh in rainbow smelt stomachs were identiﬁed to species through vertebral counts, presence or absence of pharyngeal teeth, and other morphological character- istics such as ﬂesh coloration. total length of prey ﬁsh was measured when possible. of zooplankton samples were identiﬁed to the lowest practical taxa (species in most cases), lengths taken, 505 stritzel thomson et al. and counted as whole or subsamples. samples were processed under a dissecting microscope with a digitising pad attached, interfaced with quickmeasure software (summit technology group 1993). subsam- ples (1 ml each) were examined until 100 individual zooplankters were identiﬁed to species for each sample. total and species-speciﬁc abundance were calculated by strata and lake area for both years. )3) was calculated from dry zooplankton biomass (gæm weights obtained using length regression formulae. zooplankton production estimates were calculated according to kuns and sprules (2000). ageing and growth rates we aged a subsample of trawl-captured rainbow smelt (n = 208 from 2001 and n = 276 from 2002). sagittal otolith pairs were removed from frozen age-0 and age- 1 and older specimens and stored dry. to prepare for ageing, the dorsal-ventral surface of one otolith from each pair was lightly sanded using 600-grit sandpaper and polished using 900-grit sandpaper. the otolith was then placed in a dark tray and covered with 95% ethanol to clear. using a dissection microscope, age was interpreted from the number of annuli between the nucleus and the otolith edge, along the longest anterior radius. we calculated two different growth rates for age-0 and age-1 rainbow smelt. instantaneous growth rates (igr) were calculated for age-0 rainbow smelt because the growth trajectory is presumed to be exponential absolute growth rates (agr) were calculated for age-1 rainbow smelt as their growth is presumed to be on a linear trajectory (boisclair & leggett 1989). (ricker 1975). conversely, igr ¼ loge wf   loge wi dt agr ¼ wf   wi dt where, wf is the ﬁnal weight (g), wi is the initial weight (g), dt is the number of days between initial and ﬁnal weight. average number of days was 58; however, the range extended to 90 days for age-0 ﬁsh in the north main lake in 2002 because we did not collect any age-0 ﬁsh in july of 2002 in that area. we did not catch sufﬁcient numbers of age-2 and older classes for similar analysis. model selection we established a biologically plausible set of models (following burnham & anderson 2002) to explain the growth rates of rainbow smelt. analyses were 506 (i) age-0 density, (ii) age-1 density, restricted to multiple linear regression models. we used four independent variables for age-0 rainbow smelt: (iii) proportion of preferred zooplankton in the diet [cal- anoid copepods and daphnids, as determined by selectivity indices (stritzel thomson 2006)] and (iv) proportion of mysis in the diet. for age-1 rainbow smelt, the models included the variables (i–iv) above and (v) proportion of ﬁsh in the diet (table 1). we did not include ﬁsh in the diet as an explanatory variable for age-0 ﬁsh as no age-0 piscivores occurred in our samples. we used aic to evaluate and compare the infor- mation content of a suite of multiple linear regression models (proc glm: sas institute 1999). for this analysis, each lake area–year combination was con- sidered an independent sample of growth, diets and density for a total of eight area–lake combinations. residual sum of squares was used in the estimation of r2 and the aicc (aic corrected for small sample sizes, burnham & anderson 2002). the difference between the aicc for what was determined to be the best model and the aicc for each subsequent model i (di) was used to compare and rank the different models. generally, models showing a di of £2.0 are considered supported by the data and plausible alternatives to the best-ﬁt model (burnham & ander- son 2002). akaike weights, wi , were calculated and used to scale and interpret the relative likelihood of the di values. data are presented by each area; however, for analyses of density, diet and growth rate, data were pooled for all areas across each summer by year and age class. thus, our results are focused on annual and age class categories across the lake. results densities of age-0 and age-1 rainbow smelt differed between years (fig. 2). in 2001, densities of age-0 rainbow smelt were 4 to 37 times greater than densities of age-1 ﬁsh in the four lake areas. conversely, in 2002 there was a small year class of age-0 ﬁsh and age-1 rainbow smelt densities were 9 to 18 times greater than age-0 densities. total density of age-1 and older rainbow smelt ranged from 0.6 to 1.58 ﬁsh per m2 and densities of age-2 and older ﬁsh were low (range 0.01 to 0.08 ﬁsh per m2). diets and growth rates age-0 rainbow smelt were primarily zooplanktivorous with a few occurrences of mysis and other inverte- brates. age-0 (2001, n = 249; 2002, n = 139) contained a greater propor- tion of daphnids and bosminids than other zooplank- rainbow smelt stomachs table 1. growth rate, density and diet variables and individual growth patterns for age-0 and age-1 rainbow smelt from july to september in 2001 and 2002 in lake champlain. growth rates of rainbow smelt growth rate stomachs proportion in diet density )2) (m zooplankton biomass (gæm )3) n (gæd)1) total (empty) preferred zooplankton other zooplankton mysis fish misc. 2.088 0.281 4.330 0.700 6.105 0.418 3.935 0.650 0.025 0.177 0.074 0.180 0.008 0.196 0.037 0.183 0.332 0.790 0.252 0.234 1.022 0.150 0.157 0.219 0.332 0.790 0.252 0.234 1.022 0.150 0.157 0.219 16 (0.033) 30 (0.045) 14 (0.019) 16 (0.045) 15 (0.019) 23 (0.071) 19 (0.042) 20 (0.054) 56 ()0.015) 15 (0.047) 76 (0.095) 28 (0.001) 73 (0.138) 46 (0.070) 42 (0.039) 25 (0.055) 43 (20) 23 (6) 79 (23) 32 (4) 75 (15) 54 (3) 52 (17) 31 (11) 20 (4) 46 (12) 30 (3) 52 (5) 20 (2) 56 (10) 10 (0) 41 (2) 0.56 0.31 0.49 0.52 0.62 0.30 0.57 0.60 0.63 0.57 0.47 0.36 0.65 0.64 0.45 0.60 0.26 0.51 0.49 0.29 0.30 0.60 0.32 0.38 0.30 0.33 0.44 0.62 0.13 0.28 0.15 0.34 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.00 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.06 0.29 0.04 na na na na na na na na 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.00 0.14 0.00 0.08 0.00 0.18 0.18 0.02 0.18 0.05 0.09 0.01 0.02 0.07 0.09 0.06 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.04 0.02 site year age 0 is 2001 is 2002 mb 2001 mb 2002 nml 2001 nml 2002 sml 2001 sml 2002 age 1 is 2001 is 2002 mb 2001 mb 2002 nml 2001 nml 2002 sml 2001 sml 2002 preferred zooplankton were calanoid copepods and daphnids. other zooplankton were holopedium gibberum, bosminids, cyclopoid copepods, unidentiﬁable zooplankton and nauplii. misc. items were leptodora kindtii, amphipoda, osctracoda, chaoborus larva, chironomids, terrestrial insects, water mites, bivalvia and unknown. n, number of rainbow smelt collected;

(2001, n = 80; 2002, ters. age-1 rainbow smelt n = 195) were mostly zooplanktivorous, but also ate mysis and ﬁsh, usually age-0 rainbow smelt. in 2002, age-1 diets were less diverse than those in 2001, i.e., stomach contents were almost exclusively zooplank- ton (table 1). a small portion (3%) of age-0 rainbow smelt consumed mysis in july and september 2001 and in september 2002. mysivory occurred in the larger age- 0 smelt (average total length > 60 mm). in areas where mysis were present, more mysis were consumed by age-0 rainbow smelt in 2001 than in 2002 (table 1). age-1 rainbow smelt consumed mysis during all time periods in 2001 and 2002. in 2001, 76% of age-1 rainbow smelt consumed mysis, but only 17% did in 2002. piscivory was more prevalent in 2001 than 2002. no age-0 ﬁsh were piscivorous. for age-1 rainbow smelt, 44% (n = 35) were cannibalistic in 2001 but only one individual was in 2002. one 100-mm rainbow smelt contained an age-0 walleye (sander vitreus) in its stomach, the only identiﬁed ﬁsh that was not rainbow smelt. fish that were too digested to be identiﬁed were likely rainbow smelt. rainbow smelt consumed ﬁsh up to 53% of their body length, and prey size was positively correlated with predator size (fig. 3). growth rates of age-0 rainbow smelt were different between years and across lake areas and )1 (table 1). age-0 ranged from 0.019 to 0.071

lake areas had faster growth rates than those in the inland sea for both years (table 1). model evaluation linear regressions between the dependent variable (age-0 growth rate) and four independent variables (fig. 4) indicated that age-0 growth rate was positively related to age-1 density and was negatively related to the other variables [age-0 density, proportions of preferred zooplankton (calanoid copepod or daphnid) and mysis]. regressions (based on the same set of variables plus age-0 density) for age-1 growth were not as strong, i.e., only age-0 density and proportion of ﬁsh in the diet were signiﬁcant (fig. 5). our aic results indicated that the model of age-0 density alone had the most support (wi = 0.56) for explaining age-0 growth rates (table 2). in this single variable model, age-0 growth had a negative relation- ship with age-0 density (fig. 4a). the next best-ﬁt model had age-1 density as the best predictor of age-0 growth (di = 1.04; fig. 4b) and was therefore also supported by the data (burnham & anderson 2002). however, the correlation was positive, which would suggest that age-0 growth rate increases when age-1 abundance is high (fig. 4). three

0.21) and the fourth was somewhat less supported (wi = 0.12, table 2). the best model included a positive relationship with the proportion of ﬁsh in the diet (fig. 5e). the next best model contained three parameters, age-0 density (positive relationship), age-1 density (negative relationship) and proportion of preferred zooplankton consumed (posi- tive relationship). the third best model included only age-0 density (positive relationship, fig. 5a). as the three models had almost they should all be considered as models that explain age-1 growth. a fourth model, containing the predictor variables of age-0 (positive relationship) and age-1 (negative relationship), had a di < 2.0; densities the wi value was approximately one-half however, that of the three models with the greatest weight. note that the proportion of ﬁsh in the diet and the density of age-0 rainbow smelt were correlated (r2 = 0.50) and one of these two variables were included in all top models, suggesting that age-1 growth increased when more age-0 ﬁsh are available as prey. identical wi values, 509 stritzel thomson et al. discussion them to be different expressions of our results indicate that individual growth rates of age-0 and age-1 rainbow smelt are affected by different factors. age-0 growth rates are negatively related to age-0 density. all supported models for age-1 growth included either proportion of ﬁsh in the diet or abundance of age-0 ﬁsh. therefore, we consider the same process, i.e., growth of age-1 rainbow smelt is related to the abundance of age-0 smelt as potential prey. in this study, age-0 smelt abundance was highly correlated with proportion of ﬁsh in the diet of age-1 smelt. this is consistent with earlier analysis of the importance of cannibalism as a source of mortality of age-0 rainbow smelt (parker- stetter et al. 2007). apparent density-dependent growth of age-0 rainbow smelt may be a result of competition for zooplankton prey. although zooplankton were only collected monthly, densities were lower in 2001 than in 2002 for most time periods and lake areas (stritzel thomson 2006). using a bioenergetics model (lantry & stewart 1993), we estimated that consumption by age-0 rainbow smelt exceeded estimated zooplankton production in 2001, but not in 2002 (stritzel thomson 2006). density-dependent growth is common in ﬁsh (sogard 1997) and often affects younger age groups [yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), irwin et al. 2009; crucian carp (caras- sius carassius), tonn et al. 1994]. age-0 rainbow smelt rarely consumed mysis during the summer in lake champlain and this only occurred later in the summer when the rainbow smelt reached an average size of 60 mm. during summer months, spatial overlap of age-0 rainbow smelt and mysis is low because mysis avoid temperatures above 12 °c in lake ontario, mysis (boscarino et al. 2007). were important prey for age-0 rainbow smelt in the fall ⁄ winter (lantry & stewart 1993). our study ended in september, but an important component of age-0 rainbow smelt diets in lake champlain later in the year. likely mysis are for age-1 rainbow smelt, cannibalism appears to promote faster growth rates. because age-1 growth rates are positively correlated with age-0 density, age- 0 rainbow smelt are likely more important as potential prey for age-1 ﬁsh than as competitors for zooplankton resources. cannibalism and density of age-0 rainbow smelt are highly correlated, and both variables likely represent the same process. our results indicate that ﬁsh are an important prey item for age-1 rainbow smelt growth in lake champlain even though the maximum proportion of ﬁsh in the diet was 14%. consumption of mysis may also contribute to higher growth rates, as age-1 rainbow smelt grew faster in the 510 main lake where mysids were abundant. in the great lakes, mysids are often the dominant diet item for rainbow smelt where mysids occur, and ﬁsh are often in diets of rainbow smelt age-1 and older (lantry & stewart 1993). density-dependent growth rates of age-0 rainbow smelt have potential implications for the population dynamics of rainbow smelt in lake champlain. high densities of age-0 rainbow smelt result in reduced growth, making these ﬁsh vulnerable to predation for a longer time period. rainbow smelt is the most abundant piscivore in lake champlain and cannibal- ism can account for most of the observed mortality of age-0 rainbow smelt in 2001 and 2002 (parker-stetter et al. 2007). although adult rainbow smelt can feed on prey up to 53% of their body length, they are small piscivores (generally < 200 mm tl) and fast growth rates of age-0 ﬁsh would reduce vulnerability to predation by autumn. on the other hand, a slow growing cohort such as the 2001 year class in malletts bay would be vulnerable to predation throughout the winter and following spring as age-1 ﬁsh. in addition, small age-1 rainbow smelt are less likely to cannibalise the next cohort. thus, density- dependent growth will compensate for differences in initial cohort strength. many rainbow smelt popula- tions show strong periodicity in abundance that is often explained by cannibalism from age-1 and older ﬁsh (he & labar 1994; lantry & stewart 2000). thus, density-dependent growth is not sufﬁcient to compensate for increased abundance of age-1 canni- bals after a strong year class is produced. data such as presented in this paper are necessary to begin to explore the interactions between density, growth and cannibalism in cannibalism-based population dynam- ics models.
