(2002) showed igp provided a competitive advan- tage for non-native, stream-dwelling rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) over native, anadromous masu salmon (o. masou), facilitating rainbow trout invasion in japanese streams. by contrast, size-struc- tured igp may facilitate co-existence of endangered mohave tui chub (siphateles bicolor mohavensis) with non-native western mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia afﬁnis; stockwell & henkanaththegedara 2011; henkanaththegedara 2012). in both case studies, igp appeared to be size-structured based on predator gape-size limitation. to their the vulnerability of prey is often limited by the gape-size prey (hambright 1991, 1994; webb and shine 1993; predators relative of correspondence: c. a. stockwell, department of biological sciences ndsu department 2715, po box 6050, fargo, nd 58108-6050, usa. e-mail: craig.stockwell@ndsu.edu doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00587.x 11 henkanaththegedara & stockwell nilsson & bronmark 2000; magnhagen & heibo 2001). for example, magnhagen & heibo (2001) reported a positive correlation between gape-size of northern pike (exos lucius) and body depth of its pis- cine prey. predation risk is reduced as the prey grows and body depth exceeds the predator’s maximum gape-size (hambright et al. 1991; nilsson et al. 1995). therefore, predator gape-size and prey body depth may have important implications in a system where predation is structured based on relative body sizes of predator and prey. we reported reciprocal previously predation between endangered mohave tui chub and non-native western mosquitoﬁsh, where adult tui chubs preyed on adult and juvenile mosquitoﬁsh while mosqui- toﬁsh preyed on eggs and larvae of tui chubs (stockwell & henkanaththegedara 2011; henkanath- thegedara 2012). because these two species occupy the same feeding guild (88% dietary overlap; henk- anaththegedara 2012), this case of reciprocal preda- tion chub and western mosquitoﬁsh meets the criteria of igp. between mohave tui two lines of evidence suggest that igp between these two species is structured by gape-size limita- tion. first, male mosquitoﬁsh, which is the smaller sex of this dimorphic species, had very low survival (3%) compared to female mosquitoﬁsh (34%) in the presence of mohave tui chub. second, female mosquitoﬁsh that survived in the presence of adult tui chubs were relatively large. reciprocally, mosqui- toﬁsh preyed upon mohave tui chub larvae, which is also likely to be gape-limited (mills et al. 2004; henkanaththegedara 2012). here, we report the results of a series of laboratory predation trials designed explicitly to assess gape- limitation in the context of igp between mohave tui chub and western mosquitoﬁsh. we also present a prey vulnerability model (hambright et al. 1991) that allows us to evaluate how gape-size-limited predation affects each ﬁsh population. materials and methods tui chub predation experiment predation on adult western mosquitoﬁsh was assessed using adult mohave tui chubs (sexually monomor- phic) as candidate predators. we tested both adult male and female mosquitoﬁsh as candidate prey because mosquitoﬁsh are sexually dimorphic in size. sixty adult mohave tui chubs used in this experiment were collected in 2009 from lake tuendae (n = 23), camp cady (n = 27) and mc spring (n = 10; table 1) and transported to north dakota state uni- versity (ndsu). western mosquitoﬁsh were collected from deppe pond at the lewis center for academic excellence in apple valley, california, and trans- ported to ndsu. sixty 37.8-l glass aquaria were used as experimen- tal chambers. three vertical sides of each aquarium were covered with black plastic sheets to avoid any visual interference among tanks. aquaria were con- tinuously aerated by a centrally suspended aerator in each tank. a full spectrum light source was placed 35 cm above each tank, and a light cycle of 16-h light/8-h dark was used. this experimental design provided 30 replicates, using either male mosquitoﬁsh or female mosquito- ﬁsh allowing an assessment of tui chub predation on mosquitoﬁsh by sex. mohave tui chub predators were measured for total length (nearest 1 mm) and gape- size (nearest 0.01 mm). tui chub gape-size was table 1. mean size of mohave tui chub (siphateles bicolor mohavensis) and western mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia afﬁnis) utilised for predation experiments. adult mohave tui chubs were collected in 2009 from lake tuendae (n = 23), camp cady (n = 27) and mc spring (n = 10). larval tui chubs were provided from a captive stock at mojave national preserve. all western mosquitoﬁsh were collected from lake tuendae. one standard error is indicated in parenthesizes. experiment/measurement ♂ mosquitoﬁsh ♀ mosquitoﬁsh prey treatment mohave tui chubs as predators adult mohave tui chub total length (mm) gape-size (mm) adult western mosquitoﬁsh total length (mm) body depth (mm) mosquitoﬁsh as predators adult western mosquitoﬁsh total length (mm) gape-size (mm) larval mohave tui chub total length (mm) estimated body depth (mm) 12 101.70 (±2.68) 6.24 (±0.20) 30.00 (±0.29) 6.22 (±0.06) 26.02 (±0.66) 2.00 (±0.04) 13.78 (±0.48) 2.30 (±0.09) 105.50 (±2.43) 6.54 (±0.20) 40.72 (±0.79) 8.31 (±0.17) 38.12 (±0.88) 3.43 (±0.09) 14.67 (±0.54) 2.47 (±0.10) n 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 t-value p-value  1.049  1.057  12.742  11.404  11.013  14.590  1.243  1.243 >0.05 >0.05 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 >0.05 >0.05 (a) (b) (c) fig. 1. body depth measurements of a mohave tui chub larvae (siphateles bicolor mohavensis) (a), a mature male (b) and a preg- nant female (c) of western mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia afﬁnis). total measured from the ventral side (tui chubs have a subterminal mouth) as the linear distance between posterior limit of maxilla with mouth fully closed. mosquitoﬁsh were measured for length and body depth (nearest 0.01 mm). female mosquitoﬁsh body depths were measured at the base of pelvic ﬁns, while male mosquitoﬁsh body depths were measured at the deepest point of the gonopodial base (fig. 1). measured mosquitoﬁsh were kept in individual con- tainers prior to introduction into aquaria. mohave tui chubs assigned between the two treatments did not length (t =  1.05;

niﬁcantly smaller p < 0.001) and gape-size (t =  14.59; p < 0.001) compared to female mosquitoﬁsh (table 1). in total tui chub larvae were measured for total length (nearest 0.01 mm) using digital callipers, while rest- ing on a watch glass ﬁlled with a small amount of water. subsequently, tui chub larvae were monitored for at least 3-h following measurements to assess any handling associated mortality. body depths were dif- ﬁcult to measure on live tui chub larvae. therefore, we measured a sample of mohave tui chub larvae voucher specimens to derive a regression formula of body depth on total length [body depth = (0.1986 9 total length) 0.4251; r2 = 0.96; n = 148]. mohave tui chub larval body depth was measured at the mid- dle of the head (fig. 1). the average total length of mohave tui chub larvae exposed to mosquitoﬁsh predation did not signiﬁcantly differ between male and female mosquitoﬁsh treatments (t =  1.24; p > 0.05; table 1). adult mosquitoﬁsh were deprived of food for 24 h prior to being placed in a randomly selected experi- mental chamber. after the 4-h acclimatisation period, a single tui chub larva was introduced into each experimental chamber and its survival was monitored every 15 min over a 4-h test period and ttd was recorded for each tui chub larva. in a few cases, tui chub larvae died during the trial but were not consumed. these trials were excluded from the survival analyses. mosquitoﬁsh predation experiment statistical analysis mosquitoﬁsh predation on larval tui chubs was assessed using either adult male or adult female mos- quitoﬁsh as candidate predators and mohave tui chub larvae as candidate prey (table 1). for these trials, mosquitoﬁsh were obtained from a commercial stock from arizona (arizona aquatic gardens; www.azgar- dens.com). mohave tui chub larvae were provided by we conducted all statistical analyses using r statisti- cal software program version 2.11.0 (r development core team 2010). package survival was utilised to analyse prey survival (therneau & lumley 2009). this package uses the surv() function to simulta- neously evaluate ttd and the censoring information (0 = live; 1 = dead; maindonald & braun 2010). 13 henkanaththegedara & stockwell survival functions were estimated with kaplan–meier survival estimate (survﬁt function) using ttd data. hazard functions for treatment groups were tested using cox proportional hazards model (coxph func- tion). the ratio between prey body depth and predator gape width (here after depth/gape ratio) was utilised to assess gape-size limitation. in theory, predators could not consume prey larger than their gape-size (hambright et al. 1991); hence, the depth/gape ratio should be  1.0 for prey consumed and >1.0 for sur- vivors. we ran separate one-sample, two-tail t-tests (t.test function) with depth/gape ratios using a null hypothesis of l = 1 to detect any signiﬁcant deviations from 1 (when prey body depth = predator gape-size) after testing data for normality with a shapiro–wilk normality test (shapiro.test function). prey that were possibly killed by the predator but not consumed were excluded from these analyses (mos- quitoﬁsh as predator, n = 5; tui chubs as predator, n = 1). vulnerability modelling (1991) et al.’s hambright vulnerability model assumes that predator gape-size and prey body depth are the critical factors that determine the prey size ingested by a predator. relative vulnerability of prey (v) to predation was estimated as a function of prey body depth (d) and the frequency of predators’ gape- size (w) in the predator population. vd ¼ 1   xd w¼0 w prey with body depths larger than the gape-size of the largest individual of predator population were considered to be unavailable for predation (i.e., v = 0). however, prey with body depths smaller or equal to the gape-size of the smallest individual of the predator population were considered to be com- pletely vulnerable to all the predators in the commu- nity (i.e., v = 1). the prey with intermediate body depths are vulnerable to a proportion of the predator population depending on the body depth (0 < v < 1; hambright et al. 1991). tui relative vulnerabilities of adult mosquitoﬁsh to tui chub predation and larval chub to adult mosquitoﬁsh predation were determined using the cumulative gape-size frequency distributions of adult tui chubs and adult mosquitoﬁsh, respectively. to obtain the gape-size distribution of the lake tuendae tui chub population, we ﬁrst ran a regression of gape-size on total length for a sample of 114 preserved mohave tui chub specimens collected from four tui chub habitats (body depth = (0.0734 9 total 14 table 2. size of mohave tui chub (siphateles bicolor mohavensis) and western mosquitoﬁsh (gambusia afﬁnis) utilised for vulnerability modelling. adult mohave tui chub total lengths were measured in march 2009 from lake tuendae population, and gape-sizes were estimated using a regression of gape-size on total length. all western mosquitoﬁsh were collected from lake tuendae. s mohave tui chub adults total length (mm) estimated gape (mm) larvae total length (mm) depth (mm) western mosquitoﬁsh females total length (mm) gape (mm) depth (mm) males total length (mm) gape (mm) depth (mm) n average (±se) range 3651 3651 178 178 90 90 90 59 59 59 88.78 (±0.34) 6.56 (±0.02) 15.77 (±0.52) 2.70 (±0.10) 32.30 (±0.56) 2.76 (±0.05) 6.67 (±0.18) 25.30 (±0.25) 1.83 (±0.03) 5.06 (±0.07) 55.0–309.0 4.08–22.73 6.19–44.67 3.59–10.30 21.63–45.38 1.74–4.16 3.59–10.30 20.54–29.20 1.19–2.46 3.77–6.01 length) + 0.0479;

males = 59; table 2). the gape-size distribution for adult male mosquitoﬁsh and adult female mosquitoﬁsh were used to generate the respective vulnerability curves. we did not plot the larval size distribution because these data are not available and because each cohort of larval tui chubs will experience reduced vulnerability as they grow and eventually exceed the gape-size of mosquitoﬁsh. results tui chub predation experiment survival in the presence of tui chubs was signiﬁ- cantly lower (v2 = 11.33;

n = 22) was signiﬁcantly higher than 1.0 (t = 3.58; d.f. = 21; p = 0.0018). the depth/gape ratio of the tui chub larvae consumed by male mosquitoﬁsh was 1.06 (±0.13), but not tested because of small sample size (n = 3). vulnerability modelling treatments with male mosquitofish treatments with female mosquitofish 600 1200 1800 2400 3000 3600 4200 respectively vulnerability modelling revealed that mosquitoﬁsh with a body depth <4.6 mm were completely vulner- able (v = 1) to tui chub predation. this corresponds to total lengths of 25.4 and 23.3 mm for female and male mosquitoﬁsh, total length = (body depth + 3.0746)/0.3017;

however, vulnerability of tui chub larvae to predation by adult male mosquitoﬁsh reached zero at length = 15.2 mm; a body depth of 2.6 mm (total fig. 3b). reach body a discussion this study provided experimental evidence that igp between invasive western mosquitoﬁsh and native mohave tui chub is gape-size limited. correlated with their smaller size, male mosquitoﬁsh had higher vul- nerability to tui chub predation than female mosqui- toﬁsh. similar results were obtained from two mesocosm experiments, where tui chubs caused low survival rates for male mosquitoﬁsh compared to female mosquitoﬁsh (stockwell & henkanaththeged- ara 2011; henkanaththegedara 2012). furthermore, gape-size limitation was indicated by the larger depth/gape ratio of surviving male mosquitoﬁsh com- pared to nonsurvivors. the differential predation by male and female mosquitoﬁsh on tui chub larvae was also consistent with the gape-size limitation hypothesis. adult female mosquitoﬁsh reduced tui chub larval survival by 90%, whereas male mosquitoﬁsh only reduced tui chub larval survival by 27%. two lines of evidence suggest that mosquitoﬁsh predation on tui chub larvae was gape-limited. first, tui chub larval survival was notably lower female mosquitoﬁsh (larger gapes) than in the presence of male mosquitoﬁsh (smaller gapes). second, the depth/gape ratio was signiﬁcantly smaller than 1.0 for tui chub larvae consumed by female mosquitoﬁsh, whereas the few survivors all had relatively larger body depths. the gape-size limitation of mosquitoﬁsh predation on larvae of native minnows was also reported where mosquitoﬁsh co-occur with native in the presence of 16 least chub (iotichthys phlegethontis). the survival of large young-of-the-year chub was greater than that of smaller yoy least chub (mills et al. 2004). (yoy) least vulnerability modelling showed that gape-size limitation is likely to have important differential effects on survival of male mosquitoﬁsh at lake tuendae. overall, the size frequency distribution of mosquitoﬁsh from lake tuendae suggests that all mosquitoﬁsh have some vulnerability to tui chub predation. however, male mosquitoﬁsh are more vulnerable to predation because of their relatively smaller body sizes compared to female mosquitoﬁsh. vulnerability modelling also showed that all newly hatched tui chub larvae (total length = 6.56 ± 0.04 mm; n = 30) are completely vulnerable to both adult male and female mosquitoﬁsh predation. however, tui chub larvae may reach a com- plete size refuge from male and female mosquitoﬁsh as they grow. in addition to gape-size limitation, other aspects of predator–prey interactions such as adaptations of pre- dators and antipredator behaviour of prey may play a role in igp between tui chubs and mosquitoﬁsh. for (1991) the vulnerability model proposed by hambright et al. is exceptionally liberal, because it assumes complete vulnerability to predation, if prey body depth is less that predator gape-size, is depth/gape ratios  1.0. in our experiments, depth/ gape ratio for consumed prey ranged from 0.7 (mos- quitoﬁsh predators) to 0.9 (tui chub predators), which would reduce proportion of population vulnerable to predation (also see truemper & lauer 2005). that it is important collectively, our previous experiments (stockwell & henkanaththegedara 2011; henkanaththegedara 2012) and the work described here provide evidence for gape-limited intraguild predation for this study system. size-structured igp has been suggested as an important mechanism, allowing co-existence of vari- ous interacting predatory communities (polis et al. 1989), and may be an important mechanism, facilitat- ing co-existence of mohave tui chub and western mosquitoﬁsh. however, to consider other mechanisms that may facilitate co-existence of these two species. for example, spatial and temporal niche segregation could also facilitate co-existence (see mchugh et al. 2012) of tui chubs and mosquito- ﬁsh, but it appears that there is considerable overlap in habitat use. larval tui chubs occupy the shallow areas of lake tuendae where mosquitoﬁsh abun- dance is high, making tui chub larvae vulnerable to mosquitoﬁsh predation (s.m. henkanaththegedara, personal observations). further, adult tui chubs forage very actively in the shallow areas at night (s.m. henkanaththegedara, personal observations), making mosquitoﬁsh vulnerable to adult tui chub predation. example, weak swimming ability of tui chub larvae (s.m. henkanaththegedara, personal observations) may increase the vulnerability of tui chub larvae to mosquitoﬁsh predation. additionally in the wild, fac- tors that affect the detection distance of prey such as larval size, visual contrast and water clarity (vinyard & o’brien 1976) may play important in mosquitoﬁsh predation on larval tui chubs. however with growth, tui chub larvae may escape mosquito- ﬁsh predation because of deep bodies coupled with improved predator detection ability and swimming ability (see folkvord & hunter 1986). roles this case of igp could have important evolution- ary implications for both species. because mosquito- ﬁsh predation on tui chub larvae is size selective, larvae with faster growth rates are expected to have a role of gape-limitation in intraguild predation survival advantage over slow-growing conspeciﬁcs under gape-limited predation (stearns 1992; sogard 1997); thus, igp could select for faster growth rates in mohave tui chub larvae. this case of igp may also have important evolutionary effects on mosquito- ﬁsh. first, relatively higher vulnerability of male mosquitoﬁsh to tui chub predation could skew adult sex ratios of mosquitoﬁsh. altered sex ratios may alter the strength of sexual selection (ashman & diefenderfer 2001; wade et al. 2003). second, higher vulnerabilities of male mosquitoﬁsh may have effects on life-history evolution. unlike female mosquitoﬁsh, male mosquitoﬁsh have a determinate-like growth pattern (hughes 1986), making them vulnerable to tui chub predation throughout their entire lifespan. the relatively higher predation pressure on thus, table 3. size-dependent impacts of western mosquitoﬁsh, gambusia afﬁnis, and eastern mosquitoﬁsh, g. holbrooki (indicated with †), on native ﬁsh species. no. species impacted 1 2 dwarf livebearer† heterandria formosa dwarf livebearer† h. formosa 5 6 7 4 3 white sands pupﬁsh cyprinodon tularosa spanish toothcarps† aphanius iberus and valencia hispanica big bend gambusia gambusia gagei paciﬁc blue-eye† pseudomugil signifer gila topminnow poeciliopsis occidentalis sonoran topminnow p. occidentalis sonoran topminnow p. o. sonorensis least chub iotichthys phlegethontis rainbowﬁsh rhadinocentris ornatus 12 white river springﬁsh 10 11 8 9 13 14 crenichthys baileyi barrens topminnow fundulus julisia black mudﬁsh neochanna diversus 15 mohave tui chub siphateles bicolor mohavensis green sunﬁsh lepomis cyanellus largemouth bass micropterus salmoides 17 16 mosquitoﬁsh interaction(s) with native ﬁsh species* maximum body size (mm) approach reference signiﬁcant negative effect of population growth size selective predation on small individuals signiﬁcant impact on population size and biomass heavy predation on juveniles endangerment of local populations lack of recruitment and reduced growth of adults rapid replacement from most of its native range replacement in native range possibly by predation on of juveniles population decline by presumed mosquitoﬁsh predation reduction of survival and growth rate of larva/ juveniles by predation apparent displacement from native habitat population decline by presumed mosquitoﬁsh predation reduced survival of larva/juveniles by predation, injury risk to adults predation of mudﬁsh larvae overall co-existence may be due to spatial/ temporal habitat partitioning predation of tui chub larvae tui chub predation on mosquitoﬁsh predation of sunﬁsh larvae sunﬁsh predation on mosquitoﬁsh largemouth bass predation on mosquitoﬁsh 36 36 50 52* 54 56‡ 60 60 60 64 65‡ 90 94 106* 300* 310 970 me me me me fo me fo lydeard & belk (1993) belk & lydeard (1994) rogowski & stockwell (2006) rincon et al.
