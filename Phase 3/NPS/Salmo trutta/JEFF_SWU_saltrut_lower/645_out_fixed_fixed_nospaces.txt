(ii) examining a newly-established pumpkinseed population following a ﬂood event in 2007; and (iii) comparing the growth and life-history traits of this new population with ﬁsh collected from the source population to demonstrate how the pumpkinseed’s life-history plasticity contributes to its success as a coloniser. using bayesian modelling, we determined that the number of pumpkinseed escapees is likely to increase with increasing discharge. the newly-established pumpkinseed population showed fast juvenile growth, early age at maturity and small size at maturity. these traits differed signiﬁcantly from the source population, speciﬁcally total length (tl) means at ages 1 and 2 were signiﬁcantly greater in the new population, whereas tl at age 4 was signiﬁcantly greater in the source population, and a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of mature females were found at smaller size classes in the newly established pumpkinseed population. this study demonstrates the potential link between hydrological variability (current and future) and the dispersal of non-native pumpkinseed, leading to the establishment of new populations. key words: alien species; bayesian modelling; propagule pressure; global warming introduction invasive species are becoming an increasing concern worldwide, as general principles of invasive biology suggest that most aspects of climate change will favour non-native species (dukes & mooney 1999;

hellmann et al. 2008; rahel & olden 2008; graham & harrod 2009). shifting habitat suitability can also potentially weaken a native species’ ability to compete with recently intro- duced species if environmental conditions become unfavourable to the native species (byers 2002; hell- mann et al. 2008). these environmental changes are expected to impact the distribution and phenology of species (parmesan 2006; rahel & olden 2008), facil- itate invasions by some currently noninvasive species and increase the dispersal and possibly the impact of some established invasive species (hellmann et al. 2008; rahel & olden 2008; graham & harrod 2009). in the united kingdom, current predictions of southern england include an future climate for increased mean temperature of 3–5 °c, reduced discharges and increased hydrological variability (jenkins et al. 2009). these altered discharge regimes are likely to create new pathways of introduction for non-native species into novel environments, leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of con- nectivity between ﬂoodplain aquaculture facilities and adjacent water courses during ﬂood events (see padilla & williams 2004; rahel & olden 2008). this is particularly relevant to the north american sunﬁsh, pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus (l.), which is one of six non-native ﬁsh species expected to beneﬁt from changes induced by climate warming (britton et al. 2010). the most successful introduced to europe during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, pumpkinseed populations have become established in at least 28 countries of europe and asia minor, and the species is considered one of introduced ﬁshes in europe (copp & fox 2007). in the united kingdom, all known populations of pumpkinseed are located in england, south of the thames basin, with established populations currently observed in ponds but not in water courses (villeneuve et al. 2005). the colonisa- tion success of the pumpkinseed in its introduced range has been attributed to its ﬂexibility in habitat and diet requirements and plasticity of life-history traits (copp & fox 2007; garcía-berthou 2007; tomeček et al. 2007). its throughout most of southern distribution, pumpkinseed populations are characterised by fast juvenile growth and early age and size at maturity (copp & fox 2007). in these warmer regions of its non-indigenous distribution, the pumpkinseed is con- sidered invasive. in contrast, the pumpkinseed is not considered invasive in most of its northerly range, including england, where it has been established for over a century, the populations being characterised by slow growth, older age at maturity and longer life- span (copp et al. 2002; villeneuve et al. 2005). even in the more northerly countries, such as the nether- lands, where pumpkinseed invades ponds disturbed by rehabilitation management to favour native plants and is considered a pest species (van kleef et al. 2008), this pattern of slow growth and late maturity generally applies (cucherousset et al. 2009). recent studies, however, suggest that under climate change conditions, pumpkinseed populations in england could shift to invasive status as a result of increased recruitment and stronger competitive effects on native species (zięba et al. 2010; fobert et al. 2011). understanding how hydrological variability affects dispersal is critical for predicting the spread and man- agement of invasive species. the aim of this study is to: (i) determine the relationship between discharge regime and propagule pressure for the north ameri- can pumpkinseed in order to understand how increased hydrological variability, such as under con- ditions of climate change, could affect the species’ dispersal in england; (ii) examine a newly-established pumpkinseed population found in an artiﬁcial pond following a ﬂood event in 2007, providing a rare nat- ural opportunity to examine speciﬁc population level responses that facilitate the persistence of a species in a novel environment; and (iii) compare the growth and life-history traits of this new population with ﬁsh collected from the source population to demonstrate how the pumpkinseed’s life-history plasticity contrib- utes to its success as a coloniser. study area, material and methods the study was undertaken on two small tributaries (shefﬁeld stream, batts bridge stream; fig. 1) of the river ouse (sussex) catchment, which drains an area of about 664 km2; river length is 62 km of which the lower 21 km is tidal and discharges into the english channel east of brighton (50.782222n; 0.057222e). rising from springs to the west of nutley (51.028056n; 0.056389e), shefﬁeld stream ﬂows southward for about 7.5 km, passing through or adja- cent to seven connected ponds (1–2 ha in area) in its upper reaches that comprise the commercial angling 107 fobert et al. ﬁshery, tanyard fishery (51.021368n; 0.016122e); the ponds receive water upstream from shefﬁeld stream and discharge back into the stream down- stream through a drainage system that receives over- ﬂow from each pond via ‘vertical drain pipes’ that drain off excess water directly into shefﬁeld stream. a few kilometres downstream, shefﬁeld stream passes through a small reservoir at shefﬁeld mill before continuing southward towards its conﬂuence with the ouse. batts bridge stream rises from springs just east of nutley, draining rural countryside for 10.5 km as it ﬂows southward, passing ﬁrst through boringwheel lake, a commercial rainbow trout oncorhynchus_mykiss and brown_trout salmo_trutta ﬁshery (400-year- old, spring-fed former mill pond, 2.6 ha, depth min– max = 0.9–2.75 m, mixed marginal vegetation that includes non-native ornamental plants), discharging downstream via a gated weir and continuing a further several kilometres of countryside through a number of ‘on-line’ ﬁshing lakes before joining the ouse. both tributaries, which are second-order streams of variable width (1.0–4.3 m) and depth (0.05–1.5 m), receive escapee ﬁsh from connected water bodies, in particular the above-mentioned commercial ﬁsheries. fig. 1. location of study sites in river ouse (sussex) catchment, south-east england: (1) tanyard fishery; (2) shefﬁeld mill; (3) boringwheel lake; (4) cackle street; (5) watersmeet pond. 108 fish dispersal sampling tags between 12 may and 9 june 2004, 2467 pumpkinseed from boringwheel lake and three ponds at tanyards (all receive water from, and discharge back into, the adjacent streams) were tagged without anaesthetic (0.25 9 1.10 mm; using coded wire (cw) northwest marine technology inc., shaw island, wa, usa), as described by stakėnas et al. (2009). electroﬁshing surveys of the receiving streams (shef- ﬁeld, batts bridge) downstream of the above-named ﬁsheries were then undertaken in august 2004 (see copp et al. 2010), with all pumpkinseed captured scanned with a cw (metal) tag detector. all pumpkin- seed were killed according to uk ‘schedule 1’ meth- ods (stakėnas et al. 2009), the cw tags recovered during dissection in the laboratory and the origin pond was determined from the tag’s number sequence. in the absence of discharge gauging stations in the sussex ouse tributaries, stream discharge data were collected between 9 july 2008 and 17 march 2010 at ﬁve locations in two tributaries of the river ouse (sussex) catchment: adjacent to three outﬂow pipes from tanyard fishery on the upper reaches of shef- ﬁeld stream (51.021368n; 0.016122e); a fourth site located a few kilometres downstream on shefﬁeld stream at shefﬁeld mill (51.013403 n; 0.008648e); and the ﬁfth in batts bridge stream about 50 m downstream of boringwheel lake, where the stream is traversed (51.018548n; 0.074459e). by cackle street over the same period, sampling of escapee ﬁsh was undertaken using a sock-shaped pipe net (www. efe-uk.com), which was attached to the end of the outﬂow pipes to catch any ﬁsh escapees from the ponds. sampling dates were irregular, but included periods of both normal and elevated discharge (the latter emphasised to assess ﬁsh escape rates), with the duration of sampling varying as a function of the elevated discharge period; nets were checked fre- quently (depending on discharge intensity, but never exceeded 12 h) to avoid mortalities in the animal bycatch. to determine the rate of escape (ﬁsh per volume) via each outﬂow pipe, pipe discharge (ls  1) was determined at the beginning and end of each sampling period using a stopwatch to measure the time required to ﬁll a 1 l container. at shefﬁeld mill, ﬁsh sampling employed a drift net (1 m long) as described by copp et al. (2002), that is, 1-mm mesh, 0.26 9 0.52 m opening, square- to-conical shape leading to a 5-cm-diameter opening ﬁtted with a 1-l neoprene bottle (peňáz et al. 1992). the net was ﬁtted to a large metal frame set in the middle of the 6-m, square-shaped, concrete weir spill- over at the downstream end of shefﬁeld mill reser- voir. mean stream discharge was calculated from spate-related non-native ﬁsh dispersal and establishment triplicate measurements (valeport open channel ﬂow meter; braystoke model 001, totnes, devon, uk) taken immediately after setting the drift net and then again just prior to emptying the net at the end of the sampling period. water depth and stream width were measured with a ruler. at the batts bridge stream site, ﬁsh and stream velocity sampling were similar to those at shefﬁeld mill except that 6–8 measure- ments (including stream depth and width) were taken, depending on the water level, at the start and end of sampling intervals due to the diversiﬁed cross-stream proﬁle. captured ﬁshes were identiﬁed, counted and measured for total length (tl), with all native species retained in a bucket and then released into the stream once the drift net had been emptied. stream discharge data analysis this discharge measurement discharge data were acquired from the national river flow archive and are available for ouse at barcombe mills (50.914881n; 0.037124e) only. in 1994, station was described as a four-path ultrasonic gauge superseded (except for minimum discharges) complex structure (weirs and sluices) that is subject to drowning, with sluice operation further complicating the derivation of discharges. the gauge was moved upstream of abstraction intake in 1999, but high discharge mea- surement problems remained, with the river going out of bank during high discharges. data for the last 10 years of values were retained for extrapolating the tributary stream discharges. stream discharge was estimated for shefﬁeld stream from the water velocity, depth and channel width measurements collected from shefﬁeld mill weir using the method of buchanan & somers (1969), using the formula: q ¼ au where q is the discharge (m3s  1), a is the cross- sectional area of the portion of the channel occupied by the ﬂow (m2), and u is the mean water velocity (ms  1). the relationship between ﬁsh escapement rate (cal- culated as total number of ﬁsh) and stream discharge was modelled by a bayesian approach. this was pre- ferred over the classical (or frequentist) approach owing to the small data set available, so that the use of credible intervals (analogous to conﬁdence inter- vals in ‘frequentist’ statistics) was deemed a more informative option than setting signiﬁcance levels (hilborn & mangel 1997). a simple linear regression model was implemented in winbugs v1.4 (lunn et al. 2000). uninformative priors were used for all model parameters, including the two regression coefﬁcients and the precision (=inverse of the vari- ance), for which a normal and a gamma distribution were used, respectively (mccarthy 2007). predicted values for ﬁsh escapement rate were then computed based on back-calculated discharge values from the relationships between discharge in the river ouse and both the tanyard and cackle street sites during the july 2007 ﬂood (4 days in total: 20–21 july 2007 and 23–24 july 2007). parameters were estimated by sampling 100,000 times from the posterior distribu- tion by markov chain monte carlo methods, after discarding a ‘burn-in’ sample of 10,000 (mccarthy 2007). sampling of a newly established pumpkinseed population the littoral to assess the life-history traits of a newly-established population, which resulted from stream over-topping during a spate, pumpkinseed were collected on 8 june 2010 by repeated passes with a backpack elec- troﬁshing unit (bretschneider efgi 650, reichenbrn- der strasse 4, d-09224 chemnitz/gruna, germany) along of watersmeet pond (51.018548n; 0.074459e). this private garden pond (0.02 ha; depth = 0.5–3 m; various ornamental plants), which is situated = 5 m from batts bridge stream, contained no pumpkinseed prior to 2007 (s. stakėnas, f. villeneuve, unpublished data). a total of 91 pumpkinseed were captured and euthanised as per uk home ofﬁce licence and retained for later exami- nation. zone in the laboratory, each specimen was measured for tl (nearest mm), weighed (wet weight; nearest 0.1 g), and a sample of scales was taken from the posterior edge of the pectoral ﬁn for age determi- nation. gonads were removed, weighed and exam- ined to determine sex and maturity. females with ovaries containing nonyolked or indistinguishable eggs were classiﬁed as immature, and those with ovaries containing yolked eggs were classiﬁed as mature. age was determined as per steinmetz & müller (1991) using scale impressions on acetate strips, with annuli identiﬁed using criteria outlined by regier (1962). ages were cross-checked using independent readings by a second reader. back-calculations of tl at age were undertaken using the linear relationship between scale radius and tl (creaser 1926). mean age and tl at maturity were assessed on female pumpkinseed only, because male reproductive indices are less reliable indicators of responses to environmental variability (see danylchuk & fox 1994). mean age at maturity was calculated for females using the formula from demaster (1978) as adapted by fox (1994): 109 fobert et al. a ¼ xw x¼0 ðxþ½fðxþ   fðx   1þ where a is the mean age of maturity, x is the age in years, ƒ(x) is the proportion of ﬁsh mature at age x, and w is the maximum age in the sample. a modiﬁed version of this formula (10 mm tl intervals in place of age classes) was used to calculate mean tl at maturity as per fox & keast (1990). a fisher’s exact test was used to test for an association between the number of mature versus immature females in the pivotal age classes (i.e., the earliest age classes that achieved 50% maturity in a given year; fox & keast 1991) in the watersmeet and boringwheel popula- tions. a fisher’s exact test was preferred over a chi- square (v2) test because expected frequencies in some cases were below those permitted by v2 assumptions (sokal & rohlf 1981). the gonadosomatic index (gsi: 1009 ovary weight/total body weight) was calculated for mature females only, as gsi is not a good indicator of repro- ductive allocation in male pumpkinseed (see danyl- chuk & fox 1994). the gonad weights of individual ﬁsh in the two populations were compared with anal- ysis of covariance, with ovary weight as the response variable, population as the independent variable and tl as the covariate. mean tl at age was calculated for each age in both watersmeet and boringwheel populations. student’s t-tests were used to test for differences in mean tl at pivotal age classes (ages 2 and 3) between the two populations for all available cohorts. mean tl at age 2 was used as a measure of juvenile growth rate, as age 2 is the earliest recorded age at which female pumpkinseed mature in most native and introduced temperate zone populations (fox 1994; villeneuve et al. 2005). population pumpkinseed to assess the growth and life-history traits of the newly-established in watersmeet pond relative to its presumed source population, boringwheel trout fishery (fig. 1), pumpkinseed data from villeneuve et al. (2005), col- lected 3 june 2003, were used. the same calculations and procedures were carried out on both watersmeet and boringwheel populations. similarly, published data on 18 other english pumpkinseed populations from single-run depletion (reid et al. 2008) electro- ﬁshing and minnow trapping (villeneuve et al. 2005; cucherousset et al. 2009) were used for the compari- son of pumpkinseed life-history traits from the newly established watersmeet population to established populations in southern england. the data were also examined within a wider european context using the invasiveness model for pumpkinseed, based on juvenile growth and age at maturity (copp & fox 2007). 110 results stream discharge and pumpkinseed dispersal discharge data for the sussex ouse from 2001 to 2010 revealed great hydrological variability, with fre- quent ﬂood/spate events over the last decade (fig. 2). the 2007 ﬂood responsible for pumpkinseed coloni- sation of watersmeet pond was not an unusual event within this 10-year timeframe. during 2004 and dur- ing the 2008–2010 study period, when discharge data were collected from batts bridge stream at cackle street and from tanyard lakes, stream discharge var- iability was limited, more so for 2004 (fig. 2a) than for 2008–2010 (fig. 2b,c). during the 2004 tagging study, 309 more ﬁsh were recaptured in batts bridge stream below (i.e., had escaped from) boringwheel lake following a localised spate/ﬂood event than in shefﬁeld stream below tanyard ponds (fig. 3), despite pumpkinseed population density estimates for those two commer- cial ﬁsheries being similar (41.1 and 46.5 pumpkin- seed per 10 min of electroﬁshing, respectively). this potential relationship between number of pumpkin- seed (as a measure of ﬁsh escapement rate) and dis- charge, examined at tanyard fishery in 2008–2010, showed an increase in escapees with increasing dis- charge. based on this relationship, the predicted num- ber of pumpkinseed escaping from tanyard during the july 2007 ﬂood ranged from 0 to 7, and for each 0.01 m3 increase in discharge an additional 0–3 pumpkinseed would be expected to enter the stream through the standing pipes (table 1). note that equivalent outﬂow data were not available for bor- ingwheel lake due to access restrictions to that site. growth and life-history traits in 2010, the watersmeet population showed a very different growth trajectory than its source population in boringwheel lake (fig. 4). watersmeet pumpkin- seed showed relatively fast juvenile growth that slo- wed with age, whereas boringwheel pumpkinseed had much slower juvenile growth but a larger adult size. mean tls at ages 1 and 2 were signiﬁcantly greater for pumpkinseed in the new watersmeet pop- ulation compared with those in the source boring- t = 13.90; p < 0.001; d. wheel population (age 1: f. = 189, age 2: t = 3.61; p < 0.001; d.f. = 187). at age 3, there was no signiﬁcant difference in mean tl between watersmeet and boringwheel populations (66 and 68 mm, respectively). at age 4, pumpkinseed tl in boringwheel lake surpassed that of waters- meet pond, and boringwheel pumpkinseed reached a signiﬁcantly greater tl than their newly established counterparts (t =  5.18; p < 0.001; d.f. = 46). spate-related non-native ﬁsh dispersal and establishment (a) (b) (c) fig. 2. hydrological variability in the sussex ouse region between 2001 and 2010 (a). dashed box indicates the ﬂood in 2007 that resulted in pumpkinseed colonisation of watersmeet pond. black box indicates the 2008–2010 drift study period when stream discharge data were collected from batts bridge stream at cackle street (b) and from tanyard lakes (c). fig. 3. number of coded wire tagged pump- kinseed recaptured from batts bridge stream and stream ﬁsh communities, for every 100 m of stream following a ﬂood event in 2004. shefﬁeld a comparison of per cent females mature in each age and size class showed that the watersmeet pump- kinseed population matured at an earlier age and at a smaller size (fig. 5). the proportion of mature females at age 2 and age 3 in the watersmeet population was higher than the source population in 111 fobert et al. table 1. bayesian estimates for a simple, relationship between number of pumpkinseed (as a measure of ﬁsh escapement rate) and discharge at tanyard fishery. n1–4: predicted number of pumpkinseed (rounded values in brackets) during the 4-day july 2007 ﬂood (1 = 20/07/ 2007;

however, this difference was not statisti- cally signiﬁcant (fisher’s exact test: age 2, p = 0.23; age 3, p = 0.99). the mean age at maturity (2.4 years) for female pumpkinseed in the watersmeet population was 0.8 years earlier than that of its source population in boringwheel pond (3.2 years; table 2). mean age at maturity in watersmeet was also slightly earlier than the means (excluding watersmeet) for all previously studied pumpkinseed populations in the sussex ouse catchment and in england overall (table 2). relative to its source population, there were signiﬁ- cantly greater proportions of mature females in the watersmeet population in both the 60–69 mm test: p = 0.005) and 70–79 mm (fisher’s exact (fisher’s exact test: p = 0.005) size classes (fig. 5). the mean tl at maturity for the watersmeet popula- tion (67.5 mm) was smaller than that of pumpkinseed in boringwheel (78.9 mm) as well as the means for all sussex ouse populations and all english popula- tions (table 2). mean tl at age 2 in watersmeet pop- ulation was greater than that of the boringwheel population (60 and 53 mm, respectively). the mean gsi for watersmeet pumpkinseed (6.0) was also lower than that of the boringwheel population (8.4) length (tl) at age trajectory gener- fig. 4. pumpkinseed total ated from the von bertalanffy growth model calculated from the observed (solid) and projected (unﬁlled) mean tl at age. data points in the graph are mean values from the boringwheel (+), watersmeet (◆) and cackle street (●) pumpkinseed populations. 112 (a) (b) fig. 5. percentage of mature females by (a) age class and (b) size class in the watersmeet pond population (black) from 2010, the source population, boringwheel lake (grey), from 2003, and caught in the cackle street stretch of batts bridge stream, which connects the two bodies of water (white) from 2006. data for per cent mature by age class was not available for cackle street pumpkinseed in 2006. and the overall means for the sussex ouse and for english populations (table 2); however, the signiﬁ- cance of this difference could not be assessed because of the signiﬁcant difference between populations in the slope of the pumpkinseed ovary weight and tl relationship [ancova (population 9 tl): f1,61 = 13.2, p < 0.001]. to account for differences in size between the boringwheel (larger) and watersmeet (smaller) populations, the analysis was re-run using females of equivalent size ( 80 mm tl) only, which revealed watersmeet pumpkinseed to have signiﬁ- cantly higher gonad weight than those sampled from boringwheel (ancova: f2,27 = 13.2;

from †copp et al. 2002). latitude is 51°n in all cases except the powdermill sites and airport pond (50°n). the river mole sites are presented in upstream-to-downstream order (excluding milton mount pond, which is isolated). colautti & macisaac 2004). the results of the present study demonstrate how current and predicted hydro- logical variability can contribute to the propagule pressure of the non-native pumpkinseed in the uk, leading to the establishment of new populations in ﬂoodplain water bodies that connect to the water courses during ﬂood/spate events. a spate in 2004, which was localised to shefﬁeld and batts bridge streams and therefore does not appear in the overall sussex ouse discharge regime (fig. 2a), resulted in a large number of pumpkinseed escaping into batts bridge stream (fig. 3). the mas- sive difference in the numbers escaping from boring- wheel lake and tanyard fishery during 2004 can be attributed to the different outﬂow systems used, a simple spillover weir and a vertical pipe overﬂow system, respectively. this highlights how a relatively simple management mitigation measure (britton et al. 2011), that is, modiﬁcation of an outﬂow system, can reduce the number of escapees (i.e., propagule pres- sure) into river systems (e.g., copp et al. 2006; gozlan et al. 2010), and this is particularly important for on-line ﬁsheries (hickley & chare 2004). the ﬂood event in 2007, which the landowner reported had inundated the watersmeet study site, resulted in escapee pumpkinseed from an upstream water body colonising a downstream water body that is not normally connected to the adjacent water course. when examined in the context of a 10-year period, it becomes evident that the 2007 ﬂood was not particularly unusual, as more extreme ﬂoods and vari- able discharge regimes were frequently recorded in the sussex ouse region. under the predicted scenarios for future climatic conditions, precipitation patterns and discharge regimes are expected to be altered and the magnitude, frequency, duration and timing of 113 fobert et al. ﬂoods, droughts and intermittent ﬂows will fundamen- tally impact aquatic ecosystems (rahel & olden 2008). the predicted changes to discharge regimes in england are expected to beneﬁt pumpkinseed by increasing rates of dispersal and pathways of invasion. the study period was less than ideal for examining this phenomenon due to the relatively invariable stream discharges in the study area. however, the cw tagging results and subsequent bayesian model- ling both indicate that pumpkinseed ‘escapement’ rate (from enclosed waterbodies neighbouring streams during ﬂood events) increases with increasing stream discharge. into although we were not able to predict conﬁdently how many ﬁsh will escape, many more ﬁsh are likely to escape under elevated discharge even where there is a mitigating mechanism (e.g., standing pipe sys- tem), and such ﬂood pulses would increase the likeli- hood of new populations being established (e.g., watersmeet) in downstream ﬂoodplain water bodies. evaluation of the watersmeet pumpkinseed popu- lation reveals life-history traits characteristic of a newly-established population, as predicted by inva- sion theory (copp & fox 2007). relative to its source population (boringwheel lake), pumpkinseed found in watersmeet pond exhibited fast juvenile growth, early age at maturity and small size at matu- rity. these opportunistic traits (sensu winemiller & rose 1992) are typically adopted by recently intro- duced ﬁshes as a strategy to establish self-sustaining populations in novel environments, where intraspe- ciﬁc competition is often absent and interspeciﬁc competition is often minimal due to the absence of indigenous competitors (stearns 1976; copp & fox 2007; fox et al. 2007). despite a time gap between the collection of samples from the boringwheel and watersmeet populations, mean monthly temperatures were not signiﬁcantly different (uk meteorological ofﬁce 2012) during the lifetime of ﬁsh from boring- (2007–2010), wheel indicating that the differences in life-history traits would not be attributable to differences in climatic conditions. (2000–2003) and watersmeet the watersmeet pumpkinseed population had a lower mean gsi than would be predicted for an expanding population. however, restricting the analy- sis to equivalent (smaller) size better illustrates the difference in reproductive allocation between the watersmeet pumpkinseed, which were generally smaller in size and matured earlier, than the boring- wheel pumpkinseed. there are, however, concerns with using gsi as a measure of reproductive invest- ment due to the underlying assumption that the num- ber of spawning events is equal in both populations, and this apparent difference in energy allocation to gonadal development should be tested with gsi data 114 throughout the spawning period before being consid- ered deﬁnitive (see danylchuk & fox 1994). the relationship between juvenile growth and age at maturity has been suggested (copp & fox 2007) as a useful means for assessing the potential invasive- ness of pumpkinseed populations in england and europe and that the populations with the highest potential for expansion are those with short genera- tion times, fast juvenile growth and high fecundity at an early age. the mean tl at age 2 for watersmeet and boringwheel populations, when plotted against means of all available noninvasive and invasive pumpkinseed populations (villeneuve et al. 2005; cucherousset et al. 2009), reveals that the waters- meet and boringwheel populations both fall within the noninvasive region of the graph. however, rela- tive to its source population, the new watersmeet pumpkinseed population is much closer to the ‘physi- ological transition phase’ of invasive populations, which are characterised by faster juvenile growth and younger mean age at maturity (fig. 6). previous studies have shown that phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits has contributed to the success of the pumpkinseed as an invader in europe and that its invasion success is greatest in warmer fig. 6. mean age at maturity (in years) as a function of mean juvenile growth [total length (tl)] at age 2) for the newly estab- lished watersmeet populations (thick open circle), the source bor- ingwheel population (thick open square), and english (solid dots) and continental european (thin open squares) pumpkinseed popu- lations. the proposed physiological transition phase between non- invasive and invasive pumpkinseed populations is hypothesised as extending from the minimum age at maturity (the 45º line that traces from the intercept) and the end of juvenile growth (which for many pumpkinseed populations is age 2; the 45º line that traces through the age 2 intercept with the regression slope). adapted from the original (copp & fox 2007) and a subsequent version (cucherousset et al. 2009). spate-related non-native ﬁsh dispersal and establishment environments (fox et al. 2007). this suggests that in warmer waters in england brought on by climate change, pumpkinseed ‘escapees’ will have an in- creased ability to survive and establish new popula- tions. in addition, studies have shown that in warmer water conditions, pumpkinseed will spawn earlier (zięba et al. 2010) and will have an increased competitive advantage when competing with native ﬁsh for food resources (fobert et al. 2011); thus, cli- mate change is predicted to have a positive impact on pumpkinseed survival, recruitment and propagule pressure in england. in conclusion, although pumpkinseed are not cur- rently considered invasive in the united kingdom, the pumpkinseed’s status in the united kingdom is likely to shift to invasive under predicted future con- ditions (op. cit.). with increased survival and recruit- ment under conditions of a warmer climate, and life- history traits that enable colonisation and establish- ment in novel environments, the pumpkinseed will be able to exploit the increased hydrological variability and the extensive connectivity of canals and water course in southern england to expand its introduced range. management strategies will be required to mit- igate the impacts of pumpkinseed on the native spe- cies and ecosystems and should include control and containment initiatives to enhance outﬂow systems to control ﬁsh escapement (britton et al. 2010). acknowledgements conceived within the framework of an international network initiated with a nato science
