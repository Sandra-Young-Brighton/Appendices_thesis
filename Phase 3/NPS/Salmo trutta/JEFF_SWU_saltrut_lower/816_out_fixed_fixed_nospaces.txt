(2012) point out that there is still a considerable lack of evidence for the positive effects of measures to promote wild- like fish on postrelease fitness in the wild. in this study, we compare survival and growth of brown_trout offspring (parr) of two different genetic backgrounds, raised in iden- tical environmental conditions. we test for differences between local origin fish and domesticated hatchery fish with additional comparison to resident wild brown_trout. 2 |  material and methods 2.1 | study area the study area is located in the headwaters of the piesting; a danube tributary draining from the very eastern part of the austrian northern limestone alps (figure 1). two small tributaries and a main stem stretch of the upper piesting river were selected for the experi- ment (see table 1 for site descriptions). all experimental streams are populated by wild brown_trout. additional species occurring in the study area include bullhead (cottus gobio) and occasionally rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss). the streams primarily offer habitat for juvenile and subadult age classes of trout. eidechselbach (eb) is a 1.8 km long, spring fed headwater tributary, offering high structural diversity. the study site is located in the lower reaches, which wind through a grassland dominated terrain with alternating pool and rif- fle sections. the remaining upstream section of the stream offers limited habitat for brown_trout. in addition to abundant shelter in the study site, yoy brown_trout in eb benefit from stable discharge and temperature regimes (figure 2). the study area of the 4.4 km long weissenbach (wb) is of similar size and discharge, but with lower quality habitat. the higher slope and narrow valley results in a straightened river channel of less structural heterogeneity, higher water flow velocity and higher rate of sediment turnover. the stream is predominately fed by hillside run- off and thus exhibits higher water temperature extremes than found in eb (figure 2). the habitat is characterised by riffle or run sections and a low percentage of pool habitats. shelter for brown_trout can be found in the form of undercut banks, woody debris and riparian vegetation but is overall less abun- dant than in eb. the study site in wb is located in the middle to lower section of the stream. the third study site is located a few kilometres downstream of the source of the piesting river itself, referred to as kalter gang (kg). with a mean discharge of roughly 200 l s−1, kg is the largest of the three investigated streams (table 1). the headwa- ter section of kalter gang has a length of about 4.8 km, before the character of the stream changes. in contrast to the other two exper- imental streams, kg also has higher bed- load transport, a higher rate of sediment turnover and coarser substrate. brown_trout habitat is figure 1 location of the experimental streams (eb, wb, kg) in the headwaters of the piesting catchment. a fourth stream, the upper ybbs river served as the source of the wild strain (wti) 148  |     ﻿pinter tn  al table 1 key characteristics of the experimental streams and the river

water temperatures over the investigation period (figure 2). 2.2 | stocking material two strains of parr originating from contrasting genetic backgrounds were produced under identical hatchery conditions. the first strain derived from a wild brown_trout population of the upper ybbs basin (figure 1), a danube tributary of similar geochemical character as the experimental streams (see table 1 and unfer, hauer, & lautsch, 2011 for details). although historically managed with stocking, since 1997 the population relies solely on natural reproduction. this population is thus referred to as a wild, self- sustaining brown_trout strain, which was introduced to the investigation area (wti—wild trout, introduced). in december 2006, one hundred fertile fish of both sexes were caught in the ybbs using a backpack electrofishing unit. captured fish were brought to a nearby hatchery for stripping and fertilisation of eggs. a total of 6,000 eggs were kept in upwelling incubators until the alevins started to hatch. during the eyed egg stage, all embryos were submersed and marked in a solution of 500 mg l−1 alizarin red s (ars) for a period of 24 hr, following the marking procedure of unfer and pinter (2012). the second strain derived from a domesticated hatchery strain, which was founded about 30 years ago (dti—domesticated trout, introduced). the founder population could be genetically as- signed to the so- called atlantic lineage, based on mitochondrial dna (lerceteau- köhler, schliewen, kopun, & weiss, 2013; weiss, schlötterer, waidbacher, & jungwirth, 2001). individual fish from dti could be genetically distinguished from wti and the resident wild fish using the panel of 12 microsatellites first optimised in lerceteau- köhler and weiss (2006) and applied in lerceteau- köhler et al. (2013). the water chemistry in the hatchery is calcareous, similar to the ex- perimental streams. about 6,000 fertilised brown_trout eggs of dti were brought to the same hatchery as wti. dti were not marked with ars, and the rearing conditions, however, were identical for both dti and wti; fish were raised in round tanks and fed conventional parti- cle food for a period of 2 months. resident brown_trout (wtr—wild trout, resident) found in each experimental stream comprise a distinct third strain in our experimental set- up. at the beginning of may 2007, the resident populations were assessed using a serial removal method (seber & le cren, 1967). each experimental stream was sampled with two consecutive upstream passes with a backpack electrofishing unit over a length of 100 m in the middle section of the experimental inves- tigation area. the upper end of the sampled stretch was blocked off to prevent fish from escaping. 2.3 | experimental set- up each experimental stream was subdivided into a succession of five treatment (i.e. stocked) sites interspersed with equally long nonstocked sites. in eb and wb, each of the sites were 100 m in length, resulting in a total investigated length of 900 m per stream; in kg, each stretch measured 75 m resulting in 675 m total length. ﻿pinter tn  al s m a e r t s l a t n e m  i r e p x e e e r h t f o h c a e n  i i n a r t

prior to stocking, 200 individuals of each reared test strain were sampled and analysed for differences in size and visually recognisable physiological deficits. on 15th of may 2007, fish of both experimental strains were stocked in the experimental streams. in relation to aver- age natural yoy densities of 1 ind. m2 (pinter, k.; unpublished data), stocking density was chosen to be high at 3.3 ind. m2. the same fre- quency of fish from both strains was counted and dispersed as evenly as possible, but choosing low velocity habitats adequate for parr along the treatment sites (table 2). in the upper most stocking section of weissenbach (wb1), the stocking quota could not be reached, and thus, a reduced frequency of fish was stocked. experimental results were based on three control samplings of the stocked sections using a backpack electrofishing unit. each section was sampled in upstream direction. these samplings were carried out on 30th of august 2007 (first sample), 13th of march 2008 (second sam- ple) and 16 of september 2008 (third sample). for statistical balance, we tried to use an equal effort of removing yoy through a single elec- trofishing pass of each section. cross- tabulation analyses were based on the sum of all five sections per stream. total length and weight were taken for each captured fish prior to bringing them back to the lab- oratory for strain assignment. strain assignment was carried out with a two- step process. first, sagittae otoliths of all yoy were dissected, cleaned and stored. alizarin marks were detected using a fluorescence stereomicroscope (leica mz fliii with digital camera leica dc500) equipped with a dsred filter (for details see unfer & pinter, 2012). fish showing an ars mark could be assigned to wti; the remaining fish were genotyped and subjected to structure analysis together with refer- ence genotypes from wild resident fish (wtr) as well as dti. individual fish were assigned to one of these two strains based on their highest q- values, whereby most values were >.90 for the assigned target. during the last sampling in september 2008, the nonstocked (in- termediate) sections were also sampled to increase the overall sample size of both resident and stocked parr in all three experimental streams. 2.4 | statistical analysis all statistical tests related to recaptures are based on cross- tabulation of frequencies (table 3). a nonparametric median test was used for statistical analysis of the ratio of recaptures and stocked fish (recap- ture ratio) of the tested strains across all streams. pairwise compari- sons were used to identify significant differences within and between the streams. tests for uniform distribution were performed with a χ2 statistic on the sum of all fish per strain and the resident trout for the first date in eb, the second and third dates in each stream and on the sum of the nonstocked sections (table 4). if the uniform distribution was rejected, the deviations were further evaluated using the residual test (test statistic z = (observed − expected)/√expected). to simplify the interpretation, the test statistic z was transferred to an error prob- ability p and setting α to .05. in a second step, we tested whether the capture frequencies be- tween tested strains were independent of the date. a pearson–mantel– haenszel χ2 test was used to evaluate overall independency, and residual tests were used for cell- wise evaluation. in total, three tests were 150  |     ﻿pinter tn  al table 3 frequency of 0+ brown_trout in august 2007 and

cross table 3: [wtr dti] versus [2nd date 3rd date]. due to low frequencies of fish, α was set .1. statistically significant heterogeneities of strains between the test sections were quantified by odds and odds ratios. for a stan- dardised evaluation, the results are rewritten as follows: odds to q′ and odds ratio to q″ (−1 ≥ q′ and q″ ≤ +1). if q′ (q″) = 0, both strains are equally distributed; if q′ (q″) = −1 or q′ (q″) = +1, total dominance is given. sachs (1992) recommends barriers for statistical relevance: q′ (q″) = −0.2 and q′ (q″) = +0.2. the analysis was performed for all five test sections, the total of all sections and for each stream. 2.5 | growth and condition the nonparametric median test was used to evaluate length and con- dition factor (k = 100 w l−3), used as proxies for differential growth. to analyse interaction effects, a profile variable of the factors experi- mental stream (es) and trout strain (ts) was constructed by chaining the categories of both factors (table 5) using the formula presented in lautsch and thöle (2003). the nonparametric median test was first used to test for global heterogeneity among all profiles. cramérs v is used to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity. the residual test was applied to test for heterogeneity across profiles within sampling dates. table 4 frequency of 1+ brown_trout removed from the untreated

observed in eb (table 1). yoy could not be quantified in may, presum- ably due to the limited catch efficiency of early parr stages (figure 3). the catch in eb was roughly 20% yoy (25–45 mm, ̄x = 34 mm) indicat- ing successful reproduction for 2007 in eb. the remaining stock was primarily made up of 1+ and 2+ life stages, with adults representing <15% of total abundance. the lowest fish density was recorded in wb (table 1), amounting to only a third of the stock estimated in eb. the age distribution of wb (figure 3) showed only a few subadult or juvenile specimens. yoy could not be documented. the length–frequency diagram of the kg population revealed the presence of fish of all age classes (figure 3). yoy could only be documented in very low frequencies. 3.2 | stocking material at stocking, fish from wti & dti were slightly larger (≈23%) on aver- age than resident yoy recorded in eb. wti fish ranged between 34 and 48 mm ( ̄x = 42 mm), and dti fish ranged between 36 and 47 mm     |  151 ( ̄x = 41 mm). differences in the length between wti and dti were statistically significant (χ2= 17.7; df = 7; p = .013), but were limited to over- represented fish of wti in the length classes of 34 to 37 mm, as shown using a residual test. both strains revealed equal distributions for the remaining size classes. 3.3 | recaptures results based on differentiating wtr and dti in wb and kg were limited to the second and third sampling dates because tissue sam- ples from the first sampling date were degraded, inhibiting genetic analysis. total recaptures for wti were higher than for dti in every stream across all dates (table 3, figure 4). however, the only statisti- cally significant difference between recapture ratios within a stream was found for the last sampling in wb (p = .023). stream- specific developments are signalised by the median tests of both dates (p = .016 second date and p = .001 third date). significant pairwise comparisons, however, were limited to the second date: dti of eb vs. wti of kg, p = .023; and at the third date to: wti in kg vs. dti in wb, p = .023 and wti in wb vs. dti in eb, p = .023), underscoring a lack of major differences among the three streams. site- specific de- velopments become more evident using odd ratios and in considera- tion of resident trout. in eb and wb, recaptures of the resident trout were higher than for both stocked strains between the second and third dates (q″ < −0.2; table 6). in kg, no such development could be documented during the two dates. higher recaptures for wti in wb became evident (q″ = −0.2) signifying that the proportion of the two tested strains changed in favour of wti. more detailed analysis of yoy of the resident trout in individual streams is presented below. 3.4 | eidechselbach results of eb partly consider the first sampling date but focus on the developments between the second and third samplings. at the first date, a total of 292 0+ trout was removed, from which 171 could be allocated to the three strains (table 3). due to dna degradation, the remaining fish of this sample could not be genetically analysed. almost half (42%) of all captured yoy were assigned to wti (n = 122). figure 3 length (mm)–frequency plots of the resident brown_trout populations (wtr) in the three experimental streams prior to stocking 152  |     ﻿pinter tn  al figure 4 recapture rates of

identify 27 wtr and 22 dti. thus, wti were significantly over- represented (p = .006) and dti sig- nificantly under- represented (p = .015) at this time (table 7). at the second sampling in march, wtr were significantly over- represented (n = 97) and dti were significantly under- represented (n = 27; table 7), but the residual test for this comparison was nonsignificant. at the third sampling in september 2008, the resident 1+ fish were again the most frequent and statistically over- represented (n = 83), and both tested strains (wti and dti) were statistically under- represented (n = 23 and n = 13). summarising the catch data for all nonstocked stretches (table 4) also showed that resident trout (n = 74) were dominating (p < .001), but only dti (n = 7) were significantly under- represented (p < .001). despite some missing assignment data for the first sampling, wti were shown to have significantly higher survival compared with the dti between stocking and the first date (p < .001), but no difference occurred between the first and the second dates (table 7). pairwise tests further revealed differences between the resident fish compared with wti, as the presence of the latter decreased significantly com- pared with wtr between the first and the second and the second and third sampling dates (table 7). with regard to wtr and dti, no signif- icant decrease could be observed during the first and the last dates, which indicates a high postrelease mortality of dti. comparing the two stocked strains, odds revealed a slight dom- inance of wti at both the second and third sampling dates (q′ = 0.3; table 6). nonetheless, this trend was not homogenous across all stream sections, as the dominance of wti increased over time (q″ = −0.4) in section one, but decreased in section five (q″ = 0.4), while the other three sections showed no statistically significant change. the resident trout showed overall dominance compared with both wti and dti, whereby significant variation across individual sec- tions was also noted. table 6 q odds: ratio between recaptures of two strains of one date. qodds ratio: ratio of qodds between two dates. all ratios are expressed in q

therefore, wti represent half the sample. the remaining fish of this sample could not be genetically analysed. in march 2008 (second date), a total of 104 brown_trout was caught in the test sections of wb. as section one could not be stocked at the same density as the remaining sections, only the sections 2 to 5 are considered in the further analysis of the recaptures. consequently, a total of 86 fish were captured (wtr = 28; wti = 36; dti = 22) with no statistically significant difference among strains (table 7). six months later (third date), a significant deviation from the uniform distribution was docu- mented as dti were significantly under- represented and wtr were significantly over- represented (table 7). in the nonstocked sections (table 4), both tested strains were equally under- represented at the third date (p = .009), while wtr were over- represented (p < .001). likewise in eb significant differences were observed in the fre- quency distributions of the second and third dates of wb (table 7). pairwise analysis identified significant effects between wtr and the tested strains as the latter ones decreased over time (tables 3 and 7). with regard to wtr and dti, a clear focus is on the statistically signif- icant decrease in dti from n = 22 to n = 7 (table 3). based on the odds and or, the development along the test sections was very heterogeneous (table 6). for wtr and wti, the overall decline of wti was expressed by q″ = −0.4. within the single     |  153 sections, however, q″ varied between 0.3 and −0.8. a similar result was obtained for wti and dti. the overall decrease in dti was smaller than compared with wtr and wti (q″ = −0.2) but it also varied be- tween q″ = 0.1 and q″ = −0.8. only the contrast of wtr and dti de- scribes a homogenous development as all test sections showed a high loss of dti fish (total q″ = −0.5). 3.6 | kalter gang one half of the sample of the first date in kalter gang consisted of wti (n = 144). the remaining 152 0+ trout could not be categorised due to degraded dna. the sample of the second date consisted of 194 brown_trout and was dominated by the resident trout (n = 76) closely followed by wti (n = 70). with 48 individuals, dti was significantly under- represented (table 7). the sample of the third date consisted of 140 trout. the resident trout (n = 55) and wti (n = 54) dominated this sample, while dti was again significantly under- represented (table 7). consequently, the hypothesis of uniform distribution was rejected at both dates. this was also true for the nonstocked sections of the third date, where wtr were significantly over- represented (p < .001) and dti under- represented (p < .001). neither the ors nor the contingency table analysis reveal signif- icant developments (table 6, table 7), suggesting that the decline of dti began at an earlier point in time, as shown in eb. also sim- ilar to the other experimental streams, the development within the table 7 frequency

tn  al test sections was very heterogeneous (e.g. wtr/wti varied between q″ = 0.7 and q″ = −0.4). according to the median tests, the profile contrasts identify the most obvious divergences between kg and eb (data not shown). 3.7 | growth characteristics size distribution differences were most clearly observed between the three streams (figure 5). at the first sampling date, the majority of brown_trout of all strains in eb were statistically smaller than the global median (table 8). stream- specific growth rates became more pronounced with time and independent of strain. fish larger than the global median were significantly over- represented in kg, whereas fish smaller than the median were over- represented in eb. the differences between the strains within each stream were negligible, further sup- ported by individual pairwise post hoc tests between profiles (data not shown). only once, at the second sampling date, was there a sta- tistically significant difference between two strains within one stream (wtr vs. dti, in kg), with dti being significantly larger than wtr. this heterogeneity, however, disappears at the third sampling date. similar to length analysis, there were significant differences in condition factor between profiles at each date (table 8). the post hoc median test, however, does not reveal any strain- or stream- specific patterns of increased or decreased condition, with the exception of a few profiles (table 8). based on pairwise comparisons, the only signifi- cant differences among strains within a single stream were shown for kg, where the condition of dti was higher than for wti at both dates (p < .001) and higher than for wtr at the second date (p = .002). at the third date, the condition of wtr was significantly higher than for wti (p < .001). 4 |  discussion in this study, we tested for competitive differences in terms of differ- ential survival and growth between three- month- old stocked brown figure 5 brown_trout length at

shown that wild origin stocked fish were superior to farm origin stocked trout, as a higher share of the recaptures were of wild origin at all dates and every stream and farm origin fish were significantly under- represented. the dominance of wild origin stocked fish, how- ever, diminishes over time, as fish of the resident wild cohort prevail in two of the three investigated streams. persisting significant differ- ences in growth could not be found between the two tested strains or between the stocked strains and the resident trout. the main dif- ferences in growth were seen between streams and thus assumed to be purely of an environmental origin, namely differing temperatures. the first period after release was the most decisive in terms of sur- vival and strain- specific failure rates. an initial superiority of wild ori- gin fish (wti) could explicitly be shown in eb at the first control date after stocking. comparably high shares of wti recaptured at the first date in the other two streams were also noted. under- representation of dti documented at later dates, along with the demonstrably syn- chronous developments of the stocked strains during the second half of the investigation, further outlines the early competitive advantage of stocked wild origin fish. the competitive disadvantage of dti is manifested by the end of the study as this strain is significantly under- represented in the distributions of the whole study area. considering the very high stocking densities, the results further indicate that density- dependent mortality after the release was a driving factor at the beginning of the investigation (cf. berg & jørgensen, 1991). genetic origin and domestication history are known to be of great importance when it comes to the fitness of cultured individuals in the wild. the comparably poor performance of dti may be attributed to both the nonlocal origin of the broodstock (araki et al., 2008; mcginnity et al., 2003; reisenbichler, 1988 reviewed in lorenzen et al., 2012) and its long hatchery history. rearing over multiple gener- ations is thought to negatively affect the ability of individual fish to find and establish a suitable territory (cf. metcalfe et al., 2003). increased and inappropriate use of aggression (weber & fausch, 2003), as a consequence of selective domestication (fleming, agustsson, finstad, johnsson, & björnsson, 2002), or as a cause of high density rearing (metcalfe et al., 2003; sundström et al., 2003), is also known to have significant impacts on the performance of stocked fish. the fact that wild origin fish (wti) could not maintain their initially documented predominance in any of the stocked streams implies that resident trout are competitively superior. this result was supported throughout each stream and seems to be independent of the initial documented density of wtr. low recorded numbers of resident yoy in may 2007 in wb and kg may be the result of later emergence in these streams. subsequent research on theses streams (unpublished data) has recorded emergence until the end of may. in summary, stream- specific effects were observed across the ex- periment, supporting some the effects of environment. for example, eb was the only stream where both test strains were significantly under- represented in the stocked sections. the nonstocked sections were also dominated by resident fish (table 4) and wti was neither over- nor under- represented, implying substantial dispersal of stocked fish into     |  155 the nonstocked sections. in wb, resident trout dominated the stocked and especially the nonstocked areas by the end of the study, but the dominance of wti lasted longer than in eb (table 3). in the test sections of kg, fish of resident origin and wild origin fish maintained equal stocks until the last date, and the distribution in the nonstocked stretches re- sembled that of eb. the observed declines of the test strains in the stocked sections may, to a certain extent, result from the monitoring removals and subsequent recolonisation by resident trout from adjacent areas, but this does not seem to have played a large role as in kg, wti and wtr showed similar densities at the end of the study. the temporally differing effects may be caused by prior- resident effects (deverill, adams, & bean, 1999) of wtr compared with the introduced conspecifics, which would especially explain the poor per- formance of the tested strains in eb. additionally, further influence can result from varying habitat suitability for 0+ and 1+ trout in the investigated streams (riedl & unfer, 2010); especially in the streams with possibly little intraspecific competition by fish of the same cohort (wb and kg), the habitat conditions (higher slope and little suitable habitat) may have influenced the performances of the stocked strains. in fact, site- specific factors are known to affect the survival of stocked trout (almodóvar, nicola, elvira, & garcía- marín, 2006; madeira, gómez- moliner, & barbe, 2005), with less variable conditions being beneficial for stocked fish (martinez, arias, castro, & sanchez, 1993). in this context, the high diversity of effects between the single test stretches could, to some extent, be attributed to the varying habitat conditions. in 15 of 28 stream sections where comparisons of wtr and the test strains could be made, a development in favour of the res- ident trout was observed. in some cases (n = 9), there were no changes with time; for example, if wtr was already dominating a stretch at the second sample date it maintained its dominance. in the remaining four sections, an increase of fish from either wti (n = 3) or dti (n = 1) was documented. in general, further, more detailed habitat analysis would be necessary to precisely determine the role of habitat features. comparing the development of the tested strains, it turns out that wild origin fish (wti) increased in 5 of 13 sections; hatchery origin fish (dti) increased in four stretches, and no change was observed in four stretches. in detail, however, the fact that the ratio of dti increased in three of five sections in kg stands out, when compared with the other streams. also the comparison with the resident trout shows a distinct development with comparably weak achievements of wtr and even one section in favour of dti. those results may be seen in context of distinct growth and condition rates of dti in kalter gang. data on growth and condition showed very consistent results with no or almost no significant differences attributed to the strains. what can be seen in eb is that the initially documented size advantage of the stocked strains diminished throughout the first month after stocking. the results of kg, however, are notable, as fish of the hatchery strain had a better condition in almost all comparisons of the second and third dates. the fish are also the biggest in size although a statistical difference could only be demonstrated once during the second date. it appears that a potential genetic component for fast growth (fleming et al., 2002; weber & fausch, 2003) may be present in kg, resulting from site- specific conditions. 156  |     the comparison of growth between the three streams, indepen- dent of strain, reveals well- recognisable trends. brown_trout grew best in kalter gang, followed by weissenbach and eidechselbach, where those trends become apparent three and a half months after stock- ing. the differences are best shown by the pairwise comparisons of fish from the same strain but of different streams where significant differences were found in 14 of 17 comparisons. the condition fac- tor, in comparison, does not vary greatly. aside from site- specific and density- dependent effects (vøllestad, olsen, & forseth, 2002), water temperature and food availability (elliott & hurley, 1999; elliott, hurley, & fryer, 1995) are known to be the driving factors for growth. in our study, the observed fish sizes show a strong relation to temperature between may and september 2007: the highest temperatures were recorded in kg, followed by wb and eb (figure 2). further factors pro- moting growth in kg may be reduced energy needs due to the lower slope than in wb and better habitat conditions. the lowest slope and best habitat conditions, however, can be found at eb (riedl & unfer, 2010) but the cold temperature regime of the spring fed stream pre- sumably hampered growth (edwards, densem, & russell, 1979). 5 |  summary we tested the ability of three- month- old brown_trout of wild and hatchery origin to establish themselves in three headwater streams. we found clear support that nonlocal trout with a long domestication history were considerably inferior in terms of survival than wild origin fish of local origin. however, resident fish proved to outcompete both experimental strains. by projecting loss rates, we predict that few to no stocked trout will reach maturity and contribute to the mainte- nance of the stock. despite very high stocking densities, introduced trout diminished over time, illustrating the failure of stocked brown_trout parr in supporting natural stocks. the data suggest that the first period after stocking was the most decisive in terms of habitat oc- cupation and survival. throughout the second half of the study, no pronounced changes in the distribution of the three observed strains could be perceived. next to intraspecific competition, site- specific en- vironmental effects might have influenced survival and growth of the stocked fish, indicating the need for more research on environmental effects. acknowledgements this project was funded by the austrian federal ministry of agriculture, forestry,
