(2008) demonstrated that immersing juvenile golden perch, macquaria ambigua (richard- son), in solutions of enriched stable isotopes of ba and sr for as few as 8 days resulted in a shift in the otolith isotope ratio, which could then be used to identify batches of ﬁsh. among the beneﬁts of this type of enriched stable isotope marking is that it requires no individual handling of ﬁsh and only very low concentrations of each isotope, thus making it a low cost marking method with negligible stress to the ﬁsh. however, a disadvantage of the technique described by munro et al. (2008) is that standard hatchery protocols for the production of many species, including golden perch, do not include a hatchery holding period of 8 days or more in a static system at the juvenile (ﬁngerling) stage. for instance, after harvesting from earthen grow-out ponds, golden perch ﬁngerlings are usually held in hatchery tanks for <2 days prior to being transported for stocking (s. thurstan, pers. comm.). because isotope marking of golden perch at the ﬁngerling stage would require major alterations to existing hatchery protocols, it is unlikely to be adopted routinely for such species. an alternative approach is to mark hatchery ﬁsh at the larval stage; a period during which it is often routine, or at least feasible, to hold ﬁsh at very high densities in static water in which concentrations of enriched stable isotopes can be readily controlled. to our knowledge, mass marking of larvae via immersion in enriched stable isotopes has not been previously attempted. there has also been very limited work on the range of isotopes that can be used to mark otoliths. to date, 137ba has been the most widely investigated isotope of barium and has been used to mark otoliths of different species of ﬁsh using various methods (thorrold et al. 2006; walther & thorrold 2006; munro et al. 2008, 2009). barium has seven isotopes (rosman & taylor 1998) that could potentially be used to provide unique batch marks. no previous work has investigated using stable isotopes of magnesium (mg) as a marker, although like ba, it is thought to substitute for ca, in the otolith matrix (campana 1999). mg has three stable isotopes that exist in measurable natural quan- tities (rosman & taylor 1998; maguire & cowan 2002). a relationship exists between otoliths and water for ba isotopes (munro et al. 2008) where the ratios recorded in the otoliths reﬂect that of the water. relationships between the environment and uptake of mg isotopes into the otolith have not been previously investigated (campana 1999; martin & thorrold 2005). several researchers suggest that mg might be physiologically regulated by ﬁsh (shearer & asgard 1992; martin & thorrold 2005; dorval et al. 2007), 158 and it is therefore unclear if shifts in the mg isotope ratios in the water will be reﬂected in the otoliths. the primary objective of this study was to expand on the methods described by munro et al. (2008) to evaluate practical techniques for mass marking golden perch otoliths via immersion in solutions of enriched stable isotopes at the larval stage, that limit disruption to standard hatchery protocols. first, we determine the concentrations and lengths of exposure required to produce unambiguous marks and investigate a range of stable isotope combinations to produce distinctive marks. second, we examine relationships between otolith isotopic signatures and ambient water chemis- try to explore the mechanisms that inﬂuence uptake of isotopes. finally, we examine whether there are any effects of the marking procedure on mortality and growth rates. methods study species golden perch is native to waterways of inland australia and is a popular angling species that grows to >5 kg. it is the most widely stocked native species within the murray-darling basin (mdb), with stocked ﬁsh usually released as ﬁngerlings of 30–40 mm total length (tl). during culturing, golden perch larvae are held in tanks in the hatchery for the ﬁrst 4–6 days after hatching, while they feed endogenously on the yolk. once the larvae begin exogenous feeding, they are transferred to grow-out ponds for 3–4 months. the ﬁngerlings are then harvested and held in the hatchery for approximately 24 h in ﬂow-through tanks for assessment of condition prior to release. therefore, the initial stage after hatching provides an ideal opportu- nity to enrich rearing tank water to mark larval otoliths, as it does not interrupt standard hatchery operating protocols and ﬁsh are held at a higher density than is typical at later life history stages. rearing conditions for this study, golden perch were spawned at the narrandera fisheries centre, narrandera, nsw, using standard hormonal induction techniques. eggs were incubated using methods similar to those described by rowland (1996). isotope enrichment took place during the ﬁrst 4–5 days after hatching, in 1-l aquariums. for experimental purposes, a grow-out period of 2 weeks was achieved whereby treated ﬁsh were reared in 5 l of natural (un-enriched) water in dark blue plastic buckets. the buckets were cleaned daily to remove waste from the bottom and water changed every 4–5 days by siphoning through a pvc pipe ﬁtted with a ﬁne screen. all aquariums and buckets were prewashed, rinsed and dried prior to use. aquaria and buckets were all ﬁlled with bore water, and temper- ature was maintained throughout the experiment by placing aquariums and buckets into one of two ﬂow- through water baths that were supplied with bore water. temperature was recorded twice daily in each water bath. determining optimal concentration and length of exposure for isotope marking immediately after hatching, golden perch larvae were transferred to 1-l treatment aquariums, at densities of 400–500 larvae per litre and were reared in isotope enriched water at different concentrations of 137ba (30, )1), for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days, resulting in 12 60 or 90 lgæl treatments. a control treatment in which ﬁsh were held in water with no enriched 137ba was also established. two replicates of each treatment and control were used. creating multiple batch marks golden perch larvae were transferred to 1-l treatment aquariums at an approximate density of 200 larvae per litre immediately after hatching and were reared in isotope enriched water for 4 days using various combinations of enriched isotopes of 136ba, 137ba, 138ba, as well as 24mg, 25mg and 26mg (table 1). )1 were used for each ba concentrations of 100 lgæl )1 isotope and 4000 lgæl for mg isotopes. each treatment and control had a replicate tank, with 32 tanks in total. enriched stable isotopes to batch mark otoliths reared in the hatchery using standard techniques. all )1 of sea salt to assist buckets were treated with 3 gæl longevity of the live food source. twenty larvae per treatment were collected 14 days after ﬁrst feed and stored in 70% ethanol until analysis. some larval samples were collected before the 14 days if a large number of mortalities occurred within a tank. length of larval golden perch was recorded before the dissection of each ﬁsh. water samples for each experiment, water samples from each tank were collected twice: once after the initial spiking of the isotopes and then before ﬁsh were transferred into the grow-out buckets. water samples were taken using a 20-ml syringe and ﬁltered through a 0.45-lm ﬁlter into acid washed 30-ml plastic vials containing 0.5 ml of concentrated nitric acid. the water samples were stored frozen until analysis. the treatments were spiked at water samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (icp-ms). sam- ples were tested against standards with known elemental concentrations and isotope ratios, to conﬁrm that the appropriate levels as well as to determine the contribution of isotopes in the water to the ratios in the otoliths of larval golden perch. water samples were analysed for 138ba and 137ba for the optimal concentration and exposure experiment and for all three ba and mg isotopes used for the multiple batch marks in the second experiment (table 1). grow-out of larvae otolith analyses at the end of the exposure time (1–5 days, dependent on treatment), each experimental tank was transferred into a larger grow-out bucket and enriched water was replaced with clean natural water until the yolk was absorbed, with ﬁnal densities being reduced to 100– 200 larvae per litre, similar to grow-out pond densi- ties. upon switching to exogenous feeding, larvae were fed multiple times per day on zooplankton harvested from ponds or with artemia sp. nauplii table 1. list of treatments used for isotope-induced marks in the otoliths of larval golden perch in the

whole onto microscope slides as per methods described by munro et al. (2009). otoliths from each experimental treatment were randomly analysed using laser ablation-icp-ms (see table 2 for laser and icp-ms parameters). vertical depth proﬁles were taken through the nucleus of the otolith using standard spot analysis (munro et al. 2009). a reference stan- dard (nist 612, national institute of standards and technology) was analysed periodically to determine correction factors. from the resulting data, three ratios were calculated for ba (138ba ⁄ 137ba, 138ba ⁄ 136ba and 137ba ⁄ 136ba) for mg (26mg ⁄ 25mg, 26mg ⁄ 24mg and 25mg ⁄ 24mg). the maximum or minimum values in each depth proﬁle for each isotope ratio were recorded from the otolith data smoothed with a six point moving average (see munro et al. 2008). minimum values were recorded when there was a visible decrease from the natural ratio, resulting from enriching with the lighter of the isotopes, and as well as 159 woodcock et al. table 2. operating parameters for the new wave nd yag 213 nm uv laser and agilent 7500 cs inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (icp-ms). laser wavelength mode frequency spot size laser power carrier gas icp-ms optional gas cone dwell times 213 nm q-switched 5 hz 55 lm 55% ar (0.92 læmin)1) he (59.5%) pt 136ba, 137ba (400 ms) 25mg, 26mg 138ba (300 ms) 24mg (200 ms) maximum values used when there was a visible ratio, occurring from increase from the natural enrichment with the heavier isotope. because of smaller isotopic shifts with the enrichment of lighter isotopes, minimum isotopes, compared to heavier values were taken for control treatment ﬁsh to determine mark success. statistical analysis univariate statistical analyses and linear discriminant function analysis (dfa) were conducted using spss 15.0 or the updated software, pasw statistics 17 for windows (http://www.spss.com), and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted using primer 6 ⁄ permanova+ (http://www.primer-e.com). data for determining optimal concentrations and exposure times for both the water and otoliths were analysed with a two-factor analysis of variance (anova) with length of immersion and enriched ba concentration as ﬁxed factors. in addition, for the water analysis in the optimal concentrations and exposure time experiment, replicate tanks were treated as a random factor (nested within the immersion · concentration term) whereas otolith were treated as a ﬁxed factor and replicate tanks were pooled. within the multiple batch marks exper- iment, one-factor anovas were performed on each of the six isotope ratios to test for differences between the treatments for both the water and the otoliths. tanks from the multiple batch mark experiment were pooled together, as preliminary analysis showed no tank effect present. if signiﬁcant differences occurred within the six isotope ratio treatments, post hoc tukey’s tests were used to identify which treatments differed, in treatments differed particular whether experimental from the controls, and whether isotope enriched treatments differed from each other. where data did not meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, natural log transformations were applied for anova analysis. in addition, a multivariate analysis 160 of variance (permanova) was performed for the ba and mg isotope ratios to determine which treatments differed for the three combined isotope ratios (see munro et al. 2008). multidimensional scaling plots with stress coefﬁcients were then produced. the stress coefﬁcients provide an indication of the goodness of ﬁt and tend to zero when the data are perfectly represented (clarke 1993). mark success was determined from the percentage of otoliths which could be correctly classiﬁed into the treatment groups using linear dfa (pasw). dfa takes a random sample of the data to establish a model; this model is then used to classify the remaining data and determine the percentage of ﬁsh that could be re- assigned to their correct enriched isotope treatment, as well as the percentage of ﬁsh misclassiﬁed and the treatment they were assigned. for creating multiple batch marks experiment, differences in the length of ﬁsh at the end of the 14 day grow-out period and comparisons between the isotope ratios of the otoliths compared to the water samples were also analysed. results determining optimal concentration and length of exposure for isotope marking the 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio in the water was signiﬁcantly different for all three concentrations (table 3). there was no detectable change in the 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio in the water over the course of the enriched isotope rearing period (table 3). there was a signiﬁcant tank effect which was a result of one or two pairs of the treatment tanks having slightly different ba isotope ratios (p < 0.001). given the difference in mean 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratios in the water among the concentra- tion levels, these small within-treatment variations were considered minor. the 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratios in the otolith varied for both the concentration of enriched 137ba and the length of table 3. anova results for the difference in 137ba concentration (30, 60 or 90 lgæl)1) and length of exposure (1, 2, 3 and 5 days) for 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio in the rearing water and larval golden perch otoliths. water concentration exposure concentration · exposure tank (concentration · exposure) within groups otolith concentration exposure concentration · exposure within groups d.f. ms f p 2 3 6 12 24 2 3 6 53 0.134 £0.001 0.012 £0.001 £0.001 3.505 4.851 1.150 0.198 317.920 0.630 0.287 4.614 <0.001 >0.050 >0.050 <0.001 17.725 24.528 5.813 <0.010 <0.010 <0.001 4 3 2 1 a b 7 3 1 / a b 8 3 1 – h t i l o t o 0 0.00 0.10 0.20 water – 138ba/137ba 0.30 0.40 0.50 fig. 1. relation between mean 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio, with standard error, in otoliths of golden perch and rearing water for optimal concentration and length of exposure experiment. the natural )1 and 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio is 6.38. black = 90 lgæl white = 30 lgæl 5 days. solid line is 3 and the 1:1 relation between the otolith and the water. )1, grey = 60 lgæl )1, with 1, 2, exposure (fig. 1, table 3). as the length of exposure to enriched isotopes was increased, the 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio decreased (fig. 1). the greatest change in 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratios in the otoliths of larval golden perch occurred in the 5-day exposures where the ba ratios decreased from the natural ratio of 6.38 to <1.0 for all concentrations (fig. 1). the same trend was seen with concentration of enriched 137ba, where the higher concentrations were associated with a more pronounced decrease in the 138ba ⁄ 137ba ratio (fig. 1). all to the average minimum ratio in control ﬁsh (5.30 ± 0.48). post hoc tests indicated that the ﬁsh exposed to )1 of 137ba for 1-day were signiﬁcantly differ- 30 lgæl ent to the 2-, 3- and 5-day exposure times at the same concentration (fig. 1). one-day exposures were also signiﬁcantly different from the 3-day exposure time )1 as well as the 3- and 5-days in the for the 60 lgæl 90 lgæl treatments were signiﬁcantly different )1 (fig. 1). creating multiple batch marks isotopic ratios were successfully altered with the addition of ba and mg isotopes into the rearing water of golden perch. signiﬁcant differences were found between the water for all ba enriched treatments (p < 0.001) for each of the three ba isotope ratios (table 4). for the mg enriched treatments, signiﬁcant differences were found for the three mg isotope ratios (table 4, p < 0.05);

(2009) found isotope marking resulted in no long-term health effects in the ﬁsh, and given the dose rate was unlikely to impact potential consumers of marked ﬁsh. marking of golden perch using 30 or 60 lgæl )1 of enriched 137ba and exposure time of 1 day was sufﬁcient to achieve a mark on the otolith that was signiﬁcantly different from nonmarked ﬁsh. the ba isotope ratios in golden perch otoliths reached equi- )1 at 5 days, where librium with the water at 90 lgæl otolith isotope ratios were a direct reﬂection of that spiked in the water. larvae were held in a static environment for marking, which should be possible for many species, including salmonids, which absorb their yolk before feeding. even though many larval rearing facilities use ﬂow-through water supplies rather than static tank methods, marking success at day 1 suggests that it may be possible to mark larvae of other species. 163 26mg/24mg 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14 0.12 0.10 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 h t i l o t o h t i l o

water (fig. 4). the mg isotope shifts in the otoliths were not a direct reﬂection of the water and were signiﬁcantly lower than that expected based on the water isotope ratios (fig. 4). effects of marking on growth because of the delicate nature of larvae, it was not possible to measure length at hatching. it was woodcock et al. the short duration required to induce detectable isotopic marks in otoliths in as little as 1 day may limit the physiological stress of the marking methods to acceptable levels for those species which, unlike golden perch, could not be held for 4–5 days. the stable isotopes 136ba, 137ba and 138ba produced distinguishable marks when used singularly or in combination. one hundred percent of ba marked ﬁsh could be effectively distinguished from nonmarked ﬁsh and the different ba treatments and could be distinguished with a high degree of accuracy (93.8% correctly classiﬁed). shifts in mg ratios were detected in the otolith despite the nonlinearity between otoliths and water ratios. however, the shifts in mg isotope ratios were not as distinct as with ba isotope ratios. only 77% of otoliths displayed an isotope signature distinguishable from nonmarked (control) ﬁsh. there was little difference between the different mg isotope enriched treatments because of large variation within a treatment and little difference among treatments, which resulted in only 62% of marked otoliths being correctly classiﬁed to their treatment. as reported in previous research on elemental enrichment (bath et al. 2000; elsdon & gillanders 2003; martin & thorrold 2005; dorval et al. 2007), ba in the otoliths displayed a close relationship to ba in the water. the mg isotope ratios induced into the otoliths, however, were not in equilibrium with the water, despite the water being signiﬁcantly altered by the addition of the enriched mg isotopes. past studies have found the main source of whole body mg comes from the diet and secondarily from the water (shearer & asgard 1992). as the larvae were feeding endogenously during the marking period, it appears likely that the yolk sac served as a major source of mg for the larvae. mg may be regulated by ﬁsh, whereby once the basic physiological mg require- ment has been meet, the ﬁsh can prevent further uptake (shearer & asgard 1992). this could explain why the amount of mg in the otoliths varied between and within different treatments, and shifts in the mg isotope ratios in otoliths were lower than those in the water. furthermore, the combined 137ba + 24mg enriched treatment displayed a smaller shift in the mg isotope ratio compared to singular 24mg enriched treatment. otoliths are held in endolymph, and it is from this ﬂuid that they incorporate the chemical constituents of their environment (campana 1999). only 1–2% of mg ions are taken into the extracellular ﬂuid of ﬁsh, including the plasma from which the endolymph is derived (maguire & cowan 2002). therefore, as the level of mg in the extracellular ﬂuids is restricted, it would appear that the otolith is not being exposed to changes in the isotope ratios of mg in the ambient water (i.e., physiological regulation predominates). 164 the current study suggests that there are a number of advantages to immersion marking of larvae versus marking at other life stages. larvae are typically held at higher densities compared to ﬁngerlings, which lowers the cost of immersion marking by reducing the volume of enriched water required. in addition, as mentioned above, larvae are often held within the hatchery for extended periods of time allowing for the growth of sufﬁcient new otolith material to effectively incorporate the isotopic signatures. mark recovery is also made simpler as marking at the larval stage locates the mark signature in the core of the otolith, whereas marking at a later stage, depending upon the size and age of the ﬁsh at the time of marking, the mark is located at some distance from the core of the otolith. multiple marks, as produced here with ba isotopes, are relatively easy to create. being able to produce multiple marks is potentially advantageous both in stock enhancement programmes and commercial aquaculture. for example, each hatchery could be provided with its own unique chemical ‘tag’. the array of marks created could be used in combination with established otolith analysis to identify in which hatchery a ﬁsh was produced, the year of the stocking (via annual increment ageing) (anderson et al. 1992) or potentially the brood stock from which the ﬁsh came. such detailed information has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the survival, movements and impacts of hatchery-produced ﬁsh. in summary, there is an increasing need to identify the origins of ﬁsh, whether hatchery produced, naturally occurring, illegally stocked or escapees from aquaculture. stable isotope marking techniques provide this capability and can be applied at the larval stage with negligible alterations to normal hatchery protocols. increasing the number of stable isotopes which can be used to effectively mark larval otoliths will add to the number of unique signatures that can be created. broad-scale uptake of methods for enriched stable isotope marking of hatchery ﬁsh has the potential to clarify our current uncertainties stock enhancement pro- about grammes and could provide an important tool for ﬁsheries managers. the outcomes of acknowledgements this work was supported by the murray-darling basin author- ity’s native fish strategy, the university of
