lima & dill 1990; lima 1998, 2002). mobile animals select particular habitats based on a complex set of requirements, such as food, mates and avoidance of predators/competitors (schoﬁeld 2003). as ﬁshes move from one habitat to another, they use proximate factors to minimise predation risk while maximising energetic returns in an overall attempt to maximise ﬁtness (eklo¨v & persson 1996). a number of experimental studies have demonstrated that ﬁshes are capable of balancing predation risk and foraging gains (werner & gilliam 1984; reviews by lima & dill 1990; lima 1998). the littoral zone of lakes offers diverse habitats that vary in depth, substrate type, and macrophyte species composition and density (jackson et al. 2001). fish density and species richness are generally higher in more structurally complex habitats (weaver et al. 1997; macrae & jackson 2001; pratt & smokorowski 2003). as the efﬁciency of prey capture generally decreases in structured habitats, the reduction of predation risk is an important factor in the selection of structurally complex habitats by ﬁshes (savino & stein 1982; anderson 1984; manatunge et al. 2000). in fact, mortality rates of prey ﬁshes are lower in complex, structured environments than in nonstruc- tured, open environments (hickey & kohler 2004). it would therefore be expected that a higher predation risk would increase the number of ﬁsh using structured habitats unless high densities of ﬁshes and the resulting increase in competition changes the proﬁt- ability of the structured habitat. prey behaviours such as schooling are also believed to decrease an individual’s risk of predation. vigilance in groups can allow individuals to minimise their predation risk while foraging (brown & kotler 2004). shoaling behaviour can decrease the probability of an individual being captured by simply reducing the odds that the individual will be the one attacked (brown & 238 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00215.x kotler 2004). while larger groups may be more easily detected, the increase in encounter rates is likely offset by the decrease in the capture probabilities of individuals, a function associated with group size (krause & godin 1995; roberts 1996). it is unlikely that shoaling and use of refuges are mutually exclusive for decreasing predation risk. while the response of prey to the presence of predators has been studied in detail (werner et al. 1983; eklo¨v & persson 1996; lundvall et al. 1999), these studies are limited in their application to natural systems as they were small-scale experiments that focused on speciﬁc prey species. their results have rarely been tested in whole ecosystems and entire ﬁsh assemblages. for example, the abundant empirical evidence that supports the use of complex habitats as one component of an antipredator strategy is primarily from small spatial (laboratory, mesocosm) and short duration experiments (lima 1998, but see biro et al. 2003a). the paucity of large-scale experiments that test whether an entire prey assemblage behaves similarly in natural environments over larger spatial and longer temporal scales is recognised as an important gap in our knowledge of predator–prey interactions (walters & juanes 1993; lima 1998; matthews 1998). in fact, some recent studies have demonstrated that antipredator behaviours may be less robust than expected in ﬁeld situations (irving & magurran 1997; lima & bednekoff 1999). in this whole-lake study, we characterise patterns of cyprinid habitat use and shoal size in the absence of predators and examine changes in these parameters when predatory brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis) were introduced. we assess three potential responses of cyprinids to the introduction of predators: a numerical response, increased use of refugia and an aggregative response. we predicted that all three responses would occur, and that the introduction of a predatory species would be followed by (1) a responses of cyprinids to predator introduction decrease in the abundance of potential prey ﬁshes; (2) a shift in prey use from open habitats to more structured habitats; and (3) an increase in shoal size by prey ﬁshes. these predictions were tested by comparing prey numbers, habitat use and shoal size in two lakes before and after the introduction of a predator with three lakes in which no predator was introduced. methods study lakes the study was conducted over the summers of 2003 and 2004 in ﬁve lakes north of sault ste. marie, ontario, canada. four of the lakes (upper batchaw- ana, lower batchawana, wishart and little turkey) are part of the turkey lakes watershed (47°03¢n, 84°25¢w). the ﬁfth lake, quinn lake (46°43¢n, 84°13¢w), is located 55 km southeast of the water- shed. these lakes were chosen as study sites because of previous and ongoing research on habitat availab- ility, aquatic biodiversity and ﬁsh population dynamics conducted by fisheries and oceans canada. data on ﬁsh and ﬁsh assemblages in wishart lake and little turkey lake have been collected from 1980 (smoko- rowski & kelso 2002) to 2003, while mark-recapture studies on the other three lakes have been conducted from 1998 to 2003. the study lakes are small, shallow and relatively clear, with secchi depths ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 m during the sampling period. clarity of the lakes allowed for distance sampling to be undertaken with relative ease. the lakes are also oligotrophic, with a mean july total phosphorus concentrations ranging )1 from 1.6 lg l (quinn lake). surface temperature for the ﬁve lakes ranged from 18.5 to 23 °c during the sampling period (table 1). )1 (little turkey lake) to 4.7 lg l table 1. physical and biological characteristics of the lakes in the turkey lake watershed and quinn lake. lakes in the turkey lake watershed from headwater to discharge river are: upper batchawana (l1), lower batchawana (l2), wishart (l3) and little turkey (l5). average water temperature and secchi depths refer to the average temperature and secchi depths during sampling times. lake surface area (ha) mean depth (m) july total phosphorus (lg l)1) average secchi depth (m) average water temperature (°c) 2003 2004 2003 2004 fish species present  upper batchawana lower batchawana wishart little turkey quinn 5.9 5.8 19.2 21.0 6.9 3.9 3.2 2.2 6.0 2.7 5.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 16.0 4.25 4.75 3 7.5 3.25 4.8 4.9 3.6 6.6 3.5 22 23 20.5 21 19.5 19.5 18.5 19.25 19.5 19.9 fsd, bkt fsd, bkt lkc, ems, sps, nrd, fhm, cws, bkt, brb lkc, ems, sps, nrd, fhm, cws, bkt, lkt, brb, nss, lgp nrd, gds  species abbreviations, common names and scientiﬁc names: lkc, lake chub (couesius plumbeus);

maximum depth 4.5 m). the lakes are almost entirely underlain by precambrian silicate green- stone, and the surrounding forest is generally mixed hardwood. the shorelines of all the lakes are undeveloped, and there is no angling pressure on the lakes because of their designation as ﬁsh sanctuaries. the most diverse study lake with respect to its ﬁsh community is little turkey, with 11 species of ﬁsh including three piscivores (brook_trout; lake_trout, s. namaycush; burbot, lota lota) (table 1). burbot and brook_trout are also found in wishart lake, which has eight ﬁsh species and is the next most diverse lake. the other three study lakes have only two ﬁsh species. upper and lower batchawana lakes contain ﬁnescale dace (phoxinus neogaeus) and brook_trout. lower batchawana lake was experimentally stocked with 1000 brook_trout in 1992. upper batchawana lake contains a very small brook_trout population, estima- ted at 11 individuals through a mark-recapture study conducted in 2003 (t. c. pratt, unpubl. data). these trout likely came from the stocked population in lower batchawana lake, and managed to enter upper batchawana through periodic episodes of high rainfall, which creates a small spill-over of water into the lower lake. quinn lake contains only northern redbelly dace (notemigonus (phoxinus eos) and golden shiner crysoleucas); the latter species is not present in any other study lake (table 1). quinn lake was stocked with brook_trout in 1992; however, none has been observed or captured since 2001 (t. c. pratt, unpubl. data). for this study, quinn and upper batchawana lakes were treated as piscivore- free, and lower batchawana, wishart and little turkey lakes, all with moderate-to-large piscivore )1) were used as populations (10–63 piscivores ha control lakes. the purpose of habitat classiﬁcation the availability of woody debris and different sub- strate and vegetation types was estimated via a geographic information system quadrat-based tran- sect sampling method (freeza 2001). transects were composed of 1- m2 quadrats consecutively laid perpendicular to shore to the 2-m depth contour or until 10 quadrats were laid, and the percent cover of each habitat type was estimated for each quadrat (freeza 2001). from the descriptions of the available habitat, we used a combination of substrate and cover to identify six distinct habitat categories (table 2). from least to most cover, the categories are open/bare substrate, carpet vegetation, rock, woody debris, complex vegetation and beaver lodge habitats. open/ bare substrate habitats offer little or no cover for ﬁshes and included areas with mud/muck substrates, sand/ gravel, detritus (including fallen leaves) and clay. carpet vegetation habitats contain an extensive cover of (genus isoetes). these two habitats offer the least with respect to available cover. low bottom species such as quillwort rocky habitats consist of areas dominated by boulders and rubble substrate generally >10-cm diameter. habitats classiﬁed as woody debris were those areas containing submerged trees or branches, or overhanging trees where either the trunk or branches extended far enough into the water to offer cover to ﬁshes. the woody debris had to be the dominant feature and offer structural complexity to be classiﬁed as this habitat type. open areas, with few wood structures that offered little in the way of habitat complexity, were not classiﬁed as woody sites. areas classiﬁed as complex vegetation habitats contained plants that were tall and grass or reed-like, such as the pipewort (eriocaulon aquaticum). areas containing extensive cover of emergent vegetation with and without foliage were included in this category. potamogeton spp. (pondweeds) and other tall, thin plants that extended halfway or more up the water column were also considered to be complex table 2. area of each habitat type present in the 0–2-m depth zone in ﬁve study lakes. habitat type (% of littoral zone) lake surface area (ha) littoral zone area beaver lodge emergent vegetation wood rock carpet vegetation open upper batchawana lower batchawana wishart (early summer)  wishart (late summer)  little turkey quinn 5.9 5.8 19.2 19.2 21.0 6.9 3.1 2.7 10.9 10.9 4.3 2.2 0.192 0.296 0.101 0.101 0.300 0.367 8.01 29.7 0.810 1.75 5.53 11.6 2.12 1.09 0.525 0.525 2.76 5.12 3.85 6.20 26.7 24.9 32.3 2.14 64.1 40.1 10.1 27.6 13.1 39.5 21.8 22.6 61.7 45.1 46.1 41.4  wishart lake has a shallow bay that is bare/mud substrate in the early summer sampling period. once temperature increases, carpet and emergent vegetation becomes dominant. 240 vegetation habitats. the distinguishing feature that separated complex from carpet vegetation was the complex structure offered by height of the plant. beaver lodge habitats include both maintained and ‘fallen’ beaver lodges. the areas considered to be beaver lodge habitats extended from the lodge-water interface to where the structure of the lodge ends. beaver lodge, emergent vegetation and woody debris habitats were considered to offer the most structural complexity. although some areas of the rocky habitat provide structure (generally rocky areas along a slope), most rocky habitats in the study lakes are dominated by very large individual boulders in silt and/or mud areas with no crevices and are not complex, structured habitats. fish abundance and habitat use determination prior to predator introduction abundance of each ﬁsh species and life stage were estimated by habitat type in the early summer (june and early july) and late summer (late july and august) of 2003 and 2004. we employed the line-transect method of distance sampling (buckland et al. 1993), whereby a straight line perpendicular to shore was swum and the distance of each observed ﬁsh from the transect was recorded on a polyvinyl chloride wrist slate. this method produced comparable population estimates to those obtained via a mark-recapture sampling method in these lakes (pink et al. in press). as well, the use of distance sampling has been successfully used to enumerate populations of stream ﬁshes (ensign et al. 1995) and marine reef ﬁshes (letourneur et al. 1998; kulbicki & sarramegna 1999). to increase the accuracy of distance estimates, 15- and 30-m transect with 4-m long crosspieces (2 m on each side of the centre line) were constructed out of lead line. fifteen metre transects were used where the slope was great enough that the 30-m transects could not be fully deployed. crosspieces were attached every 5 m on the 30-m transects and every 2.5 m on the 15-m transects. distance from the centre line was marked with coloured adhesive at 5-cm intervals on the crosspieces. two metres was chosen as the maximum search distance from the centre line, as visibility was always greater than this distance in all study lakes. transects were laid out perpendicular to shore, starting at the shoreline and extending towards the centre of the lake until a depth of 2 m was reached. two metres was selected as the cut-off depth because ﬁsh could be seen at this depth in all of the lakes, and in preliminary observations, few ﬁsh were observed at depths >2 m. transects were left undisturbed for 10 min after they were set to minimise the effect of this activity on ﬁshes. thereafter, a single observer swam its full responses of cyprinids to predator introduction length, recording all ﬁshes located within 2 m on either side of the rope. observed ﬁsh were identiﬁed by species and lifestage. lifestages were categorised by observed length as per pink et al. (in press). the number of transects per hectare of littoral zone ranged from 7 to 43 (mean ¼ 23.2 transects per hectare), with more transects performed when ﬁsh density was low to decrease the variation associated with the density estimate (buckland et al. 1993). when shoals were encountered, the number of ﬁsh in the shoal was estimated along with the habitat in which they were observed and their distance from the centre line. fishes were not observed swimming away or changing aggregative patterns prior to observation and enumeration (m. pink pers. obs.). to enable a habitat-speciﬁc ﬁsh density and population estimate, it was also necessary to record the length of each habitat type that was observed while swimming transects. if more than one habitat occupied an area, the dominant habitat was recorded. the program distance (buckland et al. 1993) was used to model the detection function and calculate ﬁsh density and abundance. distance data (the distance from centre line that ﬁshes were observed) were transformed into equal intervals of 10 cm for analysis. the models of detection were half-normal cosine, half- normal simple polynomial, uniform cosine and uni- form simple polynomial, with the detection model selected based on akaike’s information criterion values (buckland et al. 1993). data were stratiﬁed by habitat to determine habitat-speciﬁc encounter rates, detection functions, cluster sizes and densities when possible. for some species and lifestages that were less abundant, sample sizes were too small to achieve coefﬁcients of variation <50% using habitat-stratiﬁed data. in these cases, if coefﬁcients of variation could be lessened, habitat-speciﬁc estimates were obtained by pooling observations from all habitat types and creating a single detection function. this detection function was then applied to each habitat category to calculate habitat-speciﬁc population estimates. com- plete details on the distance sampling transect method outlined above are available in pink et al. (in press). predator introduction and tests of numerical, habitat use and shoaling effects predator treatments involved stocking brook_trout in the predator-free lakes in early may, 2004. brook_trout were chosen for this experiment because they were the principal native piscivore in small lakes in this area. brook_trout, while opportunistic feeders, are known to prey on small forage ﬁshes (power 1980). within the study lakes, a previous introduction of brook_trout into quinn lake was followed by a decrease in the abundance of golden shiner (smokorowski & kelso 241 pink et al. 2002), suggesting that brook_trout do prey on ﬁshes present in the study lakes. forty-eight brook_trout (eight ﬁsh per ha) with a mean fork-length of 338 ± 9 mm (se) were moved from lower to upper batchawana lake. the 152 brook_trout (22 ﬁsh per ha) introduced into quinn lake were hatchery reared in the tarentorus fish culture station, sault ste. marie, on. on the day of their introduction, high air temperatures did not allow for length and weight measurements of all ﬁsh to be taken. the hatchery-reared ﬁsh were nearly uniform in length [mean fork length of a few randomly selected individuals was 195 ± 27 mm (se)]. the stocking and )1 of pred- transfer introduced approximately 2 kg ha ators to each treatment lake, approximating the natural predator biomass of the unstocked control lakes (2.1– )1 based on the autumn 2003 surveys of 2.6 kg ha little turkey and wishart lakes). a before-after/control-impact to test the prediction that brook_trout introduction will decrease the abundance of prey ﬁshes, we performed (baci) assessment using 2003 and 2004 ﬁsh abundance data. analysis was conducted by using the difference between the abundance of ﬁshes in the control lakes from 2003 to 2004 and comparing it to the difference between the abundance of the potential prey ﬁshes in the predator-introduced lakes. a change in abundance in response to predator introductions was said to occur if there was a signiﬁcant difference in the differences in abundance from 2003 to 2004 between the control and manipulated lakes. if there were no trends towards a decrease in population size with the introduction of predators, we could infer that any changes in habitat use would be due to habitat shifts and not ﬁshes from one habitat being consumed in greater numbers than another. to initially determine whether ﬁshes made differential use of available habitat, chi-squared values (krebs 1999) were calculated: v2 ¼ 2  ui ln  x n i¼1    ui upi where ui ¼ the number of ﬁsh of a given species or life stage observed in habitat i, pi is the proportion of habitat i available in the environment/littoral zone of a given lake and u ¼ the total number of observations of habitat use. nonrandom habitat use is suggestive that selection for particular habitats is occurring, although the factor being selected for is unknown. to test the prediction that prey ﬁsh will shift to more structured habitats in response to the introduction of predators, we compared proportional habitat use before and after predator introduction to determine whether changes occurred in the proportion of ﬁshes observed in each habitat in the control and manipu- 242 lated lakes. as previously mentioned, unstructured habitats were considered to be open areas and areas with carpet vegetation. structured habitats were con- sidered to be those areas with beaver lodges, complex vegetation and woody areas. rock was not included in either categories to maximise the contrast between structured and unstructured habitats, as the amount of cover offered by rocky areas differed within and between lakes. early and late assessment periods were pooled for this comparison. a mixed-model anova was run to determine if the addition of predators to upper batchawana and quinn lakes resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in the use of unstructured habitats. signiﬁcant changes in habitat use would be observed as a signiﬁcant interaction between treatment (control and manipulated) and time (before and after introduction) (quinn & keough 2002). the independent variables in the anova model were treatment, lake (nested in treatment), time and proportion of prey ﬁsh of all lifestages and species observed in open and carpet habitats combined. the proportion of prey ﬁsh using open and carpet veget- ation habitats were pooled and used to assess the change in unstructured habitat use. proportional use of unstructured and structured habitats was also assessed by lifestage for all potential prey ﬁshes. to take into account potential species-speciﬁc predation, we also compared the proportional use of habitats for the different lifestages of dace (northern redbelly dace and ﬁnescale dace combined). dace were used for this analysis as they were the only potential prey present in both control and predator manipulated lakes. as well, they have similar morph- ologies, with slender bodies and no body armour (scott & crossman 1973), and they are the numeri- cally dominant species in the study lakes. to test the prediction that there would be an increase in shoal size following the introduction of predators, a paired t-test was used to compare mean shoal sizes of individual species and lifestages in each lake before and after predator introduction in control and predator manipulated lakes. a signiﬁcant post- treatment increase in shoal size in the treatment lakes without a comparable change in the control lakes was taken as evidence of a predator effect. all data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance, and data that did not meet parametric test assumptions were loge (x + 1) transformed. signiﬁ- cance levels were set at p ¼ 0.05 for all statistical tests. results prey abundance when all species were combined, prey populations increased, on average, from 2003 to 2004 in both 2147 ± 3699 control and predator manipulated lakes (mean in- crease: lakes; 10 197 ± 6059

(especially dace), there was cyprinids ecological studies of predator and prey populations have generally shown that prey populations will decrease in response to an increase in the abundance of predators, (taylor 1984; reviews by sih et al. 1985; tonn et al. 1989; korpimaki et al. 2002); however, the reverse has also been detected. kauhala et al. (1999) observed an increase in hare populations in response to an increase in fox and marten populations and kauhala & helle (2000) observed no change in hare popula- tions in response to the removal of fox and marten predators. hixon (1991) also concluded that there was insufﬁcient evidence to state with certainty that piscivores strongly affect the absolute and relative abundance of prey ﬁshes on coral reefs. in our study, the absence of prey population decreases may be the result of the short-time period between the introduc- tion of predators and sampling to estimate population size, or to the brook_trout foraging mainly on nonﬁsh prey. indirect responses to predator introductions, such as shifts in habitat use, can be much more rapid (eklo¨v & persson 1996). the results of our habitat use assessment were mixed, with only limited support of our prediction for increased use of structured habitat by prey ﬁsh following predator introduction. while we did observe a decrease in the proportional use of unstructured 245 pink et al. habitats and an increase in the use of structured habitats by dace following brook_trout introduction, particularly in upper batchawana lake, these shifts in habitat use were not signiﬁcantly different from those that occurred in the control lakes during the same time period. while most experiments have demonstrated that ﬁsh will alter their feeding behaviour and feed in structured habitats where foraging returns are lower in response to presence of a predator (werner et al. 1983; turner & mittelbach 1990; biro et al. 2003a), this response is not universal. mesocosm and small-scale ﬁeld experiments have shown that some cyprinids, percids and centrarchids do not shift habitat when predators are introduced (harvey et al. 1988; devries 1990; christensen & persson 1993; jacobsen & berg 1998; magoulick 2004). fishes in these experiments responded to predator introductions by increasing shoaling behaviour, moving to shallow water and/or reducing activity levels. our observations were con- sistent with these alternate antipredator behaviours, and provide an important conﬁrmation of these smaller-scale experiments that demonstrated ﬂexible habitat use is not the only antipredator strategy employed by prey ﬁshes. the differences in habitat use patterns observed between the two treatment lakes might be due to factors such as differences in resource availability, refuge availability or the size of the introduced brook_trout. the pre-introduction density of cyprinids in quinn lake was ﬁve times that of upper batchawana lake (1700 vs. 350 ﬁsh/ha, respectively), and we postulate that the observed differences in antipredator behaviour may have been due to density-dependent factors. density-dependent antipredator behaviour has been observed in other ﬁshes, with the relative number of individuals using shoaling versus complex habitat refugia as antipredator strategies changing with dif- ferent prey density treatments (magurran & pitcher 1987; rangeley & kramer 1998). it is possible that the availability of refugia was lower in quinn lake due to the high density of prey ﬁshes, and that density- dependent factors inﬂuenced the interaction between shoaling in open habitats and living solitarily in complex habitats. a second factor that may explain the difference in habitat use between treatment lakes was that the brook_trout introduced into upper batchawana lake were, on average, much larger than the hatchery ﬁsh introduced into quinn lake. as piscivores are generally gape limited (hambright 1991; dorner & wagner 2003), brook_trout may have been more effective predators in upper batchawana lake than in quinn lake. fish are generally capable of assessing the relative threat of predation from various sources and can make foraging and habitat selection decisions based on their assess- initially) least (at 246 ments (reviews by lima & dill 1990; lima 1998). this may explain the increase in the use of structurally complex habitats by adult dace in the lake where larger brook_trout were relocated. the response by adult dace and the lack of a response by yoy (young-of-year) dace, in upper batchawana lake, where the larger brook_trout were planted, is consistent with the expectation that piscivores prefer the most energetic- ally proﬁtable prey, generally 0.3–0.4 times their length (juanes 1994). this may also explain the shift to structured habitats by yoy dace, and the absence of habitat shifts by adults, after stocking smaller brook_trout in quinn lake. the inability to detect statistical changes in propor- tional habitat use in our predator manipulated lakes might be due to the predator we used in the study. we chose brook_trout because it is the native predator in these systems. while the brook_trout can be piscivor- ous, it also feeds on insects and insect larvae (power 1980). the species of predator has proven important in determining whether cyprinid habitat shifts occur when predators are introduced in other experiments, as largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides) produced habitat shifts in the central stoneroller (campostoma anomalum) whereas smallmouth bass (m. dolomieui) did not (harvey et al. 1988). thus, the use of a more voracious predator such as largemouth bass that have previously been used in small-scale experiments (savino & stein 1982) might have resulted in higher predation risk and a more uniform movement from unstructured habitats into structured ones. further- more, the presence of only brook_trout in the predator manipulated lakes, but brook_trout and a combination of burbot and/or lake_trout in two of the control lakes might also affect habitat selection differently as multiple predators do not necessarily produce a combined/additive affect on prey species (gonzalez & tessier 1997). categories the habitat chosen in this study represented a range of structured and unstructured habitats; categories were deﬁned based on the substrate and plant cover. however, in response to predators, prey may select for habitat characteristics such as depth of water, or distance to the nearest refuge; characteristics that were not measured in this study. we observed a striking but unquantiﬁed movement towards the shallower edge areas of both treatment introduction (m. pink and t. c. pratt pers. obs.); similar depth shifts have been observed in other experiments (power et al. 1985; harvey et al. 1988; fraser & gilliam 1992; magoulick 2004). the absence of large predators in shallow water habitats (pratt & fox 2001) may reduce predation risk in those habitats, thereby creating a refuge for the large number of juvenile and small-bodied ﬁshes utilising these areas. the predator lakes after in summary, our results demonstrate that the introduction of piscivores can induce potential prey ﬁsh to increase shoal size. the absence of signiﬁcant prey declines or consistent shifts to habitats of increased structural complexity following the intro- duction to predators could be due to the type of predator introduced or the inconsistency of the habitat use responses between the lakes. our experiment demonstrates that it is difﬁcult to predict the responses of prey to predator introduction in natural waterbodies from the results of small-scale experiments. further whole-lake studies are needed to increase our know- ledge concerning predator-induced behavioural chan- ges of prey in natural environments. acknowledgements we would like to thank p. penton and s. nickels for
