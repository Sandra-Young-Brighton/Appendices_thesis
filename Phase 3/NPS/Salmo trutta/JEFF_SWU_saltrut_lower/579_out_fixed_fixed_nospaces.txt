clavero & garcı´a- berthou 2005). it is thus expected that conservation biologists will be challenged to manage and control invasive species in the next decades (allendorf & lundquist 2003). however, freshwater ecosystems have received little attention with respect to the control or eradication of successful invaders, especially in the case of invasive ﬁshes (wittenberg & cock 2001; simberloff 2003). instead, the spread of invasive ﬁsh has been favoured by human activities, with most introductions succeeding in the neotropical region and particularly in brazil (welcomme 1988), where several impacts on native species have been reported (santos & formagio 2000; latini & petrere 2004; agostinho et al. 2006). the parana´ river is the 10th largest river in the world and the second in south america, harbouring more than 250 freshwater ﬁsh species in its upper stretches (agostinho et al. 2007). it also provides most of national hydroelectric energy supply and inland ﬁshery catches (agostinho et al. 2007). nowadays, several medium- to large-sized invasive ﬁshes [>300 mm total length (tl)] have become established in the parana´ river basin, as a result of misguided stocking programmes undertaken in the 1980s and aimed at mitigating the impacts of reservoirs on ﬁsheries (agostinho et al. 2006). invasive species have been identiﬁed as one of the leading factors in the decline of its native ﬁsh richness, also contributing to doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00366.x 491 santos et al. the reduction in the density of the formerly abundant migratory ﬁshes (e.g., brycon orbignyanus, salminus brasiliensis corruscans) (agostinho et al. 2003). pseudoplatystoma and the mechanisms that mediate the establishment and impact of invasive ﬁsh remain poorly understood (alcaraz et al. 2008) and options to control or eradicate invasive ﬁshes are virtually unknown (strong & pemberton 2000; wittenberg & cock 2001; simberloff 2003). although experiments to assess the role of prey morphology and behaviour and habitat complexity on predator–prey ﬁsh interactions have been widely used (savino & stein 1982; juanes et al. 2002), most of the novel trophic interactions between native and invasive ﬁshes are poorly under- stood (garcı´a-berthou 2007) and we are not aware of any experimental study on the interactions of invasive and native neotropical ﬁshes. in this study, the potential of b. orbignyanus to control some invasive species currently introduced to the parana´ river was experimentally addressed through microcosm trials. brycon orbignyanus is a native, medium-sized (<500 mm tl) reophilic char- acid with historical importance to local ﬁsheries. this species is currently endangered as a consequence of multiple anthropogenic impacts, such as hydrological alterations, pollution, habitat loss, overﬁshing and introduction of non-native species (agostinho et al. 2003; machado et al. 2007). the objectives of our study were: (i) to test whether b. orbignyanus pisci- vory affects the survival and behaviour of native and introduced ﬁshes of the parana´ river basin; and (ii) to investigate how habitat complexity, predator and prey behaviour and prey size mediate these predator–prey relationships. methods experimental trials two native (astyanax altiparanae and prochilodus lineatus) and three invasive (cichla piquiti, oreochr- omis niloticus and ictalurus punctatus) species were offered as prey to juvenile b. orbignyanus, an endan- gered ﬁsh native to the parana´ river basin (machado et al. 2007). native prey species were chosen because of their relatively high abundance and wide distribu- tion in the parana´ river (agostinho et al. 1997), whereas invasive species were selected because of their presence in many south american ecosystems, its likely impacts on native taxa (agostinho et al. 2006), and the increasing use of o. niloticus and i. punctatus in brazilian aquaculture (vitule et al. 2009). all the ﬁshes used in the experiments came from local ﬁsh farms, from which they were acquired in january 2006. 492 predation trials were performed in microcosms (300-l glass aquaria, 100 · 50 · 60 cm). to simulate submersed macrophytes, we used plastic ﬁlaments, extending from the bottom to the surface of the aquaria, with a density of ca. 250 ﬁlaments per m2, following savino & stein (1982). we used three treatments of habitat complexity: 0%, no plastic ﬁlaments; 50%, intermediate complexity, with plastic ﬁlaments covering one half of the aquarium surface; 100%, high complexity, with plastic ﬁlaments cover- ing the entire aquarium. including control all ﬁsh were acclimated to aquarium conditions 15 days before performing the trials, and treated with fungicide and bactericide solution to prevent infections. fish were anaesthetised with eugenol (5 ml per 20 l of water) 48 h prior to the experiments and measured (tl and total weight) to assess size-selective predation (see below). the nine individuals of b. orbignyanus used in the trials averaged 133.9 mm (se = 0.12) in tl, and 31.3 g (se = 1.17) in weight, whereas prey individuals (n = 540, treatments) measured 38.9 mm (se = 0.34) tl and 0.68 g (se = 0.02) on average. to mimic natural conditions and to reduce the opportunistic predation over disoriented prey, all aquaria were ﬁrst stocked with prey and the predator was stocked 3 h later. only one b. orbignyanus was stocked in each aquarium with six individuals of each prey species (i.e., a total of 30 prey individuals per aquarium). the ﬁsh density used in the treatments is similar to natural densities of juvenile ﬁsh in the lagoons and littoral areas of the parana´ river (pelicice et al. 2005; bulla 2006). control groups (same prey density, no predator) were also used to test prey survival and behaviour in the absence of predation risk. three replicates were performed for each treatment and all trials, carried out within 4 days, were exposed to a 12d:12l light regime. the number of surviving prey and the behaviour of both predator and prey were recorded at 4-h time intervals (at 9:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00 hours). fish behaviour was assessed directly through visual inspection, and each visual census took ca. 5 min per aquarium. three behavioural traits were measured for b. orbignyanus: (i) microhabitat use (surface, water column or bottom); (ii) refuge use (sheltered, hiding within submersed structures; partially sheltered, using the interface between structured and unstructured areas; or not-sheltered, occupying open water areas); and (iii) activity (immobile, swimming, pursuing or attacking). for each prey species, four behavioural traits were measured (as for predators, except when speciﬁed): microhabitat use; refuge use; schooling (yes ⁄ no); and activity (immobile, swimming, or escaping). subsequent to the ﬁrst census of the ﬁfth day, all aquaria were emptied and the length of the remaining ﬁshes was measured to compare it with the length of the ﬁsh stocked and so to test for size- selectivity in predation. table 1. effects of predator presence (brycon orbignyanus) and habitat complexity on prey survival (arcsin-transformed data): between-subject factors (huynh–feldt corrections) of repeated-measures analysis of variance. experiments with a neotropical characid statistical analyses prey survival and behavioural traits of both predator and prey were compared among treatments (predator presence and habitat complexity) through time with repeated-measures analysis of variance (rm-anova). all the factors were considered as of ﬁxed effects in the rm-anovas. in addition to p-values (statistical signiﬁcance), we also report partial eta squared (g2), as a measure of effect size (i.e., biological signiﬁcance or importance of factors). partial g2 is the proportion of variation explained for a certain effect [effect sum- of-squares (ss) ⁄ (effect ss + error ss)] but is better than conventional g2 (effect ss ⁄ total ss) because it does not depend on the number of sources of variation in the anova design used, as it does not use the total ss as the denominator (tabachnick & fidell 2001). these measures of effect size have the advantage over p-values that do not rely on arbitrary signiﬁcant ⁄ non- signiﬁcant dichotomy and allow the proper compari- son of treatments in contrast to p-values (e.g., a very low p-value does not necessarily mean that a factor has a strong ⁄ stronger effect). proportions (prey sur- vival) were arcsine-transformed (arcsine öx) for statistical analyses because normality and homosce- dasticity were clearly improved. a conventional two- way anova (with habitat complexity and before ⁄ after predation as factors) was performed for each prey species to compare the sizes (tl) of the surviving individuals and those initially stocked in each aquar- ium (i.e., to compare the sizes of prey ﬁsh before and after the b. orbignyanus predation treatment and so to assess size selectivity). all statistical analyses were performed with spss 15ò (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). results prey survival the presence of b. orbignyanus signiﬁcantly inﬂu- enced prey survival (table 1, fig. 1), which was 8–32% higher in predator-free trials. the effect of predator presence varied signiﬁcantly among prey species (predator · prey species interaction, table 1) and the invasive i. punctatus and c. piquiti were the most consumed prey species during the entire trial period (table 1, fig. 2), whereas the invasive o. nil- oticus and the native a. altiparanae and p. lineatus were the least consumed. habitat complexity signif- icantly affected prey survival (table 1), with higher predator success in trials with low habitat complexity (0% and 50% of cover) (fig. 1). the three-way and source of variation d.f. f p-value partial g2 predator prey species habitat complexity predator · prey species predator · habitat complexity prey species · habitat complexity predator · prey species · habitat complexity error 1 76.6 <0.001 0.561 4 10.3 <0.001 0.406 6.4 2 0.003 0.176 6.3 <0.001 0.296 4 0.002 0.193 7.2 2 0.065 0.209 1.9 8 8 1.8 0.101 0.191 60 1.5 1.2 0.9 0.6 99.5 86.9 61.4 ) % ( l i a v v r u s 31.9 0 50 100 habitat complexity (% cover) fig. 1. effects of predator presence (brycon orbignyanus) on prey survival among levels of habitat complexity. black and white bars correspond to predator and predator-free treatments respectively. left axis = arcsin transformed values;

individuals surviving in the predation treatments, conﬁrming that size was less important for these species; conversely, for the other less consumed species, larger individuals were more vulnerable to predation. discussion potential of b. orbignyanus to control invasive ﬁsh species ictalurus punctatus and c. piquiti were by far the prey species most consumed by b. orbignyanus, 496 ) m m ( h t g n

individuals of each prey species initially stocked in all treatments with b. orbignyanus, only six i. punctatus (11.1%) and 14 c. piquiti (25.9%) survived, corresponding to an overall intake of 1.3 i. punctatus and 1.1 c. piquiti per predator per day. we are not aware of any similar study in the literature but our ﬁndings strongly contrast those from an experiment (a.f.g.n. santos, unpub- lished data) in which juvenile s. brasiliensis was tested as native predator. with the same experimental conditions, the indigenous p. lineatus was the most consumed prey by s. brasiliensis, whereas i. puncta- tus was the least consumed. the only similarity between both studies is that c. piquiti was the second most consumed prey by both b. orbignyanus and s. brasiliensis. as juvenile b. orbignyanus was more effective than s. brasiliensis in preying on the same invasive ﬁsh species, the former species is apparently a better candidate to control the populations of i. punctatus and c. piquiti introduced into the parana´ river basin. furthermore, our experimental results lead to further predictions about the predation risk of the other three less consumed prey species. first, the potential of b. orbignyanus to control o. niloticus in natural systems is expected to be weak, as this species displayed the greatest survival at the end of the experiments. second, as the vulnerability of a. alti- paranae and p. lineatus to b. orbignyanus piscivory was also low, probably because of their shared evolutionary history in the parana´ river, no adverse effects of b. orbignyanus predation would be expected on these native prey species in the natural systems. brycon orbignyanus piscivory was clearly medi- ated by habitat complexity, with greater predator experiments with a neotropical characid effectiveness in low-complexity treatments (0% and 50% structure). when accounting for the differential effects of habitat complexity, the consumption of the invasive prey species was even greater, as no i. punctatus survived in 0% and 50% structure treatments, and only three c. piquiti survived at 50% structure treatments (e.g., all c. piquiti were eaten in 0% structure). habitat complexity has often been addressed to investigate predator · prey inter- actions and the lower efﬁciency of b. orbignyanus to predate on more structurally complex habitats might be attributed to a decline in its swimming perfor- mance and in maintaining visual contact with prey as well as to a greater ability of prey to take refuge in the artiﬁcial vegetation. these results agree well with the usual patterns of higher predation rates in low- complexity habitats lacking prey refuges (e.g., savino & stein 1982; bettolli et al. 1992). however, they strongly contrast with the ﬁndings of the companion experiment with juvenile s. brasiliensis (a.f.g.n. santos, unpublished data), which was more effective in high-complexity treatments. brycon orbignyanus and s. brasiliensis are two closely related characids, which share similar ecological niches when juveniles (agostinho et al. 2003). however, their broad devi- ations on prey species preferences and prey con- sumption rates with habitat complexity indicate that neotropical piscivores have an interesting potential to control their effectiveness is highly variable, depending on species-speciﬁc life- history traits. invasive species but species-speciﬁc vulnerability to predation least in part, apart from the effects of habitat complexity, prey vulnerability to b. orbignyanus piscivory was highly variable among prey species (i. punctatus > c. piqu- iti > o. niloticus  p. lineatus  a. altiparanae) than through time. predation vulnerability rather seemed related, at to species-speciﬁc behavioural and morphological features, as the two most consumed species (i. punctatus and c. piquiti) displayed a suite of characteristics quite different to the others species. in the low-complexity treatments (0% and 50% structures) with predator presence, c. piquiti reduced its activity, preferentially occupying the surface and structure-less areas. brycon orbigny- anus predation was greater in low-complexity treat- ments and savino & stein (1982) observed a high vulnerability to micropterus salmoides predation by nonschooling immobile bluegill, lepomis macrochirus, occupying the top edges of the pool. therefore, the conjunction of behavioural traits displayed by c. piquiti, which was not shared by the other four prey species, could be the primary cause of its high predation vulnerability. 497 santos et al. despite also remaining inactive in the low complexity treatments, i. punctatus behaved quite differently to c. piquiti in other aspects. brycon orbignyanus attacked i. punctatus in a very aggressive way, pursuing and masticating them several times, and ﬁnally swal- lowing them only 30–90 s afterwards (a.f.g.n. santos, personal observation). ictalurus punctatus preferen- tially used bottom and structured areas, persisting in a scattering behaviour in predator’s presence. these behavioural patterns cannot clearly explain the greater vulnerability of i. punctatus to b. orbignyanus preda- tion, as they were also present in the three least consumed species. the only observed behavioural difference from i. punctatus was the higher swimming activity of a. altiparanae and p. lineatus in predator’s presence. as swimming performance can crucially affect prey ﬁsh survival (juanes et al. 2002; wolter & arlinghaus 2003), the more active swimming of a. altiparanae and p. lineatus might have provided them some advantages against b. orbignyanus preda- tion. we also hypothesise that the stridulatory sounds produced by catﬁsh with their pectoral spines (fine & ladich 2003) might lead to opposite results than for their native predators, triggering the attacks of b. orbi- gnyanus instead of reducing predation rates. the predation by b. orbignyanus was also mediated by prey size: for the three least consumed prey species, the predator selected the largest individuals, whereas there was no signiﬁcant effect on predation on size structure for the most vulnerable species (c. piquiti and i. punctatus; respectively, the smallest and largest prey used in the experiments). management implications our results suggest that juvenile b. orbignyanus is an interesting candidate to help to control some ﬁsh species introduced to the parana´ river basin, partic- ularly i. punctatus and c. piquiti. ictalurus punctatus is not widespread in the parana´ river basin (agostinho & gomes 1997) but increasingly used and escaping from aquaculture facilities (vitule et al. 2009), so enhancing the populations of b. orbignyanus might help to limit its spread. c. piquiti was ﬁrst recorded in the parana´ river basin in the early 1980s (agostinho et al. 2006, 2007) and is presently widespread, with stable populations in numerous reservoirs, marginal lagoons and rivers of this huge ecosystem. given the predation rates observed for this species in the experimental trials and that young c. piquiti generally receive intensive parental care in nature (lowe- mcconnell 1991), b. orbignyanus may help to decrease the density of this invasive species in natural ecosystems but is unlikely to eradicate it. the effectiveness of b. orbignyanus to prey on both i. punctatus and c. piquiti might be greater in natural 498 systems with low levels of habitat complexity, such as in the main river channels and in those marginal lagoons in which macrophytes and other submersed structures are not excessively abundant. brycon orbi- gnyanus is, however, a native species presently endangered following the iucn criteria (machado et al. 2007) and there are several pleas for implanting management actions to promote speciﬁcally its pop- ulation recovery in the parana´ river basin. fishery restrictions, ﬂooding pulse rehabilitation and scientiﬁc stocking programs are amongst the primary manage- ment actions to be undertaken (agostinho et al. 2003). if these management actions effectively succeed in restoring b. orbignyanus populations, they would be an excellent opportunity to test whether (i) the results of our experimental trials scale up at very large scales (lodge et al. 1998) and (ii) whether the recovery of endangered native predators reduces the success of invasive ﬁsh species in the parana´ river and other diverse and large freshwater ecosystems in south america. acknowledgements to afgns, (graduate grant the experiments were carried out in agreement with the ‘ethical principal
