traits which are likely to confer them survival advantages in the low productivity, food-scarce environments they occupy. the smaller larvae of lower catchment species are likely to be a consequence of females investing in fecundity in these relatively resource-rich streams. key words: larval size; ontogeny; egg size; swimming ability; morphology introduction the early life stages of fish have long been recogni- sed as a critical period in their survival (chambers & trippel 1997). largely due to their small size, fish larvae are highly vulnerable to predation (paradis et al. 1996), starvation (iguchi & mizuno 1999), intrinsic mortality factors (letcher et al. 1996) and involuntary dispersal in currents (reichard et al. 2002). in freshwater fish, mortality rates during the larval stage have been estimated at 94.5% (houde 1994), the most critical period being the first few weeks immediately posthatch, especially during the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding (elliott 1989; einum & fleming 2000). for larvae to survive this inherently risky period in their develop- ment, they must be provisioned with sufficient resources and adequately developed to persist in the often harsh environments they inhabit (parker & begon 1986; chambers & trippel 1997; schiemer et al. 2003). in oviparous fish, maternal provisioning to the off- spring occurs solely through allocation of resources to the egg prior to spawning (tyler & sumpter 1996). larger eggs with greater energetic reserves result in larger, better-provisioned larvae (marsh 1986; einum 2003; ponce de leon et al. 2011), which often have improved survival chances (bage- nal 1969; marsh 1986; sogard 1997). however, the limitations driving the trade-off between egg size and fecundity mean that increasing resource allocation to the individual egg inevitably reduces the number that a female can produce (smith & fretwell 1974; einum & fleming 1999; johnston & leggett 2002). a bal- ance must be struck between overprovisioning eggs, which could potentially reduce fecundity below that correspondence: peter e. jones; department of zoology, university of otago, 340, great king street, dunedin 9016, new zealand. e-mail: pelwynjones@hotmail.com. doi: 10.1111/eff.12203 211 jones & closs of provisioning inappropriate required to counter mortality rates, and under-provi- sioning, which could render offspring unfit to survive the environmental conditions encountered. thus, the consequences of resources are potentially catastrophic: the entire prog- eny could be lost. life-history theory would suggest the optimal balance in this trade-off is to sufficiently provision offspring to make survival likely, but allo- cate any additional resources to maximise the number of recruits (hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 1999, 2000; einum 2003; rollinson & hutchings 2013). optimal offspring size can vary in relation to food availability in the rearing environment (goto 1990; hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 1999; closs et al. 2013). one of the key challenges facing larval fish is obtaining sufficient nourishment during early life to avoid starvation and to sustain growth and develop- ment through to the juvenile stages (miller et al. 1988; iguchi & mizuno 1999). fish larvae are severely gape-limited feeders, the range of food items consumed increasing with gape size (bremigan & stein 1994; devries et al. 1998). in small, high alti- tude, headwater streams, there is little autochthonous production and zooplankton are generally scarce (vannote et al. 1980; culp & davies 1982; goto 1990). food resources can be dominated by inputs of terrestrial invertebrates, which are often larger than aquatic food items (e.g. kawaguchi & nakano 2001). also, the cold temperatures in these high altitude streams can inhibit growth (pepin 1991), increasing the length of time required to grow to a size that will allow larvae to eat a wide range of larger prey. lar- ger larvae have better survival chances in these poor rearing conditions (goto 1990; winemiller & rose 1993; einum 2003) because they have greater ener- getic reserves (marsh 1986; pepin 1991) and a greater capacity to forage efficiently (blaxter 1986; miller et al. 1988). with increasing longitudinal dis- tance downstream, the abundance of small food items and temperature generally increases (vannote et al. 1980; culp & davies 1982; goto 1990; arscott et al. 2005). thus, in lower catchment streams, some of the relative advantages of large, well-developed larvae are likely to be reduced. under these relatively benign larval rearing conditions, evidence would sug- gest the optimal life-history strategy is to reduce egg size and therefore larval size, to maximise maternal fecundity (hutchings 1991; winemiller & rose 1993; einum & fleming 1999). there is a general paucity of literature relating to early life-history traits fishes. study of larval traits has largely concentrated on spe- cies inhabiting large rivers or lakes (e.g. bremigan & stein 1994; schiemer et al. 2004; king 2005; martin et al. 2012) and has been biased towards salmonid in stream-resident 212 fry (e.g. bagenal 1969; beacham & murray 1985; ojanguren et al. 1996; gilbey et al. 2005). relatively little work has been performed examining posthatch morphology, behaviour and development in stream- resident taxa. although egg size is generally repre- sentative of the amount of energy available to larvae on hatching (teletchea et al. 2009), relationships with larval size and morphology are not always pre- dictable (e.g. semmens & swearer 2012). egg and larval size differences can have significant ramifica- tions for biologically important traits such as incuba- tion time et al. 2009; teletchea & fontaine 2010) and swimming ability (miller et al. 1988), which is important in determining the propen- sity of larvae to disperse (e.g. schludermann et al. 2012; kopf et al. 2014). differences in early life-his- tory traits can also have unpredictable consequences for how species respond to anthropogenic pressures (e.g. humphries et al. 2002, baumgartner et al. 2006). thus, the lack of information regarding the morphology and behaviour of stream fish during the larval period represents a major knowledge gap in freshwater fish ecology. (teletchea et al. (waters 2010). the jones et al. (in press) identified a suite of life-his- tory strategies associated with environmental gradi- ents in the galaxias vulgaris complex, a group of closely related nonmigratory lineages endemic to the south island, new zealand. this cryptic species complex is directly descended from a common amp- hidromous ancestor and represents at least 10 genetic lineages; six of which have been recognised as dis- tinct species, with the remainder awaiting formal rec- ognition lineages (henceforth referred to as species) occupy contrasting habitat types, and these have been associated with interspecific life-history divergence across the com- plex (jones et al. in press). species occurring in low productivity, headwater creeks have larger oocytes than those inhabiting higher productivity, lower catchment streams; mean oocyte volume differing by up to 1.7 mm3 or 134% between species. an egg size/fecundity trade-off has been identified, and the ‘smaller-egged’ lower catchment species showing mean size-relative fecundities up to over 3 times higher than the ‘larger-egged’ headwater species. such substantial differences in maternal investment strategies are likely to have marked consequences for the early ontogeny (bagenal 1969; miller et al. 1988; ponce de leon et al. 2011). this study examines interspecific differences in water-hardened egg size, incubation time, larval size, swimming behaviour and development in the g. vul- garis complex. a number of a priori predictions were made: (i) water-hardened egg size is larger, and incubation time longer in headwater species than in lower catchment species, (ii) larvae of headwater species are larger at hatch, with key morphological features better developed than those of lower catch- ment species, (iii) headwater species have a better swimming ability immediately posthatch than lower catchment species and (iv) interspecific differences in posthatch length and swimming ability persist through the larval period. materials and methods study species the g. vulgaris complex was originally thought to represent a single variable species (mcdowall 1990) but intensive morphometric and genetic analysis revealed the full extent of the group (allibone et al. 1996; mcdowall & wallis 1996; waters & wallis 2001; waters et al. 2010). adults of many species are very similar in appearance, and differentiation of some species is challenging based on morphology alone (mcdowall 2000). they are small-bodied fish, lengths of 100– commonly only growing to total 115 mm (mcdowall 1990), although older individu- als of some species occasionally reach maxima of over 150 mm (jellyman et al. 2013). (july; jones et al. gonadal development occurs predominantly from late-summer to late-autumn (february–june; cadwall- ader 1976), with the majority of oocyte growth com- plete by mid-winter in press). females spawn a single batch of eggs once yearly from late-august to mid-october, timing being vari- able among species (cadwallader 1976; allibone & townsend 1997b; jones et al. in press). the onset of spawning is likely determined by water temperature and day length increases associated with spring (cad- wallader 1976), occurring later with increasing alti- tude. spawning habitat differs somewhat between species, some spawning mid-stream under boulders or cobble substrate, while others predominately spawn in periphery habitat in submerged vegetation (allibone & townsend 1997b; moore et al. 1999). however, recent observations indicate spawning hab- itat is facultative within species, largely dependent upon what substrate is available (jones 2014). upon hatching, larvae drift downstream until they settle in areas of slow flow (<10 cms  1) where they maintain a pelagic swimming position until they are large enough to negotiate currents in the main channel (jel- lyman & mcintosh 2008). the larvae generally form small shoals in these backwaters with little evidence of territoriality (jellyman & mcintosh 2008). in con- trast to the adults, which are mainly benthic macroin- vertebrate feeders, larvae are pelagic drift feeders (cadwallader 1975). a selection of four species from the g. vulgaris traits: complex was chosen for study of larval galaxiid early life-history traits g. anomalus, g. depressiceps, g. eldoni and g. pul- lus. these species all occur in the otago region of the south island, nz, at a similar latitude (44–46°s), but their altitudinal distributions differ markedly, and they occur in fundamentally different microclimatic zones and habitat types (allibone & townsend 1997a; mcdowall 2010; jones et al. in press). this selection of species encompasses the full range of reproductive strategies previously observed within the g. vulgaris complex (jones et al. in press). jones et al. (in press) examined trait–environment relation- ships in females of various species collected immedi- ately prior to spawning when they were carrying oocytes in an advanced stage of development. galax- ias pullus and g. eldoni have highly restricted distri- butions, predominantly occurring in small, high altitude headwater creeks which experience cold tem- peratures and are highly shaded. these species have the largest mean (se) oocyte sizes (2.9  0.2 mm3 and 3.0  0.2 mm3 respectively) seen within the g. vulgaris complex. in contrast, g. anomalus occurs in relatively large, lowland systems where summer temperatures are markedly warmer. it has size (1.3  0.1 mm3) observed in the g. vulgaris com- plex. g. depressiceps is associated with streams of intermediate habitat characteristics and has an inter- mediate mean (se) oocyte size (2.1  0.1 mm3). smallest mean less shaded, (se) oocyte the ontogenetic study to assess interspecific differences in larval morphol- ogy, swimming ability and development, multiple batches of eggs and larvae were obtained for each species. to account for intraspecific variation, 3–9 batches of eggs (and larvae) were obtained for each species (table 1), derived from 2–5 populations per species. egg batches were either (1) stripped and fertilised from ripe fish, or (2) collected from spawn- ing sites in streams: 1. fish were collected using a kainga efm 300 backpack electro-fisher (niwa instrument sys- tems, christchurch, new zealand) generating a 300–600 v pulsed dc current. collections were carried out immediately before the predicted spawning season (september–october, 2011 and 2012), when fish were carrying oocytes in an advanced stage of development (jones et al. in press). if oocytes had not ovulated, ovulation was induced by administering two intramuscular injections gonadotropin of (1000 iukg  1) over a 24-h period (see dimaggio et al. 2013). once ovulated, eggs were stripped from live females into plastic petri dishes and fertilised with milt from live males and then chorionic human 213 jones & closs table 1. numbers of egg batches successfully stripped and fertilised or collected from spawning locations for each species. stripped collected total g. anomalus g. depressiceps g. eldoni g. pullus 6 3 3 2 3 4 2 1 9 7 5 3 submerged in freshwater methods see mitchell 1989). to water-harden (for 2. egg masses were collected from spawning sites in streams in october or early-november in 2011 and 2012. to ensure batches were from different parents, no more than one batch was collected from a single population. searches were made fol- lowing spawning site descriptions of moore et al. (1999) and allibone & townsend (1997b). egg batches were incubated in petri dishes contain- ing freshwater, under low light conditions, with twice daily water changes. for large egg masses (>300 eggs), clutches were split between two or three petri dishes to minimise crowding. any dead eggs were removed twice daily and egg masses were treated approximately twice weekly with methylene blue solution (~1 ppm) to deter fungal infection. incubation temperatures temperatures (11–16 °c) at the laboratory in dunedin, new zealand, and the photoperiod was adjusted to simulate actual daylight increases in spring (12–14 h). as batches were incubated over different time periods, they experienced slightly different incubation temperatures, but mean incubation temperature varied little between individual batches (mean  sd = 13.6  0.3 °c, range of mean batch temperatures = 13.0–14.2 °c). varied with ambient to assess the consequences of egg size variation for larval traits, water-hardened egg diameter and water-hardened yolk diameter (which can represent a more direct measure of maternal provisioning; tyler & sumpter 1996) were measured in subsamples of 10 randomly selected eggs per batch following water hardening (>12 h after submersion). measurement of these spawned eggs allowed us to assess the func- tional relevance of oocyte size differences observed in these species (allibone & townsend 1997b; jones et al. in press). digital images of eggs were taken at a known scale using an optimus sc100 camera (olympus corporation, tokyo, japan) mounted on a dissecting microscope. as eggs were not consistently spherical (although close to), diameters were taken as the means of the long and short axis measurements (0.01 mm). measurements were performed using cellsens standard 1.5 image software (olympus corporation, tokyo, japan). five batches of eggs hatched (2 g. anomalus, 2 g. depressiceps and 1 g. eldoni) while being transported back to the laboratory so water-hardened egg size measurements were not possible for these. also, no yolk measure- ments were taken for any egg batches collected from the field as embryos were often already developed. for all egg batches where fertilisation date was known (i.e. not batches collected from streams), the incubation time in days from fertilisation until hatch was recorded for each individual larva. analysis to examine the morphological traits of newly emerged larvae, at least 10 individuals per batch were subsampled immediately posthatch (<12 h old). lar- vae were preserved in 5% buffered formalin (pepin & penney 1997) and fixed for at least 2 weeks before being transferred to 70% ethanol prior to processing. morphological measurements were made using the same set-up as for the egg measurements. eight met- rics were measured to characterise the physical fea- tures of larvae (0.01 mm, fig. 1). total length, which was used to quantify larval size, was measured as it is an important determinant of foraging ability, resistance to starvation and swimming ability (miller et al. 1988). myomere depth, a second measure of size and robustness, was measured perpendicular to fig. 1. diagram of newly hatched larvae showing the points at which total length (tl), myomere depth (md), eye diameter (eda, ıb), yolk sac diameter (ysda, ysdb) and oil globule diameter (ogda, ogdb) were measured. tl was not measured as a straight line because larvae were often dorso-ventrally flexed. also shown is an insert detailing how upper maxilla length (uml) was measured and the formula used to calculate gape diameter (gd;

fig. 1). eye diameter (mean of long and short axis measure- ments) was measured as it is important in terms of prey acquisition and foraging ability (miller et al. 1988). the yolk sac and oil globule diameters (mean of long and short axis measurements; semmens & swearer 2012) were also measured as they are the main endogenous food reserves (balon 1986) and are thus important in influencing resistance to starvation (miller et al. 1988). channel to assess interspecific differences in swimming ability, critical swimming speed (ucrit; plaut 2001) was assessed in larvae immediately posthatch (<12 h old). ucrit is a measure of the aerobic, prolonged swimming ability of fish, characterised by periods of cruising and burst swimming (hammer 1995) and is widely used to estimate larval swimming perfor- mance due to its ecological relevance for feeding and avoidance of dispersal (plaut 2001; pavlov et al. 2008; kopf et al. 2014). due to logistical limitations, ucrit was only assessed in 3–6 batches of larvae per species (in a minimum of 10 individuals per batch). swimming tests were carried out in a unidirectional flow tank (see hurd et al. 1994), fitted with an obser- (350 9 80 9 200 mm) where vation approximately laminar flow velocities could be varied between 0 and 35 cms  1. wire gauze (1 mm-mesh size) was fixed to either end of the observation cham- ber to prevent larvae from escaping. prior to trials, larvae were introduced to the observation chamber with no flow and were left to acclimatise for 2 min. after the acclimatisation period, water velocity within the observation chamber was increased from an initial speed of 1 cms  1 at fatigue occurred which was 2-min intervals until assessed as when the larvae were pinned against the wire mesh at the back of the observation chamber for more than 5 s and could not be stimulated to move.    ucrit was calculated as: ucrit ¼ ui þ uii ti tii  1 in increments of 2 cms  where ui is the highest velocity maintained for the whole interval (cms  1), uii is the velocity increment (cms  1), ti is the time elapsed from velocity increase to fatigue (min) and tii is the interval time (min; see plaut 2001). in one batch per species, posthatch development was investigated by raising larvae through the larval period – defined as the period from hatching until galaxiid early life-history traits disappearance of the median finfold (urho 2002). larvae were housed at densities no higher than 10 larvael  1 (to minimise density-dependent effects) in 3 litre capacity, white plastic tubs containing fresh- water and were fed daily on a combination of art- emia sp. nauplii and finely ground aquaculture feed pellets (reliance stock foods, new zealand). rear- ing temperatures varied with ambient temperatures in the laboratory which ranged between 12.5–16.5 °c, and photoperiod was adjusted to simulate actual day- light increases with spring (13–16 h). as larvae were reared over different time periods, rearing tempera- ture differed slightly between batches. however, between batch differences in mean temperature over the rearing period were less than 1 °c [mean (sd) = 14.6  0.3 °c, range of mean rearing temps. = 14.3– 15.0 °c]. subsamples of larvae were taken at 0, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days posthatch to track development length (0.01 mm) through the larval stage. total and ucrit were measured for 10 larvae per batch at each age interval. temperatures) laboratory (ambient data analysis to test for interspecific differences in trait values, we used one-way anovas and post hoc tukey’s hsd tests (hsd) to examine pairwise differences. relationships between species’ traits were examined using linear regression analyses. to test whether differences in various morphological traits differed independently of larval length between species, ancovas were used to control for the effect of total length. variables were log-transformed where necessary to achieve normal- ity. all statistical analyses were carried out using spss statistics 20 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). results water-hardened egg diameter varied significantly between species (one-way anova – f3,15 = 31.0, p < 0.001) being larger in g. eldoni and g. pullus than in g. anomalus and g. depressiceps (table 2). mean interspecific differences of up to 0.76 mm or 38% in water-hardened egg diameter were observed (between g. anomalus and g. pullus). assuming a spherical shape, this difference equates to a 163% difference in egg volume. galaxias depressiceps had marginally larger water-hardened egg size than g. anomalus (mean diff. = 0.14 mm) but the differ- ence was not significant (tukey’s hsd – p = 0.34). no significant difference was found in water-hard- ened egg size between g. eldoni and g. pullus (tukey’s hsd – p = 0.64). yolk diameters also dif- fered significantly between species (one-way anova – f3,11 = 12.1, p < 0.001), and pairwise comparisons 215 jones & closs table 2. interspecific differences in water-hardened egg diameter (whed), water-hardened yolk diameter (whyd) and incubation time (it). whed (mm) 2.00 (0.07)a 2.14 (0.02)a 2.63 (0.09)b 2.76 (0.01)b whyd (mm) 1.42 (0.04)a 1.54 (0.03)ab 1.73 (0.10)bc 1.92 (0.01)c it (days) 27.2 (0.9)a 29.5 (1.4)ab 33.5 (3.2)ab 35.3 (0.7)b g. anomalus g. depressiceps g. eldoni g. pullus values = mean  se. different differences in mean trait values (post hoc tukey’s hsd tests – p < 0.05). subscript significant letters indicate revealed similar interspecific differences as for water- hardened egg diameter, except no significant differ- ence was observed between g. depressiceps and g. eldoni (tukey’s hsd – p = 0.18). while complete hatching of the entire clutch occurred spontaneously over 24 hours in some batches, individuals hatched sporadically over a per- iod of up to 24 days in others. mean time from fertil- isation to hatch varied from 24 to 36 days between egg batches. there was significant interspecific varia- tion in hatch times (one-way anova – f3,10 = 4.76, p = 0.03) but post hoc tukey’s t-test pairwise com- parisons revealed these were only significant between the species with smallest eggs (g. anomalus) and largest eggs (g. pullus;

(in press). assuming a spherical shape, the largest between species differ- ence in mean water-hardened egg diameter (between g. anomalus and g. pullus) equates to a 163% dif- ference in volume, which is highly likely to be of biological significance to the offspring. in agreement with the predictions of life-history theory (hutchings 1991; winemiller & rose 1993; einum & fleming 1999; species which occur in low productivity headwater creeks (g. eldoni and g. pullus) had substantially larger johnston & leggett 2002), the 20 (a) ) m m ( h t g n e l n a e m 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 0 4 7 14 age (days) 21 28 (b) t i r c u n a e m 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0 4 g. depressiceps g. eldoni galaxiid early life-history traits 21 28 7 14 age (days) g. pullus fig. 5. changes in (a) mean total length and (b) mean ucrit (95% confidence intervals) in larvae of each species through the first 28 days of development. g. anomalus lesser systems eggs than the species which inhabit higher productiv- ity lower catchment (g. anomalus, and to a extent, g. depressiceps). although g. depressiceps, the species which occurs in interme- diate environments, had larger water-hardened eggs than g. anomalus, the difference was not statistically significant. significant differences in egg size have previously been found between these species (allibone & townsend 1997b; jones et al. in press). the low replication in the present study may have limited our ability to detect less substantial interspecific differences in egg size. the strong positive relationship seen between incu- bation time and egg size is consistent with studies in other teleost fish which have found smaller eggs have shorter developmental times than larger eggs (pauly & pullin 1988; pepin 1991; teletchea et al. 2009). concurrent with this, g. depressiceps larvae (larger egg size; jones et al. in press) have been repeatedly observed emerging approximately 2–3 weeks later than g. anomalus larvae (smaller egg size; jones et al. in the single stream where they co-occur (jones 2014). the incubation times found in the laboratory (range of means – 25–38 days) are unlikely to be representative of incubation time in situ, as temperatures were between 5–9 °c warmer than typical stream water temperatures during incuba- tion period (jones 2014). thus, embryo development is likely to have been faster in the present study than under natural conditions (field observations would in press) suggest approximately 6 weeks from spawning to emergence; jones 2014). the high within-batch vari- ability in incubation time could have been a conse- quence of poor simulation of natural hatching cues in the laboratory (warkentin 2011). exact hatching cues in the g. vulgaris complex are unknown, but hatch- ing has been associated with increases in temperature and photoperiod during spring (cadwallader 1976). egg batches did experience increasing temperatures and daylight hours but other potentially important hatching cues, such as flow disturbance (warkentin 2011), were absent. the strong positive relationship between egg size and larval length is consistent with numerous studies across a range of freshwater genera (marsh 1986; miller et al. 1988; einum 2003; ponce de leon et al. 2011) and confirms the ecological relevance of the oocyte differences reported by jones et al. (in press). differences were greatest between the headwater spe- cies (g. eldoni and g. pullus) and the lower catch- ment species (g. anomalus) with mean interspecific differences in total length at hatch as large as 2.6 mm or 41%. the larger larvae in headwater species are likely to be more resistant to starvation (bagenal 1969; marsh 1986; yufera & darias 2007), have greater feeding (miller et al. 1988), be better foragers (blaxter 1986; pepin 1991), and thus have higher growth and survival chances in food-scarce conditions (einum & fleming 1999; einum 2003). although not flexibility in time till first 219 jones & closs statistically significant, even the smaller difference (just under 1 mm) found between g. depressiceps and g. anomalus may well be ecologically important, as even very small size differences (3%) can have considerable consequences for larval fitness (mccor- mick & hoey 2004). the low replication at the batch level within species may have limited our ability to detect interspecific differences in length. the interspecific differences in myomere depth were differences amongst species, so not only did headwater species have longer larvae but they were also deeper bodied and more robust. consistent with less substantial length gape diameter was significantly larger in headwa- ter species (g. pullus and g. eldoni) than in the lower catchment species (g. anomalus) and to a les- ser extent the intermediate species (g. depressiceps). gape size is one of the fundamental limitations fac- ing larvae at the start of the exogenous feeding period (bremigan & stein 1994; makrakis et al. 2008) affecting both the range and maximum size of prey items that can be consumed (bremigan & stein 1994; king 2005). hence, the large gapes seen in the head- water species (on average up to over 0.24 mm larger than lower catchment species) are likely to confer a much greater range of potential prey items. larvae of headwater species also had substantially larger eye diameter than lower catchment species which is important in visual acuity and reactive distance (blaxter 1986), likely contributing to improved forag- ing ability (miller et al. 1988). all species hatched with the yolk sac and oil globule still present, as would be expected in stream-resident species, as hatching with some endogenous reserves allows flex- ibility in the transition to exogenous feeding (balon 1986; miller et al. 1988; goto 1990; urho 2002). it had been expected that larvae of headwater species would be equipped with larger reserves relative to their size to allow them greater flexibility in the mixed feeding period (miller et al. 1988). however, there was no evidence that there were size–relative yolk sac or oil globule diameter differences among species and reserves appeared to deplete over similar time periods for each species. however, despite this, the literature would suggest that larvae of the headwater species, g. eldoni and g. pullus, should have greater resis- tance to starvation simply because they are larger and more robust (marsh 1986; miller et al. 1988). the lack of statistically significant differences in critical swimming ability between species is likely to be due to small sample size and the high variability in swimming ability within species. the largest source of this variation appeared to be in posthatch behaviour, which could be due to a lack of natural hatching cues in the laboratory (warkentin 2011). in particular, many larvae, especially in batches of the 220 largest eggs, hatched with abnormally large yolk sacs and swimming in these larvae appeared laboured. larger eggs often consume more oxygen (einum et al. 2002), and it is quite probable that laboratory incubation provided suboptimal oxygen levels, per- haps encouraging early hatch in the largest eggs (warkentin 2011). despite these sources of error, the strong positive relationship between mean larval length and mean critical swimming ability (ucrit) across all species supports the a priori hypothesis that species with larger larvae have better swimming ability. this is also supported by a wealth of the liter- ature demonstrating that larger larvae have better swimming ability than smaller larvae (miller et al. 1988; fisher et al. 2005; kopf et al. 2014). better swimming ability makes larvae more mobile, increas- ing prey encounter rates (miller et al. 1988) and increases their foraging success due to improved strike ability (blaxter 1986). the difference in ucrit of over 10 cms  1 between the batches of smallest and largest larvae could potentially have major implica- tions for dispersal (plaut 2001; pavlov et al. 2008), as galaxiid larvae are prone to passive downstream drift immediately after hatching (jellyman & mcintosh 2008; jellyman & mcintosh 2010). the general persistence of posthatch differences in length and swimming ability over the larval period indicates their biological significance. other studies have reported initial size differences disappear when larvae are reared under hatchery conditions (hutch- ings 1991; einum & fleming 1999). given that the larvae in the present study were raised at tempera- tures between 4 and 7 °c warmer than in situ stream temperatures (jones 2014) and were fed regularly, it is likely that conditions were relatively benign. under harsh rearing environments (low food abundance and cold temperatures), the fitness benefits of large larvae are likely to be augmented (winemiller & rose 1993; einum 2003). the results presented here are consistent with the- ory predicting egg, and larval size decreases with increasing food availability (hutchings 1991; winem- iller & rose 1993; einum & fleming 1999). in keep- ing with the findings of jones et al. (in press), species inhabiting lower productivity headwater streams had larger eggs and larvae than those in higher productivity lower catchment systems. the g. vulgaris complex is descended from a common amphidromous ancestor (waters et al. 2010). a loss of amphidromy is associated with an increase in egg and larval size, which allows nonmigratory species to complete their life cycles in low productivity fresh- water habitats (goto 1990; closs et al. 2013). the interspecific differences seen here suggest that coloni- sation of high altitude headwater creeks requires a continuation of this evolutionary process. there is generally a scarcity of small food items in headwater streams (culp & davies 1982; goto 1990; arscott et al. 2005) and prey items are often larger and of terrestrial origin (kawaguchi & nakano 2001). the larger larvae of g. pullus and g. eldoni displayed a suite of traits which are likely to provide them with survival advantages in these food-scarce conditions (hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 1999). a larger size at hatch also confers higher competitive ability (economou 1991) which is likely to be beneficial in these small, stable systems (jones et al. in press) where intraspecific competition is often more intense (winemiller & rose 1992). in contrast, the lower catchment species (g. anomalus) larvae were small and altricial in their development, which is probably a strategy that maximises fecundity (smith & fret- well 1974; hutchings 1991; einum & fleming 1999) in the relatively food-rich lower catchment systems these species rear in (culp & davies 1982; goto 1990; jones et al. in press). intraspecific competitive interactions are also likely to be less intense in these larger streams (winemiller & rose 1992), reducing the need for a larger size at hatch (economou 1991). the intermediate traits seen in g. depressiceps, which inhabits intermediate habitat types, substanti- ates the observed egg/larval size gradient from head- waters to lower catchment systems (jones et al. in press). it is probable that similar patterns of offspring size/fecundity trade-offs exist elsewhere in other radi- ations of galaxiids such as species complexes identi- fied in australia (hardie et al. 2006; adams et al. 2014) and thought in south africa (wishart et al. 2006). to be present adults of the various species in the g. vulgaris complex are difficult to distinguish on external appearance alone (mcdowall 2000), and yet the pos- thatch larvae were immediately distinguishable by eye. the magnitude of interspecific differences in size and other fitness traits of larvae indicates the strength of the selection pressures imposed by the fecundity–egg size trade-off (smith & fretwell 1974; rollinson & hutchings 2013). these closely related species are showing fundamentally different strate- gies to optimise the survival of the critical early life stages. egg size and fecundity differences have major consequences for the types of habitats species can successfully occupy and thus creating opportunities for reproductive isolation and ultimately speciation (einum & fleming 2000). as the early life-histories of fish are such a critical stage in their survival (chambers & trippel 1997), selection pressures are likely to be intense during this period (einum & fleming 2000). hence, maternal provisioning to the egg may be a key process driving the evolution of novel fish species. galaxiid early life-history traits acknowledgements we would like to thank lance dorsey, manna warburton and kim garrett for field assistance. thank you to pete ravens- croft and daniel jack for sharing their knowledge of species’ spawning habits. matt wiley, sean divers and mark lokman gave invaluable advice on induction of ovulation. catriona hurd kindly allowed us to use her flow tank for larval swim- ming trials. thank you to murray mckenzie who built us an impeccable flume tank. rune knudsen gave helpful feedback on an earlier draft of the manuscript. this study was funded by the department of zoology (university of otago), and peter jones was supported by a university of otago doctoral scholarship. all work was conducted with approval from the animal ethics committee at the university of otago. references adams, m., raadik, t.a., burridge, c.p. & georges, a. 2014. global biodiversity assessment and hyper-cryptic spe- cies complexes: more than one species of elephant in the room?
