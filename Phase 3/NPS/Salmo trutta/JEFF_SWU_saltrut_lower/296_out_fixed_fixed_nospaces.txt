fishes from eight sites in the lower reaches of the river trent, england, between may and october 1999 inclusive, using a micromesh seine net. recruitment and growth patterns were observed via monthly length–frequency histograms and estimations of mean length. in the cases of roach and dace, growth was approximately linear through the summer, before declining in september and october. in the cases of chub and gudgeon, and to a lesser extent bream and bleak, however, there were suggestions of multiple recruitment events. it is argued that some of the fish species examined in the present study adopt fractional or protracted spawning strategies in the lower river trent. key words: recruitment; juvenile growth; fractional spawning; protracted spawning; cyprinid fishes correspondence: andy

attained in the ﬁrst few weeks after hatching, with the smaller, potentially weaker, ﬁsh least likely to survive (keast & eadie 1984; mills & mann 1985; mann & mills 1986; kubecˇ ka 1994; kirjasniemi & valtonen 1997). strong selective pressures must therefore exist for an effective growth strategy in young ﬁsh (keast & eadie 1984). although some ﬁsh species shed a single batch of eggs in a short spawning period, others are known to have a capacity to ripen successive batches of eggs within a season (fractional spawning) or spawn a single batch over an extended period (protracted spawning). spe- cies that adopt fractional or protracted spawning strategies are likely to have a greater size range of young at the end of the growing season than those that do not, as progeny from later spawnings have less time in which to grow before water tempera- tures decline in autumn than those from earlier spawning events. consequently, survival of the 74 ﬁsh from later spawnings (assuming size-depen- dent winter mortality [kirjasniemi & valtonen (1997)]), and their contribution to eventual year-class strengths, may largely be dependent upon environmental conditions during the winter. in the past, much work (e.g. hellawell 1972; mann 1976; hickley & bailey 1982; cowx 1988) has focused upon the growth of european fresh- water ﬁshes, but little attention appears to have been given to recruitment or growth patterns of the 0-group ﬁshes, particularly in large, lowland rivers. the present study examines the recruit- ment and growth patterns of six species of 0- group cyprinid ﬁshes in the lower river trent, england. the existence of fractional and pro- tracted spawning events in some of the ﬁsh species studied is investigated. materials and methods the study was carried out at eight sites (table 1) on the lower reaches of the river trent between thrumpton (ngr: sk 510,315), upstream of nottingham, and dunham (ngr: sk 820,745), recruitment of fishes table1. details of

al. fig. 2. length–frequency histograms for roach from the river trent. a river distance of approximately 65 km (fig. 1). sampling was restricted to the margins in water <1.5-m deep, where the water velocity was slow and 0-group ﬁshes tend to be aggregated (copp & garner 1995). fish populations were sampled at each site on a monthly basis, from may to october 1999 inclu- sive, using a micromesh seine net. the micromesh seine net used was 25-m long and 3-m deep with a 6-mm hexagonal mesh size, and was set in a semicircle from the bank using an inﬂatable din- ghy. the net was then ﬁshed to the bank in the usual manner for a beach seine and captured ﬁsh were transferred to large water-ﬁlled containers prior to analysis. all ﬁsh were, where possible, identiﬁed to species level and measured (standard length, near- est millimetre) in the ﬁeld. when identiﬁca- tion was not immediately possible, ﬁsh were preserved in 4% formalin and returned to the laboratory for analysis. species identiﬁcation from species-speciﬁc morphological and was meristic features (see wheeler 1978; pinder 2001). on occasions when excessively large num- bers of ﬁsh were caught, a random subsample of known percentage of the total catch was either measured in the ﬁeld or retained for analysis in the laboratory. recruitment and growth patterns were demon- strated by modal progression of size classes with 76 recruitment of fishes fig. 3. length–frequency histograms for dace from the river trent. time through the study period using length–fre- quency histograms, and by increases in mean standard length (mm sd) of 0-group ﬁsh over time. where there was evidence of multiple spawning events, separate mean lengths were cal- culated for each ‘batch’ after veriﬁcation of the separate modal distributions using bhattachar- ya’s method (sparre & venema 1992) in fisat (fao/iclarm stock assessment tools), and mean lengths of ﬁsh from each batch were com- pared using t-tests. results a total of 20 species of ﬁsh, plus hybrids of undetermined parentage, were captured during the study period. the main 0-group species cap- tured, and upon which analyses were based, were roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)), dace (leuciscus leucis- cus (l.)), chub (l. cephalus (l.)), bream (abra- mis brama (l.)), gudgeon (gobio gobio (l.)) and bleak (alburnus alburnus (l.)). owing to space restrictions and for clarity, the length–frequency histograms (figs 2–7) and plots of mean lengths (sd) (fig. 8) were restricted to two examples of each species. single spawning fish species recruitment of roach and dace appeared to be based on a single spawning event (figs 2 and 3). at all sites, mean standard lengths of both 0-group 77 nunn et al. fig. 4. length–frequency histograms for chub from the river trent. roach and dace increased through the study per- iod to a maximum in october, and growth was approximately linear (10–20 mm/month) through the summer before slowing in september and october (fig. 8). multiple spawning fish species overall mean standard lengths of 0-group chub did not exhibit a steady increase with time as observed for roach and dace. at many sites there was no deﬁnite trend in the length–frequency distributions that described the growth of discrete cohorts of 0-group chub (fig. 4). initial spawning appeared to take place in june, but large numbers of small (<25 mm standard length) 0-group chub continued to feature in catches at all sites into late summer (fig. 4). this was particularly evident in august and september, suggesting fractional spawning events may have occurred. where necessary, polymodal distributions were analysed using bhattacharya’s method (all separation indices >2). signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the mean lengths of 0-group chub from separate modal distributions (fig. 8). at attenborough, the mean standard length of 0-group bream increased through the study per- iod to a maximum in september (fig. 8), but showed a substantial drop in october, linked to the appearance of a large number of smaller 78 recruitment of fishes fig. 5. length–frequency histograms for bream from the river trent. individuals (fig. 5). no clear pattern of growth or recruitment was observed at dunham (fig. 5), and at other sites, 0-group bream were caught too infrequently and in too few numbers to reveal any trends between sampling periods. bhatta- charya’s method (separation index¼ 3.78) was used to analyse the length–frequency distribution at attenborough in october, and a signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.01) was found between the mean length of 0-group bream from the separate modal distributions (fig. 8). although at some sites, mean standard length of 0-group gudgeon increased steadily through the study period to a maximum in october, at others there was no deﬁnite trend in the length– frequency distributions that described the growth of discrete cohorts of 0-group ﬁsh (fig. 6). initial spawning appeared to be in june, but at all sites small (<25 mm standard length) 0-group gudgeon featured in catches in late summer, with an infu- sion of smaller individuals in september at many sites (fig. 6). signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.01) were found between the mean lengths of 0-group gud- geon from distinct modal distributions (fig. 8) which, where necessary, were separated usingbhat- tacharya’s method (all separation indices >2). at none of the sites did mean standard length of 0-group bleak increase steadily through the study period to a maximum in the autumn, although growth and recruitment patterns were difﬁcult to 79 nunn et al. fig. 6. length–frequency histograms for gudgeon from the river trent. discern largely because of small and infrequent catches (fig. 7). nonetheless, some evidence of recruitment was found in june and july, although the main recruitment period seemed to be in late august or september. the october length–fre- quency distribution at dunham was analysed using bhattacharya’s method (separation index¼ 4.14) and signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.01) were found between the mean lengths of 0-group bleak from separate modal distributions (fig. 8). discussion kubecˇ ka (1994) observed three main growth phases in 0-group ﬁsh from temperate latitudes: (1) accelerated growth after hatching; (2) approxi- mately linear growth over summer, when most of the ﬁrst-year growth is completed; and (3) decrea- sing juvenile growth associated with autumn. in the present study, the ﬁrst of these phases was not observed, probably as sampling was too infre- quent and as the seine net used was inefﬁcient at capturing ﬁsh <15 mm in length (cowx et al. 2001). notwithstanding, in the majority of cases growth was approximately linear through the summer and slowed by october. in some cases, however, there were suggestions of multiple recruitment events in the length–fre- quency distributions. polymodality and, indeed, apparently distinct size-classes were observed in the length–frequency distributions of some spe- cies, and september/october mean lengths were 80 recruitment of fishes fig. 7. length–frequency histograms for bleak from the river trent. sometimes smaller than in august/september. this was particularly evident with chub, gudgeon, bream and bleak. potential explanations for this include drift of small individuals from upstream (jurajda 1998; carter & reader 2000), active dis- persal of larger individuals away from the sam- pling areas, fractional/protracted spawning events (mackay & mann 1969; white & williams 1978; economou et al. 1991; vriese et al. 1994) or a com- bination of these factors. however, may catches revealedthe presenceof small(<30 mm)>0þ chub, gudgeon, bream and bleak. although the small size of these ﬁsh may simply have been a conse- quence of poor growth in the previous summer, small (<25 mm) the subsequent capture of 0-group individuals of these species throughout the study period suggests they were the offspring from the late summer spawnings which had less time to grow before water temperatures declined. chub and gudgeon, and to a lesser extent bream and bleak, appeared to exhibit fractional or protracted spawning, with batches being dis- charged possibly several months apart. dace shed a single batch of eggs in a 2–3-week spawning period (mann & mills 1986; mills 1991) and roach usually spawn once within a 2–4-day period (mackay & mann 1969). in contrast, chub are known to be capable of fractional spawning 81 nunn et al. fig. 8. monthly mean lengths of six spe- cies of 0-group cyprinids from the river trent (mean lengths (sd) plotted sepa- rately for each spawning – see text for details). (white & williams 1978; economou et al. 1991; vriese et al. 1994) whose eggs may be scattered in up to three spawnings (libosvarsky 1979). gametes from the anal end of both ovaries and testes have been shown to be the ﬁrst to ripen and be shed, compared to most other species in which the entire gonad ripens at one time (mann 1976). fractional spawning has also been reported in bleak (mackay & mann 1969) and gudgeon (mann 1980) which, in the former, has subse- quently been supported by evidence of up to four size groups of eggs in the ovary prior to spawning (barus & prokes 1996). similarly, bream are known to occasionally have a protracted spawn- ing period, particularly in suboptimum conditions (cowx 2001). in the case of bleak and gudgeon, fractional spawning is probably a consequence of their small body size which permits them to pro- duce only relatively small numbers of eggs per ﬁsh (see cowx 2001). it has been suggested that small ﬁsh compensate for this by extending the spawning period and producing successive batches of eggs (heins & bresnick 1975; gale & gale 1977; keast & eadie 1984). however, it may also be possible that younger (smaller) individuals of some species adopt alternative (perhaps fractional or protrac- ted) spawning strategies to older conspeciﬁcs. downstream drift of smaller 0-group indivi- duals, including from tributaries, may distort or even mask the existence of fractional/protracted spawning strategies. carter & reader (2000) sug- gested that drift of 0-group ﬁshes is probably part of a migratory cycle, and has the function of allowing movement from the spawning habitat to nursery areas. however, they (op. cit.) noted that drift of 0-group ﬁsh was mostly restricted to the ﬁrst few weeks of life, and this phenomenon does not explain the presence of small (<25 mm) 82 the individuals of certain species throughout summer. furthermore, the patterns observed for chub, bream, gudgeon and bleak were not observed for roach or dace. this can only be explained by the existence of fractional or pro- tracted spawning events. knowledge regarding fractional or protracted spawning events is, however, limited and should be supplemented by further, more detailed studies to assess the existence and signiﬁcance of any temporal (within and between years), spatial (within and between catchments) or ontogenetic (i.e. age/size related) variation in spawning stra- tegies adopted by ﬁsh species or populations. the overwinter survival of the smaller 0-group ﬁsh is largely stochastic (mills & mann 1985; mann & mills 1986; kubecˇ ka 1994; kirjasniemi & valto- nen 1997), particularly where the overwinter habi- tat may be limited, such as in the lower trent (harvey et al. 1999), primarily because of their inability to withstand elevated river ﬂows (mann & mills 1986; mann & bass 1997). however, subsequent surveys on the river trent and war- wickshire avon (nunn, cowx and harvey unpubl. data) have provided conclusive evidence that large numbers of offspring from late summer spawnings do survive the winter in some years. when this is the case, such ﬁsh may contribute substantially to year-class strengths and should be investigated further. ultimately, ﬁsheries man- agement could potentially be tailored to enhance the survival of such ﬁsh, and hence augment recruitment to older age classes. resumen 1. entre mayo y octubre del an˜ o 1999 (ambos inclusive), collectamos con redes de arrastre datos pesqueros de juve- niles 0þ de seis especies de ciprı´ nidos en ocho localidades de la region inferior del rı´ o trent (inglaterra). los patrones de crecimiento y reclutamiento fueron detectados analizando histogramas bi-mensuales de frecuencias de longitudes y estimando longitudes medias. 2. en los casos de rutilus rutilus y leuciscus leuciscus el crecimiento fue aproximadamente lineal a lo largo del verano, antes de declinar en septiembre y octubre. sin embargo, los datos sugirieron eventos de reclutamiento multiples en los casos de l. cephalus y gobio gobio y en menor medida, de abramis brama y alburnus alburnus. se argumenta que algunas de las especies de peces examinadas en este estudio adoptan estrategias de puesta fraccionadas en la region. acknowledgements the authors wish to thank r. noble, d. rollins and g. whitford for their assistance in the collection of ﬁeld
