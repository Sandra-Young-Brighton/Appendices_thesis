sexual selection; predation; competition; interference; promiscuity introduction the evolution of parental care is a central issue in evolutionary biology. whereas mammals are typically described by female-only care and birds by biparental care, teleost ﬁshes are mainly characterised by their diversity in patterns of parental care. in this taxon, absence of parental care prevails (78% of families; sargent & gross 1986). when parental care exists, it is often provided by males (11% of families) but biparental care and female-only care are also observed (4% and 7% of families, respectively). this diversity makes teleost ﬁshes, among other things, a useful group to explore the evolution of parental care. at the core of the theoretical corpus on the evolution of parental care is williams’ principle (williams 1966), according to which parental increases present reproductive success at the expense of future reproductive success. then, sex roles are determined by how ecological factors (predation risk, clustering of investment resources…), life history traits (relation between size and fecundity, itero- or semelparity…) and the mating system (operational sex ratio, parentage certainty…) affect present and future success in each sex. the situation gets more complicated as soon as one considers possible feedbacks between each component of the system. for instance, the marginal gain of one parent’s behaviour depends on the other parent’s behaviour, which advocates for a game theory approach (harrison et al. 2009). individual decisions on parental care also affect the mating system, by biasing the operational sex ratio towards the sex that does not care for the offspring (kokko & jennions 2008). parental care can also be sexually selected, lessening the trade-off between present investment and future reproductive success (e.g., lindstro¨m et al. 2006). among ﬁshes, salmonids belong to a minority, as only females are known to provide parental care. after having chosen a nesting site and dug the nest for correspondence : c. tentelier, uppa, umr ecobiop, ufr sciences et techniques de la coˆte basque, alle´e du parc montaury, 64600 anglet, france. e-mail: cedric.tentelier@univ-pau.fr 580 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00507.x between 3 h and 2 days (esteve 2005), females spawn with one or several males and care for the offspring by covering the eggs with substrate for about 30 min (de gaudemar & beall 1999). in paciﬁc salmon, females may also provide care by defending their nests against predators or superimposition by other females (foote 1990). from the salmonid male perspective, at least three factors are expected to select against paternal care. first, sexual selection is strong (heavy nonran- dom skew in male mating success; serbezov et al. 2010; weir et al. 2010), so the males who have managed to mate have good chances to succeed again and would be better off joining the competing pool as soon as possible rather than caring for their offspring, a generally costly behaviour (kokko & jennions 2008). second, females often have multiple mates, so the uncertainty in paternity is such that caring males run the risk of caring for their competitors’ offspring, which lowers the beneﬁts of care. third, maternal care, in the form of nesting site selection and egg burying, is usually very efﬁcient in preventing mortality (egg survival is very variable but can reach 100% in optimal habitats; malcolm et al. 2003; meyer 2003; dumas et al. 2007), so the additional beneﬁt obtained through male involvement in care would probably be too low to compensate for the costs in terms of lost mating opportunities. consistently and up to now, salmonid males have been thought to provide no paternal care and generally desert the nest quickly after spawning (de gaudemar & beall 1999), presumably to seek other females. this seemingly well-established absence of paternal care in salmonids may nevertheless be questioned by egg cannibalism, a behaviour once documented by greeley (1932) and then given little attention, despite illuminating attempts (maekawa & hino 1990; blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1999; garner et al. 2009). unlike the ﬁlial cannibalism commonly observed in species with obligate paternal care (manica 2002), this behaviour has been described as peripheral individuals (and occasionally dominant males) rushing into a nest just after the eggs have been laid and fertilised, digging the nest substrate with their snout and presumably causing high egg mortality through both direct ingestion and displacement from the substrate (aymes et al. 2010). aymes et al. (2010) showed that factors such as number of peripheral individuals increased the probability of cannibalism, but the effect of a potential defensive behaviour by the dominant male remains to be addressed. indeed, a male could beneﬁt greatly from defending his eggs against cannibals; because egg cannibalism occurs very soon after the time window during which paternal care should be provided is narrow (2 min, aymes et al. 2010), resulting in a small-time invest- ment for the father. moreover, if egg mortality was spawning, paternal care in brown_trout high because of cannibalism, the beneﬁt of defence could easily outweigh the cost. finally, because the female must cover the eggs immediately after having laid them, she cannot take the duty of active defence against potential cannibals. hence, the occurrence of egg cannibalism in salmonids could tip the scales in favour of paternal care in these species. in this study, we tested whether egg cannibalism promoted paternal care in brown_trout. for this, we used ﬁeld observations of brown_trout spawning to (i) describe males’ defence behaviour before and after egg fertilisation and (ii) correlate males’ defence behaviour to the probability of cannibalism on the clutches. methods data collection the data set used in this study was a subset of that used in aymes et al. (2010). it initially consisted of video sequences of 83 brown_trout spawning events shot during ﬁve spawning seasons (november to march of 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2006–2007, 2007– 2008 and 2008–2009). observations were made on the nive network, a river system draining a watershed of 990 km2 in southwest france. spawning events were ﬁlmed either from the bank or from underwater mainly during daytime (from 10 am to 7 pm). as mentioned by aymes et al. (2010), ﬁlial cannibalism (a dominant male eating the eggs he just fertilised) occurred in six of the 83 spawning events. because we were interested in how a dominant male’s behaviour could affect the probability of cannibalism by other individuals, we removed these six observations and only kept those either with no cannibalism (61 cases) or with hetero- cannibalism (16 cases). video analysis we analysed the 77 video sequences to estimate the number of potential predators around each spawning event, measure the size of the female and of the dominant male, quantify the male’s aggressive behav- iours and identify cases of egg cannibalism. the duration of each sequence was usually 30 min before spawning (except in 18 cases for which less time was available) and 5 min thereafter. egg cannibalism was deﬁned as at least one individual digging the nest with its snout, with its body in a nearly vertical position. the number of peripherals around the spawning event was deﬁned as the number of individuals interacting with the dominant male at least once during the 35 min of observation. among other individuals, the dominant male was easily identiﬁed as the individual spending the most time close to the female and chasing 581 tentelier et al. any other individuals approaching the nest. sometimes dominance could be taken over by another male during the 30 min preceding spawning. this was character- ised by another male taking the duty of chasing peripherals and courting the female. in that case, the behaviour of both the initial dominant male and the successor was recorded. female and dominant male sizes were estimated using rulers and bricks of known length arranged nearby on the streambed. precise measurements were taken using the image processing software imagej 1.37v (u.s. national institutes of health, bethesda, md, usa) on freeze frames. to quantify the defensive behaviour of each dom- inant male, we recorded the proportion of time he spent on the nest and the number of chases towards peripheral individuals. presence on the nest was deﬁned as the male staying less than one body length from the depression dug by the female to bury her eggs. chases towards peripherals were deﬁned as the dominant male swimming quickly in another individ- ual’s direction. presence on nest and chases were quantiﬁed over both 30 min before spawning, 5 min before spawning, 2 min after spawning and 5 min after spawning. the focus on the 5 min before spawning was motivated by the male’s behaviour just before spawning possibly being preponderant on the probability of cannibalism. the focus on the 2 min after spawning was motivated by aymes et al. (2010) ﬁnding that 95% of cannibalism events occurred within 2 min after the eggs had been laid, which suggests that this is the time window when the male can act on the occurrence of cannibalism. all behavioural analyses were performed using jwat- cher v1.0 (blumstein & daniel 2007). statistical analysis (iii) the female’s value), we used generalised linear models (glm) to test whether the defensive behaviour of dominant males before and after egg laying could be affected by (i) the number of peripheral individuals, (ii) female size (an indicator of the male’s dominance status, i.e., dominant during the whole observation, dominant before takeover (predecessor) or dominant after takeover (successor) and (iv) the number of males engaged in mating (an indicator of male’s paternity uncertainty; included only in the model of behaviour after egg laying). six models were built, one for each defensive behaviour (chase and presence on nest) for 30 min before, 5 min before and 2 min after spawning, respectively. models for the number of chases featured a quasi-poisson distribution and models for the time on nest featured a gaussian distribution. to test whether the behaviour of the dominant males affected egg cannibalism, we ﬁtted logistic models 582 with the probability of cannibalism as a dependent variable and chases and time on the nest as independent variables. when dominance was taken over, the sum of chases and time on nest of both males was used, reﬂecting the defensive investment of which the clutch beneﬁted. dominance takeover was included in the model as a single effect and an interaction with chases and time on the nest. the number of peripheral individuals also had to be included both as a single effect and interaction with chases and time on nest, given the strong effect it can have on egg cannibalism (aymes et al. 2010). three models were built, using the number of chases and time on nest for 30 min before, 5 min before and 2 min after spawning, respectively. for each of these these models, we used a stepwise selection by akaike’s information criterion to retain the most probable combination of explicative factors. no individual effect was included in the models, as in most cases, individual recognition was not possible. some males may have been observed on several occasions, but given the temporal and spatial variability of our observations, we think pseudoreplication should not affect our results strongly. all statistical analyses were performed with r (http://cran.r-project.org/). results males’ behaviour towards potential cannibals males stayed on the nest and chased peripherals both before and after spawning (fig. 1). absence of chase despite there being at least one peripheral was observed on one occasion before spawning, and on nine occasions after spawning. dominance in the 30 min preceding spawning was taken over on eight occasions. before spawning, males whose dominance has not been taken over spent 80% of their time on the nest and slightly increased their rate of chase as spawning approached. both presence on the nest and rate of chase decreased progressively after spawning. because dominance takeover consisted in the eviction of the ﬁrst dominant male and because takeover did not always occur at the same moment, the average presence on the nest and chases before spawning for ﬁrst dominant males decreased progressively until spawning. four males whose dominance had been taken over nevertheless came back to the nest after spawning (in which they were not involved), and one of them chased peripherals. conversely, successors increased both their presence and rate of chase before spawning and deserted progressively afterwards (fig. 1). before spawning, the number of chases by the dominant males increased with the number of periph- eral individuals, whereas the proportion of time spent on the nest decreased (table 1). none of these 1.5 (a) 1 s 0 3 / s e s a h c f o r e b m u n 0.5 0 1.5 1 0.5 0 1.5 1 0.5 0 (b) (c) ] 0 0 5 1 – , 0 0 8 1 – [ ] 0 0 2 1 – , 0 0 5 1 – [ towards peripheral fig. 1.

v2 = 36.579; p = 0.001), and did not increase the probability of egg cannibalism (table 2). discussion by using observations of brown_trout spawning in the wild, we documented males’ nest-guarding behaviour and linked it to the probability of their clutch being cannibalised. in particular, we showed that males kept chasing peripheral individuals even after the eggs had been laid and fertilised, and that this defensive behaviour was associated with low probability of egg cannibalism. in the following discussion, we propose that this behaviour should be considered as paternal care and may impact the evolution of brown_trout mating system. distinguishing paternal care from mate guarding prespawning aggression of peripherals by dominant salmonid males has been widely documented and interpreted as a mate-guarding behaviour (fleming 1996; fleming & reynolds 2004). our data indicate that the proportion of time spent by the dominant male on the nest before spawning was also negatively correlated to the probability of egg cannibalism. hence, the presence of the male on the nest before spawning could also be considered an anticipated paternal care, although this function might just be a by-product of mate guarding because peripheral individuals present both a threat of kleptogamy and egg cannibalism (blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1999). in this context, it is interesting to note that the number of chases before spawning did not affect the probability of cannibalism, indicating that this particular mate- guarding behaviour did not translate in subsequent offspring protection. although prespawning behaviour does not allow disentangling mate guarding from paternal care, our analysis of postspawning behaviour does so. so far, and despite greeley (1932) having mentioned that ‘male defense lasts only through early stages of egg covering’, not much attention has been paid to the male’s behaviour on the nest after spawning, even in studies addressing the question of egg cannibalism in other salmonids (maekawa & hino 1990; blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1999). we see at three possible explanations to this gap: (i) there must be a risk of cannibalism for paternal care to be expressed, and this risk was absent from most experimental setups in which mating behaviour has been studied so paternal care could not be observed and (ii) paternal care least paternal care in brown_trout table 2. analysis of deviance table for the generalised linear models testing how the probability of egg cannibalism was affected by the number of peripheral individuals, dominance takeover, multiple mating, number of chases performed by the dominant male and proportion of time spent by the dominant male on the nest. time period on which behaviour was considered 30 min before spawning 5 min before spawning 2 min after spawning deviance 15.786 0.064 8.62 3.53 independent variable number of peripherals (1) dominance takeover (2) chases (3) presence (4) 1 · 3 1 · 4 2 · 3 2 · 4 multiple mating null deviance ⁄ d.f. residual deviance ⁄ d.f. aic effect + ns + ) ) ns ns ns ni 62.226 ⁄ 58 37.346 ⁄ 54 47.346 deviance 16.249 6.776 0.349 0.086 4.612 3.008 6.928 effect + + + + ) ) ) ns ni 77.751 ⁄ 74 39.742 ⁄ 67 55.742 effect + + ) ns ns ns + ns ns 78.697 ⁄ 76 49.538 ⁄ 72 59.538 deviance 16.158 7.083 1.735 4.183 three models were adjusted, considering males’ behaviour 30 min before, 5 min before or 2 min after spawning, respectively. signs in the ‘effect’ columns indicate whether the variable had a positive or negative effect on the probability of cannibalism. values in the ‘deviance’ columns indicate the deviance associated with each variable in the ﬁnal models after aic-based stepwise model selection. bold font indicates that the variable explains a signiﬁcant proportion of deviance in the probability of cannibalism (p < 0.05 for the v2-test). ‘ns’ indicates that the variable was not selected in the ﬁnal model after aic-based stepwise model selection. ‘ni’ indicates that the variable was not included in the initial model. sample size (and hence degrees of freedom) differs between the three models because the number of observations available for each time period differed because of incomplete videos. that no one has our results indicate that involves behaviours similar to mate guarding so when it was observed, it was not interpreted as paternal care; (iii) absence of paternal care in salmonids is such a common belief thought about challenging it, making it a self-reinforcing paradigm. the number of chases performed by the dominant male immediately after spawning was negatively correlated to the probability of cannibalism, especially when dominance had not been taken over during the 30 min preceding spawn- ing. in brown_trout as in most animals with external fertilisation, sexual selection favours the males whose sperms contact eggs the earliest after laying, so multiple mating is always simultaneous with egg laying (foote et al. 1997; mjølnerød et al. 1998; taborsky 1998; fitzpatrick & liley 2008; our obser- vations). it is therefore highly improbable that chases after spawning aim at limiting multiple mating, because it would just be too late. also, because in brown_trout, the dominant male usually leaves the nest within 10 min after spawning (s. brinkert, unpub- lished data), it is again highly improbable that this postspawning aggressive behaviour aims at monopol- ising the female until her next oviposition, which usually occurs hours later (esteve 2005). thus, the chases performed by the dominant male after spawn- ing do qualify as paternal care rather than mate guarding. paternal care, natural and sexual selection from a theoretical point of view, paternal care has not been considered adaptive for salmonids, because its associated costs would be too high in terms of lost mating opportunities (fleming & reynolds 2004). these costs would outweigh the beneﬁts, especially when paternity is uncertain and when the female already cares for the eggs (kokko & jennions 2008). here though, egg cannibalism occurs so soon after spawning that the dominant male only has to invest a little time and a few chases to protect the eggs. moreover, eggs are very vulnerable during the ﬁrst minutes following spawning because they have not yet been covered by the female. hence, the paternal investment we observed may have a high marginal beneﬁt and should probably be favoured by natural selection. unfortunately, we and aymes et al. (2010) could not precisely quantify the damage made to the clutch by egg predators. this valuable quantiﬁcation seems very difﬁcult to obtain in natura, because it would imply estimating not only the number of eggs extracted from the nest (ingested and drifting), but also the probably high survival cost incurred by eggs remaining in a disturbed nest, which greeley (1932) anticipated as the major part of the total damage. one can also wonder how frequent egg cannibalism is at a large scale and whether is also quantitatively signiﬁcant in other salmonid species (maekawa & hino 1990; blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1999; garner et al. 2009). to our knowledge, the only study quantifying the ﬁtness cost of egg cannibalism is cunjak & therrien (1998), who showed in a single atlantic salmon population that up to 52% of 2 year old parrs had salmon eggs in their stomach, with on average 6.2 eggs per parr, lowering egg survival of 20%. if such high ﬁtness costs were incurred by it 585 tentelier et al. victims of cannibalism in other salmonid populations or species, one could expect paternal care to have evolved as a response to this selective pressure. a comparative approach among different populations and species would be a way to answer such questions. several contextual factors can affect the costs and beneﬁts of paternal care, and males might adjust their behaviour according to these factors. for instance, the risk of cannibalism may increase with the number of potential cannibals around the nest. hence, one could expect males to increase their level of defence when the threat increases (komdeur & kats 1999). on the other hand, when there are too many peripherals, the dominant male may be overwhelmed and reduce chasing (as observed by blanchﬁeld & ridgway 1999). this is what we observed for the per capita number of chases after spawning, which reached its maximum for two peripherals and was quite low when more peripherals were present. other factors may affect the beneﬁts of paternal care, such as the certainty of paternity (kokko & jennions 2008). because paternity certainty decreases with multiple mating, one could have expected lower levels of postspawning aggression after a multiple mating (but see alonzo 2010). this was not found in our data, as neither the number of chases after spawning nor the probability of cannibalism was affected by the occur- rence of multiple mating. on a broader scale, opera- tional sex ratio on the spawning ground determines the opportunity of future mating, so high proportion of females should lower the propensity of males to perform paternal care (sargent & gross 1986). unfortunately, we were not able to test this prediction as we did not estimate operational sex ratio as the scale of the spawning ground. finally, by showing that males’ defence behaviour after spawning was negatively related to the probabil- ity of egg cannibalism, our ﬁndings may challenge the common assumption that female salmonids obtain no direct beneﬁts from males (fleming & reynolds 2004). so far, in most studies of female mate choice in salmonids, direct beneﬁts have been promptly disqualiﬁed to justify the restriction of manipulative work to tests of indirect beneﬁts hypotheses, such as ‘good genes’ or ‘compatible genes’ (e.g., petersson et al. 1999; forsberg et al. 2007; jacob et al. 2007; petersson & jarvi 2007; wedekind et al. 2008). if females could somehow assess males’ ability to protect their eggs against cannibalism, paternal care would become a criterion for mate choice and be favoured by sexual selection. indeed, if a male’s behaviour can increase offspring survival, it would be adaptive both for the females to choose good fathers and for the males to advertise their ability to care for eggs. although these considerations remain specula- 586 tive, our results provide for the ﬁrst time a reasonable basis to consider the possibility for sexual selection on direct beneﬁts in salmonids.
