humboldt university excellence of initiative postdoc fellowship abstract fine- scale underwater telemetry affords an unprecedented opportunity to understand how aquatic animals respond to environmental changes. we investigated the move- ment patterns of an aquatic top predator, eurasian perch (perca fluviatilis), using a three- dimensional acoustic telemetry system installed in kleiner döllnsee (25 ha), a small, shallow, mesotrophic natural lake. adult piscivorous perch (n = 16) were tagged and tracked in the whole lake at a minimum of 9- s intervals over the course of one year. perch increased swimming activity with higher water temperature and light in- tensity. air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase also explained perch movements, but the effects were substantially smaller compared to temperature and light. perch showed a strong diel pattern in activity, with farther swimming distances and larger activity spaces during the daytime, compared to the night- time. to investigate the in- fluence of prey distribution, we sampled the prey fish in both littoral and pelagic zones in both day and night monthly using gill nets. we found that the prey fish underwent diel horizontal migration, using the littoral zone during the day and the pelagic zone during the night. however, perch showed the opposite patterns, suggesting either that the prey fish avoided predation risk or that the horizontal diel migration of perch was driven by other mechanisms. our results collectively suggest that the movement ecol- ogy of piscivorous perch is mainly governed by a foraging motivation as a function of abiotic variables, especially temperature and light. k e y w o r d s acoustic telemetry, barometric pressure, foraging, moon phase, predation risk, seasonality 1 |  introduction understanding environmental influences on animal movement pro- vides useful insight into ecological motivations that govern the move- ment (nathan et al., 2008). however, it is a challenge to observe individual movements of free- ranging fish at fine spatiotemporal scales under natural conditions. radio telemetry with manual tracking has *authors contributed equally to this paper. 798  |  historically constituted the dominant tracking method in freshwater environments (cooke & thorstad, 2012). however, manual tracking typically yields coarse information on fish positions due to long dura- tions of several hours, days or even weeks between positional fixes, which can severely underestimate swimming activity (rogers & white, 2007). in addition, manual tracking requires substantial time and effort to cover a large gradient of environmental variation that free- ranging fishes experience in the wild. recent advances in fine- scale acoustic telemetry offer promising solutions to study the movement of aquatic wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:798–812. © 2018 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdanimals in the wild with high spatiotemporal resolutions over long periods (furey, dance, & rooker, 2013; hussey et al., 2015; krause et al., 2013). when combined with concurrent assessment of abiotic variables, acoustic telemetry provides a unique opportunity to elu- cidate the environmental effects on movement patterns in the wild. considering that movement decisions affect individual fitness, pred- ator–prey interactions, population dynamics and nutrient dynamics (bolker, holyoak, křivan, rowe, & schmitz, 2003; palkovacs, kinnison, correa, dalton, & hendry, 2012; vindenes & langangen, 2015), iden- tifying the environmental factors driving movement in the wild is key to understand the underlying ecological motivations. among other abiotic environmental factors, temperature and light are known to exert strong influences on the behaviour of fish in the wild (brown, laland, & krause, 2011; craig, 1977; magnuson, crowder, & medvick, 1979). rising temperature increases food de- mand through elevated basal metabolism (brown, gillooly, allen, savage, & west, 2004; ohlberger, mehner, staaks, & hölker, 2012), and brighter light increases the ability to sense prey and be sensed by predators through enhanced underwater visibility (jacobsen, berg, baktoft, nilsson, & skov, 2014; nilsson et al., 2012; skov, nilsson, jacobsen, & brönmark, 2007). in addition, temperature and light can indirectly alter movement patterns of predators by influencing primary production and prey distribution (de kerckhove, blukacz- richards, shuter, cruz- font, & abrams, 2015). therefore, temperature and light comprise important abiotic factors that regulate movement of fish by mediating the trade- off between foraging and predation risk. empirical evidence suggests that fish also react to other abiotic environmental variables besides light and temperature in the wild. for example, a study on northern pike (esox lucius) found that forag- ing intensity, estimated as catch rates by angling, was significantly influenced by lunar phase and wind strength (kuparinen, klefoth, & arlinghaus, 2010). although the exact mechanisms are unclear, lunar phase is suggested to influence a range of biological phenomena through changes in electromagnetic fields (bevington, 2015). with regard to wind strength, a study in a large canadian lake showed that strong winds bring prey and predators close to each other in the pe- lagic zone (de kerckhove et al., 2015). further, studies have reported that barometric pressure influences the activity of some freshwater fish species (guy, neumann, & willis, 1992; markham, johnson, & petering, 1991). these observations suggest the potential for inde- pendent effects of abiotic variables other than temperature and light on fish movement in the wild. high- resolution acoustic telemetry at the ecosystem scales offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of abiotic environmental variables on fish activity and move- ments, as demonstrated in studies in estuaries (bacheler, paramore, buckel, & hightower, 2009; dance & rooker, 2015). eurasian perch (perca fluviatilis) is a freshwater fish that commonly occurs in temperate regions of eurasia. perch undergo characteristic ontogenetic niche shifts and become facultative piscivores as they grow (persson & greenberg, 1990). piscivorous perch are a widely dis- tributed top predator in the open- water zones of many european lakes (mehner, diekmann, bramick, & lemcke, 2005). perch actively chase prey fish in groups (eklöv, 1992) by moving around the ecosystem and     |  799 show no tendencies for homing (eklöv, 1997; jacobsen, berg, baktoft, & skov, 2015; jacobsen, berg, broberg, jepsen, & skov, 2002). as a visual predator, perch are reported to be more active during the day- time (craig, 1977; jacobsen et al., 2002; schleuter & eckmann, 2006) and show two activity peaks a day during the twilight in some lakes (jacobsen et al., 2015). a study using gill nets found that the swim- ming activity of perch positively correlated with water temperature, suggesting an elevated foraging activity as temperature increases (neuman, thoresson, & sandström, 1996). by contrast, a field study using manual tracking found surprisingly similar activity levels in win- ter and summer, suggesting that active foraging may continue at cold water temperature (jacobsen et al., 2015). here, we present the year- round diel and seasonal 3d move- ment and habitat use patterns of piscivorous perch and their re- sponses to the abiotic environment as well as prey fish distribution, using a state- of- art acoustic telemetry system covering a whole lake (baktoft et al., 2015). we hypothesised that water temperature reg- ulates the activity- related movement traits of perch because higher water temperature would elevate foraging activity to meet the en- ergetic demands (clarke & johnston, 1999). we also hypothesised that light intensity influences the activity- related movement traits nonlinearly, such that perch are most active when light intensity is intermediate, because strong light intensity could discourage perch from being active to avoid predation (turesson & brönmark, 2004). further, we explored the influences of other abiotic variables, such as air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase on movement traits of perch. in addition to abiotic variables, we conducted monthly sam- pling of prey fish to understand how movement patterns of perch were linked to the spatial and temporal distribution of prey. in a mesotrophic lake near the study lake, the key prey fish of perch (in particular, small roach, rutilus rutilus) show strong patterns of diel horizontal migration (dhm), using the littoral zone as refuge during the day and the pelagic zone for foraging on zooplankton during the night (schulze, dörner, hölker, & mehner, 2006). we hypothesised that the prey fish also show dhm in our study lake, thereby influ- encing the spatial distribution of piscivorous perch. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | study lake the study was conducted in kleiner döllnsee (25 ha, mean depth 4.1 m, maximum depth 7.8 m), a natural lake located in the north- eastern low- lands of germany (n 52°59′32.1″, e 13°34′46.5″). at the time of the study, the lake was mesotrophic to weakly eutrophic and characterised by intense submerged (primarily potamogeton spp.) and emergent (pri- marily phragmites and typha spp.) vegetation along the shore (table 1). the perch population is naturally reproducing and unexploited. other top predators in the lake are northern pike and european catfish (silurus glanis), of which the littoral- bound pike is by far more abundant. detailed characterisations of the study lake and its fish community can be found elsewhere (baktoft et al., 2015; klefoth, kobler, & arlinghaus, 2008; kobler, klefoth, mehner, & arlinghaus, 2009). nakayama et al.800  |     table 1 environmental variables of the study lake (kleiner döllnsee) in 2010 variable area maximum depth mean depth emergent macrophyte coverage submerged macrophyte coverage mean total phosphorus mean chlorophyll a mean secchi depth stratified (monomictic) value 25 ha 7.8 m 4.1 m 20% 50% 29 μg/l 9.9 μg/l 3.2 m yes the lake is installed with a wireless 3d automatic telemetry system consisting of 20 submerged hydrophones (whs 3050; 200 khz; lotek wireless inc., newmarket, on, canada). the sys- tem’s functionality is based on transmitters emitting acoustic sig- nals that are registered by a network of hydrophones positioned at precisely known locations in the lake approximately 1.5 m below the water surface (baktoft et al., 2015). positions of fish are cal- culated using hyperbolic triangulation based on the differences in arrival time of the transmitter signals at the receivers (baktoft et al., 2015; niezgoda, benfield, sisak, & anson, 2002). the map system (lotek wireless inc.) installed in kleiner döllnee is based on a code- division- multiple- access (cdma) encoding scheme, which allows several hundred individual transmitters to be tracked at the same time without code collision (niezgoda et al., 2002). 2.2 | fish sampling and tracking piscivorous perch were collected using two different sampling methods, gill netting (n = 10; 355 ± 33 mm tl, mean ± standard deviation) and angling (n = 10; 356 ± 23 mm), to maximise behavioural variation in the sample (biro & dingemanse, 2009). gill netting was conducted on 25 september 2010 in the open pelagic zone. gill nets were set for 1 hr dur- ing the afternoon to minimise stress on the fish. immediately after capture, perch were placed in large plastic tanks (80 l) filled with fresh lake water. angling was conducted between 23 september 2010 and 11 november 2010 across the lake using soft plastic shad lures. after capture, perch were placed in a boat’s live well and quickly brought to the shore. following hühn, klefoth, pagel, zajicek, and arlinghaus (2014), the fish were anaesthetised, and total length (mm) and wet mass (g) were recorded (table 2). then, an ultrasonic transmitter was implanted into the body cavity of each individual, and the sex was identified through the incision. we used combined acous- tic–radio transmitters (cart) with integrated temperature and pressure/depth sensors (type ch- tp- 11- 25; lotek wireless inc.). the transmitter (diameter 11 mm, length 65 mm, weight in water 5.9 g) was programmed to emit an acoustic signal at 9- s intervals to detect the location, except that every third signal was replaced with a radio signal. the radio signal contained data on depth (measurement error of 6 cm in standard deviation) and tempera- ture. we selectively tagged only large individuals (> 30 cm tl) to reduce tag burden, thereby minimising potential influences of a transmitter on behaviour (winter, 1996). this decision resulted in a strongly female- biased sample given the sex- dimorphic growth in perch (le cren, 1958). the calculated tag burden was 0.9 ± 0.3% (mean ± standard deviation), below a threshold of 2% often used in telemetry (winter, 1996). the calculated battery life was 323 days, with warranted battery life of 259 days. after full recovery in tanks with aerated fresh lake water (up to 30 min), fish were released back into the lake. tracking was conducted from 23 september 2010 to 21 september 2011. the positions of each fish were calculated using manufacturer- supplied software (alps v2.30; lotek wireless inc.). the positions were further smoothed using a hidden markov model with t- distributed detection errors to correct abnormally large jumps in position, which yielded low position errors with an accu- racy of 3.1 m and a precision of 1.1 m (baktoft et al., 2015). we discarded four individuals from the analysis (table 2) due to the malfunction of the transmitter (two fish) and death immediately after the release (two fish). fish used in analyses (n = 16) were all females of comparable sizes (321—394 mm; 359 ± 25 mm, mean ± standard deviation). we obtained over 12 million effective posi- tions of these 16 individuals (40% yield of the maximum possible positions). 2.3 | estimation of movement traits to summarise movement traits of perch, we estimated (i) distance travelled, (ii) activity space, (iii) mean distance from shore and (iv) mean water depth, both at daily and hourly temporal scales. distance trav- elled (km) was estimated for each individual as the sum of the distances between two consecutive positions in each hour. following baktoft et al. (2012), hours with <80 observations (i.e., >45- s intervals among positions on average) were excluded from the analysis because low de- tections could underestimate the total distance when fish do not swim straight. consequently, 5.3% of the total of 12 million positions were not used in the analysis on the distance travelled. daily swimming dis- tance (km) was estimated from hourly swimming distances shown on any given day. the activity space (ha) was estimated as a 95% kernel utilisation distribution area from all observed positions for each fish, both hourly and daily, using the package “adehabitathr” version 0.4.11 (calenge, 2006) in r (r core team, 2014). distance from shore (m) and mean fish depth (m) were averaged by hour and by day using all ob- served positions for each individual fish. all detections were used in the analyses on the activity space, mean distance from shore and mean water depth. 2.4 | abiotic environment variables to explore the possible effects of

lake. water temperature was recorded every 15 min using an underwater probe moored at a water depth of 1.5 m close to the deepest point of the lake (ysi 6600, ysi corporation, yellow springs, oh, usa). additionally, we measured water temperature vertically at every 10 cm to characterise the thermocline. the measurement was conducted every 1–4 weeks at the deepest point of the lake (7.8 m). light intensity was recorded every 10 min 1 m above the water surface and close to the shore, using an automatic meteorologi- cal station equipped with an external pyranometer (ecotech meteo multisensory, ecotech, bonn, germany). water temperature and light intensity were averaged over each hour. hourly mean air pressure, hourly mean wind speed and hourly total precipitation were obtained from a weather station located 28 km east of the lake (deutscher wetterdienst angermünde, http://www.dwd.de). daily mean water temperature, light intensity, air pressure and wind speed were ob- tained by averaging hourly mean values each day, and daily precipi- tation was obtained by summing hourly values each day (figure 1). lunar phase (θ) was expressed as an angular measure, with −π and π corresponding to the new moon and 0 to the full moon, determined by a standard moon calendar (www.timeanddate.com). there were missing data for hourly water temperature and light in- tensities before the installation of the sensors (23 september 2010–16 december 2010) and due to the malfunction of the sensors (5 april 2011–8 october 2011 for water temperature). the missing data amounted to 73.1% of hourly water temperature and 44.5% of hourly light intensity at the study lake during the tracking period. we predicted nakayama et al.802  |     ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w ) 2 / m w

all mesh sizes) were placed in the pelagic zone to encompass the surface to 6 m in depth (in total 317 m² gill net area), and three benthic nets were placed in the littoral zone at the outer edge of the reed belts (293 m² total fishing area). we collected 13 samples for each of the six sites at random lo- cations in the lake (three sites in the pelagic zone, three sites in the lit- toral zone) at approximately monthly intervals (may 2010–may 2011). these nets caught prey up to 25 cm in total length (kobler et al., 2009), but we confined the analysis to fishes below 20 cm, assum- ing a maximum victim- to- predator ratio of 0.45 for perch (persson, de roos, & bertolo, 2004). we recorded species, total length (mm) and wet mass (g) of catch per multimesh net and calculated catch per unit

quadratic term of light intensity. we used orthogonal polynomials of light intensity in the models, so that the inclusion of the quad- ratic term did not influence the parameter estimation of the linear term. lunar phase (θ) was included as cos θ and sin θ in the model. daily swimming distance and activity space were log- transformed to improve model fit, and the temporal autocorrelation was alle- viated by including the first- order autoregressive process. model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation in r package “nlme” version 3.1- 177 (pinheiro, bates, debroy, & sarkar, 2014). the importance of the variables was investigated using multimodel inference to improve parameter estimation while alleviating multicol- linearity (burnham & anderson, 2002). first, we fitted the models with all possible combinations of the independent variables and se- lected a confidence set that comprised the candidate models using akaike information criterion with a correction for finite sample sizes (aicc). the confidence set was selected to include all models with δaicc < 6 (burnham & anderson, 2002). when models were nested within higher- level models and had lower aicc than the higher- level models, we removed the higher- level models from a confidence set to avoid false inference on parameter estimation (richards, 2008). then, the coefficients were averaged for each variable over the confidence model set weighted by the model probability (burnham & anderson, 2002; grueber, nakagawa, laws, & jamieson, 2011). in the same way, we fitted the models with the standardised independent variables to make the coefficients comparable to one another. standardisation was performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the stan- dard deviation, so that each

resented a predicted response at each hour over the tracking period. nakayama et al.804  |     30 25 20 15 10 5 0 20 15 10 5 0 150 100 50 oct nov dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec

found in the oxygenated zone above the summer ther- mocline (figure 2). in general, across all four seasons, perch more heavily used the sublittoral zone around the lake, while the central parts of the pelagic zone received rare or no use at all (figure 3). 3.2 | daily movement patterns in relation to environmental variables the models explained influences of several abiotic environmental variables on daily movement patterns (table 3). particularly, perch travelled farther distances as water temperature increased (figure 4a). they also travelled farther distances as light intensity increased, but the distance levelled off when light intensity was very high (figure 4a). distance travelled by perch decreased as air pressure and wind speed increased, and around the full moon (figure 4a). although model av- eraging retained the sine of lunar phase, it did not significantly predict the distance travelled (0.046 [95% ci: −0.022, 0.115]). perch ex- panded the activity space as water temperature increased (figure 4b). model averaging retained temperature and body size, but body size did not significantly predict the activity space (0.211 [−0.312, 0.735]). perch moved closer to the shore when light intensity was medium and farther from the shore when light intensity was low and high (figure 4c). perch also moved closer to the shore when air pressure and wind speed increased (figure 4c). although model averaging retained a linear term of light intensity, it did not significantly predict the dis- tance from shore (0.211 [−0.312, 0.735]). perch used shallower water as water temperature increased and air pressure decreased (figure 4d). the fish used deeper water from the full moon to the third quarter phase (figure 4d). the depth chosen by the fish was explained by light intensity, with shallower water chosen at medium light intensity and deeper water at low or high light intensity (figure 4d). although model averaging retained wind speed and a linear term of light intensity, both variables did not significantly predict the depth used by perch (−0.022 [−0.054, 0.009] and 0.008 [−0.051, 0.067] respectively). 3.3 | diel movement patterns all hourly movement traits were significantly explained by the ten- sor product smooth of hour of the day and day of the year (p < .001 in all cases, figure 5). the models explained 32.1% of deviance for hourly swimming distance, 54.1% for depth, 38.3% for activity area and 20.5% for distance from shore. synchronised with the sunrise and the sunset, the hourly distance travelled showed a distinct diel pattern, with longer distance trav- elled during the day and shorter distance during the night (figure 5a). perch showed a single activity peak approximately 3 hr after sunrise in june and july (figure 5a). in other periods, the hourly distance trav- elled showed a single peak around noon. the hourly distance travelled during the night- time in summer was comparable with that during the daytime in winter. the hourly activity space showed a trend very sim- ilar to the hourly distance travelled, with a low activity space during the night- time, a high activity space during the daytime, and a single     |  807 peak in the morning in summer (figure 5b). the hourly mean distance from shore showed a diel pattern where perch stayed farther from shore during the daytime and closer to the shore during the night- time. the diel pattern was less distinct during the spawning period in march (figure 5c). the hourly mean depth use showed no distinct diel patterns but strong seasonality, as perch used deeper water in winter compared to in summer (figure 5d). 3.4 | diel horizontal migration of prey fish prey abundance during the daytime was estimated as 0.38 fish/m2/h [95% ci: 0.18, 0.71] in the littoral zone and 0.10 fish/m2/h [0.05, 0.18] in the pelagic zone. during the night- time, abundance was 0.38 fish/ m2/h [0.18, 0.67] in the littoral zone and 0.24 fish/m2/h [0.12, 0.41] in the pelagic zone. prey biomass during the daytime was 7.0 g/m2/h [3.6, 11.6] in the littoral zone and 2.8 g/m2/h [1.4, 4.9] in the pelagic zone. during the night- time, the values were 6.7 g/m2/h [3.5, 10.7] in the littoral zone and 3.9 g/m2/h [2.0, 6.5] in the pelagic zone. the models showed significant interactions between habitat type and time period in relation to cpue, both for abundance and biomass (figure 6). inclusion of the interaction term significantly improved the model fits both in prey abundance (χ 1 = 5.72, p = .017). the results indicated the presence of dhm, with prey fish mi- grating from pelagic zone to littoral zone during the daytime, and in the opposite direction during the night- time. there was no difference in the proportion of prey fish occurrence between day and night (0.90 [0.77, 1 = 1.59, p = .207) or between littoral and 0.98] vs. 0.95 [0.86, 0.99]; χ pelagic zones (0.94 [0.84, 0.99] vs. 0.91 [0.79, 0.98]; χ 1 = 0.57, p = .450). 1 = 15.18, p < .001) and biomass (χ 2 2 2 2 4 |  discussion by combining fine- scale, long- term positional data at the ecosystem scale with concurrent environmental information, we illustrated the detailed movement of free- ranging piscivorous perch in response to en- vironmental changes at the population level. our results show that tem- perature and light exert strong influences on the movement of perch. however, movement was also influenced by other environmental fac- tors, such as air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase. surprisingly for a visual predator, we also found that perch stay active during the night- time in summer, with their swimming activity comparable with that dur- ing the daytime in winter. perch showed the diel horizontal migration patterns in the opposite way of their prey fish, by staying farther from the shore during the daytime and closer during the night- time. our re- sults partly confirm other studies on perch movement in the wild col- lected with less detailed methods, while revealing some interesting and novel patterns not previously documented for this species. 4.1 | effects of the abiotic environment on perch movement in agreement with our hypothesis, the movement of piscivorous perch in the study lake was strongly explained by water temperature nakayama et al.808  |     and light. specifically, we found that perch increased their swimming activity at higher temperature and under brighter conditions, the latter in a nonlinear way. through altering physiological processes and prey distributions (brown et al., 2004; hinch & rand, 1998; magnuson et al., 1979), temperature influences various behaviours, such as swimming intensity (alabaster & stott, 1978; neuman et al., 1996), foraging rates (kitchell, stewart, & weininger, 1977; neuman et al., 1996), escape ability of prey (wilson, lefrancois, domenici, & johnston, 2010) and timing of migration and spawning (mckinzie, jarvis, & lowe, 2014). it is likely that perch increased the swim- ming activity at higher temperature to meet the elevated demand for food, considering that higher swimming activity increases prey encounter rates (turesson & brönmark, 2004, 2007). it is also pos- sible that the swimming activity increased in warmer water through higher activity of prey fish (jacobsen, berg, jepsen, & skov, 2004; jepsen & berg, 2002) and higher intraspecific competition for food (ohlberger et al., 2012). in addition, swimming activity was strongly elevated before and during the spawning period, suggesting that the swimming activity is related to finding spawning places and mates. the movement change in response to light is also likely to re- flect foraging behaviour, considering that perch become more effi- cient at finding and consuming food as visibility increases (jacobsen et al., 2014). notably, perch stayed surprisingly active during the night- time in summer, which was comparable to the activity during the daytime in winter. considering that perch can hunt even at low light levels (jacobsen et al., 2014), it is likely that perch continue to forage during the night- time in summer, possibly to maintain high foraging rates in the warm summer period. the relationship between light intensity and swimming distance was nonlinear, with swimming distance levelling off under very bright conditions. it is unlikely that the reduction in swimming distance under very bright conditions is related to predator avoidance, considering that the abundance of large predatory fishes, such as large pike and european catfish, is low in the study lake (pagel, 2009). in addition, avian predators such as cormorants (phalacrocorax spp.) are rarely observed in the study lake (pagel, 2009). rather, it is more plausible that the piscivorous perch experience increased difficulties in forag- ing under very bright conditions, as both the alertness of prey fishes and their ability to evade approaching predators increases (pitcher & turner, 1986). if this is the case, maintaining high swimming distance at very bright light may be energetically costly. other abiotic variables besides temperature and light also ex- plained some of the movement patterns and habitat choice ex- hibited by perch, although the effects were substantially smaller compared to the two key abiotic factors. with increasing baro- metric pressure, perch decreased swimming distance and moved deeper and closer to the shore. furthermore, barometric pressure influenced horizontal and vertical habitat usage. behavioural re- sponse to barometric pressure could constitute an evolutionary adaptation to predictable environmental changes related to baro- metric pressure. for example, blacktip sharks (carcharhinus lim- batus) are reported to respond strongly to changes in air pressure associated with a nearing storm by moving offshore into safer areas (heupel, simpfendorfer, & hueter, 2003). we also found that perch responded to stronger wind by reducing swimming distance and activity area and moving closer the shore. it is possible that wind- influenced movement of perch by affecting the accessibility of prey fish (de kerckhove et al., 2015). for example, strong wind can in- crease the efficiency of foraging littoral prey by causing water tur- bulence and distraction (jacobsen et al., 2014). in addition, perch increased swimming activity and the use of shallower water as the moon was waning from full moon. this could simply be a compen- satory response to a declining visibility. a previous study in the same study lake indicates that northern pike would show a higher foraging activity under stronger wind and on full and new moon, supported by higher catch rates by angling under these conditions (kuparinen et al., 2010). further study is needed to clarify effects of these abiotic factors on perch behaviour. 4.2 | foraging motivation or predation risk? the diel activity patterns are generally governed by a trade- off be- tween the access to prey and the risk of predation (werner & hall, 1988; werner & mittelbach, 1981). in agreement with other studies on perch (craig, 1977; jacobsen et al., 2002; jacobsen et al., 2015), our results confirmed that perch use sunrise and sunset as a zeitgeber, with elevated activity during the daytime compared to the night- time. although studies on perch have reported two peaks of swimming ac- tivity at dusk and dawn (jacobsen et al., 2015; neuman et al., 1996), we were unable to find those peaks. activity peaks during these peri- ods are arguably indicative of predator–prey interactions, with preda- tors taking advantage of greater foraging success during these periods (pitcher & turner, 1986). in our study lake, northern pike, one of the potential predators of perch, show activity peaks during these peri- ods, which corresponds with the elevated catch rate by angling during dawn and dusk (kobler, klefoth, wolter, fredrich, & arlinghaus, 2008; kuparinen et al., 2010). hence, if perch were under the risk of preda- tion by pike, one would expect activity minima during dawn and dusk periods; however, this was not the case. therefore, it is more likely that the increased activity of perch during sunrise indicates foraging activity and not predator avoidance. diel activity patterns of perch could also arise from variation in turbidity in different ecosystems. jacobsen et al. (2015) reported that perch showed strong activity peaks during crepuscular periods in a clear mesotrophic lake, whereas little diel activity patterns were found in a turbid shallow lake. the authors discussed that the absence of diurnal activity peaks in the turbid lake was likely related to a lower risk of predation, coupled with a more uniform distribution of prey. our study lake has a water visibility comparable to the clear mesotrophic lake studied by jacobsen et al. (2015), but we were not able to find activity peaks during crepuscular periods. further, we did not find an activity minimum during the day, when perch are most likely to be de- tected by visual predators, suggesting that the perch in our study lake perceived a low risk of predation. considering that the comparatively clear water of our study lake would not provide a turbidity- caused ref- uge effect against predators, it is likely that the diel activity patterns nakayama et al.of perch in our study lake were mainly caused by foraging and less by predator avoidance. further, lack of significant relationships between body size and the behavioural responses to light also indicates a low perceived risk of predation, considering that predation risk generally decreases with body size in fishes (lorenzen, 2000). yet, the dhm patterns shown by perch in the study lake leave the possibility that perch might still experience some level of predation risk. our results show that perch stayed farther offshore during the daytime and moved closer to the shore during the night- time. in the study lake, pike preferentially reside in the littoral zone (kobler et al., 2009) and tend to forage more intensively during twilight (kobler et al., 2008). european catfish, another potential predator of perch in the study lake, reside in the sublittoral and benthic areas of the open- water zone and tend to be most active at night (chéret et al. unpub- lished data). thus, the horizontal movements by perch could be to avoid day- active pike in the littoral zone and night- active catfish in the sublittoral and pelagic zones. if so, it is possible that the dhm patterns shown by perch are to minimise the risk of predatory attacks, rather than to maximise foraging. 4.3 | activity in the wild piscivorous perch in the study lake travelled on average over 6 km per day—a distance much greater than previously reported for this species (baktoft et al., 2016; jacobsen et al., 2002; jacobsen et al., 2015). in lake engelsholm in denmark, for example, perch were reported to swim approximately 1 km/day (jacobsen et al., 2015). the discrepancy could arise from differences in lake characteristics. although compa- rable in visibility, lake engelsholm is more eutrophic than our study lake (mean total phosphorus 50 μg/l, compared to about 30 μg/l in our study lake). therefore, lake engelsholm may offer a higher abun- dance of prey and/or potential predators of perch, which could re- duce the activity of perch to achieve a sufficient prey intake while minimising predation risk. alternatively, the discrepancy could arise from different sampling methods. while jacobsen et al. (2015) used manual tracking of radio- tagged perch at coarse intervals of 2.5 h be- tween fixes over a few days, the present study employed acoustic tags tracked at several fixes per minute over the course of approximately one year. because coarse tracking is known to severely underestimate actual swimming distances (hanson et al., 2007; rogers & white, 2007), our results underscore the utility of high- resolution tracking to illustrate the detailed nature of free- ranging fish. we tagged only large perch to reduce tag burden (winter, 1996), and accordingly, all individuals used in the analyses were females, due to a higher growth rate in female perch (le cren, 1958). differences in movement traits between sexes are documented in some species. for example, a mark–recapture study in round goby (neogobius melanos- tomus) reports longer swimming distance in males (marentette et al., 2011), whereas a study in sablefish (anoplopoma fimbria) reports the opposite trend (morita, morita, & nishimura, 2012). although there is no study in perch with regard to sex differences in movement, a higher growth rate in female perch (le cren, 1958) suggests the possibility, considering the positive correlation between growth rate and activity     |  809 found in some animals (biro & stamps, 2008). indeed, an angling study on perch showed sex differences in capture rates, indicating potential differences in foraging activity between sexes (heermann et al., 2013). further study is needed to clarify whether perch show sex- or growth- specific differences in movement. 5 |  conclusions the movement ecology of perch seems to be mainly driven by the struggle for fulfilling foraging demands in the light of seasonally vary- ing prey abundance and distribution (heermann et al., 2013) while accounting for prey activity, visibility and accessibility. our results suggest that changes in abiotic environments moderate foraging be- haviour of a top aquatic predator, potentially altering the strength of intraspecific competition for food. the recent increase in lake tem- perature at a global level (verhoeven, arheimer, yin, & hefting, 2006) may intensify foraging activity of perch and exert top- down effects in the food web (ohlberger et al., 2012). the elevated activity with ris- ing temperature may also increase encounter rates with fishing gears, and consequently, vulnerability to fishing (monk & arlinghaus, 2017). understanding interactions between organisms and their en- vironment lays the foundation for ecology and evolution. when coupled with environmental data, high- resolution telemetry af- fords an opportunity to re- evaluate our current knowledge about the behaviour of free- ranging fishes in the wild and offer new in- sights. high- resolution telemetry has been applied in many research fields, such as animal personality in the wild (harrison et al., 2015; nakayama, laskowski, klefoth, & arlinghaus, 2016; taylor & cooke, 2014) and correlations between movement and life history traits (nakayama, rapp, & arlinghaus, 2017). these efforts promise to ad- vance the field of movement ecology and its applications to fisheries and conservation. acknowledgements we would like to thank the editor and four anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that improved our manuscript. we would also like to thank andreas mühlbradt, alexander türck, jan hallermann and many other technicians, students and assistants for processing and managing the data. this study was financially supported by the humboldt university excellence initiative postdoc fellowship to sn and the leibniz community (“b- types”, saw- 2013- igb- 2 grant to ra). conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest. ethics the experiment was conducted under the approval by state office of environment, health and consumer protection in brandenburg, germany (protocol number 23- 2347- 15- 2010). nakayama et al.810  |     orcid shinnosuke nakayama http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1048-1202 references alabaster, j. s., & stott, b.
