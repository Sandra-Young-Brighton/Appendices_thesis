however, took longer to successfully pass. manipulation of creek chub release locations was used to separate issues of attraction and passage and revealed that passage efﬁciency was highest (76.2%) for those released within the ﬁshway and intermediate for those released at the entrance (42.1%). this multispecies ﬁshway improved stream connectivity, but additional work is needed to ﬁne tune its conﬁguration. similar projects that engage stakeholders in nature-like ﬁshway construction are a promising approach for the thousands of small dams that occur on low gradient streams around the globe, but those studies should incorporate a biological evaluation to ensure that attraction and passage efﬁciency are optimised. key words: ﬁshway; pit; ﬁsh passage; migration introduction the threats facing rivers and their associated biodi- versity can be broadly classiﬁed as habitat degrada- tion, water pollution, invasive species, barriers (dams, weirs, etc.), ﬂow modiﬁcation and overexploitation (malmqvist & rundle 2002; dudgeon et al. 2006). broad scale environmental changes such as nitrogen deposition, warming and shifts in precipitation and runoff patterns are further superimposed upon all of those threat categories (v€or€osmarty et al. 2010). the underlying driver for all of these threats is human activity. collectively, changes in environmental con- ditions, habitat or ability to access habitats either lat- erally (e.g., ﬂoodplain pools) or longitudinally (e.g., upstream/downstream migrations) due to reductions in connectivity can have devastating consequences on ﬁsh populations (richter et al. 1997) and the ecologi- cal services that they provide (holmlund & hammer 1999). given that longitudinal connectivity is critical for most ﬂuvial ﬁsh (rosenberg et al. 2000), there have been many efforts devoted to developing ﬁsh- way structures to facilitate passage of ﬁsh at barriers (lucas & baras 2001). early ﬁshways were heavily engineered and typi- cally constructed from concrete and metal, and have correspondence: j. d. thiem, fish ecology and conservation physiology laboratory, department of biology, carleton university, 1125 colonel by drive, ottawa, on, k1s 5b6, canada. e-mail: jdthiem@gmail.com 374 doi: 10.1111/eff.12032 become increasingly sophisticated in their design (lucas & baras 2001; roscoe & hinch 2010; makra- kis et al. 2011). of late, nature-like ﬁshways are becoming a popular ﬁshway design, especially for low head dams. these ﬁshways adopt a design phi- losophy known as physiomimesis, which is ecologi- cally minded and aims to mimic natural river systems (wildman et al. 2003). the majority of these designs are aesthetically pleasing and are also relatively inex- pensive to construct, reasonable to maintain and are suitable for a variety of species. local geology and height of the barrier tend to dictate the level of com- plexity and expense, with extensive land acquisitions typically needed for higher barriers. compared to larger engineered structures which are typically designed for one to two ﬁsh species, nature-like ﬁsh- ways are intended to pass entire ﬁsh communities. this type of ﬁshway design has been implemented across europe, australia and japan (wildman et al. 2003). nature-like ﬁshways are also becoming recog- nised as an alternative means of ﬁsh passage in can- ada and the united states. although ﬁshways are frequently installed at barri- ers, there is a general assumption that they work and they are rarely the subject of biological assessment (roscoe & hinch 2010). when assessments do occur, they are often based solely on documenting ﬁsh that are captured in traps at the top of the ﬁshway (ros- coe & hinch 2010). however, that approach fails to identify how many ﬁsh were unable to ﬁnd the entrance to the ﬁshway (i.e., attraction efﬁciency) and how many that did enter, but failed to fully ascend the ﬁshway (i.e., passage efﬁciency). both of these metrics are required to fully assess the biological effectiveness of a ﬁshway at passing target species (bunt et al. 2012; noonan et al. 2012). furthermore, there have been few biological assessments that address multiple species in north america as most are focused on coldwater ﬁsh such as salmonids (roscoe & hinch 2010). moreover, few studies examine problems on small streams, despite the fact that nature-like ﬁshways have the potential to restore passage to the many thousands of small streams blocked by low head dams. rosenberg et al. (2000) estimated that the number of small dams in north america outweigh the number of large dams 20 to 1, with an estimated 800,000 small dams/barriers around the world. here, we present a biological evaluation of the indian creek nature-like ﬁshway, located in south- eastern ontario, canada. the ﬁshway was con- structed in 2006 using volunteer labour under the direction of the south nation river conservation authority. the objective of the project was to facili- tate ﬁsh passage around a small dam (11.1 m wide, 1.45 m high) that was originally built for sawmill multispecies evaluation of a nature-like ﬁshway operation (mancini & langlois-anderson 2006). because of the emphasis on engaging volunteers in ﬁshway construction, the ﬁshway cost approximately $15,000 to construct (mancini & langlois-anderson 2006), whereas larger engineered structures can cost upwards of millions of dollars. using the indian creek nature-like ﬁshway as a model, we conducted a biological evaluation to determine if such “low technology” and inexpensive ﬁsh passage designs could serve as a tool to restore passage at the thou- sands of barriers that exist on small streams around the world (bunt et al. 2012). our speciﬁc objective was to determine attraction and passage efﬁciency for a warmwater ﬁsh assemblage during the spring spawning migration period. given that most of the species that reside in the system are sufﬁciently small and of little direct economic value (i.e., not game- ﬁsh), they have not been the subject of previous elec- tronic tagging studies to determine movement in a reliable manner. as such, it is not possible to derive reasonable species-speciﬁc hypotheses or predictions. however, all of the species in the system are spring spawners and are known to be rheotactic (scott & crossman 1973; bunt et al. 2001). in indian creek, suitable spawning habitat for most species can be found throughout the system, but there is more ﬂuvial habitat upstream of the dam than downstream. more- over, the dam itself generates a lentic area that is <100 m in longitudinal length such that ﬁsh would not have to travel far from the dam to reach lotic habitats favoured by most of the species that reside in the system. materials and methods study site indian creek (44°48′22.45″n, 75°36′12.89″w) is a tributary of the south nation river and is located in south-eastern ontario, canada. the indian creek watershed drains an area of 41 km2, contributes 16.7% of the ﬂow to the spencerville subwatershed of the south nation river, and had a mean annual daily discharge of 3.06 m3s  1 in 2011 (mancini & langlois-anderson 2006; environment canada 2012). a small dam (11.1 m wide and 1.45 m high) is located approximately 3 km upstream from the conﬂuence between indian creek and the south nation river and effectively prevents upstream pas- sage of the entire ﬁsh community to approximately 85% of the indian creek. the indian creek ﬁshway was constructed in 2006 (fig. 1) and various species have been known to use the ﬁshway (based on electroﬁshing surveys) including brown bullhead (ameiurus nebulosus), white sucker and creek chub (langlois-anderson, unpublished data). the ﬁshway 375 steffensen et al. dam fishway entrance 2 3 b 4 5 c 1 a n 0 25 m flow 6 fishway fig. 1. indian creek and nature-like ﬁshway schematic, south-eastern ontario, canada. numbers (1 to 6) indicate pit antenna locations used to determine ﬁsh movements and letters (a, b and c) are representative of the different ﬁsh release sites (see methods). entrance is located approximately 70 m downstream from the dam face and the width of the entrance is 1.1 m at benthos. the ﬁshway is 116 m long and consists of pools and rifﬂes with an overall slope of 1.25% from the top of the notch to the point where the ﬁshway meets indian creek. there are seven pools (each 16.6 m long), and each one is 0.2 m higher than the previous (mancini & langlois-ander- son 2006). the rifﬂes were designed to create a water velocity of 0.8 ms  1, and were built using rocks 10– 20 cm in diameter (mancini & langlois-anderson 2006). the ﬁshway exit is located approximately 50 m from the dam. experimental design we used a passive integrated transponder (pit) antenna array consisting of six antennas to quantify ﬁshway attraction and passage efﬁciency at this site (fig. 1). this method is an effective, inexpensive method for tracking freshwater ﬁsh (castro-santos et al. 1996; gibbons & andrews 2004) and facili- tates continuous, remote monitoring of movements in streams. the pit antenna array was installed from 1 to 4 april 2011. pass over antennas were installed at the ﬁshway entrance (one antenna) and 376 within the ﬁshway (three antennas; 8, 71 and 116 m from the ﬁshway entrance, respectively) and consisted of 12 awg thhn wire connected to dia- mond mesh polyethylene fencing material held in place on the stream ﬂoor using cobble. each pass over antenna was connected to a remote tuner board and connected to a multi-antenna data logger (oregon rfid, portland, or, usa) via lengths of twinaxial cable. two pass through antennas were also installed and these covered the entire stream width and were located approximately 70 m down- stream of the ﬁshway entrance, and upstream of the ﬁshway entrance, but approximately 35 m down- stream of the dam (antennas 1 and 2; fig. 1). antenna capacitor units were tuned to maximise detection range (approximately 0.5 m) following installation. as antennas were connected in groups of three to multi-antenna data loggers, each data logger scanned sequentially through all three anten- nas at a rate of approximately 3.3 hz per antenna. multi-antenna data loggers were powered by 12 v direct current step down transformers running on 120 v alternating current outlets. weekly mainte- the site involved data logger downloads, nance at antenna maintenance, time synchronisation of data loggers and retuning of antennas as required. fish were captured as encountered between 1 april and 13 may 2011 via both active backpack electro- ﬁshing and passive fyke netting. sampling and tag- ging encompassed the period during which the ﬁsh in indian creek (i.e., warmwater assemblage) were expected to be engaged in upstream spawning migra- tion based on previous work on similar species in ontario at a denil ﬁshway in a comparatively larger river (bunt et al. 2001). electroﬁshing was conducted immediately downstream of the barrier and extended to approximately 500 m downstream. a fyke net (0.635-cm stretched mesh) captured upstream moving ﬁsh approximately 100 m downstream of the barrier. the net was set at 45o to the stream and was set for approximately 20 h, on ﬁve separate occasions between 5 may and 12 may. captured ﬁsh were transferred to a holding cooler, where they were mea- sured, tagged and received a small caudal ﬁn clip to rapidly conﬁrm tagging in case of later recapture. uniquely coded pit tags (22 9 3.9 mm hdx, texas instruments, dallas, tx, usa) were inserted into the coelomic cavity using a 6-gauge injector (baras et al. 1999). care was taken to minimise air exposure and anaesthetics were not used. all tagged ﬁsh were held for a short period of time (<30 min) in insulated con- tainers with aerated water to ensure recovery and were subsequently transferred back into the creek at a common release point approximately 100 m down- stream of the dam (fig. 1; release site a). the major- ity of ﬁsh were captured and tagged from 6 to 12 may when releases comprised 324 individuals pooled over ﬁve sampling occasions and peaked on 10 may with the capture of 136 individuals. outside of this period, the number of ﬁsh released on any given day did not exceed 25 individuals. due to local abundance, we varied release locations of an additional group of creek chub to separate issues of attraction from passage efﬁciency and to examine the potential problem imposed by a particularly chal- lenging section in the lower reaches of the ﬁshway. this section consists of a small drop in the ﬁshway due to underlying shallow bedrock, which in turn causes a section of increased slope and faster water velocity, which we considered could potentially impede pas- sage. forty additional creek chub captured in the fyke net on 11 may (n = 20) and 12 may (n = 20) were released at sites b and c (approximately 6 m and 60 m into the ﬁshway, respectively; fig. 1). release site b ﬁsh (n = 19, 175.5  8.2 mmtl) were released just inside the ﬁshway between antenna 3 and antenna 4 (downstream of the challenging section). release site c ﬁsh (n = 21, 165.4  4.4 mmtl) were released between antenna 4 and antenna 5, upstream of the shal- low bedrock area. there was no signiﬁcant size differ- ence (tl) among the two creek chub experimental release groups (t = 1.117, df = 38, p = 0.271). multispecies evaluation of a nature-like ﬁshway hourly water temperature data were recorded from instream thermal loggers (ds1921z ibutton, maxim integrated products, san jose, ca, usa) for the duration of the study. the corrected discharge data for spencerville were provided by the water ofﬁce of environment canada on 22 november 2011 (environment canada 2011). hourly discharge values for indian creek were estimated by multiplying total discharge by 0.167, the relative contribution of the indian creek catchment area (41 km2) to the total catchment area (246 km2) at the gauging site (man- cini & langlois-anderson 2006). data analysis movements of the ﬁsh were recreated by examining date and time records for individual ﬁsh and antenna locations throughout the study. attraction efﬁciency was calculated as the proportion of ﬁsh detected on the ﬁshway entrance antenna (antenna 3) compared to the proportion of tagged individuals detected on antenna 1 and 2. passage efﬁciency represented the proportion of ﬁsh successfully ascending the ﬁshway compared to the proportion entering the ﬁshway. as 149 of 391 tagged ﬁsh were not detected by any antenna, the fate of 38.1% of tagged individuals is unknown in this study. categorical data (detected, not detected) were evaluated using logistic regression analysis to determine if ﬁsh length, capture method (backpack electroﬁshing or fyke net) or capture/ release date had an effect on subsequent detection of pit tagged individuals below the dam or at the ﬁsh- way. this analysis was conducted using the four most abundant species (common shiner, creek chub, rock bass ambloplites rupestris and white sucker). any further analysis was only conducted on detected ﬁsh. individuals were deemed to have been success- fully attracted to the ﬁshway if they were detected at antenna 3. successful passage was deﬁned as detec- tion at antenna 6. as only three (common shiner, creek chub and white sucker) of the seven tagged species had ade- quate sample sizes following detection (i.e., >50 indi- viduals), detailed analyses focussed on these species. time to attraction was calculated as the time it took to reach antenna 3 from ﬁrst detection. nine common shiner, seven creek chub and one white sucker were ﬁrst detected at the attraction antenna (antenna 3) possibly due to code collisions resulting from simul- taneous movements through antenna 1 and were therefore removed from the calculation of attraction time. passage duration is deﬁned as the time it took the ﬁsh to move from antenna 4 to antenna 6, effec- tively the length of the ﬁshway. total passage delay is the time it took the ﬁsh to move from ﬁrst detec- tion to antenna 6. for the creek chub experimental 377 steffensen et al. release, passage efﬁciency was calculated separately for each of the release sites and attraction efﬁciency was excluded as the release sites (b and c) were already within the ﬁshway. because ﬁsh from release site c were released near the middle of the ﬁshway, their passage duration is not reported. where sample sizes permitted, statistical tests were only performed on the three most abundant species. differences in mean length of ﬁsh attracted to the ﬁshway were compared with those not attracted using independent sample t-tests. likewise, differences in the mean length of ﬁsh passing the ﬁshway were compared with those attracted, but not passed using independent sample t-tests. we used a pearson prod- uct-moment correlation to test for an association between passage duration and total length of creek chub, as this was the only species to ascend the ﬁsh- way in adequate numbers. we tested for a difference in the mean time to attraction at the ﬁshway among species using a one-way analysis of variance (anova), with a tukey’s hsd test used to ascertain homoge- nous groups following a signiﬁcant result. where appropriate, data were ﬁrst tested for the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance following the methods outlined by grafen & hails (2002), and transformed and reassessed if necessary. in addition, the assumption of multi-colinearity was assessed for the logistic regression analysis. all statistical analyses were deemed signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 and conducted using spss statistical software (version 18; spss inc., chicago, il, usa). all data are presented as mean  standard error (se) unless otherwise stated. results of the seven species tagged during this study, all were detected at antenna 1 (table 1). attraction efﬁ- ciency was variable among species and ranged from 58.3% (rock bass) to 100% (brown bullhead and pumpkinseed lepomis gibbosus) (table 1). six of the seven species attracted to the ﬁshway were able to successfully ascend it, with passage efﬁciencies rang- ing from 5.1% (common shiner) to 57.1% (brown bullhead) (table 1). attraction efﬁciencies for the three most commonly occurring species were 63.3% (common shiner), 83.7% (creek chub) and 65.6% (white sucker). passage efﬁciency for these same three species was 5.1%, 38.4% and 25%, respectively (table 1). in addition, four creek chub passed the ﬁshway more than once (i.e., they repeatedly tra- versed the ﬁshway) by exiting over the dam face 24– 72 h after ﬁrst ascension, locating the entrance once more and reascending the ﬁshway. the probability of detecting common shiner, rock bass and white sucker was unrelated to length, capture method or date of capture (table 2). in contrast, there was a higher probability of detecting larger creek chub following tagging, and a lower probability of detecting individ- uals captured later in the study (table 2). common shiner and white sucker were able to pass the ﬁshway relatively quickly (1.2  0.2 h and 4.3  2.1 h, respectively); however, time to attraction was typically prolonged (116.2  14.9 h and 66.3  24.0 h, respectively; table 3). creek chub time to attraction was 32.6  7.7 h, with passage through the ﬁshway typically taking 19.4  12.8 h (table 3) and there was no correlation between creek chub tl (log transformed) and passage duration (pearson correla- tion: rp = 0.184, p = 0.304) for release site a. there was a signiﬁcant difference among species in terms of time to attraction (log-transformed) (one-way anova: f2,135 = 13.144, p < 0.001). post hoc comparisons (tukey’s hsd) revealed that creek chub took signiﬁ- cantly less time to locate the ﬁshway entrance (attrac- tion time) in comparison with common shiner, with white sucker attraction time not signiﬁcantly different table 1. fish species tagged for evaluation of the indian creek nature-like ﬁshway. fishway performance was evaluated

however, white sucker passed during a range of discharges. the majority (>90%) of activity for all three spe- cies occurred during the night periods (fig. 3). com- mon shiner (fig. 3a) and white sucker (fig. 3c) were most active in the early morning hours, whereas creek chub (fig. 3b) were most active in the late evening hours. similar patterns are observed at the attraction antenna (antenna 2) for ﬁsh that were able to pass and those that were attracted, but did not pass (fig. 4). common shiner (fig. 4a) exhibited move- ment throughout the day, with the greater number of counts in the

while white sucker exhibited reverse patterns. discussion attraction and passage efﬁciency at the indian creek ﬁshway was highly variable among species and these metrics ranged from 58 to 100% and 0 to 57%, respectively. these results differ from the meta- analysis provided by bunt et al. (2012), in which nature-like ﬁshways typically exhibit low attraction efﬁciencies and high passage efﬁciencies in compari- son with conventional ﬁshways. aarestrup et al. (2003) reported an attraction efﬁciency of 91% and passage efﬁciency of 60% for brown_trout (salmo_trutta) passing a 130-m long nature-like ﬁshway and suggested that ﬁshway dimensions a behavioural barrier causing trout to reverse their direction and leave the ﬁshway entrance, thus con- tributing to low passage efﬁciency estimates. calles & greenberg (2005) examined the attraction and passage efﬁciencies of brown_trout in 150-m long acted as (50–53% and 100%, respectively) and 370-m long (14–20% and 91–92%, respectively) nature-like ﬁsh- ways. lower attraction efﬁciencies were attributed to poor attraction ﬂow and an inability of ﬁsh to locate the entrance, while high passage efﬁciencies were attributed to the swimming ability of brown_trout. a later study (calles & greenberg 2007) re-examined the same ﬁshways for use by multiple species and considerable variation in efﬁciency among species was documented. for example, attraction and passage efﬁciency for the common bream (abramis brama) was 10% and 100%, respectively, while roach (rutilus rutilus) exhibited attraction and passage efﬁ- ciencies of 23% and 50%, respectively. little infor- mation exists with which to compare the performance of species studied at indian creek in other nature-like ﬁshways; however, assessments at conventional ﬁsh- ways are available. pratt et al. (2009) reported attrac- tion efﬁciency that ranged from 97 to 98% and 82 to 85% for the white sucker at two small vertical slot ﬁshways in southern ontario and passage efﬁciencies of 36–88% and 6–9%. thiem et al. (in press) reported passage efﬁciencies of 75.8% of white sucker through a large vertical slot ﬁshway in south- ern quebec. o’connor et al. (2003) provides the only passage efﬁciency estimates for creek chub with which to compare the ﬁndings of this study, with creek chub exhibiting a passage efﬁciency of 29% through a vertical slot ﬁshway. neither attraction information exists for creek chub, nor do attraction or passage efﬁciency estimates exist for common shiner. duration of ﬁshway passage varied among the three most common species. common shiner had the shortest passage duration, followed by white sucker and creek chub. swimming performance is a key ele- ment in ﬁsh passage (katopodis et al. 2001); there- fore, duration could vary from the individual’s reluctance to swim at higher water velocities or even an inability to swim at these velocities (bunt et al. 2012). the indian creek ﬁshway was built for an optimal water velocity of 0.8 ms  1. thiem et al. (in press) have recorded white suckers ascending a verti- cal slot ﬁshway with velocities >1.5 ms  1, while common shiner have been reported to ascend veloci- ties upwards of 0.6 ms  1 (ficke et al. 2011). bunt et al. (2001) recorded denil ﬁshway passage by creek chub up to water velocities of approximately 0.6 ms  1. it is possible that passage duration was inﬂuenced by water level within the ﬁshway. creek chub took the longest to pass and only passed during times of lowest discharge. with a maximum depth of 0.2 m during optimal conditions, it is possible that ﬁsh did not have enough water to ascend and remained in the pools for longer periods of time. by manipulating the release locations of creek chub to examine the effect of a particularly challenging sec- multispecies evaluation of a nature-like ﬁshway tion in the lower reaches of the ﬁshway on passage efﬁciency, we were able to increase passage efﬁ- ciency from 42.1% to 76.2%. although a similar approach was not used for other species, this pro- vided preliminary evidence to explain the low pas- sage efﬁciencies observed in this study. successful passage events were preceded by entrance delays in this study. delayed passage can have severe consequences for migrating ﬁsh. for example, caudill et al. (2007) demonstrated that slow dam passage of chinook salmon (oncorhynchus_tshawytscha) and steelhead (o. mykiss) resulted in reproductive failure. delays associated with dam pas- sage have also been observed to negatively affect sockeye salmon (o. nerka) reproductive success, although were more likely to impact females than males (roscoe et al. 2011). while the causes of delayed passage in the above studies are unknown, depletion of energy reserves through hyperactivity either before or during passage represents one possible explanation, and has been linked with passage failure in other studies (e.g., hinch & bratty 2000). it is pos- sible that the passage delays experienced by ﬁsh at the nature-like ﬁshway in this study negatively affected their reproductive success. however, the activity lev- els of ﬁsh and their reproductive success were not monitored, and we assumed that successful ﬁshway passage at indian creek was universally beneﬁcial for all species given the study was undertaken during known spawning periods. the fallback (presumably over the dam) and reascension of a small number of creek chub shortly after passage was unexpected in this study. given the small number of occurrences of fallback in comparison with the number of ascensions, we assume that the ﬁshway exits a sufﬁcient distance from the dam to discount any population-level conse- quences. furthermore, the reascension by these four individuals indicates that their ﬁrst passage event was not energetically costly, or that they had sufﬁciently recovered to undertake a second successful ascent. the indian creek nature-like ﬁshway improved connectivity for stream ﬁshes to approximately 85% of the creek upstream of the barrier. the approach adopted here, whereby stakeholders were engaged in the construction of this nature-like ﬁshway, represents a promising model for the numerous barriers to ﬁsh passage that occur on low gradient streams around the globe. however, biological evaluations should be a requirement for any new (and existing) ﬁshways to ensure that attraction and passage efﬁciency are opti- mised (bunt et al. 2012). based on the ﬁndings of this study, a number of modiﬁcations could be made to the indian creek ﬁshway to possibly improve overall efﬁ- ciency. to improve attraction ﬂows, placement of in- stream structures such as boulders or logs could be used to manipulate hydraulic conditions in and around 381 steffensen et al. the entrance and also to provide navigational direction towards the entrance and away from the dam (katopo- dis et al. 2001). to address the apparent passage chal- lenge (i.e., shallow bedrock areas) in the lower reaches of the ﬁshway, it may be necessary to increase channel depth at this location. to inform future nat- ure-like ﬁshway design, we advocate for not simply making such modiﬁcations, but doing so and evaluat- ing the hydraulic and biotic responses to such changes, similar to the approach reported by bunt (2001) for denil ﬁshways. nature-like ﬁshways are beneﬁcial as they use nat- ural materials, mimic natural rifﬂes and pools, pro- vide passage to a wide variety of species as well as habitat to other aquatic organisms and they have an inland stream focus suitable for low to medium barri- ers (katopodis et al. 2001; beatty et al. 2007). although this ﬁshway was not universally successful at passing all species, or all individuals of a single species, it did demonstrate the utility of nature-like structures as an affordable alternative to conventional ﬁshways. given the need for ﬁshway studies focussed on species other than salmonids (roscoe & hinch 2010), this study also provides necessary attraction and passage efﬁciency information for small-bodied ﬁsh in a small waterway. little or no comparable information exists for ﬁshway use by many of the species studied here, thus our ﬁndings complement the small number of existing community ﬁshway studies conducted in comparatively large waterways and typically on larger species (e.g., bunt et al. 2001; thiem et al. in press). acknowledgements this project was funded primarily by the south nation con- servation authority. additional
