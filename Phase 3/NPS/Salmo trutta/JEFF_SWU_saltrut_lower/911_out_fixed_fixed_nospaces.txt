blennius fluviatilis to channel units with current velocity and heterogeneous substrate, typically found in the main river, and cobitis puludica to channel units with hetero- geneous substrate. f. n. godinhol, m. t. fecceica2, r. v. codes3 'estaqao florestal nacional, posto apicola, lisbon, 2department de engenharia florestal, lnstituto superior de agronomia, lisbon, 3departrnent florestal, universidade de tras-0s montes e alto douro, vila real, portugal key words: river environment;

almaqa 1965; 1983; 1986; collares-pereira 1983). as is typical for the iberian peninsula, this area has a freshwater community poor in species but with a high pro- portion of iberian endemisms (nine out of ten na- tive species), some of them highly restricted; barbus microcephalus and anaecypris hispanica are almost exclusively found in this basin (elvira 1995). more recently, the successful introduction of exotic species, sand and gravel extraction, dam- ming, extensive water extraction for irrigation and increasing eutrophication have raised a great con- cern and discussion about its consequences for na- tive fish assemblages (almaqa 1983; collares-per- eira 1985). of the nine endemic species present in this area, only two were listed as not threatened in the portuguese and spanish vertebrate red data books (blanco & gonzalez 1992; snprc 1992). despite this interest, not much is known about the structure of its freshwater fish community. hence, 134 the aims of the present study are: to describe the present community and to relate the species size- classes (assemblages) to environmental descriptors at two hierarchical spatial levels. n spatial organization of a river fish community study area the basin of the river guadiana is the fourth largest in iberia (67,000 km2) (fig. 1). the study area, approximately the portuguese part of the ba- sin, lies at a mean altitude of 273 m and is char- acterized by a mediterranean climate: the mean annual temperature is above 16°c (reaching a maximum of 18°c) and the mean annual rainfall is 598 mm (less than 500 mm in some areas), with 80% falling between october and march (loureiro et al. 1986). with the exception of a steep fall “the wolf jump”, located between the sites 22 and 23 (fig. l), the gradient is low (<2 m * km-’) and gen- erally homogeneous, though some tributary head- waters are steeper. the basin geology is highly im- permeable and the flow is mostly dependent on precipitation, with the interannual variation in dis- charge attaining a ratio of 57 to 1 (pessoa et al. 1987). in an average year, flow persists in the main river during summer, but all the tributaries become a succession of isolated sites. bed materials coarser than gravel are the dominant stream substrates. the upper part of the portuguese basin supports mainly extensive agriculture and the lower part is occupied by open green oak (quercus rotundfolia lam.) forests and mediterranean shrubland (ono- fre, rosario & cabral 1985). natural riparian veg- etation is sparse and fragmented. submerged mac- rophytes are sparse in the basin whereas emergent macrophytes are more common and include mostly typha latfolia l., scirpus lacustris l. and cyperus eongus l. although there are only 6 small reser- voirs in portugal, the river is highly regulated in spain (48 reservoirs). in addition, a large dam (alqueva) is starting to be constructed in portugal (fig. 1). a sucession (1991-1 994) of dry years have drastically reduced discharge and accentuated eu- trophication caused by rural effluents. material and methods field procedures sampling was undertaken continuously from the middle of july to the beginning of august 1994. channel units were defined as spatial units with lenghts longer than the average channel wetted width and homogeneous in relation to depth, width and current, while a site comprised a series of connected channel units (frissell et al. 1986). thirty sites 100-200 m long were selected along the river guadiana and its tributaries, avoiding river q (1 s c a 0 p aiqueva reservoir o m  fig. 1. map of the lower guadiana basin showing studied sites. codes as in table 1 . sources to prevent comparisons of vastly different channel units (fig. 1, table 1). also, no sites were chosen in the extensive brackish portion of the main river, i.e., downstream of sampling site 24 (fig. 1). since some sites comprised only one or two channel units, in total 44 channel units were sampled (table 1). electrofishing (dc at 400-500 v, 4.5-6 a) was undertaken once in each channel unit moving upstream usually in a zigzag direction during daylight by wading in shallow (< 1 m) areas and from a boat in deeper parts (>1 m). the dur- ation of sampling was roughly proportional to the unit area, with a minimum of 30 mins per channel unit. in each channel unit all the fishes collected were identified and were adscribed to predefined size classes; if available, 25 specimens from a clustered subsample within each species were individually measured for total length (tl) to the nearest mm (johnson & nielsen 1983). we could not reliably identify small barbus spp. (<lo0 mm) to species and placed them in a single category. after collec- tion of the fish, several environmental variables were evaluated in each channel unit: velocity; depth; wetted width (<lo, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, 135 godinho et al. >50 m); abundance of emergent and submerged macrophytes and substrate composition. depth was determined in a number of random points (mean number = 25) within each channel unit using a graduated dip-net pole and then converted to the following classes (<0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.5, 0.5-0.7, 0.7-1.0, 1.0-1.5, >1.5 m). the dominant substrate class (mud/silt<0.05, sand 0.05-2, gravel 2-1 6, pebble 16-64, cobble 64-256, bedrocwboulder >256 mm) was subjectively estimated in these same points around a 0.5-m-radius circle; two vari- ables were derived from the substrate observations, the dominant (more frequent) substrate class and the number of different substrate classes. the abundance of emergent and submerged macro- phytes was estimated visually (absent, some<20, dense<50, and heavy >50% cover). subsurface water velocity was measured with a current meter approximately in the center of the channel unit, but it is reported either as present or absent as it was always low. at the site level the maximum depth and maximum wetted width were deter- mined from on-site measurements. riparian veg- etation was assessed visually as being absent, or presenting some (<20), dense (<50) or heavy (>.%yo) bank cover. analytical procedures analysis of the mean number of specimens and the frequency of occurrence in channel units was undertaken on a catch-per-unit-effort, cpue (catch per 30 min) basis for each fish species in the main river (henceforth river) and tributary streams (henceforth tributaries). similarities in assemblage composition between paired channel units from the same site were determined using the morisita index (wolda 1981). this index takes a value of zero for absolutely dissimilar samples and slightly above one for complete similarity. analysis of vari- ance (anova) was used to detect significant dif- ferences in species length between river and tribu- taries. at the channel unit level, pairwise associ- ations of common species were tested for using the chi-square test, with yates’ correction to avoid bi- ased values resulting from low cell expectations (ludwig & reynolds, 1988). association strength was measured with the ochiai index (01) (lud- wig & reynolds 1988). this index ranges from - 1 when both species are never found together, to 0 with random co-occurrence and to 1 when absol- utely associated. it is also independent of the num- ber of joint absences (hubalek 1982). table 1. site codes, site names, maximum depth, velocity presence, temperature, number of different channel units studied and number of species found in the lower guadiana basin. site code site name 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 caial caiaz guadianal g uadiana2 lucefecit guadiana3 alcarrachel alcarrache2 guadiana4 degebel azam buja oegebez guadiana5 ardilal ardila2 guadianati guadiana7 odeacere guadiana8 slo rriz terges guadiana9 guadianalo guadianall oeiras vascsol vascsoz foupana odeleite beliche maximum depth (m) 1 .o 1 .o 1 .o >2.0 1.2 1.9 1 .o 1.7 1.5 1.8 1.6 1 .o 1.9 0.5 1.5 >2.0 0.6 1.4 1.5 1 .o 0.5 >2.0 1.5 >2.0 0.7 1 .o 0.5 1 .o >2.0 0.5 velocity presence temp.

relate fish assemblages (species and size classes within a species) and en- vironmental variables both at the site and the channel unit spatial levels. cca is an eigenvalue technique specifically developed to directly relate multivariate ecological data matrices; it generates a diagram that displays approximate values of the weighted averages of species (represented by points) with respect to the supplied environmental variables (represented by arrows that roughly point in the factor direction of maximum variation) (ter braak & verdonschot 1995). in preparation for both analysis, a species-size combinations (in pres- ence/absence) by site and a species-size combi- nations (in cpue) by channel unit matrices were developed. the species present in a particular site were those present in its component channel units. the cpue data were transformed by taking nap- erian logarithms b=ln(y+i)] to reduce the influ- ence of species in extremely high abundance (ter braak 1987); species present in less than 4 channel units as well as hybrids were removed to prevent analysis distortion. the following explanatory variables were used in the site level cca: basin area*, distance from source*, altitude*, gradient* (*obtained from 1:50,000 topographical maps), maximum wetted width and depth, abundance of riparian veg- etation, presence of current velocity in the site, presence of a nearby (<20 km) reservoir and num- table 3. morisita index of similarity (im) between assemblages from different channel units within the same site reach channel unit lucefecit caial degebel

with the binary dummy variable river (ter braak 1987). the binary dummy vari- able salt was used to codify sites located in trib- utaries discharging to the brackish portion of the main river. in the channel units cca the following variables were used: width and depth, abundance of submerged and emergent macrophytes, domi- nant substrate class (coarseness), number of differ- ent substrate classes (heterogeneity) and current velocity presence. the ordinations were performed by the program canoco in its 3.1 version (ter braak 1987, 1990). for each cca, a monte carlo simulation was used to test the significance of the trace, the sum of all the eigenvalues (ter braak 1990). results in total, 6937 fishes belonging to 18 species were collected (table 2). specimens were found from 13 to 620 mm tl and length-frequency distributions of common species appeared to represent self-sus- taining populations, with young dominating and adult specimens being scarcer. significant differ- ences in tl between the river and its tributaries were found for some species (table 2), with smaller mean lengths in the latter. assemblage similarity between channel units from the same site was gen- erally average to low (table 3). l. gibbosus was the most frequent and abundant species overall (table 4). frequent species were also, in decreasing order, b. comiza (= b. steindach- neri almaqa 1967), gambusia holbrooki, m. salmo- ides and tropidophoxinellus alburnoides, whereas infrequent species comprised carassius auratus, barbus sclateri and chondrostoma lemmingii. mean cpue varied considerably between the more frequent species (table 4). only cichlasoma facetum and leuciscus pyrenaicus were found more often than expected in the river (x2=9.026, p<0.005) and in the tributaries’ channel units (x2=8.393, p<0.005), respectively. the few species collected exclusively in the tributaries were rare species. the explanatory variables used in the sites cca accounted for 40% of the total variation in site- assemblage composition (i.e., the quotient between the trace and the sum of all unconstrained eigen- values, ter braak 1990), with the first and second axes displaying 50% of that variation (table 5). be- cause the variables distance from source, maxi- mum width, basin area and the dummy variable river were closely correlated (r >0.71), for clar- ity only distance from source is presented in the diagram (fig. 2). the first axis primarily exposed a gradient from fish assemblages composed of smaller cyprinids (particularly l. pyrenaicus), anguilla anguilla and the smaller size-classes of bigger barbus to assem- blages composed mostly of l. gibbosus, m. salmo- table 5. summary statistics for the canonical correspondence analysis of spe- cies-size combinations and

constraining the first canonical axis were the dummy variable salt, separating sites (and respective assemblages) of tributaries draining to the brackish guadiana from other tributary and river sites, and site maximum depth. these variables were the only ones presenting sig- nificant (approximate t-test, ter braak 1987) ca- nonical coefficients on the first axis. however, the first axis also reflected the influence of variables describing the relative position of a site in the basin (distance from source and river) or highly re- lated to them (width), as observed in their corre- lations with the axis (table 5). the second axis re- vealed a smaller gradient (mostly determined by altitude) grossly separating a. anguilla and c. fa- cetum from the other species. the composition of site fish assemblages and explanatory variables were significantly related (p<0.02), as shown by a monte carlo simulation test with 100 permu- tations (ter braak 1987). the cca performed at the channel unit level accounted for 21% of the total variation in channel unit-assemblage composition, with the first two ca- nonical axes displaying 60% of that variation (fig. 3, table 5). among the relevant patterns in assem- spatial organization of a river fish community blage composition with respect to environmental descriptors, there was an association between high relative densities of small cyprinids, in particular l. pyrenaicus and t. alburnoides, and the abun- dance of emergent macrophytes, the most import- ant variable constraining the first axis. these small-sized endemics were also significantly associ- ated with each other (table 6). this group was more abundant in shallower and narrower channel units whereas larger b. comiza, l. gibbosm and m. salmoides were related to the deepest and widest channel units. the two centrarchids were strongly associated with each other and were found with some small endemics less often than expected (table 6). b. j-luviatilis was strongly associated to the presence of current velocity, and in conjunction with c. paludica to heterogeneous substrate. at this spatial level the fish assemblages were signifi- cantly related to the selected explanatory variables (p<0.03: monte carlo simulation test with 100 permutations). another cca performed at this observational level with presencejabsence instead of cpue yielded similar results and is not pre- sented here. discussion of all the freshwater species referenced for the lower guadiana, only a. hispanica and the exotic esox lucius l. were not found in this study, though the latter has been reported to occur based on a preserved head obtained from an angler (almaqa 1965). according to collares-pereira (1990), 18- 29% of the specimens collected in 1978 in some guadiana tributaries, e.g., degebe, were a. hispan- ica while more recently represented only 0-3%. currently it could be even rarer. the absence of a . hispanica contrasted with the notable predomi- nance of l. gibbosus. this centrarchid was first en- countered in the study area in 1977 (almaca 1983), and a survey conducted during 1985 along the main river revealed an already widespread presence (pessoa et al. 1987). however, l. gibbosus was then not encountered downstream of the wolf jump fall, whereas now we found it in sites 23 and 24. table 6. values of the ochiai index (from -1 to 1) and chi-square (with

godinho et a]. in contrast to the sites’ cca, the explanatory variables used at the channel unit level, though sig- nificantly related to species cpue, explained a relatively small percentage of the total variation. despite the possible “noise” of our species data (e.g., caused by electrofishing selectivity) and the importance of environmental variables not con- sidered (e.g., turbidity), we believe that this some- what low explanatory capacity reflected the flexible use of different channel units (i.e,, combinations of substrate, depth, width, velocity and macrophyte abundance) by most species and respective size- classes during summer. indeed, during this period the receding water volumes caused by drying should force the fishes present in a given site to concentrate into any available habitat, precluding strong preferences for specific values of the selected channel unit descriptors. nevertheless, the vari- ation explained by the channel units’ cca is within the values reported in other ecological studies (ter braak & verdonschot 1995). overall, the differences in the habitat (i.e., site or channel unit) used by the several species and some size-classes we encountered are a widespread feature of river fish communities (lobb & orth 1991; aadland 1993; sheldon & meffe 1995). dif- ferent abilities to cope with conditions of abiotic stress could have been a major determinant of the spatial patterns we observed (tramer 1977; meffe 1984; castleberry & cech 1986; bain, finn & booke 1988). during summer high temperatures, smaller desiccating sites are more environmentally harsh than larger ones, since deteriorated water quality, in particular nocturnal low oxygen levels, is much more likely to occur in the former (ladle & bass 1981; williams 1987; boulton & lake 1990). on the other hand, this harshness should be particularly intense in sites located aal an2 1.5 , , 0.5 i l-pl gh bf altitude be1 cr i distance from source be3 ~~~ -1.5 r-- 1 , - 0

that is highly suc- cessful in intermittent conditions (magalhiies 1993; fernandcz-delgado & herrera 1995; prenda personal communication), was particularly abun- dant in these environments whereas larger size- classes of barbus and non-cyprinids (except the tolerant a. anguilla) were absent or at very low densities. the relative abundance of l. pyrenaicus was de- terminant in the discrimination of sites located in tributaries discharging to the brackish guadiana (except the deeper site number 29) and the corre- sponding explanatory importance of the dummy variable salt. these assemblages were also pecu- liar because they contained the only specimens of c. lemmingii and b. sclateri collected (both ex- cluded from the cca’s) and had none or very few exotic centrarchids and c. facetum. the relative explanatory importance of the variable salt was initially not expected. nevertheless, salt could be related to some important explanatory variable not measured (e.g., date of colonization by exotic centrarchids or harsher intermittency) and thus represent a potent synthetic factor enclosing some of the measured and not measured explanatory de- scriptors. the spatial patterns observed could also sup- port a predation gradient hypothesis. according to several authors, a higher predation risk exists for smaller fishes in deeper habitats due to the pres- ence of piscivorous gape-limited predators and for bigger fishes in shallower habitats due to the pres- ence of terrestrial non-gape limited predators (angermeier & karr 1984; power 1987; schlosser 1988). also, water column fusiphorm fishes with soft fin rays (l. pyrenaicus, c. willkommi and t. alburnoides) are considered to be more vulnerable than bottom-dwelling fishes (b. jluviatilis and c. paludica) or deep-bodied fishes with spiny fin rays (l. gibbosus and c. facetum) to m. salmoides (webb 1986), the only piscivorous fish in the study area. in the lower guadiana fishes trapped in the smaller habitats (sites and channel units) could be highly vulnerable prey for widespread mammals (such as luttra luttra, vulpes vulpes and martes foina) and birds (such as ardea cineria, egretta garzetta, ciconia ciconia, milvus nigrans, nycticor- ax nycticorax) (reis 1983; grimmett & jones 1989; antbnio mira, personal communication), as shown in another iberian river (sostoa & lobon- cervia 1989). furthermore, deeper habitats had higher abundances of piscivorous m. salmoides. nevertheless, other non-exclusive factors could be operating to produce the species-related and size-related divergences in habitat use, such as dif- ferent food availabilities between channel units, as well as other biotic interactions besides the sug- gested predation-effect (gorman 1988). the ener- getic constraints experienced in different sites and channel units, namely during high winter-spring discharges, could have also restricted some species and size-classes (e.g. the lentic centrarchids) to par- ticular habitats (meffe 1984; bain et al. 1988; fa- cey & grossman 1992; pearsons, li & lamberti 1992), shaping the assemblages we detected during summer. other patterns revealed were, for example, the relation of c. paludica and b. jhviatilis to sub- strate heterogeneity, as expected from the only two 141 godinho et al. typical bottom-dwellers present (racocinski 1988). b. juviatilis was also the only species clearly re- lated to the presence of current velocity, a factor determined to be important in its summer micro- habitat selection in another iberian river (freeman et al. 1990). emergent macrophytes were probably relevant for l. pyrenaicus and t. alburnoides not only during summer (e.g. providing cover from ter- restrial predators) but also during other periods, like spawning (e.g., t. alburnoides is a phytophil, sensu balon, 1984). a fish survey like the one we conducted must be viewed with caution since it only gives a snapshot of the system (kelsh 1994; sheldon & meffe 1995) and assemblages are not constant (schlosser 1987; matthews 1990). in particular, our results may have been conditioned by the sucession of dry years experienced in southern iberia. other sur- veys conducted in different periods (in particular after periods of normal and high discharge) as well as other study types, e.g., natural experiments (brown & moyle 1991), manipulative experiments (harvey 199 1) and laboratory experiments (meffe 1984), would be extremely useful in disentangling factors constraining the use of riverine environ- ments by the lower guadiana fish community. 1. durante el verano de 1994 estudiamos la composicion y or- ganizacion de 10s ensamblajes de peces de la cuenca baja del rio guadiana (region sur de la peninsula iberica). en 44 canales y 30 localidades, capturamos un total de 6.937 individuos perte- necientes a 18 especies, cantidad que. excluyendo esox lucius (especie introducida) y anaecypris hispanica (ciprinido endtmi- co amenazado), incluye todas las especies de agua duke regis- tradas con anterioridad. los ciprinidos endtmicos chondrosto- mu lemmingii y barbus sclateri fueron encontrados en contadas ocasiones mientras que el exotic0 lepomis gibbosus fue la espe- cie predominante. 2. los ensamblajes del guadiana inferior difirieron espacial mente desde aquellos que se caracterizan por las altas abundan- cias relativas de leuciscus pyrenaicus junto a clases de menor tamaiio de barbus spp. y tropidophoxinellus alburnoides (las tres especies endtmicas), hasta aquellos otros que se caracteri- zan por mayores abundancias relativas de tres especies introdu- cidas (l. gibbosus, micropferus salmoides y cichlasoma face- turn) junto a clases de mayor tamafio de barbus comizu y barbus microcephalus. de estos ensamblajes, 10s primeros utilizan loca- lidades mas estrechas y someras y canales mas pequeiios, nor- malmente en 10s afluentes y proximos a 10s nacimientos. en tstos, l. pyrenaicus es la especie mas abundante en las localida- des de 10s afluentes que desembocan en el guadiana. este gru- po tambien esta relacionado con canales ricos en vegetacibn macrofita. los segundos, estan relacionados tanto con las loca- lidades como con 10s canales de mayor tamaiio, generalmente en el rio principal o en 10s afluentes alejados del nacimiento. 3. aparte de estos dos grupos, encontramos que algunas espe- cies estan asociadas a condiciones ambientales determinadas, por ejemplo blenniusjeuviatilis a 10s canales con velocidad de corriente y substrato heterogeneo, tipicos del rio principal, y cobitis paludicola a canales con substrato heterogeneo. 142 it is a pleasure to acknowledge professor gordon h. copp for the useful comments and suggestions for improvement provided on an early draft of this manuscript.
