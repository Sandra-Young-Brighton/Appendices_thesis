laughton, 1991; laughton & smith, 1992; webb & hawkins, 1989) before entering their spawning grounds later in the year. the earliest running fish tend to move fur- ther upstream before holding and subsequently spawn in the higher tributaries, while those entering later take up holding positions lower down the river and then spawn in the lower tributaries (webb & mclay, 1996; youngson & hay, 1996). it has been pointed out that the “premature migration” of fish into the river reduces their growth opportunities at sea, compelling them to occupy much less produc- tive freshwater habitats, and exposing them to extremes of flow and temperature, disease and predation (quinn, mcginnity, & reed, 2015). 280  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:280–295. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdsparholt et al. milner, cowx, and whelan (2012) emphasised that important practical consequences may arise from changes in the subsequent tim- ing of entry into the spawning tributaries. changes in flow regimes, as a result of obstructions or the removal of water for human purposes, together with factors such as climate change, may alter temporal and spatial patterns in flow and temperature regimes, with poten- tial impacts on the final stage of salmon migrations and subsequent spawning success. any alterations in the hydrology and temperature regimes within rivers are likely to create problems for salmon (jonsson, jonsson, & hansen, 2007) and may especially affect migration from one habitat to another (jonsson, 1991). successful spawning is a crucial aspect of the lives of salmon. low- water conditions may especially delay entry and subsequent upstream migration and may restrict spawning to the most accessible parts of spawning tributaries. uneven spawning distributions may then result in suboptimal use of juvenile habitat, potentially compromising sub- sequent smolt production (gibbins, moir, webb, & soulsby, 2002). entering at the right time and under the right conditions may allow adult salmon to select sites for spawning where water depth and ve- locity can facilitate the process of nest (redd) cutting (moir, soulsby, & youngson, 2002). there is therefore strong interest in examining any data that might illustrate the effects of environmental factors on salmon migrations, especially in the context of regulating, setting and restoring river flow regimes as a means of conserving and managing salmon populations (warren, dunbar, & smith, 2015). the role that river flow plays in the upstream movement of salmon to their spawning grounds has been considered by a number of researchers (baxter, 1961; banks, 1969; pyefinch & mills, 1963; mills, 1968; stewart, 1973; webb & hawkins, 1989; webb, 1989; webb & hawkins, 1989; tetzlaff, gibbins, bacon, youngson, & soulsby, 2008; and others). it has generally been con- cluded that entry of salmon into tributaries or shallow spawning areas requires an elevated water level. low flows may especially con- strain the entry of larger individual salmonids (jonsson et al., 2007). however, very high water discharges can also decrease upstream fish migrations (jonsson & jonsson, 2002; jonsson et al., 2007). atlantic salmon tend to avoid the very highest flow rates as suggested by a delay in peak migration compared to peak flow (lilja & romakkaniemi, 2003). in this study, we have examined data from a salmon counter posi- tioned above the mouth of a particular spawning tributary, the beltie burn, on the river dee in aberdeenshire, one of scotland’s most im- portant salmon rivers. our objective was to consider the role of en- vironmental factors in influencing the numbers and timing of adult salmon entering the spawning grounds. if tributary entry is determined solely by internal biological factors, then it might be expected that salmon would enter the tributary at a particular time of year, either en masse or perhaps in groups related to their sex, size and age. both hellawell (1976) and peters, farmer, and radford (1973) have suggested that the time of year is a potentially important factor in controlling migratory behaviour. if, on the other hand, entry is determined mainly by external factors, then it might vary from year to year, depending on prevailing environmental conditions.     |  281 if the entry of salmon into shallow areas, or past obstructions, requires an elevated water level, as many studies have suggested, then the magnitude of the increase in flow required to influence movement may depend upon its duration, the size of the river and time of year (stewart 1973; peters et al., 1973; millichamp, 1976). is tributary entry initiated by a change in flow rate at the location of the fish, or is it the overall water level that is reached that triggers movement? does entry depend on the pattern of flow over the preceding period of days, weeks and months, as proposed by peters et al. (1973) and tetzlaff et al. (2008)? is entry to the tributary also affected by temperature, as this exerts a strong influence upon the swimming capacity of sal- monids (brett, 1965; crisp, 2000)? passage around or through natural and other obstructions may require high swimming speeds and may be temperature dependent (jonsson & jonsson, 2009). do salmon all enter at the same time, regardless of their size or sex? it might be anticipated that female salmon will migrate earlier into a tributary than males, as studies on the girnock burn, higher up the dee, have shown that females tend to lead the way (youngson & hay, 1996). radio- tracking studies on the dee have also shown that females initially select the spawning sites and are later approached by the males (webb & hawkins, 1989). these various questions and hypotheses were investigated by ex- amining a long time series of counts of salmon entering the beltie, collected over a 13- year period, in relation to time of year, flow rates and water temperatures. 2 |  methods and materials 2.1 | the aberdeenshire dee the river dee rises in the cairngorm mountains of scotland, a moun- tain mass which forms the largest area of continuous high ground in britain and which is often snow covered well into early summer. the river originates at approximately 1,200 metres in elevation on the pla- teau of braeriach, the highest source of any major river in the british isles. the river falls quite steeply to the sea, maintaining a high flow of water along its length. the water is characteristically clear and free from pollution, and the flow pattern is often “alpine,” with maintained flows from snow melt well into april and may. the river flows east- wards for 135 km to enter the north sea at the city of aberdeen (figure 1). along the way to the sea, more than 20 tributaries join the main stem to drain a catchment area of 2100 km2. the catchment is very diverse, with heather moors and mountains in the west, forestry and farmland along the length of the river and the urban environment and busy harbour of aberdeen surrounding the river mouth. the dee is renowned among anglers as one of the great salmon fishing rivers of the world. atlantic salmon is the dominant fish spe- cies and the river dee is designated as a european special area of conservation, in recognition of the importance of its salmon popula- tion. there are significant numbers of brown_trout, generating a sea_trout run and supporting a small sea_trout fishery. there are eels, lam- preys (sea, river and brook species) and sticklebacks present, which do not support fisheries. smolt and adult fish traps are operated by 282  |     figure 1 the river dee enters the sea at aberdeen on the east coast of scotland. the fish counter was installed on the beltie burn, indicated by the small bar across the tributary just before it enters the main river marine scotland science on the girnock burn and baddoch burn, in the upper part of the catchment. an electronic fish counter is operated on the beltie burn in the lower part of the catchment. the beltie burn (figure 1) enters the lower part of the dee, 4 km to the west of the town of banchory. it rises on the south- western slopes of the 500- m hill of benaquhallie, among the eastern foot- hills of the grampian mountains. the beltie is up to 10 m wide in its lower reaches. forty- one smaller streams join the tributary along its 28.5 km length. although parts of the beltie are quite shallow, there are no major obstructions to fish passage. there are significant areas of spawning gravel within the tributary. there are also many areas of high- quality habitat for juvenile salmon, especially in the faster flow- ing sections. the numbers of adult salmon moving upstream into the beltie in most years exceed several hundreds and may reach more than a thousand. sparholt et al. 2.1.1 | migrations of salmon within the river dee salmon spawn throughout the dee, in shallow parts of the main stem and in tributaries of the river. there is an association between spawning location, time spent at sea (sea age) and date of river entry (laughton & smith, 1992). multi- sea- winter salmon begin to return to the river several months before one- sea- winter salmon (grilse), but within both these age classes the earlier running salmon tend to mi- grate to the upper reaches of the river system. thus, grilse entering in may often spawn in the upper reaches of the catchment with multi- sea- winter salmon that have entered during february and march. fish returning to the lower part of the river system tend to enter the river later in the year for their sea age class (smith & johnstone, 1996). there are few man- made or natural obstacles to impede the up- stream passage of salmon through the dee, although many of the tributaries have shallow lower reaches. radio- tracking observations of salmon on the dee (hawkins & smith, 1986) have revealed that salmon initially move rapidly upstream within the river but later spend long periods of residence in pools, often downstream of tributaries and below spawning beds within the river itself. the fish then move short distances upstream in september and october, before entering their spawning areas. 2.1.2 | fish counting an optical fish counter, the vaki “riverwatcher” (vaki aquaculture systems ltd., iceland), was installed in 1999 at the base of the tribu- tary beltie burn to monitor the numbers of adult salmon returning to spawn in the tributary (figure 2). the counter has now been operat- ing every autumn and winter from 1999. the first 2 years were trial years, and only data from 2001 to 2013 were included in the present analysis. the vaki counter uses an infrared beam, and two arrays of photocells to generate and store two silhouette images every time a passing object interrupts the beam (figure 3). the beltie counter was placed 450 m upstream of the confluence with the main stem of river dee to avoid high water levels in the main stem affecting water levels at the counter itself. the counter was placed in a narrow part of the river, with high banks, just below a bridge. a partial dam was con- structed and the counter placed in a rectangular opening within the dam (figure 2). the counter was placed in the river in september of each year and removed in february. daily maintenance of the counter was carried out to remove leaves, twigs and other material, as ob- struction of this type of counter can occur if frequent cleaning is not maintained. the vaki fish counter has been used extensively in iceland, the united kingdom and europe to count the numbers of salmon and other fishes passing upstream through rivers. initial tests of the counter re- ported 99% accuracy for passage maximum rates of 30 fish/day of arctic char salvelinus_alpinus and 50 fish/day of s. salar (gudjonsson & gudmundson, 1994). more recently, shardlow and hyatt (2004) confirmed that the vaki counter was very accurate (>95%) for rates of passage through the scanner unit of less than 500 fish/hr. even migration rates of up to 1,000 fish/hr could be counted with better sparholt et al.     |  283 (a) (b) (c)

(c) the weir blocks off the burn, forcing fish to pass through the counter than 90% accuracy. however, accuracy declined to 76% at a rate ex- ceeding 1,500 fish/hr. the principal cause for the decline in accuracy at high passage rates was the inability of the infrared sensors to count more than one fish swimming through the counter at the same time. rates of fish passage prevailing within the beltie were much lower than those giving rise to accuracy problems, and visual inspection of the images showed that it was very unusual for more than one salmon to pass through the counter at the same time. information provided on each fish passing through the scanner in- cluded the date, time, direction, body depth and a pair of silhouette images for each fish. the silhouette images were later viewed on a computer screen to confirm that the targets were fish (as opposed to debris or other animals including otters) and to edit results. water temperature was continually monitored and recorded by the counter. fish length was calculated from depth–length ratios; a conversion fac- tor of 5.5 was applied for determining the length of the fish in the beltie, based on sampling of 50 fish captured within the burn using a fyke net. both brown_trout (s. trutta) and sea_trout (the migratory form of s. trutta) passed through the counter as well as salmon. nonfish signals were removed from the counts, and the images were then assigned as follows, based on measurements made on fish captured within the burn: brown_trout s. trutta ≤ 30 cm; sea_trout s. trutta > 30 cm, ≤ 50 cm; and s. salar > 50 cm. fish designated as salmon were sexed where possible, based on the silhouette generated by the counter (figure 3). independent examination of images obtained by a video camera in november and december 2003 confirmed that at least 80% of the sex attributions were correct. those fish that could not be sexed from their images with any confidence were recorded as unsexed. every year, upstream salmon counts from 15 september to 15 january the following year were analysed. after initial trials in 1999 and 2000, full collection of the counter data began in 2001. water levels in the tributary were electronically monitored by means of an isodaq idqlib depth pressure sensor (hydro- logic ltd). levels were recorded every 10 min. data on water levels in the main stem of the river dee were provided by the scottish environment protection agency from their gauging station at woodend, approximately 1 km upstream 284  |     figure 3 examples of images displayed on the vaki counter. the salmon shown are moving upstream. (a) shows two overlapping images of the same female salmon. (b) and (c) are images of two different male salmon. (d) and (e) are images of two female salmon. images are normally displayed in colour of the mouth of the beltie burn. at the gauging station, the mean water velocity combined with the cross- sectional area of the river is used to provide a measurement of the river flow, defined as the volume of water passing a measuring point in a given time, measured in cubic metres per second. there is no regulation of flow in the river dee and little natural storage of water within the river above woodend (although significant accumulation of snow can occur in the headwaters in winter). 2.2 | statistical analysis a formal statistical analysis was performed to disentangle the ef- fects of various factors influencing the counts of migrating fish, fo- cusing on water flow and temperature. for this analysis, the counts of salmon migrating upstream over a 24- hour period were examined. the data were restricted to those collected between 5 october and 23 december to avoid too many zero observations (which can give rise to problems in statistical analysis). from the flow data available from the main stem of the dee, 24- hour mean values were used for analysis. the 24- hour period for the flow data was defined to be 12 hr ahead of the 24- hour mean value of the count data, to allow for a time lag for salmon to react to a change in level. water flow changes from 1 day to the next were also considered to investigate sparholt et al. whether salmon reacted to changes in the flow rather than the actual flow level. this parameter was also used to test whether the salmon needed one more day (i.e. 1.5 days on average) to react to changes. water temperature data from the beltie were aggregated as 24- hour mean values with the same periodicity as for the salmon count data. a list of all the parameters subjected to statistical analysis is given in supplementary information (table s1). regression glm- type analysis was used to estimate the strength and direction of the relationship between the numbers of salmon passing through the fish counter (the counts), and environmental vari- ables including time of year, river flow and temperature. however, the variables included in the analysis were treated as categorical with constant values within intervals. the intervals were as follows: 10 day periods for time of year, seven intervals (bins) for flow and a one de- gree interval for temperature. no a priori linear or curvilinear pattern was assumed. the classical poisson regression model is often of limited use in biological studies, because such data sets typically exhibit overdis- persion (the presence of greater variability in a data set than would be expected by the poisson distribution) and/or an excess number of zeros (chambers & hastie, 1992; zeileis, kleiber, & jackman, 2008). the former issue can be addressed, for example using a negative bi- nomial (nb) regression model. both the poisson and negative binomial regression models belong to the family of generalised linear models (glms; see nelder & wedderburn, 1972; mccullagh & nelder, 1989). neither of these models can cope with excess zeros. hurdle models (mullahy, 1986) combine a left- truncated count component with a right- censored hurdle component. zero- inflation models (lambert, 1992) take a somewhat different approach: they are mixed models that combine a count component and a point mass at zero. cameron and trivedi (1998, 2005) provide an overview of count data models, including hurdle and zero- inflated models. each of these model types was tested. these included a “glm” with a poisson distribution, a “negative binomial” (nb) regression model, a “hurdle” model with a negative binomial distribution for the nonzero part and a binomial distribution for the zero- inflated part and a “zero- inflation” model, also with a negative binomial distribution for the nonzero part and a binomial distribution for the zero- inflated part. the latter two models were from the r package pscl (jackman, 2012). the logit link function was used except for the zero- inflated part of the “hurdle” model and the “zero- inflation” model, where a log link func- tion was used. the model was set up in all cases as: g(counts) = α + year + 10 day-period + ﬂow + ﬂow change lagged + temperature, where g is the log link function, α is the intercept, “year” is year, “10 day- period” is the date grouped into 10 day bins, “flow” is the flow at woodend, “flow change” is the change in flow from 1 day to the next, “flow change lagged” is the same, but lagged 1 day, and “tem- perature” is the water temperature in the beltie. all variables were applied as categorical variables with the definition of categories given in supplementary information (table s1), except in a single sensitivity sparholt et al. analysis, where a generalised additive model (gam) (hastie & tibshirani, 1990; maindonald, 2010) was used with the temperature effect mod- elled with a spline function. this was preferred, compared to applying them as continuous variables, because the latter would involve forcing a definite form such as a quadratic form or maybe a normal distribution form on the model. furthermore, allowing the variables to be categor- ical gives the advantage of simple check of the appropriateness of the model, because if they end up giving a nicely smooth pattern (like the effects of the “10 day- period”—see later), this gives some confidence that the model used is sound. the zero- inflation part in the “hurdle” model and in the “zero- inflation” model was modelled with the same categorical variables as in the nonzero mode. the number of zero counts, nonzero counts and the mean count of nonzero counts by parameter value are presented in supplementary information (table s2). all analyses were conducted using the r soft- ware, involving the packages mass, pscl and gam (v. 3.1.2; http:// www.r-project.org). the akaike information criterion (aic) method (akaike, 1974), aicc, which is aic with a correction for finite sample sizes (burnham & anderson, 2002, ch. 7), and the similarity between observed and predicted number of zero counts were employed to determine which model provided the most meaningful information. alternative model configurations were also tested. for instance, temperature is clearly related to season and therefore also to the parameter 10 day- period. leaving out the 10 day- period parameter might therefore improve the model in terms of parsimony. various combinations of flow and flow change parameters were also tested to see effects on model performance and on how these factors influ- enced salmon migration into the beltie. 3 |  results 3.1 | timing of entry into the tributary in any given year, the salmon tended to enter the beltie discon- tinuously, in groups (figure 4). the timing of entry differed greatly     |  285 between years (supplementary information, fig. s1). in some years (e.g. 2001, 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2012), substantial numbers of fish entered the burn during september and the early part of october. in other years (e.g. 2003 and 2007), the majority of fish entered later in the year, during november and december. some of the differences in the total numbers entering may have been associated with changes in the numbers of adult fish returning to the river dee, and with popula- tion size. however, it was evident from the statistical analysis that the numbers entering and their timing were also strongly influenced by environmental factors. water flow in the main stem of the river was important in in- ducing migration of salmon into the tributary. the conditions that coincided with the entry of salmon into the tributary are indicated in supplementary information (fig. s2), which shows the daily counts, water temperature in the tributary and water flow in the main stem of the river at woodend by year, where 2 years had early entry (2005 and 2012) and two had late entry (2003 and 2007). entry of salmon was often related to high flow rates in the main stem of the river at woodend. however, there were some exceptions to this general pattern. in 2005 around julian days 78–82 (in the analysis, julian day 0 is 15 september), the water flow was very high, but very few fish were counted. in 2012 around julian days 53–56, there were quite low flow levels, but high counts, while around julian days 90–105 there were high flow levels and low counts. high counts were also associated with increases in temperature, for example in 2005 around julian days 84–90, and also in 2012 around julian days 53–55, although in the latter case there was also a water level increase. there was often a strong association between the water flow in the main river and the water level in the beltie. however, on a few occasions there were flood conditions prevailing in the main river, without corresponding flood conditions in the beltie. there were no examples in the time series of high levels in the beltie without high levels in the main river. figure 5 illustrates flood events in the main river, showing salmon entering the tributary as the water flow 2002  y a d r e p n o m a

woodend (in main river stem of the dee) increased in the main river. it was evident that water level increases in the beltie tributary itself were not needed to stimulate the entry of large numbers of salmon. the numbers of salmon migrating upstream showed a gradual increase as the temperatures increased up to about 6°c, and then declined at higher temperatures. temperatures lower than 3°c had a strongly negative effect on the numbers migrating. however, tem- perature is strongly connected with season and the statistical analysis below attempts to disentangle them, so that the contribution of each factor can be assessed. the majority of salmon entered during the afternoon and early evening, with a peak between 14.00 and 18.00 hr (figure 6). there was a tendency for female salmon to enter the beltie slightly earlier by about 2 weeks in the year than males. they also entered in smaller numbers (figure 7). 3.2 | statistical analysis the aim of the statistical analysis was to disentangle the effects of the various factors influencing entry of salmon into the beltie tribu- tary. for instance, when looking at the raw data it seemed that most salmon were migrating upstream when the temperature was around 6°c, but when the effects of other factors (e.g. the date) were taken into account by the statistical models, the estimate of the optimal temperature changed to 11°c. four measures, the log likelihood, the aic, the aicc and the pre- dicted number of zero observations compared to the actual zero observations, were used to judge the performance of the statistical models. it can be seen from table 1 that the “poisson” model (pois) performed least well, in comparison with the other three models. the other three models, the “negative binomial” (nb), “hurdle with the negative binomial” (hurdle- nb) and “zero- inflation with the negative binomial” (zi- nb), were quite similar with respect to three of the statistics (log likelihood, aic and expected number of zero observations). because the nb model contained only 53 parameters to be esti- mated, compared to the 105 parameters in the other two models, the nb model comes out much better than the other two models accord- ing to the aicc criteria and the nb model was regarded as the most appropriate. thus, the count data were overdispersed, but probably not zero- inflated to any substantial extent. the total deviance ex- plained by the model was separated into the various contributions by the different parameters for the nb model, shown in supplementary information (table s3). it can be seen that all parameters contributed sparholt et al.     |  287 l n o m a s f o r e b m u n s t n u o c s t n u o c 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 time of

are shown in supplementary information (table s4). as a sensitivity analysis, a gam version of the nb model was also run with temperature fitted with a spline function. this reduced the model performance slightly, but gave a very similar temperature 288  |     table 1 summary of fitted statistical models for count data; number of observations, number of estimated parameters, maximised log

thereafter a sharp fall in activity at temperatures above 12°c. all four models (pois, nb, “hurdle- nb” and “zi- nb”) were statis- tically highly significant. they explained about 45% of the deviance in the data. fig. s3 in supplementary information shows the observed and the expected counts for the nb model by year. it can be seen that throughout there is a general correspondence between the observed and the expected upstream counts, but also some deviations. the parameter values estimated seemed to be robust to the alter- native statistical assumptions in the modelling done here (figure 8). the models showed that water flow in the main stem of the river was important in inducing migration of salmon into the tributary. the effect of water flow in the main stem on the migration into the beltie increased up to flow category 4, which was a flow rate of 61- 80 m3 per second. higher flow rates did not increase migration further. the change in rate from 1 day to the next also proved to be significant. however, flow change was not as significant as the other parameters and was in addition quite dependent on the choice of model. looking at the migration lagged by 1 day gave a clearer indication of increased migration with change in flow rate. this lagged parameter was more consistent among the models, showing a clear increase in migration (counts) lagged by 1 day at flow changes between 20 and 120 m3 per second from 1 day to the next. at flow changes larger than 120 m3 per second, the effect of this parameter reduced substantially. running the basic model for female fish only, with the same factors as for the full analysis (males + females), gave very similar results for all parameters (the factor flow change with on average half a day delay was an exception—but this was already identified as a weak factor for the combined male and female data). sparholt et al. the year effect indicated that salmon counts were high in general in 2002–2004 and 2010, and low in 2011 and 2012. the season effect showed a smooth pattern with an increase from the first value “1” (5–14 october) until it peaked at “7” (24 november–3 december) and decreased thereafter. various alternations of parameters included in the modelling using the nb model were made to test the robustness of this aspect of the modelling. as temperature is closely related to season, there is of course a strong correlation (although not linear) between this parameter and the 10 day- period parameter. thus, leaving out the 10 day- period parameter is not expected to decrease the model fit significantly. table 2 (run identifier b) shows the key results of the nb model leaving out the 10 day- period parameter. it can be seen that the number of parameters estimated decreases from 53 to 45 and that the likelihood and aic get a bit worse, but the aicc and expected number of zeros a little bit better. traditional modelling aiming for par- simony might imply that the 10 day- period parameter could be left out, but from a biological point of view there is a strong support to keeping it in, because salmon certainly do have seasonality in their be- haviour, and because one of the aims of our analysis is to disentangle seasonality and temperature as factors influencing salmon migration. it was also tested whether salmon could “predict” a flow increase and start migrating upstream slightly before the flow increased (run c in table 2). this increased the aicc substantially while the three other model performance indicators were almost unchanged and the param- eters estimated did not show any clear smooth pattern, indicating the model was following noise in the data rather than signal. thus, there is little support in the data for such a “predictive” ability of salmon. because flow events in the river dee are often short- term, one would expect that the flow parameter includes a substantial part of the flow change parameter effects. for instance, if the flow event is only hap- pening in 1 day with high flow levels and the flow next day returns to normal, the flow parameter and the flow change parameter are cov- ering the same event and the counts of salmon migration through the counter of course the same. this was tested with a simple model con- figuration where all the flow change parameters were taken out (run d in table 2). this reduced the number of parameters from 53 to 37. the aicc was reduced substantially, while the three other model per- formance indicators were almost unchanged. therefore, from a purely statistical point of view this is probably a better model. however, the pattern for those parameters which are common to both models (run a and d), namely year, 10 day- period, flow and temperature, is very similar (figure 8), and the core model (run a) is biologically sound and is needed to account for the effect of flow changes, which justify this as being the core model. 4 |  discussion 4.1 | effects of environmental

temperature. the results were similar to earlier observations on the entry of salmon to the girnock burn on the dee, reported by webb and hawkins (1989), which showed that adult fish may enter the girnock in small numbers in september, but the majority do so in october or november, when their arrival often coincides with early winter spates (sudden flooding of the river). thus, the timing of entry into tributaries of the dee appears to be determined by proximate factors, unrelated to the timing of migration from the sea, which takes place much earlier in the year for the ma- jority of dee salmon. from our observations, it was clear that the final ascent into the beltie is primed to take place later in the year and is greatly affected by local environmental conditions and especially flow rates. it has often been suggested that entry of salmon into shallow areas, or past obstructions, requires an elevated water level (baxter, 1961; banks, 1969; stewart, 1972; peters et al., 1973; millichamp, 1976, and others). it is evident from the counts from the beltie that there was much variation in the timing of salmon entry from year to year, depending on the local water flows and also temperature conditions. in some years, entry occurs early, coinciding with large increases in water flow in the main stem, for example in 2001 (around 1 october), 2005 (around 10 october), 2011 (around 20 september) and 2012 (around 1 october). however, there were also cases where early increases in flow did not result in salmon entry, for example in 2008 (around 17 september) and in 2010 (around 22 september). in these years, the temperature con- ditions accompanying those flow increases were especially cold. it was also especially evident that the entry of salmon was delayed in those years where the water flow remained low well into the autumn, as in 2003 where the flow was low until around 1 november, and in 2007 where the first autumn spate came around 20 november. tetzlaff et al. (2008), examining trap catches on the girnock burn, also noted interannual variability in tributary entry. they noted that in wetter years, salmon entry to the stream usually started relatively early and continued throughout the prespawning period. in contrast, in dry years, fish entry could be delayed, perhaps resulting in lower numbers of spawning females entering the stream and suboptimal util- isation of juvenile habitat in the following spring. they concluded that the pattern of entry into the girnock on a given day depended on the patterns of flow over the preceding period of days, weeks and months. for example, in dry years, salmon entered the burn on the back of late spates that were much lower in magnitude than those which act as stimuli in wet years. these observations suggest that migratory drive increases in the final stages of sexual development, with salmon enter- ing under relatively low flow conditions that would not have stimulate their entry in other years or earlier in the season. there was no annually consistent threshold level of flow in the burn itself that triggered tributary entry. figure 5 indicates that flow events in the dee itself were most important in triggering salmon entry into the beltie. other authors have concentrated their attention on the role of flows within the tributaries themselves in triggering migrations. webb (1989) working with radio- tagged fish in the tay suggested that the timing of entry to the isla tributary, and subsequent sustained penetration of the lower reaches of that tributary, corresponded with sparholt et al. the arrival of spates descending the tributary to the confluence, rather than particular flow conditions within the tay itself. webb suggested however that the movement of fish represented a graded response to the previous experience of cumulative river flows rather than a re- sponse to the immediate flow within the tributary. observations from the beltie confirm that the increase in flow re- quired to initiate movement may be smaller after prolonged periods of low flow in the main river than after a similar period of comparatively high flows, as proposed by peters et al. (1973) and by tetzlaff et al. (2008). thus, after a prolonged period of low flows, movement may take place at river flows that under other circumstances would not provoke movement. the swimming capacity of salmonids is strongly influenced by water temperature (brett, 1965; crisp, 2000). it has been suggested that passage around or through obstructions, fish passes and natural obstructions may require high swimming speeds and may be especially temperature dependent (jonsson & jonsson, 2009). it was evident in the beltie burn that the upstream passage of salmon was reduced at low temperatures. temperatures below 3°c were not conducive to up- stream migration. although most fish migration took place at 5–8°c (supplementary information, table s2), when the effects of season and flow were taken into account, the statistical analysis quite clearly in- dicated a continuous positive effect from rising temperatures up to as high as 11°c, above which the positive effect fell sharply. the beltie data also showed that the general flow level was as important as the changes in flow. a change in flow from 1 day to the next did not seem to result in a rapid response from salmon. the fish needed a day or so to react to the flow increase, unless the flow increase was very large. the results from the beltie have also provided evidence that salmon are primed to enter the tributary at a particular time of year. the statistical analysis suggests that the seasonal effect is strong and that the migration into the beltie peaks as late as the end of november to early december. both hellawell (1976) and peters et al. (1973) sug- gested that the time of year is a potentially important factor in con- trolling migratory behaviour. it seems likely that there are a great many factors that may af- fect the timing of entry of salmon into spawning tributaries, and the numbers of fish entering in a given year. clearly, the numbers of adult salmon arriving in the river, and wishing to enter the particular tribu- tary, will affect the numbers entering and perhaps also their timing. however, proximate environmental factors are clearly also important, including flow conditions in the main river and temperature. other factors may lie within the fish themselves, including the state of mat- uration of the salmon. it is likely that the factors that control the entry of salmon to their spawning tributary, examined in this study, are different from those that control salmon original entry into the river itself. smith and smith (1997) found that the upstream movements of atlantic salmon in the estuary of the dee tended to occur during the ebb tide, when an increase in river flow may stimulate fish to ascend. lilja and romakkaniemi (2003) have pointed out that varying factors may ac- count for the upstream movement in different rivers, complicating the overall picture of migratory behaviour. they found few statistically sparholt et al. significant correlations between entry into the mouth of the river tornionjoki from the baltic sea and six measured environmental fac- tors. they concluded that environmental factors have little effect on river entry of atlantic salmon in a large pristine river. jonsson (1991) has suggested that the complex picture of migratory behaviour that is emerging is due to either an underlying hierarchy of environmental factors initiating migration or a local adaptation of fish populations to varying environmental factors among rivers. 4.2 | other aspects of the migrations upstream migration of salmon into the beltie peaked in the afternoon. the results showed that within the time interval from midday to early evening (around 8 p.m), the migration rate was about twice as high as the rest of the day and night. this result was checked for robust- ness by looking at individual years. except for the additional noise in the data when these were split into years, there was a clear pattern of afternoon/early evening migration in all years. this is an unusual diurnal pattern in biology, where patterns are often either day–night (nocturnal or diurnal) or dusk- dawn (crepuscular). it differs from the pattern observed from fish migrating through the main stem of riv- ers, where salmon migrate upstream mainly during dusk and at night (potter, 1988; jonsson, 1991; laughton, 1991; smith & smith, 1997). from our statistical analysis, it was clear that higher temperatures had a positive effect on migration into the beltie. thus, the gradual rise in temperature during the day might provide an explanation for fish entering in the late afternoon. female salmon migrated up to about 2 weeks earlier on average than males, judging from the peaks in counts (figure 7). this finding suggests that the females were migrating earlier into the tributary, perhaps to select spawning sites, and the males were then follow- ing them, seeking to take part in spawning with those females. confirmation of this hypothesis is provided by observations on radio- tagged salmon within the girnock burn. webb and hawkins (1989) reported that progression upstream by males was often associated with the pursuit of single females and groups of females. within the tributary, male fish tended to move during the hours of darkness from a downstream position to join females that had moved upstream in the late afternoon or during the early hours of darkness. there was also a conspicuous difference in activity levels between male and fe- male fish within the girnock burn. whereas the females tended to choose a spawning site, spawn and then move downstream after- wards, male fish spent much longer periods on the spawning grounds, rarely staying in one place and often showing large excursions both up and down the tributary. there was a large imbalance between the numbers of males and females entering the beltie. although a proportion of the salmon could not be sexed, the numbers of males passing upstream through the counter exceeded the number of females plus unsexed fish every year. this discrepancy may have been the result of some male fish passing back and forth across the counter, making excursions upstream and downstream as observed by webb and hawkins (1989). some of the males may have passed upstream through the counter more than once.     |  291 4.3 | comparison with count data from other tributaries of the dee marine scotland science operates fish traps on the girnock burn near ballater, and the baddoch burn, near braemar, both in the upper part of the dee catchment. the traps catch adult salmonids migrat- ing upstream. the trapped fish are counted, examined and tagged before being released to continue their journeys. adults migrate into the streams in october and november, close to spawning time. the annual counts in the beltie (the year effect from the nb model) were compared with the trap catches in the girnock and baddoch (table 3). even though the r2 values were significant in all cross- comparisons (mainly due to forcing the regression lines through the origin), the r2 values were generally low and therefore indicate that the dynamics of the annual migrations into these tributaries are quite complex. the lack of strong correlation between the annual counts of salmon entering the three tributaries, beltie, girnock and baddoch, suggests that local environmental factors, including flow and temperature, may determine the migration pattern into a par- ticular tributary in a given year and may also affect the total numbers of salmon entering. data from fish counters, counting weirs and traps have previ- ously been investigated to determine whether they can provide in- dices of fish abundance within river systems (beaumont, welton, & ladle, 1991; braun et al., 2016; o’connell, 2003; thorley et al., 2005). with concerns over the state of salmon stocks, there is pressure to introduce more counters and traps on salmon rivers, as these are considered to be essential tools for the management of salmon and trout fisheries. marine scotland science (mss) is currently seeking to expand the current counter distribution to include new counter sites throughout scotland (braun et al., 2016). the use of such traps and counters is generally restricted to streams and small rivers because of the high costs of constructing them, and limitations in the counting methods adopted (whether these are optical systems, sonar systems, or counting by eye). however, analysis of data from the beltie burn has indicated that the numbers of salmon entering a tributary or small river in a particular year may be very dependent on favourable tempera- ture and flow conditions for upstream passage. where counters are positioned immediately below spawning areas, or parts of the river, or where there are likely to be obstructions to fish passage, it is important to realise that annual changes in environmental conditions will likely affect the counts of fish moving upstream. in such circumstances, the value of such tributary- based systems for assessing salmon population size may be questioned. 4.4 | comparison with rod catches on the dee data on fish catches by anglers in the river dee are collected and collated by marine scotland science and published annually by the scottish government. data on catch data from an angling fishery near banchory, just downstream of the beltie burn, were kindly provided by the owner. the annual counts in the beltie (the year effect from the nb model) were compared with the annual 292  |     sparholt et al. table 3 time series and cross- correlation matrix (r2 for linear regressions through the origin) for beltie salmon annual counts (the “year effect” from nb model), raw counts from the beltie, total catches of salmon on the river dee, numbers of salmon caught in the baddoch burn trap, numbers of salmon caught in the girnock burn trap and catches in a beat downstream from banchory bridge (close to the beltie tributary) year 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 nb model “year effect” river dee catches number of salmon beltie counts number of salmon baddoch trap number of salmon girnock trap number of salmon banchory catches number of salmon 358 789 1412 1363 356 255 258 236 325 520 100 250 346 4,654 3,768 3,310 6,046 5,414 5,620 5,989 6,232 6,740 8,728 8,186 7,589 4,947 420 686 547 1,065 835 831 770 357 341 834 253 128 448 133 40 110 94 56 55 76 51 126 96 108 101 68 41 46 42 114 69 47 68 75 85 143 144 54 34 - - 113 273 205 192 371 324 478 503 375 543 200 nb model river dee catches beltie counts baddoch trap girnock trap banchory catches nb model river dee catches beltie counts baddoch trap girnock trap banchory catches 1 0.38** 0.60*** 0.49** 0.39** 0.24* 1 0.65*** 0.79*** 0.83*** 0.85*** 1 0.57*** 0.63*** 0.48** 1 0.70*** 0.58** 1 0.74*** 1 data from 2001 to 2013. significance levels: *if p < .05, **if p < .01 and ***if p < .001. rod catches (table 3). overall, there was little correlation between the counts on the beltie and salmon catches in the dee. although salmon rod catches showed an increase over the period examined (although they have since declined), the counts (i.e. the year fac- tor) of upstream fish entering the beltie showed a general decrease after an initial period of increase. north atlantic salmon stocks have been in serious decline since the 1970s (reviewed by windsor, hutchinson, hansen, & reddin, 2012; chaput, 2012). the decline has generally been attributed to increasing mortality at sea, with the major factors implicated being changing ocean temperatures, unaccounted bycatch in pelagic fisheries, higher levels of preda- tion and reduction in salmon feeding at sea. todd et al. (2008) drew attention to a decline in salmon stock abundance over three dec- ades. they compared this decline with the widespread sea surface temperature (sst) warming of the ne atlantic ocean, which they suggested had affected the size of the foraging areas exploited by salmon of european origin. spring rod catches on the dee showed a particular decline between the 1960s and 1990s, and have remained at a low level since then. in contrast, summer and autumn rod catches have increased substan- tially in the last 10 years. closure of netting fisheries has taken place around the coast, perhaps leaving greater numbers of fish to enter the rivers. there have also been major changes in the management of the rod fishery on the dee in recent years. catch and release has been introduced and widely adopted and is likely to have increased fish survival. there has also been an extension of the fishing season into october. there has been a decreasing trend in the rod catch since 2010 and a more sudden drop in 2013 and 2014. as yet, there is no explanation for this decline. the proximate factors controlling tributary entry may operate out- side the conditions that influence rod catches and may account for the lack of correlation between the annual counts of salmon entering the beltie and the rod catches at the nearby fishing station. it seems likely that proximate environmental factors, including flow and tem- perature, may determine the migration pattern and numbers entering a particular tributary in a given year. there may also be differences in the seasonal migratory patterns for the different substocks of salmon that have been shown to exist within the dee (coulson et al., 2013). 4.5 | the early arrival of atlantic salmon as we have seen, salmon may enter the dee itself long before they are due to spawn. they spend long periods at holding positions within the main stem (hawkins & smith, 1986). it might be supposed that fish should stay at sea for as long as possible, to maximise growth that can be translated into reproductive success through increased egg sparholt et al. number and egg size and increased competitive ability of larger fish (quinn et al., 2015; youngson, 1994). quinn et al. (2015) proposed two different but not mutually exclusive perspectives to explain the premature migration that occurs on some salmon rivers. firstly, access to the spawning tributaries may be limited by physical factors such as temperature or flow, such that adults entering early gain an advantage in terms of entry to the spawning grounds and that this outweighs the additional energetic cost in terms of the metabolic demand from a summer of fasting. with this hypothesis, it is physical constraints in freshwater that would provide an explanation for the premature entry of some populations. however, the other perspective is that life in the ocean occurs greater risks in terms of predation; the salmon stay at sea only as long as necessary to reap the reproductive benefits of larger size. the mortality risk associated with additional time at sea is perhaps greater than the potential growth- related benefits for repro- duction and the energetic and mortality costs of in- river holding. it has long been known that most adult atlantic salmon return to their natal rivers to spawn. indeed, it has been shown that salmon can home to particular tributaries or areas of the river with remarkable ac- curacy (garcia de leaniz et al., 2007; solomon, 1973; youngson, jordan, & hay, 1994). as a result of this homing behaviour, many rivers and streams contain distinctive populations of salmon, adapted to particular conditions (verspoor et al., 2005). it has been suggested that the life cycles of these local stocks may have adapted to match local hydrolog- ical regimes (beechie, buhle, ruckelshaus, fullerton, & holsinger, 2006; peters et al., 1973). it is certainly evident that there is considerable be- havioural variability among populations and river systems. hawkins (1989) suggested that the early entry into the dee by salmon was related to the abundance of suitable holding locations within the river. in shorter rivers, late migration might be the only option because of the lack of suitable holding positions. there would appear to be no particular advantage in salmon arriving in the river dee very early in the year to obtain appropriate environmental condi- tions for entering spawning tributaries such as the beltie, as suggested by quinn et al. (2015). it is more likely that early arrival is associated with the fish finding suitable holding positions close to their spawning destinations, where individual fish may gain advantages over others in terms of lower energy consumption, protection from predation and ability to enter the spawning grounds before other fish when condi- tions later become suitable.     |  293 data, there was a clear indication of overdispersion, but zero- inflation was not so evident, although these two features were compounded and difficult to disentangle. several different models were applied, and if they gave the same results, this was regarded as an indication that the results were reliable. gams were also explored, where smooth- ing is forced, as in cozigam in r (liu & chan, 2010). this model is theoretical appealing as it models zeros as a function of the mean of the nonzero observations. however, cozigam did not converge to a solution, either because the data were too noisy or because the soft- ware applied a convergence that was not robust enough for our data. from a purely statistical point of view, the simple model where flow changes were not included showed probably the best model performance indicators, especially regarding aicc, and the principle of parsimony would point to that model as the core model. however, the selected core model which includes both the parameter for flow change from one day to the next half a day ahead of salmon migra- tion and that one and a half day ahead was robust to these extra pa- rameters and gave almost identical parameter estimates as the simple model for the parameters common to both models. the models explained about 45% of the variation in the data. as can be seen from supplementary information (fig. s3), in all years the nb model predictions were quite homogeneous around the observed counts. however, 55% of the variation was still not accounted for. the aspects mentioned above, such as prolonged low water flow followed by a spate resulting in different migration responses in salmon, are dif- ficult to model and need more parameters to be estimated. difference by year in sex ratio and difference in migration patterns between the sexes, differences by year in ratio of grilse (one- sea- winter, 1- sw) salmon) to multi- sea- winter (m- sw) salmon entering the river system, natural variability in genetic composition of the salmon from year to year, density of salmon in the holding pools in the main stem, etc. may also play a role in determining the timing of migration into the beltie tributary. acknowledgements analysis of the data from the counter would not have been possible without the assistance of the middle dee project, and those river pro- prietors and volunteers who established that project and assisted with the operation of the counter. 4.6 | evaluation of the statistical model conflict of interest various compromises were needed when selecting data for the statis- tical analysis, to obtain robust results with limited number of observa- tions. the data were aggregated into counts per day, merging males and females and aggregating all length groups. furthermore, periods, flow and temperature were aggregated into categories to reduce the number of parameters and enable better subsequent evaluation of the parameters in terms of smoothness of curves, as shown in figure 8. if the curves had a smooth overall pattern, that was judged as an indica- tion of reliability. overdispersion and potential zero- inflation in the data made the analysis of count data quite challenging. in the present there is no conflict of interest of any kind for the authors. references akaike, h.
