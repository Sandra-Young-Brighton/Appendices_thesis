the lack of benthic diversity and overwhelming abundance of one taxon (lirceus) most likely contributed to food selection patterns. although isopods are abundant within this tailwater to serve as a forage base, the displacement of native ﬁsh fauna because of the thermal regime of hypolimnetic release from greers ferry reservoir probably serves as a major limitation to brown_trout growth. r. l. johnson1, s. m. coghlan2, t. harmon3 1 department of biological sciences, arkansas state university, state university, arkansas, ar, usa, 2department of wildlife ecology, university of maine, orono, me, usa, 3arkansas depart- ment of environmental quality, el dorado, ar, usa key words: prey diversity;

elliott 1970; steingrimsson & gislason 2002). prey size tends to increase as a function of trout size, as a larger gape can accommodate a wider variety of prey sizes and morphologies (newman & waters 1984; bannon & ringler 1986). as trout grow, greater metabolic requirements and prey-handling abilities necessitate inputs of feeding on larger and/or more energy-rich prey. opportunistic drift feeding on a wide range of invertebrate taxa and sizes is considered the norm for adult brown_trout in free ﬂowing rivers (elliott 1973; ringler 1979; bachman 1984). trout in many terrestrial lotic systems require external invertebrates, particularly during the summer, to satisfy energetic demands (nakano et al. 1999; kawaguchi & nakano 2001). additionally, piscivor- ous brown_trout have been demonstrated to possess greater growth than nonpiscivorous trout both in laboratory (elliott & hurley 2000) and ﬁeld settings (grey 2001). poor trout growth often occurs in stream systems possessing suboptimally sized prey (bannon & ringler 1986), unless those streams are characterised doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00230.x 373 johnson et al. by extremely high benthic productivity (steingrimsson & gislason 2002). temperature and ﬂow regimes in free-ﬂowing rivers exert strong control over the distribution and abundance of invertebrate prey available to salmonines (waters 1969; benke et al. 1988; richardson 1993) as well as the energy balances of salmonines (smith & li 1983). however, the ﬂow of tailwaters downstream of dammed reservoirs is episodic and highly variable, and can affect the prey base available for salmonine consumption (gislason 1985; blinn et al. 1995; mckinney et al. 1999) and also the energetic expenditures of salmonines occupying foraging stations (cf. flodmark et al. 2004). for example, the discharge of greers ferry reservoir, arkansas, into the little red river (lrr) can range )1 within minutes (m. logan, from 1 to 185 m3æs usace, personal communication). discharge volumes are dictated by hydroelectric power needs and for ﬂood control purposes; during much of the year, release is limited to several hours during the day. these altered conditions result in low diversity systems, severely disrupting the native fauna (stanford & ward 1989; shaver et al. 1997; johnson & harp 2005). for the release of hypolimnetic waters downstream of impoundments in southern waters has created habitats suitable trout ﬁsheries. however, discharge regimes associated with hydropower production sche- dules may confound natural feeding cycles of these trout, on both daily and seasonal scales (cf. elwood & waters 1969; flodmark et al. 2004). prolonged peri- ods of low ﬂow and the resultant low numbers of drifting macroinvertebrates in this habitat may lead to a benthic mode of trout feeding (tippetts & moyle 1978; mckinney & speas 2001). conversely, pro- longed periods of sequential ﬂooding and dewatering may scour the benthos and reduce invertebrate production (gislason 1985; blinn et al. 1995) and also suppress salmonine feeding (cf. elwood & waters 1969; flodmark et al. 2004). our objectives were threefold: ﬁrst, to determine prey utilisation of brown_trout in a cold tailwater relative to available benthos; second, to investigate prey utilisation by various size classes of brown_trout; and third, to study seasonal changes in feeding patterns. thermal regime and the resultant macroinvertebrate assemblages show temporal and some spatial consis- tency within the upper reaches of the greers ferry tailwater (johnson & harp 2005). we therefore expected similar temporal and spatial consistencies for prey diversity and selectivity in this stream relative to brown_trout studies of unregulated rivers. study areas two sites were selected 3 and 7 km downstream of greers ferry dam in the tailwaters of greers ferry 374 temperatures are relatively constant lake. water the year, ranging from 7.5° to 9.5 °c throughout upstream and 7.5° to 12.0 °c downstream. in addition to temperature differences, habitat differences exist between sites (large midchannel pool above upstream site, long glide above downstream site; nomenclature as per mccain et al. 1990). previous research has identiﬁed some spatial differences in benthic macro- invertebrates among these sites, with signiﬁcantly greater numerical abundance upstream and species diversity downstream (johnson & harp 2005). in addition to brown_trout, which have established naturally reproducing populations and are no longer stocked, three other species of trout have been stocked including rainbow trout, oncorhynchus annually, mykiss (walbaum) (375,000 stocked annually), cut- throat trout, oncorhynchus clarki (walbaum) (50,000 annually) and brook_trout, salvelinus_fontinalis mitc- hill) (10,000 annually). size of stocked trouts typically ranges from 175 to 325 mm, with rainbow and brook_trouts stocked in the ﬁrst 20 km of the tailwater and brook and cutthroat trout stocked within the ﬁrst several km (including our upstream site). since the completion of this study, stocking of cutthroat trout has ceased (d. bowman, arkansas game and fish commission (ag & fc), pers. comm.). non-salmonines are rare within the upper reaches of the greers ferry tailwater, as during a year of monthly electroﬁshing only ﬁve non-salmonine individuals were taken, and those individuals were collected at the downstream site (unpublished data). hourly discharge volumes during the study period (september 1999 to august 2000; m. logan, usace, )1. unpublished data) ranged from 0.1 to 33.4 m3æs monthly ﬂow resulting from discharge ranged from a low of 3.7% of the time during december to a maximum of 71.8% for the month of june (annual mean ﬂow ¼ 33.3%). during the months of november, december and february, discharge was limited to base ﬂow because of dam leakage for 90% of the time. brown_trout spawning in the lrr occurs during the months of november and december. materials and methods collection and analysis of brown_trout thirty brown_trout (10 each of <200, 200–300 and 300–400 mm total length, tl) were collected monthly from each site at night from september 1999 through august 2000 via backpack and boat electroshockers with the assistance of the ag&fc. the <200 mm size class may encompass a potentially large shift in diet as trout emerge in march and grow rapidly to the parr stage. however, within months for the seasonal data sets, there is little variability in size. for example, during the spring, summer and fall samples, all brown trout <200 mm were young of year, ranging in size from 30 to 55 mm during spring sampling (march to may; mean ¼ 42.8 mm), 59–110 mm tl during summer (june to august; mean ¼ 79.7 mm) and 97– 163 mm during fall sampling (september to novem- ber; mean ¼ 123.5 mm). the winter sample of <200 mm brown_trout had a mix of young of year individuals (december) and age-1 individuals (january and february). total lengths ranged from 102 to 171 mm (mean ¼ 135.6 mm). evening sampling was performed to take advantage of the presumed crepuscular feeding activity of brown_trout (allan 1978). the stomachs of 710 brown_trout were removed, injected with 50% formalin, and then preserved in 10% formalin for enumeration and identiﬁcation of stomach contents. long-term storage was in 70% ethanol. prey items were identiﬁed to at least genus (except for chironomids, oligochaetes, turbellarians and hirudineans) and enumerated. we did not evacuation rates of different prey items within our analyses, so our con- sumption estimates merely reﬂect stomach contents. consider differing gastric collection of benthos the ﬂow dynamics of because of this tailwater, benthos was collected rather than drift for determining available trout forage. preliminary drift samples were comprised primarily of isopoda and amphipoda, reﬂective of the more motile macroinvertebrates available in the benthos. five random samples of macroinvertebrate assemblages for both sites were taken monthly during low dam discharge within rifﬂes at both sites using a portable invertebrate box sampler (0.10 m2; 0.35 mm mesh size) at a depth of 15 cm. specimens were preserved in 10% formalin, identiﬁed to at least genus (except for the chironomids, oligo- chaetes, turbellarians and hirudineans), enumerated and stored in 70% ethanol. preliminary data analysis and descriptive statistics exploratory data analyses (see below) indicated relative homogeneity in both diet and prey metrics among months within each season (fall, winter, spring and summer). therefore, we pooled monthly data (n ¼ 15 samples) by season, thus increasing statistical power and simplifying analyses. abundances of macroinver- tebrates, both in the benthos and in diets of brown_trout, were log transformed (log x + 1) to reduce the effects of extreme values. we calculated seasonal averages of total taxa richness (r) and shannon–wiener diversity index (h¢¼) pi ln pi) of benthic macroinvertebrates by site, and of prey consumed by brown_trout by site and predator size class. for prey consumption data, we originally intended to test for spatial (upstream vs. p spatial and temporal variation in prey selection downstream) and seasonal effects in abundance, rich- ness and diversity of consumed macroinvertebrates with multiple analyses of covariance (ancovas), using trout size as a covariate. however, a signiﬁcant interaction between site and size compromised the validity of ancova (zar 1999); therefore, we used multiple anovas testing for effects of season and size class on prey consumption data, separate for each site. we used similar anovas to test for seasonal differ- ences abundance, richness and diversity, again stratiﬁed by site. anovas demonstrating signiﬁcance were followed with an a posteriori tukey’s multiple comparison test to investigate treatment and interaction effects. alpha values for statistical tests were set at 0.05. benthic macroinvertebrate in to explore variability within benthic assemblages and trout diets qualitatively, we calculated pairwise percent similarity values (schoener 1970) among all combinations of site/season (for benthos), and site/ season/size class (for diets). the coefﬁcient of variation (cv ¼ standard deviation/mean · 100; zar 1999) was determined for macroinvertebrate density and numer- ical prey consumption, and provided an indication of the magnitude of seasonal change over the study period (grossman et al. 1990). multivariate ordination of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage and trout diet patterns along seasonal and spatial axes was accom- plished using taxa representing >1% of total abundance for assemblage or diet by principal components analysis (pca) of log-transformed abundance data (pc-ord; mjm software, glenedon, or, usa). relating prey availability to prey consumption is the relative abundance of taxa i the strauss electivity index (l; strauss 1979) was calculated to quantify electivity values for major prey taxa. the strauss index is calculated using l ¼ ri)p, where ri is the relative abundance of taxa i in the diet and pi in the environment. values range from +1.0, which indicates a strong selection for a prey item, to )1.0, which indicates a strong selection against a prey item. here, we pooled stomach contents from all individuals within each site/season/size class combination. using the variance term proposed by ready et al. (1985), we conducted multiple pairwise t-tests to determine if electivity values for major prey taxa: (i) differed among size classes within each site (after pooling seasonal data) and (ii) differed between sites during each season (after pooling data from all size classes). we used a bonferroni-adjusted signiﬁcance value to control for multiple comparisons (a/n; zar 1999). percent similarity was used for comparing benthic assemblages to trout diets. spearman rank correlation coefﬁcients were derived for benthic numerical abun- dance versus diet abundance for taxa representing 375 johnson et al. table 1. seasonal numerical and diversity indices for benthic macroinver- tebrates of upstream and downstream sites in the greers ferry tailwater, arkansas. site, season taxa richness density (no./0.1 m2) shannon–wiener upstream fall winter spring summer totals downstream fall winter summer spring totals 7 9 10 5 12 9 11 12 9 14 89.9 144.7 108.8 110.5 111.7 (11.4) 67.3 85.8 124.1 76.8 87.4 (12.5) 1.05 1.18 1.03 0.85 1.09 1.08 1.55 1.14 1.34 1.43 standard errors are in parentheses. >1% of totals, and also for benthic diversity versus diet diversity, by month. results macroinvertebrate assemblages the lrr can be the macroinvertebrate fauna of characterised as low diversity and low density (table 1). total taxa richness was similar spatially, yet varied seasonally, particularly upstream. shannon– wiener diversity values were reﬂective of this low taxa richness (overall h’ of 1.09 and 1.43 for upstream and downstream, respectively), and were signiﬁcantly greater downstream (p ¼ 0.04). macroinvertebrate densities were low and were signiﬁcantly greater upstream than downstream (p ¼ 0.02), with overall mean numerical abundances of 111.7 (±11.4 se) individuals per 0.1 m2 upstream versus 87.4 (12.5) individuals per 0.1 m2 downstream (table 1). there were no seasonal effects on numerical abundance for upstream (f3,50 ¼ 2.07, p ¼ 0.11) or downstream samples (f3,54 ¼ 1.72, p ¼ 0.17). cv for numerical abundance, which measured seasonal variability, was similarly low for both sites (cv ¼ 18 upstream, 25 downstream;

figs 3 and 4). number of prey consumed per brown_trout upstream was almost twofold that of downstream (x ¼ 61.4 upstream, x ¼ 33.2 downstream; table 4; t-test, p ¼ 0.03). very few sampled ﬁsh had empty stomachs (2.1% upstream; 0.5% downstream). however, brown_trout utilised few taxa as prey, with upstream and downstream trout consuming a mean of approximately 2.25 prey taxa (h’ ¼ 0.625 upstream, 1.012 downstream). prey s.w. diversity values were similar among sites (p ¼ 0.15). thirteen taxa were utilised for food by upstream brown_trout as compared with 20 taxa by downstream trout. lirceus comprised 81% and 71% of all prey consumed by upstream and downstream trout, respect- ively (fig. 3). overall, isopods, amphipods and gas- tropods comprised 99% of the trout diet upstream and 88% of the diet downstream. chironomids represented <2.0% of the brown_trout diet upstream yet 7.0% downstream. consumption of terrestrial invertebrates (one lepidopteran larva upstream; one gryllid, one lepidopteran larva, and 13 formicids downstream) and the aerial stages of aquatic insects was rare (<1.0%), particularly upstream. piscivory (cannibalism of age- 0+ brown_trout) was also rare, occurring only in downstream trout and in <1% of individuals sampled. there was a 92% similarity of diet among sites with slight differences because of a higher consumption of pca 1 gastropods, brown_trout eggs and chironomids by downstream trout. size and seasonal effects of brown_trout consumption numerical consumption was signiﬁcantly related to brown_trout size upstream (p < 0.01) and downstream (p ¼ 0.04; table 4). a comparison among size groups using tukey’s multiple comparison test demonstrated that both larger size classes contained more prey items than the smallest size class upstream and downstream (p < 0.01), yet there were no signiﬁcant differences in consumption among the two larger size classes. size for independent of however, prey selection by brown_trout of the lrr the upstream site was (x ¼ 93% similarity among size groups) and was more variable for brown_trout downstream (x ¼ 80% similarity; table 5). percent similarities among sizes were signiﬁcantly greater for brown_trout of the upstream versus the downstream site (p < 0.01). diversity of prey increased with increasing trout size upstream, yet s.w. diversity indices of all size classes were below 1.00 (table 4). downstream, trout in the middle size class had the lowest s.w. values. however, there were signiﬁcant increases in number of prey taxa consumed with the larger size groups (p < 0.01 upstream; p ¼ 0.04 downstream). chironomids com- prised a large component of the emerging lrr brown_trout (spring sample, size range 30–55 mm tl) diet downstream, and were gradually replaced by isopods as the dominant food source. during the winter, chironomids still represented 38% of the downstream (physa) <200 mm brown_trout diet. gastropods became a part of the diet when brown_trout reached a length of 80 mm, and became more prevalent within the diets of the larger trout size groups upstream. 377 johnson et al. table 4. seasonal and size effects on brown_trout feeding in the greers ferry tailwater, arkansas, including mean number of taxa consumed, number of prey in stomach, shannon–wiener diversity index and percent similarity of consumption versus available benthos. site, season/ size (mm) taxa richness prey in stomachs shannon– wiener % similarity upstream fall <200 201–300 301–400 winter <200 201–300 301–400 spring <200 201–300 301–400 summer <200 201–300 301–400 totals <200 201–300 301–400 downstream fall <200 201–300 301–400 winter <200 201–300 301–400 spring <200 201–300 301–400 summer <200 201–300 301–400 totals <200 201–300 301–400 2.46 (0.09) 1.72 (0.12) 2.55 (0.14) 2.83 (0.14) 2.18 (0.10) 1.48 (0.09) 2.26 (0.18) 2.93 (0.12) 2.12 (0.10) 1.43 (0.10) 2.35 (0.13) 2.67 (0.16) 2.34 (0.11) 1.81 (0.13) 2.81 (0.20) 2.50 (0.17) 2.28 (0.04) 1.63 (0.06) 2.48 (0.08) 2.72 (0.08) 1.96 (0.09) 1.45 (0.12) 2.43 (0.16) 1.91 (0.15) 2.08 (0.07) 1.54 (0.11) 2.38 (0.15) 2.27 (0.22) 2.32 (0.15) 1.36 (0.12) 2.50 (0.27) 3.10 (0.33) 2.93 (0.14) 2.25 (0.19) 3.47 (0.20) 3.16 (0.28) 2.32 (0.06) 1.66 (0.08) 2.67 (0.10) 2.62 (0.13) 58.9 (5.3) 14.7 (1.9) 73.7 (8.0) 72.3 (9.7) 69.7 (7.8) 11.7 (1.5) 84.8 (12.4) 120.4 (14.6) 81.3 (10.5) 4.2 (0.4) 118.0 (16.8) 109.6 (19.5) 41.9 (3.5) 26.4 (4.5) 50.2 (5.3) 49.5 (6.6) 61.4 (3.5) 14.3 (1.5) 82.9 (6.1) 84.1 (6.5) prey consumed 28.7 (3.7) 16.7 (4.6) 46.9 (7.4) 14.5 (23.1) 44.9 (6.3) 16.4 (5.4) 61.6 (9.7) 50.4 (15.7) 26.7 (4.4) 4.5 (0.7) 26.2 (5.0) 26.5 (4.4) 35.9 (3.1) 28.6 (4.3) 46.3 (5.2) 30.6 (6.3) 33.2 (2.2) 23.7 (2.9) 39.0 (4.2) 33.3 (4.4) 0.71 0.52 0.66 0.79 0.61 0.56 0.50 0.71 0.58 0.70 0.53 0.61 0.60 0.42 0.65 0.78 0.63 0.55 0.58 0.72 0.79 0.61 0.63 1.25 0.93 0.97 0.69 1.05 1.16 0.83 0.79 1.20 1.17 0.82 1.16 1.31 1.01 1.00 0.86 1.30 69 70 78 82 75 77 39 63 65 61 standard errors are in parentheses. there was a signiﬁcant effect of season (p < 0.01) on numerical prey consumption for each of the three trout size classes at each site (table 4). consumption of prey by brown_trout <200 mm demonstrated the summer > fall ¼ winter > following signiﬁcances: spring in both upstream and downstream sites (both p < 0.05). trout size may be the more important explanatory variable for prey consumption as com- pared with the spring season, as discussed previously. cv as a function of season was also greatest with this smallest size class (cv ¼ 55 upstream, 51 down- stream), consistent with the rapid growth typical of age-0 trout. prey consumption for 200–300 mm trout 378 (a) s h c a m o t s n i y e r p . o n 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 a b c a b c a b c a b c fall   winter    spring   summer other amphipods gastropods isopods (b) s h c a m o t s n i y e r p . o n 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 a b c a b c a b c a b c fall   winter    spring   summer other amphipods gastropods isopods fig. 3. brown_trout diets by size (a, < 200 mm;

table 4). diets of upstream trout in the summer and fall had greater prey diversity values than other seasons for these size classes at both sites. prey composition was also seasonally constant for upstream brown_trout for each size class sampled (table 6). seasonal percent similarities ranged from 89–97% for these trout. downstream trout <200 mm were more seasonally variable in their prey consump- tion than upstream trout (p < 0.01). for example, seasonal similarities were as low as 37% for brown_trout < 200 mm (fall vs. spring). following trout emergence in march, chironomids represented 67% of the downstream age-0 spring diets, yet, only 7.0% of the fall diets. additionally, during the two sampling months of november and december, eggs nominally comprised only 1.0% of the upstream trout diets, yet, spatial and temporal variation in prey selection 17.8% of the downstream trout diets for all trout sampled. conversely, downstream brown_trout of 200– 300 mm were quite similar in seasonal analysis (range 89–97% similar). prey consumption as a function of available benthos seasonally, relations between benthic numerical abun- dance and trout diets were discordant upstream, yet concordant downstream (tables 1 and 4; fig. 4). slightly higher abundances of benthic macroinverte- brates were observed during the winter upstream, yet consumption of macroinvertebrates was greatest dur- ing the spring. summer samples showed the greatest discordance within the upstream data sets, where consumption rates were particularly low despite high numerical abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates. seasonal correlation analysis of benthic density and prey consumption showed no signiﬁcant relations upstream (rs ¼ 0.58) or downstream (rs ¼ 0.19). relations between benthic diversities and diet diversity were also inconsistent (tables 1 and 4; fig. 5). whereas benthic diversity was greatest during the winter for both sites and declined through summer, diet diversity was highest during the summer upstream and the fall downstream. correlation analysis of y t i s r e v i  d w s 1.6 1.4 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 1.55 1.18 0.93 0.61 1.08 1.05 0.79 0.71 1.34 1.16 1.03 0.58 1.17 1.14 0.85 0.6 fall winter spring summer up-benthos up-prey down-benthos down-prey fig. 5. seasonal comparison of benthic macroinvertebrate and diet shannon–wiener diversities of brown_trout upstream (up) and downstream (down) sites in greers ferry tailwater, arkansas. table 6. matrix of seasonal similarity comparisons for prey of brown_trout of greers ferry tailwater, arkansas. <200 mm 201–300 mm 301–400 mm fall **** 67 37 73 fall winter spring summer winter spring summer fall winter spring summer fall winter spring summer 92 **** 70 77 95 97 **** 47 96 95 97 **** **** 93 97 89 93 **** 95 90 94 92 **** 92 95 94 89 **** **** 77 83 94 93 **** 95 85 94 90 **** 86 94 91 93 **** upstream site comparisons are above the diagonal;

selection for gastro- pods, trout. downstream trout diet electivity was more common: selection for isopods, medium > small > large trout; selection for large > medium > small 380 large > medium > small gastropods, trout; selection for amphipods, large > small ¼ medium trout; and, avoidance for chironomids and simulium, medium ¼ large > small trout. overall percent similarity of brown_trout diet versus benthic macroinvertebrates present was 75% upstream and 62% downstream. pca analysis further supports the greater similarity of the upstream benthos and prey compositions (fig. 2). these high similarities for both sites, and particularly upstream, are driven largely by the dominance of isopods in both the benthos and brown_trout diets. trout diet electivity by site and season at p < 0.001: selection for isopods during winter, down- stream > upstream trout; selection for gastropods during spring and summer, downstream > upstream trout; avoidance of chironomids during winter and summer, downstream > upstream trout; and, avoid- ance of simulium during spring and summer, down- stream > upstream. signiﬁcances following showed the discussion prey utilisation versus available benthos cold hypolimnetic release from newly created reser- voirs disrupts the native fauna of a stream system, leaving behind a remnant fauna tolerant of year-round cold temperatures but also prone to colonisation by tolerant dispersers from other watersheds. large differences in invertebrate species composition have been identiﬁed in stream reaches above and below reservoirs (spence & hynes 1971; johnson & harp 2005). most macroinvertebrate taxa native to the southern us are not well adapted to chronic low temperatures, and thus recently created tailwaters in this region should contain relatively depauperate benthic communities. accordingly, the benthos of the greers ferry tailwater was dominated by few taxa of relatively high abundance. four taxa accounted for approximately 90% of the benthic macroinvertebrates. the low diversity we observed for both sampling periods is consistent with studies of other cold tailwaters (pﬁtzer 1962; blanz et al. 1969; shaver et al. 1997) and subarctic free-ﬂowing rivers (e.g. steingrimsson & gislason 2002). for taxa except notably absent among the benthic macroinverte- brates were insect the dipterans chironomidae and simuliidae. various local species of ephemeroptera, plecoptera and trichoptera (ept) are abundant upstream in the lrr (a. christian, asu, personal communication) and nearby watersheds (johnson et al. 2000; mccord 2006), yet cannot complete their life cycles in persistently cold environ- ments, having evolved locally in seasonally warm streams (johnson & harp 2005). hence, despite the potential for aerial dispersal via adults, a local source of chronic cold-tolerant ept colonisers is not available for this system. other studies of macroinvertebrate assemblages within cold tailwaters in the southern u.s. have demonstrated similarly low ept values (blanz et al. 1969; blinn et al. 1995; weiland & hayward 1997), whereas regulated rivers farther north (e.g. the delaware, mongaup, salmon, and owasco rivers in new york) generally are rich in ept taxa (s.m. coghlan, unpublished data) because isopods are relatively indigestible and energy-poor relative to aquatic insects common in unregulated trout streams (cf. cummins & wuycheck 1971), perhaps brown_trout in the greers ferry tailwater compensate for low prey quality by ingesting large quantities of prey (cf. bannon & ringler 1986; but see steingrimsson & gislason 2002). adult isopods were abundant as prey year-round at both sites, and thus could provide an energetically poor but temporally reliable food source relative to other invertebrate taxa. furthermore, brown_trout in this study consumed a low diversity of invertebrates and particularly few terrestrial insects compared with other studies (e.g. cada et al. 1986; greenberg & dahl 1998; nakano et al. 1999). thus the low diet diversity and lack of consumption of terrestrial invertebrates by lrr brown_trout are inconsistent with a large volume of literature generated from studies on free-ﬂowing streams, but most likely because of constraints unique to a tailwater habitat prey selection patterns in our study probably reﬂect the relatively depauperate prey base available to trout in cold tailwaters. in the white river, brown_trout fed almost exclusively on the isopod asellus and gammarus (dunn 1998). addi- tionally, mckinney & speas (2001) observed that gammarus and chironomids comprised over 90% of the animal prey of rainbow trout in a cold tailwater in arizona. furthermore, highly ﬂuctuating water levels, extensive housing and resort developments along the stream and steep, eroded banks have reduced the abundance and diversity of riparian vegetation in the immediate vicinity of (cf. mitsch & gosselink 1993). in turn, the abundance and diversity of riparian-zone terrestrial invertebrates that poten- tially could contribute to the drifting forage base is probably low (cf.wilzbach & hall 1985). the river for the positive selection by trout isopods, amphipods, and gastropods is consistent with ﬁndings by cada et al. (1986) and pender & kwak (2002). additionally, the selection against turbellarians and dipterans is consistent with cada et al. (1986). how- ever, pender & kwak (2002) identiﬁed a positive selection for chironomids among age-0 trout, contrary to our data (brown_trout <200 mm). simulium is the dominant prey item of brown_trout in subarctic streams in 2004). iceland (gislason & steingrimsson spatial and temporal variation in prey selection additionally, cada et al. (1986) and pender & kwak (2002) found that oligochaetes were also selected against in their studies; we did not observe enough oligochaetes to test for electivity in this study. numerous studies have also demonstrated a positive selection for terrestrial insects, not shown in our study (see review by hunt 1975). prey utilisation as a function of size size selective feeding by different size groups is often exhibited by brown_trout (e.g.johnson 1981; bannon & ringler 1986; brodeur 1991, although see rincon & lobon-cervia 1999). the ontogenetic shift in diet for the brown_trout of the lrr differs markedly from that of unregulated streams. in unregulated rivers, diets of newly emerged salmonines are dominated by chironomids (allen 1941; miller 1974; hubert & rhodes 1992), shift to larger aquatic insects when trout grow beyond 40 mm (nilsson 1957; mccormack 1962; irvine & northcote 1982), and ﬁnally incorpo- rate ﬁsh at approximately 270 mm (see review by keeley & grant 2001). in this study, chironomids comprised a large component of newly emerged brown_trout diets downstream, and were gradually replaced by isopods, and secondarily gastropods, as dominant food sources. pender (1998) also found a transition in diets of cold tailwater brown_trout from chironomids to isopods when total length was greater than 65 mm. the negligible consumption of chirono- mids (and their abundance in the benthos) upstream (<2%) may be explained in part by differing thermal proﬁles (colder temperatures upstream) and habitats upstream of each site (large mid-channel pool above upstream site, long glide above downstream site). both isopods and gastropods (mean masses of 0.011 and 0.0046 g in the lrr, respectively) represent small- sized prey for brown_trout, and there was a lack of feeding on more energetically proﬁtable prey sources such as terrestrial invertebrates or ﬁshes. consumption of gastropods also represents a benthic mode of feeding, which has also been observed in salmonids of subarctic rivers, where drift rates are low (brittain & eikeland 1988; amundsen et al. 1999; steingrimsson & gislason 2002). presumably, such benthic foraging on energy-poor prey is relatively inefﬁcient and unproﬁtable in comparison to drift-feeding in lotic salmonines (e.g. fausch et al. 1997). the lack of piscivory or feeding on larger inverte- brates (e.g. crayﬁsh) is readily explained by the paucity of such prey in this system. as previously stated, nonsalmonines are rare within the upper reaches of the greers ferry tailwater. therefore, prey must consist of available macroinvertebrates or other salmonines (e.g. cannibalism of young brown_trout or stocked trout ranging in size from 200 to 300 mm total 381 johnson et al. length). however, since the completion of our study there has been an unauthorised introduction of ozark sculpin cottus hypselurus (robins and robison) into greers ferry tailwater, and this species is now occasionally seen at the upstream site. a contributing factor to the low levels of cannibalism observed might be the dense mats of eurasian milfoil (myriophyllum spicatum) within the river, which not only provides a food source for the herbivores (isopods and amphi- pods) which are then consumed by brown_trout, but also serves as cover for juvenile brown_trout (cf. gregory & levings 1996; maki-petays et al. 1997). despite the ontogenetic changes in diet, we found high similarity of diets among sizes, indicating high diet overlap (consistent with diets of rainbow trout in another cold tailwater; mckinney & speas 2001). signiﬁcant overlap in diets among different age classes of trout has also been observed in other studies (e.g. johnson 1981; bozek et al. 1994). feeding as a function of season seasonal variation in trout diet is largely a function of seasonal variation in available prey (elliott 1967; hunt & jones 1972; allan 1981). thermal proﬁles and the resultant macroinvertebrate assemblages show tem- poral and spatial consistency within regulated cold tailwaters (blanz et al. 1969; johnson & harp 2005). we therefore expected and identiﬁed similar temporal and spatial consistencies for prey diversity and selectivity in this stream relative to brown_trout studies of unregulated rivers. weiland and hayward (cf. 1997) and mckinney and speas (cf. 2001) also observed little seasonal variation in the diets of rainbow trout in cold tailwaters. in summary, cold tailwater systems are greatly modiﬁed from unregulated streams. flow regimes are episodic and often conﬂict with natural feeding cycles of brown_trout. benthic assemblages and brown_trout diets exhibited low diversity, with isopods numerically dominant. assemblages and brown_trout diets were seasonally constant, and diet was largely independent of trout size. notably absent among prey common to brown_trout in unregulated streams were ﬁshes and terrestrial insects. acknowledgements this research was funded by the arkansas game and fish commission federal aid to sport fish restoration project f-39-r. we are thankful for the assistance with collection of trout by t. bly and s. todd of the arkansas game and fish commission, and to g. harp, arkansas state university, for assistance with identiﬁcation of invertebrates. helpful insight in manuscript review was provided by g. harp, s. todd and anonymous reviewers, to whom we are most grateful. 382 references allan, j.d. 1978. trout predation and the size composition of stream drift. limnology and oceanography 23: 1231–1237. allan, j.d. 1981. determinants of diet of brook_trout (salveli- nus fontinalis) in a mountain stream. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 38: 184–192. allen, k.r. 1941. studies on the biology of the early stages of the salmon (salmo_salar): 2, feeding habits. journal of animal ecology 10: 47–76. amundsen, p.a., bergersen, r., huru, h. & heggberget, t.g. 1999. diel feeding rhythms and daily food consumption of juvenile atlantic salmon in the alta river, northern norway. journal of fish biology 54: 58–71. bachman, r.a. 1984. foraging behavior of free-ranging wild and hatchery brown_trout in a stream. transactions of the american fisheries society 113: 1–32. bannon, e. & ringler, n.h. 1986. optimal prey size for stream tests of predictive resident brown_trout models. canadian journal of zoology 64: 704–713.
