p ¼ 0.60) between the two time periods; whereas, ﬁsh community structure (abundance) differed (r > 0.50; p £ 0.10). increased abundances of desirable species like gizzard shad dorosoma cepedianum (lesueur), white crappie pomoxis annularis (raﬁnesque), black crappie pomoxis nigromaculatus (lesueur) and largemouth bass micropterus salmoides (lacepede), coupled with declines of less desirable species like common carp cyprinus carpio (linnaeus) contributed to community changes. these changes suggest positive responses to water stabilisation practices that may act as an intermediate step in restoring river–ﬂoodplain function in certain situations. key words: ﬁsh community;

weigers et al. 1990; thompson 2002; hanﬂing et al. 2004). many of these changes are a direct result of various management practices designed to meet human needs including ﬂood control, power generation, navigation, irrigation and recreation. dominant management prac- tices used to meet these needs have typically involved altering ﬂow and habitat availability through impound- ment, channelisation, leveeing and water diversion (thompson 2002), but all of these practices have far ranging temporal and spatial impacts on the physical and biological processes that deﬁne a given ecosys- tem. for example, biotic changes can range from local changes in community composition and/or structure to broader extirpations of species or entire communities and changes in fundamental processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, bioenergetics, etc.). the effects of these modiﬁcations are beginning to be ameliorated in some systems and while the science of restoring large rivers is relatively young, attempts to repair damaged systems because of human impacts are emerging in several places around the world (wissmar & bisson 2003). for example, the environmental management program (emp) in the upper mississippi focused on restoring natural river system has resources within the upper mississippi and the habitat illinois rivers since 1986. speciﬁcally, 40 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00118.x rehabilitation and enhancement program (hrep) portion of the emp has targeted restoring and protecting ﬁsh and wildlife habitat mainly in the form of projects designed to address needs for increased ﬂoodplain habitat quantity and quality, improved water quality, reconnected channels with their ﬂoodplains and ﬂow or water-level remediation. one such example of the hrep and how ﬁsh communities initially respond to ﬂow and/or water-level stabilisa- tion is the north pool lake chautauqua project along the illinois river. the present-day hydrograph of the mainstem illinois river is heavily inﬂuenced by water-level management practices that can cause daily water-level ﬂuctuations in excess of 0.25-m in both the main channel and its connected backwaters; whereas, these ﬂuctuations did not occur prior to dam construction and other manipulations in the early 1900s (see sparks et al. 1998 for a full discussion). for example, water elevations on the illinois river near north pool lake chautauqua prior to water-level management, as represented by the data from 1880 in fig. 1, showed a distinct pattern of a spring ﬂood followed by a stable water period in the summer and fall that is typical of unimpacted, temperate rivers (ward & stanford 1995). conversely, water elevations under the current man- agement represented by the 1990 data (fig. 1), showed a variable summer and fall period that is counter to conditions in which native ﬁshes and other aquatic organisms evolved (junk et al. 1989). many aquatic habitat quantity and quality issues that translate into negative impacts on biota can be directly correlated to these untimely extreme ﬂuctuations (bain et al. 1988). scheme, ) m ( s n o l i t a v e e r e t a w y l i a d e g a r e v a 136 135 134 133 132 131 130 129 1880 1990 0 50 100 200 150 calendar day 250 300 350 400 fig. 1. representative hydrographs of the illinois river near north pool lake chautauqua at havana, illinois. water-level elevations are daily means above mean sea level. the 1880 hydrograph is representative of annual water levels prior to water-level manage- ment. the 1990 hydrograph represents postwater-level manage- ment hydrological conditions. fish community response to restoration one remedial approach used on the illinois river has been to protect ﬂoodplain habitat by renovation of existing levees around ﬂoodplain lakes. these reno- vated levees are used to protect the ﬂoodplain lake from extreme water-level conditions that currently exist in the mainstem river by providing no, or limited, access between the river and ﬂoodplain lake through a managed control point (usually a stop-log control structure). this approach is considerably unorthodox under the premise of the flood-pulse concept (junk et al. 1989) and other current paradigms for ﬂoodplain rivers in that, the practice is to isolate the ﬂoodplain lake to restore or protect it. furthermore, re-establish- ing connectivity of a river to its ﬂoodplain is central to restoring many of the processes that make these systems so productive (welcomme 1979; gutrueter et al. 2000; sommer et al. 2004). nevertheless, this approach is currently one of the prevailing habitat restoration or enhancement policies used in situations where constructed levees exist along the illinois river. the north pool lake chautauqua was one such area along the illinois river that was targeted by the hrep for establishing stable water levels through renovation of existing levees. historically, lake chautauqua, a 1450-ha illinois river ﬂoodplain lake, was comprised of a mosaic of deep-water side channels to shallow pools and exposed soil areas (starrett & fritz 1965). much of the area was leveed to facilitate agriculture in the early 1900s, but was purchased by the u.s. department of interior and became part of the national refuge system in 1936. the levees were maintained to provide some water- level management, but the lake was generally allowed a permanent connection to the illinois river forming lake chautauqua et al. 1997). noticeable declines in habitat quality became evi- dent by the 1960s, and a cross-lake levee, dividing the lake into a north pool and south pool, was level and constructed in 1969 to combat water sediment that reduced viable habitat. the levee was breeched and signiﬁcantly damaged during ﬂood events in 1970 to the extent that the levee was not viable for water-level management thereafter. the end result was a degraded system that among other problems, was subjected to excessive sedimentation rates and the highly variable water levels of the illinois river. lake chautauqua remained in this condition until 1997 when the hrep completed a construction plan that provided cross-lake levee repairs to allow water- level management in north pool lake chautauqua to create and protect aquatic habitats within the lake. therefore, our objective was to examine the ﬁsh community responses in the north pool lake chautauqua following hrep construction. speciﬁc- ally, we assessed changes in community composition from the mainstem river inputs (irons 41 pegg et al. (presence/absence) and structure (relative abundance) between pre and post-hrep project data. materials and methods our data collection efforts focused on gathering information that characterised changes in the ﬁsh community of the north pool lake chautauqua in response to hrep construction. the ensuing sampling scheme resulted in two ﬁsh collection periods. the ﬁrst sample period (1991–1993) was used to deﬁne the existing preconstruction ﬁsh community; whereas, the second sample period (2000–2002) reﬂected the postconstruction ﬁsh community. fish were collected from three ﬁxed sites along the shoreline to characterise the near-shore ﬁsh community. collection gears and methods followed standardised techniques used for the long term resource monitor- ing program (ltrmp; gutrueter et al. 1995) and typically included day electroﬁsher, fyke nets and minnow fyke nets. electroﬁshing runs were 15 min in duration, and all nets were set for one 24-h period. target sample sizes for each gear were two electroﬁsh- ing runs or two net sets of each net type per site, three times per year corresponding with the ltrmp ﬁsh sampling time design that targets annual spring/early summer (june 15–july31), summer (august 1–septem- ber 15) and fall (september 16–october 31) sampling times. catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) for electroﬁshing was calculated as number of ﬁsh caught per 15-min run, and cpue for netting was calculated as number of ﬁsh caught per net day. abundance estimates were typically averaged among sites to characterise the ﬁsh commu- nity of the entire lake where appropriate. we also used gill nets at one open water site each year to characterise similarity in the lake chautauqua ﬁsh population among dominant habitats (e.g., near- shore and open water). the sample size and timing for the gill net sampling followed that of the near shore sampling. water levels during the preconstruction period were variable and intermittently connected to the illinois river. ultimately these unstable water levels precluded a full complement of gears in some table 1. summary of effort used to collect ﬁsh during pre (1991–1993) and post (2000–2002) construction of

however, the levee repairs did establish relatively stable water levels that allowed a full suite of sampling during the postconstruction period. data analyses tests for differences between pre and postconstruction communities were performed using multivariate tech- niques such as analysis of similarity (anosim) and graphically illustrated using cluster analysis for both community composition (presence/absence) and struc- ture (relative abundance). analyses of community composition that required similarity information used euclidean distances to develop the data matrix. community structure similarity information was esti- mated using bray–curtis coefﬁcients to indicate the similarity of two samples, with higher coefﬁcient values indicating higher degrees of similarity (bray & curtis 1957). all sample abundance data were fourth- root transformed to meet assumptions of multivariate normality and to moderate the inﬂuence of species abundance extremes. the transformed sample data were then used to create a similarity matrix calculated for all pair-wise sample comparisons. patterns in compositional and structural changes in ﬁsh commu- nities were then identiﬁed using sas (sas institute inc. 1999) and primer (v5; primer-e ltd 2001). a resulting test was typically declared signiﬁcant at p £ 0.10 unless otherwise noted. results a total of 77,341 ﬁsh representing 54 species and three hybrids were collected during the pre and postcon- struction periods. both pre and postconstruction sample periods collected 46 species with eight unique species collected each period (table 2). three of the unique species caught during the postconstruction period (bighead carp hypophthalmichlys nobilis rich- ardson, silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix val- enciennes, white perch morone americana gmelin) were non-native species that became established in the la grange reach of the illinois river during or after the levee renovation. species compositions were nearly identical between the two sample periods and the anosim test for differences in species composition between the two sample periods indicated no signiﬁcant difference (r ¼ 0.019; p ¼ 0.50) between pre and postconstruc- tion. however, there does appear to be some subtle interannual variability both within and among the two sample periods (fig. 2). community composition analyses revealed little

collective assessment approach like that used for the community composition analyses. therefore, gear- speciﬁc analyses are presented. tests (anosim) comparing pre and postconstruction electroﬁshing data showed the ﬁsh community struc- ture was different between the two time periods (r ¼ 0.75; p ¼ 0.10; fig. 3a). changes in abun- dances that most contributed to this difference were gizzard shad dorosoma cepedianum (lesueur) whose relative abundances (cpue) increased from 23.3 to 360.7, white crappie pomoxis annularis (raﬁnesque) increased from 0.1 to 10.2, largemouth bass micro- pterus salmoides (lacepede) increased from 2.2 to 13.9 and common carp cyprinus carpio (linnaeus) decreased from 20.5 to 5.8 individuals per electro- ﬁshing run (table 2). fyke nets also showed a difference in community structure between the sample periods (r ¼ 0.926, p ¼ 0.10; fig. 3b). major contributions to this differ- ence include an increase in relative abundance for white crappie (4.9–45.8 per net), black crappie [pomoxis nigromaculatus (lesueur); 11.1–32.6 per net], and a decrease in common carp (7.6–0.9 per net; table 2). the anosim test for differences between commu- nities using minnow fyke nets was also signiﬁcant (r ¼ 0.22; p ¼ 0.10; fig. 3c) with differences in community structure mainly focused around increases in gizzard shad (4.5–357.3 per net), bluegill lepomis macrochirus (raﬁnesque; 0.2–16.0 per net), bullhead minnow pimephales vigilax (baird and girard; 0.6– 9.0 per net) and emerald shiner (notropis atherinoides raﬁnesque; 1.7–13.9) abundances. decreases in com- mon carp abundances (1.3–0.6 per net) also contribu- ted to the change in community structure (table 2). characterisation of the open water area using gill nets also showed differences between pre and post- construction (r ¼ 0.44; p ¼ 0.10; fig. 3d) indicating a shift in the open water ﬁsh community. this shift was due in large part to increases in white crappie (0.0–16.8 per net), white bass

ward & stanford 1995). levees and how they inﬂuence native ecosystems are generally perceived as negative elements of the landscape from a biological perspec- tive, especially when considering aquatic organisms and their access to all habitat types (bayley 1991; bravard & petts 1996). consequently, renovation or establishment of levees around a ﬂoodplain lake to facilitate recovery of aquatic habitat and aquatic communities is counterintuitive, seemingly contra- dictory of other restoration goals, and is ultimately at the apex of a paradox that provides quality habitat for many organisms that respond positively as we reported here, yet is prohibitive in allowing a ﬂoodplain lake to play a functional the ﬂoodplain and river. role in the remainder of there are also concerns about risks associated with levee renovations given multiyear or multidecade restoration time frames. the long-term goal of most river restoration efforts is to regain important func- tional components that once naturally occurred in a given lotic system prior to its manipulation. this goal includes ﬂoodplain lake connectivity, and many river restoration initiatives contain some component of levee removal where they are present (national research council 1992; davis & ogden 1994; hargrove et al. 2002). however, these levees can become institutionalised which in turn may stall or prevent continuation of a restoration effort. this clearly leads to the need for judicious and limited use of leveed ﬂoodplain lakes as only a ﬁrst step in protecting or creating suitable aquatic habitat in strategic areas until larger landscape-level processes are repaired. levee renovation techniques should not be used or considered as a comprehensive means to ﬂoodplain restoration. rather, this approach should be only a stop-gap measure used among other measures to re-establish ﬂoodplain ecosystem function. the species composition of north pool lake chau- tauqua exhibited some slight differences with eight unique species collected each time period, but no signiﬁcant shifts in species composition were observed. however, some minor discrepancies in species compo- sition can be explained by the establishment of three non-native ﬁsh species, bighead carp, silver carp (chick & pegg 2001) and white perch (irons et al. 2002), in the illinois river after the preconstruction period. initial assessments of the ﬁsh community compo- sition of the north pool may lead to a conclusion that little has changed in response to the hrep construc- tion at lake chautauqua because there was little change in species richness. while the composition did not signiﬁcantly change, a likely more ecologically meaningful assessment of the ﬁsh community is to look at changes in ﬁsh community structure. relat- ively rapid and signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to habitat availability and stabilisation occurred in north pool lake chautauqua that led to every gear showing resounding increases in desired sport, commercial and fish community response to restoration forage species coupled with a decline in undesirable species like common carp. these unanimous results suggest a positive initial response by the ﬁsh commu- nity to the stable water levels. generally, abiotic factors that inﬂuence the presence of an individual species in a given lotic system is inﬂuenced by habitat composition and habitat stability preferences (grossman et al. 1982; schlosser 1985). the resulting suite of sustained species then evolve to form the basic community structure, in a given system, in response to these conditions. in simple terms, ﬁsh assemblages can be predicted based on the stability of driving environmental conditions with a fairly high degree of certainty following paradigms like south- wood’s (1977) habitat template. the basic premise is that ﬁsh assemblages in stable environments will support species that rely upon stable resources. this assemblage will usually consist of both long- and short-lived species (townsend & hildrew 1994). conversely, highly variable environments will support an opportunistic ﬁsh assemblage that can take advantage of resources as they become available (poff 1992; townsend & hildrew 1994; poff & allan 1995). assemblages in highly variable environments will typically be dominated by short lived species or species that are not desirable (e.g., common carp). prior to hrep construction, water levels in north pool lake chautauqua were subjected to highly variable water levels that were more conducive to the estab- lishment and propagation of less desirable species that exhibited opportunistic life histories. while this included ﬁsh native to the region it also typically meant high abundances of non-native species like common carp. however, once stable water levels were established, species native to the illinois river were able to respond positively by establishing populations in an environment that likely more closely resembled one in which they had originally evolved. as with any restoration project, issues centred on detecting measurable community responses arise. brooks et al. (2002) suggest measuring and detecting changes in biotic communities in response to gradual changes to the ecosystem can be difﬁcult because of inherent system variability. north pool lake chautau- qua was subjected to relatively rapid changes in available habitat that may have alleviated some of these concerns, and there was certainly a marked change in community structure between the two sample periods. however, our study measured responses only 3–6 years after the construction period. petranka et al. (2003) suggest that longer lived taxa, like ﬁsh, may take considerably longer temporal periods to completely respond to habitat improvements. determining the ﬁnal outcome of ﬁsh community responses in ﬂoodplain like north pool lake chautauqua, and the lakes, potential contribution to the remainder of their 45 pegg et al. ﬂoodplain can only be decided by dedicating additional resources to long-term data collection efforts. resumen 1. muchas comunidades de peces de lagos de inundacio´ n se han visto inﬂuenciadas por cambios a gran escala en los procesos de estabilidad del nivel de agua que han degradado la cantidad y calidad del ha´bitat. recientemente, se han considerado priori- tarios los esfuerzos por restaurar rı´os y sus zonas de inundacio´n. sin embargo, las aproximaciones a la restauracio´n esta´n todavı´a en desarrollo y aparecen potenciales controversias. medimos los cambios de una comunidad de peces como respuesta a una te´cnica de estabilizacio´n del agua en un lago de inundacio´ n del rı´o illinois (usa) alcanzado por el nivel de renovacio´n en el an˜o 1997, utilizando datos antes de (1991–1993) y despue´s de (2000–2002) la estabilizacio´n. 2. nuestro resultados indicaron que la composicio´n de la comunidad de peces (presencia/ausencia) mostro´ poca variabi- lidad y no diﬁrio´ (r ¼ 0.037, p ¼ 0.60) entre los dos perı´odos de tiempo, mientras que la estructura de la comunidad (abundancia) diﬁrio´ (r > 0.50, p £ 0.10). una mayor abun- dancia de especies deseables como dorosoma cepedianum, pomoxis annularis, p. nigromaculatus y micropterus salmoides junto al declive de especies menos deseables como cyprinus carpio, contribuyeron a los cambios en la comunidad. 3. estos cambios sugieren respuestas positivas a las practicas de estabilizacio´n del agua que, en algunas situaciones, podrı´an actuar como paso intermedio en la restauracio´ n de la funcio´ n rı´o-inundacio´n. acknowledgements financial support for this study was provided by the u.s. army
