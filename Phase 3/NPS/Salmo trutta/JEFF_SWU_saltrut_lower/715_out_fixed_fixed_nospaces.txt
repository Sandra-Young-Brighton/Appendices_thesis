this relationship diminished with distance from the dam. river chubs are spawning habitat specialists. because multiple species rely on river chub nests for reproduction and food, the needs of this species should be considered when managing instream flows. key words: nocomis; spawning habitat; impoundment; hydrology; ecosystem engineer; keystone species introduction the conservation and management of knowledge of spawning habitat requirements is vital for fishes (johnston 1999). detailed habitat use information can help to explain patterns of recruitment or abundance in relation to climate change, habitat alteration or spe- cies introductions (hayes et al. 1996) and can be used as goals for restoration (keckeis 2001). minnows (cyprinidae) represent one of the most diverse groups of freshwater fishes and are common throughout much of the world (howes 1991). despite their ubiquity, contemporary studies of minnow autecology are typi- cally conducted only for imperiled (schiemer & spin- dler 1989; gibson et al. 2004; billman et al. 2008) or potentially nuisance nonindigenous species (schrank et al. 2001; weyl et al. 2009). large gaps remain in basic knowledge of relatively common fishes, and many species have been studied only in small portions of their distributions (cooke et al. 2012). hydrologic variability is important for creating and maintaining river habitat heterogeneity (trush et al. 2000) and sustaining diversity of fish spawning chro- nologies (bunn & arthington 2002). typically, dams alter hydrologic variability of river systems by elimi- nating flood-flows or creating unnatural disturbances such as hydrologic peaking (releasing large flows for power generation) (see cushman 1985 and collier correspondence: b. k. peoples, department of fish and wildlife conservation, virginia polytechnic institute and state university, blacksburg, va 24061, usa. e-mail: bpeoples@vt.edu doi: 10.1111/eff.12078 283 peoples et al. complex transport reproduction (kondolf 1997; et al. 1996 for a review). dewatering stream channels (i.e., diversion) for hydropower operations can dra- matically reduce native fish diversity, especially spe- cies with requirements (anderson et al. 2006). in addition to altered flows, rivers downstream of dams often experience reduced iba~nez et al. sediment 1998), causing coarsening of stream bed substrates (gordon et al. 2004) and loss of gravel substrates important for fish spawning (kondolf 1997). in diver- sion scenarios, dramatic reductions in flow magnitude are commonly accompanied by riparian encroach- ment, which intensifies sediment starvation by locking up potentially mobile particles (gordon & meente- meyer 2006). unnatural and unpredictable flow releases (e.g., for recreational boating), in conjunction with altered channel morphology, create suboptimal habitats for fish species requiring predictable flows and substrate conditions for spawning (jackson & pringle 2010). ultimately, understanding the habitat use of fishes, especially species seemingly adapted to survive in habitats that have been altered extensively (e.g., tailwater environments), is important for main- taining native fish diversity. the river chub nocomis micropogon is a large min- now (up to 287 mm, trautman 1981) common to large rivers throughout eastern united states (lachner & jenkins 1971; jenkins & burkhead 1994). in mid- spring (typically mid- to late may), adult male river chubs construct gravel mound nests for spawning. males carry stones in their mouths, as far as 25 m, to construct nests. nests average 50–60 cm in diameter (maurakis 1998), but can reach diameters up to 102 cm (miller 1964) and can contain up to 7050 stones (reighard 1943). in the only quantitative report of nest substrate preference for river chub, maurakis (1998) found that river chub prefers gravel between 0.6 and 1.13 cm (intermediate diameter). other mem- bers of the micropogon species group (bull chub n. raynei and bigmouth chub n. platyrynchus) seem to prefer larger substrates (lobb & orth 1988; maura- kis 1998). nocomis species have been noted to spawn in a wide variety of mesohabitats (frissell et al. 1986), including pool tails, runs and riffles (jenkins & burk- head 1994, and references therein). however, no quantitative analysis of the mesohabitat spawning preference of any nocomis species exists. many common fishes can be ‘keystone species’: they exert disproportionate effects on community structure, relative to their biomass. nocomis can func- tion as keystone species by providing spawning habi- tat for other lithophilic fishes (vives 1990; marcy et al. 2005; hitt & roberts 2011). over 30 species of north american minnows (collectively termed ‘nest associates’) can use nocomis nests for spawning (johnston & page 1992). for many nest associates, 284 symbiotic spawning may be an obligate (or facultative but very strong) behaviour (wallin 1992; pendleton et al. 2012). nocomis and its associates often repre- sent large portions of fish assemblages in the eastern united states. accordingly, knowledge of spawning habitat requirements of nocomis could shed light on the needs of many other species by quantifying the reproductive habitat requirements of multiple nest associates simultaneously. nocomis may be spawning microhabitat specialists (lobb & orth 1988; wisenden et al. 2009). one objective of this study was to quantify the nesting microhabitat preferences of river chub, with the hypothesis that they prefer a distinct range of depth, current velocity and substrate conditions. it has also been suggested that nocomis nests are constructed so that water flows upward over nests (maurakis et al. 1992), which minimises siltation and maximises aera- tion. this hypothesis was tested by comparing depths and current velocities at upstream and downstream edges of nests and by comparing nest permeability with that of adjacent water columns. another objec- tive was to quantify river chub nesting habitat prefer- ence at the mesohabitat scale and to identify the most important mesohabitat scale predictors of nest pres- ence and abundance. because nocomis nests are prone to destruction by high flows (miller 1964), their repro- ductive success (and consequently, reproduction of other species) may be susceptible to the highly vari- able instream habitat conditions downstream of dams (leonard & orth 1988). the final objectives were to relate river chub nest characteristics to large unnatural discharge events and to relate the use of flow refugia and overhead cover to downstream distance from a large dam. this study was conducted in a highly regu- lated and sediment-starved appalachian tailwater–the cheoah river in western north carolina (nc), usa. methods study area is is predominantly the cheoah river located in the nantahala national forest in graham county, western nc. the 143-km2 watershed forested, excluding the town of robbinsville. the cheoah river was impounded in 1928 to construct santeetlah lake, a 456-km2 reservoir built for flood control and hydropower generation. downstream of santeetlah dam, the cheoah river flows 14.6 km to its conflu- ence with the little tennessee river (fig. 1a). the cheoah is a high-gradient system: valley slope is approximately 30%, and bed slope is approximately 1.3%. the cheoah river consists of four major reaches (>2 km each), which were delineated during previous studies to stratify field sites based on geo- (a) (b) (c) (d) river chub habitat use below a north carolina dam d n b flow direction 5 km 1 km c n 1 km n 1 km n fig. 1.

(2010). intense pulses (28.3–36.8 m3s instream habitat characteristics are described in detail by mcmanamay et al. impoundment has affected the hydrologic regime and sediment character- istics. below the dam, the cheoah river is subject to prolonged low flows during much of the year and occa-  1 during the sional study period) from scheduled rafting releases and uncontrolled flood events (dilts et al. 2005). decades of impoundment and unnatural hydrology have caused the cheoah to be ‘sediment-starved’ (gordon & me- entemeyer 2006). substrates are primarily bedrock and boulders (d50 = 23.0 cm), and gravel is scarce. this is exacerbated by the steep bed slope of the river, which tends to promote high flows and thus reduce gravel retention. gravel additions were initiated to remediate the effects of streambed degradation and provide spawning habitat for fish (mcmanamay et al. 2010). nest survey overview on 15 january 2005 during leaf-off conditions and baseflows, aerial flights over the entire study area cap- tured high-resolution (6 inch) colour-infrared (cir) digital orthophotography (scale 1:1200), high-resolu- tion (1 m) hyperspectral imagery (scale 1:7500) and light detection and ranging (lidar) data. these data were georeferenced and interpolated to create a continuous 1-ft resolution digital elevation model (dem) according to mitasova & mitas (1993) and mitasova & hofierka (1993). one-foot contour lines and slope classes were derived from the dem data. slope classes were classified based on typical ranges found in literature for different mesohabitat types. the base data for water depth came from ground-truthing expeditions where depth was recorded and georefer- enced using a measuring rod and geographic position- ing system (gps). a proxy of depth was calculated based on differential penetration of bands in the colour spectrum, and a second-order polynomial regression model was used to extrapolate depth for the study area. vegetation and substrate classifications were developed using ground-truthing observations to train and verify the classification algorithms. survey crews identified and georeferenced vegetation and substrates on the ground and within aerial images. a combina- tion of cir and hyperspectral imagery was used in an unsupervised classification process (classification- and-regression-tree modelling) to classify vegetation and substrate using colour bands. light detection and ranging data and high-resolu- tion aerial imagery were used to delineate the cheoah river into 233 total mesohabitats, ranging in length from 20 to 300 m. after delineation, field crews sur- veyed mesohabitats to ground-truth classification accuracy. mesohabitats were stratified by each of the four major reaches (mentioned in study area descrip- 286 tion). twenty 0.75-km (average) stream sections were identified that contained combinations of mesohabi- tats ensuring the degree of habitat variability present within each major reach was adequately represented. stream sections were visually surveyed by four observers equally spread across the channel and wad- ing in an upstream direction. fifty-seven individual mesohabitats were searched for nests (fig. 1b–d). mesohabitat spatial data sets representing habitat characteristics were developed for the entire cheoah river by consul- tant agencies using lidar and aerial imagery. digital elevation models, water depth, slope and land cover data sets were represented as 0.30 m grid (i.e., raster) coverages. lidar was used to determine water sur- face and bed elevation, which was further used to cal- culate water depth and slope for each mesohabitat. all data sets were ground-truthed for accuracy. aerial infrared imagery was classified into land cover types, including ‘vegetation’, ‘water’, ‘road’, and ‘rock’. to calculate a metric of bedrock outcrop (and thus veloc- ity shelter) availability, the land cover data set was reclassified as either ‘rock’ or ‘other’. the resultant data set allowed for the quantification of exposed rock in each mesohabitat, a measure of outcrop availability. the zonal statistics function (spatial analyst extension) in arcgis 10 was used to calculate average depths (davg) and bed slope (savg), and proportions of rock outcrops (% outcrop) for each mesohabitat. microhabitat microhabitat variables were measured at 78 nests on 25 and 26 may 2009 during baseflow conditions; mean daily discharge for the 2 days was 5.1 and 4.9 m3s  1, respectively. length (cm, parallel to flow), width (cm, perpendicular to flow) and height (cm) were measured at each nest; water depth (cm) and current velocity (ms  1) were measured at the upstream and down- stream edges of each nest. nest distances from the nearest shore (m) and distance to nearest upstream velocity shelter (m) were measured to assess chub util- isation of microhabitat flow refugia. for the purposes of this study, velocity shelters are defined as any instream object that disrupted or reduced current veloc- ity (i.e., typically bedrock outcrops or boulders). over- head cover such as vegetation or submerged woody debris may provide shade and protection from aerial or aquatic predators. overhead cover was visually esti- mated as a percentage of the nest covered by bank or instream vegetation, root wads, or submerged woody debris within 1 m of the water surface (if above water). to quantify substrate size preference, intermediate diameters (cm) of 10 randomly chosen substrate parti- cles from each nest and 10 from a 1-m2 area adjacent to each nest were measured. the position of each nest position was recorded with a garmin etrex venture hc gps (olathe, kansas, mo, usa). spatial position accuracy was within 2 m. a modified terhune mark vi groundwater stand- pipe and volumetric pump was used to measure nest permeability, which represents the volume of water pumped through nest particles over time (barnard & mcbain 1994). nest permeability (cms  1) was mea- sured by driving a standpipe into the centre upstream edge of each nest to a depth of 15 cm. nest permeabil- ity was calculated from pumped inflow measurements (mls  1) and calibration curves correcting for tempera- ture (barnard & mcbain 1994) (temperature accounts for differences in viscosity). typically, 15 cm depth is the standard shallow depth for inter-gravel measure- ments (merz & setka 2004; sarriquet et al. 2007). three measurements, taken at 10 s each from 15 nests and from adjacent water columns, were averaged. to compare nest microhabitat measurements to available microhabitats in the remainder of the chan- nel, transects were established perpendicular to the thalweg in the centre of each surveyed mesohabitat. depth and current velocity were measured at 10 equi- distant points along each transect. to characterise the substrate around each nest, 10 randomly chosen parti- cles from a 1-m2 area adjacent to each nest were measured. four days after nests were surveyed, a 2- day scheduled rafting event approximately six times that of baseflow (maximum daily discharges were 33.1 and 27.8 cfs for 30 and 31 may, respectively) occurred. immediately following the event (01 june), dimensions of 27 nests were remeasured. analyses two-sample t-tests were used to compare means of depth, velocity (upstream measurements), substrate particle size and percolation rates of nests to mea- surements adjacent to nests. paired t-tests were used to compare means of depths and current velocities at the front and back edges of nests, as well as nest dimensions before and after the discharge event. independent mesohabitat scale variables were first screened for multicollinearity based on correlations where absolute values of r > 0.7 indicated an unac- ceptably high correlation. dependent variables were visually inspected for nonlinear relationships with independent variables (i.e., nest presence and nest abundance). generalised linear mixed models (glmms, proc glimmix in sas 9.2) were used to esti- mate the effects of savg, davg and% outcrop on nest presence and abundance in individual mesohabitats. these independent variables were treated as fixed effects and were considered statistically significant at river chub habitat use below a north carolina dam a = 0.05. to account for nestedness of independent variables within reaches, reaches (a categorical vari- able) and intercepts were treated as random effects. nest abundance was modelled as a poisson variable, and nest presence was modelled as a binomial vari- able. individual glmm models cannot identify the rela- tive importance of each significant independent vari- able. thus, an information-theoretic approach was used to estimate the relative importance of each inde- pendent variable at predicting nest presence and abundance at the mesohabitat scale. this was accom- plished by first calculating akaike weights (wi) of all possible models, based on the independent variables (including an intercept-only model). then, for each independent variable, wi of all models that contained that variable was summed. the variable with the highest summed w was considered the most impor- tant variable (burnham & anderson 2002). distances from the dam were calculated for tran- sects and nests based on a centreline down the river. linear regression was used to explain nest distances from velocity shelters, nearest banks and association with cover, with distances from the dam. all analyses were conducted in sas 9.2 (sas 2008). results than transect averages (t-test: nests were constructed in shallower, slower micro- habitats (fig. 2). nests were placed in depths between 19 and 96 cm, at velocities ranging from 0.02 to 0.70 ms  1. average nest depth was 9.8  1.6 cm (standard error) shallower than transect averages (t-test: t233 = 4.16, p < 0.001, table 1). average velocity at nests was 0.2  0.01 ms  1 t245 = 6.97, slower, p = 0.003, table 1). chubs exhibited a narrow pref- erence for substrate size, compared with particles adjacent to nests (fig. 3). mean diameter of stones from nests was 13.2  0.04 cm smaller than adjacent t451 = 19.59, p < 0.001, table 1). particles (t-test: water depths at the downstream edges of nests were 6.4  1.6 cm shallower than at front edges (paired t78 = 7.49, p < 0.001). current velocities at t-test: the upstream edges were 0.08  0.01 ms  1 swifter than at downstream edges (paired t-test: t78 =  5.16, p < 0.001). nests were just as permeable as the surrounding water column; water percolation rates through nests did not differ from measurements adja- cent to nests (t-test: t18 = 1.46, p > 0.160, table 1). most nests (75 of 78, 96%) were placed in slow (table 1) current either near the bank, downstream of velocity shelters or both. although the cheoah was regularly 35–40 m wide, most nests (69 of 78, 88%) were located within 10 m of the bank;

fig. 1). most mesohabitats contained fewer than three nests. all but one nest were constructed in run mesohabitats; the other was placed in a pool. at the mesohabitat scale, nests were more likely to occur in shallower runs with moderate slopes. aver- age slope had a significantly negative effect on prob- ability of nest presence (p = 0.003), average depth had a moderate negative effect (p = 0.059), and per- centages of outcrops had no effect (p = 0.522). the most important mesohabitat scale variable approxi- mating nest presence was average slope (w = 1.0), followed by average depth (w = 0.94) and percent- ages of outcrops (w = 0.49; table 2). similarly, aver- age slope had a significant negative effect on nest 288 abundance (p < 0.001), and average depth had a moderate negative effect (p = 0.064). percentages of outcrops had a moderate positive effect on nest abun- dance (p = 0.068). the most important factor influ- encing nest abundance was average slope (w = 1.0), followed by percentages of rock outcrops (w = 0.74) and mesohabitat type (w = 0.73; table 2). t-test: (paired (paired t-test: nests were significantly altered by the discharge event. after the event, nests were ‘flattened’, being t26 =  1.98, significantly wider p = 0.029) and shorter t26 = 3.29, p = 0.001), not t-test: t233 =  1.29, p = 0.205, table 3). near the dam, in close association with velocity nests were built shelters; this relationship diminished with distance from the dam (p = 0.040, r2 = 0.14). nest place- ment also decreased with distance from the dam (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.08). nest distance from the bank did not change with distance from the dam. in association with overhead cover but longer (paired discussion river chubs displayed distinct spawning habitat pref- erences at both the micro- and mesohabitat scales; many of these habitat preferences represent responses to current velocity. as hypothesised, river chubs in the cheoah preferred to construct nests in slower, shallower microhabitats. this is made obvious by the distinct use of near-shore habitats (wetted widths averaged approximately 30 m) and velocity shelters for nest placement. the distinct use of velocity shel- ters has been previously undocumented. depth and current velocity preferences of river chub in the che- oah are similar to those reported by lobb & orth (1988) for bigmouth chub. in contrast to this study, others have found that hornyhead chub n. biguttatus select (vives 1990;

(2009). as hypothesised, river chubs in the cheoah exhib- ited a distinct preference for substrate particle size. nests were built primarily of coarse gravel, which was distinctly smaller than the surrounding substrate. preferential selection of smaller than average substrate particles by nocomis has also been observed by lobb & orth (1988). particle sizes on river chub nests in the cheoah were distinctly larger than those reported table 3. average dimensions (standard error, se) of 27 river chub nocomis micropogon nests before and after a 2-day dam release event in the cheoah river, nc, on 30 and 31 may 2009. predischarge 74.0  2.9 65.2  4.1 21.1  1.2 postdischarge 79.3  4.6 77.0  5.2 17.0  1.3 t 1.29  1.98 3.29 df 26 26 26 p 0.2052 0.0290 0.0010 length (cm) width (cm) height (cm) for river chubs in the potomac and rappahannock drainages of virginia by maurakis (1998). this is most likely due to system-specific differences in sub- strate availability. gravel in river chub nests was con- siderably larger than particles used by hornyhead chubs (vives 1990), although wisenden et al. (2009) documented a similar pattern in substrate preference versus availability. members of the micropogon group are the largest of nocomis (jenkins & burkhead 289 peoples et al. 1994) and thus have larger mouth gapes. given their larger body and gape size, it is intuitive that river chub constructs nests of larger gravel than congeners. at the mesohabitat scale, river chub preference for shallower runs with moderate slopes also represents response to current velocity. bed slope dictates cur- rent velocity and thus depth and mesohabitat juxtapo- sition. given that chubs selected for slower, shallow microhabitats, it is not surprising that these mesohab- itat scale variables were most important at predicting nest presence and that they had negative parameters in models. nest abundance in a mesohabitat was also negatively related to increasing bed slope. the posi- tive influence of rock outcrops on nest abundance reflects the importance of velocity shelters. more velocity shelters in a mesohabitat approximate higher amounts of appropriate microhabitats for constructing nests. the observation from this study that river chub prefers runs is similar to that of leonard & orth (1988), but differs from lobb & orth (1988), who found that bigmouth chubs in the new river, west virginia, preferred pool tails. this disparity probably is due to the simple fact that optimal current veloci- ties and depths in the new river occurred in a differ- ent mesohabitat type than in the cheoah. this analysis of nest abundance assumes relative homoge- neity of chub density throughout the survey area. peoples et al. (2011) showed that at the reach scale, bluehead chub n. leptocephalus nest abundance was related to adult chub density. spawning habitat choices represent a balance among numerous variables. nest building fishes must construct nests in sites that minimise risks of nest destruction, desiccation, deoxygenation and preda- tion. unlike other members of nocomis, river chubs do not bury eggs after fertilisation (maurakis et al. 1991a). moderate velocities at nests are crucial for ensuring that eggs sink into the interstitial spaces between gravels (maurakis et al. 1990, 1991b). in the cheoah, river chubs typically constructed nests on downstream-sloping bedrock; depths at down- stream edges of nests were shallower, and current velocities were higher than at upstream edges. this causes water to flow upward, which can promote water exchange and facilitate aeration of eggs (maurakis et al. 1992). this is strengthened by the observation that water percolation rates in nests did not differ from those in the adjacent water column. such a design is crucial for reproductive success, particularly in tailwaters where dissolved oxygen concentrations can be low (cushman 1985). in addi- tion to attaining lower current velocities, nest place- ment in shallow habitats may serve to reduce predation on adults by piscivores such as smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu and rock bass ambloplites rupestris. in the presence of piscivores, small-bodied 290 fishes often utilise shallower habitats (fraser et al. 1987; schlosser 1987). however, abrupt reductions in baseflow levels during spring due to seasonal dam operations may compromise nests via prolonged desiccation (lobb & orth 1988). instream habitat characteristics associated with the dam affected river chub spawning activity. most obviously, nests were significantly flattened after the 2-day discharge event. adult male chubs continue to build and shape the nest as long as active spawning is taking place; this may have contributed to potential changes in nest dimensions in the 4 days between nest measurements. although it is possible that nest tending could have widened nests, it surely would not have reduced nest height. further, the nest resur- vey was conducted the morning after the second day of the discharge event. therefore, changes in nest dimensions are most likely attributable to the dis- charge event. although some nests were abandoned during the survey, many were still being used for spawning. thus, it is likely that the discharge event crushed eggs or caused them to become dislodged and drift downstream (although this was not quanti- fied in the field). although nests destroyed during floods are sometimes rebuilt (miller 1964), nest construction is extremely energetically demanding (wallin 1989; wisenden et al. 2009). routine nest destruction by high discharge events could reduce reproductive success of river chubs by inhibiting the ability of males to maintain and guard nests. like most cyprinids, nocomis are batch spawners. how- ever, the largest and most fecund females typically spawn first, and egg batches in subsequent spawning events are typically smaller than the first (winfield & nelson 1991). consequentially, destruction of nests during this first ‘pulse’ of nesting could have dispro- portionally negative effects on reproductive success. increased distance downstream from the dam was associated with chubs constructing nests further from velocity shelters and represents a response to flow moderation further from the dam. in areas near the dam, square-shaped hydrographs produce drastic changes in current velocities and near-bed shear stress. with increased distance from the dam, turbu- lence from channel roughness slows the magnitude and rate of change in current velocities, thereby alle- viating the detrimental effects of high-flow releases. velocity shelters did not protect nests during the raf- ting-release event. no other study has documented the use of velocity shelters by nocomis. at the micro- and mesohabitat scale, this study shows that this feature is critical for nest placement and abun- dance. as hydropower facilities are common through- out the range of nocomis, future work should seek a better understanding of this overlooked habitat com- ponent in tailwaters. the diminishing use of overhead cover with increased distance from the dam is proba- bly associated with predator avoidance. predator den- sities were not quantified in this study; future studies should seek to identify the importance of this vari- able. close association of nests with overhead cover has been observed in both regulated (lobb & orth 1988) and unregulated (raney 1947; vives 1990) systems. as hydrologic alteration of rivers continues to threaten global aquatic biodiversity, agencies are increasingly challenged to manage for lotic environ- ments (moyle et al. 1998; liermann et al. 2012). nest association among fishes is common in fresh- water habitats throughout the world (mckaye 1985; baba et al. 1990); knowledge and protection of host fish spawning habitat can have community-wide function as conservation efforts should not be focused solely on rare or threatened species. common species that function as keystone species should also be consid- ered. because of their strong influence on large por- tions of stream fish communities (walser et al. 2000; herrington & popp 2004; pendleton et al. 2012), nocomis have been recognised as keystone species (vives 1990; marcy et al. 2005; hitt & roberts 2011; peoples & frimpong 2013). thus, consider- ation of the needs of nocomis also considers the needs of multiple species. by distinctly modifying in- stream habitat, nocomis ‘ecosystem engineers’ (jones et al. 1994, 1997). a major func- tion of nocomis nesting activity is to concentrate gravel (vives 1990; mcmanamay et al. 2010; peo- ples & frimpong 2013). although they typically cover only small proportions of stream beds (e.g., 0.2%, vives 1990), nocomis nests are often the only suitable spawning habitat for lithophilic (requiring unsilted gravel substrate, balon 1975) minnows in habitats where gravel is scarce (wallin 1989; peoples et al. 2011). this was often the case in the cheoah, which is generally starved of smaller sediments. gravel appropriate for nest construction represented only 16% of particles from transects, which were dominated by cobble, boulder and bedrock (cumula- tively 76%). in many areas, especially near the dam, river chub nests represented the only locally available homogeneous gravel deposits. keystone species and ecosystem engineers are crucial to maintaining biodi- versity and community composition. although fishes are increasingly becoming recognised as ecosystem engineers (flecker 1996; moore et al. 2007; shiraka- wa et al. 2013), nocomis have not been recognised as such. thus, the importance of nocomis has been overlooked for some time. future studies of nocomis, conducted within the conceptual framework of eco- system engineering (sensu power et al. 1996 and moore et al. 2006), may shed light on the importance of these fishes for community regulation. river chub habitat use below a north carolina dam benefits (peoples & frimpong 2013). during the breeding season of nocomis (mid may through early june), minimum flows should be maintained to prevent nest desiccation. however, flows large enough to destroy nests should be avoided. system- specific discharges creating appropriate instream flow conditions for nocomis reproduction should be considered when designing flow management plans. releases to facilitate nocomis managing reservoir reproduction could better facilitate native species diversity. acknowledgments
