e-mail: julien.cucherousset@cict.fr accepted for publication march 22, 2007 introduction the european eel anguilla anguilla (l.) population is in steep decline that began in the 1970s (moriarty & dekker 1997; feunteun 2002; ices wgeel 2006). the most frequently cited causes for the decline are: global warming and its effects on marine currents and ocean to migration, productivity, obstructions 528 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00247.x these programmes, ﬁsheries, habitat degradation and parasite infestations (feunteun 2002; robinet & feunteun 2002; starkie 2003). attempts to manage and restore local stocks include (see review in feunteun 2002) (i) regulation of ﬁsheries at various biological stages (e.g., rosell et al. 2005); (ii) management of obstacles to migration in particular ﬁsh passes (e.g., knights & white 1998) and (iii) restocking programmes (e.g., moriarty & dekker 1997). despite all the general decline continues, and additional management mea- sures need to be developed. since 1999, the ices working group on eel has recommended reducing anthropogenic impacts on the production and escape- ment of silver eels (i.e., mature migrating stage) to the lowest possible levels (ices wgeel 2006). now, the situation is becoming increasingly critical for the eel ﬁsheries, and ices experts expressly demand to identify ‘areas producing high quality silver eels (large sized females, low contaminant and parasite burdens, unimpacted by hydropower stations)’, to prioritise their conservation (ices wgeel 2006). concrete actions must now be focused on the quantity and quality of the future silver eels leaving freshwaters (dekker 2003). marine protected areas have been proposed as an easily enforced conservation method for managers to reduce the impacts of ﬁshing on marine populations and habitats (apostolaki et al. 2002). scientists have developed practical and theoretical approaches for the design and the implementation of marine protected areas that have beneﬁts for biodiversity and ﬁsheries threatened by anthropogenic activities (see review in leslie 2005). recent research has shown that the success of marine protected areas also depends on the integration of social, economic, political and scientiﬁc factors (lundquist & granek 2005; stem et al. 2005). some attempts have been recently conducted world- wide, with variable success, to develop freshwater protected areas (maitland 1995; keith 2000; saunders et al. 2002). few areas have been created speciﬁcally for freshwater ﬁsh, and almost all freshwater protected areas were included ‘incidentally’ as part of terrestrial reserves (eybert et al. 1998; keith 2000; self 2005). although freshwater protected areas have been advo- cated for the management of american and european eel stocks (feunteun 2002; morrison & secor 2003), their utility for conservation has not been evaluated. small freshwater coastal marshes are useful for studying this issue because they are widely colonised by eels (feunteun et al. 1992) and in recent decades, habitat restoration programmes have been undertaken and in some cases, freshwater protected areas were created. these ecosystems also comprise recreational and traditional eel ﬁsheries and their limited size allows the whole local eel population to be studied. furthermore, the role played by many small inland freshwater protected areas for eels management ecosystems in terms of the silver eel production remains to be quantiﬁed (feunteun et al. 2000). the conﬁguration of the grande brie`re mottie`re (gbm, western france) offers good opportunities to test the efﬁciency of protected areas for eels because this coastal freshwater marsh has a traditional ﬁshery and two protected areas that were created in the early 1980s. based on a data set, combining both a scientiﬁc investigation in the ﬁeld and a traditional ﬁshery survey, the objectives of the present study were (i) to characterise the yellow eel (i.e., sedentary stage) size- classes targeted by the local ﬁshery and the spatial distribution of catches; to compare the eel population structure between ﬁshed and protected areas by analysing size-class distributions, mortality rates and silver eel production; (iii) to measure how the ﬁshery impacts the eel size-class structure and ﬁnally (iv) to estimate the local eel stock and the differences in silver eel production to evaluate the efﬁciency of protected areas on the quantity and quality of the future silver eels leaving the gbm. (ii) materials and methods study area the gbm is a freshwater and coastal wetland marsh of 7000 ha that ﬂows in the loire river estuary (north west france, 47°22¢n, 02°11¢w). the aquatic habitat is composed of a complex network of permanent ditches (144-km representing 206.4 ha) and semi- permanent ponds (392.7 ha) within a patchwork of temporary ﬂooded wetlands composed of grasslands and reed beds (fig. 1). in the general framework of restoration programmes developed in the early 1980s to limit the expansion of reed beds (bernard & rolland 1990), two protected areas where ﬁshing, hunting and entry are totally prohibited, have been created (eybert et al. 1998, fig. 1). the southern and northern protected areas were created in 1973 and 1989, and cover 700 and 250 ha of land composed of 8.1 and 6.5 ha of aquatic habitat, respectively. based on traditional habits, the study site is divided into eight zones where ﬁshing is permitted, plus the two protected areas (fig. 1). traditional ﬁshery survey data from the traditional ﬁshery survey were used to estimate the targeted eels’ sizes, the ﬁshing efforts and the ﬁshery harvest from questionnaires. since 1784, the gbm marsh had its own property law (‘undivided’ and privately owned) and a speciﬁc ﬁshery legislation, the ﬁshery being composed of noncommercial ﬁsher- men. in this marsh, no minimum legal size regulation 529

different zones of the study area (fig. 1) using three different methods. first, all ﬁshing licences were analysed to count the number of ﬁshermen and to assess the total number of gear used [product of the number of ﬁshermen with the mean (±se) number of each gear per ﬁshermen]. secondly, anonymous ques- tionnaires were distributed to evaluate the ﬁshing practices as logbooks were rarely available. during the ﬁshing season, questionnaires were randomly distri- buted directly to ﬁshermen in the ﬁeld or via ﬁshermen associations. follow-up contacts were made to improve the response rate. fishermen were questioned on the species targeted, their catches, the number and type of gear and the frequency and location of their trips. representativeness of the questioned ﬁshermen was checked to ascertain the wider application of the data (roth et al. 2001) by comparing these ﬁshermen to the total ﬁshing licences using a chi-square test. thirdly, some ﬁshermen were accompanied during their trips (creel survey) to assess the size-classes targeted by comparing the total captures with those ﬁsh released. based on the ﬁshermen logbooks available (n ¼ 3), we found that eel captures occurred mainly in may (73% of total captures) as a result of a very limited seasonal efﬁciency of ﬁshing gears with respect to the local water regime. based on question- naires, we calculated the number of eels caught during this month by multiplying the number of ﬁshermen with the mean (±se) number of each gear per ﬁshermen and with the mean (±se) catch per unit effort (cpue) for of each gear and then, the total 530 table 1. sampling design of the eel population and traditional ﬁshery surveys in protected and ﬁshed areas of the grande brie`re mottie`re marsh in 2004 and

1). trapping at randomly chosen locations was used to assess population parameters (i.e., size-class proﬁles, proportion of silver eels and sex ratio) in restricted locations of the protected and ﬁshed areas. it was conducted using fyke nets (two wings 1.2-m high and 3-m long directing the ﬁsh into the 2-m long and 50-cm diameter chamber of 5-mm mesh) and ﬁshermen eel pots (1.5-m long with 1.0 · 0.4-m frames and 10-mm mesh). all trapping data (ﬁshermen creel and scientiﬁc surveys) were pooled to increase the number of eels sampled (table 1). because trapping was not applic- able to the whole study area, electroﬁshing was randomly conducted at different locations over the whole study area in 2004 and 2005 to assess the geographical variation in eel abundance (fig. 1 and table 1). sampling was conducted with an efko f.e.g. 8000 apparatus (leutkinch, germany) using the point abundance sampling method (pas; nelva et al. 1979), with the pas number per site being in accord- ance with persat & copp’s (1989) recommendations. indeed, pas is an efﬁcient and cost-effective method for assessing ﬁsh abundance and population structure and provides reproducible and quantitative samples that allows within- and between-sites comparisons (copp 1989). in total, we conducted 1225 pas in 17 and 30 sites sampled in 2004 and 2005, respectively (details in table 1). abundance was expressed in cpue, i.e., the number of eels caught per pas. (0.04 mlæl for the two sampling methods, eels were anaesthe- )1), measured [total tised with eugenol length (tl) to the nearest mm], weighed (w, to the nearest g), macroscopic silvering criteria were assessed (acou et al. 2005), and then the eels were released into the water. given that some differences might occur in the selectivity of trapping gear in relation to different mesh sizes, only eels longer than the modal body size (i.e., tl ¼ 320 mm) were used for further analyses (naismith & knights 1990a,b; knights et al. 1996). given that elvers (postlarval stage, <150 mm, n ¼ 32) have only colonised the drainage during the current year and have a higher downstream abundance, they were removed from the data set obtained by electroﬁshing to avoid any biases in the analyses. where nonparametric tests showed no difference, data collected in 2004 and 2005 were combined with respect to the sampling method (trapping and electroﬁshing). population parameters the total mortality rate per year (z) was calculated in the protected and ﬁshed areas, using the age-size relationship established in a nearby and very similar ecosystem (at 60-km distance in grand-lieu lake; adam 1997). assuming that z remains constant throughout the population is in a state of equilibrium, z was calculated for ﬁsh under full exploitation (i.e., indi- viduals submitted to the ﬁshery age from 5 to 7 without seaward emigration, using the following formula; see sparre & venema (1998) for details): nðage¼7þ ¼ nðage¼5þ  eð ztþ the cohort and that the life of ð1þ where n(age¼5) is the number of individuals of age 5 entering the fully exploited phase, n(age¼7) is the number of individuals of age 7 (end of the fully exploited phase), t is the time in year, and z the total mortality rate expressed in percentage of individual per year. the mortality rate calculation was performed at the study area scale (i.e., protected vs. ﬁshed areas), and not for each zone, given the insufﬁcient number of individ- uals sampled in each zone. at the zone scale, mortality was estimated by calculating the difference in abun- dance obtained by electroﬁshing (expressed in cpue) between untargeted and targeted eel size classes. in 2005, the proportion of eels was determined, using a standardised method based on macroscopic criteria (ocular index, state of differen- tiation of the lateral line and colour contrast) that provides a quick identiﬁcation in the ﬁeld of silver 531 cucherousset et al. premigrant eels in a standardised way and without sacriﬁcing any individuals (acou et al. 2005). however, this method was applied to data collected later in the season (i.e., september and october, acou et al. 2005), so we used two earlier criteria of silvering prior to this (i.e., ocular hypertrophy and differentiation of the lateral line). indeed, the typical pigmentation of silver eel occurred generally at the end of the silvering process (acou et al. 2005; durif et al. 2005). because few silver eels were sampled in protected area by electroﬁshing, the proportion of silver eels in the protected areas was calculated using the proportion of silver eels in ﬁshed area multiplied by the silvering ratio between protected and ﬁshed areas. in addition, we used the fulton’s )3 · 100 000) as a condition factor general indicator of premigrant quality (eelrep 2005), and used the 440-mm threshold to assess the sex of silver eels as no individuals were sacriﬁced during the study. individuals longer than 440 mm are known to be females (tesch 2003; acou et al., in press). the sex ratio was expressed as the proportion of males among premigrant eels. (k ¼ w · tl stock assessment, ﬁshery mortality and silver eel production the assessment of eel stocks in extensive areas is particularly difﬁcult. indeed, the most common tech- nique (depletion sampling associated with electroﬁsh- ing) consumes manpower and time and, thus, is not easily applicable in extensive areas (lobon-cervia & utrilla 1993). nevertheless, a method has been developed to point sample the eel abundance in freshwater areas by establishing the relationship between pas and depletion samples (laffaille et al. 2005a). these authors recommended developing a single relationship for each type of equipment and habitat the authors found that this relationship is linear at variable )2, eel densities (expressed as the number of eelæ100æm laffaille et al. 2005a). using the habitat differentiation between the shoreline and open water (broad et al. 2001; schulze et al. 2004), we established the follow- ing relationship in a typical ditch of the brie`re marsh based on 25 pas distributed in two sites sampled by depletion: )2) ¼ 10.59 (±1.55 se) (laffaille et al. 2005a). furthermore, eel density (in eelæ100æm eel relative abundance (in cpue from pas). no differences in the size-class distribution of eels between pas and depletion sampling were found (kolmogorov–smirnov two-sample test, ks ¼ 0.201, p > 0.602, n ¼ 57). eel stock assessment was derived from this relationship and the estimation of the area of each type of habitat (shoreline and open water) using a geographical information system (source parc naturel regional de brie`re). 532 next, we used the mortality rates estimated in protected and ﬁshed areas and the estimated eel stock under exploitation (eels > 320 mm, see results sec- tion) to evaluate the ﬁshing mortality based on scientiﬁc data. we used the formula: z ¼ f þ m ð2þ where z is the total mortality, f is the ﬁshing mortality and m is the natural mortality, and making the assumption that recruitment and population parameters were similar in 2004 and 2005 (see section on population parameters). thus, in the protected areas, the ﬁshing mortality was assumed to be zero (f ¼ 0) and thus resulting in m ¼ z. for the calculation of f at the ﬁshed areas, the m-value was subtracted from the z-value to obtain the ﬁshing mortality (f ¼ z)m). the number of eels caught by the ﬁshery (nf) was estimated, using the following formula and equations (1) and (2): nf¼nðage¼5þð1 e½ tðfþmþþ½f =ðfþmþ ð3þ where nf is the number of eels that died from ﬁshing mortality, n(age ¼ 5) is the number of individuals of age 5 entering the fully exploited phase and t is the average number of years an eel is experiencing exploitation (i.e., 3 years). next, estimated nf was compared qualitatively to the results obtained from ﬁshermen’s questionnaires. finally, silver eel produc- tion was derived from the estimated eel stock and the proportion of silver eels in both protected and ﬁshed areas. all estimates (the number and biomass of the eels) and their upper and lower values (in parentheses) resulted from the products of the lower values (mean ) se), the mean and the upper values (mean + se) of the population parameters. results the traditional ﬁshery a total of 521 ﬁshing licences were sold in the gbm marsh in 2005: 34 for the use of eel pots, 66 for square dipping nets and 46 for ﬁsh spears; the rest of the licences being attributed for gill nets, rods and multiple gears. nevertheless, gillnets and rods are principally used to catch piscivorous ﬁsh (northern pike esox lucius and pikeperch sander lucioperca). the eel ﬁshery was composed of 48 ﬁshermen using pots, 87 using square dipping nets and 60 using spears. in total, 75 ﬁshermen responded to the questionnaires and provided data, including 28 using pots, 43 using square dipping nets and 26 using spears (i.e., approximately one-half of the total number of ﬁshermen for each gear). furthermore, the set of ﬁshermen that responded to the questionnaires ) 1 – a h l e e ( n e m r e h s i f y b t s e v r a h 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 fishing gears: square dipping nets eel pots fishing spears 1 2 3 4 5 zone 6 7 8 fig. 2. geographical distribution of the harvest by ﬁshermen )1) in each zone of the ﬁshed area and for each eel ﬁshing (eelæha gear (eel pots, square dipping nets and ﬁshing spears). did not differ signiﬁcantly from the whole eel ﬁshery (chi square, d.f. ¼ 2, v2 ¼ 0.797, p < 0.671). based on these questionnaires, we estimated that 23 892 eels (18 206–29 578 ranging from lowest to highest estimation) were caught in 2005. given that the mean weight of eels kept by ﬁshermen was 127.7 g (±5.7 se), the estimated total biomass of eels kept was 3052 kg (2222; 3947). based on the spatial distribution of the ﬁshing the harvest by ﬁshermen activity, we found that )1) varied largely between zones and gears (in eelæha (fig. 2). the highest harvest by ﬁshermen was found in the southern part of the gbm (zones 3 and 4) for all gear types, and the northern part of the gbm (zones 1 and 2), which was mainly ﬁshed with pots. the lowest harvest by ﬁshermen occurred in the eastern part (zones 5, 6, 7 and 8; figs 1 and 2). because ﬁsh spears accounted for a restricted part of the catches (5%), data related to this gear have been removed from the analysis of targeted eel size-classes per gear type. based on creel surveys, ﬁshermen using pots and square dipping nets caught eels from 240 to 760-mm tl and 33.5% of the total eel captures (n ¼ 257) were released by ﬁshermen. the size distribution differed between released and kept eels (kolmogorov–smirnov two-sample test, ks ¼ 0.678, p < 0.001) and released individuals were, on an average smaller test, u ¼ 13.950, p < 0.001). fishermen released on an average 79.4% (±5.1 se) of the smaller eels (240– 320 mm) and kept a high ratio (up to 60 %) of eels measuring more than 320 mm. from 420 to 620 mm, all eels (100%) were kept. interestingly, some ﬁshermen tended to release some of the larger eels (fig. 3). thus, based on their size, eels were classiﬁed into those untargeted and targeted by the ﬁshery using the 320-mm threshold.

based on equation (3), the total mortality rates in protected and ﬁshed areas, and the stock assessment of eel under full exploitation, we estimated that the total harvest by ﬁshermen accounted for

the production of the protected areas, that cover 2.4% of the total aquatic area (596.6 ha), would represent 8.4% (±0.43 se) of the silver eel biomass produced in the whole study area. we estimated that a fully protected gbm would produce 6742 silver eels (596.6 ha · )1). the gbm is currently estimated to 11.3 eelæha produce 1961 silver eels, thus the ﬁshery activity currently is estimated to remove approximately 71% of the silver eel production of a fully protected gbm. then, it is possible to estimate the surface of marshes to be protected, in accordance with a management objective. for example, 50% of the potential eel biomass of a fully protected gbm would represent table 3. parameters (number, density and biomass) of eel stock and silver eel production assessed at each zone of the

protected area would always have a mean production of silver eels 3.6 times higher than those in the ﬁshed area (i.e., 11.3 )1, respectively), 3371 silver eels and 3.1 silver eelsæha could be produced with 31.1% of the gbm protected. indeed, 31.1% of protected area (185.5 ha) would produce 2096 silver eels and 411.1 ha of ﬁshed areas would produce 1275 silver eels. consequently, only 31.1% (185.5 ha) of protected aquatic habitat of the gbm would produce, with the unprotected area, 50% of the potential eel biomass of a fully protected gbm. discussion freshwater protected areas: a compromise between eel global management and local ﬁshery activities the analysis of catch data and scientiﬁc surveys in the gbm freshwater marshes between 2004 and 2005 provided evidence for the efﬁciency of a protection policy for guaranteeing a local production of silver eels and maintaining a traditional ﬁshery activity. indeed, the protected area showed a mean production of silver )1) around 3.6 times more than the ﬁshed eel (indæha areas and 2.4% (14.6 ha) of protected area in the gbm produces 8.4% of the current silver eel production (in biomass). consequently, a size adjustment of the protected areas to 31.1% (185.5 ha of aquatic habitat) with maintaining the current ﬁshery in the remaining parts might produce 50% of the potential eel biomass of a fully protected gbm. this could be a management target usable by local managers. nevertheless, the optimal size of protected areas is difﬁcult to estimate because the consequences of the protected areas extension have never been thoroughly investigated to establish valid rules for the design of freshwater protected areas (size, connectivity, land covered, etc.), or the creation of new habitats (ditches) in the existing protected area. another crucial point is that we do not know the proportion of individuals that escape from the silver eel ﬁshery when they migrate seaward and reach safely the spawning area as well as the level of eel movements between protected and ﬁshed areas within the marsh. location, the conservation of freshwater ﬁsh and ﬁsheries is the greatest challenge facing the sustainable develop- ment of inland waters (arlinghaus et al. 2002). inland ﬁsheries are of high economic and socio-cultural importance, providing a ‘myriad of beneﬁts to society’ (arlinghaus et al. 2002; cowx & gerdeaux 2004). by far, inland ﬁsheries management practises in europe are regulations and stocking. to a lesser extent, inland ﬁsheries manage- ment uses habitat restoration to increase the potential production of the ﬁshery (see review in arlinghaus et al. 2002). the use of freshwater protected areas to the most dominant traditional freshwater protected areas for eels management manage eel populations is in keeping with the last aspect. because the management of the wide panmic- tic european eel population is particularly complex (such a challenge has never happened before), it faces some highly variable socio-economic and legislation constraints. therefore, case-adapted management op- tions with respect to usages, properties and histories must be considered to signiﬁcantly increase silver eel production. the use of local freshwater protected areas appears to be a relevant way to reconcile these aspects and to respond to both global management constraints and local ﬁsheries subsistence. contribution of small coastal marshes to the european eel population small coastal marshes contribute to the overall growth, and the reproduction of the european eel population by precise quantiﬁcation remains impossible. in the present study, we estimated that a single marsh on the european atlantic coast (gbm 7000 ha total area) supports a sub-population of about 130 000 eels and )1, potentially produces about 1961 silver eelsæyear almost exclusively composed of females. coastal marshes cover 230 000 ha of land on the western french coast (feunteun et al. 1992). given our ﬁndings in the present study, it can be assumed that these ecosystems produce a signiﬁcant number of female silver eels. moreover, eels produced in coastal marshes are exposed to fewer hazards than those in rivers because such marshes are not equipped with hydroelectric stations, that damage or kill 20–100% of the silver migrants passing through their turbines (travade & larinier 1992; mccleave 2001; gibson & myers 2002). in addition, these coastal marshes are small, only connected to the sea, and they are a part of nonintensive agricultural landscapes. together, these factors probably account for the quality of the silver eel production. it is especially interesting to consider that coastal marshes’ characteristics can inﬂuence the sex ratio. in places where the eel abundance, is about )1 on the fre´mur 100–150 kgæha )1 on the rio river, acou et al. 2007; 90–159 kgæha esva, lobon-cervı`a et al. 1995), silver eels are mainly males (94.7% and >99% for the fre´mur river and the rio esva, respectively), whereas when the eel abun- )1 on the imsa river, dance is relatively low (3.5 kgæha )1 on the oir vøllestad & jonsson 1988; 35–45 kgæha river, acou et al. 2007), silver eels are mainly females (>90% and around 80% for the imsa and oir rivers, respectively). thus, the observed over- dominance of females in the gbm and the low )1, see table 3) abundance of yellow eels (15.4 kgæha are consistent with observations from other areas with low abundance where females are the numerically dominant sex. on the other hand, the proportion of )1 (110–170 kgæha 535 cucherousset et al. silver eels observed in the gbm is comparable with those reported in other systems at the same latitude (6.0% and 12.6% in oir and fremur rivers, respect- ively, acou et al. 2005; 8.7% and 8.9% in the fremur river, feunteun et al. 2000; 5.9%, 1.3% and 5.8% in the fremur river in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, acou et al., in press). as vøllestad (1990) recom- mended retaining yellow-eel ﬁshery activity to max- imise the silver eel ﬁshery landings, it seems likely that, by limiting the yellow eel abundance in the gbm )1, the traditional ﬁshery might contribute to <50 kgæha to the local production of large silver eels. this might be inﬂuenced by a low recruitment that leads to a low elver eel abundance, and by the high food availability because of the recent introduction of the invasive red swamp crayﬁsh (procambarus clarkii) that can be preyed by eels (domingos et al. 2006). such prospects are crucial from a conservation viewpoint, as one of the main recommendations of international managers (eelrep 2005; ices wgeel 2006) is to protect aquatic systems with a high proportion of large healthy silver eels. in the present study, we quantiﬁed ﬁshing practices and evaluated their inﬂuence on the local eel population. such issues are important, as the identiﬁcation of mortality causes and their quantiﬁcation are difﬁcult in the wild but are keys for international eel management (feunteun et al. 2000; feunteun 2002). the presence of protected areas allowed us to determine the mean natural mortality was )1) and compar- relatively low in the marsh (12%æyear able with those observed in other ecosystems for the same life stages (adam 1997; feunteun et al. 2000). nevertheless, our estimation of ﬁshermen’s captures based on biological data, [i.e., 10 630 individuals (5231–16 994)], was somewhat lower than that result- ing from questionnaires [i.e., 23 882 individuals (18 206–29 578)]. this might arise because ﬁshermen had difﬁculties to evaluate their catches accurately, underlining the importance of logbooks to conduct ﬁshery surveys. establishment of freshwater protected area freshwater protected areas have already been shown to be efﬁcient for conserving bird and ﬁsh diversity (eybert et al. 1998; keith 2000; self 2005) and their adaptation for the local eel population management could be included in the overall management of freshwater biodiversity (noble et al. 2004). recent research in marine protected areas has demonstrated that ﬁsh populations beneﬁt from protected areas not just for the overexploited poorly mobile species, but also (to a lesser extent) for under-exploited stocks and highly mobile species (apostolaki et al. 2002). thus, the creation of freshwater protected areas might also beneﬁt vulnerable or endangered freshwater ﬁsh 536 remains species, such as has already been advocated for the northern pike, esox lucius (rosell & macoscar 2002). the efﬁciency of protected areas in other inland ecosystems to be assessed. concerning estuarine and coastal waters, naismith & knights (1990a,b) indicated that commercial ﬁshery in the thames estuary was having minimal impact on the eel stock, and ﬁshing mortality was masked by natural mortality and migration effects. in the same way, in the hudson river estuary, morrison & secor (2003) suggested that brackish-water areas could support a higher ﬁshing mortality than freshwater areas. such analyses conﬁrm that protected areas for eels might not be relevantly usable in open habitats like estuaries or coastal areas, and that this manage- ment tool might be preferentially applied into conﬁned freshwater areas, such as coastal marshes (morrison & secor 2003). furthermore, the restricted yellow eel home range in several types of freshwater ecosystems (baras et al. 1998; jellyman & sykes 2003; laffaille et al. 2005b) offers opportunity for a wider application of this measure. acknowledgements we thank the parc naturel re´gional de
