matthews 1998). during the ﬁrst year of sampling we collected 131 and 101 species at site 1 and at site 2, respectively. the greater ﬁsh richness at site 1 was attributed to the closer (a) (b) the two study sites of fig. 4.

high-waters period (e.g., members of the families achiridae and proc- hilodontidae, appendix s1). nevertheless, practically the same total number of species was recorded in the two study sites during the whole sampling period: 133 and 131 for site 1 and site 2, respectively but whilst 93 species were common to both sites, 40 species were unique to site 1 and 38 unique to site 2. such high species richness was primarily due to the presence of many species of low abundance and small size (fig. 4). among the total species recorded, 75 species (45%) were represented by <10 individuals [fig. 4(a)], of which 35 were represented by only one individual. moreover, 53 species (31% of total species) showed maximum standard length <5 cm and 57 species (33%) were in the range 5–10 cm [fig. 4(b)]. the total number of ﬁsh species recorded in yahuarcaca stream exceeds by far the ﬁsh richness reported for similar sized streams of the rı´o amazonas drainage, summarised in 20 to 61 species reported for a variety of streams across amazonian regions (kno¨ppel 1970; lowe-mcconnell 1987; henderson & walker 1990; arau´ jo-lima et al. 1995, 1999; bu¨hrnheim & cox-fernandes 2003; mendonc¸a et al. 2005; dos anjos & zuanon 2007; espı´rito-santo et al. 2008). such discrepancies may indicate differences in species richness among ﬁsh assemblages and streams but also may indicate inappropriate sampling designs in previous studies. conventional daily or point sampling methodologies, generally applied in all studies above, might not reﬂect the marked daily and seasonal variations highlighted in this study. for example, in a our daily samples we collected on the average 32.2 species ranging from 10 to 63 which matches the range of species reported by all studies above. apparently, only through intensive and pro- longed samplings designs may it be possible to obtain accurate measures of species richness in complex ﬁsh assemblages of amazonian streams. moreover, the high ﬁsh richness of yahuarcaca stream contrasts strikingly with those reported for vast aquatic regions within the rı´o amazonas drainage. clearly, the 171 species recorded for two small sites (each 100 m length) is over 38% of the >450 species in a 1200 km transect of the lower rio negro (goulding et al. 1988), 82% of the 208 species in 660 km of rio napo (ibarra & stewart 1989), 88% of the 194 species in a 2000 km transect of the amazonian varzeas between tefe´ and parentins (granado-lorencio et al. 2005) and 58% of the 296 species in 1350 km of the putumayo-ic¸a´ river (ortega et al. 2006). in addition, ﬁsh species richness in the two small study sites of yuahuarcaca stream represents 46% of the 364 species recorded for the whole leticia 524 region ( 500 km2) including not only the main stem of rı´o amazonas but also the surrounding lakes, ﬂoodplains and tributaries (mojica et al. 2005). the coexistence of high numbers of ﬁsh species in the nutrient-poor amazon streams (goulding et al. 1988) has been related to different adaptive responses including resource partitioning (tedesco et al. 2007), ﬁsh morphology, colour pattern, small size (weizman & vari 1988) and high dependence on inputs of terrestrial organic matter (lowe-mcconnell 1975, 1987). additionally, high ﬁsh species richness might relate to habitat selection by different ﬁsh species and their respective feeding behaviour, growth and mortal- ity factors (werner et al. 1983). these theories how- ever, might not be adequate to functionally explain the extremely high ﬁsh richness of terra ﬁrme streams. identifying and understanding the factors and pro- cesses underlying high richness in these stream ﬁsh assemblages is a major challenge to both empirical ﬁeld studies and theoretical community ecology. in turn, lack of knowledge of the factors regulating species richness in rı´o amazonas makes conserva- tion-oriented research programmes difﬁcult. during the last few decades rı´o amazonas has been subjected to severe ﬁsheries exploitation (junk et al. 2007). relative to small streams, the ﬁsh fauna of large rivers and ﬂoodplains are subject to numerous conservation and management-oriented programmes because most species occupy extensive river reaches making them more resilient to local habitat destruction (e.g., defor- estation and other human interventions). our ﬁndings indicate that markedly higher species richness with high turnover rates in terra ﬁrme streams make them critical hotspots for conservation efforts. designation of reserve and references streams will permit a better understanding of the high diversity and the sustain- ability of ornamental ﬁsheries, ecotourism and other human activities. acknowledgements thanks are due to s. duque
