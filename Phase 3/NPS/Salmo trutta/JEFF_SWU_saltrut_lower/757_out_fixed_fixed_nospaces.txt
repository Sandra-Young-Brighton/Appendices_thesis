university, college station, tx 77843, usa accepted for publication january 23, 2014 abstract – life history theory seeks to explain how environmental variation selects for patterns of investment in growth and survival relative to production and survival of offspring. seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature provide environmental cues for spawning by many tropical freshwater fishes. to investigate environment–life history associations, we conducted a one-year study of astyanax intermedius in an atlantic forest stream of southeastern brazil. our analysis focused on temporal variation in feeding, body condition and reproduction in relation to rainfall and water temperature. for mature females, food intake was not significantly correlated with rainfall or temperature; however, body condition was negatively correlated with rainfall and water temperature. female reproductive effort was positively correlated with water temperature, but did not vary with rainfall. for males and juveniles, there was no significant relationship between food intake or body condition and either environmental variable. testis weight was negatively correlated with rainfall, but was not significantly correlated with water temperature. we detected a negative correlation between gonad mass with body condition and food intake for females but not for males. our results differed from other studies in tropical and subtropical areas where rainfall has been shown to be positively correlated with fish reproductive effort. our results indicate that reproductive effort of males is relatively constant throughout the year, whereas for females, it increases with increasing water temperature. this increase in reproductive investment in concert with an increasing temperature and metabolic rate may incur a trade-off with somatic growth and survival for this small stream fish. key words: fecundity; life history; oocyte size; physiological trade-offs; neotropical fishes introduction relationships between life history theories model growth, adaptive responses to variation in environmental factors, such as hydrology, water quality, food availability and reproduction and survival as predation pressure (roff 1984; stearns 1992; winem- iller & rose 1992). life history strategies are defined by demographic, physiological and genetic con- straints, or influence patterns of energy and biomass allocation (mathews 1998; vila-gispert & moreno-amich 2002; blanck & trade-offs, that correspondence: ursulla p. souza, departamento de zoologia, instituto de bioci^encias, universidade estadual paulista “julio de mesquita filho”, av. 24-a, 1515, cep 13506-910 rio claro, s~ao paulo, brazil. e-mail: upsouza@gmail.com doi: 10.1111/eff.12131 123 souza et al. lamouroux 2007). resources acquired by an organ- ism can be divided into four broad categories: (i) maintenance (to sustain metabolic requirements and survival), (ii) production of somatic tissues (for cur- rent and future survival), (iii) reproduction (gonad development and related reproductive structures and activities) and (iv) energy reserves (for future survival, growth or reproduction). energy budget models gener- ally assume that the first priority is maintenance (prox- imate survivorship) and the second priority is growth, a portion of which enhances future survival and a por- tion that can be converted to gametes and other repro- ductive tissues at the appropriate time (lester et al. 2004; quince et al. 2008). assimilated energy that exceeds these two needs is stored as reserves for either future growth or reproduction (sibly et al. 2013). total energy is limited by the amount of food con- sumed, and both foraging and energy allocation depend on how an organism responds to environmen- tal cues. more energy directed to one function results in less energy available for others. hence, allocation of energy to reproduction trades-off with energy invested in somatic growth or storage that enhances survival and future reproduction (stearns 1992; link & burnett 2001). in seasonal habitats, many fishes increase their to spawning, which increases energy reserves or allows for recov- ery of energy depleted during previous reproductive bouts (link & burnett 2001). in these cases, feeding activity declines or may cease entirely during the reproductive period, when fat reserves and other stor- age tissues sustain metabolic requirements (nikolsky 1963). this pattern has been observed for the stream- dwelling characids moenkhausia intermedia (braga & gennari filho 1990, 1991) and bryconamericus iheringi (lampert et al. 2004). feeding activity prior in lotic systems, rainfall regime and water tempera- ture influence food availability and foraging success. in tropical and subtropical areas, these abiotic vari- ables can provide reliable cues for the timing of reproduction by seasonal spawners. temperature influences metabolic rate and gametogenesis (kramer 1978), and precipitation affects habitat quality, quan- tity and connectivity, and also can trigger spawning and migration activities (lowe-mcconnell 1987; chellappa species with extended reproductive seasons, higher rainfall and temperature sometimes are associated with higher reproductive effort (kramer 1978; mazzoni & petito 1999; alkins-koo 2000; mazzoni et al. 2002; paugy 2002; andrade & braga 2005; gomiero & braga 2007). however, in small headwater streams, high rainfall often is associated with habitat disturbance caused by high water velocity and sediment sus- pension (gordon et al. 2004; lewis 2008). high water velocity may cause mortality, directly through et al. 2009). even for 124 displacement of larvae and juveniles by currents, or indirectly when high flows scour the streambed, reducing benthic algae and invertebrate prey (oliveira et al. 1997). prey capture rates of visually oriented predators also can be reduced by low water transpar- ency (sweka & hartman 2001). in the present study, we examined the patterns of food intake and resource allocation in a population of astyanax intermedius eigenmann, 1908, in relation to rainfall and water temperature in a headwater stream of the atlantic forest ecoregion of southeastern bra- zil. astyanax intermedius is part of a lineage known as the ‘scabripinnis complex’ (characidae family) that apparently diversified within isolated hydro- graphic basins, with species restricted to small head- water drainages of the paraıba do sul river basin, adjacent coastal rivers of rio de janeiro state, and the doce river basin, minas gerais state (britski 1972; moreira-filho & bertollo 1991; kavalco & moreira-filho 2003; lima et al. 2003; bertaco & lucena 2006; lezama et al. 2011). similar to other species within the genus, a. intermedius has a life history strategy that would be classified as opportu- nistic (sensu winemiller 1989; winemiller & rose 1992), represented by small-bodied species with early maturation, continuous reproduction, low fecundity but high reproductive effort, rapid population turn- over and capacity for rapid colonisation (winemiller 1989; lamouroux et al. 2002; blanck et al. 2007). size of maturation is about 4 cm standard length (sl), maximum size is 10 cm sl (gomiero et al. 2012) and juveniles and mature adults are found throughout the year, indicating that the species has an extended reproductive period (u. p. souza, unpub- lished data). we tested the hypothesis that rainfall and water temperature influence feeding and biomass/energy allocation in a. intermedius. feeding activity may decline during the spawning season, as has been observed for other characid fishes (braga & gennari filho 1990; costa & braga 1993; lampert et al. 2004). if rainfall or temperature provide cues for spawning, correlations would be expected between these variables and patterns of allocation for repro- duction versus somatic growth. temperature may trigger spawning directly by its effects on fish metab- olism, whereas rainfall may affect fishes by changes in river discharge, water level or velocity (baran 2006). in adults, feeding activity and body condition would be expected to decrease during the latter stages of gonad maturation and spawning when storage tissues are used to meet metabolic requirements (nikolsky 1963; link & burnett 2001). negative correlations between reproductive investment and body condition or food intake should be stronger in females because more biomass/energy is invested in ovaries compared to testes. juveniles would not be expected to reveal any relationships. in contrast, if high rainfall results in suboptimal conditions due to habitat disturbance, there should be negative correlations between precipi- tation and food intake or body condition, and repro- ductive investment, with juveniles, males and females revealing similar patterns. materials and methods 0 s, 45°14 study region and environmental data sampling was conducted in the ribeir~ao grande 0 (23°26 w), a headwater stream of the para- ıba do sul river basin, one of the most impacted of southeast brazil, threatened by urbanisation, industry development, agriculture and damming. ribeir~ao grande is a 4th-order stream at 757 m elevation with a drainage area of 4.59 km2, located within ‘parque estadual da serra do mar (pesm)’, santa virginia unit. most of the park’s landscape is covered by rainforest with patches of recovering native vegeta- tion, abandoned eucalyptus plantation and small areas of agricultural plots. the region is mountainous with ridge tops between 960 and 1160 m within the core park area, and some reaching 1585 m at the headwa- ters of the ribeir~ao grande (s~ao paulo 1998). this region has a humid subtropical climate without a dry season, and the average rainfall is around 2180 mm per year, one of the highest rainfall levels of the s~ao paulo state. historical data on rainfall (from 1936 to 2010) were obtained from the gauging station in s~ao 0 luiz do paraitinga (23°13 w), 23 km down- stream from our sampling site. water temperature was measured once monthly during the afternoon of each fish survey with a thermometer. 0 s, 45°19 fish sampling and collection of life history data fishes were collected monthly between january and december 2004 with six gillnets (mesh sizes from 1.5 to 4.0 cm between adjacent knots), three funnel traps (2.0 9 1.0 m, mesh = 0.25 cm and a seine net between adjacent knots). sampling effort was standar- dised to 12 h for gillnets and funnel traps, and seine net effort was standardised as 10 pulls taken during the morning along patches of the submerged macro- phyte potamogeton polygonus cham. & schltdl. where fish were most abundant. the seine net yielded more specimens than gillnets and funnel traps. two other sites positioned downstream from ribeir~ao grande (paraibuna and ipiranga rivers) were sampled monthly during the same period (gomiero & braga 2006), but yielded only three individuals of astyanax intermedius, suggesting that the species does not have self-sustaining populations in those habitats. pattern of biomass allocation of astyanax intermedius specimens were fixed in formalin 10% and pre- served in alcohol 70%. voucher specimens were deposited in the fish collection of universidade fed- eral do rio grande do sul (ufrgs 10821). in the laboratory, we measured standard length (sl - cm), total weight (tw - g), stomach weight (sw - g) and gonad weight (gw - g), and recorded sex, stage of gonad maturation, food quantity on stomach and degree of fat accumulation within the visceral cavity. four different gonad maturation stages were identi- fied (immature/juveniles, maturing, fully mature and spent) following standard macroscopically classifica- tions based on size, shape and degrees of vascularisa- tion and transparency (vazzoler 1996; alkins-koo 2000). to estimate fecundity, mature ovaries were weighed, immersed in gilson’s solution and period- ically shaken to dissociate oocytes. once separated, oocytes were preserved in 70% alcohol, and the number of oocytes was estimated according to the volumetric method (vazzoler 1996) by the expres- sion n = s 9 n/s, where s is the volume of alco- hol used to homogenise the mass of oocytes and n is the total number of oocytes counted in a sam- ple of s volume obtained with a stempel pipette (2 ml). a subsample of 100 oocytes was randomly selected from each ovary and measured using an ocular micrometre (at 109 magnification). astyanax intermedius has fractional spawning, and the distri- bution of oocyte sizes has more than one mode (u. p. souza, unpublished data). therefore, the minimal diameter of mature oocytes was deter- mined by their visual appearance (mature oocytes are opaque, west 1990). also, mature oocytes were only considered to be those greater than or equal to the size of last mode of the distribution. batch then estimated as fec = p 9 n, fecundity was where p is the proportion of mature oocytes esti- mated within each ovary. this procedure, although not as precise as histological determination (west to allow fecundity estima- 1990), has been useful tion in fractional (braga et al. 2007; gomiero et al. 2007, 2008). spawners data analysis analyses examined relationships between monthly rainfall (rf) and water temperature (temp) and indi- cators of food intake, body condition and reproduc- tive investment. we used monthly rainfall data for the year of 2004 obtained from the historical series while water temperature was measured in the field during fish sampling. for all multiple regression the pearson correlation models described below, coefficient was calculated to test for colinearity among the predictor variables. 125 souza et al. food intake we evaluated the proportion of stomachs with food (es) and the stomach weight (sw) as functions of rainfall and water temperature. the analyses were performed separately for immatures, males and females, and using fishes that came from all three sampling gears. es was coded as 0 for empty stom- achs and 1 for stomachs with any amount of food inside. es was used as response variable in the fol- lowing multiple logistic regression model: ¼ b0 þ b1  rf þ b2  temp (1)   es 1   es log the statistical significance of each predictor was obtained by comparing the log-likelihood of the full (all predictors included) and reduced (excluding a single predictor variable) models using the likelihood ratio v2 statistic. sw was calculated only for stomachs containing some amount of food and used in the following mul- tiple linear regression model: log swð þ¼b0þb1log slð log temp þ þþb2log rfð þþb3 (2) ð sl was included in this model to account for dif- ferences of body size on sw as larger fishes are also expected to have heavier stomachs. by doing so, the partial regression coefficients b2 and b3 measure the isolated effects of rainfall and temperature on stom- ach weights. body condition we used the proportion of fishes with fat (fat) in the visceral cavity and the eviscerated fish weight (efw) to model the effect of rainfall and water tem- perature on the fish condition. the analyses were per- formed separately for immatures, males and females. fat was coded as 0 for fishes without fat and 1 for fishes with fat, and used as response variable in a logistic regression model similar to eq. 1. we calculated the eviscerated fish weight (efw) by subtracting the stomach (sw) and gonad (gw) weights from total weight (tw). efw was consid- ered a surrogate measure for fish condition, as it rep- resents the weight of all somatic tissue plus the energy reserves that a fish can store in a given moment. for immature fishes, only the stomach weight was removed, as there was no developed gonad. also, we did not consider the weight of the other organs given that these were only minor com- ponents of total weight when compared to gonads and stomachs. multiple linear regression models were used to examine the influence of rainfall and water 126 temperature on log (efw) following the same expression described in eq. 2 when taking into account for differences in fish standard length. reproduction the gonadosomatic index (gsi) was calculated by dividing gonad weight by total fish weight, and mean values for males and females were compared with a t test. rainfall and water the same expression described in eq. 1 was used to model the proportion of adults in reproduction as function of temperature. the response variable was coded as 0 for maturing adults and 1 for fully mature adults (those with gonads in the last stage of maturation). immature fishes were not considered, and analyses were performed sepa- rately for males and females. linear the combined influence of rainfall and water tem- perature with the logarithm of gonad weight (gw) of adults was tested using multiple linear regression using an expression similar to eq. 2. we verified that log-transformation resulted in a relation between the response and predictor variables, but did not correct for the normality of residuals, implying that the standard t distribution could not be used to estimate the significance of the partial regression coef- ficients. thus, probability values were calculated by comparing the observed partial regression coefficients with empirical distributions generated by a randomisa- tion routine using 10,000 permutations (manly 2007). overall, we ran 18 multiple regression models to test the effects of rainfall and temperature on the response variables for immatures, males and females. to control for the family-wise type i error rate, we applied the bonferroni correction. for a = 0.05, the significance level for each individual test was consid- ered at 0.05/4 = 0.0125 for immature, 0.05/6 = 0.008 for males and 0.05/8 = 0.006 for females. the bon- ferroni method is considered a conservative correc- tion, that is, it can result in higher type ii error rates for individual tests (quinn & keough 2002). in the present paper, this implies that only individual traits strongly correlated with monthly rainfall or water temperature were considered statistically significant. the relationship between gonad weight, food intake and body condition a hypothesised reduction in food intake by a. inter- medius during gonad maturation could result in two patterns. first, the incidence of stomachs with food in mature fishes could decrease if fish decrease foraging activity as gonads become larger. second, there could be a negative correlation between stomach fullness (or weight) and gonad size if fish reduce foraging or if enlarged gonads limit the space within the body cavity for expansion of the stomach. the first pattern was tested with a logistic regres- sion model, according to   es 1   es log ¼ b0 þ b1  rgwxsl (3) es is the same variable used in eq. 1, and rgwxsl log to is the residual obtained from the regression: (gw) = b0 + b1 9 log(sl). this was done account for fish size differences in gonad weight. the second pattern was tested by calculating the partial pearson correlation (rpartial) between log(gw) and log(sw) after accounting for the effect of fish size (sl). to visualise graphically the partial correla- tion patterns, we plotted the residuals from the regres- sion between log(gw) ~ log(sl) with the residuals from the regression between log(sw) ~ log(sl). if fish reduce their feeding during the spawning period, a trade-off between body condition and repro- ductive investment should appear. in this case, one would expect to find less fish with fat in the visceral cavity as gonad weight increases. this prediction was tested by a logistic regression using fat as the response variable and rgwxsl as predictor. this trade-off also could be evidenced by a negative corre- lation between efw and gw, while accounting for fish size. this was tested by calculating the partial pearson correlation coefficient between log(efw) and log(gw) when controlling for sl. these ana- lyses were performed separately for adult males and females. four tests for males and four tests for females were performed; therefore, bonferroni correction was used to adjust the significance level to p ≤ 0.0125. results environmental data historical rainfall averages 1246 mm per year, with a minimum of 729 mm in 1963 and a maximum of 1895 mm in 1983. there was no tendency for rainfall to increase or decrease from 1936 to 2010 (r = 0.11, p = 0.34). intra-annual seasonality was apparent, with higher values from september to march and lower values from april to august (fig. 1a). the wettest months (january and february, average rain- fall of 207 mm) receive 6–7 times more rain than the driest (july and august, average rainfall of 30 mm). during 2004, total rainfall was 1323 mm, which is close to the historical average. from march to july, the monthly rainfall was around 100 mm, and the dri- est months were august (no registered rain) and sep- tember (25 mm). there were two peaks of rainfall in pattern of biomass allocation of astyanax intermedius (a) (b) fig. 1. historical data of monthly rainfall between 1936 and 2010 with mean, maximum and minimum values measured at the 0 gauging station of s~ao luiz do paraitinga town (23°13 s, 0 45°19 w) (a) and data on monthly rainfall and water temperature in 2004 (b). february (304 mm) and november in june (75 mm) and july (74 mm), rainfall was more intense than the historical average and in december (72 mm), rainfall was less than half the long-term average. (207 mm). mean water temperature during 2004 was 17.9 °c, with highest values in november (22 °c) and lowest in july (14 °c) (fig. 1b). there was no significant correlation between monthly rainfall and water tem- perature in 2004 (r = 0.26, p = 0.41), which allowed us to estimate their independent effects on response variables using multiple regression models. effects of rainfall and water temperature based on our sample of 761 fishes, the number of stomachs with food and stomach weight was not cor- related with rainfall or water temperature, and the only significant result was a strong positive relationship between stomach weight and fish size, which is expected given that larger fish have larger stomachs. the proportions of males and immatures with visceral fat were not correlated with rainfall and temperature, whereas the proportion of females with fat decreased with rainfall (n = 302, brf =  0.008, p < 0.001) and eviscerated female weight decreased with both rainfall (n = 203, brf =  0.02, p < 0.001) and tem- perature (n = 203, btemp =  0.23, p < 0.001). for 127 souza et al. males, eviscerated body weight decreased with rainfall (n = 170, brf =  0.01, p = 0.005). as expected, the correlation between eviscerated body weight and sl was positive and highly significant for all groups (table 1). fish with mature gonads were collected throughout the year, and the proportional weight of testes was approximately half that of ovaries (gsitestes = 0.05, gsiovaries = 0.11, t = 14.93, d.f. = 343, p < 0.001). standard lengths for mature females ranged from 5.3 to 9.0 cm and for mature males, from 4.7 to 7.8 cm. we analysed a total 212 mature paired ovaries, and batch fecundity ranged from 538 to 6727 mature oocytes (mean = 2688.7, sd = 1278.8). the proportion of mature males did not vary with rainfall or water temperature, whereas the proportion of mature females increased with water temperature (n = 302, brf = 0.215, p < 0.001). testis weight (n = 133, was negatively correlated with rainfall btemp =  0.05, p = 0.001); temperature was posi- table 1. summary of regression models for immatures, males and females of astyanax intermedius showing samples sizes (n) and partial regression coefficients for fish standard length (bsl), monthly rainfall (brf) and water temperature (btemp). response variable predictors immature males females feeding proportion of stomachs with food stomach weight body condition proportion of fishes with fat eviscerated weight reproduction proportion of mature adults gonad weight fecundity oocyte size n brf btemp n bsl brf btemp n brf btemp n bsl brf btemp n brf btemp n bsl brf btemp n bsl brf btemp n bsl brf btemp 244 ns ns 57 1.40* ns ns 244 ns ns 57 3.01* ns ns 215 ns ns 200 302 ns ns 295 2.32* ns ns 2.83* ns ns 302  0.008* ns 203 215 ns ns 170 2.86* 3.03*  0.01*  0.02*  0.23* ns 215 ns ns 133 3.50*  0.05* ns 302 ns 0.215* 209 2.89* ns 1.15* 203 2.93* ns ns 203 ns ns 0.29* ns, nonsignificant results. *indicates p ≤ 0.0125 for immatures, p ≤ 0.008 for males and p ≤ 0.006 for females. 128 (n = 209, tively correlated with ovarian weight btemp = 1.15, p < 0.001) and oocyte size (n = 203, btemp = 0.29, p = 0.001), but not with fecundity (n = 203, btemp = 0.54, p = 0.026). as expected, body length was positively correlated with ovarian weight and fecundity, but not with oocyte size (table 1). appendix s1 provides full descriptions of the regression models. the relationship between gonad weight, food intake and body condition the proportion of stomachs with food had a signifi- cant and negative correlation with ovarian weight (n = 275, bgw =  0.589, p = 0.002), but this pat- tern was not observed for testis weight (n = 170, bgw =  0.046, p = 0.880). the partial correlation coefficient (i.e. corrected for differences of fish size) between stomach weight and gonad weight was non- rpartial =  0.09, significant p = 0.268, fig. 2a) but significant and negative for p = 0.007, females fig. 2c).

(rankin & jensen 1993; lewis 2008). for example, patterson et al. (2013) found a positive effect of tem- perature on mass-specific metabolic rate of paddlefish (polyodon spathula), and pauly and pullin (1988) provided evidence that time to hatching for eggs of 84 teleost fishes is reduced at higher temperatures. the influence of temperature on physiology should be particularly strong for temperate-zone fishes, but could temperature also affect life history strategies of subtropical and tropical fishes? we did not find evi- dence of an association between temperature and food intake, nor between temperature and body con- dition of males and immature fish. male reproductive investment also did not correlate with temperature. in contrast, temperature was positively correlated with reproductive investment in females in terms of the proportion of mature females, gonad weight and oocyte diameter. temperature can influence fish reproduction by means other than its direct effects on physiology. if seasonal temperature variation is a reliable predictor or indicator of conditions in stream ecosystems, it could influence fitness and life history as a cue for spawning (beschta et al. 1989). in this case, strate- gies favouring biomass allocation to reproductive tis- sues would be correlated with temperature variation as a consequence of adaptative evolution. during our study period, water temperature ranged from 14 °c (july) to 22 °c (december), and monthly temperature variation in this headwater stream may be more pre- dictable than flow variation that is strongly controlled by unpredictable local rainfall. thus, the influence of temperature on reproductive effort in females might have resulted from a combination of proximate fac- tors related to higher fish metabolism (promoting gametogenesis) and ultimate factors related to adapta- tive processes that direct a higher proportion of assimilated mass/energy to reproductive tissues at the appropriate time. in addition, given that the increase in gonad weight as function of temperature was more strongly associated with larger oocytes than with higher larvae emerge during warmer periods. pauly and pullin (1988) showed that interspecific variation in egg diameter is positively correlated with water tempera- ture. our results suggest that this positive relationship may also be an intraspecific tendency. if so, it would be interesting to test the hypothesis that higher eggs and larvae result in higher larval survivorship. for example, nunn et al. (2003) found that years with warmer temperatures resulted in stronger early life stage recruitment, although the authors could not separate effects of higher temperatures from lower discharges. is possible that larger fecundity, it we observed a negative correlation between repro- ductive investment and body condition of females, 130 which is consistent with the hypothesis that females with developing ovaries cannot assimilate energy suf- ficient to produce significant energy reserves. ovarian weight was negatively correlated with both stomach weight and the proportion of stomachs with food. thus, it appears that food intake and body condition are lower during the spawning period when energy and biomass are allocated to reproduction. similar patterns were observed for other characid fishes that have lower food intake during the spawning season (braga & gennari filho 1990; lampert et al. 2004) when energy reserves are mobilised for maintenance and reproduction (nikolsky 1963; costa & braga 1993; link & burnett 2001). reduced food intake is most conspicuous when reproduction involves paren- tal care or migration, but in the case of a small fish, this pattern could arise from limited space within the visceral cavity. for example, braga (2004) examined the gonad structure of small stream fishes in another basin of the same region as our study site (species of the genera characidium, trichomycterus and imparfi- nis). these fishes possess mature ovaries that form a single structure along the superior wall of visceral cav- ity in an arrangement that appears to maximise egg storage within a small space. the morphology of the paired ovaries in a. intermedius is not as specialised, but mature ovaries of a. intermedius often fill most of the visceral cavity, compressing most of the other organs (f.m.s. braga, personal observation). male reproductive investment was uncorrelated with tem- perature and rainfall, and seemed to be relatively con- stant throughout the year. production of spermatozoa requires less energy and material than egg production; therefore, reproductive investment by males revealed no significant relation- ship with food intake and body condition. it might be expected that our findings differed from other studies in tropical and subtropical regions; patterns of food acquisition and biomass allocation were not correlated with rain- fall. in addition, monthly variation in water tempera- ture influenced reproductive effort only in females, and this higher reproductive investment in concert with higher temperatures may incur a trade-off with somatic growth and survival. given that several spe- cies within the ‘scabripinnis complex’ are found in small headwater streams over a broad region of southeastern brazil (moreira-filho & bertollo 1991; bertaco & lucena 2006), future comparative studies could reveal whether patterns observed in the present study are consistent for different populations or spe- cies from different locations. also, we should men- tion that a sampling date effect may be present in our results. in this case, the fish traits would be more similar within than among months due to other factors not related to water temperature or monthly rainfall, so that the results presented herein should be confirmed with longer time series or with controlled experiments. acknowledgements this project was partially supported by the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientıfico e tecnologico (cnpq process 140180/2005-2) by means of a phd scholarship
