aquatic environments (onema); conseil départemental des pyrénées atlantiques abstract gathering information on both individual movement and gene flow is rarely possible when studying dispersal among populations in fish species. it is, however, possible to assess both at a reasonable cost in salmo_trutta l. on the atlantic coast of europe where the facultative anadromous species is composed of discrete populations of brown_trout residents occupying distinct river systems, but exchanging phenotypically distinguishable sea_trout migrants. we performed two kinds of genetic analyses using individual microsatellite genotypes: the stock identification of sea_trout entering each corridor and the estimates of effective dispersal through each corridor. we observed that individual movement (nonlocal individuals of each source population ranging from 4% to 35% of the sea_trout run) never translates into effective dispersal except in one of four migratory corridors examined. the likely origin of this uniquely detected gene flow event is discussed in the light of well- documented migratory fish management actions undertaken in the past in the studied area. k e y w o r d s brown_trout, effective dispersal, homing, sea_trout, straying 1 |  introduction dispersal has considerable impacts on both the dynamics and genet- ics of species and is of prime importance for species persistence and abundance in a spatially and temporally variable environment. movement is particularly critical for fish species due to the contrasted and patchy habitats needed for spawning, feeding, rearing or shelter- ing, in order to complete their life cycle (schlosser, 1991). freshwater fish sometimes have to move long distances within a river system to reach the specific habitats required for each stage of their life history (jonsson & jonsson, 2011). in the case of anadromous fish, individual movement behaviour is even more complex and occurs over greater distances because they additionally include marine/freshwater migra- tions through a succession of fluvial, estuarine, coastal and marine environments. in anadromous fish species, this results in population genetic differentiation levels intermediate between freshwater and marine fish species (ward, woodwark, & skibinski, 1994). knowledge of individual movement of anadromous fish between all habitats is therefore a fundamental prerequisite for addressing issues of fish conservation and management. although gathering data on individual movement and effective dispersal is particularly difficult for fish biolo- gists and ecologists, it is the only way to provide managers with appro- priate information that will help them to adopt informed management or conservation strategies (fausch, torgersen, baxter, & li, 2002). assessing dispersal in wild populations of anadromous fish is chal- lenging because of the numerous habitats they occupy throughout their life cycle. in the facultative anadromous salmo_trutta linnaeus, the anadromous form (called sea_trout) is able to live in brackish or saltwater, while the resident form spends its entire life in a river. sea_trout migrates from freshwater to sea at an immature stage and returns to freshwater to spawn. as in any other salmonid species, the anadromous form is phenotypically distinct from the resident form by its silvery appearance, its body colour and punctuations, the transpar- ency of its fins and, after time spent at sea, its greater size compared to the resident trout of the same age. both migrant and resident forms are found along the atlantic coast, but sea_trout are not as widespread. ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:323–338. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff   |  323 © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons

guyomard, & alexandrino, 2006). controlled crosses between sea_trout and resident trout produce via- ble and fertile progeny under experimental conditions (skrochowska, 1969a). this suggests that mating between the two forms is possible in natural populations too, but it has been rarely observed (campbell, 1977; goodwin, andrew, iwan, ibbotson, & stevens, 2016), and the frequency at which it occurs is still largely unknown. moreover, the absence of genetic differentiation found between sea_trout and resi- dent trout from the same stream suggests that they constitute a pan- mictic population (charles, roussel, lebel, baglinière, & ombredane, 2006; hindar, jonsson, ryman, & stahl, 1991). the marine phase is recognised as the part of brown_trout life his- tory with the largest knowledge gaps (ices, 2013). information about marine sojourn of sea_trout, for example the existence of migration routes or feeding areas (quéméré et al., 2016), is scarce especially in the southern part of the sea_trout distribution area. the distance covered by sea_trout during its marine migration is variable but gen- erally dramatically shorter than by salmo_salar linnaeus. sea_trout move frequently between river, estuary and sea habitats (etheridge, harrod, bean, & adams, 2008; jensen et al., 2012; pemberton, 1976; pratten & shearer, 1983b), and contrary to expectations, upstream movements are not always related to reproduction (king, hillman, elsmere, stockley, & stevens, 2016; nall, 1930). most sea_trout indi- viduals stay in seawater nearby their natal river mouth (berg & berg, 1987; skrochowska, 1969b) but may also move to non- natal estuaries (degerman, leonardsson, & lundqvist, 2012) and non- natal streams (jensen, diserud, finstad, fiske, & rikardsen, 2015). the propensity to visit non- natal streams during marine migration (straying) appears to be more common among sea_trout individuals originating from small streams (degerman et al., 2012) or among those that have not reached sexual maturity (jensen et al., 2015). long- distant marine migration has also been observed with a handful of individuals sampled several hundred kilometres away from their natal river (balmain & shearer, 1956; euzenat, fournel, & richard, 1991; pratten & shearer, 1983a; skrochowska, 1969b). northward marine migration has often been reported in europe for sea_trout individuals native from bresle, france (euzenat et al., 1991), vistula, poland (bartel, pachur, & bernaś, 2010; skrochowska, 1969b), north esk, scotland (pratten & shearer, 1983b), himlean, sweden (aldven, hedger, okland, rivinoja, & hojesjo, 2015), vardnes, norway (berg & berg, 1987). on the contrary, a dominant southward marine direction prevails for native sea_trout individuals from tweed, scotland (balmain & shearer, 1956). however, because direction is inferred from the recapture of tagged sea_trout by trapping or fishing and because these two activities are not evenly distributed among rivers and along the coast, these trends should be considered with caution. for s. trutta as for all facultative anadromous fishes, the anadro- mous form is the only way for resident wild populations occupying distinct river systems to exchange individuals and genes. genetic exchange among wild populations of resident trout can only occur when immigrant fishes reproduce in a non- natal river system (effective masson et al. dispersal). irrespective of the location of s. trutta populations along the atlantic coast, smoltification and subsequent migration into marine waters do not occur before 1 year of age (richard & bagliniere, 1990; toledo, lemaire, baglinière, & brana, 1993). consequently, when wild populations are separated by the ocean, a genetic exchange can only be mediated by sea_trout effective dispersal, that is the movement and reproduction of nonlocal sea_trout individuals from previous generations. on the contrary, genetic exchange between sites from the same river system can result from effective dispersal of either or both ecotypes. striking examples of sea_trout- mediated gene flow are found in case of invasion following human- mediated introduc- tions (e.g. lecomte, beall, chat, davaine, & gaudin, 2013) or recol- onisation of coastal rivers following recurrent local extinctions (e.g. ostergaard, hansen, loeschcke, & nielsen, 2003). in long- established populations, however, gene flow between river systems is far less common than gene flow within river system (morán, pendas, garcía- vázquez, izquierdo, & lobón- cervlá, 1995). several factors contrib- ute to restricting gene flow between populations occupying distinct river systems. first, high mortality rates are reported for sea_trout during marine migration (aldven et al., 2015; berg & jonsson, 1990). second, homing behaviour is reported for sea_trout during spawning migration, as first documented by menzies (1919). third, gene flow between river systems has been found to be negatively correlated to spatial distance between river mouths (bouza, arias, castro, sanchez, & martinez, 1999; morán et al., 1995). fourth, by favouring native fish, local adaptation can restrict gene flow at a spatial scale depending on the strength of the divergent selection between populations (hansen, ruzzante, nielsen, bekkevold, & mensberg, 2002; meier, hansen, bekkevold, skaala, & mensberg, 2011). in rivers of the southwest of france, both s. trutta anadromous and resident forms are present. the anadromous form is abundant in the river adour, which runs for more than 300 km from the pyrenees to the inner bay of biscay and a few thousands of them are trapped every year. in that area, both forms are the target of fisheries. recreational in- river angling of the resident form is common in the upper part of riv- ers and commercial net fishing of sea_trout is authorised in the lower- most 40 km of the river adour. in this context, monitoring of s. trutta populations and assessment of stock enhancement impacts are nec- essary to ensure sustainable management strategies are in place for fishing activities. the monitoring programme adopted for adour and surrounding rivers includes both juvenile electrofishing surveys and the trapping of sea_trout during their upstream migration. in this study, straying and effective dispersal were compared in rivers draining into the south- eastern corner of the bay of biscay. the key question we aimed to answer is whether and to what extent immi- grant sea_trout actually contributes to gene flow between populations. s. trutta populations in the region are genetically well differentiated among river systems (cortey, vera, pla, & garcia- marin, 2009) and even within adour (aurelle & berrebi, 2001; aurelle, cattaneo- berrebi, & berrebi, 2002), providing a unique opportunity to track sea_trout movements and to estimate nonlocal sea_trout contribution to regional gene flow. specifically, based on a microsatellite genetic baseline from an extensive sampling of both freshwater juvenile and sea_trout fishes, masson et al. we (i) quantified sea_trout straying by calculating, for sea_trout run from each corridor, the immigration rate from each population of ori- gin and (ii) estimated recent gene flow among each genetically distinct populations by considering juvenile individual’s immigrant ancestry over the last few generations. juveniles (mostly 0+) are assumed to be representative of their sampling drainage because their young age hampered long- distance movement within river system (bagliniere & maisse, 2002) and pre- vent them from migrating across salted water between river sys- tems. at the opposite, sea_trout fishes sampled during their upstream migration could originate either from the river they were sampled in or alternatively from another river of the same (intrabasin move- ment) or of another river system (interbasin movement through the sea). therefore, comparing the genetic composition of sea_trout runs with the juvenile baseline sampled in the various river systems allows quantifying sea_trout movement across the studied area, while infer- ring immigrant ancestry of juveniles up to two generations in the past allows quantifying recent effective dispersal. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area the study area is located in southwest of france and comprises the large adour river system together with several coastal streams located further south (figure 1, table s1). the study area is divided into eight nonoverlapping geographical areas corresponding to either a single large or a group of geographically proximate small drainages. first, five areas were considered within the adour basin: (i) nives (the most downstream tributary drainage area), (ii) lower adour including minor downstream tributaries such as ardanavy, aran and bidouze, (iii) gave d’oloron, (iv) gave de pau and (v) upper adour including adour and all its tributaries in its upstream end. second, the coastal streams located south of adour were aggregated in two distinct groups, the so- called french coastal streams (fcs) group encompassing the rivers uhabia, antereneko erreka, untxin and nivelle and the spanish coastal streams (scs) group encompassing bidasoa and urumea. immediately north of the adour estuary, a few coastal rivers, which rarely house salmonids, were ignored. finally, a tributary of the river garonne, that is neste d’aure (corresponding to the letter f and the number 8 respectively in figures 1 and 2), was also sampled. water salinity in the coastal plume of the river adour ranged between 30 and 35 g/l (sharif et al., 2014). the marine water intru- sion limit in adour estuary is located about 12 km from the mouth. the confluence of nive and adour, 6 km upstream from the mouth, is thus under tidal influence and, in this area, water salinity cannot be consid- ered as freshwater because it ranges from 3 to 30 g/l depending on both the depth and the tide (goni- urriza et al., 2007). there are four french salmonid migratory corridors widely known in the study area, the three major tributaries of adour (nive, gave d’oloron, and gave de pau) and, to a lesser extent, the nivelle coastal stream. as other french rivers, adour was affected by artificial migra- tion barriers due to construction of dams for hydropower production     |  325 or irrigation. the loss of connectivity in adour river was at its max- imum in the first half of the nineteenth century, resulting in a dra- matic decline of anadromous salmonid populations. since the 1980s, however, habitat connectivity has been continuously improved. accessibility of upstream spawning sites to salmonid fishes, albeit incomplete, is now operational in all four salmonid migratory corridors as detailed in perrier, le gentil, ravigne, gaudin, and salvado (2014). however, despite ongoing efforts, spawning of anadromous salmonids remains rare in the upper part of gave de pau. at the time of study, all four corridors except gave de pau were equipped with permanent fish traps (figure 1) to catch, count, phenotype and sample for scales ascending sea_trout individuals during their upstream migration. 2.2 | sample collection sampling of juvenile individuals was conducted by electrofishing throughout the study area from 2011 to 2014. to minimise the risk of any temporal bias, all eight study areas but scs were visited at least twice in the 4- year period. between 1 and 15 juveniles (body length <15 mm) were captured per sampling site, preferentially young- of- the- year (0+) or alternatively 1- year- old (1+) individuals. a total of 101 sampling sites were visited over the entire study area with 806 juveniles monitored for age and sampled for tissue (figure 1). for tis- sue collection, fish were anaesthetised and a small piece of fin was subsequently collected, preserved in 95% ethanol and stored at 4°c until dna extraction. a total of 615 sea_trout adults were sampled for scales in the study area throughout the upstream migration period. of these, 457 were captured between 2010 and 2013 at permanent fish traps set on nive, gave d’oloron and nivelle. as sea_trout upstream migration was not monitored on gave de pau during the study period, historical sam- pling of scale tissue collected in 2002 was used for dna typing of 148 sea_trout adults, then caught at two hydroelectric downstream dams across gave de pau (puyoo and baigts). puyoo sea_trout which size was over 45 cm were subsequently transferred to spawning grounds located approximately 100 km upstream in gave de pau (saint- pé- de- bigorre) as a measure for conservation management (barracou, 2003). for possible identification of origin of potentially long- distance straying sea_trout immigrants, juvenile and resident adult brown_trout individuals from outside the study area were included in the baseline when conducting genetic assignment analyses. the atlantic north outgroup was constituted of 65 tissue samples from french rivers: leyre (corresponding to the letter g and number 9 respectively in figures 1 and 2), blavet and scorff (both corresponding to the letter h in figure 1), couesnon and selune (both corresponding to the let- ter i in figure 1), a polish river: slupia (corresponding to the letter j in figure 1) and a swedish river: dalälven (corresponding to the letter k in figure 1). the six last rivers were pooled into the single sample 10 in figure 2. the atlantic south outgroup was constituted of 25 tissue samples from rivers of the iberian peninsula: narcea flowing in the cantabrian sea (corresponding to the letter d in figure 1) and agueda, tormes and esla belonging to duero drainage (corresponding respec- tively to the letters a–c in figure 1). these four last rivers were pooled 326  |     masson et al. figure 1 map of the study area and its localisation in europe (inset) based on the french national hydro- geographical database (bd

potentially used for stocking rivers of the study area, more than 30 individuals from each of five different strains of domesticated brown_trout reared in four local hatcheries were included. finally, to poten- tially identify close relatives (sampling errors or hybrids) of the atlantic brown_trout in the samples, more than 20 conspecific individuals from the nearby ebro’s headwaters (river flowing into the mediterranean basin, corresponding to the letter e and number 7 respectively in figures 1 and 2) and belonging to the adriatic mitochondrial lineage (based on mitochondrial sequences from the d- loop, data not shown) masson et al.     |  327 figure 2 bayesian structure analysis showing the distribution of eleven genetic clusters detected with no a priori partitioning among streams. each

kalinowski, 2004) and pairwise fst values (weir & cockerham, 1984) between juvenile and sea_trout groups and to test temporal stability of nivelle sea_trout runs. statistical significance was tested by 10,000 randomising multilocus genotypes between pairs of populations. 2.4.2 | genetic clustering the bayesian clustering approach implemented in the program structure version 2.3.4 (falush, stephens, & pritchard, 2003; pritchard, stephens, & donnelly, 2000) was used to infer popula- tion genetic structure. all individual genotypes were analysed jointly to assess the number of clusters that best fit the genotypic data and estimate the probability that each individual belong to each of the detected genetic cluster. the geographical extent of the genetic clus- ters and the relationship between the different types of individuals sampled were then determined. the most likely number of genetic masson et al. clusters was determined following the hierarchical approach of evanno, regnaut, and goudet (2005) in which a first analysis is per- formed on the entire data set to determine the most likely number of clusters explaining the higher hierarchical level using delta k (evanno et al., 2005) estimated with structure harvester version 0.6.92 (earl, 2012). a second round was then performed independently on individ- uals in each of the previously identified clusters and additional rounds of analysis were performed on subsets of the data set until no further structure could be detected. for each analysis, the admixture ances- try and the correlated allele frequencies models (falush et al., 2003; pritchard et al., 2000) were used with a burn- in period of 100,000 markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) iterations followed by 200,000 mcmc repetitions. the number of clusters k was set from 1 to 12 with 20 independent runs for each k value. the overall optimal k was determined by summing all k values obtained at the lowest hierarchi- cal level of the iterative analyses. a final run on the entire data set was then performed with this overall optimal k, using a burn- in period of 500,000 mcmc iterations followed by 1,000,000 mcmc repeti- tions, with three independent runs to check the congruence between results from the iterative procedure and the overall analysis. 2.4.3 | admixture analysis of sea_trout implemented a genetic mixture analysis in oncor software (kalinowski, manlove, & taper, 2007) was used to identify the popu- lation of origin of sea_trout sampled in the four migratory corridors considering all the samples collected except sea_trout as a baseline reference. in a first step, the power and precision expected from the mixture analysis was evaluated by simulations using the “100% simu- lations” feature and a cross- validation method (anderson, waples, & kalinowski, 2008) implemented in oncor version 1.0 (kalinowski et al., 2007). the simulated sample size was set at 500 individuals, and 10,000 simulations were performed to assess assignment rate. a correct assignment greater than 90% indicates that baseline pop- ulations have been adequately delineated for assigning individuals (smith, templin, seeb, & seeb, 2005). in a second step, the estimation of sea_trout stock mixture proportions was performed using oncor (kalinowski et al., 2007) with 10,000 bootstraps and 95% confidence intervals. 2.4.4 | estimation of recent migration rates bayesass program (wilson & rannala, 2003) was used to estimate the recent migration rates (m) in the last two generations taking into account all wild and domestic samples collected throughout the study area except sea_trout. a total of 10 independent runs using differ- ent seed numbers and consisting of a burn- in of 1,000,000 iterations followed by 10,000,000 recorded iterations were performed with the mixing parameters set respectively to 0.60, 0.95 and 0.30 for allele frequency, inbreeding and migration rate to obtain satisfactory acceptance rate (following bayesass manual). for these 10 runs, none of the nonimmigrant ratios were getting stuck at the 0.67 or 1 prior boundaries as recommended by (faubet, waples, & gaggiotti, 2007). masson et al.     |  329 the bayesian deviance measure was used to determine the run which best fits the data. a final analysis was then performed using the same seed number as the best run and increasing the number of iterations to 30,000,000. posterior mean migration rates and the highest poste- rior density (hpd) intervals were calculated with the package r coda (plummer, best, cowles, & vines, 2006). surprisingly, sea_trout groups between northern and southern regions showed the same low level of genetic differentiation (mean: 0.054; min–max: 0.008–0.087) as juvenile groups within northern and south- ern regions (table 2). when comparing entering sea_trout with the resident juveniles sampled upstream, genetic differentiation was very low, but still statistically significant (mean: 0.016, min–max: 0.004– 0.028; underlined in table 2). 3 |  results 3.1 | microsatellite analyses a total of 1816 individuals were genotyped for 11 microsatellite markers. locus ssosl417 was removed from further analyses due to unspecific amplifications. considering the 10 remaining loci, 4% of genotypes had missing data, 5% at one locus and 0.6% at two loci. a total of 56 individuals (3%) that failed to amplify at more than three loci were excluded. for the remaining 1,760 individuals, one ran- domly selected representative individual per full- sib family was kept for further analyses. full- sibs were detected neither within sea_trout samples nor within atlantic salmon samples. the final data set used for genetic analyses was thus composed of 1,411 individuals belong- ing to independent full- sib families, namely 584 juveniles collected in the study area, 615 sea_trout individuals, 119 domestic trout and 93 individuals from the so- called outgroups. based on the comparison of repeated genotyping of 114 (6%) individuals, allele dropout rate and other types of error rate ranged from 0% to 2% depending on the locus considered. 3.2 | genetic diversity patterns among the 10 remaining locus, no null allele was detected using micro- checker. there was no significant linkage disequilibrium within river after correcting for multiple comparisons. thus, all loci were con- sidered to be genetically independent. significant inbreeding coeffi- cients (fis) were found for most studied groups (table 1), indicating departure from hardy–weinberg equilibrium due to heterozygote deficiency. this departure is likely due to a wahlund effect as each geographical region considered included individuals collected in dif- ferent river systems, as for scs and fcs, or in different tributaries of the same river system, as for the adour drainage (see below). the allelic richness ranged from 3.94 to 8.34 (table 1) and gene diversity from 0.50 to 0.74 (table 1) across groups. genetic differentiation among groups was significant after cor- recting for multiple comparisons, with a global fst of 0.08 [0.05–0.15] (mean and 95% confidence interval) and pairwise fst values ranging from 0.004 to 0.183 (table 2). this indicates complex population genetic structure (table 2). within the study area, while genetic dif- ferentiations between the juveniles from the southern region (fcs or scs) and those from the northern regions (nives, lower adour, gave d’oloron, gave de pau, upper adour, or neste d’aure samples) were relatively high (mean: 0.112, min–max: 0.048–0.183), differentiations between groups in the southern region amount to 0.069 and ranged from 0.014 to 0.108 (mean: 0.050) in the northern region (table 2). 3.3 | genetic clustering genetic assignment of individual multilocus genotypes in structure using the iterative hierarchical delta k approach (evanno et al., 2005) suggested k = 11 as the optimal number of clusters (figure 2; fig. s1). except for lower and upper adour, each juvenile group is character- ised by a specific dominant genetic cluster (figure 2a). the geographi- cal distribution of, and the genetic relationships between, the genetic clusters strictly follows the hierarchy of the river network (figures 1 and 2a,e). the most genetically divergent clusters are cluster i (grey), comprising s. salar individuals, followed by cluster ii (red), correspond- ing to samples collected in the headwaters of the river ebro flow- ing into the mediterranean basin (figure 2a,e). interestingly, genetic cluster ii is also present in gave de marcadau, located in the headwa- ters of gave de pau, a place expected to be occupied by the atlantic mitochondrial lineage (bernatchez, 2001). all others less divergent clusters represent the atlantic lineage (figure 2a,e). the two closely related clusters iii (light blue) and iv (dark blue) correspond to the southernmost groups respectively scs and fcs. the two closely related clusters v (purple) and vi (dark purple) correspond to nives and lower adour samples. the three very genetically similar clusters vii, viii and ix, coloured in green and sharing a common branch of the tree, characterised the upper part of the adour drainage (encompass- ing gave d’oloron, gave de pau and upper adour). cluster x (orange) regroups all juveniles from the neste d’aure, a river that belongs to the garonne drainage. clusters x and xi (yellow) are mostly found in the wild populations of the north of the atlantic coast. cluster xi, and to a far lesser extent cluster x, is also present in the domestic strains hosted in hatcheries 2–5, whereas hatchery 1 is almost entirely composed of cluster ii. cluster xi and, to some extent, clusters x and ii are also scarcely found in natural populations across the study area (figure 2a). comparing the genotypes of the sea_trout individuals caught at a fish trap with those of the juvenile samples electrofished upstream of the fish trap reveals two contrasting situations. in both gave d’oloron and gave de pau, most of the sea_trout individuals cannot be genet- ically distinguished from the resident juveniles (figure 2a,b). in con- trast, in nivelle (fcs) as well as in nives, a lot of sea_trout individuals entering the drainage are genetically different from the resident juve- niles living in the drainage. a significant proportion of their genetic signal corresponds to cluster iii typical of the iberic peninsula, either from scs or even further south (figure 2a,b). this is not due to an atypical sampling year as the composition of the entering sea_trout appears to be stable over a 3- year period in the case of nivelle sea_trout (table s2, fig. s2). 330  |     masson et al. table 1 mean genetic diversity indices estimated at 10 microsatellite loci for s. trutta and s. salar following a hierarchical sampling in the bay of biscay (figure 1) samples juveniles scs fcs nives (adour) lower adour (adour) gave d’oloron (adour) gave de pau (adour) upper adour (adour) neste d’aure (garonne) sea_trout nivelle (fcs) nives (adour) gave d’oloron (adour) gave de pau (adour) hatcheries hatchery 1 hatchery 2 hatchery 3 hatchery 4 hatchery 5 outgroup atlantic south atlantic north mediterranean (ebro) salmo_salar n 70 112 175 74 102 94 147 32 110 55 302 148 32 31 32 32 31 25 65 22 23 n 51 77 131 46 78 78 97 27 110 55 302 148 20 28 25 21 25 13 46 12 23 na 90 85 108 88 88 89 100 72 119 93 106 102 61 69 60 45 55 50 149 51 94 ar 5.86 5.53 5.73 5.53 5.42 5.74 5.71 5.60 6.37 5.96 5.43 5.69 5.43 5.66 5.0 3.94 4.54 5.08 8.34 5.52 7.79 ho 0.58 0.56 0.54 0.49 0.58 0.56 0.53 0.55 0.57 0.54 0.62 0.59 0.59 0.67 0.51 0.54 0.57 0.48 0.54 0. 41 0.68 h.n.b. fis fis 95% ci 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.62 0.62 0.64 0.63 0.59 0.62 0.60 0.62 0.62 0.64 0.64 0.59 0.50 0.57 0.62 0.74 0.56 0.74 0.03 0.08 0.12 0.20 0.07 0.13 0.15 0.05 0.10 0.07 0.00 0.04 0.08 0.00 0.13 −0.05 0.01 0.30 0.26 0.29 0.10 (−0.01 to 0.07) (0.05 to 0.11) (0.07 to 0.14) (0.16 to 0.23) (0.02 to 0.07) (0.09 to 0.13) (0.11 to 0.20) (0.02 to 0.12) (0.06 to 0.11) (0.04 to 0.10) (−0.02 to 0.01) (0.03 to 0.05) (−0.03 to 0.08) (−0.11 to −0.01) (0.06 to 0.14) (−0.15 to −0.07) (−0.06 to 0.03) (0.02 to 0.29) (0.22 to 0.30) (0.03 to 0.37) (−0.03 to 0.11) n, sample size;

(migration rate of 0.19 with the highest posterior density [0.14–0.25]), from gave de pau into hatchery 1 (migration rate of 0.13 [0.03–0.24]), from fcs into scs (migration rate of 0.11 [0.04–0.18]) and from hatcheries 2–5 to upper adour (migration rate of 0.05 [0.02–0.08]). surprisingly, apart from the two gaves, no significant migration was found between the tributaries of the large river adour although they share the same estuary and the same lower mainstem. 4 |  discussion this present study was designed to address the relationship between migrant entry (exchange of individuals) and gene flow (exchange of genes) between populations in the particular case of the faculta- tive anadromous s. trutta. this question has received little attention until recently, likely due to the low levels of genetic differentiation generally observed among adjacent populations at local and regional scales. 4.1 | fine scale population genetic structure of brown_trout the present study reveals a clear genetic structuring pattern of brown_trout populations living in the rivers draining into the south- eastern corner of the bay of biscay, corroborating previous find- ings (aurelle & berrebi, 2001; aurelle et al., 2002). indeed genetic clusters are distributed following the geography of the studied river systems with an overall good correspondence between genetic dis- tances between clusters and their respective location. one possi- ble explanation is that landscape characteristics impact profoundly genetic structure of brown_trout populations. first, gene exchange between populations occupying distinct river systems is carried by sea_trout individuals only. second the dendritic shape of the fresh- water habitat may constraint gene exchange between streams within each river system. while oceans act as a dispersal barrier for resident brown_trout populations, the barrier might have operated at a different location in the past depending on historical sea levels. significant genetic dif- ferentiation was detected between brown_trout populations of the coastal streams of northern spain and those of southern france, while both groups show higher genetic differentiation with brown_trout populations located further north in the large river adour. this hierar- chical genetic structure might reflect ancient events, such as postgla- cial colonisation from distinct atlantic glacial refuge (weiss, antunes, schlotterer, & alexandrino, 2000), or ancient landscape features, such as the presence of distinct paleovalleys draining westward (bourillet, zaragosi, & mulder, 2006), these hypotheses being not mutually exclu- sive. the rivers of the studied area could have been partitioned with the southernmost rivers (e.g. nivelle and bidasoa) likely draining into a basco- cantabric paleovalley while easternmost drainages (e.g. upper adour and the two gaves) possibly flowing into an aquitaine paleoval- ley presently known as gironde (bourillet et al., 2006). these pale- ovalleys are currently flooded following the rise of sea level after the     |  333 last glaciation about 18,000 years ago. the presence of brown_trout species in the present- day adour drainage being attested as early as magdalenian (costamagno & laroulandie, 2004), about 18,000– 14,000 bp (langlais et al., 2012), it is thus possible that the genetic structure of trout populations of the bay of biscay has been shaped by the climatic and geographical conditions existing at that time. in contrast to the coastal streams, the dendritic shape of the large river adour network may have a profound impact on within- drainage population genetic structure. divisions between adour tributary sub- populations are discrete rather than gradual as if the lower part of adour acts as a barrier to gene flow for trout populations occupying distinct tributaries. such a barrier is more obvious in the lowermost part. the lower part of the river adour is currently under tidal influ- ence and is therefore periodically flooded with marine water up to approximately 15–20 km inland (goni- urriza et al., 2007; sharif et al., 2014). as the river nive meets the river adour at only 6 km from the coastline, such tidal influence could have contributed to isolate the nives population and possibly some other populations occupy- ing downstream tributaries from those occupying the upper part of the adour drainage. alternatively, the course of the river adour has changed several times in the distant past and, as recently as five centu- ries ago, it has been artificially diverted south to create its present- day estuary in bayonne (girault de saint- fargeau, 1995). genetic structur- ing of present trout populations of the adour drainage are then possi- bly influenced by ancient river courses. the general pattern of population genetic structure is less clear at a more local scale. in the headwaters, populations from gave de marcadau in red (in the gave de pau area) and bidouze in purple (in the lower adour area) genetically differ from those sampled elsewhere in the tributary drainage, while they cluster genetically with those of the neighbouring drainage, river ebro (mediterranean basin) and river nive respectively. in both cases, a natural river capture explanation fits well to the local geological context because dissolution of soluble rocks, presence of underground drainage systems and occurrence of karstic resurgences have been documented (dubois & dainat, 1963; vanara, maire, & lacroix, 1997). a less likely explanation would be his- torical human- mediated translocation of fish from one brook of the ebro headwaters (mediterranean basin) to an adjacent one from the gave de pau headwaters (atlantic basin). this hypothesis is supported by archaeological evidence of human settlements associated with pas- toral activities at high altitudes in the pyrenees mountains as early as 3,000 bc (le couédic, 2010; mazier et al., 2009). anthropogenic activities such as stocking practices seem to have contributed less to shaping the regional genetic structure of brown_trout than landscape features. four of the five domestic strains possi- bly used for stocking in the study area were found to be closely related to each other (belonging to the same genetic cluster) but different from natural populations enabling tracking of their alleles in the wild. throughout the study area, the genetic signal of the domestic strains (hatcheries 2–5) is sporadically found in both freshwater and sea_trout samples throughout the river adour, but with varying degrees of intensity. the most impacted region is undoubtedly the upper adour and the least ones the coastal streams. 334  |     even though a small diffuse background signal of domestic strains is found in all streams, genetic structuring of natural populations is sufficiently strong that it is possible to delineate freshwater popu- lation boundaries accurately enough to assign genetically sea_trout individuals to their population of origin (90% of correct assignation based on simulations in oncor) and therefore to track individual movement in sea_trout. this context offers an unprecedented oppor- tunity to assess straying and homing behaviour of sea_trout during their upstream migration at a relatively fine spatial scale and estimate gene flow resulting from straying sea_trout movement between source and sink populations. 4.2 | varying degree of straying for sea_trout fishes entering migratory corridors we found that the most common trend observed among sea_trout individuals during their upstream migration is site fidelity. it must be noted that no genotype was observed twice among the sea_trout individuals sampled preventing bias in estimation of genetic composition of sea_trout runs due to potential multiple recaptures. however, site fidelity among sea_trout runs varies depending on the river examined. the entry of nonlocal sea_trout appears more frequent into small rivers than into large ones, as first noted by degerman et al. (2012), and their proportion decreases as distance from the coastline increases, as recently noted by king et al. (2016). spain is a major source of emigration, particularly for nivelle (esti- mated rate of 30% with 95% ci [0.15–0.39]) and nives (35% with 95% ci [0.10–0.48]). this indicates that some sea_trout individuals originating from spanish rivers undertook a northward sea migration possibly following the northward direction of the marine currents observed in that area (gaudin, 2006). the river adour is the only drainage where sea_trout movements between tributaries could be assessed because brown_trout sub- populations were clearly genetically delineated there. the highest estimated proportions of straying (19% with 95% ci [0.10–0.36] and 19% with 95% ci [0.07–0.37]) were observed between gave d’oloron and gave de pau both ways but with less confidence given the weak genetic differentiation of the two gaves. in all other cases, straying movement did not exceed 11% and generally involved neighbouring tributaries. sea_trout of domestic origin (hatcheries 2–5) was detected only in gave de pau (9% of total movement), confirming that the eastern part of the adour drainage is the most impacted by domestic trout releases. 4.3 | no detectable gene flow following the entry of nonlocal sea_trout except in one case a statistically significant recent migration rate was found in only one instance of four migration runs surveyed. indeed, the average migra- tion rate from gave d’oloron into gave de pau reached 0.19 (95% ci [0.14–0.25]), indicating that between 14% and 25% of each gen- eration of trout that reproduce in gave de pau originated from gave d’oloron over the last two generations. such genetic exchange could masson et al. be the result of sea_trout effective dispersal (immigration movement followed by local reproduction) as immigration of sea_trout individuals from gave d’oloron into gave de pau was estimated at 19% in the oncor analysis. it is, however, very unlikely that such gene flow arose in that corridor simply through the effective dispersal of straying sea_trout, while gave de pau represents the longest migratory corridor for sea_trout and access of sea_trout to several of its tributaries (and their spawning grounds) is still impossible due to the presence of impass- able dams. the same holds true for the resident trout. it is much more likely that such genetic exchange was the result of human- mediated translocation in the area considering the well- documented transloca- tion of 140 large (>45 cm long) sea_trout individuals by road between 1999 and 2002 in gave de pau (barracou, 2003). lohmann, putman, and lohmann (2008) hypothesise that salmonid individuals that stray are possibly those unable to navigate back to natal sites, having not correctly imprinted on the chemical cues and magnetic fields asso- ciated with their natal site or incapable of using such information to return. this hypothesis remains to be confirmed but if true, road transportation may have disoriented sea_trout so that the nonlocal fraction of the transported sea_trout were further unable to navigate back to their natal drainage and subsequently reproduced in gave de pau drainage. similarly, the significant migration rate detected from french coastal streams into scs (38 individuals being sampled in bidasoa of a total of 51) could also be attributed to fish management prac- tices. many dams exist on the lower part of bidasoa, which severely constrain fish movement and probably prevent most sea_trout from reaching the upper part of that drainage (gosset, rives, & labonne, 2006), but stocking operations could explain the detected gene flow. in the 1970s, bidasoa was extensively restocked after major acciden- tal pollution (anon 1991a), initially with trout of french origin (anon 1991b), but these stockings took place too early to be detected in our analysis. more recently in the early 2000s, the government of navarra adopted a supportive breeding programme for salmonids in bidasoa using a broodstock consisting of adults captured at bidasoa’s fish traps, as described for atlantic salmon in leunda, ardaiz, russell, toms, and hillman (2013). as sea_trout from french coastal streams were possibly caught in the bidasoa’s fishtrap and included in the broodstock, the detected gene flow might result from this stocking programme. strikingly, while straying movement was detected in high propor- tions throughout the study area (especially in nivelle and nives), no genetic exchange that cannot be attributed to human- mediated trans- location was detected, suggesting that straying sea_trout were not sexually mature, did not successfully reproduce, or, if they did so, their fitness was unexpectedly low. the former hypothesis would be in line with recent findings in north atlantic showing that straying sea_trout are more likely young and sexually immature (jensen et al., 2015). sea_trout scale reading will possibly contribute to better understand stray- ing behaviour in our river system. in the end, what ferguson (2006) suspected is here confirmed: “effective straying […], even at the level of tributaries within rivers, is very limited, otherwise these differences among adjacent rivers would not exist.” masson et al. 4.4 | low levels of genetic introgression resulting from management practices deliberate releases of hatchery- reared s. trutta have been common practice for several decades throughout france (e.g. aurelle et al., 2002). unfortunately, such management practices have not been recorded in a systematic, transparent and tractable manner, so that it is difficult today to disentangle the effects of the factors contributing to the presence/absence of alleles from domestic strains in wild popu- lations. however, results from this study suggest that there is little, if any, use of wild local spawners in the present- day breeding schemes of hatcheries 2–5. the genetic introgression rates from domestic stock confirm that upper adour population is the most impacted by stocking (rate of recent migration from hatcheries estimated in bayesass of 0.05 with 95% ci [0.02–0.08]). by contrast, hatchery 1 was created with wild spawners from gave de marcadau and nearby one or two decades ago to provide fish stock to recreational anglers in the pyrenees national park. based on supportive breeding schemes, broodstock supply and hatchery 1- reared fish releases are restricted to the uppermost areas of the gave de pau drainage presently occu- pied by trout populations of mediterranean origin. the bayesass estimate of recent migration rate of 0.13 from the wild (gave de pau) to the domestic strain is consistent with both the historical and eco- logical context in which the hatchery was created. however, unex- pectedly, no recent migration was detected in the opposite direction seemingly excluding a potential impact of stocking practice from hatchery 1 into upper gave de pau. a more detailed sampling of the gave de pau populations would be needed to accurately qualify and quantify gene flow between the upper part of gave de pau and hatch- ery 1. 5 |  conclusion homing and straying, although mutually exclusive at an individual level, are two behaviours often invoked to explain sea_trout move- ments between marine and freshwater habitats at a population level. biologists and managers interested in salmonids, and specifically brown_trout, are often puzzled by the diversity of migratory behav- iours exhibited by sea_trout at both individual and population levels. taking advantage of a regional favourable context for tracking both sea_trout movements and gene dispersal between adjacent resident trout populations, this study demonstrates that straying is common although variable among sea_trout populations, but that sea_trout effective dispersal is very rare under natural conditions. this find- ing resolves the above- mentioned apparent contradictions between authors, most of them estimating dispersal simply by assessing sea_trout movements.
