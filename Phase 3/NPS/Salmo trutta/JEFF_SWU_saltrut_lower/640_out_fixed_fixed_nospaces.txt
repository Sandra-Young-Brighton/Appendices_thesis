nitrogen; niche; resource; food web introduction aquatic systems are often deﬁned by the ﬁsh species they support. for example, diverse cichlid lineages have deﬁned many tropical ecosystems, particularly the east african rift valley. economically important lineages (e.g., salmonidae, centrarchidae) and large charismatic apex predators characterize many rivers and lakes worldwide. for example, tropical rivers in south america (amazon basin) support diverse ﬁsh communities (jepsen & winemiller 2002) and are characterized by a few highly successful lineages (characidae, cichlidae, loricariidae; albert et al. 2011). although tropical systems are species rich and niche space appears saturated, some species occupy ecological roles that lack redundancy and are thus extremely important to ecosystem function. for the loss of a hyper-abundant detritivore example, (prochilodus mariae) dramatically alters carbon transport and sediment loads (taylor et al. 2006). detritivorous ﬁshes are often abundant and important components of tropical south american food webs. for example, sucker-mouthed catﬁshes (loricariidae) play important functional roles by modifying habitat (power 1990) and consuming resources that are often poorly available to ﬁshes (e.g., wood, macrophytes; lujan 2009). the food web structure of amazonian streams is often characterized by algal-supported ﬁsh biomass, broad carbon range of ﬁsh communities (10–14& d13c) and variable food chain lengths of 2–4 trophic levels (hamilton et al. 1992; lewis et al. 2001; jepsen & winemiller 2002). additionally, the omni- vore and detritivore trophic guilds are typically diverse (jepsen & winemiller 2002). however, sub- tropical south american rivers are poorly studied compared with amazonian systems (winemiller 1989; hamilton et al. 1992; lewis et al. 2001; jepsen & winemiller 2002, 2007). subtropical south american drainages support diverse ﬁsh assemblages and display comparatively high degrees of endemism and cryptic diversity (lucena & kullander 1992; pialek et al. 2011; rican et al. 2011). yet, species boundaries, community composition and ecological correspondence: e. d. burress, department of biological sciences, auburn university, 331 funchess, auburn, al 36849, usa. e-mail: edb0014@auburn.edu 66 doi: 10.1111/eff.12002 roles of many subtropical south american ﬁshes are poorly known, and our understanding of food web structure in these streams is extremely limited (zarucki et al. 2010; serra et al. 2011). we are not aware of any studies of the food web structure of any subtropical south american streams, although there are analyses of subtropical lakes and estuaries (garcia et al. 2006, 2007). the rio de la plata basin, the second largest catchment in south america after the amazon, displays high levels of endemism (35–65%; pialek et al. 2011; albert et al. 2011) and supports diverse ichthyofauna. for exam- ple, the three primary tributaries, rio paraguay, rio uruguay and rio paraná, support 332, 230 and 330 species, respectively (reis et al. 2003; albert et al. 2011). many rio de la plata basin ﬁshes are believed to be derived from amazonian lineages (eigenmann 1906; eigenmann et al. 1907; pearson 1937; reclus 1895; carvalho & albert 2011). this system pro- vides a unique opportunity to investigate food web structure in a poorly known subtropical stream with physical and possibly functional attributes similar to temperate latitude streams, but with ﬁsh assemblages derived from amazonian lineages. we investigated the trophic guild structure of the rio cuareim, uruguay, a major tributary to the rio uruguay basin, using stable isotope ratios. our objec- tives were to (i) describe the food web structure of the ﬁsh community, (ii) compare trophic segregation at community and guild scales (trophic and taxo- nomic) and (iii) estimate the relative importance of basal carbon sources supporting ﬁsh biomass. methods study site the la plata basin is the second largest river in south america and the ﬁfth largest in the world with a 3 9 106 km2 catchment area (brea & zucol 2011). it extends from southern uruguay to middle brazil and comprises tropical and subtropical latitudes (brea & zucol 2011) and supports a diverse gondwanan ﬁsh assemblage (maisley 2000). the rio uruguay drainage is the smallest of three main tributaries to the la plata river, and like most of the la plata basin, it is supported by an extensive groundwater reservoir (favetto et al. 2005; brea & zucol 2011). the rio cuareim drains south-western brazil and north-western uruguay and is a major tributary to the middle rio uruguay. the surrounding physiographic region is arid, subtropical prairie (iriondo 1999; brea & zucol 2011). the rio cuareim is a ﬁfth-order, clear-water piedmont river characterized by cobble substrates and diverse and highly endemic ﬁsh com- munities (lucena & kullander 1992; zarucki et al. subtropical ﬁsh community 2010; serra et al. 2011; e. d. burress, pers. obs.). for more detailed discussion of the study site, see burress (2012). study design we sampled ﬁshes in the upper rio cuareim (s 30° 46, w 056°02) basin using a combination of back- pack electro-ﬁshing, seines, cast nets and hook and line sampling. samples were pooled across three sites along a 15-km reach in the upper basin. fishes were immediately euthanized and frozen. we lyophilized caudal muscle tissue until dry, ground them into a homogenous powder and packed samples into tin capsules (costech analytical technologies). aquatic macrophytes (hydrilla) and detritus (leaves) were manually sampled. terrestrial-derived leaf samples were collected from the substratum and are consid- ered inclusive of associated microbes. sediment and attached ﬁlamentous algae were scrapped from rock surfaces. all basal resources were cleaned of particu- late matter using a microscope. stable isotope ratios were analysed at the colorado plateau stable isotope laboratory (northern arizona university, az, usa). isotope values are written in delta notation, which represent deviation from standards: pee dee belem- nite (pdb) limestone and atmospheric nitrogen for d13c and d15n, respectively. (1), omnivores and detritivores trophic positions, except we used discriminate function analysis (dfa) to determine whether species could be classiﬁed into predeﬁned trophic guilds and taxonomic groups (order, family, species) based on their stable isotope ratios. we determined trophic guilds for ﬁshes from dietary references in the literature (table 1). to esti- mate the relative importance of basal resources, we estimated the number of trophic transfers that sepa- rate each trophic guild from basal resources: herbi- vores (1.5), invertivores (2) and piscivores (2.5). these values were chosen because generally consumers occupy integer for omnivores, which feed at multiple trophic levels (thompson et al. 2007), and thus, they were given an intermedi- ate trophic level. these trophic levels are analogous to other food chains in south american streams (jepsen & winemiller 2002). we then corrected consumer isotope ratios based on fractionation rates of 0.5& (d13c; deniro & epstein 1978) and 2.54& (d15n; vanderklift & ponsard 2003) for each trophic transfer. owing to assumptions involved with these corrections, we did not attempt to quantify the impor- tance of each basal resource and instead used the spa- tial relationships in a cn bi-plot to estimate their relative importance. we deposited voucher specimens in the auburn university natural history museum and learning center (auburn, al, usa). 67 burress et al. table 1. trophic guild assignment for ﬁsh taxa and references used. table 2. stable isotope ratios (mean ± 1 sd) of ﬁshes in the rio cuareim, uruguay.

species of ﬁsh (table 2; fig. 1). community-wide bi-plots of ﬁsh c and n isotope ratios display relatively large isotopic overlap between most ﬁshes (fig. 1a). in contrast, discriminate function analysis revealed that ﬁshes can be classiﬁed into trophic guilds (70.3% classiﬁcation success), but was less successful at clas- sifying taxonomic groups (40–58.6% classiﬁcation success) based on stable isotope ratios (tables 3 and 4). trophic guild membership is signiﬁcantly associ- ated with d15n ratios (r2 = 0.58, f = 164.33, p < 0.0001; fig. 2) although herbivores display higher than predicted d15n ratios relative to other guilds (fig. 2). large d13c discrepancies within tro- phic guilds and high overlap between trophic guilds suggest that carbon sources are not useful in identify- ing ﬁsh trophic guilds (fig. 2). they possess a guild-level approximately 80% of the omnivores were cor- rectly reclassiﬁed using stable isotope ratios. only 20% were classiﬁed into the invertivore and herbi- vore guilds (10% each), demonstrating that, despite the isotopically diverse sources consumed by omni- vores, isotopic identity. piscivores and detritivores displayed the highest reclassiﬁcation success (86% and 100%, respec- tively). unexpectedly, high d15n ratios for the herbi- vore to discriminate herbivores from invertivores (29% of in- vertivores incorrectly

(table 3). most species had similar c/n ratios regardless of trophic guild (table 2); however, and prochilodus gymnogeophagus lineatus display comparatively high c/n ratios and gymnogenys resulted

strongly associated with unique basal resources (fig. 1). the d13c range of each trophic guild varied: pisci- vore (2.5&), insectivore (3.6&), omnivore (4.9&) and herbivore (8.9&) represent 28, 41, 55 and 100% of the community-wide d13c range (8.9&), respec- tively. the detritivore guild is not included because only one species was classiﬁed into the guild. piscivore d15n ratios relative to basal d15n ratios suggest the occurrence of approximately 3 trophic levels (fig. 1). on the basis of our estimated fractionation correc- tions, algae may support most ﬁsh biomass (fig. 3). macrophyte carbon only appears important to a few species (fig. 1a) that may consume them directly (table 2). discussion this study describes the food web structure of a sub- tropical south american piedmont stream and

58.6 40 51.7 guilds within the ﬁsh community and identiﬁed important nutrient sources for ﬁsh consumers. several characteristics, such as food chain length, the relative importance of basal resources, and high occurrence of omnivory were analogous to amazonian rivers. piscivores were isotopically distinct from other guilds despite consisting of two functionally different groups. winemiller (1989) classiﬁed serrasalmus (piranha) as shearers, and hoplias as engulfers based on their feeding modes. in amazonian systems, these two piscivore guilds were not isotopically distin- guishable (jepsen & winemiller 2002); however, our data easily separate them by d13c signatures. this could be due to species-level taxonomic differences or possibly due to tropical–subtropical discrepancies in guild structure. crenicichla are diverse in subtropi- cal south american rivers (pialek et al. 2011) and are often important mesopredators in tropical systems (reznick et al. 1990; johansson et al. 2004). we found that six species are split between two trophic guilds (piscivore and invertivore), and d13c ratios vary greatly among species, indicating they may have species-speciﬁc trophic roles. omnivory may be an adaptive response to ﬂuctua- tions in resource availability or poor resource predict- ability (winemiller 1989; jepsen & winemiller 2002). seasonal ﬂuxes of terrestrial subsidies from ﬂoodplains that occur in amazonian streams (i.e., winemiller & jepsen 1998) are unlikely in arid sub- tropical south america (iriondo 1999) and may be replaced by seasonal temperature shifts that inﬂuence autochthonous resources (e.g., algae, macrophyte bio- mass). almost half the species sampled were classi- ﬁed as omnivores, including primarily taxa that display generalist feeding habits in other systems (esteves 1996; yafe et al. 2002; russo et al. 2004). despite the diverse resources consumed by these taxa, our analyses indicate that the omnivore guild has a distinct isotopic identity. in contrast, omnivores were comparatively less isotopically distinct than 69 burress et al. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3  ‰ n 5 1 δ a s d m 2 –28 –27 –26 –25 –24 –23 –22 –21 –20 –19 –18 –17 –16 –15 δ13c ‰ fig.

because of higher than pre- dicted d15n ratios. this guild also consists of the most d13c depleted and enriched species sampled; the guild spans the entire community d13c thus, range. hypostomus and rineloricaria were associated with macrophyte and algal carbon, respectively. ancistus displayed more negative d13c ratios than any basal resource sampled. previous studies estab- lished ancistrus as herbivorous grazers (power 1984, 1990), but recent studies suggest they often display more negative d13c ratios than other loricariids and that some species may be detritivorous (lujan 2009). thus, the inclusion of ancistrus taunayi in the herbi- vore guild may be tentative. sucker-mouthed catﬁsh- es may in subtropical south american streams by directly exploiting a variety of basal resources. additionally, by exploiting allochthonous resources (e.g., wood, detritus) that are difﬁcult to assimilate relative to particularly important play roles 70 autochthonous resources (thorp & delong 1994), loricariids may be important in nutrient processing. algal carbon supports many amazonian river food webs (hamilton et al. 1991; lewis et al. 2001; jep- sen & winemiller 2007). on the basis of our esti- mated fractionation corrections, algae may support most ﬁsh biomass. however, if the food chain is longer than we estimate, or fractionation rates are higher (i.e., post 2002), the importance of detritus may be equally or more important. macrophyte car- bon only appears important to a few species that may consume them directly. we did not collect water samples, so we are unsure of the role of particulate organic matter (pom). however, two ﬁlter-feeding bivalves have d13c ratios of  31& (burress 2012), suggesting pom is not an important basal resource to ﬁsh biomass. the rio cuareim displays many trophic character- istics analogous to amazonian rivers including food chain length, well-differentiated trophic guilds and algal-supported consumer biomass (hamilton et al. 1991; lewis et al. 2001; jepsen & winemiller 2002, 2007). several subtropical lineages such as gymnoge- ophagus (reis & malabarba 1988) and australoheros (rican et al. 2011) are broadly omnivorous (yafe et al. 2002; this study), and thus, subtropical south american food webs may be characterized by high rates of omnivory similar to tropical river food webs (jepsen & winemiller 2002). crenicichla are often apex predators (layman et al. 2005), and through predation pressure, they alter community structure and evolution (reznick et al. 1990; johansson et al. 2004). our data suggest a diverse group of six spe- cies may partition their diets, and thus, collectively, crenicichla may exert diverse predation pressures in subtropical south american food webs. acknowledgements we are
