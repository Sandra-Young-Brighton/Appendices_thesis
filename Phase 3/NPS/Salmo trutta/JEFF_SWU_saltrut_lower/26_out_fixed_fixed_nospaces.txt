magnuson, crowder, & medvick, 1979). water temperatures are also critical to structuring the distribution of organisms, for example, by limiting salmonids to high elevations in some regions (flebbe, 1994) and limiting the latitudinal distribution of smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu) (shuter, maclean, fry, & regier, 1980). however, climate change is expected to increase lotic temperatures over the coming century and many lotic systems in the united states are already warming (kaushal et al., 2010). this change in thermal habitat could alter current distributions of organisms by opening new habitats to colonisation (e.g., smallmouth bass range ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:19–29. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff  |  19 © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd20  |     expanding farther north; vander zanden, olden, thorne, & mandrak, 2004) and restricting the range of species adapted to cooler water (e.g., bull trout (salvelinus_confluentus); isaak et al., 2010). in addition to thermal patterns, hydrologic regime is also a criti- cal structuring component of stream ecosystems (poff et al., 2010). accordingly, many regions across the united states have had streams classified by flow regimes, such as groundwater and runoff (e.g., leasure, magoulick, & longing, 2016). these classification regimes provide clear, easily interpreted and ecologically relevant methods of relating stream hydrologic regime to ecological data (poff et al., 2010). groundwater- dominated streams are expected to exhibit very differ- ent thermal patterns than runoff- dominated streams, with cooler water temperatures during summer months, and warmer temperatures during winter months (whitledge, rabeni, annis, & sowa, 2006). in addition, streams with more groundwater input are likely to be less sensitive to changes in warming air temperatures which could affect how fishes re- spond to climate change (carlson, taylor, schlee, zorn, & infante, 2015). smallmouth bass is a warm- water riverine species broadly dis- tributed throughout north america. because of their ecological im- portance as apex predators in many lotic systems (rabeni, 1992), smallmouth bass is a commonly studied species with many of their life history traits characterised (brewer & orth, 2015) including bio- energetics parameters (whitledge, hayward, zweifel, & rabeni, 2003). although smallmouth bass are locally abundant in streams in the ozark–ouachita interior highlands, this region is at the southern extent of smallmouth bass native range and seasonal water tempera- tures exceed optimal growth levels (22°c; zweifel, hayward, & rabeni, 1999) in many systems during a typical year. air temperatures are ex- pected to increase in the ozark–ouachita interior highlands due to climate change over the coming century (alder & hostetler, 2013), po- tentially raising some stream temperatures past habitable conditions for smallmouth bass. although previous work has examined a potential northward ex- pansion of smallmouth bass range due to climate change (dunlop & shuter, 2006; vander zanden et al., 2004), little work has examined how smallmouth bass could be affected by climate change at the southern portion of their range. some fishes are expected to have truncated ranges due to climate change (e.g., brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis); meisner, 1990), but some previous work has not indicated this for smallmouth bass (mohseni, stefan, & eaton, 2003). in a com- parison of smallmouth bass growth rate in four streams across a latitu- dinal gradient, pease and paukert (2014) indicated a potential increase in smallmouth bass prey consumption and growth due to climate change across their range. however, they did not take into account variation among stream types or factors other than temperature which could affect growth. other research indicates that high water temperatures at the southern extent of smallmouth bass range can be detrimental to their growth and abundance. in the ozark border region of missouri, small- mouth bass have shown declines with replacement by their competi- tor, largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides) (sowa & rabeni, 1995). in particular, streams with higher maximum summer temperatures and more pool area had a stronger displacement (sowa & rabeni, 1995). middaugh et al. this is likely due in part to higher thermal optima of largemouth bass leading to a competitive advantage in warmer streams (26°c; zweifel et al., 1999). however, certain aspects of the flow regime, for exam- ple, the amount of groundwater influence, could influence competitive interactions and benefit smallmouth bass populations. streams with large amounts of groundwater input could provide thermal habitat that favours growth of smallmouth bass (westhoff & paukert, 2014). in addition, streams with high levels of groundwater input could increase recruitment of smallmouth bass relative to non- spring- fed streams (brewer, 2013). no previous work has compared smallmouth bass growth in groundwater- dominated versus runoff- dominated streams. we examined how climate change could alter stream water tem- peratures in the ozark–ouachita interior highlands and how this could affect the growth rate potential (grp) of smallmouth bass. flow regimes have recently been predicted for every stream in the ozark–ouachita interior highlands region of arkansas, oklahoma and missouri (leasure et al., 2016). these flow regime classifications were developed from ten hydrologic variables and provide a classification of streams into three broad categories: groundwater, runoff and in- termittent with subcategories within each (leasure et al., 2016). all of our study streams were classified as either groundwater or runoff. groundwater streams are characterised by more flow stability and higher base flows than runoff streams (leasure et al., 2016). many runoff streams have multiple days of no flow each year in this region (leasure et al., 2016). we did not include any intermittent streams as many of these do not support year- round smallmouth bass popula- tions (magoulick, 2000). the flow classifications that we use are not based on the actual groundwater contribution to the system, but in- stead are based on a wide range of hydrologic variables (leasure et al., 2016). we compared changes in seasonal grp among streams from both flow classifications to determine how smallmouth bass growth could be affected differentially between flow regimes. 2 |  materials and methods 2.1 | air and water temperatures we selected fourteen streams in the ozark–ouachita interior highlands of arkansas, missouri and oklahoma that contained small- mouth bass and had united states geological survey (usgs) river gages that collected water temperature data (figure 1; appendix 1). all temperature data for each site were downloaded (range 1–11 years; appendix 1), and a monthly mean temperature for each month of data was calculated at each site. if a month had fewer than 20 days of temperature data collected, it was excluded from analyses. next, we collected monthly mean air temperatures (from the national oceanic and atmospheric agency national center for climate data) for the county where each site was located for a corresponding time period to the water temperature data. we then calculated a least- squares linear regression for each site to predict stream temperature from air temperature data (table 1). after calculating a predictive relationship between air and water temperatures, we used the usgs national climate change viewer middaugh et al.     |  21 figure 1 location of sites across the ozark–ouachita interior highlands of arkansas, oklahoma and missouri (shaded in grey). each site corresponds to a usgs river gage which collects stream temperature data. sites from runoff streams are designated with a triangle, and sites from groundwater streams are designated with a circle table 1 linear regression results  relating air and water temperatures from each site. air temperature data were collected from the noaa national climate and data center, and water temperatures were collected from usgs water temperature gages. all regression models were significant at p < 0.001 river intercept coefficient bear creek beaty creek east fork black river huzzah creek jacks fork osage creek spavinaw creek sylamore creek big creek big river buffalo river illinois bayou south fork little red tavern creek 10.04 6.23 2.66 5.56 4.16 10.00 8.66 4.03 3.22 1.80 4.67 1.85 2.34 2.41 .37 .65 .84 .97 .88 .49 .49 .76 .82 .96 .77 .92 .88 .95 r2 .79 .92 .96 .98 .97 .79 .88 .97 .98 .99 .96 .96 .97 .99 stream type groundwater groundwater groundwater groundwater groundwater groundwater groundwater groundwater runoff runoff runoff runoff runoff runoff 22  |     middaugh et al. (alder & hostetler, 2013) to determine modelled historical air tem- peratures (1950–2005) and future air temperatures under climate change for two decades (2040s and 2090s). the national climate change viewer provides monthly minimum and maximum tem- peratures downscaled to the county level for each year during the historical period, and projected monthly minimum and maximum tem- peratures for each year at the same resolution until the year 2099. we selected an emissions scenario of rcp 8.5 (highest co2 emissions) and used the ensemble average temperature predictions of 30 mod- els. we chose to only model the highest climate scenario because of the exploratory nature of this analysis and because we focus on a comparison of two different future time periods which provides a contrast between a more and less severe change in air temperature. we calculated the mean minimum and maximum temperature of each month for the county corresponding to each of our streams during present and both future time periods. monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were averaged to produce a monthly mean temperature for each time period. these monthly mean temperatures were then used to predict monthly mean water temperatures for each site at each time period using the previously calculated linear rela- tionships. this approach assumes no changes in river conditions (e.g., hydrologic patterns) over the coming century other than temperature changes. 2.2 | bioenergetics modelling we created a bioenergetics simulation based on the wisconsin bio- energetics model (hansen, johnson, kitchell, & schindler, 1997) but coded in program r (r development core team 2008) and param- eterised for smallmouth bass (shuter & post, 1990; whitledge et al., 2003, 2006; wrenn, 1980; zweifel et al., 1999). all simulations were run for a 300- g fish (275 mm (kolander, willis, & murphy, 1993); ap- proximately age 4 in the buffalo river, ar (whisenant & maughan, 1989)). we determined simulated diet based on diet samples collected using gastric lavage (kamler & pope, 2001) from smallmouth bass cap- tured in the buffalo river, ar, in may–september 2014 (n = 34; 73% crayfish, 24% fish and 3% macroinvertebrate). these proportions are similar to what other researchers have found for smallmouth bass diets (dauwalter & fisher, 2008; rabeni, 1992). energy density of prey was set at 3,063 j/g for crayfish (procambarus crayfish; eggleton & schramm, 2002), 3,853 j/g for fish prey (fathead minnow (pimephales promelas); whitledge et al., 2003) and 3,421 j/g for aquatic insect lar- vae (average value of chironomidae, odonata and ephemeroptera; cummins & wuycheck, 1971). the bioenergetics model was used to calculate grp for small- mouth bass at each month for each time period. calculating grp al- lows assessment of the effects of water temperature on smallmouth bear creek beaty creek east fork black river huzzah creek 10 15 20 jacks fork 5 2 5 1 5 0 25 30 –5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 –5 0 5 –5 0 5 5 2 5 1 5 0 25 30 –5 0 10 15 5 20 osage creek 5 10 20 spavinaw creek 15 5 2 5 1 5 0 20 25 30 –5 0 15 10 20 5 buffalo river 5 2 5 1 5 0 25 30 –5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 25 30 –5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 10 5 20 sylamore creek 15 10 15 20 5 illinois bayou 25 30 25 30 15 10 5 20 tavern creek 25 30 –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 5 10 15 20 25 30 r e t a w d n u o r g ) c o ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w f f o n u r 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 10 15 big creek 20 25 30 –5 0 5 10 15 big river –5 0 10 15 5 20 kiamichi river 5 2 5 1 5 0 25 30 –5 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 10 0 25 south fork little red 20 15 5 2 5 1 5 0 30 –5 0 5 2 5 1 5 0 –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 –5 0 5 10 15 25 30 20 0 air temperature ( oc) –5 figure 2 linear regression models for each site relating mean monthly air temperature (from noaa national climate data center) and mean monthly water temperature (from usgs river gage specific to each site). model results for each site are shown in table 1 middaugh et al. bass growth with all other factors being held constant (e.g., coulter, sepúlveda, troy, & höök, 2014). we conducted ten grp models for each month, altering the proportion of maximum consumption (p value) from 0.1 to 1.0 at 0.1 increments and outputting growth in grams of growth per gram of fish per day (g g−1 day−1). this range of consumption values is much wider than a fish likely experiences naturally, but we chose to model this wide range to examine ef- fects of climate change even at unrealistically high consumption levels. this approach models all potential scenarios, from very low prey availability to assuming that prey availability will increase to compensate for increasing smallmouth bass consumption. this was repeated for each stream and for each time period (present, mid- century and end of century). next, mean growth rate potential for each month in each stream was calculated and a seasonal change in grp from present to mid- century or end of century for each stream calculated (winter: january–march; spring: april–june; summer: july–september; fall: october–december). changes in growth rate potential were compared between stream types using paired t- tests for each season at both time periods. all data analyses were conducted in program r.     |  23 3 |  results air and water temperatures were significantly linearly related at all sites with all r2 values >0.78 (table 1; figure 2). groundwater streams typically showed less variation in temperature over the course of the year than runoff streams (figure 3). climate simulations indicated that across our sites, future yearly mean air temperatures will increase by an average of 2.5°c by mid- century and increase by an average of 5.8°c by the end of century. future predicted water temperatures corresponded with predicted future air temperatures (figure 3). growth rate potential models indicated a general increase in grp for smallmouth bass during most winter, early spring and fall months and a general decrease in grp during late- spring and sum- mer months relative to present water temperatures (figure 4). runoff streams typically showed an increase in grp during winter, spring and fall months (e.g., 0.001 g g−1 day−1 increase in march grp by mid- century; 0.003 g g−1 day−1 increase in march grp by the end of century), but a decrease in grp during summer months (e.g., 0.001 g g−1 day−1 decrease in august grp by mid- century, 0.006 g g−1 day−1 decrease in august grp by the end of century). bear creek beaty creek east fork black river huzzah creek r e t a w d n u o r g ) c o ( e r u t a r e p m e t r e t a w f f o n u r 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 4 6 8 jacks fork 10 12 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 68 4 osage creek 1 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 12 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 4 6 8 big creek 10 12 2 4 68 1 big river 0 12 2 6 4 spavinaw creek 8 10 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 12 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 6 4 sylamore creek 8 6 4 illinois bayou 8 6 4 buffalo river 8 10 12 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 10 12 10 12 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 4 10 south fork little red 6 8 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 12 2 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 68 4 tavern creek 1 0 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 time period present mid−century end of century 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 68 1 0 12 month figure 3 predicted historical (1950–2005;

0.001 g g−1 day−1 and 0.003 g g−1 day−1 decrease in august grp for mid- and end of cen- tury respectively). in general, runoff streams demonstrated more extreme changes  in temperature leading to larger changes in seasonal growth rate potential (figures 2 and 5). runoff streams had significantly more positive changes in growth rate potential than groundwa- ter streams in both mid- century and end- of- century simulations during fall months (mid- century t = −3.54, p = .007; end of century t = −3.18, p = .014; figure 6). groundwater streams had a more positive change in grp than runoff streams in end- of- century sim- ulations during spring months (t = 2.80, p = .016; figure 6). during late spring months, runoff streams were experiencing a decline in grp leading to a lower change in grp from present conditions than seen in groundwater streams (figure 5). runoff streams had a significantly more negative change in growth rate potential than groundwater streams in end- of- century simulations during summer months (t = 2.99, p = .012; figure 6). 4 |  discussion our models predict that an increase in stream warming across the ozark–ouachita interior highlands due to climate change will lead to an increase in grp for smallmouth bass during winter, early spring and fall months. however, late- spring and summer months warmed past opti- mal temperature for smallmouth bass growth, resulting in a reduction in grp for smallmouth bass in most of the modelled streams. although the population- level effects of reduced summer growth on smallmouth bass are unknown, it is possible that reduced grp during these very warm months could lead to largemouth bass and spotted bass (micropterus punctulatus) having a competitive advantage over smallmouth bass due to higher thermal optima (zweifel et al., 1999), potentially leading to local declines or extirpation (sowa & rabeni, 1995). smallmouth bass grp was altered significantly differently between groundwater and runoff streams in multiple seasons. previous work has indicated that spring- fed streams could have higher smallmouth bass growth relative to warmer, non- spring- fed streams (whitledge et al., 2006). in addition, empirical work found that spring- fed streams middaugh et al.     |  25 bear creek beaty creek east fork black river huzzah creek 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 0 – . 4 6 8 jacks fork 10 12 2 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 6 4 osage creek 8 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 0 – . 10 12 2 5 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 . 0 – 6 4 10 spavinaw creek 8 5 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 . 0 – 12 2 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 0 – . 6 4 sylamore creek 8 10 12 4 6 8 big creek 10 12 2 4 6 8 big river 10 12 2 6 4 buffalo river 8 r e t a w d n u o r g ) 1 – y a d × 1 – g × g ( l a i t t n e o p e  t t a r h w o r g n  i e g n a h c  f f o n u r 5 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 – . 5 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 . 0 – 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 2 2 2 6 4 10 south fork little red 8 5 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 . 0 – 12 2 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 6 4 illinois bayou 8 10 12 10 12 2 5 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 0 – 6 4 tavern creek 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 time period mid-century end of century 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 month figure 5 change in growth rate potential from present for each stream at both time periods. the solid horizontal line indicates no change from present. the top two rows are groundwater streams, and the bottom two rows are runoff streams have higher abundances of juvenile smallmouth bass, that is, better reproduction (brewer, 2013) and lotic smallmouth bass abundance in missouri are positively associated with higher spring- flow volumes (brewer, rabeni, sowa, & annis, 2007). groundwater input may also provide thermal resistance to streams in michigan, promoting the con- servation of salmonids susceptible to the effects of climate change (carlson et al., 2015). our models predict that smallmouth bass in groundwater streams will not decline in growth rate potential during summer months to the extent of runoff streams, indicating the impor- tance of these habitats for smallmouth bass populations during future temperature regimes. smallmouth bass have an upper mean weekly temperature thresh- old of 27°c for sustained positive growth and viable populations (whitledge et al., 2006). above this temperature, one would expect re- duced annual growth, condition and fecundity (bagenal, 1967). under present climate conditions, no streams that we modelled have a mean monthly temperature >27°c at any point. by mid- century, this thresh- old is expected to be surpassed by one groundwater stream (jack’s fork) for at least one month of the year, and in six runoff streams for at least one month of the year. by the end of century, this increases to four groundwater streams, and all seven runoff streams exceed this threshold for at least one month out of the year. similarly, bouska, whitledge, and lant (2015) identified a threshold upper mean annual maximum air temperature of 31°c where smallmouth bass occurrence was not associated with streams across the central united states that experienced air temperatures exceeding this level. by the end of cen- tury, air temperatures associated with all of our modelled streams are predicted to exceed this level, but water temperatures are not likely to reach lethal limits for smallmouth bass (37°c; wrenn, 1980). it is possible that adult smallmouth bass could behaviourally adapt to changing water temperatures. adult smallmouth bass can migrate to regulate body temperature during winter months in ozark streams with groundwater inputs (peterson & rabeni, 1996; westhoff, paukert, ettinger- dietzel, dodd, & siepker, 2016). therefore, it is plausible that smallmouth bass could regulate body temperature during sum- mer months by utilising spatial variations in thermal habitat, similar to salmonids (e.g., rainbow trout; ebersole, liss, & frissell, 2001). many streams in this region are thermally heterogeneous with cooler water patches due to stream stratification (matthews, 1998) and ground- water inputs (westhoff & paukert, 2014). groundwater inputs into 26  |     middaugh et al. mid-century end of century ) 1 – y a d x 1 – g x g ( l a i t t n e o p e a r h w o r g n t t i e g n a h c 4 0 0 0 . 2 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 . 2 0 0 0 – . 4 0 0 0 – . 6 0 0 0 – . * flow classification groundwater runoff winter spring summer fall 4 0 0 0 . 2 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 . 2 0 0 0 – . 4 0 0 0 – . 6 0 0 0 – . season * * * figure 6 mean seasonal change in growth rate potential from present for both flow classifications at both time periods. asterisks indicate a significant difference (p < .05) in the mean value of the change in growth rate potential between groundwater and runoff streams based on a paired t- test. error bars show standard error winter spring summer fall streams can range from large springs (e.g., alley spring on the jack’s fork river; discharge = 2.7 m3/s; mugel, richards, & schumacher, 2009) with long downstream influence (westhoff & paukert, 2014), to small seepages associated with channel curvature with localised influence (dugdale, bergeron, & st- hilaire, 2015). smallmouth bass could migrate (westhoff et al., 2016) or use other behavioural adap- tations to utilise these temperature refuges. however, these refuges may be lacking in many runoff- dominated streams and typical summer drought conditions lead to isolated pools in many runoff streams in this region (homan, girondo, & gagen, 2005; magoulick, 2000). this drying would prevent migrations of smallmouth bass in many runoff streams during summer months (hafs, gagen, & whalen, 2010). more data are needed on groundwater inputs into many of these systems to better understand available thermal refuges. the streams that we modelled encompass the range of several subspecies of smallmouth bass (interior highland intergrade and neosho smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu velox); brewer & orth, 2015). we do not attempt to account for differences in bioenergetics parameters for these sub- species as no data exist; however, many of the parameters that we use were developed in the ozarks of missouri (whitledge et al., 2003). different subspecies could have different thermal tolerances affecting how fish adapt and respond to climate change. there are several limitations to our study. for example, our water temperature predictions are relatively simplistic. linear air and water temperature relationships are commonly used to examine the pre- dicted effects of climate change on future stream water temperatures (e.g., almodóvar, nicola, ayllón, & elvira, 2012; carlson et al., 2015; pease & paukert, 2014; peterson & kwak, 1999). predictive relation- ships between air and water temperatures generally improve at longer timescales (morrill, bales, & conklin, 2005) and at the monthly scale are often strongly related (erickson & stefan, 2000). however, these rela- tionships are not as strong at temperature extremes and correlations tend to plateau at high temperatures (erickson & stefan, 2000). we did not observe any levelling of stream temperatures at high air tempera- tures (figure 2), and our regressions were all significant and well fit. although there may be a risk of over- predicting stream temperatures at the very warmest air temperatures, we believe our water tempera- ture predictions were adequate for our modelling efforts because of our coarse timescale and our strong regressions that we created spe- cifically for each stream. further, none of our streams were headwater streams (all either third or fourth order) which reduces variability asso- ciated with small streams. linear relationships between air and water temperatures can strongly predict both groundwater- dominated and runoff- dominated streams, although groundwater streams typically have lower regression slopes (erickson & stefan, 2000). similar to our results, whitledge et al. (2006) found strong predictive relationships between air and water temperature in both spring- fed and non- spring- fed streams in the ozark highlands of missouri. another limitation to our study is that our temperature data are based solely on a single gage location for a river. in some cases, this gage could be located very close to a spring and could be heavily influ- enced by groundwater (westhoff & paukert, 2014). all of our streams have groundwater input to some extent, and the location of these inputs could have affected our temperature predictions. however, as we include at least six streams from each stream type, we assume that not all are affected in such a way. it is also possible that there may be thermal refuges present in both stream types that our mod- els do not simulate. we model average stream temperatures and do not attempt to simulate the heterogeneous thermal environment that these streams likely contain. another limitation is the limited amount middaugh et al. of water temperature data that we have for each site. for example, temperature predictions from tavern creek are based on only one year of water temperature data. however, all air and water temperature lin- ear regressions were highly significant and a good fit, so we chose to include all sites to bolster our sample size. previous work has indicated some ways to mitigate the effects of increasing temperatures due to climate change. stressors for small- mouth bass include destruction of riparian habitat leading to decreased shade and increased water temperatures (whitledge et al., 2006), gravel mining (brown, lyttle, & brown, 1998) and other anthropogenic land- use alterations (allan, 2004). increasing riparian shading through restoration efforts can decrease the daily temperature fluctuations in streams; however, this is most pronounced in low- order (narrow- width) streams (whitledge et al., 2006). mitigation efforts can also focus on minimising habitat degradation leading to the formation of pools and siltation of substrates (waters, 1995). siltation and increased pool area can cause a reduction in preferred smallmouth bass prey and poten- tially increase risk of being outcompeted by largemouth bass (sowa & rabeni, 1995). protecting thermal habitat is of even higher importance as several species of native ozark crayfish have similar optimal growth temperatures to smallmouth bass (22°c; whitledge & rabeni, 2002). in general, groundwater streams are predicted to experience a much smaller reduction in grp during summer months and could provide a thermal refuge for smallmouth bass and other species not adapted to warm temperatures. however, seasonal drying and drought condi- tions could prevent access to these refuges (magoulick & kobza, 2003). regulating flow levels and water withdrawal to preserve a minimum flow when possible could also facilitate access of smallmouth bass to potential thermal habitat from groundwater inputs. excessive water withdrawals could lead to higher summer temperatures in groundwater streams, diminishing their refuge qualities for smallmouth bass. in conclusion, we found that smallmouth bass will likely experience an increase in growth rate potential during cool months, but a decrease in growth rate potential during late- spring and summer months over the course of the 21st century. we found that flow regime was a useful pre- dictor of which streams may have the strongest temperature change, and in particular, we suggest that monitoring and conservation efforts should be focused on runoff flow regimes as smallmouth bass in these streams will be subject to a greater change in temperature over the com- ing century. more work is needed to explore how these growth changes could affect smallmouth bass at the population level, but it is possible that elevated summer temperatures will leave them more at risk of being outcompeted by other micropterus species, especially in runoff streams. acknowledgements we thank the national science foundation for supporting b.k. through a research experience for undergraduates fellowship. we also thank c. paukert, j. westhoff and r. fournier for providing com- ments that improved this manuscript. two anonymous reviewers also provided helpful suggestions. any use of trade, firm or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the u.s. government.     |  27 references alder, j. r., & hostetler, s. w.
