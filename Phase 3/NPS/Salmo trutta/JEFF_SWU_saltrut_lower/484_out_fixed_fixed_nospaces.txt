(1995) suggested a model which assumes condition-dependent ornaments in females. the model further suggests that males which choose elaborated ornamented females receive fewer or poorer eggs than they could have obtained from a female of similar quality which allocates less resource to ornaments and more to gamete quality. them ‘red’ numerous species, including ﬁshes, have caroten- oid-based ornaments that vary from yellow to red (goodwin 1984; andersson 1994; møller et al. 2000). for simplicity, we call in this study. carotenoid-based ornaments are often considered as honest, condition-dependent indicators of male quality (andersson 1994; johnstone 1997; olson & owens 1998). carotenoids are lipid-soluble hydrocarbons that are synthesised by plants, algae, some bacteria and some fungi, whereas animals must obtain them through their diet (goodwin 1984). carotenoids are generally considered as rare and valuable because of their beneﬁcial role in a variety of physiological processes, immunostimulants and antioxidants (reviewed by olson & owens 1998). antioxidants remove harmful radicals produced as by- products of normal cellular activity, and from envi- ronmental (reviewed by chew 1996). embryos are rapidly growing organisms with a high rate of metabolism that can produce more radicals and have more oxidative stress than slower growing organisms (blount et al. 2002). developing embryos, at least in birds, rely heavily on oxidation of fatty acids from the lipid-rich yolk supplied by the mother (blount et al. 2002). carotenoids are transferred from the mother to the eggs, and high amounts of carote- noids in the eggs has been suggested to improve offspring quality in general (blount et al. 2000). including as powerful stressors empirical studies have revealed positive effects of carotenoids in antioxidant defence (alonso-alvarez et al. 2004), ﬂight performance (blount & matheson 2006), number of eggs laid (bortolotti et al. 2003), and embryonic and nestling survival and sex ratio of ﬂedged chicks (mcgraw et al. 2005) in birds, and larval size, development speed, survival rates and carotenoids in ornaments or eggs? metamorphic competence of sea urchins (george et al. 2001). in ﬁshes, positive effects of carotenoids have been found on fertilisation rate and mortality (ahmadi et al. 2006), growth (torrissen 1984; boonyaratpalin & unprasert 1989; christiansen et al. 1995), resis- tance to pathogen challenge (christiansen et al. 1995), fertilisation and hatching success rate (salze et al. 2005) and egg quality (watanabe & miki 1993; verakunpiriya et al. 1997). however, the view that carotenoid display is positively associated with anti- oxidant effects of carotenoids was challenged by hartley & kennedy (2004). moreover, the generality of a causal link between egg carotenoids and offspring quality has been questioned by the reported lack of positive effects of dietary carotenoids on fertilisation rate and larval performance (christiansen & torrissen 1997) and different health parameters (lygren et al. 1999) in ﬁshes. moreover, no association was revealed between abdomen colouration (and egg carotenoid content) and measurements of clutch quality (svens- son et al. 2006). we must, though, keep in mind the general publication bias towards studies reporting small and nonsigniﬁcant effect sizes (møller & jennions 2001). it remains unclear whether carotenoid display in females in advertises the reproductive potential general (blount 2004). a few published studies examining this question give ambiguous results. male sockeye salmon, oncorhynchus_nerka (walbaum), prefer carotenoid-ornamented females (craig & foote 2001; foote et al. 2004) as do male two-spotted gobies, gobiusculus ﬂavescens (fabricius) (amundsen & forsgren 2001, 2003), whereas the opposite pref- erence was reported for male three-spined stickle- backs, gasterosteus aculeatus, l. (nordeide 2002). nordeide et al. (2006) suggested that these apparent contradicting results might not be as contradictory as they appear at ﬁrst glance. sockeye salmon is anadromous and inhabit ‘…productive marine envi- ronments in which carotenoids are readily available in their krill-dominated diet’, according to foote et al. (2004). moreover, a direct positive association is found between the amount of carotenoids in the eggs and the elaboration of the carotenoid-based ornament of female two-spotted gobies, as the ornament is mainly caused by the pigmented eggs being visible through the skin (amundsen & forsgren 2001; svensson et al. 2005). in such environments where carotenoids seems not to be a limiting resource or where there is a direct positive association between the elaboration of the carotenoid-based ornament and the carotenoid content of the eggs, males preferring red- ornamented females would not be at risk of fathering eggs with low levels of carotenoids (and hence antioxidants). the situation has been suggested to be different in stickleback populations where females are 329 nordeide et al. ornamented with carotenoids at the basis of their pelvic spines and where carotenoids are most likely rare and valuable (nordeide et al. 2006). the amount of carotenoids in the females’ ornament is traded off with the amount of carotenoids in the females’ gonads in this study, and the carotenoids-based ornaments seem not to be condition-dependent (nordeide et al. 2006). in such ﬁsh populations, males choosing red- coloured females will fertilise eggs with small amounts of carotenoids and appear not to gain any beneﬁt from their mates’ phenotypic quality that could result in offspring of improved quality. in order to understand the evolution of female ornamentation in species with ornaments made up by chemical colourants like carotenoids which are also used to improve egg quality (mcgraw 2005), it has recently been hypothesised that it might be useful to categorise the species into two groups based on the nature of the ornamentation (nordeide et al. 2006). on one hand, in some species the ornament is basically the same in both the sexes and a trade-off exists between the female ornament and her eggs. on the contrary, in some species, only females have the ornament in question and no such trade-off exists (nordeide et al. 2006). nordeide et al. (2006) argued that the evolution of female ornamentation is likely to be explained by the ‘genetic correlation hypothesis’ in the ﬁrst category and by the ‘direct selection hypoth- esis’ in the latter category of species. in arctic charr, salvelinus_alpinus (l.), both sexes have the same carotenoid-based ornaments although males are more showy decorated than females (skar- stein & folstad 1996), which suggests that this species belongs to the ﬁrst category of species. the charr belong to the family salmonidae and inhabit a number of landlocked oligotrophic freshwater lakes in the northern hemisphere. charr is polygamous (fabricius 1953) and male charr aggregate annually at the same leks during the spawning season where they compete while waiting for mature females to arrive, and few or no males seem to migrate between distantly situated leks (figenschou et al. 2004; adams et al. 2006). both sexes receive nothing but gametes during spawning and neither sex shows parental care, indicating that mate choice is based solely on genetic beneﬁts according to the ‘intrinsic male quality hypothesis’ (sivinski 1984) or the ‘genetic compatibility hypothesis’ (zeh & zeh 1996, 1997) and not on maternal beneﬁts. moreover, charr is commonly infected by parasites which have carotenoid-rich species as intermediate hosts (skarstein & folstad 1996). the abdomen of both the sexes is red because of carotenoids in the skin of the ﬁsh, like in the sticklebacks, and not because of pigmented eggs being visible through the skin as in the two-spotted goby. the study aims to quantify the amount of carote- noids in the eggs as well as the intensity of red 330 ornamental colouration at the abdomen and ﬁns, from a population of female arctic charr with most likely poor access to carotenoids. we explore whether there is any correlative evidence that (i) females trade-off carotenoids between ornaments and eggs and (ii) their ornaments signal quality. such studies are few in general and nearly nonexisting in ﬁshes. materials and methods failed. this is interpreted as the arctic charr were caught from a landlocked population in lake soløyvatnet, an oligotrophic lake with most likely poor access to carotenoids, situated at 67°17¢n, 14°25¢e in bodø, northern norway. the 37 females in this study were ripe when they were caught by nets within approximately 100 m · 100 m at one spawning ground on 3 october 2005. twelve days earlier, our effort to catch ripe charr at the spawning grounds spawning commenced less than 12 days prior to our sampling, which is in agreement with information given by local ﬁshermen ﬁshing with nets at the spawning grounds of this lake (gunvald jara˚ker, personal communication). the nets were set at about 5 p.m. and retrieved by 10 p.m. the females were stored in tanks with frequently replaced lake water until further handling within the next 3 h, and we noted the time at the start of handling of each individual. handling of each female started with killing the ﬁsh with a blow to its head before the ﬁsh was placed at a standard position in a stand and their ventral part was photographed, together with a reddish cardboard for calibration purposes, by a digital nikon coolpix 5200 camera nikon, tokyo, japan with a built-in ﬂash. a blood sample was then collected from 31 of the 37 females and a smear was preserved with methanol in the ﬁeld. we were unable to collect blood and prepare smear from six of the females, which had been dead for some time before the start of the handling. the ﬁsh were then frozen in darkness at )40 °c. in the laboratory, we measured each ﬁsh for total length to the nearest millimetre, body mass and gonad mass to the nearest milligram, sex was determined by inspecting the gonads, and age was determined from the otoliths. we used a scissor to remove the ﬁve ventral ﬁns (a pair of pelvic ﬁns, a pair of pectoral ﬁns, and the anal ﬁn at their base, for later chemical analysis of their carotenoid content. the weight–length relationship of the females was estimated, including all 37 females, by linear regres- sion from the equation: ln w ¼ ln a þ b ln l where w = total body mass (g) ) gonad mass (g), and l is the total length (cm) as recommended by le cren (1951) and froese (2006). estimated values of the constants a and b are 0.016 and 2.854, respectively. the relative condition factor (krel) is krel¼ w 0:016l2:854 : it was used when comparing weight–length rela- tionship between individual specimens (le cren 1951; froese 2006). the females were visually inspected for external parasites at the body surface and at the gills. the eyes and the body cavity including the gastrointestinal system (stomach, intestine and pylorus), swimbladder, liver and kidney were carefully dissected and inspected by stereo microscope. internal and external parasite fauna were classiﬁed and quantiﬁed to the genus or species level (appendix s1). a ‘parasite index’ of the total parasite infection of each host was calculated according to skarstein et al. (2005). the score ‘0’ was given to a host with no parasites of a particular parasite group. for each host with parasites of a particular parasite group, scores were assigned from 1 to 4 based on the quartiles of each parasite group calculated from all hosts. the parasite index was the scores for each parasite group summed up for each host. the blood smear was stained by the may-grun- wald–giemsa staining method and two areas (two photos) of the stained blood smear of each ﬁsh were photographed at 100 · (axioskop 2 mot plus, zeiss axiocam hrc : carl zeisswerk, go¨ttingen, ger- many). erythrocytes and leucocytes (lymphocytes and granulocytes) in each photo were identiﬁed according to amin et al. (1991) and counted from printouts of (±sd) of erythrocytes and leucocytes counted in each photo was 601 (±155.8) and 15 (±8.1), respectively, and the repeatability (r = 0.38, estimated according to les- sells & boag 1987) indicated a general agreement between the two counts (two photos) of each ﬁsh. the relative density of leucocytes (l) was calculated as the photos. mean number l ¼ leucocytes  100 leucocytes þ erythrocytes based on the average values of the two counts. intensity of the red colour of the charr’s abdomen (ir-abdomen), pectoral ﬁns (ir-ﬁns) and a red card- board were quantiﬁed from the digital photos as three separate measurements and analysed separately in rgb mode by adobe photoshop version 7.0. this method has previously been applied to quantify colour by several authors (e.g., skarstein & folstad 1996; villafuerte & negro 1998; nordeide 2002; skarstein et al. 2005; nordeide et al. 2006). in each of the three quantiﬁcations, we ﬁrst encircled the area in question. the area of the ir-abdomen was encircled by drawing carotenoids in ornaments or eggs? a line enclosing a hexagon deﬁned by six points at the ventral body of the ﬁsh. the ﬁrst point was the point where the two gill opercula meet. the ﬁve other points were at the base of the pairs of pelvic and pectoral ﬁns, and at the anterior part of the anus. no part of any ﬁns was included in this quantiﬁcation of the ir-abdomen, which means that the area covered by the pectoral ﬁns was excluded from the hexagon. the area of the ir-ﬁns was encircled by drawing a line at the edge around each of the two pectoral ﬁns. the red cardboard was then encircled. secondly, for each of the three areas ir-abdomen, ir-ﬁns and red card board separately, we estimated the average density values for all three primary colours r, g, b (red, green, and blue) from the pixels enclosed in each of the areas (villafuerte & negro 1998). thirdly, ir-abdomen, ir-ﬁns and ir of the red cardboard were calculated as ir ¼ r r þ g þ b : fourthly, we reduced potential noise in the ir-values (ir-abdomen and ir-ﬁns) because of reasons other than the differences in the colour of the abdomen and the ﬁns themselves (for example, noise from between- photos-differences in the ﬂash-light). this was carried out by calculating the mean ir-values of the card- board from all ﬁsh (from the photos as described above), and calculating the deviation of the ir-value of the cardboard of each ﬁsh from the mean of all ﬁsh. the ﬁnal ir-value of the abdomen and ﬁns (ir- abdomen and ir-ﬁns) of each particular female were then down- or up-graded according to this deviation. this method to quantify red colouration yielded a small value of the intensity of red for a drab ﬁsh, whereas the size of the ﬁsh itself will not affect the measurement. we measured each ir-values twice from the same photo, and the estimated repeatability (accor- ding to lessells & boag 1987) of the measurements is high (r > 0.99) (see also nordeide et al. 2006). red colouration in ﬁshes may also be caused by pteridines in addition to carotenoids (grether et al. 2001). pteridines, which have similar spectral properties as carotenoids but, unlike carotenoids, are not extracted in acetone (grether et al. 2001). our measurement of intensity of red is not ﬂawed by the presence of pteridines as the ﬁsh material was colourless after extraction in acetone (e. s. egeland, unpublished data). the chemical composition of the carotenoids of eggs, abdominal skin and ﬁns were, after acetone extraction, analysed by high-pressure liquid chromato- graphy (hplc) separately from each ﬁsh. the eggs of each female were extracted with acetone in a three- step procedure (3 · 50 ml) for at least 72 h in a refrigerator (+2 °c) under nitrogen to prevent carot- enoid degradation. the extraction of carotenoids from 331 nordeide et al. the ﬁve ventral ﬁns (two pelvic, two pectoral and one anal) skin and muscle was performed in the same way using acetone (3 · 8 ml) for ﬁns, (3 · 10 ml) for skin and (3 · 50 ml) for muscle. before hplc analysis, the extract was decanted and ﬁltered through an anotope 0.2 lm syringe ﬁlter (whatman, maidstone, england). the hplc analyses were performed on an agilent 1100 instrument with quaternary pump, thermostatted autosampler, thermostatted column compartment and diode array uv-visible detector. the column was a spheri 5 rp-18 5 lm column with precolumn (brownlee labs 0711-0017 from perkin- elmer), and a gradient system was used as eluant (0 min: 1:4 1 m ammonium acetate (aq):methanol; 30 min: methanol:acetone 7:3, 50 min: methanol:ace- tone:hexane 3:5:2), ﬂow 1.25 mlæmin injection volumes were 100 ll for spines extracts and 50 ll for gonads. all analyses were performed with column temperature 25 °c and detection wavelength 420, 450 and 480 nm (hplc system 4 in egeland et al. (1995)). the retention times were compared with standards by prof. synnøve liaaen-jensen, ntnu, trondheim. qualiﬁcation of different carotenoids was based on retention times (hplc) absorption spectrum, whereas quantiﬁcation was calculated from vis absorption using a1% 1cm = 2500 (schiedt & liaaen-jensen 1995). provided and visible light extracts kindly )1. spectra of ﬁltered as six of the females had been dead for some time before the start of the handling (see above), we carried out an experiment to quantify the potential effect of time since death on the intensity of the red colour at the ﬁsh’s ventral body parts (ir-abdomen) and pectoral ﬁns (ir- ﬁns). the nets used to catch these ﬁsh were set at 5 p.m. on 26 october and retrieved at 9 a.m. the next day. fifteen live ﬁsh were removed from the nets, transported alive to the laboratory where they were killed with a blow to the head. immediately after killing each ﬁsh, starting at 10.15 a.m., its ventral body part was photographed together with a reddish cardboard, indi- vidually tagged, and the same individuals were photo- graphed again 3 and 7.5 h later. between the photo sessions, the dead ﬁsh were kept in fresh water at 7 °c. each photo was analysed and ir-abdomen, ir-ﬁns and ir of the cardboard quantiﬁed as described above. the statistical analyses were carried out with spss, version 14.0. the statistical analyses were impeded by associations between some variables, and by the distribution of the ir-abdomen data neither being in accordance with the assumptions for the multiple regression model applied (see below) nor with the assumptions of general linear models. the variables ir-abdomen, ir-ﬁns and amount of carotenoids in ﬁns were signiﬁcantly correlated (rs > 0.7, p < 0.01, n = 37, spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient). we therefore chose to carry out two 332 different statistical models, one with ir-abdomen as the dependent variable, and the other with ir-ﬁns as the dependent variable. we also chose to exclude the variable amount of carotenoids in ﬁns in the models, as this variable was associated with the dependent variable in both models and as it is a chemical measurement of carotenoids and not a signal per se. in both models, we used the following independent variables: body-length, relative density of leucocytes, relative condition factor, parasite index and (residuals of) amount of carotenoids in eggs (after adjusting for body length). concerning the latter variable, we used studentised residuals after adjusting for length, as there was a positive association between body length and the total amount of carote- noids in the eggs (fig. 1a). the dependent variable in one of the two models, the ir-abdomen, needed to be transformed in order to follow the assumptions for the statistical models. the problem was due to, ﬁrstly, two individuals with extremely high values (fig. 1b). the value of the ir-abdomen of both these individuals (0.574 and 0.611) was more than 1.5 interquartile range (1.5 · 0.0795) above the third quartile (0.428), and were therefore true outliers according to renze (1999– 2007). secondly, the problem was also because of heteroscedasticity when plotted over length (fig. 1b), and indications of two or three sub-groups. a rank- transformation of the ir-abdomen data normalised them appropriately and removed these problems. we started by including all ﬁve independent variables in each of the two multiple regression models. we then removed the most insigniﬁcant variable and the model was run again with the remaining variables. this was repeated until all remaining independent variables had a p-value less than 0.20. in both models, we ended up with two independent variables (‘length’ and ‘residuals of carotenoids in eggs after adjusting for length’). by this procedure, we statistically eliminated the effect of body length in both the dependent variable (‘ir-abdomen’ in one model and ‘ir-ﬁns’ in the other model) and the remaining inde- pendent variable (‘total amount of carotenoids in the eggs’). this gives us an estimate of the association between ir-abdomen (or ir-ﬁns) and total amount of carotenoids in the eggs regardless of body length, which is what we wanted to examine. all p-values were two- tailed unless stated otherwise. the study was carried out in accordance with ethical guidelines stated by the norwegian ministry of agriculture through the animal welfare act. results association between ir-abdomen and the independent variables when including all 37 individuals, the remaining independent variables (with p < 0.20, see material carotenoids in ornaments or eggs?

qualitative aspects of the carotenoids the hplc analyses of the abdominal skin and ﬁns extracts showed similar hplc patterns. both body parts contained mostly carotenoids with canthaxan- thin-like ⁄ astaxanthin-like vis spectra together with carotenoids with zeaxanthin-like ⁄ lutein-like vis spec- tra. both carotenoid types were diesteriﬁed with fatty acids, together with a minor amount of monoesters and free carotenoids. the diesters with canthaxanthin- like ⁄ astaxanthin-like vis spectra were dominant in skin extracts and zeaxanthin-like ⁄ lutein-like diesters in the ﬁn extracts. for the eggs, hplc analyses gave carotenoids with polarity raging from polar (trihydroxycarotene-like) to unpolar (carotenol diester-like). for the polar carote- noids, an apocarotenal vis spectrum and a lutein-like vis spectrum were commonly obtained. for the more unpolar and the most unpolar carotenoids, a lutein-like vis spectrum was common. a few peaks had vis spectra corresponding to canthaxanthin ⁄ astaxanthin. only minor differences could be observed when comparing the chromatograms for the individual gonads, excluding the variety in the total amount of carotenoids. the obtained chromatograms showed a great num- ber of carotenoids in the abdominal skin and ﬁns (>30) and the gonads (>40) of each specimen, most probably because of different fatty esters esteriﬁed to the various carotenoids. different cis ⁄ trans isomers or r ⁄ s diastereomers may also cause some of the peaks in the chromatograms. discussion after adjusting for length, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant association between any of the two potential condi- tion-dependent signals of female arctic charr, the ir-abdomen and the ir-ﬁns and any of the independent variables: (residuals of amount of) carotenoids in eggs, relative condition factor, parasite index and relative density of the two signals and the variable (residuals of the amount of) ‘carotenoids in eggs’ were close to being signiﬁcantly (negatively) associated (tables 1 and 2), the lack of signiﬁcance suggests that the carotenoid-based colour of the females’ abdomen is not a condition-dependent signal. leucocytes. although each of in this it might be argued that conclusions experiment may be ﬂawed because of several circumstances. firstly, the time spent in nets for the 37 ﬁsh may have varied from a few minutes to 5 h. carotenoids in ornaments or eggs? from the method-experiment furthermore, additional stress undergone by reproduc- tively stressed ﬁsh in a net might be signiﬁcant and individuals might differ in sensitivity to such stress (for example, redder old females might be more sensitive to this when compared with young drab females). this is a potential source of error which may weaken conclusions. on the contrary, skarstein & folstad (1996) found no effect of time the arctic charr spent in the nets, which varied from 1 to 3 h, and the intensity or the charrs’ red ornaments. secondly, some of the ﬁsh in this experiment had been dead for some time before they were photographed, and the red colour of the charr’s abdomen and ﬁns might fade or become more intense during this period of time. the results revealed no change in ir of the pectoral ﬁns (ir-ﬁns) the ﬁrst 3 or 7.5 h after the ﬁsh’s death. however, the mean value of the ir-abdomen decreased signiﬁcantly. on the contrary, this decrease was small (£0.0121) both when compared with the mean value at killing (£2.5%) and when compared with the interval between ﬁsh with the minimum (0.372) and maximum (0.610) ir-abdomen values at killing (£5.1%). moreover, no signiﬁcant association was found between percentage decrease and ir-abdomen of the 15 ﬁsh. this suggests that the decrease in ir-abdomen after death did not affect the red and drab ﬁsh differently. the decrease in ir-abdomen from death to measurement a few hours later is therefore not likely to ﬂaw any conclusion in this study. thirdly, our effort to quantify the amount of carotenoids in the females’ muscle was impeded by both the small amounts of carotenoids itself and by fat from the ﬂesh dissolving together with the carotenoids during extraction. the small amount of carotenoids present in the ﬂesh of these females gave the ﬂesh a greyish appearance and no yellow, pink or red colour could be observed. the greyish colour of our spawn- ing charr is in accordance with previous papers reporting that the body pool of carotenoids pigments is redistributed from muscles to skin and gonads in salmonids during maturation and spawning (steven 1949; crozier 1970; ando & hatano 1987; torrissen & naevdal 1988; bjerkeng et al. 1992; synowiecki et al. 1993; hatlen et al. 1995, 1996). our inability to quantify the amount of ﬂesh carotenoids is therefore not likely to ﬂaw any conclusion in this study. fourthly, the distribution of the ir-abdomen vari- able may be interpreted as the specimens in this study are collected from more than one sympatric noninter- breeding ‘sub-group’ (‘morph’ or population). such sub-groups have previously been demonstrated in this species (e.g., magnusson & ferguson 1987 and gardner et al. 1988) as well as in other ﬁsh species like, for example, the three-spined stickleback (mc- phail 1984; schluter 1995). in lakes with more than 335 nordeide et al. one sub-group, the specimens in each group are adapted to different environments within the lake. in some lakes, individuals adapted to a benthic or littoral way of life often have a deep body shape with relatively high condition factor, whereas slim speci- mens of the pelagic morph have a low condition factor (mcphail 1984; magnusson & ferguson 1987; sch- luter 1995). in other lakes, arctic charr may differ in colouration and presence or absence or lateral ‘parr’ marks. ‘normal’ individuals having bright red spawn- ing colours and no parr marks, whereas ‘dwarf’ specimens have dull spawning colours and parr marks (hindar & jonsson 1982). however, the distribution of the relative condition factor of the 37 females from lake soløyvatn shows no sign of being from more than one group (unpublished data), nor did we catch any individuals with lateral parr marks. moreover, the specimens included were all ready to spawn (running) and they were captured within a relatively small area (see materials and methods). it seems not likely that this small area contains more than one breeding ground inhabited by two different sub-groups or populations of charr. consequently, it is not likely that the specimens in this study belong to two noninterbreeding sub-groups, although we cannot reject this possibility based on the measured variables of the 37 females in this study. because of the large numbers of carotenoid peaks in the hplc chromatogram, it was not possible to identify and quantify each carotenoid in the extracts. it is suggested that the large amount of peaks could be isomers, both cis ⁄ trans-isomers and due to several r ⁄ s-diastereomers, in addition to various fatty acid esters. the same pattern of many minor carotenoid compounds is also known from, e.g., turbot eggs (larsen 2000). the ﬁrst of the two predictions (see introduction) in this study did not gain statistically signiﬁcant support. the association between the residuals of amount of carotenoids in the eggs after adjusting for body size, and each of the two measurements of intensity of red at the 37 female charrs’ ventral part, the ir-abdomen and ir-ﬁns were nonsigniﬁcantly negative. the two- sided p-values were 0.134 and 0.114, respectively. one might argue that it is appropriate to use one-sided p-values in this study because the hypothesis was expressed a priori, based on a previous study (nordeide et al. 2006), to test for a potential trade- off (one-sided hypothesis) between the residuals of amount of carotenoids in the eggs adjusted for body length and two measurements of intensity of abdom- inal red colouration (see introduction). the one-sided p-values of 0.067 and 0.057, respectively, are mar- ginally nonsigniﬁcant. moreover, after removing the two nontypical females (‘outliers’, see materials and methods), the negative association between the 336 ir-abdomen and the residuals of amount of carote- noids in the eggs adjusted for body length was marginally nonsigniﬁcant (p = 0.054) under a two- tailed hypothesis and signiﬁcant (p = 0.027) under a one-tailed hypothesis. a signiﬁcantly negative associ- ation would have indicated a trade-off between carotenoids in eggs and ornaments. the ornaments might, under such circumstances, provide males with information about the female’s investment of carote- noids into reproduction. males using this information during reproduction, mating with females with carot- enoids rich eggs, are expected to increase their ﬁtness relative to other males. this is of course only given that all other aspects of females investment into eggs (e.g., size and number of eggs, superior genes, etc.) are equal. however, the negative association between carotenoids in ornament and eggs remains indisputable nonsigniﬁant when all females were included and regardless of whether one- or two-tailed p-values are used. this nonsigniﬁcance is in contrast to the signiﬁcant association between carotenoid-based orna- mentation at the pelvic spines and amount of carot- enoids in the eggs of sticklebacks (nordeide et al. 2006). the lack of condition-dependence of the carotenoid- based ornaments in arctic charr females is not in contrast to the second of the two predictions in this study. compared with the few other studies of this topic in females, our results are in agreement with the study of female sticklebacks (nordeide et al. 2006) and with the nonsigniﬁcant association between the red abdomen and white blood cells among wild arctic charr females reported by (skarstein & folstad 1996). these results are in contrast to the signiﬁcantly higher condition factor of red when compared with drab females arctic charr as reported by the same authors skarstein & folstad (1996). lack of signiﬁcance is, of course, not a bold prediction and supports or dismisses a hypothesis only weakly. the lack of condition-dependence of ornaments in this study is in conﬂict with both the direct selection hypothesis to explain the evolution of female orna- mentation and the hypothesis proposed by fitzpatrick et al. (1995) to explain why females are ornamented to a lesser degree than males. according to the direct selection hypothesis, a positive association and not a trade-off as in this study, is predicted between the carotenoids-based ornamentation and amount of car- otenoids in the eggs. on the contrary, the results from the present study are not in conﬂict with the ‘genetic correlation hypothesis’ which does not assume either condition-dependent ornaments or any association between ornament and eggs. this study does not provide unique support for the usefulness of the recently suggested categorisation of species to explain evolution of female ornamentation (see introduction). although both sexes of arctic charr have the same carotenoid-based ornaments, no signif- icant trade-off of carotenoids was revealed between ornaments and eggs. to conclude, we found no signiﬁcant negative association between amount of carotenoids in the eggs and intensity of red in either the ﬁsh’s abdominal skin or ﬁns although the association revealed was negative and close to signiﬁcant. no evidence of condition- dependence of the females’ red abdominal skin or ventral ﬁns was found. these results do not support the ‘direct selection hypothesis’ to explain the evolu- tion of female ornamentation. acknowledgements the authors thank gunvald jara˚ker for catching the ﬁsh at the spawning grounds, sissel kaino for teaching o.n. how to identify the parasites, and marit bjørnevik, neil metcalfe and two anonymous reviewers for suggestions to improve the manuscript. bodø university college ﬁnanced the study. references adams, c., hamilton, d., mccarthy, i., wilson, a., grant, a., alexander, g., waldron, s., snorasson, s., ferguson, m. & skulason, s. 2006. does breeding site ﬁdelity drive pheno- typic and genetic sub-structuring of a population of arctic charr?
