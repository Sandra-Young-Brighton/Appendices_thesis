e-mail: ben.clemens@ oregonstate.edu accepted for publication february 10, 2009 introduction management practices within the commercial forest, agriculture and power generation industries in the paciﬁc northwest (usa) have resulted in warming of stream temperatures to >20 °c during the summertime (beschta et al. 1987; nrc 1996; epa 2003; usace 2007). the effects of these warm temperatures have been most studied in salmonids (oncorhynchus spp.), where warm temperatures have been linked to elevated metabolic rates and energetic expenditures (brett 1995; lee et al. 2003; rand et al. 2006), use of cool water refugia (goniea et al. 2006; high et al. 2006), altered run times (quinn & adams 1996; hodgson & quinn 2002), susceptibility to disease (reviewed in mccullough 1999) and mortality for late migrants (naughton et al. 2005; keefer et al. 2007). paciﬁc lamprey (entosphenus tridentatus) co-occur with paciﬁc salmon in these warming watersheds, and they have a similar life cycle to paciﬁc salmon (anadromy and semelparity). however, little is known about the effects of summer temperatures on maturing adult paciﬁc lamprey. after ceasing their parasitic stage in the ocean, paciﬁc lamprey return to freshwater during the spring (april–june; beamish 1980), and then begin their initial upstream migration during the summer (july– september; scott & crossman 1973), before overwin- tering during october–march (scott & crossman 1973). like other anadromous lampreys (kott 1971; beamish et al. 1979; larsen 1980), paciﬁc lamprey do not feed during this prolonged freshwater residency (beamish 1980; whyte et al. 1993) and somatic energy reserves fuel sexual maturation (kott 1971; beamish et al. 1979; larsen 1980). as a result, paciﬁc lamprey shrink in body size (beamish 1980; whyte et al. 1993) prior to maturing, spawning, and then dying the following spring (april–july; pletcher 1963, cited in scott & crossman 1973; beamish 1980). most spawning activity in western oregon rivers occurs 418 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00358.x evidence that warm temperatures inﬂuence lamprey maturation between april and may. however, spawning can occur during late may and early june (brumo 2006; gunckel et al. 2006) with very little spawning (<1% of spawning population) occurring during early july in some years (brumo 2006). late spawning activity may be associated with high stream ﬂows and associated cool water temperatures (brumo 2006; gunckel et al. 2006). the aims of the present study were twofold: (1) to examine the effects of relatively warm, summer (>20 °c) on the maturation status temperatures (mature = spermiating or ovulating), maturation tim- ing, survival rates and maturation characteristics (body size and general, qualitative measures of morphology) of paciﬁc lamprey over time (immediately after treatment and 10 months later) and (2) to ascertain whether there was evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between body size and maturation timing. because high temperatures increase metabolism and activity in lampreys (johansen et al. 1973; lewis 1980) as in other ﬁshes, we predicted that shrinkage in body size during freshwater residency would be accentuated at relatively warm water temperatures experienced during the summer. we also predicted that if summer temperatures led to signiﬁcant decreases in body size of paciﬁc lamprey, then a higher percentage of ﬁsh would mature early in comparison with lamprey held at cooler water temperatures. we subjected sexually immature, adult paciﬁc lamprey to relatively warm summer temperatures (>20 °c; ‘warm water group’) that mimicked the diel ﬂuctuations of temper- atures that occur in the willamette river basin during the summer and compared these ﬁsh with ﬁsh reared at relatively cool temperatures that occur in the upper tributaries of the willamette river basin (cool water group). methods adult paciﬁc lamprey were randomly collected by hand from the willamette river at the base of willamette falls near oregon city (or, usa) on 14 june 2006. willamette falls is 43 river kilometres upstream of the conﬂuence of the willamette and columbia rivers, and 206 river kilometres from the paciﬁc ocean. paciﬁc lamprey congregate at the falls prior to ascending during may through october (mesa et al. 2007) and migrating upstream to spawning grounds. the ﬁsh were transported in aerated coolers (66 l) to the fish performance and genetics labora- tory at oregon state university, where they were transferred to a holding tank (4.9 m long · 0.8 m wide · 0.3 m deep, 1000 l) with ﬂow-through, pathogen-free well water. holding tank temperatures averaged 13.5 °c. the tank was covered to prevent escapement and to reduce light levels as lamprey are photophobic (hardisty & potter 1971). nontranspar- ent, plastic pipes (5 cm in diameter and 0.6–0.9 m in length) were provided for refuge for the lamprey, and they were frequently observed using the pipes. during 10 july to 11 july of 2006, 72 healthy- looking ﬁsh were selected from a larger group of ﬁsh. )1 of tricaine the ﬁsh were anaesthetised with 50 mgæl )1 methanesulfonate (ms–222) buffered with 125 mgæl of nahco3. fish were then tagged with passive integrated transponder tags (32 mm long), which were inserted into the body cavity a few millimetres anterior to the cloaca. six ﬁsh were randomly assigned to each of six warm water tanks and six cool water tanks for a total of 36 ﬁsh per experimental group. at the start of the experiment, none of the animals showed signs of secondary sexual characteristics that would enable identiﬁcation of sex, as described by hardisty & potter (1971). )1 at different experimental tanks were circular, with a diameter of 0.8 m, a depth of 0.5 m and volume of 295 l. two plastic, nontransparent pipes (5 cm in diameter and 0.6 m in length) were provided in each tank for lamprey to use as cover. the tanks were covered to reduce light levels. tanks were supplied with ﬂow- through well water at an average ﬂow rate of 1.25 læmin temperatures and the tank temperatures were recorded with automated tempera- ture loggers (hobosò by onset, bourne, ma, usa). we examined temperature patterns in the willamette river basin and used these patterns to guide our warm water and cool water temperature treatments. the gradient of mean summer temperatures in the main- stem willamette river ranged from 16.5 °c in the upper river to 21.9 °c in the lower river (table 1). we also examined the range of temperatures in tributaries to the willamette river with a focus on moderately warm and moderately cold temperature reaches. the mean for moderately warm tributaries = 22.1–22.8 °c, whereas moderately cool tributaries had a mean range of 11.5–14.5 °c (data for years 2001 and 2002 provided by the oregon department of environmental quality). lastly, we examined the range of diel ﬂuctuations in summertime the mainstem temperatures temperatures across range of summertime table 1. mean water temperatures for the mainstem willamette river for july–september. willamette river kilometre 29 64 143 213 291 mean °c 21.7 21.9 20.4 18.9 16.5 data are for year 2001 or 2002 and were provided by the oregon department of environmental quality. 419 clemens et al. willamette river, which were 1.0–3.8 °c (data for the years 2001–2004 provided by the oregon department of environmental quality). based on these tempera- ture patterns in the willamette river basin, we subjected warm water tanks to a target mean temper- ature that mimicked the mean summertime tempera- tures of moderately warm tributaries at 22 °c with a diel temperature ﬂuctuation resembling the maximum temperature ﬂuctuation of 4 °c (minimum temper- ature during nighttime = 20 °c; maximum tempera- ture during the daytime = 24 °c). cool water tanks were subjected to a mean temperature of 13.6 °c, which is within the range of temperatures occurring in moderately cool tributaries (see above) and also the mean annual temperature in the willamette basin (13.3 °c; stanford et al. 2005) (fig. 1). no diel temperature ﬂuctuation was provided for ﬁsh sub- jected to the cool water treatment. fish were acclimated to the warm water treatment from a baseline temperature of 13.6 °c to 20–24 °c during 12 july to 15 july of 2006 by an increasing surge-like temperature regime. for example, heated water was supplied to warm water tanks on 12 july allowing a slow rise in temperature from 13 °c to 16 °c before the water heater was turned off and then again on 13 july from 13 °c to 18 °c before being turned off. this acclimation regime continued with 2 °c increases above the previous day’s maximum ) s u i s l e c ( e r u t a r e p m e t 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 6 0 - e n u j - 1 ww:   cw: 21.8 °c  13.6 °c ww:    cw: 12.8 °c   12.8 °c t n e m t a e r t e r p 6 0 - e n u j - 9 2 l 6 0 - y u j - 7 2 r e t n w i r e v o 6 0 - r e b o t c o - 9 1 t n e m t a e r t 6 0 - t s u g u a - 4 2 6 0 - r e b m e t p e s - 1 2 n o i t a r u t a m 7 0 - y r a u n a j - 1 1 7 0 - y r a u r b e f - 8 7 0 - h c r a m - 8 7 0 - l i r p a - 5 7 0 - y a m - 3 7 0 - y a m - 1 3 6 0 - r e b m e v o n - 6 1 6 0 - r e b m e c e d - 4 1 date fig. 1. temperature proﬁle of the willamette river at willamette falls (grey line;

the data from these ﬁsh were omitted from the analyses. the ﬁsh were transferred to holding tanks for the posttreatment, overwinter to maturation period (mid- october 2006–may 2007). the holding tanks (1.8 m · 0.6 m · 0.6 m, 648 l) were supplied with ﬂow-through well water at an average rate of )1. all tanks had cobble substrate (360– 4.0 læmin 1920 cm3) for refuge. mortalities during the summer treatment period resulted in fewer than the original 36 ﬁsh per treatment group (see results). therefore, 11–14 ﬁsh were held per tank, and two tanks held ﬁsh from the cool water group for a total of 24 ﬁsh between two tanks and two tanks held ﬁshes from the warm water group for a total of 27 ﬁsh between two tanks. aquarium pumps circulated water between each of two tanks in the warm water group and each of two tanks in the cool water group at a mean ﬂow rate of )1. inﬂow rates per tank were approxi- 0.4–0.5 læmin )1. this exchange of water was done mately 0.75 læmin so that mating pheromones and potentially phero- mones that induce sexual maturation (see li 2005) would be similar for all individuals of an experimental group during the spring maturation period. experimental and holding tanks were checked for mortalities at least three times per week, and dead ﬁsh were removed and identiﬁed by tag number. the dead ﬁsh were dissected to identify sex and determine maturation status (mature = ovulating or spermiating). body size of dead ﬁsh was not recorded as we had determined previously that the body size of dead ﬁsh changes following death (b. clemens, unpublished data). to assist in interpretation of the cause of death and to monitor ﬁsh health, we screened a subset of lamprey from a spring 2006 collection (fresh ﬁsh not held in the laboratory) and also from the spring 2007 maturation period (experimental ﬁsh held in the laboratory between june 2006 and may 2007), for common ﬁsh pathogens, including aeromonas salmonicida, the aetiological evidence that warm temperatures inﬂuence lamprey maturation agent of furunculosis (bernoth 1997a; cipriano & bullock 2001). potential key infection sites for a. salmonicida were assayed, including kidney and hem- orrhagic tissue (hiney et al. 1997). samples were placed on tryptic soy agar (tsa) plates and observed for growth after 4–8 days at room temperature. assays were recorded as positive for a. salmonicida if brown- pigmented (chromagenic) colonies grew on the tsa and a brown, diffusible pigment was observed in the medium. this is the classic method for diagnosing presumptive a. salmonicida, although false-negatives (i.e., atypical or achromatic a. salmonicida) and false- positives (i.e., chromagenic bacteria other than a. salmonicida) are minor possibilities with this technique (bernoth 1997b). two isolates were collected from lamprey taken from willamette falls during may 2006 and these isolates were examined for characteristics of presumptive positive a. salmonicida, as described by shotts (1994). six weekly or bi-weekly maturation checks were made on the adult lampreys during the maturation period. during the ﬁrst two maturation checks, all specimens were examined, and 17–31% of all ﬁsh were checked thereafter on the remaining four dates to minimise handling stress on individual ﬁsh. fish within each experimental group were handled identi- cally and all collection gear was disinfected and rinsed thoroughly prior to handling ﬁsh from the other experimental group. the experiment was terminated on 9 may 2007. body weights and total lengths (tls) were mea- sured (1) on anaesthetised ﬁsh before they were stocked into the experimental tanks immediately prior to initiation of the summer temperature treatment (july 2006), (2) on anaesthetised ﬁsh following summer temperature treatment (october 2006) and (3) at the termination of the experiment (may 2007). to mini- mise handling stress during the spring maturation period, ﬁsh were not anaesthetised during march of 2007, and only body weight was measured. at the end of the experiment, all ﬁsh were killed and dissected to identify sex and to determine the maturation status. fish were noted as mature if the males were sperm- iating or if the females were ovulating. statistical analyses we tested for signiﬁcant tank effects (p < 0.05) within treatment groups for differences in body size, survival and sex ratio during the experimental temperature period (july–october 2006). body size was tested with one-way anovas. the proportion of ﬁsh remaining alive, per tank was tested with chi-square at the end of the temperature treatment. finally, the sex ratio of each tank was tested with chi-square. because ﬁsh were subjected to the milieu of all remaining ﬁsh in their treatment group during the overwinter holding to spring maturation periods (october 2006–may 2007), either by cohabitation in the same tank or by recirculation of water from an adjacent tank containing ﬁsh from the same group, tank effects were controlled for. as previously mentioned this was done so that pheromones would be similar for all individuals of an experimental group during the spring maturation period. a repeated measures anova was conducted on the body weights of warm water and cool water ﬁsh during july 2006–march 2007, when sufﬁcient num- bers of both groups of ﬁsh remained alive. relative body size (body weight and tl) reductions over time were calculated as proportional reductions in the initial body size from july 2006 to the end of the summer temperature treatment (october 2006) and july 2006 to the early spring maturation period (march 2007). separate manovas were conducted for body weight and tl for each time period on arcsine-transformed proportions of initial body size. ‘treatment type’, ‘sex’ and the interaction between treatment type and sex were included as model factors in the manova. we tested whether individuals that were initially large during the summer (july 2006; pretreatment phase) lived longer. the initial body weight during july 2006 was used as a dependent factor and ‘treatment type’, ‘sex’, ‘status’ (dead or alive) and the interactions of these terms were factors in manova models for each of two time periods: (1) the treatment period (july– october 2006) and (2) the early maturation period (march 2007). suggestive trends (p < 0.10; ramsey & schafer 2002) were further explored within each experimental group with manovas, one-way anovas, and unpaired t-tests, although the effects were not considered signiﬁcant unless p < 0.05. the manovas included july 2006 body weights as the dependent factors and ‘sex’, ‘status’ (dead or alive) and the interaction of sex and status as model factors. the proportion of ﬁsh remaining alive was calcu- lated for warm water and cool water ﬁsh over time. these proportions were arcsine-transformed and anal- ysed with two ancova models, one for the summer temperature treatment period (july–october 2006) and another for the spring maturation period (march–may 2007). ‘day’ was included as the covariate (continu- ous variable) and ‘treatment type’ (warm water ⁄ cool water) and the interaction between treatment type and day were independent factors in each of these ancova models. results there was no statistically signiﬁcant tank effect within treatment groups on the body size, survival or sex ratio 421 clemens et al. of paciﬁc lamprey. the data for all warm water ﬁsh were pooled and compared with the pooled data from all cool water ﬁsh. changes in body size there was a suggestive, but insigniﬁcant trend for to a warm water ﬁsh to decrease in body weight greater extent the experiment (july 2006–march 2007;

manova, p = 0.2295 (fig. 3b). throughout the experiment (july 2006–march 2007), there was no signiﬁcant difference in proportional decreases in body weight between warm and cool water ﬁsh (manova, p = 0.9669) (fig. 3a). body size, sex and death in cool water ﬁsh male lampreys from the cool water group were signiﬁcantly smaller than females immediately prior to initiation of the summer temperature treatment (july 2006;

(1997), bernoth (1997b), cipriano & bullock (2001). we have also observed an association between this type of internal hemorrhaging and a positive assay for a. salmonicida in adult paciﬁc lamprey (b. clemens et al., unpublished data), which further suggests that the eight mortalities described above likely had furunculosis, although we did not assay these partic- ular ﬁsh for a. salmonicida. two warm water ﬁsh and 17 cool water ﬁsh were assayed during the end of the experiment in may 2007. all of the warm water ﬁsh that were assayed were males because the females had all died earlier (table 2), whereas 12 of the 17 cool water ﬁsh were males. both warm water ﬁsh tested positive for a. salmonicida. only two (1 male + 1 female) of the 17 cool water ﬁsh tested positive for a. salmonicida. the female that tested positive also exhibited symp- furunculosis (nodules ⁄ furuncules), as de- toms of scribed for other ﬁshes by hiney et al. (1997), bernoth (1997b) and cipriano & bullock (2001). all ﬁsh that tested positive were sexually mature (ovu- lating or spermiating), whereas all ﬁsh that tested negative were sexually immature. maturation characteristics when palpated, mature females did not emit eggs unless the ﬁsh were dead or moribund. mature males, however, almost always emitted sperm when pal- pated. eggs appeared on the bottom of tanks holding warm water ﬁsh during mid-april, suggesting that some spawning activity may have occurred during this time. spermiating and ovulating lamprey showed a decrease in the space between their two dorsal ﬁns to the point where the ﬁns touched. these mature ﬁsh also showed secondary sexual characteristics (hardisty & potter 1971) and a liver coloration (kott 1970) similar to previous descriptions for other lampreys. approximately 1 ⁄ 3 of all ﬁsh were examined for liver colour and we found that the liver of immature ﬁsh was typically orange in colouration in both sexes. immature ﬁsh less often had a brown, purple or grey liver colour. during april–may 2007, the liver of mature ﬁsh was typically dark green in both sexes and less frequently a light orange or grey. changes in somatic tissue were correlated with the maturation status of the lamprey. in general, maturing lamprey had a light pink-to-white colouration in the trunk musculature and a relatively thin body wall, whereas immature ﬁsh had a red coloration in the trunk musculature and a relatively thick body wall. discussion because high temperatures can exponentially increase routine metabolism and motor and ventilatory activity in lampreys (johansen et al. 1973; lewis 1980) as in other ﬁshes, we predicted that shrinkage in body size would be accentuated at relatively warm water 423 clemens et al. temperatures experienced during the summer. we also predicted that if summer temperatures led to signiﬁ- cant decreases in body size of paciﬁc lamprey, then maturation would be expedited (i.e., a relatively high proportion of ﬁsh would mature the following spring) in comparison with lamprey held at cool water temperatures. our results supported these predictions. european river lamprey, lampetra ﬂuviatilis, sub- jected to a warm range (12–17 °c) of seasonally – varying temperatures in the lab matured and died earlier (mid-march to early april) within season than those subjected to a cool range (7–11 °c; matured and died late april to mid-may) (larsen 1965). paciﬁc lamprey subjected to relatively warm temperatures during the summer mature the following spring (this study). our paciﬁc lamprey matured between march and may and females tended to mature and die earlier than males, most obviously in the warm water group. the warm water group (and several in the cool water group) matured within the seasonal spawning period of wild ﬁsh, which typically occurs april–early june (brumo 2006; gunckel et al. 2006). the timing of maturation of our lamprey was also identical with the march–may maturation period of paciﬁc lamprey raised in the laboratory under seasonally varying temperatures in another study (mesa & bayer 2005). whereas we do not know whether the remainder of the cool water group would have matured later within the year – the ﬁsh were killed in may so that we could measure and compare body size, maturation status and the presence of the pathogen, a. salmonicida before all of the warm water ﬁsh died – it seems unlikely that the immature, cool water lamprey would have matured during 2007 for two reasons. first, the vast majority of spawning activity occurs in april and terminates by late may or early june in western oregon rivers (brumo 2006; gunckel et al. 2006). second, our immature lamprey did not show morphological ⁄ ana- tomical signs of impending sexual maturation [appar- ent approximately a few weeks to 1 month before sexual maturity in paciﬁc lamprey (b. j. clemens, personal observation) and in l. ﬂuviatilis (larsen 1965)]. however, the idea that cool water may prolong immaturity of paciﬁc lamprey for >1 year in freshwa- ter remains to be explored. wild ﬁsh may have different energy demands than lamprey in the labora- tory, which should be considered when attempting to extrapolate our results to nature. for example, wild ﬁsh could experience greater energy demands than those held in the laboratory via high river ﬂows against which they would have to maintain station or swim against. alternatively, wild lamprey could experience lower energy demands than those held in the labora- tory during the cool overwintering period (e.g., compare the winter temperature proﬁle of our labora- 424 tory ﬁsh with that of willamette falls in fig. 1). the willamette river at maturation and mortality were related to a previ- ously existing small body size in cool water ﬁsh and also to signiﬁcant proportional decreases in body size in warm water ﬁsh. this suggests that a minimum, threshold body size exists at which maturation must occur or sufﬁcient energy reserves will not be available for reproduction. our conclusion seems to agree with larsen’s (1980) conclusion that sexual related to ‘…a maturation in l. ﬂuviatilis was metabolic signal related to starvation’. early maturation timing of adult lamprey exposed to relatively warm summer temperatures raises questions about inﬂuences on ﬁtness. early maturation could minimise the length of time that adult lamprey would be exposed to predation during freshwater residency, which could increase the number of lamprey available for spawning. however, for paciﬁc lamprey experi- encing warm temperatures in the lower river, early maturation timing could uncouple spawn timing with optimal habitat characteristics in the upper watershed for spawning, embryonic development and larval emergence, rearing and growth. clearly, there are many facets to the ecology of maturation timing in paciﬁc lamprey, and more research is needed to ascertain how warm summer temperatures affect reproductive ﬁtness. body size indirect estimates of body shrinkage suggest that paciﬁc lamprey shrink by 18% to 30% in body length between the start of their upstream migrations and spawning (kan 1975; beamish 1980; chase 2001). the direct estimates of our ﬁsh, tracked over the course of 10 months, fall within this range of shrinkage in body length for maturing ﬁsh. for example, four spermiating male lamprey, including one ﬁsh from the warm water group and three from the cool water group, showed maximum reductions in body length of 19–22% between july 2006 and may 2007. the overall reduction in body length between the time these ﬁsh ﬁrst entered freshwater until the end of our experiment was undoubtedly >19–22%. (1992) a difference suggested that through laboratory breeding trials, beamish & in neville tl > 20% precluded successful reproduction be- tween the paired species, river (l. ayresi) and brook (l. richardsoni) lampreys, which led them to suggest that such differences in body length were an isolating factor for reproduction. taken together with estimated shrinkage of 18–30% for paciﬁc lamprey, we wonder whether reductions in tl > 20% would preclude spawning with larger, more recent migrants from the ocean that might mature without overwintering and evidence that warm temperatures inﬂuence lamprey maturation shrinking substantially in body size. our question assumes that ocean-maturing races of paciﬁc lamprey exist; we do not yet have evidence supporting or refuting this hypothesis. aeromonas salmonicida and furunculosis temperatures (15–20 °c) have been warm water correlated with proliferation of a. salmonicida, out- breaks of furunculosis, and increased mortality in salmonids (wedemeyer 1996; pickering 1997). in addition to warm water, furunculosis outbreaks have been attributed to hydrographic features that can aggregate infected ﬁsh, such as at the base of waterfalls (mackie et al. 1930, cited in johnsen & jensen 1994). paciﬁc lamprey can be found in aggregations at temperatures >20 °c at the base of willamette falls (b. clemens, unpublished data), and we have detected a. salmonicida in fresh collections of adult paciﬁc lamprey from this location, and in our experimental ﬁsh, which were also taken from this location. sexual maturation appeared to be associated with incidence of a. salmonicida, although we only directly assayed a subset of mortalities (including euthanized ﬁsh at the end of the experiment) during spring of 2007 (mortalities were examined for gross symptoms during 2006). our research raises questions that warrant further exploration of the nature of the association of a. salmonicida with sexual maturation in paciﬁc lamprey. for example, does a. salmonicida proliferate as a result of the sexual maturation process? does this pathogen kill lamprey before they spawn? maturation characteristics maturation characteristics have been described for other lampreys (kott 1970; hardisty & potter 1971), and yet no comparable descriptions have been pub- lished for paciﬁc lamprey. in paciﬁc lamprey, we found that the lack of space between the two dorsal ﬁns (i.e., the ﬁns touch) occurs as a result of body shrinkage, and it appears to be a consistent indicator of sexual maturation in paciﬁc lamprey (this study) and in other lampreys (hardisty & potter 1971). we also observed a correlation between sexual maturity and liver colour – immature ﬁsh generally had orange- coloured livers whereas mature ﬁsh generally had dark green-coloured livers. this ﬁnding is consistent with work by kott (1970) on great lakes sea lamprey (petromyzon marinus): early-migrating ﬁsh had or- ange livers, and late-migrating, mature ﬁsh had green- coloured livers. the green colouration arises from the accumulation of the bile pigment, biliverdin, in the liver and an associated degeneration of the liver (kott 1970). acknowledgements brett
