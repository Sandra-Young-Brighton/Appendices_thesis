university, arkansas, usa abstract - lake ashbaugh, located in northeast arkansas, was con- structed in 1981, and initially stocked with florida largemouth bass fol- lowed by supplemental stockings of northern largemouth bass. allele fre- quencies of three discriminant allozyme loci (saat-b: sidh-b, smdh- b) between florida and northern largemouth bass were determined for 414 largemouth bass collected between 1994 and 1996. f, bass domi- nated our sample, with 62.3% possessing florida largemouth bass alleles. a high incidence of hardy-weinberg disequilibrium was observed, in- dicative of genetic change within the population. no significant differ- ences were identified for frequency of age classes, relative weight, and length at age between the northern, f, and f, phenotypes. despite being located north of what is generally considered suitable for stocking florida largemouth bass, it was demonstrated that temperature is not selective at present against bass possessing florida largemouth bass alleles. how- ever, caution should prevail when introducing non-native stock into native gene complexes, as introduced genes persist through many generations. key words: largemouth

true for the florida largemouth bass (m. s. floridanus), that has been intensively stocked throughout the south- ern united states because of superior growth characteristics (addison & spencer 1971). as a re- sult, introgression of florida largemouth bass with native stocks of northern largemouth bass (m. s. salmoides) has been prevalent (philipp et al. 1982). increasing concern about the long-term effects of diluting native coadapted gene complexes of northern largemouth bass with genes from florida stocks, and the ability of florida largemouth bass and intergrades between florida largemouth bass and northern largemouth bass to survive and thrive in northern waters have arisen. many studies have focused on differential growth par- ameters and thermal tolerance of the two sub- species and their intergrades (e.g,. zolczynkski & davies 1973; inman et al. 1976; cichra et al. 1980; fields et al. 1987; philipp & whitt 1991). infor- mation garnered from such studies has shaped florida largemouth bass and northern largemouth bass stocking practices. for example, the arkansas game and fish commission and the oklahoma department of wildlife conservation regularly stock florida largemouth bass in selected southern arkansas and southeastern oklahoma reservoirs, respectively (armstrong 199 1; gilliland 1992). the oklahoma department of wildlife conservation utilizes 3400 heating degree days as its critical limit for stocking florida largemouth bass (gilliland 1992). heating degree days are defined as the sum 35 johnson & fulton over all days of the difference between 18.3”c and the average daily temperature for those days below that temperature (philipp et al. 1982). existing studies of differing largemouth bass phenotypes have focused on lakes that received controlled stockings of florida largemouth bass to enhance the bass fishery of that lake (maceina et al. 1988; gilliland & whittaker 1989). little atten- tion has been paid to lakes initially stocked with florida largemouth bass followed by supplemental stockings of northern largemouth bass. the objec- tives of the present study were to: 1) determine the frequency of alleles specific to florida largemouth bass in lake ashbaugh of northeast arkansas, 2) determine the frequency of northern largemouth bass, florida largemouth bass, f1 intergrade, or f, phenotypes by age class, and 3), compare gen- etic constitution to several measures of fitness, in- cluding age distribution, relative weight and length at age. study site lake ashbaugh is a 243-hectare lake constructed in 1981 and located in greene county in the northeast corner of arkansas. the source water is the adjacent black river, which is periodically pumped in to maintain water levels. it was stocked continuously from 1982 to 1991 with a total of 126,655 largemouth bass (table 1). the first 50,000 largemouth bass stocked were florida largemouth bass, while all other largemouth bass stocked were northern largemouth bass. initial growth of the bass in lake ashbaugh was good, as is typical for new reservoirs. however, there has been a progressive deterioration in the largemouth bass fishery in lake ashbaugh over the past several years despite several length limit changes to improve recruitment and growth (s. henry, arkansas game and fish commission, personal communication). a 15” (381 mm) length limit supplanted an existing 12” (300 mm) limit beginning in 1987. in mid-1993 a 16-21” (406-533 mm) slot limit was enacted with possession of one bass over 21” (533 mm) allowed, in an attempt to alleviate the problems of stockpiling. periodic winter kills of mature largemouth bass over a three-year period (1989-1991) and again in 1996, poor growth and low relative weight led to the hypothesis that florida largemouth bass alleles re- mained prevalent in lake ashbaugh bass, as florida largemouth bass are considered by the ar- kansas game and fish commission to be poorly adapted for northern arkansas winters (arm- strong 1991). lake ashbaugh, with a ten-year heating degree days mean of 3,320 (sd= 500){noaa 1984-1994}, approaches but does not exceed the limits set by the oklahoma department of wildlife conservation. methods largemouth bass (n=414) were collected by elec- trofishing and rotenone sampling from lake ash- baugh in the summers of 1994 (n=73), 1995 (n= 128) and 1996 (n=213). scales and otoliths were removed from largemouth bass collected. bass were categorized as young of the year, age 1, age 2, etc. otoliths of young bass (<age 3) were observed intact, while otoliths of older largemouth bass were cross-sectioned to a thickness of 0.5 mm. livers and skeletal muscle tissue were removed and stored at - 70°c for later electrophoretic analysis. the length of the bass at the end of each grow- ing season was determined by using the fraser-lee method for back-calculation (anderson & gut- table 1. stocking and sources of largemouth bass by the arkansas game and fish

back-calculated lengths were calculated for only the two most recent growing seasons for largemouth bass older than age 3 (carlander, 1982). condition was measured using relative weight (w,) for each individual largemouth bass (wege & anderson 1978). a two-tailed &test deter- mined the significance of differences between the w, of the present study as compared with the opti- mal values recommended by wege & anderson (1978). bass were designated as florida largemouth bass, northern largemouth bass, or their inter- grades (f, and f,) on the basis of electrophoretic mobilities of the specific allozymes utilized by fish management agencies for the purpose of identify- ing broodstock (gilliland 1992; t. penniston, ark- ansas game and fish commission, personal com- munication). largemouth bass were designated as florida largemouth bass or northern largemouth bass if they were homozygous for all loci specific for that subspecies, f1 intergrades if heterozygous for each locus, and f, for other allelic combi- nations. it should be noted that these designations are for communication and labeling purposes, as bass homozygous for both alleles and designated as “pure” florida or northern largemouth bass are probably not “pure”. differing survival of age classes was tested by chi-square. liver and muscle homogenate was electrophor- esed on a cellulose acetate plate tris-citrate or tris- glycine buffers (ph 6.9) at 200 v (8 ma) on ice for 30 min (helena laboratories). the plates were stained using the recipes of hebert & beaton (1989). loci utilized for the discrimination of the largemouth bass phenotypes were isocitrate de- hydrogenase (sidhp-b, enzyme number 1.1.1.42), aspartate aminotransferase (saat-b, 2.6.1. l), and malate dehydrogenase (smdh-b, 1.1.1.37). alleles are differentially fixed for the loci sidhp-b and for both florida largemouth bass and northern largemouth bass. the two alleles of saat-b* which occur solely in florida largemouth bass, saat-b*3 and saat- saat-b persistence of florida bass alleles b*#, were combined, as were the two alleles solely occurring in northern largemouth bass, saat-b*z and saa t-b*2, to clarify reporting within the stated goals of the present study. two alleles for smdh-b (*i and *2) are present in the northern largemouth bass, yet a single allele (smdh-b*2) is fixed for the florida largemouth bass. the pres- ence of smd h- b *i was used as a screen for poss- ible florida largemouth bass. for example, two bass identified as florida largemouth bass through the use of sidhp-b and saat-b were determined to be f, due to the existence of the smdh-b*i allele in both bass. an additional 16 bass orig- inally designated as f1 due to heterozygosity €or the loci sidhp-b and saat-b were characterized as f, due to those bass being homozygous for the smdh-b*l allele. this illustrates that the more loci investigated within a mixed population the more probable that individual bass will be cor- rectly classified. direct-count heterozygosity and hardy-wein- berg equilibrium (d statistics) were determined using the program biosys-1 (swofford & seland- er 1989). the genetic composition of each sample was tested for linkage equilibrium at each pairwise combination of loci (hill 1974). analysis of vari- ance (anova) was utilized to compare condition and back-calculated length at age for the three phenotypes identified. a scale of 0 to 6 was estab- lished for comparing the proportion of northern largemouth bass to florida largemouth bass alleles within each individual. a score of six represented a bass homozygous for the northern largemouth bass alleles at all three loci. pearson-product corre- lation coefficients were determined for relative weight versus the scaled value. results and discussion

sixty-two percent of the largemouth bass collected from lake ashbaugh possessed florida largemouth bass alleles, most of which were phenotypically f, (table 2). florida largemouth bass allele frequencies were common for each locus, with frequencies ranging from 0.20 for saat-b*34 alleles to 0.27 for smdh-b*2, which occurs in both subspecies (table 3). hetero- zygosity values ranged from 0.292 to 0.382 for the loci studied (table 3). several other arkansas bass populations have been surveyed (table 3), reveal- ing highly variant allele frequencies depending upon the management goals and stocking history of the arkansas game and fish commission. in the majority of populations allele frequencies for sidhp-b and saat-b were quite similar, with al- lele frequencies for smdh-b quite variant. a reasonable prediction of florida largemouth bass allele frequencies based upon the stocking his- tory of lake ashbaugh is difficult due to timing, table 4.heterozygote deficiency (-) or

of lake ashbaugh bass (table 11, and survival rates for supplemental stocking into reservoirs are diffi- cult to determine (boxrucker 1986). four possible factors may explain or contribute to the current status of the lake ashbaugh largemouth bass population: genetic drift, differential survival of stocked bass, selection, and brood stock contami- nation. of these, genetic drift is not likely due to the stocking of high numbers of individuals of each phenotype. florida largemouth bass were initially stocked into lake ashbaugh. it was expected that a greater proportion of those bass would be established into the breeding population. bass first stocked in a newly constructed reservoir face low predation and competition. this variable should result in greater florida largemouth bass allele frequencies, despite current evidence to the contrary (i.e., one of four to five alleles are florida largemouth bass alleles). sizes of stocked bass ranged from 2-9'' (5-23 cm) and were introduced in all seasons from year to year (table 1). largemouth bass stocked at greater size have greater survival rates than do smaller bass (laska 1982). largemouth bass stocked in the spring and summer months would also better sur- vive due to fewer environmental stresses and greater food availability. preferential survival of initially stocked largemouth bass resulting in an in- crease in florida largemouth bass allele frequen- cies is not supported by the data. selection against florida largemouth bass alleles may have occurred, reducing allele frequencies. in- deed, hines et al. (1983) demonstrated in vitro thermal kinetic differences between the two latit- udinally distributed mdh-1 alleles of the largemouth bass. thermal optima of alleles corre- lating with geographic distribution has also been demonstrated for fish populations of the desert sucker (catostomus clarkii; koehn 1970), fathead minnow (pimephales promelas; merritt 1972), and mummichug (fundulus heteroclitus; place & powers 1979). reduced florida largemouth bass allele fre- quency may have resulted from broodstock that were not pure florida largemouth bass. intraspec- ific contamination of largemouth bass broodstock in state hatcheries has been a common phenom- enon (philipp et al. 1982; gilliland & whittaker 1989). indeed, analysis of the hulsey fish hatch- ery broodstock in 1987-1988, several years follow- ing the stocking of lake ashbaugh in 1982 with “pure” florida largemouth bass, revealed that a majority (-70%) of the broodstock were inter- grades between the two subspecies (d. brader, manager, hulsey state fish hatchery, personal communication.). these findings resulted in exten- sive ongoing genetic testing within the hulsey state fish hatchery florida largemouth bass brood- stock. while other largemouth bass stocked were reportedly northern largemouth bass the genetic constitution of the broodstock of other hatcheries has never been verified (b. beavers, manager, lonoke state fish hatchery, personal communi- cation). broodstock contamination would greatly impact the frequency of florida largemouth bass alleles. age distribution the largemouth bass population of lake ash- baugh has a high percentage of young bass; only 53 of the 414 bass aged were age 3 or greater (table 2). age data may not be representative of the age structure of the reservoir due to size sampling bias- es inherent to electrofishing and rotenone sam- pling. no differences were identified when using scales or otoliths for age determination, which is persistence of florida bass alleles consistent with findings by doerzbacher & schramm (1982). counts of each of the three phenotypes (northern largemouth bass, f1, and f,) were determined for each age class (table 2). no significant difference in frequency of age was identified between the three phenotypes (p=0.78). selection can be manifested by mortality or reduc- tions in reproductive success. lake ashbaugh largemouth bass have suffered periodic winter kills; unfortunately, the genotypes of these individ- uals are unavailable. no differences were observed, however, in comparing phenotypes of varying age classes, although selection may be periodic in na- ture (endler 1986). seven of 12 samples were not in hardy-wein- berg equilibrium, with most deviations due to heterozygote deficiencies (table 4). the high degree of hardy-weinberg disequilibrium ob- served is indicative that this population is in a state of genetic change. assortative mating is a possible explanation for heterozygote deficiency; however, assortative mating has not been observed for the two subspecies or their intergrades (brown & murphy 1994). no linkage disequilibrium was identified for any of the allelic combinations (saat-bxsidhp-b, p=0.39; saat-bxsmdh-b, p= 0.46; s id hp- b x smd h- b, p= 0.62), and can- not be utilized to explain the high levels of disequi- librium. relative weight the condition of adult largemouth bass was deter- mined for bass electrofished in late may for each of the three years (n=165). the condition of bass declines dramatically post-spawn. physiologic dif- ferences existing between the phenotypes should be magnified following the spawn if indeed those bass possessing florida alleles do not store winter fat reserves as efficiently as their northern largemouth bass counterparts (philipp 1992). the relative weights of each subgroup were quite low, signifi- cantly lower (p<o.ool) than the standard of 100 for a quality bass population as established by table 5. mean relative weight values (w,) for largemouth bass of differing phenotypes collected from lake ashbaugh, arkansas, 1994-1996 (standard deviation in parentheses). data from 1994-1996 and

of the same years, al- though greater than that for may sampling (un- publ. data), were also significantly less than the standard established by gutreuter & childress (1990). relative weight has temporal tendencies, and condition is modified by events such as food avail- ability, weather patterns that inhibit feeding, and reproduction. for this reason, data were pooled for all years by establishing the mean relative weight as 0 for each year class. mean differences were cal- culated for each subgroup as a difference from the mean for each sampling year. each phenotype dif- fered from the normative mean by less than a single percent. no significant relationship was identified for any sample when a genetic value (range 0-6) relative to genotype was correlated with relative weight (mean r= -0.12). length at age growth of bass is modified by chronic environ- mental variables such as length of growing season and food availability. due to annual variability in these and other measures, length at age was pooled for year classes within phenotypes similar to that performed for relative weight (table 6). no sig- nificant differences were identified between pheno- types for back-calculated length-at-age. fitness of individuals can be reduced without af- fecting mortality, and can be demonstrated by sublethal parameters, such as growth rates and condition. smith & wilson (1980), maceina & murphy (19881, and gilliland (1992) identified young bass possessing florida largemouth bass al- leles as having lower condition indices than north- ern largemouth bass in tennessee, texas, and ok- lahoma reservoirs, respectively. several researchers have measured mean florida largemouth bass length at age as greater than that of northern largemouth bass populations in lakes (e.g., addi- son & spencer 197 1 ; inman et al. 1976; maceina & murphy 1988), while other researchers have iden- tified greater growth for northern largemouth bass (e.g., smith & wilson 1980; kleinsasser et al. 1990; philipp & whitt 1991). still other studies have re- vealed no growth differences between the two sub- species (e.g., sasaki 1961; miller 1965). the vari- ables of growth rate and condition are very similar between of lake ashbaugh largemouth bass, further support for a lack of selection at present for northern largemouth bass alleles. temperature can not be definitively hypo- thesized as a current selective force against bass possessing florida largemouth bass alleles. phenotypes it must be reiterated that the use of the term “phenotype” for the present study is more descrip- tive than absolute. considerable allele blending has occurred in lake ashbaugh over the past decade. this blending could help explain the similar rela- tive weights of the phenotypes identified for the present study. the utility of several diagnostic loci to represent the genetic interactions of thousands of genes is limited for multigenerational studies. an increase in the identification and utilization of diagnostic loci between these two subspecies will increase the power of resolution for the interaction of genetics and the environment (endler 1986). introductions of exogenous gamefishes have been intentional (stocking programs) or uninten- tional (aquaculture escapees), with varying degrees of impacts on native populations. introduced fish typically are genetically different from the native table 6. back-calculated lengths for the first three years for largemouth bass of differing phenotypes collected from lake ashbaugh of various phenotypes for

genetic identity (e.g., walleyes) to evaluate stocking effectiveness (koppelman et al. 1992; jen- nings & philipp 1992). thus, the potential arises for the introduction of maladaptive genes into na- tive populations. some native populations have been inundated with hybridization events (whit- more 1983; allendorf & leary 1988; verspoor 1988), introgression (taggart & ferguson 1986; stark et al. 1995) or largely replaced by introduced stock due to competition (ryman 1981; nickelson et al. 1986), disease (johnsen & jensen 1986) or unidentified causes (altukhov 198 1). once alleles of an exotic stock are introduced to a new environ- ment their presence and effects may persist for many generations. the cause for concern may be lessened for a non-native species introduced into an artificial sys- tem such as a reservoir (lake ashbaugh). how- ever, of perhaps greater concern is the potential effect of escaped individuals into surrounding lotic waters. water levels of lake ashbaugh are main- tained by pumping water out of the black river. the potential for genetic contamination of native riverine stocks of largemouth bass alleles from lake ashbaugh bass is therefore great. evidence of accidental introduction of non-native alleles into native largemouth bass populations has been observed in oklahoma (gelwick et al. 1995) and alabama (dunham et a]. 1992). this behooves fisheries managers to develop not only long-term management plans but also containment strategies for the stocking of florida largemouth bass and other introduced species. 1. durante las tres o cuatro ultimas

floridanus, m. s. sal- moides e hibridos (f, o fj. tambikn medimos el peso relativo y la longitud para cada edad que fueron asociados a 10s fenoti- pos. m6s de la mitad (62.3%) de 10s ejemplares poseen alelos de m. s. floridanus, con domindncia de f,. las frecuencias de alelos de m. s. floridanus fue comun en cada locus, con frecuen- cias que varian entre 0.20 para 10s alelos saat-b*34, hasta 0.27 para 10s smdh-b*2. 3. pudimos observar una gran incidencia del desequilibrio de hardy-weinberg, lo que indica un cambio genttico dentro de persistence of florida bass alleles la poblacion. no encontramos diferencias significativas en la frecuencia de las clases de edad, el peso relativo y la longitud entre 10s fenotipos de m. s. salmoides, f, y f,. 4. a. pesar de que el lago esta situado al norte de una zona propicia para la introduccion de m. s. floridanus, parece que la temperatura no es selectiva contra 10s ejemplares que poseen alelos de m s. floridanus, si bien es necessario tener cierta p r e caucion a la hord de introducir ejemplares exoticos en comple- jos genicos nativos, ya que 10s genes introducidos persisten du- rante muchas generaciones. this research was funded
