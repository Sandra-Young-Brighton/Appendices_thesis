baltz & moyle 1993). several recent studies have highlighted the role that native predators can play in limiting the abundance or distribution of invasive species (byers et al. 2002; harvey et al. 2004; derivera et al. 2005; shinen et al. 2009). in many of these cases, the key interaction between native predators and exotic prey that ulti- mately limited the exotic species was restricted to speciﬁc predator species, size-speciﬁc predation, or occurred across a limited spatial or temporal scale. identifying and quantifying these unique trophic interactions between native predators and exotic prey increases our understanding of invasion biology and may improve methods for control of nonnative species. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00469.x 133 tetzlaff et al. the dynamics and impacts of rusty crayﬁsh (orco- nectes rusticus) have been well studied since their expansion beyond the ohio river valley in the 1970s (capelli & magnuson 1983; lodge & hill 1994). in northern wisconsin (usa) lakes, introduced rusty crayﬁsh often establish high densities and rapidly replace sympatric congeners o. virilis and o. propin- quus (capelli 1982; olsen et al. 1991; didonato & lodge 1993). abundant rusty crayﬁsh have a strong, negative inﬂuence on littoral community structure, and can reduce the abundance of macrophytes (lodge & lorman 1987; lodge et al. 1994), benthic inverte- brates (lodge et al. 1994; mccarthy et al. 2006) and some ﬁshes (wilson et al. 2004). however, rusty crayﬁsh do not become abundant in all lakes, despite abiotic (mainly calcium ion concentration) and habitat (mainly the abundance of cobble substrate) conditions conducive to high crayﬁsh abundance (lodge & hill 1994; garvey et al. 2003). fish predation has been posed as one potential mechanism limiting rusty crayﬁsh density, but limited empirical evidence exists to support this hypothesis. fish predation is an important determinant of food web structure (carpenter et al. 1987), and can inﬂu- ence the success of established exotic species (rob- inson & wellborn 1988). crayﬁsh are known to be an important component in many ﬁsh diets (stein 1977; probst et al. 1984; garvey et al. 2003) and predation by ﬁshes can account for a substantial percentage of total crayﬁsh mortality (rabeni 1992). however, only a few studies have demonstrated that ﬁsh predation on crayﬁsh can be large enough to effectively control crayﬁsh population abundance (svardson 1972; rach & bills 1989). despite an abundance of studies that detail preda- tor–prey interactions between ﬁsh and crayﬁsh in northern wisconsin lakes (e.g., didonato & lodge 1993; garvey et al. 1994, 2003; lodge & hill 1994), relationships between speciﬁc ﬁsh predators and rusty crayﬁsh remain unclear. lodge & hill (1994) and garvey et al. (2003) found that rusty crayﬁsh abun- dance in 21 northern wisconsin lakes was negatively correlated with the biomass of common crayﬁsh predators, including yellow perch (perca ﬂavescens), largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides) and rock bass (ambloplites rupestris). alternatively, in a similar study spanning 57 lakes, roth et al. (2007) found no negative relationship between rusty crayﬁsh catches and abundance of yellow perch, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu), walleye (sander vitreus), or rock bass. only catches of bluegill (lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (lepomis gibbosus) were inversely related with rusty crayﬁsh trap catches. while yellow perch, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and rock bass are all known to prey on crayﬁsh and often viewed as traditional crayﬁsh 134 predators, predation by bluegill and pumpkinseed on crayﬁsh is not well established. given the diverse feeding habits of bluegill and pumpkinseed, their ability to achieve dense populations, and the observed negative correlation with rusty crayﬁsh abundance across lakes, the role of native sunﬁshes as predators of the nonnative rusty crayﬁsh warrants investigation. in this study, we quantify the predator–prey inter- action between three native centrarchids and nonnative rusty crayﬁsh in northern wisconsin lakes. we focus on the role of bluegill and pumpkinseed (herein combined and referred to collectively as lepomis) as crayﬁsh predators while contrasting crayﬁsh predation by lepomis to rock bass, which is considered a more traditional crayﬁsh predator (probst et al. 1984; rabeni 1992) and was relatively abundant in all four study lakes. the main goals of this study were to (i) characterise predation on rusty crayﬁsh by lepomis in terms of the intensity, size distribution and timing and (ii) use bioenergetics models, ﬁsh abundance estimates and crayﬁsh abundance estimates to determine the population-level effects of ﬁsh predation by lepomis on rusty crayﬁsh. methods study lakes we sampled ﬁsh and crayﬁsh in arrowhead, big, trout and wild rice lakes in vilas county, wisconsin. all four lakes have similar water chemistry, although physical attributes differ between lakes (roth et al. 2007). big and trout lakes are substantially larger (344 and 1,608 ha) than arrowhead and wild rice lakes (40 and 153 ha) and have greater maximum depths. the proportion of littoral area consisting of cobble habitat was greatest in wild rice lake (34%), followed by trout lake (21%), big lake (17%) and arrowhead lake (8%). the proportion of littoral area consisting of macrophyte habitat was greatest in arrowhead lake (79%), followed by wild rice lake (58%), big lake (38%) and trout lake (4%). preliminary surveys conducted in 2002 and 2003 revealed that arrowhead and wild rice lakes con- tained low crayﬁsh densities, whereas big and trout lakes had much higher densities (roth 2005). crayﬁsh samples crayﬁsh were sampled between 7 july and 14 july 2004, following the release of juveniles from brooding females. adult crayﬁsh were collected from cobble substrate by hand with scuba at three sites during daylight hours. cobble substrate was deﬁned as those areas where rocks greater than 3 cm diameter com- prised more that 50% of the substrate area. at each of three sites within each lake, adult crayﬁsh were collected from ten 1-m2 quadrats, resulting in a total of 30 samples from each lake. quadrats were lined with vertical netting so crayﬁsh could not escape after the quadrat was placed on the substrate (lorman 1980; roth & kitchell 2005). this method has been shown to produce accurate crayﬁsh size distribution and density estimates (france 1985; france et al. 1991; lamontagne & rasmussen 1993). forced air vacuum to collect juvenile crayﬁsh samples were collected concur- rently with adult crayﬁsh samples. we used an underwater juvenile crayﬁsh, similar to the method of wahle & steneck (1991). this method has been shown to effectively sample juvenile american lobster (homarus americ- anus) as small as 4-mm carapace length (incze & wahle 1991, roth unpublished data). a 0.09-m2 ring was placed within four of the ten 1-m2 quadrats at each site (for a total of 12 samples per lake) prior to adult sampling and vacuumed for 1–2 min or until only sand remained. all crayﬁsh and sediment were captured in a 500-lm mesh bag attached to the distal end of the vacuum. juvenile samples were combined with the corresponding adult samples because larger crayﬁsh (up to about 30 mm carapace length) were often captured in juvenile samples. the mean density (numberæm2) was calculated by dividing the number caught in each sample by the area sampled and then averaging across all samples in each lake. the total crayﬁsh population in each lake was estimated by multiplying the mean crayﬁsh density (adults and juveniles) by the total area of the littoral zone covered by cobble. the total area of cobble substrate was calculated using arcview software and georeferenced bathymetric maps. associated 95% conﬁdence intervals on each crayﬁsh population were determined from the error associated with the mean density, then multiplied to the whole-lake scale. although the vast majority of the crayﬁsh population is found in cobble substrate, crayﬁsh may occur in alternative habitats (e.g., downed wood, macrophytes) (lorman 1980; kershner & lodge 1995; garvey et al. 2003). garvey et al. (2003) found mean rusty crayﬁsh densities to be substantially greater in cobble (19.1) than in macrophyte (0.4) habitats. preference for cobble habitats is strongest for juvenile crayﬁsh and decreases as crayﬁsh become less vulnerable to predation (stein & magnusson 1976). thus, our population estimates, particularly for larger crayﬁsh that are less vulnerable to predation, are likely underestimates of true abundance. fish population estimates and diet samples we collected bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass for stomach contents, growth estimates and mark-recap- native ﬁsh predation on invasive crayﬁsh ture population estimates using fyke nets and boat electroﬁshing. three fyke nets were set once a week on each lake between 24 june and 1 august 2004. fyke net locations were selected to accomplish two goals: (i) sample representative habitat types including cobble, vegetation and the ecotone between these habitats and (ii) maximise catch of lepomis. for each sample, fyke nets were set before dusk, retrieved an hour after sunset and immediately re-deployed. the nets were retrieved between 07:00 and 09:00 the following morning. soak times were always less than 10 h in order to minimise the inﬂuence of differential gastric evacuation of prey items on observed stomach contents (richardson & nickol 1998). for each net set we measured lepomis and rock bass, clipped a pelvic ﬁn and collected stomach contents using gastric lavage (seaburg 1957). all ﬁsh were released alive. we collected the recapture samples using boat electroﬁshing in order to more thoroughly sample the entire lake. electroﬁshing events consisted of sampling the entire shoreline of the lake (except trout lake) at the 1-m depth contour and occurred twice on each lake in consecutive weeks in august. trout lake was too large to sample the entire shoreline, so electroﬁshing occurred in the southern basin and along shorelines where bathymetry was conducive to electroﬁshing. for all ﬁsh captured by electroﬁshing we examined ﬁsh for marks, measured total length and collected diets using gastric lavage. to estimate the population size and associated 95% ci of bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass we used the chapman modiﬁcation of the schnabel continuous mark-recapture method (ricker 1975). log transformed to meet stomach samples were preserved in 95% ethanol and analysed in the laboratory. prey were sorted to taxonomic order, dried at 57°c for 48 h and weighed to 0.0001 g as the basis for calculating percent contribution to the diet. carapace length (cl) of crayﬁsh in diets was measured with calipers. when only chelae were recovered, crayﬁsh size was calcu- lated using chela length vs. carapace length regres- sions (garvey & stein 1993). for all statistical comparisons, ﬁsh length (mm) and carapace length (mm) were natural the assumption of homogeneity of variance. to determine if the probability of crayﬁsh occurrence in ﬁsh diets was related to ﬁsh length we used logistic regression. a two-tailed t test was used to compare the number of crayﬁsh found in diets of lepomis and rock bass containing crayﬁsh. crayﬁsh carapace length (mm) was regressed against ﬁsh length (mm) to determine if the size of crayﬁsh consumed increased with predator length. to compare between-species differences in the size of crayﬁsh consumed, we performed analysis of covariance (ancova) using ﬁsh length (mm) as the covariate and carapace length (mm) as the dependent variable. 135 tetzlaff et al. fish bioenergetics model at the whole-lake scale, crayﬁsh consumption by bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass was estimated for the period june 24 through august 20 using fish bioenergetics 3.0 (kitchell et al. 1977; hanson et al. 1997). the model requires inputs of diet composi- tion, temperature, prey energy densities and predator growth as basis for estimating prey-speciﬁc con- sumption over a speciﬁed time period. bioenergetics model parameters were previously determined for bluegill and rock bass (kitchell et al. 1977; roell & orth 1993). we substituted bluegill model parameters for pumpkinseed given the close kinship and mor- phology of these species. age and length-at-age were determined from scales from all three species for each lake. lengths were converted to weights using lake-speciﬁc length-weight regressions. we ﬁt a von bertalanffy growth curve to the age-weight data to estimate the average annual growth (in mass) for each age class within each lake (ricker 1975). to more accurately quantify the contribution of all predator ages to crayﬁsh consumption, population estimates of each predator were divided into cohorts according to the size structure found in each lake. diet composition of each species on each lake was quantiﬁed as the percent diet dry mass on each sampling date; diets collected on consecutive days from fyke nets were counted as a single sample. prey energy densities were determined from cummins & wuycheck (1971) or hanson et al. (1997) and assumed constant throughout the simulation period. temperature data for lakes other than trout lake were unavailable. however, several surrounding lakes (<10 km) within the north temperate lakes long- term ecological research network (ntl-lter) closely matched the size and bathymetry of our study lakes and have extensive limnologicial moni- toring programs (http://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/). we substituted bimonthly temperature at 1 m from spar- kling lake for arrowhead lake, allequash lake for wild rice lake and big muskellunge lake for big lake. we calculated the number of crayﬁsh consumed for each predator species by cross-referencing estimates of prey biomass consumption from bioenergetics model simulations with crayﬁsh sizes found in predator stomachs. the length distribution of crayﬁsh con- sumed by each predator species was combined across lakes. lengths were converted into biomass using a length-weight regression of rusty crayﬁsh from spar- kling lake in vilas county (hein et al. 2006). the number of crayﬁsh consumed by each predator was calculated following the equation used in roth et al. (2007): 136 ntot ¼ b  x nl nmeasured l  bl where ntot is the total number of crayﬁsh consumed, b is the total crayﬁsh biomass consumed (from bioen- ergetics), nl is the number of crayﬁsh measured at length l in each predator species, nmeasured is the total number of crayﬁsh measured from each predator species, and bl is the mass of an individual crayﬁsh at length l. we compared consumption estimates from bioener- getics modeling to crayﬁsh population estimates to quantify the predatory impact of lepomis and rock bass on the crayﬁsh population. the predatory impact was calculated as the percent of the crayﬁsh popula- tion consumed by each predator. we evaluated uncer- tainty associated with predatory impact estimates by comparing consumption estimated using the upper and lower 95% conﬁdence intervals of the ﬁsh population estimate with upper and lower 95% conﬁdence intervals of the crayﬁsh population estimates. results fish and crayﬁsh population estimates (mean = 49,357,000;

for lep- omis, mean = 10.3 ± 2.3 mm cl, n = 104; for rock bass, mean = 25.3 ± 12.6 mm cl, n = 72) (fig. 2). all of the crayﬁsh consumed by lepomis were less then 17 mm carapace length (cl), whereas rock bass consumed a wide range of crayﬁsh sizes (8–62 mm cl). the timing of crayﬁsh consumption differed for lepomis and rock bass. the majority of crayﬁsh consumption by lepomis occurred from late june to early july (fig. 3). in contrast, rock bass consumed crayﬁsh over the entire summer without exhibiting a pulse of predation in the early summer (fig. 3). whole-lake predation on crayﬁsh per-ﬁsh consumption of crayﬁsh biomass was greater for rock bass in all four lakes (table 1), but individual lepomis consumed greater numbers of crayﬁsh on average than rock bass (table 1). for lepomis, per- ﬁsh consumption of crayﬁsh biomass was highest in trout lake followed by wild rice, big and arrow- head lakes (table 1). for rock bass, average con- sumption was greatest in big lake followed by wild rice, trout and arrowhead lakes. at the population level, lepomis consumed a greater biomass of crayﬁsh in all lakes except big lake. lepomis populations consumed 22 · , 14 · , 8 · and 120 · more indi- vidual crayﬁsh than rock bass populations in arrow- head, big, trout and wild rice lakes, respectively (table 1). bioenergetics model simulations indicate that lep- omis consumed more than 300% of the estimated crayﬁsh population in arrowhead lake, and 23% of the estimated crayﬁsh population in wild rice lake h s i f y a r c f o r e b m u n 50 40 30 20 10 0 2 8 lepomis rock bass 20 26 14 50 crayfish carapace length (mm) 38 32 44 56 62 fig. 2. frequency distribution of crayﬁsh carapace lengths con- sumed by lepomis (open bars) and rock bass (grey bars). 138 (fig. 4). in contrast, we estimate that lepomis only consumed 1% and 5% of the crayﬁsh population in trout and big lakes, respectively. the predatory impact of rock bass was substantially lower than lepomis in all lakes. rock bass consumed 13% and 0.16% of the crayﬁsh population in arrowhead and wild rice lakes, respectively, and 0.02% and 0.03% in trout and big lakes, respectively. discussion our comparison of lepomis predation with rock bass predation highlights the uniqueness of lepomis as crayﬁsh predators. the predatory impact of lepomis on rusty crayﬁsh differs from more traditional crayﬁsh predators for three reasons: (i) lepomis exclusively consumed juvenile crayﬁsh that are less vulnerable to other crayﬁsh predators, (ii) lepomis consumption is concentrated over a short time period when juvenile crayﬁsh are vulnerable and (ii) lepomis can achieve a much greater abundance than other crayﬁsh predators. based on these traits, consumption estimates from bioenergetics simulations revealed that dense popula- tions of lepomis consumed a large percentage of the juvenile crayﬁsh population in two of our study lakes. while lepomis are only one of the many predators of rusty crayﬁsh, their unique traits as crayﬁsh predators likely makes them an important component in the invasion dynamics of rusty crayﬁsh. lepomis generally consumed smaller crayﬁsh than rock bass. whereas rock bass consumed a range of crayﬁsh sizes with the majority greater than 17 mm, lepomis consumed only juvenile crayﬁsh. as evi- denced by this study and others (stein 1977; probst et al. 1984; roell & orth 1993), crayﬁsh smaller than 14 mm cl are less vulnerable to rock bass and other more traditional crayﬁsh predators such as smallmouth bass. the majority of lepomis predation on juvenile crayﬁsh occurred over a brief period following the release of juveniles from berried females. in contrast, rock bass consumed crayﬁsh over the entire summer. in total, 93% of crayﬁsh consumption by lepomis occurred between june 15 and 15 july, whereas, 61% of crayﬁsh consumption by rock bass occurred during this time period. intense predation on juveniles over a short time window may have larger effects on prey populations than consuming mature adults over an extended period (claessen et al. 2000;

(2007) suggest that intense predation on crayﬁsh could maintain an ecosystem dominated by macrophytes that support lepomis production, in turn maintain crayﬁsh at low abundances. however, further research is needed to assess thresholds of predator and crayﬁsh that abundances that could lead to crayﬁsh control versus population expansion, particularly during the initial stages of a rusty crayﬁsh invasion. lepomis and rock bass differed with respect to the biomass and numbers of crayﬁsh consumed. while individual rock bass consumed more crayﬁsh biomass on average, lepomis populations consumed several times more crayﬁsh than rock bass populations in all four study lakes. abundant populations of lepomis and consumption of small crayﬁsh revealed high predatory impact by lepomis in two of our study lakes that had low crayﬁsh densities. lepomis population estimates on arrowhead and wild rice lakes were 17 and 20 times greater than rock bass population estimates. quantifying both the predator and prey 139 tetzlaff et al. d e m u s n o c n o i t l a u p o p f o t n e c r e p 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 lepomis rock bass arrowhead wild rice big trout fig. 4. percent of the crayﬁsh population consumed by lepomis (open bars) and rock bass (grey bars) populations. upper error bars represent consumption estimate using upper 95% ci for ﬁsh population estimate and lower 95% ci for crayﬁsh population. lower error bars represent consumption estimate using lower 95% ci for ﬁsh populations and upper 95% ci for crayﬁsh population. abundance allowed for a more accurate view of predation impact at the whole-lake scale (stewart et al. 1981; mittelbach et al. 1995). in particular, quantifying the abundance of juvenile crayﬁsh and including juvenile crayﬁsh in predation estimates highlighted the uniqueness of lepomis as crayﬁsh predators. bioenergetics models predicted that lepomis con- sumption exceeded our crayﬁsh population estimate in arrowhead lake. even when we contrasted lower 95% estimates of lepomis populations with upper 95% estimates of crayﬁsh abundance, we found that estimates of crayﬁsh consumption by lepomis ex- ceeded abundance estimates of crayﬁsh in arrowhead lake. this incongruence likely occurred for two reasons: (i) crayﬁsh abundance was underestimated and (ii) predation on juvenile crayﬁsh occurred prior to our crayﬁsh population surveys. crayﬁsh abundance was estimated by multiplying the mean crayﬁsh density (adults and juveniles) by the total area of the littoral zone covered by cobble. while cobble habitat is the preferred substrate for rusty crayﬁsh, crayﬁsh do occur in alternative habitats (lorman 1980; kershner & lodge 1995). preference for cobble habitats is strongest juvenile crayﬁsh and decreases as crayﬁsh become less vulnerable to predation (stein & magnusson 1976). thus, our bias in population estimates was likely greater for the adult crayﬁsh population than the juvenile population. the magni- tude of the bias in our abundance estimates is dependent on the distribution of rusty crayﬁsh across habitat types in each lake and composition of different habitats in each lake. garvey et al. (2003) found rusty for 140 crayﬁsh densities to be almost 50 times higher in cobble compared to macrophyte habitats, however, kershner & lodge (1995) found adult rusty crayﬁsh densities to be only two to three times higher in cobble compared to macrophyte habitats. if we assume that crayﬁsh were distributed similarly across habitat types in each lake, our bias in population abundance would be greatest in arrowhead lake, followed by big, wild rice and trout lakes based upon the proportion of cobble and macrophyte habitats present in each lake. another plausible explanation for why our estimates of consumption exceeded our crayﬁsh abundance estimate in arrowhead lake is that signiﬁcant preda- tion likely took place immediately following juvenile release and prior to our crayﬁsh population surveys. this point is evidenced by our observation that lepomis predation on juvenile crayﬁsh occurred prior to our crayﬁsh population surveys in three of the four study lakes. while our absolute estimates of predatory impact are likely inﬂated due to underestimation of crayﬁsh abundance, relative estimates of predatory impact between lepomis and rock bass remain unbi- ased. relative estimates of predatory impact show that lepomis consumed far greater numbers of crayﬁsh compared to rock bass in all of our study lakes and therefore account for a substantially higher percentage of juvenile crayﬁsh mortality. low macrophytes) cobble habitat offers refuge from ﬁsh predators for crayﬁsh and is known to be a preferred habitat (stein & magnusson 1976; lorman 1980). previous studies have concluded that cobble habitat is a good predictor of maximum rusty crayﬁsh abundance (lodge & hill 1994). lakes with less than 15–20% of the littoral zone occupied by cobble habitat tend to support only low crayﬁsh populations, while lakes above this threshold tend to support much higher crayﬁsh abundances (lodge & hill 1994; garvey et al. 2003). given the composition of habitats in arrowhead lake (low cobble, high macrophytes) and trout lake (high cobble, the crayﬁsh abundance estimates in these lakes follow predictions relating crayﬁsh and cobble. alterna- tively, big lake and wild rice lake both contained abundant cobble and macrophyte habitats but exhib- ited drastically different crayﬁsh densities. despite having the greatest proportion of littoral zone occu- pied by cobble habitat, wild rice lake maintained low densities of rusty crayﬁsh. our study indicates that abundant lepomis populations had a strong negative effect on juvenile crayﬁsh abundance even where optimum crayﬁsh habitat occurs over much of the shoreline. while cobble availability may establish the potential for high crayﬁsh abundance, our results intense predation on juveniles by indicate that lepomis may prevent crayﬁsh populations from attaining this potential. management implications recently, attempts to mitigate impacts of rusty crayﬁsh by using a combination intensive trapping and increased ﬁsh predation through regulatory management efforts have succeeded in reducing the abundance of adult rusty crayﬁsh in sparkling lake, vilas county, wisconsin (hein et al. 2006, 2007). however, the long-term success of similar management efforts depends on the ability of ﬁsh predators to maintain low crayﬁsh abundances (carpenter 2003). traps are successful at removing a large proportion of the adult population but are ineffective at catching juvenile crayﬁsh (olsen et al. 1991). hein et al. (2006) focused on enhancing ﬁsh predators that consume a wide range of crayﬁsh sizes (smallmouth bass and rock bass), but their study lake contained relatively low populations of lepomis. in the presence of ﬁshes that are not effective predators on juvenile crayﬁsh, the role of lepomis may be a critical agent to successfully constrain the negative impacts of rusty crayﬁsh invasions. under the intensive harvest conditions described in hein et al. (2006), an increase in lepomis abundance would increase the predation pressure on juvenile crayﬁsh, which in turn could cause the depensatory response in the crayﬁsh population necessary to maintain the population at low abundance (walters & kitchell 2001). conclusions our study identiﬁed unique predators that potentially play a large role in the invasion dynamics of rusty crayﬁsh. we demonstrated the ability of lepomis to consume large numbers of juvenile crayﬁsh over a short temporal period. traditional crayﬁsh predators (e.g., bass and perch) may not constrain the growth of rusty crayﬁsh populations because adult crayﬁsh have an effective size refuge and juvenile crayﬁsh are relatively invulnerable (stein 1977). in lakes where bluegill and pumpkinseed are abundant, predation on juvenile crayﬁsh is intense and has the potential limit growth of the crayﬁsh population. given the strong contrast in crayﬁsh populations and our evidence of lepomis effects, this idea deserves special attention and could serve as the goal for large-scale, whole-system tests. in particular, future investigations should attempt to iden- tify potential thresholds of lepomis abundance that could maintain rusty crayﬁsh at low abundance. understanding nonnative rusty crayﬁsh and native predator dynamics can aid resource managers in limiting the spread and establishment of this nuisance species. acknowledgements we would like to thank john marino, catherine hein, gretchen andersen, patrick hermann, greg sass and laura kessler for native ﬁsh predation on invasive crayﬁsh
