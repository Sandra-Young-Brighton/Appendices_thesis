however, among sea-migrating populations within the river vindela¨lven drainage, this pattern was observed. this study illustrates that life-history and landscape features help to explain genetic structure and genetic variation. the information is important for conservation and management actions, such as ﬁsheries regulations, habitat restorations, stocking of hatchery ﬁsh, deﬁning management units and introducing genetic monitoring programmes. key words: microsatellite; population structure; sea_trout; landscape genetics; classiﬁcation and regression tree introduction life histories may affect the evolutionary change within a species through mechanisms connected to, e.g., migration patterns, longevity and reproductive strategies (allendorf & luikart 2007). the inﬂuence of life-history tactics on genetic structure and diversity should therefore be of considerable interest for conservation and management of a species. including within-species variation in life history in a landscape genetic study may give valuable new insights. land- scape genetics attempts to understand how speciﬁc landscape features affects population genetic structure through processes such as gene ﬂow, genetic drift and selection (sork & waits 2010). in freshwater ﬁsh, the importance of geomorphology, geographical distance and connectivity on the spatial distribution of genetic life-history tactics. accordingly, variation is obvious, but landscape characteristics also affect landscape features may have an additional contribution to population genetics by also affecting life history. brown_trout (salmo_trutta l.) has a highly variable life history (ferguson 1989; elliott 1994; jonsson & jonsson 2006). stream-resident populations that spend their entire life in running water are common throughout the species range (elliott 1994). brown_trout also reproduce in streams where juveniles spend one to several years before they undergo feeding migrations to a lake (lake-dwelling) or the sea (sea_trout), where they reach maturity after one or several years (jonsson 1985; klemetsen et al. 2003). this migratory morph return as adults or ‘home’ to their natal stream for spawning (stuart 1957). anadromous and resident morphs may coexist and interbreed correspondence: j. o¨ stergren, swedish university of agricultural sciences, se-901 83 umea˚, sweden. e-mail: johan.ostergren@nrm.se doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00529.x 119 o¨ stergren & nilsson (pettersson et al. 2001; jonsson & jonsson 2006). on a river catchment scale, lake-dwelling, stream-resident and sea-migrating populations may be represented (jonsson 1985; klemetsen et al. 2003). thus, several ecologically distinct populations with a huge variety of life-history tactics can be found in one river system or drainage area. such systems provide special opportu- nity to investigate the relative inﬂuence of life-history and landscape characteristics on genetic diversity and genetic structure of brown_trout. owing to the occurrence of homing and isolation of populations by landscape features, e.g., migration barriers, brown_trout populations often show high genetic differentiation (ryman 1983; ferguson 1989; laikre et al. 1999; carlsson & nilsson 2001). among stream-resident brown_trout, genetic differentiation can be high within short geographical distances, i.e., few kilometres, in streams with (carlsson & nilsson 2001) or without migration barriers (carlsson et al. 1999), whereas sea_trout may show low genetic differentiation between populations (moran et al. 1995; hansen & mensberg 1998). consequently, overall isolation by distance has rarely been reported among resident brown_trout (estoup et al. 1998), while isolation by distance has been noted among sea_trout populations (hansen & mensberg 1998; samuiloviene et al. 2009). also, resident trout appear to be more genetically differentiated and to have less genetic diversity compared to sea-migrating trout populations (hindar et al. 1991; moran et al. 1995; hansen & mensberg 1998; antunes et al. 2006). milner et al. (2006) underscored the importance of gaining a better understanding of genetic and ecologic stock structure, spawning distribution and population dispersal on the catchment scale, for the management and conservation of sea_trout. in the gulf of bothnia, concern has been raised regarding negative effects of ﬁsheries, habitat degradation, and water ﬂow regula- tions on wild sea_trout stocks (ices 2006; jutila et al. 2006; lundqvist et al. 2006). this study has two main objectives. first, we analyse genetic diversity and genetic structure of lake- dwelling, stream-resident and sea-migrating brown_trout in two large river systems, the rivers vindela¨lven and pitea¨lven, entering the gulf of bothnia. secondly, we investigate the relative inﬂuence of life-history and landscape characteristics on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of brown_trout in these river systems. in addition to bayesian clustering methods, f-statistics and multidimensional scaling analysis, we use classiﬁcation and regression tree (cart) analysis (breiman et al. 1984). cart analyses are simple yet powerful tools for analysing complex ecological data (de’ath & fabricius 2000; kolar & lodge 2002) and are suitable for analysis including landscape and genetic information (torres et al. 2003; spens et al. 120 2007). cart explains variation of a response variable by successively splitting data in homogenous groups, using one or more explanatory variable. explanatory as well as response variables can be both nominal and continuous parameters. by integrating landscape genetics and life history, valuable insights into demo- graphic processes can be gained, important for con- servation and anadromous brown_trout. and management resident of speciﬁcally, the aim of this study was to investigate the following questions: (i) what is the overall genetic structure and genetic diversity of brown_trout with three life-history tactics (lake-dwelling, stream-resi- dent and sea-migrating) in the two river systems vindela¨lven and pitea¨lven?, (ii) are life-history and landscape features important for genetic differentiation and genetic diversity? and (iii) how can the ﬁndings be implemented in conservation and management of brown_trout of various life histories? materials and methods study areas the river vindela¨lven, the largest tributary of the river umea¨lven, and the river pitea¨lven originate from the scandinavian mountains, approximately 450 km from the coast, and enter the gulf of bothnia at around 63–65°n 20–21°e (figs 1 and 2). both rivers have a hydropower complex including dam with ﬁsh ladder in the lower reaches: in the r. umea¨lven, approximately 32 km (stornorrfors; fig. 1), and in r. pitea¨lven (sikfors; fig. 2), approximately 40 km from the coast, respectively. in the river umea¨lven, ﬁsh upstream migration is blocked by dams upstream of the conﬂuence with r. vindela¨lven. the rivers vindela¨lven and pitea¨lven have several tributaries with suitable spawning and rearing brown_trout habitat (figs 1 and 2). historically, the rivers were impacted by log ﬂoating (nilsson et al. 2005), and many side channels and tributaries were blocked. fish migration into the r. vindela¨lven was hindered by a hydropower dam at umea¨lven between 1925 and 1935 (monte´n 1985), and few sea_trout could enter the river for spawning during this 10-year period. the catchment in r. vindela¨lven and areas 10,800 km2 in r. pitea¨lven. are 12,600 km2 spawning run and stocking of sea-migrating brown_trout the average numbers of annual returns of sea_trout have been 50 (sd ± 34) in the period 1974–2004 in r. vindela¨lven and 98 (sd ± 50) in 1992–2004 in r. pitea¨lven (data from vattenfall ab, sweden). as mitigation of loss of habitat because of hydropower production, large-scale stockings (in total approxi- landscape genetics of brown_trout vindelälven ammarnäs giertsbäcken laisälven gargån krokforsen matjokkbäcken rågobäcken the river vindela¨lven fig. 1. map of drainage showing tributaries and sample locations of resident (black circles) and sea- migrating (black stars) populations indicated with names as in table 1. the small overview map indicates the location of r. vindela¨lven as a thick black line. renforsen krycklan umeälven 0 30 60 km stornorrfors power station umeå piteälven sikån varjisån hundforsen stockforsälven storforsen fig. 2. map of the river pitea¨lven drainage showing tributaries and sample locations of resident (black circles) and sea-migrating (black stars) populations indicated with names as in table 1. the small overview map indicates the location of r. pitea¨lven as a thick black line. 030 km15 0 15 30 km sikfors power station piteå mately 1 million 1-year-old individuals) of hatchery- reared sea_trout have been conducted in the r. vindela¨lven from 1936 to 1999. of these, 90% were released in the main stem and 10% in tributaries. forty-ﬁve per cent (n = 436,000) of stocked juveniles were released in the area at the renforsen (fig. 1). 121 o¨ stergren & nilsson table 1. details of samples collected in the rivers umea¨lven, vindela¨lven and pitea¨lven. column abbreviations: sample name;

(1993) (n = 1) or categorised as resident (n = 2) because no documented historical (andersson 1988) or present (o¨ stergren et al. 2011) appearance of tagged sea_trout exists. sea-migrating adults were sampled from indi- viduals directly arriving from the sea (n = 3). popu- lations categorised as sea-migrating and sampled from juveniles had documented presence of tagged sea_trout (andersson 1988, o¨ stergren et al. 2011), (n = 8) except for krycklan. adults were sampled when passing upstream ﬁsh ladders in r. umea¨lven and r. pitea¨lven, respectively, and categorised as ‘sea-migrating’ samples umea¨lven a & b, and pitea¨lven (table 1). adults were also sampled during rod ﬁshing on the lake-dwelling trout from locations in the main stem of r. vindela¨lven, upstream of the lake storvindeln, downstream of ammarna¨s village (fig. 1). juvenile samples were collected by electroﬁshing at the rapids krokforsen and renforsen in the main stem of r. vindela¨lven and from tributaries to r. vindela¨lven, giertsba¨cken, laisa¨lven, gargån, matjokkba¨cken, rågoba¨cken (two locations from up- and downstream of a deﬁnite migration barrier) and krycklan (fig. 1), and categor- ised accordingly (table 1). juveniles were also col- lected in the r. pitea¨lven drainage at the rapid hundforsen in the main stem upstream of the rapid storforsen, a deﬁnite migration barrier, and from tributaries to r. pitea¨lven, stockforsa¨lven and var- jisån, and the tributary to varjisån, sikån (fig. 2), and categorised accordingly (table 1). all samples con- sisted of tissue collected from ﬁn clips (normally adipose ﬁn). the samples were stored in individually labelled tubes with ethanol (95%) from sampling event to dna extraction. to avoid sampling of recently stocked sea_trout in the r. pitea¨lven drainage, sampling locations were positioned upstream of known stocking locations, because hatchery-released juveniles tend to drift downstream after release (palm et al. 2009). all captured ﬁsh were anesthetised (benzocaine) and measured for length at sampling. based on length-based gaussian mixture analysis (not shown), it was concluded that all samples likely consisted of at least 3 year-classes. total genetic analyses dna was extracted from tissue samples according to laird et al. (1991). eight microsatellite loci were utilised in the study. microsatellite ampliﬁcation was performed using a multiplex pcr with str60, str73, str15 (estoup et al. 1993), ssosl417 (slettan et al. 1995) and ssa85 (o¢reilly et al. 1996), while ssosl438 (slettan et al. 1996), ssa197 and ssa171 (o¢reilly et al. 1996) were ampliﬁed separately. pcr for all loci were conducted with the following programme: 95 °c for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 °c, 30 s at 58 °c and 30 s at 72 °c, ending with 5 min at 72 °c. the pcr product of a total volume of 2.5 ll for each sample was mixed with sls and 400- bp size ladder and analysed in a beckman coulter 8000 sequencer according to recommendations by the manufacturer (http://www.beckmancoulter.com). all samples were analysed and interpreted by the authors. statistical analyses estimations of the number of alleles and calculations of observed (ho) and expected (he) heterozygosity were performed using popgene 1.31 (http://www.ualberta. ca/~fyeh). estimations of global and pairwise fst (weir & cockerham 1984), allelic richness ar and tests for genetic differentiation between pairs of samples were examined with fstat 2.9.3.2 (goudet 2001). in addi- tion, this programme calculated the 95% conﬁdence intervals by bootstrapping over loci (3060 permuta- tions). genetic differentiation between pairs of samples measured by dest (jost 2008) was also performed using the demetics package in r (http://www.r-project.org). the dest is the bias-corrected estimator of d, which is a measurement of genetic differentiation based on the effective number of alleles and is argued to give a more meaningful perception of differentiation than, e.g., gst (gerlach et al. 2010). genepop 4.0.10 (raymond & rousset 1995) was utilised for exact tests of deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium, and also for inves- tigating linkage equilibrium and null allele frequencies. landscape genetics of brown_trout all tests included bonferroni corrections (rice 1989). to investigate whether the populations had undergone recent population size reductions, bottleneck 1.2.02 (cornuet & luikart 1996) was used. to check that samples were not dominated by full-sib families, the software colony 2.0 (wang 2004, 2009) was used. the model used evaluated the amount of full-sib families in all samples assuming polygamous reproduction among both males and females, because both sexes are polygamous in salmonids (elliott 1994; fleming 1996). additionally, genepop 4.0.10 was used for a mantel test (mantel 1967) of the regression of fst ⁄ (1)fst) on geographical distance among sea-migrating samples in the r. vindela¨lven drainage. this relationship was also examined by linear regression analysis in r. spatial autocorrelation (sa) was performed with genalex 6.4 visual basic application within microsoft software excel (peakall & smouse 2006). sa is a multivariate approach simultaneously analysing spatial signals generated by multiple genetic loci. the geographical distances used for the mantel test and sa were the nearest waterway distance (nearest 100 m) between locations of each sample ⁄ individual pairs. when analysing sa for samples, the same geographical position was used for all individuals belonging to the same sample. the sa calculates an autocorrelation coefﬁcient, r, which is closely related to moran’s i and generates ‘a measure of genetic similarity between pairs of individuals whose geographical separation falls within the speciﬁed distance class’ (peakall & smouse 2005). in the sa analyses, individual pairs were divided into distance classes consisting of even size classes following recommendations in peakall et al. (2003) and peakall & smouse (2005). in the correlo- gram, r is plotted as a function of distance class with 95% conﬁdence intervals (ci) of the null hypothesis of no spatial genetic structure as determined by 999 permutations and ci of r over 1000 bootstraps. hierarchical analyses (amova) of genetic diversity were performed using genalex 6.4. three hierarchical levels were used: (i) region, (ii) samples within regions and (iii) individuals within samples. two analyses were performed, with region deﬁned as watersheds (r. vindela¨lven and r. pitea¨lven) and migration tactic (resident and sea-migrating). a principle component analysis (pca) was conducted using genalex 6.4 and was based on nei’s genetic distance, da, matrix. a dendrogram (neighbour joining) (nei et al. 1983) was conducted with the program populations 1.2.28 (langella 1999). bayesian cluster analyses were con- ducted with baps 5.4 version (corander et al. 2008). this method uses a stochastic optimisation algorithm approach ﬁnding the posterior mode of the genetic structure. the analysis was performed with selected maximum amount of clusters k = 15–40 with intervals of k = 5. the analysis was repeated 10 times, and the 123 o¨ stergren & nilsson table 2. data included in the cart analysis. column abbreviations: life history, deﬁned resident or sea-migrating life-history tactic. habitat and landscape parameters: river, r. vindela¨lven (v) or r. pitea¨lven (p);

spens et al. 2007), than linear models (de’ath & fabricius 2000; garcia-magarinos et al. 2009). four cart analyses with he, ar, fst and dest, respectively, as continuous response variables were performed. the fst and dest values used were the average pairwise values of all population pairs. in these analyses, one life-history and six landscape characteristics explanatory variables (table 2): life history (resident ⁄ sea-migrating), river (vindela¨lven ⁄ pitea¨lven), tributary (yes ⁄ no), migration barrier (present ⁄ absent), distance from sea (kilome- tres), altitude [metres above sea level (m.a.s.l.)] and stream width (metres) (table 2). the distance from sea function as 124 was the closest waterway distance from the river mouth to sample location. stream width was measured on aerial photographs as the full-wetted width (aver- age of 10 transects at sampling location). the four cart analyses were repeated ignoring the life history explanatory variable. in addition, one classiﬁcation tree analysis with life-history tactic as categorical response variable was performed. in this analysis, all habitat ⁄ landscape characteristics mentioned and he, ar, fst and dest were included as explanatory variables. here, the speciﬁc objective was to investi- gate which of the explanatory variables best predicted the life-history tactic of brown_trout in our data. the cart analyses were performed using default values for tree models (crawley 2007) in r (http:// www.r-project.org). results sample characteristics data from a total of 721 brown_trout individuals from 18 sample sites were obtained (table 1). over all loci, signiﬁcant deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium at the 0.05 level were found in six out of the 18 samples. three of these, umea¨lven a, laisa¨lven a and renforsen, remained signiﬁcant after bonferroni corrections (using p = 0.05 ⁄ 8 = 0.00625 as cut-off for signiﬁcance) (table 1). of 144 locus– sample combinations, only eight indicated signiﬁcant deviations from hardy–weinberg equilibrium after bonferroni corrections. the sample renforsen showed r a t s f 0 5 . 0 4 . . 0 3 . 0 2 0 . 5 1 0 0 . 0 1 0 . resident sea migrating e h t s e d 5 6 0 . 5 5 0 . 5 4 0 . 5 3 0 . 5 2 0 . 5 1 0 . resident sea migrating fig. 3. a comparison of genetic diversity and genetic divergence between resident and sea-migrating populations of brown_trout. boxplots show median values (horizontal line), and the bottom and top of the box show the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. outliers are indicated by circles. the vertical dashed lines show the maximum value in absence of outliers or 1.5 times the interquartile range of the data, roughly 2 standard deviations, in the presence of outliers. ar, allelic richness;

he t = 4.03, d.f. = 5.57, p = 0.008; fig. 3). total number of alleles and allelic richness was highest (n = 56; ar = 5.37) for sea-migrating trout in the umea¨lven b sample and lowest (n = 22; ar = 2.67) for resident brown_trout upstream a migration barrier in the vindela¨lven tributary rågoba¨cken above (table 1). average he varied from 0.44 in resident in rågoba¨cken above to 0.71 in sea-migrating trout in sample pitea¨lven (table 1). trout the overall genetic structure a total global fst of 0.10 and dest of 0.15 indicated a high genetic differentiation among samples. for all but four pairs, genetic differentiation (fst) between sam- ples was signiﬁcant after bonferroni corrections (table 3). pairs with nonsigniﬁcant differentiation were samples of sea-migrating trout in umea¨lven a and b, rågoba¨cken below and matjokkba¨cken, ume- a¨lven b and rågoba¨cken below, and umea¨lven b and renforsen. pairwise comparison of genetic differenti- ation (table 3) revealed interesting details. between samples of sea-migrating individuals pitea¨lven and umea¨lven b, pairwise genetic differentiation was low (fst = 0.020 and dest = 0.067). the differentiation between the lake-dwelling population ammarna¨s and two other samples from tributaries to the same lake was high with fst = 0.095 and dest = 0.228 between ammarna¨s and laisa¨lven b, and fst = 0.190 and dest = 0.388 between ammarna¨s and giertsba¨cken. the tributary to r. pitea¨lven, sikån, showed a relative high differentiation between both the sample varjisån (fst = 0.066 and dest = 0.154) and the pitea¨lven sample (fst = 0.068 and dest = 0.140). when com- paring groups of the two life-history tactics, there were signiﬁcant differences in average pairwise genetic differentiation for both fst and dest (welch t-test: fst t = )4.63, d.f. = 5.89, p = 0.0037; dest t = )6.10, d.f. = 8.06, p = 0.0003; fig. 3). the pca based on a nei’s genetic distance (da) matrix (fig. 4) and the dendrogram (fig. s1, support- ing information) illustrate two-dimensional relation- ships among all samples. the pca illustrate that samples of sea-migrating brown_trout were grouping towards the centre, whereas resident populations were randomly distributed in the margin of the pca plot (fig. 4). in the dendrogram, samples of resident trout were individually separated. sea-migrating popula- tions were grouping together and, at least partly, by river drainage. overall, bootstrap support was weak for all population divisions, in particular the main 125 o¨ stergren & nilsson 8 9 1 0 . 1 9 1 0 . 3 1 2 0 . 3 6 1 0 . 0 7 3 0 . 2 1 3 0 . 5 3 2 0 . 1 4 4 . 0 3 8 1 . 0 2 6 1 0 . 2 1 4 . 0 0 5 1 0 . 2 1 2 0 . 5 1 1 . 0 0 8 1 0 . 3 4 2 0 . 8 5 1 0 . 9 3 1 0 . 9 3 1 0 . 3 9 1 0 . 9 0 2 0 . 1 8 2 0 . 0 9 2 0 . 1 9 1 0 . 8 4 2 0 . 4 1 1 . 0 3 0 1 0 . 2 3 3 0 . 1 7 1 . 0 2 0 1 0 . 8 4 0 0 . 4 5 1 0 . 7 1 2 0 . – – 4 6 0 . 0 6 3 2 0 . 5 9 1 0 . 8 9 1 . 0 4 2 0 . 8 3 2 . 0 9 6 3 0 . 1 9 1 0 . 0 7 3 0 . 7 6 2 0 . 6 7 1 . 0 5 0 4 0 . 1 5 2 0 . 8 1 2 . 0 6 2 1 0 . 8 0 3 0 . 1 3 1 . 0 9 5 1 0 . – 3 8 1 . 0 7 9 1 . 0 9 2 2 0 . 4 1 2 0 . 0 8 2 0 . 5 2 3 . 0 4 4 3 . 0 3 4 3 . 0 9 4 2 0 . 6 2 2 0 . 8 3 4 0 . 8 3 2 0 . 2 5 1 0 . 0 4 1 . 0 7 8 1 0 . 6 6 0 0 . 7 0 1 0 . –  2 d r o o c pca gargån sikån ammarnäs krycklan giertsbäcken laisälvena laisälvenb hundforsen umeälven a renforsen varjisån umeälven b piteälven matjokkbäcken rågobäckenbelow krokforsen stockforsälven coord 1 rågobäckenabove fig. 4. a principle component analysis based on a nei’s genetic distance (da) matrix, illustrating two-dimensional structures of all samples in pitea¨lven (squares) and vindela¨lven (circles). different life-history tactics were indicated by ﬁlled (sea-migrating) and open (resident) symbols. sample names are indicated as in table 1. branches separating samples on the river drainage level, indicating a weak structuring among all samples (fig. s1, supporting information). clustering analysis analysis of 721 individuals using baps 5.4 identiﬁed 32 clusters of which 26 included more than ﬁve individuals (table s1, supporting information). eight of these clusters corresponded with 85–100% to a sample location. these were resident samples am- marna¨s, giertsba¨cken, gargån (three clusters), rågoba¨cken above and hundforsen, and sea-migrat- ing sample sikån. the other clusters included individ- uals from a mix of several samples, and six clusters contained individuals representing more than half (n > 9) of the samples (table s1, supporting infor- mation). in summary, the baps 5.4 was able to identify and separate resident populations well, while sea- migrating populations were spread over several clus- ters. the distribution of individuals in resident samples was also more concentrated with 43–95% in a single cluster (table s1, supporting information). this was also illustrated by summarising the number of clusters in which each sample was represented. this differed signiﬁcantly between resident and sea-migrating pop- ulations d.f. = 14.6, p < 0.001), with an average representation in ﬁve and 12 clusters for the two life-history tactics, respectively. t = 4.91, (welch t-test: the hierarchical analysis revealed that variation in the total material was explained with 1%, at the ﬁrst n e v a¨ l n a˚ s i j r a v e v o b a n a˚ k s i l n e v a¨ e t i p n e s r o f n e r w o e b l e v o b a n e k c a¨ b l n a k c y r k n a˚ g r a g n e s r o f k o r k n e k c a¨ b s a¨ n r a m m a b a b s r o f k c o t s n e s r o f d n u h n e k c a¨ b o g a˚ r n e k c a¨ b o g a˚ r k k o j t a m s t r e g i l n e v a¨ s a l i n e v l i a¨ s a l l n e v a¨ e m u n e v l a¨ e m u e v i t a c d n i i r e t f a , t x e t l d o b h t i w d e t a c d n i i , s r i a p e v ﬁ t u b l l a r o f t n e r e f f i d y l t n a c ﬁ n g s i i e r a t s f r o f s n o s i r a p m o c e s w i - r i a p l l a l . s e p m a s l l a n e e w t e b , l a n o g a d i e v o b a ) 8 0 0 2 t s o j ( t s e d d n a , l a n o g a d i w o e b l t s f e s w i - r i a p . 3 l e b a t . ) 7 2 3 0 0 0 . 0 < p ;

shrimpton & heath 2003). sea-migrating populations have potentially larger population sizes because of larger river habitats and feeding areas at sea. there were no clear signs of the populations; thus, severe reductions in ne could not explain the difference in genetic diversity between and sea-migrating populations. founder resident effects, i.e., populations originating from a few individuals, might also be an explanation of lower genetic diversity; however, we lack information on the colonisation of trout in these systems. recent bottlenecks in any of to lake storvindeln, the observed difference in inter-population genetic divergence may be explained by a lower gene ﬂow among resident than among sea-migrating populations. in this study, some resident samples were obtained from above migration barriers, allowing for an increased genetic divergence owing to genetic isola- tion (drift). gene ﬂow could also be restricted as a result of a very accurate homing. we noted a high genetic differentiation among all populations in three tributaries suggesting high reproduction site ﬁdelity (accurate homing) of lake- dwelling, resident and sea-migrating trout spawning in these tributaries. a higher gene ﬂow among sea_trout is expected because of connectivity through the open sea environment. fish returning from the sea that reproduces in rivers other than the natal river, i.e., straying, will leading to increased genetic diversity in the receiving population and lower genetic divergence with the donor popula- tion. even though true straying rates among sea_trout populations in the gulf of bothnia are unknown, lundqvist et al. (2006) showed a signiﬁcant propor- tion of tagged sea_trout smolts released in r. umea¨lven being caught in neighbouring rivers, sug- gesting potentially high gene ﬂow among populations. for example, between sea-migrating samples from r. umea¨lven and r. pitea¨lven, pairwise differentiation was low, fst = 0.020 and dest = 0.067, over a geographical distance of approximately 300 km. this can be compared with the pairwise differentiation of fst = 0.174 and dest = 0.234 between samples from above and below a migration barrier approximately 5 km apart in the tributary rågoba¨cken. introduce novel alleles, in general, and over large geographical scales, resident brown_trout seem to have lower genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation compared to anadromous brown_trout (ferguson 1989; antunes et al. 2006). this pattern was also highlighted by tonteri et al. (2007) in atlantic salmon (salmo_salar l.) populations who compared freshwater-resident and anadromous from northern europe. populations salmon genetic structure this study reveals an overall as well as within-river genetic structure of brown_trout in the two drainage areas r. vindela¨lven and r. pitea¨lven. the structuring is similar to other studies of brown_trout genetic structure on similar geographical scales (hansen et al. 2002; lehtonen et al. 2009; massa-gallucci et al. 2010; samuiloviene et al. 2009). overall, the pca and dendrogram analyses illustrate that resident pop- ulations of brown_trout were genetically isolated. baps clustering analysis identiﬁed resident populations well, while sea-migrating populations were mainly sepa- rated into several mixed clusters, independent of river and tributary of origin. thus, many of the sea- migrating populations in the two drainage areas shared genes to a certain extent, while resident populations were more differentiated. one exception was the tributary to r. pitea¨lven, sikån, where a genetically well-differentiated subpopulation of sea_trout was identiﬁed, with a fst of 0.066 (dest = 0.154) to the neighbour tributary varjisån. this suggests a limited straying of sea-migrating trout from other populations into sikån. the reason for this limited straying is not clear. we are not aware of any historical event, e.g., colonisation or temporary barriers, which might explain the reduced gene ﬂow. however, this ﬁnding underlines the importance of evaluating the genetic structure of large river systems individually for management and conservation purposes. we noticed isolation by distance (ibd) among sea- migrating populations within the r. vindela¨lven, but not over all samples. this is congruent with other studies of sea_trout where ibd has been observed (moran et al. 1995; hansen & mensberg 1998; samuiloviene et al. 2009) and also the nonexistence of ibd among samples of resident brown_trout (ryman 1983; carlsson & nilsson 2001). spatial autocorrela- tion analysis in the present study further supported the correlation between genetic and geographical distance. the genetic correlation pattern was similar to a study of genetic structure in atlantic salmon sampled from tributaries to the river varzuga, north west russia (primmer et al. 2006). in trout, the spatial autocorre- lation indicated a limited gene ﬂow between locations separated with more than 177 km and the intercept of r with the x-axis was at 29 km. for the salmon in river varzuga, the comparable limit of gene ﬂow was found at >120 km, with r intercepting at 34 km. in our model rivers, stocking has been extensive. this could potentially have inﬂuenced the results of a weak genetic differentiation among sea-migrating landscape genetics of brown_trout samples. however, stocking was conducted almost exclusively in the main stem of r. vindela¨lven, so tributary populations would have remained unaffected. also, the differentiation between the two river systems was very weak, which could not be explained by stocking activities. furthermore, many studies show limited genetic introgression of stocked sea_trout (e.g., nilsson et al. 2008, ruzzante et al. 2004). in sum- mary, in this study, stocking have probably had little impact on the overall genetic structure, but one should be aware of inﬂuence of stocking activities. the potential inﬂuences of life-history and landscape features cart analysis illustrates that life-history tactic (resi- dent or sea-migrating) was the most important variable explaining genetic diversity and genetic divergence in brown_trout. also, among sea-migrating populations, the habitat feature ‘stream width’ could further explain genetic diversity and genetic divergence. as discussed earlier, life history with high habitat ﬁdelity in resident populations indicates genetic isolation, which allows for a genetic differentiation (drift) from other popula- tions over time. a small stream width explained lower genetic variation and higher genetic divergence. stream width can be used as an estimator for habitat size and reﬂects the effective population size and thus also suggest higher genetic drift at smaller habitat sizes (shrimpton & heath 2003). when ignoring the life- history character in the cart analysis, stream width and accessibility to sample site in terms of distance from the sea and altitude above sea level explained genetic variation and differentiation. thus, the same explanations as discussed previously may be relevant, namely that small ne and limited gene ﬂow explain the observed patterns. in our data, the cart analysis indicated that ar was the best predictor of life-history tactic. using ar as predictor, we could classify resident (ar < 4.50) and sea-migrating (ar > 4.50) populations with 100% accuracy, independent of eight other parameters including river, tributary, altitude, geographical dis- tance from sea, presence of a migration barrier, he, fst and dest. this suggests that allelic richness reﬂects genetic isolation and could potentially be used as an indicator of sea-migration tendency in brown_trout populations. our data set was limited to 18 popula- tions, and a larger data set with more populations would be needed to validate the cart models fully. given the large interest and number of genetic studies on brown_trout, it is surprisingly few that has included landscape genetics (antunes et al. 2006; launey et al. 2010), and we found no study on brown_trout using multivariate analysis integrating life-his- tory and landscape genetics. in atlantic salmon, va¨ha¨ 129 o¨ stergren & nilsson et al. (2007) included landscape genetics in a multiple regression analysis and reported that the life-history character multi-sea-winter (msw) females was the best predictor of genetic diversity and divergence. thus, congruent with our study, life history inﬂuenced genetic diversity and structure. they did, however, no attempt to predict this life-history character based on landscape and genetic characteristics. others have integrated life-history and landscape features and concluded that thermal regime, barriers and altitude were most important for genetic diver- gence and genetic structure in studies of atlantic salmon_trout (oncorhyncus clarkii) (neville et al. 2006) and brook charr (salvelinus_fontinalis) (castric et al. 2001). cutthroat (dionne et al. 2008), management and conservation here, we show that life-history tactic is important for genetic structure of brown_trout within river systems. this should be considered in management and conservation actions. the resident populations should be managed separately, while the management approach for sea-migrating populations is less clear. within the watershed vindela¨lven, the result from spatial autocorrelation analysis of sea-migrating trout indicated that individuals within the distance of approximately 29 km were more similar genetically than individuals separated at a longer distance. spatial autocorrelation has been suggested to be useful when deﬁning units of management and conservation in continuous populations (diniz & telles 2002) and that the distance of the ﬁrst intercept may be used to deﬁne distances between management units. a full under- standing of how to manage sea_trout in the gulf of bothnia requires additional studies, e.g., analysing genetic relationships among stocks of sea_trout and estimating straying rates between populations. our study is consistent with the body of research on population genetics of salmonids, suggesting that river-based management units in many cases may be questioned because of within-drainage genetic struc- ture (va¨ha¨ et al. 2008; dionne et al. 2009). for example, the genetically highly differentiated subpop- ulation of sea_trout in the tributary sikån should be managed separately. o¨ stergren et al. (2011) showed that this subpopulation entered the river system for spawning earlier in the season than sea_trout spawning in other parts of the river system. thus, this population is sensitive to early-season opening dates of ﬁshing in the r. pitea¨lven. a genetically adequate ﬁsheries management strategy has potential to both conserve diversity and sustain productivity in salmonid species with a multipopulation structure (hilborn et al. 2003). the hatchery and stocking practices in the studied rivers have not considered within-river genetic struc- 130 ture. the applied river-based management approach of using a ‘river-speciﬁc trout’ consisting of a mix of sea- migrating individuals to be spread over the whole river system can be seriously questioned. such stocking actions may lead to swamping, inbreeding depression, and loss of locally important adaptations, having the potential resilience to environmental or climate change (laikre et al. 2010). to lower conclusions life history, our ﬁndings are consistent with earlier studies show- ing that through genetic isolation and limited habitat size, has great inﬂuence on genetic structure of brown_trout. in addition, we show that life history is the most important parameter also when using landscape and habitat variables in the same analysis. connectivity to sea is important for gene ﬂow among sea_trout populations in the gulf of bothnia, but we also provide evidence of the existence of well-differentiated subpopulations of sea-migrating brown_trout. life history and within-river genetic structure of brown_trout should be considered in future management and conservation actions, such as ﬁsher- ies regulations, habitat restorations, stocking of hatch- ery ﬁsh, deﬁning management units, and introducing genetic monitoring programmes. acknowledgements we thank helena ko¨nigsson for support in the laboratory and the norrfors hatchery staff (vattenfall ab), and magnus marklund, robert stro¨m, daniel palm and tommy stenlund samples of brown_trout. vindela¨lvens ﬁskeråd and for pitea¨lvens ekonomiska fo¨rening are also thanked for great support. the study was ﬁnanced by the ministry of sustain- able development (lip), eu-funding mål 1, the national board of fisheries and the swedish environmental protection agency. further funding was received from go¨ran gustafsson stiftelse fo¨r natur och miljo¨ i lappland. references allendorf, f.w. & luikart, g. 2007. conservation and the genetics of populations. ma, usa: blackwell publishing, 642 pp. andersson, t. 1988. havso¨ring pm maj 1988, del 1. ha¨rno¨sand: fiskeristyrelsen utredningskontoret, 37 pp. antunes, a., faria, r., johnson, w.e., guyomard, r. & the long-term alexandrino, p. 2006. life on the edge: persistence and contrasting spatial genetic structure of distinct brown_trout life histories at their ecological limits. journal of heredity 97: 193–205. breiman, l., friedland, j.h., olshen, r.a. & stone, c.g. 1984. classiﬁcation and regression trees. belmont, ca, usa: wadsworth international group. carlsson, j. & nilsson, j. 2001. effects of geomorphological structures on genetic differentiation among brown_trout populations in a northern boreal river drainage. transactions of the american fisheries society 130: 36–45. carlsson, j., olse´n, k.h., nilsson, j., øverli, ø. & stabell, o.b. 1999. microsatellites reveal ﬁne-scale genetic structure in stream-living brown_trout. journal of fish biology 55: 1290– 1303. castric, v., bonney, f. & bernatchez, l. 2001. landscape structure and hierarchical genetic diversity in the brook charr, salvelinus_fontinalis. evolution 55: 1016–1028. corander, j., marttinen, p., sire´n, j. & tang, j. 2008. enhanced bayesian modelling in baps software for learning genetic structures of populations. bmc bioinformatics 9: 539. cornuet, j.m. & luikart, g. 1996. description and power analysis of two tests for detecting recent population bottle- necks from allele frequency data. genetics 144: 2001–2014. crawley, m.j. 2007. the r book. chichester: john wiley & sons ltd. de’ath, g. & fabricius, k.e. 2000. classiﬁcation and regres- sion trees: a powerful yet simple technique for ecological data analysis. ecology 81: 3178–3192. degerman, e., nyberg, p. & sers, b. 2001. havso¨ringens ekologi. finfo 2001:10. stockholm: national board of fisheries, pp. 1–122. diniz, j.a.f. & telles, m.p.d. 2002. spatial autocorrelation analysis and the identiﬁcation of operational units for conservation in continuous populations. conservation biol- ogy 16: 924–935. dionne, m., caron, f., dodson, j.j. & bernatchez, l. 2008. landscape genetics and hierarchical genetic structure in atlantic salmon: the interaction of gene ﬂow and local adaptation. molecular ecology 17: 2382–2396. dionne, m., caron, f., dodson, j.j. & bernatchez, l. 2009. comparative survey of within-river genetic structure in atlantic salmon;
