mitacs-accelerate internships abstract relating fish physiology, behaviour and experience to fitness- related outcomes at the individual scale is ecologically significant, but presents difficulties for free- ranging fishes in natural systems. physiological state (e.g. level of stress or maturity) and expe- rience (e.g. habitat use or exposure to stressors) may alter the probability of survival or reproduction. this study examined the relative influence of physiology and migratory experience on survival, migration duration, reproductive longevity, and egg retention in adult female sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka) from a fraser river population. one hundred and thirty- five females were plasma sampled and tagged with radio transmitters and archival temperature loggers. fish were tracked 55 km through two natal lakes to spawning grounds, following passage of a hydroelectric dam. for 39 fe- males, we assessed the proportion of time within an optimal temperature (toptas) win- dow (13.4–19.5°c), which provides ≥90% of maximum aerobic scope. females with lower plasma glucose concentrations were more likely to reach spawning grounds. early migrants spent longer in natal lakes. more time in the toptas window was associ- ated with greater reproductive longevity and lower probability of egg retention. later arriving females had reduced longevity on spawning grounds, as did females that re- tained eggs. exposure to higher dam discharge was associated with reduced reproduc- tive longevity and greater probability of egg retention, but not lower survival, indicating a delayed effect of dam passage. our results underscore the complexity of factors governing fitness- related outcomes for salmonids, particularly the importance of female experience in the days and weeks prior to spawning. k e y w o r d s aerobic scope, dam passage, delayed effects, spawning success, thermoregulation 1 |  introduction the success of a reproductive migration depends on interactions between the physiological state of an individual and the environ- mental conditions encountered (nathan et al., 2008). individuals that reach breeding grounds are possibly in better physiological condition, encounter more benign environments and (or) respond more effec- tively to migratory challenges than individuals that die en route. adult pacific salmon (oncorhynchus spp.) which return to natal sites with high fidelity have a single opportunity to reproduce before death, and unsuccessful migrants do not contribute genetically to the pop- ulation. thus, the energetic demands and historical environmen- tal conditions of the adult migration have shaped the morphology, physiology and behaviour of pacific salmon (hinch, cooke, healey, & farrell, 2006; hodgson & quinn, 2002). despite these responses, some populations in some years exhibit high levels of mortality en 296  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:296–309. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdminke- martin et al. route and on spawning grounds (e.g. >90%; keefer et al., 2010; hinch et al., 2012). exposure to high water temperature underlies or exacerbates many causes of migration mortality in pacific salmon. spawning mi- grations are fuelled exclusively by stored energy, most of which is consumed by standard metabolism, swimming activity and gonad mat- uration in years of typical migration conditions (brett, 1995). at high temperatures, energy reserves can become exhausted and fish perish en route (rand & hinch, 1998). cardiorespiratory system function is also temperature- limited. aerobic scope for activity—the difference between maximum and standard metabolic rates—is greatest at an optimal temperature (toptas; fry, 1947). standard metabolism con- sumes an increasing proportion of available oxygen as temperature in- creases, limiting capacity for other activities, including swimming and maturation. at a critical temperature (tcrit), aerobic scope is zero, and swimming activity is fuelled by anaerobic metabolism (pörtner, 2001). although anaerobic swimming is essential to the adult migration (e.g. for passing rapids), it is costly and cannot be sustained for long peri- ods of time (martin, nisbet, pike, michel, & danner, 2015). in environ- ments where high water temperatures and high flows coincide, such as some dam tailraces and fishways (keefer & caudill, 2015), reduced aerobic scope may impede migration. indeed, the collapse of aerobic scope is thought to be responsible for poor survival in some recent sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus_nerka) spawning migrations (farrell et al., 2008; keefer, peery, & heinrich, 2008). thermal refuges along the migration route, including cool water tributaries and the hypolimnion of lakes and reservoirs, allow pacific salmon to mitigate the negative effects of thermal stress and increase likelihood of survival to spawning grounds (keefer & caudill, 2015; mathes et al., 2010; newell & quinn, 2005). behavioural thermo- regulation may be particularly important for females, which allocate considerable energy to gamete development in the final stages of maturation (rand & hinch, 1998); there is evidence that more mature females with lower levels of somatic energy occupy the coolest tem- peratures in natal lakes (roscoe, hinch, cooke, & patterson, 2010a). water temperature affects maturation rate (pankhurst & king, 2010), and it has been proposed that occupying temperatures near toptas al- lows migrating females to mature most efficiently (eliason & farrell, 2016); however, this has not been examined to date. females appear to be more vulnerable to migratory challenges than males—particularly exposure to high temperatures (jeffries et al., 2012; martins et al., 2012). even females that overcome mi- gratory challenges to reach spawning grounds may exhibit delayed effects on reproduction. high rates of egg retention—when females die prior to complete spawning—have been observed in populations of pacific salmon exposed to high temperatures well below the le- thal threshold (quinn, eggers, clark, & rich, 2007; west & mason, 1987). multiple behavioural and physiological mechanisms may con- tribute. first, recovery from stress may delay arrival, decreasing time on spawning grounds (“reproductive longevity”; morbey & ydenberg, 2003) required for reproductive behaviours (hruska, hinch, patterson, & healey, 2011). second, energy may be diverted from maturation or reproductive behaviours to standard metabolism or recovery (fenkes,     |  297 shiels, fitzpatrick, & nudds, 2015). third, thermal stress may inhibit synthesis of the sex steroid 17- β oestrdiol and delay vitellogene- sis (jeffries et al., 2012; pankhurst & king, 2010). fourth, anaerobic swimming may also suppress reproductive hormones and oocyte de- velopment (palstra, crespo, van den thillart, & planas, 2010). the re- lationships between arrival date, reproductive longevity, competitive ability on spawning grounds, including morphological traits (e.g. fork length) and indicators of stress (e.g. plasma lactate), and spawning suc- cess have been studied in pacific salmon (hruska et al., 2011; mcphee & quinn, 1998). however, research has not yet linked migratory ex- perience to reproductive consequences on spawning grounds (hruska et al., 2010). the purpose of this study was to compare the relative impor- tance of indices of physiological stress, maturity and migratory ex- perience in the final stages of migration to fitness- related outcomes in female sockeye salmon. as physiological stress has a negative ef- fect on survival and maturation, we predicted that female fish that exhibited lower indices of stress (lower plasma glucose and lactate concentrations) and higher maturation (lower plasma 17-β oestrdiol concentration) and that experienced less stressful dam passage con- ditions (lower water temperature and discharge) would have higher survival, faster migration, greater reproductive longevity and lower egg retention. additionally, we predicted that female fish that spent a greater proportion of migration through lakes at temperatures near toptas would have greater reproductive longevity and lower egg retention. although reproductive longevity had a strong neg- ative relationship with egg retention in two previous studies of fe- male sockeye salmon (burnett et al., 2016; hruska et al., 2011), we treated them as separate outcomes to assess whether underlying mechanisms differ. 2 |  methods 2.1 | fish collection and tagging we studied female fish from the population of wild sockeye salmon that spawns in gates creek, british columbia. adult gates creek sockeye salmon swim 350 km up the fraser river to enter the seton river, where migrants encounter the seton dam (figure 1). after ne- gotiating the vertical- slot fishway at seton dam, adult sockeye salmon swim 55 km through seton lake, portage creek and anderson lake to reach spawning areas in gates creek. a proportion of the gates creek population spawns on beaches adjacent to the mouth of gates creek in years of high returns, but this was not observed during this study. approximately 800 metres upstream of the mouth of gates creek, a weir directs fish to a gate, which can be opened to guide fish into the natural creek upstream of the weir, or closed to load fish into a creek- fed artificial spawning channel (figure 1). female sockeye salmon from the gates creek population were captured in the seton river using a full- spanning picket fence and trap installed 200 metres downstream of seton dam (figure 1). the fence was closed for fish collection up to 12 hr per day throughout the migration and left open each night. between 16 august 2013–2 298  |     (a) (b) minke- martin et al. figure 1 the seton–anderson watershed and its location in british columbia, canada (inset);

(2006). females were identified by secondary sexual characteristics (smaller kype and adipose fin, larger vent vs. male fish). individuals were selected for tagging based on external condition and somatic energy density. fish with deep wounds (skeletal system or organs visible) or extensive fungus cover were not tagged, as these individuals were unlikely to survive past seton dam. sockeye salmon have very low stray rates (<5% of migrants; keefer & caudill, 2014), and gates creek was the only population migrating into the seton river (and through seton and anderson lakes) during the tagging pe- riod. however, we used energy probe readings to distinguish gates creek sockeye salmon from other populations, with greater somatic energy density, travelling to spawning grounds hundreds of kilome- tres farther up the fraser river. individuals sampled at the fish fence with relatively high levels of lipids have been confirmed as strays from other populations using dna population assignment (casselman, burnett, bett, mccubbing, & hinch, 2012). somatic energy density was estimated using a handheld energy probe (fm 692 fish fatmeter, distell inc., west lothian, scotland, uk; see crossin & hinch, 2005), and presumed strays were released without tagging. fork length (fl) was measured (to nearest 5 mm) and a 3- ml blood sample was taken from the caudal vein with a heparinised vacutainer (22 gauge syringe; bd canada, mississauga, on, canada). blood samples were centrifuged for 6 min to isolate plasma, which was transferred to three 0.8- ml vials and stored in liquid nitrogen before transfer to a −80°c freezer prior to laboratory analysis. fish were tagged with a half- duplex passive integrated transponder (pit) tag (32 mm length × 3.65 mm diameter; texas instruments, dallas, tx, usa) in the dorsal musculature, a 12- inch spaghetti tag (floy manufacturing, seattle, wa, usa) attached posterior to the dorsal fin (for visual identifica- tion on spawning grounds), and a uniquely coded radio transmitter (pices5 model: 43 mm length × 16 mm diameter, 15.2 g in air, 3 s burst rate; sigma eight inc., newmarket, on, canada) inserted gas- trically with a plastic plunger. archival temperature loggers (ibutton thermochron model ds1921z or ds1922l; maxim integrated, san jose, ca, usa) were glued to the nonantenna end of radio trans- mitters and waterproofed (plasti dip international, st. louis park, mn, usa), following donaldson et al. (2009). temperature loggers archived data at 15- minute intervals and had a resolution of 1/16°c (manufacturer stated accuracy: ±0.5°c, range: −10°c to +65°c; model ds1922l) or 1/8°c (manufacturer stated accuracy: ±1°c, range: −5°c to +26°c; model ds1921z). an adipose tissue punch was taken and stored in ethanol (for dna population identification), and the fish was photographed and returned to the holding pen for recovery. the time to tag each fish was not recorded in 2013, but was likely equivalent to 2014 (mean ± sd: 4.7 ± 1.2 min, range: 2.7– 9.1 min, n = 95), as the procedure did not differ between years. to achieve the objectives of a parallel study (casselman et al., 2015), groups of ten to twelve fish were transferred to a 1,000- l aerated transport tank and driven for 20 min to release locations on the west (50°39′43″n, 121°55′06″w) and east (50°39′40″n, 121°54′50″w) bank of the fraser river, 2.5 km downstream of the seton river– fraser river confluence (figure 1). in 2014, fish were released from the west bank only, as survival to seton dam and dam passage did not differ by release location in 2013 (casselman et al., 2013). all capture, tagging, sampling and transport procedures were approved by the university of british columbia animal care committee (animal use protocol a11- 0125), following canadian council on animal care guidelines. minke- martin et al. stationary radio receivers (orion, sigma eight inc. or srx- 400, lotek wireless inc., newmarket, on, canada) with three- element yagi antenna were placed at the release location on the west bank of the fraser river, at seton dam (one directed at the tailrace, one directed at the fishway entrance), and at the entrance to the spawning channel in gates creek (figure 1). during installation, a test tag was used to de- termine the detection area of each receiver and ensure complete cov- erage of the area of interest. pass- through pit antennas (oregon rfid, portland, or, usa) were installed inside the entrance and exit basins of the seton dam fishway. two pit readers were installed on spawning grounds: a three- antenna array at the spawning channel entrance and a pass- through pit antenna 120 m upstream of the mouth of gates creek in 2014 (figure 1). all pit antennas were tested at least once per week by placing a designated test tag in the water within 0.5 m of the antenna, at various locations along its length. if the read range was <0.5 m, the antenna was tuned. data from all receivers were down- loaded once or twice per week. radio telemetry data were filtered to remove false- positive de- tections using r (version 3.1.3; r development core team 2015). detections with radio frequency and tag code combinations not used in this study were removed. next, detections that occurred prior to the release of a tagged fish or after the recovery of a tag in gates creek were removed; these detections typically occurred when the tag or tagged fish was driven past a receiver. finally, we removed any detection that did not occur within two minutes of another detection from the same tag on the same receiver. the basis for the final filtering criterion is that a tag with a 3 s burst rate can be detected up to 40 times in two minutes, while multiple false- positive detections of the same radio frequency and tag code combination rarely occur on the same receiver within two minutes. first and last detections were then identified for each fish at each receiver from the filtered telemetry data. first and last detections at seton dam and gates creek were obtained by pooling radio and pit telemetry data to account for pos- sible missed detections at a single receiver (e.g. caused by turbulence in the dam tailrace and a power outage at the gates creek spawning channel in 2014). only females that successfully passed seton dam were included in the analyses. the 69 tagged females that did not pass seton dam (2013: 43, 2014: 26) were assessed in a parallel study (casselman et al., 2015). the last detection at seton dam was considered the beginning of the in- lake migration. survival to spawning grounds was determined by detection on any radio receiver or pit antenna at gates creek. migration duration, or the time spent in seton and anderson lakes, was calculated as the difference in days between the last detec- tion at seton dam and the first detection at gates creek. although there was a well- advertised tag recovery programme in place during this study, wherein rewards were provided for returned tags, only four radio transmitters were returned from tagged fish captured in fisheries. we suspect that unreported harvest occurred between seton dam and gates creek but have no direct means of accounting for this mortality in the statistical models presented here. there is no reason to suspect that sockeye salmon captured in fish- eries differed physiologically (see cooke et al., 2009) or experienced     |  299 different migration conditions compared to survivors, as harvest oc- curred throughout the entire gates creek run. in 2015, mobile radio tracking in known fishing areas generated estimates of 5–10% of tagged fish being caught (casselman et al., 2015). although we cannot be certain whether this harvest rate is applicable to 2013 or 2014, it would reflect a relatively small component of total mortality. 2.2 | dam passage conditions a temperature data logger (manufacturer stated accuracy: ± 0.2°c, range: −20°c to +50°c; tidbit v2, onset computer corporation inc., bourne, ma, usa) in the top pool of the fishway recorded hourly seton river water temperature throughout the study period. the highest hourly temperature recorded while each fish was in the tail- race and fishway at seton dam was used to characterise the tempera- ture conditions experienced during dam passage. we obtained hourly seton dam discharge data from a water survey of canada gauge in the seton river (figure 1). under standard operating procedure, seton dam spills water from a siphon directly adjacent to the fishway entrance (details in burnett et al., 2014). small fluctuations in discharge (<1 m3·s−1) in the area around the fishway en- trance can increase reliance on anaerobic swimming, which was found to be associated with high mortality of female fish following dam pas- sage (burnett et al., 2014). in 2014, the flow conditions in the seton dam tailrace were altered for a parallel study (burnett et al., 2016). from 8 august 2014 to 19 august 2014, water was spilled from a si- phon approximately 10 m from the fishway entrance, which increased mean seton dam discharge from 27.1 to 31.4 m3·s−1 (figure 2). for this study, seton dam discharge was categorised as “low” (under standard flow conditions; throughout 2013, from 5 august 2014 to 7 august 2014 and 20 august 2014 to 9 september 2014) or “high” (under altered flow conditions; from 8 august 2014 to 19 august 2014), because the siphon change caused substantial differences in both discharge and tailrace flow dynamics (burnett et al., 2016; casselman et al., 2015). individual fish were assigned to a discharge category (low or high) based on the date of first detection at seton dam. 2.3 | plasma physiology plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were measured using ysi 2300 stat plus glucose and lactate analyser (ysi inc., yellow springs, oh, usa). 17- β oestrdiol and testosterone concentrations were measured from blood plasma samples, following procedures outlined in roscoe et al. (2010a). relative concentrations of plasma 17- β oestrdiol and testosterone were used to verify visual sex as- signments made at tagging for all 2013 fish. visual sex assignments were 92% accurate in 2013 (n = 214 total fish tagged). hormones were not used to verify sex in 2014, but visual sex assignments were 96% accurate, based on recovered carcasses (n = 107 carcasses recovered, n = 103 sex assignments correct). across years, females were more likely to be misidentified as males (two fish incorrectly identified as females, 20 fish incorrectly identified as males). all confirmed females were included in analyses. 300  |     ) c ° ( t e r u a r e p m e t ) s / 3 m ( e g r a h c s d i 23 21 19 17 15 13 34 32 30 28 26 24 minke- martin et al.

(2011) to suggest that fish require 90% of maximum aerobic scope to complete migration. the maximum aerobic scope (11.08 mg o2·kg−1·min−1) and optimum temperature (toptas; 16.4°c) for gates creek sockeye were previously derived from fish at rest and swum maximally in a swim tunnel respirometer at a range of data were analysed using four statistical models, with one for each of the response variables: survival to spawning grounds, migration dura- tion, reproductive longevity and egg retention. model 1 had the re- sponse variable of survival (detected at gates creek [1], not detected [0]) and was fitted with a generalised linear model (glm; family: bino- mial; link: logit). model 2 had the response variable of migration dura- tion (in days) and was fitted with a linear model. both global models included the following explanatory variables: (i) year and (ii) tagging date, to account for inter- and intra- annual differences in fish con- dition and migration experience; (iii) fl (cm), to account for differ- ences in fish size; (iv) plasma lactate (mmol·l−1) and (v) plasma glucose (mmol·l−1), to test the effects of indices of physiological stress; (vi) plasma 17- β oestrdiol (ng·ml−1), to test the effect of maturity; and (vii) seton dam discharge (low [0] or high [1]) and (viii) seton dam water temperature (tdam; °c), to test the effects of migratory stressors. model 3 had the response variable of reproductive longevity (in days) and was fitted with a linear model. model 4 had the response variable of egg retention (retained eggs [1], did not retain eggs [0]) and was fitted with a glm (family: binomial;

and (viii) arrival date on spawning grounds, to account for intra- annual differences in fish condition and migration experience. variables included in each of the four models are summarised in table 1. all variables were assessed for correlation and multicollinearity and excluded if r >|.7| (zuur, ieno, & elphick, 2010) or variance inflation factor >4 (o’brien, 2007). model residuals were visually assessed and met the assumptions of normality, independence and heteroscedastic- ity (zuur et al., 2010). seton dam discharge was collinear with arrival date (vif >4) in model 4, so inclusion of one of the two variables was determined based on the individual glm (response: egg retention; ex- planatory variable: seton dam discharge or arrival date) with the lower aicc score (see table s1). reproductive longevity was not included in the egg retention model, as it does not provide a physiological expla- nation for spawning failure. furthermore, inclusion in the egg reten- tion model caused vif >6. all statistical analyses were conducted with r software. candidate models were generated using the “mumin” package from all com- binations of variables in the global model and compared using aicc for small sample sizes (burnham & anderson, 2002). the candidate sets for models 3 and 4 were limited to models with three or fewer minke- martin et al. m a d t l r o f n w o h s s e z i s e p m a s ( e g r a h c s i d d n a )  ( e r u t a r e p m e t  m a d n o t e s m u m x a m  i , s n o i t a r t n e c n o c l i  o d a r t s e o d n a e s o c u g l , e t a t c a l a m s a p l , ) l f ( h t g n e l k r o f , i  e t a d g n g g a t f o n o s i r a p m o c   1   e l b a t 4 1 0 2 ,  2 1 p e s – 2 2 g u a  4 1 0 2 ,  2 1 p e s – 2 2 g u a  .  3 0 0 ± 3 3 0  . .  3 0 0 ± 3 3 0  . a e t a d l a v i r r a w o d n w i  s a t p o t ) n ( e g r a h c s i d h g h i 7 2 w o l 8 0 1 0 2 3 6 4 1 4 1 5 2 4 2 ) c ° ( m a d t ) 1 − l m · g n ( l i o d a r t s e o ) 1 − l · l o m m ( e s o c u g l ) 1 − l · l o m m ( e t a t c a l ) m c ( l f  e t a d g n g g a t i l ) n ( e b a i r a v e s n o p s e r l  e d o m .  1 0 ± 2 8 1  . .  1 0 ± 1 8 1  . .  2 0 ± 0 8 1  . .  2 0 ± 9 7 1  . .  3 3 0 ± 2 7 5  . .  9 0 0 ± 7 8 4  . .  5 2 0 ± 7 9 4  . .  3 0 ± 1 8 5  . .  5 4 0 ± 0 4 6  . .  8 0 0 ± 9 5 4  . .  4 3 0 ± 4 5 5  . .  4 0 ± 5 8 5  . .  5 6 0 ± 3 1 8  . .  0 1 0 ± 1 5 4  . .  0 4 0 ± 0 6 5  . .  6 0 ± 3 9 5  . .  7 6 0 ± 1 1 8  . .  0 1 0 ± 3 5 4  . .  1 4 0 ± 3 6 5  . .  7 0 ± 4 9 5  . 3 1 0 2 ,  2 0 p e s – 6 1 g u a  4 1 0 2 , 3 1 0 2 ,  7 0 p e s – 5 0 g u a  2 0 p e s – 6 1 g u a  4 1 0 2 ,  7 0 p e s – 5 0 g u a  4 1 0 2 ,  6 0 p e s – 1 1 g u a  4 1 0 2 ,  6 0 p e s – 1 1 g u a  ) b 9 3 ( y t i v e g n o l e v i t c u d o r p e r ) b 8 3 ( n o i t n e t e r g g e ) 5 3 1 i ( l a v v r u s ) 3 8 ( n o i t a r u d 1 2 3 4  i i g n n a m e r e h t r o f d e o o p s r a e y h t i  l w , l  4 1 0 2 d n a 3 1 0 2 r o f y e t a r a p e s n w o h s e t a d g n g g a t e v a h  i ) 2 ( d n a ) 1 ( s l e d o m l . ) n ( e z i s e p m a s e h t h t i  w g n o a , l n o i t n e t e r g g e ) 4 ( d n a y t i v e g n o l e v i t c u d o r p e r l  y n o 4 1 0 2 m o r f a t a d e d u c n  l i 4 l e d o m d n a 3  l e d o m l  . s e b a i r a v y r o t a n a p x e l  l s e b a i r a v y r o t a n a p x e l l e d o m . ) ” s d o h t e m “ e e s ( e g r a h c s i d h t i  w y t i r a e n i l l o c o t e u d 4  l  e d o m m o r f d e t t i m o s a w e t a d  l a v i r r a a . l e a m e f e n o r o f d e d r o c e r t o n s a w n o i t n e t e r g g e s a ,  4 d n a 3 s l e d o m n  i r e f f i d s e z i s e p m a s b l ) 3 ( ,  n o i t a r u d n o i t a r g m i ) 2 i  ( , s d n u o r g g n n w a p s o t l a v v r u s ) i 1 ( f o s l e d o m l a c i t s i t a t s n i d e d u c n l i h s i f e h t r o f n w o h s s i ) s e b a i r a v r e h t o r o f ( l  d s ± n a e m r o ) s e t a d i l a v i r r a d n a g n g g a t r o f ( e g n a r  e h t . s e k a l   n o s r e d n a d n a n o t e s h g u o r h t d e k c a r t n o m a s e y e k c o s e a m e f r o f k e e r c s e t a g l l t a e t a d l a v i r r a d n a , ) . c ° 5 9 1 – 4 3 1 .

table s2), a confidence set of models with cumulative weights summed to ≥0.95 was averaged using the “natural average” method to generate coefficient estimates and 95% confidence intervals for explanatory variables (burnham & anderson, 2002). to compare relative effect sizes within a model set, continuous variables were standardised with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 2 (gelman, 2008). response variables were not trans- formed (zuur et al., 2010). fit of linear models was evaluated using adjusted- r2, and fit of glms was evaluated using pseudo- r2, following hosmer and lemeshow (1989). two- sample t tests were used to com- pare the reproductive longevity of females that did and did not retain eggs at death and to compare plasma lactate, glucose and oestradiol concentrations between years. statistical significance was assessed at p <0.05. untransformed data are presented as mean ± sd, unless otherwise indicated. 3 |  results females that passed seton dam were included in model 1 (survival; n = 135: 52 in 2013, 83 in 2014). successful migrants to gates creek were included in model 2 (migration duration; n = 83: 23 in 2013, 60 in 2014). females recovered in the spawning channel or from the gates creek weir in 2014 with thermal loggers (n = 39) and spawning assessments (n = 38) were included in model 3 (reproductive longev- ity) and model 4 (egg retention) respectively. plasma lactate, glucose and oestradiol concentrations, and fl did not show strong seasonal trends in either year or when years were pooled (all r <0.3). mean glucose concentration was higher in 2013 (5.36 ± 1.24 mmol·l−1, range: 2.94–10.20 mmol·l−1) than in 2014 (4.56 ± 0.84 mmol·l−1, range: 3.03–9.34 mmol·l−1; two- sample t test: t80 = 4.09, p <0.001). conversely, mean concentra- tion of oestradiol was higher in 2014 (7.32 ± 3.54 ng·ml−1, range: 0.13–8.11 ng·ml−1) than in 2013 (3.16 ± 2.63 ng·ml−1, range: 0.28– 16.08 ng·ml−1; two- sample t test: t129 = −7.81, p <0.0001), but lac- tate did not differ significantly between years (two- sample t test: t80 = −0.76, p =0.45). fish spent 8.3 ± 14.3 hr (range: 0.3–121.2 hr) in the tailrace and fishway at seton dam (i.e. between first and last detections), but times were not correlated with tagging date or the temperature or discharge experienced. maximum fishway temperatures experienced (18.2 ± 1.1°c, range: 13.8–20.4°c; figure 2a) were often above the optimal temperature for gates creek sockeye (16.4°c) and decreased with tagging date (2013: r =0.6, 2014: r =−0.3). during “low” discharge periods, mean seton dam discharge was 26.5 ± 1.8 m3·s−1 (in 2013; range: 24.6–29.5 m3s−1), 27.1 ± 0.1 m3s−1 (5 august 2014–7 august 2014; range: 26.9–27.2 m3s−1) and 26.1 ± 0.5 m3·s−1 (8 august 2014– 19 august 2014; range: 25.2–27.6 m3·s−1). mean “high” discharge was 31.4 ± 0.4 m3·s−1 (20 august 2014–7 september 2014; range: 31.0– 34.0 m3·s−1). discharge decreased with tagging date in both years (2013: r =−0.5, 2014: r =−0.7; figure 2b). 302  |     3.1 | receiver efficiency detection efficiency of the radio receiver at the release location on the west bank of the fraser river was high (99%, n = 135). detection efficiencies of individual receivers at seton dam were poor to high [radio receivers: tailrace (83%, n = 135) and fishway (2014 only: 47%, n = 83); pit antennas: fishway entrance (93%, n = 135) and exit (92%, n = 135)], but all fish (n = 135) had multiple detections on at least one receiver when data were pooled. receivers were also pooled at gates creek, as no single receiver detected all fish [radio: channel entrance (98% of survivors, n = 83); pit antennas: lower gates creek (2014 only: 43%, n = 60) and channel entrance (64%, n = 83)]. detection of a fish on any receiver at gates creek meant that the individual was considered a successful migrant in model 1 and included in model 2. 3.2 | survival to spawning grounds (model 1) plasma glucose and lactate concentrations, fl and year formed the most parsimonious survival model, which accounted for 15% of varia- tion (table s2). lower plasma glucose concentrations at tagging were associated with higher survival to gates creek (figures 3a and 4), and glucose was the most important explanatory variable, appearing in all models in the confidence set (table s2). plasma glucose concen- trations were 4.59 ± 0.75 mmol·l−1 (range: 2.94–7.15 mmol·l−1) in females that reached gates creek and 5.32 ± 1.36 mmol·l−1 (range: 3.35–10.20 mmol·l−1) in females that died en route. survival of tagged fish to spawning grounds was higher in 2014 (72% of fish, n = 60) than in 2013 (44%, n = 23; figure 4), although the effect of year was uncertain, as the 95% ci crossed zero (figure 3a). fish tagged later had a higher probability of survival, as did larger fish and fish with higher plasma lactate or oestradiol concentrations. contrary to pre- dictions, fish that experienced high seton dam discharge had a higher minke- martin et al. probability of survival, although the 95% ci was large and spanned zero. the effect of fishway temperature on survival was approxi- mately zero. 3.3 | migration duration (model 2) on average, females spent longer in seton and anderson lakes in 2014 (9.9 ± 5.1 days, range: 3.1–23.3 days; n = 60) than in 2013 (6.4 ± 4.2 days, range: 2.4–23.8 days; n = 23; figure 5), and year was present in all models in the confidence set (table s1). females tagged earlier in the season took longer to reach spawning grounds (r =−0.6, years pooled; figure 5). tagging date was present in all models in the candidate set (table s2), and the effect of tagging date was twice as strong as the effect of year (figure 3b). all other explanatory variables had uncertain coeffi- cient estimates, with 95% ci spanning zero (figure 3b), and, when added to the top- ranked model in the candidate set (i.e. tagging date + year; r2 =0.33), did not describe any additional variation (table s2). exposure to high discharge was associated with longer migrations, but the effect was highly uncertain, as the 95% ci was wide and crossed zero. the effects of fl plasma glucose, lactate and oestradiol concentration, and fishway temperature were all approximately zero (figure 3b). 3.4 | temperature experience in natal lakes in 2014, the females from which temperature loggers were re- covered spent an average of 9.8 ± 5.3 days (range: 2.4–10.1 days; n = 39) in seton and anderson lakes. mean lake temperatures expe- rienced were between 9.2 and 14.8°c, and minimum and maximum temperatures were from 4.9 to 11.1°c and from 17.4 to 22.4°c re- spectively. on average, females spent 33% of the migration in the toptas window (13.4–19.5°c;

figure 3c). females that experienced high seton dam discharge lived fewer days on spawning grounds than females that experienced low discharge (figure 3c), and discharge also appeared in all top models (table s2). females that arrived on spawning grounds later lived fewer days than early arriving fish (figure 3c). the top model, which in- cluded time in the toptas window, seton dam discharge and ar- rival date, accounted for 33% of variation in reproductive longevity (table s2). according to model predictions, a female that arrived on 2 september (median arrival date) lived 12.1 days, following exposure to low seton dam discharge, and 8.5 days, following ex- posure to high discharge, given mean values of all other variables (figure 7a). females that spent 50% of time in the toptas window lived 13.2 days in the spawning channel, following exposure to low discharge, and 9.5 days, following exposure to high discharge, given mean values of all other variables (figure 7b). plasma glucose con- centration was negatively associated with longevity, while plasma oestradiol and lactate concentrations, fl and fishway temperature were positively associated with longevity (figure 3c); however, the directions of effect for these variables were uncertain, as the 95% ci spanned zero. 3.6 | egg retention (model 4) of the thirty- eight females assessed on spawning grounds in 2014, 32% (n = 12) retained eggs at death and 68% (n = 26) did not. females that successfully spawned lived longer on spawning grounds (12.4 ± 3.9 days, range: 4–22 days, n = 26) than females that retained eggs at death (6.8 ± 2.6 days, range: 4–11 days, n = 12; two- sample t test: t31 = −5.25, p <0.0001; see figure 7d). aicc scores from individual glms fitted to the egg retention data were compared for a model with seton dam discharge and a model with arrival date on spawning grounds as the only explan- atory variable. the discharge model had more support from the data (aicc: 44) than the arrival date model (aicc: 51; table s1), so seton dam discharge was included as a categorical variable in model 4, and arrival date was excluded. both the earliest and latest arriving females successfully deposited eggs on spawning grounds (figure 7d). females that spent a greater proportion of time in seton and anderson lakes in the toptas window were less likely to retain eggs, as were females that experienced low seton dam discharge (figure 3d); both variables appeared in all models in the confi- dence set (table s2). the averaged model predicted that a female fish had a 50% probability of retaining eggs following exposure to high discharge and 30% of migration in the toptas window, or following exposure to low discharge and 6.8% of migration in the toptas window, given mean values of all other variables (figure 7e). the top- ranked model, which explained 33% of the variation, also included plasma glucose concentration (table s2). females with higher plasma glucose at tagging were more likely to retain eggs, but the effect was uncertain, as the 95% 304  |     minke- martin et al.

(2010a) inferred that female gates creek sockeye salmon with relatively lower plasma oestradiol at capture in the seton river were more mature than females with higher concentrations, as migrants are 55 km from spawning grounds and within 1–2 weeks of spawning. in the current study, lower plasma oestradiol may indi- cate that females were more mature in 2013 than in 2014. however, levels of circulating sex hormones can also be depressed by physio- logical stress processes (reviewed by schreck, contreras- sanchez, & fitzpatrick, 2001), and 19–22°c temperatures, like migrants experi- enced in the fraser river in 2013, suppress synthesis of plasma oestra- diol in female salmonids (jeffries et al., 2012; pankhurst & king, 2010). females tagged early in the migration spent up to 20 days longer in seton and anderson lakes than females tagged later. roscoe et al. (2010a) observed that early migrants hold and circle in anderson lake, while in the current study, late migrants swam through the lakes in approximately two days. the negative relationship between tagging     |  305 date and migration duration synchronises arrival on spawning grounds; in sockeye salmon populations, most fish arrive within a one- to two- week window (killick, 1955). in 2013, females reached spawning grounds more quickly than females in 2014, which may be attributed to several factors. first, fish may have migrated more quickly when ex- posed to high fraser river temperatures (keefer et al., 2008; naughton et al., 2005). second, the near- lethal temperatures in 2013 likely con- tributed to the very low survival of fish tagged early in the run, which we might expect to migrate more slowly. furthermore, a later mean tagging date in 2013 may have biased the data, as fewer of the early migrants were sampled. ultimately, only one tagged female with a mi- gration duration >15 days survived to gates creek in 2013. early arrival on spawning grounds was associated with greater reproductive longevity, which has been attributed to strong selective pressure for early spawning females to live long enough to defend redds from disturbance by later arrivals (dickerson, quinn, & willson, 2002; morbey & ydenberg, 2003). we also observed a close associa- tion between reproductive longevity and spawning success, whereby longer- lived females were more likely to deposit all eggs before death (burnett et al., 2016; hruska et al., 2011). however, egg retention was not strongly related to arrival date, as both the earliest and lat- est arriving females spawned successfully. the absence of a strong effect of arrival date is unusual for patterns of egg retention, because prespawning mortality is thought to be more prevalent among early arriving female fish (gilhousen, 1990; fukushima, quinn, & smoker, 1998; but see hruska et al., 2011). our observations may be related to unusual migration timing in 2014, when the first fish arrived at gates creek nine days later than in 2013 (s. lingard, instream fisheries research inc., pers. comm.). it is possible that early migrants arrived on spawning grounds with greater reproductive preparedness, as final maturation is driven by environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperatures (davies & bromage, 2002). we found new evidence to support the hypothesis that exposure to a migratory stressor can have a delayed negative effect on fitness- related outcomes in pacific salmon (see also caudill et al., 2007; fenkes et al., 2015). from 8 august 2014 to 19 august 2014, water was released from a siphon approximately 10 m from the seton dam fishway entrance, rather than directly adjacent, as is standard oper- ating procedure. the operational change increased water velocities below the dam, the area of the tailrace covered by turbulent flows, and seton dam discharge by up to 25%. a parallel study examined gates creek sockeye salmon swimming behaviour during each of the flow conditions and found that although fish delayed longer in the dam tailrace under high discharge, survival to spawning grounds was higher (burnett et al., 2016). in the current study, model 1 predicted a slightly higher, but uncertain, probability of survival for females that experi- enced high discharge in 2014. yet, dam passage appeared to affect reproduction in a subset of the females we tagged. female fish that experienced high discharge at seton dam had lower reproductive lon- gevity and were more likely to retain eggs at death. according to model predictions, a female that experienced high seton dam discharge would have had to arrive on spawning grounds 10–15 days earlier 306  |     or spend a greater proportion of the migration at toptas to achieve the same longevity as a female that experienced low discharge. cumulative stress, suppression of maturation processes and energy depletion caused by swimming against high flows are possible expla- nations for the reduced reproductive longevity and spawning success that we observed (fenkes et al., 2015; nadeau, hinch, hruska, pon, & patterson, 2010; palstra et al., 2010). this is the first study to relate spawning success to use of a physi- ologically relevant temperature range (≈ toptas ± 3°c) by pacific salmon in the natural environment. gates creek is one of only a few popu- lations of pacific salmon with a known aerobic scope curve (eliason et al., 2011; lee et al., 2003), which can be used to infer cardiac capacity and scope for activity from the thermal experience of indi- vidual fish. consistent with predictions, females that spent a greater proportion of the migration through seton and anderson lakes in the toptas window (13.4–19.5°c) lived longer on spawning grounds and had lower egg retention at death. temperature- dependent maturation processes may be driving these differences in fitness- related out- comes. the optimum and upper threshold temperatures for vitellogen- esis have not been defined for species of pacific salmon, but female salmonids held at temperatures >18°c exhibit suppressed plasma oestradiol and vitellogenin synthesis and lower egg survival, rela- tive to fish held at temperatures <15°c (sockeye salmon, macdonald et al., 2000; atlantic salmon (salmo_salar), king, pankhurst, watts, & pankhurst, 2003), and the quality of ovulated eggs declines quickly above 13°c (coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch), flett, munkittrick, van der kraak, & leatherland, 1996). in the current study, few females occupied temperatures in the upper half of the toptas window (16.5– 19.5°c) for prolonged periods, indicating that fish were avoiding these warmer temperatures. exposure to temperatures above 19.5°c was rare; the warmest temperatures were experienced in portage creek (>20°c), where there is no opportunity for thermal refuge. tagged fish were observed at temperatures below the toptas window, with many females exhibiting a preference for temperatures near 10–12°c, con- sistent with behavioural thermoregulation by sockeye salmon in other lakes (e.g. armstrong, ward, schindler, & lisi, 2016; newell & quinn, 2005). it is important to note that a variety of thermal experiences (15–80% of time in the toptas window, at different instances in the migration) were associated with successful spawning in the current study. unfortunately, we could not assess the effect of lake thermal experience on survival, because archival temperature loggers were not recovered for fish that died en route to spawning grounds. this is an important gap in current research, as unsuccessful migrants may expe- rience warmer temperatures than survivors when adult salmon are mi- grating near the limits of thermal tolerance (keefer et al., 2008, 2015). it remains unclear whether insufficient time on spawning grounds is a direct cause of spawning failure—because females are unable to complete necessary reproductive behaviours before death—or whether both decreased longevity and spawning failure are caused by poor physiological condition. it is possible that disease processes in some tagged females led to both cool thermal preference (<13.4°c) and poor fitness- related outcomes. use of cool temperatures may prevent pathogen- associated mortality (mathes et al., 2010), as minke- martin et al. water temperature increases virulence and replication rates in some pathogens (holt, sanders, zinn, fryer, & pilcher, 1975; udey, fryer, & pilcher, 1975). it is yet to be examined whether pacific salmon with higher pathogen loads or in more advanced stages of disease select cooler lake temperatures and whether these fish also die prematurely on spawning grounds with retained eggs. thermal behaviour of sockeye salmon in lakes reflects trade- offs between multiple physiological processes, including energy conser- vation, swimming activity, stress recovery, olfactory homing, matu- ration and disease responses (bradford et al., 2010; newell & quinn, 2005; roscoe et al., 2010a). for example, use of cool temperatures conserves limited somatic energy. roscoe et al. (2010a) observed that females with low energy levels avoided high temperatures, and sock- eye salmon populations with longer freshwater holding exhibit cooler average temperatures (e.g. katinic, patterson, & ydenberg, 2014; newell & quinn, 2005). yet, our observation that tagged females did not use the coolest temperatures available was consistent with pre- vious studies that have shown fish to select intermediate tempera- tures in lakes (armstrong et al., 2016; eckmann, dunham, connor, & welch, 2016). at low temperatures, sockeye salmon have reduced aerobic scope for oxygen- dependent processes, such as swimming. eliason et al. (2011) proposed that fraser river sockeye salmon re- quire at least 90% of aerobic scope to complete upstream migration, and our results demonstrate that females can swim through natal lakes with a lower proportion of maximum aerobic scope (at temperatures <13.4°c). preference for 10–12°c by tagged females in this study sug- gests a temperature window that balances aerobic scope for migra- tion with somatic energy conservation and suitable temperatures for vitellogenesis. in summary, the explanatory variables we investigated differed in importance across four fitness- related outcomes, demonstrating the complexity of factors governing the final stages of migration and spawning. our work indicates that researchers should measure multiple fitness- related outcomes at the individual scale if we are to broaden our understanding of how different factors—including lethal and sublethal stressors—affect adult pacific salmon in the final stages of migration. acknowledgements the work was supported by funding from bc hydro, st’át’imc eco resources, national science and engineering research council of canada (nserc) discovery and ocean tracking network (otn) canada grants (to s.g.h.), a canada foundation for innovation grant to otn canada, an nserc alexander graham bell scholarship (to v.m.m.), and mitacs- accelerate internships (to v.m.m). we thank a. adolph, j. hopkins, a. james, r. ledoux, w. payne, and c. white for assistance with tagging; c. fletcher and h., l., and l. o’donaghey for conducting spawning assessments; instream fisheries research inc. for assistance with fence installation and telemetry; fisheries and oceans canada environmental watch for plasma analyses; and e.g. martins and n.b. furey for statistical advice. m.l. keefer and one anonymous reviewer provided constructive feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript. minke- martin et al. references armstrong, j. b., ward, e. j., schindler, d. e., & lisi, p. j.
