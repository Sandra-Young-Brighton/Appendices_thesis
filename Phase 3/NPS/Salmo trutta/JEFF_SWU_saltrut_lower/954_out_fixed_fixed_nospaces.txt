munksgaard abstract – otoliths preserve a continuous record of the life cycle from the natal through the adult stage. for that reason, the morphological and chemical characteristics of otoliths of two nonnative salmonids, brown_trout (salmo_trutta) and brook charr (salvelinus_fontinalis) from populations on the kerguelen islands were compared. several approaches were used to study the relationships between otolith morphometry, crystal morph and chemical elemental composition. these salmonids sampled in kerguelen are well differentiated in terms of species through their otolith shape. the results indicate that ecotypes and river populations can be reasonably well differentiated on the basis of otolith shape. the crystallisation study has revealed the presence of a particular form: the vaterite, present at a high rate: 45% of s. fontinalis and 18% from salmo_trutta fario. moreover, vaterite and aragonite otoliths presented differences in chemical composition. morat f.1, betoulle

antarctic oceanic climate. the hydrographic system is complex (rivers, fjords and lakes) and no endemic freshwater ichthyofauna is present. many ﬁsh species have been introduced between 1951 and 1991 (ducheˆne 1989; duhamel et al. 2005), exclusively salmonidae (salvelinus_fontinalis, salmo_trutta and salmo_salar…). the majority of these species quickly acclimated and then colonised new rivers. the kerguelen islands present a favourable environ- the ment absence of the for studying these species because of freshwater endemic ichthyofauna, homogeneity of sites and the simplicity of freshwater communities. environmental contaminants (heavy metals, organic pollutants…) may be responsible for physico-patho- logical troubles (highest disease sensibilities, sexual variations…) in wild ﬁsh populations in many world regions. however, the pressure of human activities on ﬁsh populations disturbs the determination of the real responsibility of environmental contaminants in phys- ico-pathological perturbations observed. in the ker- guelen islands, the living salmonid populations are potentially protected from anthropogenic perturba- tions. however, the recent studies carried out in two kerguelen rivers, chaˆteau river and ferme river have shown differences between the two sites in the doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00313.x 617 morat et al. fontinalis]. these different immune competence characteristics [number of circu- lating leucocytes, splenosomatic index and phagocyte oxidative activity (betoulle et al. 2005) of s. trutta and s. immune parameters between the two salmonids populations of chaˆteau river and ferme river could be due to differences in exogenous (food availability and quality, particular physico-chemical characteristics…) and in endoge- nous biological factors (age, reproductive and epide- miological status of organisms). otoliths are an indirect means to study the relation- ships between environment and organisms, through their shape, crystal morph and their chemical compo- sition. minor and trace elements incorporated into otoliths during growth may record environmental conditions experienced by ﬁshes. they are considered as the ‘black box’ of the ﬁsh (lecomte-finiger 1999). chemical elements were used because (i) environmen- tal physico-chemical conditions inﬂuence incorpora- tion, (ii) there is no turnover (campana 2005). otolith size and shape were species speciﬁc but interindividual variations might exist in functions of geographic areas. with environmental disturbances or stress, asymmetry between right and left otoliths can be observed (cam- pana 2005). otoliths are composed of caco3 that normally precipitates as aragonite, which is metaboli- cally inert (campana 1999). in few otoliths, the caco3 occurs as calcite or vaterite. these three polymorphs of caco3 differ in the geometry of the crystal: calcite is trigonal, vaterite is hexagonal and aragonite is ortho- rhombic. otoliths may be completely or partially composed of vaterite. vaterite otoliths have been reported in a number of marine and freshwater ﬁshes from different environments (gauldie 1986; oliveira & farina 1996; tomas & geffen 2003). calcite and vaterite could be linked to physiological disturbances or to environmental stress (morales-nin 1987). salmonids (brown_trout s. trutta and brook_trout s. fontinalis) from various kerguelen aquatic systems were compared through their otolithometric character- istics. in this paper, we tested the hypotheses (i) that otolith shape can be used to differentiate salmonids species and ⁄ or populations, (ii) that otoliths shape, crystallisation and chemistry can be used to evaluate environmental stress among the salmonids. to answer these questions the role of external factors including stress, food quality and quantity, freshwater quality is discussed. materials and methods studied areas between january and august 2005, brown and brook_trout were sampled in six different aquatic systems of kerguelen: studer lakes, chaˆteau, sud and ferme 618 it rivers, and sablie`re and de´charge ponds (fig. 1). the ﬁrst three sites were relatively far from the scientiﬁc base of port-aux-franc¸ais, whereas the other three sites were very close to the base (fig. 1). is important to note that studied sites were represented by lentic (lakes and ponds: sablie`re and de´charge) and lotic systems (rivers: ferme, studer, sud and chaˆteau). each month between january and august 2005, water physico-chemical characteristics of the six different sites were recorded from samples taken in the middle of each month. they included temper- ature, ph, conductivity, and levels of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen–ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, orthophosphates, potassium and sulphates, according to standard methods of the american public health association (american public health association 1992). each analysis (one for each month between january to august 2005) was done in triplicate (table 1). salmonids a total of 199 ﬁsh were captured by electroﬁshing. weight and length were measured (table 2) and sagittae (310) were extracted directly in the ﬁeld. these ﬁshes belonged to three salmonids species: salmo_trutta fario, salmo_trutta trutta and s. fonti- nalis. as other salmonids these species are sometimes able to realise marine migration and returned to their native river by homing. otolith morphometry species to test whether otoliths shape could be used for differentiate salmonids and population, otoliths were cleaned and weighted (accuracy 0.001 mg; semi-microbalance sartorius genius, s.a. sartorius mechatronics belgium n.v. leuvensesteen- weg, 248/b, 1800 vilvoorde me 235p). each otolith, sulcus acusticus systematically placed with the oriented towards the observer, was examined under a stereomicroscope ﬁtted with (sony xc-77ce ccd industrial camera, sony, france) linked to a computer. digital images were then acquired with the software visilog 6.3 (noesis, orsay, france) which also calcu- lated the surface area of the otolith (ao), its perimeter (po), its length (maximum measure, lo) and its width )2 mm. these (maximum measure, lo) to the nearest 10 measures allowed the calculation of ﬁve shape indices (table 3) which are independent from differences in otolith size (tuset et al. 2003). moreover, the shape of each otolith was assessed with a fourier series. among several possibilities for analysing shape with fourier series, the elliptic fourier analysis (efa) descriptors are often considered more powerful than those derived from fast fourier for shape analysis, and was therefore used in this work, although transformation (fft) otolith examination of salmonid ﬁsh 69ºe 70ºe 49ºs 10 km 50ºs 3 2 1 * 10 km © davaine

described as a periodic function x(t) and y(t) formed by a sum of trigonometric series of sinus and cosines. these series are characterised by several components named harmonic or ellipse. each harmonic is charac- terised by four coefﬁcients resulting from the projec- tion of each point of the outline on two normal axes (x) and (y). the higher the number of harmonics, the greater is the accuracy of the outline description (kuhl & giardina 1982). for each digital image, the software shape 1.2 (free software) h. iwata ó 2001, see http:// cse.naro.affrc.go.jp/iwatah/shape (iwata & ukai 2002) calculated the fourier coefﬁcients to make them independents from otolith size and orientation (and position) regarding the start point of the outline, which is arbitrarily deﬁned. in addition, the fourier power (fp) spectrum was calculated to determine the sufﬁ- cient and necessary number of harmonics for the best reconstruction of the otolith outline (crampton 1995). the fp of a harmonic is proportional to its amplitude and provides a measure of the amount of ‘shape information’ described by this harmonic. for the nth harmonic, fp (pfn) is given by the expression: pfn¼ða2 n þ b2 n þ c2  n þd2 n þ 2 where an, bn, cn and dn were the fourier coefﬁcients of the nth harmonic. then, we can calculate the cumulated power percentage (pfc) deﬁned by: pfc ¼ n 1pfn for such a purpose, we randomly choose subsamples of 20 otoliths, from the six sites, and calculated both the 620 fourier series and the fp. the increase in number otoliths until 30 does not change the fp. the threshold of 99.99% of the mean cumulated fp was chosen to deﬁne the adequate number of harmonics to be consid- ered in the analyses. the fp indicates that 17 harmonics described 99.99% of the outline of otoliths for the two salmonidae. however, the coefﬁcients derived from the ﬁrst harmonic were not taken into account, because the outline reconstructed with these coefﬁcients is a simple ellipse resulting in a maximum fp. these coefﬁcients would then mask the information derived from the other harmonics. thus, 16 harmonics with four coefﬁcients (64 variables) were used for discrimination. crystallography to evaluate the impact of environmental stress among the salmonids, x-ray diffraction was used to identify the polymorph composition of caco3 in normal and aberrant otoliths. samples were crushed and intro- duced in x-ray diffractometer (pw1729 philips x-ray generator with a goniometer 1731). the excitation was achieved with a copper lamp and a scan 2h angle between 2° and 60° (0.02° s )1). otoliths were observed with an environmental scanning electron microscope (philips xl, 30 esem) to obtain photographs of crystals. chemical elemental composition the chemical elemental composition of otoliths has been used to characterise differences between morph of crystallisation, and was analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ultra mass 700 icp-ms, varian, inc. corporate headquarters, palo alto, ca, usa) and icp atomic emission spectros- copy (vista-pro, varian, inc. corporate headquar- ters, palo alto, ca, usa). otoliths from the two species from six areas and a sample of vaterite and aragonite otoliths were analysed (n = 60). each otolith was dissolved in 2 ml of suprapur nitric acid (65%). solutions were mineralised 2 h at 110–120 °c and solubilised in 5 ml of suprapur nitric acid (5%); )1) were 50 ll of intern standard (indium 0.1 mgæl added. a standard range was realised with a multi- element solution (astasol mix mo101, analytika, prague, czech republic). the quality control was realised with three standards (bonemeal, tort (labster hepatopancreas) 2 and otoliths crushing). data analysis the different shape indices might present redundancy between them because some are built with the same parameters, i.e., surface area, perimeter, etc. so, because of possible links between these indices, pearson correlations were ﬁrst calculated to ovoid redundancies in the use of these indices. although a correlation exists between the coefﬁcient of form and circularity (r = )0.990, p < 0.01) and between roundness and rectangularity (r = 0.590, p < 0.01), all shape indices were separately used in the following analyses in a student t-test for paired sampling (spss version 10, spss inc. headquarters, chicago, illnois, usa). reclassiﬁcation of undetermined ﬁsh and determi- nation of differences between the six geographical sites for each ﬁsh species was evaluated by canonic discriminant analysis (cda). each of 16 harmonics was deﬁned by four coefﬁcients. therefore one otolith was described by 64 variables. the cda was performed on these variables to investigate the validity of predeﬁned groups. the performance of the discri- minant analyses was assessed with the wilk’s k. this statistic is the ratio between the intragroups variance and the total variance, and provides an objective means of calculating the chance-corrected percentage of agreement between real and predicted groups membership. the values of wilk’s k range from zero to one, the closer the wilk’s k is to zero, the better is the discriminating power of the cda. to validate the performance of the cda, a cohen’s kappa statistic test was used. this statistic analysis provides an objective means of calculating the chance-corrected percentage of agreement between actual and predicted group membership; kappa values range from zero to one, with zero indicating the cda yields no improvement over chance, and one indicating perfect agreement (titus et al. 1984). a principal components analysis was performed for the two species to analyse the relationships between abiotic conditions in sampling sites and vaterite presence in otoliths (spad 4, coheris. spad, courbevoie, france). different ratios of trace elements sr ⁄ ca, mn ⁄ ca, mg ⁄ ca and ba ⁄ ca were calculated for sampling areas and for vaterite and aragonite otoliths. differences in otolith examination of salmonid ﬁsh ratios were analysed by mann–whitney and kruskal– wallis test (spss). results population differentiation shape indice mean were not signiﬁcantly different between right and left otoliths for the two salmonids species (salmo_trutta fario and s. fontinalis) (table 4). no dimorphism between otoliths was observed. right and left otoliths were then used indifferently for discriminant analyses. in the ﬁrst step, discriminant analysis was realised to classify all salmonids in their respective species group. the discrimination between the two species has a wilk k of 0.18 (p < 0.05) and cohen-kappa test revealed that 89% of ﬁsh were correctly classiﬁed. this analysis has allowed the determination of 12 misdetermined individuals. functions were similar analyses have been realised with otoliths from ﬁshes of the six rivers to search inter-sites dif- ferences. classiﬁcation groups were studer, chaˆteau, ferme, sud and base (de´charge and sablie`re). the ﬁrst discriminant function (fig. 2a) was signiﬁcant for sal- velnus fontinalis with a wilk k to 0.062 (p = 0.002). for salmo_trutta fario (fig. 2b) the ﬁrst two discrimi- signiﬁcant wilk k [0.002 nant )6)

sampling sites. in fact, s. fontinalis samples were subdivided into three groups. the ﬁrst discriminant axis separated individuals from sud to individuals from studer and base aquatic systems. salmo_trutta fario samples were grouped in the four sites: chaˆteau, ferme, studer rivers and base. first discriminant function distin- guished studer river from areas near the scientiﬁc base of

groups: studer, chaˆteau rivers and a group represented by ferme river and base. salmo_trutta fario populations are distributed along a gradient going from rivers far the base to rivers near the base. these two analyses showed that morphom- etry and particularly fourier analysis could be used for population differentiation. crystallography environmental stress could affect the crystallisation morph of calcium carbonate of otoliths. preliminary observations revealed the presence of transparent and opaque otoliths (fig. 3a and e). to test, whether these differences are the result of a switch in crystallisation morphs (aragonite, vaterite or calcite) caused by an environmental stress, the morph of crystallisation have characterised by x-ray diffraction. it revealed that the ‘aberrant’ transparent otoliths are composed of vaterite (fig. 3h) and the ‘normal’ opaque otolith (fig. 3d) of aragonite. the two morphs present variations in their diffraction peaks because of variations in inter-atomic distance (fig. 3). moreover, structures are different: aragonite crystallises in needle whereas their 622 vaterite in smooth balls. aragonite crystals are ortho- rhombic (fig. 3c) and vaterite hexagonal (fig. 3g). the proportion of vaterite otoliths varied with species: 46% for s. fontinalis and 18% for salmo_trutta fario. chemical elemental composition the concentration of ca, sr, mg, mn, ba, cu, zn and al were measured using ms (icp-ms) and then compared between vaterite and aragonite otoliths. ratio to calcium were computed for strontium, manganese, magnesium and barium, for both vaterite and aragonite otoliths. differences in concentration were observed for sr ⁄ ca (u = 101, p < 0.05), mn ⁄ ca (u = 37, p < 0.05) and mg ⁄ ca ratios (u = 12, p < 0.05) but no for ba ⁄ ca ratio (fig 5a–d). moreover, heavy metal concentration e.g., zinc and aluminium were different between the two crystallisation morphs (fig. 5e, u = 20; fig. 5f, u = 12, p < 0.05) but not for cu concentration (fig. 5g). elemental concentra- tion comparisons between crystallisation morphs showed an increase of mg, mn, zn and al and a decrease of sr in vaterite otoliths while ba and cu concentrations were the same for the two morphs. moreover, analyses of these elements for all sampling rivers also showed concentration variations. but, no site effect was directly observed. relation between otoliths and abiotic conditions to test whether the two crystallisation morphs char- acterised on otoliths are in relation with environmental stress, a principal component analysis has been realised. it revealed relationships between some abi- otic factors (table 1) of the aquatic systems and vaterite otoliths (fig. 4). this table presents mean of each abiotic factor measured during the 6 months of sampling. however, some of them can have many variations during the day as temperature which can vary to 10 °c. for s. fontinalis two groups of rivers are separated on the four axes (respectively 27.76%, 17.1%, 11.25% and 8.8%): studer, sud and chaˆteau in one hand, de´charge and sablie´re on the other hand. these two last rivers are characterised by a high ph, their conductivity and are linked to the presence of phenolic compounds and vaterite otoliths. for salmo_trutta fario the opposition between de´charge, sablie´re, ferme and chaˆteau, studer and sud was only present on the ﬁrst axis (34.68% of variability). a relation between phenols, hydrocarbons and vate- ritic otoliths is present on three axes (respectively 15.17%, 9.22% and 8.54% of variability). the rivers near the scientiﬁc base are characterised by waters with high conductivity and presence of phenols and ﬁsh with vaterite otoliths (fig. 4). otolith examination of salmonid ﬁsh fig. 3. aragonite (35·) (a)

areas were just illustrative variable and were not used in analysis. discussion can otolith shape be used as a tool for differentiating among salmonids species and salmonids ‘populations’? the salmonids sampled in kerguelen were well differentiated in term of species. otolith shapes have been used in many biological studies. juveniles of two salmonids species (s. salar and s. trutta) have been distinguished by otoliths shape descriptors (l’abe´e- lund 1988). in our study, otolith shape analyses were used for the discrimination of the species of salmonids (salmo_trutta fario and s. fontinalis) and have allowed the determination of species for misdetermined indi- viduals (these ﬁsh were not determined in the ﬁeld because of bad conditions during the sampling). the results of our study indicate that ecotypes and river populations can be reasonably well differentiated on the basis of otolith shape. recent studies have used fourier harmonics for the description of otoliths shape. this technique associated with statistical analysis allowed a discrimination between ﬁshes of the same species living in various geographic areas (pothin et al. 2006; me´rigot et al. 2007). otoliths from one river were well differentiated from other river (97% in their river of origin for s. fontinalis and 100% for salmo_trutta fario). these high replacement levels were better than levels observed for s. salar (87%) by friendland & reddin (1994). this speciﬁcity for their river can be the result of homing that characterises salmonids. migrant individuals were able to return to their native river. the number of mistake would be mg/ca (x1000) vaterite aragonite ba/ca (x1000) (b) 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 (d) 0.0045 0.0040 0.0035 0.0030 0.0025 0.0020 0.0015

same river could be a result of this homing. the similarity for sites near port-aux-franc¸ais (base and ferme) might be the result of mistake or to similar environmental conditions in the various rivers. moreover, this analysis has conﬁrmed the presence of two ecotypes for each species: one ‘lake ecotype’ (studer) and one ‘river ecotype’ (chaˆteau and sud). these two ecotypes have been described earlier in literature and linked to a behavioural variability and to an evolution of genetic variability from a same ‘french’ genetic pool (brusle´ & quignard 2001). a ‘third ecotype’ appeared near port-aux-franc¸ais. this ecotype, never described in literature corresponds to an adaptative population to this particular eco- system composed of ponds and connecting short rivers near the base. can otolith shape be used as a tool for evaluating stress among the salmonids? fluctuating asymmetry is assumed to reﬂect the developmental instability caused by environmental or genetic stress (sahyoun et al. 2007). fish otoliths represent a good tool to evaluate the consequence of different effects on asymmetry. in our study, the differences between right and left otoliths were estimated by image processing. asymmetry between right and left otoliths was not signiﬁcant. nonasym- metric otoliths were found in individuals of the two salmonids stress observed in salmonids living near port-aux-franc¸ais was not so strong as to create an asymmetry in otoliths. the shape of the otoliths was unaltered by the presence of vaterite. revealing that potential species can otolith crystallisation be used as a tool for evaluating stress among the salmonids? x-ray diffraction and sem analysis revealed that crystalline otoliths were formed by a particular crystallisation morph of caco3: the vaterite. this morph was described in earlier studies (gauldie 1993; tomas & geffen 2003), but was considered as unusual. vaterite was an ancestral form found in otoliths of primitive ﬁshes as sturgeon, lamprey and hagﬁsh (carlstro¨m 1963) whereas the normal morph was aragonite. vaterite otoliths have been observed when ﬁshes were stressed in particular in ﬁsh farming. however, this morph was found in wild population of salvelinus_namaycush in north amer- ican great lakes (bowen et al. 1999). salmonids seemed to present more vaterite otoliths than other ﬁsh family (gauldie 1986). in our study 45% of otolith examination of salmonid ﬁsh otoliths from s. fontinalis and 18% from salmo_trutta fario were composed of vaterite. these rates were higher than those observed in other salmonids species: 22% for s. namaycush and 26% for oncorhynchus_tshawytscha (bowen et al. 1999). those differences might be explained by protein matrix modiﬁcations, and then by mutations and switch of amino acids (gauldie 1993). in vitro experi- ment have shown that vaterite crystallisation could be induced by the presence of acidic amino acids: glycine and alanine (6.5 < ph < 7.5) (shivkurama et al. 2006). most external factor including stress, food quality, viral temperature might induce an expression of mutated genes and the switch from aragonite to vaterite. infections and ⁄ or water temperature was a primordial factor that could induce the shift between aragonite and vaterite. a small variation of water temperature (8.30–8.85 °c) could decrease signiﬁcatively the rate of aragonite in otoliths of o. tshawytscha (gauldie 1986). the high rate of aberrant otoliths in salmonids populations in kerguelen island could conﬁrm stress conditions because of environmental factors especially temperature ﬂuctuations. water temperature in the kerguelen rivers presents a large range of variations up to 10 °c during a day and between seasons (delarue & masse´ 1981). these changes could induce a thermal stress and a switch of crystallisation in the otoliths. another important factor that could induce a change of crystallisation is linked to food accessibility. in kerguelen salmonids (juveniles and adults) have to feed on small invertebrates. this type of prey is more adapted to juveniles than to adults that are generally ﬁsh eaters (beall & davaine 1981) because no native freshwater ichthyofauna is found in kerguelen rivers. moreover, the low density and the low diversity of preys induces a high level of intraspeciﬁc competition (wojtenka & steenberghe 1981). s. fontinalis and s. trutta are, moreover, sympatric species in kerguelen rivers (brusle´ & quignard 2001). in the present study vaterite and aragonite otoliths show differences in elemental concentrations. indeed, in vaterite sr decreased and mn, mg zn and al increased. variations in sr, na and k have been observed in other species such as stenodus_leucichthys (brown & severin 1999). for tomas & geffen (2003) crystalline geometry was so different between vaterite and aragonite that this privileged incorporation of chemical elements with small ionic radius as zn, mg, and mn (0.6–0.9 a˚ : curti 1999). moreover, the low sr rate in vaterite otoliths might be the result of temperature variations indeed for o. tshawytscha decrease in sr has been correlated to temperature variations (gauldie 1996). mn presents a high solubility for acidic ph. an increase of this concentration could be the reﬂection of variation of the in the rivers. 625 morat et al. ph of the endolymph (tomas & geffen 2003). however, it is difﬁcult to dissociate the two param- eters: water temperature in the rivers and endolymph ph. indeed abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, ph and food quality) interact with endogenous factors reproduction, pathology…) across barriers (stress, (gills, intestine) and interact indirectly with hormonal systems that control the endolymphatic ﬂuid compo- sition (across saccular epithelium). the principal component analysis has revealed that vaterite otoliths were more frequent in the aquatic system near the base and linked on the one hand to particular physico-chemical characteristics. water con- ductivity in aquatic system near the base (sablie`re, de´charge and ferme) was higher than in the other sites because of proximity with the sea side, which lead to an enrichment in chlorine ions of the waters by wind and rain. on the other hand, these salmonid popula- tions are submitted to high ﬁshing pressure and to anthropogenic pollutants, because of the human pres- ence at the base. in conclusion, the results from this otolith study provide support for the view that environment quality represents an important factor for the ‘quality’ of the kerguelen salmonids. otoliths shape presents some disturbances. moreover, vaterite in high proportion was observed. many factors can produce this abnor- mality, such as temperature ﬂuctuations, dietary deﬁ- ciencies and contaminations. acknowledgements this study was a part of a multi-disciplinary scientiﬁc programme of the french polar institute (‘ecotoxicology of aquatic systems and
