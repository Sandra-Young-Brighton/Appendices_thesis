however, acknowledgement that all habitat is not equally suitable for juvenile rearing or adult spawning has led to a desire to better assess the quality of habitat for each life stage by proposed passage restoration projects. for spe- cies like coho salmon (oncorhynchus_kisutch), with a freshwater rearing period that extends through one or two winters, it may be expected that habitat use differs among young- of- year (age- 0) and age 1 year or older (age- 1+) cohorts. here, we sought to understand cohort- specific habitat use by juvenile coho salmon in a rapidly developing region of alaska to better inform passage restoration activities. the big lake drainage is located in the matanuska- susitna (matsu) region of south- central alaska, 60 miles by road from anchorage, the largest urban centre in alaska (estimated population in 2014 = 301,010, u.s. census bureau; fig. 1). the drainage contains important spawning and rearing habitat for all five pacific salmon species (oncorhynchus spp.; chum salmon (o. keta), coho salmon (o. kisutch), chinook salmon (o. tshawytscha), pink salmon (o. gorbuscha) and sockeye salmon (o. nerka) (johnson & litchfield, 2015)), with catch numbers of coho salmon in the region representing the largest recreational harvest by species in recent years (oslund & ivey, 2010). in addition, a major per- sonal use fishery for coho salmon is supported by the big lake system ecol freshw fish. 2017;26:695–706. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff  |  695 © 2016 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltd696  |     (sweet, ivey, & rutz, 2003) and coho salmon commercial harvest also occurs as part of the upper cook inlet mixed stock fisheries. the proximity of big lake to anchorage, relatively low real es- tate costs in the region and access to outdoor recreational opportu- nities have resulted in rapid development (leask, killorin, & martin, 2001). between 2000 and 2010, the population in the matsu re- gion increased 50% to 88,995 (u.s. census bureau 2010 census) and growth is expected to continue at an average annual rate of 2% (alaska department of labor and workforce development 2016). concomitant with such population increase in a rural environment is increased land clearance and road construction. as of 2016, approx- imately 105 culverts exist in salmon bearing stream sections in the drainage, with 64% assessed as partial or complete passage barriers for juvenile coho salmon (alaska department of fish and game 2016). the combination of robust development pressures in the region and significant salmon populations have made the big lake drainage a top conservation priority for the matsu salmon habitat partnership (smith, 2011; smith & speed, 2013). studies examining the presence, abundance and response of ju- venile salmonids associated with stream habitat characteristics have a long history in fisheries ecology (bisson, sullivan, & nielsen, 1988; gorman & karr, 1978; mccormick & harrison, 2011; rosenfeld, porter, & parkinson, 2000; ruggles, 1966). while some consistent habitat use relationships within species have been established, the results of such work demonstrate that the type of system studied (e.g. coastal streams with some estuarine characteristics or headwater streams), the spatial scale of interest and the season of study, among other considerations, can all influence the observed associations, stressing a need to under- stand habitat use within the context of the ecology and structure of the system of interest. here, the association between observed microhabitat charac- teristics and juvenile coho salmon counts in the big lake drainage is figure 1 survey sites within the big lake drainage, south- central alaska examined using a series of generalised linear mixed models. specifically, pooled counts and cohort- specific counts (age- 0 and age- 1+) are mod- elled using poisson glmms and the proportion age- 0 observed in a sampling unit is modelled using a binomial glmm. results suggest that age- 0 juvenile counts are positively associated with stream width while age- 1+ fish counts are most strongly associated with deeper water. additionally, age- 0 juvenile counts responded negatively to overhead canopy cover and in- stream woody debris, suggesting that these habitat components were not preferred during the summer sea- son studied here. regression modelling indicated that differences in habitat use behaviour across groups are related to age cohort and are not an artefact of fish size. a test of constant detection using an oc- cupancy modelling framework further demonstrated that results were not due to variability in the probability of detection. the results provided here will inform the prioritisation of fu- ture passage restoration activities in the drainage by modelling life stage- specific habitat use of age- 0 and age- 1+ juvenile coho salmon independently. for example, existing fish passage barrier removal op- timisation models (e.g. king & o’hanley, 2016; o’hanley, 2011) could be extended to account for ontogenetic movement among habitats during freshwater residency (forthcoming report). such models will allow us to best allocate available mitigation funds by providing con- nectivity among habitats important to all life stages. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study­system­and­design the big lake drainage is a low elevation, terminus component of the matanuska- susitna (matsu) basin in south- central alaska. encompassing nearly 250 km2 of surface area, it is characterised as a wetland- lake system with connective stream segments. juvenile coho bradley et al.salmon count data and associated habitat surveys were collected at sites in two streams within the big lake drainage: fish creek and meadow creek (fig. 1). meadow creek links the meadow lakes in the north- east with big lake and is the primary surface water inflow to big lake. fish creek, a large outlet stream from big lake, runs to the south- east and drains into the knik arm of cook inlet. characteristic of the big lake drainage, both creeks are primarily groundwater fed (hogan, 1995; jokela, munter, & evans, 1990), meandering and low gradient (<0.5%). the sampling unit in this study was a stream reach approximately 250 m2 in surface area. contiguous reaches were grouped into a site to permit efficient sampling. consistent with a proportional probability sampling design (hankin, 1984) based on watershed area, a total of 30 sites were allocated by environment (tributary or mainstem) and by stream (meadow creek or fish creek; fig. 1). study sites in mainstem environments were comprised of 15 reaches and those in tributary environments contained five reaches. eighteen sites were located in meadow creek and the remaining sites were in fish creek. nearly half of the sites in meadow creek were tributary locations (n = 8), whereas fish creek sites were predominately mainstem (n = 11). the start point of each site was randomly selected and held fixed throughout the season. 2.2 | fish­sampling­and­age­assignments fish sampling occurred between june and october 2012, with the number of sampling occasions at each site ranging from 2 to 9 due to logistical and field staff constraints. all reaches within a site were sampled at each site visit. juvenile fish were collected using minnow traps consistent with methods described in swales (1987). at each sampling event, two traps baited with sodium sulphite- free salmon eggs (clemens, chitwood, & schreck, 2011) were deployed in each reach for a minimum of 1 hr. primarily due to the variability in the number of site visits, total trap time varied across reaches, averaging 10.2 hr across the field season (range: 2–24.9 hr; sd: 5.2 hr). upon trap retrieval, salmonids were identified to species and coho salmon were anaesthetised, weighed to 0.1 g, and measured for fork length to 1 mm. an optimal fork length cutpoint for age assignments to age- 0 or age- 1+ cohorts was determined using a finite gaussian mixture model fit to fork lengths (sethi et al., in preparation). with this model, age assignment cutpoints were stratified by stream and by month such that the value increased over the course of the season. a subsample of fork length- based aged fish was validated with scale ageing to verify the accuracy of the size- based ageing methodology (see table s1).     |  697 composition (%; boulder, cobble, gravel and fine as defined in wheaton, 2003) and hydrologic flow (%; riffle, run, and pool) were summarised at the reach scale by calculating a weighted average of the observa- tions made on each transect within the reach by the surface area each observation represented. small woody debris, large woody debris, un- dercut bank, deep pool, overhanging vegetation, in- stream vegetation and overhead canopy coverage were assigned categorical ranks based on prevalence within the reach and determined by field crew con- sensus where 0 = none, 1 = 1%–10%, 2 = 11%–20%, 3 = 21%–50%, 4 = 51%–80% and 5 = 81%–100%. for each categorical covariate, bins were later aggregated to eliminate those represented by only a few observations in the data set. for example, in the model sets small woody debris was represented by three categories where the highest category represented reaches with 11% or more small woody debris. prior to modelling, correlation plots and variance inflation factors (vif) were examined to identify possible multicollinearity in the habi- tat characterisation variables (zuur, ieno, & elphick, 2010). as a result of these preliminary analyses, deep pool, run and riffle hydrologic pro- files, and fine and cobble substrates were removed from further con- sideration. all other fixed effects in the statistical models described below had vif values <3.0. 2.4 | statistical­analysis 2.4.1 | habitat­associations­within­cohort the association between juvenile coho salmon counts and habitat survey information was assessed using generalised linear mixed mod- els (glmms; gelman & hill, 2007). age- 0, age- 1+, and pooled age- 0 and age- 1+ counts were modelled as a function of habitat variables to determine whether patterns observed in the cohort- specific models were reflected in the pooled count model. in each case, a glmm as- suming a poisson distribution with a log link function was employed. an additive normal random intercept term at the level of study site was included, reflecting the clustered natured in which the data were collected (multiple reaches within sites) and potential reach- level fi- delity or schooling behaviour by juvenile coho salmon. an offset for effort, log (trap time), was included in the model specification to ac- count for the variability in the length of time traps set at each reach. finally, initial efforts to fit a “global” model to the data indicated over- dispersion in each poisson glmm set (pooled counts, age- 0, age- 1+), detected by a chi- squared test of the sum of the squared pearson residuals (p < .001 in each case). this overdispersion was accommo- dated by including an observation- level random effect (e.g. gelman & hill, 2007). following the above features, count model glmm speci- fications are as follows: 2.3 | habitat­assessments yij ∼ poisson(elog (μij)+β0+x� ij+γij+εi ), habitat assessments were carried out in the summer field seasons of 2013 in meadow creek and 2014 in fish creek. within each reach (reaches nested within study sites), transects were established every 8 m and the habitat was characterised using protocols outlined in johnson and slaney (1996). wetted width (m), depth (m), substrate where yij is the expected trap count of coho salmon (pooled counts, age- 0 or age- 1+) in reach j within site i, log (μij) is the offset for total trap time in reach j within site i, β0 is the global intercept, x߰ ij is a 1 × q vector of covariates (see below) for reach j in site i, and β is a q × 1 vec- tor of the fixed effect parameters. γij and εj are the normally distributed bradley et al.698  |     random deviations for the observation- level (overdispersion term) and site random effects respectively with means zero and standard de- viations σγ and σε. fixed effects in the “global” models were stream (meadow creek or fish creek), environment (mainstem or tributary), month, wetted width, depth, per cent pool, per cent gravel, small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging veg- etation, in- stream vegetation and overhead canopy coverage. habitat covariates measured on a continuous scale (wetted width, depth, per cent pool and per cent gravel) were mean- centred to facilitate regres- sion model convergence. to further clarify the potential importance of habitat characteris- tics driving the proportion of age- 0 versus age- 1+ fish across sampling sites, regardless of the absolute count of fish at a given location, we also implemented a binomial glmm with a logit link. overdispersion was again detected in the “global” model by a chi- squared test of the sum of the squared pearson residuals (p < .001) and an observation- level normally distributed random effect was added to the model structure to account for the additional variability. following the above features, the binomial glmm was specified as: age- 0ij ∼ binomial(pooled countij,pij) pij = logit−1(β0 + x� ij + δij + θi) where age- 0ij is the number of age- 0 juveniles in reach j within site i, pooled countij is the pooled number of age- 0 and 1+ juveniles in reach j, site i (i.e. all juvenile coho at the location) and pij is the proportion of age- 0 fish in reach j within site i. β0 is the global intercept, x߰ ij is a 1 × q vector of covariates (see below) for unit j in group i, and β is a q × 1 vector of the fixed effect parameters. δij and θj are the normally distributed random deviations for the observation- level (overdisper- sion term) and site random effects with means zero and standard deviations σδ and σθ respectively. a subset of the fixed effects were included in the “global” model to obtain initial model convergence: stream (meadow creek or fish creek), environment (mainstem or tributary), month, wetted width, depth, per cent gravel, small woody debris, in- stream vegetation and overhead canopy coverage. habitat covariates measured on a continuous scale (wetted width, depth and per cent gravel) were mean- centred to facilitate regression model convergence. an aicc- based all subsets model selection routine was imple- mented for each “global” model (poisson glmms: pooled, age- 0, age- 1+ data sets; binomial glmm: proportion of age- 0 fish) using the “mumin” package in r (bartoń, 2009). the random effect structure and, in the case of the count model fits, the offset, were retained in all subsets. in the context of a glmm, the likelihood one uses (con- ditional or marginal) and the appropriate number of parameters to as- sociate with a random effect when calculating information- theoretic criteria is dependent upon the level (population or cluster) at which one would like to make predictions (vaida & blanchard, 2005). using the marginal likelihood (i.e. averaging the conditional likelihood over all possible values of the random effect, weighted by their probabilities as determined by the assumed normal distribution for the random effect) and setting the degrees of freedom equal to 1 for each random effect are consistent with a primary interest in population- level inference and were used here for the calculation of the aicc (vaida & blanchard, 2005). to select the fixed variables retained in the final model used for inference and prediction, relative variable importance was calculated on the balanced model set obtained from the all subsets routine (each predictor variable is present in an equal number of models; burnham, 2015). relative variable importance for each fixed effect variable is ob- tained by summing the aicc weights of all models in the set contain- ing a given covariate (burnham, 2015; burnham & anderson, 2002). those variables with riv ≥ 0.8 were included in the final model used for inference. in each of the four regression sets considered here (poisson glmms: pooled, age- 0, age- 1+ data sets; binomial glmm: propor- tion of yoy fish), the final model was fit separately and model ad- equacy was assessed using quantile–quantile plots comparing the pearson’s residuals of the fitted model to a 95% confidence bound derived from residuals obtained by simulating data from the fitted model in an approach adapted from zuur, ieno, walker, saveliev, and smith (2009, chapter 21). to check for unmodelled patterns in the data, plots of the pearson’s residuals against each fixed effect were examined. plots of the estimated conditional modes (the estimated deviation of a cluster from the population average (bolker, 2015)) for each random effect were also made to confirm that no study sites behaved as an outlier. for each final model, parameter estimates, standard errors and parametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals are reported for the fixed effects in addition to estimates of the stan- dard deviation and parametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for each random effect. the explanatory power of the final fitted models was evaluated with marginal and conditional r2 calculated for glmms using the methods outlined in nakagawa and schielzeth (2013). following the recommendation of nakagawa and schielzeth (2013), the distribution- specific variance under the poisson glmm was calculated from an intercept- only model that included all random effects. finally, marginal predictions for the retained covariates in the final cohort- specific models were calculated using the approach outlined in atkins, baldwin, zheng, gallop, and neighbors (2013) and vali- dated with simulations by pavlou, ambler, seaman, and omar (2015). frequently in the ecological literature random effects are set at a value of 0.0 to obtain model predictions from glmms, which gen- erates a “conditional” (on a random effect realisation of 0.0) predic- tion; however, such a conditional prediction is only appropriate for assessing specific population units with realised random effects of 0.0, whereas typically ecological analyses seek to make inference about a study population at large. following methods in atkins et al. (2013), we numerically integrated over the fitted normal random effects to produce model predictions on the scale of the response (fish count or proportion of age- 0 fish) appropriate for population- level inference. confidence intervals for marginal predictions were obtained using a nonparametric bootstrap procedure in which 500 bootstrap data sets were constructed, sampling first from the level of site and then from the level of reach within site. bradley et al.2.4.2 | habitat­associations­with­fork­length models exploring the association between age cohorts and habitat characteristics indicate cohort- specific habitat use patterns (see re- sults). juvenile salmonid age and fork length are strongly correlated with one another, raising a question as to whether habitat use pat- terns across cohorts are related to the size of fish rather than the age of fish. to explore this question, sampled juveniles were split into two groups based on fork length, defining fish less than 75 mm as age- 0 juveniles and those >85 mm as age- 1+ fish. these thresholds, based on scale ageing and mixture model ageing, were chosen to subset the data into fish which could be aged with high accuracy; fish of interme- diate length or undetermined age were removed from this portion of the study to avoid placing individuals into the incorrect age cohort and subsequently introducing error into the analyses. following this, the association between habitat variables and fork length within cohort- specific data sets was assessed using linear mixed models (lmms). lmms were specified with fixed effects matching those identified in the final poisson glmm for each cohort, and with reach and site as independent additive random effects normally distributed: fork lengthijk = β0 + x� ijk + ϑij + τi where fork lengthijk is the length of individual k in reach j within site i, β0 is the global intercept, x߰ ijk is a 1 × q vector of covariates for in- dividual k captured in reach j in site i and β is a q × 1 vector of the fixed effect parameters. ϑij and τj are the normally distributed random devia- tions for reach and site effects with mean zero and standard deviations σϑ and στ respectively. model adequacy was assessed in a manner equivalent to that described above for the glmms. effect sizes, stan- dard deviations and parametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals are reported. identification of strong associations between fork length and habitat features within a given cohort (age- 0 or 1+) would be sug- gestive that habitat preference is potentially size- mediated. all mixed model fits (poisson and binomial glmms, lmm) were made in the r statistical programming environment (r core team 2015) using package “lme4” (bates, maechler, bolker, & walker, 2015). package “lme4” model fits were coded with a single integration point for gaussian quadrature- based numerical integration for approxima- tion of the log likelihood, corresponding to a laplace approximation fitting option (see “lme4” help files for details). 2.4.3 | occupancy­modelling:­testing­for­detection­ heterogeneity an implicit assumption made in the analysis described thus far is a constant probability of detection across sampling units and sampling seasons. previous studies in the region suggest minnow traps have high and stable probability of detection for juvenile coho salmon (e.g. sethi & benolkin, 2013); however, to test this assumption in the present system, a subset of 43 reaches located in nine of the study sites was sampled once each at a randomly selected time during the sampling season. three back- to- back trap deployments of one hour in duration were conducted to enable an occupancy modelling approach     |  699 to estimate detection probability of minnow traps. under the occu- pancy modelling framework (mackenzie et al., 2002), a bernoulli state process describes the true presence of an organism at site i, zi, and a bernoulli observation process describes the detection of at least one individual at site i, trap deployment j, xij, conditional on presence: state process: zi ∼ bernoulli(φi) observation process: xijzi ∼ bernoulli(zipij) here, both zi and xij are indicator variables where 1 = presence or detection respectively, φi is the probability of occupancy of site i and pij is the probability of detection of at least one individual at site i, trap deployment j. both the probability of occupancy and the probability of detection can be modelled as a function of covariates using a logit link. following the glmm modelling described above (habitat associ- ations within cohort) and the identification of habitat characteristics which relate to pooled juvenile counts (yoy and age- 1+), the model below was fit to the occupancy data:  and, φi ∼ 1 pij ∼site- specific habitat variablesi + monthi + offset(duration of trap deployment)ij. the occupancy probability was set as constant a priori because the naïve estimate of occupancy was 0.95 (sampling at 41 of 43 sites re- sulted in the observation of at least one juvenile coho). the model was tested for goodness of fit using a parametric bootstrap chi- squared test proposed by mackenzie and bailey (2004) and presented in fiske and chandler (2015). profile likelihood 95% confidence intervals were then obtained for the covariates and reported. occupancy models were fit in r using the “unmarked” package (fiske & chandler, 2011). 3 |  results a total of 17,107 juvenile coho were caught and measured through- out the 2012 fish sampling field season. among the 30 study sites, the distribution of catch numbers, weighted by trap time, skewed towards higher values (mean: 3.8 fish/hour; maximum: 9.7 fish/hour). samples were dominated by age- 0 fish (83% of all fish sampled). fish were also numerically dominant in fish creek as opposed to meadow creek (81% of all fish sampled, 82% of the age- 0 fish sampled and 79% of the age- 1+ fish sampled). 3.1 | habitat­associations­within­cohort we observed strong effects of stream, month, wetted width, depth, small woody debris and overhead canopy coverage on pooled juvenile coho salmon counts (table 1). all other covariates had relative vari- able importance values <0.4. forty- five per cent of the variation in fish counts across sampling sites was explained by the fixed effects retained in the final models (marginal r2) and 58% was explained by the com- bined fixed effects and estimates of site and observation- level effects bradley et al.700  |     table 1 parameter estimates, standard errors and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the final poisson glmms regressing pooled, age- 0 or age- 1+ juvenile coho counts respectively against stream, month and reach- level habitat characteristics. parameters estimates are at the level of the linear predictor pooled­count age-­0­count age-­1+­count estimate se 95%­ci estimate se 95%­ci estimate se 95%­ci intercept stream: meadow month: july month: august month: september month: october width depth swd (1–10%) swd (11%+) occ (1–10%) occ (11–20%) occ (21%+) u (1%+) site effect (sd) observation- level effect (sd) 0.336 −0.664 1.429 2.009 1.568 0.438 0.027 0.755 −0.466 −0.365 0.037 0.003 −0.505 0.550 0.708 0.201 0.223 0.078 0.071 0.087 0.176 0.008 0.242 0.110 0.138 0.071 0.129 0.166 (−0.095, 0.767) (−1.123, −0.241) (1.271, 1.610) (1.877, 2.152) (1.394, 1.744) (0.011, 0.760) (0.010, 0.047) (0.344, 1.219) (−0.688, −0.250) (−0.655, −0.066) (−0.100, 0.186) (−0.227, 0.262) (−0.850, −0.195) −0.665 −0.696 2.012 2.891 2.271 0.929 0.029 −0.546 −0.436 0.138 0.051 −0.494 0.247 0.281 0.096 0.091 0.106 0.209 0.009 0.124 0.157 0.080 0.144 0.188 (0.333, 0.667) (0.658, 0.741) 0.700 0.780 (−1.204, −0.150) (−1.261, −0.112) (1.826, 2.233) (2.715, 3.089) (2.057, 2.491) (0.466, 1.338) (0.010, 0.048) (−0.804, −0.270) (−0.784, −0.119) (−0.014, 0.297) (−0.238, 0.365) (−0.892, −0.127) (0.472, 0.841) (0.725, 0.823) −0.624 −0.949 0.620 0.275 0.320 −0.132 0.030 3.365 0.213 0.293 0.099 0.092 0.114 0.263 0.011 0.350 (−1.081, −0.160) (−1.563, −0.400) (0.429, 0.803) (0.095, 0.447) (0.094, 0.539) (−0.736, 0.320) (0.006, 0.051) (2.807, 3.998) −0.691 0.681 0.759 0.293 (−1.350, −0.146) (0.400, 0.843) (0.683, 0.808) final models were constructed following the estimation of all subset models from a global model, retaining the random effects of site and observation and the offset of trap time in all models and including all fixed effects in models an equal number of times. relative variable importance (rvi) was derived from the resulting balanced model set, and variables with rvi > 0.8 were included in the final model. (conditional r2). both increasing depth and width were positively as- sociated with pooled counts (table 1). doubling stream width from 7 m to 14 m resulted in an expected increase in juvenile coho salmon from 45 to 54, or 20%. similarly, mean expected counts increased from 43 to 52 fish when stream depth increased from 0.25 to 0.5 m. the pres- ence of small woody debris and high levels of overhead canopy cover- age (>20% coverage) were both negatively associated with total counts (table 1). an increase in small woody debris from 0 to 1%–10% was associated with a 37% reduction in fish counts. predicted juvenile coho salmon declined 39% at reaches with 20% or more overhead canopy coverage in comparison with those with no canopy. models of age- 0 counts, age- 1+ counts and the proportion of age- 0 at a sampled reach were constructed separately to examine cohort- specific habitat associations. because age- 0 juveniles com- prise a majority of the observed data, it is not unexpected that the suite of retained covariates in the final model of age- 0 counts and the estimated effect sizes of each is nearly the same as that for the pooled count model (table 1; fig. 2 left panel). stream depth is the only habitat covariate from the pooled model that is not also signifi- cantly associated with age- 0 counts. in comparison with the pooled count model, the proportion of the variation in the data explained by the age- 0 model improved (marginal r2: 0.50 vs. 0.45; conditional r2: 0.64 vs. 0.58), suggesting age- 1+ fish followed different habitat utili- sation associations. in contrast to the pooled count or age- 0 models, depth was the most important covariate explaining counts of age- 1+ juveniles (table 1; fig. 2 right panel). under this model, the number of age- 1+ fish is expected to more than double from 4 to 10 fish at depths of 0.5 and 0.75 m respectively. there was also a positive effect of width and a negative effect of undercut banks, but model selection did not retain an effect of small woody debris or overhead canopy coverage in the final model. fixed effects for the final age- 1+ model explained 30% of the variation in fish counts, and the combined fixed effects and site- and observation- level random effects explained 43% of the variation. the binomial glmm regressed the proportion age- 0 fish on the habitat variables which allowed for a comparison of age- 0 and age- 1+ juvenile counts as a function of habitat characteristics. the variance explained by this model was not as great as that of the count mod- els; the fixed effects, site-  and observation- level effects accounted for 50%, but the fixed effects alone explained 28%. with this model, however, the role of depth as a segregating characteristic between age classes was further emphasised as the proportion of age- 0 observed at reaches decreased with increasing depth (table 2; fig. 3). the final binomial glmm indicated that a 0.1- m increase in water depth is as- sociated with an expected 5% decrease in the observed proportion of age- 0 fish. based on relative variable importance, no other habitat characteristic was retained in the final model. 3.2 | habitat­associations­with­fork­length in subsetting the data to obtain cohort- specific data sets, 1,029 fish of intermediate or indeterminate age were removed from the data. bradley et al.    |  701 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 wetted width (m) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 wetted width (m) (b) 20 15 10 5 0 t n u o c o h o c + 1 d e g a  120 100 80 60 40 20 0 no occ occ(1–10%) occ(11–20%) occ(21%+) no swd swd (1–10%) swd (11%+) 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 11. 2 depth (m) no undercut undercut (a) t n u o c o h o c  0 d e g a 250 200 150 100 50 0 160 120 80 40 0 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 figure 2 marginal predictions, with 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals, for the habitat characteristics (width (m), small woody debris, overhead canopy coverage and undercut banks) retained in the final models of age- 0 (a) and age- 1+ (b) juvenile coho salmon counts. note, y- axes for “wetted width” panels differ table 2 parameter estimates, standard errors and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the final binomial glmm regressing the proportion of age- 0 in a reach against stream, month and reach- level habitat characteristics. parameters estimates are at the level of the linear predictor parameter intercept depth month: july month: august month: september month: october site effect (sd) observation- level effect (sd) estimate −0.304 −4.712 1.657 2.952 2.273 1.221 1.330 0.924 se 0.276 0.465 0.142 0.138 0.158 0.368 95%­ci (−0.896, 0.245) (−5.574, −.3817) (1.354, 1.963) (2.663, 3.231) (1.940, 2.583) (0.508, 2.061) (0.889, 1.712) (0.811, 1.000) final models were constructed following the estimation of all subset models from a global model, re- taining the random effects of site and observation and the offset of trap time in all models and including all fixed effects in models an equal number of times. relative variable importance (rvi) was derived from the resulting balanced model set, and variables with rvi > 0.8 were included in the final model. about 13,983 fish comprised the age- 0 data set and 2,095 fish were included in the age- 1+ data set. in contrast to the age- 0 count model, the age- 0 fork length model indicated a negative association between fish size and stream width, as well as low levels of overhead canopy coverage (table 3);

<20 cm/s (bisson et al., 1988)); however, the protection afforded by edge habitats may not be as important in low- gradient wetland- dominated streams with low water velocities such as those in the big lake drainage. edge hab- itat was not measured in the present study, but wide stream sections in big lake are most often characterised by open wetland habitat and indistinct bank margins which can provide proportionately high levels of edge habitat (hankin & reeves, 1988). this illustrates the relative uniqueness of the big lake drainage in studies of juvenile salmonid habitat associations, where previous empirical work has focused on higher gradient systems in the u.s. pacific northwest, coastal british columbia canada or south- east alaska u.s. several previous studies have demonstrated an association with large woody debris and coho salmon juvenile abundance (e.g. beechie, liermann, beamer, & henderson, 2005; cederholm et al., 1997; mundie, 1969), noting the link between large woody debris and pool formation (beechie & sibley, 1997; montgomery, buffington, smith, schmidt, & pess, 1995) or streamflow reduction (shirvell, 1990), and the use of large woody debris to avoid inter/intraspecies interactions as possible mechanisms. we did not observe a relationship between large woody debris and counts of age- 0 or age- 1+ fish in this study. over 90% of the reaches were characterised by low levels of large woody debris (<10%) and those sites with large woody debris were not associated with an increased abundance of pool or deep habitat. in a study of 28 sites in the north cascade and puget sound region of washington, the relationship between large woody debris and pool table 5 observed counts of in- stream vegetation coverage, overhead canopy coverage and small woody debris across the 351 stream reaches studied here in-­stream­vegetation 0–10% 11%–20% 21%–50% 51%–80% 81%–100% 0 1%–10% 11%–20% 21%+ 0 1%–10% 11%+ 21 23 11 26 2 53 26 19 27 5 0 3 29 19 18 48 9 4 10 44 25 21 25 1 2 4 40 5 46 42 3 0 26 62 3 overhead canopy coveragea small woody debrisb aχ2 = 93.48, p- value < .001. bχ2 = 60.68, p- value < .001. bradley et al.704  |     formation was found to be mediated by the channel slope where pools in low- gradient streams were not strongly associated with the pres- ence of large woody debris, suggesting that processes besides large woody debris deposition form pools in low- gradient streams (beechie & sibley, 1997). additionally, the relationship between large woody debris and juvenile coho salmon abundance is most commonly ob- served during the winter season (bustard & narver, 1975; heifeltz, murphy, & koski, 1986; tschaplinki & hartman, 1983). indeed, a study of the response of coho salmon and steelhead (o. mykiss) to experi- mental large woody debris additions in stream sections had a positive effect on winter population numbers but no effect to summer or au- tumn distributions (cederholm et al., 1997). we observed negative effects of small woody debris and high lev- els of overhead canopy coverage (greater than 20% coverage) on age- 0 juveniles. similarly, the presence of undercut banks had a negative ef- fect on juveniles age- 1+. these findings are somewhat contrary to other studies that have shown that reduced temperature fluctuations (malcolm et al. 2004) and protection from aerial predators (johnsson, rydeborg, & sundstrom, 2004; reinhardt & healey, 1997) provided by overhead canopy coverage and brushy debris support higher juvenile coho salmon populations. in- stream debris and undercut bank refu- gia can also provide visual isolation (dolloff, 1986) and concomitant reduction in competitive behaviour (hartman, 1965). however, high levels of overhead canopy coverage may also restrict light penetra- tion to the stream channel, impeding primary productivity and the ac- cumulation of in- stream biomass (kiffney, richardson, & bull, 2004). following the experimental removal of alder canopy in stream sections on prince of wales island, south- east alaska, age- 0 coho salmon rel- ative abundance decreased more in closed canopy sections although reductions in both closed and open stream sections were observed during the study period (keith, bjornn, meehan, hetrick, & brusven, 1998). a similar result was found in northern california where the den- sity and biomass of cutthroat trout and rainbow trout (o. mykiss) in- creased in opened stream sections in comparison with sections where canopy was maintained (wilzbach, harvey, white, & nakamoto, 2005). mccormick and harrison (2011) attribute increases in the abundance of macrophytes in open canopy stream sections, with an associated increase in aquatic insect abundance, as the mechanism driving the positive association between open canopy and juvenile abundance and growth in some salmonid species. in the present study, a direct effect of in- stream vegetation was not observed. however, we do find significant negative associations between in- stream vegetation and both small woody debris and over- head canopy cover in the sites studied here (table 5). only nine of the 351 reaches in this study lacked in- stream vegetation and these obser- vations were combined with reaches containing up to 10% in- stream vegetation prior to the regression modelling analysis. in addition, over 60% of the reaches in this study had 20% or more in- stream vegetation coverage. the ubiquitous presence of in- stream vegetation may have reduced our ability to identity its direct effect on relative juvenile abun- dance, but we would attribute the negative effects of overhead canopy coverage and small woody debris to be indicative of the effects these habitat characteristics have on a reduction in in- stream vegetation. a single season of field data was examined in this study; however, ju- venile fish habitat associations can vary year to year (fausch, hawkes, & parsons, 1988; flitcroft, burnett, snyder, reeves, & ganio, 2012) due to a response to environmental conditions (arnekleiv, finstad, & rønning, 2006), the strength and distribution of the adult spawner abundance (anderson, kiffney, pess, & quinn, 2008; finstad, einum, ugedal, & forseth, 2009; flitcroft, burnett, snyder, reeves, & ganio, 2014) or intra-  and interspecific competition for resources (gibson, bowlby, & amiro, 2008; pess et al., 2011; rosenfeld, leiter, linder, & rothman, 2005). while the results shown here are generally consistent with previ- ous studies and the ecology of the big lake drainage, additional insight into cohort- specific habitat preferences could be gained by re- examining these associations at varying levels of cohort strength and among years that demonstrate various flow and temperature regimes. driven primar- ily by groundwater influx, the big lake system is relatively stable, and we would expect the patterns observed here to broadly hold across years. recent work has demonstrated the relative importance of site lo- cation within a river network as an important predictor of both juvenile and adult coho relative abundance (anlauf- dunn, ward, strickland, & jones, 2014; flitcroft et al., 2012; mcmillian, liermann, starr, pess, & augerot, 2013). results presented here broadly agree with those found elsewhere. juvenile coho salmon were observed at higher abun- dances in fish creek, which is downstream of meadow creek. we did not, however, consider site- specific location in the present study as the primary objective was to observe reach- scale habitat associations and the use of mixed- effect models appropriately considered spatial correlations inherent in the study design. the models developed here indicated age- specific habitat association behaviours, knowledge of which may assist in the characterisation and pri- oritisation of aquatic habitats for restoration projects by improving manag- ers’ ability to forecast the benefits of preservation or restoration projects. for example, we found that in the big lake drainage, juvenile age- 0 coho salmon respond positively to wide stream sections with little canopy cov- erage or woody debris present. wide stream sections in this low- gradient wetland- dominated system are characterised by abundant macrophyte vegetation, and based upon anecdotal field observations, we suggest that these habitats may provide good foraging opportunities abundant with macroinvertebrate assemblages for rearing age- 0 coho salmon. in contrast to a preference for wide, shallow reaches, we found that 1+ juvenile coho salmon were relatively more abundant in deeper water sections. given the numerical dominance of the age- 0 fish and the tendency for juvenile coho in the big lake system to smolt after a single year in freshwater, prioriti- sation of projects to restore or conserve habitats preferred by age- 0 fish may ultimately generate greater population benefit, although additional field study would be necessary to confirm habitat preference behaviours across a wider range of system conditions (e.g. cohort abundance levels, warm versus cool years, wet versus dry years, etc.). acknowledgements we thank ronald barry (university of alaska fairbanks) for helpful dis- cussions on the analyses. we would also like to thank caroline walls who led the habitat data collection in the field, the numerous other field bradley et al.technicians involved in the project and private landowners within the big lake drainage that provided land access. funding for this project was provided, in part, by the alaska sustainable salmon fund. the find- ings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the u.s. fish and wildlife service. references alaska department of fish and game (2016). fish resource monitor. fish passage inventory database- interactive mapping. alaska: department of fish and game. http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishpas- sage.mapping [accessed april 15, 2016]. alaska department of labor and workforce development (2016). alaska population projections 2015 to 2045. juneau: state of alaska. 107 pp. http://labor.alaska.gov/research/pop/ projected/pub/popproj.pdf anderson, j. h., kiffney, p. m., pess, g. r., & quinn, t. p.
