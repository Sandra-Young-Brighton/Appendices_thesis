e-mail: lisa. heermann@uni-koeln.de accepted for publication may 13, 2009 introduction in temperate areas, the seasonal availability of food affects the energy storage of many animals, and cycles of accumulation and depletion of energy reserves are evident in many invertebrates (dratnal et al. 1993), ﬁshes (weatherley & gill 1987; larson 1991), birds (drent & daan 1980) and mammals (mrosovsky 1976). there is a trade-off in energy allocation to reproduction or maintenance, especially for long-lived species (karlsson et al. 2008). the reserves stored before wintertime help to sustain individuals through periods of food shortage, but also inﬂuence the amount of energy allocated to reproduction in spring (weatherley & gill 1987; larson 1991; schultz et al. 1991). larger individuals of any given age-class tend to have relatively larger energy stores (oliver et al. 1979; thompson et al. 1991; huss et al. 2008), which means that mortality is often size selective, affecting smaller individuals more quickly (post & evans 1989; grifﬁths & kirkwood 1995). however, the relatively large amount of stored energy is not the only factor which beneﬁts larger individuals. a larger body size is also assumed to be an advantage (i) because depletion rates of energy stores can be expected to decrease in larger individuals with respect to the allometric scaling of metabolic rates (schmidt- nielsen 1984; calder 1996), (ii) because it enhances the availability of proﬁtable food that cannot be captured by smaller siblings (e.g., keast & eadie 1985), and (iii) because vulnerability to predation strongly decreases with increasing size (e.g., persson et al. 2004). consequently, winter mortality and the recruitment to the adult stage strongly depends on size, forming a crucial bottleneck for various species (toneys & coble 1979; bystro¨m et al. 1998; biro et al. 2004; daunt et al. 2007; smith 2007). this has been shown for many ﬁsh species, such as largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides), pikeperch (sander lucioperca), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) and arctic charr (salvelinus_alpinus) (toneys & coble 1979; biro 1997; post et al. 1998; lappa- lainen et al. 2000; biro et al. 2004; bystro¨m et al. 2006). in addition to size-dependent effects on the recruit- ment of juveniles to the adult population, the duration of the winter, the period of ice coverage (lappalainen et al. 2000) or temperature during winter (bystro¨m et al. 2006) can inﬂuence winter mortality. the 560 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00371.x during winter, ﬁsh have been found to decrease their activity (wang & eckmann 1994) and to reduce or even stop food uptake (gibson 1978; cunjak 1988); they then rely on their energy stores (garvey et al. 2004). the main energy stores of ﬁsh are fat, protein and glycogen, of which the latter provides the ﬁrst and fastest energy reserve. after the depletion of glycogen, fat and ﬁnally protein are metabolised (see also collins & anderson 1995). in many freshwater ﬁshes, the major energy reserve lipid was shown to vary with size, with smaller individuals regularly having a lower lipid content (sogard & olla 2000; biro et al. 2004; borcherding et al. 2007). further, resource consumed during summer may inﬂuence accumulated energy contents in ﬁsh (craig et al. 1999; xu et al. 2001). for example, niva (1999) showed that the lipid content (salmo_trutta) clearly of piscivorous brown_trout exceeded that of insectivorous ones. the type of previous studies on perch populations (e.g., heermann 2008; urbatzka et al. 2008) have shown that under certain conditions between 1 and 10% of the young-of-the-year (yoy), perch (perca ﬂuviatlis) become piscivorous at an early stage (‡28 mm), preying on bream larvae (abramis brama) (beeck et al. 2002). feeding on this high-energetic resource led to higher growth rates of piscivorous perch than of planktivorous ones. soon, piscivorous perch exceeded their planktivorous in length, which in turn enabled cannibalism. consequently, cannibalising perch had reached sizes of up to 180 cm after their ﬁrst summer, while planktivorous perch were much smaller (smallest perch 32 mm) (beeck et al. 2002; heermann siblings energy storage and winter mortality of perch 2008; urbatzka et al. 2008). piscivorous yoy perch not only differed in size but also in morphological traits and fertility after the ﬁrst winter (beeck et al. 2002; heermann et al. 2007). the aim of this study was to obtain further information on the advantages of being bigger, with particular focus on size-dependent energy storage and depletion and their effects on survival during winter. therefore, we studied the energy reserves and mortality of three size classes of yoy perch in pond experiments. to support the ﬁeld data, we conducted additional laboratory experiments in which yoy perch were starved or fed at different amounts. thus, we could obtain data on mortality rates, the usage of energy stores (e.g., glycogen, fat, protein) and on the inﬂuence of food supply during winter. we hypothesised that the different feeding histories of the size classes are also reﬂected in the amount of accumulated energy reserves. thus, energy reserves of larger individuals would be depleted later in winter than those of smaller perch. consequently, this would lead to higher mortality rates and lower recruitment of smaller individuals after the ﬁrst winter. materials and methods pond experiments we used four ponds (0.4–0.7 ha, see table 1) at a ﬁsh farm in lohmar, germany (50°49¢34.00¢¢n, 7°12¢59.42¢¢e) to conduct ﬁeld experiments. the ponds are maximally two meters deep and oligo- to mesotrophic;

this was not necessary for large perch due to prior counting. pond one (p1) and two (p2) were stocked with only large (mean tl = 101–186 mm) or small perch (mean tl = 43–70 mm) respectively (table 1). to create a possible cannibalism situation (which had formed the perch population before the experiment and led to the development of the different size cohorts) and to observe the inﬂuence of possible interaction between different size classes, we stocked p3 with large and small perch (1 large:9 small). p4 was stocked with small and medium-sized (mean tl = 71–100 mm) perch (1:9) to determine whether medium-sized perch can also cannibalise during winter. persson et al. (2004) reported that cannibalism was possible until the prey 562 had reached 45% of the size of the cannibalising perch (see also do¨rner & wagner 2003, who suggested that prey could be up to 59% of the cannibal’s size). therefore, cannibalism would have been likely at least for the largest medium-sized perch in this study. in the pond experiments, four ponds with four different treatments were used. thus, the treatment and the pond effect might be confounded. however, as we know from previous studies in the ponds, they are all very similar in their abiotic variables, and the devel- opment of perch was documented to be similar in different ponds with the same treatment (compare urbatzka et al. 2008; heermann 2008). thus, the pond effect is assumed to be of minor importance for the presented results. in march 2006, the experiments were terminated by extracting the ﬁsh from the ponds. all ponds were emptied completely, thus the total biomass of ﬁsh per pond could be obtained. we took three to four subsamples (about 200–700 ﬁsh per sample) per pond which were then deep-frozen at )20 °c. perch of these subsamples were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. thus, the number of perch per subsample, but also the mass of each subsample were known. data of each subsample were used to calculate a mean size distribution of perch and the mean number of perch per kg for each pond. using the total biomass of ﬁsh per pond, we calculated individuals per ha for each pond. the loss of ﬁsh during the season was then calculated for each size class separately as percentage loss of individuals per ha. temperature data were obtained from a weather station at du¨sseldorf airport (51°16¢47.52¢¢n, 6°45¢ 53.98¢¢e), germany, which is about 50 km from the ﬁeld study site. water and air temperature are signif- icantly correlated to each other (heermann 2003), and the mean values of water temperature in 2005 ⁄ 2006 could be calculated using the regression from heer- mann (2003) and air temperature in du¨sseldorf as an independent variable. the ponds were at least partly covered with ice in 2005 ⁄ 2006 for a period of 91 days (mid-december to mid-march, see fig. 1). the mean water temperature was about 3.3 °c. ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t 20 10 0 –10 ice coverage mean temperature min. / max. temperature 6 0 t c o 6 0 v o n 6 0 c e d 7 0 b

we brought all size classes that had developed in the ponds (range of size: small 43– 70 mm, medium 71–100 mm, large 101–186 mm) to the laboratory. before starting the experiments, perch were given 2 days of acclimatisation in the laboratory and were then transferred to nine 60-l aquaria; three aquaria per size class were each stocked with either 20 ﬁsh (small perch) or ﬁve ﬁsh (medium-sized and large perch). fish were starved for 140 days; the mortality was monitored every 1–2 days, and dead ﬁsh were removed, weighed and frozen at )20 °c. in 2006 ⁄ 2007, experiments started and ended on the same date as in 2005 ⁄ 2006, and ﬁsh used for experiments were bred in the ponds in a similar manner as described above. in this winter, we used only the small size cohort (range of size 40–62 mm). three aquaria per treatment were each stocked with 20 ﬁsh. the three treatments differed in the quantity of food offered: the ﬁsh were fed daily with frozen cyclops spp. with biomasses of either 1.5%, 3% or 6% of the mean wet body mass of ﬁsh in each aquarium. as in the previous year, the experiments lasted for 140 days; we checked the mortality every 1–2 days, and dead ﬁsh were frozen at )20 °c. the experiments were conducted in a room which was slowly cooled to 8 °c after the arrival of the experimental ﬁsh. as perch reduce their feeding activity at low temperatures (see e.g., craig 1977; jamet 1994), the experiments were performed at 8 °c, which was slightly higher than the temperature in the ponds. this should guarantee a minimum of feeding activity in the aquaria, because perch once transferred to aquaria tended to be more-or-less inactive at low temperatures (j. borcherding, personal communication). we wanted to avoid total inactivity, as this was not to be expected from the ponds (e.g., wang & eckmann 1994). in addition, winter temper- atures of the previous years were considerably higher than in the exceptionally cold winter of 2005 ⁄ 2006. for ﬁsh, energy depletion increases with increasing water temperature (schultz & conover 1999), and thus more rapid starvation is to be expected for the laboratory experiments at 8 °c compared to starva- tion processes in the ﬁeld at lower temperatures. this must be kept in mind when comparing mortality rates and energy depletion of the experiments to ﬁeld data. however, in mortality rates between size classes of both the ﬁeld and the laboratory experiments are assumed to be compara- ble. we kept ﬁsh at a 11:13 day:night regime, which equals the mean day–light ratio from october to relative differences energy storage and winter mortality of perch march in germany. however, perch might have experienced more light under laboratory conditions, as ice covered the ponds during the experiments in 2005 ⁄ 2006. at the end of the experiments in both years, ﬁsh were killed by a blow to the head and frozen. they were used for lipid, glycogen and protein analyses, as well as for weighing and measuring. the cumulative mortality rate was graphed against time. analyses of body composition to determine which energy stores in perch are important during winter and to what extent they had been depleted, we analysed fat, glycogen and protein. a total of 14–20 ﬁsh per size class of the stocked ﬁsh in 2005, 15–40 ﬁsh per size class of the ﬁsh samples from the ponds in 2006 and the ﬁsh of the laboratory experiments (start: 14–20 per size class in 2005, 15– 38 per size class in 2006; end of the experiments: 15– 44 per treatment in 2006, 20 per treatment in 2007) were used for the analyses, which were conducted after the ﬁsh had been gutted and the head and ﬁns removed (refer to borcherding et al. 2007). samples of perch in autumn and spring were taken at the time of ﬁsh extraction (in autumn from the ponds in which ﬁsh were produced prior to the experiments). imme- diately after ﬁsh had passed the outlet, they were killed by a strong blow to the head and deep-frozen at )20 °c. a depletion of glycogen in muscles due to stress, while catching, can thus be assumed to be minor. if necessary, two to ﬁve smaller ﬁsh were pooled to obtain the necessary amount of tissue (about 1.5 g). this applied to most of the small perch, but none to the medium-sized and large perch. dead ﬁsh were never pooled together with ﬁsh alive for one sample. instead, dead or alive ﬁsh were pooled separately and it was ensured that only ﬁsh that had died on the same day or on dates close to each other (1–2 days difference) were analysed as one sample. as the equipment used was not suitable for homog- enising more than 10 g of tissue at a time, larger perch could not be used as a whole. instead, the ﬁsh was cut into pieces and sections of the ﬁsh (the anterior, middle and posterior part) were taken, homogenised and ﬁnally analysed as described below. for measuring fat, glycogen and lipids, ﬁsh material was carefully homogenised and analysed using mid- infrared transmission spectroscopy (elvingsson & sjauna 1992) with equipment (miris ab, uppsala, sweden) calibrated for ﬁsh tissue (for further details see bystro¨m et al. 2006). results were noted as grams per ﬁsh. if ﬁsh had to be pooled for analyses, concentrations of energy reserves were expressed at the individual level of the average perch size of the sample, with estimated lipid concentration divided by 563 heermann et al. number of individuals in the sample (as according to bystro¨m et al. 2006). in the laboratory, all perch of the small size class died in winter 2005 ⁄ 2006, while only four of the medium and one of the large perch died. we removed the latter two groups from further calculations. in 2006 ⁄ 2007, almost all of the ﬁsh in one of the three aquaria fed with 1.5% food died within the ﬁrst month because they did not accept frozen cyclops spec. as food; none of the ﬁsh from this aquarium was used for any calculations. by the end of the second laboratory experiment, most perch had died (129 of 160 consid- ered for further analyses). as some small ﬁsh had to be pooled to obtain enough material for analyses of body components, only two to seven data points of living ﬁsh per treatment were available. as this was not enough to calculate reliable statistics, only dead perch were considered for further calculations. statistics to see if the amount of food fed in the laboratory had any inﬂuence on the mortality rate in the laboratory, ﬁrst the cumulative mortality of perch was graphed against time for each aquarium (three replicates per treatment for 0%, 3% and 6%, two for 1.5%). we ﬁtted each graph using the software origin 7.5 with the boltzmann function for sigmoid curves, which resulted in the best ﬁt (r2 for each ﬁt between 0.89 and 0.99). the equation for the ﬁt is the following:  ! y ¼ a1   a2 dxð x x0 1 þ e þ þ a2; where a1 = initial value, a2 = ﬁnal value, x0 = centre of the sigmoidal curve, dx = time constant. the number of days when 25%, 50% and 75% of the ﬁsh had died was calculated using the correspond- ing ﬁtted parameters. we then compared the calculated results using an anova and tukey-hsd (see norf et al. 2007) after ensuring that data were normally distributed (shapiro–wilk test) and that variances were equal (levene test). size-dependent mortality within the small cohort for both the laboratory and pond experiments was tested by regressing the size of ﬁsh with the period of starvation (days until ﬁsh died) using pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. differences in the mortality of perch in the ﬁeld at the end of the experiments were tested with chi-squared tests. as ﬁsh weight loss can exceed lipid loss by several orders in starving experiments, estimated lipid mass is compared with ﬁsh length rather than to body mass (bystro¨m et al. 2006). for ﬁeld perch, differences of fat, protein and glycogen contents were then tested for 564 each size class separately using an ancova with the length as covariate (bystro¨m et al. 2006); differences between the groups were tested with bonferroni post hoc tests. for the laboratory experiments, however, the mean length of the ﬁsh, as well as mean fat, protein and glycogen values were calculated for each aquar- ium to avoid pseudo-replication in the following statistical comparison (hurlbert 1984). these mean values as well as data of individual perch from the start of the experiment were tested with an ancova (length of perch as covariate) after ensuring that all data were normally distributed (shapiro–wilk test) and variances were equal (levene test). mortality of different size classes of perch in the laboratory were tested with chi- squared tests. origin 7.5 (originlab, northampton, usa), spss 15.0 (spss corp., chicago, usa) and winstat (microsoft corp., redmond, usa) were used for all analyses. results body composition in the pond experiments, fat and protein were positively correlated to the size of the perch, and the greatest changes in energy reserves over winter appeared within the small size cohort of perch. small perch that had survived the winter showed a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of fat, glycogen and (except for small perch from p4 in which the protein content did not change) also protein compared with measurement of the levels before stocking (table 2, fig. 2). medium-sized perch in p4 had increased glycogen values, while the fat and protein content did not change (table 2). large perch in p3 lost fat but gained glycogen; protein remained the same, whereas the values of large perch in p2 did not change over winter (table 2, fig. 2). in the laboratory experiments, starved small perch had signiﬁcantly lower values of fat compared with measurements before the start of experiments (table 2, fig. 3). the changes for protein and glycogen were most distinct within the small size cohort. protein decreased signiﬁcantly, while glycogen increased signiﬁcantly compared with measurements before the start of experiments (table 2, fig. 3). the minimum values lay around 0.01 g fat, 0.05 g protein and the maximum value for glycogen around 0.04 g (these values refer to fig. 3, and will also be discussed later on as percentages of the ﬁsh’s biomass). fat and protein in starving large and medium-sized perch were signiﬁcantly lower than before the start of experiments (table 2). the increase in glycogen was also signif- icant, but was not as distinct in larger perch as in small and medium-sized perch. in the second laboratory experiment, the protein content had decreased signif- icantly in all small perch that had been fed (table 2,

with cyclops spp. equalling 1.5% of the perch’s body mass had died. ninety percentage of the small perch that were fed with 3% and 68% of the ones that were fed with 6% had died after 140 days (fig. 4). com- paring the number of days until 50% of the perch had died showed that the mortality of perch fed with 6% occurred signiﬁcantly later than for the starving perch (anova: f3,7 = 4.843, p = 0.039; tukey-hsd test: 6% < 0%). the same was found for the date by which 75% had died (anova: f3,7 = 11.849, p = 0.040; tukey-hsd test: 6% < 0%), but not for 25%, for which no signiﬁcant difference could be detected (anova: f3,7 = 1.113, p = 0.406). perch fed with 3% and 1.5% did not differ in mortality rate from either starving perch or perch fed with 6%. discussion body composition in the present laboratory and pond experiments, protein and fat stores at the start of the experiment were always positively related to the size of perch. this was also shown in other studies on energy reserves of ﬁshes (brett & groves 1979; thompson et al. 1991; schultz & conover 1997; sogard & olla 2000), explaining why size is a crucial factor for surviving the ﬁrst winter (huss et al. 2008). prior to the present experiments, the monitoring of the devel- opment of perch showed that larger perch had been piscivorous several months before the start of the experiments, while their small siblings had fed on plankton and benthos and medium-sized perch mainly on benthic organisms (heermann 2008). the different food resources previously consumed resulted in the development of different size classes (via different growth rates; compare urbatzka et al. 2008; heer- mann 2008) and hence led to size-dependent energy reserves. not only do initial energy reserves differ depending on body size, but small ﬁsh also use their energy stores at higher rates (miranda & hubbard 1994; schultz & conover 1999). correspondingly, the present study showed that the most distinct changes of fat, protein and glycogen occurred within the small size cohort of perch. the lethal limit of lipid was about 0.01 g, which corresponds to about 2% of the ﬁsh’s biomass, while the lethal limit of protein was 0.05 g, corre- sponding to about 9% of the biomass. newsome & leduc (1975) showed that perch died when the fat content decreased to <2%, which was also found in our laboratory experiments (for both fed and starving perch). in starving ﬁsh, the glycogen is used up ﬁrst, then the fat, and ﬁnally muscle protein will be transferred into energy (jobling 1980; collins & anderson 1995; evans & claiborne 2006). however, protein and glycogen were not analysed by newsome & leduc (1975). in the present study, the lowest level of protein content of dead perch was around 9%. to the best of our knowledge, such lethal minimal protein concentrations have not been described before. the changing levels of glycogen can supply addi- tional information on the energetic status of perch. the glycogen content of the starved perch was distinctly higher at the end of the experiments, suggesting a mobilisation of energy in the body. glycogen is a form of carbohydrate usually present in the liver and in energy storage and winter mortality of perch the glycogen level muscle tissue if the ﬁsh has been feeding well (me´ndez & wieser 1993; hall et al. 2006) and is thus a good indicator of the nutritional state. however, while studying starving golden perch (maquaria ambigua), collins & anderson (1995) found an initial decrease of followed by an increase, even though the ﬁsh were still starving, indicating the mobilisation of other energy reserves. similar results have also been detected for rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss, kiessling et al. 1991). a comparable observation was also made in our labora- tory experiments, in which the glycogen of small perch had increased to relatively high levels (for unfed perch to about 0.04 g), irrespective of food quantity (little or none). for ﬁsh which were starving but still alive, glycogen levels increased to 0.30 g for large and to 0.13 g for medium-sized perch. here, the increase in glycogen probably indicates a bad constitution of the ﬁsh (evans & claiborne 2006). in the pond experiments, the condition of the small perch was not optimal for surviving the winter, as their fat stores were already low in autumn (about 1.5%). however, small perch that survived the winter were able to rebuild their energy stores, whereas the fat and protein contents of larger perch did not change signiﬁcantly. this increase in energy stores of small perch might have been due to size-selective mortality; perch which were in the best condition during autumn survived the winter, while those in worse condition died. however, our results show that energy stores were accumulated over winter for the whole size range of small perch, documenting that the largest perch of the small cohort could not rebuild their energy reserves. in fact, small perch were able to keep their level of feeding during winter, while medium-sized and large perch ate signiﬁcantly less (heermann 2008), as has also been found for arctic char (salvelinus_alpinus) (bystro¨m et al. 2006). food uptake probably allowed those slightly larger perch of the small size cohort that had survived the winter to rebuild their energy stores over winter, so that they were in better condition after winter than they were in autumn (for small perch, fat increased from about 1.5% per 0.02 g to 3.2% per 0.06 g, and protein from about 0.23 to 0.33 g). this is in accordance with the results of kirjasniemi & valtonen (1997a), who measured increasing fat and protein levels in pike- perch when ﬁsh were fed during winter. in addition to changes in lipid and protein content, all size classes of perch in the ponds had slightly higher glycogen levels after winter than before. while the increase in glycogen levels in the laboratory perch reﬂected a poorer condition, the gain in glycogen here (which was not as strong as in the laboratory and was accompanied an increase in fat and protein) might be more attributable to an improvement in the perch’s 567 heermann et al. condition (see also me´ndez & wieser 1993; hall et al. 2006). mortality rates in the present study, accumulated energy reserves in autumn and depletion rates over winter were shown to be size-dependent, resulting in size-dependent mor- tality rates. mortality in medium-sized and large perch was low, whereas small perch suffered from higher mortality rates even if they were fed with low amounts of food. however, mortality rates were also inﬂuenced by food uptake during winter, in such a way that perch which were fed small amounts of food had a signiﬁcantly lower mortality rate (noticeable after a time lag of several days) than unfed ﬁsh. in accordance with results described in many other studies on winter mortality (e.g., post et al. 1998; biro et al. 2004; bystro¨m et al. 2006), size-dependent mortality rates also occurred during the present laboratory experiments, with all of the small starving perch having died after 136 days. in contrast, only 7% of the medium-sized perch and 1.7% of the large perch had died by the end of the experiment. size- dependent mortality occurred not only between size cohorts but also within the small cohort. here, small ﬁsh in both treatments (starved or fed with small amounts of food) died in a size-dependent manner, with the smallest ﬁsh dying earlier than the only slightly larger individuals. mortality of ﬁsh has been shown to decrease when the ﬁsh are fed (thompson et al. 1991; kirjasniemi & valtonen 1997b; pangle et al. 2004) due to reduced rate of energy store depletion (see bystro¨m et al. 2006). correspondingly, the laboratory experiments in the present study demonstrated that a certain amount of food (6% of the body weight) was needed before the mortality signiﬁcantly decreased. in addition, the effect only became obvious after several days, in this case when 50% of the ﬁsh had died (for starving perch after 73 days, for perch fed with 6% after 100 days). later on, the decrease in mortality with food intake became more distinct (for starving perch after 86 days, for perch fed with 6% after 128 days). in the ponds, small perch also suffered from high mortality during winter, while large perch were hardly affected by mortality. in correlation, energy reserves of small perch in autumn were already poor; this autumn malnourishment could explain the higher mortality rates of small perch (up to 71%) compared with those of medium-sized (6%) and large perch (11%). how- ever, the mean size of small perch in the ponds also increased signiﬁcantly over winter, whereas it did not change for large and medium-sized perch. this could be due to growth (karas 1990; foy & paul 1999) or to size-selective mortality within the small size cohort. a 568 winter increase in length has been found to be related to size-dependent mortality in ﬁshes (toneys & coble 1979). accordingly, our results indicated that the smallest individuals within the small size cohort perch in the laboratory experiments died even when con- suming 6% of their body mass, and a signiﬁcant decrease in mortality of this experimental group became obvious only after 70 days. this size-selective mortality and the decrease of mortality over time can be assumed to have also occurred for the smallest perch in the ponds during autumn and early winter. feeding at a low level would support only the largest individuals within the total group of small-sized perch. as laboratory results revealed that feeding delays starvation, it can be assumed that by keeping food uptake at a certain level, small perch compensated for low reserves and probably avoided even higher mortality rates. in autumn, large perch were cannibalising their smaller siblings before our winter experiments (heer- mann 2008). thus, it would have been likely to have seen differences in mortality of small perch between ponds in which cannibalism was possible and those in which it was not. however, no additional mortality due to cannibalism could be observed (same mortality with or without cannibals), which might also be attributable to the reduced feeding activity of large perch in winter (heermann 2008). thus, small perch might not have been threatened by cannibalism during winter, but by starving. other reasons for increased mortality could also be parasitism and ⁄ or predation by piscivorous birds. parasitism in perch was not documented in this study, thus the possibility that observed mortality rates partly include damage caused by parasitism cannot be excluded. however, mortality due to parasitism is considered to be of minor importance for this study. the ponds were covered with ice for a long period, hence mortality of perch due to piscivorous avian predators was also minimised during the winter 2005 ⁄ 2006. however, the total mortality without ice coverage would have been much higher due to avian predation, as it has been observed for different size classes of perch in the same ponds during further winter experiments (heermann 2008). in summary, we can state that the feeding history of perch prior to winter is clearly reﬂected in their accumulated energy reserves. energy stores were metabolised size dependently, with the largest changes in energy reserves over winter found within the small size cohort of perch. lethal minimal limits of reserves were 2% of the ﬁsh’s biomass for fat and 9% for protein. food uptake by the small size cohort in winter was able to reduce mortality rates, and small perch which survived the winter were in better condition than they had been in autumn. however, mortality rates of up to 71% for the small size cohort in the ﬁeld were clearly size-dependent, due to lower accumula- tion of energy and higher depletion rates for smaller individuals. in studies on the bimodality within the yoy age cohort of perch, the larger male perch already matured after the ﬁrst winter (beeck et al. 2002) and the smaller perch were not able to catch up in size; the bimodality within the year class can thus be followed over several years, with the larger perch being mainly cannibalistic (beeck 2003). these advantages seem to be even more pronounced when one considers that most of the large perch in our study survived their ﬁrst winter, while only a marginal part of the small perch endured the winter. acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge ﬁshing support from the ﬁsh farm
