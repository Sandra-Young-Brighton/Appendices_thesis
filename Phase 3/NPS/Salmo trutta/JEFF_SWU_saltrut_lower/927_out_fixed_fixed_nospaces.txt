quinn 1993). such restricted homing behaviour limits gene ﬂow between populations and promotes the formation of distinct populations that often exhibit both genetic and phenotypic adaptations to local environment (taylor 1991; quinn 1993; stearns & hendry 2004). a number of studies focused on population genetic structure have between river and have documented signiﬁcant genetic heterogeneity and genetic structuring (e.g. investigated systems among populations mora´n et al. 1995; king et al. 2001; hawkins et al. 2002). as a result of these studies, a negative relationship between gene ﬂow and geographical distance among populations suggest that isolation by distance (ibd) is applicable and the degree of such a relationship is variable dependent on the geographical distance among populations (reviewed by hendry et al. 2004). because gene ﬂow would be most likely to occur among neighbouring populations, it has been thought that ibd could be hard to ﬁnd at ﬁne scale such as within a river system (mora´n et al. 1995; hansen & mensberg 1998; bouza et al. 1999). however, recent studies have documented that ibd could be applicable in some species even at ﬁne scale (primmer et al. 2006; neville et al. 2007) and, in consequence, stream-distance hierarchy of genetic structure has been revealed (utter 2001; dionne et al. 2008). description of genetic structure at various spatial scales is becoming important because under- standing the extent of genetic structure might facilitate to identify which evolutionary or ecological factors inﬂuence genetic structure (dionne et al. 2008). however, ﬁne-scale genetic structure is an emerging doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00325.x 65 kitanishi et al. ﬁeld and the knowledge of genetic structure at ﬁne scale has been limited (hendry et al. 2004). masu salmon, oncorhynchus_masou, has natal homing and precision of their homing is thought to be relatively high (kato 1991). population genetic studies of masu salmon using allozyme and mitochondrial dna have also suggested that each population or regional group might be genetically distinct due to precise homing behaviour (okazaki 1986; kitanishi et al. 2007). these studies indicated that masu salmon have the potential to show genetic differentiation and genetic structure at ﬁne scale; therefore, masu salmon is an useful species for addressing genetic structure at ﬁne scale. in the present study, we investigated the population genetic structure of masu salmon at a small spatial scale using eight microsatellite dna loci. materials and methods the atsuta river, located in mid-west hokkaido, is 136.5 km2 in watershed and approximately 34 km long (fig. 1). this river has been closed to ﬁshing for approximately 40 years due to ﬁshing regulations and there is no record of artiﬁcial release of masu salmon. in addition, this river has no artiﬁcial constructions such as weir and dam. therefore, samples analysed in this study were less inﬂuenced by human activity and we considered them to be native. to understand better the genetic structure (garant et al. 2000) and to avoid sampling families rather than populations (hansen et al. 1997), the sampled specimens represent adult ﬁsh returning to spawn. a total of 280 anadromous individuals were collected from seven tributaries of the atsuta river between 2003 and 2006 using electro- ﬁshing in each tributary (table 1). an adipose ﬁn of each individual was removed and preserved in 99% ethanol at 3 °c. genomic dna was extracted from the adipose ﬁn using the reagent chelex 100 (bio rad, ca, usa) according to the manufacture’s instructions and stored in 80–100 ll of distilled water after ethanol precipitation. eight microsatellite loci developed from other salmonids (olsen et al. 2000;

(2003). pcr product was analysed using abi prism 3100 genetic analyser. fragment size data were collected using gene scan analysis version 3.7 (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, u.s.a.) fol- lowed by manual corrections. observed (ho) and expected (he) heterozygosity were calculated using genepop 3.4 (raymond & rousset 1995). within-population genetic diversity was calculated by using the allelic richness corrected by the sample size (el mousadik & petit 1996), using fstat 2.9.3 (goudet 2001). deviations from hardy– weinberg equilibrium (hwe) and linkage disequilib- rium were examined using genepop, with 500 batches and 1000 iterations per batch. allelic homo- geneity among populations was tested using the in genepop. the extent of fisher’s exact differentiation among populations was quantiﬁed by fst (weir & cockerham 1984) and the signiﬁcance of fst values were obtained by 10,000 permutations using arlequin 2.000 (schneider et al. 2000). the signiﬁcance levels for multiple testing were corrected following the false discovery rate (fdr) (benjamini & yekutieli 2001). test to assess the population relationship, principal components analysis (pca) was performed using pcagen (goudet 1999). ibd was also examined by regressing pairwise genetic differentiation and geo- graphical distance (km). geographical distance was measured based on the stream distance separating each population pair and fst ⁄ (1)fst) was used as the genetic differentiation, as it is more appropriate than fst for a stepping-stone model of migration (rousset 1997). correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distance was tested by using mantel test with 10,000 permutations, using the program isolde from genepop. all eight microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic in each population, with the number of alleles observed across all populations ranging from 6 (one 111) to 23 (one 110). the mean number of alleles (a) within populations and the average of allelic richness (ar) within populations ranged from 8.7 to 11.4 and from 7.6 to 8.7, respectively. the number of private alleles (npa) within populations ranged from 0 to 4. average observed heterozygosity (ho) was relatively similar for each population, varying from 0.66 to 0.73 (table 2). tests for deviation from hwe showed a signiﬁcant global trend towards heterozygote deﬁ- ciency (p < 0.001) and six of seven populations exhibited signiﬁcant deviation from hwe following fdr (table 2; p = 0.019, k = 7). the global deﬁ- ciency was not caused by one particular locus, as 18 of 56 cases deviated signiﬁcantly and six of 56 after fdr (p = 0.0108, k = 56). genotypic linkage equilibrium test indicated no signiﬁcant linkages before and after fdr (p = 0.0137, k = 21); therefore, all loci were treated as independent. highly signiﬁcant genetic differentiation was observed among seven tributaries within the atsuta river (fisher’s exact test: p < 0.001), and the null hypothesis of single random mating population was rejected. for pairwise population comparisons, exact tests revealed that 19 of 21 comparisons were signiﬁcantly different at 5% level and 15 of 21 after fdr (table 3; p = 0.0137, k = 21). the levels of (fst) genetic differentiation between populations ranged between )0.0004 and 0.0161. fst values were signiﬁcantly greater than zero in 14 cases at the 5% level and in cases after fdr (p = 0.0137, k = 21). principal components analysis illustrated a well- supported geographical basis to population relation- ships (fig. 2). the ﬁrst principal component (pc1) axis explained 32% of the total genetic variance (p = 0.128), and the second (pc2) 19% (p = 0.912). overall fst was 0.0191 and signiﬁcantly greater than zero (p < 0.001). the test for ibd revealed a signif- icant positive correlation between genetic differentia- tion and geographical distance (fig. 3; mantel test: p = 0.0179, r = 0.622). discussion the present study is the ﬁrst to focus on population genetic structure of wild masu salmon within a river, and found that masu salmon can be subdivided genetically even within a river system. signiﬁcant genetic differentiation and genetic dissimilarity were observed, and the null hypothesis of single random mating population was rejected. the global level of genetic differentiation, as estimated by using fst, was 67 kitanishi et al. table 2. summary statistics for genetic variation at eight microsatellite loci in seven samples. table 2.

r = 0.622). genetic heterogeneity between tributary samples and signiﬁcant ibd imply that relatively stable discrete populations occur in the atsuta river and dispersal is more likely to occur between neighbouring popula- tions. previous studies reported high levels of genetic differentiation among masu salmon populations in hokkaido and indicated that each river population was probably genetically distinct (okazaki 1986; kitanishi et al. 2007). our results, therefore, also support the work of these studies, indicating that masu salmon exhibit ﬁne-scale population structure due to precise homing behaviour. several factors may contribute to this ﬁne-scale structure. first might be correlated with life history dependent on anadromous salmonids. some studies have suggested that the duration of a juvenile’s stay in their natal river probably raise the precision of homing (okazaki 1990; quinn 1993; utter 2001). as masu salmon spend at least 1 year in freshwater, genetic differentiation might be strongly maintained. second, anthropogenic effect, such as artiﬁcial construction and release of hatchery reared ﬁsh, could inﬂuence the genetic structure. for salmo- nids, it is recognized that fragmentation of habitats by weirs and dams could enhance genetic differentiation, and such fragmented populations obscure natural patterns of genetic structure at the within-river scale (hansen & mensberg 1998; bouza et al. 1999; yamamoto et al. 2004). in addition, artiﬁcial stocking from one drainage into another could lead to genetic introgression and indistinct genetic structure (nielsen et al. 1999; suzuki et al. 2000; utter 2001; caputo et al. 2004). in the atsuta river, there is no artiﬁcial construction and domesticated masu salmon have not been released in the past. thus, the clear genetic structure we observed at the microgeographical scale is apparently a natural feature of masu salmon in the atsuta river. within-river genetic structure of masu salmon while relatively clear genetic structure was observed in the atsuta river populations, partially contrasting results were also observed in our results. for example, pairwise comparisons between at2 and four samples located on other tributaries (hid, mig, nae and det) did not show signiﬁcant genetic differentiation (fst), despite geographical distance (fig. 1). the luck of differentiation might result from sample size in the at2 (19 individuals), which gives only low statistical power for this comparison. another is that genetic differentiations between nae and other six samples did not represent a positive relationship between fst and geographical distance. this could be caused by the spawning behaviour of masu salmon. in the atsuta river, spawning redds of masu are build from upstream to downstream (sugiwaka et al. 1999). localized movement and downstream migration of adults dur- ing spawning season have been reported in other oncorhynchus species (burgner 1991; neville et al. 2006). these observations suggest that some individ- uals that bred in the upstream area migrate to the downstream for further mating opportunities. if so, samples captured in nae might consist of such dispersers as well as indigenous individuals. this could explain why nae did not show a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and geo- graphical distance. an interesting feature of this study was a signiﬁcant deviation from hwe. technical artefacts were unlikely to cause this heterozygote deﬁciency, because the observed deﬁciencies were not locus speciﬁc. sampling strategy could cause this deﬁciency, as we sampled only anadromous individuals. in the atsuta river, some males become anadromous, whereas others remain in river, and exclusion of nonanadrom- ous portion of populations could affect the results our study. differences in genetic diversity and population divergence between anadromous and nonanadromous salmonids have been reported (dewoody & avise 2000; tonteri et al. 2007). on the other hand, almost all females become anadromous form and mate with both forms of male. such promiscuous mating system of masu salmon would minimize the effect of only sampling anadromous individuals. alternatively, increased probability of relatedness among sampled individuals could explain these deﬁciencies in smaller tributaries (castric et al. 2001). sugiwaka et al. (1999) investigated a number of spawning redds of masu salmon in each tributary of the atsuta river from 1990 to 1994 and reported that the average number of spawning redds was 12.45 (ranged from 2 to 141). they also reported that each female constructs one or two spawning redds. according to their investigation, it might be thought that the number of spawners is relatively small. limited number of spawners could generate a wahlund effect due to genetic differences 69 kitanishi et al. among ﬁsh using different spawning ground at a given reproduction event in smaller tributaries. to conﬁrm this possibility, we are investigating larger rivers that have increased availability of spawning areas. salmonids species have intrinsically subdivided population structure due to their strong tendency to home to their natal river (taylor 1991; quinn 1993). masu salmon have highly variable morphology, behaviour and genetic composition at any geograph- ical scale, and the level of differentiation is likely to be inﬂuenced by some factors such as migration pattern and glaciation (okazaki 1986; kato 1991; kitanishi et al. 2007). from a conservation perspec- tive, understanding of genetic differentiation among populations and characterization of indigenous pop- ulations are important and provides valuable insight into hatchery activities (suzuki et al. 2000; kawam- ura et al. 2007). the results of this study imply that masu salmon have the potential to form discrete populations at the microgeographical scale, empha- sizing the importance of characterization of these discrete populations. acknowledgements we are grateful to itsuro koizumi and kaneaki edo for their helpful comments on the manuscript. we thank kenzi akiba, hirotake omiya, masanori nakagawa, kazuhiro nomoto,
