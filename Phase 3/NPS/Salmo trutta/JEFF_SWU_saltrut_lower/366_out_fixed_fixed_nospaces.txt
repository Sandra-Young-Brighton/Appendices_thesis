(g), wi = initial weight 1 ⁄ 3 ) wi 1 ⁄ 3) (t · dt) after 6 weeks, the planktivorous (tl mean ± sd; (tl mean ± sd; 54.9 ± 4.3 mm) and piscivorous 93.1 ± 6.2 mm) perch from the tanks were transferred (23.5 · 20 · 45 cm) and 40-l aquaria into 20-l (33 · 30 · 45 cm) (t 21 ± 1 °c, 9 h l:15 h d). to shorten the time of irritated behaviour after handling, all ﬁsh were accustomed to be moved to another aquarium every day during the next week. perch were fed with zooplankton and ﬁsh according to the pretreatment in the tanks, but starved at least 12 h prior the start of a trial. the behavioural trials were carried out in y-shaped aquaria as described by borcherding (2006). one arm of the aquarium contained artiﬁcial vegetation, food doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00473.x 1 heynen et al. was presented in the second arm (chosen randomly for (pike, esox lucius, every trial), and the predator 27 ± 2 cm) was placed in the third arm, excluded from the experimental arena through a transparent perfo- rated perspex pane. the experiments were conducted as repeated mea- surements. the behaviour of a group of four perch was assayed in the absence of a predator. following the same procedures, the behaviour of the group was re- assayed the subsequent day (approximately same time) in the presence of a predator. to evade pike odours in the predator-free runs, two identical y-shaped aquaria (plus equipment) were used, never mixing equipment or water from predator and predator-free-y-tank. each group, planktivorous and piscivorous perch was tested with each food, living ﬁsh larvae and living zooplankton (presented in a transparent perforated box). every combination was tested with and without predator and had six replicates. at the start of a trial, four perch were introduced to the vestibule (triangle where the three arms of the y meet). to diminish disturbance, all further measures were handled from outside the room. after an orientation time of 10 min, the barrier that enclosed the perch to the vestibule was lifted. the trial ended after another 30 min, by putting the barrier back in place. every behavioural experiment was recorded with a video camera. the videos were analysed with a computer programme, which recorded one behavioural unit every second (borcherding & magnhagen 2008). received data were used to calculate the time perch spent in the vegetation and open water compartment. activity was calculated as the number of changes between the experimental areas (vegetation, open water and vestibule) per time (30 min). predator inspection was deﬁned as a ﬁsh directly approaching the predator and dwelling in a right angle within two body length to the predator compartment. data were recorded and calculated for the whole group and then expressed as average-behaviour per perch. behavioural changes because of predator presence were analysed with a repeated measurement anova (predator as factor of the repeated design) with ‘time in vegetation’, inspection’ as dependent factors and presented food and pretreatment as independent factors. all statistics were conducted with spss 15.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). ‘activity’ or ‘predator the divergent pretreatments in this study induced crucial phenotypic changes in juvenile perch. the perch receiving zooplankton (35% body weight per day) grew steadily over the whole pretreatment period (planktivores: tgcweek1–3 = 0.30 ± 0.04; tgcweek3–6 = 0.43 ± 0.07), while the ﬁsh fed with ﬁsh larvae (23% body weight per day) grew predominantly during the last 3 weeks, where their tgc value increased nearly 2 (piscivores: the end of the dietary pretreatment fourfold tgcweek1–3 = 1.52 ± 0.26, tgcweek3–6 = 5.19 ± 0.92). a diet of ﬁsh supplies much more energy per consumed gram than does a diet of zooplankton (cf. borcherding et al. 2007), thus at in the tanks piscivorous (mean ± sd; tl = 101.0 ± 6.0 mm; weight = 12.7 ± 2.4 g) perch (mean ± sd; tl = 60.5 ± 4.0 mm; weight = 2.2 ± 0.5 g) differed in length and weight with plankti- vores being smaller (t-test, d.f. = 97, p < 0.01) and (t-test, d.f. = 97, p < 0.001). additionally, lighter piscivorous perch ended up with a slightly higher than planktivorous perch (t-test, condition factor d.f. = 97, pisci- vores = 1.22 ± 0.07, planktivores = 0.97 ± 0.06). planktivorous p < 0.001; condition factor: and beside the physiological divergence, the planktiv- orous and piscivorous yoy perch in this study showed clear behavioural differences, where dietary pretreatment, predator presence and the presented prey species in the trials affected the behaviour of the yoy perch (table 1). in the absence of a predator, planktivores displayed an overall high activity, while piscivores stayed primarily in the vegetation. previous experiments showed that sub- optimal in the trade-off between the need to forage and the seek for shelter and were observed to intensify activity and their search for food (e.g. borcherding & magnhagen 2008). as planktivorous perch had a than piscivorous slightly lower condition factor perch, the two groups documented when perch were introduced to the novel aquaria for time might be inﬂuenced by nutritional effects. the different activity patterns of differently nourished the ﬁrst behave ﬁsh avoidance when in the aquaria for the second time and in the presence of a predator, planktivorous perch decreased their activity, as was shown in many other studies on young perch where predator caused decreasing activity levels (e.g. bean & winﬁeld 1995). the piscivorous perch, however, increased their activity in the trials with a predator, but only with ﬁsh larvae as presented prey (table 1, fig. 1). corre- spondingly, the behaviour deﬁned as predator inspec- tion of piscivores almost exclusively occurred in the trials with predator and ﬁsh larvae as attractor (fig. 1). planktivorous perch in this study also inspected the predator compartment, but mostly in the trials with plankton as presented prey species, although less frequently than piscivores (table 1, fig. 1). prey size as well as prey condition was shown to promote predator inspection (kulling & milinski 1992). this indicates that the physiological condition, the previous experience (ﬁsh might feel safer, when in the aquaria for the second time) as well as the presence of their familiar resource might inﬂuence the divergent behav- iour of the pretreated ﬁsh. risk taking behaviour in juvenile perch table 1. results of the analyses of variance testing the effects of predator presence, pretreatment and presented food on the variables time in vegetation, activity and predator inspection. predator inspection activity d.f. f food predator pretreat food · predator food · pretreat predator · pretreat food · predator · pretreat 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.43 5.73 2.13 5.06 11.89 2.96 5.57 >p 0.25 0.03 0.17 0.04 0.001 0.11 0.03 d.f. f 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7.04 0.77 5.77 0.63 0.04 17.73 7.29 >p 0.02 0.39 0.03 0.44 0.84 0.001 0.01 the results signiﬁcant at a level of p < 0.05 are presented in italics. time in vegetation d.f. f 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0.28 3.87 0.51 0.11 2.11 10.38 1.83 >p 0.60 0.06 0.49 0.74 0.16 0.001 0.19 fig. 1. behaviour of piscivorous (black circles) and planktivorous (white circles) perch, in the absence and presence of a predator (pike), when the presented prey during the trials was plankton (left plots) or ﬁsh (right plots). behavioural patterns were deﬁned as predator inspection (number of times a perch started predator inspection, mean ± sd), activity (number of changes between compartments during a 30 min trial; mean ± sd) and time in vegetation (min a perch spend in the vegetated habitat; mean ± sd). although not signiﬁcant, these tendencies are also visible in habitat use. in the presence of a predator, both groups spent on average less time in the vegetated habitat, when their familiar resource was presented. especially under predation hazard, ﬁsh are generally known to carefully adjust their behaviour, trying to maximise the risk ⁄ reward relationship, where the attractiveness of a presented food ration might inﬂuence the willingness to take risks (skalski & gilliam 2002). fish have been shown to be more 3 heynen et al. effective in consuming a familiar resource (hughes et al. 1992) and need to learn to utilise a novel food type efﬁciently (magnhagen & staffan 2003). this suggests that ﬁsh in this study react primarily to the familiar prey, because they can consume it quickly and effectively, whereas utilising a novel prey under predation hazard might be considered as too risky. however, in predator absence, ﬁsh did not positively react to their familiar prey, indicating that the predator presence triggers the afﬁnity ⁄ reaction to the familiar resource. to conclude, this study showed that the consump- tion of different resources lead to speciﬁc physiolog- ical and behavioural changes in juvenile perch, suggesting that resource polymorphism might induce complex behavioural consequences, leading to pheno- typic differences in the behaviour during predator encounter. under natural conditions, these divergences might be mediated or even promoted by additional factors inﬂuencing the individual reaction like e.g. phenotypic ability, maternal effects or earlier experi- ences. acknowledgements we thank markus volpers who programmed the computer software to record behaviour. the experiments complied with the current laws of germany and were approved by the university of cologne. references bagenal, t.b. & tesch, f.w. 1978. age and growth. in: bagenal, t.b., ed. methods for assessment of ﬁsh production in fresh waters. oxford, london, edinburgh, melbourne: blackwell scientiﬁc pub., pp. 101–136. bean, c.w. & winﬁeld, i.j. 1995. habitat use and activity patterns of roach (rutilus rutilus (l.)), rudd (scardinius erythrophthalmus (l.)), perch (perca ﬂuviatilis (l.)) and pike (esox lucius (l.)) in laboratory: the role of predation threat and structural complexity. ecology of freshwater fish 4: 37–46. beeck, p., tauber, s., kiel, s. & borcherding, j. 2002. 0+ perch predation on 0+ bream: a case study on a eutrophic gravel pit lake. freshwater biology 47: 2359–2369. borcherding, j. 2006. prey or predator: piscivorous 0+ perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) in the trade-off between food and shelter. environmental biology of fishes 77: 87–96. borcherding, j. & magnhagen, c. 2008. food abundance affects both morphology and behaviour of juvenile perch. ecology of freshwater fish 17: 207–218. borcherding, j., hermasch, b. & murawski, p. 2007. field observations and laboratory experiments on growth and lipid content of young-of-the-year perch. ecology of freshwater fish 16: 198–209. christensen, b. & persson, l. 1993. species-speciﬁc antipre- datory behaviours: effects on prey choice in different habitats. behavioral ecology & sociobiology 32: 1–9. hughes, r.n., kaiser, m.j., mackney, p.a. & warburton, k. 1992. optimizing foraging behavior through learning. jour- nal of fish biology 41: 77–91. iwama, g.k. & tautz, a.f. 1981. a simple growth model for salmonids in hatcheries. canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 38: 649–656. kulling, d. & milinski, m. 1992. size-dependent predation risk and partner quality in predator inspection of sticklebacks. animal behaviour 44: 949–955. magnhagen, c. & staffan, f. 2003. social learning in young- of-the-year perch encountering a novel food type. journal of fish biology 63: 824–829. price, t.d., qvarnstrom, a. & irwin, d.e. 2003. the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. proceed- ings of the royal society of london series b-biological sciences 270: 1433–1440. ruzzante, d.e., walde, s.j., cussac, v.e., macchi, p.j., alonso, m.f. & battini, m. 2003. resource polymorphism in a patagonian ﬁsh percichthys trucha (percichthyidae): pheno- typic evidence for interlake pattern variation. biological journal of the linnean society 78: 497–515. skalski, g.t. & gilliam, j.f. 2002. feeding under predation hazard: testing models of adaptive behavior with steam ﬁsh. the american naturalist 160: 158–172. snickars, m., sandstrom, a. & mattila, j. 2004. antipredator behaviour of 0+ year perca ﬂuviatilis: effect of vegetation density and turbidity. journal of fish biology 65: 1604– 1613. 4
