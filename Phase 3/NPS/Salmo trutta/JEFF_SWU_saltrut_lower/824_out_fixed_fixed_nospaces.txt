however, these differences were not reflected in fish diets. prey type and size ingested varied with grayling size and season. small grayling (<15 cm fork length (fl)) consumed mostly aquatic inverte- brates early in the summer, and terrestrial invertebrates later in summer, while larger fish (>15 cm fl) foraged most heavily on ninespine stickleback (pungitius pungitius) throughout the summer, indicating that grayling can be insectivorous and piscivorous, depending on size. these findings underscore the potential importance of small streams in arctic ecosystems as key summer foraging habitats for fish. understanding trophic pathways supporting stream fishes in these systems will help interpret whether and how petroleum development and climate change may affect energy flow and stream productivity, terrestrial–aquatic linkages and fishes in arctic ecosystems. k e y w o r d s arctic grayling, food web, invertebrates, petroleum development, stickleback 1 |  introduction stream salmonids exhibit broad foraging strategies and feed on a wide range of prey types and sizes, influencing energy flow in stream ecosystems (dill, 1983). as with other predators, salmonids often increase fitness by selecting prey that minimise energy expenditure on capturing and handling, while maximising energy intake (charnov, 1976; gill, 2003). salmonids commonly prey upon a wide range of sea- sonally and temporally available food resources derived from multiple sources (wipfli & baxter, 2010). while aquatic and terrestrial inver- tebrates often account for the majority of their food base (stewart, mochnacz, reist, carmichael, & sawatzky, 2007), salmonids will also opportunistically consume larger prey, such as fish (de bruyn & mccart, 1974; jessop, chang- kue, & macdonald, 1993; stewart et al., 2007). however, in many stream systems, especially in the arctic, little is known about prey dynamics within aquatic systems and across the stream–riparian interface. terrestrial invertebrates are typically an important prey subsidy for salmonids in many freshwater ecosystems (eberle & stanford, 2010; kawaguchi & nakano, 2001; wipfli, 1997) and can be their preferred prey (hubert & rhodes, 1989; young, rader, & belish, 1997). with salmonids in both alaska and japan, terrestrial subsidies comprised 184  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:184–197. © 2017 john wiley & sons a/s. published by john wiley & sons ltdup to nearly 90% of energy intake during the summer (allan, wipfli, caouette, prussian, & rodgers, 2003; baxter, fausch, & carl saunders, 2005; wipfli, 1997), and as much as 50% of their annual diet and energy budget (kawaguchi & nakano, 2001; nakano & murakami, 2001). much of the terrestrial invertebrates that fall as prey to stream fishes are found on plants immediately adjacent to the stream and are influenced by plant community composition (edwards & huryn, 1996; wipfli, 1997). for example, studies in southeast alaska and oregon showed more terrestrial invertebrates falling into streams with decid- uous plant species (e.g. alder, alnus spp.) than coniferous species (allan et al., 2003; romero, gresswell, & li, 2005). in japan, kawaguchi and nakano (2001) showed that the biomass of terrestrial invertebrates falling into a forested stream was up to two times greater than a grass- land stream. because riparian plant communities influence terrestrial invertebrate communities, it follows that changes in riparian vegeta- tion will affect food resources for fishes, especially in small streams that are tightly coupled to their riparian habitats (vannote, minshall, cummins, sedell, & cushing, 1980). on the arctic coastal plain (acp), small streams and riparian plant communities are likely very sensitive to resource development (maki, 1992; schindler & smol, 2006). substantial oil and gas exploration has occurred in the 23- million- acre national petroleum reserve- alaska (npr- a) since 2000, with the first development wells and associated infrastructure recently approved for construction (usdoi blm 2015). petroleum development may affect aquatic ecosystems in several ways. infrastructure for petroleum development can interrupt natural hydro- logical processes, changing surface and subsurface flow, which in turn affects lotic and lentic ecosystems by affecting surface water storage and run- off, and associated riparian vegetation communities (walker et al., 1987). further, road crossings over streams can impede fish pas- sage (gibson, haedrich, & wernerheim, 2005), affecting fish abundance and species richness (nislow, hudy, letcher, & smith, 2011). in addition to land use changes, climate change is as pronounced in the arctic as any place on earth (arctic climate impact assessment 2004; nelson, anisimov, & shiklomanov, 2002). while long- term effects are difficult to predict, substantial changes in thermal regimes, precipitation, run- off patterns and permafrost are expected by 2100 (rouse et al., 1997; solomon, 2007; wrona et al., 2006) and are likely to greatly alter aquatic habitats and riparian plant commu- nities. climate change will likely influence stream flow regimes and reduce drainage network (surface water) connectivity (reist et al., 2006; schindler & smol, 2006), which could severely limit fish access to important summer feeding habitats and restrict critical fish migra- tions and dispersal (heim, wipfli, whitman, & seitz, 2014; heim et al., 2015). additionally, documented changes in arctic vegetation, espe- cially widespread increases in shrubs, and greening (chapin, shaver, giblin, nadelhoffer, & laundre, 1995; euskirchen, mcguire, chapin, yi, & thompson, 2009; hinzman et al., 2005; jia, epstein, & walker, 2003; reynolds & tenhunen, 1996; tape, sturm, & racine, 2006) will likely influence terrestrial invertebrate communities and terrestrial prey sub- sidies to stream fishes. if terrestrial prey subsidies are an important component of stream food webs in the arctic, as documented in other places throughout the world (eberle & stanford, 2010; edwards &     |  185 huryn, 1996; kawaguchi & nakano, 2001; wipfli, 1997), trophic path- ways are likely to be affected as a consequence of vegetation cover change (meyer & pulliam, 1992). small, lower order streams are particularly susceptible to distur- bance (carpenter, fisher, grimm, & kitchell, 1992). beaded streams (pools connected by narrow channels that form in ice- wedge net- works) are common across the acp (arp et al., 2012, 2015; oswood, everett, & schell, 1989) and provide important summer foraging hab- itat for several acp fishes (moulton, 1998). these streams may be particularly important foraging areas for arctic grayling (thymallus_arcticus), a common and widespread aquatic predator, and nine- spine stickleback (pungitius pungitius) within the eastern npr- a acp (haynes, rosenberger, lindberg, whitman, & schmutz, 2014; heim et al., 2014, 2015; moulton, 1998, 2007, 2009). despite potential petroleum development and climate shift changes to grayling habitat, no published studies have focused on understanding their ecology and foraging habitats in beaded streams on the acp. the broad goals of this study were to describe prey flow pathways, understand the extent to which terrestrial prey subsidies support gray- ling, assess whether terrestrial vegetation affects terrestrial prey subsi- dies and examine trophic pathways important for supporting grayling in a small stream, crea creek, that has been a focal stream of study for other parallel projects (arp et al., 2015; heim et al., 2014; heim et al., 2015). specific objectives were to (i) quantify terrestrial inver- tebrate infall into crea creek within prevailing terrestrial vegetation types, (ii) identify and quantify prey (invertebrates, fishes) ingested by arctic grayling and ninespine stickleback, (iii) determine whether prey type and size ingested was a function of predator (grayling) size and (iv) determine whether riparian plant species locally affected the quantity of terrestrial invertebrates ingested by grayling. we chose the relatively pristine and roadless crea creek for study because of past and ongoing aquatic studies there, because arctic grayling are common and because this stream is representative of the broader landscape of the acp. this and surrounding watersheds are specifically targeted for petroleum development in the next few years (usdoi blm 2014). findings from this study will shed light on prey flow within aquatic ecosystems in the arctic as changes in land development and climate are quickly occurring. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area this study was conducted in crea creek (70°17 n, 151°20 w), located within the fish creek watershed (within the npr- a portion of the acp) during the summer (june–august) of 2011 and 2012. the con- tinuous permafrost- underlain landscape (jorgenson & brown, 2005; jorgenson et al., 2008; oswood, irons, & milner, 2006) is dominated by polygamised tussock tundra (walker, 2000) and drained thermo- karst lake basins (arp et al., 2012, 2015). crea creek is a first- order beaded stream tributary of the much larger ublutuoch river, with a low- gradient (0.003 m/m) channel composed of numerous pools (i.e. “beads”) connected by narrow runs and lakes along its course (figures 1 and 2). stream discharge peaks in late spring (june), and mcfarland et al. 186  |     stream reach < 2 metres deep (bedfast ice) > 2 metres deep crea creek (weak/seasonal connection) (strong/permanent connection) crea creek (shallow summer foraging habitat) 1 2 4 3 ublutuoch river (deep overwintering habitat) 5 6 7 8 9 10 figure 1 study area in the crea creek drainage in northern alaska (inset) showing the ten stream reaches used to compare fish diets along the stream length, lake depth, channel connectivity and the confluence of the ublutuoch river 0   0.5  1.0 km is lowest prior to freeze- up in early fall (october) (figure 3b and c). in winter, the stream is predominantly frozen, although liquid water usually persists in pools greater than 1.5 m deep (arp et al., 2015). deeper water is generally considered potential overwintering habi- tat for most fishes in the arctic (hobbie, 1984); however, heim et al. (2014) found no evidence of grayling overwintering in crea creek or its lakes. grayling and stickleback are the most common fishes in crea creek, with up to several thousand grayling annually using the stream (j. mcfarland, personal observation, moulton, 2001, 2007). two main vegetation types are patchily distributed throughout crea creek’s riparian habitats: willows (salix spp.; typically <1.0 m in height) and sedges (carex spp. and eriophorum spp.; typically <0.5 m in height). patches of the two vegetation types may be distinct in some areas or occur in mixed stands of varying size. from this point forth, we will refer to these vegetation communities as willow and sedge, which were defined by the dominant taxa of each. were dominated by willow and two by sedge. on the stream surface, we deployed four 0.1- m2 black plastic pan traps (16 total), which were positioned near the centre of each patch, approximately 3–5 m apart and immediately adjacent to or below the vegetation type of interest. traps were set for a 36- to 48- hr period during each of the 3 months sampled. we did not sample the sedge site during june because the vegetation was submerged by unusually high water. to keep inverte- brates from climbing or flying out of the pans, 2–3 drops of unscented dish soap were added to about 3 cm of water in the traps, to break the surface tension (wipfli, 1997). samples were filtered into whirl- pak® bags filled with 70% ethanol in the field and sorted with a dissection microscope in the university of alaska fairbanks (uaf) laboratory. individuals were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level (typically family), measured to the nearest mm and enumerated. aquatic insect adults were not included in the estimate. 2.2 | terrestrial invertebrate inputs 2.3 | prey ingestion by fishes surface- pan traps (eberle & stanford, 2010; wipfli, 1997) were used to measure the quantity and composition of terrestrial invertebrates and aerial forms of aquatic invertebrates falling into crea creek dur- ing june, july and august of 2011. we selected four large (~ 100 m radius) vegetation patches that spanned across both sides of the stream and were representative of the surrounding riparian vegeta- tion community. the patches were located along the length of crea creek, between the headwater lakes and stream mouth. two patches we examined prey composition and mass ingested by grayling in crea creek to address diet components of objectives (ii), (iii) and (iv) by establishing ten study reaches, each approximately 275 m long (excluding lakes), which encompassed the entire length of the stream that is permanently connected during most years (figure 1). we cate- gorised small and large fish based off findings by moulton (2004) from the mainstem (ublutuoch river) that showed two distinct size classes above and below ~15 cm, of roughly equal cohort size (50:50). we mcfarland et al.(a) (b) (c) figure 2 freshwater habitats are abundant and often interconnected across the arctic coastal plain, alaska. arrow points to the crea creek watershed (a), a 400- m section of crea creek shown in box (b) and the same enlarged 400- m stream section showing the characteristic “beaded” pools connected by narrow channels (c) classified large grayling as >15 cm fork length (fl) and small grayling as <15 cm fl, which are hereafter referred to as “large” and “small” grayling unless otherwise specified. we collected up to 10 grayling [five large and five small] per each of the 10 stream reaches, per sam- pling period in june (18 total fish captured), july (132 total fish cap- tured) and august (138 total fish captured) of 2011 and 2012. prior to sampling, block nets with 3.2 mm mesh size were placed in the stream at the beginning and end of each reach, to ensure fish being caught were indicative of the reach sampled. with block nets placed in narrow, shallow runs (typically <1.0 m wide and <0.3 m deep) where base- flow discharge averaged <0.02 m3/s, fish passage was likely pre- vented. fish were collected by backpack electrofishing and dip nets and     |  187 were held alive in buckets alongside the creek. fish were anaesthetised using a clove oil solution (anderson, mckinley, & colavecchia, 1997), weighed (g) and measured for fork length (mm). nonlethal stomach- content samples were collected via gastric lavage (stomach- flushing) with a modified 10.0- ml syringe affixed with a flexible needle that varied in size depending on fish length (culp, boyd, & glozier, 1988; wasowicz & valdez, 1994). all grayling were successfully released after sampling. early in the first year of study, we found that ninespine stickle- back were unusually abundant and were important prey for grayling in crea creek, and therefore, we further examined prey resources supporting stickleback, to help understand the broader food web and prey flow dynamics. to examine prey ingested by stickleback, we used a backpack electrofisher and hand- held dip nets to collect up to 10 stickleback, in each of the 10 stream reaches, in july (60 total fish) and august (50 total fish) of 2012. stickleback were determined to be too small to effectively lavage; therefore, lethal stomach- content sam- ples were collected by dispatching fish by means of decapitation and removing and inspecting stomachs. to develop a length–mass regres- sion for stickleback, we additionally collected up to 15 stickleback per each of the 10 stream reaches in july (150 stickleback) and august (149 stickleback) of 2012 (figure 4a). no stickleback samples were taken in june, due to high water. stomach contents from grayling and whole stomachs from stickle- back were preserved in whirl- pak® bags filled with 70% ethanol and later transported to a uaf laboratory, sorted with a dissection micro- scope, measured to the nearest mm and enumerated. prey items were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level possible, and inver- tebrates were categorised as either terrestrial or aquatic. 2.4 | influence of riparian vegetation on terrestrial invertebrate ingestion to examine the influence of riparian vegetation on terrestrial inverte- brate ingestion by grayling, we first measured the vegetation composi- tion along the length of crea creek by estimating the relative cover of the two riparian plants (willow:sedge) through aerial photography. low- elevation aerial photographs were taken during mid- august when willow leaves were turning yellow and easily distinguished from green sedges. adobe® photoshop™ was then used to place equal- sized grid cells over the photographs to visually estimate per cent cover for each grid. vegetation estimates were totalled and averaged per each of the 10 stream reaches and presented as relative proportion (willow:sedge) of cover. we used linear regression to examine the relationship between willow:sedge and the mass of terrestrial invertebrates ingested by fish. for our regressions, we used the willow:sedge pro- portion from each stream reach as the predictor variable of terrestrial invertebrate mass ingested by grayling within the corresponding reach. 2.5 | sample processing and data analysis taxa in fish diet samples were classified as terrestrial or aquatic according to mccafferty (1983), triplehorn and johnson (2005), merritt, cummins, and berg (2008) and thorp and covich (2009). mcfarland et al. spring (late may – june) summer (july – early aug.) fall (aug – sep.) winter (oct. – may) frozen bedfast 188  |     (a) (b) ) c ( . p m e t m a e r t s (c) 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 key = arctic grayling = ninespine stickleback lake and river depth = deep lake (> 2 m) = shallow lake (< 2 m) = deep river (> 2 m) temperature discharge 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 e g r a h c s d m a e r t i s ) s / 3 m ( figure 3 depiction of arctic grayling and ninespine stickleback seasonal movement and abundance in a representative beaded stream system consisting of lakes draining into and along the stream on the arctic coastal plain. streams often feed larger rivers that do not freeze to the bottom and are overwintering habitat for many fish species. arrows indicate the direction of fish movement and fish icons represent the general abundance and location of fish (a), the broken and solid lines represent stream temperature and discharge (b) and time- lapse photographs show seasonal changes of a section of crea creek (c). discharge and temperature data taken from whitman et al. (2011) terrestrial stages (adults) of aquatic insects were classified as aquatic prey. dry mass estimates were used in the terrestrial input and diet components of this study. family groupings were used in our analy- sis, and invertebrate biomass for each taxon was determined through published length–mass regressions (benke, huryn, smock, & wallace, 1999; hodar, 1996; meyer, 1989; rogers, buschbom, & watson, 1977; sabo, bastow, & power, 2002; sample, cooper, greer, & whitmore, 1993). stickleback dry mass was determined by generating a length–mass regression using the allometric formula: w = alb where w is the total dry body weight (g), l is the total length (cm) and a and b are the coefficients of the functional regression between w and l (ricker, 1973). we dried stickleback at 60°c until dry (72 hr), then measured mass to the nearest mg and length to the nearest mm, and calculated a = 0.00168 and b = 3.07463, r2 = .95, p = <.01, n = 299. data analyses were conducted using r.3.1.1 (r development core team, 2014) and analysed with a one- way anova for comparisons between sampling periods and years of prey ingested by different- sized grayling and stickleback. t-tests provided comparisons over sampling periods and years of terrestrial invertebrate inputs, quanti- ties of terrestrial invertebrates ingested per stream reach, and prey ingested by different- sized grayling and stickleback. all statistical tests were two- tailed. log10 (x + 1) transformations for exact values were performed, if necessary, to standardise variances and improve normal- ity. nontransformed data are presented unless otherwise stated. for all tests, alpha was set at 0.05. 3 |  results 3.1 | terrestrial invertebrate inputs of the 49 invertebrate taxa collected in surface traps, terrestrial taxa and adult forms of aquatic taxa comprised 52% and 42% respectively. the remaining 6% taxa could not be reliably attributed to aquatic or terrestrial origin. invertebrate inputs averaged 21.7 ± 3.8 mg·m−2·day−1 across sites and sampling periods, with maximum inputs in july (table 1). invertebrate inputs from willows were greater than those from sedge when averaged across july and august sampling periods (willow = 24.9 ± 3.6 mg·m−2·day−1, sedge = 8.2 ± 2.5, p = .02) (table 1). the pro- portion of terrestrial invertebrate mass compared to total invertebrate mass (terrestrial and aquatic) falling into the stream increased over the summer (june = 27.8 ± 1.6, july = 38.2 ± 1.1, august = 41.1 ± 1.4%). further, we found that terrestrial invertebrate individual mean size mcfarland et al.(a) ninespine stickleback     |  189 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 (b) arctic grayling 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 fork length (mm) y c n e u q e r f 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 figure 4 length frequency of ninespine stickleback (n = 299) (a) and arctic grayling (n = 288) (b) captured in crea creek during the summers of 2011 and 2012. note different x- axes table 1 mean mass (mg·m −2·day−1) ± se of invertebrates (terrestrial and aquatic) captured in floating pan traps placed on the stream surface and surrounded by large willow- and sedge- dominated patches during the summer of 2011 (n = 2 per vegetation type and date). nd = no data, because sedge sites were submerged by high water in june season june july august invertebrate infall willow 22.0 ± 2.6 36.2 ± 2.6 17.9 ± 4.5 sedge nd 18.5 ± 2.3 13.9 ± 2.6 was greater than that of aquatic invertebrates when averaged across sites and sampling periods (terrestrial = 1.1 ± 0.2 mg, aquatic = 0.7 ± 0.2 mg). 3.2 | prey ingestion by fishes we analysed stomach contents from 288 grayling in crea creek during the summers of 2011 (n = 146) and 2012 (n = 142). fish lengths were bimodally distributed and ranged from 5.3 to 43.3 cm in fork length, with a mean ± se of 18.4 ± 7.8 cm (figure 4b). prey proportions did not differ between years. grayling consumed prey from 18 orders and 63 families of invertebrates (28 terrestrial, 30 aquatic and five unknown families) and two fish species (appendix a). 99.8% of all terrestrial taxa found in grayling stomachs were also collected in pan traps. stickleback contributed the most mass to grayling diet and accounted for 88% of the total prey biomass, averaged across all fish size classes. five fish and invertebrate taxa accounted for 99% of the biomass in grayling diets (stickleback, 88%;

lindström, 2010; miller, 1946) and prey upon stickleback (de bruyn & mccart, 1974); however, these observations are generally considered to be isolated and opportunistic events (de bruyn & mccart, 1974; olson, 2014). we found stickleback were heavily predated all months and summers sampled, particularly by larger sized grayling. these results indicated a size threshold for piscivory, where gape- limited (fish generally <15 cm fl) or less domi- nant individuals were generally unable to exploit the resource (abbott, dunbrack, & orr, 1985; mittelbach, 1981; o’brien, 1979). given that prey abundance and quality can be indicative of gray- ling forage patterns (lisi, bentley, armstrong, & schindler, 2014), and through field observations (j. mcfarland, personal observa- tion), we believe that the high degree of piscivory in crea creek is a function of stickleback abundance. haynes et al. (2014) found that stickleback were the most widespread and ubiquitous fish species in lakes on the acp. likewise, in the lakes of crea creek and sur- rounding watersheds during parallel studies, we regularly caught substantial amounts (1000s in a single overnight fyke net set) of stickleback nearly all summer. stickleback apparently overwinter in the deep lakes within the crea creek system (figures 1 and 3) and may spawn multiple times early in the summer (cameron, kostoris, & penhale, 1973; heins, johnson, & baker, 2003). based on personal observation, we believe that as stickleback abundance increases in lakes over the summer, so does the number of stickleback moving downstream (figure 3). consistent with this, via underwater videog- raphy and visual confirmation, we observed stickleback in crea creek mcfarland et al. 192  |     table 3 relative per cent vegetation cover and mean mass ± se of terrestrial invertebrates consumed by fish during the summers of 2011 and 2012, per stream reach in crea creek. ti = terrestrial invertebrate; nd = no data % vegetation cover mean ti consumption (mg)/fish willow sedge june july august stream reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 25% 75% 1.7 ± 0.5 n = 11 37% 63% nd 34% 66% nd 39% 61% nd 7% 93% nd 19% 81% 0.2 ± 0.1 n = 2 73% 27% 1.6 ± 1.4 n = 4 75% 25% nd 51% 49% nd 2.6 ± 1.1 n = 17 3.6 ± 0.9 n = 13 6.7 ± 2.5 n = 9 8.8 ± 3.3 n = 19 4.2 ± 1.5 n = 22 6.1 ± 2.2 n = 17 2.2 ± 1.2 n = 12 5.6 ± 2.0 n = 14 1.5 ± 0.9 n = 6 4.1 ± 1.8 n = 14 3.1 ± 0.8 n = 16 6.2 ± 1.6 n = 16 4.0 ± 1.2 n = 21 3.2 ± 0.7 n = 18 7.3 ± 2.3 n = 20 1.4 ± 0.6 n = 9 7.9 ± 2.9 n = 19 9.7 ± 6.3 n = 3 10 58% 67% nd 0.8 ± 0.6 10.4 ± 9.2 n = 3 n = 2 seasonally increased in abundance and moved downstream in groups (up to ~50). likewise, we observed the piscivorous feeding behaviour of grayling to also increase over the season. these predator and prey relationships illustrate the ecological importance of habitat connec- tivity among lakes and streams on the acp, for allowing dispersal, colonisation and feeding. piscivorous grayling experience larger energetic gains than insec- tivorous grayling. not only did piscivorous fish ingest significantly greater mass and fewer prey numbers than nonpiscivorous fish, stick- leback have higher energy densities than invertebrates (brey, rumohr, & ankar, 1988; hanson, cummins, cargill, & lowry, 1985; kidd et al., 1998; sato et al., 2011). substantial energetic gains from piscivory may explain why heim et al. (2014, 2015) found grayling in crea creek to experience rapid growth and mass accumulation over the short sum- mer. they also found that large fish migrated out of the stream earlier in the summer than small fish. we suggest that while large piscivorous fish are able to sequester sufficient energy early in the season, small fish remain in the stream longer to obtain adequate energy reserves prior to overwintering. given that piscivorous fish consumed higher quality prey than insectivorous fish, while at the same time potentially expending less energy to capture fewer prey, stickleback may be a critical prey resource contributing to the annual energy budget—and ultimately grayling abundance and productivity. grayling in crea creek consumed terrestrial and aquatic- sourced prey throughout the summer, with proportions of each inversely changing as the season progressed. given terrestrial invertebrates were larger in size than aquatic invertebrates, dependence on terres- trial sourced prey later in the season may be attributed to selective foraging and seasonally changing prey abundance and availability. salmonids often preferentially select large prey (edwards & huryn, 1996). for example, nakano et al. (1999) concluded that differences in prey size among prey categories was the primary factor influenc- ing selective foraging by rainbow trout on terrestrial invertebrates. in addition to prey size selection, aquatic insect phenology (adult emer- gence over the summer) will temporarily reduce abundance and avail- ability of many aquatic insects, while terrestrial invertebrate phenol- ogy will generally increase the abundance and availability over summer figure 7 seasonal prey flow among common prey categories in crea creek, representative of the broader landscape. arrow width depicts the amount of biomass flowing among trophic categories mcfarland et al.(mccafferty, 1983; merritt et al., 2008; thorp & covich, 2009). our data were consistent with these findings, as the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate prey in the diets of small grayling showed a clear, inverse relationship over the summer. terrestrial invertebrate prey ingested by grayling were nearly identi- cal to the terrestrial invertebrate fauna captured in pan traps associated with riparian plants along crea creek, illustrating a linkage between prey ingestion and prey subsidised by riparian plants. the quantity of terrestrial invertebrate prey falling into stream reaches was greater at willow sites than sedge sites, possibly because willows grew denser and taller and overhung the stream more, or they simply support higher invertebrate densities. however, the mass of terrestrial invertebrates ingested by fish was not reflected in these differences, perhaps due to fish moving between reaches prior to sampling. constrained and diffi- cult logistics associated with aviation limitations and severe weather at this remote site prevented larger sample sizes. other studies have shown that streamside vegetation can influence terrestrial prey subsi- dies entering streams and ingested by fish (kawaguchi & nakano, 2001; nakano & murakami, 2001; wipfli, 1997). studies in both new zealand and japan concluded that vegetation composition and the amount of vegetation overhanging the stream explained both greater terrestrial invertebrate inputs in streams and ingested by fish between forested versus grassland stream reaches (edwards & huryn, 1996; kawaguchi & nakano, 2001). evidence from these studies and ours supports the hypothesis that riparian vegetation type influences the amount of ter- restrial prey entering the stream, and may likely be a factor driving ter- restrial prey subsidies for fishes in small streams on the acp. our findings highlight the key prey resources and trophic path- ways supporting grayling in a representative stream on the acp, illustrating that aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates can be import- ant for small grayling and that large prey, primarily stickleback, can be a key food base for large grayling. given the high density of small streams and watersheds similar to crea creek on the acp (arp et al., 2015) (figure 2) and the expansion of petroleum development there, it appears imperative to maintain terrestrial–aquatic linkages and sur- face water connectivity among lentic and lotic habitats during devel- opment to maintain free movement in drainage networks by aquatic predators and their prey. cross- drainage roads must not inhibit nor- mal overland flow patterns and stream crossings must minimise dis- turbance to surrounding riparian vegetation communities to allow for adequate summer- long fish passage into these important foraging habitats. maintaining terrestrial–aquatic linkages and overall surface water connectivity is critical for sustaining food resources supporting stream fishes and their productivity and should be a priority for fresh- water ecosystem and fish conservation. acknowledgements we thank kurt heim, katie hayden and leah vanden busch for field and laboratory assistance, helicopter pilot keelan mcnulty for getting us to and from field sites safely, chris arp for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript, the department of biology and wildlife at the university of alaska fairbanks for student funding and lastly     |  193 heather mcfarland for moral support. this work was funded by the bureau of land management, performed under uaf iacuc protocol #177783- 7, and state of alaska department of fish and game per- mits #sf2011- 179 and sf2012- 065. any use of trade, firm or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorse- ment by the u.s. government. references abbott, j. c., dunbrack, r. l., & orr, c. d.
