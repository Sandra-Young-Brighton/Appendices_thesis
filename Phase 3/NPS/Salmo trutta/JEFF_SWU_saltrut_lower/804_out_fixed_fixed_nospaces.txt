whereas stream-species richness was negatively correlated with landscape alterations (kansas river basin) or landscape alterations and watershed impoundments (arkansas river basin). these findings suggest that convergences in the relative proportions of impoundment and stream species (i.e., community structure) in the eastern extent of both basins are related to positive effects of increased habitat opportunities for impoundment species and negative effects caused by landscape alterations (kansas river basin) or landscape alterations plus watershed impoundments (arkansas river basin) for stream species. key words: watershed; impoundments; fish community; great plains; streams introduction lotic freshwater ecosystems are strongly influenced by terrestrial land use alterations involving human extraction and exploitation of ecosystem goods and services (likens et al. 1978; richards et al. 1996). agricultural land cover in particular contributes to reduced habitat suitability and degraded integrity of fish communities in surrounding streams (wang et al. 1997). such strong linkages between terrestrial land- scape alterations and stream biota are mediated by cascading hydrologic mechanisms involving connectivity, or the movement of matter, energy and organisms through stream corridors (pringle 2001). the mechanisms that maintain hydrologic connectiv- ity include hydrology, geomorphology, erosion and deposition, such as run-off, channel shape, sediment movement and substrate composition respectively. these elements collectivity represents the land cover cascade (lcc), a framework used to quantify the transfer of land-cover-disturbance effects to stream biota such as fishes or aquatic invertebrates (burcher et al. 2007). these landscape alterations have been implicated in the altered distributions of aquatic biota correspondence: joshuah s. perkin, department of biology, tennessee technological university, 1100 n. dixie avenue, cookeville, tn 38505, usa. e-mail: jperkin@tntech.edu † present address: environmental sciences division, oak ridge national laboratory, oak ridge, tn 37831, usa doi: 10.1111/eff.12198 141 perkin et al. a of for number reasons, across a range of spatiotemporal scales (cooper et al. 2013; bouska & whitledge 2014). however, assign- ing cause to individual landscape alterations is chal- lenging including covariation among natural and anthropogenic gradi- ents, multiple mechanisms of change operating simultaneously and in nonlinear fashions, and uncer- tainty in separating historical and contemporary influences (allan 2004). new statistical frameworks such as structural equation modelling (sem) directly address these limitations and are increasingly applied to assess relationships between multiple forms of landscape change and stream ecosystem health (maloney & weller 2011; bizzi et al. 2013). impoundment construction is a unique form of landscape change that has drastically altered ecosys- tems throughout the world, with over 16.7 million occurring globally (lehner et al. 2011). large impoundments (>200 ha) inundate vast extents of lotic habitat and transform terrestrial habitat into len- tic aquatic habitat. these transformations affect fishes through a variety of pathways, including altering hab- itat mosaics within a reservoir, manipulating down- stream flow regimes and serving as sources of invasion into adjacent aquatic habitats (havel et al. 2005; falke & gido 2006; johnson et al. 2008). small impoundments (<200 ha) are more numerous, and similar transformations occur on differing scales. at local scales, small impoundments inundate small areas of the landscape; however, summing transfor- mations by these impoundments within a stream catchment (watershed hereafter) might have detect- able effects at spatial scales comparable to large res- ervoirs, especially in the context of hydrologic connectivity (pringle 2001). for example, watershed impoundments retain run-off and dampen small flow pulses (earl & wood 2002), which consequently change downstream flow regimes and channel mor- phologies (decoursey 1975; schoof et al. 1987; friedman et al. 1998). these processes represent the critical components of the lcc as described by bur- cher et al. that here the context involves transformation of terrestrial-to-aquatic habi- tat within a watershed rather than conversion of one terrestrial land cover to another. although available aquatic habitat within a watershed is positively asso- ciated with integrity of warm water fish communities (wang et al. 1997), effects of watershed impound- ments on obligate stream fishes are generally consid- ered negative (schrank et al. 2001; mammoliti 2002). separating natural aquatic habitats such as streams from anthropogenic watershed impoundments might aid in identifying the mechanisms that control total species richness (wang et al. 1997) versus fishes uniquely adapted to streams (i.e., stream versus impoundment (2007), except richness of natural lakes or 142 species diversity; mammoliti 2002). given that land cover transitions from native cover to urban and agri- culture occur simultaneously with construction of impoundments, additional research is necessary to determine the relative effects of these alterations as well as how these alterations influence fishes with contrasting habitat associations. great plains prairie streams represent ecosystems afflicted by substantial watershed alteration. contem- porary great plains watersheds are dominated by row-crop agriculture, urbanisation or cattle-grazing practices (dodds et al. 2004), and in many regions of the great plains, >90% of native land cover has been transformed for human use (gido et al. 2010). these transformations influence water quality, invertebrate community composition and distribution of stream fishes (whiles et al. 2000; gido et al. 2006; dodds & oakes 2008). watershed impoundments are also implicated in the decline of some native species (sch- rank et al. 2001; gerken & paukert 2013) and concur- rent with the expansion of others (gido et al. 2010). whereas changes in lotic fish community structure in larger rivers are related to the combined effects of hab- itat fragmentation and stream dewatering (perkin et al. 2014), species distributions in smaller streams are more intimately related to landscape alterations in the watersheds (troia & gido 2013). in these smaller streams, fish species richness is related to stream size, land cover variables and geological characteristics (gido et al. 2006), but the effects of habitat alteration and fish invasions caused by watershed impound- ments are largely unaddressed despite recognition of the potential for degradation (dodds et al. 2004). the extent to which widespread construction of watershed impoundments in the great plains has contributed to altered fish diversity remains unclear. furthermore, the relative impacts of watershed impoundments com- pared to other forms of terrestrial land cover change (e.g., conversion of prairie to row-crop agriculture) on stream fish communities have been difficult to evalu- ate given the simultaneous construction of impound- ments and conversion of native land covers to human land uses (sensu allan 2004). the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of multiple watershed landscape alterations on fish community structure in great plains prairie streams of kansas, usa. specific objectives included: (i) documenting the number, spatial distribution and size distribution of watershed impoundments in kansas, (ii) testing the effects of watershed landscape altera- tions on stream- and impoundment-associated fishes while controlling for the effects of zoogeography and local habitat availability, and (iii) integrating findings fish community structure into spatial patterns of across kansas. we hypothesised that increased watershed impoundments would positively correlate watershed alterations influence fish community structure with richness of impoundment-associated fishes because of either habitat changes that benefit these fishes or because impoundments themselves serve as source populations (havel et al. 2005; johnson et al. 2008). we that watershed impoundments would negatively correlate with rich- ness of stream-associated fishes because of the docu- mented negative effects of impoundments on native stream fishes in the great plains (mammoliti 2002; gerken & paukert 2013). hypothesised also study area the state of kansas is characterised by longitudinal (west to east) gradients in rainfall, elevation and topography. in general, precipitation increases, eleva- tion decreases and topographic complexity increases in an easterly direction. from north to south, the state is bisected by two major river basins, the kansas river basin to the north and the arkansas river basin to the south (fig. 1). collectively, these gradients in abiotic conditions and biogeographic (drainage basin) boundaries contribute to at least four major fish eco- regions in the state: nw (kansas river basin, west of the flint hills), sw (arkansas river basin west of the flint hills), ne (eastern kansas river basin) and se (eastern arkansas river basin; hawkes et al. 1986). overlaid across the longitudinal gradients described above is a west-to-east gradient of increas- ing numbers of watershed impoundments. intensive terrestrial landscape changes include conversion of native land cover to row-crop agriculture and urban and suburban land use throughout much of the state (gido et al. 2010). in other regions, less intensive ter- restrial landscape changes include the modification of large herbivore grazing and fire regimes as a conse- quence of cattle grazing (larson et al. 2013). these regions include the flint hills ecoregion that runs north–south across the state between the  96th and  97th meridians and the red hills ecoregion in the south central portion of the state. materials and methods field methods fish community data collected by the kansas depart- ment of wildlife, parks and tourism (kdwpt) were used in this study. collections were conducted during may through august 1995–2008 as a part of the kdwpt state-wide stream assessment and monitor- ing program. the kdwpt fish community sampling protocol followed that of lazorchak et al. (1998), with sampling lengths of 40-times the mean wetted fig. 1. locations of stream fish sampling points (open circles) in the kansas and arkansas basins of kansas, usa. black-filled polygons illustrate impoundments, heavy open polygon is the flint hills ecoregion (see text), and open polygons associated with each fish sampling location illustrate watersheds. 143 perkin et al. width and bounded by lower and upper limits of 150 and 300 m respectively, to ensure representative sam- ples of the community for each site and date. collec- tions were made using a combination of straight and bag seines (4.7 mm mesh) and dc-pulsed backpack or tote-barge electrofishing. equal effort among gear types was used for all sites and dates to facilitate comparisons of community structure. although the kdwpt sampled a variety of wadeable streams, col- lections used in this study were filtered by stream network position (i.e., strahler 1957; order = 3rd) because of the strong influence positioning has on fish community structure and species distributions (thornbrugh & gido 2010; troia & gido 2013). all fishes collected during kdwpt surveying of third- order streams were classified into habitat guilds involving either impoundment or stream habitat asso- ciations based on previous indicator species analysis that compared abundance of the different species from standardised sampling of impoundments and streams (gido et al. 2009). thus, fishes that were more abundant in impoundment samples were classi- fied as impoundment associates and those more abun- dant in streams as stream associates. three environmental variables representing useful predictors of species richness at a site (local habitat hereafter) were collected by the kdwpt at the time of fish sampling. survey area was calculated as the total length of stream sampled multiplied by the average stream width measured at 10 evenly spaced transects along the sampling reach. this metric has been used to predict fish species richness at stream sampling sites in and outside of the great plains (fischer & paukert 2009). channel width and depth averaged across the same longitudinal transects were also used because of the utility of these metric for predicting fish species richness (angermeier & sch- losser 1989; perkin & gido 2012). these habitat metrics reflect the size of stream habitats available to fishes and are more temporarily stable than related measures such as discharge or velocity and are more useful richness regardless of year or season (gido et al. 2006; troia & gido 2013). for predicting species landscape alterations the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of landscape alterations in the watersheds upstream of fish sampling sites. watershed delinea- tion for each sampling site was generated from a dig- ital elevation model (dem, gesch et al. 2002) through a multistep process using arcgis 10 hydrol- ogy toolbox (esri 2012). once watersheds were delineated, the number of watershed impoundments within each watershed was calculated based on the 144 impoundments shapefile derived from the national hydrography dataset plus (mckay et al. 2012). the total number of impoundments was divided by the area of each watershed polygon to estimate the den- sity of watershed impoundments (# impoundments  2) upstream of sampling sites. transformation to km intensive terrestrial land use was estimated by calcu- lating the per cent of area in each watershed polygon constituted by agricultural (i.e., row-crop) or urban- ised land cover using data from the national land cover database (fry et al. 2011). this approach gen- erally produces greater predictability than using only buffer zones along the stream corridor (wang et al. 1997). although native prairie in several ecoregions (i.e., flint hills, red hills) is used for cattle grazing, this low intensity land use exerts a lesser impact on in-stream characteristics relative to urban and row- crop land uses and therefore was not included as a terrestrial landscape alteration (larson et al. 2013). other forms of landscape alteration exist for great plains prairie streams (e.g., woody encroachment, riparian buffer destruction), but these alterations are related to loss of native grassland, which has been subsequently replaced by the major forms of change involving agricultural development, urbanisation and impoundment construction (dodds et al. 2004; fi- scher et al. 2010; gido et al. 2010). (landscape the first objective of this study was to enumerate watershed impoundments in the state of kansas to compare with other traditionally quantified forms of landscape change (agriculture, urbanisation). the nhd impoundment layer was used to extract impoundment surface area sizes (km2) as well as the total number of impoundments within the state. these data were used to construct a histogram of impound- ment sizes as well as display the geographic locations of all impoundments. longitudinal (west to east) pat- terns in impoundment density and terrestrial land- scape alterations involving both urbanisation and agriculture alteration hereafter) were tested. given the potential for spatial autocorrelation in landscape features (i.e., sites closer in space might be more similar), relationships were analysed using generalised additive models (gams), which account for serial autocorrelation (wood 2006). initially, all samples among basins were combined, and basin was treated as a categorical covariate to test for differ- ences in longitudinal patterns in landscape features among the kansas and arkansas river basins. when a significant interaction term for basin occurred, sepa- rate gams were used to describe spatial variation in landscape features for each basin. relationships between longitude and impoundment density and lon- gitude and terrestrial landscape alterations were anal- ysed and plotted separately. for all gams, the mgcv package in program r was used (wood 2006) and watershed alterations influence fish community structure the central tendency and 95% confidence envelopes displayed. structural equation modelling the second objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of watershed alterations on fish commu- nity structure while accounting for the simultaneous effects of zoogeography and the capacity of local habitats to support fishes. given the complexity of these interactions, a statistical framework capable of incorporating multiple, simultaneous stressors and having the ability to explicitly link ecological pro- cesses and spatial patterns was necessary (bizzi et al. 2013). structural equation models (sems) incorpo- rate direct and indirect effects of stimuli on responses by identifying multiple pathways through which gov- erning mechanisms operate (burcher et al. 2007). consequently, an sem framework was used to develop an a priori model useful for describing the potential, interacting effects of geographic location (location hereafter), watershed impoundments, land- scape alterations, local habitat and fish community structure (fig. 2). this figure represents a hypothesis by which fish community structure is directly con- trolled by location (maloney & weller 2011), watershed impoundments (mammoliti 2002), land- scape alterations (gerken & paukert 2013) and local habitat (gido et al. 2006). indirect paths controlling fish communities involve the cascading effects of location on watershed impoundments, location on landscape alterations and location on local habitat because of the longitudinal gradients that exist across the state of kansas (as described above). similarly, watershed impoundments and landscape alterations were habitat hypothesised control to local by longitude), watershed (decoursey 1975; schoof et al. 1987; earl & wood 2002) and indirectly fish community structure. these latent variables were approximated using measured variables described above, including location (mea- sured impoundments (impoundment density), landscape alterations (per cent urban and agricultural land in watershed), local habitat (survey area, channel width and mean depth) and two measures of fish community response (impoundment-associated and stream-associated spe- cies richness). the a priori hypothesised model shown in fig. 2 was developed into an sem through model specifica- tion (grace et al. 2010). an initial power analysis was conducted to ensure acceptable sample sizes could be obtained assuming an intermediate (as opposed to weak or strong) effect of landscape altera- tions on the richness of fishes in surrounding streams (westland 2010). the assumed intermediate effect size was conservative with respect to the magnitude of effects reported in other studies using sem frame- works (burcher et al. 2007; maloney & weller 2011). a partial least squares (pls) sem approach was utilised because of the relaxed assumptions regarding distributions of the predictor and response variables accommodated by pls regression. the inner model (containing the latent variables) was parameterised according to the hypothesised govern- ing mechanisms illustrated in fig. 2. next, the outer model (containing the measured variables) was parameterised such that longitude was deterministic towards location; impoundment density was determin- istic towards watershed impoundments; per cent urban and agricultural land uses were deterministic towards landscape alterations; survey area, channel width and mean depth were reflective of local habitat;

as determined using bootstrap- ping) were illustrated with arrow sizes proportional to the path coefficient, correlation coefficients between latent variables were listed along paths and per cent of variation explained by the model at each latent variable shown. the mean and 95% confidence inter- vals for total effects (direct and indirect) were also shown using bar charts arranged next to path dia- grams. fish community structure across kansas the final objective of this study involved integrating model results into spatial patterns in fish community structure. this objective was achieved by first illus- trating the relationship between location (longitude) and fish species richness because the direct effect of location on community composition was significant in all models (results section). the central tendencies of these relationships were illustrated for impound- ment-associated and stream-associated fish species in the kansas and arkansas river basins, separately. given the potential for spatial autocorrelation among sampling sites, gams were used to describe spatial variation in species richness for guilds in each basin. a similar gam approach was used to illustrate the longitudinal convergence of the relative proportion of impoundment-associated and stream-associated fish species (i.e., community structure) across the state of kansas. this approach allowed for illustrat- ing the spatial context of the sem outputs to enhance interpretation. finally, we combined these spatial patterns, the sem output and known zooge- ography of fishes in kansas to test for the direct interactions between landscape alterations and fish species richness in eastern (i.e., east of the  96.5 meridian) portions of the kansas (ne fish ecoregion) and arkansas (se fish ecoregion) basins. these interactions were tested using generalised linear regression with landscape alteration or watershed impoundment density as the predictor variable and 146 fish species richness for each guild as the response variable to test for significant slopes after a bonfer- roni correction to alpha (a = 0.05/8 = 0.006) associ- ated with eight tests (two predictors 9 two basins 9 two habitat guilds). results forty-two-third-order streams were sampled in the kansas river basin and 62 streams sampled in the arkansas river basin. these collections spanned a longitudinal gradient across the state from the  100th meridian to approximately the  95th merid- ian. a total of 67 fish species was reported, including 47 from the kansas river basin and 64 from the arkansas river basin. among the reported fishes, 28 (42%) were classified as impoundment-associated and 39 (58%) were classified as stream-associated (table 1). in longitudinal distribution the impoundment densities and landscape alterations varied from west to east and between basins. a total of 182,470 impoundments occurred in kansas, divi- ded among size classes of surface area ranging from 0.001 to 0.0049 km2 (n = 98,191), 0.005–0.009 km2 (63,970), 0.01–0.049 km2 (11,297), 0.05–0.09 km2 (7,805) and 0.1 to >10 km2 (1,207). there was no difference of impoundment densities between the kansas and arkansas river basins (t = 0.218, p = 0.83), so a single gam was fitted (f2.8,3.4 = 75.6, r2 = 0.72, adj p < 0.01). in both basins, watershed impoundment densities averaged <1.0 per km2 west of the  97th meridian, but increased to over three per km2 in the eastern portion of the state (fig. 3a). longitudi- nal gradients in terrestrial landscape alterations dif- fered (t = 3.526, p < 0.01) between the kansas = 0.39, p < 0.01) and arkansas (f5.8,6.7 = 4.2, r2 adj (f8.2,8.8 = 16.2, r2 in adj general, ~50% of landscapes were altered in both basins west of the  97th meridian;

(fig. 6a) basin richness discussion environmental drivers of richness richness of stream-associated and impoundment- associated species was influenced by multiple inde- pendent and interactive environmental factors. loca- tion was directly associated with richness of impoundment and stream species and was consistent across basins. this is likely related to historical and contemporary fish distributions in kansas (hawkes et al. 1986) and could result from two possible mech- anisms. first, neutral metacommunity models predict higher species richness with increasing mean annual run-off apparent in eastern kansas relative to western kansas (muneepeerakul et al. 2008). although our analysis did not directly measure run-off, inclusion of location in our models indirectly captured this pattern 149 perkin et al.

perkin et al. 2014). similarly, falke & gido (2006) observed that impoundment-associated species were most abundant in larger pools of a fourth-order stream flowing directly into a large kansas river basin reservoir, consistent with greater impoundment species richness in habitats with greater capacity to support these fishes. our study provides more refined information on impoundment-associated species by documenting watershed alterations influence fish community structure (a) (b) fig. 6. relationship between (a) per cent altered landscape and stream fish species richness in the kansas river basin and (b) impoundment density and stream fish species richness in the arkansas river basin of kansas, usa. the prevalence of the relationship between impound- ment fishes and suitable habitats across most streams in the kansas and arkansas river basins. further- more, our findings suggest this pattern is not limited to the larger streams studied by falke & gido (2006) and that it is also prevalent in headwater streams that are not necessarily in close proximity to large reser- voirs. that typically occupy large pools local habitat capacity was not related to richn- ess of stream-associated fishes. this lack of gover- nance could be a direct consequence of isolation or disturbance history, or indirectly as a consequence of predation by the numerous impoundment-associated piscivores in headwater streams (schlosser 1987; creed 2006). in terms of disturbance history, failure of sems to detect an interaction between stream-associated rich- ness and local and landscape features might be related to past declines and extirpations of many stream fishes in the state (mammoliti 2002; haslouer et al. 2005; gido et al. 2010). by this account, our analysis of spatial patterns in contemporary (i.e., post 1994) fish distributions was biased towards species that have largely resisted landscape alterations that now affect a large extent of the great plains (hoag- strom et al. 2011). these findings highlight the importance of synthesising studies that document long-term temporal community change with studies of contemporary spatial variation in community com- position. in terms of indirect predation effects, the abundance and occurrence of piscivorous impound- ment-associated fishes have increased over the past half century (gido et al. 2010). increases among these fishes are implicated in the ongoing decline of stream fishes (schrank et al. 2001; gerken & paukert 2013) and cannot be ruled out as contributing to the observed patterns in this study. although urban and agricultural land use corre- lated with location, these terrestrial landscape altera- tions did not affect impoundment-associated species richness. indeed, even in the eastern portion of the land alterat- kansas river basin where terrestrial ion is widespread, impoundment-associated species were still prevalent. by contrast, terrestrial landscape modifications negatively affected the richness of stream-associated species, although the causal paths differed between the kansas and arkansas river basins. because terrestrial landscape alterations are most abundant in the eastern kansas river basin, the negative impact of these terrestrial landscape altera- tions was most prevalent in the eastern portion of that basin as might be expected given established linkages between landscapes and stream communities (likens et al. 1978; maloney & weller 2011). this was apparent in the sem output, in which location indi- rectly affected stream-associated species richness via an intermediate path with terrestrial landscape alter- ation. in the arkansas river basin, terrestrial land- scape alterations were not strongly correlated with geographic location (although the total effect was negative), which is consistent with reduced terrestrial landscape alterations in the eastern extent of the arkansas river basin. although terrestrial landscape alterations were less intense in the eastern arkansas river basin, a negative effect on stream-associated fishes was apparent as expected under the lcc framework interestingly, watershed impoundments had a stronger negative effect on stream-species in the eastern arkansas river basin (relative to terrestrial altera- tions) as predicted based on previous work at finer spatial extents (schrank et al. 2001; mammoliti 2002; gerken & paukert 2013). this pattern suggests watershed impoundments represent a threat to stream fish diversity in relatively pristine watersheds that are not heavily afflicted by more traditionally recognised forms of landscape alteration (e.g., forest removal or agricultural development, richards et al. 1996; wang et al. 1997). this finding extends our understanding beyond human-dominated landscapes contributing to degraded stream ecosystems via only terrestrial changes to include the contribution of watershed et al. 2007). (burcher richness 151 perkin et al. impoundments towards the ongoing decline of stream fishes that lack tolerant or generalist traits (poff & allan 1995). impoundments facilitating invasion the to and channel morphologies density of watershed impoundments was not corre- lated with richness of impoundment-associated spe- cies in either basin. we hypothesised that these impoundments would increase richness of impoundment species indirectly by altering flow regimes favour impoundment species or directly by contributing propagules. this finding is in spite of watershed impoundments such as those included in this study being stocked annually with >2.5 billion fishes across north america (heidinger 1999; dauwalter & jack- son 2005) and individuals frequently washing out through overflow structures (flickinger et al. 1999). although propagules can disperse through altered hydrologic connections to sustain or supplement fish communities (woodford et al. 2013), our correlative approach found no evidence of such connection. this is most likely an artefact of our use of species occur- rence (i.e., binary) as a response variable rather than density or abundance (i.e., continuous), two measures that would be more sensitive to propagule supple- mentation given that occurrence of only a single indi- vidual informs species richness. further, watershed impoundments are known to contribute to narrower and shallower channels with finer substrates (fried- man et al. 1998; earl & wood 2002), and these habi- tat modifications would tend to reduce habitat capacity for impoundment species as measured in our study. evidence for this interaction was illustrated by the negative, but not significant, total effect of watershed impoundments on habitat capacity for impoundment-associated fish species sems in both basins. instead, we found that impoundment-associ- ated species richness increased in an easterly direc- tion as related to local habitat and is largely unrelated to landscape although large impoundments are associated with fish invasions in the great plains (gido et al. 2004), additional research directly testing for the dispersal of adults or propagules into surrounding streams is necessary to evaluate any increased inva- sion potential caused by watershed impoundments. from impoundments alterations. thus, broader context structural equation models provide a useful approach for integrating existing conceptual models of commu- nity assembly in hierarchically structured (dendritic) ecological networks. the metacommunity concept posits that local community composition may be 152 in large numbers influenced by a combination of local (e.g., niche fil- tering) and regional (e.g., dispersal among localities) processes (leibold et al. 2004). our findings suggest that niche filtering imposes an overriding influence on the composition of prairie stream fish communi- ties in kansas. local environmental conditions (i.e., stream width, depth, area) associated with catchment land use and geographic location influenced commu- nity composition likely by differentially filtering impoundment-associated and stream-associated com- munity members. by contrast, our sems did not indicate a direct positive effect of impoundment den- sity on the richness of impoundment-associated fishes, suggesting that impoundment species do not disperse from upstream impoundments into sampling sites. although move- ment of fishes from small impoundments to streams does not appear to contribute to community assembly in prairie streams, such mass effects (sensu leibold et al. 2004) can be important drivers of community composition in these same prairie streams in other contexts. for example, perkin & gido (2012) showed that headwater stream fish communities are altered when isolated from adjacent stream reaches by perched road crossings. in this context, stream-associ- ated fishes with greater dispersal affinities were most afflicted by fragmentation, suggesting that habitat associations might determine, at least in part, species response to hydrologic connectivity (perkin et al. 2013). if stream-associated fishes require greater hab- itat and hydrologic connectivity, then fragmentation of this connectivity might constitute an additional pathway through which watershed impoundments imperil stream fishes (gerken & paukert 2013). this hypothesis might be tested by measuring and compar- ing the dispersal affinities and habitat associations of stream-associated and impoundment-associated fishes (gido et al. 2009). dendritic ecological networks are unique among other landscape types in that local habitat characteris- tics are a consequence of hierarchically structured stream habitat (campbell grant et al. 2007), whereby environmental characteristics of the upstream catch- ment constrain in stream habitat (frissell et al. 1986; burcher et al. 2007). studies from a variety of regions have demonstrated this through frameworks such as the lcc (burcher et al. 2007), although the stimuli for change within streams generally include terrestrial land cover change (likens et al. 1978; richards et al. 1996; wang et al. 1997; maloney & weller 2011). however, in addition to terrestrial landscape modification affecting local habitat charac- teristics, our study highlights the potential for coinci- dent watershed impoundments to negatively govern the distribution of some stream fishes. the sem framework provides an effective means to characte- watershed alterations influence fish community structure

density and community composition. in summary, the con- straints that formerly plagued our ability to assess how multiple, interacting landscape alterations influ- ence stream ecosystems (see allan 2004) have largely been addressed by advancing application of sem frameworks (bizzi et al. 2013). to ecological problems conclusion prairie stream fish communities have undergone drastic change in the past century as a consequence of broad-scale human alteration of great plains landscapes (gido et al. 2010; perkin et al. 2014). previous studies have revealed a variety of mecha- nisms by which such change has occurred including groundwater extraction (falke et al. 2010), con- struction of large impoundments on river main stems (falke & gido 2006), conversion of native prairie to human land uses (gerken & paukert 2013) and fragmentation of hydrologic connectivity in headwater stream reaches by road crossings (per- kin & gido 2012). despite these established rela- tionships, some landscape-scale threats to stream fishes are routinely overlooked (utz 2014). the current study provides a test of the effects of a pre- viously unevaluated type of landscape modification (watershed impoundment construction) that is preva- lent throughout most regions of the world (lehner et al. 2011). it is important to consider the context dependencies of species-environment relationships, particularly when performing analyses at broad spa- tial extents where relatively long gradients (e.g., geographic location) might influence the relation- ships observed between biota and the relatively short environmental gradients (e.g., local habitat or land cover) that are nested within (maloney & wel- ler 2011). in this study, although impoundment- associated fish richness increased from west to east across the entire extent of the state, the conver- gence of relatively equal numbers of impoundment and stream species in the eastern extent of the state was actually related to the negative relationship between (develop- ment + impoundments) and stream-associated fish richness. thus, our study highlights effects of pre- viously documented mechanisms responsible for transferring land-cover-disturbances to stream biota (e.g., agricultural or urban land development; bur- cher et al. 2007) and provides new evidence for the largely ignored effects of watershed impoundments on stream fish community structure. modifications landscape acknowledgements this study was funded by the kansas department of wildlife, parks and tourism (kdwpt), kansas state university, and a harold
